This is r/ravens
I don't see wtf this has to do with this sub
I was looking at the stats and he did not register a tackle.
"The opposite. The coaches are speaking very well of him this year. Tbf he isn‚Äôt playing that well but much better than what last year, which people just assume"
"No, Jimmy Smith just took his role on the outside for this past matchup. We used Jimmy outside a lot this week because he does well against the tall physical receivers cinci has while Marlon mainly covered Boyd in the slot. Last week Jimmy played a lot of deep safety, and vs KC he was matched up against Kelce a lot. 


He‚Äôs turning into a pure Swiss Army knife for this defense and it‚Äôs beautiful to watch."
"says he got 11 snaps (16%), but he's played half the special team snaps"
"Calais had 2 tackles, but he played a great game. 

Stats aren‚Äôt everything."

Guy in the replies mad that Marlon blocked him for calling him Marvin.
Humphrey was born to be a Raven. A literal raven.
I was expecting her to say he punches sandwiches and shit out of her hand all time lol
That‚Äôs my favorite
AHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHHH AHHHHHHHHHH. -Marlon Humphrey

Poor kid. Reminds me of Randy Marsh saying ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt hear no bell‚Äù every time he takes a snap
Dude has a rock for a tricep lol.
I‚Äôm a simple man. I see Big Baby and I nut (and upvote)
Burrow I‚Äôm so sorry...
"I posted a few weeks ago about wanting to pay someone to mail me a ravens scratch off and if possible a ravens bic lighter from a gas station. I sent one guy money but they just never showed up. I will pay for the stuff from the gas station. I‚Äôm just looking for someone to buy me a $10 Ravens scratch off ticket (unscratched) and a ravens lighter (always look for them but we only have Steelers, browns, and bengals). Thank you for taking the time to read this. Y‚Äôall are great!"
I'm in ca and would love one also lmk if you have luck
"I can do it for you, DM me your info"
"Put the dude who took your money and didnt send it on blast. Are they part of our sub?

Is it the dude who owes everyone a jersey too?"

That‚Äôs quite the system they‚Äôve got there for wideouts.
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt see them run it much at all anymore.  Any ideas why?  Am I making things up here?
"They still do lol, just last game the ravens put the focus on passing for some reason. You‚Äôll see it more soon"
"This is what I‚Äôve been asking the last couple weeks. Our offense revolved around the read option last year. We ran it multiple times a drive and Ingram and Lamar both excelled at it. I don‚Äôt think we ran it once yesterday and have only run it a few times all year from my recollection- definitely nowhere near how much we used it last year.

I remember against the Rams last year knowing it was going to be a blowout when the read option was working early. I knew the Bills game would be tough when it wasn‚Äôt working early.  

So what has changed? They have barely run it all year so it isn‚Äôt Lamar being hurt. Teams having tape on it doesn‚Äôt matter because you can know it is coming and can‚Äôt stop it if the right read is made. 

Only thing left is concern with running Lamar so much. Or I guess the offensive line isn‚Äôt nearly as good is another possibility. It‚Äôs too bad because it is what made our offense what it was last year. It opened up everything. I also think Dobbins would be great at it too."
I think Lamar is hurt
I blame the hole left by Yanda on the oline.  Pass protection has been pathetic this season.
""
"Don't know why people assume middling receivers would produce the same on our team as they do on other teams. We're already significantly less pass heavy then most teams. And when we do decide to air it out like we did last week, Lamar targets Hollywood and Mandrews almost exclusively. We have receiving talent that we're underutilizing, we don't need to act like the grass is greener in Carolina of all places."
"Dudes don't get that our recievers aren't really the issue. It's the fact that romans pass plays are Bland and poor at scheming guys open. The reason lamar only passes to Andrews and Hollywood is because nobody else is getting themselves open. We need to scheme around them. Boykin is like 6'3"" and duvernay runs a 4.3 40. We should be designing plays specifically for them as well. We have one of the most dominant run games ever when we choose to use it, we really shouldn't need a top 5 receiving corps to be successful."
"What role would he have on our team?   We already have Hollywood who has that same skillset.  Our team is not really pass heavy to warrant two small speedster WRs.  And paying $10m to a guy who doesn‚Äôt have a clear cut role and before this season only had good, not great seasons just seems like a luxury for a team that had other holes.  It‚Äôs not like anyone expected WR to be our need this season.  

Of course now it seems like we should have made a move, but I‚Äôm not mad at EDC for failing to do so."
"Meh, Robbie Anderson wanted to be reunited with Matt Rhule."
I felt the same way about Shaq Barrett last year.
With as bad as New Orleans has been.... would EDC take a shot at Cam Jordan
Melvin Ingram seems more likely imo especially now that they are 1-4.
"Saints are 3-2, tied for division lead and just won with their defense. They are not trading All Decade Cam Jordan."
The Saints problem is somewhat fixable Peyton just doesn't have the heart to tell Brees he's getting benched for Winston or whatever other QB they bring in.
"If I had to guess, Saints would want Hollywood brown in return...

They miss Mike Thomas badly"

Lol the way you said fighting for a new soul makes it seem like a war between angels and demons for your child and not for her fan loyalty lol
"My wife‚Äôs family are also eagles fans. My father in law who is a Eagles season ticket holder got Brian Billick to do a cameo video for me as a congrats when my son was born in August. 

He got Brian to ask if he was coming home from the hospital in an Eagles or Ravens jersey. As if there would be a choice. 

Congrats on your daughter"

Luna‚Äôs an awesome name. Congrats!
"I remember the Ravens media had said this offseason that they would be using crowd noise from real games this season to pump in noise. In the Saints game after their tds they play a recording of the crowd doing ‚Äúwho dat who dat‚Äù. Why are the Ravens not playing the crowd doing seven nation army after tds and turnovers? We need that badly, doesn‚Äôt feel right watching games without it recently"
"I think they‚Äôre indeed pushing crowd noises thru the Stadium speakers. But if you‚Äôre watching on TV, the crowd you hear is being added by the TV company."
I'm also missing the chants of R-A-V-E-N-S RAVENS! after scoring plays led by Real Fan Dan
I coulda sword they played seven nation army right after Hollywood scored.
"IIRC artificial crowd noise is controlled by the NFL at the stadiums, not the home team."
"Want crowd noise? Let fans back. I love the silence, fuck the fake noise."
Because it‚Äôs stupid as hell and completely unoriginal
"disclaimer: this is such a weird and random request - a couple(?) months ago a video circulated on instagram of lamar jackson holding a shield and dancing in the ravens locker room. i can‚Äôt remember which teammate posted it nor which sports page reposted it. but i‚Äôm just curious if anyone else out there saw it and can link it to me?

the song in the background is dank and i‚Äôm trying to find it - it‚Äôs driving me insane üò≠
 
btw ravens are looking great and can honestly say i‚Äôm jealous of you guys, keep it up ‚úäüèª"
Can we have our records back?

I'm now hype af for this game
"I'm hyped too, but right now, we gotta worry about Philly and getting this passing attack back into rhytmn."
Ben won't be able to tackle him either
"Steelers opponents so far have a combined 3-13-1 record LMAO and they‚Äôve all been close games. 10, 5, 7 and 9 point wins LMAOOO. Steelers are so fraud and will get exposed during the second half of the season. I can‚Äôt believe people are actually buying into them."
To be fair the defense has won those last few games against Pittsburgh regardless
Steelers ain't a real team. Yet.
I didn't capitalize pronouns on purpose in case anyone asks.

"Tucker is currently sitting at 90.759% while Butker is in second at 89.655% respectively. 

I‚Äôm happy to look up any more information you‚Äôd need to figure it out, but I‚Äôm just incredibly curious.

[Tuckers % ](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/fg_perc_career.htm)"
Only 4 extra misses and he‚Äôd lose the title to Butker
Bonus: he also sits at a whopping 99.1% for career XPs made. 315 out of 318 is insane.
"For his career Justin Tucker sits at 303 att 275 makes 

20-29yds 70 att 70 makes

30-39yds 85 att 83 makes 

40-49yds 92 att 83 makes

50+ yds 56 att 39 makes"
"So, here's a bunch of stat stuff, based on their careers through 11 October 2020:

&#x200B;

**Total games**

* Tucker: 133
* Butker: 50

Tucker has 2.66x as many games as Butker

&#x200B;

**Overall field goals**

* Tucker: 275/303 (90.759%)
* Butker: 104/116 (89.655%)

Tucker has attempted 2.61x as many FG as Butker

&#x200B;

**50+ yard field goals**

* Tucker: 39/56 -- 69.643%
* Butker: 11/17 -- 64.706%
* Tucker: 56/303 attempts -- 18.482%
* Butker: 17/116 attempts -- 14.655%

Tucker has attempted 3.29x as many 50+ yard FG as Butker

Tucker has had a higher % of his attempts at 50+ yards than Butker (though not by much)

&#x200B;

**<30 yard field goals**

* Tucker: 70/70 -- 100%
* Butker: 29/29 -- 100%
* Tucker: 70/303 attempts -- 23.102%
* Butker: 29/116 attempts -- 25.000%

Tucker has attempted 2.41x as many <30 yard FG as Butker

Tucker has had a lower % of his attempts at <30 yards than Butker (though not by much)

&#x200B;

**If they each miss their next four FG attempts**

* Tucker: 275/307 -- 89.577% (a drop of 1.182%)
* Butker: 104/120 -- 86.667% (a drop of 2.988%)"
The 61 yarder the end of the first half this was all I can think about was his completion percentage
"If your kicker is not in the 90 percentile, disgusting."
"Whatever it is, the number keeps going up because on any given game, even if he has a miss, there are at least 2 hits to mathematically squash it."
"Ravens didn‚Äôt set the world on fire, but a win is a win. Right?

That‚Äôs fine. Just had to do better when you pass. Less four verts and more crossers. Challenge outside the numbers more. More short and intermediate routes that aren‚Äôt seams. The zig Hollywood ran on third was beautiful.

"When you are trying to build a multi dimensional offense you need to practice new plays. 


When you lose your all pro right guard and ask your young offensive line to pass block when they are behind in down and distance there will be growing pains.

If we can add 10 really good plays that attack outside of the numbers to the 2 dozen plays that attack the middle who is going to stop us. Shit teams had to have a stacked defense up the middle just to slow us down last year."

"Roman and Harbs are getting lots of questions regarding our passing deficiencies. But I haven't come across anything digging into Coach Culley's hand in what we're seeing. He's the ""passing game coordinator"" and WR coach. Has anyone come across anything detailing what the hell he's doing this year?"
"Nobody outside the building has any idea how much input he has and therefore how much heat he might be getting. For all we know the ""Passing Game Coordinator"" title might be nonsense and he's just the WRs coach with a fancier title."
"I think it was 2014 or 2015 when he was on the Chiefs and KC receivers had 0 (zero) TDs that year in 16 games. Now I know nothing about coaching, receivers, or football in general, it's just an interesting information regarding Culley."
yall just be googling people to hate lmao
This is what I want to know. My assumption is that he has very little input as far as our passing scheme is concerned. Roman seems like the type to fully run the show
He needs the boot too

"He can be our guy without being perfect and still have areas that need improvement/work.  You're not a fake fan just because you see the flaws (and potentially ways to fix them) on your favorite team.  Lamar, of all people, is a guy who knows he has elements of his game to work on and is, by all means, willing to put in the work."
"Stony Case. Elvis Grbac. Kyle Boller. Vinny Testaverde.

The people who are bitching about Lamar didn't sit through games watching these guys play.

They jump on the bandwagon for one season, don't understand the game, and then complain when he doesn't throw 350+ yards and rush for 100 every game.

Me, I love the guy. I think he might be playing a little sore or hurt, but let's also remember last season was above and beyond anyone's expectations.

Sit back, enjoy the ride. Root hard and DON'T.BE.A.JERK!"

TLDR: People are stupid. Just be rational and understand that Lamar won‚Äôt be perfect every week and will struggle sometimes. Go ravens."
"I've said this and I will keep saying: That's part of what has people frustrated. It's not that we now think Lamar sucks. It's that we all love Lamar, and we know he can do a lot better than what he's been doing"
we're 4-1.
[deleted]
"This sub has become full of fake fans and/or trolls. People who want to stir up negativity around an elite teams fanbase. They want to create ‚Äúdis-truss‚Äù of the team. They want us to lose faith in the Ravens.

We are 4-1!! We curb stomped the 4-1 Browns. Our defense has the best PPG average in the league. Who cares if the offense hasn‚Äôt fully got it together by week 5! We‚Äôre off to a great start and our offense will get better as it run‚Äôs the ball more later in the season, because we typically run the ball more in cold weather.

I don‚Äôt care if Lamar isn‚Äôt putting up MVP numbers. He‚Äôs still preforming well and keeping turnovers to a minimum. 

Also: WE LEAD THE LEAGUE IN TOTAL RUSHING YARDS. Lets see, best defensive PPG..leading the league in rushing yards..

This is what happens when you get a bunch of bandwagon fans. They all get sour when things aren‚Äôt working 100% perfectly. Imagine being disappointed in a 4-1 team. 

Also, look for the return of Ravens fans to the bank next home game."
"The only issue with the offense is that they no longer run to set up the pass. If we can get back to that then we‚Äôll start to look dominant again.

I think that Lamar and the offense gain confidence from qb runs and that we should encourage our mvp to tuck and run rather than try to prove the haters wrong by throwing deep to Hollywood in double coverage."
"They're a young offense with plenty of room to grow. Personally, I'm excited to watch him develop and take ownership of the offense."
Murray?
"Turned around the franchise? You're going a bit into the deep end there. I mean we had 5 years of average, and were perennial contenders outside of that and had a Superbowl win. It's also only been one full year. I mean I love him as much as the next guy but not at the cost of disrespecting the history of the franchise. 

The real guys behind the greatness of the franchise are the GMs. They pull in incredible talent at a very consistent rate. Almost all of our greats came to us through the draft rather than through free agency. There are so many great players in our history of 25 years it's crazy."
"Honestly I stand with Lamar. I feel like he's getting into his own head and not having fun out there right now. That's what made him so special last year. He did what he wanted, but had fun. This year it seems as if he has to over perform for some reason. And the matchup against Patrick really messed him up big time."
"Hawks fan here (bird gang respect) and I gotta say, the criticism will only get worse as your success continues. Russ is on another insane tear and even i find myself criticizing his every mistake, because when there are less, they all seem to matter more. Keep your heads high, cause I wanna see a bird on bird bowl. Also, fuck the steelers."
I love Lamar. I hate the purple pants. ü§Æ
Who is dissing him? Year three and he gets better every season.  Beating KC will come in time
"Is every fanbase as dismissive of our coordinators as ours is?  Hey, we made it through Matt Cavanaugh, we can survive Greg Roman.  The only OC that seemed to be a fans choice was Gary Kubiak.  Well he‚Äôs calling plays in Minnesota and they look good at times but this year without Diggs they aren‚Äôt the same.

Let‚Äôs start a game.  Greg Roman is a better OC than..."

"Give it time, I don't know if it's a need for him and the team to gel together more, or justs needs to be more consistent, but I'm sure he'll get back up to where he was last year (I mean he's already doing good now!)"
Amen
Any Ravens fan that is bitching is a fuckin bitch.
#THAT‚ÄôS MY QUARTERBACK!!
Let‚Äôs win a championship first
This guy is a beast cant wait to see more of him
"I was at that game, on the 50 yard line!"
Anyone that thinks Lamar is a problem is an absolute buffoon. He‚Äôs the only reason this offense doesn‚Äôt look like the horrible scheme that it is.
Turned around the Franchise is a strong phrase I feel...
"Still hasn't done what Joe Flacco did; win a playoff  game/SB, still not many people in this town will put respect on Joe Flacco's name. Lamar needs to play better sorry."
Forever grateful for Lamar üôè I just want want him to take the next step.  It really feels like he's regressing from a passing standpoint. Our O-line hasn't helped with poor pass blocking. That Bengals game was eye-opening. Mainly because he didn't run at all and his passing was extremely off.
"The teams that win superbowls often get hot at the right time. I honestly think us having issues to work on and stuff to correct and still winning is sort of an advantage. We have a lot to go over and a lot of space to get better.  I also think Lamar might be playing a little hurt. Also, our offense has been super simple this year I think we might not be putting stuff on tape when we don't need to against some of these lesser teams."
Should I genuflect?

"We are all wonderful fans and I‚Äôm not speculating anyone‚Äôs commitment or football brains. Maybe I‚Äôm a bleeding heart, but we just beat an NFL team 27-3, a team that has fucked us many times. Look, all I‚Äôm saying is this isn‚Äôt the ACC, sure we have concerns but god damn, enjoy the window while it‚Äôs here. This is fun."
"People are still just sore from the ass whooping from the chiefs. Can‚Äôt expect the team in cruise control demolishing bad teams to really erase that. There are clearly issues and concerns to be addressed. There were a lot of complaints in 2012 as well and the team ended up winning the sb. It is important to be realistic and assess issues with the team, while also trying to enjoy wins against inferior opponents. Going to take some time for everyone to get over the chiefs loss though, it was a brutal one. The team has looked off offensively since then, and people are wanting to see improvement. That takes time, it will come."
" It's funny... The ravens are currently #1 in the entire league in dvoa. They have the #17 off, #3 def and #1 spec teams by that metric. They also lead the NFL in point differential. They are doing all of that while trying to figure things out on offense. 

If this team figures it out on offense, they will be better than they were last yr."
idk i‚Äôd rather talk about the issue than circlejerk over how good the team is. then again everyone has different motivations for being on here so as long as people aren‚Äôt rude I don‚Äôt care
"Yeah we really are. It‚Äôs okay to have criticism over a players performance or of the teams game plan. But I really can‚Äôt enjoy myself when I‚Äôm in the Game Day Live Thread. One small mistake and it‚Äôs ‚Äútrade him‚Äù or ‚Äúfire him‚Äù or ‚Äúthis defense is shit‚Äù etc etc. 

Like you can‚Äôt expect this team to outscore our opponents by 50 every game."
"This probably goes to your point of us being spoiled, but once we take a 2 score lead, or the opponent does (which happens less often) the game sort of feels over."
Exactly I hate all the fake fans. I pass dropped and it‚Äôs fire this guy fire that guy! I remember Flacco days where every game came down to a one score win or loss
"I‚Äôve been a fan since 2008 and we have had exactly 1 losing season. Sure a fair bit a disappointment missing the playoffs but never realizing 3 games into the season that your team has no hope.  We even transitioned from Flacco to Jackson without any pains.

It‚Äôs good to be a Ravens fan."
When you see the potential this offense have it‚Äôs har to settle for mediocrity. I‚Äôm just so proud of our defense so I don‚Äôt care. 4-1 baby!
"It‚Äôs ok to expect the best, from the best."
"I mean we can't go 16-0 anymore and I'm pretty pissed and disappointed /s

Not long ago Flacco was our leader and we legit couldn't win more than 2 games in a row or win by a comfortable margin. I'm not bashing Flacco because Superbowl but it makes me all the more thankful for Jackson"
"The only problem is the offense is not yet complete.  We need 2 big, physical, play making recievers.   Hollywood and Mark Andrews are insane but Hollywood's size (5'8) and Andrews speed at tight end truly equal out to only 1 reciever.  Lamar is intent on being a pocket passer (albeit most probably from criticism) and not running.  The Defense is ravenous.  You can pretty much guarantee at least 1 defensive td a game.  The running game is solid but unorthodox."
Yes. üíØ I was saying the same thing. Let‚Äôs appreciate the team we have right now. We would‚Äôve given anything 10 years ago to be the team that averages 30+ points per game.
"Definitely. Its annoying to see people bash a team thats better and has been better than a lot of teams in such a short amount of time. People put everything under a microscope and think they are the head coach or GM. Its like people would rather our QB throw for 500 yards and lose than do what needs to be done, even if its ugly on the stat sheet, to win. I often wonder how long the people who constantly complain have been actually a fan of the team. Considering how many posts in this sub of fans jumping ship from their shitty team to root for the Ravens. Its like, do any of you complainers remember it wasnt too long ago where 8-8 was considered a ""good"" season? Or when we had an endless carousel of QB's before we drafted Flacco? Do people not remember jumping from Elvis Grbac to Randall Cunningham to Jeff Blake to Chris Redmon to Kyle Boller to Anthony Wright to Steve McNair back to Kyle Boller and then back to McNair?"

"On today‚Äôs [Ravens ReCAP](https://ravensrecap.com/27-3-home-bengals-recap/) we discuss the powerful defensive performance and Patrick Queen‚Äôs development. We also discuss the Ravens offensive identity and remind ourselves where the Ravens were a year ago. 

If you enjoyed [last week‚Äôs Offensive Filmstudy](https://www.filmstudybaltimore.com/offense-notes-week-4-ravens-football-team/) with u/Filmstudy, I go on another Dobbins Diatribe this episode."
Only the banged-up New York Jets are worse.
Efficiency is good
"They rank 31st in passing yards. They don't rank that poorly in passing efficiency.

They were what? 27th in passing yards last yr? Well, it didn't matter because their run game grinded out yards. They were 1st in passing efficiency.

The jets are awful because they are terrible in both yards and efficiency."
TrAdE lAmAr!!!
They've been up pretty big on everyone aside from the chiefs. There's no reason to be chucking it up when you're in the lead and the team is a top running team in the league
Don't take volume stats too seriously. We would be passing more if we were behind more. We were bottom third in the league last year in passing yards too.
Sunk in and still don't give a fuck. 4-1 with room to improve. Most Ravens fans can remember offenses much more stagnate from past seasons. Keep faith and fuck the Steelers.
The Ravens were 27th in passing last year. Who gives a shit
They're 4 and 1 and this won't make the head coach wannabes happy because they think they're not running the ball enough.
"The number one passing team is 1-3.

Let that sink in."
Stink in
Worrying stat but we‚Äôll be fine we‚Äôre still better than 95% of the other teams who chuck it 50 times a game. Only teams I‚Äôll worry about are the Chiefs Steelers Patriots maybe Bills but they‚Äôre due to get exposed and they will.
I don't care what we threw.. what did we run for and how much clock got ran off
Even last year w our OP offense we didn‚Äôt have volume stats for passing.
"Ravens had such a strong second half of the season that I believe people forget how bad they were doing UNTIL week 7 versus the Seahawks when we acquired Marcus Peters, cut a lot of people and did some change arounds. 
It‚Äôs only week 6 , with no preseason. Think we should be confident and believe they will clean up mistakes in the season half of the season. 
Anything you think is wrong, I‚Äôm sure the coaches and players are aware and more. 
Even with the woes, we‚Äôre still more dynamic than 2012- (early) 2018 ravens. Hell, I was a fan during Kyle Boller era. I MUCH rather us be under dogs and under the radar. It‚Äôs kinda annoying that we‚Äôre so good that we‚Äôre on blast for the entire league and any little mistake is amplified to the max by everyone outside the ravens base. 
We got this and I just pray the season doesn‚Äôt get canceled and all our players stay healthy."
"We weren't even doing ""bad"" prior to week 7 last year. 

People on this sub seem to have forgotten that most teams don't just flat out expect to win every game. 

I totally agree that our offense has looked a little off, but we're still out there bodying teams. 38-6 vs. the Browns... 27-3... 31-17... these are beatdowns.

There are plenty of playoff caliber teams that don't blow teams out this badly. We are still a very good football team, and if they can get the offense rolling again, we may be unstoppable."
"The issue I have is that we are seeing the same mistakes we‚Äôve seen time and time again. Usually hitting us in big games. It‚Äôs not like penalties are killing us which can be fixed. It runs deeper. 

I do believe these issues can be fixed, it‚Äôs just frustrating to see the same things crop up. 

I‚Äôm taking the bengals game lightly as I do feel Lamar being banged up and no practising played some part. 

This Eagles game will be a good indicator. They aren‚Äôt a great team but they seem to be able to hang about and flash at times. I‚Äôd like to see us go there and play an all phases good game. We really need to see receivers stepping up too."

Whatever effect you were going for on that headline you got it from me.
Clickbait!!üôÑ

RG3 has become incredibly outspoken recently. And I'm all for it
"Watching this bils game rn, Josh Allen isnt even really throwing that accuratley, Diggs is looking so good at finding space right now and opening the field though. Bills playcalling and route design is also really nice."
I think with the right play calling Hollywood and Duvernay could possibly be the best 1-2 combo the Ravens have had in a long while. The speed and ability is just too great. Hollywood's route running and Duvernays burst and big play ability makes me happy at night
Allen just forced a throw to Diggs in triple coverage. He‚Äôs been tearing it up but looks extremely human tonight. Lamar will get back on track. I agree play-calling is really the key.
"All you gotta look at is the 2012 Ravens. Sure Flacco was slinging it, but every time he felt like he was in trouble he would just toss it in the general vicinity of Anquon Boldin and more often than not, Boldin comes down with it. We lose Boldin, all of a sudden Flacco is a shell of his former self.

MAndrews is the closest thing we have to that now, and he ranks 4th on the team in routes run. Having that true possession receiver that can beat any corner in the league 1v1 is what we are missing. All other contenders have him. Chiefs have Hill and Kelce, Bills have Diggs, Packers have Adams, Cowboys got Cooper, Seahawks have DK and Locket. 

I think getting Lamar his Q is what we are really missing from being one of the most dominant franchises ever. Sure Hollywood, Boykin, and Duvernay have all showed varying levels of promise, but I don‚Äôt think any of them are going to turn into that Q role we need."
The Bills have been secretly good the past couple of years. Adding Diggs was definitely the right move as he breaks up the game plan. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they win their division by multiple games and even win a playoff game. (Not good enough to go past that point yet though)
"The bills' secret is that daboll's becoming a better pass game co-ordinator. They scheme up a lot of high percentage throws.

Allen has improved a lot as well.

Diggs is the icing on the cake for them."
Russell Wilson got DK ..... hes immediately in the MVP disscussion.
"He also has John Brown, I always thought he was a number one as well."
""
Excellent content
"That shit was straight up disrespectful of Henry, He might as well take a piss on Norman while he's establishing dominance"

How the fuck is Adam Gase a good enough con artist to stay employed?
üß≤üö™
Sign him as a receiver lol
"Jets fan here, Bell is still really good and I think would be great for you guys. He‚Äôs a great pass blocker and pass catcher too, he isn‚Äôt just a runner. I think he is going to tear it up wherever he goes, he could help Lamar out by doing the little things right."
Bell wasnt the reason jets are 0-5 its that dumbass they call a coach. I never understand why the jets chose gase. Did they not see him in miami
I feel bad for Jets fans. Somehow Adam Gase has lasted longer in that organization than Jamal Adams and Le‚ÄôVeon Bell.
"Must have been real awkward for Flacco and Bell last week. After all those great ravens/Steelers games they found themselves together, exiled to the Jets"
I don‚Äôt think we have room for him
Really don't want the Ravens to bother.  He hasn't looked anywhere near as good since he took a season off.
üëÄüëÄüëÄ
"Jets are fully embracing the tank. I'm curious if we'd be able to pry a player like Herndon, Williamson, or Maye off their hands on the cheap. Herndon especially I think could thrive here as a TE2.

For Bell, he's accounting for $15M in dead cap for the Jets. I highly doubt he'll be expensive wherever he wants to go. But I also think he wants to win, and he wants to be featured. My guess in order of likeliness:

1. Buffalo
2. Pittsburgh
3. Chicago

Dark Horse: After spending years in the tundras of Michigan St., Pittsburgh, and New York, Miami sets up for the future by offering Bell big money, South Beach, and the chance to be Tua's future go-to"
"The Jets have released RB Le'Veon Bell.

He's not coming here. We have 0 need for him
So many in this sub wanted the Ravens to sign him
No one say it the answer is no
Ok
Pass
I hope we give him a look. Ingram doesn‚Äôt look the same as last year and we could use Bell to fill that role while Dobbins develops
[deleted]
No thank you. We already have 3 capable backs and right now don‚Äôt think our Oline is good enough for his patient running style.
"It‚Äôs either going to be Seattle, Patriots or Bucs picking him up. Outside shot of Chiefs"
"Not sure if everyone caught the Pat McAfee show from earlier today, but Pat, Aaron Rodgers, and Aj Hawk had an interesting conversation in regards to Aaron being a good talent evaluator, to which he said yes he thinks he is. 

I would link it but the vid is 40mins long. 

Basically Aaron SURPRISINGLY gave Lamar a huge vote of confidence. He first and foremost mentioned in regards to how you know someone will be a good QB in this league from early on....And randomly he chose Lamar Jackson as an example

 ""Being able to throw the ball at a high level""  ""You have to be able to sling it""...""You look at Lamar, as talented as Lamar is athleticly, he is one of the fastest guys in the league...you watch him in college, he can sling it. I mean he can REALLY SLING IT! Big time arm throwing 75-80 yards""

""So you just knew, #1 he is supremely athletic, #2 he can really throw it. So footwork wise, he's gonna figure it out, with coaching and a good offense"". 

Amazing interview with A-Aron, the guy is must watch TV on the Pat McAfee show every week, looking like an MVP and NFC favorite so far this season. 

I braced for Aaron to roast Lamar after his lethal ""my down years are career years for other QBs"" comment last week...but instead he had nothing but great things to say about him during a season where Lamar and the passing attack are struggling a bit so far."
I remember Rodgers talking with him last year at midfield in a preseason game when we played. Lots of love between the two.
"Lamar see's aaron rodgers as one of the ""Goats"" in football, he said it in a press conference in 2019. It's cool to see rodgers have a lot of confidence in lamar though, I'm sure lamar appreciate it as well."
"I heard it, it was great to hear! Love that show."
"[https://youtu.be/-G7jTSFWKCw?t=810](https://youtu.be/-G7jTSFWKCw?t=810)

Here's the link"
"love rodgers on mcafee's show. he seems like a guy who actually takes things like lamar calling him ""the goat"" to heart as a true sign of respect and will probably keep that in mind for the rest of lamar's career"
That‚Äôs pretty dope that he brought up lamar as a example
"He also further addressed that there are a lot of components of a QB that could be coached, by sheer athleticism isn't one of them. Basically complimenting Lamar's natural athletic ability"
"There‚Äôs nothing surprising about that. Rodgers commented on Lamar while he was still in college saying he was going to be dangerous in the league. After his rookie year Rodgers said that he was surprised Lamar didn‚Äôt take the starting role earlier and he wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if he saw the Ravens in the Super Bowl the next year. And during the MVP ‚Äúrace‚Äù Rodgers said it was Lamar, and it wasn‚Äôt even close, since week 10. Rodgers has always been a fan of Lamar and sung his praises, him saying it again is the least surprising football related thing that‚Äôs happened this week"
game respects game
"His ESPN comment was hilarious.

""It was on for a little bit. The sound was off, though that's normally how I watch ESPN broadcasts the past few years anyway."""
Well we got good coaching. Good offense remains to be seen.
""
Made me love Marlon more! Such awesome energy!
Marlon is having a blast out there and kicking butt doing so
'LaMarlon' (4 + 4 = 8)
"My God Marlon is a different animal. Not a lot of corners that can do as many things as he does at an elite level. Covers, tackles, gets his hands on the football, and physical like a linebacker."
"Marlon- ""Blitz me! Blitz me Wink!""

Next play- ""Burrow drops back, Ravens send pressure and he's SACKED by Marlon Humphrey!""

Dude is such a fucking dog. Also, I'm pretty sure if Marlon punched me in the chest full force he'd straight up cave my ribcage in. Dude has a disgustingly powerful and accurate hook."
"This makes me appreciate the energy Humphrey brings and the poise Lamar has. Like Lamar isn‚Äôt the hypeman for the team, he‚Äôs just focused and always trying to improve. And Humphrey is far and away the hypeman. ‚ÄúBlitz me Wink!‚Äù Gets a sack. Hell yeah."

Ravens sign Bell just to start him against the Steelers üòÇ
"No, but he should've sign with yall instead of us. He'd probably be in several rush title conversations. Now he just gone."
"Bills are probably the best landing spot for him. They have money and Singletary doesn't seem to be good enough to be a lead back.

Would love to have him as I don't think he's washed. Given Gase's history of making everybody worse and instantly becoming better the second they leave, Bell could have a resurgence. I just don't know where he would fit unless we cut Ingram all of a sudden.

That hold out really hasn't paid off beyond getting guaranteed money. His legacy will be 'what could have been?'. He was on a HOF track before the hold out and I don't blame him for holding out, it just didn't work out."
How long before we could trade him? give him 2 week make him look like a GOD and then trade him for a pass rush üòÇ

I left all social media for about a week after that awful MNF game. Bills fans were talking shit??
"i just find it funny how when the bills get killed by the titans no one starts questioning josh allen's legitimacy, or wondering if he can ever come back from a deficit, or talking about how when the bills lose they lose hard.... you know, the way they do anytime lamar loses"
"PS in my heart of hearts I believe the Bills just laid an egg, it happens. They're still a contender. But I will say it over here where the Bills cannot get the satisfaction of my encouragement lol."
"Bills fans are assholes. I live in Pittsburgh (fuck the Steelers)...I went to the Steelers/Bills game last year (girlfriend is a Steelers fan (fuck the Steelers), and the Bills fans were insufferable. They have been like that at the bank too. Had season tickets since memorial and never had a good experience with Bills fans. 

PS...fuck the Steelers...if that wasn‚Äôt clear."
Josh Allen had a terrible game but I feel like if he has his usually game then the Bills still lose just not by as much.  The gap between the Bills and Titans isn‚Äôt as pronounced as the score showed.
I had an argument with a Steelers fan friend saying the Bills were better than the Squealers. I still believe that.
I think the Pats will still win the AFCE

"Considering the depth the team has at RB (Ingram, Edwards & Dobbins). Having a total of 19 carries between the three of them in the last game against Cincy. Really doesn't seem like they're utilizing the talent at that position. Also on a semi side note, I'd like to see Dobbins involved in the passing game more often. Maybe put in the slot position in certain situations."
"i honestly think they are trying to pass as much as possible in what are perceived as the less difficult games to give the offense more reps and looks at it. 

we know we can win the game on the ground, but with lack of camp and presesaon,  have to use season games to get gud."

Looks great! Adding the defensive and blocking assignments (like a Madden play diagram) could add a lot of flair!
"I think it‚Äôs it‚Äôs one play, you should include the line. Don‚Äôt have to show them ‚Äúmoving‚Äù like Jacoby, but I think it would add something. 

Without the line, I think having memorable games could be a good idea. Like one poster mentioned, Torrey Smith‚Äôs game his brother died, Jamal Lewis 295 yards, last minute drives, etc.

"I had a bet double at the start of the year for Queen DROY and Minshew most passing yards. Minshew is 150 yards off the lead so far (minus Dak), so need him to get hot."
It should be noted that he wasn't the defensive *rookie* of the week. He was the defensive *player* of the week.

I remember this game.  Great game!
"He has shown since signing with GB that he absolutely deserved it, but that game probably made Zadarius a hefty sum of money. 1/3 of the sacks in his contract year came in that game."

"I was there! Worst part though ‚Äì we travel all the way to Nashville, climb up to our seats and who do we sit next to? Two huge Steelers fans. Steelers gear on and everything. WHY?"

Basically we are running the ball more effectively but choosing to not take advantage. Our passing game has also regressed.

IMO we need to get back to the run first identity and the passing game will improve.

Edit: It should also be noted that the RBs are running better even with Lamar having a reduced role in the rushing attack."
"‚ÄúIn essence, Brown and Andrews account for nearly half of all Ravens targets through five games. What‚Äôs more alarming is that the rest of the group from Boykin on down have a 69.5% reception rate, while Hollywood and Andrews combine for a 61.6% catch rate‚Ä¶ with five (!) drops, per PFF.‚Äù

This is my issue with Boykin! He‚Äôs not drawing the other teams best defender or double coverage. Most of the times they don‚Äôt even expect the ball to go to him so when they do throw it to him or design the play for him he should be breaking for big yards"
"In there most recent power rankings, CBS placed Pittsburgh at #2 and Baltimore at #5. ESPN and [NFL.com](https://NFL.com) both have Pitt below us, but within 2-3 spots. The Steeler's opponents have a combined Win % of .167, with Pittsburgh only having a net point differential of +52. The Raven's opponents have a combined Win % of .458, nearly triple that of Pittsburgh's, with a net point differential of +90, nearly double that of Pittsburgh's. 

The fact that these organizations put them anywhere close to us, and some even multiple spots ABOVE US is so disrespectful it hurts. I can't wait to shit on them like always, fuck the Steelers. Also fuck the patriots, browns, and bengals."
You will take Pittsburgh to the woodshed. You guys watch.
"Pitt is undefeated and is normally a top team each year, except last year, its not surprising to see them be ranked that high, overrated or not, just based off of their supporters and what people expect of them. I want them to be bad but I'm not gonna worry about ranking until they play us.

&#x200B;

fuck the steelers"
"Steelers opponents have a combined 3 wins.  They‚Äôre about to hit a tough stretch of Cleveland, Ravens and Titans.  They‚Äôll probably come out of that 4-2, media will die drop their praise, then another stretch of bad teams (Dallas, Bengals, Jags) they‚Äôll be the darlings again.  

I‚Äôm not complaining at how easy their schedule is.  It‚Äôs only slightly easier than ours.  Their schedule is backloaded, so we will see how it plays out."
Dan Hanzus knows not to play with us.
"Who cares, really? The only ranking that matters is where you are after week 17. You guys get triggered over the smallest things."
It's not going to matter until we play each other. Their D is pretty good but I'm not confident with their O. But it is true they haven't really played a true contender yet. It will be interesting to see what happens this week.
"Probably a shit post. 

But I just have this feeling that Lamar is going to get back to his old self against the eagles, shake off the jitters and what not. People have been concerned about his level of play and I think Lamar is too and he is going to fix his problems this week and get back to his old self. 

Does anyone else agree with this shit post of mine?"
"He's really, really due for a game where he steals the spotlight."
"I think we've gotten away from a lot of what worked last year. I think the lack of an offseason program also set him back some. Its  fair to assume there would be some form of regression after winning an MVP in an offense there was almost no legit tape on. He's not playing well and some of that falls on the o-line and the OC, he has to play better and I think he will. Philly gives him a good chance to do some the things he likes to do, attack the middle of the field and what not. He's on pace for  3k yds 29 tds & 6 Ints which would stilll be a good season for most QB's (better than any Joe Flacco regular season). I think getting philly and then rolling into a bye before pittsburgh is going to help a lot of things."
"Eagles have the worst staring LB group in the league and it‚Äôs not even close. We also have struggled against mobile QBs last few years. Add the fact that the offense is missing 7 starters, Ravens will coast to a double digit W."
"I don‚Äôt know if I agree, but I‚Äôm certainly hopeful. I think they may be better than their record indicates. They‚Äôre working with a number of backups and still doing well - the number of points they put up against Pittsburgh‚Äôs defense is nothing to sneeze at! I really am hoping that these first few games were like the ‚Äúpreseason‚Äù and we get really clicking."
"i think lamar might play better in front of fans, home or away. so yeah even though they were competative against the steelers last week, i don't think it'll be close."
Personally a bit worried about their beast d line
I agree that i want to see lamar put a 50 berger on em
"Part of me thinks we won't see the aggressive-running, attacking version of Lamar until the stretch run and playoffs."
Should I start Hollywood in fantasy this week?
Cursed post
Yeah just a gut feeling
Mark Andrews will so that helps Lamar to have a bounce back game.
"He'll get back to it. Remember, it wasn't until what, week 8 or 9 that he started to really dominate. Up until then, his numbers were very similar to what they are now."
I feel like the defense is going to bully wentz
Big truss in dobbins week 6
Not with 1 carry per game
You‚Äôre gonna get 45 yards on 4 touches. Only hope is if he manages to find the end zone on one of those.
"I expect him to have some bigger games as the season rolls on with an expanding role from here on out, but there‚Äôs no indication next week is the week to begin that trend. I would hold him for later this season but manage expectations for next week."
"whenever they decide to give him the ball more, he'll pop off. who knows when that'll be, we seem to be a passing offense now for whatever reason."
"Thanks for all the responses. I‚Äôm last in waiver order so I‚Äôve already decided that JK will be my RB2. My matchup is so close that his success will determine whether I win/lose. But yk what, I have faith in the Flock"
"Probably not, what other options do you have?"
you realize gordon is probably gonna play atleast this week
"He will get you 8-10 pts with his current role.

Hopefully they start spinning him up though"
"This could be a good week for him. Most likely Slay will be on Hollywood, so they could lean on the run game more this game."
I'm doing the same. Don't have a choice this week. He's a boom or bust fantasy player at best. We have to hope he finds the end zone on one of his ~5 carries.

"Fuck the Titans. 

Tannehill is a frat douche, Derrick Henry's dread looks like a giant turd after eating nothing but protein for a week and Kamalei Correa sucks.

He's 4th on their depth chart at OLB and was garbage here.

**hard pass**"
"It seemed like Correa started coming into his own during the second half of last season when the Titans were making their playoff push. He worked his way into Tenessee's starting line up and had 7 sacks, 7 QB hits and 7 tackles for loss between the final 8 regular season and 3 postseason games.

I wondered what happened to him (before, you know, getting COVID). I'm guessing the additions of Clowney and Beasley took most of his snaps?"
No
"Lol fuck that team.

On the real though, unless he's a good pass rusher, we don't need him"
Garbage
Noooo thank you. That bridge has been crossed. I don't think he'd be a guy we'd bring back.
"In related news, I am demanding an NFL team signs me!"
Kamalei Corona
Traded to the Jags
Im trolling guys üòÇ
"I feel like theres really one move to make and its Ryan Kerrigan,  we need to bolster our pass rush and he's not bad against run. Are there any other pass rush additions trade or FA that anyone can think of?"
"Takkarist McKinley(24), he exactly hasn't lived  up to the 1st round hype, but he'll be a FA next season plus the  Falcons are in cap hell. I think he can be had for a day 3 pick"
"Melvin Ingram is really the best answer.

Big cap hit now, and he's a UFA in 2021 but he's 31 not at the immediate end of his career with a few years left in him. He brings leadership and good pass rush moves.

He's worked in a 3-4 D and knows how to play the chiefs hard. Wed be able to probably extend him to a 2-3 year deal (2 with a 3rd year option).

He's making less than Judon right now and he's a significantly better player.

He's on IR right now, I wish we would've traded for him back in August, is what it is but I think he'd do well for us.

Edit: I'd like to add this would help shore up OLB while Ferguson develops more and we can draft an OLB or two that can learn from Ingram."
"I would start by involving Duvernay more next week against the Eagles. See what happens, then evaluate the overall offense over the bye week. If Lamar still can‚Äôt rely on anyone besides Brown and Andrews then put together a package and trade for Michael Gallup. 

Last year EDC used every avenue to beef up the defense because it struggled early. This year it‚Äôs the offense, so it deserves the focus."
"I know there‚Äôs not a lot of O-line talent out there, but I feel like if we upgrade the middle this offense would look much more like 2019."
"I know most of this sub is pretty set on getting a WR or pass rusher, but I think Gerald Everett could be a cheap one year rental. Higbee has taken a lot of his share of the Ram's offense and he's in the last year of a four year contract worth about $6 million. 

Everett is a solid blocker and improvement over Boyle as a receiver. He could slide into a Hayden Hurst role and let us utilize more 3 TE sets like last year."
"O Line, WR1 playmaker, Pass rusher. RG3 to Cowboys?"
There‚Äôs no one on the team I‚Äôd like to give up though. Or even any picks. The only spot I‚Äôm concerned about is on our offensive line
"I want a Julio, give us a Julio"
JJ Watt?
"Curtis Samuel. Long Speed, and just the type of YAC receiver we need to compliment the run game."
"Corey Davis

Zach Ertz

Maybe yannick still. He‚Äôs only on a one year deal and Vikings have been garbage. Or one of the 3 edge dude from the Titian‚Äôs. Vic Beasley, Clowney and Harold Landry"
cooper kupp for a third?

Dream would be a 4 way trade where we get Aaron Donald Julio Jones and Khalil Mack without taking any cap hit along with their 1st round picks but I have a feeling that won‚Äôt happen
4th round pick for Mahomes so we don‚Äôt have to worry about the chiefs anymore.
maybe try and get gallup from the cowboys or even like kerrigan from the football team
"yeah

let's throw in mike evans and godwin for a 3rd and 5th next year

sure it'll work, fit in nicely with julio

(realistically, i would want someone like gallup)"
Allen Robinson/Chris Godwin or Michael Gallup for a 2nd rounder.
Quenton Nelson for one of our patented 5th round picks. Go from a sure fire Hall of Fame guard to the best guard of the new generation.
"Julio for a 2nd (late second because were a damn good team) and some mid round picks is a dream.  But taking into account the dead money they would owe for moving him, there‚Äôs not a GM that would make that trade.  Also, other teams would offer a better second than we can if they were dumb enough.  So it‚Äôs pointless to even talk about this trade.  Takkarist McKinley for a 6th would be a trade scenario I could see between ATL and Ravens. 

My realistic dream trade would be Josh Sweat for a 4th.  Eagles are bad.  He‚Äôs good and on a rookie deal through next season."
"Tj watt for a 5th, Julio for a 5th, Za‚ÄôDarius for a 5th"
"We have enough talent to win rings, we just have to do a better job at sequencing drives and making adjustments on the fly. It‚Äôs like the entire first half is scripted, but if we don‚Äôt get the lead early then our play callers wet the bed. It literally happens every stinking time... Can we somehow acquire another offensive mind? Gregg Roman has done an exceptional job at installing this offense and transitioning Lamar to the NFL, but man his incompetence at play calling in high pressure situations is glaring. With Jimmy smith returning I‚Äôm not worried at all on the defensive side of things, with him back they‚Äôll be a sturdy unit. We have the talent to win now, we had the talent to win last year too."
I would like the Ravens to trade for Corey Davis. He should cost too much since he‚Äôs only been okay. Mostly because of marriota being terrible. I think he still has all the tools to be a number 1 WR
Zach Ertz for Powers and a second round pick

"Love Jimmy. Ravens legend

Stealing a comment by /u/yearbookthrowaway1 which perfectly sums up how I feel about Jimmy's legacy as a Raven:

>There's a few stages to a guy's career that make me consider them all time ravens. Overproducing on your rookie contract is one, and a lot of guys do that. Being in the upper echelon of your position during your second contract is another, and that's harder to do. But the hardest is in your third contract, when you accept a diminished role and become a locker room leader and a veteran presence to help develop the next generation of talent on the team, and that's by far the hardest to do. I'm really really happy that Jimmy seems to be checking that third box now. Imo he's en route to the ring of honor."
"Love me some Jimmy Smith, although I will say I was always certain we'd trade or bag him based on injuries and availability.

I think he's deserving of the Ring of Honor. Even though I wanted Jimmy traded for picks or players a few years ago (business is business) I wanted him to succeed terribly.

If he had elite availability and didn't get injured often, I truly believe he'd be talked about on par with PP and Richard Sherman. He was a solid #3 CB if they were 1 and 2 from that draft.

Also he made game saving play on crabtree in SB47"
You guys when remember when our success pretty much depended on this guy‚Äôs health
Never forget that Super Bowl performance! Jimmy deserves a spot in the ring for sure
"I love longtime Ravens who are still on the team - Jimmy, Sam, even guys like Pernell McPhee who left and came back. LOVED having Bynes back last year, which they had resigned him. 

Keeps continuity with the previous eras. Without them it kinda just feels like rooting for laundry."
Will not tolerate any Jimmy slander around me. When healthy jimmy did everything we asked of him. Never had to worry about 22.
"Hard to believe we've already had him for 10 years.  It's a shame he's only played a full 16 game season two times, but he's always been a very physical and reliable corner. 

I was hoping with how we were using him this year he'd stay healthy but it's looking like he's questionable @ Philly."
""
"Found it interesting that after the ravens TD to Hollywood, Lamar and him talked about how Cinci was ‚Äújust going to our spots‚Äù and i hope that doesn‚Äôt mean much but interesting to hear combined with what teams have said about our offense in the past few weeks."
So pretty much just Marlon
"Observation 1: Lamar Jackson isn‚Äôt very exciting mic‚Äôd up

Observation 2: Marlon Humphrey yells a lot

Observation 2a: Marlon Humphrey is our hype man of the present and future

Observation 3: Marlon Humphrey is good at football"

Basically the title. Discuss away friends
"hed be so perfect, that guys is so underrated"
I want Gallup but he‚Äôs actually not bad. If Crowder can be a better Snead for a low pick then it might be worth it.
Best we can do is a 5th
"I mean I‚Äôd prefer a big body for once, but he‚Äôd be an instant upgrade over some of our other WRs"
"‚ÄúAm I a joke to you?‚Äù

-Duvernay, probably"
Yes. He is exactly what we need. His ability to get open quick is up there statistically with MT (not quite there but surprisingly close) and that is exactly what we need.
"Man, fuck it , trade our whole team at this point. I fucking hate them."
I think the receivers we have are a good core to progress forward. I don't think we necessarily need to add more WR's but to utilize the ones we have better.
[deleted]
"Respectfully disagree. Although the skill set isn‚Äôt the exact same, Crowder is very similar to a few of our receivers (Duv and Snead) as far as being smaller build, slot guys.

Crowder is dope but it‚Äôs about time we put duvernay in a lot more and see if he can‚Äôt bring a similar skill set to what crowder would offer us at a way lower price tag. If we go WR it should be a big body guy to replace Boykin but I‚Äôd rather us trade for a OG or Edge rush if we do."
"""Crowder!? I barely know 'er!"""
"Only former Ravens go to the Jets, not the other way around ü§î"

""
Why does the clown face in the second row remind me of the Steelers logo so much
We don't run the ball enough. Lamar throws to 2 receivers. We don't run screens. We don't have any creativity to our offense.  All valid criticisms.
Maybe just me but I have literally not read any takes here re: not even making the playoffs.
"Lol, our defense is better but our offense has taken a step back. I'm not at clown level since I know Lamar can turn it around!"
"While I do think our play calling has been stale, we‚Äôll still dominate the regular season."
Im here taking bets that Roman shits himself in our playoff game.
"I think if we just continue to invest in our offensive line and commit to running the ball, we'll be fine."
There are even people in here saying that Wink should be fired.ü§°
What about the completely realistic critique that is ‚Äúwhy tf aren‚Äôt we running the ball?!‚Äù
It‚Äôs billicheck(sp) and harbaugh and then every other coach is way behind them imo. I hope he never gets fired he has shown the ability to change and adapt to his roster that very few coaches can do.
"I look at it in a positive way. Last year we were rolling winning 12 in a row, no adversity. Weren‚Äôt ready for playoffs and the challenges that brings. This year, we are getting by beating the bad teams, Lamar looks average, and we blitz too much (KC game). Figure it out during the season, get rolling late like 2012 team. Play wild card weekend and win 4 to get the Lombardi back to the bank!"
"There's a few issues that the Ravens need to work on, like getting reliable receiving options in the redzone or helping Lamar get more accurate in tighter windows, but to think they are missing the playoffs is an outrageous claim lol."
Feel like this is the sentiment as last year. Remember the Seattle game? that's when everything changed. Yeah the defense balled out last week but I feel like it was all scheme. I also feel like our offense is only going to improve. It can only get better. We have been spoiled from last year but I think the gameplan is evolving. Trust the process. we got a rookie that set to explode off 7.2 ypc. It's just not healthy to look at the this team currently  and doubt this early. We all saw what happened to the defense last year. And we all know what Lamar and co. are capable of.
"I'm not one of the ungrateful fans who doesn't appreciate being 4-1 for what it is. However, no team is a lock for the playoffs in October unless they have a shit division, and we do not."
I can maybe get behind the idea of Roman being let go. Idk. Harbs needs to stay though
"I haven‚Äôt heard anyone say Harbaugh should be fired, but I do think Greg Roman should be on the hot seat."
"Isn‚Äôt the entire point of this subreddit to discuss the team? I‚Äôd say the true clown is the one who blindly thinks the Ravens have no issues. 

Tons of people who just regurgitate groupthink, which is a clown move as well."
"The way I look at is, if they're 4-1 while not firing on all cylinders, look out later in the year when they get it going!

Besides, with the extra wildcard teams this year, almost 45% of the league makes it into the playoffs, and we're certainly in the top 45%."
Pretty damn accurate IMO
"I mean even if you‚Äôre a bandwagon fan, who tf actually thinks they will miss the playoffs lol"
"The only thing ive seen here and that ive said myself is our Offense gameplan needs to change, lamar has looked a little off on deep throws past couple weeks, and then had some takes on the offense during chiefs game too."
We can‚Äôt forget the ‚Äúshould we pick up Antonio Brown?‚Äù which I see daily on Facebook. Ravens aren‚Äôt comfortable with the OLine with losing Yanda and Stanley playing injured which explains some of the questionable play calling. Yesterday it was Larry Fitzgerald who would never come to Baltimore
"Only thing ive seen is getting Roman fired(I agree) and thats about it. 

Lamar just needs to throw better, Roman chokes against good teams and is too stubborn to adjust, defense a bit worst from last year but still great."
"150% The entire Official Ravens group on Facebook. It is SOOOO bad. Regarding Roman - I obviously don't think he needs to be fired, but some of the plays this guy has been calling with the type of run talent we have have been so boring. He doesn't really try anything fancy or creative. Seeing what KC is doing with Tyreek, what Cleveland is doing with Odell, what LA is doing with Robert Woods, has been extremely eye opening/fun to watch. Duvernay is BEGGING for more touches and looks. This guy is something special in our offense and he needs to be used more. Same with Brown. Get them involved in more cheeky plays. We have speed, but we aren't using it. Just hammering the ball up the middle...over and over again."

not bad for a 5th rounder
"For those interested, since joining the Ravens Peters has 5 interceptions, 199 interception return yards, 1 forced fumble, 1 recovered fumble, 2 TDs, 1 sack, 14 batted passes, and 55 tackles in 15 games. He has been targeted 93 times allowing 55 completions (59% completion rating) for 580 yards (10.5 yards per completion), and allowed 3 TDs. This is all good for a 65.7 passer rating. A QB with a 65.7 passer rating would be 35th out of 35 this year of passers with at least 14 passes per game, and 34th of 34 last year with the same metric. A 65.7 passer rating against would put a CB anywhere from 5th to 15th in a typical year.

Meanwhile on the other side, since Peters‚Äô arrival, Humphrey has 2 interceptions, 8 return yards, 3 forced fumbles, 0 recovered fumbles, 0 TDs, 1.5 sacks, 12 passes batted, and 76 tackles in 15 games. He has been targeted 95 times allowing 57 completions (60% completion rating) for 505 yards (8.85 yards per completion), and allowed 2 TDs. This would be good for a 72.48 passer rating.

Eric decosta : and I‚Äôll fucking do it again
If we can sign one of the best defensive players in the league with all sorts of antics...why the fuck don‚Äôt we aim for a big Signing on the offensive side? I heard the falcons might be cleaning the whole house soon and that includes one of the best receiver of all time Julio Jones who still has some juice left in the tank. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to try to get him and he can end his career with us instead of somewhere he‚Äôs likely going to like the fucking jags or something. We coulda signed LB 2 years ago or Diggs recently bruh honestly it don‚Äôt hurt to try to get AB dudes crazy but he‚Äôs going to stretch the field and make our offense dangerous. Andrews and Hollywood have been great but if we don‚Äôt start getting Duvernay/Proche involved there will be a lot more games that look like week 3 all over again.
This may be the best in-season move our FO has ever made.  Certainly turned our D around last year.
And today KC signs Leveon for nothing. The powerful get more powerful. Nervous but excited for this two-way race to the top

Lamar has talked about how in practice his receivers are getting open and they‚Äôre connecting really well, but then come game day no one can get separation and he‚Äôs missing throws.

"Our ranking last year was bottom 1/4 of the league and we led the league in TDs mate, and what we changed from 2019 was pulling Roman away fom the passing game and installing a new passing coordinator and still blaming Roman instead of watching the film or giving any honest critique that isn't the same regurgitation of ""Roman bad"".

Truth be told- Lamar isn't looking to Snead or Boykin, and they have been plenty open in all of the 22 film. We don't scheme players open, we are using our time with a wide point differential in game as an opportunity to test and teach our passing game, as well as get Lamar under center rather than insanely relying on the pistol formation. So stop complaining and let the coaches keep pushing the awfully bad 4-1 team until we flesh this whole 2020 team out."
Why would he need to answer for it?  We are 4-1 and have had huge leads in the wins (not racking up passing yards when you got a big lead)

>  
>"" While Roman certainly does deserve the blame for the last place passing attack, does he not deserve the credit for a top 4 rushing attack?  
>  
>The dead last ranking has fairly obviously been exacerbated by the fact that the niners simply haven't needed to throw the ball in the majority of their games to win. When you're blowing out your opponents, as the niners had done in the 5 games prior to the Panthers, you don't need to pass the ball. The niners simply haven't passed much and its not even close (40 fewer attempts than the 31st ranked team, 107 less than the average).

>"" I dont think you understand how bad it actually is \[Re: Passing Game\]. You make it seem as though we dont try to pass because we are putting up so many points just by running. That is not true.

Most of these looked quite familiar to what some of us have been saying about the 2020 ravens offense. The last quote on the other hand...

Roman is currently trying to do just that and is still getting blasted. However, i agree w/ the other criticisms of him."
"The top comment on that thread is them complaining about the lackof screens, sound familiar lol"
"Edit: the link is dead but the headline highlights how the 49ers struggled as well with passing the ball under Greg Roman.

The Ravens passing offense is currently only outperforming the abysmal Jets, and not by much.  

Fortunately, the Ravens are ranked #3 for rushing yards per game, with only The Patriots (#2) and The Browns (#1) ahead of them. 

It's an interesting ride searching ""Greg Roman"" on the 49ers sub."
We need to put Hollywood and Duverney in the slot. Put boykins on the outside with a snead
I hope 6 years was enough time to work on those passing schemes.
Can we please as a football world stop using raw yards as the main metric for offensive effectiveness in 2020? DVOA we are 19th which while not where we want to be is also fine for now and not worth panicking about.

I agree with Harbaugh. Shutouts are earned and we let them get in field goal range on two 4th down conversions
"I don't have a problem with it. Shutouts are hard, and they're earned. If you want one then stop them on every drive. If my team was in garbage time to a division rival I'd want a FG too to fuck their shutout"
What's Wink upset about? That Cincy didn't quit even though they were blown out? He should be upset that his defense let them get into position to kick that field goal.
 Cincy let Burrow get destroyed to try and be competitive when the game was lost in the first quarter.....

"Honestly, I don't care. Maybe I should and don't know enough about football? Bell was once a great back, maybe he still he is. Feel like he's probably lost something, but is likely still good. But it's not like the run game was the Chiefs' big weakness. If they had picked up a stud defensive player, I'd feel differently. 

This just feels like the Chiefs making a move they didn't really need to (CEH is good) and Bell predictably ring-chasing."

They‚Äôre only going to do damage to the rest of the league but not us. If we meet in the playoffs that‚Äôs when we should worry but until then we‚Äôre chilling in Baltimore.
Bell makes the chiefs less efficient because they are going to feel like they have to use him. And throwing check downs to the RB / running the ball is way less efficient than throwing downfield to Kelce/ Hill. Plus they invested a first round pick In a RB who they also have  to use

"It‚Äôs been discussed here before, how since we traded Hurst, we haven‚Äôt had the personnel to run the 3 TE sets we ran last season. If the Seahawks are willing to deal Hollister, what would you all think? He isn‚Äôt playing much for them right now, and they seem to prefer Luke Wilson. Thoughts?"
do we not have a third TE on the roster
Hollister was awesome last year when he was getting significant playing time. So if the price is right this would be a great pick up. Not sure how he is in the blocking department though.
"How much is left on the deal? If it‚Äôs one year then sure, but i doubt we carry 4 TEs going into next season and I really love Breeland (plus we stashed him so I doubt we trade for a TE that has more then a year left on there deal)."
"If they were going to offer any of their tight ends im almost positive it would be Olsen before the other 2, remember they also traded for Hollister to begin with"
"Wasn‚Äôt this a ESPN write up? We traded hurst away as we had a different vision. I don‚Äôt see us going back on what they want to do (even though from what we have seen, hasn‚Äôt been working great).

"This is been a bad year for us and I think this should be a mid scoring game with Philadelphia losing by less than ten. Honestly, I would‚Äôve much rather beaten Pittsburgh because as you know, we play in the same state. So the next time, some Steelers fan tries to tell you that they are Pennsylvania‚Äôs team, (cough Penn state actually is) remind them what is on the state flag and the state seal of Pennsylvania and which city has over five times the population of Pittsburgh.  Our injuries and salary cap issues will not be a good matchup for a strong team like Baltimore. You guys are a great team to watch and I love the uniforms with the Maryland state flag embroidered on the patch. Oh and yes, thank you for demolishing the Giants in the Super Bowl 35. Bird Solidarity"
"Hey man..  excited for the game and hopefully it will be fun to watch and no injuries.  I expect our defense will hold you guys to 2 scores and we'll have to see how our offense looks.  Lamar doesn't seem comfortable yet but I think it's coming, maybe even Sunday."
"Hey mate, 
I'm feeling like it will go the same way as most of our games this season. A bit if a grind without looking too flashy, get a 2 score lead and then control it from there. Have also been riding that Andrews is in a favourable match up this week, so I'm excited for that, ( I wear his jersey during games) 
Most Ravens fan would like to see LJ8 have a big game, just for entertainment purposes as much as anything.  
Also expect Peters and Humphrey to get turnovers, especially if the Eagles are chasing points and taking a few risks, throwing into coverage. 
I tell what is hard though, working out if I want the Browns or Steeles to lose."
"The ravens are favored by +7.5 so Vegas thinks the game will be close between us.  With you guys getting your great strong safety back now it should be interesting with the ravens offense vs the Eagles defense, because the IOL is a mess right now and the Eagles DL should feast, but whereas before that didn‚Äôt matter as Mark Andrews would be open most of the time now you get Parks back which means Mandrews will have a far harder time, and a far more equal matchup Andrews vs Parks is a 60-40, Slay vs Hollywood is like 90-10, and I think our other WRs outside of Duvernay aren‚Äôt good enough to feast on your bad CB2/3.  As for the run game I expect it to struggle, because the IOL is still a mess maybe if we put Mekari as starting RG (that‚Äôs if Philipps isn‚Äôt back) we can do a lot more guard pulling (which we did last year with Yanda) like last year which would benefit the run game a ton.  If the ravens run game dominates I see them winning big because then the pass game is opened up.  As for the Eagles offense vs Ravens defense I don‚Äôt have any real confidence in the Eagles offense beating the ravens defense.  The Eagles OL is injured to death missing the starting LT, RT (Tackle #3 is also injured in Peters), and LG this should allow the Ravens DL to feast like it did on another bad OL in the Bengals to make matters worse Wentz is far less mobile then Burrow.  As for weapons your Goeddert (TE2 who is really good) is out with injury, Ertz is underperforming heavily (I think he‚Äôs mad about contract situation), Jackson and Jeffrey are both hurt and there status is questionable, Ward has really nice hands and chemistry with Wentz but he‚Äôs just ok, Fulgham just had one great game and idk what to think of him, and lastly Reagor has looked really nice so far, but he hasn‚Äôt built chemistry with Wentz yet.  Let‚Äôs say the Eagles have back Jackson and Jeffrey I still see Jackson locked up by Humphrey, and Jeffrey likely by Jimmy Smith (Peters can‚Äôt do that with the size difference).  As for the run game I really like Miles Sanders he‚Äôs a fun back to watch, but with that amount of injuries on top of the fact that he‚Äôs more of an outside runner which means the tackles matter a ton just makes me think his biggest impact is out of the backfield as a passing back, because the DL is going to be smacking around the Eagles OL all day.  I think this is either a low scoring game by both sides or a high scoring game by the Ravens (essentially a complete rebound) with the Eagles scoring like 10-17 (I have the Eagles under 19.5 points on the game and feel damn good about it).

Edit: Sorry for the wall of text I‚Äôm typing this on phone so it‚Äôs harder to tell where I should tab the paragraphs"
"Hey bro. Should be a fun game, but as another commenter said, Andrews will probably have a big day. You guys have trouble covering TE's like him. If you can get Sanders going in the screen game and Ertz back to fashion running quick block and release plays then you have a chance. Otherwise, Wentz hanging in the pocket equals big plays for us. Battle of the birds. Game on!

Also, people can say what they want about Philly fans, but this is a cool way to approach a conversation about our teams. Good on ya. Wish I could get a cheese steak from Jim's right now"
Eagles are good team but right now beating the Eagles or any other NFC east team wouldn‚Äôt bring us any joy tbh. We set our goals on bigger things and we‚Äôre hopeful to do that.

"I'm just curious because I don't see people talking about this much..  vs the Bengals, he had 2 attempts, and IIRC both were unplanned scrambles.

So what is the speculation? Injury? He was on injury reports before the Bengals game, and took some days off practice. But physically he has looked fine in these games, just look at the 50 yard TD. 

Mentally I don't see him having as much fun out there as he did last year. CBS shows isos of him on the sidelines often, so we can generally get an idea of his mood. And usually that mood is having fun, and being whacky with Hollywood and Mark Ingram. But even when they were handily beating the Texans, he looked all serious and at times miserable. He was looking a lot better vs the Bengals, but still no planned runs"
"Teams have overplayed Lamar's stretch runs to the outside all year. The ravens generally don't call designed runs for Lamar up the middle. That is a big reason for his statistical decline in that department.

There is a plus side to this. While overpursuing Lamar, teams have left the weakside of the play open more often than not. Thus, running pitch plays and stretch runs opposite lamar's momentum have been highly effective. Duvernay & Dobbins had big runs counter to lamar's momentum against Cincy. 

I also believe the ravens replaced some of his stretch runs with rollout pass attempts."
I think he's hurt and the FO is being coy about it
"In regards to the sideline and him not having as much fun. 

Last year, not HUGE expectations and really took the league by storm.

The thing is he lost to the titans when he did have the expectation to win. People aren't calling him a playoff winner due to the past two years. 

I just think he's taking things more serious and really wants prove the doubters wrong, again. That loss Vs KC this year didn't help either."
"But... the thing is... the 50 yard run *happened*. Like, longest of his career."
"John Harbaugh, DeCosta, and Lamar all offseason: Lamar is going to run less this year

Lamar runs less this year

Fans: üòÆü§Øü§¨üò°"
"I think they are trying to develop him more as a passer. I don't buy into the whole injury thing. Why risk your franchise QB who won the MVP at 22/23? It's not like his time is ticking we have a relatively young squad.

And in all honesty I don't think many people expect us to be winning the super bowl this year so I don't understand the reasoning to play through an injury. Not to mention the fact that we have RG3 as a back up, yh he isn't the RG3 of old but in terms of back ups that's a pretty good one to have. 

In order to get over the hump of beating the Titans and the Chiefs Lamar needs to become a better passer, so why not develop his passing? I think he knows that which is probably why he hasn't been having as much fun because rn he isn't where he wants to be as a passer. I think his mindset is now ""superbowl or bust"""
Take away all of the Steelers wins and they're winless.
"The designed runs haven‚Äôt worked since week 1. It seems like teams actually did study the film and prepared better on stopping him. Combined with the few tweaks he‚Äôs had to his lower body already. 

Which I‚Äôm kinda fine with. There‚Äôs going to be growing pains because now this is basically a new offense and that‚Äôs why his numbers aren‚Äôt great. But we‚Äôre still scoring points and winning games and there‚Äôs a lot of season left for him and the offense to get more comfortable."
Something is definitely up. You don‚Äôt go from breaking Michael Vick‚Äôs rushing record one season to being at the bottom of the league in quarterback rushing the next season out of coincidence.
Yeah I‚Äôm actually glad he‚Äôs running less cause we‚Äôve won a most of our Ws pretty easy and I don‚Äôt want Lamar running with the game in the bag. Just like I don‚Äôt want Lamar sitting in the pocket waiting for a deep route to get open when we‚Äôre winning the game by a healthy margin
They literally talked about this ad nauseam on 105.7.
Didn‚Äôt Lamar and Harbaugh say that Lamar was gonna run less this year?
"I'm not sure what's going on. I'm hoping they they just aren't looking to open the play book on should win games. The line was struggling the first few games but seemed to have it together against the Bengals, going that can set up the run game again."
"First he ran too much he‚Äôs not gonna last, now he doesn‚Äôt run enough he must be injured. I need everybody to stfu and just watch damn!"
Theres only two stats that matter. Points for and points against.
"If you remove all Lamar's long runs, he doesn't have any long runs. Are we worried about this guys?"

"Covid outbreak, the new meteor"
"Personally, I think it's a very bad look, but it's being blown out of proportion (ie r/nfl doing what it always does) Some people are even saying that they hope ""lamar gets hit hard so he learns"". In regards to the actual situation, I thought lamar was above that, hopefully he just flopped for shits and giggles and didn't think they were actually gonna penalize the defender. If he actually tried to get a penalty out of that, then he is absolutely in the wrong."
I‚Äôm not sure what the hell youre talking about...
Every team in every sport will flop and sell penalties
">  it's a very bad look, but it's being blown out of proportion 

My exact thoughts, nobody likes to see flopping in any sport, but  /r/nfl will have you believe he is single-handedly responsible for the flopping trend and the only guilty actor. 

I hate cheating in sports as it completely takes away from the point of the competition. It is bizarre though that in a sport in which PEDs are common and gamesmanship is every team's mantra that a singular incident is considered too far. 

Lamar does it again give him shit and fine him, but keep that same energy for other incidents as well."
The amount of Patriots fans acting outraged in the thread makes me chuckle a little bit.
"He just shouldn't've said anything. The problem is Lamar is so wholesome he came out and said he flopped, most athletes just leave it at that."
Receivers call for a flag literally every single time they don't catch a ball and the coverage is good. DeAndre Hopkins pushes off on CBs every time he catches a ball. People need to get over it.
I don't understand why people hate flopping so much.
"Eh receivers/DBs have gratuitously faked being interfered with since the beginning of time. Acting, playing up an offense to encourage a favorable penalty call is an integral part of all sports."
Tom Brady didn't even have to flop. If you just touched him wrong he got a bonus 15.
"Why does this sub get sooo worked up about what happens on r/nfl

Have you guys not learned already how trash it is. 

Use your own judgement. Flopping is wrong. But every team in every sport will flop or something similar to gain an advantage. It‚Äôs just part of sports these days. It‚Äôs all theatrical and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs encouraged unfortunately."
"I think there's no 'situation' lmao. Every QB in the league flops at least once per game and this has been going on for decades. It truly makes you wonder if the posters over there have ever watched Tom Brady play a game.

That's not even getting into all the WRs who start tripping over themselves if a DB lays a finger on him. This isn't some newfangled strategy the kids are trying because they watched too much basketball. It's just something that players do, have always done, and will always do."

First game in forever I‚Äôm more excited to see the defense take the field. Not even a slight on the offense I just miss our dominating defensive stands. Wentz gonna be running for his life today.

"The best part might just be the 3 players you chose: 'LaMarclon'! I also love the layout of Lamar in the middle as a QB flanked by two CBs, plus how they all come out to #8 (4 + 4 = 8 & 2 x 4 = 8). Suggestion for your next 3: Campbell in the middle flanked on either side by Stanley & Andrews, so it similarly goes offense/defense/offense. Andrews in the middle might work well too, since then it'd be Lineman/Tight End/Lineman."
"Damn , can you convert this to a modern desktop background? How would that work? Like to truly capture the vibe I feel like a pic of the monitor is the best way vs. the actual image file or whatever"

I say we get Lamar to throw as much as possible before the playoffs.
Expect another pass heavy game this week. Their backs are the worst at covering tight ends. I expect another game to try and get the passing clicking on all cylinders
Let‚Äôs get it bugged out now. If we can hang 27 points on an off day I look forward to see lamars progression. I am following bylaw number 3: protect Lamar at all costs even if it means flaming our OC.
Where‚Äôs the coaching? He‚Äôs looked bad throwing the past 4 weeks now. Why aren‚Äôt the coaches really putting him in a position to succeed like they did last year? Is it just a mental block for him? He looked so good throwing week one and he made some passes against the Texans. He‚Äôs been terrible ever since the Chiefs game though. Someone get this guy back his mojo

"I got downvoted a little bit in r/nfl for saying that while I agree flopping isn‚Äôt cool, I‚Äôve seen Mahomes and Big Ben do it. Lol."
Receivers call for a flag literally every single time they don't catch a ball and the coverage is good. DeAndre Hopkins pushes off on CBs every time he catches a ball. People need to get over it.
"Tom Brady didn't even have to flop.

If you got dirt on his uniform he got an extra 15.
This isn't news."
"Ironically the commenter with the most shit to say is actually one of our own. Anyone notice that?

Why the hell is he advocating for someone to rough up Lamar??"
That thread is a prime example of why r/NFL sucks.
"I‚Äôm not a fan of it, but unfortunately it‚Äôs a part of the game. I wish it wasn‚Äôt that way though. Players are too finesse nowadays. Half the time a WR goes deep, he‚Äôs looking for PI more than the ball üôÉ"
I criticized Mahomes for this heavily against the Patriots...I can't be a hypocrite. C'mon Lamar. In a blowout?
"Everyone does it. On all sports too. It‚Äôs part of sports these days whether that‚Äôs right or wrong. It‚Äôs theatrical. You do what you can to give your team and advantage. It is what it is. 

But Lamar is too honest. This is the second time this year he‚Äôs been to honest and too much of a nice guy in what he says. He got to reel back a bit and keep quiet."
Look at all the saints in /r/nfl pretending that their players don‚Äôt flop
Well he did say he wants to be as good as Brady some day
I still think it was a pretty dumb play by Dunlap.
Lol look at the amount of downvotes I have on that thread for simply explaining that everyone does it. It pains me to see that it‚Äôs not only r/nfl but other ravens fans that are thick as pig shit
lol
"Well, uh, I guess those penalties just got offset by the terrible calls against the other bird team, so..."
"Yeah, if he's going to do that, which I'd rather he not, I'd also he rather not talk about it. Flopping in a blowout? Dumb."

"I just want to say I found this funny. But I also want to provide some backstory. 

Apparently the real ""Santa"" was a no show (due to dubious reasons possibly contaning alcohol) for a Christmas half time thingy , and they instead got some random Eagles fan to dress up as santa and do it instead. Eagles fans threw snowballs, the fake Santa thought it was funny and played along, fun was had by all and nobody was hurt. Sidenote: the Eagles were having an atrocious season in 1968 and were in the middle of yet another bad game against the Vikings. So Eagles fans were pretty bitter and this was a good way to release some tension.



And apparently there was some battery throwing thing in the 90's. But that was a Phillies game with Phillies fans."

"This may be common knowledge already I just found out. Jamison tweeted that with the 3 picks we sent for the 32nd, they drafted Dallas Goedert, Avante Maddox, and Miles Sander. Its crazy both sides ended up winners in the trade"
"> Its crazy both sides ended up winners in the trade

That is what most good trades should be."
"I never thought to follow up on who they got, but yeah, that's a pretty good move for them.

Miles Sanders is gonna terrorize the NFC East when he stays healthy and they beef up the line a bit. Goedert is solid and Maddox is a smart player, but gets burned. If he ups his speed, he'll be dangerous. 

AND they went and got Jalen Hurts last year, who was my favorite QB in the draft. 

Fuck Philly in general, but they rocked that trade and didn't waste the picks."
"I live outside of Philly so I am friends with a ton of Eagles fans. They all enjoyed that they drafted the TE I had at the top of my board with our 52nd pick.

I'm happy with the trade though obviously, lol."
Espn just posted the KC Buffalo trade for the 10th pick and that's another one where both trades worked out fantastically for both teams
Related to Barry Sander?
"If only the Eagles could start winning some games...

Not that I care. Just saying."
Goedert has a ceiling of elite tight end he reminds me a ton of Andrews except with slightly more size and slightly less athletic.  Maddox is a ok-ish number two CB.  Miles Sanders is a versatile RB who is a great outside runner and good in the passing catching area (I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs probably top 5ish as a pass catching back).

Boykin running the wrong route? Man that never happens
You get 10 chances you're gonna score
Harbaugh is gonna need another belt because I assume he's going to wear his current one out whooping the absolute fuck out of the oline
"Remember, pats got beat by broncos, chiefs lost to raiders last week, Texans took the titans to OT, 9ers got RAN by dolphins.

I can't fucking stand those people that label fake fans as people who have legitimate valid concerns about this offense. Being a fan doesn't mean being blind to the teams issues.

This commentary is 100% better than last weeks crew
Remember when we were saying the Ravens offense looks horrendous? This is what we were worried about. You let teams hang around and now it's a one possession game with the Eagles totally in it now.
Absurd penalty
These Refs gifting this game to them
"12 penalties for 132 yards vs. 3 penalties for 20 yards...Either Philly's depth players are that much more disciplined than Bmore's starters or Shawn Smith's crew had it out for the Ravens today. Meanwhile, all day long, I saw the Eagles' linemen lining up the same way as Stanley & 'Zeus', plus committing False Starts a split-second prior to the snap, and holding galore ‚Äî yet they were rarely (if ever) called for it. The PI on Peters was egregiously erroneous, as was Ferguson's apparent ""Roughing the Passer"" penalty!"
Guys we are up 7-0 in the first quarter can we stop acting like the sky is falling just bc we had a one drive without scoring? Lol
"Lamar determined not to run, it looks like. He had an open lane there."
These tipped balls are going to become pick 6s eventually.
Apex ball hawks. Has a nice ring to it
"Campbell has absolutely earned his contract, so glad we got him"
Scariest part about this eagles team is their backup quarterback it seems
damn lamar probably be killing this D in practice then lmao

I mean honestly can we just run the RPO every play?
Humphrey is insane.
Lol. Hightower spun to avoid the punch. Totally changed his run because of the fruit punch.
"Good thing we have a bye next week, because the team needs a good shellacking"
Mental mental mental mental mental mental mental. I don't think I have ever seen us have so many mental breakdowns in a single game before.
I seriously hope John Harbaugh rips the offense a new one and doesn't give some happy happy bs talk
17-0 to this. We've gotta get better

"Defense has been pretty stout the whole game, they have spent a lot of time on the field. If the offense could have capitalized on all those punts they forced earlier then none of this would matter"
Marlon is gonna make them pay if they keep targeting him lol. Only a matter of time

Well now this is looking like shit. Offense is still looking rough. Something needs to change.
If our defense was average we would be 1-4
Lamar is clearly dealing with a knee issue he is so much slower on the edge the past few games.
Is it unpopular to think Mark Ingram is weighing the running game down?
Lmao why are the Ravens in third place on that chart?

Penalties today have been killer. Not the whole story obviously but terrible none the less.
Penalties on offense and defense have been horrible today
That was on Malik Harrison. Missed his assignment in the flat
O-Line:  wanna see me get a bunch of penalties... wanna see me do it again?
Who knew when we brought in Tucker that he‚Äôd go on to be the most accurate kicker ever?
Isn't it crazy how our offense has looked lackluster and we still scored 30?? This bye week should be good. If our offense clicks we'll be unstoppable.
Double coverage and NO ONE could knock that away?
ravens really need to look at themselves this bye week cause this aint it
"W or L Harbaugh going to rip into them after the game , completely undisciplined with these penalties"
The refs are actually fucking us. Bowser got tackled in the backfield and Fulgham started that interference.
D has been lazy these last Eagles drives.  And don't bring up 'they're tired'.  We had time of possession by over 12 minutes at the start of the 4th q.
Play like a Falcon
This is the sloppiest game we've played all year
"One team having 7x more penalty yards than the other isnt fucking normal, so frustrating"

The Bengals are putting an ass kicking on the Colts. Just to show that 27-3 games don't come easy
"Lol, that paper person ad needs to be a Super Bowl commercial xD"
Philly is booing. We are healing as a nation.
I think the biggest problem with game day threads is that fans are now used to us putting the game away as early as possible
triggered by the graphic showing browns ahead of us
That is fantastic coverage by Chris Board

I love the how on earth will we beat the Steelers comments as if Steelers didn‚Äôt play Philly extremely close.
Is anyone else hearing the air horn every time the Baltimore‚Äôs offense is about to run a play?
i can hear marlon screaming lol
Why would we call a timeout just to not do anything?
"Oh come on, that's roughing?"
What a bullshit roughing call
For those trying to blame lamar solely for these throws you need to be looking at the drops are receivers are having that one that got tipped wasnt even for the receiver who jumped up and tipped it
Dumb to take the sack there
Harbaugh should tell Lamar he gets a 2k bonus if he doesn‚Äôt side arm it for a game
Super questionable play by Lamar.
"Here we go. If our offense cant pull their shit together now, eagles have momentum. Bad place to be."
"I may be completely misremembering, but I thought there was a rule that the ball can't be fumbled forwards unless the player who fumbled recovers the ball."

Boykin not being where Lamar thought he should be. I‚Äôm shocked
Get Boykin off the field
I love how the coaches talk up Boykin because it makes them look really stupid rn
That was a fucking trip but we‚Äôre not getting any calls going our way.
Stopping them after giving them 10 plays inside the redzone is a tough ask
9 penalties for 63 yards...
WTF THEY PICKED
Marlon chill bro dont hurt yourself
Tucker CRUSHED that kick
"That was actually an ok drive, defense got rested and watered. Plus we got some points, not to hateful."
What a hold by Sam Koch
That was good from 70
"I feel like if we fix the o line, our offense is going to work a lot better"
This offense makes zero sense
Tuck is so damn good. I know we all know that and say it all the time. But damn man. He's so good
Put Ertz on ice.  Save him for when your good again.  He's too good of TE to get him killed out there today
lamar just said on the sideline. he doesn‚Äôt  have time
I can‚Äôt believe they‚Äôre letting this shitty ass team stick around
I'm over it win or lose it won't change how I feel our offense needs a huge revamp
Bruh how tf can your penalty calls be so one-sided
"All I'm asking for is a first down.  I can't believe I'm hoping for this, but come on man our O is so unsynchronized."
We need this bye week bad.  Go study the playbook and wear a fucking mask guys.
"I don't agree with the whole 'we didn't deserve to win this,' because I think we did deserve it, but this definitely was an ugly win."
"I understand we have issues on offense. Lamar is off, O-line is not really good, receivers are practically non-existent, run game has regressed a lot. Now after you read all this whining **LOOK AT THE FUCKING EAGLES. IT'S STILL FUCKING GOOD TO BE A RAVENS FAN**"
"If I marry Marlon, as is the plan, I will invite you all to the wedding."
Duver-yay
Look I just want to say this. Duvernay seems to be doing a lot more than Boykin has this season.
That double fakeout was beautiful
"Don‚Äôt be shy, come on, doubt Lamar some more. Come on, where‚Äôd ya go?"
Holy shit Lamar was slick there
Lol 2 bad runs and the sub calling for Ingram to be benched and then 2 good runs and he‚Äôs acceptable
"That was such a good drive. Utilized almost everyone, didn't abandon the run, sharp passing by Lamar. Hopefully they can keep this up for the rest of the season."
Lol.  Baker just pulled a Baker.
Eagles fans sick already
Humphrey is so good
Damn those Eagles fans look liketheyre having a *bad* time
Not good opening for Dobbins :/
[removed]
Calais Campbell should not be as great of a finesse guy at 6'8. He was in the backfield damn near instantly.
Where is you throwing Lamar
Fire Greg Roman
"If nothing else, we drafted JK as insurance for Ingram. 

So for the love of god, do not rush Ingram back in while he is hurt"
Lamar clearly not at his fastest with whatever groin/knee thing he‚Äôs suffering from but yet he‚Äôs still way faster than every other QB except maybe murray
"Classic Ravens football lmao defense elite, offense suspect. The good thing is that Lamar playing through a slump > Flacco in a slump >>>>>>> Boller in his prime üòÇ"
ravens nice af
God I love our defense. Set us up so nicely for that baby-drive and TD!
"So is our defense good enough this year to carry us?

Might just be a classic Ravens team again"
[deleted]
That ad was fucking odd
That one was on Dobbins
"EASY FIRST DOWN DOBBINS COME ON.

Edit: bailed by a penalty but come on."
Seems like Dobbins just needs to synch up with Lamar slightly more. They will get there.
"Miscommunication there. Not inaccuracy.

When you operate w/ rookies, that happens at times"
"Tucker is such a luxury, man

my heart rate didnt rise all when i saw 46 yd attempt lmao"
Wentz might die today
Wentz may legit die today JFC their line is HORRIBLE
"Calais Campell is just a large, large person."
Really appreciate Proche at PR this year. No non sense gets 5-10 yards every time. Love to see it
Campbell was a fucking steal EDC The damn GOAT
Wtf is going on with these penalties jesus
Something it‚Äôs way off with this offence. It‚Äôs just not in the same page
Fuck philly..fucking horn blowing trash
"Philly fans and being complete garbage humans, name a better combo."
That air horn cannot be allowed
Someone shove the air horn up that guys ass
"A lot of complaining. We were 1st and damn 35. Why risk INTs when we are up 17-0. Safe plays safe runs, we will have another shot.


That airhorn though, that shit is annoying."
Are they trying to pull a 2018 US on us?
"And let us say

#FUCK OFF THE FIELD"
That is a fucking HORRENDOUS call
Weak sauce call. Not mad with Calais.
That is an awful roughing the passer call holy shit.
"I'm confident out offense will be better after the bye. Historically, we're damn good after bye weeks"
"All that matters is how everybody decides to play come playoffs, don't peak too soon."
When is the last time lamar had 100+ passing yards at the half. He needs to get upto 200 yds a game. He's done well spreading the ball but our targets outside of 15 and 89 don't look like they're part of the team
Challenge Unlocked: start every offensive drive with a 1st and 15
[deleted]
Lamaybe just throw that one away
Wtf lamar. Gotta throw it away.
"JUST THROW IT AWAY Man we are playing DUMB football. All of our mistakes have been mental errors. Blown coverages, late hits, false starts, not lining up on the line."
"What the fuck is wrong with our route concepts, why are wrs all in the same spot running into each other down field. That is honestly so unacceptable, execution is one thing but scheme shouldn‚Äôt be so terrible..."
"On that replay, 2 receivers ended up in the same location with 3 Eagles. The route combos are effed up."
"Can't be mad at Elliott, just no one there to recover it for us"
"the way this sub loses its shit whenever someone scores a TD is hilarious lmfao

you guys really think this is Madden and want us winning 60-0 every week huh"
#THAT‚ÄôS MY FUCKING LLAMA
Who would've thought we'd score more if we played to our strengths? Crazy.
Lamar NEEDED that.
Marlon Humphrey is just fucking ridiculous
**FRUIT PUNCH**
Weird how they mix the fans in with the cutouts right?
Extremely high effort -3 yard rush by Lamar
Blitz that many you better get a sack or else something bad is gonna happen...
Well that was just beautiful. Mother Tucker.
Best kicker of all time
Tucker is a god. Change my mind.
"I don't think Lamar played great, but I think he did enough. This offense has been slow today due to the offensive line. Really disappointing how sloppy they've been"
"We have sucked major ass today. Once again, if we played a good team, we‚Äôd be getting blown out. Fuck people that are saying we shouldn‚Äôt be concerned."
They‚Äôre trying so hard to give this game away
Do you guys finally get why people were complaining about the offense? Relying on the defense for an entire game isn't sustainable. If the offense kept their end of the bargain this game would have been decided a long time ago .
#HARBAUGH PLEASE UNLEASH HELL ON THIS ENTIRE FUCKING TEAM AFTER THE GAME THIS IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS
That's fucking BULLSHIT they waited to see if the ball was caught before they mad ethe call and he was holding Peters jersey wow
Are we really about to blow this game
The defense has had so very little time to catch their breath the second half. The offense is killing them.
I don't remember the last time the Ravens collapsed like this
Can we talk about Calais? Please?
We beat the Refs
130 penalty yards cmon
I can‚Äôt believe the 3rd quarter isn‚Äôt over yet. This game feels like it‚Äôs been going on for years
Great Hustle Elliot love your impact since ETIII been gone!
"Those stagnant, trash drives better not come back to bite us"
This is such a classic 2013-2017 Ravens game
I‚Äôm attracted to large women
GRO play more duvernay
LAMAR!!!! That was SHARP!!!!
That was freaking beautiful
That play design looked horrible but great fucking play by lamar
That was.. insane
"Still hate the rollout to the right but...

TD!"
"**LAMAR ""THE MAGICIAN"" JACKSON!!!!!**"
Really really liked the use of Duvernay and Lamar using his legs to extend the play to Nick Boyle on the TD. Great start.
Yall edp is so mad üíÄ
O-line needs to get their heads out of their asses
Nerves: back
"To be fair, batted balls at the line were a concern for Murray coming into the league."
Great coverage by Averrett there. Pinned him to the sideline and eliminated the receivers space. Textbook
So refreshing seeing our front 7 getting after the QB. That's been mostly absent so far this season.
I see the offense still really is just shit all together. I don't care what categories we lead in it sucks.
Okay that drive fucking sucked. Two drops in a row.
Baltimore did nothing but add talent to this offense I don't understand
"without opening a new thread for this:

are you satisfied with DeShon Elliott so far?"
You love to see it. 3 straight runs with GUS
"God we suck so much, we are only up 14 points in the 1st quarter and we only have one takeaway."
Lmao this cutout bud light commercial is wack
Imagine being an eagles fan and paying out the ass to go to a game in the middle of a plague just to watch your team get dog dicked by a squad that isn‚Äôt even firing on all cylinders yet. Couldn‚Äôt be me. BIG TRUSS
What a commercial lol
"Ingram has looked old as fuck this year man

Dude is still tough as nails but hes not evading anyone"
Dobbins needs work.
"Gotta catch that.

aaaand it wouldn't have mattered anyway"
Dobbins has to catch that.
Every time they start praising Tucker I get hella nervous
"Baker is 2/7 for 23 yards, 0 TD‚Äôs, 1 pick for a TD."
It is really annoying though because that was an easy mode first down if he had just caught the ball in stride like Lamar threw it.
I hate to say it I hope I don‚Äôt sound ridiculous I don‚Äôt know who this Board man is lol
Calais a grown ass man!!
"&#x200B;

Keep sacking Wentz"
\-4 yards of offense now?
Calais just drove 2 grown ass NFL athletes back 5 yards into their own QB. Dudes a beast at like 37 years old.
a lot of people are complaining but at least we aren't the fucking eagles
Calais' sack was fucking nasty. Damn
Wasted a down on that pass.
Lamar‚Äôs fundamentals are all sorts of fucked up rn
"What is going on, man. Lamar looking like Tebow rn"
Imagine risking getting the rona just to watch your team get blown out
FUCK THIS AIRHORN
Someone please find the jabroni with the horn and shove it up their ass sideways kthx
"Throw a flag on the horn , this is bullshit"
I hate this offensive line today. I really do. Their shit discipline ruined this entire drive.
They're batting too many of Lamar's balls at the LOS
Seriously fuck that fan with the air horn
"You know I‚Äôd love if we tried to take some shots to Hollywood, you know the guy who‚Äôs been getting open on deep balls all year"
"Don't they actually have a jail cell at the Philly stadium?  Or was that the old one?  Anyway, if they do that's what they should do with the airhorn guy."
Hurts is about to be the starter
I‚Äôm scared of hurts more than wentz tbh
McPhee played his part
Damn all those next gen stats and Watson still 1-4 lmao
"Marlon, the literal light of my life"
Hurts probably would have got it.
Fuck that conservative bullshit
We certainly wouldn‚Äôt have been this scared last year. Remember the second browns game? G Ro is a straight puss.
Drop TD for a drop INT.  Fair trade I guess
How tf is that roughing the passer such a bullshit call
Incompetent refs.
......... I‚Äôll forgive you Calais. That was not RTP.
Weak penalty
"Glad they missed, that refs blunder was a disaster. Oh well, love to hear the symphony of boo‚Äôs at the Linc going into half time."
Do the refs not want to call anything on the FG try? No?
Chuck Clark robbed of an interception for the second straight week due to a penalty!
I forget that 52 yards isnt a gimme for most teams.
"Ravens 17, Eagles 0, Refs 0 at half"
[deleted]
Has Duvernay not had a good play when he touches the ball?
The Baltimore False Starts
Just fucking throw it away.
This discipline fucking sucks.
THROW IT AWAY
Nice play judon üôÑ
Judon whiff
"We fell for our own gimmick, how the fuck"
Lmao fucking absurd decision from Philly
Sanders mustve been mad lol running all those yards and not get the TD.
Gotta respect the effort from Elliot
Duvernay continues to play great
There you go. Deep passes.
Are we saving RPO for Pittsburgh
"Lamar be like, I‚Äôll do it myself"
Sins = forgiven
Damn who could have guessed RPOs work for our team
LAMAR TO THE FUCKING HOUSE!!!!!
23 straight quarters with a score now.
#CALAIS IS A GROWN ASS MAN
Calius literally looks like a man amongst children
FRUIT PUNCH
Holy fuck how does Marlon do it every time?
I love Marlon so much
"As good as our pass rush has been the last 2 weeks, matt judon has been invisible in both games. How is that even possible? This dude wants a big contract?"
The cardboard cutouts look happier than the live fans.
Our JV offense is about to be 5-1 lmao
God damn it Boykin
Boykins weekly complete fuck up right there
Boykin needs to be cut lmao
Does Boykin know the playbook?
"We all knew that was coming, can't hold em for 8 downs"
Does holding exist?
"Damn. That drive almost ended 2x (queen almost int, 4th & 10 if not for roughing the passer)"
Hope Marlon‚Äôs ok. That looked like it hurt
I can't recall many times this game where I was pissed at a playcall. Biggest issue this game has been offensive line. More negative plays than the eagle is unexcusable
Ahhh nothing better than a Tucker pallet cleanser
Death. Taxes. Justin Tucker.
How do you not call tucker the üêê
Tucker makes a 55-yarder look so easy
Tucker hit from that spot about 8 years ago as well.
"Thank god we have a bye before the Steelers. 

Really need to work in some screens/easy quick passes to take the load off the Oline. If we try all this dropback passing against their D we will struggle"
why would any eagles fan willingly come to this game
need a marcus peters or clark pick here
Any super fat dudes on here can yal block?
Anyone remember the days when Tucker was the entire offense?
Half the Eagles line false started there and it wasn‚Äôt called.
I could be 100% wrong but aren't the Eagles repeatedly committing false starts?
"okay that left tackle was a yard and an inch off the line, and you've been calling that against us all day. and also it was a false start"
"Lol, they FINALLY called holding on the Eagles. Now that didn't hurt refs, did it?"
This is why we have complained about the offense it isn‚Äôt a overreaction it‚Äôs a problem that let the eagles come back
STOP TAKING FUCKING FLAGS
I‚Äôm actually thankful our bye got moved a week earlier LOL
We're actually being robbed today. Fucking pathetic
Thats a bullshit PI call
"Good wake up call. You don't finish a team, they'll come back."
If we let them score we better fucking stop the conversion!! Fucking ridiculous
Fuck these refs
I hope the refs get poison ivy on their nuts what a bunch of horseshit calls and officiating
refs are a joke but lets be real it is the offense why we are losing. Running up the gut into Cox/their only strength on defense ALL GAME - very smart.
Guys I still Belee.
"Matt judon makes one FUCKING play 

‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs my money‚Äù"
We got bailed out by Philly‚Äôs incompetence.
A horrific play call might have just saved us.
"Well, the refs couldn't solidify the win we were trying to give them"
"Beautiful, what an ugly W. Except for Tucker - perfect as always."
Thank you Proche
It's a win. Thank God.
"Harbaugh needs to fucking lay into every single player except Tucker, Koch and Calais. Today was a fucking embarrassment on every aspect and this team is in dire need of discipline and playmaking"
"""Survive"" is definitely the right word for it"
Close game that shouldn't of been close period.
We gotta give lamar the ball more and let him do his thing. Tends to work pretty well
"The Ravens defeat the Eagles by halting a 2-point conversion attempt for the second consecutive meeting between the franchises: 2016 (27-26) & 2020 (30-28). However, both games should have been blowouts. Instead, Philly surged back with wild comebacks."
Let's not discredit the dude. That's an outstanding catch. Correct call
I‚Äôm done with the boykin experiment
fucking eagles getting bailed out by these refs
‚ÄúThe Ravens will escape‚Äù perfectly said by the announcer. We legit escaped with a W that should have been an L
This sub is so toxic it's like you guys have never seen the Ravens suck. No matter what happens you and try and pick apart the team we are up 14-0 in the first and you guys cry. I don't care about next week just enjoy the fucking game. Enjoy winning football games cause they come and go.
"1) LJ is awesome on that kind of play. His ability read leverage and make off angle throws is top of the league. 

2) it should NOT be that hard every time."
Why did they go for 2? Isn‚Äôt it a 3 score game either way?
I haven‚Äôt seen us get this fucked by the refs in a long time.
"Really hoping Lamar comes out with a chip on his shoulder this week, I‚Äôm tired of the hot takes"
"Game predictions:

-	Lamar and O gets back closer to normal
-	JK Dobbins gets 2 TDs
-	Duvernay gets his first receiving TD
-	Queen gets 2 sacks, 1 forces a fumble
-	Defense keeps dominance
-	Tucker only kicks XPs"
"About 3 weeks ago someone swapped bodies with me. I've lifted weights and ran or some other form of cardio every day. I quit vaping, I've ate well. I kind of miss being able to eat whatever and drink beer. How do I swap back"
Boykin...with a CATCH?
Wtf has GRo seen in these rollouts to keep trying them?
Greg Roman seems completely out of his depth this season...
Duvernay is such a beast
Duv getting physical.
"WHAT A PLAY, THAT'S 2019 LLAMA"
Nice play LJ
lamar saving the playcall
Boyle is jesus
"What awesome playcalling on that drive, and what execution by Lamar üëè.

THIS is what we were hoping for."
"It literally cannot be stated enough, Lamar Jackson is younger than Joe Burrows! Lamar is the only dude in the league not allowed to have off games. Bounce back time baby!!!"
That‚Äôs the best drive this team has put together this year.
#Humph
Awesome start for the Defense
Anybody watching this with Philly fan friends or family?
That was ugly.
Let Lamar cook!!!
"Sheesh these batted passes are annoying, this is how it must feel to play against the Monstars"
"Can we take a second to appreciate the all time raven starter Sam Koch, guy has been one of the best most consistent punters in the league and he eclipses Suggs for most starts in a Ravens uniform today"
Out come the cretins.....
Punt returns are so dangerous man.
"NFL really milking these commercials, wtf. That's like 5 in a row now..."
This is what bothers me. We have 2 receivers iin the same spot just 5 and 10 yards deep all the time why
Passing offense is ranked second to last in the last three weeks
4 slants on 3rd down lol
Our offense has looked like a disorganized clusterfuck since week 2. Shittsburgh is about to pound our ass into dust in 2 weeks.
"Lamar had him open, throw was a lil off"
Lol lamar needs a space of 20 yards to slow down after he runs. He‚Äôs too fast
#BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKER
"Lamar definitely looks like he's favoring something on his lower body

Edit: ""lovely me"" lol"
GUSSSS!!!! Feed him. I love his no nonsense style. Straight hammer
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE KEEP RUNNING THE BALL!!!???
Gus should be RB1
Gus and dobbins are the future at rb
**GUS BUS DRIVES IT INTO THE ENDZONE!!!!!**
Meanwhile the Bengals woke the hell up. 20-0 on the Colts
I fucking love our defense.
"Things we are still missing today: Carson Wentz interception, and a Marlon Humphrey forced fumble"
This commercial is super bowl quality
FACEMASK WTF
Can this team make a catch when it isn‚Äôt literally hitting them in the numbers besides Andrews?
Nice miss on that facemask
Remember when Romo said that Butker was the best kicker in the NFL?
nice missed face mask
These damn dropped balls man we must have the most drops in the league cuz holy fuck
Ian giving too much build up for that kick! But of course Tuck showed that he deserved it
No facemask there? Alright
Is 4-0 really the Steelers best start since 1979? That's... surprising.
Campbell is a MONSTER
Calais shoulders bout to be hurting from all those dingers he‚Äôs hitting
Campbell‚Äôs acquisition changed everything for the Ravens defence. He has been incredible and is totally dialed in.
This Defense is playing LIGHTS OUT.
"Jesus, our defense is fucking insane. It makes me so goddamn happy"
Lamar needs to chill with the sidearm throws just for the hell of it.
Something is 110% wrong with Lamar this is just bad at this point
Fuck off with that horn
Whoever in the stands has that loud ass horn needs to be removed
#Stop with the fucking horn bruh
Why does lamar continue to throw with a lower arm slot when it isn‚Äôt necessary?
Duvernay is great at getting the ball and getting upfield.
Look at phillys defense celebrating like they done something.üòÜ
"Bruh try at least one deep ball on those 3 plays, Greg is such a pussy."
Wtf is the annoying ass siren right before each ravens snap.
Lamar really needs to stop this side arm throw  crap
That political commercial was bizarre.
Browns back to being pretenders
Great responsibility by McPhee.
Eagles gotta let Hurts start
That was in triple coverage. Gotta break that up.
Steelers beating the browns down right now. Titans look really tough as well. Weird games today
Hold em to 3 max here
YOU SHALL NOT PASS
Good stand but we got lucky with that drop TD
"This will be hard to reverse if you're the refs. You can't see the ball in the scrum.

I think the play will stand."
See i think Harbs should be taking time outs and trying to put at least 3 up.
We are up by 17 but it kinda feels like our offence is not clicking that well with lamar missing throws and our run game not getting going.
Lest we go a moment without mentioning the Chiefs.
"Homecooking refs, wtf. He tripped..."
R u fucking serious
I hate these refs
Awful call
Ball don't lie!
"ball don't lie, fuck the refs"
"Positives: our defense may be the best in football. Definitely top 5 

Neutral: Offense starting the game like they did against the bengals: efficient at first but stalling out. 

Overall a very good first half."
Dear lord stop falling hollywood
Brown literally always catches and is immediately on the ground lol
Hollywood brown constantly catches and falls down
Another FALSE START? Harbaugh fuming
What kind of routes are those?
This game should both be 34-0 for the Ravens and 17-17 it feels like
Too many offensive penalties today. My guess is it has to do with the crowd noise for the first time in a while.
SCREENS üëèONLY üëè WORK üëè IF üëè THE üëè DEEP üëè PASS üëè IS üëè A üëè THREAT üëè
Man we can‚Äôt ask for a better bye week than this week. They need to seriously address the offense before our huge game against the Steelers this matchup might really decide the division. I wouldn‚Äôt be so worried but the browns can never beat the Steelers smfh
Anyone feel like we simply cannot have Lamar drop back for a normal route to develop? I believe that‚Äôs the interior O-line issue. Bleh
Judon missed a tackle. Imagine my shock
I though you couldnt fumble the ball forward? Doesnt it come back to the spot?
Why do you go for 2 there?
Decent field position.   Now go score
Well Hollywood gets so fucking open.
Lol. Announcer called that.
LAMAR JACKSON!!!! WOOOOOOOO!!!!!
#LAMAAAAAR
hot knife through butter
LaMar LoOkS sLoW
DONT GOTTA PASS WHEN U RUN LIKE THAT LMFAO
Funny how it works when we do what we did all last season
"29 straight games scoring 20+ points. We have a chance to tie the NFL record against the steelers next game, then breaking it against the colts."
LAMAR FUCKING JACKSON
"That play (calling, executing) looked like 2019 Ravens"
Don‚Äôt need him to run every play if he pops these out
Lamar I DO THIS MY FUCKING SELF THANOS Jackson!!!
Did it just get dark in Philly or is something going on with the feed...?
[deleted]
Just give Marlon the DPOY. Stop wasting everyone else's time.
Marlon ball punch is a cheatcode
Fruit Punch my man 44
Time for Roman to pass every down now
"YOU GET A FUMBLE, YOU GET A FUMBLE 

EVERYONE GETS A FUMBLE"
FALCON PUUUUUNCH!
Can we throw the ball to Proche? I just want to see what happens
Marlo is one bad motherfucker üòé
wanna see a deep ball to Hollywood
"Marlon Humphrey and forcing fumbles, name a more inconic duo."
Damn if Oline wasn't in th way Lamar would've been gone
"Judon not showing up today, shows his real worth. 
Let him go and get overpaid. 

I'd prefer to eat my words and he ball out."
Is Boykins head ever in the game?
Lmao Boykin
Boykin and Lamar not on the same page. Imagine that.
Honestly how is Boykin even employed?
Did they just try to touch my mans Koch? Ill fight them
Did Peters think he was gonna catch that? He seemed mad
When you send 6 rushers and get no pressure that‚Äôs what happens
VINTAGE jimmy Smith
"Complete bonehead penality. You get one step after the ball is thrown, and Ward took three before the hit. The ball is out, your play is over, and you give them three more shots at the end zone. Smh"
"Fucking boneheaded penalties all day long! Thanks a lot, Jihad! Eagles coming back just like last week!"
Marlon clocked his ass
Cincy was up 21-0 on the Colts. Now they're down 28-27. Yikes.
This offensive line just can‚Äôt run block as well as they did last year
Automatic
"Tucker is a beast, wish we could have killed more time on that drive though."
TUCK üñ§
What a fucking weapon. Wow.
#In Tucker We Trust
"Bless you Justin Tucker.

Also Lamar looked good on that drive, it's the fucking oline that refuses to block in either the pass or run game."
The way Justin Tucker makes me think about 55 yarders the way other teams think about 35 yarders
Have we even taken one deep shot
ALERT: Jimmy Smith is still a real good CB
#STOP GETTING PENALTIES JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
EDC gonna have to trade for an entire new O-line
I hope Harbaugh is pissed at the team this week. These penalties are ridiculous
"10 for 73 (so far) is inexcusable. 
The majority were legit penalties. 
This team needs to run extra laps or something."
"Wrap up, Patrick Queen"
"My god, this defense has to be exhausted"
UGHHHHH. THIS SHOULD NOT BE CLOSE. FUCK OFF
These refs have done everything in their power to force this into a one score game.
"STOP

FUCKING

HOLDING

My god man just one drive without a flag please"
Please trade for Julio Jones
This team isn‚Äôt beating KC or ten
"Suck my whole cock, what a bullshit call"
Fire these refs.
HORRIBLE GAME DECIDING CALL. YOU DONT CALL THAT. TERRIBLE FUCKING REFS
Refs realllly trying to give them the win
132 YARDS IN PENALTIES A JOKE
That is not dpi. That is a terrible call.
That's a fucking BULLSHIT call. Both guys are fighting for the ball.
"These officials need to read the damn rulebook, if the DB is playing the ball it's not PI"
These refs are fucked man
Gene steratore says its a bad call
"Not blaming the defence for this shitshow, they did their job all game. 

Our MVP-led offence shit the bed. Again."
I think I might vomit watching this drive
At this point just let em score
This team needs a slap in the face
There needs to be an investigation into this crew after the game. Yes we made so many mistakes but how many game deciding calls have they continually made against us??? This is ridiculous
how do we defend against referees?
Refs ride the eagles dick I swear
these refs smh my head
#Trade Judon for JJ Watt
BS call puts them 49 yards upfield. Refs are trying hard to make this happen. Just remember how great our D is. LETS GO!
"elliott dropped int. Queen dropped int. Ward roughing the passer on 4th and long. Offense constantly moving backwards due to penalties. 

smfh."
Too fucking close. I don't care if we win. We have got to be better than this shit.
JUDON MADE A PLAY
this game should've been way easier.
We're probably one of the worst 5-1 teams.
"Fuck the Refs. Fuck the offense. Fuck the second half.


But a W is a W"
"This game was fucking shameful.  Sure, the holds were mostly bullshit, in that they called that very one-sided, and the DPI was complete horseshit, but all those illegal formation and false start calls?  Harbs should be furious."
The bye week couldn't of come at a better time. We need to get our shit together if we have a chance to be a top of the AFC North
"5-1 for the first time since 2012. Both times we started 5-1, we won the Superbowl both times."
Honestly that second half too me look like a lot of unlucky bullshit that went the eagles way. Wentz tossing up prayers and they were being answered. I don‚Äôt think Lamar played terrible either. I hate that he throws sidearm but the penalties is what killed us.
So is JK dobbins starting from now on?
"Penalties 12 - 3. Fuck off, NFL."
"Can y'all shut tf up now about Lamar whenever he has a bad play, he's still Lamar."
"Imagine waiting almost an entire year, struggling through the pandemic, paying top dollar for tickets so you can finally watch this shit show with your own eyes. That's what fandom is"
Lamar should just say fuck it and start running. We need to fucking win games
Everyone who says dont act like the sky isn't falling how can you watch our offense and not be concerned as fuck
3 horrible blown coverages in 1 game. We are lucky we are playing the eagles.
Only have ourselves to blame for that TD
Terrible officiating
"We‚Äôre no where close to contending with Seattle, Kansas, or Tennessee. Changes NEED to happen both coaching and players."
Was that good enough for you r/ravens?
I fuckin hate watching refs hand teams the game. This game genuinely reeks of corruption.
Eagles DLine is legit
57 seconds two timeouts and we aren‚Äôt even going to take a shot lol stupid decision
Absolutely unacceptable from Lamar
Careful now we are  going to have people in here say you can‚Äôt complain because we are winning
I know y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt calling our defense trash. They can only carry for so long
This team should‚Äôve been put away honestly. Tf we‚Äôre letting them hang around for
"Do you realize how bad you have to be to give up these types of drives to the Eagles? A team with their TOP THREE receivers on the shelf.

Fucking revolting."
I can't believe we are 5-1 lmaooo
Low key worried about us getting gashed without Williams but regardless BIG TRUZZ LETS GOOOOOOOOOO
"*inhales*

LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!"
Had a play or two like that last week against the bengals too and teams like Kansas city MAKE those plays
Can we make duv wr 1 already ffs
I‚Äôm really liking duvernay. Looks like a steal so far!
These first 2 completions are much improved passing plays
This is the offense I‚Äôve been looking forward to
Holy shit that was some playground shit there!!
Lamar was perfect this drive.
great runs ingram
Perfect start!
NECK BOYLE
NECK BOYLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Outstanding by Boyle
Very nice play by the Llama
Can‚Äôt wait for wired this week
"The Juke Pass, gottem"
##Indefensible
#That‚Äôs My Quarterback
Lamar improv play. Only him or Mahomes consistently make plays like that
"Dobbins and Duv both with touches on the first drive. 

Greg Roman, you reading this bruh?"
So who we going for boys? Browns or Steelers I personally would like the Steelers to get smacked
The Eagles first positive yardage play ‚òπÔ∏è
"Also, how weird does it have to feel to sit next to cutouts of other fans - wonder if we‚Äôll see a classic Eagles fan fight with a cutout today."
Pittsburgh up 10--0.
We got the wet shits on First Down and I'm sick of it.
"Damn, that would have been an excellent screen to Dobbins had Josh Sweat not been right *there* with the swat. J.K. had plenty of room to work with."
"So far the playcalling hasn't made me mad. Looks creative enough, the screen wouldve been a big gain, the tipped pass on 3rd seemed like it wouldve been a easy 1st down.

OL is looking BAD though"
O-line needs to pass block better. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the comment.
"Jeez, Wentz kinda sucks."
"defense is doing it's job and doing it well, gotta get another score here"
WTF was that
That was damn near a disaster
The o line is ass tf
Can we see a replay of the play instead of a fucking Bengals touchdown? Fuck Joe Burrow
Dude what the fuck type of play call is that on third and long? Short slants? Really?
"Not good enough. Shitty throws, shitty O line play. What the fuck is going on"
Offense start doing something challenge
what is with our offense today???!
Snead was slow as hell on that route...
Takeaway streak continues!
You see chuck get up in that lineman‚Äôs face that‚Äôs like twice his size
This ravens defense wow
Boyle is getting his these last few weeks
#GUS BUS
Perfect OLine performance there.
GUS BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Lamar looked off handing that ball off... /s
What the fuck is this commercial
That commercial
"That was one of the best commercials I‚Äôve ever seen

Bud Light 10/10 commercial 2/10 beer"
Lamar pulling the Flacco staring into the void of his own soul while sitting on the bench
damn that commercial was a movie
We‚Äôre clearly the better team but we‚Äôve also gotten pretty much every lucky break
Oh yeah facemask right there lol
We can‚Äôt catch a ball anymore huh. And when we do we fumble it
I miss Yanda.
Come on man perfect pass
Anyone wanna take a guess which hole Cox just exploited. #FindABetterGuard
Missed obvious face mask
I will never get sick of watching JT kicks beauties
"If today has showed us anything outside of this game is 

1. Bengals feasting on Colts shows the Browns beating them isn‚Äôt that impressive. 

2. How did the Steelers allow their game against the eagles to become so close?

I get there is still plenty of the game left. But just some thoughts"
When did we get a pass rush üò≠
Good grief! He got bodied xD
Well the sacks keep coming and they don't stop coming
We‚Äôve lacked interior pressure for years now so this is great to see
CAMPBELL!!! AGAIN!!
"Philly has 5 yards of offense in the first half

Scratch that they really might have -2"
I'm sorry if there's any Eagles fans in here but they just look sorry as hell rn
He carried 2 grown men into that sack like they were children
KABOOM IT! Lmao I had no idea that was a real company
"LOL, and CBS was marketing Browns-Steelers as a ""matchup of two of the best teams in the AFC"""
"Okay, I love Lamar but that was the worst fucking throw of the entire season in the entire league. Holy sweet fuck."
Why is LJ throwing side arm so much?
Is Lamar‚Äôs arm okay? He seems to really favor the sidearm and dipping the elbow. He‚Äôs basically 2018 arm mechanics + 2019 vision and feet right now
Lamar has gone back on his mechanics. His footwork his arm motion
That‚Äôs the Lamar we know!
Lamar with the first down!
Nice run by Rice.... I mean Dobbins
Can they deal with that annoying ass horn please?
Well this drive is a fucking dud now
Refs are being abnormally picky about offensive linemen being too far off the line today.
How is that horn allowed in the stadium
Just fucking punt it lmao this drive is fucked
1 and 35. No problem Jk do your best ray rice impression
"Philadelphia Geese, with the fucking horn honking!"
"Something is up, there's no way he should be sidearming every other fucking throw. This is nonsensical."
Thats 3 balls batted at the line.
Offensive line is so bad
we've just given up on this drive haven't we
Are those people with the air horns the same assholes who did that at Phillies games this season?  Most Annoying shit I‚Äôve ever heard
I really don't understand the constant sidearm throwing.   Puts everything at a rising angle
Why not try some downfield thrown dammit?
I predict a Calais safety.
"Okay horn man, we get it. We know that you are there and that you know how to use the damn thing!"
"I am a Roman hater and I find it stupid people are blaming Roman for those playcalls. 

No one has a 1st and 35 playcall. At that point just try to get field position and regroup for next drive."
Philly will demand they bench Wentz now lol
"""Beautiful move!!!""  

For three yards."
eh let's hold them to 3
Can we get an interception here?
"Mayfield is 5-12, 79 YDS, 2 INT"
Jesus how do they miss that glaringly obvious hold
Remember Week 1 when we had that 99 yard TD drive to end the half and we thought this offense was good? Can we do that again please?
"What a performance from our defence today (and last week)... they deserve the half time rest. Damn, really impressive."
How do you review a play where you can't see the ball ü§£
There's nothing to review here. Stop wasting time. They won't be able to change the call because he's cradling the ball and you can't see where it is. This is not rocket science.
Damn he actually fumbles the ball on the second surge
He never reaches the ball. It‚Äôs way behind his head and shoulders.
Why were we calling timeout to stop the clock if we weren't gonna try to score?
Take some fuckin shots downfield. Why call the TO then?
It seems that guy got his horn taken away.
At least kind of try goddamn
"You see that almost interception? That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt try to give them anything, we‚Äôre up 17-0."
Mcphee trying out for Eagles WR
Roman said ‚Äúy‚Äôall niggas wanted me to run the ball right?‚Äù
Jesus christ refs fuck off with the homecooking
The eagles fucking suck lmao
Longest half ever
That seemed like a long half
The vikings are getting dicked
"Marshal Yanda hurt us alot, let's all be honest"
"Yeah imagine this being the Joe Flacco years. We'd still be up, but it'd be like 9-0"
"Offensive line is going to be running a *looooot* of sprints in practice this week

Every other play man"
Hollywood stop being a pussy it‚Äôs football
This offense pisses me off with how much better they should be
Fucking penalties kill this drive. Unbelievable dude
"I like that we win these games, bit it's just not sastifying with offense struggling like this"
Man if Judon could tackle anybody and not play flat footed he could he really good
This is why we need more now it's a 10 point game
"Elliott‚Äôs best game of his career?

Edit: given that that TD was not his fault"
Great play by Elliot. Just an unfortunate bounce. We should be more disciplined against the option.
The defense has been amazing today except for 3 plays but those 3 plays could all be touchdowns. This game could easily be 21-17 eagles if they could catch the ball.
"Good run followed by a good strip, just didn't have a guy on the spot.  Lucky TD."
Offense you gotta fucking show up for one drive please
great play from Elliott unfortunate bounce
"Nice runback there, now the Offense has GOT to put points on the board"
CBS called that!
Where are all the haters at now?
#MVP
Well that looked cathartic for Lamar
Nice run
"&#x200B;

Lamar Jackson ‚ö°‚ö°"
Good shit
YEAH LAMAR THIS IS THE MAN WE ALL KNOW AND LOVE
Can‚Äôt even give him a crease... such a cold MFer. What an explosive run and hole from the o-line. Love that guy LJ.
"Let Lamar do what he do!! Stop trying to make him be something he's not, shit. Let's go, MVP"
This is actually a highlight reel for Jackson
"MVP 

MVP 

MVP"
Lamarkable indeed.
Jackson: Fuck this wall in particular!
#LAMARVELOUS
lesssss gooo
Yes more of that.  It literally all we gotta do with this offense.
Now the d needs a pick 6
Calais Campbell is going to be Defensive player of the week for the AFC.
They have no chance against Calais LOL
Campbell has been the best offseason addition
Wentz may die today fr
Calais Campbell is a BEAST.
Bro Calais just clubbed that RG into another dimension
"campbell is having a monstrous day, what a steal for a 5th rounder"
Campbell threw that guy like a ragdoll lol
"Marlon ""I invented the concept of a fumble"" Humphrey"
[deleted]
LMAO even a failed fruit punch counts!
damn marlon almost got that
[deleted]
"Calais Campbell: Tackles 5, Sacks 3, TFL 4, QB Hits 4 
Crazy game"
"First FF from Marlon that was not returned for a TD. 

IS MARLON REGRESSING???"
"This game is basically a coin toss. Heads = ravens penalty, tails = eagles fumble"
Boykin smh
Fuck miles Boykin for real
Boykin and Lamar not on the same page? What else is fucking new üôÑ
Bro Lamar is never on the same page with boykin
Boykin... what is you doin
"Back to the limp-dicked playcalling I see!

Edit: Also Boykin ran the wrong route."
Overall this has been a fun game to watch for us
"Offense needs to help the defense out, they‚Äôre gassed"
You dumb fuck.
Jesus fuck we are playing like a bunch of idiots.
not this bs again
Dumb penalty but I low key like how nasty this D is
Discipline of this team has dropped.
Is this the ravens game with the most flags thrown on us we‚Äôre usually very disciplined. Something else to work on this bye week much needed man 3 weeks of straight ass offense
Marlon has been out of position a lot today
That would been good from 65!
Fletcher Cox is really good
This Tucker guy is pretty good.
GOATucker
Consecutive quarters with points scored streak: still alive
The greatest.
Tucker i fucking love you
tucker is automatic
I want to marry Justin Tucker.
Gus has 11 carries for 17 yards lol
"By the way, that's 24 straight quarters with a score"
Chuck Clark causes no drama......ET3 intensifies
Jimmy Smith has been so lockdown this year. You forget he's even playing at times because his guy is never targeted.
4 penalties for Stanley alone
I rarely see illegal formation and now it‚Äôs every fucking play
"I never thought I'd be frustrated at a Ravens team that scored 30 in a game, but here we are"
"i don't know what's more embarrassing, losing to the falcons 40-15 or blowing a 21 point lead to the colts"
I wanted Falcons to lose so Julio asks for a trade lol.
Damn. Imagine being an Eagles fan right now though.
lol nice tackle queen
Bowser is going to get paid somewhere else as is tradition.
Ed reed would never
That‚Äôs good old Dean Pees 4th down defense
"How the fuck do you let that happen, holy shit"
Marlon is just mauling whoever has the ball
Never should have been in this position if the offense played better
2 all pro corners and they couldn‚Äôt knock down a floater. Fucking garbage
Holy shit that was lazy
Wake the eff up D
This game is way too close for what it should've been. Horrible 2nd half
No guys the offense isn't that bad you're all just whiners /s
I‚Äôm gonna fucking throw up
"The fuck is our offence doing, trying to give the game away?"
"11 fucking penalties today, did we sign Michael Orr last night?! I must have missed the signing"
Wtf happened to our team bruh? You can‚Äôt tell me the loss of Yanda and Hurst caused this much of a decline
Fire Marty
I thought the fire Roman people were overreacting but goddamn our offense is one of the worst in the league
Yo these refs have to be questioned this is insane
What the fuck
HOW TF is that PI?!?!?!
"Lol don't call the hold, but call that awful PI"
Deadass I'm going to the FBI website and dropping a tip.
132 penalty yards. Absolutely inexcusble.
That‚Äôs gotta be a fucking joke
Are you fucking kidding me? Oh my god what a bullshit call.
That is fucking unreal.
This game feels like a carbon copy of the Bills game last year
Full collapse on both sides of the ball.
The refs just don't want me to sleep huh?
This is a very long game
"Terrible offensive line, receivers can‚Äôt separate, no edge rush, awful play calling. 

This team is winning a Super Bowl?"
i popped in the /r/nfl game thread quick and regretted it right away
"Blatant false start, no flag. I guess the refs cant see green"
Refs can't execute for them.  Fuck em.
"any ordinary worker gets fired after a performance this atrocious, these refs need to be looked into"
That onside kick Proche catch could legit be play of the game
Team better be running suicides all wrek
Proche/Duvernay/Campbell for player of the game
Too close for comfort.
"Good, felt one of the runs had to be designed Lamar run"
Lamar I know you wanted the score. Please slide next time tho. We win now
"Harbs just told Judon ""we trading your ass"""
We need to give up a 5th rounder for a starting guard.
I thought lamar was crawling bc he was hurt
last quarter was 22-6.......
I honestly don't mind all the flags but when there is zero consistency in the calls ie. a hold for us but not a hold for them... that's when I lose my shit.
We need this bye week because this game was way too sloppy and our offense has not looked good at all this season. We scored 30 largely because of the defense getting us great field positioning
There‚Äôs no reason why this game shouldn‚Äôt be a blowout.
For anyone who wasn't around for the back end of the Flacco Era. Welcome.
Madden curse
The rumours of Lamar's demise have been greatly exaggerated.
Lamar dont throw the angry ball at the autism foundation sign bro
Shit happens our defense has been on the field so much today. Offense needs to put the nail in the coffin right here
"Honestly, beyond the Offense looking like shit, the fucking undisciplined penalties today are unacceptable. Usually Harbaugh doesn't let that shit happen"
"The offense as a whole, especially Lamar is playing pretty good. It's just the fucking O line, seriously that's it. Lamar was sacked three fucking times today too."
Some fucking scrub MOSSed our ALL PRO DBs smh.
Jesus christ everything going for them. I still can't get over 3 forced fumbles and they got lucky on all of them.
Giants fan here. Please win. We want to take the division with 5 wins
Do I love this team? Yes!!are we as good as we think? No
Guys Baker was pulled because he's hurt and playing bad. They didn't just bench him on play alone.
"For all these new ravens fans to be happy the ravens have to:

* Score every Drive
* let up 0 TDs
* Lamar needs a perfect passer rating every week
* 250 yards rushing every week 
* 500 yards passing every week"
This o line really sucks
Greg Roman is actually slow
Has anyone else been so disappointed in consecutive weeks with consecutive 17-0 halftime leads? We are beyond spoilt as fans and beyond spoilt by the defense.
Imagine if we had this defense with our offense that we had last year.
Boykin has shown me enough
Remember owning teams in TOP? I memba.
only people playing worse than the team are the refs
We‚Äôre not beating Pittsburgh
"They blew a lead to the 1-3-1 bullshit NFC East Eagles. 

And you all think the offense is fine."
"God I hope we win this one. I fucking HATE the eagles. This may be sacrilege, but I may hate them even more than the Steelers"
Predicting queen gets his first pick this week
Run. The damn. Ball.
Damn bruh why does the Steelers and browns game have to go on at the same time the ravens  play. They should have scheduled that game for an early afternoon game it‚Äôs going to be a good game. Hopefully they tie
Im watching on a stream so im behind. So yall are going to see me react to plays late lol
Ingram is so much slower than Gus or jk
Ingram missed a HUGE hole there
Horrible play call by Wink. Why rush secondary when they‚Äôre that backed up?
Get Ingram off the field
Lamar and Boykin fixed. We are never losing a game again. Nice try NFL.
"plz remove the rollout to the right from the playbook.

plz"
Damn Duvernay is fast!
Run behind Stanley!
"If we can take some of the coverage off of Andrews and Hollywood, dangerous."
nice duvernay
Seriously. Why are we rolling out almost every playaction pass?
FEED DUV
"This is just the type of drive we‚Äôre used to. Not big chunk gains every play, but one that chips down the field. You love to see it."
The juke-throw TD!  Sweet.
What play by Lamar
BOYLE!!!
Duv going to end up being our #1
LMAO FRUSTRATING AS HELL FOR 55
I‚Äôm tuning in a tad late but caught that they were showing a replay of Duvernay with the ball. Did he have a good play?
Fucking LOL
OHHH TD!! WHAT A PLAY LAMAR
Fuck that was nifty
TOUCHDOWN RAVENS
FULL BOYLE
"STOP THESE ROLLOUTS EVERY FUCKING PA PASS!!!!!! I am screaming at my tv like a lunatic. 


Good shit Lamar. Nice catch and TD celebration, Boyle."
Lamar‚Äôs looking 100% today
A lil shake n bake baby that‚Äôs all we need
"That gave me an erection

Edit: autocorrect"
Literally just some madden 07 Mike Vick bullshit out here. So fun to watch.
this is revenge for losing to the steelers
D looking stout first 2 drives
Okay that‚Äôs the 3rd time it hasn‚Äôt worked Roman maybe call a different run play
"Yanda was so huge for us haha. Need Tyre to figure out pass blocking, or give Fluke a chance"
goddamn I hate this o-line
We might need to leave Tyre on the bench. Powers and Mekari played well last week.
Crazy that the last game suggs played for us gave him the franchise record for games played
Avertt was in good coverage too!
Oh fuck that sucks I hope he's good
I can hear Humphrey yelling lol
dalton winning the nfc east
"i love dogs, but that tongue flapping lapping dog commercial is extremely annoying"
"Damn, he nicked his head off of Proche weird. Hope he‚Äôs okay."
So the d line seems to be doing good finally.
Duvernay is lucky he didn't get flagged there.
Uh oh
Ingram limping a little?
I love dobbins get touches but where the hell is Gus at?
I'm wondering if that ball was intended for Mark Andrews. It's weird that they were so close to each other there
Sigh. I'm calling Buttergate. Eagles buttered the balls during pre-game. Receivers can't seem to catch. Although the one to Snead was a bit off-target.
Lamar not looking hot today
"Last year in these shitty pass plays Lamar would just run for a first when they busted. This year he looks determined to be a passer and stick with the plays, the problem is that Romans plays are so bad that it was genuinely better for Lamar to just take off last year"
We can't get in 3rd and long all the time with our offense.
Roman is infuriating
Lol our passing game would be statistically dead last if it wasn't for the Jets! Sad..
"we need to go back to those 2 TE sets, our play calling has been shit so far"
Clear fumble lol wtf are these announcers looking at
let‚Äôs fucking go 19 straight games with a turnover
Defense cannot stop forcing fumbles
elliot's moving it before the knee goes down
Nick Boyle the new WR1?
you guys think Marlo had a TED Talk on stripping footballs last week??
Wow Lamar ran
That was a bullet
Yeah.. Lamar is definitely not 100% based on what I saw on that scramble.
"Lol, the Bus got creamed and still moved forward xD"
Alright fuck it we'll win the SB with our historic defense
YEAHHHHH GUS BUSSSSS
gus busssss
THA WHEELS ON THA BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND
14-0 and haven't even played that well! Love this team even in it's hiccups!
The NFC East tastes delicious
Lamar walking weird
Lamar running the football really changes the way coverage is played by the defense. It makes him special and using it gives him a better chance to be a better passer
"Lol, look how effective the Raven's running game is when Roman calls simple, run plays. It's astounding."
Guys. Bozeman was drafted in 2018 with Lamar and the guys. We need to extend him now. Before his 4th year. He is sooo fucking solid. Remember the Hurst/Alex Lewis rotation??? Give that man a contract.
Sometimes I feel we‚Äôre just looking shitty on offense because we are trying new shit out and saving real shit for when we need to actually score
"Funny how ""bad"" teams look like trash against us and rob our wins of any respect. Look at the Bengals crushing the Colts. The 4-1 Browns (they are trash of course though)."
Lmfao browns losing. Time for them to come back to earth ‚Äúplayoffs here we come‚Äù after beating the cowboys Bengals and Colts üòÇüòÇ
"Re: Bud Light commercial. 

Uhhhh. 
That was strange."
That commercial is hilarious
What the actual fuck are the Eagles doing
"Everyone needs to chill tf out.

Two things can be true at once: offense needs some time to work out kinks and were also still dominating and stacking wins. I swear some people think if we don‚Äôt score every possession everything needs to be changed."
"Wentz is so bad, lol. Where tf was he going even?"
‚ÄúCUT TO THE OUTSIDE DAMNIT‚Äù is something I say to a professional athlete while sitting on the couch knowing full well I couldn‚Äôt outrun a moderately fast college flag football intramural player.
"C'mon guys.  WR, RB, TE all have issues catching the ball this year."
Wtf where's that facemask?
Two penalties from our star Olineman... come on now
"While it was coming back anyways, brutal drop from Dobbins but a nice drive for our offence to get us in there."
We cant be asking our LG to reach to Cox on the opposite side.
"damn, i never realized how big of an impact yanda had"
"That incompletion for dobbins is the result of the abridged off-season/no preseason. If he and Lamar are a little more in-aync, that's a first down.

Ten weeks from now at the end of the season, that's complete 11/10 times."
"Wanns now how manny fantasy points baker has right now? 
-0,58üòÇ"
I just want some 7 foot tall mfer that'll catch everything in a 2 mile radius man
Browns down by 17.   There goes their Super Bowl run.
Fuck the Steelers
"> Browns best start since 1994 

San Diego Browns inaugural 2022 season confirmed"
Nice to see Board make a play
Defence shut out the bungles who are blowing out the ‚Äúbest defence‚Äù colts
Chris Board showing up
"Ok, I will say our defense is looking bomb"
The Monstars
Campbell ain't playing around with that road to 100 sacks. He'd get them all today if he had the opportunities
I love seeing great coverage from LBs
Bro I love Calais.
Campbell is a fuckin tank
"Calais Campbell for a 5th, god who is letting EDC do this"
Board looked nice in coverage. Hopefully something to build on
"Lol, I gotta ask, who made the Bungles so angry? xD"
"Are the Bengals and Eagles lines really bad, or did our D line suddenly get way better the last two weeks?"
Wentz has negative yards now lmao
Way-too-early game ball to Calais Campbell. What a start to the game he's had today!
I like Proche as a PR. He‚Äôll probably never break a long one but he‚Äôs got good hands and always goes forward
Lamar‚Äôs passing is atrocious
At what point is Lamar's accuracy a concern this year?
"I get why folks are frustrated. The ravens are not perfect and the offense could/should play better. And yet we are 4-1, have the second best super bowl odds (behind kc), and are first in dvoa. I get why it's frustrating (with last year's offense and this year's defense the ravens would legit be playing like one of the best teams of all time) but the fact is the ravens have been playing like a very good team even if it seems like they could be better. I think that's reason for optimism tbh. If the offense that returned basically everyone from last year gets back to where it was, this season is going to be pretty fun."
LJ needs to hit these. Full stop.
WTF is up with Lama
LOL LAMAR JESUS
Bring back 2019 passing Lamar
Geez Lamar. That was ugly.
lamar :( it's ok bby
Wtf is happening to Lamar
that was a 2018 Lamar pass
That's my Llama making it happen
wtf to the guy with the air horn
I was today years old when I found out I can‚Äôt handle Lamar doing front flips. That shit was worse then a joe flacco nail biter check down game
I feel like I've seen more illegal formation penalties in this game than I have in my entire life
Thank god for the bye week after this.
What's with all these Illegal formation penalties?
I feel like there‚Äôs been a ridiculous amount of illegal formation penalties this game on both teams?
This offensive line is a fucking joke
"Now does this mean they will start calling holding on the Eagles, too?  Because it has been constant.  Just asking....."
the browns r down 24/0 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
You have got to at least attempt to go deep.
promising drive killed by penalties
Someone needs to eat that horn.
Lamar chill with all the sidearm bullshit FIRE THAT BITCH IN THERE CMON
Security will eventually find the horn guy.   They can't let that go on.
"JALEN HURTS, THREE YARD GAIN AHHHHH"
Hurts plays like he's Murray!
Nice read my Pernell
Let's just run every gimmick
Don't worry Wentz will fuck this up.
Not a catch
Not a catch
0% chance that‚Äôs complete
Great play but also a whole lot of luck lol
"So block in the back only applies to us, got it lol"
"Lowkey our secondary has been getting away with receivers getting open bc they're dropping balls this game. They need to play better, especially since better teams would not make the mistakes that Philly is making."
"Falcons are up 20, you know what that means"
"Just wondering, did some of you expect that the defense should hold them to negative yards all game? They‚Äôre going to play football back."
Big D.
"God damn the bengals are eating up the colts D 

Meanwhile Kirk cousins threw 2 INTs against the worst defense in the league"
The defense on fourth down is *chefs kiss*
"They keep saying the 'second leap' but the football doesn't make it, only his head lmao"
"We all knew the D would be pretty solid this year but it's a surprise, to me at least, they're overshadowing the O as big as they are."
Not bad w/out BWill
Why cant we just go for it???  We get the ball back
Now was the time to pass more and we don‚Äôt?
Bs call
Weak ass call
For WHAT???
Did Clark scoop that up man that's 2 picks clark has had taken away
Horrible RTP call
Eagles kicker didn‚Äôt agree with the call either lol
BHAHAHAHAHHAHAH
What a horrible roughing call. That's just football. Go ahead and just baby quarterbacks.
These refs are calling everything on the Ravens...
That‚Äôs the weakest shit I‚Äôve ever seen
jesus so fucking soft
Thank god he missed I would've been mad lol
BALL DON'T LIE
Terrible call wtf
Bullshit ass call
They miss anyway lol
[deleted]
Lot of bad play all over 1pm games today
That steelers/titans game will be huge next weekend
Lamar bless
"Oh yea,  love me some Lamar Jackson"
OLine is getting penalties but no push.
These procedural penalties are awful
Bradley 'Oher' Bozeman.
Good shit happens when Duv is in
FREE DUVERNAY
Duvernay should never be on the sideline. Sign my petition here
Stay up Marquise and that‚Äôs a big gain. Maybe even a touchdown
Duv = WR1
ANOTHER procedural penalty. These guys need this bye week to focus up
The fuck was that lamar
The entire offensive line needs to be running laps in practice. One for every technical penalty yard.
Make them practice every day during the bye. Jesus.
Lamar tf are you doing
"Out of field goal range? Excuse me, we have a Justin kicker."
Passing offense definitely deserves that second to last spot
We need a star wr that can get open.
Good looking drive up until the end there
Those routes were pretty abysmal
"Another week vs suspect defense (LBs/secondary weak) and we can't get the offense going. Going against PIT, IND, NE, TEN after the bye going to be a very rude awakening for the offense."
Elliot made a great play just unfortunate luck.
Alright let's put up 7 of our own then
You can only diarrhea for so long on offense.
Why go for 2?
The offense needs to actually do something now
Wow unlucky....I saw that fumble coming too
"What the fuck was that, absolutely bizarre TD"
"This is probably the worst I have seen this team in terms of mental focus in a very, very long time. It's a tough season but man if Harbs can't get them on track in that arena I'm concerned. 

Need this cleaned up by next week or it will be an embarrassment. Looks like we could've really used the bye next week."
Our run defense has been shockingly good considering no B Will or Wolfe
That was another crap throw by Lamar. Low in a wide open Dobbins.
Too many takes in here that are FUCKIN EMBARRASSING!
Why don‚Äôt we run RPO anymore...
Marquise needs to learn how to run with the football
Finally!!!
Gone lol
There we go
PUT SOME RESPECT ON HIS NAME
"I love seeing Duvernay return.  He's so explosive, he will definitely have multiple return TD's this year."
LLAMA
Mentally strong drive there. Didn‚Äôt let Philly build any momentum. Well done
Everyone is happy again yay
YES LAMAR THAT'S WHAT WE NEED
"Teams have been overplaying lamar's outside runs all year.

The middle runs and runs opposite lamar's momentum are wide open."
LAMAR WHEELS üí®
"Well done Roman, lol"
"Hahaha his last TD run almost got ruined by early celebration, but he couldn‚Äôt help himself here. 

Atleast he did a double take to make sure he was in the clear"
Way to answer back üëèüëè
Well...that was a nice response lol
Anyone else catch Charles Davis pulling a Romo?
Campbell breakout game!
Campbell with 3 sacks!!
He just threw a 300 pound grown man
Is that 3 for Calais?
Marlon forced another fumble!! Peanut tillman jr!
Holding against Campbell but it‚Äôs aight
"Some mark andrews garbage time fantasy points, and im a happy man"
lmao Marlon
That technique by Marlon is so clean. Reminds of DBZ when they would learn new powers lmaooo
FRUIT PUNCHHHHHH!!!!
"Drew Lock is 9/20 and the Broncos are STILL beating the Pats IN New England 18-3.

BB & TB may not want to admit, but each was a big part of the other's success."
 Campbell for player of the game
Fruit punch got my dick hard
Is it a specific instruction to not throw it away?
That‚Äôs the best loss of 2 I‚Äôve seen today lol
Lol WR not on the same page I didn't even need to see the number to know it was Boykin
Another miscommunication with Boykin
I see why they don‚Äôt draw plays up for Boykin
Lamar has got to throw shit away instead of taking a  loss when he's scrambling out of pocket.
"Alright, it's either Lamar or Boykin not watching film or studying the plays because this is 3 games in a row now that they are in different dimensions"
Watching Marlon punch the ball out makes me think it hurts like hell when he misses and you take a haymaker to the ribs
Fuckers tryna hit sam koch we riot
I always thought that was an automatic first down
"Dude, shut the fuck up.

How does Koch ""sell it"" by trying to spin OUT of the contact? Stop inventing narratives."
M&T not even based in Baltimore smh
good no call. Hightower pushes off as well
Can‚Äôt wait for this bye week guys no stress over this team for a week üòÖ but then we play the Steelers
super bowl 47 hero jimmy smith
Haven't heard queen name much today.  Glad he showing u now
I think judon gets half his stats from hitting the QB a full second after they throw the ball.
Come on fucking idiot
Come the fuck on
Sit Ward. Dumb fucker.
What the hell.  Completely stupid play.
"Yea, you know that was coming. It's not 2008."
Penalties killing us man...
What a dumb fucking penalty
I hate these flags man
Offense can put this away
ICYMI the Bengals and Titans just blew big leads against the Colts and Texans
We need a classic Ravens 9 min offense drive.
Is Hump ok?
"Shorten this 4th Q up, score at least once more and get the fuck out of here"
"Yo, Nick Boyle's having a big day!"
"Yo refs, can we get a late hit? I mean it'd only make sense..."
IOL getting blown up
Gus Edward's who always seems to get a couple yards or at least back to the LOS has been dropped for a loss like 5 times today
#BASED TUCK
Good from 60+
In range as soon as he's in the parking lot
For the love of god just score a TD so we can get tf outta here...
C'mon dawg give the defense a fuckin breather
GOAT and it ain‚Äôt close
Best kicker in the league
GOAT
Yo Tucker's so reliable. He's more reliable than grass being green.
Mother Tucker
tuck my boy you did it again
Jeeezuz what a kick ahhh remember when we were winning games with tuck and our defense... good times
[deleted]
Let it not be a secret to anyone that I love Justin Tucker
[tucker rn](https://giphy.com/gifs/goat-XKYjR0Hsjh5cs)
Au-tuck-matic. He was even smiling like ‚Äúyeah I know‚Äù
This would be the ravens' first win at the linc in the harbaugh era if it happens.
Thanks Texans ‚úåüèΩ
Let‚Äôs get a golf clap for Jimmy Smith today. He‚Äôs been amazing.
just a quick question did we draft jk to just sit on the sideline?
IlLeGaL fOrmATion
Lmao how many times did the chiefs OL do that to us without a penalty
These illegal formation penalties are ridiculous
LINE IS IN YOUR NAME!!! HOW DO YOU KEEP GETTING ILLEGAL FORMATIONS??!?!?!?!?!?
Tucker hits everything
I love our D
Judon punching air on the sideline seeing that unblocked sack
Fuck Tennessee
"For what it's worth, I think Roman's playcalling has looked better and slightly more creative than last week."
Man Wentz has been hit hard all day and keeps fighting. Respect
"I respect Carson Wentz, dude has balls of steel"
#THE KILLING JOKE
"Our D man, its unreal"
Not an interception. Still love the Joker's hustle though.
How much money do these refs have on this game? Worst refereeing I've seen in my life.
How lol
"How does that completion happen with Marlon *and* Peters there

Come on man"
Both of our all pro corners on him...
Oh fuck off man lol
We're trying to blow this aren't we
Did we practise at all this week?
Eagles blatantly holding since the refs wont call holding lol
"Wow, this game should have been over a long time ago. Embarrassing that we have just let them hang around. Will be such a failure if we give it away."
Peters misplayed that. He was there but he didn't time the jump.
Imagine if even one of the 2 TD‚Äôs that eagles receivers dropped was actually caught? Bad offense by the eagles has helped us a lot today.
Dude nothing is working for us offensively
I'm legit annoyed
"# IF WE DON'T EAT THE CLOCK HERE, SO HELP ME GOD"
Holding. Again
And a fucking penalty
Seriously need to let the O-line walk back home after this game.
Did the refs bet on how long this game was going to last?
"Refs are a joke, 20/20 vision on our team but actin like stevie wonder when Eagles are holding tackling are rushers to the ground"
27 seconds of offense. What a joke.
greg roman needs to go. straight the fuck up
Absolutely bs call.   They were both fighting for it
This is one of the most embarrassing performances you'll ever see.
"We've given them almost as many yards in flags as Wentz has throwing

Fucking hell man"
132 penalty yards in this game
Fuck these fucking refs. Fuck THEM!
132 yards in penalities lol
I am so fucking angry right now
"When we had Yanda and a mauling offensive line, Roman was fine. But now we don‚Äôt have that much push and we NEED to develop our WRs and their routes thru play calling."
end this shit
Remember when we had that big lead?
Shiting the bed here.  Best chance is to stop the 2pt conversion if they score.
Playing against practice squad players all over the board
O-line rly screwed the pooch in this game with All those flags
62 with the hold
Wr will be wide open for the 2pt conversion
Still a chance for skura to get a offensive holding penalty
I don't even understand how we got into this situation... This should've been an easy W
30-14 is the new 28-3.
Ah classic Ravens football
"This should open the eyes of all the morons saying ""relax Ravens are blowing teams out"""
"We stopped them, where‚Äôs the flag?"
Taco Bell
An obvious uncalled False start too. Worked out but terrible
Incredible no call on that false start lmao
"Even if we win, this feels like a loss. I hope the team views it the same way."
"Wow, we do not deserve this win. I really hope the offensive line is chewed out in practice. Can't fault the defense too much I feel, they were given no rest in the fourth quarter.

Edit - Spelling"
"Despite our issues today, our special teams continues to excel"
Talk about an escape
I am dead
"Jackson scared me like fuck there.  When he got up, he kept his arm right on his body like he hurt it and I got spooked."
"We escape with the win, lots to work on over the bye"
kick a fg to rub it in the ref's faces
We need these types of games. A lot to learn from and motivation to get better. Can‚Äôt blow people out every game in the NFL. GG
"Pure fucking luck, I just hope they were using these last 3 games to develop Lamar cause if this is us against the Steelers, we‚Äôre getting fucked"
Steelers game going to be a slug fest. And hopefully a chance to prove we can be better than good teams.
U G L Y
"Obviously not a great game, and a LOT to be addressed. But if we can still win while the other team gets a ludicrous amount of lucky bounces AND officiating help? I'll take it."
This sub is starting to make sense to me as if the very same sub that wants Greg a Roman fired wants Jalen Hurts to start after one play lol
Every route was in front of the sticks. Wtf
Lamar's sidearm passes are very hit & miss. Just use regular motion. Give the receivers a chance...
Ngl Joe Biden‚Äôs ads go kinda hard
"No confidence is the offense

2 minute drill with Two timeouts and you call 3 runs back to back. Sad"
the fact that we‚Äôre that upset about being up 17-0 instead of 24/20-0 shows how far we‚Äôve came since the flacco days
"That drive, minus that tarded swing pass to RB to start, was why we were so good last year. Run run and run"
"You would think this is Pittsburgh sub as much as everyone talks em up. Fuck the Steelers, I don‚Äôt care if we are 0-15, I refuse to talk them up."
I think a lot of people are ascribing problems to the offense as a whole that can actually be explained by simply poor line play. The O has actually been quite good today imo without the penalties. Yes I understand that penalties are still part of the offense but the point is that in theory a good team will clean that up in the time between week 6 and the playoffs. I'm feeling pretty good today
I only hope we lose to force the FO to make a move
"Getting a bad loss to the Eagles here might actually shake things up.

This team, barring a tremendous meltdown will make the playoffs but I have zero faith they‚Äôll be able to do anything except get bounced early again."
Man.. I liked this sub a lot more before we signed Lamar I swear 90% of you are just reactionary babies .it legit feels like most of you aren't even watching the game just complaining
"This offense is just not good enough right now. Period.

You are 100% kidding yourself if you think THIS offense is enough to win against a slew of good teams en route to winning a Lombardi. The defense and special teams are great. Those units are good enough. The offense is not.

In r/nfl today all I heard was how Andrews was gonna feast because Gerry is shit. Where is Andrews? Meanwhile Lamar is sidearming everything, the line is brainfarting on simple fucking procedure every other play, there is no run game, receivers can't get separation, and Lamar just gave up an unnecessary sack to lose us points. This is not good enough, period."
A lot of y‚Äôall are super fair weather. Everybody saying ‚ÄúLamar needs to be benched‚Äù or ‚Äúmadden curse‚Äù needs to take a good step back and stop watching this game
"This side arm nonsense needs to stop. His decision making is back on point tho. This week off is important. If Lamar gets back to week 1 form, we best team in the league. No cap."
I feel like watching a game from late Flacco era again
"I hate to say it, but no way we beat Pittsburgh only scoring 24. Really hope we clean up the offense on the practice field this week."
"I really, really want to believe in this team, but we look like paper tigers at the moment."
"bruh, that looked like a pass from Jackson's rookie season"
One thing Lamar can definitely improve is his body language when things aren't going well.
These last few games make me nervous for Pittsburgh.
If we lose to Hurts I swear to god
Lol.  When we want them to throw.  Greg Roman chooses to run....  is he toying with us?
Man last year we would have tried to get a TD with less than a minute left lol
"Everyone is so mad we didn‚Äôt try to score. We‚Äôre learning from last year and not blowing our load in the regular season. Jesus Christ, sorry we‚Äôre only up 17 points on the road with a team that actually is allowed fucking fans"
"Feel like Lamar got lazy on his technique that made him so efficient last year. Keeps throwing sidearm and not stepping into his throws, hes right on the money when he does. Could also be the O-Line regression"
"i get that i am a part of the problem, but i turned that am to a was, not every game is going to be 50-10. we are lucky to have a great team, but cmon yall were are pitching a shutout right now and we pitched a sort of shutout last week."
But are we ever outta FG range üòè
I hate our inability to get separation so fucking much Jesus Christ.
"This team‚Äôs going to look like shit against good teams, our schedule coming up is going to be brutal for us"
Wasnt there a rule that you cant fumble forward into the endzone
Some of you guys have never experienced the heart attack flacco era of winning/losing games in the last minute.  We aren‚Äôt going to put up 40+ each game.  Lamar is human
Some of y‚Äôall need to understand the offense has looked like trash the past couple weeks and saying it looks bad isn‚Äôt being toxic
Game should be a lot more one sided than this. Offense has a lot of work to do during the bye week
"Lots of missed offensive opportunities. Feel like we should have 50 on the scoreboard right now. 

Thank God we‚Äôre headed into a bye week. Pop the offense up on those jacks and change the oil"
[deleted]
"offense killed 19 seconds of clock and yall blaming the Defense

these motherfuckers are tired. Lamar cant pass and we cant run on em"
This could easily be the biggest choke of the last several years.
We have given up a more than the field in penalities it's hard to close the game when you are so undisciplined
I had this dream that Tucker was about to kick the game winning field goal and then Harbaugh blocked it with an iPad
Why do the announcers fixate on the NFC East?  They all suck.
Prediction- Boykin or Duvernay has a big game. Coaches are looking for one of them to step up and be a difference maker. Today‚Äôs the day that one does.
I'm gonna need at least 1 receiver to get 100 yards today. And Duvernay needs to be incorporated more.
Prediction: Our announcer today will know who our QB is.
Biggest concern I have today is the run D without Brandon Williams. Ravens give up 160 yards on the ground a game without him on the field.
This is Lamar's rebound week. I belee
Who do we want to win browns/steelers?
"Fly Ravens fly, on the road to victory üé∂ on the road to victory, fly ravens fly, score a touchdown 1 2 3 (1,2,3!) 

Hit em low

Hit em high

And watch our Ravens fly! 

Fly Ravens fly, on the road to victory! 

R A V E N S Ravens!"
Calais is a beast
Marcus Peters wtf was that üòÇ
That was a TD
"Yes Wink, bringing 6 on 3rd & 22 makes a ton of sense!"
"Peters blew that one, but holy shit how fast is Jimmy Smith still"
Greg wtf was that?
That was tentative as fuck Ingram
Does Jackson seem slower? Or am I crazy?
Those naked bootlegs aren't fooling anyone this year.
3rd & 10 is my best friend now
duv needs to be moved to at least wr 2
Duvernay is not afraid of contact.
"Boyle is Roilin""!"
Boyle me TIMBERS
That was sneaky
Also great play for the TD
What a play! Improvising our way to 6. I'll take it
"God I fucking love Lamar

Anyone know what rap song that was when CBS was going into break?"
Tucker with that big kick energy!
I hate it when Greg takes away half the field with his playcalling. We got lucky bcos of Lamars talent there.
I'm a couple of plays late; but Devin Duvernay is going to be a Y.A.C. machine for years to come in due time.
Whoa that half record
"You can still be a sloppy scorer. While our offense is scoring, something does seem different."
"If we could stop those Lamar rollouts, that‚Äôd be great. Those have been going for 1 or 2 yards each time"
This pass rush though
Damn 57 yards for Koch on his longest game as a Raven üò§
Let Lamar run it. Bring back 2019.
Cox and Graham are still pretty good man everyone hates on the eagles but those guys have been good for a while. They need more playmakers tho
I say it every week and will keep doing so  we need to find a better replacement for Yanda. Our oline is clearly hurting and its constantly being proven. Fuck another receiver. Fuck another pass rusher. If we trade for anyone. It needs to be a solid guard.
Random thought: It's a good thing Zach Ertz's parents never named him Richard.
Damn hope that dude is ok
Averret has looked good so far
And here come the boos
He did that to his self.
That doesn't look good :( you hate to see that happen to anyone
That was brutal
It's hard to see how he got hurt from that. Hope he's ok
"High speed collision head on.  Dangerous stuff.  I hope that guy is ok.  But it seems to be that, as bad as it looks, the guy who gets flipped end-for-end is usually not the guy who gets hurt in that situation."
"Idk how people constantly talk about how lamar is gonna get injured for his style of play when they never talk about Wentz - he runs quite a bit too, is made of glass, and gets hit on every play"
Ugh.
Everythings getting deflected
Why is Lamar so hesitant to take off? He could have run for the first down already a couple times this game.
Just because we‚Äôre playing the eagles doesn‚Äôt mean our receivers can play like eagles receivers
What is the play calling? That‚Äôs 2 straight plays with guys running routes into each other
"I get last week was frustrating due to never running the ball, but that's not the case this week. The o-line is sucking, passes keep getting tipped, and Lamar is missing throws yet again."
That was bonkers
His knee was never down imo. It was on his foot. Commentator is ass
BRUH NOBODY IN THE LEAGUE IS BETTER AT FORCING FUMBLES THAN US
BOONK GANG
"Ferguson has been having a solid sophomore year. Not as much of an instant hit as you want from the NCAA all time sacks leader, but he's improved clearly from year one and I'm excited to see how he grows throughout the year"
The ball is starting to move before he‚Äôs down. It‚Äôs a fumble. Offense needs to capitalize here!!
Dude Longhorns balling out today. Good play Elliott!
That play is going to stand.
Defence üî•üî• offence üßä
Defense is absolutely ruthless though guys
"Lamar looked kinda slower there, hope he's feeling alright!"
i hope mark is ok
Free Gus
The Gus bus only stops for the endzone!
GUSBUS
Hop on the Gus Bus! Next stop: The end zone!
"""Apex ball hawks""

I love it"
ALL ABOARD
Gus deserves these goal line touches! Way to go bus!!
DA WHEEELLLSS ON DA BUSSSS
CANT STOP THE GUS BUS
FEED GUS
THE WHEELS ON THE BUS RIGHT TO THE END ZONE LETS GOO
"Points off of the turnover.  Solid football.  Two touchdown lead.  

What we like!"
The O line did something!!!!
Really nice 1st quarter in this game
üó£ALL ABOARDDDDDDD
It's gonna be another blow out that we all know could have been even bigger isn't it
GIVE IT TO GUS
This is a complete team. We may not be playing to potential but they are cohesive. I like it.
I love Mark but it's obvious that he's not primary back material. He needs to be a compliment not the main course.
No panik to panik to no panik all in 15 minutes lol
"The Eagles look garbage on offense so far, so we're up 14-0. Have they even had a first down yet? LOLOLOL"
The fact that the bengals are up 20-0 on the colts rn makes me feel like our win last week was more impressive than I thought it was at the time
"> pass yards: -4

lol"
Who thinks we should take a guard in the 1st this year? Bozeman played C for Bama so we could slide him back and get someone like Leatherwood in the draft. Feel like we need to get stronger in the interior
[Ian Eagle calling Philly the city of brotherly love reminded me of this hilarious tweet](https://twitter.com/pff_austingayle/status/1297183628649279490?s=21)
DAE actually like that commercial
PROTECT THE BALL
Bro I could see that fumble coming a mile away. Jesus christ my heart skipped a beat.
"Just imagine the boos in that stadium right now if we weren't living through a pandemic. Even with, what, 7,500 fans, they still could heard pretty easily."
I guess Ingram is fine lol
Ingram doesn‚Äôt have the burst right now. Sit him
The Ravens haven't given up points in the 1st quarter on the road since October of last year.
They tried to Trap Cox. Nah he‚Äôs too quick for that
Where was our face-mask Ref? WTF!!! >:(
Another week where we should be winning by a lot more but hey I shouldn‚Äôt complain
cmon dobbins
Dobbins has to catch that
Auto-ma-Tuck!
This defense with last year‚Äôs offense and we‚Äôd never lose a game
"We really could win this game 30-3 and people will still
be bitching about all these changes we need to make and how we aren‚Äôt good anymore smh"
Justin Kicker should be his real name!
"I am not claiming to be an expert, but doesn‚Äôt Lamar‚Äôs delivery look different this year? I get that they‚Äôve had time to practice together and get used to it, but could that be where the problems catching the ball are coming from?"
"Lol, I swear the refs don't like the Ravens. Every week is always some bs or missed calls..."
"#HEY, WE'RE SECOND PLACE NOT THIRD"
Y‚Äôall acting like we‚Äôre loosing there‚Äôs definitely stuff to work on but y‚Äôall need to find your chill it‚Äôs 17-0
This game is over. I don't think Philadelphia could score 17 points on us if we gave them 8 quarters
OK CJ Board. We see you.
Not bad for a 5th Rounder!
Carson's not gonna survive today is he
Campbell fired up!! üí™üò§
We scored 38 on the Browns and our offense is non existent üòÇ
GOT DAMN CALAIS
Bro our D is really coming along we can win a superbowl with Dilfer of the D plays this well. They have like -1 yard
Carson Wentz is 2-7 for 3 yards LOLOL
That might be the most impressive sack of the team all season
CAMPBELLS CHUNKY NOODLE SOUP BOY
I went to check my fantasy team the Ravens Defense is producing the most points for me...which is nice because I‚Äôm a Ravens fan so this is good but sad for my Fantasy team
"Either pat queen is hurt or the ravens used board intentionally on passing downs that drive.

Board did a great job btw"
Remember. This eagles team put up almost 30 on the steelers and we are without our 2 best d-lineman. This defense something else holy shit.
Lamar is SO inaccurate right now
Jackson what is you doing baby?
"""The punter has come to play"" 

Literally his first good punt"
"I want to get hyped with the D, but im still scarred from KC"
What the fuck Lamar in no way did you need to side arm that ball IMO.
"course the Air Force is sponsoring us, we are shooting down everything out here. our defense is a no fly zone"
This side arm business is fucking garbage
"Carson Wentz: *Drops Back*

Ravens Defense: ü•∫üëâüëà is it for me?"
Horrible pass on 1st down. 0 yard run on 2nd and 10. Great start!
Nice play Lamar!!!
#JK ALL DAY
Nice run by Dobbins
Bro LAMAR EXTENDED WHILE FLIPPING IN THE CORRECT DIRECTION WTF
Feed dobbins and gus and watch the points roll in
Finally Dobbins did something.
"Everything about Dobbins reminds me of Ray Rice. Same number, similar physical stature and they even kind of run the same."
These offensive line penalties are going to kill us
Lamar gotta stop side-arming shit. He doesnt have consistent mechanics. Please clear your head during the week off.
"Ravens: Do a not touchdown

r/ravens: What the fuck"
"STOP

WITH

THE

FLAGS"
So are the refs just getting bored with the game and trying to get the Eagles back in it?
O-line owes me 500 pushups each
You can't beat good teams making these mistakes.
The good news is at some point these will be half the distance instead of 10 yards.
What the hell is that horn????
Bruh the OL has essentially ruined this drive
"Uh alright, fuck it, 2 deep shots"
OLine combined IQ -3
This is an interesting strategy to keep the ball away from the eagles. Just keep committing penalties that replay the down.
"Just kept the clock running that whole time, big brain stuff lol"
Beautiful punt. Boy is a weapon
Lamar needs to pump fake or fix that sidearm shit. Cabt do that all the time.
"Dude, WHAT THE FUCK ARE THEY DOING? Is this a joke or something? Why is Lamar only throwing sidearms? WTF is the Oline doing? WHY ARE WE PASSING SCREENS OVER AND OVER ON A 3RD AND 30?"
Hurts is gonna stay in
Didn't realise they were allowed to get 1st downs
lol we let hurts scramble
How are you gonna let Hurts do that you
Eagles just running 2 QBs for the rest of the game might be their only hope
What was with the fucking annoying ass air horn ?
All that for 3 yards
Hold them to 0
That was obviously not a catch in bounds
Think its a catch just a good play
Not gonna call that block in the back?
Defense got lucky on that one.
Good thing Eagles only active play makers are ass
Lucky the eagles dropped another pass
Defense bailed out a couple times but horrible catch attempts by Philly
Wow bailed out by that drop
Game of Drops
#SHORT
HE SHORT
Looked short
DENIED! HELL YEAH LETS GO TRENCHES
That's a stop!!!
That was short
Short.  Now fuck off the field
Refs will probably give it to him LOL
Campbell is a monster
Big stand!!
Fuck yes!
#HELD TO ZERO
Juiceman about to play his own pickup game in the backfield.
"Defense is fine, even if they give up a TD here. That‚Äôs still only 7 points allowed in a half. 

The offense is more concerning. Lamar and the offense has looked extremely mediocre. The eagles are not a good defense."
That was the play to have Hurts in right there
wow. what a combo of luck and good ol' ravens D
"Lol, his body didn't even cross the line. If they get this, then the refs are payed off"
Defense balling out without Brandon Williams and Derek Wolf.
Take a deep shot to Hollywood please
Wow content to take it to the half
"WTF was that? Not even trying to score, and now we have to give them the ball again."
I hate not pushing it at the end of the half.  You have the literal best kicker in the history of the NFL with 2 timeouts and 50 seconds.  Just freaking push the ball. Now you give them the ball back because you wanted to play it safe.
Could have at least tried to make it 20-0
"We have 80 yards to go and risk going 3 and out passing and giving Philly the ball with TOs and over 30 seconds with field position near their 30. 

Not worth trying to get a fucking field goal when we're getting the ball back. Anyone who disagrees needs to play something other than Madden."
Good try McPhee
That was 3 free points bro
WHAT THE FUCK
Refs giving them all the chances
there's ur pick lol
Oh duck off that's not roughing
The fuck was that RTP call?
I can't stand roughing the passer calls that aren't flagrant even slightly!
Such a weak RTP
BOI YOU AINT NO JUSTIN TUCKER
*CHUCK CHUCK*
ball dont lie
You know harbs is cussing the refs out behind that mask lol
Hahahahahaha they‚Äôre killing themselves today
Man the eagles suck
Ball don't fucking lie
Ball don‚Äôt lie bitch
Ball don‚Äôt lie
Lmao the bengals are blowing the lead?
Tucker is my dad
"Dude the defense is looking lovely! This fucking offense? Lost, weak, milktoast. I get Lamar trying to develop as a passer, but what the fuck man. Why isn't he actually throwing more than a 2 yard screen, and when he does throw further he sidearms it? He seems like he's hurt or something, hes not running at all and he looks so out of rhythm. He passed better last year! He doesn't look like he's developing well if last year's throws looked better than now. Idk whose fault this is necessarily but it's gotta change."
I'm all about this Tucker Royal Farms commercial.
Wtf are the patriots doing
Atleast we're winning but this has really been a shit game to watch
The defense has been really improving this year week by week. It‚Äôs great to see
"Jesus Christ, more penalties"
Please stop with these Penalties
Perfect: glances off a WRs hand and a flag on the same play! lol
What the fuck is going on at the line of scrimmage holy cow.
I predict we see a lot more Hurts this half
OH man that was some 2019 Lamar there
There's our Lamar!
"See when Greg Romans passing plays inevitably fail Lamar needs to get over being seen as a running QB, because Romans doing you no favors"
#STUNT ON THEM
You guys still think he's not that fast anymore lol?
THE FUCKING LLAMA HAS BEEN SPOTTED
YES LAMAR that's what I like to see
Finally jackson runs
Jesus fucking christ this o line is pissing me off
Welcome back Lamar <3
I think the coaches said the offensive player that gets the most penalties today gets a bonus. Thats the only explanation.
Man our runners got hit almost before getting the ball
"I think winning has made the coaches too relaxed. Explains why every aspect of the offense isn‚Äôt clicking, don‚Äôt hammer the fundamentals into them enough"
Really liking what Duvernay is doing in this game. Here's hoping we put him to use more
"Yes offense, yes."
Someone bring out the belt and whip the O line in a row
Jesus fucking Christ how atrocious has this line play been
What is Lamar doing here?
Wtf.  1 step forward 2 steps back
"Jesus Christ Lamar, throw it away"
"Jesus christ Lamar, now out of FG range. WTF"
cmon andrews
These penalties are killing us
God our pass game is so shit doesn‚Äôt help that the O-Line is ass as well
Omfg
Jesus fucking Christ
Taking a sack there wtf
"Great job Lamar, get sacked out of fg range! Throw it the fuck away"
"I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt turn it over but that could have been a FG for us. Our offence is dying for the Bye next week, looking way out of sorts."
This offense looks like actual hot ass.
Offense has been in a daze for weeks now. They‚Äôre about as stable as crypto.
WRs can‚Äôt get any separation against average Dbs smh
O-Line Get your shit together
"What the fuck happened to our offense in one year? O-line has no clue what they‚Äôre doing, Lamar has regressed exponentially, and Mark Ingram has fallen off the face of the earth. Our incredible defense is the only reason we‚Äôre up."
Offense get your heads out of your collective asses and go score. FUCK.
How fucking stupid is that
Well that‚Äôs on peters a bit
Bad luck
Bruh that‚Äôs actually so lucky
What a weird 2 pt conv play
"That was dumb.

I am fine with that, but it was dumb."
Can someone please explain why tf they went for two?
Damn we sent the house and overran that play bigtime. Chuck shouldn't have to take on the lead blocker
Duvernay is awesome
"Offensively we have no identity. We used to be a run first team... even on fourth and 3. Now I see us having Lamar throw sidearm incompletions left and right and running maybe one third of the time.

Run the fucking ball from the get go and set up one on ones. Jesus christ"
How do even these passes look bad?
Eagles o lineman hugging a Ravens defender on the ground after weve been called for penalties on every other play lol.
It‚Äôs so nice not to worry about our returners fumbling lol
Has Lamar taken shots downfield yet today?
Does Greg Roman just suck at designing screen plays?
"Even if he hadn't been touched, Brown was going to slip anyways lol"
I just want to see one deep shot to Hollywood a game atleast
[deleted]
That was maybe the best pocket we‚Äôve made all year
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!
There‚Äôs the RPO
LLAMA
Has there ever been a receiver that goes down right away like Hollywood?
z o o m
"Need to have at least a few run option to keep the defense guessing

Edit haha I‚Äôm a little behind"
"Fuck yes, need more of that"
vikings suck
Need that!
LETTTSSS GOOOOOO
There he is!
It‚Äôs almost as if that play works and we should use it more often
This is still our motherfucking guy. Have some faith y'all!
BIG TRUSS!!!
"What‚Äôs up with us coming out late of the huddle almost every play? I get eating the clock but even when we‚Äôre not up, it‚Äôs always like with 5-2 seconds left."
Keep dat llama
BIG TRUSS
I need several happy paragraphs from those aggrieved commenters from before lol
"The Ravens may have dialed back on the designed runs for Lamar this season; but when they do call it, Jackson just gets it done!"
"Lmao so what I've noticed is teams aren't letting Lamar get to the perimeter but he can kill them between the tackles. Look at his TD runs this year, between the tackles. Obviously it's dangerous to do that too much but it's there."
Campbell going to make soup out of Wentz at this rate
Holy shit hahah Campbell just swatted 66 out of the way
"First Burrow, now Wentz. We bullied the nice guy quarterbacks, we better bully the bad guy quarterback coming up lol"
Monstars baby
Calais just tossed 66 aside like a fly on that sack...wow
Marlon Humphrey is one punch man.
Does that count as a FF? You don‚Äôt gotta recover it right
3rd straight week for a FF from Marlon?
Fruit Punch gettin game coverage
FRUUUUIIIIIT PUUUUNCH
Marlon ‚ÄúMike Tyson‚Äù punch out
DAMN OUR DEFENSE ARE SOME BALLHAWKS!!!!
It‚Äôs crazy how people will take Jalen over Humphrey.. I don‚Äôt think Marlon has let a single TD this season when the ball gets thrown his way
Next payday I'm getting me a Humphrey jersey. Fuckin love his game
"Lol fun fact, Amazon doesn't own their fleet."
"CJ Board update: He does have a neck injury, unspecified what"
"I know we've been keeping track of number of consecutive games with a Ravens defensive turnover, but we're gonna have to track the number of consecutive Marlon punch outs soon too üêê"
Mayfield is out of the game rn fyi
Why do we run on 2 and long??
PEANUT PUNCHHHHH
Offense keeps doing jackshit on 1st and 2nd and then it‚Äôs 3rd and long every time
Another wasted down
Boykin and Lamar just can‚Äôt get that sideline throw down
"Uhhh...? Boykin literally took off on a dead sprint and looked over his shoulder after the pass from Lamar was already on the ground, wow they were so off there. What the hell happened?"
Boykin is so bad. Every game he‚Äôs running with his head down
Marlon ‚Äúlooks like a boxer out there‚Äù
Boykin forgot his route on that one. Clear supposed to be  comeback route.
John Harbaugh said Boykin is in all the right spots ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It's always Boykin. They gotta get on the same page
Boykin has gotta be put on the hot seat. He has no clue what he's doing
AGAIN with Boykin.
Is it really Boykin running the wrong routes coaches seem to say he‚Äôs playing fine and not in the wrong
Ertz is having a bad game.
welp. bound to happen.
Wonder how the coverage was supposed to go
This game is nowhere near over.  2 score game if they get points here.  D needs a stop.
Ward definitely hit him late
Damnit Ward!!
Good call there
cmonnnnnn we dont need to blast him after throwing it!
What a stupid penalty.
wow it wasn‚Äôt judon
We are just going to ignore the BLATANT hold there refs?
That dude could have took a nap and then got back up and caught that ball wide open.
"I feel like professional football players should be able to tackle, that's just me."
That was a pick!
"Harrison fucked up big time there.

Lets go offense!!"
Ok now go score
Hump took a big impact trying to stop the 2 point conversion. Hope he‚Äôs ok.
I just want the fucking steelers to start losing man I want first place back
"nick ""mark andrews"" boyle"
Bungles boutta choke on their 21-0 lead lol
Imagine having 13 open on 3rd a 4 and just throwing it away ffs
The GOAT!
AUTOMATUCK!!!
Tucker is good beyond words
GET YOUR FLAGS READY REFS
Making 55 yarders look like XPs.
If we come out playing soft coverage I will be very annoyed
Bengals went for a field goal to take the lead and doinked it
"Four and out, yessir!"
Jimmy still a G
"I wanna give the eagles some respect, they may not be the best team. But they got heart, I can tell from the way they are playing."
We have to have the best db corps in the league no?
This is beyond fucked up
LOL OF COURSE A FUCKING PENALTY
Another penalty! Holy fuck
10 penalties now?
"I swear to Christ this offensive line needs to have their bye week revoked or something, fucking a"
These fucking penalties
Holy fuck these penalties are killing us
The more I see this O-line the higher Stanley‚Äôs price becomes
5 of 6 OL have been penalized. Just fucking awful.
"Refs have let teams hold us all year, what a load of shit"
How many flags? Seriously. I think everyone on offense has gotten one by now. Wtf guys!?
I've seen that same holding call on Mekari get ignored when we're on defense all year I feel like
The entire O-line needs to walk home tonight
Score would be insane if our oline wasn't flagged every play
It's Tucker Time! Heck yah.
I really wish we had a receiver who was capable of getting open quickly. Obviously one of them is out on the market rn but.....
Lamar high key been frying today in the passing game
Gotta clean up these penalties
[deleted]
I hope that guy's ok. Hate to see that
Browns are frauds
humphrey just shoves him down for a sack lol
HOLY SHIT YOU CAN GET CALLED FOR HOLDING AGAINST THE RAVENS??
Carson Jackson
Bad tackle by Queen
Queen soft as hell for that
An offensive holding on the Eagles?! Do my eyes deceive me?
wow they held us? wow!
TEXANS NO
How do you guys like Dev Duv so far?
"If anyone cares, that's the second offensive holding call we've gotten called for us this year."
PICKED!!! ELLIOT!!
Elliott didn't catch that.
"Two missed picks this game, damn. Wentz will be really fortunate if the game ends with 0 INTs for him."
Lmao Jalen Hurts is funny af. Y'all see the face he made at the camera? üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Jalen Hurts sighting
Are you fucking joking?
Wtf.
"Oh come on

That was double coverage"
In triple coverage on fourth down are you joking
How did they miss that
#I SWEAR TO FUCKING CHRIST IF WE LOSE THIS GAME
And just like that it's a game
Maybe if the offense could keep the ball longer then a minute the defense wouldn't be tired af
Why does it seem like they stop caring like half way through every game?
Defense is so gassed right now
Wtf is going on?!
Can the overly optimistic fans fuck off now?
This is actually really embarrassing
Peters hurt or just giving up?
No idea how this defense gives up this many yards in a half to a team devoid of offensive talent.
goddamn these penalties
Jesus christ this is pathetic
So many bad penalties. Disappointing performance.
Penalties will be the death of us
Eagles would be up if the receivers caught the balls they dropped. Not a good look. D has had its moments but they were exposed this second half
We are literally trying to blow this game
NFL refs go brrrr
unfuckingbelievable
Lamar is not getting any help at all out there man.
We really gonna let them tie this game huh?
"We're not even at the 2 minute warning yet and we let them have the ball back with the clock stopped. Fans back in it too.

Wtf are yall doing"
27 seconds on offense. Tell me again how everything is fine.
offense is not consistent. playcalling is god awful. offensive line sucks. that is all.
Lol how much time did we just take off the clock? Like 10 seconds? Complete disaster when we could have sealed the win.
And now it's all on the D. Should never have got to this.
OG Ravens football is back.
Where‚Äôd all them ‚Äúfucking relax‚Äù fans go? Only up one TD now. 27 seconds of offense with 3 mins left. Embarrassing.
FUCKING BULLLLSSHHIIIIT
that is such a terrible call my god
Feels like I‚Äôm watching a classic Flacco/Cam Cameron game.
REFS I STG
This is bullshit
12 penalties.
Eagles dude pushed Marcus out of the way
Well this is embarrassing
How‚Äôs that PI???
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT CALL
What the actual fuck was that call...
That was a bull shit PI
Now y'all see why offense fucking matters. Goddamn
Someone has a stake in this game...
The refs exposing us right now /s
Who is Gilchrist some PS guy?
We gonna blow this game
omg these lucky ass plays
Haha this game sucks
Were is body built by taco bell
Gerry Sandusky literally said the hay was in the barn on the radio when tucker nailed that last field goal.
"Fourth quarter, 30-28*, blood pressure 350/97"
Greg Roman.
Watch there will be a wide open receiver on the 2 point conversion
"Fuck the refs
Fuck our offense
Fuck everything"
Shoot Roman into the god damn sun
The offense couldn't stay on the field and sustain a drive at the end to put this away. The defense has made some costly mistakes today but this is mostly on the offense. Tons of terrible penalties that killed our drives too.
"Ugly, ugly game. Win or lose this game blows"
False start on the 2 point by a mile not called.
"The Eagles Oline left side moved early on that 2 pt try with no flag, but screw em"
And a false start there too
They missed a blatant false start on that too! 68 went way early
THANK GOD.
"Mother of God, what a terrible game.  And it never ends!"
Games still not over yet
Can Judon get back on the bus ride home ?
Eagles have more false starts than the Ravens have penalties
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Holy fucking shit. It literally is just a fucking rerun of our 2016 game.
It took Judon 5 fucking weeks to do something
FUCK YOU BITCH
There you go Judon
On the Peter's bs PI there was a big time missed hold on Bowser. Of course not called.
Even though we won can we get a blame of the game thread
Once again our defense won the game
PROCHE MVP
Proche has the best hands on the team
Well it‚Äôs reassuring to know we not the Falcons
Where was the dumbass earlier saying this game wasn‚Äôt ugly and we should stop complaining?
Thank you proche
Bless our special teams. They can get the game ball. Offense and defense don't deserve shit today.
Llama with game ball
There we go!! That bootleg to seal is like that Houston MNF 2017 game
"We held on boys, holy shit"
"Now the hay really *is* in the barn

Thank you Faster Chief"
lol @ the army crawl back inbounds
Fucking heart attack
Kind of nice to win a game with my heart going 90 by the end forgot what that felt like lol
Both 5 and 1 starts ended in Super bowls !
Good to win but man that felt like a loss.
The ravens offense is... a mess. But the refs where horrendous. Is there anything that provides quality assurance for them after performances like this!?
Crawled to the win
Marcus Peters got picked on this game.
"God our fanbase is so annoying. The offense is absolutely struggling, nobody is saying otherwise. But you get looked at like a leper if you point out that we're also 4-1 and currently up 17 in the first half. I watch football for fun, not to constantly moan and groan about everything that goes wrong."
I‚Äôm seeing some serious losers in this thread.
"#Get rid of the horn, fucking retarded eagles fans"
Look at everyone complaining that we're only up 17-0.
"LaMaR HaS BeEn FiGuReD OuT. HeS NoT ScoRiNg On EvErY PoSSeSSioN, RavEns BlOw"
"Another week with a lot of people saying complaints aren't allowed. Well, Lamar has completed 46.2% of his passes, the o-line has been bad, and the run game is averaging 3.7 YPC. Thankfully the defense has made these multiple weeks of bad offense irrelevant, but pretty soon the Ravens start to play some decent teams and this offense won't cut it."
"Guys chill out, we are winning by 10 against a horrible team and our offense looks like shit for the 4th week in a row but we shouldn‚Äôt be concerned right?"
Jalen hurts is gonna be in this game. I can feel it
the dude hasnt moved since the hit and his teammate comes up to him flexin. bruh
I really wanna watch the game with y‚Äôall because COVID but some of y‚Äôall are toxic AF. Just enjoy the season JFC
"Yikes, another bad sidearm pass. Step into your throws, Lamar. Is his shoulder hurt?"
I don‚Äôt think that was a catch
"NFC East really is a cripple fight, isn't it?"
We really shouldn't sleep on the Browns. Baker is hurt and Chubb is out. They've played just as shitty of teams as we have this year except for the Chiefs.
"Out of curiosity,

Through 5 games:

2020 Lamar : 949passing yrds, 9TDs 2INTs 63.7% . 238 rush yards, 1TD 5.8avg

2019 Lamar : 1271passig yrds , 11TDs 5Ints 65.4% . 308 rush yards, 1TD 6.2avg"
Lmao. Why does Hollywood just fall down on every catch. He is NOT a #1
"ThE oFfEnSe iS FinE 

*8 penalties*"
About 3-5 times per game this season i go ‚Äúwtf lamar‚Äù. That rarely ever happened last year.
i thought you can't fumble forward?
"Can we give Lamar the option to call his own plays? He's a smart kid he understands schemes. Rodgers does it in occasion, Russell wilson does it in occasion, so why can't Lamar?"
We need to hire a passing game coordinator this is insane
"Keenum is in for the browns

lol"
People need to remember that Eagles have a top 5 if not top 3 Defensive line
We were winning...30-14. STOP BLOWING ASS
"This is 100% on the offense. If they actually knew how to score without the defense giving them turnovers or great field position, this wouldn't even be a game"
RAVENS GOT THIS . LAMAR MURRAY IS THE NEXT MAHOMES!!! YEEEHAW
"Lamar is so out of it man. Fuck everyone who says we‚Äôre toxic and fake fans for having valid criticisms, man looks like he isn‚Äôt even trying on some of those"
Baker benched LOL
"Lamar looks like a rookie QB out there, not the MVP of last year."
Another mental breakdown. This would be a bloodbath against Pitt.
Unpopular opinion: I think the offense looked good today but penalties are killing our momentum
Offense fucked us over. They suck
"Not a single mask in that crowd, wtf..."
Our rush game is WEAK (today)
"MARK IS HURT, I REPEAT, MARK IS HURT"
"Even if he catches that it's not a first down, does Roman know this?"
"This offense is leaving a lot to be desired this year. Bad play calling, poor touch and accuracy on passes, no hands by the wide receivers, and the OL isn‚Äôt providing any time to step into throws. Rough showing that I assume won‚Äôt be addressed until the bye week."
"Sidearm pass fail.

That was really bad."
"Man Lamar really needs to quit side arming it when there's no pressure on him, no reason to do that"
That was easily the worst coaching decision I've seen from Harbaugh in a long time.  Why the fuck do you try to run out the clock when 30 yards gets you into Tucker range with 2 timeouts.  Thankfully they don't have Tucker so it didn't hurt us but still.
The browns are imposters
Much more positives than negatives in the first half. I wish we could focus on those more
"Elliott is not to blame for this, he did all he could"
"A million penalties pre snap:

Completely covered receivers:

No downfield calls:

Raven fans: Lamars to blame for our shite offense!!!!"
[deleted]
Of course this is now a close game. Roman is a real liability if our offense can't fucking do anything.
I know I'm not supposed to say positive things about the ravens in r/ravens but it is nice to see lamar looking around for additional targets.
Let's see what dumb penalties get called on us this series.
"That's OPI, clearly pushed off. But that's alright"
You guys remember when we couldn‚Äôt criticize the offense because it was 17-0? Pepperidge farm remembers
If we continue playing like this we aren‚Äôt winning the division
#I'M GONNA BE FUCKING SICK TO MY STOMACH
132 penalty yards isn‚Äôt the refs fault man. One or two calls is the refs fault. This is embarrassing.
"Blame the refs all you guys want, if the offense had done shit for the past 3 quarters we wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation"
Penalties are killing us tbh everything has looked fine except that . If we limit the penalties we could legitimately have like 40 points rn
We should be 6-1 after today we bet the Eagles and the Refs
"*1 rush results in negative yardage*

Greg Roman: ALERT ALERT ABANDON THE RUN"
I don‚Äôt care what anyone says our offense looks like hot garbage
As much as we had the ball Lamar having 85 yards is pathetic. Lamar is struggling he is a huge part of the offense problems. Idk why we  can't admit it here. Sidearming for no reason. Throwing short. Throwing late
"Steelers are spanking the Browns but struggled with the Eagles. Its a week to week league. Lamar will clean his shit up. Literally no reason to think otherwise. When has he not improved, going back to his true freshman year at Louisville."
Offense is AIDs. Stop trying to be different go pack the rpo and win ffs
And I thought this team was going to beat the Chiefs lol
Let‚Äôs abandon the run
"If GR is reading this, don't abandon the run"
I hope none of our linemen gets tossed around by Fletcher Cox. Tyre will start again at RG I guess?
Ellis and Madubuike in for Wolfe/Williams.
Man I really wanna see our o clicking this game
LFG!!!!!!!!
5-1 before the bye would be huge!! Lfg
"I should have gone to the game, a friend said I could have gotten tickets, bus ride, and tailgate for $500, would have been worth it since it doesn‚Äôt look like we are going to be allowed at any home games this year"
Looks like we won the toss and are deferring?
FIRST PLAY
We might murder Wentz this game
"CAN WE GET AN OFFICIAL SACK COUNTER


I"
Exactly how we drew it up...
That could‚Äôve been bad
"Lol, the Peters gamble totally failed and we got lucky there"
"Breakdown in the secondary, but thank god the eagles suck lol"
Thank you football gods
Lamar could have burned him on that corner 3 steps sooner wtf...
PLAY DOBBINS
I can't believe we don't run the option anymore. I can't understand why.
Gotta get Boykin settled in good catch
Ok BOYKIN
Can we stop the bootlegs? These shits aren't working.
That ball looked so bad
The defense has given me hope. The offense... not so much so far. But it's still early
There is dobbins only carry today
Wow love that play
MAKE DUVERNAY THE WR2
Duvernay. Me like.
as soon as I see that rollout I already know it's about to be a useless play
"omg, a pick play!"
Are we ever gonna get a game called by tony and jim nantz?
Wow good shit lamar
We so hot we Boyleing
Two straight runs. Are we allowed to do that?
Beautiful
That's more like it.
Feed the Boyle #FeedTheBoyle
Andrews in shambles
I'm feeling Peters interception here!!
"*philly defends play well*

UH OHHH YOU GOT LAMAR‚ÄôD U FRIGGIN MORONS"
"Who do you guys want to win, steelers or browns?"
Sanders couldn't escape the fort
We're gonna feast on this Eagles RG
"Oh hey, the eagles got positive yards there"
This defense is good
"Oof, Hollywood was open. These batted passes are tough"
"We had two first downs on 2nd and 3rd, just got tipped twice. Damn."
This OL is young. Guards are very young players and skura has to get back in game shape
"these commercials, wtf"
"Philly has a deep and talented D line folks, chill."
Wish Roman would call more straight forward run plays.
"The playcalling is looking better, the offense is looking good. That last series the Eagles D just stepped up. We're looking great so far, not every possession is gonna be perfect, we're fine"
"Sam ""iron man"" koch"
matt stover üò¢
Wentz fell off so much dude
Anthony Averett lmao
GET OFF THE FIELD AHHHHH GET OFF THE FIELD AHHHH AHHH AHHHHHHHHHH
Anthony A has been playing pretty well these past few weeks
"LOL, Sam Koch looking so casual/relaxed on the sideline; just another day at the office for him."
Damn is he okay...KOED himself
Ouch
Damn I hope he's ok
"man, Proche has looked so dynamic returning punts"
Ingram limping off?
Ingram slow monkaS
I hope that's just a calf cramp for Ingram.  Luckily we have other RBs.
That doesn't look right.
Another 3rd and Long....smh
What even was that drive?
Who was even supposed to get that?
This game is just listless so far.
Lamar still not looking like himself and the offensive line and play calling are still really sus. Roman needs to get it together already.
"Why are Lamar's hot reads 5 yards from the first down? Like even if Snead caught that, no way was it going for a first down. Are bad plays being called or is Lamar making the wrong read? Why aren't we taking shots down field? The playcalling has been ass this season."
So I see we went back to the old Ravens: defense saving our ass and offense looking like a lame duck
Savage
That‚Äôs a turnover!
FUMBLE RECOVERY!!!
Fumble all the way
That‚Äôs our ball
Fumble ball was moving
Good kid but Wentz is trash.
CLEAN STRIP BABYYYY
Streak continues if this holds
that better be a fucking fumble
His knee‚Äôs on his shoe no?
Andrews switch jerseys with Boyle?
Hell yeah 19th game? Right? Hell yeah D
The young dudes on defense must just practice punching and yanking the ball out they are unbelievably good at turnovers.
Wow defense carrying the entire team what else is new
TD pass incoming to Mark Andrews
#APEX BALL HAWKS
"Boyle, Boykin. NFL played by a bunch of men by Lamar only throwing to ""Boy""s"
yay a completed pass
This defence got my dick hard
The Gus that couldn't slow down
"Touchdown Ravens!

Gus the Bus   üöå"
Gus is definitely better than Ingram at this point
Wow running the ball works?!?!? Who would have thought
#BUS EDWARDS HOFer
Offense 100% is feeling better than last week
Thats why i love gus. Dude hits every hole at 100mph so even if he gets stopped he still gets yards
THE BUS!
The teams we have played this year have covered the rollout so well that Lamar needs to run somewhere else for real. He runs right like every play
Bengals are up 20-0 against Indy...
When you take 4 tabs before the game
That commercial is creepy as hell man wtf üòÇ
Anyone else have a creepy feeling about that commercial? Wtf was that
I pray no one poaches wink from us next year
Wentz just accepting his fate at this point. Pathetic to watch him just stop and protect. Like throw it away dumbass
Wentz used to be good
They booing hahaha
Wentz looks Boller-esque.
DAMN THE EAGLES REALLY SUCK LOL
are they gonna make a 1st down today?
Sack city
"Great return by Proche, even if it wasn't long in the end."
I‚Äôm glad we got McPhee back. I remember being upset we didn‚Äôt resign him back in the day
"Proche looking like our best punt returner in years. Fields it well, makes good decisions, and usually gets a solid 10 yard return."
How many more drives until we see Jalen Hurts?
 I thought the colts defense was good
Oh boy Snead. Come on we can‚Äôt have that
"This year, I'm glad for a return to a little normalcy. Defense plays lights out while offense sucks ween."
"Snead you got DAMN lucky there, but great play regardless."
Willy dropped that one.  Come on Wiily
JESUS CHRIST SNEAD
"It's ok, Snead IV.  That was still a hell of a play and it worked out in the end."
"snead, cmon son"
Snead almost got Marloned
Why send Ingram back out there and risk him aggravating the injury? This feels like the EXACT scenario we drafted JK for.
"Why is Ingram in? We have JK and Gus, why risk further injury?"
Snead fumble happened because he is unfamiliar w/ catching the ball on deep routes
Ingram doesn‚Äôt need to be in the game if he hurt put in gus and jk
Some of y‚Äôall need to chill these are people too
Justin Tucker is elite
I swear for every reception we must have like two drops. It‚Äôs actually insane.
Offense hasn't been great but we're still up. This shows you what generating pressure off of FOUR rushers can do for our defense
"this offense looks lethargic, lamar can't be the only playmaker"
This upcoming draft we need to draft all Offensive linemen
These drops are just insane
"That was a catchable ball for Dobbins, but I'm not going to complain because we can't get TD's on every drive. Overall, a good offensive drive and a FG puts us up 17"
Can't wait for EDPs reaction
17 points in a half is nothing to groan about folks
Cant watch the game. How does Lamar and the offense look? Judging by the score it seems pretty good?
I SEE YOU CHRIS BOARD
Shoutout to Anthony Averett for not being trash lately
"LET'S GO DEFENSE, CALAIS IS THE BEST"
Who says we need a pass rusher!
Eagles punter MVP
Campbell is a monster
"Defense is fucking eating, holy shit 

Also that was a hell of a punt"
I wanna see an Average Joe's episode with Calais Campbell rushing a pass against 4 average joe's and juat watch the carnage.
Judon just out there running
Honestly ridiculous punt though
Bruh imagine having Carson Wentz on your fantasy
"So that puts them at what,  -7 total yards?"
AFC North straight stomping on the colts
Wtf was that lamar?
That is a depressed dog mask lol
I don‚Äôt like this passing man. What‚Äôs going on? Always so low....
"Helmet straight to the knee, ouch"
"Something I've noticed it once you get under Lamars skin, he really struggles to overcome. If we can fix that, we're unstoppable"
That dude went straight for his knees
lol reset Lamar!
Lamar pretending to be one of our TEs.
THERE'S 2019 LAMAR
Eagles game thread getting toxic lmaoo
Dobbins looks so good making guys miss
What the fuck has happened to Wentz? He looked legit for a couple of seasons.
-5 total yards üíÄ
Holy fuck what is the o-line doing
Keep feeding Dobbins
Hey guys let's not get to another 4th and 43
FUCKING FIVE OL PENALTIES CMON
Might as well just punt with 1st and 25. We will get the ball in better field position from Wentz anyway lol
Jesus....
Is this a record for illegal formations?
Bro. Are you kidding me? 3 straight plays with 25 yards of penalties?
Stanley has 3 fucking penalties... unacceptable
this oline is so bad and undisciplined to boot
This is when we take a shot down field to Hollywood
The fuck refs
1st and 35 smh offensive line needs to get it together
"If it gets to 4th down, fuck it, Hey diddle diddle, Lamar up the middle"
3 fucking flags in a row. This is god damn unacceptable.
I was just thinking that I was really enjoying how much the referees were swallowing their whistles this year lol. This is a comeuppance of biblical proportions
Why does Lamar always throw sidearm
The whole O Line taking turns fucking up
If I was the coach I would putting the oline through the wringer next practice.
uh. 1 deep shot....????
There ain't much you can do on 3rd and 30 really. Got some yards and pin back the Eagles on the punt.
Fuck it go deep.
Hurts to watch
"That was a brutal series. Could‚Äôve easily gotten 3 more points on the board. Don‚Äôt like what I‚Äôm seeing from the offence at all, the Bye is going to be really beneficial for us."
Why are we not taking shots downfield?!?!?
"Up 17-0 in the 2nd, defense is lights out, offense looks like shit. Deja vu much?"
Why haven‚Äôt they used Brown yet? That was the perfect drive
Tackle him what the fuck
Lmao they put in Hurts
"Pleased to see growth from this offense week to week. It‚Äôs not perfect yet, but I believe Lamar wants to be better than any of us could even imagine. He‚Äôll keep working"
Honestly props to Wentz for the blocking there lmao
Stupid ass browns
"1st and 35? Just throw some short passes, no point in trying."
jalen hurts my feelings
I'm honestly scared of Hurts
LOL
Here we go with the stupid bullshit plays
So this is what it was like playing against Lamar last year?
Eagles phasing in Hurts this drive makes me giggle
Not sure why we're going 1 dimensional lately.
It's not fun to play against a mobile qb man lol
FOOT NOT DOWN
That's not a catch. 2nd foot was out
That's not a fucking catch
no way he caught that
Bullshit luck on that Ward catch.
I don't know if he had control the whole time but think it's the right call to stand
"Can't get mad at that, hell of a fucking play"
That looked like a catch from the front on angle. Can't be mad for getting a call right
"My bad y'all, I meant to type ""homecooking""."
Bro..our defense is so streaky lol...wild
I'm not even sure what I'm watching anymore.
He didn't get it!!
Short lol
Short
I think we got em!
He ain't get it
no way he got that
what a fucking stop!!
*Loud Noises*
CAN WE PLEASE TAKE A DEEP SHOT NOW
LOOOOL imagine not being able to sneak a yard
DENIED!
Let the shutout continue
Lmao. Marlo screaming
I agree with the announcers. Carson needs to shoot under and he has it easy.
Guys. I thought I hated Ian Eagle's commentary. But I am loving him and Charles Davis together.
Refs really making this game boring as shit
"Without bias, where do u guys think our defense is ranked?"
"Alright Lamar, do some Lamar shit."
No turnovers please.
Come on harbs try for a fg at least
Dobbins kind of rescued that play all on his own. Picked it up from a low position and managed to make 6 yards out of it.
Dobbins goes from 0 to 60 at once!
Lol Philly trying to extend the misery
Snaps are SHIT all year. wtf
"Lol, are the Ravens not going to try to get a field goal? Not tryna sound greedy or anything but..."
Don't understand why we took a timeout on Philly's 3rd down and then are trying to run out the clock.
Seems like we aint even trying to score here. Might as well have kneeled.
How has Carson wentz managed to lose his starting job every single year of his career
You don't block Koch.  Koch blocks you
what kinda pussy shit
Why not pass there and try! Get the 1st we see the clock out.
McPhee just needed to step back once to get that
mcphee cmon!!
McPhee gotta get that!
The D is more excited to give Tucker a FG than Roman is
Half time awards... only the Defense.
Are you shitting me. Free FG attempt.
What?
Wrong call it was Ferguson. Horrible penalty.
What is this sloppy shit?
Weak fucking call!
Nice try refs
Fuck these refs
Terrible call. Gifting them points
What a shit call
bullshit fucking call wow
weak ass call to negate an int
Pussy ass refs
Holy shit what a weak fucking roughing call
good they deserved to miss that - ball don't lie
He thought he was Tucker
Well despite our best attempts Philly still not in this thing lol
Suck my fucking dick refs.
did he just say Ngata? damn I miss that guy
Philly got exactly what it deserved there. Soft RTP call and Wentz bailed out of two interceptions. Go fuck yourselves.
WJZ trolling Elliot with the Tucker commercial
"> ""Even Pikachu is upset here in Philly."" - Ian Eagle, 2020"
Tucker and royal farms. Lmao
halftime thoughts?
CJ Board took a NASTY hit in the WAS/NY game. Went limp after the hit and is being carted off
Are the Browns good or terrible???
All I can think is madden with Charles Davis
We cant even line up correctly.
This is a very classic Ravens game.
Why does this team have so much trouble lining up correctly? HOW?
I just want old ravens offense back ;-;
Have we completely given up on RPOs?
Houdini
Amazing run! Thats what we want to see! He should scramble more.
"Lamar has to run the ball to be effective. Not because he‚Äôs a bad passer, but because defenses have to be worried about his dual threat ability."
That just makes our offense so much more dynamic
Another penalty wtf
There's a Lamar run
ENOUGH WITH THE PENALTIES SMH
I really hope this is a wake up call for our offense.
"Yknow, we lose Yanda and now nobody knows how to play Oline. Great."
Pretty sure the Browns are not the kings of the north.
Raise the confidence of the whole offense pls
Announcers really playing bingo with our offensive line
Nice run Duvernay! :P
Ravens RB‚Äôs: 19 carries for 53 yards today
"We are seeing our RBs hit in the backfield every running play. 

Are they just beating their man horrendously or are we watching the read defender just play the read right?"
Ooooo hollywood coulda had 6 there
Hollywood heard me saying Duv should be wr1
Smallest possession receiver ever
Dobbins running behind last year‚Äôs line woulda been fantastic
So sick of these 3 yard sidearm dump offs. Christ.
Eagles look like a CFL team today for sure.
Fucking hell O clean it up
Way too many flags this week.
WHY DO YOU STOP YOUR MOMENTUM DOBBINS?
"The penalties this game, wth"
Throw the damn thing away Lamar!
This offense man...idk
So. Bet the falcons will blow it again üòÇ
I wonder with this many false starts its something to do with LJs hard count?
Ref hit himself in the face with his whistle lmao dumbass
The guys committing penalties have been in this offense for years!
Are we just testing Lamar to play with more yards orrrr
i love seeing the Benglols again after they were so fucking annoying for years
lamar cmon man...
Why doesnt Greg give Lamar a checkdown
"No offense, no."
"Throw it out of bounds dude, that's 3 points down the drain"
I cannot believe all these penalties man. It is rediculous. If I was Lamar id be super pissed. They cannot get any momentum because the whole Oline is fucking up
"That time was good playcalling by Roman, but the penalty killed that drive, and the sack sealed the deal..."
"Idk if last year we were too used to flacco and got excited every time we came out big, but 100% shit has slowed down this year and we have a reason to be pissed"
"Our pass play design on 3rd down was garbage. 2 deep outs stacking each other by 5 yards creating a traffic jam.

Lamar should've thrown it away but sheesh..."
"WTF, that was so lucky..."
That was a sweet play tbh
There we go..we get the ball back
This is why the offense needs to score points ffs
I didn‚Äôt think the offense could fumble forward... guess you can
Offense please put life back into my soul
Please offense. Offend.
Good return Duv
"Every game our O scores 1 td, our D gets us 1, and then we do nothing for the rest of the game it seems"
duvernay is such a good returner
Greg Roman amazing screens with no blocks
"Lol, should we go for 2...?"
I‚Äôm not sure why we keep running to fletcher cox‚Äôs side. That‚Äôs definitely the weak part of our line
"Our running game has no lanes today, kudos to the Eagles."
Hes fast
Say it with your CHEST!!
HE TURNED ON THE JETS FOR THAT ONE!!!!
And there ya go
That's what I'm talkin about
That's the Lamar we know
"Lamar

Jackson

Hype"
There we go!
Love you lamar ‚ù§Ô∏è
THAT‚ÄôS WHAT I‚ÄôM TALKING ABOUT!!!!!
#ka-chow!!
We need this to be lamars turning point
We need more QB Power. Inside runs are better for us offensively.
CALAIS FUCKING CAMPBELL IS A BEAST
Stop it! You're killing him! (Eagles O-line blows)
Lmao! Campbell threw that oline man like a little boy. Unbelievable
Campbell is so large
He made that boy look like a pillow
This game is gonna send Campbell to the pro bowl
Calais damn near clubbed that man to death
A 5th round pick guys
Another FF!!
Campbell for President
Humph with a punch out. So good.
this defense is great to watch
Marvin bringing the PAWNCH
Saitama-rlon Humphrey
The Humphrey hit
Another punch by Humphrey.
MARLON PUNCH SIGHTING
"F R U I T  

P U N C H"
MARLO DPOY!!!
Fruit Punch
Is that the 3rd game in a row Marlo‚Äôs had a forced fumble?
"Players I‚Äôd least want to get punched by: 

Marlon Humphrey
Calais Campbell"
I enjoy our improved return game; compared to last year.
Peanut Punch... I like that lol
"Marlon ""(Fruit-)Punch-Free"" Humphrey!"
That‚Äôs defensive player of the year right there!!
Humphrey is the best CB in the NFL.
Lamar go stunt on those hoes
There is a 50% chance the falcons still lose this week lol
"I've been pretty impressed with Elliot so far this season. Hes stepped up nicely replacing ET3, having missed the past 2 seasons with injuries. Hed got a forced fumble and pass batted down and has had a few sacks I think this season."
Baker got benched?
Boykins running the wrong route LOL
Boykin and Lamar hate each other.
cmon boykin
Why can you not add that to the end of the kick? Seems dumb
"Like it's not even up for debate who was right, Lamar or Boykin. Boykin was fucking blocking the corner into infinity never even looking for the ball??"
We've been whiffing big body receivers since we let Q go
Running the ball on second and 10 is so infuriating
Yikes. He was wide open ><
We got BURNED there
"All the flags they‚Äôre throwing, and none for holding"
Sure bitch about the PI there when your O-Line was holding Carson.
No we did not lol there was no contact.
Great play by Jimmy
He had a hand on a hip with no pull. That would have been ticky tack. Then they hit feet and both fell.
Humph is elite.
How many dropped INTs we have this year
Lucky we didn't get a roughing the passer.
Not that I want a RTP but that was worse than Calais' earlier lol
Wentz got cranked
omg another fucking flag
We're lucky we didn't get two of those in a row.
Jesus fucking christ
Dumb ass
With this trash ass like Judon still can‚Äôt make a play lol
Lmaooo Bengals blew a big lead
"Thought that was Judon, am shocked tbh"
Bullshit
Fucking idiot wasnt even close
Thanks Ward for being a dumbass.
"If he just makes an effort to let up a little on the tackle they don't call that, dumb mistake"
This game is giving me a headache
Mekari in interesting
Was our offensive line coach replaced by a succubus
"The fucking formation was all fucked just now, it would have been another penalty"
Nick 'Mark Andrews' Boyle
Great throw
Was there ever a doubt?????
#MR AUTOMATIC
Would have been good from 70
WOW
A punchers chance? Maybe if that puncher is Mike Tyson
"Roman's taking a good nap, along with the o-line and officiating squad..."
How bad is Fluker if he‚Äôs not getting any playing time? I thought we brought him in specifically for RG.
[deleted]
All but one other 1pm game are already over. We still have 10 minutes left in this thing...
D just came up HUGE there.
"Man, I love our defense so god damn much"
Really like seeing Jimmy out there. He's still a damn good DB even if he's not the shutdown corner he used to be
"Fuck yeah Jimmy, our CB depth is unfair"
Jimmy is as sticky as ever
Jimmy could still be the best in our DB room ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Need one of those good ole 2019 8 minute TD drives here
let's get a fucking TD here and bury this
"Lotta flags, more than I care to see. That being said, close this one out so that we can heal/rest for the upcoming bye week"
That‚Äôs like what the 3rd illegal formation? We have to tighten up this stuff
Lamar just pump faked so hard he almost threw himself forward lmao
I'm was excited that Jimmy resigned. Happy it's still working out
These fucking refs
This is so bad on the offensive line
We need the 2019 Raven's offense to magically appear and eat the clock for 8 minutes lol
"lol these penalties, make the line run sprints all through the bye week"
How are we the only team in the league that gets offensive line penalties right now?
Who the fuck wants to watch this
"Our team is definitely undisciplined but they have ignored some blatant holds by the Eagles O-line, fucking hell"
How long do they want this game to go lol...
They absolutely cannot call that hold with all that they‚Äôve let go this year. Fucking ridiculous.
The refs have something big up their asses. I'm pretty sure it's a wad of $100s
ThE ofFeNsE lOoKs FiNE.
This game is literally unwatchable. What a laughable offense.
The ironic thing is the actual pass blocking has been much better so my guess is that they have put some of these changes in to get an edge and they're just walking a bit too close to the line on them.
Well I low-key love Hollywood. Gets it done.
Bro our offensive line is actually so shit now
Some of you all keep saying offense but it‚Äôs the damn o line.
That was the 4th drive that was killed by penalties ...
"10 penalties for 73 yards.

God damn"
Tucker with 3 for the Field Tuck right there
Patriots lost to the Broncos lmao
"The only blatantly wrong call has been the roughing the passer at the end of the first half, you can't really argue formation penalties or offsides/false starts. It would be nice if they called some holds on the Eagles o-line, but this is the most undisciplined Ravens team in the past few years by far."
Hump with a sack!
Second straight week our pass rush been eating
Fucking tackle that asshole.
How did we just allow that???
Humphrey is a fucking boss
This game is so weird
How the fuck do you allow Wentz to run for 40 yards LMAO
We just let Carson Wentz run 40 yards...
Hump with the sack!
A flag thats not on us!! Celebrate
I really think it's because hes a QB didn't want foul
Carson ‚ÄúLamar Jackson‚Äù Wentz
That looked like everyone thought the other person was going get him down.
Queen buddy what was that
Let's go Texans
As long as the Titans show up next week
"This is why I get annoyed not going for a score with a minute left in the half. The eagles aren‚Äôt rolling over, put them away"
JOKER SZN
Wentz got BLOWN up on that pick by Bowser
Why tf is this game so longggg LOL
He didn‚Äôt even catch it lol
Of course he dropped it
At this rate the Texans Titans game is going to go all 10 minutes of OT before this game is over lmao
We can never get the easy pick
Glad our defence is keeping these 2nd halves entertaining every week
Fuck it just do it again
Fuck
2 dropped picks this game
So many dropped int's
At least Bowser made a good play on the pressure
Humphrey like wolverine looking for that fumble
The only other 1pm game going is in OT and we have more than 4 minutes left. The ot game will probably end before ours at this rate
Lol nice push off
"Peters looks... Off, today."
What the fuck is going on
Bruh if they get this it's a one score game
Please just run the ball and end this game without ever giving philly another touch
Give me a fucking break dude
Eagles nobodies show up more than some of our starters.....
If we‚Äôre playing like this against the fucking EAGLES...oh man playoffs ain‚Äôt gonna be fun
#RUN THE FUCKING BALL AND EAT CLOCK ROMAN YOU FUCKING DIPSHIT
What the fuck are we doing dude we should have put this away last quarter
How is this game this close dammit wtf
Did the Ravens take a team nap during halftime? We‚Äôre looking dead out there!!
Marcus Peters looks banged up. Slow to get up every time. He's given up a lot of plays this second half.
The fucking ot game is over and we haven't hit the 2 minute warning. Why is this the longest game
"Lmao the Texans Titans game really finished earlier than this game, which is not even close to being done ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Still can‚Äôt blame the D. We‚Äôve been dominant on defense, they‚Äôre just gassed because our offense isn‚Äôt taking up time like we did last year."
Can‚Äôt get 3 yards on play fake. This OL is garbage.
Offense needs to pick it up now
We better run here on 2nd (I‚Äôm delayed)
Shocking holding what a fucking surprise
Embarassing
How many damn holding penalties are we gonna commit??
Fucking offensive penalties. I can't even.
Lol another offensive penalty at the worst possible time!
"Now truly thankful for the Titans COVID mishaps....cuz if not, we would be playing the steelers right afterwards. Now we have an extra week to get this shit fixed."
Penalties fucked the Ravens in the ass with a 10 ft pole if they lose
Harbaugh isn't gonna go easy on em at our next practice
We have to trust Lamar to help us seal the deal
FUCK THESE PENALTIES
bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
This is disgusting.
This is infuriating they should be killing this team
Here we go. Another bad drive
Jfc no one was open
This was supposed to be a cake walk ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
my god this team dude come on this shouldn‚Äôt be close
83 penalty yards this game
"Well thanks for the early bye week, we need it."
def no mvp repeat
This offense is reminding me of the 2015-2017 offense regarding horrific penalties
11 penalties for 84 yards
Fire Roman
This team wants to make me drink.
Are you fucking serious on this DPI
I absolutely hate the throw away.. lamar has to slide if he's giving up on the play. saved them a timeout
Ravens are just shitting bricks
There it is boys. We gonna lose
"Lamar needs to stop adding 10 yards to every play
If you move out of the pocket stop going 10 yards backwards before you throw the ball. It's so fucking irritating"
You‚Äôve gotta be fucking kidding me
Holy fuck what an awful call
Fuck.
That‚Äôs some bullshit
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YALL DOING
Why were all the routes deep? Nothing underneath for 9 damn yards?
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
How is that DPI?
BULLSHIT
This is serious flacco era vibes
# 27 Seconds. Time of last possession.
FUCK YOU REFS. ARE YOU KIDDING ME
I‚Äôm so fucking tired of refs sucking ass
FUCK
We're fucked.
Fucking hate this
this game is rigged
What a shitty call
WHAT THE FUCK
"The team has played sloppy today, but that was not a penalty."
This is poetic
ARE YOU SERIOUS
L o fucking l at this game already
Pathetic defense
Ffs now we're going to loose this?
132 yards....
Deja fucking vu. Didnt this already happen the last time we played Philly? Theyre gonna score and miss the 2pt conversion.
"relax fuckers we need a game like this, so the team can learn."
Bowser got tackled by their lineman on that huge DPI but of course let's call it on the ravens
just gotta hope we can stop their incoming 2pt conversion tbh.
"O line is the problem, open your eyes"
"Carson ""Flacco"" Wentz"
P A T H E T I C
This feels like the old days of the Ravens defense giving up the lead.
Inventing the second half was a mistake
PLEASE STOP THE 2 POINT
I'm glad they just went ahead and scored. Put GRo and Lamar in a high-pressure position. They need to prove it.
THERE WE GO FUCK
If the refs weren‚Äôt homecooking this would be a 58-7 game.
Luckily the eagles are bigger clowns then us
I‚Äôm like *what happened to the original plot of the movie* üòî
Also can this announcer shut the fuck up this game isn‚Äôt over
Thanks to the Eagles for some DUMB playcalling on the conversion there
JUDON!!!!
There you go judon
Finally Taco Bell did something
FUCK YOU.
FALSE START FROM THE LEFT TACKLE AND WE STILL STOP THEM. FUCK YOU EAGLES
That was a False start as well but I'd take it.
They have some many uncalled false starts its ridiculous
Lol they're playing fly eagles fly after that yikes
That was a real good kick. Hell of a job by Proche
"fucking finally judon!! and wow this was too close, that was a fucking false start too"
Who‚Äôs 28? Poor dude got lit the fuck up
"As bad as the offense has looked, they could still get the ball back."
Carson Wentz looks like Prince Harry's long lost cousin
This game had major Bills vs Ravens vibes where for some reason it was a lot closer than it should've been with a bunch of flaggery.
Oof. Too close for comfort. We need a lot of work. But 5-1 with work to do is fine
Just be happy the eagles dropped a wide open td early in the game. This could have been a well deserved L and we know it
"I'm still ticked off at the offense, even if they win. The Defense gift wrapped them multiple opportunities to put this thing away. Roman's called better plays but honestly, he's still VERY inconsistent. Top that with the constant penalties by the O-line (although some were complete bs). Also, the refs are garbage."
Has anyone noticed that the eagles LT has been jumping the snap by a fraction all game.
Game
LMAO Lamar is hilarious
Yay!!! We won barley üòÜ
The ugliest of wins
Another ugly ass win
Had to be Lamar to ice it. One thing I will say is running him less seems to have made those deceptive keeper plays MUCH more effective.
Go and fucking score so we can pretend like this wasnt a close game
Fuck it we take these
"Ballgame.

Lucky to get out of here with a win, and that's what matters."
Wow we didn't blow a 16 pt lead with 6 mins left let's celebrate like crazy
Llama wanted to score lol
Ravens 30 Eagles + Refs 28
I mean if we're gonna play like this at least we get a win. Can't be too mad. Just a bit mad
Offense Identity needs to change now if we want to be competitive in the playoffs
"This game sucked, but we‚Äôre still a good team. Time to get to work and show out after the bye"
Was way closer than it was ever allowed to be
"We have a garbage game where we play down every year.  It sucks, but its in our DNA. Close them out ASAP and move onto the next game is the only thing we can do."
"Should we bench JK then, according to you people? Just checking."
"I swear this sub is toxic, were up 17-0. Yet everyone here is saying "" tHis gAmE is UglY"" like you guys must have never watched us win 13-7 4 years ago, or losing a 12-9 game against the browns two years ago, or 6-3 win over the chiefs during our superbowl year. Y'all bandwagons don't know shit."
That‚Äôs what happens when the offense does nothing. Defense starts fucking up
"Even if the Ravens win this game, they need to make a trade. This team is smoke and mirrors. The defense is great, but can't carry the offense when is keeps getting 3 and outs. Really need to simplify the offense because right now, the execution is just piss poor."
"Lol, Greg's back at it with the gimmicks. O-line's falling asleep too."
BeNcH iNgRaM
Like we‚Äôre gonna lose this game if Lamar doesn‚Äôt get his fucking shit together.
"Can the people who say the offense is trash stop prefacing it with ""i will say what no one has ever dared to say"" as if this sub hasn't been lobbying for Greg Roman to be fired and Lamar to retroactively give back his MVP since week 2."
5th rounder for Derrick Henry
This is why webbitch about the offense. Because this game should have been over essentially an hour ago. Anyone who says we complain fuck off.
How can you watch this team and be optimistic about January football.
I hope we all now understand our offense is terrible and being up 17-0 against the Eagles doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre whining. Fuck this game
This is the first time I‚Äôve seen Carson Wentz play since like 2017.. has dude been really this ass ? How can u go for an obvious MVP to a possible back up in the span of 2 years?
"Oh that pass was tipped, thank god, that would have been ugly if he just missed by that much lmao"
When do we start worrying about the offense lol
"That route was shit by Snead, why did he meander across the defenders face... stay flat and he woulda had an easy catch"
"Oh look, when we run the ball we score! Imagine that..."
It‚Äôs amazing how much this offense has regressed!
WHY ARE WE NOT TAKING DEEP SHOTS?!?!?!?
That‚Äôs a catch unfortunately.
Is John Fox consulting our offense?
Let's not go 3 and out after getting the ball at halftime ok
"Ugh, I kinda want the Browns to beat Pittsburgh to give them their first loss and tighten the race."
The Ravens won't be satisfied until every offensive player has a false start.
When the offense is struggling against the 1-3-1 eaglesüòêüòêüòê
Finally a good drive and touchdown
Not bad for a quarterback
29 consecutive games of 20+ points. I'm so tired of the whining.
"Blame is on Ward for that td, why tf would you do that"
looking like we shouldnt have got rid of hurst
10 penalties for us today. Most of them are pre-snap and mental errors. Absolutely awful.
These past 3 games have felt like the same  game over and over again ... we‚Äôre getting so spoiled we find blowouts boring
These Lamar stats aren't even too bad but to the eye everything looks plain bad
I swear the refs has it out for us
"idc what anyone says, our offense has looked decent and the only reason this game is close is cause of penalties. if we clean those up we'll beat pittsburgh"
Are we allowed to start worrying now or?
Judon may be the most useless defender in the NFL
"12 penalties and 132 penalty yards. 

FUCK. THESE. REFS"
"For the first time in his career, Judon made a play that was not a penalty."
We are **so fucking lucky** they missed that field goal in the 2nd quarter...
"Proche was a really good pick, haven't seen a 6th rounder contribute this much for a long time"
"*Ravens: 4-1 and up 17-0 at half*

Ravens sub: WTF ROMAN OMG LAMAR IS DEAD FIRE EVERYONE WE ARE REBUILDING THIS YEAR WHOS THE NEXT QB IN THE DRAFT"
And some of u clowns were really questioning our QB
You can tell someone is a newfan when they give up faith after a couple bad drives
Bro in order to pick up a 3rd and 30 you gotta throw it 30 yards downfield not 5
"we get the ball back , but  it would be nice to score again but they wont lol"
We're honestly lucky it's not 17-14 lol
"Some of y‚Äôall: Ravens are done, team sucks move them to Indy and give the Steelers the division."
#Cut Boykin!!!
The offense needs to fucking exist on the next drive or the game could become uncomfortable.
Y‚Äôall doubting we could do it can fuck off lol. You‚Äôve gotta have faith no matter what
"I swear our fans are so spoiled, yeah it‚Äôs been a rough game for sure but how the hell do I see so many people in this subreddit give up on Lamar. If you can‚Äôt handle this please leave, your bandwagon fandom is not welcomed."
"So, sure the eagles came back and made them sweat. But they had literally ten plays that were just straight toss ups, untimely penalties that kept them in the game and every single bounce go their way (fumble for an td).

It wasn‚Äôt pretty but it wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it is right now."
I'm not tipping shit to Philly. Only got close because of shitty officiating.
We need to make a move for a offensive player. No juice from our wr core
Poor Campbell. He signed here because he thought it was the best chance at a Super Bowl. Oh well.
"1 rushing play doesn‚Äôt go as intended.

Greg Roman: I smell 60 pass attempts"
"So far the Eagles D looks good against the run, but our D looks amazing. 3rd 3 and Out. Eagirls haven't even gotten a first down"
The offense fucking sucks
Our boys got the dropsies again
"I don't want to hear any shit for calling for Roman's head. Sure we're good...and if we win we'll be 5-1, but this offense has serious struggles. We get into 3rd and Longs and have a terrible passing game(Lamar hasn't been as good this year) and a lot of it comes from Culley and Roman."
Offense looks shitty yet we are winning 17-0
Lamar is playing like shit lately
"Baker mayfield:

4-10, 43 YDS, 2 INT 2 Sacks 

https://ifunny.co/picture/the-baker-mayfield-cycle-play-like-inferior-opponent-mentality-dwqUZJt57"
Lamar needs to stop throwing side and changing his arm angle every throw when the pocket is clean it either gets tipped or it's inaccurate. I understand when hes on the run and try and fit it in tight windows but no need for it in the pocket.
"*3rd and 30*

*screen for 6 yards*"
"Yeesh, our offense isn‚Äôt even close to the boogeyman that we were last year.

Guess we‚Äôre back to a defensive primary identity again."
I do not like this play calling
[deleted]
This offence can‚Äôt be happy with how they are performing.
WORST FUCKING 57 SECONDS IVE EVER SEEN WTF ARE WE DOING
We shut these punks out like we should have done Cincinnati
Once again I think we need to pass our way out of this funk. Lamar is a semi-cold 3 pt shooter right now.
I'm on your head today Roman. What's up with the soft playcalling?
The one thing you don‚Äôt do is take a sack there.... Lamar plays hero ball way too often...
I bet we don‚Äôt score any this half
"Vintage Jackson didn't spend that long trying to buy time.

OG Jackson use to just takeoff and gone."
How do you like that Lamar haters?
"""Fuckers in r/nfl telling me, always in the barber shop
""Lamar Jackson ain't 'bout this, Lamar Jackson ain't 'bout that""
My boy a BD on fucking Lamron and them
He, he, they say that nigga don't be putting in no work
Shut the fuck up
Y'all niggas ain't know shit
All y'all motherfuckers talkin' about
""Lamar Jackson ain't no hitter
Lamar Jackson ain't this
Lamar Jackson a fake""
Shut the fuck up
Y'all don't live with that nigga
Y'all know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
Shootin' at the police and shit
Nigga been on probation since fuckin' I don't know when
Motherfucker, stop fuckin' playin' him like that
Them niggas savages out there
If I catch another motherfucker talking sweet about Lamar Jackson
I'm fucking beatin' they ass
I'm not fucking playin' no more
Y'all know them niggas roll with Lil Reese and them""
- Love Llama"
browns getting exposed
"Hump gave up the play to hightower but the playcall put him on an island...

I don't like when humphrey is on an island while playing in the slot. He's much better as a boundary corner in that respect."
"RUN THE BALL. USE GUS OR JK. PASS TO DUVERNAY. BE SMART. PLAY SMART.

PLEASE"
Tuck God.
Lamar has actually played pretty well today. I give him a B-
We 100% deserve to lose if they comeback
"This is what happens when you rely too heavy in your Defence. 

Lamar and co have got to do something now"
"These refs cant keep only calling holds on one fucking team, fuck these pieces of shit"
"Oh great, another penalty. Harbaugh can yell at the ref all he wants, he needs to be yelling at Marty and his offense.

Edit: Ok, Roman not Marty. Basically the same thing this season."
My NaMe iS gReG rOmAn AnD i GeT fIrEd FoR oBvIoUs ReAsOnS
"God damn it, please don‚Äôt blow this.."
We are really about to give up a TD huh?
"Crazy that we didn‚Äôt have a single penalty until the score was 17-0 and we were driving again mid second then we accumulated 13 consecutive penalties since then while the eagles have gotten 1. We must really be undisciplined, huh?"
Judon only does stuff when he‚Äôs unblocked idc
Welcome back to the flacco era I guess
"So if we can hang on to win this it's probably the best of both worlds. Keep pace in the division, but have all that work to do going into the bye before Pitt."
Fuck the refs
"Lol they scored once, why are you all acting like whiney babies?"
"So are you ‚Äúanyone who criticizes the offense is bandwagon‚Äù guys ready to acknowledge that our offense does, in fact, have some pretty serious issues?"
This team is just shitting the bed completely on offense again. We're lucky Philly is awful.
wE aRe So UnGrAtEfUl FaNs BeCaUsE wE aRe 4-1 AnD cOmPlAiNiNg AbOuT oUr OfFeNsE
[deleted]
Fuck this giving up play calling.
With this offense Pittsburgh is going to destroy us
Why is our offense so stagnant? I just don't get it. RUN THE BALL
This eagles offense is worst than Flaccos absolute worst üíÄüíÄüíÄüòÇ kinda feel bad for them
Didn‚Äôt Lamar loose a close friend recently? Some of y‚Äôall need to chill.
"Roman, wtf was that? 1st and 35, all 3 play calls were short yardage plays..."
Stop with the downvotes. It was a damn catch. Credit where credit is due.
Were making fun of Bakers numbers but besides the INTs almost identical to Lamars
I love how a bad day for jackson is considered a great game for every other qb in the league
"Another missed sack, another wide open recevier."
Peters keeps fucking giving up finish the damn play dude
Lol we are fucking frauds
Lamar is a BAD passer this year
I‚Äôm really hoping I can find a single ticket to the Steelers game in 2 weeks. The ones for Browns Steelers are going for 390 on ticketmaster üò≠ I‚Äôd imagine our prices would be about the same.
Let's go bois
Any Ravens fans in Philly rn?
So is Marlon covering #13 on eagles right?
We should run over these guys.  Pound the Rock!
How many punchouts will Marlo get?
What the fuck is this schedule commercial? LMFAO.
Front on these moes!!!
LFG FLOCKGANG
"Threw out my back so i'm watching from bed.

LESGO FLOCK!!!"
Let‚Äôs GOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!
#WE ON DEFENSE FIRST BOIZ
Starting on D
Yo bat man is in the stadium
Lets go boys
American tv and their god damn adverts
Is it just my TV or do the Eagles uniforms look kinda blue?
Calais gonna getcha!
Great start
Burrow is watching this like ‚Äúit haunts me‚Äù lol
Great start on d
"First 2 plays lost yards, let's go D!!"
our d-line seems to be improving
Defense is on FIRE
Wentz going to be sacked 10 times today    üòÇüòÇ
Gonna be a long day for Wentz
Calais!
"Wow, good thing he dropped that..."
F in the chat for Wentz
Holy cow he dropped it.  How is he open?
He had us beat thanks for the drop
We got lucky af. Wtf happened there?
Cmon MP
"he had the pass, just dropped it, we got lucky"
Thank God the Eagles are big fucking suck otherwise that's a huge play. Peters what are you doing baby..?
Wow we were lucky. That was a great start and there was some form of awful busted coverage.
We got so fucking lucky lol
Lol 3rd and 22 almost turned into a disaster for us.
You guys are so quick to bench people lol
"Like that's an option play, but not one that fooled anyone. Last year I had no clue who has the ball half the time."
This is why we throw to Duv
DUUUUUUV
I love that we actually used a bunch formation to help get a player open.  This is what we need in the passing game.
DUUUUUUUUUUUUVVVVVVVVV
#DUUUUUUUUUV
"Rush rush pass. Rush rush pass. 

Hmm..."
free him please harbaugh
What a play!
Bruh
Damn son
That was just.. Mmhmm
I love it
That still wasn‚Äôt a clean drive. Keep stacking reps and getting better. End of the season these guys are going to look so good
FEELING GOOD TODAY!
"Okay, cover the receivers now."
They really don't trust Wentz to throw it
Be better offense line
Second time we got away with a dropped pass there
"Dang my NFL app stream is really far behind, which is unusual"
yikes...
oh he got oofed. hope he's ok
"We could use more pass rush off the edge, but the d line has been doing a great job at pushing in the interior. We‚Äôve gotten pressure up the center and have been way better against the run. I really like what Calais Campbell is doing for this team"
First time I'm really seeing our defensive line looking dominant all season
i love these BB commercials lmao
Damn Ingram looks hurt
Wtf
He hurt his shoulder
"strategy for philly defensively: cry, and pray"
ingram no i hope you're ok
Scary
Yikes man
I‚Äôve never bit my tongue so hard
JFC
Will we ever run a play from under center?!?!
What are these play calls??? Stop having Lamar throw slants when we need 10+ yards for the first allow him to throw it down the damn field
The offense is still dead
"Cowboys fan here, we're counting on you to keep the nfc east trash for us so I'm cheering for you"
"Heres the offensive game plan.  Run for 2 yards, Pass: incomplete, Pass: Incomplete, Punt.  Repeat until D gifts you a turnover."
I'm trying not to panic about this game but... I'm definitely worried about our o-line and offense this year
I've been frustrated by play-calling but today's game feels like Lamar is just really off. Even the completions have been super iffy.
"&#x200B;

FUMBLE!

Ravens recooer"
Wtf is this game lol
LOL
That‚Äôs a fumble
The hell was that pitch about
Elliot's foot is under Wentz's knee.
HOT POTATO
"Also, my toddler has learned how to turn off the cable box. Unrelated: I‚Äôm selling a cute toddler: anyone want one?"
That's close gotta stand though
Ball was moving before the knee was down.
That is a fumble! I haven't seen anyone this ball hungry since Ginger Lynn
Nice work by Elliot
"All the offensive problems are in execution. LJ needs to be slightly more accurate and receivers need to catch the damn ball.

Hot take, play calls have been ok"
Damn one if these times Lamar will keep god damnit
that's a fumble
Dope dope
Fumble 100%
Ball's coming out way before the knee is down
Refs are so flag happy they literally throw inadvertent flags at least once a game. Pathetic
These simple run plays are key. 3 yards right there
I miss the RPO.
"Our offense is not playing well. At the same time, what‚Äôs wrong with this team being the old defensive monster Ravens, but with a more exciting offense that can make plays."
I think it's one of those situations where there's not enough to change the on-field call regardless of which way they called it
Our backs are working so damn for 2-3 yard gains
Maybe the offense will have a chance at scoring this drive
We should go back to the basics I feel Roman trying to be cute with his play calling
"Great D.

I need some Gus in my life"
I want to see us get Hollywood involved around the redzone
"Run, run, run...."
Yessssssss
Gus is the man!
Nice run by gus
Putting it on them mushroom stamp style.
Awe yeah
ALL ABOARD!
Love this team
"Fly Ravens fly, on the road to victory!

R A V E N S RAVENS!"
Glad we finally did something after those last two terrible possessions.
We‚Äôre so lucky the eagles are trash but great teams are suppose to trash bad teams so we‚Äôre doing our job!
I would love to start using the pistol less and get to more traditional shotgun in neutral situations more
"That‚Äôs how you block, offensive line! Keep it up!"
One thing bad about all this success is all the bandwagons. I don‚Äôt want the Ravens to be the Warriors of the NFL
"Browns disappointing, per usual"
"Do you guys think this cardboard guy was paid as an actor or as a model???

Edit: Oh, nevermind"
Sacked !
Damn 12 total yards
His own player almost sacked him LMAO
It's fun seeing the Ravens D dominate again.
His oline should get the 0.5 sack lol
Love hearing those boos
Defense mad they didn't get the shutout last week
100% hurts will play the 2nd half
LET'S GO DEFENSE!!!!
Wentz almost got sacked by his own team.
"I feel the pain of Eagles fans, man"
What are the odds that we can get Wentz benched before of our D?
Were those the first boos from eagles fans?
These Eagles are very likely to go to the playoffs
A Snead sighting!
That was close Willie
Snead gave me a heart attack just now. Good catch!
Well that's it for Snead
Have the eagles even gotten a first down yet?
Another TD and this game is probably over frfr
"I knew they were fucked from the first play of the game. If you let us rush 4 and get pressure, you're toast lol"
MY HEART
The Eagles have 3 yards of total offense so far. This defense is ridiculous
Good to see Snead involved. Fumble is a rare thing tbf.
Our d is really good! Makes me so happy to see a smothering ravens defense!
Someone make a ‚ÄòLamars off‚Äô bot
Dodged a bullet there
First appearance by willie snead this season lol and he fumbled
More plays like that tho
Jesus christ it's a good thing we are playing the Eagles. Mistakes like this against the Steelers and we are in trouble.
Snead! Snead?.. Snead.
"me: YES a nice catch and run, no dropped pass

snead: lets drop it during the run"
"omg, lamar took the intermediate crosser!"
Snead has to be more careful there.  He has to know he's gonna get caught from behind.
Nice draw play
And that's a quick way to ride some pine. Finish the play and hold the fucking ball
God we‚Äôre getting lucky today
One of my neighbors is a big Philly fan.  If we win I light spend some extra time outside wearing my jersey.
Every time Ingram gets in the open he looks as though he‚Äôs about to trip
We dominated cindy and they are up 21 to 0
God damn sneed thank god you were close to the sideline
Give it to Gus holy crap
"That defensive line getting penetration on second down was concerning. That being said, the refs missed the facemask on Gus"
GOAT!
Come on Dobbie
Lol. At least our defense has been exciting
"I'd go for it, give the offense more reps"
22 straight quarters scoring now. [Also thanks for giving them love CBS](https://youtu.be/IYwXUxgszF0)
It‚Äôs just fucking automatic with him
Dobbie has Drop..
People suggesting that catch was hard for dobbins need to be put down jfc
lmao pete carrol talking about a game plan not making it
Koch corralling the high snap like a boss
Love tucker
My iPhone can shoot an EMP now? Is that a violation of the Geneva Convention?
Biggest indicator of how good our locker room is is Peters coming in making a tackle attempt.  Used to see him begging off tackles.
I missed Gus the Bus TD FUCK
Wowowowow
"Taking bets for Marlon's first FF today, my money is on before halftime"
Damn the D is playing so well today
"Quite a lot of illegal formations already today, line judge is not playing with either team"
Look at his emotion! Hes fired up!!!!
CALAIS!
Side note: it's been real nice to see how chill this game thread has been so far!
Thats a good punt from Philly
Why would you make a mustang an suv?
thank you EDC for this blessing
This is old school ravens football and I fucking love in.
If the D has suddenly woken up and plays like this every week we may not even need 2019 LJ
"Lamar needs to throw better, what is wrong"
Wtf was that pass?
Lamar needs like an intensive throwing camp over the bye week
JK!!
"Here we go, finally a play where you have no clue has the ball for a sec"
"Nice draw play, fool their line."
the lamar guaranteed 10 yard scramble
Draws are working today
Turns out I hate Leblanc
Some one mute the trumpet!
JK DOBBINS HELL YEAH
dobbins!!! that's what we want to see
Currently a >97% chance of victory according to ESPN
"JK is a keeper, I like seeing him increasingly more. He'll be RB1 next year."
I love these draw plays. Huge gains on 1st downs with them.
Dobbins is good when he gets multiple touches
Fuck
This O line is üí©
Lamar out here making my heart explode protect yoself man
Did we bench Powers for Tyre Phillips?
Nothing hits quite like that first ice cold miller lite on gameday
Okay I get the false starts and shit but that's two calls for Oline not on the line.
Yay another flag
.... Another flag.
It really irks me that we seem to always break out of the huddle with fuck all time left on the play clock
"What the fuck man, effectively killed this drive"
Goddamn ANOTHER flag?
Harbs needs to get up in this line's asshole
"Refs calling everything, WTF!!! >:( >:( >:("
ANOTHER PENALTY WHAT THE FUCK
Lol let‚Äôs just keep moving it on back
What the hell
Going backwards
MAKE THAT SIX FLAGS FROM THE OLINE HOLY SHIT
How many flags can we get on one series?
Ravens what in the FUCK are you doing right now?
Just punt.
Browns benefited from beating up on shit teams. This division is going to be a dogfight between us and Pittsburgh. Cleveland still can't compete.
Come the fuck on with the flags bro
Bruh the o-line is going full retard right now
Fucking Offensive line is bullshit
let's get a false start here and make it 1st & 30
We are the only team in the NFL getting called for these lmao
Lamar obviously doesn't like this o line
I'm fucking done with Roman. Can't wait until a terrible organization offers this clown a HC job.
1st & 35.  Lol.
1st and 35..?
"Oh so we don't call facemasks on our running back but now we call everything. 

I feel like this is an anti-battery drive"
refs are fucking killing us wtf
Lamar deep ball incoming
Harbs about to stroke out
The refs just feel bad I guess.
Marquise Brown and Mark Andrews are nonexistent
WTF IS THIS LACK OF DISCIPLINE?
These refs are spazzing out with these flags
Time for JK Dobbins to show that he‚Äôs really Ray Rice Jr.
"Fuck it, 3 deep shots"
???????????
I almost forgot that you could get holding calls in the NFL.
1&35 :O
1st and 35 lmao
Another tipped pass
Love it when opposing teams are getting smashed and they celebrate the littlest things haha
This possession looked like pure shit
Offensive focus is just not there. You can see it drive by drive. When it‚Äôs all locked in it looks great for a drive
"That was pretty pathetic, but it wasn't Lamar's fault. Now him only throwing these sidearm passes is kind of worrying"
Damn this commercial is slapping right now. Good shit lol
Where is my mind is such a song.
"I don't think Lamar is letting the play develop enough, I don't think Roman is just calling slants. Lamar is passing to the checkdowns."
"You would think that an offense that has to practice against our defense would be better. But then again, I remember the days when they also had to practice against Goose, AD, and Ray."
"just tuned in, offense still looking off?"
Lol the ravens are team Jalen I guess
Very few teams if any would throw long passes on 3rd and 30 guys. Its not smart.
Anyone remember that lady that used to bring a duck call to games. Sat in the 500‚Äôs and wouldn‚Äôt stop blowing that fucker. I‚Äôm getting flashbacks.
Good for jalen
hey that's our move
Ian Eagle was so impressed by that 3 yard gain
Is hurts the new Kaep?
They've run a new play every play this drive lmao they really want it
"Falcons vs Vikings and Washington vs Giants lol, absolutely pathetic"
This game should be called the Wooder bowl
Philly is out here pulling the Madden plays what the fuck is going on. Also is this the beginning of Wentz‚Äôs benching?
Did Ward even touch the ground
No catch
Incomplete
Are they blind? It looked like the second foot bounced in bounds
You gotta be fucking kidding me
Lame. Ah well.
catch
Ridiculously unlucky that his knee fell on Marlon‚Äôs foot
2nd lucky drop for us
Lmfao!! Best pass of the day. Beautiful rainbow for nothing
"kinda crazy that if marlons' foot isnt there, it might not be a catch"
[deleted]
"I love the sun 

No eagles shall see the ball!"
lollll. YIKES
Eagles settle for a Field Goal
Eagles gonna eagle lol
SHORT!
S h o r t
Didn‚Äôt get it!
That's the Eagles season summed up in a nutshell right there with Sanders dropping the wide open TD pass and then Wentz not getting the fourth down conversion.
No way he got that
100% short
If we can get points this last minute we sitting real pretty
You get nothing!
#Shutout in tact
Feel like an option play with Hurts there would've converted that.
They should've kept that other guy in. lol
Lmao Eagles
gotta feel bad for wentz
Lol how is it under review lol
gottem
Now its under review? What were we just doing? Lol
Woooooo
We already did 99yds drive with under one minute left. Let's repeat that!
"If we score again before half time, just bring out RG3 when we come back."
A quick drive down for 3 wouldn't be bad. 6 even better.
So why did we not try to go get a FG? That‚Äôs the first time in a long time that didn‚Äôt happen
Why not try and make something happen in the last 50something seconds??
I don't get it.  We almost had a full minute.  Should be trying to drive down the field and take it to zero.
Wtf. Why did we kill the clock but call a timeout earlier?
Force a turnover on first down and get some points before the half.
they're gonna call tucker and try for an FG
McPhee noooooo
PHEEEEEEE YOU GOT TO GRAB THAT!!!
ALMOST CALLED THAT COME ON MCPHEE
Roman saw the sub and said you fuckers wanted to see more runs lol
They're about to come back out with Hurts. Wentz looks.... Hurt.
Holy shit so close
How did he not catch thatüòÜ
Juuust over his head!
lmao McPhee. come on dude
mcphee lol
Greg Roman need to cut that ugly mullet off.
"guys, im pretty sure it's the head coach john's call to be conservative at that point of the game.. it'a not greg roman. he is given the plan and draws up the plays according to it."
[deleted]
Throw that Hail Mary and there‚Äôs a decent chance of a pick six
"""You don't take your time outs to get the ball back late to just hand the ball off""

Disagree."
"Well, that‚Äôs annoying"
"Damn, that sounds like something Judon would do"
Ahhh Calais taking a page out of the Judon playbook
BALL DONT LIE
Block and return it let's gooooo
"omg that pick was taken away for a rouging the passer, what a catch Clark lol"
That's what they get
#THAT AIN'T ~~FALCO~~ TUCKER
Nope.  Boo birds out in Philly
Fucking bullshit roughing call.
Bumass Eagles did all that for nothing
Glad he missed. Shouldn‚Äôt have had the opportunity to kick it anyways
"ha-ha 

&#x200B;

No gimmies"
LOL
ball don't lie
"Eagles have some problems, they are not gonna win very many games this year if this is how they are gonna play. The NFC East as a whole is so fucking bad this year. 6 wins could be enough to take the division."
Damn I hope we bring it to Pitt. Fuck that team
"holy crap I forgot we started on defense, W"
"Lamar will get right, but we need to see it now."
"All of our games in the beginning of last season looked like this. Remember the Cardinals?

Also remember no preseason is hurting our VERY young offense. Lamar also didn‚Äôt get to work with his throwing coach during the off season like he did last year."
‚ÄúSee More Hurts‚Äù sounds like the announcers are wishing for injuries.
Embarrassing
"Its like, have we played offense before??"
This sidearm bullshit has GOT to go
"We need a guard, my god."
Bengals blew a big lead.
"THAT""S MY MF QB"
I'm honestly not too confident in a 17 point lead. We saw their offense can do stuff when hurts came in. And we have yet to really score just from our offense. All 17 points have been from defensive play.
Seriously though what is up with the O-Line and penalties today
What the fuck! These penalties
False start michael oher
"Fuck if Duvernay turns that into a fly route he is wide open and gone

Edit oops may have been Proche actually"
"Wtf, did these guys drink 20 cups of coffee before the game? xD"
That‚Äôs the Lamar I know and love!!!
Finally Andrews gets a catch
Andrews site
Draft oline
"Way too many penalties by the offensive line today. I guess I‚Äôm their defense, this is one of the best defensive fronts in the nfl"
Wow our OL is sucking collective ass right now
These penalties are disgusting
I mean do we want to play or just keep getting flags
DUUUUUUUUU!
Odds on Skura getting a flag at some point
Duvernay should be WR 1 lol
average of 10 yards to go on 3rd down jfc
Hollywood!!!
Love that play. Chiefs do it all the time and we should be doing it more too
Roman is Cam Cameron in the pass game sometimes. A big reliance on iso routes for the WRs
He would've scored if he didn't fall üò°
Tripped over air again.
It's spreading to the TE now
"Definitely having a sloppy game tbh. It's okay it happens, but sloppy still."
No one open...
Ugly punt by Sam.  Is it windy?
Fuck these flags
Throw it away instead of costing us points!
"They need a bye, this is shitshow level offense"
"I just don't get why we are so bad on offense, penalty after penalty same boring play calling. SOmething needs to change fast."
"Jesus. We cannot take advantage of 1on1 on the outside. Between the numbers and the sideline.

Eagles are a pro team and wins in the NFL are hard as hell. You rarely see a spread higher than 13.5 points. Just wanting our O to take that next step. If we can hit them at 50%, my gosh."
What the fuck...
Defense can only carry the game for so long.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
Everytime I notice Judon I am miffed
Well shit.
YOOOO WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT
fucking judon....
Well FUCK
Fucking Hurts bro!
smhhhhhhhhhhh
Offense needs to wake the hell up now
Mark Ingram out for the rest of the game
Going for two was....an interesting choice?
Hurts holds on to that option for wayyy too long.
We‚Äôre so unlucky lol
Ingram is our for the game
I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre not just gonna get by on the other team being awful. This team needs to be punched in the mouth. Hopefully they realize whatever has been going on with this team isn‚Äôt good enough.
Pederson's a fuckin moron going for two lol
The Baltimore Duvernay's
Durvernay needs more touches. Dudes a jet.
I feel like Duvernay is becoming a Tyreek type better than Hollywood has
Much better Roman
good pass
Run game is not where it was last year either. Not just the pass game.
Aye see what happens when you drop back and step into a non-side arm throw my man Lamar
Now go for 2 here.
Wow they really just left the second level of the defense completely open.
lol easy mode. This team is fucking silly.
That was a great drive
Let‚Äôs go!!
"nice run from lamar, we should do that more often"
YOU LOVE TO SEE IT
Lamar Action MVP Jackson üòé
LAMARRRRRRRR!!
Awesome drive there. Great response to the TD
"That is the same running play Lamar scored his 52 yard TD run against WFT on. 

Scary to see our franchise QB running between the tackles, but that play is pretty filthy."
[deleted]
Confirmed today that Davis is the best announcer outside of the boi Romo
We beating that Steelers record?
Our offense is fucking nasty when we are calling plays to score points.  It just seems like when we are up big our offense switches to protect Lamar mode and our offense doesn't work when Lamar isn't taking zone reads.
What was that Oline man doing lmao
I fucking love every player on our defense.
Man that dudes fucking huge
That move makes me think that Campbell probably doesn‚Äôt fight a slice on the golf course
Marlo again lmao
HUMP PUNCH
It bothers me that the eagles are in the running for their division with such a garbage oline
Campbell is just so large
"""No Mas"" ~ Wentz"
That punch lmaoo
Marlon punch!
18-3 is a weird score......
Theres our marlo ff üí™
"marlon with ANOTHER punch out, my god what a stud"
The Eagles are really dropping the ball
Fruit Punch strikes again
Defense nasty. Swag
"Bengals were up 21-0, It's 27-21 Bengals now, Colts came back."
"You're better off not having the ball anywhere around Marlon. Legit, don't throw towards him, don't be running near him, stay the fuck away from him."
What the fuck is Marlon's training regimen? Dude is Rocky Balboa
What was the plan there Roman?
"The eagles need hurts in the game. w/o him in as a runner/decoy, their offense has been dreadful."
Marlon been doing that one punch man workout
Ah shit. Phillips ran off the field. Hope he okay.
"Whoever that guys who asked me why I thought our O-line would seriously regress, and disagreed with me. Fuck you."
Seems like boikins always makes a bad play every game now
Wait why is it declined?
they ran into Koch
Why did we decline that?
"IDK what it is, but Boykin doesn't seem to know the right playcall because I've seen him multiple times not run the right route that Lamar throws"
Why did we decline that? Is it a re-kick?
Running into the kicker is only 5 yards.....roughing the kicker is 15 yards and a first down
Humph lucky there was no flag there.
Jimmy still got it!
Nice play Jimmay
Nice play by jimmy
"Holy shit, based Jimmy Smith."
Jimmy Smith looks like he's in SB47 form.
Dude we need to catch one of these easy fucking picks.
The streams are sucking ass rn
Why was peters playing so far off of someone he‚Äôs faster than?
Surprised no flag tbh
I think that was roughing
"wentz saw the rush and was like ""f this, I'm out"""
"Campbell needs to do a ""Goose Flop"""
Oh fuck off
Stupid play!
I swear our guys that struggle to get to the QB always go for the late hit just to say they did something.
Omfg
They‚Äôve been hitting him late almost every play. C‚Äômon guys the man isn‚Äôt even playing well let him be.
I hate it
Almost a late hit by judon there again
Jihad ward trying to let the eagles cover
Damn who pissed him off lol
"This defense and RTP penalties in dumb moments against bad teams.

Name a more iconic duo."
Just a little bit open lol
JIHAD nooooo!
Titans this L today.
Even though we dont look amazing offensively I still love out tem hope we can improve
Same situation as the Houston game. We good
He did hurt himself god damn it
We need this bye week so badly man.
Mekari in instead of Tyre
Titans might lose üëÄ
Nick Boyle has sure hands man
#FEEDTHEBOYLE
Nice pass LaMar
Great catch by Boyle
Jackson can throw darts but really hasn‚Äôt shown many good touch/loft throws at all. Need to open lanes again with the run game for that to be successful like last season.
Nick boyle is the star of the offense today. Thats sad
Tuck!
Ravens offense going for the minimally viable product.
Alright D needs to focus up
Just business as usual for Tucker!
"That accuracy, my goodness!"
Can't cuck the tuck !
Just no flags please
"With our defense playing better, I think this team will be making trade for some offensive help before the deadline"
Not sure this was a hot decision tbh. It's still a game.
Jimmy Smith never stops being good
Pour one out for Wentz
Jimmy is balling the fuck out today
Lmao Bengals are losing?!?
Always loved Jimmy
"Stop playing with Jimmy today, man"
jimmy again!
"Lmao, did Peter's just fall down on his own?"
Jimmy Smith has had a hell of a game!
Deshaun Watson is incredible
The O-line is going to be gassed with all the extra reps they will be getting
Lol another illegal formation. Absolutely brutal
WHAT THE FUCK
WHAT THE FUCK HOW IS THIS HAPPENING
#LEARN TO LINE UP??
Jesus christ lol this has to be our worst game for penalties in a long time.
I can‚Äôt stand this interior offensive line
O-line is absolutely pathetic except Stanley
Literally beating ourselves
"Mekari should consider playing for the Chiefs, wouldn't be a hold there."
[deleted]
How many penalties is that? Has to be over a dozen on O right?
Jesus Christ
this oline can't even line up properly
But we cant get Holding or a facemask? lol
The announcer is right.  Sloppy af offense.
Whole team needs to run 10 laps around the stadium after the game
"We should have our guys, especially the Linemen, run gassers because of all the penalties."
"Dawg. These fucking offensive penalties are insane

Anyone yelling at Lamar should redirect it at the o-line"
This offense is sloppy as fuck. They need a huge wake up call.
The middle of this game was rough for a minute but still an improvement over last week in my eyes
This has to be a coaching issue...
our oline needs so much help
Gonna be a pretty aggressive film study this week from Harbs this week
"This may be the most offensive penalties I have seen one team have in a game, wtf is happening"
I rewound to look at both of those lined up in the backfield and I just don't see it.
"All right. I'm switching to Texans-Titans for a moment, lol."
Holy war ward
Wow Driscoll was like a third string tackle wasn‚Äôt he?
Eagles players just keep dropping today
"Eagles = Chargers, NFC east variant"
LMAO. Someone was unhappy about a push off.
I think coaching is trying to develop the O line and passing game with these bad teams but the penalties are unnecessary. Give Lamar the proper line and he‚Äôs gonna shine but he can‚Äôt shine if he keeps getting set back.
DPOY
Holy fuck what a sack was that
You're going to let Wentz do that?!
Nice run. He's a warrior
Damn they made Wentz look like Derrick Henry
What the fuck was that by Queen??
"Marlon yelling ""push off"" on that 3rd and 8 but will not be heard. Gets the sack the very next play"
carson 'lamar jackson's wentz
Gotta be kidding me lol
Fucking game is not over yet. Wtf
Tennessee are no joke.
Wait the other team is allowed to get called for holding too?
Were they trying to tackle him or give him a high five
That should never happen
TACKLE HIM
"Pathetic..our d sucks. No way we beat  x team. Insert coordinator needs to be fired 


/s"
New England is Below 500 for the first time in october in over a decade
A penalty on the... EAGLES??!
!!! A HOLDING AGAINST THE OTHER TEAM? THEY EXIST!
Titans/texans game is tied
shit jimmy just injured himself it looked like
Fucking Titans
COME ON HOUSTON
Jimmy hurt again
This shit is just dragging
Great coverage by Peters!
Anyone seen Judon this game?
I LOVE THE JOKER
#PICK
JOKER SZN
THA JOKER
"He didn‚Äôt catch it, hit the ground"
**GAME OVER**
It‚Äôs tha joka baby üòé
#JOKER
Fuck
Ahhh damn no pick
Joker for real
Ref sounded like he was cryin
JOKER!!!!!!!!
Longest 4 minutes of my life.
That was... Bad.
JFC
Marlo is so viscious when he's going for the ball
LMFAO
"Lol judon is pissed that the one good play he‚Äôs had all game, wentz got the ball out"
That was one angry tackle by Marlo LOL
the hell was that
How the actual fuck did that happen? Good lord.....
Wow I hate it
Fucking come on.
Anyone wanna tell me how that's okay?
"I would be annoyed at the defense, but I'm more annoyed at the offense for not putting this away..."
Judon literally hit him while he was trying to throw downfield and STILL couldn't finish the sack...
"COME ON MAN

WHY IS THIS A GAME"
PAIN
Marlo looks like a fucking piranha when he‚Äôs taking people down üòÇ
Fuck this
This is absurd. This game should‚Äôve been over so many times
"This game sucks ass, refs have made this a game"
What a swing from a game ending pick
We really blowing this aren‚Äôt we
"I swear, if Greg Roman calls some BS here"
Peters gettin victimized. I think he is hurt.
Has Philly gotten a single flag on them?
Eagles are not pushovers with a rookie QB like the Bengals are and we're learning that rn.
Marcus Peters is literally limping why was he out there
Dudes are tired on defense. This whole fucking abortion is because we choose not to run the ball.
Gotta give it to whoever's calling the Eagles' plays. They're figuring out what works
what the fuck
Houston lost. Fuck
"Besides some trick plays are defense played Great, this game is on the offense (particularly the oline) since they kept putting the defense out there after so many 3 and outs"
Why is our hands team not there
Block someone pls
I didn't think I'd be nervous going into the final 4 minutes of this game
Are you fucking kidding me with these flags man
OH LOOK ANOTHER PENALTY
"And holding, of course."
This shit is inexcusable
HOW did Cincy lose?
LOLOLOLOLOL WUT ARE WE DOING
Eagles jersey grabbing every single fucking play when they're on offence and these morons close their eyes but when we have the ball they've got supersight
Sorry but Lamar and the line has fucked us in this one.
"You're welcome, Eagles fans."
I hate this
Screw the refs bruh. NFL's a complete joke...
Holding calls kill drives
"Fuck, guys. I‚Äôm a little nervous. Trust the D though."
I am actually angry right now
Does anyone think we will get a timely stop here?
I turned it off a few mins ago to watch TN/Hou WTF happened?!?!
We have no momentum rn
CAN WE PLEASE NOT BLOW THIS GAME. FOR FUCKS SAKE
Zeus has been getting pushed back all game so he can't actually roll out to the right
Now we gotta be worried when we are down 10 and up 17
I‚Äôll give it to him there nobody was open at *all*
Lol Jesus christ
Really great defense - but we should have run it to get them to take their final TO or atleast a PA.
Dude stay in bounds to burn a time out. Wtf
Even if we win this is a pretty uninspiring performance.
Good thing we‚Äôre not playing a good team
3 forced fumbles and no recoveries how bad luck I'd that.
what the fuck
Are people intentionally ignoring the fact that our offense has looked terrible all season and was ranked 25th before this game? Schemes gotta change
WHAT?!?!?
We are so boned against the Squeelers
Peters is a fucking idiot. He's had multiple bad games in a row now and may have just lost this one on us.
bruh
That call is a joke.
gotta be shitting me
FUCK THIS
No fucking way man
"Terrible. should've just ran the ball. 

All routes ran to same depth. No checkdown option to keep clock ticking."
Refs are stinking garbage...
Thats bs penalty
"The worst they can do right now is tie, and they need a 2-point conversion to do it. We are capable of stopping them"
Sooooo it‚Äôs on the defense
I‚Äôm tired of refs fucking over my sports teams
wow
Fulgham initiated.
These refs are the worst
WHAT THE FUCK??????
If anything they're either going to tie it up too fast or not tie it up
I hate that the only other game on is WTF and Giants. I don't want to watch that crap either!!
Challenge the flag
Epic diarrhea
Can't wait for the next flag
Fucking bitches
Pathetic.
Yeah
HOLD EM GUYS LETS GO
Give them the td here so there‚Äôs time to get the game winning fg
Feels bad man
"Sorry ass penalties all day, offense taking a giant shit. No one but the ravens to blame"
Don‚Äôt let Judon on the bus home
So pathetic I don't know whether to cry or laugh
Humiliating.
I think our offensive play calling got too cute.
BITCH
Judon heard us
Oh look Judon finally showed up
JUDON CHALUPA!
62 with clearest hold ever. No flag
Im shocked the refs didnt call a penalty
Putrid performance all around.
Who else?  Judon.  LOL
Fucking finally
"Bent, but didn‚Äôt fucking break."
nice hold there on 62
Finally a stop when we need it!!
Let's GOOOOOOO!!! OFFENSE!!! PUT THIS AWAY!!!! >:(
"Aight here we go:

1. Recover the onside kick

2. Get one first down"
Judon=hero
SIT DOWN
"Fuck you, Wentz"
Everyone needs an ass whooping on the bus home. Everyone.
"Wow for all his bad plays this year, Judon might‚Äôve just won us the game. He read that absolutely perfectly."
Ravens will pass now!!!
Now gotta hope we get the onside kick.
OMG JUDON DID SOMETHING GOOD
Offense still needs to kill clock here
My heart rate is spiking
"The eagles scratched and fucking clawed man, my mouth is agape. One of the craziest Fucking games I have seen in a while."
God damn our offense sucks ass this year lol
PROCHE
Proche is a godsend
This was the worst ravens game I have seen in a while.
"Come on, Wentz. Get up and fucking jaw some more."
Yo I honestly thought for a second the eagles picked that up... my heart sank but thank god we got it
Good job Proche
Ugly ugly ugly ugly.
Awesome by proche
I'm still annoyed that we let the eagles make this a game
Game's not over until Lamar kneels lol
That‚Äôs game
Can we seriously do ANYTHING other than shotgun dive up the middle? Jesus.
Ballgamr
Proche has great hands

Ok the way lamar crawled scared the shit out of me lmao
"lamar ICES it, omg if he scored a TD there"
Let Lamar do Lamar things.
Good playcall there
I need to go find a way to get my heart out of stomach now. Gg boys
What is the record for longest game that didn‚Äôt go to overtime? 3 and half hours and counting
Hopefully a close call wakes everyone up
A big relief but this game was waaaay closer than I would have liked it to be
I feel like they were both making contact
"The penalties situation was terrible but they also did put themselves in some situations to be called even if they were bad calls. Refs should be disciplined though esp for that Peters dpi.

That being said, this game was a disaster in general after the first half and we‚Äôre lucky to come out of it. Rest and regroup and learn - this will be a good week for this team to figure out who and what they are before Steelers week which might be the most important game of the year for both squads."
"Lamar looks so much worse as a passer than last year, I don‚Äôt like it at all"
Defenses have figured out Lamar Jackson...
sign Antonio brown
Lamar looks sooo uninspired. Does he even like to play this year
We could legit lose this game with how bad the offense looks.
You just knew the refs weren't going to let philadelphia come away without points
Can‚Äôt blame that one on Roman. Lamar...DO BETTER
"literally every play can be roughing the passer, refs definitely pick when to call em imo"
Wait 14 days and we will play the Steelers and everyone can STFU about whether the Ravens are a good football team.
Dude no fuck this ref crew. They are calling this game so fucking one sided. Eagles are holding constantly. Fuck this.
I've kinda come around on how gloom and doom you guys are because last year I thought you were too cocky and we saw how that turned out so
"Lamar is pissing me off so much right now. I love him, but god does he look bad right now."
Fire Roman
Ingram stuffed? What else is new.
**Touchdown Nick Boyle!**
1.7 yd/rush and Dobbins is getting touches.  GRo is about to abandon the run and I don't blame him.
Let‚Äôs see the people mad that we‚Äôre gonna throw on 3 and 13
No designed runs again for Lamar today?
Are we sure Flacco is on the Jets?
Facemask
These guys are handling balls about as bad as the first girl to give me a blowie in 10th grade
Chris Board wtf you da man
This is just sad. They have nothing.
Lamar come on bruh I know this ain't you. Somethings up
You guys need to chill about hat throw - we're up 17-0 and you're bithcing about one play? How about all the good passes were dropped?
2nd and 30. Better throw a 5 yard hitch
We bout to have a browns-esque down and distance
Browns will never compete in the AFC north
Is our O-line to blame for the offensive regression??
Peters u really gonna get driven back 20 yards by the other team‚Äôs QB?
Good effort but not a catch
Fuck that is a catch
It's closer than you all think. That right foot tapped right as he fell outside.
Did you guys who are saying that's bullshit even watch the replays?
Big stop for the D! Still have time for our own drive
"I agree with not going for points here. Offense has looked bad, a turnover would be horrible."
Don't understand our sudden lack of aggression
Weren't we leading 17-0 last week also? Offense hasn't looked any better tbh
I don‚Äôt understand the complete abandonment of the read option
WHY. DIDNT. YOU. THROW. IT. AWAY.
Fuck this horseshit. That's pathetic.
fumbling into the endzone?
Elliot 2 FF he great
This sub when we‚Äôre still up by 11 and the other team scores anything: ScRaP tHe sEaSoN
Passing game needs to be revitalized and Greg Roman isn‚Äôt exactly known for that
It's funny how all the Lamar hate just completely disappeared.
stupid fucking play man
"This sucks but that's ok, could've easily been a much closer game at this point. Remember we did get lucky those couple times."
"Selfish penalty just gave them 8 points. I'm not really worried about losing this game, like I wasn't worried about losing to Washington last week, but these kind of mistakes are going to make it impossible to win in the playoffs."
How did Lamar possibly miss an open Hollywood on that 3rd and 4? Doesn‚Äôt make sense to me
"Pathetic third down call.

It's 3rd and 4. Call a slant. Call an option run with Lamar. Call a run if you'd like to use more time and maybe get closer than a 55-yard FG.

I'm not trying to be overly negative but holy crap."
What the fuck happened to this oline? Were they just scared of pissing off Yanda or something?
Alright I'm getting pissed now
eagles o-line is a hospital
Good tackle Queen.
Imagine letting the Browns score 7. Pittsburgh's D is trash. Lol
Fuck these god damn refs.
 bruh we had 2 defenders there
We never make it easy üôÑ
Yah. It is hard to fathom that Philly is still in this game.......
Eagles have dominated us this half. Nearly 250 yards
Sure would be nice to have the FG Lamar took the sack to knock us out of range for.
These flags are completely bullshit
No receivers got open
Fire roman
This team won‚Äôt do shit with this offense
Lol
I‚Äôm here so I can have others to wallow with
"Just one play. A Peters pick, a Marlon punchout, please just get a defensive play and end this"
"just stop the 2pt and we good.

I feel bad about this game, but we should still win this"
"Yeah, at this point in the season, we are not a playoff team. We really are not playing to our potential. :("
If judon reads this sub I know he made that play and checked Reddit to see what we‚Äôd say
Hope this game also showed the ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt run the ball enough‚Äù crowd that that is not the issue with our offense.
Lamar's play today has pissed me off so much
"This team looks so poorly coached lately. Super talented, but poorly coached, poorly schemed. So many mental lapses and dumb penalties"
Eagles fans were saying that this team is trash LOL okay worry about your depleted team
I hope they get this 2pt and we lose this game. 100% deserve to lose it.
Our offense hasn‚Äôt been good since week 2... 3 straight weeks of horrible offense against bad teams. If we can‚Äôt put crazy numbers against WAS CIN or PHIL how are we suppose to beat PITT in 2 weeks? This team is not as good as our record indicates
Nobody should be bragging about this 5-1 record. This offense has been pitiful and we are making way too many fucking mistakes. We lose by 3 scores if we played a real team like this.
Offense hasn't looked the same since KC. It's like they have ptsd.
WTF are these short passes and runs on 35 yards....
That's a catch dude
Dogshit offense
"Don't let Ward back in the game. Cost us points with that dumb hit.

When a rookie pulls up and plays smart the veteran should know to do the same."
This win shouldn't make any of u happy what a collapse
Our offense sucks part 43697436
It was nice having an elite offense while it lasted.
Another blown coverage by the defense
We‚Äôre fucking terrible
**SIGN ANTIONIO BROWN**
Blue Moon is my favorite beer
"Offense just looks horrendous. I imagine they are trying new things they don't normally do to make sure they are playoff ready... but it just looks awful. Dobbins needs to get more touches. Ingram just looks like he's lost it. Also, we are they not taking literally ANY shots down field. Need to stretch the defense because the running game is also stagnant and lifeless."
Wink heard y'all bitching about not getting to the QB
Holy shit Peter‚Äôs horrible read
That was an ugly ball haha
Lets not do a run pass pass sequence
"If this was our team from last year, we would have already RGIII‚Äôd them by now."
Sus play calling from Roman these past couple games
That better be a fucking fumble.
"Good to see a designed run for Lamar though, those have been absent"
Dobbins is having a really bad game.
Should we call him Campbell's Chunky? Or just Chunky? Or is that stupid.
Yoooo what was Calais going off on Judon for? Was it just hype talk or was he pissed?
"Sit Wentz, bring out Big Dick Nick. (I know he's not on the team anymore)"
Something is up with Lamar's arm.
I‚Äôm so glad Greg Roman calls the plays and not Reddit.
This offense is systemically fucked man.
wtf did Greg Roman expect that play to get? 4 yards?
Fake punt
You‚Äôd think we‚Äôd be able to defend a zone read
"Yo,why isn't Hurts their starter at this point?"
Called the Hurts debut ü§î
Whatever
Damn bro‚Äôs that‚Äôs a catch
Bad idea to call timeout imo. Now philly go go for it and then if they get it they have a full minute to get a TD.
Hurts would have picked that up.
Greg is insane. WTF was that? Didn't even try xD
"G-Ro has called a good game. He has called some nice quick hitters. Lamar has just missed most of them.

The deep crosser gimme to snead he hit was nice."
McPhee wtf
Why is andrews not playing
And now roughing the passer. This is the stupid fucking shit that has to stop.
Cowher in a turtleneck and tweed looks like a Jeff Goldblum that really let himself go after getting lasik
Isn‚Äôt Hollywood supposed to be one of the fastest receiver? Haven‚Äôt seen him once get behind a back and take it to the house.
FFS. Offensive is a dumpster fire
jesus our offense looks like ass this game
Zrebiec‚Äôs Twitter feed is a little crybabiesh for my liking. He highlights every negative and glosses over positives.
Offense sucks
Why the fuck did we abandon the offense that helped us win 12 straight last year in favor of this lackluster one. I'll never understand.
Lmao fucking pathetic
Throwing form gets worse every game
BIG DICK ENERGY. LETS GO.
"See, that makes zero sense. We're up by 18 with about 17 minutes left in the game. Why would you throw on first down?"
"ahh yes right to the wide receiver 

(I know it was miscommunication it‚Äôs a joke)"
How is that not RTP after the earlier call lmao
Bullshit call
Touchdown Ward!
I'm so disgusted with the mental lapses today.
Philly was able to make it a game against us and Pittsburgh. Yet Cleveland can't handle it.
"""Passes out to Mark Andrews, always a reliable target"" 

*doubt*"
This has been Gus' worst game ever
Need a turnover here.
Damn. Poor Ertz. I like that guy
Fire this whole o line
Fuck this o-line
"What was that tackle, Queen?"
Fucking christ this game has gone on FOREVER
Lol its a clown show out here
"The Red Zone updates for the Ravens are basically

""The Eagles aint gonna win bruh"""
Our offense is so bad they knew they'd kick it deep
"I have a bad feeling, they look scared on the sidelines"
"Harbaugh is going to absolutely rip this team, wow"
Welp we suck
#Fuck you Greg Roman
"""Where's the open guy?""

Yeah, that happens when you have no WR1 on the roster."
FIRE EVERYONE
cowardly d on this drive
We are playing like a falcon.
"Good win. Offense needs to work, defense just has to keep doing what they're doing. These refs need to be blacklisted from doing Baltimore/Philadelphia games."
Almost 300 yards for daddy LAMARüò©üí¶üçÜ
"End of the season we will only see the W. 
Lots to work on but hopefully this gives us a kick up the ass and motivates us even more for Pitt"
bench ingram
That‚Äôs a catch
Refs AND review don't understand how out of bounds works?
"Bad coaching, should‚Äôve kicked it"
"not sure what is worse, Lamar's throwing or all these penalties"
Greg Roman must've been drinking last night with these play calls. That and these dumb penalties...
Fire. Greg. Roman. Please God
Hollywood‚Äôs injury fucked him up a little mentally. He instantly goes to the ground every time lol
[deleted]
If they comeback Roman deserves all the blame
These refs are stinking garbage. Miss every holding call vs other teams but every penalty is called vs the Ravens. Homecooking...
Did you all not see this coming?
Where‚Äôs all the morons who said iTs OnLy 6 pOiNtS
Makes you wonder if last year was a fluke for Lamar in the passing game. He looks pretty bad overall this year. Reminds me of his first few games a starter. I wonder if the coaches let him do his thing a little too much. Might need to focus on fundamentals a bit more.
Snead needs to stay off the field
Roman needs to be fired after this game. Win or lose
Lol at some of the incredibly hot takes in here.
Very poor awareness from Lamar there. He is simply not playing to the same level as he was last year. I type this as a huge fan wearing his jersey rn. He needs to be coached up.
Slow Stroking My Meat for Lamarüò©üòãüí¶üòä
"What a fucking garbage play. 3rd and 30. You know you're probably going to have to kick it. Take a fucking shot deep. What do you have to lose. 

I'm not gonna jump the gun. But it might be time to start considering removing greg roman."
Its lamars third year and he's still struggling with basic fundamentals...
Did Baker just get benched? That's fucking hilarious.
Homecooking Refs again trying to get them free points...
We are going to lose. We are going to lose. Judon is hands down the worst defender we have.
"Shut the fuck up all you whiny bitch plastic fans. Jesus christ. Sometimes the offense doesn't look good and that's fine, still plenty of games to iron it out. I'd hate to see how y'all would act when we had Boller starting at QB."
We got this
I had to come to the UK. Man having games START at 6 PM fucking sucks.
Hope we see the return of the Lamar show. Jackson 5 incoming.
I gotta spend the day doing yard cleanup. I live out of market. Best way to listen to the game from my phone?
I feel like J.O. absolutely dominates the local commercials lol
Let‚Äôs gooo!
Whooooo
Jordan Richards going out to call the coin flip???
PERFECT START
THAT is a good way to start the game.
That's a hell of a way to start D!
Getting started in a hurry
YEA CC
Think we'll see Hurts' debut today?
campbell!!
We eating today
How are we 4th in sacks. Lol
Thank god he dropped that
Man we got lucky
"Lol, completely fucked in the back end"
Hell yeah good opening two plays so far
We got away with that. That should have been 6.
Lol you can always count on receivers to drop a pass
Whew
Peters got beat BAD
And we start at their 47 or so.  Nice.
Lol
Glorious field positioning
Jesus Peters you nearly got us killed there.
Yeah.  Let‚Äôs not let that happen again...
Holy shit mp
That was more luck than skill...
Good field position let's gooooooo
Let's go
Good pass and catch!
Very nice 3rd down conversion
Good throw
Does anyone else not understand why Phillips is starting? He‚Äôs been terrible and Fluker and Mekari have held up better.
Good job Boykin!
Boykin caught something!!!!??? YOOO
Weird throw. Didn‚Äôt look great
Bro that is a small play just a regular out but it was good timing but that ball was ugly
Boykin got separation?. Whaaaaa
Just tuned in! Did I miss anything?
"Let's face it, Lamar will never be able to scramble outside again without 5 defenders staring him down."
ThEy‚ÄôvE FigUreD uS OUt
One day these bootlegs are gonna get lamar popped. Roman needs to stop it
Sweeeeet!
Duv reminds me so much of SSR. He plays so much bigger than he is.
Defense is better than offense. The ravens way
LEL
LLAMA
That was nice!
Let Mark eat jus block for that grown ass man
that was filthy
My stream lagged and i thought tucker missed lol
Hell yeah Boyle!!!
It seemed like we did a bootleg to the right but had most of the receivers go to the left side of the field. Not giving lamar a lot of options
Y‚Äôall really freaked out too much about Lamar. He is a stud
Poor Wentz
LJ Fort revenge game
Good play fort
Haddyy
We gotta execute dammit
Lets go D!
Ouch
"&#x200B;

Ouch, that is going to leave a mark"
big hit on that return
oof
Not to take anything from Anthony but look at the eagles receiver core and offensive line... both are shit shows
"Good to see him walking away, hope he is ok"
I‚Äôm only okay with the commercials if it involves the big tidday thicc butt progressive chick
Lamar was kinda shocked at that hike
Mark is hurt. Damn
"lol, they called a normal run play, and we got 2 yards. I'll take that any day"
"Feel bad for Wentz. Missing Peters, Johnson, starting G and top 2 receviers"
omfgg what kinda play
That was an awesome 1-arm tackle lol
Did bruh just make a Kent Tekulve reference? He's already so much better than Dan Fouts lol
Flag.
"Man, new ravens fans are so bipolar"
What in the shit was THAT play??
Knee down
what is this play calling man
lol wut
There's too much emphasis on ball control instead of taking shots down the field
That's a clear as day fumble!
wtf was that
Love this defense!! That play will stand
Should be our ball.
THATS A FUMBLE
His knee wasnt down
That should stand ball is moving
That might be coming back
Y‚Äôall clearly don‚Äôt remember the Kyle Boller years. Yes our offense is stagnant. But damn we‚Äôre 4-1 right now. Enjoy it
defense carry again!
"Knee was on his foot a little too, I think this is one that stands as called."
Close call man
That's a clear fumble
lets goooo
"I said it last week, and I'll say it again.... We need more plays from under center!"
This means nothing if our offense can‚Äôt captitalize
"Oh man, I am *glad* I'm not the ref that has to review that. I genuinely can't tell you if that's a fumble or not."
crazy fumble
his knee was on deshons foot
Should stand
LETS PUT A SMILE ON THAT FACE
Offense looks like garbage but the defense has been amazing!
#FeedTheBoyle
"If we get the ball, let‚Äôs take a deep shot straight out."
Keep pounding
I was doubting this defense after kansas city but I'm glad they've proved me wrong
BUS!!
Boom!
Gus Bus!!!
Gus the GOAT
#GUS BUS
DA GUS BUS!!@!!
The Gus bus does not disappoint!!
Gus Bus
#GUS!!!
GUS BUS
we will need the O to step up big
Good hustle by Judon there
Ingram's leg... is it the same one he injured last yr?
"What a shame that it takes Ingram getting injured for the Ravens to utilize the younger, fresher & better RB rotation/combination!"
This D is waking up. Loving this the past few weeks.
This doesnt seem fair
Holding must not be getting called this year.
"Wentz will learn to go down faster against us.  He does that too many times, he gonna cough it up again."
Wentz sacked by... everyone
Jesus even when the dragon had his wings clipped I didn‚Äôt see a offense as bad as the eagles Rn
This defense is slinging the ‚ÄúD‚Äù
"Flacco at his worst was 1,000x better than Philly's offense.
Have they even had a single first down today?"
Throw in the towel
Ian sacks can technically half 3 halfs. 3 people can get a half sack on a sack it's weird I know
"It was a funny Bud Light commercial, but I wouldn't want to see it again."
Lmao it looked like Wentz got sacked by his own teammate
the fuck is wentz doing lmaoooooooo
Wow Wentz must love taking hits
Jesus.. hold on to the ball Snead
Saw that fumble coming from a mile away
You're surrounded. Cover the ball lol
Don't scare me like that!
Snead unaware of the dude behind him on the play.
Knead for Snead
Come on Snead. Can‚Äôt have that one step forward two steps back shit
Ya'll wanted other receivers to be involved right?
omg snead just gave me a heart attack
whew
Whew! Dodge a big one
i'll take the gain though lol
"I agree it‚Äôs too early to say for sure, but a lot of us were right ‚Äî the offense is starting to gel this game."
What if we pull a reverse and light it up against Pitt
"Wtf, how'd they read that so well? xD"
"Hi, I‚Äôm u/MDG009 and I criticized the lack of diversity in the offense last week"
Book it Dano!
wouldn't have mattered anyway
ESPN has us at a 95.4% chance of victory right now
For a second there I thought Tucker would have missed that as the greatest kicker of all time
Who has Koch passed? Stover?
Carne asada
Defence has been dominating damn
Judon and Campbell jelling well today
The Eagles now have -7 yards of total offense
Calais Campbell deserves a Super Bowl Championship added to his HOF r√©sum√©!
When was the last time we had a bad defense üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Monstars balling out
**taps mic and clears throat: Baker Mayfield is extremely streaky and will never be able to string together a full season.
Defense is doin the damn thing!!!üîí
"i think this game says a lot about pittsburghs ""best defense in the league"""
Lamar you killin me
"Isn't their whole line out today? Not sure if they are any good to begin with, just asking for some perspective because the bengals line was absolutely shit"
Any thoughts on Madabuike and Broderick Washington so far this game?
In my opinions the only thing the ravens are missing is an elite runningback.
Kaboom your problems!
I don‚Äôt understand the gun running scheme now. It‚Äôs gross. Line up in the pistol and run the ball
THATS MY LLAMA
Was that a Statue of Liberty play??
That same run play Ingram got like 4 yards and tripped
It's not a Ravens game if an offensive player doesn't do a full-on flip after a play
i love that playfake
"Wait, you're allowed to call holding?"
Finally Dobbins had space
There you go Dobby
2 runs 2 first downs. Interesting concept.
JK ALL DAY
Hoping Lamars qb coach goes back and watches film with him seems like maybe his machanics are slipping
Run the ball every 1st down pls
Bro fuck holding
BOYLE ELITE BLOCKER
But Lamar slings that one right in there... Lmao what is happening?
Those fake quick throws to draw are working really well. I think we'll throw it once and get them off guard for big gain.
These fucking penalties
"Sigh, refs see everything the Ravens do..."
Not a Ravens game without some kind of penalty
Look I don't think Tyre is awful but I don't understand why he's starting as a rookie
That play reminded me of a certain someone
About to be 1st & 35
Fucking sloppy
how do we not line up right??
Another flag
No discipline
‚ÄúFuck.‚Äù -John Harbaugh
Get it together...
rigged
Dude what the fuck is with the flags?????
Fucking embarrassing
Take the fucking stick out of your asses ref
I hate that yellow fucking flag
This has got to be a record
Yo wtf lol
why
Is this legal?
wtf all these flags
Just punt on first
The offense is so concerning right now.
Good drive and we just shit the bed
These fucking flags though
Epic.
The Eagles too.....
Hail Mary
I WILL LITERALLY TAKE A GAIN OF 0 FOR THE NEXT 3 DRIVES IF IT MEANS NO MORE PENALTIES WTF
"Okay team let's convert this, 1st and 35"
God damn these penalties
YESSS MORE PENALTIES I LOVE IT
1st and 35 wtf
Just fucking Hail Mary it
Screen to JK let's go
Good punting position at least
Throw the ball over your shoulder!
Miles Boykin on the sideline. Throw it up deep
We should be up by like 28
"That incompletion to andrews was tipped. Also, it was the first incompletion gerry has ""forced"" all yr."
Can anyone share where I can steam the game. Please and thank you
Any possible O-line trade targets? We need all the help we can get.
I'm late to the party. I see we're up 17-0. Anyone have some highlights of the day to catch me up?
I love same Koch but I‚Äôm seeing way to much of him. 2 and 30 we still don‚Äôt go deep 3 and 25 we still don‚Äôt go deep either lamar is scared to throw it deep he doesn‚Äôt have enough time to let plays develop for that long or Greg just isn‚Äôt scheming deep passes either way that shit needs to change man we can‚Äôt be the only team in the league not completing long passes
Lamar may have had a suggestion to sidearm the throws to avoid getting knocked down. Even that last sidearm was knocked down
We run too much. We need to throw for big yards. /s
mitch trubisky rookie season never forget.
They really trying anything now with Hurts to get the ball moving smh
Go figure we get fucked when a DT QB comes in lol.
Isn‚Äôt that what we used to do?
God this is fucking annoying
what the fuck was that
Here come the miracle plays. Wtf man xD
Lol
So that‚Äôs what it feels like
Dude was flying out of bounds.
That‚Äôs an absurdly good catch
I have faith in the refs to screw this up
Lame.  But I guess its right
He didn't have control when his first foot came down
Right foot looks in to me. Go get that INT or punch out D.
Great
Keep the shutout!
Now get a pick
Eagles have had the ball for too long now
i‚Äôm liking a pick here
"Eh, if we made that catch I‚Äôd def say it was in bounds lol"
I gotta say that was a great catch
"I stand corrected, holy shit"
Holy shit ANOTHER drop in our favor.
"I know defense is on the field, but allow me to adjust my fedora and go in on how side-arm throws are disrespectful to the flag... /s"
we got lucky yet again
Shoulder makes it but that angle doesn‚Äôt show the ball.
We score HERE!
Take a shot!
Lol
No way that there‚Äôs enough evidence to overturn that
It‚Äôs not where his head is it‚Äôs where the fucking ball is you dumbass announcers.
2 fumbles for Wentz
call stands
That's a fumble anyway
queen with the slight push back lol
Dobbins is explosive af!
Battery time boys
Never thought I'd see the Matt Cavanagh offense again
Shutout is on track.
Wentz looking hurt
Dammit McPhee
Why not practice 2 minute drill? Team had a minute
We did try to score we knew our defense has the best chance of scoring lol
This is like the third backflip this game wtf
Lol good effort McPhee
"GOD DAMNIT MCPHEE, HOLD ONTO IT"
McPhee has to catch that
C‚Äômon!
BALL DON'T LIE
*AIRHORN*
Chuck must be filthy. back to back ints taken away
Hahahahahahahahahahaha
What the fuck is that call
L o l
weak call imo
BULLLLLLSHIT
Horrible last drive almost giving up points
What a waste.
Put in hurts we wanna give him a taste
hearing phil simms reminds me of madden 25 lol
Hollywood sighting
How did the eagles get a fg attempt at the end of the half?
Smh
This O line isn't jelling
"But for real, even though our offense looks off, this is still a cool game lol. If you're not enjoying this at all, go take a walk and come back or something."
i hope by mid year the o line can get more acclimated... the penalties are killing us
#HOW CAN WE NOT LINE UP??
Asleep at the wheel
Flag flag flag flag flag flag flag
HOLY SHIT STOP IT
It's so much harder to run the ball when we're 20 yds from the 1st down everytime. Why can we not get cooking until 3rd and 10
Can we cool it with the flags Jesus
Just doing that will open the pass game.
OL penalty counter: 8
Madden Mode when he turns it on
Every single player on the O-Line has been penalized besides Skura.
Lol false start now
Come the fuck on dude
Can Greg Roman get our receivers open?
EAT YOUR HEART OUT
Fucking fuck me
???????????????????
Wtf are these penalties
These penalties need to be fixed badly; way too many undisciplined mistakes by the o-line today.
Finally Hollywood got a catch
Nice throw
Great play call
there we go!
Listening on the radio I guess he tripped?
Devin Duvernay = Playmaker (in the making.)
Okay now we‚Äôre clicking on Offense
Kill me
Dis is hilariously bad
O-line wtf!!! xD
Jesus fuck can you guys not false start
The offensive penalties are killing us. We already had a 1st and 35 for crying out loud.
Just wacky rn
Well damn.
lol
Ooooof
"Are they still doing 'Cmon Man'?  If not, put that play of Shaqtin a fool.  Throw it away LJ."
I think we can get it together over the bye week
"Idk what they need to do, but they need to feed Brown and Dobbins on short passes/screens/slants. Get your big play guys the ball and have them make plays. It's clear the OL misses Yanda and can't give the same type of production they did last year. Lamar needs to get the ball out quick or just have them run on jumbo packages. I feel like they are trying to do much and it's getting too ""complicated"" for everyone."
That‚Äôs about right
Uhhhhhhh wut
Lol
What the fuck man
Nice one ü§†
Well shit
üò°üò°üò°
Wow.....
lol wow
...
Fuck that
The fuck.
If hurts is in they are gonna run cmon
Hurts is Winks demon rn
"Time for MVP Lamar to show up now!!!

EDIT: He did!!!!!!!!!!!"
Where tf was this when Marty was here? It was all QB Power with a little passing.
It's actually not a block that was a straight up tackle lol
Time for 8 more o line penalties
"Not sure what was worse, the design of that play or Lamar's throw."
Queen gave up on that play if he kept running he was gonna get the ball at the end zone
DeShon Elliott more than made up for his bad angle at the start of the play when his hustle to still run down the field and force a fumble. It's just too bad that his efforts ended up giving the Eagles the points anyways.
Throw slants
Nice throw to brown
This play calling is atrocious on offense. I just dont like it
I fucking HATE screen passes like that. Run the ball
Best throw all game
why do we keep playing bubble screens
Lamar!!!!
"I‚Äôm quite sure that these past few games have looked bad on offense because roman is focusing on the weak spots of our passing game against weak teams to improve them. That‚Äôs probably why were abandoning the run game, if we went run heavy against the bengals and eagles there would be much higher margins of victory."
Wentz has gotten absolutely clobbered today
"""I can feel it in my veiny neck."" - John Harbaugh"
I swear Wentz is blind. He reacted like a full second too late to Campbell
if he dies he dies...
Calius just out here having fun
Humphrey maaaaaan so cloooooooose
"Lol, dominated"
"Marlon ""Fruit"" Punch."
FRUIT PUNCH MARLO BIAAAAAAATTCCCCHHHH
We need to see the stats for most punch outs in 1 season!!
"Duvernay and Proche in pls, see what we got in them, mostly Duv though"
"Marlo or Pat TIllman, who‚Äôs got the better punch bois?"
Fruit Punch baby
lol lamar almost escaped there
boykin ran the wrong route.
You have to look at the ball to catch it
"Who is at fault on those, Lamar or Boykin? And as fans, how the hell do we figure that out (or can‚Äôt we)?"
"Wow, nearly blocked the punt too."
"Offense isn‚Äôt clicking how I want it to but, defense still dirty."
"Well with some of the blown coverages in D they didn't capitalize on but then forcing two fumbles that we got nothing out of I think defense has been pretty even on the board vs their performance now. 

Don't know why they haven't been using more RPO with Hurts, it was so effective."
smh
Why was Peters on Ertz?
"Just realized not matter what 

Bird gang will not have a perfect record today 

This is so sad"
"Hey Wink, blitzing has been effective, but doing it every 3rd is not xD"
Oh come on. Why is Peters playing that far off on third down?
"My uncle told me this should be a blowout. I said it should be closer than it is. The defense had a few dropped picks, but also blown coverage we got lucky on, who's right?

Thoughts?"
Fuuuck. I know that hurt. üò¨
Jesus Christ
Not PI and this commentator is a puss
"Yeah, that‚Äôs dumb and unnecessary"
Man..oh well
That safety blitz was awesome
bleh
That was just stupid
goddamnit
Wow that was a blown coverage and a half
Low snaps by skura?
Offsides!
Some good work by Boyle today
Best throw from Lamar all day to Boyle right there.
I love when Lamar has to do a 360 to hand off the ball. What kind of call is that G Ro
Gus didnt even have a chance there
Tucker territory.
Can we do any runs that aren't shotgun dives?
BEST EVER
"Have not had a lot of success on the ground today, other than Lamar obv. Def needs to be adressed"
Old man Jimmy
BALLGAME
"Great stand defense! Oh look, the offense has ANOTHER chance to do their jobs and put this thing away..."
Ertz stay Hurt.. So glad we got Andrews
That was A HUGE risk to take there. We have guaranteed 3 here.
that's game IMO
Cmon Denver
Should be game right there
Lot of OPI going on out there
The Eagles caught the injury bug a few years ago and it‚Äôs never left. Must be disappointing for their fans
Why don‚Äôt they just put in Hurts ? Games basically over doesn‚Äôt hurt them
fuck yes
Excellent coverage.
Lmao wtf would you throw that at Ricard for
Let's eat some clock and beat them up
COME ON
The Hell?
Come on
"These formation penalties are on the coaching staff, fucking hell"
You really gonna put us out of FG range?
Bruh
Holy shit these penalties
This is ridiculous
Lol browns and lol bengals
you can't be serious
FUCKING OLINE. we need to replace every single one except skura.
So many penalties ‚ò†Ô∏è
so many penalties
Ref ball
"What the fuck is with these refs, we are the only team to get that call..."
another penalty on our offense? come on man
Ok. Who tf is paying bonuses for OLine penalties?
CAN WE STOP GIVING AWAY PENALTIES YOU STUPID FUCKS
This goddamn pathetic lol.
these penalties bro wtf
penalty yards are still yards right guys??? right.....
Thank you Tucker
Jesus christ Tucker is good
"AU
TO
MA
TU
CK"
Pats lost
 Offensive line is killing them
That‚Äôs what happens when you put a practice squad bum against a top 5 defensive lineman in the game
"I promise you, give us Saints O-Line we would be **MUCH** better. It's not the playcalling, it's not that we aren't running enough, our O-Line has been pisspoor."
Definitely a hold. Penalties are a bit worrying right now.
That's money.
So many flags Jesus
Ward gets redemption. Sorta.
That's not a FUCKING CATCH!!!
Georgia Southern destroyed UMASS yesterday
But the Ravens don't get any pressure on the pass rush!
"Player of the game, campbell or hump?"
"Our offense takes one step forward and the. Two steps backwards 

Another fucking ugly win. What is this team?"
This game seems endless.  Six minutes left?
What was that? You think game is over?
DPOY
Lol again
Sacks on sacks on sacks on sacks
PQ what was that man
Are they scared to tackle him?
"Lol D, LOL"
Looks like the Eagles OTs have also been lining up deep off the line.
Peters cant tackle it shed a block. Wonder if that's why screens works so well.
great jimmy hurt himself
Did a Raven get hurt?
Something must be wrong
"Dayum, he gave Queen a stiffy."
"Ouch, he landed right on top of Peters"
what are we doing
Humph coulda killed that guy but didn‚Äôt want the flag
I think (and hope) MP just got elbowed in his area.
Why play so far off the recievers?
THANK YOU
Easily Elliots best game so far
Good pick.
It has been the day of TOs in the league
THANK YOU JOKER
Remember when our defense got zero pressure? Lol
INT and 2 FFs for Elliot !
[deleted]
He dropped it.
Bowser handing Elliot that pick. What a good stunt by the defense.
[deleted]
Yeah that‚Äôs coming back
"Why so serious, Wentz?"
Looks like it was on the ground?
"elliot has been impressive lately

edit: spoke too soon but he's been good regardless of the drop"
No that's not a pick
oh he dropped it lol
That‚Äôs coming back lol
Damn couldn't secure it
Damnit
Fuck it hit the ground
Wentz got a face full of Bowser
"Dude, finally. Get Wentz the fuck off the field. This game should've been over a long time ago.

Edit: Of course it's not a pick. We've now bailed Wentz out of 3 interceptions."
Ah fuck
incomplete
Not an int
**NOOOOOOOOOO**
"The D is suffocating man 

 Live it so much"
Damn.
I hope we keep tyus
"Bruh, wentz looks like a tomto"
so close
Marlon getting annoyed lol
Man how did he do that lol
The Texans are choking
"Ah well, this looks like this is gonna end with one of those final scores that hides just how lopsided this game actually was."
Fuck
Just brutal.
"Texans about to lose, damn"
brutal
Cannot wait to play the steelers man
just wow.
Just lose
Lmao
*Another* two point conversion?? Come on guys.
Eagles could still win this.
Wide open AGAIN
Well. Now its close.
Team needs to wake the F up on offense and defense.
Mp juice man has not been juicing this year
If they get put in Hurts were screwed guys.
"Can we please just fucking end this, this game has gone on for years and years"
Don‚Äôt let them back in this game please.
RUN THE DANG BALL
Offense needs to score
"Nice work, Peters! Literally right there and pulls a Rahim Moore."
"Bengals lost lol, that's kinda bleak."
"Need this offense to show why we are elite. Everyone says we can‚Äôt win big games, while that‚Äôs yet to be decided let‚Äôs win a big moment here."
A field goal puts this one away
can we be aggressive here please?
Lamar needs to butt excavate them now
Wentz got us out here looking sus.
"alright, offense. No holds. No fumbles. Run that rock."
"Uh, I would rather this not be a one score game right now..."
Let‚Äôs go Lamar!! End this game!!
Love Marcus peters just wish he was a little more consistent
Shite
I'd fucking trust my D against this offense as well
Tennessee just won :(
Offense please do something
We need to line up under center once in a while
AAAUUUGGGGGHHHHH
ridiculous
Sigh
Oh boy. Another fucking Holding.
Do we need to lose this game to realize how undisciplined our team has been playing?
WTF ANOTHER PENALTY WHY
Pucker your buttholes friends
Bruh what is this offense
We deserve to lose this game
Fml
Unreal. Absolutely awful.
Been better off with a sack there tbh
üò°
oh no
It is what it is. Looking forward to this team getting some adversity.
Fucking pathetic.
Baltimore and silly penalties: A love story
We‚Äôre gonna fucking lose
jfc
"Jesus christ, is this game actually happening. This is insane"
Okay now we have a reason to be upset
Wtf were those routes in third down?!?
We suck offensively
So many forced fumbles this game. So few actual TOs.
FUCKING PATHETIC
can someone get fucking open
Our WRs on lock bri
That entire drive was 19 seconds
Needed a good drive to get points or kill time and we get a 3 play drive that lasts 27 seconds and the eagles still have a timeout.
Come on defense let‚Äôs stop them!
Imagine if ward didn't commit that rtp...
Fuckin wow
**PLEASE** make this stop defense
welp
Lol
Pathetic
"Lamar liked it here, he wanted to play here. He loved the coaches. If this team isn't careful, those 2 sentences will be true."
EXCUSE ME?
Should be OPI.
Barring a turnover this game is gonna be tied.
"I thought this was our year, but kinda feeling it may not be anymore.  C'mon guys. :("
"Way too much time left for Philly to come back and send this game to overtime.

Hell, if Wentz is fast enough and we have another shitty drive they have enough time to win."
"How the fuck is this Eagles team alive? Worst offensive line performance in years, that's how. Fucking disgusting. Literal F grade."
O-Line tackling Ravens defenders? Eh let it go
Omg come on Peters please!!!!
"FUCK THE REFS

WHAT THE FUCK"
How do you miss a tackle on a guy standing still catching a punt?
WTF IS GOING ON
the offense looks worse every week... I‚Äôm concerned
They were both fighting for position on that ball
Not like this...
Yeah. Fuck this.
Every player who committed a penalty needs to run wind sprints
"We're gonna blow this, holy shit"
I want to kill myself wtf
HOW MANY PENALTIES HOLY SHIT
All time weak shit
"The Eagles are doing it without Miles Sanders. No big deal, the refs are on their side..."
Can we get a quality WR
:/
This is about to be a total meltdown
WTF
Welp. I hate life
TAKE MT WBERGY
OT?
Damn
Oh boy...
My heart man
So many penalties dammit
Penalties and the inability to move the ball has been our downfall rn
It‚Äôs been a LONG time since my heart has beat like this
HOLD!!!!
sigh
Lads???
Pls no 2 pointer
Pick play coming
What a load of fucking shit.
People pinning this shit on the defense like our offense didn‚Äôt just go 3 and out and gave them 30 seconds of rest.
Bruh
At least they got it but they literally made me nauseous af for no reason
Thank god
I didn't know teams could okay from behind
Let‚Äôs go D!!! Stand at the critical moment!!
Judon did something
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this but thank you judon
At least we stopped the conversion
OFFENSE DO NOT MESS THIS UP
How much you wanna bet they get another chance via penalty?
Horrible play call
This is where the mental comes in- let‚Äôs go boys
"First time all day Judon actually did anything

Not thrilled it took 58 minutes but I'll take it"
"Now we need to run damn clock, please"
GET ON THE GROUND
Big
"It‚Äôs not over yet, they got a timeout"
Wow shocked that we stopped them
Embarrassing
And they jumped offsides
"OK, BURN THE CLOCK DONT ALLOW SHIT"
Bodybuilt by Taco Bell
come on offense.
Holy fuck man
Bro Wentz's landed on his hands crazy he ain't break em
Refs gonna catch the onside for Philly
Judon 945 m APY
time for an onside i guess
Thanks to Dougie P for the play call that bailed us out.
FUCK OFF BITCH
It‚Äôs only a penalty when we do it
Games not over..
Fuck you Philly and fuck you refs
Please just close this disaster out
"Can the offense please hold the ball now tho, literally just for 1:55"
No false start on the LT?!?
Ugly win but a dub is a dub
I cant believe the game was so close
"Bro i called it. Our 2016 game against Philly ended in a failed 2pt conversion and we won by 1. Barring this onside, itll be the same shit again. Idk why I just knew"
They c oco old get it with 5 seconds lol
No fucking passing.
And we recover the onside kick. We might just avoid a super embarrassing loss.
Lamar needed to go down there.
Ball game bitches
why do you do this to us eagles
Fuck please slide Lamar
Honestly can't believe we're 5-1. We've looked mediocre against awful teams
Gotta get better.
Hopefully we learn from this
"12 penalties for 130ish yards, weird game, terrible o-line... and we still won. Not clean but even great teams have sloppy games, the difference between great teams and above average teams is the great ones pull the W still."
Put the camera on Acuna
Anyone still here?
[deleted]
rOmAn NeEdS tO BeFirEd
Derrick Henry has more rushing yards than Lamar does passing
We are sure as fuck not Super Bowl contenders
So when they bout to fire Greg Roman?
There is no game thread more insufferable than ours when the team we support is UP BY FREAKING 11 POINTS
2 bad lamar passes that drive.
AGAIN SIGN ANTONIO BROWN
That‚Äôs so fucking lucky
I think it was good fb iq that he kept it. Nothing was open and the defense was all over the receivers. We need a top end wr bad so they can get separation
BAKER OFFICIALLY PULLED FOR THE DAY!!
Not what we needed
Lamar is actually accurate when throwing to a wall...
Dude WTF is up with our offense
Free Gus and Dobbins
[deleted]
"Classic Ravens, go up 17-0 then sputter hard"
Yeah that's complete
#BULLSHIT
"I just... I dont think were playing as aggressive as we can be. Were not utilizing our weapons correctly and and at the end of the day I think Roman is at fault here. This is the same shit he did in San Fran. This is why san fran immediately dropped to the bottom of their division after their superbowl appearance. Because he changed the game style to less aggressive. The only reason we are still competitive is our defense. And unless we fix this shit soon we will not beat the harder teams. 

Steelers arent a fucking joke this year. And if our offense continue this short choppy bullshit we will not beat them. If we can't even move against the fucking eagles. What the fuck are we gonna do against a competent defense."
Please let's see some half-time adjustments. Lamar needs to get his head in the game
Those people are open enough
"Ugh. It's not a terrible call with how the rule is written, but that's such an annying rule."
White tight end time.
these refs are litterally playing for the eagles
garbage time TD
Why is it that every time a receiver is wide open its Marcus Peters blowing the coverage?
Something needs to change at the bye or Harbaugh will be on the block.
We‚Äôre soooooo fucked this season
This team is embarrassing right now
Anybody think this team would beat the Titans or Chiefs?
How is that not a touchback?
2 ineffective runs and a successful pass play.  This sub is going to explode.
Lamar needs to fucking GO! That's twice now he had chose to not run and got a yard instead of 5. Ffs what the hell are they telling him? Let him ball out..!
"Offense play calls are sus so far, except for the Boykin throw"
This might be the shutout we've been waiting for.
"Come on offense, start clicking!"
those were catchable passes dropped
"Someone run the football, Lamar run that shit if you can‚Äôt throw"
"Before the season I thought for sure we were gonna go all the way. On paper we should be much better than last year apart from the Oline. Weve gone completely backwards on every part of our offense and are so fucking predictable. If I on my couch know what play is about to come on 3rd and long, then you know damn well the defense does. I dont doubt we will make it to the playoffs, but i would not at all be surprised to see this team go 1 and done again. Thank god the defense is playing so well because if not we would be fucked."
Andrews was open for the TD there...
I'd like to see more passes to RBs.
Boseman wake the fuck up or get off the field.
"we up 17-0 but it's all mostly to the defense, we not gonna get this lucky against the Steelers"
"Guys need to catch those, but Lamar also needs to hit them closer to the body on these bullet passes."
"can we get some 3 TE sets and some RPOs going, maybe some pistol, what we ran last year?"
How does the fake screen work if we never throw normal screens? Lol
Fucking Michael Oher....wait
"1st and 35, and we run the ball xD"
"If we are playing this way against this terrible Eagles defense, next game against the Steelers is gonna be ugly"
Lamar Jackson 2.0. OMG...
Holy shit
BS he didnt have full control when he got that first step
"Geez, is that Perriman?"
Remember this isn't just about breaking the plane either - you have to maintain forward progress. I remember when they screwed us against Brees the one time with that call.
"Catch the ball McPhee, OMG"
Was he not in bounds there? Clock should have run out after that tackle
What a fucking chokejob
get Roman the fuck outta here yesterday btw
What is this shit show
"These penalties are embarrassing,  this is a real professional team out there? Holy shit, I'd criticize their discipline but there's nothing to critique because their discipline doesn't exist"
Lol Charles Davis talking bout hollywood like he fell no he fell on purpose
Belee guys
There need to be more playmakers on offense out there. Another top tier WR is needed.
And we have a ball game boys
"WTF DEFENSE? I know you've been lights out all day, but WTF?"
"Roman, back at it again with the horrible playcalling..."
All that for a sack
"Roman, wtf was that? It's like every drive they get either Jekyll or Hyde as OC xD"
Aw come on Marlon
Oh fuck off!!!
Andddddd another bail out.
"Way to fucking go, Ferguson"
Here we go again.
Hey guys I saw Baker was benched in the 3rd quarter. How much were they winning by? üòÇ
"24th in the league, oof"
We do the slowest handoffs ever
"Mostly I'm agnostic about these ""how can we play like this vs Pittsburgh??"" takes, but I am concerned our run game will look very similar vs their d line."
How far can Lamar throw sidearm? These seem to be hist best looking throws
Zero holding calls on the Eagles. Like 3 on us.
These refs are fucking ridiculous..
Penalty on the Eagles!? Can that happen guys? Is that allowed?
DO NOT LET THEM SCORE. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD
"I know you guys hate this team this year. But I love a balanced offense-defense team. Defense isn't perfect, but we can count on them."
"What an extremely unathletic play by Peters, pathetic coverage and jump.."
Man our DBs have been exposed a few times today. That should've been an easy play on the ball.
[deleted]
Why didn‚Äôt they challenge Wentz being down
We deserve to lose
This team man this fucking team I don‚Äôt think I have been this angry in a while FUCK
We really need to assess our WRs and see if we can make some kind of trade or signing. Lamar needs someone who can get open quickly
This crew is complete bullshit.
This team is a fucking joke.
Deserve to lose playing like this on offense
How are we struggling against the Eagles?
THATS AWFUL
The they don't bring in offensive target and oline we are fucked.
Get fucked
"We are not the falcons 

Thank god

NOW WHERE THE HELL IS MY JULIO JONES"
"People saying it's not the refs, how you gunna defend them on the no call on the left guard pulling 2 seconds before the snap on the 2 pt lmao"
any given sunday my dudes. i'll still take the W
"I think if our offense was slightly better, we would‚Äôve scored 40"
This game should be a big wake up call to the coaching staff. Hope offense improves cuz this was ridiculous.
"I swear  to god, any one of you who posts a ""take it easy on our offense"" post, I'm gonna cuss you the fuck out. RGIII should be in against this dogshit team rn."
"Nice job upgrading the receiver position in the offseason, guys.

Bang up front office work."
That‚Äôs a catch
How the fuck is that a catch?
"Is there anything we can do to get Greg Roman fired? I'll sign whatever, I'll wear whatever, he needs to go. The faster the better before the damage is permanent"
We're getting 1st rounded again
Hate to say it but we‚Äôre frauds....
"Uhoh... they scored 6 lol..some of yall are fucking awful ""fans"""
Can we just take Wentz‚Äôs head off one of these plays? Tired of seeing his awkward ass dance around. Light him up
"Uh oh we‚Äôre only up 17-6 with one loss on the year, bring out all the ‚Äúfans‚Äù talking about how trash this team is!!!"
"This thread is embarrassingly toxic.... 

If you want to call out bad plays, do it in a constructive way. Let‚Äôs educate each other and drive good conversation."
God this team sucks. We‚Äôre going to fall ass backwards into the playoffs and embarrass ourselves again.
SHITTY O IS BACK ON THE MENU. TIME TO PANIC AND NOT RUN ANOTHER DOWN THE REST OF THE GAME
Omg decosta needs to be on the phone with ab‚Äôs agent right now
"love the humphrey punch but he can‚Äôt try to do it every play. cost us a TD in pittsburgh last year, good thing he made up for it in OT"
"If we don't get points on this drive, I'm nervous."
We deserve to lose.
We‚Äôre still gonna win
I want to be active at the trade deadline but idk what we need. Maybe Julio Jones basically. A WR who catches everything regardless of the pass being slightly off.
Madden curse is real.
My mans Lamar just needs a fresh cut. He lookin like a human cockroach out there  with that hair.
Lamars been figured out by the league üò≠
Why are they hugging all these dudes with COVID going on?
"Steelers going to smoke us. Penalties, side arm passes, run blocking. Have a LOT to fix on the off week. Hope we fix a lot of this."
Y‚Äôall need to have some faith lol
When did we turn into a clown offense üò°
"I don't mind Lamar trying to take a step back and not do as much against worse teams. But when the going gets tough he needs to be ready to be the ""Point Guard"" and not be slow due to lack of playing that way."
AB: üëÄ
"Great, now the backup is in and we about to get picked apart."
Marcus peters got driven back back carson wentz. Didn‚Äôt even try to make a tackle on that play
Bullshit
Next. Draft. Wrs and DEs. Every round.  Please.

Thanks homecooking refs! Not a single one called on the Eagles though! >:(
"If we win, it'll feel so weird. We don't look or feel like a 5-1 team at all to me."
Hopefully this is the last game for Roman
Jesus Christ we have so much work to do we honestly deserved to lose this one
They're really reaching with this bar commercial. Tf do you want any president to do about a disease this infectious? Niggas don't want to get sick so they stay home
ITS 17-0. Stop bitching you toxic fucks
End me now
Duvernay was open over the top there
"honestly, anyone who thought this is a good team needs a reality check - this is a good thing for this team to go through, gotta learn that walking all over the Browns, Bengals, and WFT won‚Äôt prove anything to anyone. Gotta get WAY better if they want to compete for anything this year"
"Lamar, stop showboating. You've mostly looked like ass."
"Until Lamar becomes a better passer, we need him to keep breaking off these runs!"
Downvote me all you want but i think the Steelers are gonna eat this team‚Äôs lunch without some major changes.
Lamar needs to learn to elevate the ball
[deleted]
Thank god we have the easiest schedule this year
"Lol, that was embarrassing Eagles. Almost cancels out the lucky TD"
It seems like LJ just doesn't want to play today. Very little killer instinct
"Why do we run it to the right so fucking often. It doesnt work ever. We have way more success running to the left. Period.

Guess which side of the line cleared that hole for jacksons td. The fucking left."
This is fuckint bull shit.  Just giving them shit wtf
We don't deserve a bye week with all these penalties. Absolutely unacceptable
Just tuning in. How did y'all let THIS eagles team comeback?
Run the fucking ball Jesus Christ
"Lamar is straight up bad this year. Not just a down year for him or whatever you want to say, his performance so far this season is straight up bad"
Every whiny bitch ass Ravens fan...complaining about the refs AGAIN.  Maybe it's just this team?
"Once again, we have a great first drive and then get sloppy and lose all rhythm. Defense is carrying this team. We‚Äôre setting ourselves up for a massive upset game."
"QUICK! First drive of the game, abandon the run!"
Imagine if we had prime Alex Collins with these RB‚Äôs
Incoming screen pass
I'm a patient man but it taking 5+ games to get this running game going.
"I'm not here to talk about the game, I'm here to discuss the commercials. that's what they mean by ""play every game like the superbowl"" right?"
Lamar is 2018 Lamar without the rushing üßä
Safety incoming!!!!!!
I love that progressive advert
Only one foot down
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a catch but what a play by Ward
Why the hell would the eagles not take the 3 points and make it a 2-score game? That is so pathetic
Did Calais kill the shutout just now?
"that miss was just bound to happen
yknow"
Offense is so bad
Holy fuck the offense is entirely in misstep so many penalties
Gimme a touchdown right here and I‚Äôll nut
Oline is really struggling
GOAT
Almost another fruit punch
Defense is gassed
Sigh
the fuck
Is this me or this game is going fast?
Fucking go for it
Fuck these refs smh
Honestly we need to fix something soon with Pittsburgh coming up
Roman needs to be replaced.
These refs getting on my nerves
We traded Lamar Jackson mid game to the eagles
Ok..all you gloomy weenies can calm down.
This team man lol
Titans win
"Did RG3 come in? I turned it off, what happened how did the eagles score ?"
BELEE
Lol..nice
"Thank GOD, and I‚Äôm shocked it was Judon who finally did something useful this season lol"
Why in the name of all that is holy does Roman go away from the running game almost every game?
GET ROMAN THE FUCK OUTTA B-MORE
Earl Thomas catches that
Really stroking my shit for fun nowüò©üí¶üçÜ
Offense has been a fucking joke and predictably our defense is getting gassed because they can't do literally everything. I am utterly shocked this is happening. This offense has fallen off a map after last year. This team is supposed to be a top three superbowl contender?
SIGN ANTONIO BROWN MANNNNNN
This fucking defense misses every damn sack I stg
Why is every throw sidearm?!?!
Pack it in boys gg
"Lamar looks like shit and people need to stop making excuses for him

dude needs to to a sports psych or somethin on the bye week cause he clearly has the yips"
I could care less if we beat the eagles. We gotta fix our offense ASAP
"2000 ravens simulation, good defence. Trent Dilfur type offence"
Another great start to a drive. 2nd and 17

I would honestly rather run on every play rather than try to force throws half the time
Shot ourselves in the foot an nearly bled out. The running game is meh. The Oline is meh. Marlon Humphrey is having an incredible year. Peters gambles too much. WRs dropped a lot of balls. Overall grade today a D-

We need a better quarter back sorry not sorry
I‚Äôm calling it like I did 30 minutes ago. It‚Äôs going to be a blowout and we will lose. Defense can only protect you for so long without offense putting up any points on the fields.
Trade Marcus peters! Dude is a bum and gave up 160 yards

""
This was the first legit ‚ÄòLAMAR‚Äô play I‚Äôve seen from him this year. It was the kind of crazy shit he pulled once a game last year. Gotta get that mojo going again.
""
It is crazy that they can afford to use real games as practice sessions. Benefits of having the easiest schedule. Hopefully they‚Äôre saving their A game for the Steelers and Titans.
"I‚Äôve tried to explain this in the last two game threads on r/nfl.  We‚Äôre doing exactly what we need to do to develop him as a passer, and we‚Äôre about to be 5-1.  It looks ugly because he‚Äôs still learning."
I don‚Äôt like the designed roll outs so often. Seems like he‚Äôs better in the pocket and it doesn‚Äôt cut the field down. The RG position is a problem big time. I like sneed as a guy but it seems like DD and proche should take most of his snaps
"I‚Äôm more concerned by Roman‚Äôs schemes for passing. It seems almost nonexistent by the lack of guys getting open. I know he‚Äôs not Sean Payton or Andy Reid, but man, I don‚Äôt see much creativity unless it‚Äôs a run."
"If this game goes to OT, that‚Äôs just extra reps, right?"
John should call his brother Jim to shout at these players
Dw I‚Äôm with you. Running the ball is not as effective as people believe. Do people really expect us to run or 3rd and long? Like tf
"I'm with you. I want to see Lamar continue to develop. Unfortunately what I'm seeing is that all the progress he made coming into last season in terms of his footwork, arm angle and delivery is all gone. That level of regression concerns me."
"Pass game has looked damn decent today. No huge plays, a few Deflections and bad OL play but it's been sharper and more spread out than it has been in recent weeks"
I'm with you. We got an easy enough schedule that Lamar can get real game reps as a passer to learn and still win.
You're not.  Lamar needs to throw; it's obvious our QB and WR aren't in synch with the playbook.  Our run game isn't anywhere near what we we saw last week and the coaches clearly don't many designed runs for Lamar.
They want Lamar to get better at passing but they don't want him to throw the ball.
"Imagine if we ran the ball all the time. That's how teams figure out our offense. I'd rather see Lamar using more passing plays and getting better game after game. 

Also we're up by 17 and are 4-1. People need to chill on the ""worst offense ever"" talk."
It's not that we want him to run every play it's that we dont want him to pass every single play and rush for 3 yards a game
And hes obviously getting better
"But thats what makes the offense so deadly. If we have lama4 barely run it gets rid of the whole run option for the defense. Last year it was 3 options the defense had to work out: Running back runs, Lama4 passes, or Lamar runs. And this year hes been running a LOT less and the offense isnt looking too good."
Funny meme
I mean it does work when he runs it and mixes with passes instead of giving it away to our rbs I feel like sometimes ravens get too confident and the coordinators don‚Äôt care like today
This game was the best game he had in his career as a passer. Even though he goes for the side arm passes way too much. He was passing with great timing and passing outside effectively enough for other teams to notice.
"It was kind of nice to see some of those early passes to duv and to see Dobbins getting some more reps. I had a heart attack when Snead fumbled after that long catch and run. Our defense definitely carried us yesterday though. Those penalties were embarrassing, can't convert if your 25 yards from the sticks every set of downs. It was nice to see a couple good runs from Lamar and nice to see other receivers getting involved."
"I swear black QBs are the only ones that are considered ""still developing"" after winning an MVP leading the league in passing TDs lmaoooooooooo. I think the most glaring ""developments"" need to be from the O line and recievers."
It's not about running it more. It's about threatening to run it more.
develop as a passer? He lead the league in passing touchdowns. He‚Äôs not a bad passer he‚Äôs actually a really good one who just hasn‚Äôt found his stride yet this season and the play calling isn‚Äôt helping. If you don‚Äôt establish the run this team is very predictable on offence which it should never be!
this sub‚Äôs attitude this year has been disappointed. annoying as hell.
"I agree. He‚Äôs gotta throw the ball at some point, this is the NFL. Nobody‚Äôs ever won by running the ball every down. He came into the NFL as an extremely raw passer, he has to develop at some point. He‚Äôs gotten better every year, the sky is the limit"

It‚Äôs hard fir me to imagine looking at this game and thinking it‚Äôs a wr problem
"O-line and a dip in Lamar‚Äôs own performance are the real issues, but neither one of these can easily be addressed through trades/FA.

A veteran WR would open things up more though, so I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked to see a trade before the Steelers game."
"Yes it's the recivers fault that hes over/under thrown or has to come back to the ball because leading the reciver seems to not make sense to the Qb. If anything his weeks shows that Lamar needs to ditch this side arm throwing bullshit and practice on hitting a reciver (leading them) through the route. Recivers have been fine in this Eagles game so far, Lamar has not."

Oh shit that‚Äôs what that fucking noise was

They were doing that shit in the orioles-Phillies series and it pissed me off to no end
We were calling him out in our own subreddit thread (r/eagles). How somebody like that isn't kicked out of the stadium almost immediately is absurd.
Anyone have audio link of it?

You wouldn‚Äôt know it from fan sentiment
"I mean, for a few games in a row last year they scored every possession lol. The efficiency has been historic."
we still have one of the best O‚Äôs in the league and it‚Äôs like we‚Äôre not even at 50% of our potential.

Your post is bad and you should feel bad
Last season he had an elite deep cover safety playing behind him. He doesn‚Äôt have that this year
Peters gives us 2 elite CBs. that PI call was bs and hes playing great this season and last.
Idk about hot garbage but he has been much worse this year.
"This is how Peters always is. Makes plays that make him look like a genius, but also gives up a couple baffling and infuriating plays on occasion."
"Did everything they could to get Philly back in this game. Ravens have played like shit, no doubt, but my god these fucking refs are ridiculous"
"They needed it to end as a 1 score game so the Eagles would cover. After listening to a podcast about Tim Donaghy and the NBA betting scandal, I am not convinced that any sport refereed by humans is on the up and up."

Justin Tucker for hitting two field goals from 46 and one from 55 like it‚Äôs nothing. Those are not easy kicks. He misses any one of those and we lose.
Calais Campbell

"Justin Tucker

No-doubting three 40+ yarders, including a 55 yarder. I love that man!"

#Matt Skura

Only Ravens OLineman to not get penalized today and let's be real - this is probably the only time he will ever get a chance to be Player of the Week so let's let him have it y'all"
**Deshon Elliot** and **Calais Campbell**. Absolutely no one else.
"Ravens all-time great, most games played record holder, **Sam Koch**

Thanks for giving opposing offenses long fields over the years!"
"Gonna say special teams overall. Tucker was money. Koch won the field position battle for most of the game. When the offense couldn‚Äôt get a first down, and defense couldn‚Äôt get a stop, we got the onsides kick recovery"
Justin Tucker. He misses one of those on this windy day and we lose.
"

**JUSTIN TUCKER**

Won by less points than his 55 yard FG added"
"Hopefully we can get a blame of the game eventhough we won. If so, **PENALTIES**."

Deshon Elliott
Justin Tucker AND Calais Campbell
"We‚Äôre winning but these don‚Äôt feel like W at all

CALAIS CAMPBELL
**TUCKER**
You guys are gonna hate me for this but Lamar - he came through when we needed it.
Calais Campbell and it's not even close really.
Campbell and Tucker. Pretty much it.
"**CALAIS CAMPBELL**; the big guy feasted against the Eagles. Honorable mention goes to **DESHON ELLIOTT** for his determination, effort and hustle to run down and force a fumble after his bad ankle to start that huge Miles Sanders run in the third quarter (even if the Eagles ended up scoring on a lucky bounce). I guess **MATTHEW JUDON** (**EDIT**: and **L.J. FORT**) deserves an honorable mention, too, seeing how ~~he~~ they made the game-clinching tackle; the same goes for **JUSTIN TUCKER** because his field goals made a difference today and he makes making 55-yarders like look the easiest thing ever."
Tucker. Without him we lose.
Proche with the onside kick recovery....
 **Calais Campbell**
Calais Campbell because he is a grown ass man.
"Campbell on D 

But without Tuck we wouldnt have won this game."
Justin tucker

"Most definitely my all time favorite player, Tucker.  

Edit: Campbell deserves credit as well.  They are pretty much the only two though."
Campbell. Harassed the shit out of wentz.

Calais Campbell
Tucker and Jackson. Everyone else seemed super undisciplined.
Lamar I‚Äôm proud of him good bounce back game
"**Calais Campbell**

3 sacks, ate doubles all day. Set the tone for a solid defensive day in a game where defense had to make up for the offense being way too slow."
"NOT Greg Roman.

Calais Campbell.

We are bottom 2 ranked pass offense, this needs to change if we want to compete for a ‚Äòship. Lamar has bailed us out enough, we can take a risk with a new OC. 

50 shades of Trestman all over again."
**CAMPBELL.**
"Calais Campbell + Deshon Elliott (look his effort running on the Arcega TD, this Earl Thomas would never do that) for me"
"Judon
2 pt conversion stop won it for us"
Gotta be CC

Not a lot of deserving players today. I'm voting Calais Campbell
Special Teams
"Campbell

Nobody was great tbh. Disappointing performance"
Campbell. Dude had three sacks
"**Special teams**

The only unit that consistently performed today"
D/ST
Calais for me. With the hear Marlon is having he is still an argument for best defensive player with everything he has done. That play on the early screen pass was amazing.
"Special Teams.

Justin Tucker with the auto foot once again and that on side recovery at the end to seal the deal."
Calais Campbell for all those sacks!
The monstar himself
James Proche after all that bullshit.
Campbell easy
Campbell
We won but I‚Äôm gonna nominate the offensive line for blame of the game anyway. Too many penalties and tackles for loss.
Calais. Has to be. HM to Tucker
Tuckere
CALIUS OR JIMMY
Campbell
Calais
Am I going to get downvoted for being the only one to say Marlo?
"The Eagles. almost any other team, and we lose this game. Calais Campbell was amazing too"
"Tuck, need I say more?"
Tucker
"Patrick Ricard for the pair of blocks that opened the path for the 2nd TD. Rewatch that play. He pushed a guy 5 feet to his left then spun around, crossed the gap, and pushed a 2nd guy 5 feet to the right to make a wide open runway for Lamar."
"Lamar , he was still not mvp level but showed improvement on and offense that kept shooting itself in the foot, encouraged about the Steelers game"
"Campbell had a world beater of a game, but Humphrey did too so it‚Äôs hard for me."
Easy it‚Äôs Campbell
The officials
"Campbell or Tucker

If Tucker does not hit that 55 yarder we lose"
"I thought it was fine except for the penalties, penalties really destroyed us the whole game, plus the refs hoed us on those last few calls on defense"
"Yes. Yes, it was that bad. An effort like that is going to get us rolled against the Steelers."
As a whole yes. The offensive line was playing like ass. The penalties were mostly boneheaded mental errors
"Offensive line isn‚Äôt as good as it was last year. 
Way too many penalties all over."
"On on the positive note, Lamar rushed 108 yards on 9 attempts which I believe is 12 ypc which is good af. And Lamar utilized Boyle instead of spamming Andrews. 

On the bad... a shit ton fucking penalties mainly by our O-line, not creating big enough lanes for our rushers to pass through, a couple under thrown and over thrown passes, and apparently forgot how to convert 3rd downs in the second half"
"Lines been an issue. Penalties, run game not as good as last year, lamar seemingly under pressure most plays. This bye week we need to figure out our oline. Also we get Williams and hopefully Wolfe back"
"I think the offense will be okay, they had some sustained drives and turns out when you have a 1st and 15 every possession it doesn't go great"
"It wasn't our best outing nor our worst. Lamar was pretty good on the ground, though I ***Really*** want him to look at the flim and see how bad his mechanics are"
An important stat: our RBs put up 74 yards on 28 carries today.
More times than not we see ourselves 2nd And 10 first down plays seem to get us nowhere
"I have a buddy who has been saying that we need better WRs bc our WRs are trash. He‚Äôs partly right. We need better WRs bc we need people who will make up for Lamar Jackson‚Äôs inaccurate throws. I read some dumb ‚Äútrades we want to see‚Äù article (bc what else are you going to do on a Wednesday? Work?) and it had us getting Julio Jones for a first round pick. That‚Äôs the kind of player that we need. I have done 0 research on the salary stuff, so I don‚Äôt know if it will work, I think that will help our offense a lot."

With that being said, Roman was calling better plays this week, but he was inconsistent. Also, o-line penalties shafted any good play that the offense would've gotten at times. Lamar played better than last week for the most part too, but still some mistakes like not throwing it away, and the occasional miscommunication. I'm glad that they're able to win, even with their issues. Hopefully, they can fix them during the bye week."
You watched that game right? Lamar did not have a good game throwing. He made terrible throws and needs to ditch that schoolyard side arm crap.
"Last few weeks some people in this sub have stated that Ingram should not get more carries than Dobbins and Gus. Today he got significantly less due to being shaking up. Don‚Äôt get me Fletcher Cox is a beast and destroyed a lot of our runs, but personally I think this game shows Ingram‚Äôs experience and skill set gets under appreciated by some people in this sub."
I think the problem is the plays not the players. JK isn't much of a north-south runner but all those fakes are so bad they are faking no one but taking your own players out of the game.
If the O-line is garbage it doesn't matter who's running the ball.
I love Ingram but I can't imagine he would've have too much more success. Most of our hand offs were stuff before the handoff was completed. I hope we start to see some faster under center runs
"Justice hill deserves a shot, he‚Äôs the fastest of all of them"
I think if we going to have a trade we will have it this week with covid protocols and all. Who are our targets? Maybe a wr or a te?
"I believe the WR corps can get it together, Duvernay and brown have the ability to create separation and sneed had some solid catches. I want the pass-rush to be improved if anything, all these sacks and hurries look good but lets not forget who we've played for the last three weeks (Washington, Cincy, Philly) all terrible O-lines, if we want to compete with the titans and chiefs, then we have to improve with pass-rush"
Offensive. Lineman. Yanda leaving seriously messed up any chemistry they had last year. Fix that up and give Lamar an average 1s longer to throw? Could make a huge difference. Getting a WR doesn't do much if Lamar doesn't have the time.
Julio.
it fucking better. Interior o line and a receiver desperately
How do we feel about a Brandon Cooks or a Mike Williams
Kerrigan for pass rush or possibly one of chicago‚Äôs 57 TE‚Äôs
Curtis Samuel.
No great line help on the block anywhere. I think we maybe make a pass at a WR. But no one on the block is likely.
Get Julio Jones AND Antonio Brown. NOW!
Julio and an a new right guard.  Idk who is available there.

Will be a ufa this offseason and looks like hes ready for a change of scenery. Could probably be had for a 5th
Why would the Colts trade him at this point? They‚Äôre potential playoffs opponents.
We need help by the deadline not by offseason
Dont think he adds anything Hollywood or Duvernay doesnt. Our weak passing game so far hasnt been on our WRs imo
"Why would we want an older WR that plays a similar style to Hollywood? This team is lacking a big bodied possession receiver in the BMarsh/Jeffery/Julio mold, not a declining speedster."

Yes it‚Äôs perfectly fine to criticize the offense, they aren‚Äôt perfect and the penalties were absolutely embarrassing today. But let‚Äôs take a collective chill pill. If we aren‚Äôt playing our best football and are 5-1 into a bye, then that tells you something about this team.

Raiders beat the chiefs and chargers really almost did as well. Patriots lost to DENVER today. 9ers got DESTROYED by the dolphins last week. Seattle got taken to the wire with the Vikings who look bad. It‚Äôs okay to have tough stretches, difference is great teams squeak out these wins."
"I agree with you but I think people are concerned that if we're struggling now, then the Steelers, Cowboys, Pats, Titans are gonna smack us. It IS okay to have a tough stretch but when the going is only gonna get tougher it is concerning to say the least. Especially with this team who has Superbowl aspirations."
"Agree with pretty much everything in here, good post. Wanted to add my own thoughts:

For whatever reason, this sub seems to believe that there is only *one* way to be a fan of a football team, and it's whatever *their* way is. People, just let Ravens fans enjoy football in whatever way they want. If you're a fan who likes to pinpoint every mistake and qualify our record at every opportunity, that's fine. If you want to ignore the bad and put blinders on and be happy we're 5-1, that's fine too. 

For some reason, there seems to be a prevailing attitude that the way we discuss our team *matters*. It doesn't. We're fans for god's sake. If u/overly_optimistic_ravens_fan just wants to be happy that we won, don't fucking respond to him and tell him that's not allowed because the offense sucks and the Steelers will crush us. If u/overly_pessimistic_ravens_fan wants to voice his concerns with the o-line and the secondary, there's no need to tell him to shut up because we won and he shouldn't complain. I honestly think that some people forget that nothing that ever happens on this sub will influence anything in real life lmao."
"Barring injuries, the longer the season goes the better our online will get.  The rookie Phillips for instance should get more comfortable.  Very few rookie o line men have a good first half of the year."
"Football teams are made up of humans. They make mistakes, have bad games, etc. What separates the great NFL teams from the mediocre and bad teams is how they respond. The Ravens are a team that consistently responds positively to issues that they encounter. They'll work this week on those issues, players will be held responsible, etc. There have been a number of concerning things that we've seen this year, but there's still time for them to work on improving everything."
Panic will set in for me if we are in week 12 and offense hasn't hit it's stride. I think its kind of good that our team hasn't got hot early on - hopefully this is building character and making them tougher. I'd rather us be hot heading into last 5 games or so and ride that vibe into the playoffs than be regular season warriors like last year.
I've had this realization the past couple weeks. After the game I feel like the offense hasn't played that well and we still score 30 like every game. It's quite a luxury haha
"People just need some perspective. The only stats that matter are Wins, and Losses, and we are 5-1. I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs pretty good, and better than 4-2 where we were last year."
"Best take on here IMO. It's not panic time we""re doing great right now. Offense is worrisome though but just hoping they catch fire mid to late season"

I think it should be Gus with Dobbins as the 3rd down back. I don't think the OL is good enough anyways. Ingram seems to be hesitant. Gus just runs downhill which is something we need right now. Need to get Dobbins in space.
"Dobbins should be the starter and 3rd down back, with Gus the goaline and short yardage back"
"Ingram has proven that he can run over people and pick up multiple big plays a games. 
Dobbins needs to develop. Honestly, he needs to beat up on a bad front a little bit to gain confidence. So we should've used him more last week."

Hell no. Not the way we‚Äôre playing.
Not with this offense
"Well, they already beat Washington on the road, so there goes that theory, I suppose. Both times Baltimore won Super Bowls they lost away @ Washington ‚Äî and additionally, the Ravens split with PIT, winning against them on the road & losing versus them at home.

Another thing that happened both times, but is unlikely this time around, is Denver also being in the postseason to defeat en route a ""World Championship"" victory. Sorry, I just wanted to make mention of some other random & meaningless statistics."
"I remember going to the playoffs 10-6 and the last time that happened we won the SB... then a NE WR threw a touchdown pass on us!!! 

Team needs to win the division first and PIT is not looking like they will go down easy."

"I still don‚Äôt understand why our offense is so different from last year in playcalling and execution. Losing Yanda is part of it, but it has to be more than that."
Our offense calls to many plays that start with dumbass fakes that nobody bites on.
"Won‚Äôt be popular but Lamar isn‚Äôt progressing in his reads. He misses the tight throw too often and doesn‚Äôt make a quick read when it‚Äôs there. He waits for a big play and the line isn‚Äôt good enough this year to allow it to play out. Yanda‚Äôs departure hurts but teams have come prepared to play us now additionally. Hurst‚Äôs blocking hasn‚Äôt been replaced. 

The defense is scrappy and it‚Äôs a physically violent scheme, better than last years. The defense will make up for mistakes with forced turnovers to get us good field position, which is necessary to stack wins for us. 

Adding a receiver isn‚Äôt a bad idea, but it won‚Äôt compensate for Lamar missing open guys and waiting too long to make a decision. 

Now. I love Lamar. He‚Äôs my qb and my guy. I‚Äôm ride or die. Just honest criticism from a fan for all 25 years."
Defenses are playing smarter.
Ravens fans should be happy that they're 5-1 and stop being so whiny.
fire greg roman
This was Lamars best game throwing outside the numbers in his career
The scheme is slightly different this year too.  Last year was a lot of three tight end sets with high low concepts.  This year we only carry 2 tight ends and ricard can't run routes passed like 2 yards.  We're trying to stretch the field instead using WR but Lamar hasn't been able to hit those shots.  Oline has been poor in addition to the slight change in scheme.   The coaches are definately holding lamar back as well.  Him running is such a huge threat.  Not sure if that knee injury is what's causing it but I don't think they want to unleash lamar yet.
We have the whiniest fan base maybe in all of sports. For fucks sake we're 5-1 and people talking about people need to be fired. Enjoy the ride man.
Lamar is an average thrower
"I think we should open up trade talks with Dallas for Michael Gallup. They need a DB so I could see Marcus Peters be a decent trade to get a recover who is very good and would help us tremendously. Got flamed for saying Marcus peters got torched on Sunday, but it‚Äôs just facts."
"If you want a hot take coming from a outsider living in Baltimore, the ravens have had a cake walk schedule this year. Teams are figuring out lamar and the real issue that I see is that they have no #1 WR that was not addressed in the draft.

MB is ok but he's not a #1. He can take the top off but they need a big true #1 WR

The fact that the ravens almost lost against the Eagles today with no Jeffery, Jackson, Ertz, Godert or Sanders is scary. They were literally starting WR and TEs from practice squads and the XFL

I don't even think the ravens make the playoffs this year"
"I‚Äôm starting to think our WR issues come from our offensive coaches. A WRs first job is to catch the ball blocking is second and a nice addition to have. Boykin is really out there just blocking every play so much so he forgets to run his route

This is the 3rd game where he just did rubbish on 3rd down. If he‚Äôs not catching he shouldn‚Äôt be playing! Duv was targeted 3 times and caught all 3! That‚Äôs a 3rd WRs job!"
"A blocking WR had a place in last year‚Äôs offense. Since we‚Äôve apparently decided to throw that offense in the trash and try to be pass-first, I‚Äôm not sure what purpose he serves."
duv needs a bigger role every time he touches the ball something good happens. dude can make plays with the ball in his hands and he looks natural out there
"Out of curiosity, are you British?

Oh, I agree with what you are saying!"
"Been saying this for weeks. 

He and Snead offer no playmaking abilities and need to be schemed open. Roman hasn‚Äôt shown he can do that this year, or any other year he‚Äôs been a coordinator."
A blocking WR is a bad WR. We need guys who can get the ball. I agree with you about the coaches. The WR coach has been trash since he got here.
"Wow, we should just fire Roman and hire you!"

Can you imagine where he'd be if Torrey caught all those PI call passes?
What kind of clickbait shitty title is that?

Wow, someone isn't paying any attention! The writer knows the score, yet clearly isn't watching. Gee golly wiz, I hope Joe gets an opportunity to step onto the field this season!

Michael Gallup of Dallas for Marcus Peters. Dallas needs a DB bad and unpopular opinion incoming.... I don‚Äôt think Marcus peters is a great CB. He ballhawks himself out of position quite often and he is constantly giving up huge plays. If he stays I would like to see him moved to safety.

"The two main issues I had with Lamar today were #1, not stepping into throws/relying on the sidearm when he didn't need to (as Charles Davis pointed out on the broadcast). And #2, going way too far backwards on dropbacks to the point where using his natural scramble ability becomes a bad option and he's forced to throw it away. Oh, and he threw a few too many chunky balls for my liking.  


But man, he did pretty damn good all things considered. We can't expect him to be PERFECT every week, even if he hit 158.3 multiple times last year. At least the flaws in his game are identifiable and rectifiable week to week with good coaching."
He needs a fucking WR for crying out loud
"this confirmed what I‚Äôve been seeing all year long. lamar hasn‚Äôt really regressed, the offensive system has just been figured out by everyone else. how the fuck is a qb supposed to be successful with the amount of pressure he faces plus the lack of receiving weapons? it literally seems like our run plays are getting stuffed constantly and nobody gets open ever.  I really hope roman doesn‚Äôt waste lamar‚Äôs talent and changes some stuff to get some easy yards or we need to fire him and hire a new creative mind after this year. this run first style was cool but now we have basically no pass game and it‚Äôs fucking us over when we need to move the ball"
"No part of this offense is clicking right now.

The line is not getting a big push.  In a game where the ravens were up 18 going into the 4th quarter they were not able to open holes for the RBs.

The WR are just not getting open.  Boykins in hood for one bad option route a game.  Snead gets no separation.

Lamar needs to do a few things.  1.  Learn what a touch throw is.  2. Step into passes.  3. Throw a little more accurately.

But this all comes down to one person and thats Greg Roman.  This offense is predictable and uninspired.  They run less options.  They give up the run to quickly.  They don't run screens, which means teams can come after lamar.  I dont see slants despite having Duvarney and Hollywood.  They don't take deep shots."
"If this is Lamar‚Äôs floor, I won‚Äôt complain."
"Anytime I see QBR I hear Skips voice ""on a scale from 1 to 100""."
"We have a bye to get right and they lost Devin Bush for the year (sucks and sorry for him). On the other hand, they're playing very well on both sides of the ball in ways that we aren't.

Things I'm worried about when our offense is on the field: 
- the RG position and getting annihilated by Heyward and Watt
- our difficulty establishing the run as a result
- Minkah effectively spying Lamar 

All leading to Lamar needing to beat them with his arm. If we get the Lamar of the past 4 weeks, then we will need a defensive feast to win. 

On the positive side, I think we have the personnel to take advantage of them in the passing game, especially their linebackers vs Dobbins and Boyle/Andrews. Plus I don't think they can completely shut down Hollywood and I think Duvernay can be an excellent slot read and backfield threat to punish their aggressiveness. 

Things I'm worried about when our defense is on the field:
- we will probably not get much pass rush. Their o line is good and our rushers aren't.
- Ben has the ability to punish our blitzes. He may not be himself this year but I'm sure he has enough bullshit in the tank to piss us off a few more times. 
- Claypool looks irritating. 

I do think of our DBs ""get up"" for this game and Brandon Williams plays, we match up quite well versus their offense. In theory I'm good with Marlon and Peters vs Juju and Claypool. Queens coming along well. 

All in all I think this has to be a game plan similar to the one we rolled out against the Pats last year. Quick and horizontal to slow their pass rush and RPOs  to capitalize on their weaker secondary/backup linebackers."
"I've read on the subreddit about playing weaker opponents and having Lamar become a better passer, but I believe the Steelers are a game where we should utilize our best assets.

These next two weeks should rely on getting the run game going, working on our defensive pressure on Ben, and not getting complacent. We saw how potent our run game can be today, how pressuring a QB can work for us, and how complacency almost cost us a game. 

If we decide to air it out, they need to be plays comfortable for Lamar. When Lamar gets hot, our offense is unstoppable. I think getting good drives in the beginning to put the pressure on the Steelers could seal the deal. 

I'm excited for the game, but also hesitant. The bye should help us prepare for the game, but it's a Ravens-Steelers game, so I'm not ruling anything out."
Gonna be so mad when Wink just throws db blitzes at The Fat One and he picks apart
Nice write up. I think you hit just about all of the major points. I hope Lamar really works on stepping into his throws with more confidence instead of the more recent relaxed side arm stuff.
"I mean the Steelers have also have struggles against weaker opponents, it‚Äôs not like they are unstoppable. 

1. Fix the penalties first off, those are momentum killers. 

2. Our offense has driven down the field, we just need to finish it off with TD, not field goals.

3. Continue getting to the Qb like we have this season.

I am more optimistic then some with this game."
I‚Äôm afraid Ben is gonna pick apart our blitzes. I wouldn‚Äôt be worried if wink new how to call plays that aren‚Äôt blitzes but even against the chiefs he was like fuck it let‚Äôs keep blitzing to a detriment
"I'm drinking the ""Ravens are holding back"" kool-aid so I'm not that worried. No one really has a clue what they're talking about. Everyone favored Ravens over the Chiefs and look how that turned out. Being the narrative underdogs against the Steelers are a good thing imho."
We score more points than they do.
"I think the defense ahould do well enough if they play like they did for the first 3 quarters today.  The Steelers offense hasn't impressed me tbh, seems very predicated on the connection between Ben and Claypool, but our secondary is our biggest strength, so I feel like we can limit them there.


The Steelers have a great d line and that will cause problems.  Like you said, I'd prefer to see a lot of runs to the outside, short passes, and really grind away.  I feel like it's almost the reverse of the usual - we need to establish the pass so that the run game opens up.


And for fuck's sake, no more dumb penalties."
"Stop the penalties in key situations. That PI at the end of the game vs the Eagles could‚Äôve almost cost us the W. Luckily we got out of it, but it happened before. One big part of the L against the Titans was the fact that we played against us."
"What's up with Lamar's arm slot? He had a nifty little sidearm completion on a cross to Hollywood. That's cool. 

With a clean pocket and a guy open downfield, he's doing some goofy sidearm delivery and throwing balls into the dirt. He missed a guy by 5 yards yesterday. 

Last year he stepped into those throws and delivered darts. What's up? Injury we don't know about?"
"Might as well give up, we have no shot, trade/fire everyone. We are the worst. /s"
"every game is different. Kansas City bitched the hell out of us and then laid an egg the week prior and the week after.

Not super worried about it. It will be competitive but im sure we can figure it out."
"On defense, do not blitz with our CBs, plain and simple. They should be covering the WRs. Rush 4 or 3, and drop 7 or 8!
If we dont get to Ben, its gonna look like the Chiefs game.
On offense: Lamar just has to play smart. Cant force the ball against that defense. I hope the offense work on screens during the bye. Because i gotta feeling the Steelers are gonna blitz the living hell out of LJ on passing downs."
Trade for Juju. Steelers traded with us this off-season for wormley. Juju nota getting the targets he deserves and he‚Äôs a free agent next season.
How do we beat the Chiefs is what I want to know
Congrats to 5 years for me and the W from the Ravens.

"Let me preface this by saying how much I love our MVP QB. I remember the Kyle Boller, Grbac, Anthony Wright and Chris Redman days. For some of you new fans those were dark days. 

The #‚Äôs:  41 attempts, 238 yards, 5.8ypc and 1 TD

Besides today‚Äôs game and the one rush for 50 yards against the Bengals the numbers are abysmal. 

I‚Äôm not upset with Lamar. I don‚Äôt think any ravens fan should be upset with Lamar. I think we the fans are more baffled with the coaches who aren‚Äôt setting this guy up for success. He‚Äôs the most electric athlete in the NFL today. His running ability opens up his throwing lanes. However, Lamar has had abysmal rushing #‚Äôs this year.

So the question we as fans deserve an answer to is this:  Is Lamar not running as much because Lamar doesn‚Äôt want to run as much or is it because the coaches don‚Äôt want him to run as much? 

On one hand, Lamar might want to prove he‚Äôs an elite passer and shut up the haters. It could be possible considering how competitive he is. I personally think there‚Äôs no doubt he‚Äôs an elite passer (minus the last 3-4 games he‚Äôs played). The latter could be because they‚Äôre scheming and coaching up the pass offense or it could just be they‚Äôre not great at scheming passes (Greg Roman). Either way is a little disturbing to the bottom line of the team as a whole. Either way I hope they figure it out and play better. It‚Äôs crazy. This teams so good they are 5-1 despite playing very poorly on the offensive side of the ball. 

This offense runs well when Lamar does. What‚Äôs your thoughts"
"i personally wouldn‚Äôt say lamar is and elite passer. YET. he 100% can get there, but the covid season has definitely hurt him. no preseason, minicamp, OTAs, etc. he has little chemistry with anyone outside of hollywood and andrews. and that‚Äôs not really his fault. snead doesn‚Äôt get open, boykin blocks on pass plays, and duvernay isn‚Äôt on the field enough. as far as his rushing, the opponents are doing a fantastic job defending the read option keepers to the outside. the opponents always have more guys out there on the edge than the ravens can block. and as a result the ravens should be able to pass on these teams when they are committing to the run hard. but they don‚Äôt. they double andrews, play man with a safety to help on hollywood, and leave the rest of our pass catchers 1v1. and they don‚Äôt get open. if we could consistently get easy gains through the air, lamar would have more open lanes to run and the offense would look similar to last year. but it‚Äôs just not there. i believe they‚Äôll figure it out and lamar and the O will get better and better as we progress through the season, but the coaches and OL need to step up and do their jobs first."
Hasn‚Äôt Lamar had a knee injury for a few weeks?
he really hasn‚Äôt had to run and it makes no sense to just run him just to run him when you‚Äôre beating teams by 3 scores
"Honestly his loss on the line shows, all the pre snap penalties, the holds, the holes that the front 7 finds. When Marshal Yanda was there, shit like this didn't happen. Now though, without Yanda. The weakness is pretty clear, Yanda was the anchor on the line and with every game, those issues are showing through. 

The offense outside of the line is honestly fine ( at least today they were) the offensive line has been a constant issue over the last 5 weeks.  

Lamar is playing the best he can

So is Mark Andrews

Hollywood Brown

Nick Boyle and etc. 

It's obvious, but a shit line throws everything an offense tries into dissaray. Even with a mobile QB like Lamar. We gotta get our line situation settled. Otherwise against teams like the Steelers, who thank God we face after our bye week. Will fucking eat our lunch, no fucking joke. 


Just my two cents."
So what you're saying is that we need to spend this bye week force-feeding Yanda copious amounts of cheese doodles until he's back to his playing weight and ready to be our starting RG vs Pittsburgh in week 8
"I think lamar could play better. His sidearm passes have been very hit & miss in the short area. There was no reason for him to sidearm the pass that skipped 5 yards in front of an open mark andrews. Both of his interceptable passes today happened because of short armed throws. He needs to trust his regular motion. I also think that in the offseason, he needs to try to raise his release point. Sometimes, his release point leads to low &/or short passes. 

From a decision making standpoint, he hasn't been at his best so far this season. However, i also believe that he made progress in that respect against the eagles.

The offense doesn't only miss yanda imo. They miss hurst because they miss the 3 TE set out of the pistol. I don't think lamar necessarily misses hurst. I think g-ro does. w/o hurst, g-ro has to design creative passing plays w/ 3x1 sets. That isn't his strong suit. Never was.

I actually think lamar misses seth freaking roberts. It's sad as hell to think about but it's true. He was a vet receiver with the ability to play outside & inside. IMO, he was a better & more versatile receiver for us than snead last yr. He also made some tough catches. He only caught \~20 passes but was a guy lamar trusted. The playoff game soured us on him but now look... the guy who is supposed to excel in his stead (boykin) runs 1 wrong route per game and might be too green to be relied upon @ this point.

I think one of our offense's biggest issues is age. Losing yanda, hurst and roberts was 1 thing. Replacing all 3 with rookies (duvernay,dobbins,phillips) + fluker has led to a disjointed & inexperienced offense in many areas.

We need to remember that our offense is 2 things: young and cheap. It's younger and cheaper in key areas this yr vs. last yr. Maybe we should've anticipated their struggles considering that. However, i also believe their collective ceiling is high."
Hollywood needs to stop falling down after/during every catch.  It‚Äôs obnoxious he needs to actually get YAC.
Maybe we trade for an offensive lineman?
Yep it is the biggest issue. And the guys who were supposed to fix it were the tackles and they haven't performed well enough. Phillips has been pretty awful to the point that they finally just benched him Sunday and I think over the bye we might start working on a new RG. But continuity matters on the line so whoever we pick we need to stick with for awhile and try to get them playing as a unit.
"Thank you, captain obvious."
"That flag for DPI was complete bullshit. Pass deflection, good coverage, idk I‚Äôm not a fucking football player. But I do have eyes, and I could tell it wasn‚Äôt DPI without a replay or a rules analyst telling me so."
"Yeah, Gene Steratore, the former ref who's the CBS rules analyst, didn't like the call either.  Small consolation, but at least it's not just us Ravens fans hot under the collar.  An objective pro said it was dubious as well."
I mean the receiver and mp were both battling idk how the fuck that was pi tbh. honestly a really bad call that could‚Äôve led to a loss but luckily our d stepped up at the right time
"I love how referees always manage to make this call only at the end of a game near a comeback.  I mean all game they let stuff go then suddenly they feel the need to throw the flag to ensure a comeback is possible.

Funny enough, I don‚Äôt even think it is anti raven or any conspiracy against us.  It just seems to be the way it happens in most NFL games .  Wait to a huge moment to bother throwing the flag.  It could just be that is human nature"
"Bowser got mugged on that play, too, and begged for a flag to no avail. Thus, at the very least, there should have been offsetting penalties. So instead, of course Shawn Smith's crew attempted to job out Baltimore again, just like the final drive @ Buffalo last season!

Sooner or later, that squad is going to cost the Ravens a game. The Ravens received 4x as many flags and 6.6x the amount of total penalty yards compared to the Eagles: 12 for 132 vs. 3 for 20. Calls being that lopsided at the highest level is absolutely unacceptable!"
"It was a terrible call. Truly terrible.

But this aside, I can‚Äôt stand fans that spend the whole game moaning about holding calls and the other team not getting called. It happens to all teams every week. I‚Äôm sure there were holes that didn‚Äôt get flagged too. Watch around the league and you‚Äôll see it every single week. 

What I hate is when it‚Äôs clearly one sided. Either be really picky with holding and do that for both sides or be loose with it etc."
The refs did their best to keep the eagles in this game. Deshaun Elliot should have an interception
"No offense, but you‚Äôre completely wrong in your ‚Äúpass deflection‚Äù reasoning. 

The deflection aspect of the rule means PI can‚Äôt happen after its deflected, not that there‚Äôs no PI if the defender eventually deflects it. I could be wrong on this play since I can‚Äôt find a replay, but I doubt it was tipped at the line since it was 50 yards down the field. 

Still was a bad call, but not because it was deflected."

Willis McGahee back when Rice was the starter
"He wasn't the best by a long shot, but I really liked having Ricky Williams on the team that last year of his career"
"In terms of how good of a carrer he had, Priest Holmes should be it"
"McGahee, LeRon McClain, and my personal choice of Chester Taylor"
"We‚Äôve had plenty of great #2s, so I wouldn‚Äôt go that far yet. He has been kicking butt though."
Priest Holmes when he was 2 behind Jamal Lewis in 2000.
I have him on my fantasy team and can't believe he hasn't gotten more action in games
"It was sad watching him play tonight. I think if Darnold stays back, we may never see Joe again. 

I genuinely cheered my heart out for every completion and for BOTH of their 3rd down conversions. That 30 yard sack was awesome! He hands off the ball off SO FUCKING GOOD. That cadence 180000 sethut! Flacco's favorite

RIP iron dick elite dragon, I will remember you forever."
He‚Äôs just stealing money from the Jets. This doesn‚Äôt count.
"I love the guy as I've said many times here. Any one of you who doubts that he has the heart of a champion and a desire to \*win\* can F off. 

But he's been playing professional football for many years now, and Father Time is undefeated. I just hope, when he hangs up his cleats for the last time, he has his health."
I‚Äôm a Ravens fan but a bigger USC fan so I‚Äôm torn.
"It was nice to see what a bad NFL offense looks like again. Vintage Flacco in that game. 

Also, not that it matters, but I‚Äôm pretty sure he‚Äôs saying ‚Äúwhite 80‚Äù"

Purple is too neon.
I love our purple we already have. Almost blue.
Looks like a Halloween sticker
That would make a decent color rush jersey. Put us in a thursday night game with the Seahawks in their neon green and us in neon purple and I'd like it.
I definitely prefer a darker purple.
Is all I have to say about today.
You guys will bounce back. It did have a chiefs vibe to it. I felt like we were exposed that game and the same could be said for packers ‚òπÔ∏è
"Hey man, it happens. We got smoked against KC at home. Your record is still very good and you'll bounce back."
"You know what? After watching back the highlights I'm not as pissed. Offensive line was BAD. But playcalling was better. Lamar looked sharper. Defense had a bit of a collapse but they held tight late.

It seemed like a effort was made also to get lamar passes outside the numbers and he stepped up and made those passes. That's a big move for his improvement. I think the next step might be improving the consistency of his spiral and getting some of the sidearms out of his game. Of course the deep ball but I think that will come soon enough, he hasn't been able to reel it in just yet"
"We're still scoring points and winning but we're being held back by the offense themselves with miscommunication and penalties.

Either we improve this bye week or we start losing games."
""
And we also passed up on DJ Moore and Calvin Ridley
we are so trash at drafting and developing wrs it‚Äôs laughable
Don't remind me
"The ACL tear really set him back but the pick looks even worse in hindsight. He was a raw prospect with only one quality year of production playing in a relatively average conference. 

Five years on, another WR drafted in the 1st and you could easily argue the team still needs a *true* \#1 WR."
And then gave up on seriously addressing that position through the draft until after we changed GMs.
"I like our 2 guys this year even if they are currently limited roles.  They both have great hands.  With Boykin having trouble each week, I think they will start getting in the game more."
It's not that we drafted him the 1st round but he's still in the league
"Perriman was actually good last yr. Shocking, I know.

A team needs to rescue him from the hellscape that is the jets."

"I know a lot of people want a midseason trade to get Lamar some WR help, but this offseason has too many free agent weapons to not wait. Keenan Allen, Chris Godwin, and my personal favorite, Allen Robinson. This guy paired up with Lamar would be absolutely elite. I know the team likes to improve upon whichever part needs the most improvement, such as last year with the defense and linebackers. And look at us now, our defense is probably the best in the league! I'm confident this offseason if we can get a WR weapon and maybe a great O-Lineman from the draft, we'll be golden, and Allen Robinson seems like an opportunity too good for the front office to pass up. What do you guys think about this?"
would be nice but i think he‚Äôs gonna be way out of range and will require some cap shuffling
"I'm going to die on this hill. 

The ravens biggest need right now is not receivers. Yesterday showed the range of our recieving corp. Brown, Boykin, Snead, Andrews, Boyle, Duverney, and Dobbins all caught passes. We have weapons. They're young but they're weapons. 

Our biggest issue and its glaring and I dont know why people want to push it off... is the hole left by Yanda. 

You can look at stats by side of the offensive line. Rushes to the right side result in fewer yards consistantly. Blitzes from the right side land more more often. Jackson is under more pressure when rolling to the right. It is our weakness. Our run game is suffering and our deep play options are suffering because that side of the offensive line is completely terrible. 

I do not want to see us waste what very little cap space we have left for this season on a high cost veteran WR when it wont fucking matter. All the weapons on the world arent going to make that hole disappear. We need a quality guard before we add anymore weapons."
"We‚Äôre looking at $137mill committed to 2021, that would mean $38mill in room for the predicted cap.  There‚Äôs a few key guys that need to be replaced or resigned: Stanley, Judon, Snead, Wolf, Skura, Bowser, McPhee, Ward and Gus.  

The good news is that most teams are looking at scary cap situations with the cap going down next season.  That could limit competition for FAs.  And with the cap expected to go up to $225m, you can get away with structuring the contract for a lower year 1 hit without too much trouble.  

I would prioritize the DL/Edge in free agency, but I don‚Äôt hate the idea of adding Robinson.  With Judon, McPhee, Wolf, and Ward pending FAs in an already weak group, that‚Äôs going to need a lot of moves just to get back to the current quality of the group, let alone improving."
"Keenan Allen just signed a contract extension with the Chargers (4yr $80M), so he's gonna be unavailable. I would love to have have Allen Robinson but I think it's highly unlikely he comes here."
Why would the bears trade him? They are 5-1 tied for the lead in thier division.. Need to look at teams with 1-4 records staring at a rebuild.
Let‚Äôs go after Juju
"At the risk of answers being overly positive due to recency bias... 2 forced fumbles yesterday was pretty awesome... Pretty much the title.

Expectations post-earl have ranged from ""we cut earl for him, he better back it up"" to ""he's a sixth round pick who's never done anything but get hurt, let's be real."""
"He‚Äôs looked good with room for improvement, exactly what you‚Äôd expect out of a guy who‚Äôs basically not played before this."
Homestly at first i was one of them people who was biased saying this and that about him i cant lie but these last couple games hes made me eat my words and im glad he seems like hes molding into that position a little time getting used to seemed to be all he needed
He‚Äôs played well. He‚Äôs been aggressive. With a few lapses in coverage but he does everything 100%. The more experience he gets the more he can fine tune things. I think the bye week will do some good for him. I think him and chuck are similar players  (hybrid safeties) which is a plus because they can alternate roles. I like him Wink has been high on him for years.
"He's always shown promise, now he's showing he can replicate and even exceed what he was showing in practice and in the preseason.

Having Clark and Elliott back there is the best safety combo we've had since Reed and Landry."
Dude plays hard and wants to hit someone every play.  I like him.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs hurt us at all. He also has better speed and range than Earl at this point(age catches up with everyone). The real bonus is no more drama and baggage that came with Earl.
"Pleasantly surprised. Pretty late in the off-season, and this year of all years, to be named starter and still play well.

Dude thumps and he has shown promise in coverage. Seems like an unheralded Budda Baker to me."
"I've been pleasantly surprised. I always knew he had talent but the injuries were hard to overcome. 

I don't think he's been amazing or anything, but he hasn't made too many mistakes, tackles hard, has improved consistently. He's been all around solid."
Better than I expected. If he can stay healthy and keep learning he could be a really really important piece of this defense
"He's good. Good tackler, doesn't make mistakes in coverage, and has the burst/suddenness that allows him to be an amazing blitzer."
Serviceable starter caliber player. Better than Kendrick Lewis.
I feel like if he can stay healthy he has the intangibles and the drive to be a great safety.
Pretty good for someone who wasn't a starter before.
Dudes a missile. I‚Äôm just worried about him hurting himself coming in too hot.
"He's a physical force for sure, but he makes a few mistakes a game. If he gets the mental part down he's a decent starter. Right now all he's good for is delivering punishment though, imo. That's just my eye test"

He already has 3 Pro Bowl selections (as many as Vinatieri), 5 All-Pro selections (including 4 first team selections to Vinatieri's 3 *total* selections), he's on the 2010s all-decade team, he has a ring, and he leads the NFL in all-time field goal %.

All this and he's played roughly 1/3 as long as Vinatieri has in the NFL."

"He‚Äôs not an elite thrower of the football, but he‚Äôs solid and an elite talent with his legs. Is it because of the hype he garners? Is it his personality? Like why do people enjoy watching him struggle? Maybe it‚Äôs just because I get lost in the twitter comment section too much, but man people can be straight a**holes on there. 

For me only one thing matters... He‚Äôs fun to watch. That‚Äôs the whole point of football. To entertain and Jackson does that for me. I wish I could drown out the haters of the world. I would be a much happier person if I didn‚Äôt go on twitter as much, but I rely on it for football news. 

Sorry for the early rant."
"Pretty much every QB gets hated on. Flacco was a Superbowl MVP and still got crap.  When you play at an extremely competitive level and people aren't a fan of your team, they're going to nit pick."
"Because they were wrong about him. ""Experts"" thought he should be a WR. Then, he went to the Ravens and shocked the football world, becoming MVP in his 1st full season. He's in the right organization, and once he wins a SB, he'll get the respect he deserves.."
"First, Twitter is a gigantic toilet bowl.

Second, everyone hates successful people.

Third, fuck everyone who hates on Lamar."
"Twitter hates everything.  While people, black people, cows, cars, gasoline, women, men, lgbt, those who don‚Äôt like lgbt, honesty, dishonesty, trump, Biden, Republicans, Democrats etc etc etc etc

I want to know why people care.  The social media world is one big hate fest right now and I choose to ignore it.

If you think about it Lamar is good.  People are scared.  Of course they want him to fail.  They don‚Äôt want to have to play him.  The same way we wanted Brady and Manning to lose."
He‚Äôs unapologetically black.
Im critical of him for sure. I want him to be as great as he can potientially be.
"I deleted twitter two years ago and I don't regret it at all. That shit has a terrible way of affecting your mood with all the bullshit that's on there. Delete it, friend, it'll have a positive effect on you in more ways than you know."
"Agree w everyone who says that Twitter is trash. If you want my opinion, I think the flak primarily comes from 3 groups: 

1.  Racists/Haters. I think this is the smallest group (might be naive of me), so I will not spend any more time here. 

2. Jealous teams/fanbases. I think there are a lot of teams (and fans of those teams) who see LJ and are frustrated with themselves for not being so forward looking as Harbaugh/Ozzie/DeCosta. 

3. People who want to see improvement. You wrote that the point of football is entertainment, so why are they giving LJ so much grief. I think that is partially true. I think that you can get only so much entertainment from losing. Winning is much more entertaining. LJ has not been as good as he can be this year and it‚Äôs not unfair for fans and objective watchers to criticize his mistakes and expect better play. 

Was he more entertaining this year or last year?"
"Everyone hates Everyone,  mostly"
"They had a narrative around him in college coming in to the draft and they want that narrative to be right so bad.

The other thing is just rivals taking smack to each other."

"I get that hes not an ""elite"" thrower yet but dude led the league in pass tds last year so put some respect on his throwing ability."

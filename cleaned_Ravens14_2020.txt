whoever owns the rights to these beatles songs doesnt play they just now are allowed on youtube for the longest time you couldnt listen to any of their songs on there
lots of phish songs too
big fan of both as well im glad they did pay their respects to lennon though with the footage
probably dont have rights to play it
fox has been playing the dead and phish all season always seems weird to me considering foxs political leanings vs those of those bands typically

i agree which is hard to admit because i love ingram as a part of the ravens but he just hasnt produced this year
yep pretty sad to say but looks like he wont be on the team next year unless he takes a pay cut thats the way i see it at least we clear 5 mil in cap if we do
i just hope we hang on to gus him an dobbins for years to come would make me happy whatever we have to do to make that happen lets do it either way roman really should start to game plan around jk want to see him get 20 touches a game similar to rr when he was here


and yea since the first steelers game i have been thinking the same
are yall seeing gus
so brave
wed get too many yards that hurts romans brain
i think mark would legit be so happy getting less touches and just being a locker room guyhype man did you see how pumped he got for dobbins td
please make it happen jk needs more than just 2 snaps in a row he should stay in until he needs a breather like others have said it is frustrating to see the rb rotate in nearly every offensive snap
its kinda sad how rbs regress so quickly no matter how good the drop in a couple years is so evident
shop yannick and ingram in the offseason for a wr1 dobbins and gus 12 punch
i love ingram hes just old but when he retires we should hire him as a coach because his leadership is so valuable
right dobbins and edwards are both better
sometimes hollywood makes me angry but not this time what a throw and a great catch
perfect throw
thats lamar for ya he will miss some throws then hit u with a beauty
lamar has had some trouble throwing the ball this game but that was beautiful love that guy
soulja caught something
finally hollywood got off twitter and did a thing
that was a gorgeous play
love to see that connection again good adjustment on the route and perfect throw and catch
up vote
im surprised a wr on our team could catch a ball like that usually its dropped
i cant believe he actually caught a ball
must be 2020
he has had a good past two games
dont call him hollywood till he earns that nickname he doesnt deserve it yet
watching that replay and in slow motion several times

i know its a difficult catch but he still didnt catch it with his hands and he almost bobbled it out of catching it all together

to my highly untrained eye it seems that it was more luck than skill

i still dont trust him
is it just me or is troy just shitting all over lamar all game in the commentary
you dont need to say in peace bro you guys killed the steelers yesterday you stay here as long as you like
yeah hes being completely biased cause of his cowboys oh well lamar is still having a good game hes just mad his boys getting beat

great w yesterday that defense played lights out
any week the dmv wins and rivals lose it was a good week this is a good week fuck the cowboys steelers eagles penguins phillies flyers etc
hes a company man kinda expected
yep he really seems to want dallas to win
i mean it just gives lamar more motivation more doubters to prove
just rememberfuck dem stillers
i was yelling at him the whole game not that he heard me
no hes trashing the cowboys too thanks for the win yesterday
im not sure what he said that is not true on the pass ten feet over boykins head he immediately pointed out how lamars elbow dropped that is a mechanical criticism by someone who has played qb i hope somebody on our team is telling lamar that stuff

we did the thing
this did not age well
how aboutcowboyss 2020 playoff apperance percentage
jihad ward had himself a sack so back to being inexplicably inactive next game
why is there literally no pressure were blitzing often we cant get to the qb to save our life

where are all the yannake truthers i dont see him doing much and dallas is playing a bunch of backups on their line not a specific shot at only him but man nothing is working to get to dalton

edit and we immediacy see ward get a sack on third down
our defense is worrying me and have been for the last 3 quarters
the one strength of the cowboys is their offense and we gave up 17 points
poor greg the leg he was a top tier kicker not long ago
but yeah the defense has been shaky especially the d line with a practice squad o line
yeah they looked off tonight got no pressure for 3 quarters
after seeing their kicker miss a whole bunch of them it kinda makes me realize how much i am taking tucker for granted
and his nickname is legatron
he might be sitting at home next week lol
he was very good with the rams not anymore
did we tip that last one
he couldnt hit the harbor from fells point

i do too but i love ricard
im still annoyed we didnt use him more when he was here he was our best weapon on o for a while but we kept forcing throws to loser wrs
blertimore fullback factory
have we used ricard at dlinr at all this season

id be surprised considered how thin our line was at one point

he needs to take an offseason where hopefully corona isnt as bad and go extremely in on his mechanics theyve been ugly as hell this season
really well is a bit of a stretch hes underthrown and overthrown a lot of deep passes this season really his accuracy needs work from any distance
idk how much every team practices with this covid shit so i hope part of the issues are from lack of practice time
personally feel its the opposite i think medium passes is what hes worst at sometimes he unnecessarily lobs them like on the touchdown pass he threw in the second quarter im happy we got the td but still the receiver almost tumbled because he had to reach out for it if it was on a bullet he couldve just turned and went
is lamar a great passer no at least not yet

but my goodness did we overvalue our receivers going into this season

hollywood is a 2 at best he does not get open he does not get separation and his speed is not being used the last part is probably scheme and play calling last night he caught a ball and went back 2 yards

boykin and snead literally ran into each other on a play i think it was kc

andrews makes some great catches but man he drops a lot of balls

duvernay shows potential but maybe we are overestimating him too who knows

proche has not shown anything other than steady hands when catching returns which honestly is pretty big given some of our seasons lately

x200b

we just pass on way too many good receivers in the draft man as much as i have really loved some of decostas moves when it comes to wr looks to be as bad as ozzie

and a part of me wonders if we drafted metcalf aj brown justin jeffersson would they be as good with us as they are with other teams and thats not cause of lamar thats cause of coaching

one last thing ill say about lamar we know he can make the throws but you gotta make the throws consistently if he cant do that then it wont work in the nfl
lamar can throw the ball however hes not really accurate at any level his td pass to boykin was high and behind his interception was bc he missed hollywood who admittedly put minimal effort in catching the ball he showed marked improvement from year 1 to year 2 but this year it seems like he has gotten worse

i will say that td pass to hollywood was outstanding moreover his decision making is great if he becomes an accurate qb then he can be special
removed
gave up 17 points 10 of which were on a short field not of their doing oh and 7 of those shouldnt have happened if harbs challenges that lj fort interception

gave up 13 points last week

3rd in the league in points given up

quit being such a drama queen the defense played well
nah bro not pathetic overrated sure but theyre still better than most other squads just chill and enjoy the w
campbell not himself williams just back mcphee just back judon out smith out t williams out they had a lot of guys coming off a pretty severe illness lets chill
shut up they shut down the steelers last week lol
this seems like a more conservative game plan by wink jimmy smith and tramon williams being injured campbell and brandon williams just coming back from the covidinjury list no judon
a win is a win thats all that matters now
pathetic no they had a bad game it happens peters and averett were getting burned and even marlo got burned a few times looks like we had trouble tackling

idk why we as ravens fan try say our defense is the best and then we shit on them if they have a bad game yes there are problems but our defense is our backbone this year they arent pathetic
dude andy dalton is familiar with us and cowboys are loaded with offensive weapons just enjoy the win
did we find aikmans reddit account
the wagon has left so go join the band
theyre punks waiting to be exposed by a good offense
removed
got a lot of holes but a win is a win need harbaugh to fix this going into the browns game or were gonna get destroyed
we have to fix some shit but its just good to get that w again
e z
maybe roman will remember to run the ball next week it is indeed easy money
orlando brown isnt a flashy choice but he might be my favorite raven hope he gets paid when its time
i demand an easy money tshirt asap
when he shouted easy money the 45 point total bet i made came in cowboys kicker almost fucked me on that one
man im so glad we got the win but i wish brad didnt ice tuck on that kick
do we get mark andrews back before monday
orando brown jr 78 ot
hope this game boost up the moral what a fucking run over
easy money baby

brotha have you heard about the pandemic
yikes
dem boyz lucky trace mcsorley didnt come in for a drive the goat wouldve dimed them up

if there is any chance of us making the playoffs and doing something in the post season this will be the game that will start it off
definitely a chance we get into the playoffs theres even a chance we drop another game and still make playoffs because a lot of the wc teams play each other in the next coming weeks and lv ind and mi have tough schedules to close out the season if we get to the playoffs im not sure what to expect doe
not a chance
longer with hand simulating throwing cash


just the phrase
you the real mvp of the game brobro
gonna have to change my username to urubboldbaxtertheg0at after this
removed
i love how you were really nice and everyones shitting on you cause of your team lmao fuck you though
we arnt beating kc either i dont think it matters
respectfully

typical steelers fan education
im sorry but what on earth does this title mean
jeeze man you okay seems kinda sad to post this guy
well i think i am going to be right baltimore is going to be a very tough out this year good luck im not a big fan of the ravens obviously but lamar jackson is a really good kid
and blame that missed field goal on al michaels he jinxed it by saying justin tucker never misses

why is my dudes eyes popping out of his head


not a bad win but this team is so fucking inconsistent i just dont get it offense is good 1 drive defense sucks
defense is good but then the offense sucks both are good st lays an egg
and then the boneheaded penalties unfortunately at this point it is what it is
the better team won good for yall and most importantly good for lamar i hope i see him play many more seasons in the nfl
our secondary looked like doodoo tonight
ez money
294 rushing yards

lamar had 0 sacks

boykin and hollywood looking good out there
we played a lot worse than the score says which has been the case a lot this year
take the win and move onto cleveland plain and simple sure lots of things sans the running game could have gone much better tonight but even with the circumstances a win is still a win next monday against the browns is crucial to keeping the ravens playoff hopes alive at least andrews and snead iv should return too giving the offense a boost in the passing game

i just wish dez bryant is alright and there isnt another outbreak on the horizon putting everyone and their health at risk again no more than a week later
whew
good start to the comeback tour
lj
ggs boys nice win onto the next lets clean up in practice and be healthy for cleveland
nice win today rbs looked solid 4 more wins to go
thanks guys now you gotta do it to the giants for us ok
easy money

in a must win game we execute so proud of the boys

we had 3 rushers over 70 yards 1 of which gus was over 100 2 had tds insane
monday will be the test
lamar balled out 1 day of practice off covid and got 200 yards total 70 percent completion percentage and 3 tds
harbs and mccarthy are talking about how they arent allowed to shake hands meanwhile lamar is having a 10second embrace with a cowboy at midfield
not the cleanest game but happy we won pretty convincingly
thank god a win

please play well next week against the shitstain browns k thx
defense definitely has to tighten up literally everything but a w feels good
feels good to be back in the w column
good to see lamar and others back on the field the defense will need a better game next week
can we give credit to an opposing player dalton played well tonight
pass rush was suspect though
id say that game was a success given the circumstances minimum practice missing players but we really executed on the ground oline was terrific lamar was inconsistent some bad misses some amazing plays and as always an absolute force in the running game i would say he overall played well

gus and jk are probably players of the game they ran with a vengeance and made a ton of people miss secondary and pass rush leave a lot to be desired but the cowboys came at us with a good game plan offensively lots of quick outs to neutralize our aggressive blitzes and zone wink will have us better adjusted for cleveland

week 9 marcus peters honorable mention to ublacramento
week 10 matt skura blame

week 12 steve small dick saunders blame

this weeks nominees are
the running game

in particular gus edwards

dude had 101 yards on only 7 carries he made something good happen every time he touched the ball
all aboard the gus bus

edit and the patchwork ol paving big lanes for gus jk lamar and even ingram at the end
run game cant single out anyone cause they all came to destroy this defense
fort 100 lamar is too obvious
gus edwards

dude is a beast
rushing game lamar lj fort
lamar calling off the fg unit and then having a huge td run on 4thi meanthats the lamar we know

huge after no practice for 2 weeksrusty team coming off a bizarre covid weekjust a huge confidence booster
jk dobbins
the running game
lamar jackson right yeah some of his passing wasnt pretty at all tonight but i chalk that up to only having a single practice since being activated did he actually get to have a practice session this week besides his td hookup with marquise brown in stride was sweet and his running was once again electric all great signs after getting cleared from covid19

honorable mentions go to both gus edwards and jk dobbins the run game as a whole really gave the ravens the win over the cowboys
lamar coming off of covid and not playing for 2 weeks i thought he had a great game considering the circumstances
lamar seriously after all hes been through with covid and on a skid he came out and played his own game recovered early from a pick that wasnt entirely his fault and took absolute control over this game

his 4 2 td reminded me of last year vs the seahawks which was the turning point that season hes the mvp and team leader and he showed that tonight without his favorite target in andrews
jerry jones
gus bus and dobbins
gus edwards had the best game statistically 7 carries for 101 yards but dobbins was great too our future 1 back
run game
offensive line finally putting it together albeit vs the worst defense in the league but a much needed confidence boost
oline outside of one bad snap they played a clean game kept lamar from getting sacked and opened up some huge holes for our run game
marquise soulja boi brown
llama jackson and the run game
run game lamar gus dobbins ft ingram

also honorable mention greg the leg zurlien for leaving 9 pts off the board
the backs but id like to personally say gus was the shit tonight
lamar jackson
ok now hear me out greg roman
run game
can i say lamar
running backslj8 especially after covid week
whole team deserves praise welcome back
give it to gus

his vision tonight was exquisite he also showed off a few nasty cuts and featured his usual punishing run style i think he averaged over 10 yards per carry on the night
jk dobbins gus edwards and lamar jackson
greg the leg zuerlein

but fr llama
gus edwards
gus edwards followed by lamar and jk
ricard and the left side of the o line had some amazing pulls that set up the big runs
gus edwards he punishes the hell out of defenses in the second half week in and week out
can we have an asterisk for blame of the game and vote joe buck
lj fort
lets goo
the running game passing game was ok defense wasnt great special teams wasnt great the running game carried us today
dobbins a stud lamar balled out tho
run game jk dobbins gus edwards lamar jackson feed the run feed it
gus and jk
lj fort
running backs
jk and gus can share this title
run game
run game
tough gus dobbins and lamar all went off

i think just the whole run game
rbbc

ran all up and down that godawful cowboys defense

3 rushers over 70 yards 2 tds from 4 runners 1 over 100 yards
tie gus and dobbins
lamar jackson
the o line
the run game
run game
pat ricard key blocks came backplayed through injury
run game lamar mvp jackson
for me its patrick queen
running game

lamar gus jk and even ingram all contributed good ol fashioned ravens rushing game is exactly what we needed lamar was rusty in passing but rushing more than made up for it
run game
no one
the running backs
run game all of it
the running game as a whole everyone ateeven ingram so i think that they should all share it imo
gus i guess honestly dont know who else to pick with how everyone performed
moving the legs in a motion that make you go zoom
the dallas run defence
ill say oline with gus secondary as well as gus lamar and dobbins played when you get almost 300 rushing yards a lot of credit has to go to the o line by default
im not saying he lost the game for dallas but i feel like zuerlein deserves a shoutout for three missed kicks

hey legatron how are things are things ok
dobbins gus lamar ingram run blocking is that too many people lol
can we just appreciate that steve small dick saunders is immortalized in this list
jk dobbins
lamar ill do it myself jackson
lamar he seems like hes finally getting back to 2019 lamar just needs to fix the kinks in the passing game
im saying gus was great and so were jk and lamar but orlando brown blocked like a fucking tank for all 3 of our leading rushers
rushing attack with hinirable mention to the gus bus
the running game
lamar jackson the run game was great and a lot of people are calling for gus and dobbins but they are consistently good yet most likely wouldnt have had the same success without lamar under center this game would not have been won if not for lamar coming back to form he had some terrible throws which is to be expected being away with covid and no practice but his runs and clutch passes when it mattered took the game away
the run game is the obvious choice here but derek wolfe and fort were monsters
gusdobbins
not sure if my response is allowed but i have two players lj fort and jk dobbins really impressed me gus edwards already really impressed me all season because he is the teams best runningback and lj fort was in every single tackle on the goal line snap he was a crutail role to our defenses success
lamar he did make some early on mistakes but this was one of the more solid games of the year for him he was consistent and proved that he can bounce back after a pick early on
lammy jacksawn
gus bus baby he went off same with dobbins
a much needed win
removed
i feel sorry for people that legitimately think what is said in front of a tv screen somehow has an effect on the game

for some reason not being mad at the end of a ravens game feels nostalgic to me lol
yessir onto cleveland


the ravens have just made the cowboys rushing defense fall to 33rd in the league behind the xfl houston roughnecks
steelers lose and ravens win most satisfying 48 hours of the season
lets go i forgot what winning felt like
we ran through them 294 yards loved that 4th most in franchise history on the ground

so happy lamar is back i love him and him connecting with hollywood is huge

pass rush and secondary underperformed tonight but campbell is still hurt and judon is back and jimmy smith probably next week and andrews and snead

jihad played fantastic so did lamar and dobbins and the oline

great win onto cleveland
we dropped 300 rushing yards this game everybody stop and appreciate greg romans run scheming

now onto making him step down and getting an oc who can pass scheme

edit i still wanna keep gro cuz hes a rush game genius
easy money
pass rush was disappointing however cowboys tackles got away with egregious holds all night long jihad ward had a good game would be pretty cool if he turned into something in baltimore after we basically picked him up as a castoff people are down on yannick sort of the nature of game threads but hes a proven pass rusher at the nfl level hasnt clicked yet in production but i think hes gotten more pressure than people realize anyways those are my stupid little thoughts i typed out for you all
two words easy money
ravens rushed for a whopping 294 yards vs cowboys sgellison

gus edwards 101 yards
lamar jackson 94 yards
jk dobbins 71 yards
mark ingram 28 yards
great team win dezbryant
all i want for christmas is to destroy the browns
i hope people realize thats how wins feel for a lot of teams not everything perfect but do enough to get it done and pull away a bit at the end
we get back to our roots and look at that our team actually looks like theyre having fun for like the second time all year let these souljas run the ball and then it opens up the passing game its not rocket scienece lets go



on another note no matter what happens this season just remember that the whole nfl has kind of been fucked by this covid thing guys chemistry probably isnt as good as it was last year we lost a hof guard and had basically no time to gel the oline guys arent allowed to practice



if this bullshit like lamars inconsistency defense being hot and cold greg roman being an idiot carries over next season then we should worry especially lamars shit hes been pretty bad throwing but 100 think that its because of the fuckery of the nfl this year lets just try to enjoy football being played for now
lamar said he felt slow in the beginning nigga had covid last week and had mild symptoms calm down with the throwing takes
back in the win column we ran the ball life is good
relatively easy money
damn im not mad after a ravens game
lamar plays better when he gets to play street ball look at the perfect td to hollywood we need to get another pass catcher that can improvise like mandrews and hollywood at time does those two have said themselves they play like its in the street
cleveland will have a letdown after beating the titans you guys will be fired up and take it to them
credit where credit is due roman ran the damn ball and it worked now do it again
im still hopeful for hollywood the tweet is a thing of the past and hes looked more in form the past few games of course he needs massive development to get to his potential but theres times this year and last he and lamar looked special hopefully some good coaching and route running will help him throughout this year and into next and make him a threat ps i wanna see some duvernay
imma sleep good tonight
i hate that in every game the team thats winning gets talked about the whole time but not when its the cowboys aikman just wouldnt shut the fuck up about the cowboys ravens got zero credit the entire game and aikman tried his best to discredit the clearly missed ford int and that proche didnt clearly recover the onside kick back to back with 20 seconds and honestly it triggered me dude sucks
i dont like that we have been using the acronym obj when referring to orlando brown because i instinctively think of odell beckham
1 down
4 to go

lets get it
reposting because the other thread was  for some reason take the win and move onto cleveland plain and simple sure lots of things sans the running game could have gone much better tonight but even with the circumstances a win is still a win next monday against the browns is crucial to keeping the ravens playoff hopes alive at least andrews and snead iv should return too giving the offense a boost in the passing game

i just wish dez bryant is alright and there isnt another outbreak on the horizon putting everyone and their health at risk again no more than a week later
lowkey thought this might be good for lamar bc since andrews was out he was forced to throw more to the wrs not saying it was perfect far from it but it did look like there was better chemistry between lamar and the receivers
we ate a w
if we can dominate the los and really run preferably using only jk and gus keeping our passing game simple and schemed to our strengths over the middle and underneath and really commit to fundamental tackling we will be damn hard to beat its a long stretch to the sb but seeing the team smile and the sparks we had tonight gives me real belief in this team again
hell yeah ravens

much better although we really need to work on the pass d
justin tucker is about to post a notes app apology and change his profile pic to be all black
why was the old thread  lol
lets start stacking those wins the run game gave me hope even against that abysmal defense we need to get our own defense in order but i believe
love what lamar did with the legs gotta hit those throws next week though

good team win great confidence booster
missed the end of the game but did the 4th quarter feel like a whole new game to anyone else like play calling of last year
did yall even punt
i think what we found out tonight is that the offense can still be a real wrecking ball when we dominate up front what worries me is that we havent really been dominant at all this year and that this was the 32nd ranked rush defense that we did it to it is possible that weve finally found the right oline combo to get the job done but to me more likely is we just played the right team and we still need to make some adjustments to get to the point where we can be legit contenders

we scored both passing touchdowns on play action tonight but i think those were the last two times we ran play action in the game i see more play action as the easy adjustment to take us from meh to really good on the offensive side of the ball and i genuinely think if we do it on monday we can easily beat cleveland again if we dont ill be honest im worried
pass rush and secondary a little concerning today
deshon elliot has earned a new nickname in my mind and thats the trash man

its because he cleans up everyone elses trash tackles with huge hits really impressive game and development by him this year
good run game lamar jackson miles boykin run defense

bad our entire secondary specifically marcus peters our pass rush justin tucker missing a field goal
a w and no significant injuries that i can think of phew
this run game with our defense from the steelers game and were looking good
covid antibodies activated lamars superpowers
seems like every deep ball thrown humphreys way gets called for defensive pi this year and averaging one sack per game since the bye and since acquiring ngakoue is not going to cut it run game looked amazing but lamar missing easy passes cant just be shrugged off easy to laugh at it when were up by double digits late but he has to hit those

good win need to carry that run game over to cleveland next week
even if their run d is alltime trash its nice to see it get going still think the ravens should be a more spread system
does anyone have a screen grab of bozeman making the touchdown sign while lamar still has like 15 yards to go saw the replay briefly and thought it was awesome
romans playcalling is still shit
regardless of the score this was an ugly win

lamar is off on his 3 and 5 step drops his mechanics have regressed it definitely is a mixture of ol play with poor pass protection wrs not getting open and passing concepts regardless its causing him to act frazzled at times and not see the field or make errant throws

i will not say this enough this d is not good enough regardless of stats we have coverage breakdowns consistently ill timed penalties and absolutely 0 pass rush we desperately need a pass rusher

were 75 and ill take the w but im pretty worried rest of the way out right now theres 0 chance we beat landry chubb hunt and co when we face the browns
good team win boys that last jk dobbins score got me into my fantasy playoffs i was down 11286 to 11292 going into that drive my opponent had tucker and if we kicked a field goal i was done lets gooooo
i feel like a lot of people are gonna point to lamars stats when arguing on whether hes a top 5 qb or not its obvious he is butthey gotta let him throw more
lost a loved one to covid today this game meant a lot
jtucks field goal was good
did dez really quit this season
great game gave them great starting position plenty of times and it didnt bite us in the ass run game looked immaculate and we can certainly build off this game feeling confident going down the final stretch
proud of the team a lot to clean up but if they beat cleveland ill start to get excited about playoff prospects
we have to go on a run now if we wanna make the playoffs like it or not lamar has to throw a lot better we will get absolutely crushed if that pass game does not start catching up running can only take you so far
the best weve looked all season granted it was against the worst rushing defense but have to take what we can get this year
lamar jackson
good finish gotta clean up those penalties well be good
great job on pass blocking
defense looked bad but glad to get a win also good to see lamar smiling and having fun a lot to work on and a tough opponent coming up but some signs of life was nice
lets go beat the clowns next week
gotta keep the foot on the gas onto cleveland
i felt like there were maybe 1 or miles boykin flashes i hope to god these continue and this wasnt just a result of a bad dallas defense
i sincerely hope we used this as a tune up to beat cleveland they need to get humbled
this was more than just another game for me it wasnt about revenge i didnt need a catch i wanted to make a point dezbryant
congrats ravens i post here as well on this sub but its the only time a route against the ravenswhen they play the cowboys
the fact that most of the team came back from covid its good to get that rust off and get that win

theyll have to fix their holes for next week but if we can get past cleveland i have no doubt we make it to playoffs
im so relieved that we won but i still cant get over how good jk dobbins looks and how we consistently still use him as our 3rd rb sometimes even 4th behind justice hill on 3rd downs

i really feel like theres a few guys on this team that have that competitive fire and passion that were missing jk is one of those guys willie snead mandrews lj fort and gus edwards i argue are also on that list i cant stand seeing ingram and hill so frequently in the backfield i really wish our running game was 65 dobbins and 35 gus maybe next year it will be
love this team but a lot can be improved
run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run the goddamn ball
yeah like marcus peters not blowing coverage
that means we still are in the runnings for the wildcard and dont lose hope baltimore
qb lamar played well legs look great but he has to fix his mechanics he seems like hes getting a bit lazy and dropping his elbow but hes playing happy again which is biggest takeaway

rb everyone played great no complaints gus and jk a lethal duo

wr overall solid game brown is getting better as the szn progresses should of caught the tipped pass tho boykin could of had a breakout game today but some mechanical issues by lamar prohibited that want to see duvernay get more involved tho

oline solid game no complaints
would be nice to play such a garbage run defense weekly
anyway we can keep greg roman for running schemes only we still need a better oc the passing game is still weak as fuck but i wouldnt mind greg roman coming back for his running game dude is an absolute genius i wish he wouldnt abandoned the run like he did in previous game run game is arguably better this year than it even was last year
jk looked explosive
accurate summary

why does it specify first 3 seasons i feel like that softens the impact of the stat for some reason did someone else do it faster in 3 seasons that werent their first 3
some bad throws but dude played an overall good game hope he replicates week 1 on monday against the browns
thats all
jk dobbins and gus edwards vs nick chubb and kareem hunt next week the game will be won in the trenches
i really think he needs more touches against good defenses gus is fantastic as a down hill back but if that isnt rolling we tend to run a predictable gameplan with him in

dobbins is so dynamic he can be a 3 down guy
agreed
kids got burst
hes really shaping up but it has a lot to do with the front line which needs work we just played a team with an obliterated defense
imagine dobbins and edwards with yanda and stanley my god
ya he nice he should get the ball more
he good for 5 per
maybe im imagining it but when i watch kyler murray run he looks like hes a little boy running i looked at how lamar jackson ran tonight and lamar looks like a man running but kyler murray looks like a little boy running his strides are so small am i crazy and for some reason its freaking irritating
lamar runs murray scurries lol
yeah cause hes 510
well maybe because murray is 57 and lamar is 62
he runs like a toddler who stole some candy
right with ya brother when lamar runs its like a majestic horse sprinting across the field kyler murray runs like moses from the office
people have been saying that murray runs like a bad ass little kid running from an ass whooping and thats what my mind has went to ever since
lamar is more tall and lean looking whereas kyler got that kind of bulky but short look going on when in uniform
i have no idea why but murray reminds me of sonic when he runs and its adorable
hes definitely got a different kind of speed to him and he definitely squeezes into those gaps much better than lamar does lamar wishes he could squeeze in those holes between two tacklers
people have made this comparison before i always thought he looked like the road runner

but someone said he looks like a bad kid running away from his mom and i cant unsee it
kyler runs fast and is laughing all the way we love our boytoddler run all

that was a quick retirement
i say i want to quit my job 5 times a week not that big of a deal
i feel so bad for him
just delete those tweets and lets all move on like they didnt happen
lmao
dude said he quit and came back but ill still take him
thats the worst part about the internet youre not allowed to tilt and be hyperbolic for just one second

dude was pissed and probably overreacted we all do it but when you do it online suddenly its super serious
welcome back

im not sure about this guy lol


would have been 400 rushing
i miss him and yanda
is it possible for him to have a magical ray lewis recovery for playoffs
and boyle that man is a 6th lineman
here have this sad mans upvote
off to work now wish me luck boys we needed this win
its 5am here

lmaoo
lol we got monday night next week

link please
link
link my g
came in at 88 now at 89
i thought he played very well it wasnt his fault that they lost
i thought he would have had way more games played against ua

7 carries for 101 yards god damn man the bus was running on some efficient ass gas tonight
truzz bus
gus always fall forward you give it to ingram hes getting stoped at the line and pushed back
shamelessly stolen

tonight was a pretty good team win the only really weak part was the pass rush mostly everyone else played great and dalton isnt that awful of a qb
the first few weeks it was the defense that was carrying
this team needs to upgrade dobbins to star role and downgrade gus to more of a spell less timeshare would do them alot of good dobbins is by far the most dynamic back on that roster feed that

niggas gone say he cant throw 10 days after getting a virus that has killed people newton looked rough afterwards trevor lawrence too even aikman pointed out campbell struggling running towards dalton the rona aint nothing to play with even with pro athletes be afe and mask up yall

we must have watched different games tonight
doesnt look like such a bust when dude gets targeted huh everyone hating after a game when he gets 2 looks smfh

so many hatersbut dude is a play maker and needs more targets
he went 5 for 39 and a td he also tipped a pass for a pick he wasnt bad at all but by no means was he great
guys i found hollywoods reddit burner

and even if he did have a clean td grab he still had numerous loweffort plays dude needs to get in the film room find his work ethic and quit streaming getting off social media is the best thing hes done all season
did you happen to notice what happened on his first target
people are upset due to key drops and some think he is running routes lazily and not fighting for yards after catch
he had 8 targets last week and caught what 4 or 5 of them

he was 5391td such world burning stats he definitely needs to get the ball more and we pass protect poorly but hes not this amazing threat as of now
hed probably be one of the best 2 wrs in the nfl if we had a legit 1 criticisms of hollywood this season have not been unfounded
agreed i think the problem is people expecting him to be a true 1 he isnt but when we play complimentary football the run games working and we have a big body reciever to work the middle of the field he can be explosive
this is my fantasy football name too bad im in last place
he gets too much heat on this sub no doubt

we need the browns to actually lose to them
why would we want the browns to beat pittsburgh at this point
shit you guys right we need browns to lose pretend its bengals
browns needa lose starting on monday we need the steelers to pummel them
we need the steelers to beat the browns and colts lol
in a perfect world i believe we want the colts and browns to lose and as long as kc goes 151 the steelers will be playing the 7 seed and well be the 5
i know we want cleveland to lose but man just imagine how salty pittsburgh would be if they choke the division lead and browns win the afcn

bruh everyone needs to relax he was emotional but really didnt say anything that stupid he was even tweeting about a great team win


once a week tradition
tbf these penalties up across the league
lamar x jkgus are the fucking answer stop calling plays like they arent these boys absolutely eat up yards and its time to stop starving them from carrying the ball a blind man can see that this running game can take us to the promised land with this trio lets goooo
ingram needs to be 3rd rb i love him but he has no burst left jk looks 20x better
it makes me sad because i love ingram dude is a firecracker im just going by what i see
i love ingram but the fact that everyone who ran the ball tonight had a long over 30 yards besides him is pretty damning he just doesnt have it this season
pretty much zero reason for ingram to be anything higher than the 3 back
yeah ingrams washed
youre not wrong ingram is still at a respectable 41 ypc this year but the other guys are electric
we didnt have a huge lead and roman put ingram in on a 3rd and 2 he picked it up but man was that stupid

no we have to go wednesday tuesday monday than sunday
my sleeping pattern is fucked
one mans trash is another mans treasurei hate sunday 1pm games because im in church on the west coast until halftime lol
it makes me really sad when we have friends over our house for football sunday and i have no game to cheer for and im just hanging out in my jersey getting mad at my fantasy teams
100 i hate prime time games living on the east coast washed
i mean the last 2 were already scheduled to be nonsunday prime time games but yeah i like 1pm sunday kickoffs
next week will be our last prime time game right
i kind of like having to watch my football team play on a tuesday evening while ignoring my lecture lol
as a fan that lives out of market im totally fine with the weird time slots and not having to give my computer stds to stream the game online
this man came in after not playing or or practicing essentially for 2 weeks down andrews and snead threw 2 tds and ran for a huge one on 4th down

and all i see is people talking about one of his incompletions not in this sub sure he needs to work on some mechanics but really thats what people are talking about during this whole game is an incompletion i swear hes the most scrutinized qb in the league

anyways big truzzzz and great fucking win
ignore the internet nerds who dont watch football and just look at the box score or one bad throw his job primarily isnt to throw the ball idiots cant and wont fathom the concept of a qb having more of an impact on the ground than through the air

also hes still a good passer its just not his primary job did they not see that dime to hollywood
people just want to hate i still shat on bradys game every chance i got until he left ne fuck em
cant wait for the media tomorrow to talk nonstop about the cowboys and how bad they are and for them to criticize lamar and do their weekly jackson hot takes cant go a week without the media talking shit about us
someone in the steelers sub compared him to terrell pryor lmao
nothing will ever be enough for these morons hes made a lot of people look like absolute idiots even if he played absolutely perfect youve still got the racist mfers that will no doubt show up
not as bad as the hollywood brown hate coming straight from the fans of the franchise who drafted him unreal
whats worse is its because aikman thinks over analyzing form is helpful with commentary

when he mentioned lamars elbow dropping for a single incompleted pass i knew its all the haters would talk about

now everyone thinks they know the best throwing form and that lamar is subpar due to a throwing style but mahomes or any other qb does the same exact thing and thats fine
nfl is bitter about the steve saunders thing kinda fair so theyre going after lamar even harder cuz it pisses them off that a team they hate has a good player theyll say hes trash but hes undeniably talented

the hate is less about lamar personally and more about hating the ravens imo a lot of casual fans went from the pats to the steelers now that brady is gone and they suck steelers have always had a lot of fans who back them by default for some weird reason combine all that and you get the rnfl hive mind pretty toxic place that downs ravens fans immediately for absurd reasons
he needs to go back to work and fix his passing mechanics get rid of that side arm throw he takes a half second too long to throw the ball when he has an open receiver
why do people on this sub care so much about what other subs are saying lamar is having accuracy problems whether you admit it or not he played well tonight and helped us win his accuracy wasnt great on down field throws hes our guy and i hope he figures it out we need to know what we really have before we write that check
tbh lamar is not looking like a decent passer whatsoever he is really struggling with simple routes and accuracy and we should be worried he seems to only be able to hit the flats 4 yard crossing routes and ints consistently

edit to the people downvoting acceptance is a quicker path to recovery getting frustrated and denying the truth only makes you more upset
gg
go get some defense in the draft youll be just fine next year with a healthy team
i dont really care for football that much but the pandemic has done strange things that was a really fun game to watch especially that willie mays over the shoulder catch from marquis brown for that second half touchdown

i was a little bummed when they were talking about how the ravens 294 yards and they didnt have enough time to get over 300 sounded like an ingame milestone to hit

also turner missing that field goal after joe buck jinxing his gives me another reason to fucking hate joe bucks stupid guts

i dont understand the season structure or playoff eligibility in nfl much but sounded like this keeps the team in the running so lets go ravens
we may need you to watch every other game this season lol
im a ravendodger fan and when joe buck speaks it brings back playoff pain
hey im a ravens fan that became an os fan because of it i went to my first game in 2014 i go every year now
ravens legend justin turner
yeah watch out for next week when adley rutschman joins the team to back up lamar at qb

j
i think hell be a big part of us winning out the next couple of weeks hes so fast and elusive and very much like ray rice
why isnt he featured more i feel none of the rbs really get in the rhythm and tire the defense
he needs at least 15 touches a game
i want this man to be our bellcow so badly shades of ray rice even wears the same number dude is elusive runs with such fire and grit and is always jumping back up after being hit wanting the ball again

giving this man more carries is the path to success
jk all day
gus edwards too
saved my fantasy week too my faith paid off
the fact that he doesnt get 15 carries each game is a joke
fueled by veggies
he almost won my game for me but i made the mistake of starting snell over jd mckissic this week
ravens lamar jackson says he still has no sense of taste or smell postcovid19



this could be a huge advantage playing in cleveland next week against the brownstains
fuck i really dont want covid food is one of the greatest joys in life for me
also said he had other symptoms that really sucks i wonder how the rest of them are doing
cam newton talked about how wiped he felt abs that he really does take a while to get back healthy so im happy lamar looked great rushing the ball all things considered

tbf skip always on lamars side its shannon sharpe whos been coming out with hot takes for lamar jackson all season long hes super critical on lamar but protects carson wentz with his life when hes arguably the worst starting qb at the moment dude pulls all the excuses for carson and tomorrow hes still gonna have something on lamar
drip bayless
lawrence is playing great his secondary is just utter shit but yea jaylon smith is fleecing the fuck out of the cowboys
can someone explain what this means genuinely asking
i mean well take lawrence off his hands if thats what he thinks of him lol

fuck cleveland its on
the angle they showed on tv from his back of this play made me laugh

it was like hollywood threw his hand up in the endzone and then lamar like waved back

made me laugh a little

the boys looked good last night for the most part


damn he and lamar both dealin with some shit this season i think lamar has lost 3 friends this season
damn rip
he gets hate on this sub for not performing but he balled out last night despite this reminds me of torrey smith
rest in power
rip
may he rest peacefully and if there is a life after this joyously
rip
ab really gone
why did i read the title as players like a bad chinese impression
ab

who do wft fans hate the most in their division is it the cowboys
maryland stronk
it would be insane if we both made it to the superbowl and i think as long as our teams use good unique plays it would be one hell of a superbowl
the beltway brotherhood
a truly great week
it looked like we werent getting a lot of pressure in dalton tonight mainly because judon was out and ngakoue definitely wasnt getting pressure tonight i feel like we actually need judon more than we think we do
i used to shit on judon i still dont think hes worth a 20m a year contract like another team will play him but i was thinking damn if he were in i bet yannick and calais would be significantly closer to the qb every play
its not unpopular judon would have absolutely help this team no one worth their salt thinks he isnt worth 10mil plus he is a great pass rusher but he doesnt embody the ravens at a gun range during quarantine immediate dismissal he will absolutely help us win a superbowl him and yannick together are so much better than separate they both can command doubles which puts the line in a very susceptible situation
not unpopular hes not a huge contract guy but hes an above average player our pressure on dalton tonight was weak with judon we wouldve had more pressure hes not worth the money he commands but hes definitely worth a starting spot
judon is good i dont think anyone here thinks otherwise hes a starter on almost every team in the league he just isnt worth top money but again that isnt saying we dont need him
regardless of what everyone says now youre right it is an unpopular opinion people shit on him because they dont understand what we ask him to do and just expect to see prime tsuggs every snap

judon and bowser both allow us to blitz from every position on the field because they are able to drop into coverage and hold up they both and ngakoue blitz and stunt really well with guys like campbell and wolfe up front

the problem is what is that worth what do we want to give up to keep that everyone is focused on signing or not signing judon but if we lose both him and bowser our defense does not look this good next year and its a very real possibility we have to let them both walk with very little to draft with
judon isnt awful but hes def not worth the money hes asking for he consistently sucked the first half of the season and cost us a ton of yards hes improved since then but his inconsistency is a bit concerning

not a terrible player but not a star either
unpopular opinion we need judon in order to make ngakoue look good another unpopular opinion id rather sign judon over ngakoue

my goodness in the exact order too
i think waterhydration might help the covid recovery instead of the wine i know he was crushed though sucks for dez hopefully hes ok today and will still ride with us
man i feel for dez man this shit sucks this whole season has been a mess if the nba and nhl showed us anything its that sports gotta be in bubbles to contain the damn virus or players gotta start wearing masks while they play

i have to give it dez he really took a tough one right to the heart

first hes got to be ecstatic hes playing again after a terrible injury then he gets to play against his old team he gets to see all the familiar faces in pregame hes about to compete against them

then a few minutes prior to kickoff they come tell him he tested positive he is not going to be able to play the game hes got a virus that can be very scary hes hugged all these friends and potentially exposed them and their families he wont play next week

thats one hell of a rollercoaster to ride
seeing dez out there is the one thing i really looked forward to seeing in this match up the game was as expected easy dez wouldve made it more interesting
after the dominating win i was thinking of how good jk looked tonight then i looked at the stats for him and really thought he would have had even better numbers than he did 11 rushes for 71 yards 30 of 71 on 1 long run and 1 td


im proud of all the guys but i just thought it was odd that he didnt have the statistical scores that i thought he had just wondering if this happened to anyone else too glad we got this win
if you get seven yards every time you run the ball you will win the game
him and gus bus are the future

hes coming back next game hopefully
i laughed way harder than i expected d

with the lil x my goodness well done op
that is all

thanks troy

now go back to louisville and last years mvp tape and watch lamas perfect throwing motions

lol take dip out of mahhomes fluties flakes breakfast cereal that russle cooked it doesnt matter how he throws it it matters that it gets there

lj needs to go back to throwing how he is comfortable throwing not be coached to be like a prototipical nfl qb
people are just repeating what they heard the commentators said last night at this point lmaooo his main problem is his footwork not his release he misses passes when he throws using mainly his upper body and not allowing his legs to give him a proper base
so many experts on passing mechanics this week dalton missed throws last night as well but you dont see the frame by frame breakdown we need to win games if we have the lamar we had last night for the rest of the year we can do damage who cares if he misses a few throws
hes been out for a week hes probably a lil rusty and he only practiced once

tbf weve been doing this with butker even weeks after their game against us ik theres more of a friendly rivalry between us and kc but still
upvote parties in general are stupid
the second most upvoted comment sums it up

people on this sub are making fun of the ravens sub for having an upvote party because we lost

meanwhile our sub is having an upvote party because their kicker missed a field goal really
dude this sub does the exact same thing
i have three words
the best part is the post right before that where they complain about us having upvote party for their loss to wft lol
we had probably a 100 posts about their loss to the football team within 10 minutes of the game

both our fan bases have been super petty
torille


people say lamar sucks at passing

here are how our wrte rank

marquise brown 555 yards 46th
mark andrews 454 yards 72th
willie snead iv 379 yards 91st

we need a better wrte badly

also guess who our best rb is

lamar jackson 669 yards rank 14
we dont need a new te we need a new oc that can scheme wr open cause gregs passing plays are way too predictable
72th

seventy twoth
these sort of posts always baffle me you saw boykin catch passes last night people are ready to write the dude off but he cant catch passes that arent thrown to him our wrs stats are near the bottom of the league but that isnt because they arent good wrs
yeah its been a rough year offensively
when was brady bitching about his wrs
ravens front office couldnt draft a good receiver what were they thinking by taking a small wr with a first rounder
receivers cant get yards if they arent passed too not sure why season yard totals are your barometer for skill
mark andrews is a top 5 te in the league put some respect on his name

but yeah our wrs suck
i know they were being sold here at one point and i hopped on the offer too soon been kicking myself in the head for it ever since anyone know where to purchase one
ive been dying to find one too i cant seem to find anything on the web
after a bit of searching you could apparently get them if you signed a local youth football team in the team on the rise campaign


not sure what area youre in theres a ravens pop up shop baltimore in canton thats where i bought mine today

well i mean it is finetheyve won 45
i seriously doubt theyre that worried sitting at 111
im sure we dont want to look at the passing yards comparison though
i may get downvotes but if you talk to steeler fans they most of them know they cant run the ball this year very well they dont like conner rn either
steelers fans but its the cowboys
he was taking off when the lane was there earlier in the year we saw him hesitate to do so which typically let to an incompletion

him rushing a lot benefits our running and passing game it opens up opportunitys for other guys to get open and opens up running lanes for our backs

lamar should be running the ball 1015 times a game its that crucial to our offense thats what hes done for his first 3 years in baltimore thats what made him so special his rookie year when his passing wasnt up to par
i cannot agree with you more lamar is always so hesitant an example of this would be in the patriots game where he had an open rushing lane but hesitated and threw an incompletion to willie snead
i agree he has to do what sets him apart
im all for lamar improving his passing game by getting more ingame reps but when its time to make a play he needs to be willing to run
i was so happy to see this man a lot of mobile dualthreat qbs end up running all the time so im thrilled that lamar wants to pass first second and third but it was so frustrating how many times hed have a wideopen first down if he tucked and ran but instead hed stop reset to throw and force a ball to a covered receiver instead of taking the free first

quarterbacks are supposed to pass but when youve got his kind of speed and the defense gives you that play for free you take it it feels like a small thing but seeing him calm down and take the freebie with his legs instead of trying to force a throw was so good to see last night
this was my biggest takeaway he took more chances in the ground against a bad run defence

my issue is if any team can stop our run or lamars running lanes we are doomed we cant pass the ball its simple i do not trust our passing game at all make this team 1 dimensional and we fall apart
i was relieved he was able to run so well last night was worried he would have some postcovid shortness of breath but if anything he seems more like his old self maybe he had some soft tissue injuries making him hesitate a little and the time off helped
this is true but there were a lot of lanes lol
i saw a stat that said were 161 when lamar rushes for 70 or more yards even yesterday on the 3rd and 2 or whatever where he ran to the right and reachdd the ball over the marker he had a moment where he could have run for probably 1520 yards but he looked like he was waiting too long for the routes to develop i know he wants to be a passing qb and i think he will improve at that but the man is so gifted at running he cant deny that
sleeper takeaway lamar is essentially our lead back and the biggest hit to our offense has been his lack of consistent big runs his ypc is way down when you have a player like dobbins on the field you cant focus solely on lamar dobbins is too explosive and he helps open lanes for lamar and vice versa
hesitating gets you killled
considering that lamars passes were in front behind too high or too low pretty much all night running is for sure a better option
he played the cowboys dont get too excited
wasnt able to catch the game yesterday and i feel like you can only get so much from looking at highlights and stat sheets from what i can gather we ran the ball exceptionally well getting several players involved and our defense was a little inconsistent but played well overall

does anyone here care to give their take on the game specifically who they think played well or not as well
i know it was just the cowboys but lamar looked like he had his confidence back our defense looked slow and sluggish considering most of them just got over corona its understandable play calling was a bit predictable but if its putting points up in not gonna complain
you take is pretty much on the money

ravens offense was able to exploit the cowboys weakness on defense by running the ball passing was ok given that snead and andrews were out but lamar was able to find brown and boykin for tds

some people will say the ravens defense was not great but given that jimmy smith tramon williams and judon were out campbell and brandon williams are just coming back and probably not 100 i think this was more of a conservative bend dont break plan

special teams was not the best with tucker missing a 30ish yard fg and there was a long kickoff return it was an off night for the unit

going forward lamar should try to run for positive yards if nothing is there for passing plays the offense needs to run it alot and mix in play action like rg3 2012
peters needs to not take plays off as he wasted a potential goal line stand toward the end of the game it was inconsequential as the cowboys still needed 2 more scores with 3 minutes left but still
ive never seen a team get so many illegal formation calls

i mean its fucking wild ive been watching playing coaching for 30 years in two different countries we are guaranteed at least one a game

this is a once every couple season penalty its a penalty from not know what your doing it because you didnt know where you were supposed to line up at the nfl level it just blows my fucking brain

other then that we played better lj looked more focused and was hitting the holes fast hes been running with hesitation all year but yesterday seemed to say fuck it let do it live

ingram needs consistent carries to be effective he needs 10 touches or hes really slow off the line trying to get a feel for the d watch his screen play in the first quarter he catches it turns and looks where to go instead of running and scanning thats a 15 yrd gain if he takes off by the end of the game he was running smoother and with more vision after roman kept feeding him

that in mind obviously jk needs to be the feature back

im not a hollywood fan this year but this was a good baby steps game mcsorleys td pass last week made the cowboys have to at least think about his speed a bit his improv touchdown last night was a great play and shows the situations that he can be dangerous in he is not a slot wr hes not a steve smith an ab or a bolden hes a much better version of torrey smith he needs another legit wr opposite to allow him 11 with no safety overtop hes just not like thick enough to compete with bump and rush or double teams maybe he can beef up even more this offseason to a djax body either way lets hope he can build on this

boykin caught a fucking ball so thats nice

cowboys lick a dick at everything but wr
edwards is a beast when he gets past the line of scrimmage
lamar looked like he was having real fun in the 4th
fort picked that pass in the end zone
couple missed plays by the officiating crew on both sides nothing new
joe buck can lick my nuts
the ravens first touchdown if you can find it really stood out for me

the ravens faced a 4th and 2 situation and lamar told special teams to stay off the field and that they were going for it it seems like he completely improvised from whatever scheme and handled the play himself

to see him take back control of the offense like that was great later in the game when it was still close you can see situations in which he made the right choice and decided not to go for it it seems the wheels are turning with him more and obviously a win you highlight the good but it seems some swagger is coming back

maybe it was first game back post covid or something else but we need more of this lamar
lamar threw some ducks understandable given the weird offseason and lack of practice but it looked to me like he was throwing from a narrow base and did some more needless sidearm throws
defense sucked but opportunistic passing game was not good lamar had some good throws but many were pretty horrid he bailed us out with his legs a lot
we beat a team we were supposed to beat thats it
offense is still stagnant and cant throw the ball against a baddddd defense hollywood continues to underwhelm
forced alot of crappy 1 to 2 yards throws to start dominated a terrible defense rushing and let lamar play to his strength as a scrambling quarterback need more of that from lamar and less of this wanna be pocket qb shit

hollywood had a nice route and lamar dimed him on that throw one of his best throws ever imo we need to stick to game managing and controlling clock again instead of trying to hit homeruns like we were doing early in the year
blitzing a qb that gets the ball off immediately doesnt work theyll get the pass off every time and it leaves their receivers wide open thats what happens with the steelers cover the receivers instead of attacking ben we disarm their offense
hey all feels good to get a w after taking three ls in a row lets talk about our 3417 victory cant wait to discuss let me know if i missed anything lets go ravens as always forgive typos

offense

1 qb play was okay but the lack of practice time was evident as well lamars mechanics just arent great this year and its something he has to get fixed lamar doesnt position his shoulder when he throws and often throws off his unplanted foot now part of this is hes often throwing on the move behind our line but he is struggling to make passes he should be able to make the example being the third down pass after the half not a fan of the play calling sequence here but boykin was open and we need to make that play to beat good teams however his td pass to hollywood showcases that his has the talent lamars legs are his greatest weapon which isnt a knock on his passing but a fact that we should exploit as much and when logically possible

2 wr play was actually up yesterday imo hollywood played well barring the pick at the beginning which was both a high ball and a lack of jump on his part boykin showed up probably getting my hopes up but maybe hell get it together going forward

3 te play was as good as we can ask at this point wilson is trying i think hell be an okay compliment to andrews when he returns wilson was fairly effective at blocking the outside runs hes quick in space

4 rbs kicked ass simple as that dobbins is our number 1 someone page gro edwards is 1b and ingram really needs to be moral supportoccasional relief back now the dallas defense is truly horrific but heres the thing the oline wasnt always getting good blocks but our runners including lamar consistently made something happen

5 oline play was what weve done to expect they did alright in the run game but struggled in pass blocking while dallas didnt record a sack that was more them sucking than our line we have to overcome the injuries and do the best we can going forward

6 overall the offense did what it had to ran the ball and torched the cowboys on the ground lamar made some good plays and made some worrisome plays overall i feel like they performed okay but they didnt show me anything to make me feel good about playing a team like the chiefs

defense

7 dline the cowboys managed 111 yards on the ground last night so in terms of yards we didnt do great but we were consistently getting tackles for a loss a very average performance for this group some slack needs to be given considering it was campbell and williams first game back

8 the lbs much like the dline played okay but not great trickery continues to fool us i will say this when they come up to make a play they lay down some thumping hits same for the safeties that kind of nastiness is very ravens

9 the pass rush only got home 1 time the entire game unacceptable dalton had all game judon missing was felt and yannick needs to step it up because his grace period is over the fact that mcphee got the sack over him is alarming fergusonbowser are slowly becoming our most consistent rushers bowser has really come on in coverage as well

10 im just going to group the secondary as one item to keep the post from getting super long they played poorly watching the dallas receivers run around wide open all game was sickening they play off constantly which usually i wouldnt care about but theyre getting destroyed with it this year the gamble of giving the receiver space to try and make a turnover happen hasnt payed off in a long time make no mistake we have great players in our secondary but this unit didnt play well in this game

special teams

11 tucker is tucker that miss was just one of those random things koch did well with his punts

12 the cowboys had a long return that set them up to get points but otherwise i think they were fine one bad play doesnt define the unit

coaching

13 harbs not challenging the pick irked me i can only think he was waiting for confirmation from the booth but throw the damn flag man

14 gro called an okay game i wasnt a fan of consistent passing plays in some situations but i understand we cant run the ball every play i do wish we called passing plays that played better to lamars strengths

15 i love that we blitz aggressively but im tried of sending all that pressure without getting the sack its very frustrating i know pressure has its own effect but damn man no one can get home

other notes

16 we sorely need to practice tackling in the coming week we arent taking chubbhunt down with these arm tackles this has been slipping bad in the last few weeks im hoping because practices have been few and far between

17 up and down is the story of both sides of the ball we have weeks where the o looks great and then dont do a thing the next week same for the defense its so frustrating because if they can just be on the same page this team would be an absolute force

18 this weeks game might as well be a playoff game we have to beat cleveland the mistakes we made in this game cant be repeated we are more than capable but we need all hands on deck and some heat next week

fuck the browns and of course fuck the steelers

biggest point for me is what you said about passing in some situations i think the biggest problem right now is we arent passing on early downs nearly enough against teams that can stop the run at some level we are getting in a lot of third and throw positions and we dont have the pass offense to handle it more play action on early downs will open up receivers the way it did for boykins touchdown more often and itll stop teams from playing so downhill on the run

i want to think that we solved the oline problems and we will be back to last years running attack but i cant until i see it against someone who isnt that bad against the run and if we havent found a way to get back to that we will need to adjust in some way more early down passing is for me the correct way
lamar needs to get his mechanics together but thats nearly impossible during the season

brown is too soft for me he doesnt fight for the ball and can burn it when he gets it but damn man very one dimensional

the rbs and offensive line were money glad to see dobbins getting the most carries not sure if were that good at running again or them being so bad was the reason i tend to think a good combo of both

the linebackers did a really nice job queen and fort were playing well and reacting fast bowser was on coverage a lot and mcphee did a nice job of setting the edge when in there
i agree with a lot of what you said

boykin had a great play and i loved that he fought his way into the end zone but i just do not see him as a consistent playmaker yet he has the potential to get there but i think the gro offense hinders him
hollywood stepped up a bit this game and his move to get open in the end zone for his touchdown is exactly what we need from a guy who wants to be the star wr for the team to me it still looks like he doesnt try for some balls thrown to him from what ive seen this season the pick early on was a throw that was a bit too high for hollywood
jk is the real deal
lamar played well for being on the covid list i was worried he would be gassed like newton seemed to be after his time with covid but lamar looked good with little to no practice before the game
i think no having judon showed that he is a big part of the pass rush for us he draws people for others to get through the line and that was proven tonight when their line just bullied our rushers
yannick is disappointing so far plain and simple
the secondary looks tired especially peters watching some of his plays made me feel like i needed to take a breather because he would just look like he gave up half way through it also might not help that he looks to be limping after every play
marlon looks like covid took a bit from him he just seems to be losing a step here and there
as for not challenging the pick late in the game i think that was just a combination of waiting for someone to tell him to throw it and how fast the cowboys got to the line to get a play off quickly because they knew it could be challenged i agree that for the future harbaugh should just go with his gut and maybe thats what he did in that situation
finally i hope this win gives the team a motivation boost after losing to the patriots and titans in just bad ways and to have injuries and covid on top of it all getting guys back healthy and getting a win will hopefully give this team a spark to win
i might withhold judgement on yannick until he gets some snaps with campbell the two of them had amazing stunt chemistry in jax and hopefully can replicate some of that success here
i agree with everything you said


please give this a quick 10 minute listen also so happy we won felt like forever
we need to talk about our beloved juice man mp has been playing scared ball for weeks now and i cant figure out why its almost been since he got burned by tyreek and kc so hard early on

last night was the absolute worst so far though consistently playing 12 yards off the line even on 3rd and 7 or 3rd and 8 he opens himself up to easy completions on hook routes and bites hard on the stutter step thinking its a go

anyone know whats going on with him
im wondering if hes giving the space since we cant get pressure without blitzing a safety he isnt getting cover off the top due to averett needing so much help

if we get our starters back including jimmy and calasis at full health i bet mp gets more aggressive we also had a lead for a lot of last night no need to be in the line when you have the option to play off a bit without risking the game
hes not the one who makes the call as to where he plays on the line if you look marlon and mp have both been playing far off the line for a few weeks now thats a dc change im not really understanding at the moment but its for a reason i personally think that change is effecting marlon and mp because they cant play the hip of the wr and react quicker any outbreaking route is essentially a completion because they arent close enough

edit with the injuries and covid that might be the main reason as to why they are playing 5 yards off everytime idk why i keep forgetting that its been such a bang up season
hes playing through a couple of injuries that have slowed him down playing off of the receiver is a way to compensate
weve obviously seen peters play a lot better than this but the real problem right now is averett on the field i want to like the guy but hes nothing but a joke out there if averett is on the field thats where the other team is throwing we really need jimmy healthy for monday
probably by design im sure our coaches arent just letting him free ball it week in and week out
i still love me some mp juiceman i see a pick 6 very soon

honestly got me starting to wonder if we need to draft a corner next year i love peters game but part of me feels like the defense would improve with a decent man cover guy who tackles well
hes never been a good cover corner he excels at making plays on the ball when hes lined up against the 3 wr missing jimmy and tavon really nullifies mps ability
peters does a lot of talk yet he is the biggest pussy in the field excuse my language
dude mp cannot tackle he just avoids it its insane
hi guys

life long alcoholic browns fan here i saw dez tested positive last night before kickoff and was extremely worried about your players health you guys have been snake bitten this season and the fact the team is over 500 is a testament to the organizations resiliency just wanted to say regardless of rivalries and stealing our fucking team past disagreements we are all in this fight against covid together good luck to you guys this week and i hope your players can stay healthy

fuck art mo much love

a concerned browns fan
lol this is the first one of these friend checking in from a rival sub that made me chuckle
why would anyone hate on art monk hes a very nice guy
i appreciate the fine combination of shit talking with being a human and i also appreciate that this is from a fan of another team that isnt the fucking steelers a umm more frequent visitor

salut and know that we will still remember you affectionately when the browns go back to completely sucking next year i am pleased for you that you are finally having something to cherish even if that means next seasons pain will be all the more agonizing
ty v kind hope ur players are healthy


fuck the steelers
looking forward to monday night fuck the steelers
nicely done hope its one for the ages either way

edit what a game it did not disappoint

such a odd career bounces around never really able to get his feet steady gets his ankles broken by lamar in training camp and a few months later hes his teammate and hes playing excellent
he has been a pleasant suprise the whole time hes been here especially since this was my reaction to his signing last year
lj fort has been an absolute beast and i dont understand how he was a journeyman
fort protects the house
dude is one of a few guys thats shows 100 every snap
ngl this dude balls out
i honestly think if he plays in the patriots game we win
he picked it
nice int last night
fort caught it
real recognize real good to see thus sub appreciate this man no lie last year when we signed him initially i was convinced he was not going to do shit but him and bynes came in solidified the d in an unprecedented manner he gets signed and continues to be as good if not better good in coverage good in the run game and good on special teams just the exact definition of a guy who should have not been a journeyman
bro facts all he knows how to do is make plays on the ball
im optimistic about pat queen but this dude is way more reliable in the run game rn
i dont know how they didnt give him that int seemed more clear than the one marcus peters against indy
love lj fort but he looks like the default character in madden lmao
u cant thwart the fort


also our team with bwill and campbell back is night and day man offense is still a work in progress but we got some legit hope again
watching him in college and seeing him getting signed by rival teams hurt like im happy youre making it in the nfl but im not cheering for you to now proudly having a signed jersey hanging in the mancave of finally having a fellow alum playing for your nfl team makes a guy happy


also he had that pick in the endzone last night
it was a catch
he has been such a good addition that when he missed a few games i was actually fearful that we couldnt win without him he adds stability to the second level of the defense which is exactly what we need when our other lbs are two rookies and an undrafted fa in his third year
throw it in a dime lj you are fine
mans came from out of no where bro i am really happy his breakout season to becoming an elite lb was on a team that very needed ilb help
boulware
covid results in the next couple of days with dez super strange situation last night and really hope it is a false positive hope that some miracle if dez does have it no players or coaches get it also make sure marcus peters doesnt get burnt cause he is toast
same i dont like how mink  a tweet of him with people
id put money on dez not being positive something weirds going on
i hate to make this joke but dez caught it
if he tested positive why was he sitting on the benchsideline during the game shouldnt the protocol be go home dude get tf away from other players and team staff
this obviously is contingent on beating cleveland but what results from these games benefits baltimore the most

colts at raiders

chiefs at dolphins

steelers at bills
steelers game doesnt really matter other than obvious fts reasons

root for the chiefs big time

colts and raiders is a ww or ll outcome honestly we have the tie break over the colts so it would be nice for tenn to win the division and us to have the same record over indy but we also need to get in the playoff picture and the raiders have a better conference wl than us that said i think the raiders arent a good football team and if they lose this game they wont recover the jets pulling the tank of the century move really screwed us over

overall correct me if im wrong here i think we really just have to root for the dolphins to fall back down to earth and hope the raiders just suck and we can win out
this is refreshing the only one that reallllly matters to us is the chiefs winning nice to be on that side of it
coltsraiders is a wash as long as the titans stay ahead of the colts since we have that tie breaker chiefs need to win rams need to beat the patriots so they stay behind us and bills to win just to expose the shitty steelers even more lol that game holds no bearing on us really since theyre both division leaders

but none of that matters if we dont beat the browns so thats the biggest thing
i think either the colts or raiders losing is a huge plus for us it doesnt matter which but ill say a tie would be a bad outcome chiefs winning obviously benefits us
i would prefer nobody gets covid thats all i care about
colt chiefs and the other doesnt matter since theyll both win their division

raiders and dolphins are the competition for the wildcard so we need them to lose i think browns and colts will be 5 and 6 seeds so 7 comes down to us raiders and dolphins
we take care of our business and steelers lose would be great

so you bought a football card
how much did it cost
you made the right choice
plug it into the gpu and get way better speeds
what are your pc specs
agreed smart decision
bless you
damn sorry dude
damn thats sick
ive decided my 1070 ftw will play amazing and not let the graphics bother me when i play through it again next time i will have gotten the rare 3080 best wishes and always fuck the steelers
has anyone seen hollywoods top speed from that 70yrd catch or lamar from last night

howwhere do we find that
next gen stats shows speed the free version shows top 20 or so from each week and for the season lamar has been on it several times over 21 mph

brown has been on ot once at like 203 in week 3 or something

maybe the paid version will show more of their speed regardless not much from hollywood even duvernay has been on it a couple times
on the 70 yard td the ravens tweeted that hollywood got up to 19 i think not really what i was expecting from a speedster with that much open space
id like to see it but i bet lamars touchdown run wasnt a mind boggling speed just because once he cleared the line he could basically quick jog in
open space

this is like being a blackhawks fan in the nhl but make the last frame too many men on the ice
my dad and i have a drinking game have to guess which quarter we get our first illegal formation


2nd quarter vs cowboys 4th quarter vs steelers if anyone has catching up to do
just looked it up 8 times this year 6 different games phi 3 pit ind ne pit dal
holding 5 yard penalty automatic first downso many opponents drives saved by someone apparently holding
or false start
oooooof
thank you this got me
hahaha

good read

i even have it on lp time to listen to it on repeat

billy cundiff i guess we all know whether his leg ever came around
aaron wilson was a great reporter i hope hes doing well down in houston
happy to bring the steelers back down to earth and preciate you reminding everyone the cowboys are trash but could realllllly use you all discount double checking the giants

wft
we hope to win that game but we could have used some help with cleveland back in week three tho
were on to cleveland
hello fellow dmver i love dc

its always gonna be project pat
hes project pat
the wall
why
project pat thats his nicknam
project pat forever
i mean paddy wagon was a derogatory term about how often the police would look to discriminate against the irish so maybe not
a month ago i adopted a cat named maurice he has since been nicknamed mo by my family since he seems to like the shorter sound mo loves watching football mos favorite player by far is lamar he likes watching how he runs and makes his jukes i think he thinks lamar is a spider unfortunately a few weeks ago mo started acting lethargic and wasnt feeling good he couldnt even jump up on my bed he was so sluggish in that time the ravens lost three games straight we brought him to a few emergency vets and they did a multitude of tests and couldnt find anything conclusively wrong with him we were worried that the worst was going to happen miraculously though sunday night he started to peek up a little and by monday night he was back to his old self last night i got to watch the ravens and our favorite player lamar kick the cowboys teeth in i think that my cat has a spiritual connection to lamar and his recovery correlates to him coming off the covid list heres mo feeling much better
glad hes feeling better we gonna need mo watching lamar the rest of the season im not superstitious but i am a little stitious
lamo catson
the greatest cat of all time
awww your mo looks a lot like our pirate kitty charlotte hope mo continues to feel better
can mo play wide out
what a sweet baby fyi activated charcoal capsules are a literal lifesaver to have on hand if you ever suspect any of your animals ate something they shouldnt they give it in the er to people who overdose bc it adsorbs all the toxins and removes them from the digestive system works for kitties toojust be sure to get the kind made from coconut shells the other kind is not safe to ingest
im sorry but im a bigger fan than your cat
hope mo continues to feel better
mo will bring us these wins
awwww
haha its funny now that i think of it when ever i watch the game with my cat on my lap we seem to do better

this makes me happy sometimes as fans we get really negative but this is a nice reminder that lamar is an amazing guy and we are really lucky to have him
yes this run is legendary but it is nothing like

bruh you just split two people in ot for a walkoff

just two humble goats spitting at each other
the very first play they watch the tackle tells lamar to throw the ball holy shit they were in the zone that year
dope
that was something i didnt know i needed thanks for posting

its funny that lamar revived vicks career but lets be real lamar is 10x the player vick ever was
man hes so humble when lamar corrected vick saying like us man i got the chills so wholesome
i still hate vick for the dog fighting thing but i like watching lamar being his usual likable self
why is dez so pissed im confused



usa today dez bryant goes on tweetstorm after positive covid test


frustration guys still only 32 and could get a decent payday if he showed a glimpse of his former self he does everything hes supposed to do and still has to come out of a game he could have been targeted also happens to be his former team

im confused as to why youre confused
to be fair id be pissed if i had been getting ready to play a game i was excited for and then all of a sudden i was taken out because of a positive covid test
because he was literally an hour away from starting against his former team warming up getting into his zone cheesing for the cameras and they went actually no


hes pissed at the circumstances dude doesnt mean anything but just that
i agree that he is just frustrated he signed with the saints a few years ago and got hurt at practice and never played fought his way back did the practice squad thing finally got some grabs the last game he played and he probably thought this was his im back moment

to get pulled off the field during pregame warmups would be super frustrating
i think it was just frustration in the moment
hes an emotional player thats his game
well hes crazy so
x200b



so i have a little fun breakdown of a key play the ravens should be using from here on out they used it twice last night against the cowboys and both were big hitters the play was out of spread and they ran a bash concept the two big plays were 4th and 2 first quarter with 33 seconds left lamar jackson ran for a 37 yard touchdown the second big play was 1st and 10 with 153 left in the quarter lamar this time hands off to jk dobbins for a 27yard run the main read on the bash concept is the opposite of the regular read option where the running back is the threat to the outside and the quarterback is the threat to the inside the pulling guard and tackle i absolutely think they need to keep using this play from here on out because it allows dobbins to get aggressive coming around the perimeter and also allows lamar to gash defenses running inside
inverted veerpower read one of the most dangerous plays but if defense is in gaps its worthless its good when you know defenses are out of position consistently
heres a great video that features both plays youre talking about
honestly this is what ive thought we needed to do since boyle went out spread the defense out with 4 wide and then with the field spread run the option
this is not a new concept to our team its only effective when defenses fuck up
1 sack and barely any pressures on one of the worst olines in the league andy dalton was sitting in the pocket for 5 seconds on multiple occasions

doesnt fare well for us against a pff graded 1 oline in the cleveland browns yannick has been spotty with his play and hasnt earned an extension in my eyes judon was nonexistent as usual they have a tall order on monday night so they better come ready to play or it could be season over

edit forgot judon was inactive for this game although his impact on the game remained constant
are you telling a joke about judon or are you serious
this team has literally always had issues sacking dalton he throws quick against blitzes and knows our defence well i cant think of a qb this team has struggled to sack more than dalton the last 10 years ravens had 31 sacks vs dalton all time for comparison the browns all time have 36
youre aware judon is still on covid reserve and didnt play last night right
calais played really poorly and judon was out

the covid losses will take a few weeks to recover from even with all the starters back many players across the league have played poorly after catching covid

we really wont be able to judge the current state of our pass rush until the very end of the regular season
1 sack and that was ward

step 1 play ward more in passing situations i actually think our best rush duo may be wardyannick

step 2 get back judon

step 3 collapse the middle of the pocket the edge rushers got there several times but dalton is a veteran and just stepped up in the pocket they need more out of williams wolfe and ellis in the middle this needs to be addressed this offseason too
calais was coming off having covid personally think he had a bad game but he has preexisting conditions and is likely having a harder time recovering just my thoughts though
a healthy campbell will help dramatically
judon while his sack numbers arent there is actually one of our best at disrupting plays and pressuring the qb his being out of the game definitely played a part in our lack of pass rush
dont resign judon please

i actually think our pass rush is going to be fine if we can have calais and bwill back for a full week of practice covid kind of fucked us up a lot


lowkey kinda like it carbon fibre vibes but i love grey cause im super plain and simple boring
they look sick would be had to justify with our color scheme though its like when the 49ers wear black uniforms
looks kinda like the probowl jersey


looks like the lions
purple numbers and a purple stripe on the leg and theyre perfect
nfl a has the worst uniform options give some teams freedom to do anything fun its 16 games and were only given one helmet and one alternate if the team wants to do more let them bottom tier teams like jacksonville nyj wft should at least be able to capitalize on apparel would love to see all greys even all black with only white outlines would be sick we have the best uniforms we should also have the best alternates i get the safety for helmets in only having on set but man we could have some awesome uniforms
like it could be a nice counterpoint to the color rush colorless rush
this is what colorblind people were seeing on that red green nightmare a few years back lol
looks ok in photos but grey unis look like shit playing on field
purple cleatsglovesmouthpiece and thats a win

i like them
needs some purple highlights otherwise it just looks like a printer issue
all in favor to use this verses the purple jersey white pants option
love
purple and yellower gold on the pants stripe same for numbers also need purple sleeve line on the sleeves all other ravens jerseys have and itd be perfect good look though
throw some purple camo on them pants and you nailed it

seriously though im not a fan of the grey but i love the creativity wish we saw more mockups here from you talented folks

steelers losing bengals losing titans losing i hate all of these teams and im sure you do too doesnt help us playoff wise lol

i felt this i hope they fly into an active volcano
titans winning helps us playoff wise because they need to take the division i think you should expand to show that

this was my lock screen last year and my fiance insinuated that i was a homosexual for having it kept it tho
this has been my lockscreen photo all season
anyone have a link to save the image

jk is 2nd in the league behind chubb with 54 yardscarry 4th overall lamar kyler are ahead i feel like a homer saying this but the way hes been running i really think hes a top 10 rb across the league talentwise

somewhere behind chubb kamara henry cook mccaffrey barkley those guys are all really special anyone else id argue that he looks as good or better given the opportunities
ingrams a great dude but theres really no reason for him to be getting carries over dobbins and edwards at this point
without lamarjk and gus this offense would be the bears offense with a slighty better run game
i think hes just pleasing them atm i think this off season one of them will go and i dont see it being dobbins


view poll
what does this have to do with the ravens
between
ima say lawrence but thats only because i dont trust ohio state qbs
who would be the better oc

i honestly think marty would be a lot better for the ravens than greg tbh

im talking the 2018 lamar marty not 2016 flacco marty
no no no no no no no marty was one of the worst ocs ive ever seen in my life im not a roman fan but at least he can help scheme a great run game marty could do nothing and that 2018 year greg roman was our run game coordinator and probably had a huge hand in the on the fly offense we built around lamar
lmao this fan base got so much stupider over the past 23 years
youre an idiot
holy fucking christ im usually pretty chill on here but thats just plain dumb
how about none of the above
you should probably stop licking dogs
so were asking if a shiny turd is better than a normal one i say roman he sucks but he took our offense to record setting last year

it wouldnt be automatic first down

itd be repeat first down

kick him off the tour doug
steelers are being exposed really want a rematch in the playoffs cant wait to see jujus new tiktok hell yeah
i vote old bay
dont worry i have a preview of his newest tiktok



hollywood can be a diggs type player i just dont see the effort from him
i am e r e c t

he spelled super bowl wrong
hate how we didnt even atleast try to peruse diggs if decosta is watching the game right now he better be taking notes on what to do the next time a big time receiver is on the market digg is legit a safety blanket and is destroying the steelers single handily its not like josh allen is throwing bombs to diggs its just short passes like lamar is doing but they got someone who can catch and get yac
not being targeted either im facing him and not in trouble anymore
hello darkness my old friend
ragedlikemilk
theyre dating now
aged like milk
i couldnt slam the upvote fast enough

hes so fucking annoying

bills are running clock and he says now thats like the old school steelers get a lead and run the ball
there are three certainties in life death taxes and chris collinsworth fellating the steelers on national television
he has actually toned it down two or three years ago he would constantly bring up steelers analogies even when the steelers werent playing wow what a great play by drew brees reminds me of the play that roethlisberger and the steelers made earlier against the colts speaking of the steelersthey really looked good today
who cares what that closet pedo thinkssays

i dont even want to know where this is from
name of girl in bottom
need source my school teachers always said to provide sources for your images in assignments therefore i need the source for school of course
can i get a link
im also sick of hearing about bens and quick release 89 million times i watched the game on mute
boner
half the time my volume is off
what are the steeler stans blaming this game on having to play an nfl schedule in 2020 maybe all red unis are illegal
they had 2 linemen hurt dude how do you expect them to win with 2 starters out
bud dupree and devin bush is probably gonna be the main excuse
checked out their sub last night seemed like they mostly blamed their oc and tomlin

the ravens exposed some things
youre not special
they play the colts and the browns not unlikely they go 133
this game just angers me we should be 20 against these frauds this season
and we arent so

my favourite anacdote about the steelers this year came from osi umenyiora


im shaking rn my 1 year old son just said his first words he said is it true the steelers were 110 because of a cupcake schedule i said yes son and they will get get owned in the first round of the playoffs it was one of the realest moments of my life
suck ass team overrated as fuck and it shows now that theyre playing a good healthy team fuck juju and his stupid tiktok bullshit cant stand any of them absolutely deserved loss
fuck ebron and the tik tok bitches
overrated fraudss
we shouldve beaten them fucking covid
fuck the steelers im glad to see buffalo beat those clowns
browns fans already jerking each other off that theyre about to run the table and win the division would sure hate to rain on their parade tomorrow
the most overrated undefeated team of all time we can miss the playoffs and im still chillin over here watching the steelers get stomped on week after week lol
no juju dance on tiktok tonight
pad the stats should be an easy one
frauds
they are who we thought they were
i hate watched a steelers game for the first time tonight

yall owe me
beautiful
that third quarter was a hell of a thing diggs obviously deserves credit for being a golden god of a receiver but holy shit how do you leave him that open for play after play
would be nice to end the season at 115 and them at 124 or 133 completely different mental landscape entering the post season
most overrated offense i have ever seen its basically the cardboard box in the dumpster behind goodwill version saints offense
heck yes
big ben realizing the team is overrated


fuck the steelers exposed for what they are
yall should be ashamed making fun of a team that is clearly still recovering from their brutal 3 games in two weeks that teams go through every year
f
i argued with a steelers fan about their fraudulent record all he could say was we best you twice yeah and they know we werent healthy both times now
hahahahaha get fucked pissburgh
perfect end to 2020 the winners of the afc north is the cleveland browns as my 89 year old mother says the world is upside down this year
one of these games chris collinsworth is literally going to walk down to the field and give ben and juju a fullon blowjob on the 50 yard line
these are my favorite type of parties
like the frauds we knew them to be
the steelers are who we thought they were
i think the bengals couldve taken them with burrow next week fuck the steelers
fuck the steelers
thanks ravens bros now make it to the fucking playoffs so we can play yall again
eyyyy looks like they are still in their feelings when they lost to the team with no name
nice now we just have to go and take care of business tonight
he he
happy about that
love to see this two weeks in a row lets go
josh allen said it best
we got you fam lee evans for life
hooray
ab was right about boo boo
even their coach said they suck haha
lol even if you manage to eek past the browns youre still behind them and 3rd in the divisionhaaahahahaaahahahaaa
chiefs now in the 1 seed all the more reason to celebrate d

i still really wish the sub got as hyped for our wins as it did for steelers losses

these upvote parties are already cringe as fuck never mind the fact that the past two weeks its unveiled how much more we care about them doing bad than we do about us doing well apparently
damn i dont like the steelers but some of yall need to chill out some of these comments are kind of out of hand we have to give respect where respect is due

even though one of our losses to them was an asterisk and the refs screwed us in the 4th quarter of our first matchup doesnt change the fact that they beat us twice beat the titans and have a much better record than us

so kudos to the steelers for being good this year how dat l taste
fuck the steelers
amen
preach
fuck the steelers

hahahahaha the frauds have been exposed two weeks in a row fuck the steelers
you love to fucking see it woo hooo
3 weeks in a row really our practice squad almost beat them
when the ravens win i say yes

when the steelers lose i say yes
we win and if you guys win this week will be complete
this is what happens when the refs make decent calls
you love to see it

also reminder that we need to fire steve saunders

if it wasnt for his bullshit we couldve beaten the paper dragon
i remember when i said that the redskins and bills games were not gimmes for pitt a month ago when this sub was losing their minds about the ne loss i think

got lots of downvotes for that
yooo lmao this is me bro
lets relax on throwing too much shade that becomes fuel they are still a good team do i see them having a successful playoffs no but they are still capable of beating any team as is our team
lmfao swept by the steelers btw
all week all the talking heads were saying pittsburgh needed the loss against washington to reset and that it would make them so much better worked out really well for them didnt it
most overrated previously undefeated team in quite some time
fuck the steelers
maybe they need 3 more losses just to make sure theyre ready for the playoffs
removed
ben sucks
lmao 75 rat birds

uvredditdownloader

yessir they got exposed
can you guys still win the division if you win out and the steelers lose out
is now that the browns are threatening the steelers for the afc north crown forcing them to want the ravens to win tomorrow

rofl
who cares every single teams knowledgeable fans will root for the outcome that is most likely to benefit their own team less of these posts in the sub would make it better
couldnt this hurt us if pittsburgh ends up with a wildcard spot they own the tiebreaker
they should start cheering for us in their stadium

im still awake from yesterday and its gameday
i gotta get to work tho
yo this post weird lol

under the assumptions that the steelers would lose to clv and win against cin they would still have the best divisional record and thus win the division

under a few assumptions

bal 02 vs pit 20 vs clv 20 vs cin 42 divisional record

clv 11 vs pit 02 vs bal 20 vs cin 33 divisional record

pit 11 vs clv 20 vs bal 20 vs cin 51 divisional record

just realized that the steelers going 115 would assume they lose to the bengals once which would make them 42 in the division at that point i think conference record jumps in
i wish but the bengals are simply not beating anyone
we cant win the division

is the tweet still up
this tweet imo is reeeeeaaaaallllly indicative of why the steelers fucking suck against bad teams tuitt is one of their veteran leaders and if even he has the attitude of whatever this game will be easy you fucking know that shit seeps into the rest of the roster

this is why you never see teams like the patriots or chiefs consistently getting shit on by awful teams because they take every single opponent seriously whether theyre 120 or 114
the only stat they padding is dropped passes lmao
ben sucks
the steelers are a bunch of overrated blowhards

i say it because i believe it lol
so they beat us is what youre saying
man i havent been this stressed out about a game in a while im easily more stressed now than i was before the titans playoff game everything practically rides on what happens vs the browns tonight i know we can still technically get in at 106 but id rather us smack down the browns while theyre hot
definitely will be harder if we dont win although we do hold a tiebreaker over indy and the dolphins have the 2nd hardest schedule remaining
playoff excitement for sure and i wasnt stressed about the titans playoffs game beforehand cus i thought we had no chance losing
having to beat the browns to make the playoffs is nothing new lamar did it his first season as a a starter and im confident hell do it again
i think its because were playing the browns im nervous af
for some reason the browns are actually getting pretty lucky this year given their negative point differential thats the stat ive been looking at this year and according to that were better than our record shows
gonna get banned for it but browns gonna clap the shit out of you
win we go 85 with 3 very winnable games to plausibly win out and secure the 5 or 6 seed and enter the playoffs on a 5 game winning streak we prove we can beat playoff calibre teams

lose we go 76 even finishing 106 may mean we very likely dont even make the playoffs due to the dolphins colts and browns being far ahead of us plus we wont go anywhere far if we cant beat the browns theyre not even up there with kc and the bills at the top of the afc

were basically in our playoffs now because if we lose were basically out weve got an 8 week playoff stretch if we want to make the super bowl
well i mean this just sounds like a usual ravens season now doesnt it
afc is tight this year
dolphins could lose 2 and we could sneak in at 106 but yeah this is major
dolphins dont have an easy remaining 3 games i think theres a slight chance we still make it to post if we lose tonight but i really rather not take that chance and just stay comfortable with the w big one for sure
i guess we are back to the good old fashion ravens season last year was nice while it lasted
we could still lose tonight and get to the play offs

but winning will essentially guarantee our spot

whats interest about this game whoever wins this game has many ramifications across the league if we win tonight its really unlikely the patriots make the play offs
100 there isnt another game with the same stakes on the line we need this and to win out but this comes first
lookin like we gettin some good draft picks

every week this season i will be doing a crappy photoshop for our matchup here are the past weeks submissions

week 1 don lamar

week 2 the texans chainsaw massacre

week 3 over the top

week 4 he got game

week 5 gladiator

week 6 eagle eye

week 7 byecentennial man

week 8 no country for old ben

week 9 a rivers runs through it

week 10 patriot games

week 11 clash of the titans

week 12 the replacements

week 13 throw up the malcolm x
nice
hyyyyyyyyyyiiiiiii am the fannnnn of constant sorroowwwwwww
i havent been this excited for a game in a long time we are healthy and playing on prime time with playoffs implications who else is this excited ravensflock
if we win the turnover battle we win the game im super confident that its the recipe for success in any game that were in
how are we feeling about tonight
young stanley and boyle dont agree with the we are healthy claim
browns defense is still very bad myles garret and their d line could be good stopping the run but their secondary and lbs are weak as hell especially cuz denzel ward is still out im definitely concerned about stopping nick chubbkareem hunt but if we dont turn it over and play ball control and keep the ball away from them we should definitely win
baker might wake up feeling dangerous tho real talk seems like the perfect time for him to throw some picks its been over a month hes due
mannnn im hyped i feel like its been forever since we had the whole squad together
eh i was pretty excited for the chiefs game earlier in the season and that was such a let down its been hard to get too excited about the team ever since

we are a mediocre team so this one could go either way wouldnt be shocked if we steam roll them but also wouldnt be shocked if we get steam rolled
ravens fans i need your insight here ive got the choice of ravens defense and browns defense tonight in fantasy ravens have held me down all season but i heard we had some injuries did we get people back not from the offense this week any help appreciated
we have got to pressure baker
man im pumped and scared as hell tonight is basically a playoff game the way some of the teams left are playing im feeling like its a must win
every week we all say the same thing no turnovers run the ball

every week we have flashes of running well and change to passing to then go 3 and out or turn the ball over

tonight will be no different its happened all season and it will continue
i think well win a close one were starting to get healthier at the right time
excited and anxious hope the game plan is keep away possession football because chubb is a beast need some longer drives early to help the defenses conditioning come q4
my favorite college team florida went through quite possibly the worst saturday ever so itd help greatly if the ravens got it done tonight
gonna be a fun game ravens by 10 yannick ngakoue has his coming out partyand destroys mayfield
im excited i hope we can win ive been chatting with bills fans and they all want us to lose so between 4th and 12 and them sucking daltons dick and them rooting for the browns tonight they beat the steelers but they can suck my dick fuck the browns and fuck the bills edit seriously im being downvoted for saying fuck a team that wants us to lose tonight ok
always been a josh allen fan i wish the ravens made a move to jump up and grab him but obviously i love our boy first couple years hes inconsistent makes poor choices holds into the ball now hes a stud he has a cannon for an arm and has a large durable frame for 1015 yard rushes were starting to see the allen that the bills envisioned drafting theyre gonna be tough for a while
josh allen is great and has made tons of improvements but that started with the diggs trade idk why its so hard to understand for so many of us that literally every good qb in the league has an elite wr to go along with them that can bail them out in bad situations josh allen made a great jump but getting diggs made it so he didnt have to be perfect every time plus the bills oc is probably gonna be getting hc offers soon with the way hes transformed that offense i wonder what we could do if we got lamar a real wr 1 and fired romans uncreative ass
i really wanna beat the bills again those clowns think josh allen is already on mahomes rodgers wilson levels of play when he really isnt hes good dont get me wrong but for half the game dude looked pretty pedestrian i just dont like how so many bills fans are offended if someone compares jackson and allen jackson was the mvp last year and is having a down year but even in his down year jackson is still dragging this team to be competitive
ya bills are nice josh allen has improved so much still scared of the chiefs the most
be careful judging a quarterback off of 1 year he has a lot of good around him right now that wont always be the case
this is the ravens sub

love how rnfl shit all over harbaugh for being mad about it but now theyre currently praising the bills players for saying it pissed them off and motivated them had an elite offence 1 time in our entire existence and it makes us public enemy 1 online for some reason lmao
like this
ben sucks
hahaha this is great
the steelers are a hard nosed blue collar traditional organization we dont brag we put on our hardhats punch the clock and go to work

then this complete shithead runs out on the field and dances like an epileptic

one day hes going to get completely leveled by some defensive back who is as sick of this shit as the rest of us
because everyone should if they want be prepared to smile softly and say yes if the ravens professional football team from baltimore md carry or catch the football over the line marked end zone as then they get 6 points if they do this or kick the football through the uprights more times than the opposing team they shall win and i may even clap
may your tea be warm and your claps be thunderous
lets get this bitch
drinking the milk from my cereal lol
i will say woo

lol im in the same boat without brown
what maybe 17 for brown tonight
i love the primetime games but man now i know why i love sunday football
yeah my schedule has not appreciated all the changes 3 weeks in a row weve had a game on a week day which means im just bored and anxious for the game all day
im supposed to be having a productive day but no way jose am i getting shit done its win or go home szn boyssssss
i havent watched a game in a few weeks because of the schedule
yeah ive been so hyped for this game i havent done anything since around march
im working a 12 hour day till 11p

guess who isnt watching the game

if you bet on anything for a ravens divisional game you are crazy

you guys will get there youll be fine
steelers win division by winning week 17 steelers vs ravens wc weekend


ravens have to win out though steelers need to lose to the colts to set up week 17 for the division if the browns beat the steelers not only do they play each other again in the wc game but the ravens go to buffalo as the 6 seed

i couldnt get the ravens in at 106 because either the raiders or dolphins will likely finish 106 since they play week 16 at 76 raiders have chargers and broncos left and the 85 dolphins have patriots and bills ravens would need the dolphins to lose to ne

another scenario where the steelers beat the colts gets the ravens vs titans wc if the ravens browns and colts all finish 115
is it possible to still get in if we happen to lose tonight i dont think we will just curious
is there a scenario where browns and ravens both make it and fuck the steelers out of playoffs
i mean its possible even if we lose tonight be lets be safe and crush the browns
and then hope the browns dolphins and colts collectively lose at least one more
exactly lets go
obviously the easy answer is that we win out i think that technically we would be guaranteed a spot no matter what if we go 115 but thats the obvious way and lets face it running the table at 40 is not a realistic thing to pin your hopes on i think that 31 gives us some scenarios to get in still and the most important game strategically is the browns tonight to vault us into the 2 spot in the afc north if it came to it we lose to them and it would be almost guaranteed that one of our wc spots is already accounted for with a loss tonight our playoff path gets murkier we could possibly survive a loss to the giants since they wouldnt hurt our conference record but if were losing to them that might not bode well for the playoffs
will campbell play
lol then 4 more games and then boom world champs
not enough unfortunately
unfortunately nah man we havent got much help over the past 2 weeks chiefs won no surprise colts needed to lose but they blew the fraudulent raiders out steelers loss had no impact on us whatsoever it would have been great if the titans took care of business last week but nope only way i see us making the playoffs if we lose tonight is if mi ind and cle completely collapse and lose 3 straight which i doubt any of them are at the end of the day we got no one else to blame except ourselves to be in this position theres absolutely no excuses to lose to a tom bradyless patriots team and a titans team we were up by 10 at half time you gotta ask yourself at the end of the day do we really wanna go 1 and done for 3 straight years

coronavirus
browns steelers
m all
rnfl
hoes that shall be stunted on
browns steelers titans and patriots
any team who gets in our way
me


same
you let us win we take out titanscolts as seed 5 you guys get 7th seed and remove the over confident dumb steelers
another browns fan here with a different comprise you bring your best 46 players and well bring our best 46 players and we will see who has the better team tonight at 815
lets compromise you get the fuck out of our sub and we dont make as much fun of cleveland as we normally do
im confused none of us play the titans or colts moving forward


whos going to clean up all this peaking
i really hope the offense gets its shit together tonight fuck the browns
obj is gonna peak after the ravens shit on the browns
this will be some peak peaking peak
all we gotta do is turn on our winning charm and cleveland will be putty in our hands
we gotta shut the browns down tonight
the golden god has spoken
go mark andrews
wow crazy game doesnt get any nuttier than that our defense really needs some help thank god for justin tucker
will campbell play
not the same browns shit birds
da browns are gonna frig those ratbirds so hard
we lost ronnie stanely this is the biggest difference from week 1 their dline isnt full of scrubs but can lamar get the ball out quick
boyle too he has been a critical piece when trying to slow down myles
will roman allow jk and gus to cook ball control is how you beat a team like the browns grind the clock so that they cant use their run game make them have to throw with baker and punish them
how are the browns gonna cover andrews
they only have one starter and its fucking sendejo who they want fired out of a cannon if our wrs can open in under 2 seconds then we will be fine if they cant garrett will have beaten flukerphilipps typically and we will have to hope lamar can make a play on the ground
can we please just run gus and dobbins for 60 minutes

its cold guys dont like tackling when its cold its harder to catch just fucking run the ball nobody can stop us
fluker having to block garrett worries me thank god the refs never call any holding against him
i can almost guarantee that garrett is moved all over that line to attack the weak points be it fluker philips or obj
ronnie is goated but tbh i think the oline is doing a solid job in his absence zeus is honestly an even better left tackle than he is a right tackle and i thought tyre had a solid game at rt last week


the worst part about being a european browns fan is that youre a browns fan
kickoff at 1220pm here in australia very little work will be done this afternoon
my thinking is that being a browns fan in europe would be not being able to watch them play

this season was such a pleasant surprise coming off that terrible 07 letdown we finally found a long term solution at qbremember when joe was actually pretty athletic the defense came back to form we answered a losing season by going to the afc championship game good times man
that was a really fun year

wrong receiver diontae johnson is the one that cant catch lately washington is the one that made a nice contested catch to effectively seal the game against us the other week
washington is probably there best hands guy ebron or johnson is there worst

we need 2012 harbs and 2000 billick to get these dudes fired up
i want a fucking measurement
aint no lions den just as bunch of upstart lil cubs
no lie i wouldnt mind a return of bilick to our coaching staff bilick imo was a great coach and would have been around a lot longer if not for kyle boller look at how we did when we finally got a semicompetent qb in mcnair
isnt the mantra this season chase the lion i know last year was iron sharpens iron
god bless art modell
hope he rightfully gets into the hall of fame some day
why because fuck em thats why
art modell belongs in the hall of fame and it is illegitimate until he is inducted
totallywhere was the national outrage when the colts left town makes me sick
the browns stayed in cleveland unlike the indy situation and the nfl got them an expansion team almost immediately while baltimore was passed over for years including the carolina and jacksonville expansion
good stuff

funny how so much seems to shoulder on lamar a lot of our issues arent on him tough to be the star he is when a lot is going wrong around him

if we didnt have lamar we would have been eliminated from the playoffs a few weeks ago
lol you can post this article every time lamar plays a football game and it will be true
if a unanimous mvp doesnt silence critics well then i am not sure anything else will either most of his critics have already made up their minds and a win over the browns isnt going to change anything
they wont shut up even if he throws for 600 rushes for 300 with 8 total tds
lamar silenced the critics last year too but they just pretend like it didnt happen

in short fuck the critics
hell never silence the critics he could win 3 sbs in a row and as soon as he has a bad game theyll trash him again it happens to a ton of elite athletes
this is dumb hell only silence critics when he wins playoff games and gets us a ring
deadspin should be banned from rravens theyre actually the woat
yea right if he plays well its just the browns
and when he does literally all he can do and the rest of the team plays like dog shit he is blamed and labeled a choker or a rb
this article really makes me miss the old deadspin before it sucked and only said obvious things in a boring way
lol no way lamar could have a 4000 3010 season two years in a row and his critics would still be talking about how easily he will be figured out or how his throwing isnt actually good and its just his legs scaring defenses

fuck em just keep stacking the ws baby
but he wont

pad the stats should be an easy one
this reminds me of the time i watched my homeboy drop 108 points with d rose on 2k thats right not 108 with the bulls but d rose by himself lol
how the heck does that happen even in a video game
are ya winning son
okay so after our practice squad game i played madden and the game was so broken that every time i would tackle the steelers they would fumble

it would be like this sack worthlessberger and pick up the fumble for a touch down kick off tackle their returner who would fumble it lick it up td

it was like 170 something to 0
well done
madden nfl pee we doesnt matter fuck the steelers
madden steelers fans 3 games in twelve days
how does that even happen has to be offline playing a computer i cant go up more then 14pts on a guy online without them rage quitting

its beautiful
man in my franchise as raidersturnedblack knights the cpu always manages to score i held chargers in 2033 to 47 yards in the first half third quarter game decides that my defense now sucks
this has to be a solo
rent free
whenever the ravens lose i play the team we lost to on rookie mode as wellthis is usually the result it is a brilliant stress reliever
this is the kind of dedication to the rivalry i like to see
rent free

i feel like an idiot because it took me way too long trying to figure out what credib was supposed to be only to finally catch on to justin and ale

looks amazing
hey ravens reddit just wanted to share some new artwork with you that i finished up and am pretty excited for im a graphic designer and ravens fan that has been spending a lot of time of late making fake craft beer label designs for great nfl players its possible that you remember the lamar one i did a while back and now ive done justin tucker aka the goat of his position let me know what you think

getting covid in april had me feeling chest pains for months not to mention the cases of new autoimmune diseases after exposure not a virus to fuck about with as we dont know what itll do long term
my wife had it at the start of the pandemic she basically spent 3 weeks in bed completely knocked out i had to check on her regularly a d was afraid she was going to stop breathing scariest 3 weeks of my life
im still losing sleep to covid because i can hardly breathe without coughing when im laying down that shit hurts like a mfer too
i just got diagnosed on saturday and it is no fun at all im most concerned about my taste being gone still researching other potential long term affects
everyone take care while its true that many people who have covid have symptoms that are mild enough that they just need rest for several days and then feel better its also true that many people who are only mildly sick like that in the acute phase have longlingering debilitation of their health and many who are only mildly sick at first have been found to have actual damage to their lungs hearts livers kidneys andor brains even if this virus doesnt kill you or doesnt make you sick enough to need hospital care or doesnt make you sick enough at first to feel like you even need to see your doctor it can still very very badly fuck you up and we dont know for how long the damage lasts or if it is of a nature that we ever fully recover from best bet is to just not risk catching the damn virus in the first place

my family just met on zoom last saturday to attend the funeral service of a cousin who died from this thing after having a drivepast memorial service the week prior his wife is still recovering people in his office are sick some of their families are sick

but its not just about whether you have it badly or mildly its about not spreading it to other people who may have it worse than you
the second aspect of it thats so bad is a combination of things we now know to be facts about it
a you can have the virus and have zero symptoms for as long as 5 days and
b you are most contagious in the days before symptoms appear and
c in that asymptomatic or presymptomatic period you can test negative thus
d you can be spreading the virus to other people who you may end up killing or disabling long term and who may pass it on to others in the same period before they know theyre sick thus killing or disabling many others

this virus is far more contagious and spreads far more easily than even influenza
it spreads exponentially like that old 1980s commercial for shampoo i told two friends 3 total and they told two friends 7 total and they told two friends 15 total and they told two friends 31 total and they told two friends 63 total the commercial and thats if exposure is only at the rate of two additional people for each single new victim
santa took photos with about 50 kids before positive covid test georgia officials say
the potential spread for that is 50 100 200 400 800 1600 3200 etc etc etc
you could be part of that or the next initiator of that at any group gathering you attend wedding funeral dinner out at a restaurant football game why the fuck were there 12000 people allowed at the game last night

stay home folks use zoom or discord or google meet or webex or skype or facetime or any other resource to videoconference get together with family and friends and to work whenever and however you can watch tv watch movies workout in you living room i just saw a video about a guy who ran a marathon by running 3600 laps in his back yard

dont catch this and be sick but moreso dont catch it and spread it to others who you might kill or badly badly make ill for a long time we have over 300000 us deaths from this thing already were adding nearly 200000 new cases daily we have had single days in which deaths are as high as the death total from the terrorist attacks of 9112001 but were doing this to ourselves

there is nothing political about this we should all want to not kill or hurt other people

i hope you all stay safe and have a great holiday season and happy and healthy new year
anyone except ben roethlisberger
its not that bad for me at least but i understand that isnt the case for some people
removed
have some truzz bro seriously
i think we have other issues we need to focus on right now simple things like cleaning up penalties sick to death of illegal shifts etc
3424 ravens
have the mods simply ceased to exist
delete this young nephew

its obviously gonna be a tough game just sit back and crack a beer or an apple juice and hope for the best

enjoy it have faith big truzz
i think well be okay it would concern me more if they were playing in baltimore with the weather were having the ravens dont do well in rain and mud i think this is a big prove it game for both teams but i think the ravens will smack them in the mouth
get your truzz levels up were winning
ah cmon we go up by 40 into the late third were golden
itll be a tough out but the browns havent been amazing despite their record big loss to the steelers 10 point loss to the raiders and then 3 3 5 and 2 point wins over the bengals texans eagles and jags

the titans game was impressive but theyre very beatable
i think you mean if lamar can carry this dumpster of an offense

lamar had 70 completion last week and still people were complaining about his passing every qb misses throws he shouldnt have to be perfect to win a game

is he out playing still on the covid list i havent heard a peep about him recently
still on covid hasnt been 10 days yet
not playing but i dont get how he has all these negative tests and still cant play

cool man keep at it

they got lucky against us both times
i knew they wasnt good at running the ball but i didnt know they was god awful at running the ball

nah greg roman
harbaugh still has me on hold but ill ask when he answers
question is how often are the ravens running out of sets like that how often are they running 4 wr sets ravens might not have the personnel to run it or run the scheme enough to make it a tendency breaker
because greg roman

jealous
deceased

please llama i need you we need you

edit and he fucking delivers
whoever drew this youre amazing
yo the browns sub stole our idea go check it they have one with baker fucking lames

norcal ravens fan represent
inland empire ravens fan

ayyy sacramento flock represent
i love the representation of lifelong ravens fans in all states i also live and california and have hated being called a bandwagoner for the past 2 years ravens flock
wuddup sac wuddup marysville i know its ravens flocking there too
hell yeah cali brother lets get a win
og flacco jersey niccccccceeeee
cringe
jesus this is exactly what i imagine ravens fans look like
how do you end up with a fat asian like the entire dna of asians is small petite you landed the arkansas version of asian sorry bro
thought id make one of these for mnf feel free to add more in the comments

take a drink when

dj fluker called for holding
mark ingram runs for 2 yards on first down
defense gives up a first down trying to strip the ball instead of making a tackle
announcers try to jinx tucker
calais campbell bats a pass down
deep shot to a completely covered marqiuse brown
lamar breaks ankles and runs for a first

take a shot for

illegal formation
judon personal foul
50 yard completion
long run by dobbins who is then promptly taken off the field for ingram
we pass three times in the redzone and are forced to kick a fg

finish your drink

ravens win
ravens lose
ravens tie
take a shot for illegal formation

id rather not get alcohol poisonning thanks
are you trying to kill us with these lol
take a drink when

the cameras show harbaugh yelling at a referee
do you want us to die im in
forget everything else all you need is illegal formation that should be more than enough to get you drunk tonight
taking a shot to judon
i cant sit idly by and work west coast when there are hoes to be stunted upon
idk how to feel about this game honestly i just hope we dont act all entitled because we beat the soft ass cowboys

thank god this is the last non sunday game i just cant focus on work on these days and there was no pregame thread so here we go
ravens 2413 browns lead 1310 at half but get shut out in the second ravens convert either a flea flicker hb pass or fake punt ravens get a pick six baker mayfield gets strip sacked
time to remind em why art left that turd place
2 fumbles and no recoveries classic
i think this is going to be a slugfest of a game i think the matchup that could be the most critical is going to be fluker vs garret
a mnf win and a foot of snow dear santa make is happen
everyone wants us to lose this week i really hope we disappoint them
god damn it feels good to be a gangster
lets go
does anybody know why luke wilson is inactive is it just because mandrews is back
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuck the browns
let lamar jk and gus cook
lamar walking in with thug necklace deserves to lose
yes i am joking although sometimes i feel like some ravens fans hate the steelers more then they like the ravens and would actually go along with this
i hate losing more than i like winning
id rather fts in the playoffs
gus better get 15 carries same for jk lets get ahead early and run it down these turds throats
their pass defense is much worse than their rush defense and denzel ward is out

obviously we gotta always rock with the run to a degree but if there were ever a time for lamar to put the team on his back and shred a defense through the air this would be it
lamar has a huge day through the air 280 3tds
please let this be the game we get a jackson 5 but ill take a win with whatever
and thatll be a yard maybe two for ingram
i feel like snead is going to get the bulk of the work today

i read the first 3 words and started to panic
thats my qb no matter what all this dude thinks about is winning


basically stop or at least slow down their two headed rushing attack and stop making those costly mental mistakes ie penalties turnover
chubbachubba choo choo yall are about to get run over

not ideal for stopping chubb gonna need bwill and derek wolfe to step up
madubuike pls man pls go hard
shoot just have him at the line batting balls down
anyone have inactives yet
i remember saying that calais might have the hardest time coming back from covid and i was downvoted to oblivion here but its clear calais lungs already affected by asthma didnt heal properly

edit it was his leg but he said his lung capacity is still severely diminished which doesnt help in rehab



goran burner has such a way with words
the steelers beat the ravens twice he forgot to mention that



this drive is 100 lamar dont ever talk about my boy again
is every browns fan morbidly obese
baker mayfield has my dad is a lawyer energy
lamar cant throw outside in clutch situations louis riddick

lamar makes a fucking sensational clutch outside throw with 30 seconds left in the half

fuck lmao louis riddick
without lamar this offense is historically bad we really were blessed with him
lamar came back in the game like goku on planet namek
their team name is literally the color of poop
refs just make football such shitty these days did the browns complete any first downs themselves that entire drive
my favorite part of that half was the broadcasters straight up calling out marquise and edc about getting this team a receiver
did lamar just run back to back 2 minute drills perfectly im amped
friendly reminder jk dobbins smashed my girlfriends cousin at osu
cant throw interception if you dont throw checkmate jinxing announcers
shocked there was no flag there not that it warranted it but im shocked they didnt make up something
broadcasters are you sure there isnt even a slight chance we could make this not a td can we ask our rules expert

rules expert you are both cocks
went into the clowns subreddit and my iq went down 20 points reading that cesspool of hot takes lmao

the ravens have done absolutely nothing and have 21 points

yeah besides rushing for 134 yards in the first half and capitalizing on the good field position your shitty ass offense gave us i guess we did do nothing
when i look at what allen has with diggs what kyler has with dhop i feel so jealous ravens certainly havent made passing an easy situation for a young qb
youre getting downvoted if you call that man hollywood we use his government name until he proves himself cool enough to have a nickname
if you take away the added hype and drama around postseason games i actually think we might have just watched the best football game ever
baltimore shot themselves in the foot is a funny way to say that we are getting fucked by bullshit calls
if we win then i knew wed pull through all along if we lose then i had no expectations for the rest of this season the lies we tell ourselves
all of rnfl is in agreement that this is some crazy ref ball going on tonight
defense had a great series there

refs handed cleveland 25 yards and a new set of downs
since we give roman shit when he sucks we should give him his due when hes good that was a nice drive
imagine this guy with a true wr1 imagine
riddick is a great color commentator hes saying everything ive thought all season

they need a receiver why are they playing zone lamar needs to be lamar running is okay sometimes its what makes you special

legit all of that
brandon williams the man they call big baby

yeah they call baker the same thing
let lamar poop in peace jfc
worst defensive series in ravens history
this would the perfect game for yannick to show the fuck up
this was some bullshit 3 unlucky fumbles bs flags
refs saved the browns drive
sideline reporter i just spoke with this mans grandson he told me how he encountered a ton of racism from shitty people

announcer so cool to hear these backstories1

bro what
why throw the ball when running will do and destroy their morale at the same time
yall id never let chuck clark live that down as a teammate
riddick going mark andrews says here marquise this is how you catch is all of us in this sub rn
andrews is legitimately the only starting caliber pass catcher on this team
anyone else see the ravens fan and browns fan barking in each others face earlier they were basically kissing
give souljas targets to duvernay
lamar is 36 all 3 incompletions r drops
cut hollywood i swear to fucking god the audacity to open his mouth and complain and then play like this since
i had a bet for cleveland to lose by less than 4 are you fucking kidding me
a play that might get missed dobbins taking the hit and bowling through it to pick up the 2pt conversion huge
this was some fucking wwe shit tonight the match is about to be lost the heels are stomping the baby faces and then the baby face world champ shows up and good ol jr screams lamar cold lamar cold lamar cold he beats down the heels and brings us to victory
that was justin tuckers 16th gamewinning field goal of his career ice in his veins sgellison
prayers up for mcsorley
hey look i dont wanna start shit but this game was reminiscent of the 2012 team that looked bad around this time but pulled out a miracle win or two and got rolling
stefanski throw a hail mary but dont score we can knock one of them unconscious if they hit the goalpost

baker fuck it
this halftime is really fucking long
whats the point of having souljas if you never use them

welllllll hollywood maybe if souljas would hold onto the fucking ball theyd be used you fucking ass
this is perhaps the best 60 minutes of ravens regular season football i have ever seen what a game this was mvp lamar and goat tucker
that was the wildest game ive ever seen
the ravens always start off like ass every single big game harbaugh needs to get his shit together
so tired of seeing sustained drives from absolute bullshit calls that rtp was a textbook tackle

this issue will continue to go on till football is hurting from it just a damn shame

browns are loved for being sacks of shit losers
harris has played great for a replacement off the street been very impressed with him
lamar is this offence bailing out shit receivers shit oc and a kinda shit line
ima need lamar to change his cleats or something
judon is just praying to the ref every time he touches baker
shout out to dez he goin crazy on twitter rooting for us wish you were here 88
remember that video of baker crying like a little bitch while resisting arrest didnt realize he played football with that exact same energy
guess what browns fans trolling you guys never won a superbowl so kindly fuck yourselves
guys i might be homeless and voiceless tomorrow but it was worth it
the last minutes of that game thats the kind of passing offense i wanna see consistently
since when is 15 men on the field against the rules

soft ass new age football
that rtp was horrible and the pi was really iffy
fuck these refs lol
these announcers just sound disappointed when the ravens do anything nice
honestly the passing game is a fad lets draft 8 fullbacks this year
see marqueese this is how you catch it
to the guy earlier i said hollywood didnt have enough targets to consider him a constant dropper i take it back
these guys are talking about hunt being an inspiration for kicking a chick rice gets blackballed from the league lmfao
defense folds every big game start paying for weapons for lamar
how the fuck am i supposed to sleep after what i just watched
i actually feel bad for that dude crying right now i started laughing my ass off when i saw him and then i started thinking that hes just the same dude as me he just happens to route for a team that i like less that being said baker mayfield could eat a dick
s c o r a g a m i
yall the theatrical nature of this game can we talk about it a constant back and forth for the first half lamar goes off for not one but two rushing tds his constant slipping change the shoes but we have the momentum second half the d makes a much needed big play int lamar has to go into the locker room for cramps browns come back things looks bad our 3rd string qb goes out lamar limps out of the locker room for a 4th and 5 with the season literally on the line throws a 60 yard td to hollywood who has had several crucial drops throughout the game its a literal miracle but the defense cant stop baker they score again to tie it up with 61 seconds left the offense gets in field goal range and our kicker the most reliable in nfl history wins it with 2 seconds left then a safety to end it 89 totally points you cant make this shit up

edit didnt mention two missed extra points two 2 pt conversions hollywoods previous drops lamars throwing to himself on a td celebration and chuck clark bonking off the field foal
jimmy is an absolute g for blowing that lead block up
not a single fucking run you dumb fucking oc
any nonbrowns fans who like baker must have never watched him play he is the whiniest whimpiest qb in the league
if we lose this game its 100 on defense
so lamar was pooping right
i dont wanna know how hopeless it must feel to be an opposing team when they need tucker to miss a kick
every time the ravens sweep the browns an angel gets its wings
jimmy smith is in
shut up about the browns shit up about the browns
you want to call offensive face mask there refs
ok this isnt funny anymore roman needs to be fired for the illegal motions at this point this is unacceptable
greg roman simply has to be fucking fired and lamar needs to be coached up

there was a shallow crosser open it wasnt a first but it was probably 8 yards and not a sack for field position

and another procedure flag

this team isnt going anywhere if it cant even do basic things correctly
got a lamar jersey sitting under the tree should i tear it open and put it on
we run when passing is necessary and pass when running is necessary ive never seen play calling like this im speechless
we need to get lamar a pair of these
dear mark i feel like i can call you mark because you and me are so alike id like to meet you one day it would be great to have a catch i know i cant catch on 3rd down as well as you but i think youd be impressed with my speed i love your hair you run fast did you have a good relationship with your father me neither these are all things we can talk about and more i know you have no been getting my letters because i know you would write back if you did i hope you write back this time and we can become good friends i am sure our relationship would be a real touchdown

9 allen lazard green bay packers
10 will fuller houston texans
11 marvin jones jr detroit lions
rnfl is in shambles
its always bothered me hunt is allowed to play should of got the same treatment as rice
lamar has to make those passes hes been overthrowing guys a lot this season snead was open and so was the last pass he has to make those passes
you guys are not gonna fuckin believe this but john harbaugh used to be a special teams coach
browns legit try to get a penalty on every play about as bad as philip rivers
all i hear is gargle gargle gargle i love cleveland cock from the announcers
fuck baker trash qb i bet he doesnt even poop
imagine having a wr1 that catches simple 5 yd passes
ya know ive wanted to give marquise a break but fuck that guy you talk shit in public and this is how you play what a fucking nerd
70 yard fg attempt pls
holy fuck we won that game

lamar coming out of the locker room on 4th and 5 was legendary
justin tucker is a fucking legend i could have been born at any time throughout human history and here i am watching the goat split the uprights time and time again in the clutch

lamar stunted so hard today
ingram didnt get a single carry

i think roman got the hint lol
i like watching lamar jackson put the team on his back but i also hate that he literally has to do that to in order for us to win games
these mf refs
refs smoking that loud pack
jimmy smith giving his body to blow up the lead block saves a 1st down there dude just got screwed by some bs call too thats playing like a raven
2 guys in masks yelling at each other face to face

2020 everyone
guys i put on my lamar jackson jersey at the beginning of this drive youre welcome
the real test is not abandoning the run after halftime dobby and the bus are the better duo
didnt snead have a reception on that drive announcer just said he hasnt had a catch
fuck the steelers
offense is getting it going so naturally its time for the defense to stop trying
dude how has he not changed his shoes yet wtf
if it is a cleats issue how have they not fixed it yet also why is it always so frustrating watching the ravens this year every game something just seems to be going outlandishly wrong
chuck clark you think i dont have football instincts watch me try to catch this ball out of bounds on the final play of the half and run into the goalpost
i am once again asking for a wide receiver that can catch the ball
lmao at dalton blowing out the bengals
new ravens fan checking in
boomer legit just said the bears shat on the texans on live television what is happening tonight
live image of lamar after half time


and theres the cookie cutter harbaughst comment
since when can you fucking challenge that
not tryna be that guy but harbaugh has been out coached in multiple games this season
offense has scored 34 and doesnt feel like enough defense bby what is u doin hope marcus is okay
why are we blaming the play calling when we shouldve gotten the first on a wide open pass and our supposed number 1 receiver dropped it
im in agreement with the posts that he is now marquise someone called hollywood shouldnt have hands of lead and the heart of a mouse
entire defense got cramps
lamar cant come from behind
few positive points

1 dobbins will be a really good rb
2 bowser is ballin even if the def sucks rn
3 tucker is still tucker
lets see some of that mark andrews and snead action tonight especially with how atrocious the browns secondary has been and with no denzel award tonight exploit the fuck out of that loss

and as much as i love seeing tucker out there i want to see him only on the field for extra points and kickoffs tonight
rnfl is gonna get reeeeeal messy today no matter how this game goes
lamar ill do it my damn self
lamar fuck it well do it live
please go for it on 4th and 8
thats definitely the most unfortunate thing to happen to the browns on a field goal against the ravens on mnf
that drive is why roman needs to go sorry im done with it i call better games in madden
why hasnt jackson changed to longer cleats hes slipping almost every play
idc lisa show us the supposed penalty
they didnt even show the illegal use of hands call on the broadcast replay
did john timeout for a hug i love that guy
read the fucking flair
wholesome
i feel we will be seeing this gif for years to come
wink has to have a sitdown with peters and figure out more creative ways to put him in coverage this one on one soft zone hybrid aint it cuz kc exposed it
offence starts heating up and our defence starts getting soft as per usual this season
thats okay theyre a good team theyre gonna score turnovers are going to be the difference
cleveland is a shit stain on the us and i say that as a canadian
lol marquise this is how you catch it
marquise this is how you catch it oh my i felt that
he said marquise this is how you catch it lmaoooo
the ravens need to go all out for an elite reciever this offseason whether its trading up in the draft to make sure you get one of devonta smithjaylen waddle or you trade for a star veteran like julio jones
hollywood brown has struggled since he opened his mouth at wanting the ball more
lamar has 88 ya better than baker we just havent passed the ball much
i am once again asking for a sack
fuck stefanski for challenging with 6 seconds in the quarter left making us sit through an extra commercial break
if the defense is never gonna get a stop when it matters why invest in it might as well get lamar weapons and an oline
this is the steelers on christmas day this is the bengals 4th and 12
lamar is carrying rn and the media will blame him tm watch the ravens need to give him some help
i take back everything i said when i was emotional during the game
that was one of the best games ive seen all season fucking awesome game of football
did anyone hear the commentators say how ironic it would be if the ravens won because of lamars arm

baker regression game please
just blatant facemask right there
now let me see mcsorely do that
lol the fat browns fan and ravens fan fighting lol
just run the fucking ball greg godammit
lmaaooo proche a troll for that one
thats no bus thats a fucking train engine engine 35 on baltimore transit line if my train fall of the track pick it up pick it up pick it up pick it up
im from montgomery county and ive always wished the people here were more like the guys in baltimore bmore is always such a wholesome and positive place compared to the dc area
made a routine on my alexa where it flashes my light purple and plays a bus horn at the command gus bus
imagine lamar with a stud number 1 wideout
espn bringing the bollywood brown heat lmao
man we need some receivers or were gonna get figured out real quick this sweet run game is only going to take us so far need to become more wellrounded with more weapons on offense
lamar covered up our receiving corps last year because he would just pick up 510 on the ground every single time everyone was covered this year he really want to find those passing plays i think the past couple game hes started to be more willing to take off again though i hope he keeps going with that energy
feels like it should be 4th quarter flags are making this a slow game and im old and tired
astros cheated
oh right i almost forgot kareem hunt is an actual piece of dogshit
kareem hunt is a better kicker than cody parkey

change my mind
every incompletion baker is looking for a flag
baker and looking for a flag name a more dynamic duo
its entirely redundant to say that baker is calling for a flag hes doing that every single play
defense is refusing to close the game out
ravens had 15 men on the field and baker still couldnt complete the throw
lamar time to wipe
to the browns shits who were coming in here trolling halfway into q3

suck a fat one and go back to your shit thread and discuss the shit conditions of your turf

also be mad that we took your shit team and turned it into a 2 time super bowl champion and pray that we dont do the same thing with your new shit team
if that were any other game not involving the ravens id call it the best of the year but i prefer not to nearly go into cardiac arrest while watching football so hawkscards it is
you gotta have aflac cigna aetna obamacare bcbs and the general to cover the expenses for all the heart problems the ravens give you game to gamebut damn its like crack i keep coming back
we fought baby we won
why is that not a facemask the fuck
facemask
he grabbed peters facemask
call the face mask on the wr there unreal
how is that not a fucking facemask or illegal hands thats absurd
field lookin sus
maybe we should let lamar gus and dobbins carry the team that seems to work
love p ricard having a 300 pounder who can move that well in space as a blocker is huge
i could mute this commentary its so cringe
i havent seen an entire drive gifted to a team like i just saw with that one thank god our defense held up against the shits and the refs
are you sure we cant throw a flag for a missed kick

all the refs
running the ball got us a td last drive so roman calls 3 straight passes
why do we throw the ball 3 straight downs get greg roman out of baltimore now
averaged 59 ypc on the first drive so naturally we throw it on the second drive
44 for mvp
lol that was a sneaky great play by proche
wait is lamar jesus
this is what we need to do establish the fuck out of the run and then the passing game will follow
can you imagine lamar ever having enough time to stand still and make a throw
yall still wanna defend hollywood hes ass
lmao the shade to hollywood from the commentators
dude this field is 100 an issue you cannot have turf this slippery with perfect weather conditions
lamar lamar jackson jackson
nobody



chuck clark head go bonk
seeing gardner minshew back vs the ravens warms my heart
i hate that they choose to bring back minshew vs us hell be down 300 then come back
it would be fucking huge to come out of the half and kill a shot load of time and score a td would set the rest of the game up exactly how we used to
satisfied but holy shit where would this team be without andrews

if any playoff team shuts down our run game were toast
the fallen soulja
it would be cool if there was an alternate broadcast where the announcers dislike mayfield as much as i do
not at all blaming lamar for tonight but damn lamar has to make that throw
brown doing his best perriman impression tonight
someone has to get fired after this season deadass
fuck marquise brown again for that drop killed a drive and put the defense back out there
lamar stop pooping plz
wolfe is the only one playing with fucking heart
havent had a good tucker game winner in a while
lamar runs in

i need a hero
this feels like some wwe shit
is this a fucking anime
poopgate almost cost us against a team called the browns
holy shit that safety means we cover the 3pt spread lmaoooo vegas baby
i hope this is the spark we needed to get hot at the right time of the season i hope our offense gains confidence and our defense gets angry lets get this ship baby
rnfl gamethread is gonna be toxic as fucl because everyone wants us to lose so im staying here today lets fucking go
hows that not a facemask
that drive is dead at the other 30 is not for lamar action jackson looks like a man on a mission today
mvp

mvp

mvp
im so surprised we saw a deep pass and more than one penalty that went our way on the same drive
they wanted to throw a flag so bad go crawl back up your mommas ass ref
mayfield already gotten clobbered twice feels good
browns fans looking for penalties this holiday season
surprised they didnt call pass interference on that fg attempt
ha all that for nothing dicks
smart play from proche
wholesome
need that harbs lamar hug gif
ngl man im kinda enjoying seeing the old 2018 fuck the forward pass stop this if you can bitch all running offense

run the browns into the turf
first drive 2 throws td

second drive 3 throws 3 and out

third drive 1 throw td
marlon needs to play man coverage only hes too good to play zone
can we ever have both good offense and defense
elliot is late twice cost us step up bro big time game
me irl aww man i hope garrett is okay

garrett probable to return

me internally fuck cant he miss one game
greg roman can make lamar jackson boring
is baker really bitching to the refs lmfao pussy bitch
baker has a face you want to punchoverand over
damnnn he said okay marquise this is hoe you catch it

sam koch doing it all just saved that return
am i the only one who didnt know you could challenge that
jfc 15 on the field
1 more quarter boys dont give up hope we got this all fucking day
this game has been 70 commercials 30 game
imagine if you got up from your desk at work to take a shit and then there was a nationally televised broadcast that was like sam is not at his desk we dont know whats happened meanwhile you just trying to crap in peace
hollywood deadass the biggest pretender on this team
ive been defending brown all season but after all these drops tonight i cant anymore
whats the point of having souljas when you dont have no hands
marlon said this teams current identity was choking after that playoff loss to the titans i really hope that they aint gonna prove that statement right tonight
this is cleveland football shut the fuck up dude theyve been the laughingstock for decades
this team peaked last season
thats a lot of pooping cmon
all started with a dropped perfect pass
glass shatters

lamar jackson enters the ring carrying two freshly cracked cans of boh
42 points not enough to win

this defense is trash
lamars post game i had to poop and walks out
lamar was like bobby boucher coming out at half time
anyone see peters on the ground on that last play im worried
fam baltimore will never win an easy game their goal in life is make everything hard
just a quick reminder for any browns fans lurking
ah yeah espn just showed that classic mnf finish with will how the fuck a baby fracture its arm hill returning the kick6 for a ravens win
dont let the beginning of a ravens game distract you from the fact that the steelers lost 2 straight and are the worst 110 team ever
massive face mask
that drive was 100 lamar i love this dude
ok defense pls make a stop here no more gimmick plays
announcers trying to save these bullshit ass calls clowns
outside of the phantom flags defense is awake now
tackling the blocker to slow down baker was kinda clutch
what the fuck is mayfield smoking
a little american pie did he stick his dick in a ref or something
announcers one of the best missed field goal attempts ive ever seen by the browns they really came to play
i hate greg i hate greg i hate greg
i am a greg roman apologist but that was bloody awful three passes and another presnap penalty gtfo
thank god mayfield is a dumbass he couldve run for the first down there i think
the rravens drinking game drink 1 shot of bleach every time greg roman is mentioned
refs a fake fair catch i should throw a flag or something
proche and duvernay have turnd our return game on its head this year lfgo
now our defense shitting the bedgreat
our offense is going to have to keep scoring our defense isnt winning this game for us
change your fucking shoes lamar
turfgate
get some new cleats for lamar this shitty cleveland landfill grass isnt meant for competitive football
lamar looking like hes on his way to fire the equipments manager himself
god the mnf commentators have to be the dumbest in the league
bruh yannick is flying
isnt that grounding
yannick slipped too wtf is this field
are we sure that wasnt a penalty on judon for illegal forcing of an intentional grounding by the qb
bakers got his bitch and moan face on
baker crying fuels me
ill never forgive some of you calling for trace a few weeks ago
must be nice to be cool

lamar threw that ball hits the wall and comes right back to him perfectly

if i would have done that the ball would have immediately deflected and hit me in the nuts causing me to vomit and then subsequently pass out
the announcer just roasted tf out of hollywood lmao
baker iq at 500 get the ravens to injure themselves running into poles n shit
browns fans llamar cant throw

baker mayfield bet i can throw this here football over them there goalposts on this hail mary
conspiracy take the browns greased the field
im still really high on brown but man hes definitely gotta step up this week he drew that dpi earlier which wouldve been a touchdown if the line didnt immediately fall apart and force lamar to throw a bad pass but hes gotta do more


his hands were so good last year idk whats going on rn
bad touch by lamar there but why are 3 pass catchers all next to each other
marcus peters pick 6 incoming
our linebackers are bbq chicken in coverage
things im grateful for

1 that baker still has no touchdowns

2 cody parkey
yea browns thanks for hiring this man who curb stomped a woman
whatever money we were gonna give to judon give it to bowser
no joke can we raise tuckers tackle rating in madden
all we had to do was press on 4th and 4 make them take a 5050 deep shot
i keep on telling yall jihad ward is underrated af

we need to resign him
lamar had to take the browns to the superbowl
peters has been all famine no feast this year
fuck hollywood brown
this is hard to watch
maybe the souljas were the friends we made along the way
that was a blatant hold
were really gonna blow this cuz brown couldnt catch the easiest 5 yard catch of the game
most frustrating and disappointing season ive ever had to watch
well if lamar cant come back in thats probably our season
can we get some positive energy boys plenty of time
we are the biggest chokers in football every single fucking year since 2014 except 15 pats steelers bengals chargers titans and now browns different team same shit every time
if the ravens offense can put up over 30 points without any turnovers and still lose its the defenses fault that simple
as soon as lamar go out we fall apart cant make this shit up
honestly anyone saying lamar is soft doesnt know him or hasnt ever had cramps cramps are fucking miserable if theyre in the wrong spot
bah gwad its lamar jackson with the steel chair
they really drove down the entire field in 20 seconds
i hate this defense

i hate this defense

i hate this defense

i hate this defense

i hate this defense

i hate this defense

i hate this defense
defense still needs to run laps til sunday
baker mayfield looks shell shocked
im emotionally dead in the best fucking way
cant remember the last time ive yelled like this great game great w
hahah b will said thats my quarterback sounding like a crying to
what a wild season good or bad proud of our boys
booger the real mvp
hurts watching this team get outsmarted on every play
do they ever call face mask on the o
if yall had any doubts lj is still the fucking man
alright defense lets do the opposite of that last drive
lamar is just carrying this game on his back
keep getting bailed out
surprised we didnt get a penalty on that
stop giving the browns bullshit auto first downs
stefanski think he playing madden
go for it assholes i dare you
huge play by jimmy smith taking out a couple blockers or baker may have gotten that
three fumbles in the first quarter and didnt recover a single one the only luck the ravens have is bad luck
still not sure how browns had a clear recovery on that fumble
baker in progressive commercial i cant feel my fingers my girlfriend who doesnt watch or understand football but knows we hate the browns good
every timer a kicker misses i love tucker even more
guess where the browns offense has been for the past 2 super bowls

at
home
with
baker mayfield
hahahahha i hate greg roman
we threw the ball 1 time on our touchdown drive then come out and do 3 pass plays for a 3 and out it makes no sense
3 straight pass attempts with an illegal motionshift typical
nice fake by proche
miles garrett moty nominee is a fn joke
thats on deshon elliott
mp cant cover two guys
why are there furries at a browns game
the comments in here after a team scores soft as toilet paper
still waiting for yannick to make a play how many weeks have we had him
well manicured field
the amount of people slipping cant just be lamar something is up with this turf
can we all get lamar a new pair of cleats for christmas
dont worry guys im driving to cleveland to give him my cleats
lmao running on 3rd and 19
forget fire roman fire our fucking equipment manager
all these fucking stadium commercials from baker and this is actually how the field is what a fucking joke
yannick been balling today he just gotta finish the sacks
love the pressure by yannick and judon
this field position 2 time outs we need a td
let lamar cook
someone in this thread said the ravens goal in life is to make things hard and ive been laughing about it all quarter lol
look marquise this is how you catch it
please just get lamar a stud receiver next year so we have more than just andrews to throw to


marquise this is how you catch it

the shade
hmmm do i go to bed at my normal time so im well rested for work tomorrow or do i stay up and just be a grumpy troll at work
baker mayfield went full uncle rico
and marquis brown finally hangs on to one
offense good defense bad defense good offense bad never ending cycle
remember the kick six good times
reminder that kareem hunt is a piece of shit
why is kareem hunt in the league if rice isnt
browns players the incident where i assaulted someone does not define who i am
yeah after that drive i think im gonna stay away from rnfl for a bit
tyus bowser marquise brown
john harbaugh special teams drink
announcer mentioned harbaughs special teams connection drink
yep mayfield calculated that risk reward exaaactly right and just got unlucky rolleyes
baker curls his toes when he takes shits
the number of sacks we miss is mind boggling
be nice if we didnt play 10 yards off on 4th and 4 make them try to beat us over the top
ugh bc there are 6 seconds left there is gonna be a whole another round of commercials
you can challenge that wtf
lamar is taking a brown
my man had to shit
lamar is pooping lol
lamar just taking the browns to the super bowland flushing them
can we get an update on 8
yall give me a fucking headache with how quickly you turn on everyone
how tf do you drop that unbelievable
need to bench brown for a game no jersey

and a thousand reps on the jugs
its no longer hollywood its marquise brown at best or bumwood
all the investment on defense for them to play like this
marquis completely fucked us
our defense is very mentally weak they give up a play and start pointing fingers get peters out of here
blocked extra point sure looks big now
we just arent good enough its that simple
typical 2 score lead vanquishes and the offense goes ice cold at the most critical time
watch roman force mcsorley throw to a midget who cant catch a thing instead of using his running backs
marsuise needs to go im sorry

ive never hated a team like this one getting shredded by baker mayfield should be the gutter of your professional career and this defense just walks off like its expected
if we lose this loss is on brown
imagine drafting brown over dk metcalf
by gawd thats lamars music
lamar jackson with a steel chair
yo someone needs to get fined for field maintenance like its not even raining or snowing
we cant go to ot with this defense
lamar carrying this sorry ass defense
no lie this defense needs to walk the fuck home
gonna name all my kids justin tucker
what a awesome win for you guys
the browns giving up a safety on the last play might be the most browns thing ever
couldnt beat us down 2 qbs and with receivers who cant catch
went into their house punched them in the mouth and lamar ruined their bathroom
im not sleepin anytime soon damn what a game
my brain could hardly keep up with those last couple minutes
we gotta get it
colts literally steal our team in the dead of night silence

browns lose their team for 3 years and keep all their history real shit stay woke cleveland rock and roll hall of fame yall
every week we have penalties for too many men and illegal formations how is this still happening every fucking week
losing faith in hollywood and fast
drafting hollywood over dk is a huge mistake we need a bonafide number 1 receiver i cant believe we didnt sniff around diggs
i think this is the greatest football game that was ever played
i cant even tell if im hyped for ravens games this year or just terrified
im gonna get my six pack or 12 pack and keep chugging away like itll help the outcome
calais is playing tonight kind of surprised but happy with this
im so sick of everyone rooting for the browns because its an underdog story shut the fuck up lmao 99 of other teams rooting for the browns either feel bad for them or just hate the ravens the second baker mayfield beats their teams theyll root against the browns like we do
bruh higgens was all over mp facemask
facemaskno see how thats gonna be
everyone take a goddamn deep breath this sub is so stressful
pathetic showing by the defense please get it together and cover the fucking screens
two fumbles and an uncalled facemask a little bit of luck for them but those screens could be an issue
field looking incredibly suspect
that drive was literally all lamar
keep it on the ground exhaust them on defence
lets go mvp
i think we severely underestimate how bad this team would be without lamar jackson
you cant contain lamar bitches
lamar looks like he is locked in tonight just need the defense to come to the party
lamar carried us that drive
oh this is gonna be one of those fucking games
jesus christ refs can you buy us dinner if youre going to bone us
you have to be joking thats the second weak ass penalty on the drive alone
im shocked they didnt call that roughing
were definitely getting more pressure with yannick and judon both on the field and its rattling baker
boys i found the blank check the browns wrote to the refs
yall we came to play tonight garbage tier luck can only last so long lets get this dub boys
shoulda let the refs kick that fg cocksuckers
three passes one drop two sacks what is roman smoking
three straight pass plays wtf
step 1 get lamar out of his bowling shoes

step 2 run the fucking ball
i swear james proche our best punt returner since jacoby jones
i love proche
that harbs lamar hug is enough to make a man cry
why pass ball when run do trick
love our run game but our passing offense is so far behind and its not because of lamar
idc if we throw 4 passes all night with this slippery ass field all i care about is putting up more points keep feeding gus and jk

the sooner we embrace the run the sooner we win out lamar has next season and the season after that to prove he can throw
were fucking their shit up on man so of course we start playing zone lol
lets get some points before half and we looking good
we are still in a good position get any sort of points here without leaving time and then start of the 2nd half with a td
we run on 2nd and 21 lmfao
well at least we made an effort by giving it to justice hill on 3rd and 19
another waste of a drive thanks to clevelands trash field and romans shit playcalling
roman you coward
wtf type of grass did these clowns plant out there
its like roman doesnt even trust his own mvp qb im glad lamar called his dumb ass out
why the fuck is lamar not ripping his cleats off the second he touches the bench he had three people surround him like hes a medieval european king to put his coat on for him so somebody isnt busy enough to go get him new cleats ffs
if we lose we gotta fire greg roman no point im hanging on to him with a long shot to the playoffs
is greg roman stupid
dude greg roman sees some shit work perfectly and then immediately goes away from it completely i get switching it up sprinkling in new plays but to go to the complete opposite route four downs the drive after is not fucking working clearly
put your mask on you loser
ngakoue is good yall
just get a field goal without turning the ball over please for the love of god
please tell me they changed lamars cleats by now
new cleats mvp
now i can go poop in peace at halftime
even the commentators dragging hollywood rip
announcer burn on hollywood was high key funny af
lamar has completed more passes to himself than to receivers
lamar has better hands than soulja change my mind
remember people saying its lamars fault our offense is worse than last year lamar is our offense
get this man a fucking reciever
did chuck think that goalpost was earl
lets make this 2814 make them abandon the run
ghirardelli chocolate peppermint bark is my favorite christmas candy i am hooked on them but they are expensive
we get the ball at the half this game is ours to control if we want it glad to see jk getting bulk carries
damn t announcers are roasting roman too i love them
everyone buy a token and hop aboard thme gus bus

a pick six would be so massive or a fumble six
marlon humphrey should never blitz the qb
missed challenge harbs
defense is suspect just keep scoring run and score run and score
lamar jackson i am once again asking you to put up more points
should have been a td
put bowser at wr instead of brown
ive said it once and ill say it again fuck baker mayfield and his stupid commercials
did you guys know harbs was a special teams coach
cue the john harbaugh came up in the nfl as a special teams guy
80 yard field goal coming up next belee dat
extend bowser and wolfe rn
why do announcers have an obsession with harbs and his special teams background
ngl this game feels so long like we should be halfway done with the 4th quarter by now
yannick
baker wants a flag on every goddamn play
baker is such a bitch
this thread i am once again asking for the defense to make a stop
holy shit why didnt harbaugh call a timeout
espn loving this time out commercials 1 play ends of quarter more commercials
so many commercials
lamar had to poop
hes takin a shit
lamar taking this browns joke seriously
4th down and its automstic
bruh slipped in coverage all you hating fucks need to go
browns literally get every fucking bounce i swear to god
ive been defending hollywood this season but that was fucking bullshit
actually release him not an overreaction he is a net negative
ill never understand why the ravens drafted marquis brown in the first round imagine drafting dk or aj brown instead
im sick of hollywood at this point
i never want to hear a word out of wood again
mcsorley put it directly where he needed to and brown drops it of fucking course
damn i hope lamar comes back out
marquis brown is gone after this season 100 dude is ass
brown confidence is absolutely smashed right now its gone he needs to be benched
this is the part where we give up a long trick play
this doesnt feel real lol our luck is insane its like rolling snake eyes 30 times in a row or something
this is tennessee all over again
undersized
weak
cant get open
cant catch
wont shut the fuck up and play

cut this fucking moron tonight
honestly ive never been more fed up w a player than i am w hollywood
how much do you think eric can get for hollywood in the offseason

so mad right now
mcsorely made the throw and brown drops it im still stuck on this
duvernay and proche time need guys to catch the ball that drop could cost us the game
hollywood brown is why we might lose
remember when 34 points vs the browns wasnt enough me neither
so was anyone in the endzone going to even attempt to tackle baker or nah
classic ravens meltdown
fuck marquise brown and his weak ass hands
this team just has losing dna its coping szn
simply get into position for tucker
this turf is actually some shit no excuses but this many injuries is a bad look for the grounds crew
given the situation lamars entrance looked like a scene out of a movie
yoo win or lose i fuckin love lamar dude is soo freakin amazing
i never wanna hear the lamar slander ever again
didnt we have 2 14 point leads
if this game happened in a movie people would call it fake
fuck the browns hahahhahaha
what a rollercoaster of emotions that game was
i have no words except tucker is the goat
what a game from baker hes been getting a lot of hate but he played very well tonight browns are solid i cant believe im saying those words
you guys get so negative when anything bad happens its hilarious lmao
cant wait for everyone to shit on lamar cause its his fault the defense chokes all the time and the receivers dont do shit so sick of this bullshit fuck this season man
fuck this defense praise lamar tucker is my daddy
im so not ready for this
heart racing already lol
lets go and get this dub big truzz woo woo
just remembered ravens winning could fuck with a lot of the playoff contending teams tonight dolphins raiders colts browns
please football gods make this game like the last seasons ravens rams game

ill offer you my first born in your honors amen
im not worried just need to make adjustments to their short passing attack
just fuck that facemask though right
we got a call boys
i was 100 expecting that to be offensive holding
i miss boyle
what the hell is with the field thats 4 slips for lamar
way to fucking respond ravens
eazy money
yoooo that reminds me of that 4th down play against seattle last year
roman letting lamar be himself
ben powers with a great block
lamar was weaving through the whole team
lamar ran it in idk why people are saying mandrews lol
fuck whoever made that antihealthcare ad
the refs are straight up gonna fuck this entire game theyve already shown it fuck them
these refs are fucking terrible
ravens vs browns with browns refs
im not one to blame the refs but that was two goddamn awful calls what the hell
the league wants the browns to be a story sooooo fucking bad
refs want to take over the fucking game
guys remember the browns have been the laughing stock of sports for the last 20 years
ravens fucked by refs

water is wet
the flags are concerning af
already 4 beers in cant handle stressful games like this
ball dont lie bitch
lol fuck this offense can we donate greg roman to spacex maybe they can put him on a rocket to the fucking sun
that is the textbook definition of roughing the passer if the judon hit was roughing
greg roman you twat run the ball
is greg roman the antikubiak
greg roman has zero clue how to run an offense
ill be extremely disappointed if roman isnt fired this off season regardless of what happens hes seriously holding this team back with his shit play calling
ease off greg roman he is busy running to foot locker to get lamar a new pair of sketchers
i despise how that first play wasnt a run since guss hole was wide open
browns couldnt stop lamar the first drive

roman watch me fuck that up real quick
greg roman is a cancer and needs to be fucking removed
my ptsd is going off wince every whistle blow expecting 15 free yards
marlon makes me rock hard
lamar should hit someone in the head with a blunt force object so he can be the man of the year next year
fuck the browns but i hate injuries
ooooo ahhhh baaaaabyyyy i got popeyes
did they cover everything in oil for this game its a literal slip n slide
that hug like a proud father harbaugh
yyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyeah
coach really just call timeout to tell lamar he loves him
make lamar and harbaugh hug the new side pic guys
its really easy greg roman run the ball and if you want to pass set up the run first
the gus bus is worth more than the browns franchise
see that roman run the ball gotta love to see it
run every play every play until they show that they can stop it
lamar hugging harbaugh lol so special
hey wink if the announcers are calling out your zone coverage you need to change your zone coverage
why the fuck cant our oc come up with plays like that
elliott is a liability in coverage
keep these fuckers out of the end zone make them miss another fg
like the announcers said we need to be playing straight man until they beat it
stop playing fucking zone martindale its clearly not working come on
we need to start actually getting sacks never finishing is killer
willis just had a dirty hit to the back of lj fort
did he even get touched fuck

x200b

lets go offense put some points up before half
if the offense is good the defense stinks if the defense is good the offense stinks
roman is a fucking moron
roman is a fucking coward man what the fuck
give lamar new cleats please

hes slipping constantly tn this game is a must win and hes gonna get hurt if he keeps sliding just change the damn shoes
baker cryfield
we can all agree these refs are ass
get 3 lets not settle lets go get 7 plus another 7 after halftime
pickles on pizza blegh do people actually get that from papa johns
lamars cleats gonna have a tik tok account by the end of the night
believe in him and hell take you there
that perfect ricochet off the wall and hands catch makes up for the failed dunk attempt earlier
even the announcers are throwing shade at marquise lol
the announcers flaming hollywood lmfao
my goodness lamar that incalculablymajestic play to keep our series alive and passing it to mark andrews wow
bruh these announcers just murder bollywood live on my television screen
bills fans gotta get the browns nuts out of their mouths the number of lake eerie bros posts in rnfl is really annoying
bench hollywood for proche or duvernay
lamar jackson is the black lamar jackson
clark wtf are you doing bro
i ship chuck and the goal post
the goal post 1 chuck clark 0
mayfield has a way bigger arm than i thought
booger is better in studio in small samples seems to be more relaxed
why doesnt chuck clark the much bigger man simply not just eat the goal post
we need to keep our foot on the gas pound edwards and dobbins right up their ass
why you gonna have hands if you dont use them neva
finally hangs onto one lmaoooo
look at dem fresh cleats
is it the shoes
browns fans that were giving excuses for baker not putting up pass yards because they were winning games are going to have a hard time explaining how lamar is bad for not throwing for many yards
football is fun again
almost as if were designed to be a run first team

huh

wild
i am not a big roman fan but i must say using gus the bus and dobbins over ingram is the right adjustment obviously
pick six plz
we have scored 28 points despite not having any passing game whatsoever
am i the only one who finds the burger king commercials with the king appearing out of nowhere with tons of people extremely weird
its funny how lamar killed them through the air week 1 and on the ground week 14
society when mark ingram doesnt stifle the ravens run game
all that money in this defence and they cant do anything
i thought he stepped out
he only got 1 foot in
these refs fucking suck
resod the field better next time baker
parkey with the reverse justin tucker
kareem hunt is a piece of shit
nice lil momentum killer from the oline right on cue wtf
new mnf record for qb rushing not done yet
fuuuuuck that pocket movement arm actions legs all so beautiful and he just pushed it
thats a throw he has to make
lamar with trash accuracy two plays in a row
lamar is playing well but ive said it before this type of passing needs to be fixed come playoffs thats 7 points that we left on the field
feeling a quick threenout come on defense
that snead pass was a tough throw to make but not the andrews hes gotta hit that fuck lamar is just a little too fired up right now
did you guys know that john harbaugh was a special teams coach 40 years ago
harbaugh used to coach special teams i had no idea
lamar slander 5 min break
for anyone playing ravens bingo please check off did you know harbaugh coach special team
finger to the butthole 5 yards penalty
man hasnt shown up on the stats sheeet much but yannick has been a force
baker bitches for a flag every play jesus
4th and 4 and everyone is playing 15 yards deep lol
can we fucking hit baker please this aint 2 hand touch
wr put his arm on db actually lmao
are they seriously going to point for a flag on every fucking play
what the fuck refs i playcalled a flag baker mayfield
this game is mentally exhausting
i just want this game to be over
baker is such a whiny bitch
4s up babys games not over until the clock hits 0
hmmm challenging for 12 people but there were in fact 15 checkmate browns
gotta take a dump
lamar had to take a shit
i hope this poop was worth it
lamar taking a poopoo shitpoopster
wow another 4th down conversion with ease pathetic defense
thats not on elliott wasnt even his guy
unbelievable holding no call on browns ol on that td
they are getting so lucky tonight its disgusting meanwhile were doing everything possible to fuck ourselves just like all season
i am flabbergasted at just how lucky the browns have gotten to tonight for this game to be this close and now they get to play against mcsorley instead of lamar in crunch time this season is like some kind of monkeys paw shit for us
brown you are a fucking bum fuck off
get the fuck off this team soulja
mcsorely out here doing what he is paid for and soulja being his regular self
it makes me sick watching all these great rookie and second year receivers just killing it and then seeing hollywood attempt to secure a catch
its time to bench the soulja for duv
before this game i still had hope for marquise not anymore
marquise brown blame of the game
we desperately need a dependable number one receiver hollywood aint it chief
we have a 6 pt lead and i have an impending sense of doom
whats the point of having souljas if they cant catch a wide open dime
ravens softer than lamars shit in the 4th qtr
ive seen this i know whats coming i cant fucking deal with this shit
baker has the energy of that dude at the party thats 56 and shit talking constantly after two beers then threatens to call his lawyer dad on you if you touch him
i cant get over thar hollywood drop
lamar get in the fucking game son dude the season is on the line and hes out with cramps what a fucking look
lamar better be on the fucking field man
we literally had this game won man i cant believe we fucking blowing it
fuck marquise im not even kidding we should give up on him hes worse than perriman
we actually got yards from that fumble lol
keep on pounding that rock dont fumble just run the clock and get the goat kicker in position
this is like a movie
what the fuck is going on
by gawd here comes lamar jackson
the way that went to commercial with lamar coming back reminded me of wwe raw
bah gawd thats lamar jacksons music
lamar really sits out almost the whole 2nd half and really throws a 40 yard td on his first play back in
im about to get evicted screaming lol
marquise i cursed your name all game and you come in and play captain save a ho


lamar great composure what a devil lets fucking go
not 1 sack not 1 all day asking a lot of the backs
ok

1 run the ball 2 run the ball 3 justin tucker
0 pass rush that is why we suck all year long
if he says thats why you love the nfl one more time
marlon is exhausted hes playing every snap safeties cant cover anyone chuck clark is terrible d line getting no pressure lol what am i watching
fuck lebron now hes a browns fan again
341 passing yards fuck this fucking defense
as long as joe buck isnt announcing im not worried about tuck
lamar is so great man
immediately pops a xanax
the way the defense played i wouldnt be surprised if the browns scored that last play
give me all your tears browns fans
talk about overcoming adversity first its a road game then cleats issue then hollywood dropping 3 then the d got caught sleeping lamar leaving the game to poop mcsorley getting hurt lamar coming back to set up tucker for a 55yarder what a game

edit bowser with a clutch int to overturn the browns momentum
shit on lamar all you want but this team revolves around him do not forget that
when the world needed him most he vanished
all browns fans look like thumbs
whats funny is the refs let us get away with having 15 guys on the field
they challenged that we had 12 men on the field they were wrong should have stood
this lost is on marquise
gonna get high af for this one
fuck the god damned fucking browns
man im not digging all this pregame bakerganda
honestly since the pandemic game day hasnt felt the same but tonight im getting the butterflies that i used to get in years before

or it could just be my covid
lets dominate tonight i want the ravens to make a statement peak these last 4 games and just be some dawgs like the old ravens
early note to the inevitable fire harbs posts that we will see after every single incompletion

we got some key players out

we got some players who techincally are out of covid protocol but are still physically worn out from it

you dont really fire a hc over injuries and illnesses so just calm down
everyone is talking about the browns pass game and im sitting here worried about the run were kinda porous
if anyone wants to judge browns fans im at my girlfriends house and her whole family is browns fans and theyve chosen the bachelorette over the game so im downstairs watching it lol
why can this team never defend screens
what a fucking lucky drive two fumbles blatant missed facemask
if those fumbles bounce our way its a different game
did baker just sniff the same fingers he holds up under his centers taint
time for lamar to ball out
that was a cool animation
holy crap we got a call
upside cant have a bad snap if you dont snap the ball
he didnt slip hes just slippery
good drive now get him some cleats
lamartimore ravens
lfg looking like a idiot cheering in the break room but who cares
look at all those fans in the stadium
can we get a gofundme real quick to buy lamar some cleats
lamar jackson now has more td runs than jared goff
lollamar didnt want that fine so he didnt dunk the ball through the goal posts
that was a 2018 ravens drive
heading into commercial

announcers after successful conversion hey dont forget tucker missed one last week well be right back
i like to imagine joe flacco and torrey smith as force ghost looking down on the hollywood dpi with a smile
that was a clean fucking sack eat shit ref
refs are traaaaaash
truly and i mean truly fuck these fucking refs
refs hate the ravens its not a conspiracy
jesus what the fuck refs holy shit
so minkah can kill sneed to play for the ball but jimmy cant bump them in the same situation fuck off
lamar should spend the whole next series throwing the ball at the refs nuts like longest yard
wasnt looking was that chuck or jimmy that ate that massive block like a champ selfless awesome team play there

lol a flag cant make a ball go through the uprights
hahahaha go fuck yourselves browns you deserve nothing on a handicapped drive from the refs
hahaha given all those yards and still come out with nothing
ffs get some cleats on that man
those two dudes yelling in each others face is exactly why you dont have fans in the stands
why dont we run the ball not on 3rd and long just in general and someone change lamars fucking shoes
lamar is changing cleats i guarantee it
that was some ugly ass offense shit
roman seriously has to go
lamar out there playin in church shoes
our defense going to be gassed
run the ball roman

jfc i cant wait to get rid of him so someone else is calling the plays
week after week and we still dont know how to line up shits ridiculous
lol 6 pass yards after 2 drives
oh no hands to the face because watching the first quarter i was pretty sure you could just haul guys around by the face mask
what no pi call on marlon cmon refs s
ravens exist



refs illegal existence 20 yards automatic 1st down
thank god mayfield threw that 900 mph
i love proche if only the ravens had a competent passing scheme so he could get involved
did you know john harbaugh used to be a special teams coach
legit question can lamar just be like nah fuck that roman we running it

because he should
this field is trash just like cleveland
its like a fucking slip and slide out there someone could get really hurt today judging by the amount of slips
call me crazy but that extra time off for lamar from testing positive with covid seems to have really gotten him healthy
that was a big boi dive
oh so we going for 400 rushing tonight
hollywood noped out of the way glad our 1 is there to block
browns fans in their sub begging for a holding call on that runhavent the refs done enough for you guys
lamar haters are so sad that he continues to succeed in running an offense

i would hate to spend that much energy on hating a nice dude just because he isnt aaron rodgers or pat mahomes in the pocket
wow both defense and offense woke up
dawg let our run game open up our pass game thats us thats lamar we put the pressure on them first with the run then the game will open up for us

we got an absolute steal in the 2nd round with jk a fucking tank with gus literally one of the best natural runners with the football ever in lamar not just speed his feel and cuts and direction

we got a bottom rated receiving corp establish our advantages first please the rest will come
first time theyve met when both teams have winning records you mean the first time browns have had a winning record
gus and dobbins are super effective image that fuck this isnt rocket science
im literally waiting for a flag every play now ptsd shit
we look terrible against these deep passes
offense wakes up defense goes to sleep
bro i want a center fielder stop using elliott close to the line we never have deep coverage
man on man or riot
their oc is schemeing a hell of a passing game right now playing our zones perfectly
our safeties are fucking wack
elliot has no play recognition skills
this defense quite isnt worth the resources put into it i think we just consistently hit diminishing returns with our very lopsided picksdollars titled towards that side
kangarootacos824 i would like to take a second to say whoever reported me and got me banned on my other account is a piece of shit and can get fucked




we dont care
fuck this field and the city of cleveland
okay but we run on 2nd and 21 sure sure
is our equipment manager in the covid list wtf is going on
fire roman fire roman fire roman
running the ball with ease and we fucking pass on first down i hate roman so much what a worthless clown fire his ass at half time
drives like this are repeated points why we need to make changes in the coaching
fucking throwing on 1st down then run on 3rd and 19 what
we have over 100 rushing yards in two drives so lets fucking pass the ball roman you absolute idiot
monsoon game covid game slippery game what a season
this team is going nowhere with roman he has to go
yannick is the king at almost sacking the qb
cleatgate breaking news baker mayfield implicated for intentionally soaking playing surface


fuck you baker go make some more dumb ass commercials
yannick getting so close every play lol
baker should use some of that hulu money to see an orthodontist
clearly grounding baker doesnt even know the damn rules

i know some people are saying the throw was messed up by the defender but even if that happens the ball has to get out of bounds plus looking at replay i dont think you can 100 say that it was influenced
this is were roman should be judged this drive
did we change his cleats
lamar literally carrying this sorryass offense
lessons from the td play lamar can run throw catch and kick
even the announcers are clowing on hollywood
lol even these guys are shitting on brown
new cleats
its remarkable how we keep drafting the wrong receivers man
hollywood needs to play the slot or get 6 taller
all that for a yard
lmfao clark i love you
besides the underthrown ball to hollywood earlier which still resulted in a dpi so im not really gonna hold it against him and falling down which really isnt even his fault lamar has been on fucking point today

second half is gonna be a massacre watch
chuck clark playing like a raven against the goalpost
the eagles qb situation is really interestingtricky really seems like a pretty big schism is developing in that locker room jalens in a tough spot cause hes got to be a dog to win everyone over seems like he has less breathing room than a rookie qb usually would
ok we have a real opportunity here if we come out throwing the damn ball instead of running it down their throat ill stop being so nice
run it up fuck it up
did boomer just say the bears shat on the texans lmao
prayers for souljia
our ball first boys lets move the rock and put some points up
shoutout to gro for barely using ingram
lamar is taking matters into his own hands
harbaugh 100 said something to roman
lamar looks like he has having so much fun i fucking love it
what a difference not wasting carries on ingram
cant stop the
easy money
the 2018 lamar and gus duo is back tonight
defense needs to crush their will right here
he did not catch that
going to need to put up at least 42 at this rate
defense is ass unacceptable considering the money spent
roman

dont stop running it
is there anybody on the browns roster who doesnt have an incident which led them to believe one incident doesnt define who i am
what a pass from lamar fucking jackson the quarter back for the baltimore ravens
wtf the ravens threw to the sticks
can we have one fucking game where this offensive line doesnt fuck us
our offense would be collapsing if lamar didnt have mandrews
cant win a superbowl let alone a playoff game if you miss your wide open te for a td with a perfect pocket
that needs to be a td come on lamar
looks like well just have to pick off baker mayfield to get those points
holy shit i love baker lmfao
is that end zone my girlfriends cousin

cause jk dobbins got in so easy
please let judon go pay tyus and yannick instead
hey guys did you know that john harbaugh was a special teams coach i legit never knew but thanks to all the commentators who remind me
yall know harbs was a special teams coach i had no idea
guys did you know harbaugh was a special teams coach
ahh there comes the weekly harbaugh st coach comment


also yall remember will hill kick 6
bowser has been the bright light of this season he will cash in the contract judon was supposed to cash
john harbaugh is a special teams coach
how the hell are we not in the 4th quarter yet
need 4 yards here lets play 20 yards off
i dont understand playing zone like that on fourth at four
u can challenge that
really though harbs shoulda called time on 4th and 4
you know they could show us the fucking replay instead of immediately an ad for car insurance
the lack of discipline is a killer its been a problem all damn season and they havent even pretended to improve it
15 on the field jesus christ
til you can can challenge for 12 men on the field ive never seen that before
lmao we had the whole fucking team on the field
lamar taking a massive dump
he pooping relax
did lamar just leave to go take a shit
if lamar had to take a shit he better pinch it and get back out there
lamar glad we wore the purple pants instead of allwhote
chill lamar just going for two
maybe lamar missed those throws because he was a holding in a fat shit
lamar shit on the browns so much he had to shit fr
defense just cant step up in big moments plus the terrible holds
god i hate this team sometimes
honestly if im playing the ravens im going for it on fourth down everytime like a 10 year old on madden wtf man
this field really is trash how is there not some consistency in the fields throughout the league
fuck me even the shit passes go their ways
this next drive has 3 and out written all over it
our luck is ridiculous this year
yall memed this into existence
marquise are you fucking kidding me
i wish i could get paid millions to drop balls
hollywood brown can get fucked
okill join cut holllywood
hollywoods got lamars shoes on his hands
removed

hollywood should never touch the field again
we are seriously going to blow it come the fuck on
chris moorehollywood
im so fucking beyond tired of brown seriously hope we let him go
so typical 4th quarter collapse fuck me
browns ol holding again
anyone else see a missed holding
so theyre just going to never call holding anymore
removed
ray lewis must be sick to his stomach watching these linebackers get blown off the ball so easily
dont get how we keep blowing solid leads whole organization is sketchy
i still cant get over the dropped pass
judon 10 yards behind baker
highest paid defense in the nfl and we cant get a stop when our season depends on it
defense is paid way too much to not get stops this loss is going to be on them we were up 3420
i hate hollywood and i hate our defense fucking sold this game
get marquise brown off the fucking field
lamar we need you
bah gawd thats lamar jacksons music
man what the fuck is even happening hahaha this game is just insane at this point
bah gawd thats lamar jacksons music
lamar is done with his shit and romans shit
i never want to hear lamar hate again dude is an absolute difference maker
regardless of the outcome fuck the browns this was a damn good game did i mention fuck the browns
no faith in this defense what so ever theyll give up another td if they see the field again
manifesting a justin tucker game winner
what the fuck happened to this defense wasnt this bad in the 1st half of the season the offense lost key figures but the d
what an absolute pathetic defensive showing
please dont make me watch ot
get the game winning field goal please ravens
why did we waste a timeout
this is on wink
oh now he can kick
dean peas flashbacks
justin tucker will win us this game
anyone remember that snow game against minnesota a couple years ago thats this game exactly
tuckerevery other kicker in history
michael jordan flu game meet lamar jackson diarrhea game
holy shit that was one of the greatest games i have ever seen
no matter what you say about lamar this man cares
tucker is the best athlete at his position in any sport dont me
best game of the season any team any game
love that crying grown man browns fan in the stadium all by himself
even goats poop
i dont know why i worry so much we have tuck
just wow
feels good to be the king of ohio
griese on svp sounds legitimately sad for the browns
to all yall who were defending hollywood last week downvoting my shit fuck yall
baker gets up and literally looks around for a flag to save him
3rd and 19 lets run the ball tf
lamar is so invaluable just blows my mind he is criticized as a passer so heavily
making that pass is the difference between great and elite
if elliott just makes that sack its 4th and 10 but nah
what do people do when theres only an hour left before game time too much time to start something new but not enough time to wait around doing nothing
this game could really go a million different ways lol im nervous as fuck
hennessy poured bong packed lets fucking go
im exited and nervous idk how many beers i can drink before the jitters go away
browns is such a shitty name for a sports team
i wanna see mark andrews pop the fuck off hes got some pretty good stats against the browns

in three career wins over the browns andrews has at least 50 yards receiving in every game and totaled 15 catches for 205 yards and four touchdowns that breaks out to five catches for 683 yards and 13 touchdowns per game
fuck the steelers fuck the browns and fuck covid in no particular order
kevin stefanski is just freddie kitchens with an easier schedule
calais dont be injured plz
fuck the browns lets win this fucking game

greg romans job should be on the line here btw also yannicks extension and judon getting resigned
fuck the browns
time to load up a bowl and settle in

huge game for lamar time to be an mvp

huge game for roman gotta put those receivers in position to succeed

huge game for the d cleveland smacked tennessee theyre obviously capable gotta shut that shit down
i just a tweet that we have all our week 1 defensive starters back yannick perfect fucking timing
im more nervous for this game than i was for both of my law school exams last weekend
i feel like im going to vomit
i really hope we go out and fucking stomp them just because im already sick of all this browns are good theyre gonna make the playoffs

like i dont disagree but man am i sick of hearing about it
please punish these browns harder than the dump i took this morning
wink needs to figure out how not to scheme his defense to be weak to the screen its clockwork

chiefs pittsburgh titans

the good teams have him figured out early
how was that not face mask
facemask
did defense get the memo that this is a win or go home game
lamar about to giveem moves left and right
guys dont panic the game just started lets get the ball and drive and score and hopefully the defense will follow on that momentum no need to lose hope yet
lots of time to right the ship those fumbles are bound to go our way at some point
roman with a god damn flea flicker first play dumbass
whoa not expecting a defensive holding there
holy fuck i ended that play saying of course its fucking holding
ravens stupid penalties 33
if lamar wasnt a freak scrambler our qb would end up dead on that field
lamar needs to change his shoes like in the seattle game
jackson just picked his way through that line absolutely incredible
l freaky
thats our llama
lamar is so good
fuck the browns come on ravens
leettss goooo foot on their necks dick in they ass
if burger king employees surround my car singing im going to jail
just got off work saw the dobbins give and lamar score lets fucking go
i love how when the browns score everyone here thinks we already lost but when we score right back ppl barely say anything positive
mnf graphics never disappoint
so you cant sack the qb
weak ass rtp call i guess the refs still hate judon
weekly fuck the refs
we are the most fucked on team in the league and you cant tell me otherwise
what the fuck is this reffing
have you lost ya mind illlll help ya find it
fuck these refs fuck this defense fuck the browns
roughing the passer needs some serious reconstruction
im now watching plays not to see how we do but to see whether there is a flag
fuck the browns man
if they go for it you gotta think theyre confident to just throw one up and look for a flag
first drive trick plays second drive refs third drive pick six
theres the browns i know bailed out multiple times by the refs and still end up with nothing lol
the fates have spoken those penalties were bullshit
bailed out twice by the refs and still cant convert it into points yikes lmao
hahahahahha fuck the browns
lmao they get bailed out and they missed it
1 play and a commercial
greg roman fucking sucks
uh that browns fan and ravens fan need to stop kissing with their mask on
refs dropping a flag on us there in case we converted
does anyone have spikes they can deliver to lamar
greg roman offensive mastermind
i want greg roman gone this offseason
petition to buy lamar new cleats
chiefs fan again also fuck these refs
stop the game lets see those fans fight
why are we not running wtffff
jackson needs new cleats
lamar needs new cleats
lamar put some longer fucking cleats on mother fucker
that was the greg roman special first down run wouldve picked up 8 and that drive wouldve looked a lot different why does this moron refuse to do what were fucking good at
got to love not using our strength to win run the damn ball
these cleats are going to lose us the game
run the fucking ball you dumb fuck i hate greg roman
someone gif that cleveland fan literally yelling in his friends mouth with his mask down please
fire greg roman
3 passes3 and out fuck you greg roman
i love watching our receivers they run their route and just turn around and wait for lamar to do something cool
imagine at this point still not thinking greg roman is a problem
this offensive line is a joke greg roman is a joke
if we miss the playoffs or go out early in the playoffs i really hope roman is fired
lamar needs to start saying fu roman and audible into some runs
refball strikes again
whenever i see a flag i just expect it to be on us
flags flags everywhere
show us the penalty
christare we going to let the browns just win with penalties
jokes of a ref crew if this league has an ounce of integrity theyre getting written up after this game
illegal use of your hands on each others dicks you fucking refs
hope lamar changes his cleats
nice fake out proche
smart fucking play proche
low key good play by proche
hahaha even the refs couldnt help the girl brownies that series
garrett attempts to murder a man and gets nominated for wpmoy

fuck the browns
poor guy thats his helmet swinging arm
i love lamar and harbs
harbaugh has to run down the fucking field to signal for a time out the refs make everything difficult
lamar is harbs son
llama harbaugh love
awww lamar hugging harbs got me feeling gooey
exact change only
thats 100 a touchdown
the hush of that crowd is beautiful
who needs throwing when you have lamar jk and bus
society has progressed past the need for passing
the best news look at the clock

browns may drive but even if so wed get it back with some time before half and get it to start the 3rd

next few minutes are big
passing at this point is being cute why stop running before the browns prove they can stop it
that pre td hug is a top 5 season moment
why tf are they giving the receivers so kuch space jfc we only up by one
elliot and peters both fucking lost
our run defense looks like we are fielding casper out there at every position
honestly why the fuck did wink switch to a zone defense literally getting torn up
at least ravens fans didnt have to wait 18 years just to be excited for a playoffs appearance
our 4 man pass rush needs about 4 more men
second half adjustments

play man till they consistently beat it

run jk gus and lamar till the wheels fall off
he just slipped twice on the same play

when do we address this
what the fuck is going on with the slipping put other cleats on should have been done the first fucking slip
is there a legitimate reason he hasnt changed shoes too timeconsuming in between drives
blame of the game cleats
please figure out the cleat situation he is running on oil out there
why would you run that why
lamar take my cleats

lamar take my cleats

lamar take my cleats
roman doesnt even let lamar try to throw for a first fuck off
this is definitely his shoes because if its the field everyone would be having problems
can we figure out the cleats lamar or
lamar has looked explosive better cleats and we might be up by a td
do the ravens have a different pair of cleats for lamar

how many times does he need to slip before he and the ravens do something about it
they should not be having issues with fucking cleats they have a bunch of time on the field before the game to get that shit right
im sorry i want roman gone at halftime i hate this mans playcalling
equipment manager in shambles
im feeling like that star wars scene where palpatiine is in his chair laughing and saying good good let the hate run through you to lamar
harbaugh edc fire roman im begging you its literally a sinking ship
if we lose and gr still has a job tomorrow im done
legit disrespect to jimmy smith right there acting like hes some scrub
did he just say to target jimmy smith lol does he not knows jimmy is elite
finally a flag thats not on us
found new cleats for lamar
these refs are ass we smacked his hand down that wasnt intentional
yannick starting to dominate
man this is some classic afc north football right here
yannick gotta start converting those pressures into sacks
they have reviewed this entirely to long
all this over fucking grounding this ref crew sucks
i think baker has a case here he was getting hit but the ball didnt make it to the line and wasnt out of the tackle box the zebras dont care
yannick is bringing some pressure hopefully he can bring it in the second half
were at midfield we better get a fg at least
the my cause my cleats sideline is starting to feel personal
so they changed his cleats i was talking to my wife so i was 100 sure
mark andrews is the real soulja
andrews has arrived
welcome to the game mark andrews
play like a raven
someone take this 80 pound fucking child off the field
bench marquise or at least look to go to other receivers with the ball he doesnt deserve to be wr 1 with all of his drops our tes are money though
activate new cleats llama
lamar lamar jackson jackson

thats all i gotta say
removed
need some new lamar memes
the forward pass was a mistake
these announcers are shit but marquise this is how you catch got a legit belly laugh out of me
everyone shitting on hollywood good
even the commentators are roasting hollywood

134 rushing yards in the first half

unstoppable
chuck bby what is you doing
flag on the play defensive pass interference on clark spot of the foul one yard line first down
spike lee writing a its gotta be the shoes commercial for lamar as we speak
true just frustrating to think how many plays got shut down from lamar slipping and as soon as he changes his cleats that happened
remember espn 2k5 when this was the half time show completely computer generated scenarios with the voice over to match that was over 15 years ago yeah madden is terrible
im loving the hollywood slander from the commentators embarrass the shit out of him until he decides to play up to his own self acclaimed hype
all aboard captain jacksons gus bus
beep beep here comes the bus
this is the playbook greg
new cleats running the rock easy money baby
run it down their throats
i hope we make the playoffs and get the steelers first

fuck those no talent overrated bums
crazy what happens when we play to our strength and run the ball
mvp lamar this is mvp lamar yall
week 2 week 13 the ravens have no identity

week 14 running the ball is who the ravens are
thisiswhyyouruntheball
we will literally run our way to the sb
lamar is fucking back our offense is fucking back we control our destiny man fuck these shit stains
when you realize the best rushing duo in the league wears purple and black and not dog shit brown
which dumbass scheduled steelers bengals for mnf on week 15 is anyone gonna watch that game
the browns sub has given up and called the game i couldnt be more satisfied if i pulled my pants down and it jerked itself
lamar is truly a player like no other
browns shaking their heads on the sideline folks we love to see it
we better not blow this lead
what is this zoom ad
im gonna say itbooger in the booth these clowns
baker rolls out everytime cant we plan for it better
his second foot looked out to me
wtf he was out of bounds
this defense gets paid way too fucking much to play like this man there was no resistance at all man
missed extra point haha tucker would never
cody parkey sucks lmaooooooo
why did the defense just fucking die today wtf
this defense is so anticlutchplay well until it matters most
go to newsmax with that feet in shit levy we are watching him step out
why is the defense and offense never good at the same time
cody billy cundiff parkey
socan we get new shoes for the defense
mr stover is the coolest guy i know him personally so down to earth
that needs to be a td 99100 times
a turnover here would be awfully nice
im glad we got dobby a td
i love tyus most underrated player on this team
theyre going for 2 here

its okay levy we all wanted bowser to get his pick6 there anyways
i dont really believe in jinxes but joe buck and whoever that guy is can go fuck themselves
nooooo my boy tuckers stats nooooooo
most accurate passer in history of the nfl with the tackle
my weekly dopamine comes from checking the browns sub
i cannot believe tyus made that pick most people thats a batted down pass unreal
the rate at which announces every week say something about harbs being special teams makes it feel like im playing madden and hearing the same canned commentary game after game after game

im still waiting 2 see if those numbers terrmuhhhhh imperical or not
ingram might as well be poe at this point
good play ngakoue
whoever said yannick wasnt good is not watching the game he may not be showing up on the stat line but hes shifting their oline and being an overall menace every play
sorry baker you cant get a penalty for everything
someone messed up on that landry conversion looked like elliott and the lb were standing in the same zone so neither were in position to pick him up when peters passed him off
elliots whiff may prove costly
what theyre challenging for a penalty on us
i cant even believe its not the 4th q yet
gah damn 15
im fine with us not calling a timeout on 4th 4 if we man the fuck up

stop this backpedalling zone bullshit wink
these commercials are fucking ridiculous
they are obviously not trusting there kicker any more in this game gonna have to stop them on every down here
i know we all want this shit in the bag but howd you feel 3 hours ago if i told you wed be up 3420 going to the 4th
so heres the game can the defense stop the browns from scoring 2 tds in the 4th quarter can the offense do fucking anything to help out

earlier this season the answer is lol no of course not
is lamar taking a cleveland steamer
lamar not on the field had to take a dump in cleveland just to drop an extra one
i hope hes pooping lol
lamar better wash his hands if hes taking a shit just saying
taking a dump on the browns literally
lamar wishing we went with black pants tonight
let lamar take his mid game poop
lamar taking a dump probable to return
now thats a good to
4th downs
pinch and wipe lamar
4th down and giving up the td name a better duo for us
holding by kareem hunt on queen but no call what a surprise
is lamar done shitting
i hope peters is actually ok and just buying some time for lj
slip like it hasnt been happening all game on this shit fucking field

x200b

get out of here with your negative asses
jesus christ our defense is ass today
this damn defense is killing us
im starting to wonder was et3 that important
theres bad luck and then theres fumbling three times and recovering all three and then getting that 2 pt conversion
you cant tell me lamar didnt just have to shit
how tf am i supposed to sleep after this
alright now im fucking done with 15
ok fuck you brown you can get the fuck off the team now that was fucking inexcusable absolute piece of shit
of fucking course he dropped it
hes got to go i dont care get rid of him cant stand the useless prick
i think thats seriously the one that gets brown benched
marquise brown our biggest bust since perriman dont fucking me
im ready to straightup cut brown so sick of his shit
how the hell was hollywood better last season with one working foot
i cant believe i watched this mans ig stories with the jug machine all offseason just for him to do this to me
proche or duv catch that they offer more than hollywood right now hes toast
baker whines for a flag all the fucking time like old man rivers just stop jesus christ
bro i really hate this season lmao
defence going to lose this game for us yet again crumbling when we least need it team just isnt complete
come on defense get one damn stop today
this seems like the perfect way for this 2020 season to end fuck
am i the only one who thinks boykins and duvernay deserve more reps than brown
maybe our soulja needs to swap out for some different gloves
one thing the ravens are good at is giving their fans blue balls
soft af decosta and bisciotti needs to do some serious work with this team
this defense just has nothing no answers no heart no clue just nothing just wide open walking down the field score is just inevitable
defense is just gassed were basically depending on a cleveland mistake now otherwise this aint going well
this season fucking sucks these games are fucking brutal to watch
wtf chuck clark just standing there next to the receiver lol
lamar got cramps
our defense cant stop shit
kickoff return for a td plz
defense gassed hollywood drop killed us
time to throw it and go 3 and out
it is what it is just gonna have to reload next year i guess
cant think of one clutch stop our defense has made outside the tyus int
snead thank fuck
i vow to never refer to marquise as hollywood again
i love willie snead thats just a straight up tough i want it more than you type catch
greg roman calls a keep with mcsorely seriously cant make this shit up
save us llama
lamar coming back clutch he done with his big ol shit bois
lamar done pooping

let tucker kick the 62 yarder fuck it
damn this is like a drama series
diaper up lamar we need you
ive seen enough sports movies to know how this ends
cum on daddy lamar please penetrate their d
this field is ass
this shit is out of a movie lmao
that is a legendary football moment right there
did we sacrifice mcsorely for this
so let me get this correct lamar jackson returns to the game on an everythingornothing fourth down play and ends up throwing a td pass to marquise my hands are finally awake brown

lol
frantically deletes all previous posts
that was pure shane falco walks out at halftime heroic shit
we cant get a sack on mayfield can we
the way hump just stopped sums up this defence just given up
all this money on the defense and they fucking suck
no heart on the d
pulling for you guys fuck the steelers fuck mayfield

x200b

mfer better shank this
i seriously look back at all the hype we got for those d player trades and all this kinda shit and for what gawdamn nothing to show for it
defense is so bad
just get in the 50 yard tucker zone lamar thats all we need please
kills me we gonna waste those lamar heroics
wasted timeout really hurts here smh
that to feels early but im not a coach for a reason
come on lamar lets go
that play looked dead actually kinda handy
the man

the myth

the legend

the golden pipes

the platinum leg

the best kicker in nfl history

justin motherfucking tucker
my teams kicker has ice in his veins in tucker we trust
top 10 maybe 5 game in ravens history
thats fucking gold 9
im fucking shaking
im emotionally drained my heart cant take this type of punishment
what the refs didnt save there drive
time to hit em with the 3 and out greg roman special
shouldve challenged i think that second foot was out
upvote if youre hella nervous
give this defense some benadryl cause theyre allergic to tackling chubb
damn that was a walk in he hit those last year
is the defense even fucking trying
what why take a shit in a toilet when you can shit on the browns
i just want to say i love all of you guys and fuck the browns
havent been this anxious pregame since the titans playoff game

i have no worries about lamar is everyone else gonna show up for him is the real question
the browns play in a toilet bowl
i wish obj were still playing so the secondary could shut him down yet again
omg guys remember when cleveland lost their team for like 3 years
llama will lead us amen
fuck the browns must win game
no excuses this has to be a w missing the playoffs with what we expected this year cannot happen if they get there they will make a run
holy fuckin shit they just played a buck allen highlight in the pregame show
did yall know cleveland has the rock and roll hall of fame you didnt well now here are 432 rock and roll puns
do they not remember 386
fuck the browns lets bury these bitches
dobby gonna run for 100 today better be the starter
please tell me were prepared for the jarvis qb trick play
need the refs to call any fucking penalty they have every fucking play
please dont let me see a mark ingram 2 yard run up the middle lol
how the fuck is that not an offensive facemask
here comes greg roman trying to be cute and we go 3 n out
a reminder that we receive the least calls in the league but get called for the most penalties
i feel like all i use reddit for is to bitch about refs on game threads but how on earth do they miss that facemask on peters

sidenote i wish our passing playbook was more like stefanskis
i think half of yall expect a shutout every game lmao
here we go greg with this cute shit
lamar is under center
lamar needs to do that more get back in that swing of knowing its ok for you to run dude we know you can pass its ok to get yards running as well
lamar is so good
lamar is my dad
lamar said ill do it myself
lamar came to play
lol lamar blowing a tire on the way to dunk on the crossbar made me lul
the oline wasnt great on that drive but it looked like 2019 lamar
now we need to maintain our level of hoes being stunted on because every play is 11 browns being hoed
thats gotta be the most people ive seen at a stadium this season what the fuck are they doing theres still a pandemic
i love how that drive was exactly the kind thatll make browns fans the maddest a long dpi then a lj touchdown
orlando brown might be playing himself out of a affordable extension from us
that was a clean hit fuck this pussy ass ref
how the fuck was that roughing

is judon supposed to fold his head into his spine or something
need harbaugh to yell at the refs again
on the plus side were getting pressure on baker tonight
lamar having fun again peters talkin shit2019 vibes
that was as soft a call as the refs cowards fuck off
you aint lamar baker lmaooo

they shoved the qb out of bounds thats a penalty right
baker mayfield whirls his arms when hes up looks for flags when hes down biggest fucking bitch in the league
i think the jimmy pi was the right call by the rule book but i think it was pretty weak and shouldnt have been called
humphrey wont make an all pro team or the pro bowl but hes a top 2 cornerback lmao
haha baker has groceries and is locked out haha
judon is doing good but im not seeing any of yall speak about it
ball dont lie
held them to nothing make them pay for that
the ghost of billy cundiff is shining in our favor
somebody iced the kicker lolol
ball dont lie
you dumb bitch
damn imagine having literally any kicker that isnt justin tucker
wombo combo

that aint tucker
now lets go get 7
get this man cleats
this offense i swear to christ
0 runs
stanley pls come back
why we just try to throw all those downs wtf roman
change your cleets
fuck this garbage ass oline too
lamar slippy boi jackson
i forgot about our 12th offensive starter i formation from fiveyard university
seems like the browns strategy is to whine incessantly on every bad play asking for a penalty
fire him
was that reality football play calling
i really dont understand why you throw 3 times with this backup offensive line pass blocking ugh
instead of the screen to snead gus had a big whole for a run i dont know wtf were doing out there
greg roman has a dominant run game no success throwing it so far calls 3 straight pass plays

fire this fucking clown
fuck off lol every damn play is a flag
fuck these god damn refs
motherfuck these refs and motherfuck greg roman
lamar gets 31 yrds running on one drive then we decide to throw 3 times cleveland must love greg roman
cool backstory no thats a fucked up backstory
omg no flag for fucking one
marlon is so good he and jk dobbins are the main reason i love watching this team
browns do something good browns are amazing
ravens do something good browns really had a miscue there
good fake proche lol
smart no catch on that punt
very smart move and fake out by the returner there love that type of smart extra play
wink be carrying so hard roman should give him his weekly paycheck
defense woke up
i got popeyeyeyeyeys
veteran move from proche
can we run the ball please
marlon humphrey is amazing
roman please

i beg you
steve levy is a terrible commentator dude isnt even watching and makes retarded remarks i swear these refs and announcers just want to talk while they have a platform
this jk guy isnt bad huh
cleveland field is trash
this field is utter garbage jesus christ browns
can i get a hell yea for art modell
shocker baker sucks at field maintenance too
jk isnt making as much noise as he deserves because hes running in a comittee this year but he clearly looks like the best rookie back of this class hes 4th in the league in yards per attempt behind only lamar chubb and murray
wow greg look what happens when you actually utilize the backs and lamars legs properly

you get results
maybe 4 passing yards but on pace for like 200 rushing yards see if i care
omg i love that hug
ahhh fuck that was gonna be a td
that hug just shows the respect and love harbaugh and lamar have for each other

ball dont lie helmet beating ass crusty ass field lookin insurance salesman ass bitches
the effort to keep your body off the ground that long is insane mr bus
fuck off its not short
gus bus
bus and dobby 2021 lets go
gus bus has no brakes baby
this is a great example why this team should never truly abandon the run we chunk run plays like other teams chunk pass plays
time for one of these forced fumbles to go our way
big d no little d
the halftime adjustment needs to be to play fucking man coverage this isnt on the defense they were asked to play man all season and now they are expected to make the switch with no issues winks worst called game so far
why does our defense suck so much like i am never confident in third down its like they set us up with the first two bullshit plays and then just throw at will
can we stop playing zone
that was too easy for chubb
thats on lj fort
aside from some bullshit penalties this has been a good game of football
fucking too easy man

its ok tho we got this
so many runs that just go untouched up the middle so much for that investment into the front 7 still looks like the same shit from 2019 playoff game
jarvis landry with a big hold on chuck clark
we gotta answer it plenty of time cant go into the half without another score
lets double dip
get lamar new cleats at the half please
can baker slip for us at least once
cleveland had their sprinklers on all day they know its hard for a qb to scramble on a wet field
its always something new with this fucking team man
change those fucking cleats at halftime
runs on 2nd and 21 should be a fire able offense here
fire the equipment manager
we need a passing oc to take us to the next level idc running is cool but you cant win a sb this one dimensional
is there a rule against changing your cleats in the middle of a game or something how is nobody doing it
i hate greg roman
2nd and 21 and we basically give up
this play calling is garbage cleats or no cleats
someones getting fired for choice of cleats lol
ohio even the grass fucking sucks
its 1414 our qb has thrown the ball for 14 yards im gonna drink
the browns prioritized their offensive line this offseason and we didnt you can see the difference in the records and the passing metrics
wtf why not change cleats how many more times will lamar slip and slide
fire greg roman
browns have an elf under the field rubbing oil on lamars cleats
cleatgate
gro is looking for a new job tomorrow right
i know our wrs suck but man do i hate romans fucking scheming so much

even with bad wrs he should still be able to scheme them open at least once in a while

but no every damn play theyre all fucking blanketed and lamar has to run for his life and be called a running back because nobody can fucking get open

fuck greg roman sincerely
whyyyyyyyyyyyy did he not change studscleats after those first two slips that makes zero sense how did no one on the bench make him change also running it on 2nd and 21 and 3rd and 19 nice
lol jimmy is one of the top rated corners this season sure attack him
wow a flag that wasnt on us
wait they are allowed to throw the yellow things against cleveland
whats with not showing penalty replays
get fucked huge yardage loss on those two flags
jimmy smith is a 1 corner on a lot of teams
eat a bag of dicks baker
these commentators are so annoying even when the browns do something shitty they flip into a positive when did the tv start to suck on their dicks so much
gotta get at least a fg
cmon lets get a score here with 69 seconds left nice btw
early nominee for blame of the game

this guy

i cant be the only that doesnt like mayfield
soulja has left the chat
big dick lamar
lamar cant throw

stfu that play was incredible
i swear we get big plays when its unscripted fuck you greg
ill do it myselflamar
lamar single handedly carrying this offense tonight
low key that throw to the wall and catch drop kick was dope celebration
when lamar has a rough drive later in the game i want yall haters here to remember he is nearly 100 responsible for 14 of our points
we get ball back after halftime right
mark andrews isnt a security blanket hes the only motherfucker wholl actually fucking catch the ball
brown is a fucking bum catch first then run ti twitter with your butter hands mf
give my man a receiver he needs help
lamar might have 200 yards rushing already if he started in these cleats lololol
this pressure has to turn into at least one sack right
jesus another completion by mayfield to the browns grass can someone please cover the grass
we need a new qb
this pass rush is the best ive seen in a while from the ravens i love it
big play by marcus to keep him in bounds
just like our season chuck clark knows to well only person who could hurt us is ourselves
i thought chuck was our smartest player lol
clark

bruh
lamars rushing stats looking real good
dear espn please get your stream fixed and more reliable

wait i mean disney invest some of that money into your sports streams
run the rock
pound the fucking rock opening drive
run the ball

change the cleats

rack up points

you are here

get cute with stunt passes and go three and out for a whole quarter

toss int

lose
word to the wise watch the game with the sound off when its espn the absolute worst
dem coke whites doe good shit bout to happen
marquis brown finally hangs onto one

oh man he is wrecked
lol marquise brown finally holds onto one even the announcers are taking a dig at him
gus please hit me more
most electric runner in the game by farhe is like gale sayers
mcsorely fans will have to wait even longer now boo hooooo
usually you run to take time off the clock but that works too
lamar put this shit on your back
woooooooooooooo lamars loose
thank you god in nfl heaven for lamars new cleats
honestly lets not even throw a single pass for the rest of the game
time to force mayfield into mistakes now lets fucking go
and i feel god in this chilis tonight
ez walk in
gus
honk honk motherfuckers
does anyone here have any actual proof that cleveland is even a real place
hey roman see how pounding the rock actually works you fucking dipshit
gus edwards with the shake
double decker gus bus bb
love watching the browns forum on reddit collapse drink their tears my friends drink them
we up 2 scores now lets fucking gooooo
cleveland was the 6th rushing defense before this week did they actually face any real rushing teams week 1 doesnt count since lamar went nuclear on the air
we seeing last season lamar again
the last cut lamar made on that long run was next level he isnt looking at the guy who is barely in his field of vision but he somehow knows he is there jukes him and picks up another 10 yards
ground n poundf these bitches
fucking stomp on their throats
i love lamar the fucking wheels he has is just ridiculous
if we run 80 of the time we will never lose
baker completes 80 of his passes on bootleg dump offs
media was hyping tf outta this browns team
id love to see yannick get a t sizzle strip sack
well shit we cant just let them go down and score a touchdown
madboogie looks like a future star
challenge
hate how they didnt challenge that he was out of bounds
heylamar can you maybe do us another favor working short again tonight and could use some help
commentators trying to gaslight us into thinking he was in bounds nah
defense folded like a fucking lawn chair come on guys
3 rushing tds they just ran down our fucking throats i fucking hate this soft ass defense bunch of wankers
why the fuck didnt we challenge that
the ghost of billy cundiff has blessed us yet again praise be
it was one foot in man how you not challange that
well this is unlike the rest of the season defense is playing weak as hell

lamar needs to step up again like he has been this game

was hunt out am i going insane
defense is just giving them what they want want one of the best receiving rbs one on one with a slow lb no problem there you go
has our defense responded to a lead with a stop at all this season
just so everyone knows defense isnt spelled spelled defence despite the sign at the stadium
i hate how queen doesnt play aggressive in college if there was a hole he would launch himself right through it now he waits and misses a tackle or is out of position
kareem hunt the woman beater
dudes a scumbag and so is tyreek hill both woman beaters
boykin brown

change my mind
mandrews catches in triple coverage but drops when hes open guy is an enigma
hollywood plays like he doesnt give a shit
commentators so salty everytime lamar hits a throw
how the fuck does a center false start the hell
fuck it andrews is down there somewhere
fuck he was open too
that right there is where he needs to improve i have faith that he will but man we needed one of those
that wide open miss is why we cant beat elite teams in the playoffs hes regressed as a passer im sorry
lamar needs to go see a qb specialist this off season missing passes like that dont earn you 150m contracts
lets fucking go king koopa
bowser getting all of judons money this offseason
koch with the tackle
here it goes harbaugh the st coach
tyus bowser is a beast
the classic ravens defensive draftee doing nothing til their contract year
it feels reactionary now to post this because we didnt even get the extra point but i said we should go for 2 before we even tried the kick try to make it a 16 point game make them get 2 two poing conversions then again if you make the kick they still have to make 1 two point conversion i dunno sucks about the block though ugh
a blocked extra point

this game is ridiculous
still 6 more points on the board its all good fellas
harbs always have these guys prepared at the right time and ppl still want to fire him lol
very nice edge set yannick
davante harris kind a looks like ladarius webb
4th and 4 and were 15 yards off the ball
baker loves fucking whining for calls
4th and 4 and far off coverage i dont get some of these shit defensive calls
were allergic to sacks
lmfao browns desperate as fuck

going for it on 4th medium from their own side of the field going for surprise hail maries and challenging the number of men on the field

im gonna laugh so fucking hard if we get a turnover
john needs to call a to there if the defense cant get off the field
how do you not call a timeout for your d on 4th and 4
15 you gotta be kidding me
we are shooting ourselves in the foot in so many ways on defense
we cant let them on 4th downs like that
drink every time someone says we shot ourselves in the foot
wish we had that extra point
im just glad the political commercials are gone i live in georgia and oh my god
lamar had to take a shit
lamars gonna come back on the field lighter and faster
4th down



time to play 10 yards off and give it up again
lamar about to come back from that shit a lil bit faster
man wtf is this defense doing
is lamar shitting or is it the defense
get off the field peters every big play you make there is another big mistake
if peters is down this d is fucked
i hope peters is ok we kind of need him even if he has his foibles
knew 100 as soon as he threw there would be someone wide fucking open how is this defense so bad on 4th
a raven was clearly held and peters got hurt this one is not really on the d
good god theres some sensationalist people in here
only the ravens are this unlucky
these commentators want the browns to win so bad
defense is going to lose us this game for sure
ok now im scared
this is fucked turns out you cant run your qb for 1000 yards
lamar got them covid shits
dont worry trace mcsorley will throw it on a dime
took a big ol dookie
lamar hurt peters hurt jimmy smith hurt nice
meme aside we aint winning this shit with trace lmao
hollywood why why why why why
come the fuck on hollywood
fuck you soulja
like cramps how much luckier can the browns get
marquise brown is complete garbage
thats it i am so effing done with hollywood
trace doesnt deserve this
missing hollywood browns hands
hollywood is a fucking piece of shit seriously he can go fuck himself what a god damn moron
fuck you marquise
whats the point of having soldiers if they drop the fuckin ball every time its thrown in their direction
fucking hollywood you aint no soulja
fuck brown hes absolute garbage drops 247
fucking cut marquise absolute bust
bust
souljahs aint no use if they cant catch the ball
camp fucking body get him the fuck off this roster
bench him dead ass serious idc if we dont have any other receivers bench him
fuck you hollywood
hollywood just might have cost us the game
id rather perriman over brown
bench marquise i dont fucking understand why are we targetting him
what is brown doing dropping all these unbelievable
holy fuck hollywood
this fo needs to say fuck it and sign whichever elite wr hits the market or trade for one because we cant draft wrs for fucking shit
yo fuck this dude bench him put him on the practice squad humble his ass this shit is fucking inexcusable
trace put a perfect fucking ball in your hands and you drop it fuck you brown
im over hollywood embarrassing performance

stay the fuck off twitter stop whining about your usage and do your job better
the brown hype train has been robbed derailed and blown up lol
couldve had dk or aj brown but nope we got this soulja
baker is such a fucking crybaby
i hate marquise i hate him so much
does anyone know if when we drafted marquise if hands were included in the deal or where they extra
if someone can find a play where baker didnt ask for a flag ill give you 100
i dont like this its like they are giving up
i hope brown gets fucking torched on twitter for his big ass mouth bum ass mf
lamar must have the runs god damn boy
34 points not enough to win against the browns 2020 ravens football
soulja boy drop em
lamar had to shit
the entire offensive coaching staff needs to be leveled this offseason we need to develop receivers and the passing game more and this staff obviously cant do it
just once just one fucking time id like to lose a game where we didnt beat ourselves
5 yards a fucking play this sucks
cant believe i really have to listen to them drool over the browns

2020 is a bad acid trip
couldve had dk aj brown or mecole hardman
how long is this game still 10 min left
i got soul but im not a soulja
honestly we have no one to blame but ourselves we choked so many god damn games this year and now this fucking piss take of a game im fucking livid
yeah the defense is cooked
i guess holding is legal on this drive
without lamar were for sure one of the worst teams in the league
411 yards from the browns embarrassing
embarrassing fucking embarrassing
what in the fuck happened man
please lamar
this team really doesnt deserve the playoffs at very least the defense doesnt so much talent being wasted
our season ends on lamar cramps how classic
just handoff to jk and gus milk clock win on jt fg
id take 4 receivers on the steelers over hollywood
offense has had leads against pitt tenn and now this browns team

at some point when the offense has the lead in the 4th the defense needs to make a stop have we made a stop to win a game this year
fuck our defense two fourteen point leads theyve been hot fucking garbage when we need them the most
i believe ravens would win if lamar didnt have the cramps
snead is a fucking g dude
this season is honestly deserved we have so many glaring holes that compounded with other factors injuries covid

we need a real reset on some major positions of importance olb wr and offensive line
get a long slow drive and kick a game winning fg i just hope lamar is ok
trent dilfer still doing mnf can he play
this isnt just cramps makes no sense
cant say anything about lamar probably still covid complications
lets go j k dobbins
why the fuck would call an option you dumbass roman
they run a damn qb run every single 3rd and short
what is this timeline
lol what a fucking play on 3rd and 2
so lamar is only coming back because trace is hurt what the hell is this again its the season
this is the shit legends are made of
is that lamars music
lamar returns to the shittiest situation literally
dam did this shit just turn into the wwe
oh watch out watch out coming out the tunnel with the steel chair lamar jackson
dont care if its a cramp or not im scared for lamar
field has fucking pam sprayed all over the field
lmao lamar with the steel chair fucking lol
how do you not give that to gus right up the fucking middle
espn you picked the worst time for a commercial
who is that is thatlammaaaaaar jaackksoooonnn
honestly part of me wanted to see koch line up
hey cleveland

lamars coming

fuck mcsorley be ok
this fourth quarter has been dramatic to the extreme like if i wrote this as a screenplay for a sports movie someone would tell me this was over the top
i trust tucker from anywhere under 60 but this field obviously sucks
movie plot qb leaves game with lead to poop teams loses lead qb finishes pooping and heroically leads team to victory
he got his head out of his ass finally
holy fuck that was ballsy
lamar left the game to poop but hollywood just has shit hands glad he caught it though
this the cheesiest football movie i ever seen
fuck all of you negative assholes lamar with the chair
defense do not fuck this up
fire this defense from a cannon
jimmy smith out with a groin put that on harbaughs gravestone
lol my god this is one of the worst defensive efforts ive seen
one fucking stop is all we needed all game one goddamn stop
offense finally gets a good game and our defense decides its done for the season
this defense cant hang in the playoffs with anyone
as a neutral fan this would be a damn good game as a browns hater its agonizing though
we could get a game winning fg with 1 minute left if we get it somehow
get down the field and get a field goal
bunch of pussies on defense
in tucker we trust
ray lewis would be screaming right now holy shit so many talent on this defense but bunch of pussies at the same time
this has tucker game winner written all over it

pls tucker help us
49 seconds to drive the entire field our defense is just so bad they have 0 conditioning corners play 10 yards off the ball we have 0 pass rush when we dont blitz

its embarrassing
how much money do we have invested in this dogshit defense lmao offense is getting paid pennies compared to the defense while they put up 40 and the defense gives up 40
no matter what happens this game is not on lamar
mandrews
sucks all of this has to fall on jacksons shoulders this game should have ended seamlessly when we were up by 2 scores
what a week to stop sniffing glue
i wish i could push a button and send all 3 announcers into a dunk tank
thats a full grown fucking man love you andrews
big cock tuck
this game was fn amazing
im literally shaking omg
there were a whole lot of heroes tonight in white and purple

youre damn right
and it ends on the weirdest safety ive ever seen in my life what the hell even happened tonight
lmao
thats the way run up the score
one of the most riveting games in recent memory
one of the best ravens games i have ever seen
win the fuck out and hope for a dolphins colts or browns loss

we got this shit
that went on too damn long

also that defense owes that offense dinner for the rest of the damn season
holy shit we got a safety lol


goddamn i got hypertension now
this shit took guts man the offense is fucking back dawg lets go
what a fucking ride lamar can throw is what i take from this wow i got my money worth tonight
one of the best games ive ever seen
this was the best football ive seen in a while
the fact baker and lamar didnt have masks on hugged then put the mask on is hilarious to me
was mark ingram a healthy scratch
this team is literally incapable of playing complementary football lol
disgraceful defensive performance if suggs lewis or reed were still here theyd be on their asses rn
think about it this defense practices against lamar and they still let baker fucking run it in on em im fucking sick
watch the play again hunt was clearly in bounds stop whining
ok so they cant stop us on defense our d just needs to wake the fuck up
good half now put together a whole game and we can run with anybody
i cant understand anything this announcers say with all that browns cock in their mouth
imagine risking catching a deadly fucking virus in the middle of a pandemic to watch your team get dad dicked by their rivals
pathetic showing by the defense
did i miss something or was his second foot obviously out of bounds
he was in glad harbaugh didnt challenge
such a good route that miss by lamar could really hurt us
those were two terrible throws good lord
can these announcers stop sucking baker off he made a bad read
how do you not play press on that 4th and 4with a wildly inaccurate qb
this defence is just blowing it so hard 27 points against the fucking browns is that their 3rd 4th down conversion
collected emotions from both fanbase tonight during and after the game
i hope we light up their secondary its their big weakness
give lamar insurance commercials ya cowards
fuck cleveland and their shit team
wink martindale is so cool
damn edc sign booger to the roster
im worried about calais i hope he doesnt aggravate his leg
have faith have truss we will prevail
two biggest points for tonight

1 defense must wrap up when tackling

2 corners need to stop giving receivers 10 yds of cushion

these minor tweaks will be the game changers for us

lets go flock
i love every single one of you lets do this
20 years and the ravens cant defend a screen
screen plays are our fucking kryptonite
how do we seem to get burned on screens almost every single time
screens working is what happens when you are a blitz happy defense which happens when you dont have a quality front four rush
jesus our defense is already fucking up
marlon forced another fumble
and another wtf 2 ffs and no recoveries
season really comes down to this game not feeling so hot
lmao dumbass refs again not calling clear penalties
defense lol
meh screens and gimmick plays lol
defense just got toasted
our line is soft
stay positive boys this aint the browns team were used to
stefanski is a master of first drive playcalling relax everyone
so many debbie downers
lets look at the positives weve made every tackle we should of 2 fumbles already

the negatives our lbs are playing like shit our dline is getting no pushpressure and we are playing too much zone
you cant run those kinds of tricks with this line
lol that looked like it was never even practiced before not very smooth
keep it simple and run the ball tonight please
holding defense i am shocked
are we playing on a hockey rink why so much slipping
holy shit a holding call in our favor
are you kidding
come on man these mistakes cant happen
that would be unessacary roughness if we flipped a guy like that
haha what a ridiculous decision that dpi was one of the most obvious youll ever see
hollywoods drawn two penalties already
lamar needs longer spikes or something hes scaring me with this slipping
dogshit city dogshit field
someones gonna get hurt on that field
another slip get some better cleats
lj needs some new cleats or hes going to blow out his leg
these commentators give me fucking aids
is their field made of bacon grease
these announcer jinxes are so lame find something interesting to talk about so lazy
wed be nothing without lamar
lamar jackson is our entire offense its unbelievable
lamar looking good today
put the team on his back
fuck yes
lets gooo
truzz baby we the defending champs thats the defending mvp lfg
mandrews
lamar was about to get fined if he dunked on the post
orlando brown is a giant among giants
i swear whoever made these graphics ate all the shrooms
clark that was so fucking stupid
that judon hit was clean bush league call
so we cant sack a qb now got it
thats one of the worst calls ive seen in a while
how the fuck is it roughing if he still had the ball
how is that a tough call flag qbs for lowering their head then
that is our fucking ball
its tough to watch games like this where the refs decide to influence the game
harsh call on judon
unreal series by the ref the fumble is meh looked like he got it the judon call can fuvk right off
shove that roughing the passer call up your asses refs
zebras gotta have their virtue signaling underdog story
are you fucking kidding me
are you kidding me are you kidding these refs need to be fired he barely touched him quit treating the browns like tom brady
ref ball
ref ball
these refs are actually braindead
such a weak ass dpi
fuck this
fucking rigged poor nfl cant have baby baker make any mistakes fucking rigged
what the fuck
so fucking bullshit
weak
ass
calls
fuck that pi call bullshit
these refs better get their shit together this is unwatchable
that call was bogus
that was a horrendous call on jimmy then marcus lines up a yard offsides and they dont call it
refball
im beginning to wonder if the nfl refree benefits has vision cause these refs could definitely use it
we didnt shoot ourselves in the foot
why do the refs always hate us what did we do
harbaugh mustve fucked this mans wife or something idk
damn should have lit him up there
going on 4th and 8
were gonna go 4 downs and go at 36 anybody else hear that
please go for it
they are banking on us getting a penalty by going for it on 4th after those last few attempts
i love how the browns know they gotta stay up on us they scared
lol everyone knew they werent gonna go for it there
judon couldve been penalized there glad he didnt though
does stefanski think hes edgy or something
these pussy pi calls getting outta hand not to mention the phantom roughing call
undeserved points
hahaha fuck you parkey
shocked the refs didnt call that good
you aint tuck gtfo
imagine your kicking missing from under 40 lmao glad that aint us s
lmfao what you deserve

go cry for more fuckin flags
ball dont fucking lie baby
ball dont lie
ball never lies
shoulda went for it lul
what is this shit stain offense
can we get lamar some new cleats
right on schedule an illegal motion
pass pass pass punt what a fucking joke
shit play calls lamar needs to change his cleats
horrible playcalls we can never capitalize this type of shit is all greg roman
thats the third time he slips wtf
whats the deal with his back foot slipping
get him some deeper cleats
good calls roman truly nice well designed plays
what the fuck are these passing concepts its just shallow crosses that are perfectly covered everywhere
at least the first of our 3 illegal shiftformation penalties came at an inconsequential time
dude this field is gonna kill him
greg roman needs to go not a single run called wtf was that
they only rushed 4 all 3 times and got massive pressure
what is with this turf lamar is slipping everywhere
also

fuck greg roman
fucking garbage that first fucking play pissed me the fuck off fake a handoff sling it to snead even if he caught it all that work for 2 fucking yards wtf
lamar needs to change his shoes
tyre phillips is a fuckin turnstile
lamars gotta get rid of the ball
this is exactly what we knew would happen have a great drive on the ground then immediately have a 3 and put calling 3 pass plays
please change your fucking clears llama
why is illegal motion not a dead ball foul currently it just creates a free play for the defense
6 pass yards geez
browns screeching for a holding flag during the punt screeching for contact on fair catch

theyre trying to exploit our biggest weaknessshitty refs
flags flags flags flags
shoot this ref into the fucking sun
we gotta be one of the most undisciplined teams in the league
these calls are just fucking ridiculous
3 players in motion wtf
looks like were playing the refs again tonight
i think roman has sold the season
gregs getting bailed out hes gonna fuck us again tho
he could have ran for a first what a fucking moron
he fucking launched at that guy 5 yards away lmao
lets thank our lord moneyman marlo
roman please run the god damn ball
good job on that fake fair catch
proche mvp
great play by proche underrated returner
proche lovely
that was smooth as fuck
now because roman fucked it up with 3 passes he loses opportunity to mix it up and you can almost guarantee this first play is a run
myles garrett as walter payton moty lol
dobbins goin ta werk
freeeeeeee dobbins
dobbins literally looks at the football and gets a 1st i love this guy
when the best guy on the browns is someone who assaulted someone lot of character in the building
these announcers sucking off garrett even tho he couldve killed someone last year lmao
this field is fucking trash
what is this trash ass field
lamar needs to change his cleats at halftime
wtf is wrong with this trash ass field
this fucking turf
can we assume they somehow slicked the field to gain an advantage against our run game
they greased the ravens cleats buttergate
hate to see garret hurt hes a beast
i hope myles is ok
dont get cute roman keep running its working
we tryna make sure they the worst running d in the league
this is such a good drive gotta pound it in for 7
the hug worked
there you go baby fuck the browns
dont give up on the run

dont go full trestman
keep running it until they can stop it
that was a sexy drive

more of those please
dont stand in the way when the gus bus is coming down the road
fuck yeah now lets get a fucking stop on d
hey looks like its a good thing when we run imagine that
the forward pass was a mistake
if we dont stop running imma go off
i smell a peters pick 6
just run the damn ball with mixed in pa and crossing routes to snead and duvernay please

once lamar improves his passing and we get him some receivers were going to be the best offense of all time
garrett look high asf
hahah jk legs go brrr
campbell with the pressure
why do we ever touch zone
can we play man i hate zone somebody always open
elliot fucked up
why zone
oh youre doing well in man go zone and play your safeties close to los
terrible defense
anyone know why there are so many fans there like didnt they need special dispensation for this game to begin with isnt there a curfew
this defense is a unique combination of undisciplined and soft
were playing them great they aint running the ball to well were forcing baker to beat us and hes doing exactly that
lamar is 2 for 3 with 4 minutes til half and honestly im good with it
can we bring back the practice squad dl
why does it feel like that happens every other game now
i hate how our highest paid players are on defense and all and every blame for everything goes on lamar not right man
i really wish this thread was more level headed the browns are a good team and they scored to tie the game

we get the ball back before half and have the ball after half were still in a good position against a strong opponent
shoegate
what in the holy goddamn fuck is with the goddamn slipping what the fuck
tyre phillips is a god damn turnstile
throw the ball away holy shit
wow pathetic dont even want to try for a first down
this is how we lose games
cool thanks for trying roman
wtf let lamar throw deep
why tf would you hand it off to justice hill on a 3rd and 19
what a controversial week to be a football cleat
dope 4 minute offense
fire him
fuck greg roman and those damn cleats
hmm throw on first down then run on 2nd and 3rd and long interesting
also why justice hill is always on the field every 3rd down
i feel like ive watched about 4 hours of ads
joker does one thing great and its laying the wood
equipment manager making a quick run to walmart to get some cleats
hey a penalty on the browns
espn cant show the pick route wtf
go shit defense way to hold em
go up 7 then go back up 7 after half come on
lets get some points
the officiating isnt great but at least its even
plenty of time 2 timeouts and 1 minute who got the ball to start i tuned in late
on the one hand i obviously want a td on the other i wouldnt be upset watching tucker nail a 55 yard fg
fg here isnt bad
god damn these long ass commercial breaks
did the announcers just blame lake erie lol
alright lets get tuck in position here boys tack on some more points before the half
damn it hollywood
soulja playing like a fraud
we aint beating the chiefs anyhow man this fucking offense
ctrlf soulja 25 results

never fails lmao
hollywood lookin like a bust
i was about to say why the fuck are we not using andrews tonight
mark andrews wr1
best celebration ever stunning skill
did we get some new cleats
cleats changed
offense on
fuck yeah

we get the ball back at half too
espn ravens so one dimensional
espn ravens greatest offense ever
thank you lamar and mandrews for picking up that shit from soulja
mark andrews highlight reel but its only plays right before the first half ends and only against cleveland
thats my quarterback
unnecessary roughness on hollywood by the announcer
we are like a half second away from a strip sack its coming
cant give that shit up cant allow points here
be you be you and ill destroy it
watching the playback tape its not like plays arent downfield but i genuinely feel this man lamar does not feel his guys can make a contested play and for good ass reason
imagine this team with an actual receiving core worthy of even starting for a college team
espn stream dogshit
peters with a physical tackle ruining their chance at a fg okay marcus
nice to see some heat and pressure from the dline
poor ngakoue man is so close every play
serious question when was the last time we had a sack i feel like its been weeks no joke

edit ok one last week so besides tonights grounding call thats 1 sack in the last 25 games
ouch chuck lmfao
he need some milk lmao
whelp chuck clarks nickname is now george of the jungle
walk it off chuck
it was the sound effect that he made that killed me i was concerned until i seen him jog off
my heart just dropped that couldve been really bad
need a score coming out of the half badly this team loves to give up leads

and god brown sucks
lmao they were clowning clark in the walk to the locker room
reminds me of when the other maryland team lost their qb for the season because after a td he headbutted a wall and injured his back

edit gus frerotte


what does this team need to find some magic back in the passing game
need to come out at half and stomp on their throats
they still use this old ass music for the espn halftime show lol
this has been the best browns ravens game since baker lamar
roman i hate you so much
oh

lort

44 yard keeper
the mans a menace
lamar taking over
jesus christ lamar
holy fucking shit llama mvp
them new cleats tho
was prepared for the he is houdini right there

great to have you back mvp lamar
been awhile since lamar has broken someones ankles
lets goo gus bus td
we 100 own these clowns 447 was the biggest fluke
i love lamar so much holy fuck
gus 2 smooth wit it
extend gus edwards now
its the shoes
lj you beautiful bastard
baltimore navy football ravens
lets stop em and get another one
lmaoooooooo cleveland browns shit on
easy money
idk why lamar jackson stopped running earlier this year but this is what happens when he usn afraid to scramble
are we gonna see another baker mayfield unraveling
master gave dobby shoes
were running all the way to the sb truzzzzzzz
the magic gus bus
time for a baker signature interception lets put these clowns away
really important for the defense to keep the momentum going cant let it be a two score game for just one drive
this is the lamar jackson this team needs cut that man loose and nobody will stop him
im smelling another fumble by fruit punch da gawd
lamar said hold my cleats
now defense play what your salary actually is
great pass baker
ravens have more rushing yards this week than last week at 198 right now had 296 last week
please please please defense dont shit the fucking bed
i love this team when were somewhat healthy
socan we actually get a sack
wwoww what a catch by njoku
calais should not even be playing he looks so hobbled
holy shit wink has crazy drip
oh right i forgot the defense and offense are contractually not allowed to play well at the same time
imagine how different things would look with a component pass rush
defense what the actual fuck bro
watch the play again people he clearly had one foot in and then his toe hit the turf again and then afterwards it went out its a catch
hunt kicks women
straight up the reffing of this game has been the worst of any game ive seen
more than half of the salary cap into this soft ass defense jesus christ haha
now its a stressful game all over again
please dont go 3 and out just run
really need the o to keep the foot on the gas
never thought a ravens defense would be getting carried by a ravens offense
cody parkey really wants out of the nfl
tucker coming through with the hex on the opposing kicker
cant get off on 3rd
hmm resodding the field
calais needs to get healthy
hope that missed pat end up losing the game for the browns
offense hey guys we scored time to keep the pressure up right

defense walks out
i just cant get over how easy their rushing tds have been its so pathetic
fuck you kareem hunt woman beating motherfucker
kareem hunt kicked a woman so lets talk about him like hes a great guy lol ok espn
fired up llama is gonna carry us

he owns the clowns
we gotta win to get that sweet sweet 32 division record
andrews just appears like a ghost
this fucking team and presnap penalties
im surprised it wasnt our weekly illegal formation lol
lamar gotta hit that pass
why did we pass so much
his mechanics look like they did last year tonight his touch is not where it was last year yet tho
hes got to make those throws
browns fans ravens fans

fuck sandejo
bowser has kidnapped princess baker
bowser more of a soulja than hollywood lmao
tyus bowser has better hands than hollywood
tyus bowser needs to get paid
thats the baker i love
5 touchdowns on the ground
lets fucking go bowser what a catch wtf
the career percentage dropped noooo
one handed interceptions are all the rage this week
love to see baker taking hot ls
i love bowser
whatever still got the 6 points
bro they literally mention that harbs was a st coach in philly everytime they fuck up on st lmao
go home joe buck
king koopa szn
get ready for mayfield to air it out to landry its script
i bet they put kyler on a booster seat in that commercial
not even the 4th q yet wtf
missed xps by block in cleveland 09 20 on mnf


go figure lol
wouldnt be a ravens game without the announcers mentioning harbs st start
something always has to go to shit this year if the offense is playing great its the defense that shits the bed if wink calling the goty the offense is abysmal if both the o and the d makes their play int and td the special teams fucks it up

theres always something with this team haha
yeah were still looking for our face mask penalty too
okay illegal hands but then no opi
landry wants a facemask after not getting a offensive facemask that first drive foh
tyus bowser is now tied with marcus peters for the team lead in interceptions this year 3 none have been bigger than that wow ryanmink
baker mayfield is 1733 51 with an average of 60 yards per pass and 0 tds with an interception

and i have coworkers who told me today that baker is way more accurate and a better passer overall than lamar all day today
baker whines every play shut up already
naive me was hoping they would punt
baker whines like a wr
wtf is this 3min break 3 second play 3 minute commercial that was literally one fucking play lol
defense should ashamed of themselves
at the start of the second half i muted my tv and started listening to the radio broadcast and i dont even care that its a full play behind
its almost 1100 and the 4th is just now starting wtf
lamar not on the sideline cleat work
lamar has the shitsss lmaoooo
lamar got the shits
hes dropping the browns off at the super bowl only time that will happen
gotta be shitting right
where are you guys hearing lamar is just pooping
what if lamar runs out of toilet paper
shitters full

he screams from the locker room
jokes on them lamar will be that much faster after droppin that deuce
leave calais alone
greg roman was the 15th man
peters just embarrassed he fell down on that shit
that wasnt on elliot i guess he could have helped quicker but thats on the fall this dog shit field
of course the refs swallow their whistles when cleveland holds
we have the most un clutch defense in the league
lamar just wipe for fucks sake
this is just demoralizing now how many lucky breaks are going to fall to the browns in one single game
how fucking lucky can these asshats be
how are they so lucky
brian griese is such an annoying terrible commentator my god i want booger back at this rate
eff mnf announcers never heard a team more excited
fuckkkkkkkk
lamar is literally our offense man wtf
where the fuck is lamar
greg roman used the last of the toilet paper
i hate fucking 2020
its good to know romans awful playcalling is not exclusive to when lamar is in
fuck off hollywood

so fucking useless just fucking cut him
thats horrible get marquise out if the 1 receiver spot
imagine drafting marquise fucking brown lmao
i will never say hollywood with this man again i gave you hella chances i was on your side this whole season this game

x200b

you better make up for this now
fuck off hollywood
fucking perriman wouldve caught that
we need a fucking soulja
we need to bench marquise yesterday actually like 8 weeks ago dude is a huge liability
revoke the hollywood nickname

i think its time to say goodbye to hollywood
what the fuck was that marquise cant catch a fucking cold brown
this is feeling like the titans game the other week
baker always crying for a flag
yea this is an l fuck this game
does baker ever finish a play without asking for a flag
marquise butterfingers brown dude needs to earn a name like hollywood
baker the bitch mayfieldlooking for a cheep shot call on the reigning wpmoy fool
cant believe we might fuck this up
how you expect hollywood to catch over corners when he cant catch dines
what a fucking joke our roster is full of mentally soft players
honestly just healthy scratch this fucking bum the rest of the season
hollywood got all the worst qualities of ab and none of the best
defense is absolutely pathetic today
please say sike
most inconsistent defense of all time
what the fuck defense
choker ravens showing up again
lj please
the defense is playing like the game is over same shit with the titans and steelersugh
goddamn refs call a fucking hold lineman are fucking practically tackling ravens rushers
man look at how those guys are catching passes
that was fucking holding
not gonna call that hold
holding ffs
people are all standing immediately cuts to people sitting

even the producers hate the announcers

at least we will be a jt field goal away from winning bad news is that well have to get into field goal range with our backup qb
how did we blow this game oh wait our defense is garbage
fuck this defense
lmao this defense does not deserve to even see a playoff game
nobody could catch that fat fuck really

what an implosion
how many 10 point blown leads does this defense have this year
why is 26 just standing around
this is hilariously sad
oh my dear fucking god above
is lamar back
no a hint of pressure
there is so much damn time chillllll lamar come back bb
lets be honest guyswere nowhere near a sb team this year for a lot of reasons do yall see this defense stopping any dominant offense in the playoffs you have blinders on if you do
brown should not have a job next week he should be playing in the xfl hed still drop it
marquise brown is tj housmanzadeh
shades of new england 2014 the team collapses because the d cant get stops
marquise brown has all the bitchiness of antonio brown with none of the skill
theres no way its cramping
this is just a nightmare scenario
0 out 4 using a rb without lamar on the field
brown owes us 2 touchdowns fck you and your tweet
backup qb and roman refuses to run
we have gashed this team on the ground all game

our 3rd string qb is on the field

so we throw on 1st down this is absolutely inexcusable
love this team to death but the baltimore ravens are not clutch this is going to be a brutal final 6 minutes
just need to get it to where tucker can kick one
bozeman may not be as good as othersbut he plays hard and seems like a great guy
just pound the rock
lamar must be hurting though tbh if hes not out there it sounds bad
ohio so fucking stupid for letting fans in this stadium pandemic is more serious than sports
yes just run the ball
i dont trust this defense fg will not be enough
greg roman has ruined both of our qbs by rushing them constantly in the same game lmao
dude how shit is this field why cant they plant in normal cleats
i mean all you can do is fucking laugh
you cant make this shit up
x200b

just in timelamar jackson is back out on the field
holy shit hes back hes going to take it to the house with his empty colon
who wrote this fucking script
take us to the promised land lamar
this turf has caused multiple injuries cleveland grounds crew needs to fucking fix this shit inexcusable
fuck this turf
you cant script this shit
what the fuck man lamar comes back out on fourth down
bring out koch for the win
guys we are actually cursed this is insane hahahaha
what is happening this evening
god this season is just so fuckin cursed cmon lamar
gone roman youre gone
could lamar have come out 45 seconds ago before trace got fucked
what the fuck is going onnnnn
lamar courtesy flush jackson back in the game
lamar jackson showed up like goku to planet namek
sam koch will save us all
are you fucking joking with that call

fire roman now

call two fucking runs in a row and you will get two yards on this defense jesus
last year really was our shot huh
field
srsly i hate the scriptwriters of 2020
trace is not a bad qb2 we just need our reliable receivers out there hollywood gets replaced by dez when he gets back
have my babies lamar
ive got chills thats my quarterback
if we win this just adds to the legend of lamar good god what a fucked up game
i am about to have a fucking heart attack
ngl my heart stopped for a quick 2 seconds brown heard yall talking shit
what the fuck is this game
yoooooooooo hahahaha yoooooooo hahahahaahahahaha
mnf game of the year and i fucking hate every second of it
thank you to trace mcsorley for doing your part under very unideal circumstances both games youve been asked to come play good job man hope youre ok
lamar literally came out on some avengers endgame shit
you cant tell me this isnt scripted wtf is going on
so did lamar shit himself and they had to clean it all up or something is that what took so long lmao
if only our secondary wasnt xfl level rn
bro lamar lmaooo what a hero lets go hollywood
lamar is now our past present and future dealwithitgif
im not ready for another heartbreak
unfortunately we dont have any corners theyre going to score
our defense is fucking terrible
legitimately jets level defense
honestly lamar looks sick possibly random illness possibly flu i really dont want the poor man to have to keep playing through being sick but please carry us and then go home
so lamar comes in to save the game just to have our defense give up sounds about right
learn how to tackle holy shit
dude this team cant stop the chiefs anyways our defence is brutal
no lie i could throw against this defense

why the fuck are we so far off the ball
this defense is so fucking bad wtf giving this game up all game all these pass rushers and nothing
welli didnt know you could lose a game twice
that was the bestcase scenario for us we already knew the defense was going to fail at least now lamar has some time
defense is a damn joke i understand injuries but holy fuck show some heart
we dont deserve to be in the playoffs could you imagine what mahomes would do to this defense
focus all your energy into justin tucker
ruined a legendary lamar moment absolutely ruined it
imagine scoring 42 pts and it not being enough
i feel so bad for our rbs and lamar can anyone at all help them
lmao it doesnt show growth it just shows how badly weve regressed
coaching has been fucking abysmal
we didnt change up anything the weirdest thing
fucking overtime when i already shouldve been asleep an hour ago lmao not getting any work down tomorrow
hopefully the browns scored with to much time left in the game
offense has a real chance to win this in regulation

roman and lamar this is on you guys
ok lamar time to shine
they gave the ravens to much time tbh
i cant believe our expensive ass d gave up 42 fuckinng points
lets go lamar put this team on yoru back and carry us in
i was talking to my dad why tf did lamar go out
we love you mark andrews
wow we are almost past midfield incredible
my god the stress is so real
all saidkevin stefanski is a stone cold killer hes on the come up they should have hired him last year
the cramp game
tucker holy fucking shittttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
dont ever tell me he isnt the best fucking kicker
i just saw a goat hug another goat
tucker i swear to god im gonna put on a red wig and pretend im your wife so you can fuck me
thats my quarterback and my motherfucking kicker
i just cant believe what i just saw
give me my 2 points
end on a fucking safety fucking christ
good fuck you cleveland
im
speechless what a crazy game
that might be the craziest game ive ever seen
thank god we didnt lose because lamar had to take a shit
that was the greatest thing ive ever watched
cry browns cry
lj game from behind to win with his arm
that might have been lamars first game winning drive
i love this team i love you all i love lamar jackson i love baltimore i love beer
holup why this camera guy wearing shorts
so yannick knocks over baker on a huge completion and flexes on him is that the best he can do what was the hype for
some of yall spend more time typing cold takes than watching the damn game
fuck labron james
the ravens have shot themselves in the foot the roughing the passer on judon just stop talking
holy shit these announcers are c r i n g e
fuck this trash ass fucking field cleveland is a shithole
so they just gonna let chubb walk in ffs
i swear we have got to be the dumbest team sometimes i mean after like couple of slips you change your shoes can this not be done between drives
you run on 3rd and 19 and pass on 1st and 10 what more proof do you need get that man greg tf outta here
browns fans say lamar cant throw but they like baker mayfield
lamar did that to a grown maaaaannnn
ravens cb marlon humphrey baltimores identity to choke yes yes it is marlon goddamn this defense is so bipolar
gotta make that throw cmon lj
he makes that last year lamar has got a lot of offseason work to do
lmao these announcers want cleveland to win so badly
absolutely pathetic defense on that drive just disgusting
for real lamar is too good for this team and is completely being wasted he would have 2 rings with the people mahomes has
put duvernay as wr1 plz
just remember next time you want to shit on lamars passing this year marquise is our 1 wr by a wide margin too
300k fucking people are dead and these fucking chucklefucks are like dont you love the crowd noise
no one cares what lebron has to say
low key missing that piece of shit earl thomas
this team quit harbs this is on you
wait not a penalty on us
lamar absolutely fucking loves playing the browns
romans getting fired after this game no way anyone can watch this and think he can stay
holy fuck refs

enough with the bullshit even rnfl agrees these calls are absurd
ill say this cleveland has a top 5 o line wrs and rbs so defense giving up points gonna happen eventually
that was a bend over and i give up play call pathetic absolutely pathetic
parkey sucks so much
consecutive bad throws come on
lamar has to make that throw
lamar has hit that play to andrews so many times

baker has missed some that far notice how there isnt the extra commentary after those though
lamar gotta throw throw throw all offseason
those werent penalties drops playcalling those were just 2 bad throws
i swear these announcers are so trash
if lamar is out there i trust the o if mcsorley comes back out its gg
i will sucker punch anybody who tries to pin this game on lamar
fuck that stadium and the goddam turf
need injury updates stat
i havent been this nervous about a ravens game in a long time i do live in cleveland so thats part of it
man it sucks ass that dez is still on the covid list like we were very carefully and methodically easing him into things and then he just has to miss two games not like we really needed him against the cowboys but id feel better about tonight if we had him in
monday night countdown split 22 for ravensbrowns to win

x200b

first time ive ever liked booger
stop the run make baker a passer pressure him get in that ass hes the worst player in the nfl under duress we do that we win we lose this game the season is over
mandrews being back gives me life
lets get this bitch
belee
lets flush these browns
mayfield is trash but if they cant defend a simple screen it doesnt matter
gimmick football is all they have
isnt it pass interference to block when the ball is in the air
wow i cant believe im jeolous of the fucking browns offense fuck greg roman
i said this many weeks ago we play deep ball defense we cant stop any damn screens theyll just nickel and dime us all day step up the linebackers
defense letting a bum ass qb dominate them again shocker
fucking peters plays the worst fucking man coverage holy shit
idgaf if he forced that fumble why does he play off so much
need the offense to show up
dont we have great press corners wtf is happening with all this open space
two fumbles on two straight plays jesus christ
every fucking week
stop the zone defense wink theyre killing us on those short passes
they finally found a way to cover for bakers failings play action screens and misdirection
its going to be a long night if this is what the d is going to do
2 ff in one drive now we just need to recover one of those
good scripted drive were gonna be fine
lets hope greg roman isnt already panicking lol
ravens are down which means time to abandon the run already
to win my fantasy game i need to get 94 points from tucker tonight
weve been beaten by screens and late dump offs all year long cant stop anything underneath
defense gets 2 strikes

thats strike one

offense gets no strikes
lets hope the offense doesnt look as slow as the defense just did
getting owned by baker mayfield is pathetic
gonna be one those games isnt it
wtf was that
a fucking flea flicker roman kill me
well yall wanted creative play calling
we ran ingram for 1 yard on every first play this year to set up that flee flicker beautiful execution
i am stunned that wasnt on us
so glad we pulled some trick play bullshit on 1st instead of just running for five yards like that
wow thank god
only way to stop a soulja
g ro tryna go coach detroit
weak call
so glad lamar is scrambling more often
snead hungry after being out i hope he gets some passes his way
not a flag on us what timeline is this
how can an offense ran by the fastest qb ever seem to move so fucking slow with no sense of urgency
i cant sit still man this game is already making me so nervous
hollywood drawing a penalty
browns are so hyped for this game if we can just settle in and grind it out we will be aight its a long game
i hate these trash penalties because they show that were a bad team delay of game illegal formation good teams dont take those
as a steelers fan beat these clowns
the flacco special
damn hollywood is drawing all the flags
that was the definition of pass interference
yeah lets throw at that guy tonight lol
lamar is so slippery
myles garrett disrupted this play

uh i think it was the db who tackled the wr who disrupted the play you fucking idiot
bruh lamar slipping is making me really nervous for them ankles
man lamar has slipped every time hes scrambled
this ice hockey
lamar 100 going to switch cleats
did they grease lamars cleats damn
baker your carpet is shit fuck that garbage field
here comes the aikman jinx
whenever they show the replay looking downfield every single one of our wrs are locked up
llama td ravens
the ravens pulling out the flaccosmith classic on that dpi ball
lamar running is making me nervous hes stumbled on 80 of the snaps this drive
lamar
browns our there throwing banana peels
lfg
we are gonna spank these hoes
imagine if we had an oc who could scheme our receivers open and then also have lamar do shit like that fuck man
thats how we do it lets go defense
freaky l
nothing hotter than seeing the blocking scheme work like they said excellent kick out to block garret that freed brown to step up in the hole
the oline is not playing well rn but lamar turned on hard carry mode for that first drive hopefully the defense plays better
lamar the last 2 games has been running more both on scrambles and designed runs weve been missing that
ding fries are done
that graphic is gonna give mw nightmares
what a fucking bullshit roughing the passer call fuck this league
that wasnt roughing lmao
roughing the passer wtf
fuchs is that roughing the passer fucking soft cucks
that is some horseshit
are you fucking serious that was a clean hit
just call it touching the quarterback
these roughing calls are so pussy now
snaker fakefield literally ducked in to that personal
fucking recover it mannnnnn
what a bullshit rtp call
thats 3 ffs and no recoveries
soft ass call
fuck the browns r so lucky
refs have already blown 2 big calls fuck this game already
well eventually recover one
d gets a stop lets go
3 forced fumbles stick with it boys
thats 3 lucky fumble bounces and the worst rtp penalty ever
was ready for the pi call because peters was within 2 feet of him
yoooo what the fuck are these flags
going to be uss vs all of them huh
glad we are protecting baker tonight on bullshit calls
weak ass call biased reffs
that is absolute shit
what kind of fuckery is this
bro this is insane fucking insane these refs fuck them
that may be one of the worst calls against us all year
and its actually just refball
fucking hell
man steelers fan here and these refs are fucking you guys so far unreal
he barely touched him weak ass call just like the other one
cleveland refs
the browns have gotten no short of 7 breaks in the first quarter unreal
the calls in this game
i know it sounds homery but why do the refs hates us so fucking much every single yard they got this drive was on a penalty against us
you seeing how peters is moving presnap hes feeling it tonight
fuck the browns
baker sucks major fucking dick
best part is cleveland had already tried their tricks we will clamp down refs be damned im so heated and im only on 2 beers before im asked
going for it again wtf
gotta tighten up these calls boys baker is absolutely looking for them now
refs need to stop acting like they have money on cleveland winning
2 ffs by marlon and another by peters tonight in one quarter is insane keep those up and the browns will eventually stop getting lucky recoveries
browns know they have the refs in their pocket so why not go for it on 4th about a 70 chance a flag is thrown for them if they dont convert anyway s
first drive was browns but since then its been all ravens and refs clean it up and we should have this
ball dont lie
lmao parkey
karma
that was sexually pleasurable
thank god we have tucker
the baltimore ravens and getting fucked on third by soft dpirtp calls name a more iconic duo
lol they did all of that with all that help from the refs for nothing
ball dont lie
browns gonna brown with that kick
looooool refs tried their best to give them points but browns gonna brown
as a louisville grad i wanna see lamar fucking stunt on mayfield and show who really should have won that heisman in 2017
this drive were not playing from behind so i better see a lot of runs
lmao tuck wouldnt have missed that
so marlon is only 2 ff away from the record and has 3 games to go if he breaks tillmans record does he get dpoty
i know theoretically we should run it especially with how pass protection has looked so far but id love to see lamar air it out for 15 passing tds in this game
what the fuck is this drive what is gr trying to make this team become
how many times is he going to slip get him some longer spikes
whats with this field
ravens and browns fans fighting
lmao illegal motion penalty
bruh lamar keeps slipping lol
peak roman
lamar change your cleats man
what is this shit field
its like a mirror of my team refs screwing us over good defense shit stain offense lol
exactly what i got downvoted for all week we show signs of life we then come crashing back down because we cant clean up issues weve had all year the same issues every single week
well thats about what i expected
im so done with greg roman his play calling is absolute ass sometimes
he didnt touch you stop crying for more flags
nice field clevelandjust like a fucking pig sty
this line is fucking hard to watch
what the fuck are you doing greg

god i fucking despise this asshole how the hell do you not bother to do a single fucking run when its our strength you lousy fuck
why is lamar keep slipping im thinking cleveland put vaseline on the bottom of his cleats before the game
we lose this game i expect roman to be fired tomorrow
run the football
fire greg roman
we cant get anyone open just run the ball
amazing playcalling by greg roman lol a wr screen with no blockers in front is soo amazing
oh hey look a flag


thats interesting
jesus christ we are getting fucked on calls
the refs finding a reason to throw a flag every play is just comical at this point
jesus christ i guess if you wear a black helmet with a bird on it you get penalized almost every play
i wonder what the browns have on the refs theres gotta be some blackmail involved here
i just want one 300 yard passing game from lamar this year
illegal dropped pass
i am shocked every time an incomplete pass from mayfield isnt called pi
cant believe the d made a okay with no flag
good job defense
idc that its monday its fucking humph day
marlon is the best defensive player in the nfl
phew he might of had that if he ran
me waiting for a flag on 3rd down
surprised baker didnt take the easy run for the first but hey good for us
run please run
good read on that punt nice touch back
smooth play on the punt
ngakoue got held bad on that last play tackle ripped him down by his horse collar
nice play proche
lmao bakers got no touch on the ball lol just rockets it
damn my stream is way behind
im surprised they didnt try that fake punt run right again lol
i love proche
lets hope lamar took off his ice skates
myles garrett nominee for walter payton man of the year didnt he try to kill someone with a helmet
myles garret being the man of the year nominee for the browns is the definition of irony
not only am i up for payton man of the year i also am the only man in the league to take someones helmet off and beat him with it
free dobbins the elf
10 yard carry better sit dobbins
absolutely love when we run on first
guys i think greg roman might be reading this sub hes finally running the ball like we asked
this field sucks
this turf is fucking garbage
if the ravens win this im getting a lamar tattoo
it looks like greg roman has discovered that we are a good running football team

until next drive where he will inexplicably call 3 passes one of which will cause an illegal formation penalty
we need better cleats lol dont see browns having the same problem
harbaugh better be running to smack tf outta roman or give lamar new cleats
john just saved lamar from something big
oh man this running thing is pretty rad

we should probably do it more often

im cootcch
gus bus powering his way for six
beep beep motherfucker
its a love hate relationship with greg romans play calling
touchdown
honk honk motherfucker gus bus is plowing through
shhh no one say anything we dont want the refs to overturn it
gus da bus
gus fucking bus
keep running the fucking ball
you could hear gus breathing from the 10 holy shit haha he wanted that td
all abooooaaard
cant play cute run the damn ball
eat my salty salty nuts browns
thats a badass cape
so who has an idea as to why the timeout and why lamar hugged harbs

thanks for the responses
look at what running the football does
honk honk bus comin thru
idk man should any one ever own a yellow ravens jersey
is the ravens offense bipolar or something how are we two separate teams at the same time
love to see that lamar isnt forcing things
this surface is scaring the hell out of me not sure what the browns are doing to their cleats that we arent
lamar might throw for 60 yards and we might win a win a win inching closer to the playoffs
beep beep baby all aboard
let the ravens be the ravens roman run the ball and dont stop until we lift hardware
we will win despite these zebras man lets fuckin go
embrace the run
no reason to throw the ball when they keep dropping 8 in coverage just keep pounding make them stack the line
cant wait for the next drive when we run a fleaflicker screen and 60yard bomb down the field
holy shit gus bus was amazing
offense finally looks like it should
this game is the shows why basic box score stats dont matter lamar has 14 passing yards but has been dominant
garrett probable
i wish the nfl would stop with the espn games their network and app are awful
why does baker always look like he is putting his whole body into the throw lol
we should just draft wide receivers that can block just convert a bunch of tight ends to receivers
cant run zone every play your corners get tired this isnt madden
imagine having a line like the kind that gives mayfield all that time
turnover inc
damn but they gave us too much time
its ok we got this
gotta get them off the field on that 3rd down earlier in the drive
this game is gonna come down to the defense making a stop lets just hope we can score one more time before half then get the ball back
chance to put them down 14 before they ever see the ball again lets get it
wish lamar had their o line
if lamar had the browns offense around him hed be 121 tonight
can we get him some fucking different cleats this looks like a high school team right now
fuck you roman you fucking fat useless fuck
fire the stupid fucking equipment manager and greg roman while youre at it
great so fuck the strength coach and the equipment guy
the field doesnt look like its in good shape to me
dude wtf is wrong with the browns turf jackson has slipped more on that turf than anything ive ever seen its not even his fault hes slipping his cleats just arent sticking
well manicured field what
were giving this game away we cant let them be up going into half time
we will never win a superbowl and maybe not even a playoff game if we can not pass the ball at all
what a fucking waste of a drive man this team
its always something with this fucking team this year
lj is not happy i like us getting the ball in the second half but we cant let them score before we go into the locker room
greg roman needs to stop with the rollouts
coaches have checked out this season tackling has been an issue all year they do nothing to fix it receivers arent schemed open they do nothing to fix it lamar slipping and sliding all over the place nothing
and we still arent changing spikes wtf is going on
what a coward move jesus
people upset we are trying to throw meanwhile the browns have one of the worst secondaries this offense cant produce yards in the air is a real problem
everytime lamar does that half assed rollout shit something goes wrong
running game working

why are we running it
fire roman please
elliott absolutely blows dudes up you love to see it
lol this dumbass just threw shade at smith
yeah thats grounding but go off
halftime trip to academy for some damn cleats
pls make something happen youre at midfield ffs
good field let jt cook get the double whammy
ravens pass rush this year is all about almost getting there
great field position if we arent leading at halftime its a major disappointment
omg great field position lets get a fg
just need a fg boys
baker is so cringy literally the next whiny tom brady
here come the draw plays up the gut to run out the clcok
cant let this chance slip
kareem was not in the area what are the announcers on
score here to end the half then score on the first drive of the 2nd half

easy 2814 lead
baker mayfield mopped the field before the game for a progressive commercial
baker mayfield looks like a turd rolled in corn flakes
ok im sorry i was roman apologist but i had enough
call me emotional but go 4 wide for 4 downs fucc it
yea that was definitely a fuck up on the intentional grounding and then the brain dead announcers are totally clueless as to why mayfield is arguing
now if only brown could catch
marquise are you fucking kidding me
soulja
marquise doesnt give an ounce of effort
manly man mandrews
thank god for mark andrews
fucking mandrews
mark andres is the only good thing to come out of ou
what a fucking bosssss
they dropped the outta nowhere god i love the ravens and rasslin
lamar is the whole fuckin team right now
turns out the real friends were the mark andrewses we made along the way
new cleats who dis
lamar legit has the team on his back tonight
only the ravens can make us rage quit to celebrating in literally two plays
yall see that throw catch and punt celebration by lamar dude really is our entire offense
okay the throw off the wall right back to himself was elite
the only remark i want to add to the convo right now fuck yeah
love the announcers absolutely slaying soulja boy
longest last 2 minutes evvvvveeeeerrrrr
lamar is incredible what is up with brown tho
time for that famous baker pick6
i need yannick to get a sackhes always inches close
we smackin mayfield around all night
peters earning his cheque there hes all business but not making business decisions tonight
clark you good bro
hey baker it doesnt count as a field goal if you throw it through the uprights
what a fitting ending running into the upright
chuck aint gonna live that down
here before highlight heaven
was it perfect nope but still good lets ride this momentum into the 2nd
andrews is a monster
last td is for mandrews bb

love that man
where dez at
ive already forgotten the first half but i know were stunting on these hoes lfgo
how is it only the 3rd quarter i gotta work tomorrow lol
run the ball
we that meant to go to boykin
without fail marquise goes backwards every time he catches the ball
marquise brown finally holds on to one lol
look at our llama run
its the shoes
beep beep
beep beep
lets fuckijg go
anklesssssssss
his change in direction is so sick
x2
that cowboys win was huge for morale
read the fucking flair
inject our running game directly into my veins
beep beep motherfuckers
how tf has every other team struggled against the browns this year their run d is literally worse than the cowboys
flair
were back were back were back were back

flashbacks of last season make my pp hard
run them dry ravens run them dry
well that was an awful start



for browns fans
this is the kind of game i love watching
all i want for christmas is not a browns playoff plz santa lamar
this is the way
mvp form
my one criticism of this drive is that it only burned two minutes but in a mustwin game take the points wherever you can get them
lets fucking gooooooo
keep to what is working please pleaaaase keep to what we are doing until the browns can show they can stop it
lets get a turnover on defense and put little baker and this game to bed
hey guys greg romans offense has 28 points in basically two quarters
what a fucking run
its almost like just run until they stop it every week not rocket science
lightweight babyyyy
this will shake up that d line and secondary the passing game should be a little safer now
low key love commercials with peyton in it
lamar on his highlight reel shit on that look what i can do
its great to fall in love with this offense all over again
ok defense you have a cushion but lets not get carried away
should we just fire roman and sign the navy offensive coordinator
lamar is on fire today his best game of the season
fuck it run that bitch for 400
defense actually needs to play like the unit they think they are
just saying ive been saying since july that we need to get hot at the right time that is all
i love that we are running the ball especially lamar not being a statue qb when its a passing play teams are doubling andrews and thats frankly all we have

x200b

x200b

our pass concepts are straight garbage the amount of times ive seen 23 recievers in the same area is disgusting
whered that kid get them pringles
steelers bengals on mnf lmfaooooo
lamar looks like covid made him better at running
dont shit the bed defense please make this easy work
wow we defended a screen properly what a concept
we stopped a screen pass guys
this defense needs to be more clutch man
hes not in bounds
not a catch
why is fort 1 on 1 with hunt
whelp lamar your turn again
parkey is the goat
lol parkey
again defence looks shit they should be embarrassed with that did nothing good nothing
believe in lj bb
they have some pretty good playcalls i think we will get at least one turnover tho
defense is gonna find a way to lose this game if parkey doesnt win it for us
jimmy smith injured fuck
baker is a script qb now that the first drive of the second half is done lets see how he does off script again
lj fort should not be covering a fucking rbhe shouldnt even be that general areasigh
tonight the broadcast wants to make myles garrett and kareem hunt seem like great people interesting strategy
no sacks so far dont remember a single sack against dallas its honestly pathetic
what are the chances we can make boykin into darren waller 20
put in hunt as kicker he is qualified in kicking things
lamar has heart unlike hollywood
good shit boykin
clutch fucking first down
come the fuck on with these flags bro
motherfuck our centers
feed andrews he is uncoverable when he remembers to bring his hands to the game
just a touch off on that one
snead you are so due for a good one its coming homie
really needed to answer with some points on that drive
god fucking damn it thats a td
damn snead grow a foot taller plz
i thought koch was ready to risk it all for a second
fuck me that would ha e been a td
ugh two bad passes come on lamar
dang thats a td
fuck he misread andrews he thought he was gonna go skinnier
snead deserves that chance
great game from lamar running passing is looking rough
defense has to step up
can defense step up here and get one stop
just keep running it pls

control the clock
those two missed throws are going to hurt us big time
manifesting a pick for marlo or peters
bow wow wow
bowser works so hard he really has grown
fuck you baker eat my ass you overrated arrogant shit
hahahahahahahahahaha



breathes



hahaha hahaha hahahaha
thats a contract year player for the ravens baby
never throw on a guy named bowser
bowser mightve had a td there
bowser setting the browns on fire with that beautiful pick i hope we can resign him hes been really good this year
pay bowser
the princess is in another castle baker
have i said espn sucks yet
whoever the fuck just said they were manifesting that pick i love you
i will say as much as i tag on our olbs bowser is a player id def resign for a cheap contract to see if he develops
wow tucker missed fg last week and now blocked pat tonight
when i talk shit about how abysmal the linebacker corps has been i mean the linebacker corps besides bowser this man has been phenomenal and should be a all pro this year
guess they got there missed extra point back
this game is so far from being over
dammit almost never see morgan cox get blown up like that
going for the blackout in football bingo tonight
tucker bby nooooo
this game still feels stupid close

get a stop lets go on another 78 min drive close it out
this game is long
lets fucking ride this momentum get this win go 115 sb run here we come
thats a face mask meanwhile 3 seperate holds
yeah cool game and all but can we acknowledge marlo got 2 ffs tonight i think he needs 2 more to tie the season record
attack of the flags time to stop fucking up
its been like 3 minutes so in case anyone forgot john harbaugh actually used to be a special teams coach fun fact
did we get away with facemasks on 2 backtoback plays lmao
how do you not wrap up lol
how do you miss that sack
how the fuck do you leave landry that open on 4th and 4
baker cryfield whining again
why do we not press jarvis on 4th
practice tackling
what you pointing at baker
we just really need to convert some of this pressure into sacks
is that challengable
how are the browns somehow now enlisting the refs in this game
thats embarrassing
wtf is wrong with our coaching
oh gee a double digit fourth quarter lead
back to ass clenching if they score a td
we need to stop them please and thank you
not gonna lie him writing the 5 in for 15 made me crack up mainly because i cant believe this shit happens every fucking week
wait theres no 15 men on the field penalty so that was legal
elliot may get burned in coverage sometimes but he his fucking hard
excuse me for asking but im not native english speaking and having a hard time understanding the announcers they sound like they have orangebrownish colored sausages or similar shaped meat in their mouths while talking
i hope lamar is pooping
lamar had to poop
uhhh l freaky taking a dump or what
poopoo break
leave lamar alone he just be taking a quick poop break
jihad ward baby coming on strong these past few games
one play dudes please
lamars probably smoking a quick blunt before he smokes the browns again
lol baker is already a first ballot hof according to espn
what how was he that open this defense suuuuuuucks
we straight up cant defend 4th downs at all
fucking elliott
fucking wide open are you kidding me this secondary is a s s
lamar better pinch it off
how are we this bad at 4th down
again i do not trust this defense
x200b

whew chilethank you marcus peters for giving lamar more time to poop
okay is lamar back
that play wouldve been fine if peters didnt get hurt
lamar has cramps apparently
if i fell and gave up a td id act hurt too
100 million for this junior varsity bullshit
offense absolutely needs to score points defense can not be trusted at all now with who were trotting out at cb
everything going browns way here
this team is cursed this year
zero effort defense
how many lucky bounces are the browns gonna get
lamar is going to win this if we do the defense is absolutely abysmal
is lamar off the toilet yet or what
this game is frustrating exciting sure but frustrating 2019 spoiled me i hate close games now
its always some fuckin lucky bullshit
deshons occasional big hits allows people in this sub to forget how bad he is at coverage
when the hell did the browns get luck on their side
oh fuck mcsorley
of course the defense is choking while lamar has cramps
cramps lmfao
i do not wanna see trace mcsorely on this screen
you gotta be fucking kidding me
something else is going on
this is so ravens 2020 literally find creative ways to give these games up
how did lamar look perfectly fine jogging in that video they showed
that was an oh god i gotta shit run if ive ever seen one
trade him
lol wasnt hollywood complaining about touches this year
soulja
fuck you marqiise im done with you kid
marquise you fucking suck
fuck marquise brown
ofc it would be marquise to not hold on to it so much for being a soulja
fucking hollywood man
brown is bad cut him
whats the point of having souljas when you never use them
wtf hollywood ok now im mad
disgraceful
cut hollywood this is not a overreaction hes a bust
fuck marquise brown
fucking hollywood brown dropped his third catch of the night

we need to just cut him after this season

thats right cut him
trace made that throw and he fucking dropped that shit
fuck you brown
fuck hollywood
bout ready to say fuck it with hollywood hes a 3 receiver
hollywood you bum
stick to instagram marquise
fuck you hollywood
cant believe we just lost a drive to cramps in the biggest game of the year hollywood wtf
how the hell did he regress so much when was actually healthy this year
hollywood brown needs to just become a role player
cut hollywood i dont even care dude is fuckin garbage
cut him
marquise bust brown
marquise brown does not deserve to be on this team next season
marquise browns officially a bust
waz the point in having soujas
we dont even have the luxury of benching brown because who the fuck else is there
whelp time to find hollywoods replacement
marquise brown is ass

1 injury
2 roman gets pass happy with a backup qb
3 marquis drops the ball

yep its 2020
bench brown i dont wanna see this mother fucker again fuckint bumb
bollywood bust
bench that motherfucker im sick of him brown shoulda had that
seriously when can we cut brown he is trash he cant catch anything you can have a ego when you are actually good
hollywood you suck god dammit
wtf happened to marquise seriously he was solid last year
he has to go hes the worst wr on the team and its not close
time to cut brown he just is not good
how the fuck can you become a wr with no hands
this team is the best team i have ever seem at bailing out their opponents
no seriously fuck off marquise
b u s t
we need some better souljas
literally so much bullshit has happened for the browns to be in this game you guys will prevail i have faith
cut brown
shut up baker with the penalties
70 receiver gloves
ravens could have had another two touchdowns fuck
we are trying real hard to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
cry more baker
imagine scoring 34 and that potentially not being enough to win

jesus christ this team is hard to watch so much heartache
i miss lamar
idgaf if hes named hollywood because of his town hes marquise now he just fucked us for the 100th time
im literally going to explode from frustration fucking come on
why does brown refuse to catch the ball
man come on brown 3 drops
whats the point of having souljas if you never use em ever
thinking positive


they score early we got the ball back and the o will put in some work
last year hollywood was our hope now he is more like compton
weak as fuck defense jesus fucking christ
doesnt help that lamar is out and now the defense has left the game
hold to 3 lamar comes back and we win
our defense is so soft
we need a turnover in the worst way right now i can feel the game slipping
who is this announcer opposite of joe tessatore he is god awful
we spend sooooo much money on defense
we are now at the part of the gameday thread where we wish we had mods
we cant stop them nothing our defense can do we are getting eaten alive
defense just getting abused
we dont deserve any sort of playoff appearance
hold
how do you miss that hold
how is that not holding
holding again
fuck this defense
34 points put up and the defense is going to blow itwtf
defense is gassed and being held on every play
there was a massive hold on that fuck this
lol this defense is some fucking pussies straight up they dont wanna tackle and when they do tackle they get hurt shameful to wear purple and black and get run over like this
holding again wouldve been a sack
wow
this defense is sorry af
this team has just let us down so many times this season
welp im embarrassed defense is garbage
this defense has so much money put into it but time and time again it is so anticlutch
if brown has a job next week shame on front office
0 fucking sacks fuck this overpaid defense
the d is fucking pathetic they figured out how to deal with the blitz and yet he keeps sending them
this season is just so heartbreaking its just not worth it anymore
i hate this season
literally see him running and say naw fuck this let me just sit here
man what happened to our defense
you send all those guys and get zero pressure
lamar its time to wipe and come on out now were playing the browns anyways so the shit stain will blend in
i thought we were supposed to be good on defense what the fuck
tiktok fucktards spread all your love and energy to trace right now
horseshit all around were not a playoff team
serious question how many 4th quarter blown leadsgames is it for the season i wanna say 4
someone should black out the speed times of high wr draft prospects seems like speed is basically the only thing they care about which is baffling when you consider the clear two best wr in franchise history werent speed guys
ravens defense doing a one i always job of social distancing from anyone that has the ball
even with a w can we make a special exception to blame hollywood they shouldve still been on the field lmao
need lamar back
i stayed up for this
seriously these announcers are cleveland residents or what fucking pathetic
the defense is gased
i hate to admit it but this is a team of choke artists lamar cant even finish the game because of cramps defense is a wet paper bag brown has what 4 drops
humphrey the only defensive player that shouldnt feel completely embarrassed
cramps lmao its over
lamar still gone thats a fucking wrap

fuck this season
come trace win please
3rd string qb sure lets throw it every down
stop letting mcsorley throw our run game has been working we have a backup fucking run
what the fuck roman
why is marquise on the field
do roman and hollywood work for the fucking browns now
running the lamar offense with mcsorely

shit routes and hope for some magic from your qb
this team literally is nothing without lamar the cracks in our foundation show when they dont have to respect the qb run
if the bengals ever draft an oline and the steelers find a replacement for rapeburger the ravens could very easily have a stretch as the worst team in the division for quite a while
run run run
alexa play trace mcsorely
lamar taking the steamiest shit ever
bro im not gonna lie to yall i think lamar may be pulling a paul pierce and he has the shits or is sick
okay run the clock get it down to the absolute bottom tucker can make it from here boys we are fucking so lucky
holy fucking shit 2020 can get fucked
omfg mcsorley hurt his knee
this field is shit
lamar holy fuck
shit stains and all
lamar one play to save the world please bby
this field is fucking rigged
bro wtf is happening rn
this is like wwf shit
that timing is perfect
oh my god
fuck the browns and their shit ass garbage field what a piece of shit organization
sam koch 77 as a passer
lamar save us please
just fucking let tucker try it fuck
convinced we made a deal with tge devil last year with all this bs this year
this feels like some ole wwe smack down ass drama
this is so dramatic
this whole game is a movie atp
why didnt they call a time out if they knew he was coming back
lamar please we need this 1st down please
if lamar converts this first down i will scream
nfl needs a new script writer
lamar i fucking ride for you but you couldnt have come out one play earlier jfc
the absolute worst play call there
lamar from the top rope
this is a cinematic masterpiece
craziest shit i have seen in my life
the legend of lamar jackson is absurd
where your soulja jokes now you negative whiny fucks
holyyyyyyyy ffffffuuuuckkk
as soon as i saw him throw that ball to hollywood my heart stopped
this is like a goddam movie
thats my quaterback
what a 180 degrees turn of emotions omg
lamar went to the bathroom to pray to jesus
trace mcsorleys knee died for lamar to take a dump
big boy football
big boy football
jk dobbins has been the highlight of this season
what even is this game
im laughing my ass off by myself rn hollywood actually came thru
by gawd thats lamar jacksons
the defense better bring the pain this drive
this fucking game
dobbins is a big boy no lil boy

lamar is a super hero
ok but like this defense has to prevent a touchdown now
dobbins is a fucking man
wtf tv show am i watching
also shoutout trace and snead for that 3 and 10 completion to keep that drive going
defense nows the time step up you have to
superman is in the building
this game has aged me 30 years now
lamar missing 7 tears acl lamar suddenly appears and 15 makes a catch wtf is this
that was some mythical shit
best play of his career idc
i swear if the defense cant stop them on one fucking drive
holy shit lamar outta the lockers like han covering luke hollywood uses the goddamn force ravens hit that exhaust port and kaboom

i almost woke up my nephew holy shit what a fucking play
defense

please

i beg you

nut the fuck up
please d please
jesus man this game is fucking ridiculous
defense how are you this bad
someone please try to blame this on lamar please
man we just need to get a million corners next year
actually probably a good thing that he scored there they were gonna score anyway
way to earn that paycheck marlon
how can you defend wink anymore sorry but this is not defensible
they got a touchdown in like 50 seconds you got to be fucking kidding me
our secondary is depleted
i really cant stand baker mayfield what an arrogant prick
if this goes to ot and we are on defense just chalk it as a loss
it took 5 plays for the browns to score a td
well lamar is back so good news
lmao marlon might as well not have tried
thats the sorriest d ive ever seen at least we got time to drive and win it
marlon what the fuck kind of angle is that to tackle someone
we cant beat the chiefs anyway with this defense
knew it was too much time brown should have took a knee at the 1 yard line
marlon quit
defense gave up
this game is amazing though sucks my blood pressure high asf though
defense needs to run laps until sunday fuck these loweffort losers
you guys nutty we are on like our 3rd string cb
go for two and end this already jesus this is terrible
whatever voodoo that stops this team from being great on both sides at the same time needs to end
i want tucker to nail a 55 yarder for the win
plenty of time to get into tuckers range
alright lets go win this game please lamar and tuck
defense looks completely uninspired
just dont feel too bad we got fucked by reffs earlier
grew up never really having to worry about the d minus a few exceptionslike that new years eve bengals game but this this worries me
whether we win or lose lj8 is a goddamn stud and everything we have on offense
run tucker sleep please
who gives a fuck what lebron tweets
give it to tucker within 5 yards of the 40
why to why
im gonna throw up
im gonna build him a golden bathroom with 5 toilets and all the modern facilities if lamar takes us to the promised land
harbaugh doesnt fucking learnkeep the to
mandrews
look at lamar man so inspirational
dont get the timeout from john
boys i think im going to die
chest is pounding
lj finishes this drive and he shuts up a lot of twitter users and talk show analysts
you guys have justin tucker this game should be in the bag as long as you get inside the 40 yard line
palms sweaty

moms spaghetti
jtuck time
in tucker we trust
yesessss
fuck yeahhhhhhh
justin ice in my veins tucker
buying some rofo chicken tomorrow god bless jtuck
game of the year
fuck the brownsssssss
tucker got a nice long leg
thats my fucking goat
this game about killed me we got some major shit to figure out
lamar wins a big game you like that you media talking heads
tucker deserves flaccos 2012 salary
i will have tuckers babies
you love to fucking see it
fuck you browns yeah
my heart i cant do this anymore
im going to have a fucking heart attack what the fucking fuck
i want to have tuckers babies
lets here some more about about justin fucking tucker
this was by far the most eemotinal ravens game i love you guys holy fuck
jackson attacking tucker like that was adorable
no porn has ever looked as good as tucker kicking that 55 yarder
lamar clutched the living fuck out of this game man amazing plays this game
havent posted all night but fuck yeah

lamars throws may not be the prettiest but damn its clutch

edit arm comment is about td and getting the goat in range
hahahaah
jesus fuck
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

that just made me richer
what a game
we going 115 we making our super bowl run lets fucking go
make it 47
i hate this last play goofball shit that the nfl still allows it shouldnt happen
sigh safety

classic call
this has to be one of the best regular season games ive ever seen
baker better get to work cleaning up that stadium
ravens vs browns spread ravens 3 ravens vs browns overunder 455 points ravens vs browns money line ravens 170 browns 150
i need an ambulance
game of the fucking year

one of the most insane games ive seen
hahaha and a safety
god damn that was a game i wish the browns would go back to sucking
i cant watch football anymore
justin tucker
nothing i love seeing more than sad browns fans
baker is such a little bitch
fuck lebron james too
fuck the gop for refusing to issue stimulus checks
jesus christ this pass blocking wont even allow lamar to execute a simple drop back
these refs and these bullshit calls gonna help the browns win how did judon get a roughing the passer penalty when mayfield still had the ball he was sacked
you aint lamar dude
greg roman just gave a huge middle finger to the entire team
the entire nfl fan base and league will tell you that its impossible to run your way to a bowl i believe we can do it
we cant win every drive guys browns are 93 theyre a good team
bruh change you cleats jesus fucking christ
roman has got to go abandon what works immediately then 2 straight run plays when they need 21 yards for a first good riddance
i havent hated a member of the organization like roman in a very long time
biggest adjustment going into the half needs to be changing these fucking cleats thenjummediately firing greg roman
more sacks than pass attempts lmao
im prepared for roman to kneel the half out that cuck weasel fuck lmfao
guys it was clearly in bounds shut the hell up about it we have our timeout now
hunts second foot was out absolute horseshit
goin for two here

how the fuck is steve levy the lead announcer on mnf hes atrocious every single week
call a damn hold for fucks sake
yall remember 3938 in pitt feels like that
plenty of time ya flip flops
removed
lebron no
lamar has ice in his fucking veins
lamar in mvp form
marquise hollywood brown is now starring in breshad perriman 2 electric boogaloo
the espn female presenter looks like bon jovi in the 80s
he was out
damn my dad for getting me into this sport watch football to escape real life

this shit is 100x worse than my life
holy shit why the fuck are there so many people there 300k dead

stay classy ohio
roman why the fuck did you run it twice on 20 to go
wide open cant blame roman
were playing white on purple uni
ugly ass drive but points are points i guess
was that the seahawks 4th down play from last year

either way good drive now get lamar new cleats lol
so tired of these lame ass penalties getting called
lets be real the only bad call was the one on judon both pis were legit sucks but the ravens do this all the time
chiefs fan here fuck baker hope yall smash his ass tonight
why the fuck would you run three consecutive pass plays how are these people employed
lmao attempted murderer myles garrett is their man of the year nominee
once again we pay too much money for our defense to be this ass lead the league in money spent on d but what do we have for it
im sorry but elliott kinda sucks
lamar needs to change his cleats
first play we fucking pass what is roman thinking
holy fuck espn that hollywood shade was worth the broadcast
hes out of bounds didnt get 2 feet in
im enjoying the fuck out of this game this is a a good game of football im glad
defense needs to stepup and crack some skulls

wink your zone isnt working scheme it up
fucking christ lamar thats bad
our receivers rarely get open but lamar misses them too often when they do actually get open
defense bout to bail us out t r u z z
two receivers butt ass naked gotta make that throw man
we all knew they were going to get that 4th classic ravens its a given really
had no idea you could challenge for 12 men on the field dont really like that regardless of this outcome
uhh lamar has to shit give him a break
and lamar is questionable to return with cramps it never fucking ends
how was there no hold called there on their o line middle rush was gettin bear hugged
i dont see how we can pull this off without lamar on the field
baker is like that coachs son who expects favorable treatment constantly
get a real wr1 next year when youre watching the post season on the couch
lamar bro where are u
i cant wait until we cut marquise brown and he becomes a superstar somewhere else
game over
the offense needs to click and the secondary needs to play better than last week
can we atleast minimize the stupid flags on offense today im so tired of the extra man on the field calls every single damn game time and time again they prove to be drive killers snapping needs to be on point today how many times do we almost fumble a snap atleast once game it seems like
i dont know what to do with my hands
hoping to see that sweet sweet lamar to mandrews connection in full force tonight
lets run the table
this is gonna sound sad but im so anxious i feel like im getting dressed for my first jv basketball game again lmao
the black keys and the ravens are a good mix
this is the first game ive been able to watch in like a month finally
mp juiceman monster game tonight please
peters has not been good in the second half of the season so far i hope he makes a big play tonight
browns fans 100 years from now

my grandfather was alive when we didnt have a team for 2 years and he said thats why we havent been to the playoffs yet
pernell
pressure on the qb who is team
embarrassing
if thats all they get out of a trick play im calling it a win
its not right that some stadiums can have 12000 fans and others cant have any maybe im just bitter
yes a clean tackle by the secondary
am i crazy or is there something off with the camera angle
outside of the corners every ravens defensive player is pretty ass in coverage
why dont we do play action on offense
first drives are the exception yall theyre often scripted and full of new looks
fuck

not ideal but we got this
that defense was pathetic
its ok lets get it back
thats fine lamar about to go off
ugh fuck thats some bad luck two great strip tackles and we dont recover
not too worried by that drive they clearly had a very scripted first drive i think the next drive will be very telling
its okay we havent seen the offense yet
screens meant to attack board specifically could be a long night theyre going to try to make us a one dimensional passing team fast
fucking tissue paper defense
sidenote that was a really good nba on espn commercial
did they even have a 3rd down serious question
please use dobbins
what the ever loving shit was that

edit not the animation that was cool
greg roman sucks
its sad the state of our pass rush we used to be such a scary front 7 and now we got pussies in the front who cant escape even old man suggs shadow

suggs would have 6 sacks on this d and hes fucking nearing 40
lmao weak ass play
the heck was that
lamar just needs to play his game tonight

first play flea flicker
convinced we are the only team that cant complete trick plays either some fuckery happens with the refs or we just blow it
do yall not realize that play was shit because our recievers cant get open
i thought we had thrown a pick or fumbles it by everyones reaction in here with that first play yall are unbelievable sheesh
wow i was sure that was gonna be on us lmao
lamar has to always bail out this shitty play calling
dobbins stunting on osu and browns fans will fulfill my deepest desires
slippety ass field
free the elf
this team is incredibly sloppy its very unharbaughlike this late in the season
this offense is so jv lol
roman leaving his mark on this offence
more pathetic offense
ay hollywood is here
yeah thats just a bit of pi just a little
the torrey smith special
flashbacks to that classic flacco to smith connection
joe flacco is back baby
that was a good move by brown to draw that on a questionable throw
lol how tf do you pi that bad
what the fuck is their field
duvernay and lamar both slipped on this field
god bless this speedyboi
man imagine this offense without lamar
lamar just give me the damn ball ill do it myself
lamar needs to change his cleats asap every damn play hes slipping gonna break his own ankle
honest to god it feels like the announcers are trying to jinx us fk off
good to see us using dobbins first drive
lamaaaaaaaaa
lamar td
run lamar run
belee dat
lets goooo
blocking was perfect on that run lets go
stuntin
wooooooo
lets gooooo
if thats how the game goes might be a 10 pass attempt type of night for us
the difference between bozeman when pass blocking and pulling might be the biggest skill discrepancy in the nfl
d has to step up now
we are lucky they didnt call andrew his foot was beyond the line of scrimmage
just sing tuck cooking isnt your passion its opera with royal farms
way to respond lets go defense now
jesus who makes these graphics for espn some poor intern
bills stadium would be more lit than the browns
lmao even at limited capacity they all pack in the center of each section cleveland public education at work
checks rnfl thread


dont go there guys jesus christ
just keep forcing fumbles and well pick one up eventually
bit of a weak call there but clark lost the ball
bro thats fucking soft wtf
are you fucking kidding me
bullshit
personal foul tackling the qb
why was that roughing the passer
refs are fucking us already lol
what the fuck
how is that roughing the passer what
thats a bad roughing
ravens football
8 ff holy shit
that was a tackle how else are you supposed to do that
we cant catch a damn break
fuck the refs
marlon just pushed it right back to him great job bruh
refs get worse and worse each week
fuck these browns and fuck these refs
marlon pushed it back under landry fuck
how the fuck is that clevelands ball
what reffing is this
if campbell has the ball its suppose to be our ball right
thats straight bullshit
about to force 99 fumbles and not recover any of them
ravens vs the ugly uniforms and zebras wtf are these calls
not even worried at this rate well get 10 ff tn
gonna be a ref game
these fucking refs man
seriously though how in the hell do you give judon roughing the passer there
rigged
the fix is in yall

the refs are so against omgggggg
i dont like to complain about the refs but my god this drive is nothing without them
these refs are dogshit now wonder they love the browns
are you gonna tell us its not rigged
refs are fuccing us without lube
oh cool
ah come on
refball at its finest
these are such weak ass calls
you literally cant do anything on defense
he made a play on the ball what the fuck
ight imma need judon to take the ref the fuck out idc
he literally gave him a tiny ass touch fuck off
fire the refs kick em out of the league all the refs suck im every game
my head already hurts
what are these calls tonight
im about to go to footlocker and start throwing hands
the last 5 force fumbles in a row have either bounced out of bounds or right back into the hands of the offensive player god hates us right now
god fuck these refs
scripted sports nothing new
are we gonna see a penalty every other play tonight
if we lose this game i bet its because of all the ref bs pass interferences refs and browns vs ravens
how come everything we do is always a fucking foul is it possible to get 1 fairly reffed game
you cant saw the nfl loves the ravens after these garbage cans
browns literally just trying to get flags
we just got away with a mean ass offsides
these fucks and going for it on 4th
kinda wish they went for it lmao
lol baker commercial
these refs are throwing so many flags im getting heated even when its on the browns
just wanted to drop by and scream fuck these fucking refs fuuuucckkkkkkkk
ball dont lie
karma for that 4th down pi call
boi you aint no justin tucker
lmaoooo fuck the browns
love tucker
you suck lololol
ball dont lie bitch
should have gone for it
as soon i as i say codey parkeys name i screamed miss
we only had one drive this whole quarter lol
browns didnt have any gimmicks but the refs helped them a bunch that drivefeeling good about our defense with all the ffs and qb hits
hold this massive l parkey haaahahaha
maybe they should have actually gone for it on 4th and 8
bad throw bad play call and a drop
alright love ya lamar but throw the damn ball
we literally cant pass it against the depleted browns secondary roman is gonna get fired after this game
lol theres the fucking illegal shift like clockwork
seriously wtf is with his cleats
change your cleats i beg
fuck greg roman
i swear to god cleveland if your shitty field injures lamar
cleveland such a dysfunctional org that even the field sucks

goddam
lamar get some new cleats please
ah yes love our passing schemes what tf is a quick slant
i would have turned off the game if they called for contact on that fair catch
if i were gus id request a trade this is fucking unreal we dont give him the ball
run the fucking ball greg
oh good more commercials
phillips is getting worked
please get ole miss oc enough of this uncreative dinosaur play calling
all i want for christmas is a run play
run the fucking ball
around 55 yards in penalties so far its the second quarter yikes
man all these flags what the fuck
fuck this ref
these refs are going to be the stars of the game
the refs make games unwatchable
this team and the flags either we are the most undisciplined team in the league or the refs absolutely hate us or both
throw roman out of a helicopter over a north korean prison camp with a kim jong un sucks shirt
this is laughable wont even show the penalty replay
fire greg roman now
browns should kneel every play theyll get to the redzone with penalties
refs plan
marlon
wouldve loved to see marlo peters with reed
fuck me have fuckin james urban call the plays or some shit

whoever the qb coach is
we are so undisciplined lmfao
good stop
good job d
marlon humphrey is the best corner in the league
marvin the only one out there fucking trying
good stop by the d need to convert on this drive coming up
fake punt

edit nvm
baker a tight end playing qb thats how it works right
he could have ran for that first lol
with the fake out
smart play
proche clutch
lets go ole greg free dobbins
baker playing scared
defense woke up which means offense will go to sleep now
so on the screen pass im not going the lie i said holding finally then i realized
greg please dont call 3 pass plays
good call proche
whats wrong with the offense an answer in 3 acts

1 there is one quality receiving threat on the team

2 the oc is a crappy passing game designer

3 the qb is not an elite enough passer to overcome 1 and 2
free dobbins
as soon as we run we get 10 yards maybe we should abandon it
for what its worth the defense definitely looks better than they did the first drive hope they can keep it up and we go back to running
man of the yearwho tried to kill a man on the football field
so does that cancel out him hitting another player with a helmet
look at all the good miles garret did by the way it was a year ago today he smashed mason rudolphs head in with his own helmet back to you jan lmao
gus bus jk we need more of this
thank god roman looks to this sub for playcalls
okay espn can we stop suckibg off garrett for 5 minutes and call the game
dobbins aka n o o d l e m a n
runs yards weird
love that they are calling out garretts bs
freedobbins
give dobbins 40 carries
dobbins with an entourage lol
pound the rock jk fuck yeah
dobbins averaging 12 ypc
trash field is trash
oh yes i like you jk
jk lets goooooo
wtf did the browns put on that field
tf is on this field dude
fire the grounds team
switch cleats
holy shit dobbins
what is this slipping theyre even talking about it now
is the field greased in butter
gtfo garrett
this field is disney on ice
did they spread butter on the fucking field cheating fucking dogs
the ravens and having good rbs with 27 name a better duo
this surface is in shambles
i thought dobbins was down 3 separate times on that run lol what a beast
poverty franchise with a poverty field
putting tape labelled dobbins on top of my rice jersey
jk dobbins making plays while wearing 27 makes me feel certain feelings
baker must be doing some serious carpet cleaning in his home why is it so slick
enter willie snead
the field was made by slip n slide
l freaky
lamar fast
backs receivers and oline all blocking their tails off
i better see 0 more pass plays
draft kings lady has a head like a chinese new year dragon
run run run ravens football
wholesome
damn that sweep with duvernay had td written all over it
fuck yesss
lamar having fun game is over
beep beep
harbs just needed a hug
all aboard the gus bus next stop the dog pound to adopt some more children
lets go gus
good things happen when we run the ball
ball dont lie
run the ball good things happen
wait running the ball worked
lol hollywood just steps out of the way
i really like the deception of using gus to the outside

gus the bus crashing through
the awareness to stretch great play
i love the gus busssss
clear touchdown
its in fuck you announcers
yall hearing 7 nation army lmao
the wheels on the gus go round and round
good drive keep running the fucking ball
runtheball
just run it down their fucking throats all game
i said gr is gonna go 3 and out and he ran almost every play is saying that the key
this team reminds me of 2018 so much its kinda weird lol
roman calling run plays what a concept
was garrett out for the remainder of that drive
run the damn ball
can we franchise tag edwards
cleveland browns may have a better record but theyre still the little brother of the division
fucks sake
come on d
pathetic defense
i dont have any stats to back me up but bad things happen when we play zone way more than when we play man to man
peters was in a tough spot there either way if he runs with the deep route they have it underneath someone blew an assignment
deshon elliott is an automatic first down in coverage you hate to see it
stop playing zone wtf
fuck
hell with it respond back
cannot give them this ball back
i really dont understand our defensive strategy tonight
defense cannot implode like that but its clear to this point that the offense is going to win us this game take all 4 minutes here double up after the half opportunity is being presented
i wish they would focus on tackling instead of trying to strip the ball every time
offense shows up defense doesnt defense shows up offense doesnt always something with this team
score here and again after half and were up 2 scores halfway thru the 3rd
it could be worse lets get points here
fucking hell lamar take you rcleats off
bro what the fuck is with this slipping
fucking change the cleats
oh my god someone get lamar new cleats
get lamar new cleats right now
time out change cleats
bring out the snow shoes fuck
if i die just know fuck greg roman
what the fuck is happening with his shoes holy shit
browns ground keeper was compromised
change your cleats man
get that man different cleats
fuck greg roman
why dont you just punt it roman if youre gonna fucking bend over and take it in the ass like that fucking absolute clown
pathetic coaching staff doesnt trust the players to get out of 2nd and longs
my man is heated
getting 5 yards a carry and we bootleg on first down
love that run game but 14 yards passing is an actual joke lamar cant move right no one is open pass pro run blocking its a bad situation on that front
the greg roman special have 1 good year then be shit 49ers bills now us
browns did us a favor by not taking a timeout there
and this is why having zero passing offense will kill you took a 11 yard sack because lamar fell and then had to run two give up plays the good nfl teams wouldnt have done that
no matter what happens this game is in the hands of greg fucking roman
we pass when we need to run then run when we need to pass what the fuck
can lamar just ignore roman and call his own plays
moron commentator looks like a well manicured field

like this dork has ever dealt with trash turf
the thing thats so frustrating is how we seem to struggle doing stuff that other teams do all game slants hitch routes drags etc plays feel like a mad scramble to even get a positive yard
man would of been a shame to call the same plays the browns couldnt stop the previous two drives
give him some fucking cleats please
harbaugh needs to either get in romans ass or start calling plays himself
im a little torn i obviously want to make the playoffs but if this team is at their best they still have no chance against the chiefs we need serious changes to the offense this wont do it if the goal is to win it all
justice hill is all hustle
fire groundscrew holy shit
jesus shon
deshone is a big hitter
deshon elliott plays like a mf raven
just witnessed a car accident on the field
goddamn what a hit by joker
why cant we fucking tackle
i cannot believe we havent turned any of these chances into turnovers yet
gotta make that play yannick
fuck baker lmao
baker is such a whiny bitch
baker whining
espn is disgustingly bad at showing replays
og shit ill take it
judon and yannick balling out things you love to see
judon lit his ass up again
i could watch these slow motion hits on baker mixed with him looking like vince mcmahon on repeat for 45 mins to trance music
2 to and about 1 minute lets put up at least 3 boys
this fuck ass hoe saying not grounding cause judon his arm replay shows him rocketing the ball on his lmaoooo
judo finally playing like its a contract year
lo key how tf did he not fumble
no stupid special teams penalities right now please
go film a commercial baker mayfield stop crying
55 yds 2 timeouts lets get something here boys
lets get 3
i think there are more baker progressive commercials than flos
jt get that leg warm my boy
nice fuck you baker
we cannot piss this away
td here and on then on opening drive of the 2nd half and then hays in the barn
mark ingram doing work in that tide commercial
im scared philips is my boy at guard but idk if i trust him in obvious pass situations like this
credit to our defence they were incredible on that drive hope our offence can get us some points or at least bleed the clock and i hope
lj changed his damn shoes
i hate liberty mutual commercials more than anything else
i think we can all agree that roman is a dumbass i just wanna know why harbaugh doesnt step in and say hey thats fucking stupid no were not gonna throw on first down and then run on second and long
come on offense dont fuck this up gro
member week 1 against the browns when we scored a td in like the last 27 seconds just before the half
would have been nice if lamar got new cleats after that last drive
is this our first time playing in cleveland
between lamar and deshun watson i dont think ive seen an offense let there qb down more the oline the plays the receivers just awful
new cleats secured
come on soulja
call me crazy but run it use the timeouts and get the field goal
brown is trash wheres andrews
typical marquise
can we please get lamar a receiver in the offseason
sojas only catch when they are wide open
8 passing yards
lamar jackson is an elite nfl quarterback
this team needs a receiver lets be honest
mark andrews is alive
dont ever fucking doubt lamar and mandrews
we should honestly trade marquise for a 2nd like hurst
hollywood is so fucking small lmao
lamar and andrews my goddd
lamar putting the team on his back
me oh man just throwing it away

mark andrews hahah you thought
oh
lort
lamar
mandrews
damn lamar can catch his own passes better than brown can
yessssssss and a little wall ball there to celebrate
thats my fucking qb
thats right lj spike that ball into the bleachers hell yes
no more slipping
i might name my kid lamar at this rate
no receivers so you gotta do it yourself
thats my fucking boy ask not what lamar can do for you ask what you can fucking do for lamar jackson

shoutout to our only soulja big marc
and people really think lamar is the problem smdh
easy money
lamar putting the mfer team on his back right now
if we get 2 good receivers next year we will be unstoppable
lamar big mad
even browns players are slipping this field is trash
new cleats yes
lamar is jesus
these announcers are so dumb in what world have the browns had a better first half
if lamar doesnt change his cleats he doesnt escape to make that throw to andrews

the fact that a professional football team cant figure out the best cleats for their starting qb before the game starts is embarrassing
lamar is such a freak its so fun
these hoes are being stunted on
we getting hot at the right
sometimes i wonder what the hell peters is doing
browns fans are pure trash im proud of my ban tonight the shit they say about lamar
we have absolutely clobbered him today some old school shit
okay defence its time to end the game with 100 sacks on mayfield also my man soulja brown get your shit together dude
wtf is clark doing
hope he aint concussed
that was kinda funny
swear to god you better not have concussed yourself
why do we that no rush at all on hail mary plays
chuck watch out for that post
do berman and al michaels have the same hair stylist
gotta make it a two score game this drive and never look back lets go boys
flea flicker to start the 1st lets see a hook and ladder roman
the soulja caught it and fought for extra yards noice
fucking lamar is a boss
he is absolutely wild
i think lamar likes his new shoes
l freaky
savage
these announcers are savage lmaooooo
thats my qb
fuck throwing we running
llama
here we gooooo
vintage jackson i love it
d get a turnover and end this shit
he is houdini
i vote to abolish the forward pass
greg roman sticking with the run fuck yes
lets get it
ravens football baby
gus bus ez money
lamar is a beast dude wow
what a run gus baby
d opened up wider than mia khalifas legs
freaky g into the endzone
this this i like
roman woke up
okay every drive where we run the ball we score every drive where we start throwing for 3 downs we dont this is not rocket science if we do this for the rest of the year we can win a lot
almost bengalsesque on that juke
browns gonna brown
this is fucking amazing this is what our run offense should be doing
cant stop wont stop
fuck the browns
hey look running the ball equals success
he is electric
run ball
looks like last year
imagine thinking gus edwards is a system back in 2020
this jackson guy is pretty good
browns game thread is having a meltdown lol
i know our pass game is dogshit but these last two weeks theyve been shredding teams in the run
this is a bad team we need to continue to father them
lets fucking go
i took a good luck dab and hoped wed run down their mouth and score opening drive to go up two scores

i am very happy right now
we are literally navy
it would be amazing if we got a sack
gus is a really good running back
so fire gro back the fuck up and admit he did what we all asked
come on defense im begging you just get a fucking stop
that gus edwards run gave me an erection
need a stop here remind these punk asses theyre still the browns
were due a strip sack
someone stop this lame duck story no one cares
we need to start talking about chuck clarks poor coverage this year
i wonder how browns fans are feeling they cant blame the refs
god espn is so terrible
no dumb penalties and bone head plays
i miss calais
chuck clark is boo boo in coverage
why do our pass rushers always fall over
we defended a screen pass well
at least they stopped that potential screen
ravens have made excellent adjustments on d to the naked boot and screen game very nice to see
lj fort is lowkey really nice

edit that didnt age well
peters man stop playing 10yds off
why the fuck is fort covering hunt jfc
peters might as well play 50 yards off they get those short passes every time
he stepped out
looks like its all going to be on lamar today the defense just isnt stepping up
thats one foot in
how you know what theyre doing and no one does a thing really looked him down the whole time drop a safety to help him damn
weak defense
come on defense dont give the browns life
that was out of bounds no
our defense is really giving them life right now
fucking defense let them back into the game immediately
lmao
how did cody parkey get a job back again
afcn shootout wtf is this
double doinker cant even doink
welp offense looks like youre the good one tonight
wish wed play malik more
pass rush has to get home at some point or they will keep up with us
i take tucker for granted way too much pay him whatever it takes to keep him a raven for life
nothing like watching deshon elliott shoot the gapbehind the goal line
this defense needs a fuckin turnover do something man
boykin sighting
miles boykin sighting
good catch miles
boykin and hollywood caught a pass on the same day
lamar runs like a greased pig cant touch him
he had a rhythm im so hype rn
mandrews
i know theyre mad that lamar is beating them and desperately want to hit him but that hit didnt even look that bad
mandrews is clutch
at least it wasnt an illegal formation
how was that pass to andrews too easy it was an extremely tight window throw could have been picked off if an inch different the pocket was starting to creep in on lamars heels as well he didnt have a ton of room to step into the throw it was an excellent play by lamar
jackson you had him mannnnnnnnn
lamar has just put too much air on some of those this year
two fucking awful throws in a row
defense going to have to stop being little bitches here
smh we couldve had a 1d lamar cmon you gotta make that
defense better show up
the penalty really killed all of our momentum
lamar really loves to give guys like stephen a smith fodder for criticism good god
guys im out of beer send help
his inaccuracies are related to a lack of confidence imo hes less confident in his receivers less confident in his oline and unfortunately its resulting in less confidence in himself hes in his head this year
tyussssss lets goooo
lets gooooooooooo
woooo
bowser
yooo decosta max extension bowserrrrrrrrr
the browns deserve this lets go
tyus bowser
i never realized how much i love and missed seeing the sad fans in the stands
bowser read this reddit thread and said fuck yall i got this
bowser judonpay dis man
fucking lamar playing 3 d chess he overthrows to get the damn ball on the 1 yard line
bowser
im gonna miss bowser when some team inevitably pays too much for him
lets fucking goooooooooooooo told yall muthafuckas the d was coming up
oh boy oh boy
going for two here

lol steve levy is terrible
the parking lot is 95 empty but browns fans area already trying to get ahead of the line to get home
someone do the heimlich faker mayfield is choking
noooooo jt blocked
how dare they
do it again baker
not on tuck just good st there
still 14 point lead
shitty blocking shitty shitty shitty blocking
arent you not allowed to touch the long snapper morgan cox just got hit on the extra point
give jk his tds
koch with the tackle
foot on their throat lets go
waiting for 12 this sub to ask us to fire morgan cox
casual stroll into the end zone because this shit is easy

ez pz
bowser gets my vote for most improved this year ferguson has flashed but bowser has really come into his own
kick 6 revenge eh
the football gods take and they give
i love always having good lbs
the browns are rattled
scouting report nick chubb cuts it back every single time they run that zone stretch
was hoping bowser would rack up the sacks this season but instead hes become a monster in pass defense not complaining though
start the excuse train lol
is it that hard to tackle landry damn
where were the hands to the face
no its where they initiate not where they land
so landry can drive our guy down by the head
ravens and dumb penalties name a better combo
at this rate i expect jimmy smith to hurt his hand hitting the snooze button on his alarm clock
defense has done a pretty decent job of handling chubb this far all things considered but man theyve struggled with everything else especially discipline
so we win out and its 100 we get in
gamethreads

1 football talk

99 hot gas
just get a stop here and out up 7 more
imma need at least 10 moire points before i believe this is a win
isnt gimpy considered a derogatory term thats the second time the announcer has said it
shit that sucks dont want to see that
we gotta make those fucking sacks
how did elliot whiff could have destroyed him
how do we miss these sacks
clown ass tackling all night long
this may sound controversial but i dont think were very good at sacking
we cant fuckin tackle
all elliot had to do was make that sack fuck
have we gotten these guys off the field today holy fuck
aaand theres the pose arms out palms up

play the game baker wipe your tears
how is that not an obvious pick play
hes pointing at the 12 men guys
yo this harris dude is playing great
dawg press them
since when can you challenge penalties
the entire bench is on the field
how do you play double team landry until its on a 4th down
did jimmy smith get hurt somewhere
im just getting home from work and loving the score so far keep it going ravens foot on the gas
one stop could have really made things hard on cleveland instead we just let them pick up 812 yards a play its demoralizing
at least our defense is giving the offense a rest
sorry where is lamar
lamar jackson has diarrhea
oh great i hope lamar is ok that worries me he is in the locker room
lamar had to drop a deuce ms sideline reporter
lamar going doodoo
lamar gone for a dump
where is ja
bruhllama got the shits lol
so why is lamar in the locker room
those on delayed streams they just announced lamar went into the clubhouse and hasnt come back for the whole browns drive mcsorely is not warming up
twitter is going to look at that 15 man penalty as primary evidence that the refs favor baltimore lmfao
lamar didnt want to fart in front of anyone
lamar hold it in like i did at subway as a teen
hes taking a shit
theyre going to go for it on every 4th at this point
good shit defense
if mcsorley has to check in its pretty much a guaranteed 70 yard td to hollywood
of course hes wide open
bruh left him wide ass open
pathetic
unfucking believable
oh no marcus peters is down
guys i guarantee you we would rather have marcus not hurt then what looks like just happened
holy shit peters
ive been bitching about our soft ass secondary for weeks and i kept getting dogged for it by people saying we have statistically speaking one of the best in the league stats be damned watch the fucking games this defence has been mediocre
have such a lovehate relationship with peters his lows are just so low
probably acting hurt because he blew the damn td
our 4th down defense has been an anomaly tonight how have we let them get it every time
the offense absolutely must answer with points
the defense cannot stop anything this is so pathetic
shit lamar cramps
peters been a liability for a while though
fucking luckbox bullshit
of course that would happen
oh yeah just from that alone i have a horrible feeling
we would get fucked like this man

marquise brown is absolute horseshit
lol fuck this season
whats the point of having souljas if you never use em
cut his ass right now he sucks
why the fuck is mcsorely out there

also what the fuck brown you had no business dropping that
brown is done dude why is he still out there
thats all folks defense aint stopping shit all night
we couldve had ridley in 2018
lmaooo hollywood gtfour bad
trace could walk the ball up to hollywood and hand it to him and hed still drop it
cut brown
marquise is a total bum
honestly hollywood shouldnt be on the field at all
were about to choke a 2 td lead no fucking way
lamar is dropping the browns off at the super bowl in more ways than one
hollywood on the fuckin d list right now
delete marquis
marquise brown is ass
what the actual fuck
hollywood more like skid row
what a fucking bum wow brown is so fuss disappointing
soulja
fire roman run the fucking ball
peyton manning literally couldnt throw it any better and you drop it
defense could grow a set of balls here but thats prob to much to ask for
how many drops has he had this year
this has completely deflated my sails for this game i feel like i just wasted my entire night now
marquise sucks no idea what people see in him
if you cant catch youll get replaced by someone who can but not if you play for the ravens
why can we never draft good receivers

this team is cursed at the wr position
ive stopped tryna defend his ass weeks ago now i actually need him on the bench
baker reminds me of the white guy in the neighborhood sitcom
momma did raise a wuss
baker such a bitch
marquise cant be defended anymore dude is a liability
at this point i just want the suffering to end
mayfield cries more than philip rivers and thats saying something
my god baker your such a little cunt
breshad perriwood
blitz on 2nd but not on 3rd downswtf
use ya souljas
need defense to do something this is embarrassing
slant flat routes cant defend it still
just fucking fade me now
this defense cant get a stop
i dont think lamar was just pooping
we gunna blow this huh
man we need a stop so bad but our defense is gassed
baker is such a fucking bitch boy
brown needs to go to the bench now
it says a lot that the browns backup rb is a better wr than any player on our team
apparently we put levine in at cb before peters came back out
defense cant stop shit damnit man
if we lose this game when we were up by 14jfc hollywood
why is someone wide open every play this shit is so infuriating
we cant stop anything they are doing
oh my god we cant stop them
hes back to wr 15 fuck sake marquise
riddick not afraid to call people tf out lmao
why is this defense so bad
holddddinnng jesus
holding again fucm you refs suck my cock
our defense fucking sucks

defense is fucking done theyre already on the bus
harris is getting burned every play
no fucking hold
blatant hold
that was a massive hold
we are going to choke it away again
cant let them score we may not be able to score again
only hope here is somehow hold them to a fg
this d is so sorry
this is so depressing to watch
lamar come back please
hope the browns go one and done in the playoffs then wait another 18 years for another playoffs appearance to go one and done again
holding
wheres the holding calls
this game was over when we let them convert that last 4th down
theres way too much talent on this defense for it to be this incredibly bad
lamars missed andrews td was big
this defense constantly gets whooped in the ass and they still dont give a shit lmao
manifesting lamar back on the field
dont worry guys theyll just throw a td
every week its the same bullshit trash ass defense stupid penalties injuries and horrible luck
this team needs a serious reset with defensive line wr and a real oc
have we stopped a team on the goal line this year
can we please just get a fucking stop
tackle you dumb fucks
this team is soft as charmin its sad
fuck this defense absolutely disgrace
this season fucking sucks dick
here come all the browns into our thread
brown for blame of the game even if we win
what the fucking fuck
our defensive line is so damn slow i know we play a 34 so they are big guys but damn they cant move at all
this is just getting pathetic
if lamar isnt back this is done
please lj
the team fucking quit what garbage fucking worthless defense what a waste
wow what the fuck is happening

weve become a joke baker mayfield is breaking contain
this is a nightmare
this is fucking shattering
all those shitland fans spreading covid
this man didnt even run just jogs and watches their win fade away
we got this
i tuned in when we were up 14 what the fuck man whenever im watching this team is trash
our defense gave up 35 and media will still blame lamar
well at least i have you all to be miserable with
lamar come back
i fucking hate baker the cunt
playing like this we dont deserve to make the tournament
is holding not a thing anymore
lemme give you a tip trace literally anyone but number 15
brownscrawny ass bum
defense never gets clutch stops they fold every time in the 4th
only way we win is if we drain as much clock as we can and get in tucker range defense cant stop them we cant let them get the ball back
im still on browns 3 dropped passes
dobbins hasnt touched the ball since he scored
its like dean pees is calling the defense again
defense sucks ass
if you are up 14 points late in the 3rd quarter and you lose it is on your oc it almost happened against philly and it might happen again tonight in an offensive scheme that is built for sustaining a lead running the damn ball roman cant sustain a lead of course many things are to blame but i am ready for roman to go
im not crying ur crying
trade brown for a crab cake at the end of the year
no way it is cramping they are saying that to try to keep optimism he is going to return
lamar goes out we start throwing roman are dumb asf
this defense is garbage
incomplete pass on first run for no gain on 2nd and 10
fire greg roman
this team just has way way too many glaring issues
no roman isnt calling this differently
another game another blown lead
snead is the real wr1
nice catch snead
willie snead is the most clutch receiver on our team
willie fucking snead
use as much clock as possible
cant have that dobbins
keep snead duvernay and bryant every other receiver can be traded honestly
flacco played on a torn acl just saying
ok but there has to be something other than cramps happening right like this is literally the season
snead is the mvp this year
just need 3 boys just need 3
mcsorleys gonna pull this off hes gonna be a starter in the league
thank you bradley
run that rock goat for the kick
are you fucking kidding me with this fucking season
roman

are you kidding me

what was that
thats the play call jesus christ
now he is back wtf
are you fucking kidding me
fuck this shitty fucking turf in this shitty fucking stadium
hes back
now lamar shows up what in the actual fuck
if lamar comes back after all of this fml
what is actually going on
this game is so fucking ravens im gonna be sick
am i watching friday night lights right now
this storyline in the mcu is insane
this game is giving me aids
lj is back
finally lamar is back
oh man lamar be the hero the defense needs you to be
fuck you browns turf
oh my god jesus is here
lamar running for the 1st here
bah gawd thats lamars music
if only they could stop the play and call a time out or something
is this the wwe or nfl
what is going on

im going to offer a sacrifice for us to win i wont say what but its important to me
lol pls lamar this would be a story book ending if he can win the game rn
as soon as its no help lamar appears
bah god thats lamar jacksons music
greg roman can fuck off what the fuck is that call
lamar coming out like the undertaker
this is def 4th down territory here
you think lamar gets tackled and shits himself
fuck hope trace is ok wb llamamight be a bit late
so which free agent qb do we pick up now we have no backup now
this is fucking hilarious
come on that timing with lamar is insane
llama is back stunt on these hoes
i cant watch this anymore
wait we still dont have a backup tho
this is nutz
feel like im watching wwe by god thats lamar jacksons music
if lamar pulls this off i may just crytears of joy obviously
oh my god thats lamar jacksons music
im sorry but still bench him
i shit myself for lamar
redemption

lamar from the top rope
lamar is literally goku
oh my god
lmfao marquise is the most jekyll and hyde player ever
marquise officially gets to use hollywood again this week
holy shit

is this wwe wrestling or the nfl what is even happening
i swear if marquise dropped that

i wouldve left him in cleveland he just made up for those drops barely
lamar fucking jackson
151 is still a lot of time tho

we need the d to make a stop
craziest game ever
lamar u unbelievable bro

lets fucking gooooo
hollywoods redemption arc started and completed in 1 game
bro im literally about to throw the fuck up from this game what the fuck is happening it feels like a fever dream
lamar outta nowhere
ohh myyy fucking gooooddd
fuck u hollywood why u gotta do us like that bruhhhhh

lamar mother fucking jackson
i just came
craziest 4th quarter in a while
soulja
the redemption of the year fuck me man my fucking heart
jk all fucking day

what is this game
what a fucking game disney couldnt write this
fuck the browns all my homies hate the browns
he caught the one that counted at least
my eyes are wet nothings gonna beat the mile high miracle but this was close like 60 of that
offense has literally done everything they could possibly do defense please dont fuck this up
goddamn lamar fooled me even
definition of mvp
better than greg jennings in madden 2010
defense has to get a fucking stop
this is some madden got the team on his back shit right now
play like a fucking raven
im gonna have a heart attack
most exciting ravens game since the mile high miracle
lamar is my spirit animal
lamar jackson just wanted yall to remember how important he is to the team lol
biggest play of there careers
lamar just saved the fucking day
craziest game evar
hes just sipping gatorade like i wasnt crying 5 minutes ago wtf
fuck all you haters wanting to replace lamar and harbaugh
browniesget the fuck out of my sub
lol this game is ridiculous
lamar just popped a tylenol and said fuck it
this is the absolute worst game to not have cable for im so confused from tabbing between this thread and the gamecast but its probably better for my heart this way
dobbins is amazing
gentle reminder that we might not even be in this situation had it not been for hollywoods drops props for the big play but dude is a liability dont get rose colored glasses
this game is wild lol
brown heard us yall lol
dude dobbins is hardcore
this shit feels scripted like wwe
this game should be a fuckimg movie
holy hell brown did it guys
someone please dig out that poop out of the toilet and frame it
lamar really took a shit and came back as superman
who gives a fuck if hollywood drops 6 yard passes when he catches the one that matters
lamar came out the bathroom like tf yall doing we were up 14
x200b

lamar looks sick and shivering on the bench
all jokes aside gotta feel good for hollywood i know hes been tough to get behind but good for him still wouldve been nice to catch that 3rd down pass from trace tho
marlon take my fucking energy
if lamar doesnt get a cottonelle sponsorship by tomorrow we riot
defense needs to have a marquise moment to win this
only our soft ass defense can blow this crazy ass game
come on d keep them out of the end zone
this defense makes me want to catch covid
now i see why lamar had to shit this defense does that to you
jesusss
defense cant stop shit
fuck this defense fucking garbage
fucking god damn it defense you had one fucking job
removed
fuck this fucking defense
thats actually best case scenario plenty of time to get in fg range for tucker
horrible play by marlon
this is fucking ridiculous how helpless our defense is right now that shit was effortless for them
fine go down win it with the fg
looks like the ravens cant stop any shit tonight
humphreys looking like a lost kid at walmart out there
marlon that was fucking sad
this is best case scenario they left time for lamar
marlon played that as if he was instructed to let them score quickly
that sucks but you guys can do this 104 for lamar to get this team in fg range and win it
reminds me of chiefsrams two years back
this shit gonna give me a damn heart attack
im not even mad 1 min left 1 timeout with tucker as fg
60 secs to get into fg range for tucker
wink exposed
this will come down to tucker
why are they reviewing this its so clearly obviously a td
this d is suddenly awful damn were unable to just put it all together
tbh hollywood shouldnt have been so excited to finally catch the ball run the clock and let tuck put it away
welp im over it blame of the game is the varsity defense
i knew that miss extra point was an omen of things to come
this defense man is rough
just let it be a touchdown we need the time
defense has all our cap space and still cant do shit
if they go for two yall better ducking stop it
this d absolutely needs a hard reset said it time and fucking time again we need front 7 who are mean with high motors big guys who can bull lines
do we even have a defense out there they cant stop anything we have all pros for what a more expensive shell out there
overtime bitch theres still over a minute on the clock
man one game our offense is good on the other our defensive is good

can we just get one game with both
our secondary got decimated tonight by injury the second we lost jimmy smith we started getting toasted
defense has no fucking heart paid too much for this shit show
offense please
i just have a weird feeling that roman is going to blow this
fuck it offense gonna drive down and score with 0 seconds left so this shitty defense doesnt have the opportunity to fuck up again
need 1 stop to win the game and the defence folds like a cheap suit
42 to 42 the game is now tied at the meaning of life the universe and everything
4242

what is going on tonight
we have given up 341 yards and 95 has been 7 yards or below
lamar i am sending you all of my energy i believe in you man
mark fucking andrews
ten more yards
cmon end this in regulation i am so tired
almost in fg range
go to your guys snead and andrews
we only need 510 yards yeah
alright lets ducking get this pls i wanna go to bed

smoking on that baker pack tonight
ty the best game to watch all season the heart the return i sacrificed for this
fuck the browns lmao
stat padding lmao
game of the year
never in doubt boys
brownies are crying ahahahahahahaha
thank god for the goat
holy shit i love remember the ravens great movie 88
amazing win must win but there is so much shit that needs to be fixed
as much as i hate the browns the football lover in me is happy we have some more competition in the division
marquise 100 got drafted because of who is cousin is and nothing else this is far more embarrassing of a pick than perriman was cut this dude ass so he can go play flag
edc pleeeeease go get golladay or robinson as soon as free agency starts
god cleveland just cant stop complaining about not having an nfl team for like 2 years how long was baltimore without one 20
no one is ever covered when the ravens are on defense ever just wide open guys everywhere
honestly that was such a gimmicky drive im not worried yet
we need a coach who will scheme us some creative offensive plays like the browns just did on that drive
thats my fucking quarterback
fuck baker mayfield
greg roman has to go
marlon was really tempting the refs on that pass play
hope the injury to myles isnt serious
this is why i want gus to be extended
cleveland having that many fans in the stands is extremely dumb asf btw
fucking clowns on defense
never lose truss bb
seriously why has he not changed his cleats this is ridiculous
fucking coward ass oc this pisses me the fuck off mofo really gave up
fuck the browns and their shitty ass field
lamars not gonna make big throws if you dont let him try running it on 3rd and 21
that was a game losing drive ravens shredding clevelands d when they dont fall down
the thing with hollywood is i dont always expect you to make a tough play but he almost never does
resign anquan and torrey smith and dennis pita and make a run at this thing
i like fort but that was terrible coverage by him
yeah lets talk about the amazing comeback story of the guy that kicked a woman on camera
damnit two back to back passes lamar should have had
lamar needs to hit that pass
lamar really needs to stop overthrowing those deep passes he tends to do that
gotta hit that throw
last year he hits that no offseason set him back a lil bit
damn lamar
i swear if we blow a 14 point lead that easily
lamar is both an electric qb and an iffy passer
2 shit throws in a row
wow they blocked it fuck
were so fortunate to be up 2 td this defense is so bad today
guys its time to let it go it was 5 minutes and 98 plays befo fuck marquise brown
the entire city of cleveland can kiss my fucking ass fuck ohio as a whole trash ass state with a bunch of redneck pieces of shit wastes of oxygen
cant put this last drive on the defense theyre fucking gassed
keep trading and investing in the defense for it to still suck ass how about we switch it up and get some offensive help next year
fuck lebron
is it sad that im afraid of 2 seconds being on the clock
little bitches instantly look at the refs for a flag at the end of every play fucking children
defense doesnt care yall why do yall keep defending them they s u c k
harbaugh should be on the hot seat this is fucking pathetic classic harbaugh ravens for the last 7 years
lamar looks like fuck this shit wheres the bathroom
3 minutes in

game already over
ass defense
holy fuck we suck
jfc pathetic
gg
embarrassing 3 and out coming up
fuck earl thomas seriously why does he need to be that guy who fucks up everything around him
rip my pregame thread it was fun people
i havent been this nervous since the titans there is just something about power running teams that scares the absolute shit out of me
will yall calm tf down its the first drive lmao
thats a solid opening drive from a really legit team wink will adjust time to answer
all that money on defense and we cant stop a runny nose lol
a penalty not on the ravens what
thats great it got called on the browns but to me the penalties are still even because an illegal formation is going to happen at some point
can the browns be any fucking luckier
wow these refs are just major fucking cunts
some of you all are real late on your streams
i swear to god the refs have it out for us every game
fuck these god damn penalties no discipline
garret got hurt cause of his own field hate to see an injury and lets be real we enjoyed his antics
safeties are both soft af
this defense is abysmal
defense still soft honestly if we didnt get so many turnovers i dont even think people would speak favorably of this defense
wink trying to be greg roman 20 with the insanity
successfully running it down their throats but they try to pass on first down keep doing what works till it doesnt when its been hugely successful its not complex
run game is working perfectly lets throw it on first down

i fucking hate greg romans play calls
tinfoil hat time but what the fuck is on this field andor what browns staffers had access to our equipment room to file down cleats lmao
william sheridan is about to become the first equipment manager in nfl history to receive death threats
greg roman has got to go what a fucking clown
so is the clock gonna run out on the goal line again
bollywood brown isnt going to be a raven much longer his nfl career is probbably us and done
i really want to make a top 5 game thread comments post after the game cause some of yall are hilarious and deserve recognition
i dont get the hate with this announcer team maybe im too wasted to notice but i think theyre ok
miles boykin davante adams deandre hopkins and keenan allen facts
who the fuck was that too lamar
gotta make those throws man
lamar you gotta hit those passes man
lamar needs to stop missing the easy open threads otherwise hes going to continue to make it harder on himself
wow andrews and boykin open and he misses both
damn 2 straight bad passes by lamar there
devils advocate harder for lamar to grow as a passer when the oline hasnt been the greatest
fuck that kick was to win my fantasy matchup too
man i dont know the play and i love marcus peters but how can you bark at landry and then not stay on him on 4th and 4
2020 ravens and blowing 2nd half leads to good teams name a better duo
if only earl didnt act up
cut marquise brown
its unbelievable how injuries have fucked us this year madden curse can fuck right off for real
injuries in the secondary are just such a cuck
i feel like these browns fans wont be nearly as excited when they all find out they got covid from going to a football game in the middle of a pandemic
ravens with that anticlutch gene
this defense should be ashamed to wear purple and play like this
chuck clark couldve tackled baker wow he just didnt
idgaf if his god damn ankle is falling out get him out of the fucking locker room
cant win games from behind and cant close games out what happened to our identity
this team needs to miss the playoffs heads need to roll and we need to rebuild this teams identity
i am going to die of a heart attack
just win so i can go to bed
why not just punt on 3rd down if youre going to surrender anyway
fire greg roman at the half im dead serious
this is two weeks in a row with no rush on a hail marycould we not
good season boys lets hope for 2021
fuck all you we got this first qtr posters time to wake up
browns fans are trash
if we lose because lamar had to shit im out
this sub is so toxic
is mandrews our only active te
lets eat boys and girls
im not nervous yet but come 2019 i will be as always than we will have 2 scores and 2 stops and ill be calm again

lets goooo
what we thinking tonight boys big w lets go flock we can beat em again i dont know why people think it will be so close dont look at the record watch the first game mismatches
this team is going to have to give it everything they have defence has shown too much weakness that cant happen offence needs to play with more precision and grit its all or nothing tonight see what they are made of
lets fucking go afc north football
my god im nervous
ingrams face on that graphic ensures a win
can we please force baker to make difficult throws stefanski sets him up so easily make him do something extraordinary
coverzero type of game
people still talking about peters as if he has like ten ints this season
i wish we had the cfb mnf announcing crew cause otherwise espn announcing crew are the absolute worse of the bunch
what are yall drinking tonight because i imagine a lot of us are absolutely not watching this fuckin game sober lol

got me a 12 pack of icehouse after work how much of i actually drinki have no idea
time to beat up little brother again lets go
the tmobile fan vote picked cleveland lets prove these mfs wrong
lets fucking go
lets gooooooooooo
todays been weird im not ready for this lol
of course a fucking screen
i hope the browns brown so hard tonight
ravens won the coin toss and deferred to the second half
theres really not a player i want to fail more than baker mayfield
harrison has to make that tackle he had him for a no gain
bowser is great
missed 4 games and still has 800 yds
stop em here and lets score
the fucking screens dude
board exposed at point of attack again not a great look
why did bowser try to block instead of tackle
browns playing like ravens game is their superbowl again
could we defend the screen maybe
how is having oline men that far up there on a pass play not illegal
all these lbs either have terrible pursuit or low football iq thats why the d always gets fucked on screens
mayfield rolls out more then anyone ive ever seen
is that not offensive pi when the lineman are blocking before the receiver catches it or not because its within 5 yards of los
at least were getting some hits
defense is asleep
lol what yall expect andy dalton was balling and so was zeke last week
i seriously think we recovered that and it didnt get called for us
jesus christ we are leaving everything open
jeez facemask
its gonna be a long night christ
is ff recovery rate a tracked stat we have had some bad luck
one of these ff gonna turn for us eventually
talk about bad turnover luck
that d line woke up feeling dangerous
need a big drive here
great job defense
im not saying im pissed but im fucking pissed
i really wish wed use more pa
were getting one of those fumbles and taking it to the house
dude how does this team come out so fucking flaccid for every fucking big game
lets go 8
we need to learn how to read a screen i feel like we get caught on that multiple times per week including 3 on that single damn drive
great return by duvernay
damn we tried
screw greg roman
ffs
fuck greg roman jfc
greg roman everyone
ayo wtf is greg roman doing
what tf are these graphics
how are you going to call a trick play when we havent even established anything yet wtf g ro
why
what the hell was that
jesus christ greg
fuck greg roman
phillips on garrett jesus christ we are doomed
fans roman get creative cmon man

roman i got you fam

flea flicker
our wrs get no separation lol
what the actual fuck
who is tomlinson
mental mistake llama
weekly dumb ass pre snap penalty done
our offense is just mediocre huh
gro needs to fucking go dude
god we need to add center to the fucking off season list
gus
fire roman
browns are all fired up we need to give it back light em up
okay that was textbook defensive pass interference
ha fucking idiot
lets go hollywood
he tackled brown before the ball arrived
wtf was that lmao mans literally dove on him
fucking trash corner
hollywood looked fast
the corner tacked him before the ball was there lmao
lmao tackled him
lol thank god for that bunk ass corner
but it was an underthrow
shades of torrey smith
easy flag
thanks for the bailout brows

that pass had no fucking shot lol
yo that was a duck lmao
obvious pi
work them legs llama lets go
thats how you make something outta nothing
okay redzone offense show us something pleasee
ahh the flacco special
shitty ass field
this field blows
i hope people understand why we say lamar is are offense
slippery af and lamar still breaking away fromem
field is ass
i think the fact that were throwing to gus more means we plan to keep and develop him
is it the field or what
their field looks like shit
change the cleats
is the field ice
they tryna jinx him huh
get lamar some new cleats please
is it lamars cleats or the field
whats up with this slippage
get some spikes on lamar
i am already convinced lamar constantly slipping is field sabotage
lamar throws a td on 13 of his redzone pass attempts thats gotta be a huge percentage
i swear if he throws a pick im hunting down these announcers
tie this game up baby
were seeing rn just how good lamar is without him this drive would be dead ages ago
lfg
good shit help us out defense
looking like lamars saying fuck it i got this
llets goooooo
yall want to shut up about the o for a bit
lamarrrrr mvp touchdown
nice drive outside the crazy flea flicker
fuck yeah lamar now lets get the d back on track
this guy man
lets go
they shoot for his legs so hard i get that its football but wheres the care and concern for another persons livelihood
imma need a couple more of those drives to get me into my fantasy playoffs lets go lj
not bad for a running back at all did a great job of reading his blocks on that td
good drive by the offense super concerned about the lack of any passing attack but they did what the needed to do
llaaammmmaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
that drive brought back happy memories of last season
lets fucking go
did they put vaseline on the turf to fuck with lamar
what are these graphics
defense got 2 forced fumbles on the opening drive lets keep that going
that offensive drive is not sustainable
cmon clark cant do that
the aesthetic of nfl graphics is just wow gonna need to start writing it like n f l w a v e
yup that was blatant pi chuck
this is gus edwards 40th game and he averages 52 ya and they dont give him a shoutout smh
pretty weak dpi call imo
soft ass call
clark just turn around thats an interception
that ball had no chance of being caught wtf clark
that was not roughing what the fuck
fuck these refs
thats not roughing the passer wtf was that that was a sack
roughing lmaooo wtf
lmao what a weak fucking roughing call are you fucking kidding me

unbelievable luck for the browns
3 fumbles and we havent recovered one
lmfao that roughing the passer call is absolutely pathetic
ball dont fucking lie
recovered by cleveland
so lucky
so unlucky with these fumbles wtfffffff
3 ff with 0 recoveries how
get the damn ball

3 fucking fumbles
hey just an idea but maybe we should
recover a fumble tonight
thats right put some respect on marlon name
roughing the passer by judon time for a shot
i remember the good old days when they gave you the ball when you came out of the pile with it
fuck them zebras
browns should cash in their decades of stored luck on someone elese
how the fuck do we force 3 fumbles and none of them go our way jesus christ
i dont get it if campbell comes out of out the pile why is it not our ball
lets get this
get off the fucking field baby
holy fucking shit fuck these refs
fuck these refs smh
ref ball tonight huh
holy shit steeler fan here refs are fucking u guys so hard lol
wow might as well give them points yourself ref
everything is pi
these refs are the fucking worst
how fucking stupid could you be
2 forced fumbles in the first quarter unreal
cleveland paid the refs
you have got to be kidding with this
how is that pi
what the fuck is this
these penalties are killing us
i hate this ref so much wtf
we moved the ball for them this drive its ridiculous
the refs are on their shit tonight
that is bullshit
this some bullshit
youve got to be absolutely kidding me
we cant win with this many penalties
so sick of the fucking refs
let them fucking play refs
so if he didnt need to touch him wouldnt that mean its uncatchable and by definition not pi
i try not to be a homer when it comes to penalties thats 2 absolutely terrible bullshit calls this drive
im shocked that flag wasnt against us
get this stop
if our team is incredibly consistent at one thing it is penalties
refs really getting their tv time tonight jfc
damn the entirety of rnfl wants us to lose and apparently so do the refs
tackling baker is rtp tapping a receiver is dpi
yannick hurried that hard
3rd and 15 can we see a decent 4 man rush for once this season
browns offense truck plays and refball
i love my d linemen
i always forget before games starts that there is the very real possibility that the refs make the game unenjoyable even if you win
id love to see a percentage on how many defense penalties called are actually penalties
no more flags please d
lol
hahahahahahahah
they wish they had tuckkkkkk
missed
ball dont lie bitches
no good lets fucking go

lmao bears are my mainhome team glad to see parkey is still hot fucking garbage
ah yes cody parkey always a reliable kicker for the opposing teams
dont like christmas story anymore
hand that ball of lamar he had 10 yards of green
run the fucking ball
touching the qb isnt a flag
our offense is so damn hard to watch most of the time
le 3 and out has arrived
this fucking field man
slipping all over the place
what the fuck is with the slipping
lamar fucking slipped again
this fucking turf holy shit
what a wasted fucking opportunity
why are we not running the fucking ball
those fans are gonna fight or kiss i dont know
this team absolutely has to put some serious focus on getting some receivers that know how to run routes and get open
that field is trash tonight fix your field cleveland
wow how is this shit even possible fucking insane another presnap penalty by the offense and the turf continues to make lamar slip all over the place so frustrating
another presnap offensive penalty smh
run
the
fucking
ball
horrible first down playcall
ok wtf new shoes or turf please come on
wtf is going on with this field
this fucking field also we dont have a pass block to throw every play
the d gets the job done just to come right back out
hes bitching about being touched when he flashed the hand late as fuck
call fair catch as the ball hits you and you want contact
can we please just run the fucking ball please
y u no run
greg roman
anyone wanna take a crack at explaining that one
if only we had good running backs to run the ball s
if hollywood wasnt in the way mark andrews had a 1st down
wtf was that man

we had so much to scheme something and we got this jesus fuck
dobbins needs some touches
holy shit what is happening
we have horrible execution and our oc is just crazy at this point he throws a 2 yrd pass on first down when weve been getting that with ease running the ball
our passing offense looks like its from 1950 its time to find something else harbaugh
how does dobbins have two fucking carries
bull shit call show it or it didnt happen
nfl really wants the browns in the playoffs huh
omg the number of flags weve gotten already is crazy
bill vinovich is a fucking war crime
flags every 2 plays
greg roman cant draw up an effective passing play to save his life
gotta play against the refs too tonight
imagine not running the balloh wait greg roman is our oc
oh now you wanna call hands to the face
theyre going to penalty us to death tonight
also i respect chubb but man fuck hunt
seriously duck these refs
good shit hump
my tv is going out i couldnt see the flag on that last play
and wheres the holding calm next to the quarterback oh yeah biased reffs
okay i changed my mind humphrey is a top 5 cb my apologies flock
shocked that they didnt throw a flag there
humphrey looked like a rock em sock em robot
the only thing worse than the ravens passing game tonight is the browns passing game tonight
great stop there now lets get some good play calling lamar can run all over these fools
baker is so trash best weapons in the league cant help wild inaccuracy
marlo fruit punch humphrey for the win
run the ball
someone please get me a picture of marlons hand punching through there
mayfield sucks lmao he could have just run for that and made a shit throw
hmmm maybe if we had competent coaches wed be using proche
lol glad he didnt run it baker would have had it easy
that was lowkey a super slick play by proche calls for the fair catch readies his hands for the catch then bails hard so the gunners arent in position to cover the ball
cant wait to see what bad passing plays ol greg has for us now
seriously how awful are the announcers being right now the returner just had an amazing fake out and well be right back that went from our struggling offense starting from the 7 to the 20 clutch play awful announcing
roman calls plays like were down 20
yall remember how bad devin hester was for us lol
why do we not use up tempo offense from the colts game we just trot the same ineffective bs every week
man our passing game is terrible
myles garrett is eligible for man of the year after the hit last year
pls run the damn ball then start using play action not the other way around
browns fans hurt over dobbins lol
myles garrett lifting that 5 gallon bucked up like nothing god damn
they bringing it up lol
myles garrett is a good dude even tho i hate the browns ill give him that
the bar mustve really lowered for the award if myles garrett can get it
i hate that the only decent illegal stream is 3 minutes behind but still love you guy so i f5 like crazy
if you have a black eye on your character shouldnt that dq you from the walter payton moy award
these fucking runs bro

x200b

donotfuckingstopthis
goodness
wow its almost like dobbins is actually good
jk all day
jk is such a smooth runner every run us 8 yards off the bat
fucking field
run is working now gr will shut it down
dobbins reminds me a lot of ray rice same number body style running style just no elevator
what is with this trash ass field
this field sucks
might be fourdown territory
what with the field did it rain someones gonna injure themselves
am i about to buy a fucking dobbins jersey
the way dobbins went down scared me fuck
notice no one was open when lamar was holding the ball
did they grease the damn field on purpose
shitty field
bmore better be getting those cleats fixed at half time
they should all change their cleats at half

we need more miles boykin
nice catch willie
his hands are an important part of his game who the fuck are these announcers
i dont want garrett seriously hurt i just want him out for the game
lets go we waking up baby
jk froze 97 out on the fake
look at lamar man so inspirational
run it down their dam throat take their souls
damn it harbs why the to
that hug lol
harbs sold that wouldve been a td
godammit john
we weathered the browns opening haymaker and now were the ones building momentum you love to see it
must have been a bad formation
that was cute
bus
lamar hugging harbs is like a son hugging his dad i love it
we coming
thats vehicular manslaughter by the bus
just keep running it down their throats those boys dont want it
gus bus lets gooooooooooooooooo
you cant reverse that nothing clear
yessssssssssss great run good blocking at first the give looked odd
i love gus
we should come out passing in the second half s
im still real concerned about the pass game if we make the playoffs but we can work on that against jags nyg bengals just win this game
offensive going crazy tonight
i dont think ive seen hollywood get hyped up for a rushing td seems like the team mojo is coming back
resign gus rn
just run that georgia tech triple option all game
lets go d
dont worry about resigning any of our wrs just draft blocking players maybe get some chickens with their heads cut off might be more reliable than hollywood
how much you wanna bet the refs are about to fuck us on 3rd down
arch rivals hehe good one
what in the chris board not watching his zone
theres pressure on every play but they still keep picking up yards
wtf was that defense lol
welp back on lamar shoulders
refs kept in close on that first browns drive we will score before half and after half

edit told you
i could have run through that hole untouched
there is a chance the browns are good

feels like something is missing on defense but i cant put my finger on what it is

maybe like a nasty olb
lets get a td here and end the quarter then double up after the half that would out us in a great spot
arch what
there is no reason for a defense built as we are built to look this tissuesoft all year
for fucking once i want the front office to get a real olb this team would be an sb contender without wrs if we had a legit pass rush youd see peters and humph perform even better

this shit is just so dumb that we do nothing to fix it
i cant believe teams are letting philip rivers old ass dunk on them
so um can we change the spikes
change those fucking cleats
someone get this man some new cleats
you know after a great running series they gotta pass tf
change the cleats
if he doesnt change his cleats at the half im gonna cry
equipment manager grew up in cleveland confirmed
cleat change please
surrender play
fire this field
why is it every time we need to respond or need to take advantage some shit like that happens
jv ravens tonight
why are we running it
fucking goddamn pathetic what a fucking joke
bro wfucking hell fire greg
fantastic play calling
shitty ass field
we show life it goes out fast
lamar to andrews for 21
dude please this field has lube on it or something
why the fuck are we throwing the ball on first down jesus man
get him some new fucking shoes
this game has me so fucking heated
this literally just went from bad to worse
ive only very loosely watched because im getting slammed at work but seriously what the actual fuck is with lamars shoes

i would understand if it was raining but its unacceptable that you cant get shoes that work as a professional footballer
notice their players arent slipping i wouldnt be surprised if they set the field up this way on purpose
dial it in lamar pls
justice hill is a great special teams guy
more sacks then attempts man tf is that
justice with another great st play
greg roman replaced the microsoft surface with a nintendo switch his play calling is just animal crossing strategy
wtf with lamars cleats do we not have a backup pair
what a hit
dive for the ball man dammit
fuck you kareem hunt
more sacks than attempts only the ravens
49 always leaving plays on the field
elliot is a baller
they dissing jimmy smith why
wow a penalty on the browns amazing
more sacks than passes jesus christ
they rubbed skyline chili on baltimores cleats
how tf did baker hold onto that ball or another way of asking how did yann not force a fumble
lets get 3
see its plays like that this doesnt pay attention to with ngakue
there should probably be an exception for intentional grounding for when you get hit so hard you throw sideways lmao
were averaging 7 yards per rush

so we should be stop gr
general area i mean they were in the same stadium but
why is lamar 23 for 14 yards at halftime were on track to have 28 yards passing the baltimore runners i miss 2019
i wont be surprised if we run 3 times
just get us three
the pass rush is getting home consistently against a good ol feels good man
fire the refs
has ingram been on the field yet
close out the half like last year at cleveland
i honestly thought if the ball didnt get to the line its intentional grounding anyway
d been putting paws on the qb i love it
have we thrown to andrews yet i imagine thats whats coming
baker must be trying to catch flies leaving his mouth open on the sideline like that
didnt we have td drive against the browns in under a minute earlier this season truzzzz
lamar finally got some new cleats
mans stay dropping catchable passes
if marquise drops another pass
lol im just here to see everyone rip hollywood
soulja
cleats inbound
souljah boy tell em
soulja
hollywood really
brown is so god damn fucking bad soulja my ass go fuck off
back to back dropped passed wtf brown
marquise literally cannot make a play for lamar
souljaaaaa
soulja sighting
come on marquise lamar stepped up in the pocket nice
they aint run it once
browns just not good
hollywoods been eating some buttery popcorn before every game
he was right no need for souljas
souljjaaaaa
soulja nooooo
he still sucks for a wr1
motherfucking soulja
fuck hollywood so much
mark
fucking
andrews
remember when yall were blowing hollywood for his bobbled touchdown last week lol
welcome back mandrews
thats the magic weve been missing
mandrews please fuck my ass
mark andrews i love you
mark holy fuck
souljas dont work mondays
fucking improv saving our ass again roman is useless
this team is going to be the death of me
fuck you bum ass brown thats how you catch a ball
i screeched on that play and now my moms pissed
mark andrews is the real soulja boy
wooooooo
yeaaahhhhhhhhhh touchdownnnn
fuck marquise brown

mark hollywood andrews
hey lamar a diggs or a real 1 and this would be the 2019 offense
touchdown bitches
i love that hacky sack celebration
throws ball hits wall bounces right back to him does a hacky sack
lamar is god
that was the swaggiest move ever
mvp lamar
damn marquise what the fuck this is crunch time dawg
let me see if you can run it run it yes indeed he can run it run it
mvp
thats what im talking about
where the mcsorely liars at
it seems like roman is trying to force the passing game just run the ball it is working
lamar is quite honestly our whole offence tonight
not bad for a quarterback
i think i came
love these cleats
lamar mvp jackson
we dont need wrs lamar can throw it to himself
love the run but a good pass to snead is also a td he had a step running across the field
lamar i like how he threw the football at the dawg pound
welcome back mark lets gooo
give lamar a percent in ravens ownership
lets goooooo mark andrews
if we win this game that throw to andrews will be the play of the season
mark andrews is my daddy
and we get the ball back
im 100 willing to give lamar a back massage
that lil move lamar made with the ball during his celebration was sick
holy fucking shit letsgo
lamar fuckin jackson
nice catch lamar hahaha
i love you lamar and andrews
that felt like last year lets goo
and he like soccer lets to baby
sir request permission to tuck and run

for what purpose faster chief

to give the clevenant back their ball
man whoever gave lamar those cleats in the beginning fucked up
not bad for a quarterback
add that celebration to madden immediately
those cleats ar money now
that is my fucking quarterback
hollywood keeps finding new ways to look like dog shit
lamar is gonna bring me to fucking tears good god hes amazing i feel like a proud dad rn but hes older than me
lamar jackson is elite
mood
i think lj8 is balling out because madden gave him a new card and now hes trying to get a totw to top it
if not for mandrews wed be on track for 300 run yard game and literally negative pass yards
low key lou riddick can absolutely get all of my petite beautiful wife
this is a fun game so far
i love that our wrs are being bashed on national tv hopefully its a wake up call to get a real one
good job keeping him in bounds
omg clark i hoipe you ok after that one with the post
chuck be careful jfc
baby you ok
wow baker that accuracy was poor maybe should try being a te
lol clark looks like hes okay
i think clark just gave himself a concussion holy shit
watch out clark dont let the pole knock you out
urinating tree intro material
clark you idiot
umm chuck clarkbruh
goal post1 chuck clarktko
gg so far this is fun
need to come out and play ball control from hear run the ball nonstop add points preferably tds and keep the game ahead of them
straight to concussion protocol
does anyone have that goal post vs chuck replay in slowmo
can we see a deep shot to boykin just once this season we did it once a game last season
awful throw dear lord
nearly intercepted by boykin
makes an amazing throw to andrews then overthrows a dump off classic
why arent we running the ball
marquise is a better db than wr
they are shitting on brown so hard
he did the thing
hollywood caught it
i think that is literally the first time ive ever seen marquise put his head down and go into contact
finally hangs on to one lolll that tells you everything
hubba hubba
beautiful lamar
poggers
im am loving this ref he just seems so disinterested in being out there every time he says what down it is after a penalty he says it with a tone in his voice like 1st down who gives a shit
lamar muthafucking jackson lets go
lets fucking go he is insane
fired up llama alert
ankles broke
stunt on these hoes
gus busssssss
elite
gus bussssss
mv motherfucking p
they have families lamar
bitch you just got bussed
easy money
you god damn right the gus bus
lets fucking go
beautiful drive
and this is the other way the ravens make everything hard
that is not it


lamar is cooking this team
you love to see it
i am so moist
browns are garbo lmao
dick hard
poise
too fucking easy
shit
its too easy
choo fucking chooooo
suck my salty nuts browns
bus man gets paid
just keep lamar in the pocket
thats how we do
ou on jackson rush yards was 54 yards this morning lol
i so badly wish we could clone lamar for all our skill positions lamar at qb lamar at rb lamar at wr
browns really thought they had the best rushing offense
just like the cleveland game from last year td before the end of half opening drive td to start the 3rd 2 score game
gus fuckin bus comin through
ravens run game is cheat codes
is it possible for all our wr be blocking te and just run for the whole game
quick someone put roman on repeat before he gets crazy again
i can only get so erect
but the kings of the north proved merely the kings of fourth place cleveland narrator in my head
my favorite play on the drive was the out route to hollywood good zip location timing really havent seen that route connect in weeks
great drive exactly the kind of football we expect out of this offense
lets rise
will i get over it no but life goes on heres your quirky quote for the game baker
here we go
time to convert all that pressure into a sack lets kick these shits in the teeth
i cant believe i just missed that drive because my brother wanted the 10 oclock news
lol baker
defense just isnt good enough right now
yeah it was really constructive seeing people spam johnny manziel facial expressions i bet
bwill
this espn story lasted about 5 mins too long stfu
defense being the defense
really nice throw and catch
wowza this zoom thing might have some legs behind it might need to check it out glad the mnf guys could help out
we read a screen we did it
we stopped a screen
clark and elliot are so bad in coverage rn
can our defense step up
stop with the zone cmon he cant throw against man
big stop time
remember when we used to have a steel wall for a defense
wtf was that defense
just pitching to wide open guys because our secondary plays 10 yards off the line
jimmy smith injured again ugh
bro why cant our defense do fucking anything when our offense is churning
bruhhhh
come on wink get off that dang zone
only 1 foot in
rare bad fort play
should have challenged
is this what playing like a raven means
fuck that shit time to up another g run by the offense lets go boys
every fucking time offense gets it together defense is like nahhh
the long catch was just someone making a play that run was just soft fucking football
miss hahahahahahahahahhaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
lmfao parkey is cheeks
brownsyndrome
he missed it
did we just witness the end of a career
defense
this defense is so allergic to clutchness
lmao he missed the extra point
defense step up
im smelling a jt field goal coming up
this will bite them in the ass
thanks parkey doing gods work
time to score again lets go
even when they score we win
defense is fucking dog water we aint doin shit in the playoffs with this defense
it just seems like all year when we can make a stop that we need or put a game away with one we let the other team walk right down the field with ease
that progressive commercial about residing the field explains everything
anxietyyyyy
they have a good offense

if we take a bunch of time and get even 3 points here its not a problem
would love to see harbs challenge something
i dont understand wtf is up with the defense today they just look downright awful
id love to see a big run from dobbins
joe buck said parkey would make that extra point
why does espn think anyone cares about these back stories
that mouth piece goes so hard
refs suck today
boykin sighting
score now 2820

score if the browns had a kicker with a damn 2824
lets go miles
boykin sighting
nothing would make me happier than to see boykin start doing well idk why but i like that guy
small claps for boykin
please dont playaction on second or run a screen please
hope lamar breaks phillips ankles you not hard
miles boykin is more productive the marquise brown
announcers for mnf really want browns huh
lamar looking like january joe
yea lets give our best back the worst carries
how does the center false start lol
fuck these commentators
here comes our problem by the middle of the 3rd an all run team gets shut down by even a mediocre defense without a pass to make the run a threat you cant play 4 whole quarters
not a bad throw really just didnt work
i mean how do you not make those passes consistently man thats fucking frustrating
lamar gotta stop overthrowing
ahh damn bad throw
yeah this feels really familiar
thats two lamar should have had
all good well come back
bombed it
who cares lets run it back
ughhhh what the fuck lamar you gotta make those throws
ugh of course when lamars passing is on our receivers cant get space but when our receivers get space lamars passing is off
damn that one to sneed hurts one foot lower man
imagine stubbing your toe on that glass floor mat
need defense right here man
llama just has to work on those passes and he will be deadly been sailing them a lot this season
i said this last week we all make a ton of excuses for lamar poor receiving core bad o line bad oc and play calling but then hell make two throws just like that that just makes you go ughhh how far can this guys really take us those are plays that the good qbs make to put teams like fucking cleveland away
damn thats a sexy chair mat id slide all over that thing
bowser
bowserrrrrrr interception
lfggggg
lessss goo
bowser
im sorry baker but your receiver is in another castle
tyus bowser thats the comment pay thr fucking man
bowser might needa covert to mike thats insane
browns gonna brown
lets go
sad dog sips expensive beer
lets fucking gooooo
pay that man
god bless baker mayfield
bowser read that all day
hell yeah the defense did a thing
overthrows to your wr underthrows to the defense
can defense make a stop yes ravens sub they can lololol lets go flock
ok i love bowser
holy fuck i called that
bowser finally man this guy has showed up this year
punch it in boys
fuck yessssss
baker for mvp
lol thanks baker
bowser been lowkey doing well this season
fuck yeah bowser
bowser ate that pass like its mario
tyus bowser is honestly a top 5 pass defending linebacker in the league and he deserves to get paid
yo we gotta resign this guy
that browns fan with the dog mask will give me nightmares
holy fucking shit yes
there you fucking go
too easy dobbyyyy
bowser is so good in coverage man didnt think thats where hed shine
unreal pick tyus
pay bowser
i argued about paying him i was wrong pay the man
resign bowser
jk just skipping to my loo in the endzone
bowser hell of a play
we take those
trace mcsorley
lmao that sad motherfucker with the bulldog mask
commentators so hurt ravens scored quiet as hell
better catch than any of our receivers lol
that sad alcoholic dawg in the stands made me laugh so hard
i think bowser has made judon expendable i like what ive seen from him
wtf
bowser
mnf the best of the best
huh
imagine having a ball kicked by tuck fly into your hands ouch
god these espn games are trash
can we not put tyus in at rb for a dive so he gets his td feel like we can trust him to get it
does anybody have a gif of the browns and ravens fan yelling at each other
why such a low arch
mark the time at 37 after the hour when the announcers mentioned that harbaugh was a special teams coach
okay who else had a will hill flashback
lets fucking go what a play
the browns are getting completely outplayed but it still feels like their down 3 lol
fuck missed tucker point sacrifice for the win i hope
i think its a sign of the apocalypse
tucker needs to not get himself hurt in a scrum for a blocked kick
lets go defense they fucking done baby
as crazy as this sounds if they get a stop here they should let lamar air it out a little if you wanna beat the elite teams lamar has to work on consistency
i just need to say we need to go back to 2018 script lamar straight up sucks as a passer this year its fact he needs a full offseason to get his mechanics back
holy shit we suck at tackling
how many ravens does it take to make a tackle
jesus christ please wrap up
landry and his homegirls stay crying when he play mp and marlo lol
i want to get a safe enough lead to see us all flip shit when trace throws fucking bombs
brandon williams tripped him up

thats a weird way to say a 320 lb man collapsed on top of him
ngakoue is a strong mofo to flip a tackle like that
the commentators will point out every missed throw by lamar and praise baker for his accuracy this is so biased its not even funnny
will jr a dog hope hes ok
he got clowned for that too dang
this game is up to the defense
strip fumble incoming
bruh whos devonte harris
how hard is it to grab mayfield who buttered his jersey
bruh we cannot sack
elliott has to make that sack
haha hes no lamar
wrap the fuck up
someone fucking wrap up mayfield jesus
of fucking course
this defense is ass
holy fuck that play works against us every time
come on elliot we make that play they punt
4th and 4

corners playing off ten yards
wow landry was wide open wtf defense
why we playing 10 yards off on 3 and 4 n short
cmon elliot gotta wrap up
is baker always looking for a flag
baker stfu
harris is feasting he was nice against pit too
shit was uncatchable
didnt we have like 15 guys on the field
fuck baker
stefanski is a damn doofus
he def snapped it when we had 23 players still on the field but trying to get off no clue how they missed it or how the announcers didnt say anything
15 ppl wtf
15 on the field wtf
thats a stupid penalty completey inconsequential to the action on the field it is a technicality
just give me a field goal and ill be happy
well looks like the offense is gonna have to close this game out our defense isnt a suffocating defense they are a turnover driven one
wtf
noooooo
lmao lamar has the shits
lamar just gotta pee
lol lamar had to poop
is lamar ok
i only want to hear tony romo announce games
lamar watch
lamar better be ok
hes just pooping right
lamar number 2
come on defense come on
4th downagainstop it though
why they have to call him out like that let him shit in private
good to by coach h
wasting tos cause we cant line up again coaching failures all year
hey guys heres an idea make substitutions faster

oh and 15 men on the field isnt allowed
why cant we substitute on time all of the sudden
i dont have much faith with this defense on 4th down i hope they prove me wrong this time
nfl films better pick up the poop narrative and run with it the dump that changed the season
lamar could take the browns to the super bowl more so than baker mayfield can
baker such a little bitch
dammit defense
dont blame calais for lamar needing more time to wipe

harbaugh with the 300 iq play
mother fucker please be okay peters
no not peters
now he hurt fucccccccc
why is someone always wide open
lamar has cramps now wow
the bad has outweighed the good for marcus peters this season
lamar hurt carrying this team saw it coming fml
and now we will get fucked because we are going to be down to humphrey and two cbs off of the street
peters peters peters
what the fuck did we pay marcus peters for
peters is pretty laughable this season
wow what the fuck is happening
we are about to see roman get pass happy
ill say it again predictable defense
ravens spend too many important picks and money for the defense to not hold up and help out
wait lamar has cramps hes not coming back
im just not surprised anymore whenever our offense can actually put up points our defense absolutely shits the bed
peters hope you good homie 3
bruh
you have to be kidding me
jfc
we really gonna choke this away huh
most unclutch defense ive actually ever seen
lol god and the refs want the browns to win
our defensive players look more lean than swole anyone ever notice that
really cant make this shit up lmao
this is not okay
literally cant catch a break tonight
respond with at least 3
fuck lamar is questionable
this team is going to be sitting at home during the playoffs
believe me i want to them to win as much as anyone but does anyone have any faith that this team could stand a chance against the bills or chiefs
if we dont get points on this drive i have some bad news for everyone
peters is so bad i said it in week 3 that we should trade him for someone that can actually play d or a receiver very sad to see no one wants him gone
please now just run the damn ball
defense is shit tonight
ummmmm
this game is literally ravens vs eagles earlier in the year
jesus christ
wtf

docriversgif
thats why you dont get used you unreliable dumb ass
dont call his ass hollywood no more marquise it is
time to bench marquise
bro where tf is lamar
if we dont make the playoffs because of a fucking cramp
are you fucking kidding me with this shit 15
okay defense maybe make a fucking stop here holy cow
welp i suddenly dont feel so great about this game

hollywood hasnt looked fast all year
not making the playoffs and getting bounced round one will be the best thing for this team
nd this is why u dont tweet talking shit bout ur team
cut hollywoods sorry ass
defense gonna let em march down the field
hollywood florida
wasted first round pick
we lost
blame of the game cramps
dude thats 6 if you catch it
breshad perriman flashbacks
fuck off baker
god baker is turning into a whiny bitch
brown sucks but where is 8
theyre gonna win because lamar had to shit and brown cant catch a fucking thing
we should only draft tes from now on just run 5 tes every play
baker whining for a flag on every play stfu
fuck yourself brown
this game has lose all over it
unreal baker mayfield is such a pussy
mayfield is a baby
fucking baker and marquise in a competition to see who can be the most soft
x200b

lamar get some pepto bismol or nah
i hate this
this defense is so soft in the 4th quarter they let so many unnecessary yards after contact because they cant tackle for shit
fucking pathetic on every aspect
the only good thing about cleveland is they arnt detroit
wwere at the phase where we cant tackle
when can we move on from brown
this is the tennessee game all over again but worse just absolutely pathetic defense
is lamar eligible to come back in or no
5 fucking yards every time
front 7 playin aka lbs playing weak as hell
what is the upvotes button picture
wtf happened to the defense
hold them defense
we cant stop this is getting ugly
no reason we arent giving boykinduvproche full opportunities to step up to the 1 spot tonight this is why we drafted the guys with sure hands right
this soft coverage is really working well excited to see them run the whole clock out
soulja hopped off the bed turned my brick hands on
theyve gotta be averaging 8 yards a play at this point this is so frustrating to watch
we done
queen is getting super exposed might be his worst game yet
no holding

fucking hold
hold
blatant holding on offense
good season yall lol
browns holding every fucking play
theyre holding on every fucking play
cant stop a fucking nosebleed
why pick on peters when you can pick on harris
i really didnt want to go to bed in tears tonight cmon
was there not a hold there that seemed super egregious
this defense is such a fucking embarrassment shameful
calais has an arm around his fucking neck on that play
how many ravens does it take to tackle someone
where the fuck is the holding call on campbell
team is soft af and full of chokers
are the refs not gonna call that hold
need a ff right now
jesus christ this defense cant stop anything rn
this is gonna be so embarrassing tomm morning
man this is so hard to fucking watch our defense is throwing it away
the team has no heart rn at this point just fucking tank
where are our linebackers
holding
where is the hold
that obvious fucking hold
how is the d this bad i know some injuries but geez
0 tackling
when did jimmy even go down
someone needs to make a big play please
anyone have any updates about lamar
lamar come back plsssss
theyve held egregiously every play this drive wheres the call
is it our defense scheme the players are there to run stop but it never happens
ima bout to lose my mind

how the fuck did the half even happen
fade me
fuck my life
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
straight embarrassing
where is lamar
deshawn elliot is
this is the worst ive ever felt during a ravens game lol
wheres lamar
good job team yet again
whos surprised here
we are so fucking bad
embarrassed with the 2010s ravens just such shit product

correction 2020spresent
my pain is sad
please fucking miss it
mis mis mis
editfuck
fuck me in the ass
cant wait for the announcers to say best kicker after this
i hate 2020 so much
fucking off me
our d line can never bring anyone down
run the clock out tucker to kick game winning fg
if we lose this game changes have to happen three years and no playoff wins to show for them

our defence has had 2 long drives that they only had 1 3 and out to rest on chill if we can get a good drive here and let them rest we can have a fighting chance if we go quick then browns will be back on the field against a tired d time for o to step up
x200b

x200b

i am so glad i dont have any hair to pull out

x200b

lamar where are you
mmm this is kinda cringe
playing ten yards off the receivers all the time isnt going to work
the pain of the dropped passes im sorry its not fun for anyone
joe played through a torn acl and mcl during a lost season season on the line lamar better be out there
lamar better be on the fucking field
yall doubting jtuck
have not had a clutch defense since ray lewis
i hope lamar gets back in this defense is consistently disappointing though
its over
just fucking run the ball
team cant handle adversity
lamar jackson still in the ravens lockerroom ngl im incredibly disappointed right now
gg no lamar not believable
03 recovering fumbles brown drops passes like its his job and lamar cant finish because of cramps smh
how do we keep choking away leads week after week
run the fucking ball
what in the everloving fuck is this
roman 3 plays special yay and thats the season
if we lose this game man
man i get lamar is cramping up but damn we need him
where tf is lamar
maybe lamar will take a shit at halftime next time instead of during the 4th quarter
roman is fucking braindead
browns are all fired up we arent this is done
fucking lord man
willie
thank god snead caught it
he fucking threw it on a dime
thank you snead your better than brown already
fucking sad that snead is still our best receiver
dont forget we have tucker
snead for team mvp i dont even care anymore
oh baby we got a bounce
at least snead can catch the fucking ball
praying for jk big play to save us
willie snead is our best receiver by a mile god bless him but hes a wr4 on like every other team
pay attention hollywood
even if we get 3 i do not trust this god damn defense
we need 20 yards to drain the clock and kick a fg thats literally it
bruh we really almost in fg range they gotta slow way down though because browns are guaranteed more points against this dog shit defense today
please score guys
keep running run the clock out game winning fg
what a fucking cut from gus 2nd 11 to 2nd and 4 lets go
waitcan we do this
they showed lamar running to the locker room if you have that bad of cramps you wouldnt be running
dont even matter if we score this lousy ass defense aint stopping shit
please win this ravens your 42 yards away need to get the 1st here though
ugh ricard is hurt now
i deserve a lobotomy for picking brown in fantasy
can we still do blame of the game on brown if we win
fuck you roman
lamar is doing a live rn from the toilet
fuck this field man
fuck this field fuccckkkkkkk
fucking fuck all the fucking fucks
are you serious this fucking field
roman has to go
worst case scenario happening as we speak
as if our luck cant get any fucking worse
hes here
welp season over
lamar got the squirts
not in range
yesssss
fuck me sideways


how the fuck


lamar gone trace fucked in the knee
fucking lamar
trace please be okay
lamaaarrrr
lamar lets fucking go
this is crazy ness guys what the fuck is going on
and here comes lamar jackson
the fuck is with these field conditions
only in fucking 2020
lamar gonna win it on this play
this team is a comedy of errors
and why would we call that play on 3rd and 1
of course browns have a shitty field lol ughhh what a fucking game
oh my god this is it isnt it
the best thing that ever happened to the browns was leaving cleveland for baltimore
rip this season
lamar shouldve been in this entire time
here comes qb draw from roman
just one first down and let tucker do his thing
its like those old buffalo wild wings commercials where they sabotage the players by tripping the sprinklers
i dont think a kick this far in cleveland in december happensbut prove me wrong
and here comes lamar jackson sounds wff af
god wants us to lose this game
jesus christ why does this fucking team always have to give us hope
diaper up big boy
come on lamar we need you
do we go for it with lamar
low key was hoping to see koch come flex that perfect record for the win
im not even mad anymore this shit has me laughing at this point what in the fuck
let tucker rip a 60 yarder right here
this shit is so crazy i feel like im watching old wwf
lamar running to the locker room looked like he had to drop a mondo duke
ots like bobby boucher coming out at halftime
this is the weirdest shit ive ever seen
well maybe we get a miracle
bah gawd its lamar jackson
what the fuck hollywood used a ref to block
you cant make this up
hollywood redemption arc

this game is a classic
lmao sit the fuck down sendejo u dirty bitch
dobbins is my fucking dad

lamar jackson is the only reason this offense works
this is one of the best sport matches ive ever watched so entertaining
shocking sendajo leading with his head
im on an emotional rollercoaster
if brown drop that omg i would set the world on fire
defense do your fucking job
marquise you go and do something like that and totally redeem yourself
remember the ravens
still upset at hollywood
this game is a movie script

cant change my mind
best mnf game of all time
love lamar so much so so so much

love you bb
come on d stop this and close
it out
and that punk motherfucker got flattened man lets go thats how you respond

prayers up for trace
lamar does not look like he feels good though get this stop defense and give that man a break
come on d i belee
game not over yet though please defense
hate the espn casters all you want but that da da da daaaaa on that lamar coming out of the tunnel video was funny
the fucking roller coaster of emotions for those who are new fans this is the type of shit that happens from the fucking field from the lead the bullshit penalties to lamar going to the back this is the roller coaster that i hate but keep fucking coming back for
lamar is legit stone cold steve austin just without the glass shattering
one stop defence we need 1 stop
defense is fucking choking
jk dobbins is so good what a great pickup
hollywood needs to get his shit together thank jesus he caught that one defense needs to sack up right fucking now
man i hope this energizes the defense get a fucking stop please
paul pierce moment
this game is playing with my heart my unborn baby is probably wondering wtf is going on
they keep attacking harris and its killing us
dude defense wtf
i really hope mcsorely is okay though i like him
just wtf is this game
the defense wont ruin the moment right
this sub went from cursing hollywood to loving him lmaoooo
30 yard play right off the bat lmao
defense
i would literally buy his shit and frame it
idk if brown shouldve scored there tho
this is winks worst game of the year while at the same time its romans best game of the year
holy shit 33 wtf you doin
ahem

soulja boy tell em
can you imagine how great lamar would be if he had a wr that could win contested catches
harris is basically canady
how was that complete he fell out im confused
davontae harris is a liability the dreads remind me or maurice canady and theyre both liabilities
ugh mayfield rolls out every single time almost
this defense should get shot in the head jesus fuck
defense is fucking blowing it after what lamar did
stop a fucking nosebleed
im gonna kms arent i
can our defense please not be bunch of bitches
fucking kidding me
this defense is fucking trash
edc fuck the defense spend all the money on offense
what the fuck defense
this defense man
well that was easy
104 1 timeout
they gave us time fools
our defense is making a case to be the worst 4th quarter defense
are they averaging 20 yards a play
did number 44 just give up
humphrey straight whiffed
why does our line keep committing down the middle after seeing baker roll right all fucking day jesus
way too easy smh
soft
people calling the defenses bitches realize were out or top 3 dbs and now were fucked
silver lining is the defense left enough time for a drive for a field goal
jesus christ humphrey
at least we still have time
marlon choke humphrey
lol 22 points in the 4th quarter defense is nonexistent
fuck everyone on this defense
humph whiffed and completely gave up
how is our defense this fucking bad holy shit
fire this defense out of a cannon into the fucking sun
browns may have scored too soon
were essentially watching big 12 football here
humphrey just fucking blew it for us
miss the pat parkey do it
swiss cheese secondary
at least they scored quickly lol
what are they doing damnit
lets go lamar
this is the worst defense weve ever seen
this game is not on the oi would have the d running gassers until they puke bile
our defense is cheeks
if you cant get pressure on a qbno matter how good the secondary is they cant cover for 30 seconds
how much we spent on this defense again we didnt get a replacement or true 1 wr lamar
im glad they scored quickly lord knows we wouldnt have stopped them
we need pass rushers badly
well if nothing else its fucking memorable
going to overtime there is 1 minute left and a timeout we need what 40yards
duv needs a jacoby jones moment
imagine if they miss the xp
the stress is so real
just dont give them the ball back with time
just need a fg cant go to overtime with 2 corners 1 being the only healthy one
this game is making me drink
please baby jesus
its just not working and smith is having a monster career in green bay
bro i am straight up not having a good time
i cant believe weve spent all that money on this defense for these dudes to be playing this trash
i swear to christ this offense better find some inspiration or thats season
why is our defense so bad
nice pass from lamar right there
cmon lamar 15 more yards
im sweating
who else me thought a penalty was coming on the whistle
im shaking
anxiety has never been higher right here big truss

im wfh like most but got to go into the office for a video shoot and i still have the usa today of the winning field goal against san fran

x200b

x200b

ohhhhh my fduzcking gaagd
safety yay
the most intense game ive seen in a while
im gonna cry
biggest truss
lets fucking goooo
goddamn my ass need to go get these blood pressure drugs because that game fucked me
justin sorry i ruined your superspreader party tucker
what a fking game amazing
what a game
no offensive penalties on that drive
hollywood just falling down no effort to go get a first
omg peters you fucking idiot holy shit
this is the worst ravens defense ive seen since the 90s
fuck this team defense has no heart play like a raven yall are playing like the bungals
im pissed too but you guys just give up faith immediately we can still win this game even though our defense and marquise completely fucked us
good luck ravens from a browns fan
steeler fan here rooting on baltimore for once it would be awfully embarrassing for both our squads if the browns take the division the enemy of my enemy is my friend at least until he is my enemy again lol stop these 93 shit stains
we just got fucking dog walked
can they tackle anyone jfc
these olbs we have are such pussies holy fuck
defense whats that ravens 2020
we have shitty fumble recovery luck
fuck the nfl refs this shit is unwatchable
that call was actually worse than the roughing the passer call what the fuck
baker mayfield
this field is atrocious
fuck greg roman
this field is sus
the outside thirds of the field are dry and the middle third is a muddy mess meanwhile baker keeps rolling out and all their run plays are to the edge

you think cleveland soaked their field to slow down lamar and dobbins
what should greg roman do this drive run it which is our strength or try to force pass plays
32 cannot cover
fucking useless clowns offense gonna have to score 35 tonight
we need a safety
player on opposing team has a healthy bowel movement

this sub how does this happen this is unheard of
running on second and 21 jesus christ
chuck cmon bro we professionals
good shoes
a defensive stand there wouldve likely been the game if we keep the run game up
why didnt we challenge that
that was to boykin and he didnt try
lamar has been floating the deep ball all night
gotta make that throw fuck
that is why we run it folks
back to back shit throws damnit you cant do that
that is just so inaccurate woof
after steamrolling them on the ground were throwing the ball why
i literally cant get over how bad that was holy shit that was embarrassing man
predictable defense
fuck all the bullshit defense got this

x200b

big t r u z z
lamars takin a shit
lamar gotta shit
they had one fucking job
defense is fucking pathetic
defense get your shit together or were out of the playoffs
why you have souljas if you never use them
stop the count
backup qb lets call a qb sneak and two passes when we have 200 yards rushing what in the ever living fuck are we actively trying to lose
baker is such a whiny bitch i hate him
there is no heart on this team they gave up when lamar went into the locker room
corners didnt even try to come back stood and watched
this team is such a joke they find more embarrassing ways to lose every week
imagine if elliot didnt whiff on the sack
first time this season the defense has been carried by the offense this has been embarrassing
run the fucking ball
ravens 100 winning this game its gonna come down to parkey missing a fg lol

x200b

edit bears fan here ive seen this story too many times in the past
i just dont understandyou are running the ball so well and yet you decide to run with a qb thats not jackson i honestly do not get iti just dont get it
the defense should have just let them score on the first play so the offense could have more time to score
fuck cleveland
why the fuck did you use the to already did you not learn
fuck baker gayfield and his lame ass commercials
amazing game defense still trash lol
do you guys think greg is a bottom 3 oc in the league
if we lose fuck it tank and get the best draft spot possible this was a must win game no way we should lose to the browns ill see you week one draft a wr who isnt short and skinny fucking forest gump mofo
you guys need to cheer the fuck up were 75 and the clowns are 93 but were going to show the world why these records are highly deceiving and beat the clowns in primetime
its just so sad i have literally 0 confidence the ravens can respond with a great drive to match
racist fans thought he shoulda passed it there
great play by duvernay on special teams to give us good field position

lets run the ball ffs
this game thread is always calling for someones firing
i really dont think think hunt got both feet in
lamar just killed that drive we had a touchdown
lamar jackson needs to learn to throw the ball end of story
honestly tired of lamar overthrows
nobody wants to mention it but the fact that the browns can have as many fans that they do in the stands is a massive advantage it should 100 be no fans across the league
the announcers cant get enough of the browns duck so fucking sick of all of these announcers being biased against the ravens fuck em all
are all the browns just women beaters who are now painted as model players or what lets give em all awards for not assaulting people this year that we know of
fuck lebron james
i just hope both teams have fun
their entire playbook is run ball play action lol
our linebackers are just not good enough
running down and scoring first drive does not bode well for the rest of this game ravens offense is gonna need to be on point tonight to win
judon is ass
lol imma head out
horrible throw bailed out by pass interference
of course the browns cant afford to have a good field poverty franchise
man the broadcast is all browns stuff
shit okay i see it i see it
baker mayfield is so bad
fuck this field
do i have to say fuck greg roman after every drive because thats exactly what i will do after watching this garbage
this offense wont win anything so long as lamar is getting spooked in relatively clean pockets and panicking he looks lost every drop back
dude fuck this turf
harbaugh calls a time out for absolutely no reason but doesnt know when to use a timeout when he absolutely needs to
quick reminder that both times weve won the superbowl we entered the playoffs as a wildcard team
why is he fucking wide open
and people ask why we shouldnt resign judon 15yr and he isnt close to 10 sacks through 13 games
hahahah we look like clowns
fire the equipment manager
this team just doesnt have it you have been slipping literally for in real time over an hour why havent you changed your cleats yet
what a poorly run organization losing because of cleats that they havent changed in the last hour
justice hill is pro bowl caliber gunner
idiots in here saying we shouldve passed on 3rd and 19 in a tied game lol
lmao fuck this team how do you let him get that off
what is this clown whining about
15 trash
hollywood sucks
dawg pound get fucked idiots ugly ass stadium
hunts catch was good watch the slow mo
lamar what the fuck man
backtoback overthrows damn
fucking hell two bad passes to open guys
lamar has an awful time controlling his passes hes always too far which i guess is better than too short but its frustrating see him go too long all the time
lamar needs to do better what is the fix here
even raven fans are pretty quick to turn lol
i dont understand how he keeps missing easy throws like this one he used to make it last year
stafanski called a play to get 12 men what a fing wimp
all year we have had zero discipline on either side of the ball
marcus peters
i hate this defense with a passion
this shit looks so fucking scripted lmao up 14 give up a dumbass td and 2 point then the backup comes in and the midget wr drops an easy conversion
what happened to lamar did i miss them saying it
comprehensive flaws with this team that cant be fixed this year and some that can and just arent being fixed we dont need to be in the playoffs this year
literally holding every play
theres no chance we hold them here
there is zero reason to believe the browns will fail to score a td here and its sad

edit they scored
madden curse be like oh your offense is good tonight fuck you take a defensive l
fuck the ravens
idgaf if we even win this game this team doesnt deserve shit
judon and not maintaining the edgename a more iconic duo he just keeps on rushing up the field forever until he ends up back on the bench where he belongs
if hollywood gets a target this drive fire roman and harbaugh im not fucking kidding
dont care brown is fucking awful and the reason were behind rn

ravens d never makes the stop late in games this isnt news for the seasoned fan
lamar we need you
espn want the browns to win so bad lol
cleveland fuck your field
what the fucking hell roman
browns cheering is sickening
our playcalling is so bad mani cant believe its worse ocs out there
miss it
wtf we win because lamar used his arm
does lamar even have a single completed pass this passing offense is literally the worst in the nfl we need to run it but jesus christ something has to be done so we can at least pass a little
lets be honest we arent gonna win superbowls with that kind of throwing talent i love lamar but this just aint it you gotta make that throw
damn brah whyd roman drop that pass

browns fans are literally mentally retarded
our linebackers are so fucking bad its insane
whos the joker on here that was raving about the clock after we scored
fire greg roman
browns td and miracle 2pt conversion inbound
my brother called my dad bitching about masks and saying he supports the antimask rallies that are popping up over the province and my dad absolutely fucking lost it on him my dad has been a fairly far right wing leaning conservative but throughout the year hes been moving away from the right and for a dude in his mid 50s i couldnt be more proud of him
fuck this defense
choking is ingrained in this team that 2016 christmas day game really broke us in the clutch

need a big comeback win to get over that
that wasnt jokers fault
you cant make this up lamar our of nowhere is out with cramps in the biggest game of the year i have literally never seen this in any nfl game in my life
75 yard lamar td incoming big truuuuusssss
we got this i promise in ot but we will win in regulation
just not mentally prepared
anyone know whos starting at right tackle for us tonight
is dez active or is he still on the covid list as a precaution
lay like a raven

lets fucking goooo
mnf broadcast dudes are just some guys
stack the box wink
is it me or did steve levy stop dyeing his hair or did he stop a while ago and i just noticed
whos out
hopefully we can expose their secondary with some short passes early
boys im nervous
andherewego
lets fucking go
waited to take all my breaks now so i can watch for the next hour till i get to go home lfg beat the fuck out of the browns
as fans we cant lose

if we win our playoff plans continue
if we lose we still have the ravens

i dont see how we as fans actually lose
here we go yall lets gooo
hope the game ends in a kick six again lol
i wish wed go back to the black pants
checking in from lamar county mississippi lets go
show some fucking heart tonight boys
hitem up mcphee
hit him hard hit him fast
why does it seem we are always so bad at defending screen passes
how is the defense still so bad at defending screens
fucking screens man
bowser took an awful angle to the ball
wtf wwrap up
why can we never cover a fucking screen jesus
atleast it wasnt a td
landry omg rip
screens are killing us once against
lol theyve shown their whole playbook on the first drive thank you
defense usually starts a bit slow well settle in
juiceman with the rare tackle
we need malik harrison in to stop the run
you hate to see it
can we stop the dang pa
soooo our linebackers havent shown up
wide fucking open
browns score here
this dude mayfield rolling out like hes playing madden
i already want to die d looks weak especially with screens
why the fuck are there still fans at nfl games
baker cooking back there
so uhhh defense you gonna show up
mario forcing another fumble jfc
fruit punch
there were white gloves on that ball
another ff for fruit punchgoing to seal the deal for most all time in a season
we need pass rush idk how anyone looks at our team and thinks were a good defense
roll in bounds ball
fruit punch
2 fumbles for nothing ffs thats some shit luck on bounces
be nice to recover one of these damn fumbles has not be a good opening to this one for us
where is the defense
pitiful defense that whole drive
that looked so easy
fans will help cleveland tonight
wow that was a solid drive by the browns gotta give them props but i trust in our d making plays and that baker wont be this consistent all night
the browns had some luck there theyre well coached too
why cant we have creative play calling like that
honestly pretty piss poor effort to start a playoff game for us all the resources went to the defense they need to be elite when it counts
defense needed to shake of some rust thats their one forgivable drive
defense needs to show up on those 3rd downs
lets go offense bring it back at em
time to unleash the dobby lets goooo
you ever notice that offenses score slowly on us because they keep getting 510 yard gains cough cough screen plays stop them
brownies have set up the short passscreen game and its gonna come back to bite us
lambo jackson
well that was pathetic hopefully the offense does something
sweet ass play boys
flea flicker but we cant block lmao
what a dumb fucking play call
what the absolute sweet fuck was that play
i really like that animation
that lamar car was sick
jesus
a flea flicker to start
interesting play call
that was the slowest flea flicker attempt ive ever seen
3 and out
feed jk dobbins
mark didnt even try to sell that shit
dj fluker has to block garrett
good lord that was embarrassing
why are we running a flea flicker when oline sucks
how about we hand the ball off to gus first how about we do that
roman is a fool
greg roman man wtf
that first play was executed poorly
so this is why ozzie always drafted defense but he also had ray basically his whole career
lmfao what the fuck
calling it holding

edit well i was right sorta
so we can do flea flickers but not play action
offensive line is getting worked
all that and the wr still couldnt separation
pls god just feed dobbins
what who is this defense
well you guys were right about holding
run the ball down their throats
going to be tough running keep pounding gus
wtf
wtf
delay of game really
ugh what a dumb costly penalty
literally feels so foreign to have a flag be on the other team after we make a play lol
troof baltimore is 23 when not scoring first this season
stop reminding me how much i miss my thicc nicc
its amazing how for so many years the ravens have been completely and utterly incompetent on screens on both offense and defense
thats such a penalty lol
les go
this is gonna be a long ass game
lol
no discipline
pass interference
lolya think
a pass interference for us
the torrey smith pi special lets go
flacco era heave and hope for dpi there lol
thank you
hollywood got a contact call wow
keep attacking 36
that was definitely a delay of game but i watch rodgersbrady get like a second and a half after zero multiple times a game every single week
lol i think my dog just barked pass interference that was so obvious
how come ravens receivers are always tackled before the ball gets there
lmao wtf was that
stewart our best offensive player so far lmao
great playcall there they took advantage of the browns trying to rough us up
soulja
obvious pi
talking shit after being shit is he good lmao
egregious pi
late hit on lamar no flag
lamar with the flacco special
lol marquise is so little yo
dobbins dobbins dobbins
god how much is lamars back surgery gonna be from carrying this team
so lamar learned something from flacco
yo fuck this field
we finally figured out a way to use hollywood just like torrey
lamar needs change cleats after this drive
dude lamar is so fast how can i be impressed every time i see him play hes quick as hell
why is their turf making lamar slip on every play
just a casual non sack to 12 yard run by lamar
2 penalties drawn by hollywood
its cold guys when its cold the field does get slippery
lmao such clear pi if the browns are really that bad in the secondary we should be airing out it a little that ball wasnt gonna get caught
get lamar some new fucking cleats
powers got blown up
okay nvm lamar needs new cleats lol
is it lamar or is it the field thats 34 slips nearly in a row
run it twice here
15 beats his man by a mile they got called for a dpi and theyre talking about garrett lmao cmon
llammaaaaa
l a m a r
great play call lets gooooooo
lets goooooooo
andrws td
llama
lj with the walk in babyyyyyyy
demeatrice jr
lessssss go baby
lamaaaarr4
feels good to be a ravens fan and a fantasy owner with lamar at qb1
i feel like lamar would be a great basketball player as well
not loving these outside runs its slippery out there jam it up the gut
tucker in commercials
can we get lamar some real cleats
this team with lamar compared to without is literally night and day
anyone else notice the browns were playing two high that whole drive gotta take advantage of that bet they dont do it this next drive
my boi fast
i honestly think chubb is still somehow underrated
easy money
bro please stop with these graphics espn they freak me out
o line didnt have a great game in week 1 vs the browns however lamar was great in avoiding the pressure and finding a play either with his arms or his legs we need him to have that same kind of game tonight pretty decent first drive
fuck now a opi of our own
thats two games in a row the ravens drew a pass interference call they didnt draw one in first 11 weeks of the season jeffzrebiec
i kinda miss booger these new guys are just boring and dont give great analysis at least booger was fun
and pi right back fuck
clark come on
what was the point of that chuck literally had the clamps on him
man our secondary is so much worse than they were early in the year
need a pick six
why is clark in man to man
weak call but that reciever really dressed it up
at least judon made baker pay for the free play nice
god damnit man that was a great sack but he fucking jumped
of course the one time we get a sack it doesnt even matter
wtf roughing the passer
damnit judon

edit nvm thats a bs call
fr
they was not pi
this defense doesnt play anywhere near its price tag we need to rely on offense to win these games and they re all on rookie contracts unacceptable
how is that on judon
what the fuck how is that roughing he sacked him
that was a clean hit idc soft league
what else is he supposed to do
that call was complete bullshit
hit his ass good fuck it
how was that rtp
roughing the passer
jesus christ what the hell are you supposed to do
are kidding me
weakest fucking roughing the passer ever
how the fuck is that roughing the passer
fucking bullshit
its not a tough call he has the football you shithead
some fuck ass roughing the passer go fuck yourself
rtp eat shit and die you fucking shill refs
man bullshit call
shit refs
fuck the nfl
fuck these refs its going to be one of those games huh
roughing the passer give me a fucking break on a normal play thats a sack you ref bitches they always fucking us youre not allowed to sack the qb now
fuck the refs
rtp
astros cheated
how tf are you supposed to tackle the qb
roughing the passer thats a fucking sack
how do you rough the passer on a sack
this is why football is losing viewers
so we cant play defense now
soft call
how is that roughing
what
lmao are you fucking kidding me
this field is total shit
gotta recover those
03 on fumble recoveries
ref ball gonna be strong both sides this game
third lucky fumble bounce jesus christ
these refs are trashhhh
unbelievably soft call on judon
calais fucking had the ball
these forced fumbles have given me blue balls
how the fuck do you push the ball to the other teams hands
we will get one be patient
what the fuuuuuuck
never catch a god damn break
lucky fuckers
this drive is so fun
fumbles are useless if we cant recover them
can we pls recover the fumble
great job by yannick to keep baker contained
thats absurdity to the maximum degree players should be furious about that
3 forced fumbles and no recoveries oof
ah of course forgot we have to play the refs too every week
d line is filling gaps like crazy all chub has is the cutback
good job mp
3 ff in the 1st quarter epic
of our last 5 forced fumbles we have recovered zero talk about shit luck
teams stay going for it against us
i fucking love my fruit punch
wow more fucking bullshit
refs game
this is so pathetic fuck off
the flag is bullshit
of course
smith didnt need to do that
lmfao fucking refs
soft call
he leaned down into that hit i cant fucking believe that call
unreal
what wass that call
ref ball at its finest
i dont think one play has gone our way on defense unreal
wow man wtf
holy fuck im about to fight the next person i see in black and white stripes this is horseshit
get the fuck outta here
that is such a soft call man

theyre flagging everything on both teams tonight
we play ourselves
touching the receiver ball is placed at the spot of the foul automatic 1st down
on pace for 20 flags this game
bullshit ass call
i hate this defense so much
what a fucking rigged game
can we get some laundry god dam thank you
give em the touchdown already fuck these refs
refs plan
defense has stepped up and the refs have blown 4 calls in a single drive
make that eight forced fumbles for marlon humphrey this season he is the ravens new singleseason leader ryanmink
refball
imagine having to worry about both the offense and the refs smh defenders have it rough man
quit whining b
tell em shut the fuck up peters
they are just going to bait bullshit calls with their plays at this point
hey espn

how bout all that pregame mayfield fellatio feeling dirty yet
man to man coverage my guy
nice throw baker
juiceman gets lucky
good stops boys
jimmy just almost got himself killed
judon cutting it close
browns gonna go for it and just throw their most reliable dpi cornergo route
baker threw 4 tds last week and thought he was brady
yay
haha bitch
hahahahaha
shank
woof woof
nice kick
lul
lol
lets goooo
fuckin bum
thats why they didnt want to kick
lfg
they thinking its madden in here
you aint tucker bitch
karma is a bitch soft ass browns
ball dont lie
missed fg nice
even the refs couldnt save the browns that drive
thats karma
he missed the 39 yard field goal
lololol
well thats why they were trying so hard to draw a penalty on 4th down or maybe see if they had something they liked they clearly dont trust their kicker we should always thank the lucky stars that tucker fell to us
ball dont lie
justin tucker would never
browns gonna browns
holy shit he missed
fucking bums
ball doesnt lie
browns always gonna browns somehow
suck it
lets go baby capitalize on that missed fg
ball dont fucking lie
ball dont lie tucker would never lets go mvp lamar is going to go crazy
browns get no points and we get good field position pretty good outcome after the refs fucked us
he had a big hole shoulda just ran it
should have handed it off
hand the fucking ball off
wtf are these plays
if only gus took it
greg roman is a fucking buffoon
run the fucking ball roman what is this man doing
we need to spend all our money on wrs lol this shit is ridiculous
run it roman
lamar really has to stop running right into his ol
he had no where to go not sure what he was thinking there
so much running space why do we come out passing
jesus christ
fucking greg roman
i hope greg roman knows that you gotta establish the ground game for play actions to work
solid back to back to back throws
fucking mud bowl or what fuck this field
not one run
well that was a waste of fucking time holy fuck
why is he slipping so much
lamar needs to change them boots
run the ball
wow what a mediocre drive
illegal motion what the fuck
lamar has to throw that early andrews has a decent chance to bulldoze across for a 1st
fuck turf man
someone get lamar different cleats
why does it seem like lamar is the only one that is slipping all the time i havent seen it happen once to anyone else
damn live by the lol die by the lol

that was a mess
same ole greg roman scheme and roughed up oline
why was that drive rushed
not running the ball once there is insnae
i always want to win and ho to the playoffs but that means we probably keep greg roman around a lot longer than we should
someone needs to get lamar some bigger spikes
i swear tyre phillips single handily caused that 3 n out
why is lamar slipping so much
a lot of effort for 3 yards
bs
more penaltiesjesus fucking christ
too many flags im turning this off so boring
fuck this
whether theyre throwing the flag for or against us i hate this crew
holy fucking shit
this team is so undisciplined
im so tired of our defensive penalties

and those mother fucking illegal shifts
the nfl must not want the ravens to win
why are you telling me this lisa
marlon lets go bby
lets go defense
why am i checking nervously around the field every play for yellow
nice touch on that ball baker
my man marly mar
get off the field
losing the field position battle
yes great bounce
did he change his cleats
lets see if roman can get hus thumb out of his ass im not holding my breath
cmoooooon lets get something going here
so why didnt he catch the ball there im new to nfl
do they have a cleveland institute film major working the camera your framing is really making this hard to watch
has anyone actually burst out into song when getting fast food
we need to give the d a rest especially with all the man were running
pathetic that the only guy gettin pressure on that third down is an injured cambell
at thr very least we need to take some time off the clock d is prob gassed
marlons touched the ball just as much as higgins tonight
this is a big drive for us if we can have a classic 2019 9 minute drive and the defense holds us into the half with a lead it would be huge for us getting ball back in the 3rd


sorry for the run on sentence nerves are high my babies
if the first play isnt a run or a read opition we riot
commercial acting still hasnt improved since the 1980s i see
myles garett being moty is a joke
browns trying to make moty into some kind of redemption arc for forced community service
f e e d d o b b i n s
ard wont see my nigga jk till quarter 4
yes greg more of that
wait what bashing someone in the head with a helmet is excellence in the field
look at that look what happens when you run the ball
would you look at that
why tf is garret their nominee
two runs in a row didnt know it did that
yup still no mention of the special teams play
myles garrett for walter payton man of the year is ironic af
hope we re sign gus
check out what happens when we run
wow run the ball have success
good job greg
who is better baker or lamar
dobbins getting cocky i love it
so funny that the browns nominated myles garett for walter payton man of the year after he started a brawl last season
looks like we should just not pass tonight
i have a better chance of being wpmoty than miles garrett
lamar might finished with 6 passing yards and multiple touchdowns
can anyone get open lol
im sorry man but myles garrett getting a man of the year nomination after that incident is such a joke lmao
stop talking about garrett and comment on the game
thats a flag on us if we barely hit baker on the ground
d o b b i n s
give dobby every touch
throbbin for dobbins
lets eat
holy f ricard
dobby
feed that man
give dobbins the ball baby
see you run with dobbins you get lots of yardage in return its not that complicated
why the fuck would we need to pass with this run game
wow lets goooooo jk is a beast
jk dobbins is amazing future all pro
amazing blocking keep giving the ball to dobbins
alright im all aboard dobbins as a runner if he learns how to block ingram might never see the field again
grown man run
flag rbs are not allowed to run 10 yards on the browns 20 yard penalty loss of 2 downs
gotta love jk
grown man football
feed dobbins
if i was play calling it would be jk runs until they stop it
run
dobbins is so freaking good
i love these kinda runs the best
this field is a fucking disgrace
i want dobbins to ball i also want his jersey lmao
after watching anthony mcfarland gas us two weeks ago i take a lot of pleasure from knowing that jk dobbins is breaking all the cleveland fans hearts
i think 90 of my comments on this sub are about how much i love dobbins
he hungry feed him
fuck this field
dobby bout snuck that outta here
ray rice 2
wow jk
can you imagine how intense this offense will be running the ball when we finally go 100 percent on dobbins and edwards with dobbins being our main back
this field is ass
trash ass field
man just ran 10 yards with forty people on him
bruh wtf is this field
awwww whats wrong myles
fieldgate
alright they gotta do something about this field soon
jk only a fantasy rb dobbins doing the dirty work
i love jk
sneeeeeeed
how is myles up for wpmoty didnt he try to murder fuckhead mason rudolph
hope hes okay but that helmet comment over him walking away got me
oh no couldnt have happened to a nicer guy
mans game football right now
ouch thats not good for garrett
nice play snead but thats im saying every throw is tight windows
browns should be flagged for 12 men on the field every play the field is literally tackling people
do we change cleats at half time
snead looking surprised it came his way
ok pack the middle lol
now were cookin
whats with this fucking slipping
thats my qb
ooooo baby you cant give lamar that corner nice run
if he aint slippin he dippin

x200b

oh boy
garretts a cool guy outside the helmet shit hope hes good
positive passing yardage
damn they got it off tho
snead so good
that looked like a good play toowhat a waste
run until they stop itbut thats just me
we running the ball finally
gus bus pay da man
big truss gus bus
gus bus next stop endzone
touchdown

all aboard the gus bus
all aboard the bus bitches
damn i wouldve loved to see the outcome of that sweep
woot
all aboard the gus bus were heading to easy moneyville
gus bus
not enough to over turn it


lets go defense time to eat
gus bus puttin on some miles
trust level
we cant even give the refs the opportunity to make this a game lets lay it on go birds
keep running that cant stop the run
beep beep mfers
dline getting pressure what is this madness
fucking laser by baker

x200b

fuck
what jarvis just did is what our wrs have no idea how to do
i hate that they have landry man dude is reaaally good
baker out there throwing the football like hes on the mound
i thought homegirl 2 would be on the sideline for a bit
the equipment manager chose some bad cleats or something the whole team needs to switch they are getting the traction to break on the ball the defensive backs shoulda got there if they didnt slip
damn it deshon
our linemen couldnt even push paper
a four hour show for the cfp
eliott needs to be more quick then that
they did so well last time why are they shitting themselves now
too easy
wow
right up the gut
this defense is soft as fuck
why arent we playing man
where is andrews
relax my gangstas 4 min drill score then score on the opening drive and we are up 14
this is some soft ass run defense that ive never seen played in purple and black
one defensive stop from taking over this game
ez 4 min drive truzz
its kinda funny that we put all our money in the defense and they just let them walk through us
nothing stupid put some points on the board and then go fucking change your cleats
the browns are good and will score is true but the browns arent causing chunk penalties on defense ravens gave them that entire second drive pure luck they missed the field goal
after the chiefs game im kinda disappointed duv hasnt had a big st play
please lets get some point before the half
fuuuuuuuck
fuck this turf
he needs to change shoes damn
that was fucking terrible did we not switch shoes
tyre phillips again
jesus fucking christ
can someone buy lamar some new fucking shoes
damn shoes
if he doesnt change his cleats at half hes gonna get injured
what the fuck are those routes
so do the coaches just see this shit and think its ok
this is fucking ridiculous
what in the fuck is this field
so fucking annoying
again fuck this bum ass oline
even from the back side view there is no one open before lamar is scrambling
can we just pick two damn running backs
we better not see another pass attempt on first down
greased the fieldgate
fuck is this field goddammit
why tf did justice hill just get a carry
phillips cant block vernon in pass pro if we at home can see it why cant roman
of course the browns are used to shitty fields
get a turnover weve had chances
hes gotta have another pair of shoes ready to go remember that seattle game last year he changed his shoes like 3 times
can we get lamar some new cleats not even joking this is absurd
lets get a pick
god awful way to end the half on offense lets hope something happens with the defense
3 fumbles that they all recovered and lamar slipping along with some questionable callsif we play like we did in the first 22 mins or so we can win by 10
we should play justice at safety hes such a good closer and tackler on st
shit turf confirmed
jokerrrrrr
elliot is gonna get himself hurt eventually
is it me or is this thread getting brigaded
yannick is so close
theres the hit stick
yo hill is a really good tackler
man do what the steelers did and just lay on them motherfuckers
thank god for elliot
right in queens hands
fucking joker is coming to play tonight
this team cant finish a fucking sack for its life bruv
this pass rush is getting so frustrating we have some of the best corners in the league and its not enough
at least these bum refs seem to do makeup calls still they are awfuk
grounding
intentional grounding
browns penalties are more effective than my wellbutrin against depression
wow they called intentional grounding
how do we always end up with the worst refs
yeah
lil bitch lookin for a flag
really makes you wonder why we like playing zone when we have 2 safeties whos strengths are primarily run support and tackling and 3 man 2 man corners
finally called it little bitch
cleveland and collapsing in literally the last 75 seconds of the half against the ravens iconic duo
judon got them ribs
no grounding

edit nvm
can we ducking play or what
points of any kind are great here
did baker always have the gap between his teeth
baker looks like the little brother of the you betcha video guy
flag on every other play
roman cant get out of his own way
espn has no idea how to run a broadcast
missed kicks
more sacks than pass attempts
its mnf in cleveland boys
they are going to change his cleats
we passed to the sideline good hollywood cant make a play for lamar bad
i need a gif of the cleats being taken off the sideline stat
where is mandrews

can we just cut half the wrs and look into like percy harvin and doug baldwin im desperate
i was about to be so mad at the soulja but lamar is making me smile too much
imagine if we had a wr that could dominate the game
defense better get their shit together
ive never been more sure we need to draft an interior o lineman first round when this offense can run its a fucking buzzsaw
alright theyre dickeating now lol
that picture of mark ingram reminds me of garrett atkins for the orioles
chris board is kenny young clone lol
mv fucking p
peters with the clutch tackle to cost them their last timeout
lmao tackled in bounds
rnfl can suck my balls
everyone wants a wr anyone willing to say we got greedy taking dobbins over a guy like jefferson genuinely curious
chuck omg
ice tackle by peters
clark running into the uprights because hes trying to make an interception for literally no reason lmao
chuck wth is wrong with you
clark pls
damn chuck
im happy with that half
oof
jesus
damn chuck dont knock yourself out
did we not learn from the hail mary against the cowboys when we only rushed one were lucky they didnt pull that off
this no rush prevent defense is ducking horrible
broslow down
cmon man
he was trying to throw it through the goalpost to show where the field goals are supposed to go
question of halftime what cleats will lamar start the half with
run the ball here please
alright o lets do work
why is hollywood still in the huddle
this game is like passing touchdowns never head of her
thanks zebras unironically
thank god he has new cleats
lamar has some allworld ugly throws under his belt this year jesus
lamar was so good at these little touch throws last season too
run the fucking ball
did these announcers snort a bunch of pastrami at half time
bailed out

lamar has got to hit those easy bunny floaters
damn i thought boykin saved that play
hate the bootlegs when teams always assign someone to watch lamar
oops
fucking thing of beauty
hello bitches
lamar
souja sighting
its gotta be the cleats
daddy
fuckkkkk yes
and that is exactly what we needed to start the half
gus bus baby
touchdown gus bus

i love it
run forest run
the double dutch gus
bronze those cleats
i blinked and we scored lol
lets go
yes lamar fucking yes do you baaby we loce you just the way you are
snead elite
gus looking smootheee
in the words of billy joel you got that easy easy money
run the ball baby
lets fucking go
running the ball works
well well well that was fun

what a drive
lamar is my savior
thats my quarterback
feed the hogs
fire greg roman
see that roman
groovy
fuckkk yeaaa
whos gunna carry the boats and the logs
let them mf run and eat
touchdown baby
defence have got to step up lets have a game where both sides of the ball play to their potential
where has this been all year
let lamar cook
browns fan saying well take second as if we wont over take them lmaoooo
just keep running
get at mayfield
come on d dont blow this
wheres your high 5s now cleveland fans

how comfy are those seats your asses are planted in
im feeling a turnover soon
lj 122 yards

lets gooo
i just got out of the shower i miss another ravens touchdown
defense is getting wise to that play action boot
lol every time i see lj in this thread i think people are talking about lj fort and not lamar
we never get sacks
they going to go for a trick play soon i can feel it
big baby on the double team
why do we give up this short bullshit
greesey saying baker is athletic when every other commentator says hes definitely not
what the hell lj
was he out
theyre going at clark on damn near every pass
good play

x200b

fuck the browns
fort man he was going there the entire way you gotta play the rb there
people are gonna make plays cant be too mad
defense is not good anymore wtf
jimmy smith is out man he is so unreliable at this point might be time to keep him in a webb type of role
the d winded af we still up by one
defense is kinda trash
ooof
lmfao he missed
can we please defend draw plays
thats so browns
how do we have the highest defensive payroll in the league
this rush defense has just been awful jesus
haha parkey choking
browns gonna brown lmfao
parkey sucks
offense and defense can never show up together
parkey is trash
defense has been sneaky bad the last 2 games
it doesnt matter if you strip the ball once hes in the end zone guys
lets run it back bb
koala kai commercial always a hit

hey

more mercy
this d needs more guys that can actually cover and one consistent pass rusher
jimmy smith questionable to return
our defense picked an ok time to be literal dogshit i guess
divisional games werent ever going to be easy
gus bus just refuses to go down i love it
jimmy smith questionable to return with a shoulder injury who would have guessed
inrhythm in route oh boy he is heating up
i get legitimately surprised anytime boykin gets a reception lmao
whoever swapped out our offense for this efficient one thank you so much
really hope we bring gus back next offseason
time for another lamar designed keeper lets gain 20
silly browns you cant leave a seam open up the middle
chick in blue on the mirror ad has one hell of an ass
fluker has no push
lol why is browns big ass trying to chop block a corner
the franchise cant be taking a lick like that just throw it away llama you expect too much
mandrews lets go
what a throw and catch man
what a throw first down
clutch
havent had an illegal formation yet
thats easily a first
and here i am thinking the oline hasnt had a bad game penalty wise
soulja
we havent had an illegal formation penalty yetbut we have had illegal motion
dobbins hurt
fuck we need that catch
fuck these flags
those fans should be wearing masks at least
wtf terrible pass
now that was a bad throw
he had him just a bit much on the touch
damn had a touchdown righth there
alright d lets get it back
cold as heck and lamar hasnt passed a tonne so doesnt have much touch or rhythm need to make that pass tho hopefully we come back and hit it next drive
defense is without jimmy smith so prepare to see baker targeting whoever they put out there
if we make the playoffs those are the throws you have to make or mahomes eats us for dinner again
i wish lamar would at least underthrow balls like that give the receiver some shot to come back to that ball or potentially draw a flag
after this season some stats guy should tally up every single time we get an offensive penalty and see how the drive ends because i swear any false start illegal formation or whatever we get just kills that drive and we punt it
hope tom house is still alive and available next offseason lamar gotta work with him
brooooo
terrible throw by greg roman there
bowserrrrrrr
yaaaaaaa boooiiiiii
yes

dammit
will hill flashbacks
ffs
fucking hell

fortunate that they missed one earlier still 14 points
browns lurker check you guys in here
if its blocked it doesnt count
and we have people not blocking anyone im sorry tucker you dont deserve that
goddammit they blocked the xp that could be a fucking killer
as if crushing the browns chance of winning the division wasnt enough were doing it multiple times in one game jesus god its not even my birthday
thats what im talking about
whenever i see bowser i always think hes orr and i cry a lil inside but bowser nice af
cmon
tyus bowser all of our new dads confirmed
a stop here would be huge


bowser i love you babyyyy
overunder was 46 who actually bet the over
fucking saw that happening its the only way to stop tucker
bowser telvin smith with pass rushing ability who says no

lol
im gonna say it bowser over yannick and judson when it comes to pay time
shut up landry
fuckin thank you hump for actually making the tackle
why cant we stop a screen ever
what the i didnt see him grab the facemask
71 moved that whole line
i have never seen an nfl team bitch about calls as much as this browns team is tonightnot even the tom brady pats
the irrational part of me wants doug pederson as an oc but i wont pretend to know what a player lamars caliber needs also what the fuck is going on with our mlb spots coverage reigns supreme all of a sudden for our mid lbs
get a damn stop now
we miss 20 sacks a game lol good stop though
great hustle sideline aint never missed a tackle
jesus christ we had that sack

can we please learn how to tackle
ouch thats tough to not have wills even its for just a few snaps fuck the browns but wills is a player i like
we cannot wrap up good stop d
this could be a make or break play
gotta go for it
missed a lot of sacks this game
4th and 4 play 10 yards off wtf
defense just cant get off the damn field
lets leave their number one target open by 5 yards
wtf was that
jesus christ they dont even hesitate to go for it on 4th down because they know theyre gonna get it
harris has been a dog
that should have been a sack but our tackling effort has gotten weak as hell again
harris has been good not really a liability imo
lol why are they not looking for pi
uncatchable
fourth down zone lovely
nice the fabled challenge timeout run a play end of quarter sequence
cannot allow dammit
fuuuuuiiick me
both o and d winded this is a good game
can we please put humphrey on the outside i dont get the infatuation with putting him in the slot
did we have 12 on the field didnt see the replay
lets regroup h
thats bullshit you can challenge to retroactively call a flag
how the fuck are we that stupid
lmfao 15 men on the field
they caught this in the hurry up
could really use another big play
just get them off the damn field
wasting a to there wouldve been dumb a good call to just take the 5
34 points were put up the defense better not f this up
this defense is so frustrating just a frustrating year all this money and we still cant stop the run the defense is almost as frustrating as the offense this year almost im tiring of peters
feels like more commercials than football why are the browns getting so many commercial breaks
fuck lj is in the locker room
we apologize for the temporary disruption of advertisements and now back to the ads
lamar have to take a leak
lamar isnt on the sideline
lamar need to piss or something
offense keeping us alive tn d cant tackle for shit
please be ok lamar
i dont need this stress
get that shit out of here
the defense will likely cave here for td but i feel like if the offense can eat a bit of clock and get td then were good
we need a wr safety iol and pass rusher
had to wipe the shit in his butt
he better get back out there before we get the ball back
where tf is lamar
ok ravens stop them here they will go for it again
baker keep tryna run like lamar lol
please defense please
its annoying that we have to waste a timeout because we have too many men again
crush them here
lets go d

x200b

edit its only 1 td we got this boys
are we going to call a fucking hold
great timeout

but i hate that 12 man on the field crap when guys are trying to get off
this defense is garbage man browns are gonna have 400 yards in this game
defensejust wowcan we get a game where both sides click
fuck this d
4th down d sucks
i fucking hate our useless def dude
wide open
wow 4th down td
so thats why peters plays off
these commercials are killing me
lamar cramps
defense is so bad
poor peters
now peters is hurt we cant have shit
looked like peters blew a muscle there unfortunately
well need another 7 here we have no defense today
4th downs man smh
ok guys soon as i turned this game as i got home from work the browns drove down the field and scored i better turn it off as i dont want to jinx the ravens
yall are complaining about harris just wait until you see the next guy
they going for 2 a stop on this would still be huge
jesus christ we gotta keep them from this 2 pt conversion
lamar questionable with cramps
god damn it peters not only did you not keep your feet and blow a coverage but youre hurt now too we need warm bodies in the secondary
lamar questionable
lamar questionable to return with cramps
thats fine lets just run it down their throats again no problem
shit faster man
defense fucking sucks they play way off and are soft as hell
lamar got the cramps wonder if he getting an iv
wtf
are you kidding me
omfg reverse browns
we have the worst fucking luck are you joking me

thats just fucking stupid
alright lets keep pounding the run
omg

mr big drop jr
idk who even takes peters place
this guys no wr fuck 15
baker is a bitch
baker the worst sportsmanship
what happen to lamar
now is the time we need a defensive stop
fuck this season
why cant we just put marlon press man on landry
over or under on that shit taking two drives
those extra pounds fucked up his catching
why are we blitzing when we can never get pressure on the qb
im sad
what happened to lamar i missed a few minutes
how do i know based on the offensive alignment vs our defense where the ball is going to go and the players and wink dont know
if this defense doesnt lay over and die i will be shocked prove me wrong ravens
this is where the team has been demoralized sorry to say
the defense cant make a tackle to save their lives
what a clown ass season
were so bad at the simple things
defense is soft as hell man
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
oh yea after you just said he was faking his leg injury oookay
they can do anything against us
they match down the field on every drive this defense simply cant do a thing
something on d bout to happen just saying
wink is honestly mad overrated
if we choke this game we deserve to lose honestly
defense is killing me
defense likely tired too
this is gonna be a soul crusher
we need a turnover here
godtheyre going to drive all the way down the field
need a to in the worst fucking way
30 yard run coming
all of a sudden we cant stop them
theyre targeting 33 like crazy
hey guys they might be running the same play
same fucking play over and over wtf
fucking choke hold on calais for fuck sake
dean pees flashbacks
imagine being an announcer amd sucking clevelands dick
not like this
lamar please come back fuck
defense is simply unable to make a stop first down after first down the browns just continue to march downfield to the end zone what the fuck has our defense become
what a way to end the season
is this the part when lamar comes back next position and the ravens win the bourbon bowl or is this the wrong movie
what happened to jimmy glass man smith
tempo is killin this tired defense
defense been frauds for most of the year
harris is getting cooked all game who is this guy
how many ravens does it take to tackle nick chubb 15 apparently
this defense is just irrelevant in coverage
davontae harris is so soft cut him
secondary is selling this game
shoving their shit right down our throat
im done with this game so done
d line getting held a lot
just need two more stops please
i hate football man
this shit is like laughably bad at this point
lamar come back pls
lamar where you at
rip this season
theyre in four down territory right now especially with trace at qb
this is embarrassing wake the fuck up

overrated defense fucking sucks cant cover cant stop the run cant tackle and cant rush the passer
in tucker we trust
fuck this
fuck that
game
just gave it to them
where the fuck is lamar why when he does things hes gone like houdini and we cant stop these guys
cbs and safetys watch that slow piece of shit run 10 yards for a touch down
thank god ninjago went to the marquise brown school of catching
nightmare fire everyone
can we block their pat this time
the browns actually suck and we bailed them out a dozen times
how do you not call a hold on that come on refs
is lamar still out
rip
all these dumbass fuckers on defense keep over pursuing and arm tackling
soft
i dont even get the hope of lamar coming back and winning the game cuz he has cramps
this is where we fight with or without lamar we still have tuck
sometimes i wish i never started watching football i cant deal with all these heart attacks
my heart cant handle this season man
defence is fucking pathetic jesus christ man
defense is an absolute fucking joke this year
brown better not even be on the field

we dont have anyone to keep others in line there isnt a single person playing with discipline on defense to keep it in check
how the fuck did we blow a 14 point 4th quarter lead unfuckingbelivable
this is how the ravens season go after being embarrassingly upset by the titans in the playoffs
see we get humphrey saying its our identity to choke we play ourselves i wish we played with fire you can just feel this team deflate like a balloon when things get tough
just gut this fucking team no heart on the defense no receiving weapons on the offense
harbaugh with the shocked pikachu face
please come back lamar
did lamar really had to poop he had that oh shit i just sharted run back
rip season
our coverage sucks with jimmy out and apparently averette out we cant do that and of course that glorious browns ol never holds
big game trace
forgot about being up 2814 this is literally like the 2014 playoff game vs new england two blown 14 point leads
well if lamar is out were done not a chance
get a field goal at least
no lamar

time to throw it on a dime
what that burger king ad fails to realize is that if the big plastic burger king surprised me in the drive through lit by a candle i would accelerate
if trace wins the game he becomes a legend
purple bros i know the pain
are you kidding me
where is dealdash finding these ps4s for over 300 lol
holy shit this is a legit nightmare
just run the ball
what the fuck else could go wrong
fade me
if hes cramping thats on coaching
this is the worst coaching staff of all time
what a stupid game
greg what the fuck

greg roman is a dummie
gregs gonna call 3 passes isnt he
roman is a goddamn idiot
this really sucks guys
fucking pathetic play calls ontop of everything
game over we are trusting mcsorley to passroman is not running we are done
2nd and long and we run
i think theyve scored more total points tonight than any of these matchups combined over the last decade im used to 129 balcle games
yo that run with the fake hollywood jet dont never work
the worst shit about this situation people gonna say lamar bitched out i can already see nfl circlejerking to it
greg roman is a pos
i cant believe this is how our season ends to the fucking browns and with our star qb cramping up in the locker room sad day
willie snead is lowkey clutch
0 momentum or heart
need iv snead leggooooooooooo
snead you lucky fuck
if i could feel i would cry

holy shit
wtf is this game
i have no idea how to feel about hollywood
unreal the ups the downs lets fucking go boys
im still so nervous in this defense please give me something clutch
if we hold on to this game this is the potential turning point no some loss to the steelers keeping them undefeated
what happen to cut brown lmao
lamar like ok cool im gonna go take a shit
how about some love for gus throwing that lead block with pat hurt
wow
my heart cant
you cannot write this shit
i dont think ive screamed that loud since the mile high miracle
lamar our hero
i call upon the energy of ed reed and ray lewis
ahh ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
team of destiny motherfuckers
please fucking kill baker on the next drive
dobbins please fuck my gf
defense needs to step up
marquise brown is kewl
lets fucking gooooooooo
god i fucking love lamar
lamar jackson is savior
jk dobbins with the absolute hammer run
okay i kinda take it back soulja
alright so im a die hard steelers fan but is a fucking gaaaaame hope baltimore pulls it off
too bad we dont have a defense and the browns are gonna run down the field and score then win in ot
im still mad at hollywood he cant keep playing with my heart like this
man im still mad at him but wow that a miracle play
what a legend comes running back and throws a td after one play
give the man some imodium hes earned it
lets fucking gooooooo
yo that was still another fucking body catch this man cannot stop
hollywood picks the strangest times to actually be good
what a tale by llamar
im so tense
why couldnt hollywood take a dive at the one and give us the chance to end it without giving cleveland this much time
uh just like we planned it
do it defense do it
and fuck
whatever happens this is an absolutely amazing game you cant write this shit
this is the fucking game thats gonna push us to the super bowl i know it
toilet paper on lamar foot when he walked out the locker room
someone needs to help harris help him wink
my mvp
this fucking defense is going to do this to us
i always lie to myself that im gonna turn the game off glad i lied
fuck
the way lamar ran into the locker room vs the way he ran out he totally had to take a shit
ok i thought harris was doing well but hes been ass the last few plays lol
bruh harris couldnt even shove that man and he was in the fucking air
33 is a liability
peoples jones has been taking 33s lunch money all night
okay defense now is the fucking time
the cam of llama running out yes
best case scenario here is baker leaves enough time for the offense to score a field goal
i played cornerback in middle school what are my chances for the ravens
harris been getting beat all night anyway
this field sucks
this is it defense can you please fucking show up
prayers up to trace though that man is a fucking goat just like lamar
defense come the fuxk on earn your fucking money
anthony levine should be coming in at corner now i believe
you guys think if the browns get a td they going for a special point or for a 2 points to fuck with us
please defense i beg you
defense please
i fn hate this anemic defense
levine is a veteran at least
imagine having a defense worse than this
come on d pls dont fuck us
come on d
stop signing old ass players jimmy smith and brandon carr
fuck put snead or andrews out there over harris at this point
lamar doesnt deserve this d
levine on landry oh lawwd
why is levine on landry
not activating averett was a mistake
defense smd
damn defense man
this is some shit youd do in fucking ncaa 14
jesus christ man
this whole defense can get outta here
lmaooo this defense
more 10 yard cushions wink is trash
fuck it they gave us enough time to win it
worst defensive game we played in a long long time
what the fuck marlo
defense is garbage holy shit
do they go for 2
much time
damn it
our best chance of winning was hollywood falling down and killing the clock this defense fucking stinks
did you really give up on that fucking tackle
is it possible for the steelers browns and ravens to all make the playoffs
good news they scored quick
this is why you should of took a knee inside the 5
my emotions are burned out
what is hump even doing lately
lamar has to carry so damn hard this is sad
here we go lamar save us from this hell
our defense fucking sucks today man
trash
just play man we are trash at zone
this defense is gonna kill me
miss miss miss pls
that may actually be a good thing
a minute with the best kicker in the league is a long time
now that makes two of us to crap our pants
ok guys
its just fucking cringe to watch our defense in the 4th
oh my god whats happening
of course defense chokes
ive never hated a defense more than this
what the hell are we doing
we need new coordinators for real
defense cant get a stop
enough time for field goal
wow just wow this defense
lamar will get it in fg range
one stop thats all we need
the fact that cleveland isnt going for two against our paper thin defense
this is the worst i remember the ravens d ever playing this season this is not ravens d idk what the fuck this soft crap is that im looking at
another miss here would be nice
we have the best kicker in the league im confident
cody gonna miss
yeah so we definitely need another corner or safety
wink try adjustments dude
what the fuck is marlo doing
please whiff the 2 poiny
block this extra point
this defense is inexcusably bad for the money were paying them
how tf is marlon getting beat by a rb
lamar gonna drive to a field goal
good mad it took them that long honestly now let tucker try and win it
could get help from parkey here
cmon parkey blow it
wink not good enough
was wink crying on the sideline
holy shit its almost midnight

guys we didnt choke is this real life
im pacing so much need these 2 seconds gone
this is why you pay justin tucker

tucker
as udinez stated this game shall from this moment forward will be known as the cramp game
its not over until the clock hits zero not with this shit defense
my chest hurts and my arms just went numb do i need to call an ambulance
tucker is our dad
thats why hes the goat
daddy tucker
shots
lmfaoo
damn man im shaking
craziest game i have ever seen in my life
no way im going to fall asleep tonight no way
insult to injury
thats my qb
that was an incredible game holy hell
absolutely electric safety
tuning into espn all week
that was some shane falco shit gotta have heart
yes tears tears thats what you get for breaking quarantine
turning point of the seasonlets goi
safety
holy hell
one word yippppeeeeee
another miserable failure in a big moment defense fails every time they need to every single time
i feel a turnover coming
garbage defense
im not trying to be a doomer or anyting but were playing like absolute shit right now on defense
enough with the 4 running backs every time justice hill is in something bad happens
mark andrews is a god damn souljia not some fucking midget wanna be butter fingers asshole who cant keep his mouth shut
i love lamar dudes jersey is hanging up on my wall they cant give him anything close to mahomes money
peters ofc lol
the classic im hurt to mask the fact he didnt even try to get up when he tripped
i do not believe that peters is hurt i think hes tryna cover for his trash play in the most critical moment of the game to this point

sorry if im wrong in advance
boy do i hate being right all the time i just knew this team would choke away that leadhow because it is the 4th fucking time
question 1 why does gus have 5 attempts when he is averaging 8yds per carry

question 2 when is the last time we have had a sack whats the point of signing ngakoue he has done nothing but over shoot the qb a couple times a game
yall axting like we cant come back even if we dont fuck you
chiefs would realistically score 80 on us today
typical soft ass ravens miss when we had real men playing for us everyones accountable for this season no heart
tfw you have the nervous shits for a football game
fuck our opponents and getting lucky with fumbles
fucking piss poor defense that was one of the worst drives ive seen us have all year
first drive of the game is a td gonna be a looooong night
defense looked good that first drive just need to tighten up a bit
looks like they watched the chiefs game and figure it out screens are our weakness
ngl that was a terrible throw
if people didnt notice that deep ball wasnt side arm which is how is normally throws so it wasnt the best bad you could say but thats what happens when you have no offseason
now if the def can get their heads out of their tailpipes
how is that clevelands ball again asking for a friend
fuck the refs
the nfl is an actual joke this is so biased
go fuck yourself mayfield drew your own player with your constant hard count
enough with these flags wtfff
little baker gets tossed easy tho
what is up with this field
the turf is too slippery
but also that play design was ass some wr was right in the same line of sight as the deeper andrews fuck gro
jesus fucking christ
fuck the fucking refs
how many plays until lamar slips
illegal formation call coming on a 3rd and 6 on this drive pushing us back to 3rd and 11 which will then be a pass play where the line collapses in 2 seconds resulting in a sack calling it
broke 300k covid deaths today and theres people in a stadium cant have billionaire team owners not make even more money i guess
aw he hurt his elbow awwww poor guy
oh shit thats huge hope you feel better tomorrow instantly
lamar is still the goat roman just cant use him a good oc would have got us a ring last year
i am surprised it was upheld
chubb is literally thanos
fuck this season

this needs to be a wake up call for edc and harbs
why the fuck are we even using justice hill why does he do better than dobbins why cant we let anyone get into a rhythm
yes we all know how much you want greg roman fired
okay so the equipment guys didnt bring extra cleats this team is so fucking annoying at times can we ever have an even shot we always make thing difficult for ourselves shit is infuriating greg roman youre a fucking idiot fuck you and your shit scheme you cunt
chargers fan here seeing real anthony lynn vibes from that play calling just know that it could be worse than roman
holy shit is that the first opi called in our favour this year
how is it not intentional grounding
fuck hollywood
if he leads mandrews on that throw its a td
who sucked more perriman or brown
im still grumpy that flacco deliberately ignored lamar wide open in the endzone in 2018
dang that was a dope drive steelers fan checking in pulling for you guys
so weird its like we get confirmation trump is out of office and the whole world starts to go back to normal
riddick killin a man on live tv lol
any clue when we are going to start covering people
why is peters playing off on a rb
fuck the browns
that td is on harbs he missed a clear challenge on the pass got only 1 foot in bounds
lfgggg
again anyone not 44 on this defense can kick rocks
why do we spend so much on defense lol
ravens and fucking important drives with dumb shit penalties
fuck man that needs to be a td
2 really bad throws at a bad time
god damn lamar
christ almighty if lamar was accurate
how tf do you miss that
cmon defense dont blow it again
12 players on the field fucking inexcusable
i feel like 15 on the field is somehow so terrible its great
defense is dangerously bad
wide open touchdowns all fucking year
fuck this defense so much man
peters and elliott are becoming liabilities
coverage is awful peters has been a let down this year besides a couple games
it wasnt analytics they dont trust their kicker
have a feeling we are about to blow another lead
fuck browns butterfinger ass
wtf happened to lamar
how can the losing team look 100 better
guys we just need a field goal
this type of game is the worst id rather get blown tf out
i swear our defense thinks its hockey and theres only 3 periods
34 points and we are going to fucking lose this season is over we dont deserve the playoffs
this is what a team that doesnt deserve to make the playoffs looks like
im preparing my blame of the game post rn lamars bowels
haha delay of game with a bum kicker my god they still are the cleveland browns
fact is the ravens defense has been mediocre or complete ass cheeks since maybe 2011 they arent going anywhere ever with this soft ass shit
we deserve what ever we get this season calais campbell and all these jokes on defense aint winning a championship
fuck studying for finals just gonna watch the ravens choke another lead eh
losing to the browns because lamar had to poop how fitting
we lose
25 years of tough gritty play dirty birds play like a raven lewis reed suggs this team fucking weak it makes me sick
why havent we even tried to run the ball with our backup qb in
why dont they just say lamar is taking a shit
this has tv movie written all over itqb comes from the crapper on 4th down
defense about to blow this game

again
fire the entire defense jesus tapdancing fucking christ
harbaugh 100 said let them score

lamar with 104 a timeout and only need a jt field goal yes plz
everything on lamar again were going to have to pay him half our salary cap
martindale has really choked this game
justin tucker ill suck your dick
lamar on the outside looking in for the mvp race now
time for this pussy ass defense to give up a long drive and score
imagine trying to run the option with trace mcsorley when you spent a first round pick on jk dobbins


edit 2nd my bad
our line backers are fucking so bad im talking all time bad at 24 positions below replacement level shit tier queen need to sit for a while and think about watching a little bit of film board needs to be cut immediately if you dont want to tackle you cant be a raven
why the fuck is ingram on the field
were getting absolutely fucked by the refs right now
i hate baker and the browns with a passion but tbh some of the commercials make me laugh
this defense would be so much better with earl thomas shame he went full psycho
we have an opportunity to go up two scores now
im calling it

trace mcsorelys touchdown bomb was the turning point of our season
we got this in the bag
our defense really fucking stinks man
4th down is so lame in this league now virtually everyone goes for it and most defenses allow a 1st down on 4th down as if its early in the game and its 2nd and short
this defense cant set the edge defend a screen or tackle the qb kind of adds up to a recipe for failure
spent hella money and picks for this shit ass defense
gonna lose 3534 cause tucker missed the xp
biiigggg trruuussssssss
we walk off on primetime and they still sucking clevend dong lol
most overrated defense ive ever seen lmao
this sub is so toxic
the browns are dogshit literally whoop the fuck outta these turds
jeffzrebiec

ravens say cb jimmy smith is questionable return with shoulder injury


the guy was on the injury report all week with a groin injury and somehow he goes out there and injures his shoulder too might be time for him to hang it up soon
dude how does an nfl qb just butcher those two passes back to back
ravens choke away another one 2020 folks
any other qb and they say he overthrew it whatever a good qb will do that 3 times a game with lamar its bad pass his mechanics are off
lamar makes that play 910 chill

how is that not offensive pi he manhandled peters
its over cant believe i stayed up again to watch this pathetic fucking team just quit fuck this team man
lamar cant throw i hate to say it but thats 7 points he just cost us
everyone who doesnt think we can win this game
i fucking hate monday night football fuck espn and their thieving bullshit agreements
good start i hate roku im 22 seconds behind so everyone not comment 22 seconds after the play plz
couldnt tell if fort or harrison but terrible job by the weak side ilb
there was holding on every play that drive
but honestly our d is sleeping rn
idt ive ever seen us pull off a flea flicker play
i already want to go to bed lol
trash ass cleveland field trash ass city
powers is fucking trash
jesus their field is so shitty lamar needs longer spikes
that was not roughing the passer wtf
i really hope someone rattles mayfield hes such a cock
these refs saving the browns ass rn
fuck the refs so much
refs bailing out cleveland on this drive lmfao
tried and true lol in the browns game thread after they brick is undefeated
god god their field is horrible
peters needs to brush his teeth
d line getting no push safeties cant cover o line cant protect will have to rely on our stars to make plays today
not gonna lie i loved when miles hit mason with his helmet lmao
hope garrets ok
this is why we dont need a big time wr 2 td drives with 1 pass on each keep investing in the run game and the passes will open up on play action
fuck yeah dude nutscom
is this not the voice
really bro we are buds and all but if you tell me about your high school playing days in comparison to professionals im going to flip
banned from rnfl for 3 days lets get it yall lmao
literally all this offense does well is run thats it it is one dimensional as fuck
to all the browns fans creeping around here you aint shit
if we throw at all greg needs to be fired at the half its clear we have no targets and cant buy lamar 2 seconds
i know their bros but lamar needs to ignore brown unless he is absolutely wide open with now one around
lamar is playing great tonight
im downvoting anyone who doesnt vote lamar for player of the game if we close the game out s but not really
bad throw
baker aint a franchise qb
second foot toe dragged the ground before landing out with that being said please answer this lamar
if we dont answer here they will tie it up
kareem td just lost me fantasy playoff
this defense doesnt want to tackle its like a bunch of patty cake out there these are apparently alphas out there and they look straight bitches
can we see some more andrews im starting to forget hes on the team
lamar cant over throw that man dang it
stop leaving so many fucking plays on the field
aaand twice in a row he throws to nobody this guy needs to open both eyes when he throws

again if you cant throw an all run offense only lasts about 35 quarters and we didnt run up enough points to endure a runaway 4th qtr this game is not secured
two missed throws
i dont trust our defense
what the fuck
that was on tucker he chunked it like i chunk my driver off the 1st tee
fuck joe buck
hands to the faceon his chest
12 man on d they probably got us wtf
are we scared to call tos on defense for a reason or
first half we couldnt capitalize on the forced fumbles we have to convert on this pressure up two scores isnt enough right now with the way our defense is letting the run go all day long
yall before we overreact too much i think the browns offensive is actually pretty decent so im not gonna worry too much unless we struggle like this against the jags
bench the coaches
does lamar have the shits again
hes laying a mud monkey in the urinal
wow mp
soft as shit
fucking hell our safeties suck in coverage
thought he could have just run for the first but that works too lol
peters been getting smoked all year
sit hear and cry about bad luck but we put ourselves in this spot time and time again its nothing new
fucking marquise
we need more souljas bitch we need some fucking hands fuck you son of a bitch
why do we draft such trash wrs why cant we draft good ones pain dont draft the short skinny guy of course he cant catch didnt learn that from perriman
we going to end up losing because harris and lamar had to take a shit
there has been a shift in momentum its always bad for us
fuck this sorry ass softasdogshit team
thats game fuck this shitty ass defense
elliot legit cant play coverage
get the fuck back here lamar if our playoff hopes go because youve got fucking cramps i will be livid one series i understand but that should not be a gameending injury
i dont trust trace mcsorley here havent seen him enough jesus chrsit not like this
every fucking week same shit what a fucking joke
no matter the outcome its moments like this that make football so exciting to watch this is going to be a crazy next 6 mins
better fucking score on this drive lets go dont be doomer s yet
this white guy sucks

mcsorley has no arm we are not going to win running the damn ball for a couple yards every time from here on out

prayers for trace hes not a backup qb hes practice squad lets hope tucker can get it lamarrrrrr
the goat is back theres no way he was injured btw lol definitely bathroom you see him running
im going to bed fuck this game
ah yes on a 3rd and 2 why not give it to our strongest rb lets give it to a dude whos more of a tik tok meme than a football player good job roman
the fuck is this field made of
not forgiving your bum ass but nice job
why are the chiefs wearing browns uniforms
the mood change when watching the offense vs defense
plz dont choke im having flashbacks
marlon has been terrible this year aside from the forced fumbles
no leaders on this defense all those guys are fucking losers
wink is a fucking coward
am i dumb for thinking hollywood should have gone down at the 1 milk the clock kick the field goal
i think its its time to fire wink and get a whole new scheme this shit is not cutting it
lebum
this cunt wont shut about how good the browns are
that was amateur hour by the browns somebody going to get hurt with that nonsense
defense isnt gonna hold up this game you can tell already
campbell shouldnt be playing like at all
first drive and about 35 yards of obvious penalties on the browns not called going to be a long night
this defense is very overrated
put trace in u cowards
another illegal shift penalty terrible team
fuck i hope garrett is okay
half of these assholes arent even wearing a mask

edit the fans
why put somebodys business on the street
lamars touch and feel from last year is gone sadly
fucking penalty killed that drive lamar had to pass to try to over come it and we have to punt
god damn we really need wrs that can compensate for lamars deep overthrows
guys chuck clark is a liability in pass coverage
another turnover coming up truss
lazy fucking ass players im sorry that is just pathetic no hussle no heart
removed
run d still a huge problem same old ravens
all of you who begged for trace to come in all year you caused this
lol no one gives a fuck what lebitch has to say
baker with an alltime game on mnf

ravens gonna win tho like i said

fuck id give my left nut to have baker instead of trubisky fml
this sub fucking implodes when there is diversity good lord
said it before ill say it again this is my least favorite ravens team in years prima donna bullshit underperforming pussies
can we get rid of peters this offseason a 4th even
where the fuck is the mvp though looool
fuck all you haters dont be in here celebrating when we win punk ass
plenty of time left

x200b

panic for the nonbelievers
is it too late to take back humphries millions
i hate this team i actually hate them
down 1 7 mins left anything can happen dont panic you guys have the best kicker in the league just need a couple first downs on this drive
shows why we needed thomas
if wink and roman arent gone by next season harbs needs to go also they are holding this team back
well need to be a different team than weve managed to be since week one to pull this out lets hope our ravens are ready to physically dominate this team
wont be long now
our entire season depends on this game i really hope their play reflects this

we need old school ravens football tonight lets go boys
fuckkkkkkkkkkk
fuck these kids bro lets fucking go
i really want to start on defense
lets go flockk lets show em why we still in the picture and shut these browns tf down
i smell blowout which way idk

man im hoping for the w but idk what offense were going to get tonight
if we win tonight who has the tiebreaker us or the dolphins
win or go home boys lets go
plz win
this feels normalish
i know we got all the pieces to win this game lets go
my heart
mmmm
good sign to start off
get that pressure yes
what a hit were getting in mayfields hat early tonight
do that every time they pa
here we go ravens here we go
can i get a fuck the browns from everyone
yes big hit early on let him know what we about
why is ferguson inactive
happy holidays flock lets eat this w
how old is mcphee
thats a hold
set the tempo lets go
judon what a great hit
not getting stonewalled at the line of scrimmage would go a long way to stopping screens
chris board huh
sit down x2
chris board needs to hit the weight room
already bs no call on the conklin hold i saw that through my tv but the refs somehow missed that
how many times are we going to let teams shit on us with screens
ahh yes the screen our true weakness
why is board getting snaps over fort and harrison
jesus we cant defend screens at all
get board off the field
get boards bum ass out of the game already
sit down jarvis
landry got hit hard lol but of course theyre going to do that shit
i fucking called it
always with the trick plays against us
whats with our utter inability to stop screens
judon is hurt
goddam screens
chris board is playing a lot for a team that has queen fort and harrison in front of him
damn screens
this gimmicky ass shit lol
landry got lit up but still completed it
steelers 2 yard pass after 2 yard pass
browns screen after screen
fucking killing us on play action
literally the same fucking play
moving the ball so easy on us
we never cover tight ends
damn it
middle linebacker is still a major weakness on this team i hope queen gets a lot better in the offseason
god damn our defence is getting sliced
njokoue seems to be a problem for us most games
this game is fucked defense still hasnt woken up from 2 weeks ago
holy shit
any chance thats an incomplete
marlon again
we need to do what other teams do to us tell our far ends to go after the qb no matter what
pernell just has no speed at all man
marlon
7 on the year now insane
browns looking competent
lucky ass
does that count as another ff for marlo
how is that not a face mask
higgens is a weak link
so unfortunate on these ffs
two bad bounces already smh
what was that tackle if he didnt fumble thats a td
marlon again omg we gotta get that fumble for him
lol
embarrassing
welp
meh
damn it
fucking straight garbage
way to easy
not a great start
lol
lol
shit
nice judon

press man and live with it
defense is good the offense has proven to score big off of romans 6 play playbook this season this w is in the bag
duverney is so so close to breaking one off
tf kinda drive was that
defense got worked on opening drive with ease
come the hell on guys
stop making the browns pleased
ingram doing the dirty work sigh
amazing graphic
not enough separation for the flea flicker
what the fuck was that
yeah dobbins better get a lot more touches tonight
embarrassing play right out the gate
a fucking flea ficker what
greg roman has found the invention of the flea flicker
yeah that is not us what is that play call
bruh
amazing how basic shit works
you cant do a flea flicker if you have no one to throw to lol
yo what the hell
how is that the first play you run how about run it then try that wtf man
that was the poorest execution of a flea flicker ive ever seen lmao
how do you not throw the ball on a flea flicker cmon lamar pull the trigger
awful execution on that flea flicker
holding 3 and out
ffs dude
bro wtf just run the ball
phew
oh my god what is this playcalling
i dont think our blitz will work they expected this from us and their short passing is working we have a solid defense but were trash when it comes to screens
defense holding ok not on us
defense had 10 in the box there ten
that is our bread and butter

run those last 2 plays over and over again
i love getting under center need to do it 510 times a game better play action looks and possibility of qb sneaks
gus bus lets go
dumbass penalty on the offense drink
delay of game for real
motherfucking flags
dumbass
fucking delay of game really
damnit man
theres one of those downs that we waste every single game
sigh a fucking delay of game wtf
cant have that happen
these are the little things that fuck us over we need to play less sloppy
sloppy
shouldve called timeout wtf
theres the penalty on us
pi
hahahahahahaha
lol
that was the dumbest penalty ive ever seen lol
lmao that was some of the worst pi ive seen all year
soulja
underthrown but ill take the penalty
the dragon special
that was dirty
marquise with the clutch
that was dirty
somebody blow a ref up
the fuck was that lmao
great tackling by the cb there
that was a bad throw
lmao just let hollywood open he aint gonna catch it
lamar looks gimpy out there
target stewart over and over hit their weak spot
lmao he just fell on him
yeah im definitely happy to see jackson just take the escape route and go he was always trying to make throws happen earlier in the season and i understand that but do the thing youre good at when it has to happen
do we not run slants
lol nice hip toss dude
i miss when our red zone offense was a sure thing
lamar keep doing this man if the receivers cant get separation you beating these dudes
quise is giving this dude headaches already
man how many times is lj gonna slip in one drive lol
how is it possible to slip literally every time he runs
wtf are these announcers doing
first time someone tackles dobbins 1 on 1 and its some fucking db come on dobby
lets gooooo
was fluker benched already or did the espn graphic not realize it was phillips
nice run
i knew it was lamar up the middle i knew it the whole time on that play
everyone needs some big truss right now browns are finished
vision was crazy
thats our boy
lamar jackson

touchdown ravens
yes good play
touchdown
what an answer time to step up d
old school canadian football history in a field that was frozen they put staples through the bottom of the cleats to give them better traction
youtube tv so behind
a game of whistles
gg ez we winning this game boys
we had our first drive and there is only 3 minutes left in the first talk about burning clock
marlon is being vocal
lb are a little lost rn but the dl is not getting moved
yassss lamar
wtf man
dumb
damn it chuck
clark just turn and its an easy pick
thats a good call
just cant do that
same nonsense they just pulled that was getting caught either way
98 jumped
dammit bwill
aint gonna count just watch
oof
great i love flags
that was such a needles penalty by clark he was literally stride for stride with him

why does it feel like cbs cant play defense anymore
fucking soft
their boos give us strength

time to stunt on these hoes
they just got 45 fucking yards for free this is some bullshit
bro terrible penalty you had him covered just turn around and its a pick
that was soft ass shit
weak league for calling clark and that roughing the passer
espn sucks
these announcers are terrible
the graphics are terrible
ofc judon sacks on a free play
weakest rtp ive seen all year
uh
soft ass call
that is not roughing the passer in any world you blind old fuck
how is that roughing the passer
these refs are a joke
how tf is he supposed to sack him wtffff
fuck baker
bullshit call
how the fuck is that roughing
bs
jesus christ thats some shit
how
thats a good penalty any time you have a chance to blow up the quarterback you take it take the 15 yards and dont apologize
these refs man garbage every fucking week
gtfoh
absolute bullshit call
bruh what he supposed to do
roughing the passer
if that is roughing the passer refs should receive 10 lashes for each missed call after the game
bullshit
2020 ravens football right here
how in the eff is that roughing the passer
dumb penalty for chuck
soft ass fucking call
roughing the passer my ass what the fuck was that call

effin crap call
offsides is correct but that is a weak ass personal foul call what the hell

im so used to watching shitty refs at this points
chuck clark man every week hes getting taken advantage of in coverage

fruit punch on one tonight just need to get the ball back
fruit punch anyone
mmmmmm no

wtf
wtfffff
god fucking dammit
they dont know how to hold into the ball lmao

chubb just got his ass fisted in that pile lol

just keep going after the ball
theres fumble luck and then theres what the browns have tonight
nice throw baker
yeah buddy fumble recovery

wow gotta stop this
just rotten luck on these forced fumbles so far
welp here we go refs win
why cant we recover a fumble

no no no no no no
browns are and will always be some bitches
all refs
jimmy is a fucking idiot
fucking hell
goddamn it
come the fuck on are you kidding me
youve gotta be fucking kidding me
lol
this is crazy
our lbs are really undisciplined up hat shoulda been a catch
blah fart blah
he didnt even have to do that wow
wyy do that just rush toward the ball and pick 6 it
soft
said it last week this team is undisciplined with penalties
wtf
if im a browns fan im pretty scared for whole game fumbled 3x and luckily kept possession

and getting call after call cant last forever i would think ravens get some makeup calls later
shocked thats not interference
not even done with the first quarter and the officiating is a an absolute disgrace where do they find these geriatric fucks
holy shit i usually dont think reffing is that bad as people think but this first quarter fuck
theyre kicking the fg
lmao suck it
nice kick
love it
haaaaaaaaaa
lets go
lol
kick is no good
lfg special teams
classic browns
shankapottamus
god fucking knew with that kick
hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
letssss gooooo
lol browns
as cody parkey should
that worked out well
lmaooo all that for nothing
lmfao
ha guess they should have gone for it
there we go
go get this lead
lol
win or go home boys
parkey malarkey
alright who waved their hands to the left when he kicked
is fort playing havent seen or heard his name yet
that left upright just got mossed

cmon man
why do we never run delayed screens it feels like
personal foul make cleveland shank a kick defense no 99 15 yard penalty first down cleveland
oh shit
karma curved that ball
our o line sucks rn
ran into our own players smdh
well that was nothing
what the flag jesus
how is there never any open receivers
why arent we running
ol needs big investment this offseason
holy fuck
this was a hell of an ugly drive
embarrassing response
lol 2020 ravens offense in a nutshell
please for the love of god just keep running the ball
fake it
why didnt we run on first two downs smh
we didnt even been on the field for 1 min

good lord
fuck greg roman run the ball you pussy
what a waste of a possession
wow just wow
big ole fuck you to the refs
run the ball
i want penei sewell sooo bad it physically hurts lol
never understood running 2 yard routes
if lamar just looked to his left he was gone on 2nd down he chose the wrong gap
i just got back from grabbing some late night grub what have i missed
lets totally abandon the run wth
we currently have negative passing yards that is embarrassing
shocking
bruh
refs always been assholes even to marion motley
lamar needs to change his cleats hes the only one slipping
all pro marlo
marlon is a beast
someone tweet roger he needs to make some calls to put the laundry away
atta boy marlo
baker sucks but if u keep giving him chances to score he eventually will
let go defense
baker probably could have gotten it by running
whos gonna have the better game throwing lamar or baker
ooooh that was a lucky bounce
come on lamar
andrews has been non existent so far

now our predictable offense is gonna open with a basic run play bc the 3 passes didnt work
lets go boys take all my energy
which team is the underdog here

edit this isnt sarcastic im wondering who is supposed to win
proche went full dark helmet
just tuning in have the ravens looked decent or are they hanging in there any injuries
if i have to hear that damn att commercial again im gonna end it all
hey a run
thats what i like
thats a first down
10 yards lets go 27
this is why romans gotta go he runs it only when he sucks ass at everything else
wow running the ball worked
gussss
hey look what happens when u hand it off to jk
really giving more air time to myles garret over bozeman
keep feeding jk
check out what happens when we run
let dobby cook
need to reinvest in the ol
nice drive nice drive
running the ball on 1st is our bread and butter no reason to do anything other than that until they stop it
we need to feed dobbins
thats what i like to see
another slip during that run
no one is ever open
does lamar have a completed pass yet
good protection there
really good blocking on that play
seriously run it every down
thank god were running the ball
draft all o line fa all wrs tes
lets fucking go lets get him hot
our receivers are sad
dobbins
jkk
keep running dobbins
attaboy jk
keep feeding jk damn it
feed my man jk
if it aint broke
jk is easily the best back on the team
bro holy shit jk
amazing what happens when your run the god damn ball
bulldozed that over the line feed jk
see jk run run jk run
jk is literally ray rice 20
dobbins on a run greg ro ready to pull him out
yes more running lets go dobby
gahhh damn jk dobbins

and oline
dobbins must be coated in butter
dobbins is a fucking star
i swear to god if we stop feeding dobbins
dobbins is so fucking amazing
free him forever
wanna see mandrews get more involved
free dobbins
oh
every passing play crowded and congested routes get this clown tf out
10yd runok youre out jk
jk is younger than me but hes my dad
wtf is this turf and why arent the browns slipping
browns mustve had the carpet cleaned or something
someone is in bdubs subtlety wetting the field before all our drives
hate to see anyone get injured but that definitely helps us sooooo
hit the not so funny bone
good catchhh
damn garret only has 10 sacks impressive but i remember early season people saying he might break the record
need for snead
snead my boy
snead iv
alright they gotta do something about this field soon
im really liking the playcalling on this drive rn
wtf with our cleats
feed jk please
need for snead
hes s o good
run them over
keep running it
andrews time maybe
vintage jackson
lamar
where is mark andrews
dammit
ravens need to get progressive to play on this field
why is our offense lining up with 5 seconds left on the play clock every damn play
gus bus rolling baby
gus bussssss
touchdown baby lets fucking goooooooooooooo
feed the run game the ball
touchdown
fuck yea
lets goooooooooo
gus the mfff busss
like something has to be done about the passing game yeah were great at running the ball but there cant be a single person in our fo besides roman who thinks thats acceptable
gus bus
yesss gus
t d
td baby lets go boys
who needs passing yards not us
that was a td lol
the wheels on the bus go fucking round and round
wooooooooooooo
gotta love when the timeout comes so late we already show our play lol

next step of lamars development is not losing track of the clock and preventing the illegal procedure calls
gus bus edwards
hell yeah bus beep beep motherfucker
dont throw the ball again run it down their throats
honk honk
glad they gave it
these boys came ready to play
how do i get on the fan cam
outside of that one drive i like how were moving the ball against their defense
beast dive
feed the hogs
smart play
no need to pass if you dont need to haters gonna hate on it but who cares
the fact that they almost got that pass is shameful
sometimes i wish we just played man only we play so much better man to man
a little behind yall but hump definitely shouldve had a pick there
wtf was elliot doing
damn it
lmao
god dammit
how tf does that happen
i walked in the door from work after watching penalty fest 2020 on the way home and the first thing i see is a 30 yard pass play from baker shitheel nice
wheres jimmy smit again
soft
need new safeties
honestly there are a lot of holes on this team that are being hidden when stars like jackson andrews and humphrey are making game shifting plays
now that the game is tied again i feel pretty confident that our next drive will have more passes than runs and result in no points because thats the roman special
did yall know you can brush and floss at the same time
elliott didnt start breaking on chubb until chubb was like 510 yards past the los thats fucking unacceptable
run the damn ball idiots
this team has so many holes damn ol wr s olb when judon and or yannick leave
omfg
jesus fucking christ idk what to say
lmao
shoot
wtf are you doing lamar
yep cause when we need to respond we do that shit
change da cleats llama
lets score here and score out of the half cmon
why we not running the ball worked so well
wtf is going on with lamars shoes
get him some goddamn golf spikes
why are we passing
thats depressing
why did he not
soft as fuck
why tf did they run that
whats our pass yardage again
as he should be
i dont fucking understand this team seriously
same result everytime we start our drive with a pass
we did we run on 2nd and long show some damn aggression man
its the like the offense and defense alternate being good they just cant seem to get it together back to back

roman is justsigh
tyre phillips is getting destroyed on the right side
who runs on second and third and long
i the that justice hill gets 3rd downs and hate more that roman gives up on even trying
pick 6 coming
tyre phillips is getting worked over were really missing stanley and yanda this season
more sacks than pass attempts i dont even know what to say roman needs to go
i dont think weve passed 5 times in this game yet we scored 14 points already thank god we have greg roman
why the zone
lets see what outlandish bullshit happens now to fuck us over
do we not have enough money invested in the defense to play man and win zone is so pussy
we need to stop them here
d please save us

youre our only hope
please find jimmy smith lol hes better than peters
he couldve dived for the pick
we need a ff returned for td lets go d
bowser almost had that
team cant sack
lets goooooo
elliot and judon are the only players on defense that know how to tackle apparently
how can he slip when its such a wellmanicured field s
finally get pressure and we still let them complete a fucking pass
how does yannick fuck that up he had him point blank how do our rushers always wiff yannick looked fine in minnesota
no fucking replay
make the goddamn tackle
i love good defensive plays
stop them here and we will score i guarantee it
finally
good
grounding baby
there we go
feels like even when our pass rush gets there we whiff so much this season just blow by the qb from the simplest juke
wow ravens have a chance at some points here stupid play by mayfield just take the hit
we r making baker look like prime ben shrugging guys off smh
dials 1800bravens

hey greg roman please yeah can you run the damn ball thanks bye
weve been getting a lot of pressure more recently but damn their o line was giving baker a lot of time and clean pockets

what i would love to see us have that
basically no crowd noise and this high espn production clips between plays is so jarring
run the ball i dont even care that theres a minute left
ayyyy new shoes
why didnt they fucking change his cleats
man there is time to run wtf
roman i swear dont you fucking choke you hack
gotta change from spikes to cleats cause this field

gus us more agile than i give him credit for
yannick get that sack
i dont want to see chub get anything baker works best when he has play action
lets go defense
good play by williams
we still cant win any 1 on 1 pass rushing matchups
damn that was a nice catch by the browns
we have to keep him in the pocket man
browns have been getting clutch catches all night
i truly havent seen chuck make a play in the passing game lately
thats was fucking tough
hold them to a fg here please defense offense balling help them out
thats what happens when you play 10 yards off
i hate that marcus peters always gives so much room too many easy short catches
even the shitty espn guy called that one
we cant stop anything
pathetic
nice fucking catch
fine respond back
damn it we cant let them back into this
all this money being spent on defense and they consistently shit the bed against good offenses
what is defense
lets just burn some clock and get a score well be fine
trash
lol parkey

jt be putting curses on opposing kickers i swear
defense cant do shit
our defense man
they didnt re sod the fields get your shit together baker
you gotta belee in mj
lets stop throwing the house its not working and baker still has time got to start playing smarter defence
as bad as the big pass to hunt was i just really hated the play before it where we had one of our 1st team all pro dbs play 15 yards off a freaking running back to set up a 3rd and 1 where the browns can feel comfortable taking a shot
where is ray rice
we might need to put up 40ish
how is my stream a whole 3 minutes behind
boykin
big boi boykin
they run okay was doomed from the start
why can nobody get open
clutch throw
lets go

ol let taylor get too much penetration that wasnt on tucker that looks like a standard xp kick
hod we score
mayfield turning into commercial mayfield who he really is fck that guy
tyus needs to name his son tyus so we get a bowser jr
lord taylor is huge
missed extra point and the block even out
omg

tyus got them odell gloves lol
defense gonna have to keep it up
damn tuck just blasted that into the end zone
extend bowser baby
i didnt see did myles garrett get back in the game
is it wrong that im jamming to this
while we stunt on these hoes funky ass music

lol landry ran 15 yards to get a gain of 4
gotta keep those hands down
bruh
bruh that was dumb as hell
okay so tyus bowser doesnt have the most ints for the ravens but he is in fact tied with marcus peters at 3
come on d
good stop again there d

edit never mind
stop them here score td and game over
yessir
damn elliot come on man
cmon elliott wtf
lets all breathe a sigh of relief that harris didnt clothesline baker and get a flag
joker come on
come on d
cmon boys 3rd down
these 4th and bitches
elliot bro
how is it possible to miss tackles on a qb that often
elliot man gotta make that tackle coming off the blitz but it did slow him up
this d cant be trusted
come on
great job by harris to just go there
plssss dont score on this drive
that was a really good defensive play with a bad move from cleveland
they couldnt sack baker
oft
and we win by a lot
we are ass on 4th down this year
nvm
damn way too easy
says something about you defense when the browns keep going for it on 4th down
that was awful
hunh
stupid
thats such bullshit even more that we had four extra fucking players on the field
this trash ass defense gave up two third downs and a fourth down to baker mayfield
i mean if they were going to let us have 15 on the field
when did peyton manning start a steak company
how do we continually put so many resources into our d and they still have no backbone
lamar better be ok
zebras have extra eyes on us lol
im guessing lamar is changing cleats again
have you always been about to challenge for a no called penalty or is that a new thing can you challenge for a holding that didnt get called or hands to the face
fuck
commercials killed rock music
higgins soft as hell
2nd time that shits almost happened
33 man hes not that bad
its okay calais lol
defense just one stop just one stop please
big stop now yall

defense is atrocious
zreibec as browns make this a onescore game ravens announce that qb lamar jackson is questionable to return with cramps
fucking come on
pathetic d play and bullshit calls we could very easily still lose this game lol fucking ridiculous

ruh roh lol
why is he that open
man we have been snakebitten this year by injuries covid and weakness exploiting
jesus fuck please
we cant tackle
here we go again
way to go guys keep carrying them over the 1st down line
no tavon young no jimmy smithpeters not healthyno earl thomas

i never would have thought the secondary would be a liability in july
this season is sickening honestly
fuck man we need a negative play
always a first down after 2 plays wtf
lol
we have no cb depth these guys are practically off the street i guess
the same play to the same guy every fucking time
fucking slit my throat please holy fucking shit just fucking kill me
what is going on man
33 getting picked on
jesus christ please
harris needs to just get off the field
lmao we all know whats coming im just numb at this point
you have got to be fucking kidding what are we watching
baker will throw an int here watch
those are throws we dont make and catch
give this mother fucking harris some help and can we actually see some pass rush
1 score puts us behind with a backup qb in nice
cooland we are gonna let them score fuck 2020
getting fucked by a chubb awesome
elliot playing soft af not the only person but im going to die on this hill
madibuke only guy stepping up
they are eating us up
just tank at this point for fucks sake
we need to get rid of brown choose him over aj brown and do metkalf wtf yo
3rd and goal
hold to field goal lets go

red red wine stay close to me
dont let me be alone
its tearing apart my blue heart
brown can go suck it if we lose ffs
how do we let mayfields slow ass score how
pathetic
jesus man
wow just fucking wow
omg this defense is terrible
is lamar back
unreal
soft soft soft
this cant be real right now
my wholesome award was about to run out so take it for this thread
defense needs to wake the fuck up now or this game is over
this team does not want to work for anything they expect to go in and win and are surprised when the other team actually plays
this team is just so frustrating im numb to it i just assume we will go nowhere this year snake bit doesnt even begin to describe the multitude of things that keep going wrong for us at all the worst times hollywood cant catch and defense is soft in the 4th quarter what else is new
throw it on a dime
we need a field goal time to show the fuck up
please
half a quarter in a one score game and some of you jokers are saying the game is over shit thats just football
omg
bruh please say sik
we are done cooked
uh oh
hate my life
man not like this
welp
running qb with the crampsyikes
were fucked
why are we throwing on 1st down
whats up with lamar
fucking throwing with mcsorley lmao what a fucking joke
theyre fired up were playing like shit i just hope if we lose that well fix some shit this is just like steelers christmas day just like the bengals 4th and 12
lol of course now we completely abandon the run
sad
lets go mcsorley
mcsorely miracle
lol greg you useless bastard nice calls
why arent we running it with our backup qb and six minutes
omg

noooo not 7
why are we throwing
run the ball yo
pain
let gus run the ball holy shiittttttt is it that complicated im a high
see all you guys demanding we run run run you cant do that for 4 whole quarters even the worst d will stop the run after 3 qtrs
were down by one god damn point run the ball
what was that playcall
nonono guys when i said run the ball because trace is on the field i meant run it a different way
defense is fucking pathetic peters and queen dogshit all year and marlon not too hot either besides his fumbles we need some real players
why is brown still on the field
there we go
why have we ran the orbit motion when we havent done anything with it all year
well theres our fucking season
if ravens and browns both end up 106 then what happen
welp brutal game again fuck man
good shit willie way to hold on
great fucking job roman we have to throw the ball quit running the clock and making a backup throw on 3rd down you absolute donut he needs confidence or we will lose
i love snead
chuckles
im in danger
what a catch
sigh
mcsorley doing his job on third downs at least
buddy threw it on a dime eh
lets go boys stay positive
thank fucking god
i cant believe this shit
why is mcsorley in missed a bunch of the game
toilet mcswirley is suckin right now
snead has the best hands on the team
throw it on a dime
holy shit mcsorely yes
offense should never be expected to score more than 34 defense has had some questionable games
please lamar please get the fuck out there
that was fucking huge
now is not the time to fuck up
give snead a got damn max contract
jesus
snead and andrews are the only souljas on this team
holy fuck bozeman
great play call to hit snead
now run the fucking ball pls
gj bose
our ball lets fucking push it
we dont win this without a turnover
that whats up
snead is the best fucking receiver in the league
4 mins to go
did they really just try and say trace is better than lamar
time for dobbins to carry it
the real reason bozeman is our man of the year nominee
at least a fg please
run the fucking rock
run the clock down
hot damn receivers can catch
my wr1
runn rum run
holy fuck that was close
keep running
offense needs to slow down a bit
the absolute only way they win this game is if they run out the clock on a field goal
just fucking pound
lfg boys
psh that was an intentional groundlateral dobbins out here playing 7d chess for three extra yards
my heart
run run run
lets go lets go just like this
great play calls on this drive
huuuuge 3rd down please
run the ball please greg dont stop
guys im scared
well were running it finally
get a field goal and with little time left hope the browns cant score again
god damn now ive got nervous cramps
they are damn lucky lamars not out there
mcsorley looks confident out there
only shot is to run the clock down and get the fg
fg and shit ton of time off
as horrible as this 4th quarter is they have a chance to redeem themselves on the leg of tucker
great fucking run gus
please jesus please the browns need to lose
picardbb no we need you pls dont be injured
throw it on a dime
yeah fuck this
what the fuck kinda play call was that
mcsorley completes 1 pass which he was bailed out and riddick is psyched outta his mind about his accuracy lmao

hollywood should have fell down inside the 5 at least
pls def 1 stop thats it
defense please
holy fucking shit
this game is ridiculous lmao
yall killing me man lol my word
defense just needs to hold on
dez bryant funny af
a lot of time they have 3 timeouts and our defense
on the plus side the 1 play he makes a gane is usually a wide open td
i was holding my breath while the ball was in the air i couldnt take another lee evans moment
this defense absolutely has to make a stand theyve given it up way too often in situations like these
this is like easter and our saviour has risen
defense plz
i bet lamar still got that postcovid symptoms been there they suck
now we need a stop
omg we have to rely on defense to stop the browns

look at this score no defense
mvp
jesus defense already
of course
now back to that soft d
game of the year
oh dear
mvp
imagine if marquise brown had dropped that td pass
im a titans fan but what the fuck im rooting for u now that was incredible
goddamn guys you have to get a stop fuck
mvp
jesus come on defense we need a play make it happen
browns gonna go for the td and 2pointer to win

sadly i have zero faith in this defense lol
this defense reeks
33 is getting cooked
just throwing at 33 every play lmao
get 33 some help
manifesting a pick
wishful thinking
secondary is the goat of this game win or lose
oh right i got excited for a minute and forgot our defense is a joke
another injury
big truss lets fucking go
going to need a tipped ball my confidence is zero
theyre just targeting 33
33 is gonna blow this
same koch about to come in at cb
the d cant lose this
can this defense please finally step up
defense isnt getting pressure so this is exactly what we should expect
ugh wheres averrett
here we go with the terrible clock management
worst comes to worst ot but it wont happen
please defense we need you right here
cut harris hes been exposed all night
i thought this harris guy was good
come on defense
games not over plenty of ways to lose
need a to i dont think we stop them without a to
fuck these circus catches are killing us tonight if lady fortune could help us out at all thatd be great
he is not out of bounds bro what the fuck run the fuckin clock
can our d stop sucking ass for 1 drive dude
what is this defense
we r going to let them march right in arent we
d hasnt stopped a single play in a quarter and half
i cant watch

bakers a monster
i hate this defense
might as well have no defense
and even humphrey had a bad play in coverage
wack ass defense
offense struggles to get back in this and the d lets the browns run down the field
absolutely pathetic defense
welp good thing we have the best kicker in history
actually pathetic
worst defense ever
this gonna be a td isnt it
fuck
when the fuck will coaches learn to not play fucking prevent defense
they can tie it up or they can go for two but i just trust jackson to get us to at least where tucker can kick it
fire wink
still hate elliot
pls miss the pat
fucking soft cheese bullshit
we gotta go down the line and get a fg
im so done with this fucking defense holy shit we are bad
watch them go for two and ducking get it
i feel its gonna be a fake fg attempt
somehow miss ols
browns didnt even need a fucking to terrible defense
i have no emotions left
lets drive for a game winning fg here
so why did we waste a timeout

clutch scorigami at the end right there
football bingo
lets fucking go
what a fucking game
lets gooooooooooo
woooooooooo
now its over
how am i ever gonna sleep now
woo lost some yrs on this 1
this is a fever dream
and the ravens cover
what a good fucking game gg browns
wooooooooooooooo
wow just wow
yo idk is this has been said but damn just realized the browns have had 15 different starting quarterbacks since colt mccoy was a brown lol
all martindale does is blitz like a retard even tho it never works
were losing winks defense has been figured out for weeks now the steelers just fucking suck on offense

feels like if we dont score here the game already over i know im overreacting but this game feels over
lol that hunt catch was oob

wow peters once again blows the big play
marcus peters is so shjtty he gets beat for 10 catches a game then once every 4 or 5 games he gets a pick and acts like hes a beast smh
3534
game is effectively over fucking lucky shitstains
629 and no hope gtfo fake ass fans
yall can blame hollywood brown but this defense is garbage blame the wide receiver how can wide receiver get in a groove when you dont pass
shit tackling already
classic marcus peters giving 5 yards of separation dude sucks on coverage
we got this chill yall
i think thats called back tbh
fire the equipment manager
we winning and im loving it but we arent winning anything in the stat book our offense has been hit and miss quite literally its not good long term try it against the chiefs you guys know what i mean
defense is mad overrated
peters really needs to make something happen cuz hes looking rough
hope we draft a safety sometime soon pretty clear clark and elliott arent the answer
i love keanu but man he isnt a good actor
were gonna lose
lamar gonna throw an incompletion i guarantee it
we just cant ever catch a damn break
smfh franchise qbs make that throw
worst screen defending team ever since that kc game
peters has to make a play on that ball
there was our chance
secondary is full of
lmfao can we get a stop
what a pathetic start by the defense
their offensive gameplan is clear our d can adjust
lol d is fucking sleep
nick chubb scares me
theoretically our defense is better than theres so we should just march right down the field here
did we just drive a few hundred miles after leaving our australian shepherd at a road stop without noticing


yup
i have never seen a team slip so much as these ravens the last 3 games
jk dobbins guaranteed 5 yards lets go with a flea flicker
that was a bad pi brown is so lost
does anybody know who this new tight end is his name is eric tomlinson but ive never seen him before
that looked incidental to me
this sub cracks me up lol

were up fuck yea lets goooooo

were down we are ass
i hate judon but thats a shit call
this team is shooting itself in the foot

jimmy smith was there why even hook the guy you knew the fucking route
the officiating is bad both ways this ref vitovich sp is always terrible
yo can yall slow down i cant upvote browns flame as fast as its coming in
lamars quarterback skills are getting progressively worse
we meant to eff you guys again but you did it yourself
lamar had an open crossing route underneath for a solid 7 to make it 4th and 3 instead he eats the sack

this shit is bad coaching and gregt roman consistently wastes a down trying a dumb fucking play to keep them on their toes

we seriously do not deserve playoffs i dont even want to fucking hear about it we need better coaches and better depth and role players
lamars gotta get better at sliding dont like him going down like that
why arent the browns slipping
wow a browns player injured wouldnt wish injury on anyone unlike some fans in the other thread wishing for lamar to be injured
trash field

x200b

hope garrett is ok on some real shit
secondary gone second
clark and elliott both looking iffy
fuck this field
this fucking field
yall might be mad but running the ball was probably the right call good time management on a play that was doomed from the start
were lucky cleveland is a poorly coached team
brown drops two passes smh
the offense is straight cancer
fucking trade hollywood jesus christ what a useless piece of shit
that drive was a rollercoaster but a touchdown is a touchdown
petition i dont think we should refer to him as hollywood he hasnt earned it
wait how come we dont have the social justice slogans on the back of our helmets
clark rofl idiot
baker low key has a cannon
i really feel like our practice squad rejuvenated this team got healthy at the right time and exposed the fraud steelers
bad throw
this announcer is roasting brown lol
one more td and hays in barn i called the td to end the end half and then called us scoring on in the first drive give me mad up upvotes
ffs can the defense make a stop i want a blowout
harbs making up for that indy challenge
man i feel so bad for kickers this year lol what the fuck is going on
harbaugh should have challenged that catch
we need a bigger wr to make that play
fuck
ew
ughhh
dammit lamar
fuuuuuuuuck so close
ahhhh throws are off shit
lamar come on man

maaaannnn could you imagine lamar throwing to an elite receiver this offense would look incredible
we need those lamar but were good defense needs to step up
lamar has been overthrowing all god damn year man
lamar slowly getting his accuracy back

it was horrendous last week but not terrible tonight
fuck me
oh fuck me
baker manziel
lucky no call humph plays physical but he does get away with some shit
another third down failure jesus christ
jarvis landry is a cunt lord
after kc burnt peters hes been sagging off like crazy
theyll challenge a 5 yard penalty but we cant challenge a 30 yard catch cmon man
what
probably isnt even hurt just had to pretend he is so he wont be shit on for giving up completely on the play
harbaugh straight getting outcoached
were fucked
if lamar doesnt come back we dont deserve to win lmao what the hell cramps bro
a baby have been borned and became old enough to vote and serve in the military in the time it took the browns to make another playoffs appearance
koch came to play
elliott brown and peters should stop playing football
peters and smith are questionable to return
this defense is so bad lmao
i want to die
harris is fucking trash and im sick of jimmy smith always having nagging injuries the guy cant play a fucking game
this guy really playing over averette
just picking on 33
just let them score at this point this is pathetic
lets go defense
i guess lamar is the one leading the browns to the super bowl
this is where i turn it off id rather wake up to a surprise win than watch them fold
wheres the ruthless aggression wheres the killer instinct someone get ray in the locker room
this is the team you get when you only draft fast runners you get a qb with a floppy arm and wrs who have no hands

but they sure can run fast
i actually thought we could win i forgot about our sorry ass defense
honestly if im bischotti i tell harbaugh to lose the bum ass coordinators and make a deep run next year or youre gone
take your fucking time lamar
i hope lamar clogs their toilet
game over
when you think things cant get dumber
serious what do you think happened to lamar was he injured during a play

x200b

edit nevermind
put hollywood at qb
soljia do what soljias do
harris has to go
why is jimmy smith not in over 33
44 quit on that play
they are gonna convert the 2 point when they inevitably score
hollywood shouldve went down on goal line
cut the whole defense start over
so if we win this then can we put to rest those lamar isnt clutch comments
imagine if this field wasnt dog shit
the goat
take that romo
fuck lebron fuck the brownsall the luck and still couldnt win
running the ball on 2nd and 21 and 3rd and 19 is some losing ass pathetic football and tells you all you need to know about the what the coaching staffs feeling on lamar and honestly i agree with them
coaching needs to fucking bench themselves fucking garbage
lamar is still learning we never throw deep balls like that and yall were complaining
i hate being alive fucking kill the shit out of me right fucking now
this aint a playoff team
removed
im going to get downvoted for this but if lamar doesnt improve his accuracy then hes not a franchise qb
im not saying we are gonna lose but if we do harbaugh needs to be on the hot seat it would prove that we really cant win when it matters
zero pressure another embarrassing third down failure god this defense
damn i feel for hollywood

i was called out last game for saying we should shop peters for a bad take and being an idiot i know im right that he is a liability
dont tell me our play offs hopes are gonna get crushed by fucking trace mcsorley
elliott is cheeks
we all knew this team were bums
marcus peters is honestly trash
peters is just bad
toilet mcswirley just tore his acl
lamar proving he cant throw again

why do we keep protecting harbaugh weve blown ao many games under himhell we almost blew the super bowl
i hate to say it but this game would have been killshotted if lamar had made any one of those two dogshit passes he threw last drive

i dont care who you are mvp qb or not coaches need to lay into you if you cant hit open people in stride from a completely clean pocket college qbs can do that this is the stuff the haters can point to rightfully
im sorry but lamar leaving for cramps in a game that practically decides our season might be the softest thing ive ever seen
defense is so shit
jesus christ that was sad didnt even put up a fight
this is lookin like a slaughter
1 pass this is what worries me
this team is disgusting
deep breathes lamar you got this if theres anyone
its you
hey ravens great series way to answer the call
finally we see lamar get frustrated play with that chip
is yalls oline really that bad at pass blocking or does lamar do too much
lmao how do you miss that pi good break on that at least
these fucking guys are trying so hard to get these free plays with the 12 men on the field penalty fucking dirty noskill way to keep the ball fuck the browns
oh shit lamar got cramps
yeah thats season over
eagles fan checking in how much would it take to trade for brown
this defense is a group of soft bitches straight up
seasons done

blame of the season covid19
the difference is lamar doesnt throw the ball at the wall because hes humble
incoming trace mcsorley big dick game winning drive to win the game in cleveland fuck you browns
why the fuck is lamar hiding in the locker room
lemickey

yannick was a waste i dont think we re sign him there is a reason the vikings lets him go just like that
peters is fucking worthless
peters is absolute shit all season has been dog shit get him off the field
fire wink all this talent for him to
just shit it away
please get chuck clark out of the game

lamar soft af idc about some cramps this game has playoff implications
removed
is chuck clark literally an idiot im sorry but only this team would knock its own starter out against a goal post man cmon
we still acting like none of this shit is on lamar dudes looked off again so far
this game highlights the difference between talented players with awful coordinators and decent players with amazing coordinators
yes id rather have every cleveland coach over every ravens coach
the fact that harbaugh did not tell lamar to suck it up after the first trace drive with the season on the line is a fucking fireable offense and you cant change my mind

fuck every fan that said have faith youre fake were the real fans that pointed out how bad romans offense was all year we pointed out how winks blitzing gets abused all year but were fake fans cause we are smart enough to realize how weak this team is
oh no are the ravens gonna get memed by the browns
ngl travolta makes a great santa
as a steelers fan should i root for you guys so we have a better shot at the division or the browns so your playoff chances lessen i think im leaning to root for you all
finally an injured player that isnt a raven
guys the refs made them wear those shors
omg

that sideline judge was calling run the clock and turned to the browns sideline and then changed to stop the clock
15 people on the field is a fucking embarrassment when we get bounced in the first round and we will we need a coaching staff who will hold players accountable
all you negative nancys stop

we are still winning and can win
queen sucks
why was marlo paid again
lamar looking like a rb lately
this is one the sloppiest ravens teams ive ever seen
pretty sad to see how toxic our fan base has become
snead you gotta run through the ball man


saw the replay i thought snead slowed up at first bad pass

harbaugh out fraud exposed
great start defense
trash defense
fruit punch
hot knife through butter
owning chubb in fantasy while being a ravens fan summed up
does anyone know if ingram still gets snaps i have him on my fantasy and i need literally like 5 points to take a lead
never mind
just remember ohio is one of the worst places for covid right now a lot of fans in that stadium are giving up their health to watch this game browns will still brown
horrible fucking throw
this trash ass field everyone slipping
ah judon is back this week
woah a whole play without a browns penalty
no
shows you how shitty our defense is that theyre going for it on 4th4
he did hook him hard enough for him to fall i dont think that was a bad call honestly
that was pass interference the shit about it is jimmy didnt even need to touch the guy he wouldve had a pick if he just broke on the ball smdh
lmfaooooo
if we pass on first down im going to flip
ugh why give edwards the ball
checks out
yea its his shoes ok
thats game
chuck clark in coverage has become a liability
snead needs to catch that thats a pretty good ball
i dont want to see anyone calling that a bad pass

if that was a actual big wr thats a td
ugh bad
he missed that
lamar with the middle school misses
i dont like it i dont like it this is how we always choke one side is stifled followed by the other side shitting the bed
wtf smh
marlo gonna force a fumble i feel it comin
peters is such a fucking bitch
harris looks clueless out there
lamar is just going to bed this game is in the bag lol
et picks thay

lol wow
well thats game
that song aint so funny now lol
why is he throwing the ball
fuck brown you punk bum ass mf
what was that play calling give it to the rbs
baker is embarrassing
god damn it harris youre killing the team
pls hold to 3
gold to 3
gg boys and girls
this game is over
i dont known why i am surprised
this team has done the same thing every game all year we got no talent a wr lamar lobs everything we never addressed our run defense and our o line has been sketchy all season
its hard to blame this on the defense when our offense has had 2 3 and outs the last couple drives just poor game management and missed opportunities galore
gg

1020pm what a waste of time this game was
you need to remember were playing the browns a team who history fucks anything up that goes their way relax
5head play fumble for more yards
wheres lamar
sam koch time
let tucker kick it from 70 at this point
not drinking makes it easier to not care as much about football
62 yard fg from here
too bad theres too much time left in the game what a great play by lamar
i told yall win it on this play and he did
ill give baker credit he looks pretty good rn
defense is gonna choke this
miss it you pleb
yall trash asses lost and got saved
think if lamar were clutch too
lmao
marcus peters is not good and deshon elliot over top is a terrible combination
these greg roman comments are exhausting his running scheme is the only reason were in this game

maybe throw some fucking passes now lamar
harbaugh is incompetent in challenges
we say the wideouts are never open they were wide open thats a game losing miss goddammit
time to blow it up this team has too many holes and as great as lamar is at making plays he cant throw anymore we need wholesale changes
removed

deshon has been a disappointmentlove the guy but this experiment should be over with at the end of the season
we blow games all the time and never catch upsomeone tell me why we shouldnt move on from harbaugh
game over
lamar really is a runningback lol
ravens fans just bitch and bitch and bitch about refs its ruined this season for me stop it nobody is out to get us
another dude running off late this is harbaughs last year hes out of touch hes not an xos coach so you have to wonder what the fuck hes actually doing if hes not trying to figure out the technical issues with this team fucking embarrassment
removed


harbaugh needs to be gone he cant get professional football players to tackle or hustle this is a mockery of our legacy
pathetic defense
yall refused to accept our issues this year
nice catch
ravens offense can only play one way the moment you gotta change its not happening
we in the the playoffs boys good win too fucking ezz


lamar doing lamar shit win lamar trying to be qb losr
devantae harris fucking sucks lol
pathetic defense commit the penalty and cant even get the stop with it
obj
baltipmore i apologise that was definitely a reach
this team is just a bunch of chumps again no heart or grit we need some real players with it
mcsorey fuckinf sucks
plz dont let lamar in this game
ill say it again worst defense in the league its turnover or bust
i know we like to hate him on this sub but baker is legitimately pretty good
removed
does lamar just absolutely blow as a passer or is it me aside from running the option i hold my breath and pray that hes not mangled every play at this point id bet he doesnt make it 5 full seasons at this point
harbaugh is never going to win another super bowl
lamar choker
removed
ive said all year our defense is one of the worst and is inflated by faulty numbers we can bully lesser teams but this defense would even lose to a well coached college team
harris is trash fucking commits a penalty every time
tired of watching this team choke again and again
ive been saying it all year elliot is a fucking idiot and should not be relied on
removed
baker mayfield is a top 3 qb for the future not today dont me
lamar cramping must be his vag hurting
our d is horrible outside of 44 they can all kick rocks
clark needed a new challenge so he tried to tackle the post dont believe any other narratives
let me guess another edwards goal line carry why do they hate dobbins

haha reverse jinxed it
visitor here but how long do cramps last
hope browns fans are happy with the woman beater on their team classy organization
wink martindale is so bad
removed
removed
its so tiring hearing ravens fans bitch about roman its in our dna to hate ocs
hey make like the raiders and fire your defensive coordinator
damn baker is cooking this game that was a beautiful pass receiver should have caught it before the lucky catch by the 2nd guy
were all still better people than any browns fans
greetings from browns

someone tell lamar to take his roller skates off this is a football game
can we just cut peters dude cant tackle he constantly plays 8 yards off the receiver hasnt had an interception since like week 2 honestly he is not worth that extension we gave him

edit lol yall downvoted me but look at that fucking play
we suck
team needs a clear out in the fo harbs gotta be on hot seat if we lose this
whole coaching staff needs to be fired and we need a new qb that is the reality

removed

we need a new hc oc and qb this shit is embarrassing downvote me idgaf you gotta be delusional to think this shit is going to get any better with 3 weeks left
heres where they tie it
honestly i dont want to see the listed players back next year peters brown queen boykin ingram skura roman
why does it matter no way this team and specifically qb can keep up with mahomes
honestly feels like a loss really hope im wrong

but but but the refs hate us
removed
hahahahahah
calais is starting to look like a big waste of money that dude collects a big check to sit out a lot

edit read the update wrong still have ptsd from the titans i take it back calais
thats a quarterback
bruh wtf give dobbins a chance to score edwards is a fucking bum

bro get that weak shit outta here its game day
its definitely still possible if we lose tonight and end up 106 but we need good bit of help in that case

much better if we win tonight lets focus all our good vibes on that
how many of these posts do we need
yes hope miami colts and raiders lost more gsmes than us it looks like we only have tie break over the colts
removed
mosley funny thought he got traded

buddy i have to work in the morning
lamar stunts on hoes chug
removed
removed
i think hes been recognized and properly rated as soon as he went off a few weeks ago
removed
well marcus peters got the fuck grabbed out of his facemask but apparently that doesnt matter
its a good thing the first couple minutes dont determine the entire game
not a good start for sure

shit city shit fans shit field
knowing how desperate the browns are they probably made the field slippery on purpose to slow jackson down
the jerseys are literal shit brown
whoops that was lamar
looks like your equipment manager sucks but keep looking for excuses
ravens getting lucky chubb gonna run all yall over mark my words
removed
hollywood baited the pi call and got a holding so hes doing good
brown was pretty open and very underthrown
brown had a whole ass house call and lamar under threw him which made him slow up to draw that pi

howd that work out for them
karmas a bitch and hopefully it works its magic
yeah thats not okay i dont think many browns fans are cool with this kind of stuff

edit lol who downvoted me for saying its wrong to wish for injuries stay classy ravens fans
removed
complete bullshit he put his face mask right and bakers chest
who is this ref 52 is brutal
they didnt call it because baker was hit they were trying to say helmet to helmet which was bs
i thought this call was horrific then i saw the call on jimmy worse pi call i have ever seen
removed
removed
bro for real cant tackle baker or its a flag cant guard receivers or its a flag
lmfao for sure
why does this happen ever fucking week
whats worse is trying to listen to these announcers justify it

refs suck so far
tons of missed holding calls on several of the blitzes against mayfield their rt was getting away with it
removed
they want that browns narrative because these calls have been fucking bullshit
52 is a fucking idiot
nfl wants baker in the playoffs its completely blatant in the game already
jimmy smith did accidentally put hands on the receiver before the ball got there unfortunately cause really it shouldve been a pic
they are coddling them like newborns
hitting the qb is roughing the passer

whoever makes the animations on mnf needs a raise

illegal streams work better in my experience
crackstreams is 1010
try restarting your phone
get an apple iphone

clock only stops in obs within the last 4 minutes of each half
anytime a player in possession of the ball goes out of bounds the play clock stops according to the nfl rule book the clock is restarted once the officials spot the ball at the appropriate yard line on the field except during the last two minutes of the first half or the last five minutes of the fourth quarter
you want 20 seconds back that nothing happened in

lamars biggest opponent right now are his fucking shoes
refs in shambles rn

we triedbut the browns
fuck this officiating crew fucking bums
no joke
oh but dont you just love tuning into a game to watch your favorite ref make clutch plays
you know while the first half was an abomination they actually chilled out a lot in the second half
gotta say the refs came to play tonight they didnt make it ez thats for sure
if you crop the bottom of the picture lamar becomes about 8 feet tall
we bout to get 10 flags on this right

your sacrifice will not go in vain

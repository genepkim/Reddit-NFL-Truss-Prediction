i think you might be the only one thinking about the titans right now bud
i think you mean tyre phillips

lol even judon knows he didnt deserve it as much


im happy orlando brown made it hes filled for stanley extremely well much better than i anticipated which unfortunately means hell probably be gone once his contract runs up
who did campbell and judon pay to get in
as long as justin tucker is a pro bowler im good
some of those judon campbell are reputation nods but im hyped as fuck for our boy cox
how is board not in when he led all special teams players in votes
there is one imposter remaining
the ravens have a fb starting for each conference again we are a fb factory gash mcclain neal leach juice ricard
how does lamar not make it with 11th best qbr and 12 in rushing yards but judon does with 5 sacks smh our offence is 6th in ppg purely due to lamar
easy money
im shocked watson made it i knew allen and mahomes were locks i wouldve thought either lamar or baker would get the 3rd slot
judon made the probowl wtf
kinda feeling like bowser deserved it more then judon this year
judon wth
really surprised to see all the watson haters his team is terrible but hes been phenomenal since the tennessee game
jets gm salivating
glad tucker didnt get snubbed for some flavor of the week flash in the pan like sanders again already 2 pro bowls short of where he should be with the bospoorly and myers years
watson over lamar is criminal
queen got robbed

why the hell is judon here
honestly switch judon with andrews and im satisfied
last year
glad we dont lose a 6th rounder for 91 pb
im hella salty that lamar didnt get in but with everything that weve been threw we havent had a chance to shine like last year so it explains why at least
watson is great but hes getting all his stats while losing also his best wr was using peds so none of fullers tds or yards should count lamar was robbed

who is the afc punter got big shoes to fill replacing koch in the wolfpack
judon being quoted saying he was surprised he made the pro bowl is pretty much all of us rn
kinda shocked board didnt get in he lead everyone in voting on special teams
ayyyy

how the fuck did judon make it
i am so happy cox made it man deserves it for all his hard work
ill be perfectly honest kind of shocked that judon made it in wonder if its a down year for olbs in general
lol judon
nice upvoted
matt judon made the pro bowl lmfao hes gonna use that to try to get big money we better not pay him
lamar been whoopin teams asses lately
thats gonna cost some bad gm millions lol
how tf judon get in matthew judon
tyus bowser definitely deserves it much more but if that makes it us easier for us to affordably resign him then im cool with king koopa getting snubbed
lamar is so hated its unreal my friends were talking about top 5 qbs this week and i said lamar and they went off it was so funny
its surprising for sure but im super happy for him hes been a solid raven

judon will get over paid and well get a third for him resign bowser and yannick as our starters and draft a guy in the first 3 rounds


i appreciate you for trusting me

i hope harbaugh stays our coach for the next 20 years
harbaughs model for leadership is something i think we can all learn from

dobbins is going to be my next jersey for sure

i knew the pro bowl was a joke before but the fact that judon made it thusis year is absolutely hilarious dude is going to steal money wherever he goes please not us
hes alao been in the league a lot longer
rigged

ya but at the rate he kicks hell be around for another 20 years
wonder if hes being punished for noshowing sundays game
puntersarepeopletoo
i love sam koch all my homies love sam koch

hes great but didnt deserve it

kelce 98 catches 1318 yards 10 tds

waller 93 967 8

andrews 48 597 7
hes great but we dont have the passing style offense to push his stats to pro bowl numbers this year

personally i will always like him more than the kelce but he doesnt have pro bowl numbers
browns fan here to say hate playing against andrews and i think hes one of the top 5 in the league but having said that this year he just doesnt have numbers for it with the year kelsey and waller are having
waller is balling josh allen is balling deshaun has damn good states too neither lamar nor andrews were shafted especially considering when voting was done
covid really put a damper on his touches between them having to run a hybrid offense and then without lamar and then he was also out it stacks up
campbell made it lol hes hardly played pro bowl is a joke
hes not a top 2 tight end in the afc this year
still fun seeing all the wheels fall off their wagon though lol
they look like hot buttered garbage ben has been exposed
i feel the first game we beat ourselves and the second one covid beat us steelers just lucky

haha juju just got cracked
is there any playoff implications if bengals cause an upset tonight
boo boo just got blowed up
i got it
u love to see it dont ya
steelers win 11 straight when we want them to lose now that we need them to win theyre about to go on a 5 game losing bender fml
they arent looking good lol worst possible scenario since we need them to beat colts or browns
cant believe we couldnt even take one against these guys that covid outbreak screwed us hard
ben is fucking ass now
shhh any given sunday or monday tuesday wednesday thursday etc
somethings up with them i knew they wasnt 110 good but they just look bad
i thought the xfl went under

the only appropriate way to address the western pa mountain people lol

im pretty sure theyre not playing it this year anyway

little bitch got popped
absolutely he keeps that stupid dancing shit he can expect more of those hits
that made my night
poopoo smith schuster
170 bengals everybody get in here
thats what juju get for dancing on the bengals shield so disrespectful
steelers have looked like the most mediocre 11 win team ive ever seen to think this team was 110 lol bens looked mediocre and lets be honestif we took care of business in our first gamethey never go that long without an l

however if the bengals can hold on then that helps us a lot because then theyll be pressed to beat the colts next week because they wont want to go on a 3game losing streak
has juju fumbled the game away yet
love to see it

maybe if juju spent less time dancing and more time warming up he wouldnt have butterfingers every year
christmas has come early i love watching the steelers implode
we cant count on this team to beat the colts or browns going to need help from the raiders or bills
juju got lit tf up
fumblefumble smith whooster does more fumbling
take it to those pisscolored bitches ryan finley
the steelers might just lose out to try to make us miss the playoffs we need that dolphins loss
if the bengals lose buffalo will not be locked into a specific seed week 17
what do we need more steelers to win and right themselves for colts browns or lose and wake up in order to fight off the browns for the division
former raven josh bynes having a good game



safe to say the bengals were not happy with juju smithschuster doing tik toks on their logo cinvspit

its about goddamn time
can the steelers even beat the browns atp
unfortunately the steelers are trash now and may not win another game this season law of averages because they were absurdly lucky all season
it was beautiful lol
i have been hoping for this
looks like indy has a very good chance at beating them hope they pull out a vintage beat down against cleveland though
i still cant believe we lost to this sorry ass team i really hope we get in at 6 and the steelers are 3 a fully healthy ravens with lamar taking care of the ball will beat the brakes off pittsburgh
this is actually a best case scenario

steelers lose fuck em
bengals draft pick and odds of getting sewell gets worse
afc title now in jeopardy for steelers next week against colts
if both browns and colts win next week afc title still in jeopard against the browns week 17

basically it means they wont be resting players week 17 if we need a win from them
the steelers have a history of playing down to their competition and then lighting up a top tier team the next week

but also like guck them
big ben just looks s wrong out there that big body seems to be breaking down and his throws have no zip like peytons last year



down 100 to the bengals who have some no name in at qb just shocking
always root for the dolphins to lose or titans to lose twice

dont root for this sorry ass team unless we absolutely have to
what happens if the steelers lose tonight whats the ravens playoff scenario
better just root for oakland

though colts did get taken down to the wire against the texans so who the fuck knows whats going to happen next week ravens just need to not have a let down against the giants
i think that both of our fan bases can agree that the squealers are fakes propped up by a really good defense that carried them early and now that injuries have taken a toll on that defense that bad offense is really starting to show still think theyll win this game though
steelers really tryna tank their last 3 games to keep us outta the playoffswhat a bunch of assholes
with the steelers losing to the bengals that coltssteelers game becomes a winwin for the ravens steelers lose they still have to play their starters in an all out battle for the division in week 17 they win ravens move back into a playoff spot provided they beat the giants

also diontae johnson and chase claypool
fewer


sorry man
fuck the steelers
a lot of that simply has to do with the steelers offensive gameplan

dink and dunk for 3 to 5 yards a play which results in a lot of receptions with shorter yards per catch

that also allows for ben to preserve his body
that actually is a fun fact
i posted this same exact thing an hour after you and didnt even realize it my bad
if you account for volume jujus ypt this year is historically bad

i dont think thats happening because juju became terrible all of a sudden big ben their oc are limiting his game big time
lord stannis just had an aneurysm

nice fun fact though juju isnt bad and hes just having fun but there are certain things you dont do

your caption is questionable but i love this video
fucking refs blowing plays up early boils my blood
gettem bois

nah this might hurt our playoff stock but fuck this is hilarious
worst 110 team in history we tried to tell them lmao
i can love it tonight
steeler players are being dirty idiots today sadly cincy will blow this in the second half
nah this is good let them lose gives buffalo and them motivation to win out
a loss would open up the bills not resting their starters the final week as they could possibly get a higher seed thus giving the dolphins a loss to get us in
im loving it we dont need a steelers win tonight so i am all for them getting embarrassed
2 passing yards
maybe this is the embarrassment they need to play better over the next two weeks when the ravens actually need a win from them
this felt like a get right game for them and they are just floundering completely
i remember you was conflicted
elevenandoh
im just enjoying juju getting what he deserves
do we actually need them to beat one of these teams for a better seed or do we control our own fate by winning out because i honest to god cannot see them beating any of those teams the way ben is playing
cant we get in if miami loses so steelers can lose out and we still get in

the steeelers didnt beat us twice this season

the ravens beat themselves while playing the steelers
if lamar wasnt having a turnover party we run away with that game steelers have looked fraudulent all year not sure why these commentators are acting shocked
good news is he wants to play another year please do
they are so bad its not even funny
ben sucks
i hope the bengals keep this going
no refs beat us with the steelers help

lmao
i dont understand tiktok and i dont understand why this person made this video but i will tell you that both me and my three year old daughter absolutely loved this post albeit in pretty different ways
got his shit rocked

steelers fan here and id give you gold if i had it to give dont like his antics

corvette corvette
really surprised a team hasnt waited out there to bust his ass pregame yet
holy shit im dying
i never realized how many white girls who cant dance were out there until i briefly downloaded tiktok

deleted the app never looked back
fuck him and his silly name
usavevideo
honestly they are so shit if they lose tonight there is no way they beat the colts or the browns then we will have to rely on the raiders or bills to beat miami but the raiders are giant chokers and bills might have the 2 seed locked up by that point and rest players week 17 damn it really sucks we couldnt get one win against this scrub team
a steelers loss would open up the bills not resting their starters the final week as they could possibly get a higher seed thus giving the dolphins a loss to get us in
can yall stop being so doom and gloom and enjoy this train wreck my lord
ravens should have played previous games better cant blame other teams for our short comings
relax one week at a time this embarrassment might get the steelers playing harder when we need them to in the next two weeks
does anyone not realize if the steelers lose out then they simply flip with the browns

personally im eyeing up the dolphins or colts spot
we win that game without covid thats why this season has no matter what
i am both ha ha ha fuck the steelers and we got to play the bengals in week 17
the bengals dont look too good the steelers just look that bad
the bengals arent complete pushovers but the steelers are playing like bums we will beat either of them
we got to play the bengals in week 17

look at how bad ben is moving the ball
we fucked them up and down with their number one pick qb theres no reason we lose that game
big ben is washed

steelers suck

easiest schedule in the league
just another friendly reminder if you go into their sub and get reported by their mods back to us we will ban you and you can appeal to them this is an agreement between all the team subs
im loving this as much as every other ravens fan but we need them to win one of the next two weeks and this isnt making me confident
fuck steve saunders man we would have crushed this team with healthy starters and wouldnt need any help to get into the playoffs
ahahahhahaha
they have a rapist at qb
so conflicted rn between enjoying this embarrassment of a first half by the squealers still wanting them to show some sign of life so i can feel a bit of confidence that they can beat the colts or browns
we need them to stop sucking and starting fucking other teams playoff hopes for us to get in
how did we lose to this team

turnovers is one helluva drug and covid is one helluva disease thats why
this was posted in the steelers sub before they barely beat our practice squad seems appropriate to break it out now


ravens have gone from preseason darling and reigning mvp to a fractured flailing useless mess

their bulldozing offensive line has been neutered by injury their fearsome running game has none of its major pieces except the qb and that qb has now very clearly been figured out leaguewide with the blueprint naturally having been produced and showcased by the steelers and lacks the tools to overcome the challenges nfl defenses have learned to set for him and whats worse that was true when he still had supporting talent and protection in front of him which again he no longer does

their defense is still a relative strength which is cute for them when its not the second best defense in the game by a significant margin but alas

i dont see this team in its current incarnation as a true rival moving forward the gimmick offense has run its course and until theyre ready to blow up the gameplan the roster and the coaching staff beneath harbaugh theyll be contending for the 20th pick in the draft yearin yearout
well they didnt play the chiefs but holy shit we have to hope this team beats the colts my god its trash

silver lining is now bills will try to win out for 2nd seed and if they do they can beat the dolphins
finley is a tough sob
hahaha fuck you pittsburgh ya fucking frauds
whether this loss hurts us or not remains to be seen its still a possibility that the steelers could beat the colts or browns that all being said i love watching captain fatfuck leader of men lose
pad da stats should be an eazy one
fuck the steelers
getting spicy out in cincy
my brother and his son are steelers fans this is glorious
steelers ass
bunch of overrated bums their defense is still dangerous but that offense is ass
we couldve won the div if we didnt pretry much lose a game due to covid
also fuck that strength and conditioning coach if we miss the playoffs i want him strung up outside the castle to send a message
cardinals fan here joining in on the steelers hate

love lamar jackson and big ben can suck one
i really want it to work out where we play them the first round of the playoffs dont see them beating us three times with the way they are playing now and the way we are playing now
nice dance juju even better when you got your fucking head removed
we really bout to miss the playoffs because pitt gets smoked the next 2 weeks
i think theyll adjust after the half but damn this is entertaining lol
if you assume we get in as the 7 we want to see the steelers as the 2 not the browns we need the steelers to stay the 2 seed

wait it might be worse bills would become the 2 not the browns we definitely dont want to go to buffalo plus bills now might not need to play for the 2 seed in week 17 against miami
what fucking losers
they need to use this as motivation over the next two weeks because buffalo has no reason to play its starters wk 17 against miami lets go raiders im a ravens fan just rooting for raiders to beat miami
it really hurts me that we didnt beat them once hopefully we get a third shot
fuck the steelers
we all like its going but its not over yet
well now they for sure have to beat either indy or cleveland so this benefits us a lot
fuck the steelers
corvette corvette
i pray that the seeding works out where we get them in the first round
beat the browns
beat the browns
beat the browns
we still need them to win though
puck fissburgh
i think we should root for the browns to take number 1 just so we can see the steelers first


lmao
juju getting blown up chefs kiss
steelers fan here agreeing
i hate that we need this shitty team to win i wish i could just enjoy this for what it is without having to worry about what the bills are doing on week 17
i still dont understand how we lost to this team
anyone else really appreciate our run game after watching the steelers tonight steelers running backs look like they have super glue on their shoes
i mean i enjoy steelers misery as much as anyone but we need them to win their next two and clinch the division for our best shot at making the playoffs remember we have tiebreakers over cleveland not over them even if the reason they have the tiebreaker on us is bs

classic squealers only time they dont get bullshit wins is when it might actually help us for them to do so
steelers losing this sparks joy

browns potentially winning the division this sparks confusion
missed out on my fantasy playoffs by 03 points this was the happiness i needed fuck the steelers
yeah i dont disagree ive wanted ben gone since 2012 and now the rest of the fanbase agrees weve been atrocious lately
yup
they lost to the worst team in our division how does that even happen

still reeling that washington has done so well but thats for another thread
the browns could actually win the division holy shit
shittsburgh squeelers
feels real bad to be the only fuckin team in the whole division to get swept by the steelers if the bengals did it without joe burrow we should have been able to do it with our backups
steelers fan here cant disagree
their loss puts the division in reach if we win out full speed ahead
and somehow ben wants to play one more year
got to love that i can see a post like this 3 weeks in a row
you might need the steelers to win in week 17 for the ravens to get into the playoffs
i felt this post on the steelers sub was actually pretty based
its sad were relying on this team basically that fucking pats loss
we might need them to win at least one of the two games left for us to make it to the playoffs i really hope i dont have to root for them but if i have to i will
these fuckers gonna cause us to miss out though
they eat my rectum but i need them to win so im pounding the redbull and beef this week yins can do it
they beat you twice this season nfl fans are weird

stop karma whoring
no upvote threads mini upvote thread

because mini ones are okay
rent free baby
easiest schedule in the league apart from 2 games the ravens got the same one and are out the playoffs rn and got swept by the steelers am i wrong tough
stop talking shit you assholes
are we really gonna miss the playoffs because of covid

assuming the titans lose to the goat aaron rodgers colts finish 124 titans 5th seed at 115 steelersbrowns lock up the 6th seed or 3rd4th seed

we really boutta lose our spot to miami of all teams seriously
then we need the bills or raiders to take care of business

and if we miss the playoffs itll be because we let ourselves get swept by the steelers yes officiating in those games was shit but the ravens had to overcome
if we lose our on playoffs its entirely our fault for losing to this dogshit team twice and the patriots

we should really be 112 as well
there definitely trying to fuck us out of a spot it seems like by losing out i knew they were overrated but they should beat the bengals easy this should keep the bills aggressive down to week 17 to ensure the 2 seed
they just need to lose next week and we should be ok



right right bengals aint ruin it again are they
they still take division then would be 3rd or 4th seed if ravens win out theyll get in i cant imagine nothing goes our way the next two weeks


i loved how it happened above the b
he got knocked the fk out lololol
its the slide that really pisses me off

but if lamar u know what nvm
pretty bad for a running back
if this ever happened to lamar you know damn well we wouldnt hear the end of it
ben sucks
ben cant throw
haha against that fearsome bengals defense
i am having a good laugh someone said 115 lmao
theyre calling for ben to be benched haha
bench ben and mason rudolph currently trending on twitter
ben has 19 yards passing imagine the shit they would be talking if that was lamar lmao
how tf is this team gonna beat the colts or browns looks like we need the bills or raiders to come through and beat the dolphins
as much as i hate the steelers i would prefer they win their next two games after this week so we can all but guarantee spot in the playoffs for us lol
yeah youre all up in the game thread on rsteelers making a complete ass of yourself

remember we beat him 4913 so the steelers fans cant say anything
lmao imagine getting beat by a racoon
gary busey
looks like a hide the pain harold meme


earlier today to tell him that i guess im a big black and gold fan next week i never heard back from him i just opened the text and realized i fat fingered my text and called them the black and fold lmaothe truth hurts
uhh you should be a fan this week too this steelers team would be lovely to play in the post season if the steelers lose out worst they can do is 115 which is the best we can do and theyre 80 in the conference if the browns win out were in trouble

stop doing it on peoples center field logo painted a huge target on his back and its catching up to him
as a rookie i liked him cause he was humble last year he didnt blow up after antonio brown was gone this year new essentially brown without the production
he just comes across as a little bitch with the dancing dude try and act like a professional
lmaooo this man juju said imagine getting stiff armed by someone who only does tik toks but got rocked
hilarious
bruhhh
usavevideo
i cant stop watching this
my favourite part is that he cant stop doing it during a cold spell or it makes him look weak keep going juju we all want to keep seeing this

he got jacked up

seems like juju isnt a real 1 if he doesnt have one of the best of all time on the other side taking on the best corners for him
born in md spent half my life in la massive usc fan juju is the only one i cannot stand seeing him get rocked by the logo today was arousing

juju really went from respectable competitor to just another player on the filed and now full blown clown

hopefully he has a career on tiktok because i dont see him with a secure contract in the future unless something really changes with his play
so i says to him dance ya fuckin prick bing pow
my thumb hurts for all the up votes ive given juju memes this morning
yikes juju and steelers are on a skid for sure
lmaoooooo
i lold at this
if we had our actual team when we played these frauds we wouldve destroyed them and be contending for the north now we have to hope they win 1 of their next 2 games and the way theyre playing it will be rough
they arent going to win the division if the lose out
imagine going 11 5 and not making the fucking playoffsits entirely possible

it could actually help if steelers lose tonight because it increases the likelihood that steelers will have something to play for week 17

unfortunately they look like fucking butt trash so they might not be able to help us vs indy or cleveland anyway
laughing at the steelers misery helps us the most
has no effect in any way

we cannot finish above the steelers no matter what

edit but you can throw in the obvious hilarity it would be to see them lose and also the motivation factor but purely standings it has no implications in any way
we need the browns to lose 1 for us to pass them anyway and if they do they cant win the division

root for bengals because either the steelers lose 5 in a row or they beat a team we need them to
bengals it motivates pit and buf for down the stretch unless pit is really trying to drop 5 in a row to narrow our chances which it looks like they could be
nah we need the bengals to win
doesnt really affect us ive need cle buf or ind to drop one game no matter what


however i am pleased with seeing the steelers get embarrassed hopefully its a wake up call i dont think theyd finish the season 05 and as weve seen many times sometimes a team just gets in a slump and can use that as a wake up call
totally root for the bengals if the steelers lose tonight you know they are gonna come out hitting next week embarrassed on national tv has gotta be really motivating unless of course they just suck
bengals if the steelers lose the bills have the 2 seed to play for in week 17 against miami and wont sit their starters therefore helping us for the playoff spot against miami
fuck the steelers ill never cheer for them


this is the way
this is the softest most overrated most guaranteed to implode 120 121 122 123 team in the nfl
ohio lurks beneath the logo

they scored finally
i dont understand why so many of you expected the steelers to beat the colts in the first place tbh

ive had colts winning that game for weeks definitely the better team regardless of what were seeing tonight


get that 36 matchup or that 27

45 too but not super likely
ive been saying this for a month i want that ez money
imo we played better than them in both games

everybody going in on this dumbass and i love it
guy is an absolute fuckwit also thats three loses in a row suck shit
new jersey devils twitter handler is actually a legend been roasting random people and teams on social media for years
lmao where are are the steelers fans that were soooo certain that the whole dancing on the logo fires up the other team was bs
for as much shit as yall give him for the tweet hollywood has about 50 more yards in 30 less catches than pittsburghs socalled 1 receiver and tiktok star juju smithschuster just saying
i guess ab was right calling him a bum
ju ju bitch schuster amd claypool the new homegirls
its real sad that dudu smithshitster seems to have regressed kind of deserves it
god damn this guy sucks bengals would be up 30 if they had a half decent qb
you really coached this dude up with this comment
what did you just say about ryan goatley
comon give the guy a break its not like hes their franchise qb

live update our boy just ran for a td he putting in work
he was informed on operation suck for sewell

somebody needs to intercept the transmission so he aborts mission
ryan finley just pulled a lama
young stud
i dont like this conservative playcalling by the bengals right now
guy just ran lamars fake hand off beautifully
come on bengals finish these guys
as an nc state fan im going to have to push back on that
im terrible at gambling so i try not to do it much but i think ive found a way to use my terrible gambling luck to the ravens playoff advantage some time this week im going to drive to one of the states surrounding us that has legal gambling set up already and place a bet on the exact scenario that would have the ravens winning out and still not making the playoffs at 115 maybe im just too superstitious but i cant imagine a scenario where i could ever financially come out on top on that kind of parlay

im not trying to look past these next two games and if we lose either of them we dont deserve to get in anyways but i feel like this bet could save us from the scenario where we would win 11 games and still not make it what do you think am i just crazy or is this just crazy enough to work just realized im not even sure how to make this type of futures bet so hopefully its possible ive only legally bet on sports once in vegas and it did not go well but that just makes me think even more that this is the right thing to do
nice upvoted
do it lol
i started doing it last week browns dolphins colts moneyline parlay and it was a winner ill be on it again this week and again week 17 if necessary
its a good hedge if the ravens miss the playoffs at 115 at least you make money if you lose at least the ravens are in if they won out
dolphins browns colts titans ravens parlay incoming for week 16
report back love this id do the same but then now i feel like me doing it would then offset the juju and im loving this juju
go check it out about now hahaha
dont troll just observe were better than browns fans
i didnt think anyone would be there anymore
they got a reason to win now division title we got this
how about just make fun of them here
pittsburgh could lose out
they are the only team in the afc playoff picture that i hate obviously i hope the ravens run away with the afc


you love to see it
they are straight cheeks just like what big ben likes
this is steelers football
lmaoooooooooo
ayy fuck em
so they really were the worst 110 team ever
if the steelers beat the colts next week and the browns beat the jets is the afcn up for grabs week 17
merry christmas guys
calm down upvote farmer

game isnt even over yet jesus
woah dawg gotta wait til the clock hit triple zeros
letzzz go hopefully shittzburg wakes up the next two weeks


nah id be pissed that those fuckers kept us out of the playoffs
eh id rather make it so we can hopefully play them and get easy redemption i dont care if we dont make a run after that
yeah

id live with it but i wont be happy for sure
so youre ok with the browns and steelers making the playoffs and us not

clowns like you need to leave
fuck the steelers
bengals fan here fuck the steelers
the cleveland browns might be the 2020 afn champs ladies and gentlemen o
the fucking refs
that was a very pro steelers commentator crew theres no way that was pass interference at the end there ridiculous
what about all those missed holding calls on steelers ol i only watched the 4th quarter but still ran out of fingers counting them
what a shame
well they kind of did though steelers were lucky to get that first td
they blew that neural zone play dead before they could have a free shot with it

oh and the fumble looked like it was going in for 6 before they called it incomplete as well

nice upvoted
cincy fan here fts

finley still has a noodle arm
i fuckin loved it
facts
i have to say im disappointed


i played ac during the first half so i missed a big part of this upset

i find this completely inapplicable
they barely beat us in a nail biter in the first go then almost lost to our jv offense the second time i have no fear of this team and pray we get them in the wild card
2nd game dont count in my mind

what do you mean haha
ravens lost both games because of the refs lamar jackson will never lose to the steelers again in his career
im sorry downvoted bc this not it
and we may need them to play better to get into the playoffs

should be playing tight end s kinda

keep losing we dont want your help
a steelers fan told me they were the best in the league yesterday
fuck the steelers
we probably will need it tho because if they lose out that eliminates all the chances since the bills will end up resting their starters against the dolphins and i have absolutely no faith in the raiders beating them that is unless tennessee loses these last 2 games which is very unlikely
unless the browns turn out to not be the team we played a week ago the steelers are gonna get curve stomped

im legitimately worried were gonna miss the playoffs at 115

not way is this steelers team beating the colts or browns
at 112 fucking frauds
this loss is very bad for our playoff positioning now the bills are likely to rest their starters against the dolphins as they are almost guaranteed the 2 seed in the nightmare scenario with the steelers losing out this basically takes away one likely opportunity for us to have help
we have done it plenty of times
imagine losing twice to a team that lost to the bengals 3rd string qb that would be crazy
by playing dance dance revolution instead of practicing
hopefully this sour loss puts some fire under their asses to win big for us in the coming games
fuck the steelers
this will ensure they play hard against the colts browns in the coming weeks may be our only spot into the playoffs
juju wants to be jake paul more than he wants to he julio jones let his ass keep making tik tok videos cuz hes not a 1 wr
this is the fourth ive upvoted today
i truly believe if we hadnt gotten a covid outbreak we wouldve thrashed the squeelers which would have put us in excellent position in the playoffs we almost beat them with our b team
c team
it would make it so much more worth it if we have the opportunity to beat them in the playoffs but yeah fuck that dude
i hate him but there were multiple strains of covid in our facility meaning the issue was larger than him
if we had out team in that game we could win the north if they lost another
fuck skura he cost us the patriots game definitively saunders is a fall guy theres no evidence he was the cause of an outbreak just circumstantial

go ahead everyone bitch me out

nice upvoted
makes it even better that this is from last season at least lol hope they keep fichtner forever
i can hear tomlins displeasure in this pic
the look before a whacking
tomlin dont blink
thats the post
thats it thats the whole post
and the entire nfc east
now is it possible if we can eliminate the titans for you guys

their defense will probably keep them relevant enough to at least finish 3rd
i dont see them being bottom of the division but third place is a very real possibility
could happen if burrow and green comes back healthy and the steelers dont pick up a legit rb1 bold but definitely possible
i dont know about next year our teams will definitely be 12 but the bengals still have a lot of needs i know they just beat them but the squealers defense is ravaged by injury right now if they get everyone back their defense could prop them up again but if their offense stays mostly the same theyll need a all time defense to compete
next year more like next decade

i dont understand how anyone can tweet something like this you are literally setting yourself up to get clowned
now we need them to stop loosing so we can get to the playoffs
get used to her bro shes gonna be very familiar with you for the next few years
so disappointing we gave them that first game and too bad t huntley was still on the practice squad for the second game
fuck you chase

we need them out for blood next week
if they dont they lose the division so they have the motivation
just one just one come on man just one colts browns preferably the browns
but again we really dont need that at all there are multiple other teams to root for that arent the steelers

you arent forced to root for them in any way currently go raiders on saturday well talk next week
truer words
we dont
nope i hope they lose out and the dolphins take an l against the raiders or bills
really hoping the raiders find a way to beat miami on saturday so we can just relax and focus on the ravens last two
if the fins or the colts lose then it dont matter its way more likely at this point that the browns crush the steelers since the steelers are playing like shit
they really wanna cry about the refs tonight after that bs no delay of game penalty against us i just pray we see them in the playoffs

gtfo stfu
im still heated about that tbh bullshit and the way the refs allowed that and then scampered away like some straight up pussies
they had a dozen missed holding calls in the 4th quarter alone lmao

then that cunt reddick goes and cries about the no call dpi right after a replay that shows villanueva bearhugging lawson from behind d
refball good football bad


more cannon fodder come time the steelers vs the browns
two terrible fanbases competing to see which is worst is all i see
we rent free in their heads

man i could never tell what face he was making the entire game this imagine will haunt me in my sleep
youre at the bar feel someone slap your ass then turn around and see this what do you do
dude he always smiling i feel like
thank you for making this a meme
hes smiling at you beavis
what a delightful little scamp
this picture is incredible i hope he frames it

i hate the steelers more today then yesterday i didnt know this was possible fuck the steelers

theres no way the steelers back into the playoffs losing 4 straight right low key kinda nervous tbh they gotta come out with some balls next week
if they end up 115 and we do too they have the tiebreaker
we need the colts to look like the steelers did tonight
if the steelers lose to both the colts and the browns and end up 115 they could fall all the way to the 6th or possibly the 7th seed

if the steelers tie miami at 115 they would both have an 84 conference record so it would go to the next tiebreaker best wonlosttied percentage in common games minimum of four

the complete tiebreaker rules can be found at



if the steelers finish at 115 and miami loses a game then if the ravens finish at 115 the steelers would be the 6 seed and the ravens would be the 7 seed

as it stands right now the steelers have fallen from the 1 seed to the 3 seed with their 3 game losing streak two of those losses were to teams with losing records 68 wft and 3101 bengals the last game the steelers won was 1914 against the covid19 depleted ravens with several practice squad players starting

if that idiot head strength and conditioning coach super spreader had not infected the ravens team the afc north could possibly look a lot different today with 3 teams tied at 104

either way the ravens are peaking at the right time while the steelers are in a nose dive however we need help to get in the playoffs and they are already in
ive already accepted the ravens are gonna be playing the best football in december go 115 and miss the playoffs

pittsburgh is losing out and the bills will have 2 locked win or lose after next week nothing to play for vs the dolphins other than if they lose to dolphins they play them again vs playing the ravens if they win
i am very unfamiliar with nfl tiebreaks but if we win out steelers lose out and browns split their next two ending the north title in a 115 three way tie who would win im not familiar with upcoming schedules either but was just curious
the playoff machine has the answers you seek in this case a 3way tie the steelers would win the division because they own the headtohead and wed be ahead of the browns for the same reason the only other nondivisionwinner who can get to 115 is mia v unlikely but if they do theyd squeak in ahead of us and cle would get bumped out of position

basically were in a good spot unless pit loses out and cle wins out then wed be up for a wc spot against pit and theyd own the tiebreaker over us
steelers us browns that order we make wild card for sure browns might miss out depending on the dolphins titans and colts situation
you cant even type in rnfl sub to much going on right now its so hilarious
rsteelers is better rn
just saw im another post it will be the steelers who take it
he hit that boy so hard we wont ever find juju doing another tik tok dance he wont sleep well tonight cause he will have nightmares about von bell
id give him dpoy for that juju really thinks its gon be sweet vonn gave him a wakeup call
nice upvoted
id like to know what hines ward thinks about it


52 completion
170 passing yards
1 int
2 fumbles 1 lost
624 passer rating
2 cases settled out of court

espn is ripping them apart now

ben cant throw
this is like a copypasta
fat rapist fuck
dont clown anyone for having a porn addiction that shit is real but yes i concur
steelers fans on their way to compare someone with two rape cases to someone in a good relationship
out of curiosity if jets beat browns and browns beat the steelers after they lost to the colts who wins the north

all 3 are 115

highly unlikely just interesting
steelers
browns could win the north if the steelers lose every game and they win which is a possibility now if the titans and steelers end up as wildcards are only chance of getting in is a mia loss
im curious as well granted its unlikely to happen bit ive seen stranger things
us if only the refs didnt hoe ustwice
to win out and the dolphins to lose just one of their games or the colts lose just one of their remaining games or the titans to lose out or the browns lose out

so if the dolphins win both lv and buf colts win both pit and vjax titans win either gb or hou and browns win either nyj and vpit then we miss the playoffs if we win out seems fairly likely that just one of those scenarios will go our way weirdly the steelers winning just one of their next two will ensure us a playoff spot if we win out so go steelers

feel free to correct me ive just been messing around with it for about 30 minutes now
browns lose 1 not both
this has already been heavily discussed and concluded 2 minutes on this sub would have saved you a lot of time
dont lose to a crappy ne team and all your worries go away
lol the steelers aint beating the colts next week or the browns

were gonna get screwed again

seems right dolphins definitely cant beat buffalo and i dont think that titans can beat the packers fuck those clown ass steelers though
it has to be a joke at this point this many posts about it
titans could drop 2 gb is really good and watson has the will to win any game

aw is a w but we seriously beat ourselves the first game with all that turnovers in the redzone
when did the browns beat the steelers
i didnt watch the game didnt check scores got on ig and saw an ig post flaming juju and then checked the score and busted a nut fuck the steelers

edit anyone know where i can watch the game now besides game pass


clear asterisk next to their 2nd win
first win we spotted them 7 points off a picksix early and lamar threw another pick later tippedball ints are random occurrences we were within a score of them

second win we brought out our cteam and a backup roster of cardboard cutout fans and played them so hard we came within five points

this steelers team is extremely overrated and their record in singlescore games proves it teams should split their singlescore games about 5050 but the steelers were 60 in singlescore games until three weeks ago and now theyre 61 the ravens are 24 for comparison

statistically things break even for teams over the long run nobody gets that lucky on turnovers penalties random drops etc and a couple close games get away from everyone otherwise belichick would have had way more than one undefeated team go to the playoffs now that its finally happening to the steelers their success looks hollow but it always was the counterargument is that good teams find a way to win or work to win the close ones but thats just not borne out in practice


states all 3 possible options any one of them puts us in the dance also available if you wanna see any other team such as the browns
will say that this isnt necessarily every option just the simplest and easiest to understand there may be others involving ties and crazy sovsos tiebreakers not listed that i wouldnt even know to think of lol

and not my list thank the people over at or reddit
if we lose to ny and beat cin and mia loses 12 games were still in
remember that we can lose to the giants and we would still only need miami to lose 1 game
not that i really give a hoot but if colts and browns both lose a game who gets left outta the playoff just curious
its nice that lv and mia play before the ravens this week lv has a playoff chance but it depends on the ravens losing out
the paths of pain

hes not gonna retire hes gonna make 44m next season then retire gotta support the beer and porn addiction somehow

edit 4125 million dollars
ya let ben retire so they can start rudolph or the duckman again thatll be great for us tbh
they say they can save 19mil if he retires
big ben is not one to respect the wishes of others
i dont get it he has 30 touchdown passes with 2 games left in season and has 10 interceptions

i know hes had some bad games and lamar jackson is far superior to him but people are acting like roethlisberger has like 10 touchdown passes and 18 interceptions or something

that hollywood deep ball he completed is amazing had no clue he saw mark open and went deep love it

im rock hard from thinking about option 2
one of them losing has to happen
i want to play tennessee in the playoffs so lets have each of cleveland indy and miami lose a game so we get that 5 seed and play them 1st round
as funny as this pittsburgh loss was it could hold some consequences heres the reasons im worried

the steelers are playing horrible right now a win from them in the next two weeks is unlikely

the bills can clinch the 2 seed with a win and a steelers titans loss this weekend the steelers play the colts and the titans play the packers if this happens the bills will rest their starters vs miami in week 17

dance on that you limp dick tik tok fucker
wheres your famous little dance now bitch

if you dont say steelers i question if you are a ravens fan
1steelers 2browns 3bengals even though i dont like the bengals i think they are the most likable of the 3 there are some bengals players in my all time favorite non ravens players list
i hate the steelers playersorganization the most but also fucking hate browns fans the most out of any team in the nfl with their napoleon limp dick complex bengals only piss me off because of burfict and the fact they eliminated our playoff hopes
the sqeelers no doubt about it
come on we all low key like the bengals just dont say it to their faces
is this a serious question lol
chad johnson made me stop disliking the bengals a little
i personally see it as the ravens vs the steelers got me into football to begin with my dad got seasons tickets when the ravens started and growing up a ice hockey fan it was a slow build to my football fandom and their games convinced me when i look at the steelers i see a rival that i hate to lose to i love to beat and at least when we do lose to them it is a team with a history of winning and greatness in their own right so playing them close is nothing to be ashamed of but losing to the bengals or the browns with their history of shame and embarrassment yeah i absolutely hate either of them way more because they can never back up any words when it truly counts
bro come on now
the steelers then the steelers and also the steelers
steelers the other two are like little kids kicking your shins annoying but its cute that they try
browns closing that gap but ill go steelers for now
not even close
browns and bengals are and always have been irrelevant
i wouldnt trade a steelers humiliation for the world but this game did have an interesting affect on our playoff chances im going to take a look at that and analyze our playoff percentages using basic statistics and ignoring any perceived matchup favorite cuz as we all saw tonight any team can win

effect of steelers loss

had the steelers won this game the only way we miss the playoffs at 115 is with any of the following

all of the browns colts or dolphins win out titans win at least 1 game

without getting too far into the statistics there are 3 ways that can happen out of 256 combinations or a 117 chance that we miss the playoffs at 115 and therefore 988 chance we make it at 115

but now the division title remains up for grabs if the steelers go 02 and the browns go 20 then the browns win the division and the steelers will hold the tiebreaker over us for wildcard divisional tiebreakers are applied first so we would be the first team eliminated regardless of any tiebreaker we hold over other wildcard teams ie the colts

so now at 115 the following scenarios can keep us out percentages assume all games are equal odds

steelers lose to browns colts browns beat jets dolphins win out titans win at least 1

it basically would nullify our tiebreaker over the colts and wouldnt matter whether the colts lose to the jags in week 17 this doubles our chances of missing out to 234 and reduces our odds to 976 obvious a very small change in percentage but thats assuming we win out which is only one possible outcome for us

general playoff odds

for those interested here are the odds if we lose a game

1 at 97 we can still get in if the dolphins lose 2 and the raiders lose at least 1 187
2 at 106 loss to bengals we need at least one of the browns dolphins or colts to lose 2 578
3 at 106 loss to giants we most likely hold the tiebreaker over the dolphins by strength of victory not determined yet depends on many other outcomes so we need either browns or colts to lose 2 or the dolphins to lose 1 859

overall odds of playoffs all games being equal

976 x 14 187 x 14 578 x 14 859 x 14 65 not accounting for opponent difficulty
i think them losing today is good for us tbh cuz now for dam sure theyre gonna go full throttle in wk 1617 against colts and browns to ride a win streak into the playoffs
if they have any worth left theyll beat the colts to redeem themselves but fuck it we put ourselves in this position
this is the real harbaugh ravens not that its bad but last year was an anomaly maybe 3 years total we were safe before week 16 we usually make it and thats why i live him we also have got fucked over so brace newbs
so basically the bengals might have fucked our playoff chances lmfao bengals eliminating us 2 times in the past 5 years how fitting
i did that last scenario with the colts losing to the jags and i had the ravens dolphins and steelers coming in at wildcard how did you get the colts beating us out
the dolphins and browns are going to win out the steelers are going to lose out and the ravens miss the playoffs because they got swept by the steelers who will get bounced out with their 6th loss in a row in the wc game

the only hope is the texans beating the titans week 17

i like the approach slow and steady wins the race i think weve got a shot at a sb we can keep up with high scoring teams like the browns i honestly think if we can backdoorsneak our way into a playoff game i think we can run it home
browns aint the team we should be worried about keeping up with when it comes time
im not even sure if we will make the postseason
any team has a legitimate shot at the sb if they can make the playoffs lets focus on getting there first
this is our year to sweep the division champs and miss the playoffs

ahahahahahahahahaahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahaha
steelers and browns lose out

ravens win out

this is the playoff scenario i want
fuck u brownies
womp womp they talked so much shit next up covid was started by art modell
4 players aint nothing we had 20
who gives a fuck we swept those bitches
those browns fans crying about the ravens can get fucked worst fans in the league by far
i know right they cant even compare to what we went threw no other team can really
its almost like an outbreak can happen to any team and every organization probably has some people who are violating covid protocols
the amount of purposefully obtuse numbskulls on rnfl hurts my brain
a better comparison would be to the situation before the colts game
i dont understand all the claims the nfl delayed the steelers thanksgiving game so the ravens could get their starters back but the nfl wont give preferential treatment to anyone else the ravens had to call up practice squad players to field a 36 player team not sure how that was an advantage
removed
if browns miss playoffs and ravens make it because of this then it just shows how rigged the nfl is the nfl has an emergency 18th week they could implement really that extra week off for many teams would be a blessing the patriots got their game pushed with two players with covid why wouldnt browns get same treatment
coach em up gruden
we need him to put the dolphins through the gruden grinder
da raidaaaaaas
70 raiders keep it going boys besides darren owes us for wasted time in baltimore
hahahaha
they blew it oh man
raiders fuckin suck
pain
waller is going to come through for the ravens one last time

browns art modell did it
time to hear about the nfl giving us every red carpet on the planet cause they dont understand having half the team test positive over the course of multiple consecutive days leading up to the games pushed back isnt the same as 1 or 2 cases and a shit load of close contact negatives
they didnt push back our game when humphrey caught it

only one brown has it and the rest are close contacts
im convinced browns fans are now brain dead after so many years of consistent failure
browns fans covid forced us to pick johnny manziel and justin gilbert in the best first round of the decade and it made us go 016 it probably caused the ravens to sweep us too the nfl protocols are a joke and art modell did this somehow
glad we found a great replacement tho
historically this team has always had top tier fbs
i dont id take ricard by a country mile plus last year juice threw sideways shade at the ravens about how glad he was out so fuck him how great is it there now juice id rather have boldin back than anyone who went over there
yeah hes looking good tonight
removed

fart in it before you give it to them
i didnt see the wrapping paper at first i was going to demand this be removed
my husband is a steelers fan and causes me extreme pain to have to spend money on their merchandise for him and then of course all my facebook ads and whatnot are for steelers stuff

fuck rnfl too
totally unrelated but lmfao kyler murray threw the game ending int to basically end the cardinals season and people were already saying murray is leaps and miles ahead of lamar we all know what lamar did his 1st year as a starter this is murrays 2nd year as a starter and cant make the playoffs good luck with your 56 qb az
yeah i am a browns fans i like visiting this sub becuase the football conversation can be really good and its great interacting with another fan base

ppl dont realize that the organization had like 30 confirmed cases they had no idea who might have it and who might not have it browns and other teams have had 1 or a few confirmed cases and some close contacts no team has had covid issues like the ravens hence why they were treated differently gotta hate ignorant fans
twitter is awful dont use it

its not a good place for anything
lmao what rnfl threads have you been to every single one ive been in anyone who takes more than 2 seconds to think about nuance is downvoted to hugh hell

update just thought id share this riveting conversation with a high iq browns fan lmao
same shit on rbrowns where they are whining if we were the ravens this game would be delayed a week
didnt the titans game get moved a full week for five player positives and six staff ravens were crushed with covid and had to dress a practice squad against an undefeated team

lmfao lamar jacksons first year as a starter is going down in history as one of the greatest seasons ever for a qb lamar lead us to the playoffs first seed in the afc and best record in the nfl and best record in franchise history what does kyler do his 2nd year as a starter lose to the 59 49ers throws the season ending int good luck with your 5 foot 6 qb az dont ever compare him to lamar ever again
one good pass makes him better than lamar lmao you gotta be joking
everybody that said they would take kyler over lamar are reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaallllllllllllll quiet right now
please cross post this to rnfl just for the salt alone

how ironic how we have to rely on both of these clown shows to make the playoffs
that was awesome
i have never seen that before i wonder what ben said
commentators pushing the debate all night in the cards vs 9ers game the one dude even said he would take kyler over lamar in a 1v1 tackling scenario in the open field only one of these guys holds the all time single season rushing record for a qb and has an endless highlight reel of ankle breaking put some respect on his name
whoever said hed take kyler over lamar 1v1 in the open field is a joke and should have his commentators license revoked

kyler is a very good player but hes not lamar he throws a prettier ball but hes not as good of a qb overall and hes definitely not as deadly as a runner
kyler just took a huge l to cj bethard lamar would never
why lamar is so hated is the biggest mystery to me people will search for any reason to spin the narrative against him
i think kyler solved that narrative by losing
in the game yesterday kyler murray scrambled to pick up a first down with his legs during a 4th down play

after the play the dumbass announcer goes now that is just talent that 31 out of the 32 teams do not have

are you fucking kidding me
yea i feel like its just fluff to fill the air when they start talking about how they havent seen someone play like kyler theres literally a qb in the same division that plays a similar style of ball

lamar is going to be compared to every blackmobile qb in the league i bet you theyre going to compare jalen hurts to him next
haha pundits stopped making the kyler lamar comparison several weeks ago when lamar started reminding everyone why he was a unanimous mvp

but if kyler has a few good games again next year theyll come back out of the woodwork looking for clicks and hope we all forget how fucking stupid they are
people will always say dumb shit no point in posting this here
when the ravens needed lamar the most the man came back to the game not on 1st or 2nd down but on 4th fucking down and needed to make a season saving play and he did just that when az needed kyler down a td to get them into the post dude threw the game ending possibly season ending int in the red zone lamar the most disrespected athlete in america and it aint even close good luck with your qb who can barely see over his own line az
people want to compare lamar to other qbs because theyre wanting to find ways to discredit lamars success and talent people just want to hate lamar even though he acts and carries himself as a true professional
this happened a lot with joe and matt ryan every year it felt like joe had a new clown car of receivers while the defense got consistent upgrades matt kept getting better and better receivers yet joe could seemingly do magic in the playoffs even if he left a lot to be desired during the regular season i used to love the first game of the playoffs it was almost a for sure upset win by joe and company

x200b

matt ryan will just go down in history for 283
kyle murray lol
by making this post youre comparing murray and lamar
well kliff isnt a good hc

these are fax with such we shall stunt on these hoes
its a bad comparison for sure but you also need to remember the ravens are a far better team and have a far better coach

with that said lamar will always be compared to mobile qbs but its not because he actually compares to them rather it is because no one is like lamar so you have to compare the closest thing to him you see it every day when the media talks about him hes compared to vick newton marino peyton and a bunch of others because he doesnt fit into one prototype he is the prototype for the way he plays the game

im a big kyler fan but he has a lot of work to do to get to lamars level still
now do josh allen
i had to chuckle when kyler threw a terrible pick in the end zone with the game on the line and the announcers blamed the receiver who in actuality had no chance to make a play on the ball because it was so under thrown lamar would be lambasted for that kind of throw in that kind of situation
i guess were forgetting theres two sides of the ball
i dont mind the comparisons i just hate when people try to say hes as good as lamar
midget murray blows
theyre both black undersized and they run

seriously theres a good chunk of america and media that dont see beyond those things its sad af

edit i see many people here fall into the category outlined above dont downvote just be better
kyler is afflicted by a terrible offensive scheme and play calling more than lamar though
i dont even think there is really a strong argument that murray has been better than lamar this season
hopkins and who else the cardinals do not have one of the best receiving core stop it

i view the raiders as an extension of us tonight so i took this personally
i saw this shit too on the nfl app whats going on
might as well create a thread for this game given the implications it has on the ravens making the playoffs or not can either snowman or mod pin this

rip to my inbox i guess
stop the count
ive been a raider fan for over 30 minutes now and im already depressed
ive never talked trash on other teams subs but the raiders make me tempted
ive hated the dolphins ever since they hit my boy flacco
fuck the dolphins

fuck dan marino
who wants to make the trash talk thread
seriously fuck the raiders fuck the dolphins but fuck the raiders
after 3 hours of raiders fandom i never want to do this again
this the most comments i seen in a non ravens thread lol
thats their 4th and 29
derek carr looks like a default face from a character creator in a gta knockoff
how does a team that constantly flips their quarterbacks back and forth like that manage to luck into so many wins shit is frustrating as fuck
fuck man can you imagine lamar with andrews and waller at te
and people here think roman is bad grudens playcalling especially in the red zone is hot trash not one jump ball to waller in the end zone all night
whatever boys we can make the postseason with a little bit of luck see yall tomorrow at 1
i hate the raiders
great return hopefully they can get some points off that
2322 would be the most ravens thing ever man i swear to god
ahh straight out of joe flaccos elite play book

1 throw deep bomb
2 draw dpi call
3 profit
i absolutely shouldnt be laughing but what the hell did i just watch
ya know fuck steve saunders fuck typhoon rain fuck the pats

i really hate that we have to rely on other teams to get us in ughhhh
what the fuck was that
what the fuck was the coverage on that completion just letting the guy run right by you doesnt seem like a great idea
fuck you vegas
fuck the raiders pussies
right before i submitted this i managed to pick up on the fact that i initially titled this thread 12262020 unofficial week 15 saturday night game thread miami dolphins oakland raiders

yeah i still havent gotten use to the fact that the raiders now play in sin city
raiders need to realize carr sucks and they need to put mariota back in
i dunno i woulda have taken the td and gone for 2
what an beyondidiotic facemask penalty thats on gruden when you allow people to be that stupid and unaware of the situation seriously that tackle should know that play is a death penalty and he grabbed on with everything he had bad coaching no excuse
our boy darren waller gotta bang out
this game is peak frustration
oh my god he missed the extra point thats gonna fuck us isnt it
where the hell is the offsides flag
god the raiders are so shit what the fuck was that
wtf raiders way to continually give that one away in every way possible just penalize yourselves to a loss
raiders defensive coordinator should be fired tomorrow
the rnfl game thread for this is like all ravens fans haha
every time i see waller be awesome i dream about what couldve been

like i dont begrudge anyone he wasnt very good when he was here because he was struggling with addiction the raiders just picked him up off the practice squad as theyre allowed to we didnt protect him because again not good here and im happy for him to see him succeed like this and more importantly conquer his demons

but like imagine how much lamar loves his tight ends and imagine him throwing to that
3rd and 1 waller beat his man by 5 yards but no weve got witten going vertical gotta hit that one
can we get a ghost of marlon humphrey punch for a turnover
can we get a darren waller back please
if they cant get a td here i will lose my fucking mind
game over we never get any help
can we extend tucker for 10 yrs 500 mil
fitz you love throwing picks id appreciate one right now
we play in vegas next year we better win by 30
dude im getting fucking destroyed how the fuck could the raiders be so fucking bad shut up liver youre fine
i feel like the ravens just lost what the hell did i just see
gruden time to put mariota in when in the redzone
the fact that jacobs has only five carries in the first half is criminal thats some greg roman offense right there
why no jacobs
waller do it for baltimore
good stop but i have no faith in derek carr i feel like the raiders have started every drive at midfield and wasted like five redzone trips
im so pissed and im not even a raiders fan this game should be a massive blowout
most invested ive been in a nonravens game in awhile

im delirious rn
fitztragic please
thate a fucking awful call but ill take it lmao
as ive said before

90 percent of the time a deep ball winds up being a pi

change my fucking mind
dare i believe
lmao the dolphins guy was trying to pull him into the endzone by his leg
i cant believe what i just witnessed
thats what i call a gruden grinder
so ahh lets go squeelers if colts lose do we beat them on tiebreaker for the win early in the season
yes if either the browns colts or dolphins lose in the next two games dolphins one game and the ravens win out we make the playoffs
lets fucking go raiders
ravens legend darren waller im glad hes doing good now
gruden put in mariota i beg you
i said watch the fake
most obvious fake ever
i dont trust them
god this raiders defense fucking sucks
lamar with a sponsorship
can i get a tua tagliaturnover
i havent watched a dolphins game this year but does tua always just throw the ball for like 4 yards per attempt
waller is a one man offense wow
raiders defense wants the ravens in the playoffs but derek carr doesnt
thank god the raiders have a legit pass rush tonight
enemies list
gruden
carr
are you fucking kidding me
the joe flacco torrey smith connection
how was that not offsides
defense i need ya
i had my life alert in hand just in case
i dont understand how other teams watch football without a justin tucker
how the fuck do you let a guy get that open in that game position
should have gone for the td not a fg idiots
great time to blow coverage and some fitzmagicfuck i was hoping i wouldnt have to cheer on pitt
fuck daniel carlson too
why rip to your inbox
jon big dick gruden come thru
pls win for us raiders raiders kinda sound like ravens right hehe so that means were close
huge return
fuck yeah touchdown
ravens legend
derek carr is halfway between preacl flacco and postacl flacco but minus the elite dragon clutchness

prove me wrong
fuck shoulda been picked
saw that fake coming a mile away lol
was thinking watch the fake
obvious fake if i ever saw one still didnt stop it
cmon raidaaas get a fuckin td to end this half
damn dont know if any of you are pro wrestling fans but brodie lee formerly luke harper in wwe just passed away
come on man i just want to be able to fully enjoy our boys playing tomorrow without having to stare at the box scores of the fucking browns and steelers games the whole time
man just throw it to waller how hard is that
fun while it lasted
raiders are fucking trash i hate rooting for them
wouldnt mind the raiders finishing a drive here
its always funny when receivers leave us or the eagles and become good after leaving
carr is so so bad on second reads
welp guess were rooting for the steelers boys fuck all these trash teams
wtf was that call on 3rd and 1
what the actual fuck was that
holy shit gruden is a fucking awful waste of money
stop were not rooting for the steelers were rooting against the team that abandoned baltimore fuck the colts
one handed in stride

waller is incredible
jason witten looking like your grandpa snagging that black friday tv
carr just holds the ball sooo long
gruden is trash bro
how to raiders fans endure this every week
3rd and goal and he throws a pass that has pretty much zero chance lf getting a td
darren waller how tf
that man is a beast
waller kelce
an andrewswaller duo would have made my pp so hard
mariota gets a 1st running there
fuck their playcalling
raiders dont deserve waller ffs
i meeaaann i feel like carr couldve ran for the first down
run for the first down carr fuck
carr hasnt learned to just force the ball to waller
so bad on 3rd down thats why he will never be an elite quarterback
tua seeing ghosts out there
tua has thrown the ball 22 times and only has 94 yards lmao
now we need a long pass for a td raiders dont know how to score inside the 20
derek carr had like 20 seconds to pass and threw a 50 yard pass to a 511 receiver that was double covered
for fuck sakes put mariota in
fucking ryan fucking fitzpatrick is about to end our season
reminder carr bum ass took a bad sack that cost them a fg
do we ever get help when we need it ffs
the raiders held the dolphins to a field goal

now derek carr if um you want to remain the starting qb in las vegas for 2021 yeah now would be a good time to prove why
im in the fantasy championship against waller and i literally do not care if he scores a 80 yard td here
missed pat i swear the nfl is scripted
fuck carleson all my homies hate carelson
i guess the raiders dont care about my mental health
yup thats about right fuck
i cannot emphasize how much i hate daniel carlson right now
down by one we need them to drive down and score most likely last possession

this is basically a ravens game lmaoo
god having justin tucker in your back pocket is such a comfort if the raiders dont score a td i dont trust em
thats definitely not pi but thank you
that is a really fucking tough pi man not gonna lie i hate and love that they called that shit
run the ball run out the clock kick a fg

the football gods want us to control our own destiny
i honestly dont trust that kicker to make a 30 yard kick
i said i hated the raiders earlier im sorry i meant i love the raiders
19 seconds cmon d
oakland deserved to lose their franchise
why dont you go for a td fucking raiders
no help

as is tradition
oh god i can hear fitzpatrick smacking his gum while chewing his fucking cud
why are these teams blowing the games in this fashion do they know were watching
so what do we need to do to get to the playoffs
fuck the raiders
i fucking hate the raiders
that hurts lol
can the people saying thats why you go for the touchdown shut up it was 100000 the right call just complete idiocy from their defence
raiders are the worst team in the league hands down that game should not have even been close
big return lets gooooo
touchdown raiiiiidasss said like how chris berman says it
almost a full quarter in and its pretty apparent that miamis run game and offense in general is nightandday better with myles gaskin than it is with salvon ahmed gaskin returning from covid19 has 22 yards on just 2 carries whereas ahmed has 2 yards on 4 carries their offense just has more spark with gaskin on the field and it will be key for the raiders to contain him for the remainder of the game

also let me use this opportunity to tell all ravens fans to draft both gaskin and jk dobbins next year in fantasy that way you can name your team gaskin dobbins
i am a josh jacobs fan for the next 152 hours
hey diddle diddle
i always wince as someone kicks other than tucker theres always a good chance theyll miss
this defense is flashy then just nonexistent

sounds familiar
it was so obvious fuck you gruden
begging for a win in a game of teams inferior to our own makes me pissed off again about the circumstances surrounding our 3loss skid
thats just a horrible play call to run a draw
well its been over an hour since i became a raiders fan now and i have this overwhelming feeling of hopelessness is this normal
fucking losers
this raiders defense is making me extremely grateful for wink
25minute touchdown drive would be sick
trash
what was that play design
damn the raiders are bad
fucking raiders
he had the lane too
lets go colts losing
lets go jets
whiten is averaging 373k per catch this season why is he still in the league again
season on the line


lets go to jason witten
as a raiders fan for the last hour and a half thats the effort i love to see out of my defense
raaaaaavens legend
darren waller
love waller
grudens red zone play calling is fucking terrible cost them the chargers game
these dudes get in the redzone and fold like a mf
dumb ass raiders
man put mariota in derek carr is average af funny how fools out there would double down their lives on sticking and building around carr since hes a pocket qb and will shit on mobile qbs like lamar
jacobs is getting 65 ypc

gruden lets not use him inside the 10
hell yeah d
yo this team is pissing me off this should be a blowout and 2 picks
waller is the best te since todd heap
i love you waller
still doing the ravens work i see
waller catches every ball wtf too bad it took getting cut from us for him to get clean but god damn hes turned it around
why does carr always look like he has eyeshadow on
incoming tua comeback bcuz carr sux
this game is giving me more anxiety than watching the ravens plz raiders
god carr is garbage
lfg
big boy sack
thank everything for this defensive line
any other game im rooting for tua not tonight
a td here would be nice
waller td incoming
for fucks sake get mariota in the damn game
just win this game raiders and i an obnoxious fan promise never even to think about you ever again
hurts having to root against fitzmagic
tua with a mask on under his helmet is extremely saddening for some reason
nooooo dont do this to me fitz
of fucking course
plz fitz dont do it
we need fitztragedy
december 26th is no longer boxing day it is fuck derek carr day
please be fitztragic tonight pleeeease
dolphins are mediocre as fuck yet super lucky these clowns should not be in playoff contention
i feel like im watching us play rn lol im out here yelling at my screen
afc east is the second worst division in football
put in mariota
gruden lost this game im glad we have harbaugh man we take him for granted
can i get a billy cundiff
for the love of god raiders convert a fucking third down and win this game the dolphins suck
welp this is setting up for a massive disappointment
classic fucking choke job coming up boys
fucking kickers
plenty of time for them to blow it by one point now
holy shit derek carr

this game is like a classic 20132017 ravens game
throw this whole team in the fuckng trash

my raider fan dad after the missed pat
i hate the raiders
are you fucking kidding me
what the fuck is this shit
fuck off
this year is just cursed for us all i can do is laugh lmfaooooo
fucking trash god damnit
shut the fuck up kurt
thats a horrible call lol
the ghost of ravens torrey smith is smiling
to further the at least 201314 comparisons to a vintage ravens game theres the torrey smith special
milk the clock
ill take it but i definitely think that was not pi
weakest dpi ive ever seen lfg lmaoo
bullshit dpi but ill take it
wow please run clock down kick a fg
can we loan them tucker for 10 seconds please
two jacobs runs two miami time outs jacobs td run with 17 seconds left
their kicker is having a really good year gonna chalk that missed pat as a fluke
neutral zone infraction holy fuck
after they missed that fuckin pat i want them to score lol
fuck that i dont trust that kicker man
holy fucking shit theyre really going to bottle this
one team knew to use their better qb
goddamn it raiders
fuck the raiders wow unbelievable
fuck jason sanders too
going with the fg and 40 fewer seconds was the right call

just absolutely awful defense when they needed a single stop
hopefully the dolphins get fucked tonight youre my boy derek youre my boy
whoever the fuck that was lets gooooo

renfrow i think
in renfrow we truzz
lets go carr
ill take a fg there for sure lets get another raiders td
field goal will do
waller luv u bb
waller baby please
fucking garbage ass carr
derek carr is fucking buns he doesnt deserve waller
god dammit derek the one thing you couldnt do
carr is trash
jacobs amazing


carr trash
man fuck carr

always thought he was trash but jesus
carr is ass we want mariota
how do you not see that coming if my ass on my couch can see that play clear as day lol
the raiders look so much like us right now offense has a consistent running game and still chooses to pass when it matters which bites them in the ass defense is extremely hit or miss either a flashy play or consistently getting gashed
snapper was obviously snapping towards that guy man how you not see that shit
glad i dont have to root for this ugly shit regularly
great play calling
this is painful
that was the worst release i have ever seen in my entire life holy shit
raiders d first half fuck yeah lets go drop them for a loss shut down the crossing routes raiders d second half duhhh which way do i shoot the ball
what did i say earlier

the raiders defense needs to keep gaskin in check and yeah they didnt that drive with a 24yard run and a td reception to cap it
jeez the raiders suck
the pain
this is the team that beat the chiefs are you kidding me
just brutal
massive play here
there we go
why does jacobs only have 8 carries with carr hurt
feed jacobs please
has ruggs been targeted a single time tonight i feel like thats important to do once in a while
wish we still had waller
im so happy for waller man our boy is thriving
we should have sent darren waller to go pick up ozzies laundry the day we faced oakland fml
okay carr

that was beautiful
yeeaaaaah waller
im happy to see darren thriving
hopefully hes back 100 soon hes a stud
carr and throwing the ball out of the end zone
jon gruden is such an overrated coach
jon grudens had all he can take
it cant be that hard to find darren waller in the endzone dude is like yao ming size
atleast we are ahead right
waller
wallers a beast
holy shit waller is incredible
carr rushed back because he knows if mariota starts hes done as a starter
waller you fucking monster oh my god
carr is actually having a pretty good game against the 1 defense
i know he isnt but is ruggs hurt did he call gruden chucky or something just trying to understand why i havent heard much out of him tonight i guess howard is doing his job
did the red cross pay money for this song
where tf is josh jacobs is he injured
you have josh fucking jacobs what are you doing
raiders pr hasnt said anything on jacobs no clue what the status is
clutch sackkk
lets go on a seven minute td drive
gruden finally used common sense and decided to give josh jacobs the ball
eff off derek carr
oh fuck you raiders
fuuuuuuuck
wow go for a bomb in double coverage when you arent in fg range
god the time you choose to run for it carr smh
how are these teams in the playoff picture good lord
09 on 3rd down just retire carr you garbage can
imagine being 0for9 on 3rd down conversions like jeez thats pitiful
they should be up like 20
this is a shitshow of a qb battle rn come on raiders
not fitz fuck
1 fitztragic please
oh no oh no oh no no no no no
if fucking warner talks one more time about tua and fitz rooting for each other jesus let it go
thats not an awful outcome all things considered derek carr needs to learn how to play qb though
he actually caught something
he fucking missed the pat motherfucker
shows how valuable tucker is
hahahaha we know how this ends now after that missed pat
bet the raiders lose by 1
how tf do you miss that
rravens always believed in you derek carr i swear
please las vegas defense please
of course this idiot kicker misses
did that really just happen and then that other thing happened
you are fucking kidding me right
what is this shit seriously


welp 2 minute drill for the fg carr
fucking trash

i fucken hate the raiders
well its time for derek carr to rereprove that he deserves to be the raiders starting qb once more in 2021
i fucking hate this season
okay carr

i need you again

i know i asked before and implied it was the last time but imma need one more
i have faith in carr i have faith in carr i have faith in carr


if i say it enough it might actually happen
raiders fucking suck learn to tackle you bums
well thank you zebras
the ole joe flacco
ill take one game winning drive please
dont score quickly
drain the clock kick for the win pls
elite hard count
that was a smart play to get the flag
yes theyre being smart
dolphins get the ball back with 20 seconds
why didnt you go for td on 3rd down pussies your defense is ass
thinking about it they mightve wanted the td here
if carlson misses this throw him off hoover dam
carlson you are forgiven
yaaaaaa
please dont fuck us raiders defense
wow are you fucking kidding me
they shouldve taken the td
hahahahah faaaadeee me
i fucking hate our luck
you know what fuck it dont care what happens i fucking hate the raiders
i hate the raiders

so so so much
thats why you score the fucking touchdown fucking terrible
we only have ourselves to blame if colts win tomorrow that pats loss was entirely winnable and gro the team fucked up
this has to be the worst coaching ive ever witnessed
bruh lmao really
raiders are up there with the fucking browns and steelers from this day forward


what fucking pussy coach goes for 3 there undisciplined fucks couldnt defend a hail mary

raiders fans probably want us to fuck off lmao
waller
carr throw the ball away you fool
carr is so bad
woah lol
that giant torch do be kinda sick tho
i know we all want this shit in the bag but this is a great start
why are they winning the tiebreaker man our opponents that we lost to were better than theirs
plsraiders find a td
ffs
fuckkkkkk
everybody knew that was coming except the raiders ffs
why is a drone asking about food
really wish they would score tds instead of fgs but hey we cant be picky over here
at least they are winning despite how bad theyve been playing thats all we can ask for
the raiders are making play after play on offense miami has struggled to put drives together

i feel good about the way this game is going still a whole half to go but the raiders look determined
im liking the raiders chances here and ive seen at least 4 plays so trust me
raiders need to put in mariota
is this game boring af or is it just me
raiders cant do anything right
raiders d sux

darren waller is awesome im glad he turned his life around
is jacobs hurt or something so strange how little he is in but then he looks fine the few times he is in
jacobs has to be hurt havent seen him
if waller isnt semiopen carr has literally no idea what to do
if youre gonna do it figuratively might as well come down here and shove the shotgun into my mouth literally gruden

bruh wtf was that defense on that play
holy shit thats huge
raiders cant even fucking lateral the ball properly what a shit fucking franchise

who got kickoff
this game tightens my sphingus every bit as much as our own

i gotta say the raiders defense is the most inconsistent ive ever seen some plays you drop the runner for a serious loss and then the next play you give up 30 and then the next two you stuff
good play call rod marinarai mean rod melanoma i mean fucking whatever
i begrudgingly accept that first half as reality
those commentators sure love to throw salt in the wound

are you kidding me
do these teams know what a clock is
and because their kicker is dogshit you cant even say just get in fg range
the defenders all lather themselves in butter before the game its the only way ive seen fucking pee wee where the kids tackle better then that
still 3 minutes drain this clock and kick a fg
kurt warner cant stop talking about how much tua and fitz love each other hes obsessed its weird
25 yd gain on second down and then a sneak please
wheres my liquor holy fuck
i do not trust this kicker

imma need a td
i cant tell who the football gods bet on this game
fucking brilliant fb moved sideways
good shit carr
omgomg

im nervous
i wish i could watch this game
thank fuck

jfc
normally im all for some fitzmagic but please not tonight
fuck d that was embarrassing
so so so so stupid unbelievable
hahaha fuck me
pain
fuck
pain
fuck the raiders
raiders would fuck up a wet dream
i never could stand jon gruden and i sure as shoot cant stand him now knock if youre with me
that defense was greg williamsesk
jacobs is overrated
it might literally take the dolphins taking a lead for mariota to get put in
were gonna do it
i guess we have to do it ourselves
were not making the playoffs calling it now
get absolutely fucked
i want a white wr again please


he just pulled a hell of a move on that punt return
if it comes down to a fg hes gonna miss i know it gotta milk the clock and score a td
i said it
x200b

wow
he probably would have ended up a patriot
in hindsight idk how tf the league let lamar drop to 32 this trade up to 32 will be legendary one day
3 beathard
beat hard
beathrad
his uncle was one of the greatest quarterbacks in towson university history a local legend who once threw for 466 yards in a game so put some respect on that name betherd
i know the correct way but i still say beat hard
poor guy i bet he was teased a lot while growing up but apparently hes done well enough to make it as an nfl qb so good for him
removed

view poll
dupree he has inner knowledge of our number one rival
i doubt dupree goes anywhere
none i like who we got in those positions
i brought up harris in the last fa prospect thread and hes good af
isnt thuney one of the top guards in the league he definitely is not a role player
i just gotta say at first i was like whats with this guy and the caps lock but as time goes on im like i really love your energy
not dupree because he would bring the steeler stench any of the others
aside from maybe houston because of his age none of these will be paid like role players
dont pay attention so not sure if his character but if were going on pure talentskill dupree for sure

nelson agulahr
my man steve smith not understanding how contracting viruses work smh
we are raiders fans today boys we need to remember this phrase throughout the game just win baby
if they win they get a partial pass for the ghost to the post
marigoata
stop the count
update hoes are being stunted on
josh jacobs so good
stunt on these hoes
letss gooo raiders
we play nfc north and afc west next year
packers and chiefs games will most likely be 2 of our prime time games next year
im saying it right now rodgerstojordy is off limits in this sub he may as well be part of the flock
exciting always love the chicago and minnesota matchups plus as a michigan native theres always the chance at seeing the ravens play in detroit
and possibly an extra random nfc team if the 17 game schedule goes into effect
with the way the nfc north looking like a joke i dont see much changes to it next year minnesota is stuck with kirk detroit still going to be the worst team in the nfc and chicago aint very good either afc west ugh here we go again with the chiefs but raiders broncos and chargers should be easy ws herbert does scare me tho he looking like a monster in his rookie year but as this shit show of a season taught me never underestimate your schedule no matter how tough or easy its looking like another cupcake schedule for us
yes yes

lets go


i have no confidence that was an obvious fake punt and they still could not defend it
the raiders are trash from play callingtime management to execution of simple plays like extra points pathetic
how tf are you 09 on 3rd downs and not getting destroyed
carr is honestly some ass
please put mariota in smh
b u m s
no


jon gruden
cannot rely on anyone we only have ourselves to blame tho
fuckin raiders got fitzmagicd
i took a nap and just woke up and now im tachycardic as is tradition
cant bet on the raiders lol
i wanna die
id say to boycott hooters but no one goes there anyway eff you gruden
carr is a relative statue even without a groin injury he or more accurately waller better win this game or gruden looks like a fool for not starting mariota if carr loses theres a decent chance its his last start as a raider

rule 1 dont fuck with another teams subreddit
let this be the last time you do this like honestly theres no need to be friendly at all way i see it the whole nfl hate us right now
you deserve it a little
i always try to avoid doing stuff like that because of that very reason of course were rooting hard for the raiders but they need us to lose in order to save their own playoff hopes

its a really weird situation lol
good on them i was we had that attidtude towards shit like that posts like that are beyond cringey
they arent here to help us

they trying to save their season which involves us losing they want nothing to do with us
i only go to other teams subs if i have something to actually contribute no need for a whole post about that im sure they have a game thread where you can chime in
theres a 60s rat pack vegas simplicity to the response

fuck thats funny
they are pretty aggressive over there lol
nah theyre still salty over their covid punishment and the lack of ours
did you try it

brett hundley
nice to see
trace must still not be 100 or they plan on both in the 4th
hope this means goodbye to rg3
im curious
if the dolphins lose tonight we can lose to the giants but not the bengals
if we lose to the finley bengals or the shitty ass no saquan possibly colt mccoy giants we dont deserve to even make the playoffs
this man keeps making crazy ass catches
this darren waller was never on the ravens he had to get through some shit to get to where he is now just be happy for the guy gotta love a good redemption story
he could have been ours
substance abuse ruined him for us

yes finally all the scenarios dont matter unless the ravens handle their business the rest is out of their control
fuck yeah
yessir

edit this mf gon miss the extra point smh
derek carr is forever a g to me i dont give a fuck
omg he missed the extra point
lets gooooo

miami fucked up bad ever benching this guy idiots
one of these teams realized they had a better qb on the bench

pretty sure gruden and carr are the only 2 people on the plane who thought a hobbled carr was the play i saw multiple 3rd down opportunities for carr to just jog for a first down but he was physically incapable some hero he is
im a dolphins fan i came to see what you guys were saying about the game and im glad i came a

how do you miss that extra point
lets goooooooooo pi
that was a crazy throw by carr
wooooo

but seriously make the xp what the hell is going on with kickers this year
fuck
bruh the kicker shanked it we are so lucky for tuck

lets go nelson stunt
this is pure 2020 ravens

edit right on time as expected
lol
but the raiders offense
a packets win would probably screw us
yup
pain
they just let us down
you called it

theres still time
pain

what is this dramatic bullshit theres still time for him to redeem himself
this is a bs argument you cant blame other teams for the ravens situation i hope we make the playoffs but i aint gonna pass the blame off
raiders not raiding

name a more iconic duo
lots of things that can happen stop being a doomer
you mean the best kicker in auburn history
i told you all how none of the teams the ravens needed to lose would lose but i was down voted for truth telling

now its rooting for the steelers and jets lol

lets go
refs are on our side for once
nelson agholor and derek carr are taking care of us
that was a bad call tbh but ill take it d
lol you spoiled the play my tv slow asf
i love agholor


not 100 sure why that was pi a little tacky for my liking but ill sure as hell take it lmaoo
removed
a big shout out to the refs for being dogshit at their jobs

i saw one of these for lamar a couple months ago did it get 
a for effort
this used to be semi clear lmao
elite dragonslayer no mcnair

loan like in soccer
yes

hurts that we got rid of waller but its nice to see him ball out

not yet
no one cause dolphins about to win lmao
there wont be one now
no one
fuck you
just almost had an unfortunate accident bad snap kick going right thank goodness it went thru
and then they came thru with a different kind of accident

i never thought i would find myself being this big of a raiders fan

raiders fan until this game ends lol

lets go raiders

removed
damn the raiders are so fucking pathetic defensively
you can say fuck on the internet
sliding before the end zone looks silly now lame coaching
omg they are going to blow this
they really fucking suck

there goes our playoff spot
removed
yeah that wasnt a clear fucking hold they showed literally 6 times on live tv
removed
i have a 2 part question for the raiders
1 raiders suck
2 go fuck yourselves
were deadass going to miss the playoffs at 115 while a 500orworse team hosts a playoff game in the nfc all because all three of the other afc wildcard teams are going to win out calling it now
lets not forget the texans last week against the colts when they fumbled the ball on what should have been a game winning td the texans are useless too seriously not getting any help here
absolutely infuriatingly useless
true
even more worthless than we thought
fucking useless
removed
removed
thats so fucking stupid

that pisses me off for real wtf was that game
removed
removed
why the fuck wouldnt they go for the touchdown on the 1
what a god awful screw up by the raiders how do you manage to lose that
cant believe we might get fucking eliminated on a hail mary by fitz fucking patrick i turned off my tv thinking game was over after the raiders fg 2 seconds later this shit happens why do we never get help man
must be hard being a raiders fan because pretending to be one for a single game was fucking painful
go pittsburgh tomorrow
fuck me
champagne no cham
fuckkkkkkkkkkk
they literally showed the clearest goddamn hold 6 times on replay fuck the refs im so goddamn tired of their bias absolutely fucking games
all they had to do was play defense for like 20 seconds fuck them
why not take the td there
removed
unbelievable
bad teams find a way to lose
karma came knocking for the raiders
removed
dude they had one fucking job how do let that happen
fuck their coaching staff
nothing goes our way the raiders fucking suck
dafuck

they had the fucking td their kicker had already missed a extra point you dont slide there you dont kneel there take the fucking points they are getting the hail mary chance regardless
that could the be most raiders thing possible holy fuck man
removed
no fuck the raiders
removed

ugh
were cursed
to not take the td so stupid
got fitzmagiced it happens
who in the hell would take a fg instead of a td i know clock management but if you score the touchdown the other team has more pressure
removed
no
never
no
fuck that
nah im good
hell nah but you bet your ass im rooting for the steelers tomorrow
yes anyone who cant just swallow their pride and root for pitt for the greater good is a fucking moron
for once in my life i think i might root for the steelers im dying on the inside

removed
cannot catch a break
removed
how do you like not having a starting qb going into the playoffs
fuck outta here brigading cunt
imagine being a dolphins fan
younger than your last playoff win
week 1 last year preferably
fuck
gruden should sacrifice his dc on live tv
fuck the raiders my god that was frustrating
that was the biggest choke job i have ever seen in a football game if your defense is that bad then score the td and see if they can score a td to beat you going the length of the field
were really going to miss the playoffs at 115 because the raiders didnt try another run for a quick td
even when were not playing were fucking losing
gruden is gonna be avoiding baltimore for the next 10 years now
i was a raiders fan for one day and i most definitely want to fucking stab somebody i get it now
hate the raiders
jesus christ that was bad gruden is a fucking imbecile
missed the extra point got scored on again got bailed out on a massive pi call fg with less than 20 left defense chokes the raiders just fucked me silly
that was the most inept display to finish a game i was rooting for them to punch it in for a td and leave under a minute on the clock for the dolphins to score a td instead of 19 seconds for a field goal then they go and leave a guy wide open deep on the sideline what are you covering when they have no timeouts and try to rip fitzpatricks head off in the same play to instantly give them field goal range threw a high floaty ball too that shouldve been picked off but nobody was near him yikes
i hate being in the position of needing help if only we didnt look like a wet noodle against the remains of cam newton and rex burkhead lmao
im not even mad bc i knew the second fitz came in we were fucked
how do you remove the qbs head and still give up a 34yd pass lol
had a feeling them refusing to score the td would result in a loss raiders defense is one of the worst in the league not even that surprised fitz moved the ball in 20 seconds tua also fucking sucks so hopefully he starts next week
and also fuck the raiders kicker
ftr
my god that was so fucking stupid
as soon as they missed the pat i knew
didnt think the jets lategame defense could be topped but somehow it was done by the team that benefited from that same defense
lets never forget theres a very good chance we wouldnt of had to rely on the raiders if it wasnt for steve saunders fuck you steve
called it

is a brownie allowed in for this one lol fuuuuuck the raiders wtf was that
i officially hate the raiders more than any team in the history of the nfl
i cant believe i watched that entire trash fire game just for the raiders to eat fucking crayons in the final moments
so you settle for a field goal when youre down by that many points then you blitz fitz raiders coaches are fucking morons
i just couldnt shake off this feeling that the raiders were gonna find some creative way to fuck something so easy up 20 seconds and your defense blows a coverage and grabs the qb face mask on the same play how does a team fuck it up that hard
itll be alright if the colts or browns lose tomorrow right
fucking hate the raiders
fuck the raiders
godand i cannot stress this enough dammit
go steelers


fuck the raiders ive seen pillows harder than that defense
they intentionally didnt score a td what bravado fuck the raiders
i cant believe i wasted my saturday night cheering for such a crappy team ugh i feel like i need to take a shower
dont fret guys i think you can still get in i hope someone helps you guys out
there were 19 seconds left after the kick

if they direct snap to carr on 3rd down before the kick he should be able to waste at least 5 seconds without losing a whole lot of field goal range by just staying back while the ol protects the defense is expecting a kneel so they probably wont be too aggressive at first

then if they force a kickoff return thats another 5 seconds off the clock easily probably more

dolphins get the ball back with at most 9 seconds if the raiders waste more time and then youre just playing hail mary coverage at that pointless to fuck up

just a dumb and unnecessary loss
hope everyones ready for the chiefs to run through the afc to an easy super bowl win i dont trust any team to challenge them
fuck you las vegas raiders
their defense fucking sucks fr
as a raider fan i fucking hate the raiders too man
if that clown had gone for any other part of fitz other than his fucking face mask that pass wouldnt have connected but nope not only did he not disrupt the pass enough he drew a penalty that got the dolphins within easy field goal range unbelievable
if 2020 was a last quarter of a football game
what a lousy defense wow
well guess we need a fucking steelers win tomorrow

ugh
i really dont want to root for pittsburgh tomorrow
what the heck did i witness

like 15 seconds left fins no timeout and they do that cant count on lvat all
this is why i am a firm believer of always taking the points screw the extra 40 seconds if you run and dont get in you burn the time anyways all it takes is one broken play to change the game
yeah i guess you can say the raiders suck if it makes you feel better ryan fucking fitzpatrick hits a deep pass to a crappy receiver while his head is dragged around by a facemask grab sometimes you just fucking get beat

what i hated was not scoring the td when you have the ball on the one why to use more clock geez just play football
where do i sign up to be dc for the raiders there must be just a sign up sheet somewhere and no requirements i wouldnt mind living in vegas and getting paid for shitting on the raiders
at the end of the day i didnt think the raider were gonna win they played shit for quite a bit before this game and the fin played are on a roll the annoyance came from how close they got

x200b

x200b

as they say its on to shittsburg and new jersey lol
so now our playoff lives rest on probably if bills beat pats on mnf matt barkley and a bunch of backups in week 17

god damn you raidersdamn you all
its our own fault for losing games we could have won
do not fret ravens fans the dolphins lose vs the bills and you win out and youre in

you have a better chance than us to make the playoffs
now that were in for nowfuck the raiders
i already hated rooting for them because my ex girlfriends racist step dad likes them and then they went and screwed us over now the raiders are like 4th on the i hate your team list
chiefs winning the sb is inevitable anyways
the only hope for the ravens lies in aaron rodgers so i cant wait to see him throw 5 picks vs the titans and derrick henry running for another 250 tomorrow
fuck
can someone plz explain how chucky is an nfl coach
i almost hate the raiders more than the steelers

almost
gruden is pathetic 100 mil now we all know the jets threw that game to the raiders
why the fuck did the raiders not run in for an easy td tf were they thinking with that field goal did anyone tell grudens dumbass that it was 3rd down
fuck the raiders for letting gaskin shit on them and then losing in the last fucking seconds
we have literally gotten zero help from anybody but ourselves since the midpoint of the season its maddening
that game legitimately made me fucking sick
shit bro if we dont make the playoffs and the bears in the nfc make it fuck man ima cry
i just dont understand

57 point lead with a minute left
or
2 point lead with 20 seconds left

i want a td lead every single time
fuck the raiders
should we start a week 16 blame of the game for them
fuck the raiders
im a green bay fan but ravens my 2 as i now live in bmore hoping packers can secure the 1 seed by beating titans tomorrow and i assume that could help the ravens as well
score the points for the love of all that is holy
so does anybody have an updated breakdown of our playoff scenarios after this dolphins win im just gonna be piiiisssssssed if we go 115 and miss out
the raiders were hoes and the dolphins strutted on them now we have to hope the colts lose to the jags or the titans lose to the packers and texans otherwise pittsburgs needs to win and no one wants that
palate cleanser
dont worry boys the nfl knows nobody wants to watch the dolphins in the playoffs they wont let them beat buffalo
how many dbs were the raiders playing down field it looked like only 2 or 3 just why
its over dude we now rely on pittsburgh seasons over
theyre freaking useless i hate them with all i have
we play the afc west next year and i hope we stomp the raiders so bad that mark davis has to fire davis because a fan boycott started from the stomping
i just dont know how you can realistically play cover2 there
the dumbest fucks who ever fucked
man this sucks as a fan of the game that ending was insane some of the most wild last 4 minutes ive ever seen but gruden should be canned
goddamnit im a liberty fan i just want to enjoy the bowl win without being pissed at the raiders for pissing on our playoff chances
are the ravens 115 and missing i have such an awful feeling about it
that boi chucky fleecing that organization lmfaooooo 10 years100 millifuck the raiders
why tf you dont get the td there
something we can both agree on
cant put into words how frustrating that was to watch but on top of going against gaskin and kamara last night in a fantasy final i can confirm i have consumed a lot of alcohol in the past two evenings
i still think they shouldve scored the touchdown but at the very least run around a bit on the kneel down and taking the timqout prior to the kneel was dimb af bad situational football there chucky
i went to high school with the guy who caught the pass mack hollins tho he was 2 years ahead of me didnt know him like at all but ive always rooted for him bc of him going to my school

got damn do i wish he wasnt in the nfl rn tho lol
gruden should sacrifice his dc on live tv
i can almost forgive going down at the 1 if only to burn 40 more seconds assuming youre going to try to score on 3rd and 1 at the 1 but to kneel it out while youre currently losing the game

why are you employed in the nfl
shouldnt be a suprise when needing us to do something
i dont understand just taking a knee on 3rd down at the goal line
what exactly is needed for the ravens to make the playoffs now
choke artists
kc checking in fuck the raiders
why tf cant the raiders do one thing right just have fun with overpaying a tv analyst while we continue to ball with harbaugh and lamar thats all i can say im just happy that our franchise is miles above theirs no matter what happens this year we will be back next year and the year after that and the year after that thats what the flock does we product greatness and dont overpay for a name like gruden or ab i hate the raiders and have fun in nfl purgatory
does this mean were fuked
haha fuck the raiders is our subs mantra

ftr
wow
a new rivalry had been born that said we put ourselves in this situation 4 of our 5 losses had been by less than 7 points if im not mistaken we gotta do better
grudens strategy was soundthat missed xp forced thatwith fitzmagic being as hit as he wasyou want to give him as less time with ball in his hands as possiblethe odds of two boneheads plays on defense simultaneously were dim
chiefs fan here

i love you guys but i fucking hate the raiders more
fitzmagic is real bless the fitz
that was a dean pees level failure
for those asking why gruden pussied out and score the td
1 miami scored a td in the previous possession with 48 seconds gruden wanted to prevent that
2 remember what happened on mnf ravens vs browns when the brownies scored too fast and we had time to score
3 remember when todd gurley scored a td the defenders let him through and the falcons blew the lead
no hate from me
we put ourselves in this position this is our fault
we need 1 fucking game to go our way 1 fucking game and we havent gotten it this is infuriating
how in the hell did they fuck that so badly
man what a fucking collapse i work with a dolphins fan that is going to be absolutely insufferable
browns will lose today
late to the party but f that incompetent franchise
they lose but they score enough so the dolphins d has a terrible week during fantasy championships
biggest blue balls of my fucking life
i know mandrews is good but im still pissed that gruber got waller off of us even though he was on the bench
dolphins are garbage as well pure luck
fuck the raiders and fuck the dolphins
fuck the raiders and fuck the giants for not beating cleveland the other day boi we gotta teach them a lesson today
i seriously think the ravens may come out completely flat and lose tomorrow after seeing that one must think that this is simply not your year
welpthrow on that steelers jersey boys
if you have to rely on other teams losing in order to make the playoffs then you dont deserve the playoffs anyway

lol downvote all you want but its true
the game passed gruden by in 2000 fuck me what a goon banish the team and coaching staff to the nevada badlands and let nature reclaim their new monument to shit
yeah fuck the raiders for blowing that

but if the ravens didnt blow a lead to the titans totally blow across the board against the patriots and have an uncontrolled covid outbreak so no starters played against shitsburgh this wouldnt be an issue a win in any of those games almost guarantees a playoff spot and 2 wins locks it up the team blew their chance to control their own destiny and this is what happens take care of your own business so you dont have to rely on bum ass teams to not do bum ass things its that simple
lets go finssss
how about an official dont lose to the shit patriots thread im just as upset with the raiders as the rest of everyone but if we dont lose games were supposed to win its gonna haunt us later on every game counts in the nfl

what the fuck
they shouldve gone for the td
removed
i hate everything
removed
removed

why would you not take the td its so much harder to score a td in 1 minute than it is to get in field goal range in 20
if ever you arent feeling confident just remember dipshits like him get multiple years as head coaches in the nfl despite their clear inability to coach at all
trust me as a raiders fan i know dude is wasting waller and even carrs prime
100 million
kneeling was the right call 2 men deep on the deep ball that is inexcusable
i mean playing cowardly wouldve worked if they didnt give up the big play and a penalty literally anything less than what happened wouldve been survivable
no one

jon gruden lets run cover 2 when fitzmagic is gonna throw it deep
the 100 million dollar moron
blame your own team for not winning enough
lfgggg dolphins
removed
thats the dumbest fucking penalty i have ever seen that and blown coverage gah
removed
removed

removed
im so fucking mad rn holy shit
lol not even surprised it was the freakn raiders
missing an extra point thats how fucking trash
prevent defense always a mistake
god please let the colts lose tomorrow
fuck the raiders

also fuck the steelers
it is always fuck the steelers tho
removed

removed
removed
shouldve quit while he was ahead when he won the super bowl
why would i even try
id fire him on the spot eat his contract i wouldnt care most bs play calling ever
sorry but gase is still employed somehow
steve saunders
taking the time off the clock and kicking the field goal was the right call by all accounts you really gonna blame gruden for a blown coverage and the most obvious facemask you can make

facts but dont forget the raiders cornerbacks
or the refs giving the steelers 15 wins against us

removed
jesus fuck they are so bad
now imagine putting your hopes in the jets and steelers tomorrow
removed

fuck the raiders
removed
lord forgive me but i know i must root for the steelers tomorrow
i agree with the play where he stopped at the one to help burn up the clock but was yelling at the tv when they spiked it instead of trying to go for the td
gruden co thinking back to how falcons blew it earlier in the year vs the lions and knew they werent safe given how garbo the raiders defense is
removed
what a terrible organization
removed
removed
that facemask was next level stupid holy shit

hopefully thats the last raiders game i ever have to watch

fitzmagick was so fun to watch when he was trashing the patriots dreams this time last year not quite the same feeling tonight
removed

ong bro the frick was that
yeah bad play but its 100 on the dbsplay call not on him
dude put his hand on the mask
removed
nah i still have faith we get in


the colts are without their starting tackles tomorrow so i really think they are going to struggle versus the steelers d now if the colts win i will start to worry a bit more
removed
dolphins were out of timeouts clock was more important than points in that situation if the defense had done their job it would have been fine
removed
fuck gruden
hope he gets fired after this debacle
just watched baltimores best chance slip away to grudens bad play calling how are you all feeling whats our next best option
win out and hope bills beat dolphins
just need colts or browns to lose one right
colts lose tomorrow and hope is back alive we just need 1 team to drop one
i dont understand why people are so worried if we win out we just need 1 loss out of a total of 5 games 2 browns 2 colts 1 dolphins and were in

ill worry next week
im rooting for a browns v steelers for the division n the browns lose missing the playoffs entirely
steelers winning
removed
gruden is such a shit coach
running out the clock was the correct strategy unfortunately they still left too much time for fitzmagic
removed
removed
are you kidding me

worst fuckin game ever
fuck gruden

fuck carr

fuck whoever decided that coverage

fuck the whole team
i dont want to hear how the ravens should have won more games no team in the 16 game season nfl would have ever missed the playoffs with 7 seeds at 115 ravens would be the first fucking so unlikely to happens its ludicrous most people thought the 7 seeds was going to be 79 to 97 teams

how the fuck did the raiders blow that making us root for the steelers damn
that was fucking stupid football
the autumn wind is a fart
wtf were they thinking kneeling incompetent af
gruden may actually murder that guy who did the face mask they were just outside of sanders fg range where the catch occurred so things could be a lot different
so is the dream over

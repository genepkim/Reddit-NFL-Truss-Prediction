I do not fear juju whatsoever. He’s overrated
"Wow, he stiff armed a former undrafted free agent that's 37 years old lol."
Imagine grabbing a face mask and calling it a stiff arm
He's becoming more and more annoying.
Didn't Marlon punch one out on him again?
Remember when Marlon Humphrey made JuJu his bitch with that forced fumble recovery to win in OT.
I used to like Juju at one point. I guess the Steelers diva culture rubbed off him
Lmfao the picture is as clear as day to be a face mask🤣😂 Derek Henry legit throws grown men outta the way and grabs them by the chest. Juju straight up grabbed his mask and pulled him down. In what way is this a stiff arm
Willie better
Imagine committing a penalty on the play that benefits you and the refs don’t call it.. Then pretending you achieved something without breaking the rules.
Need some stats to back up this hubris
I mean he can’t bring up Marlon after he was career highlight-reel embarrassed last season
Love Willie fr

Just tell him we will see them in two weeks
"Because drinking those sweet, sweet Yinzer tears when Patrick Mahomes tears their soft defense apart and Tyrann Matthieu shuts down their gimmick offense will be all the more delicious

Obviously, I’d rather us beat them, but a Steelers meltdown is glorious none the less. Absolute frauds"
Exactly the way feel. Get to the playoffs 16-0 and get bent over and absolutely ass fucked by Mahomes. My god I’m already imagining how great it’ll be.
It’s gonna be a bloodbath honestly. Unless of course they don’t meet because the Steelers get bounced in the divisional
"I think we actually matchup really well with the Steelers. The one thing that really killed the Ravens in the Chiefs game was having to rely on the blitz. Mahomes is really good against that due to his post-snap processing and the playmakers (especially Kelce who's great at adjusting routes to find space).

Tampa is another blitz reliant team. They started out aggressive and we were demolishing them until they started to easy off.

What team blitzes the 2nd most in the league? Pittsburgh. All these guys are top 5 in blitzing.

What team did we have the most trouble with this year? The Chargers. They're dead last in blitz rate."
I hope the Browns beat them in the last game of the season and still miss the playoffs lol
Soft defense?
"Nah.

That’d feel good in the short term, but in the long term it’d suck having the Steelers go down in the history books with an undefeated regular season before we do."
"If the team that played us yesterday shows up, they don't make it passed the first round.   Which would be actually more satisfying to me."
"I really don't get this logic, I'm sorry and I love all ravens fans but it's so fucking stupid to think this way."
Sounds like this dusty post needs a sweeping 😘

Hyped about beating a JV squad that didn’t practice in 2 weeks by 5 points. Hyped about stiff arming someone which is a clear face mask penalty. Hyped about stiff arming Tramon Williams who is almost 40 YEARS OLD 🤣🤣
Imagine getting away with an obvious penalty.
I’ve never understood how Juju can be so physical against everyone but Humphrey. Marlon takes him to daycare when they matchup.
Imagine having the lowest yards per catch in the league
"Juju a douche. I'm glad Antonio Brown hurt his feelings and made him sad. Chase Claypool too; I watched one of his YouTube videos and he reminds me of Zan from Atlanta

Diontae Johnson and James Washington are cool tho"
Juju wishes he was DK Metcalf when he's actually a slightly worse Snead
Remember pre season when this sub was saying juju was the only Steelers player they liked
"You're saying that like you did something to a fucking CB from the practice squad, you fucking clown 🤡"
Good job JuJu but Tramon is not a real Raven hes only been here 2 weeks

"If there’s no index card, it isn’t accurate."
It's to the end of the chain
"I went on the Steelers sub for a couple minutes just to see what ppl were posting and not to write anything in there.

 There were at least a half a dozen posts that were literally just screenshots of our sub mocking our posts. I don't think I've seen that on this sub at all which is awesome. Obviously fuck the Steelers but come on man we're all grown ups here and I'm happy we're able to stay classy and respectful"
"What are they even mocking about they barely beat us at home with refs help.  
  
 It's like us making fun of them because of that second game that we beat them with RG3."
"> There were at least a half a dozen posts that were literally just screenshots of our sub mocking our posts.

I guess that’s not a face mask anymore
I guess Captain Insano shows no mercy
Seriously I was shouting at the TV during this
"Funny how he posted this with the caption: “imagine getting stiff armed 10 yards by a tik-tok influencer”...

Sorry Juju, but you’re a mediocre #2 receiver and soon to be free agent, stiff arming a 38 year old newly-signed backup corner is nothing to brag about"
"This was right in front of the ref too. That shit was ass, the announcer, some time I'm the first quarter circled a holding call. That's when we all knew what time it was."
Refball so sick of this
JuJu is strong as fuck it always surprises me that one person can not bring him down. But fuck him anyways.

Right or wrong I don’t think we have the moral high ground to talk about other people’s real or perceived police records.
It really does kinda piss me off when you look at how easy they’ve had it. Only thing I’d give them *some* credit for is beating the Titans.
This post lost all credibility when it said the browns are shit. Also the Steelers and ravens have identical opponents for the most part.
"PROVEN. and those fucks support a rapist as thier qb.. SUPPORT HIM. 

Fuck.. i hate the steelers so damn much once again."
Rent free
They are still 11-0 though
You realize the ravens and Steelers have practically the same schedule right?
You guys also play the NFC East? Lmao not to mention the best team you guys have beaten is the Colts lmao. Destroyed by the chiefs again and lost to New England and the Titans again. At least you guys might finish better than the browns tho.

You said dream scenario so I can be what ever you want!

We all hoping for that. Although I wouldn’t mind facing the Bills in the wildcard too. Remind Bills fans why Lamar is better than Josh Allen
Definitely want another shot at the Steelers & Cheifs if we talking dream run BUT i just want a playoff win

I’m pretty sure Hill would have broken the plane of the goal if Luke Wilson’s leg doesn’t stop him.
[removed]
No.
"No! Stop the McSorley hype, like Buck he’s nothing more than a meme. His TD pass was more do to Hollywood than him. This is ridiculous"
[removed]
"first i just wanna say i’m incredibly proud of this team for keeping it competitive.

• Marquise (no longer soulja boy but still not hollywood again yet) had a good game and that TD appears to have gotten him back on track, at least hopefully, that was the first time i’ve seen him get real YAC all year

• This team is nothing without Lamar. Granted we had a ton of other players out but god the offense just looked lost, not that it was helped by roman calling like 4 HB dives on 3rd down lol

• Trace looked very good, better than RGIII at that point but I feel bad for RGIII bc he was dealing with a hamstring injury since like early second quarter.

• Our CB depth was very good despite the loss of jimmy, other than a few missed tackles and one 10 yard stiff arm they looked very good, especially MP who played his heart out despite mild injury 

• How the fuck did the D line look that good. We were missing all but 3 players, wolfe was insane and yannick got some good pressure considering how quick ben gets ig out and that he was being blocked by Villanueva

• extend tyus bowser right motherfucking now. He is one INT and sack away from pricing himself off this team and if we don’t i have a feeling we’re gonna regret it big time like we did with Za’darius

• Our 3 week old practice squad TEs are very bad but i really don’t blame them, they’ve had virtually no practice and no reps with the 1s but luke wilson has to catch that TD

• Roman needs to go ASAP. I don’t blame harbs but his loyalty to coordinators can be infuriating

• Why the fuck did we run justice more than gus???? like what in the hell why? why run RB4 more than RB2?????

Overall proud of this team for fighting so hard, i feel like we can catch fire In those last 3 games, go 11-5 and keep it rolling into the playoffs and peak at the right time this year."
"I had the same thought as you about Gus and Justice. Justice looked pretty good compared to Gus, but I think it's only because they were trying to run Gus outside when his strength is ground and pound up the middle. When they ran him up the middle he had some good runs. But then they try and run Justice on short yardage up the middle smh. Too smart for their own good maybe, like maybe they thought, well, gus already had a good game against them last time so they'll be ready for him so let's run Justice instead we'll catch em off hard he he he"
Colon Castillo could actually be the solution at center
Tomorrow I’m still going to wake up with a bad taste in my mouth knowing we got swept by our arch rival. Knowing the circumstances of the game and how we we’re basically a practice squad eases the pain a little but it still hurts. If you don’t think Lamar would have made a difference today you dumb as hell. Lamar Jackson is this team period. After today all the casuals better realize how bad we are without him and we would probably be 3-7 or something. Yes Lamar isn’t the best thrower of the football and leaves us scratching our heads sometimes but this guy always gives us a shot at winning. I hope this game is a real eye opener to our FO to get Jackson some help
"Offensive line was surprisingly decent after we took out Fluker, who was awful and has been all year. Colon-Castillo was excellent compared to Skura and Mekari the past few weeks. Bozeman played better too with Colon-Castillo holding up his end of the bargain. Colon-Castillo has a really low center of gravity and what seems like a really strong push. If he can get the mental aspects right he could be really good.

Orlando Brown Jr. basically carried the offense on his back as much as he could this game. He balled out, and it started to look a lot like last year at times when  Orlando made it to the second level and blocked downfield. 

Tyre Phillips was back and he played okay, though he did give up a sack on a stupid mistake that Collinsworth called him out on. Still, I feel much more comfortable with him in there than I do Fluker, who had multiple holding penalties because he has no clue what he's doing on the outside.

I was also really impressed with our new CBs. Tramon Williams and Davontae Harris both stepped up, and Harris' gunner play was excellent."
"G-ro's biggest mistake in this game was calling multiple runs on first down, especially in the second half. That put the ravens behind the mark on down and distance which has happened all yr. It allowed the steelers to hunt on 2nd + 3rd and long. 

Mcsorely was helped by being down a lot and having to run 2 minute, effectively removing the first down run from the game plan. It also helped that the steelers were playing prevent & rushing to contain but hey... That pass to Hollywood was nice. That pass has also been there for the offense all year. Lamar just needs to take advantage.

Wink... Everyone is saying that wink called a brilliant game but I see it a bit differently. Yes, he called a great game. However, he did so because he was forced to. No practice=no installs. Combined with the fact that over half of our starting DL was missing, wink had to call a more vanilla game. They didn't blitz as much as they normally do which actually helped! 

Our defense put up one of its best performances of the season despite having a bunch of key guys out because of vanilla play calling making everything simple. Maybe the ravens should continue to do that when they get their big guns back.

Its just funny to me. Both sides of the ball looked way better when the co-ordinators were forced to coach outside of their tendencies. Limited blitzing on D & 2 minute offense on O...."
"they ran justice bc he had the hot hand and was more effective. gus had 9 carries for 10 yards bc the line couldn’t block anything inside the tackles. the only good runs were midline inverted veer type options w rg3 or justice going outside. it was just what was working, and in a game w a backup QB you have to take advantage of what they give you."
"I still don't get the calls to fire Roman. Like if we call 40 passes for RG3 we would win the game or something. 

Dude had a functional run game going against arguably the best D in the league with 2nd or 3rd stringers at basically every position. 

I guess people just assume the run game will stay the same and the passing game will improve if we fire Roman?

I feel like ""Hey asshole it's me your boss, call more first down passes"" would do us a lot of good, but I'm not ready to fire our OC who helped Lamar win MVP based on his performance with this roster. I just don't trust James Urban or whoever to be an upgrade."
"I don’t agree that we are nothing without Lamar.

We are les dynamic sure. The announcers put it well, RG3 is the same player as Lamar but Lamar is Faster. He adds an element that can take off and gain yards when he shouldn’t be able to. But  even look at RG3s ability to get first downs at times.

Lamars biggest problem is playing from behind, and no it’s not a team thing, if the exact same game happened I don’t think he hits that TD to Brown and puts us within a score. Lamar really needs to find himself"
""
"I was so confused. They measure it, it's short, yet they still give a first down. And then they review it as if to give the appearance that they are trying to ensure the integrity of the game. Shouldn't they have gotten out an index card like the other year? 
It's not so much bad calls that get me riled up, it's the gross inconsistencies of the referees regarding holding, PI, clock management, personal fouls, and ball spotting. As big as the NFL is, all referees should be full time. It's their job to enforce the rules then they should know the rules up down forward and backward and have consistent interpretations of the rules for every game"
"I *really fucking hate* pulling the ref card after losses cause it happens to literally every single team in sports, but like, man, come on, fuck me."
So no one going to talk about that one play where Claypool caught the ball and dude fell clearly both knees hit the floor one of our guys touched him and he got up and ran for an extra 5 yards or something and the refs called it a first down?
"Wr1 Allen Robinson (easily worth 14m)

yeah i stopped reading when you said doofernay and said we’re paying a WR 3 10M
Doofernay
Mike Williams would be a much better option than Robinson or Gallup
"Willie Snead and Hollywood on the field at the same time is not good. Hollywood is a slot receiver. He should honestly just be the #3 receiver. Truth is, all our WR's are slot receivers. We don't have a #2 caliber WR."
"It's going to be the exact same group minus Dez, plus a mid round rookie or other late career possession guy. We won't have money, and even if we didn't we don't spend it on WRs."
"I'd rather look at DeVonte Smith or Rashod Bateman in the draft and use the money to re sign Yannick. As much as I would love Allen Robinson I think the Texans go super hard after him, they have no 1st and  2nd round draft picks have lost Hopkins and now Fuller is a FA.

&#x200B;

If we do go after a wr in FA, I think it will be someone slightly  cheaper  like Corey Davis."
"Ravens have only 40 players sign through next year and not enough money to sign even one of these free agent WR. 

Why would they want to come here anyway? The scheme we use sucks for WRs"
Nah we're gonna overpay Juju instead
"Dude - I see your name attached to crazy posts every day now. Gallup as a receiver 3 at 10 mil??? And we sign him and Robinson. You’re just seeing FA names on wiki and grabbing at them like candy. 

Doofernay? Out of the young guys, he’s one of the most promising! 

Get outta here man. 

Edit: I didn’t even see the trade Boykin LOL. Trade a guy who would sit on 80% of the leagues PS."
"The defensive game plan with a depleted DL almost won us a game that we had no business winning on paper.  Plus, props to Ellis and Washington who held their own in the trenches."
I’m proud of the team. No exceptions. Really liked Colon-Castillo who adds some solid depth at C. Decent snaps and made some good blocks too
"I never thought the day would come that I’d say this, but it made me so happy to see him rush 3. 

Blitzing the Steelers is suicide. Ben throws the ball so fast, I thought our defensive approach was exactly how you defend them."
"Wink was a mastermind out there. Some of our blitz plays worked so, so well. Our DBs were in a position to make plays every time. We bought into the bend dont break defence, which we've always been known to do when our backs are against the walls, and for the most part it worked. Wasn't until Jimmy Smith & Peters were off the field that they got a passing TD.

Wink is amazing. I hope we're able to keep him for years to come."
"Wink killed it. He’s done a great job and deserves the recognition. 

Also, new players stepped up big time. Soooo proud. Honestly we should rethink the starting lineup cuz tbh that squad played with more heart than I’ve seen in a lot of this season. They were playing with real focus and grit and it showed."
""
"Honestly NFL needs a ref who watches from the TV camera. Sometimes you wonder if the officials even have their eyes open or if they just got lazy and didn't feel like throwing a flag. But the integrity of the game starts to deteriorate when you have multiple instances like this where something egregious gets missed just because the officials don't see it. I'm a soccer ref so I get it that officials just miss things sometimes because you can't have your eyes everywhere at once. But for the sake of the fans, allow a TV ref to radio in to the field guys for things like this that all of America can see but the zebras on the field can't because their view is blocked or because the game is moving too fast"
[Duh](https://imgur.com/a/Um3E8N7)
"Seems like another relevant non-call by the officials to miss this clear false start on the critical third-down conversion by the Steelers on their final drive.

"Countless people genuinely believe we will not be making the playoffs this year.

C'mon man! Four of our final five games are against teams with losing records. Plus, I believe we can honestly beat Cleveland. That puts us at 11-5, and at worst, 10-6. Surely that will be good enough.

A lot of these other contenders have to play each other. Raiders play the Dolphins for example so somebody is losing there. Indy probably ends the year at 10-6 and we have tiebreaker. Plus, the stretch gets hard for teams like the Dolphins and Patriots.

I guess what I'm asking is, is this just more anti-Baltimore narrative and hate, or is there something alarming that I'm not seeing? Please let me know if I'm blind to something."
"I know since that tweet a lot of us have hated him and he deserves most of it, but at the end of the day he's a Raven and I obviously won't him to do well. The fact that he got a touchdown and a quite difficult one at that really does make me happy and reassures that he isn't a complete bust. I honestly think it's mostly the system that has fucked him. I hope things get better for us next season, most notably our passing game."
I hope we use him more going forward. With Lamar it seems like we only put Hollywood on go routes which just doesnt work. I gasped when he ran a slant yesterday
Hollywood is the best route runner we have. It’s kind of sad he’s stuck in a run first offense with Roman’s passing schemes.
That move to put Minkah on skates was amazing. We need to get him some passes in the open field
"He's definitely not a bust. There are a lot of things that have contributed to his lack of production:

The scheme, his size, bad throws from Lamar, dropped balls, the fact that we're generally a run first team, bad oline play, and not having more receiving threats to take some of the attention away.

I think most of this will improve as our offense is very young, including the oline. Browns size has to come up, the dude is just tiny. His routes get fucked up way too much by contact, which has hurt timing quite a bit. I think this is his number one issue. If he puts on another 20 pounds of muscle in the offseason, year 3 will be his breakout year. There's just too many things off with out offense this year to place so much blame on him.

I'm honestly not worried about him. I'm more worried that we'll give up on him prematurely, and he'll go light it up for another team."
"Hollywood will only do well if there is a strong #1 on the other side. At this point, he cannot be the #1 receiver on this team. He either gets jammed at the line or muscled off the route too easily. 

I really hope the guy does well and I still have faith in him but he won’t reach the level of expectations unless we bring someone else in."
That shifty juke he used on Minkah was awesome. Thats what I want to see more of from him
Honestly that was just terrible defending. Should have been a 10-15 yard gain max but the steelers DBs completely whiffed on tackles. He’s not out of the doghouse for me
"Hollywood is fast but Roman’s routes suck. His small size is an issue that prevents him from competing for jump passes but he’s not a terrible player. It’s not that he’s awful, he’s just not being used properly. Lamar also has a tendency to overthrow deep passes. 

Lack of talent isn’t really our issue, it’s not using what we have efficiently. We do need better receivers tho."
"Yesterday, this team had every reason to throw in the towel. Ten days of no practice, missing 10 starters including the reigning league MVP, calling up ten practice squad players, and traveling the day of the game to an undefeated division rival. They could have given up and focused on the Cowboys.

They didn’t.

They played their asses off and almost came away with a win. Harbaugh may be frustrating at times, but if there’s one thing that’s obvious after this game it’s that he certainly hasn’t lost his locker room. They came to win yesterday. They came up short, but man what an effort.

If Brandon Williams doesn’t get hurt against New England they probably win that game. Wink made the right adjustments at halftime, but unfortunately Belichick is too good a coach to let an injury like that go unexploited immediately. Pats took a decent lead early, and there’s no coming back in a torrential downpour. A tough break.

They should have beaten the Steelers the first time around. That’s the game that really hurts, because they had a good lead and they shot themselves in the foot with turnovers and penalties. That said, I feel very confident in saying at this point that the Steelers are a very beatable team. In fact, they might lose to the Bills and the Colts down the stretch and KC might take the 1 seed away from them.

As always, the Titans are a tough matchup for them. The Titans are good. But even in that game they were still missing Williams and Campbell and it took overtime for Tennessee to beat them. And KC I still think was the result of poor game planning on the part of Wink, though it’s the only game all year in which the Ravens were clearly overmatched. So what’s my point in all this?

The Ravens are better than their 6-5 record and the rest of the league doesn’t see it. They’ll be playing every game here on out like it’s a playoff game and they have the easiest remaining schedule in football. Last season they peaked at the wrong time. This year is about meeting the challenges handed to them. And they will answer. See y’all in the playoffs.

Tl;dr: Fuck the Steelers."
"> Tl;dr: Fuck the Steelers

Here here

That said, while we COULD win out, I don’t feel great right now. The defense played well yesterday and yes the offense showed signs of life, but I just don’t have a lot of confidence right now. We simply have to many issues given the various injuries, plus who knows how the folks coming back from COVID will be. I simply think it’s to early to know what we might do. We could win out, but if we miss the playoffs I won’t be shocked."
""
The Non-Call on that Delay of Game had me yelling at my TV like a degenerate gambling father.
"Run, don’t walk, to the sports book to take WFT +9.5 over Steelers this week. Or +370"
"Meh. 50 seconds and no timeouts, 4th and inches. I'm pretty sure they could seal the game right then and there anyways. The real bullshit call was the first half missed delay of game. That right there would've easily won us the game."
"At the same time as the Steelers are consistently just eeking out wins, it feels that most of our losses are by by thin margins and/or we collapse late in the game. It’s so frustrating because we are pretty closely matched, but our records make it seem other wise."
There's no doubt that they're the worst 11-0 team ever. They still have to play the Chiefs which could very well allow the Chiefs to leapfrog them in the standings. Give us this team again in the playoffs when we're at full strength and we'll see how it plays out.
So what you’re saying is... the Steelers are overrated trash and will lose in the first round? I couldn’t agree more!
"You guys seriously need to let that go. We played almost the same schedule. And by the end of the regular it'll be the same except 2 teams. And you're including the Ravens in that ""cake walk talk"" too. So disrespectful."
*Jeff Driskel led Broncos
Holy shit their schedule is beyond easy
Steelers only have 1 quality win and that’s against Tennessee
This is just cringe they are 11-0 and beat us twice. If they are so terrible wtf does that make our team. Dont be sore losers
"I’ll say they don’t really pass the eye test in terms of “do they REALLY scare me?” But they did win all their games so far. They don’t make their schedule. I think a couple teams look better than they are, but let’s not pretend they aren’t a top 5 team regardless of record/schedule."
"Do people really hate the Steelers so much that they can’t accept the fact that they’re a good team.  I don’t care who they played or how they did it, they’re fucking 11-0.  Get over it"
"this is really petty, I could do this for literally anyone's schedule and come out with the same result :L"
"RGIII and McSorley deserve a lot of credit for stepping to the plate yesterday, and I know we were playing with a bunch of back-ups, but I really feel luckier than ever that we have Lamar under center. There's such a glaring difference in decision making and pressure awareness. He really is able to create something from nothing, and I always feel like a Lamar-led offense is able to move the chains (albeit not as well as last year).

In Llama we trust"
"Man I'm sorry to dogpile on RG3, but he ain't it. 

I think we can let him go after this season and go with Trace as our BACKUP."
I don’t know why anyone would take the reigning MVP for granted...... the team is literally built around the guy
"Nah they still will.

If anything the people who,  unironically,  , want McSorely to start have been empowered."
"People that understand the sport and this team do not take him for granted. Those who do just don’t understand the sport, or just don’t like the ravens. It’s simple as that."
"I hate to be that guy but the TD McSorley threw wasn't really a byproduct of a play he made. The throw wasn't particularly great the corner was overly aggressive and Hollywood did most of the heavy lifting...

He even threw a pass that should have been picked.

I don't know why so many people - other than backup QB novelty - think he ""looked good""."
Trace does a good job and i believe he will start somewhere at some point. Just not us as long as we have a healthy Lamar.
That QB trap that RGIII ran might have gone for at least 50(maybe even a TD) with Lamar. Same with that bootleg on 2nd & 1.
Do we know if he will be back by the cowboys game?
So your saying a starter is better than the back-ups.  Riveting
"Is this ever going to end?  Multiple special teams penalties on Levine, illegal formations, corners playing too handsy, etc.  this is getting disgusting at this point."
This is probably the only time all season I can kind of understand that we got flagged. Still not acceptable but at least it was off the back of no practice for like 2 weeks. We need to be more disciplined
Illegal formation is unreal. Like we have to be on pace for an NFL record 11games in. Mind blowing
A lot is honestly referee bias.  No coincidence that Ravens opponents have the least amount of penalties this season.  Ravens are 32 in the league with their opponents only being flagged a little over 4 times a game.   When is the last time you’ve seen our opponent flagged for a hold.  Last night was another prime example.
Doesn't help that the refs throw the flag as soon as the ball leaves the QB's hand everytime anyone takes a deep shot against Marlon.
Fluker holds every single game.
"While I agree that PI call was stupid, so was that roughing the passer the Steelers got. Refs need to be paid full time by the nfl so they can take all year to practice and master their craft. The delay of game non call was worse then the PI call imo. 

The illegal formation shit is all on us. Either Greg Roman is missing something or the offense is not understanding where they are supposed to be. Needs to be fixed."
"Friendly Bills fan here.

I was doing some research after cheering for you guys last night, and found the interesting thing that separates you guys from us on offence given our penalty issues (1 and 2 at 65 and 66 yards per game). It's the fact that your ground and pound scheme means that your plays are at a far higher likely hood of being unable to regain the yards lost on, for example, a holding call on first down. Assuming a call back on 1st down resulting in 1st&20, you guys average 5.4 yds a play, meaning, on average, in three plays you can claw back to a 4th&4. The Bills passing attack gains *8.6* yds per play, meaning we can still, on average, convert from a first down holding penalty. 

I can't tell you whether it's discipline or biased officiating (or just straight up bad officiating) with you guys where I can pretty easily say it's mostly discipline with some horrible officiating mixed in for us. 

I for one hope to see you guys in the playoffs and hope y'all's coaching staff can figure out a solution to the penalties over the next few weeks."
the bogus deep ball PI penalties are the worst.
We have the second most penalty yards commited. And we have the least amount of penalties committed against us
Yeah but 36 of that was the BS call against Marlon.
Everyone blaming the refs but no one wants to blame Harbs?  Most of these penalties are really happening and they are happening week after week after week.  Eventually a coach needs to step up and fix the damn issue or discipline the players that are repeat offenders.  Harbs is trash and needs to go
"They really should have a hard look at PI calls... this is just getting ridiculous.  Just throw the ball in the general area your WR might end up,  release so fast that routes aren't even established,  and then watch the flag fly in. So guys that release the ball quickly are just playing the rules instead of the game,  Brady and now Ben are apparently masters of this ""clever use of game mechanics"" 

Just put yardage on it,  10 yards or just 5 even. Without automatic first down, none of this spot of the foul shit."
""
"Bernard Pollard still had to get [a jab in.](https://twitter.com/Crushboy31/status/1334276826890375174?s=19). He hates us so much, it's comical.


And yes, I know what he said about Hollywood, many people on this sub feel the same way. But yeah, Pollard still is an asshole"
They’ll just say that we saw what Lamar will be in 5 years in RG3.
It wasn't the Steelers-Ravens game we wanted. Anyone still saying Lamar isn't legit needs to be forcibly removed from their platform.
Facts lol
Stephen A. Had nothing good to say about the Steelers though
I love lamar has basically been in the league 3 years already and ppl still be saying this😭
"Problem is a lot of Ravens ""fans"" are already calling for McSorley to take over Lamar after seeing him throw 1 TD to Brown. I am excited for McSorley too, but come on..."
SAS 🤡
"Morning Flock. Hate losing to the Squeelers but that loss had a different feel for sure. I’d ask that you keep in mind how crazy the conditions we played are as you read my analysis. Sorry for typos. 

Offense 
1. QB-ing wasn’t great. If not for the long score with Marquise, we wouldn’t of topped 100 yards passing. It could be argued that we game planned to simply run the ball and fall back on the defense, but that doesn’t make up for the lack of passing production. RG3 royally screwed up with the pick 6. Trace looked okay (as much as a 3rd string Tik-Tok sensation can). His long score was more Marquise taking it than him. Trace could be come a decent backup, but RG3 isn’t. It’s clear we only keep him for his running prowess. 

2. The WRs were largely in effective. It’s been thoroughly discussed how this group has issues, though in this instance the game plan really wasn’t to utilize them. Scheming receivers continues to be a real problem. What kills me here is that, we have young talent who I truly believe have great upside but per tradition we fell to develop it. We need a better WR coach, and we need someone to help develop passing schemes within our offense. Whether that means getting rid of GRo or getting him better help will be something to watch. 

3. The TE group did a good job blocking overall. Wilson’s drop was critical in the loss. Fitzpatrick did make a good play on the ball, but Wilson has to hold onto that. It was a great play call, and decently place ball. 

4. The Oline is just a revolving door this year. We all know it’s flawed, but given the circumstances I thought they did ok. Pass blocking wasn’t good, constant pressures forced quick passes all game. Run blocking was up and down. They weren’t getting a push against a strong d-line. Special shout out to Castillo, dude played great almost all the way around. Skura (as much as I like the guy) is honestly our third best center at this point. 

5. Our RBs were inconsistent but played well IMO. Gus struggled to find lanes. I saw a lot of people saying this is proof Gus is likely done with us, I have to disagree. I seriously doubt he was being evaluated playing behind the line he was, against a good dline. Gus and Dobbins will likely be our backs next year. Also, the Squeelers subbed heavy personnel every time Gus came in because he is a mauler. Hill was nice, he has similar play to Dobbins. 

6. Overall the offense was what’s it’s been. We still struggle with the presnap penalties, and Fluker is a liability at any position at this point. His holding calls killed good drives. I believe if we weren’t thin on the line he’d be cut. The problems that have plagued us since the Eagles are still there, no doubt, but given the circumstance they came out with a fairly safe game plan that relied on running the ball, and playing good defense. I’ll be damned if it didn’t almost work. 

7. One more note here, turnovers have killed us against Pitt as of late. We have turned the ball over every time we’ve played them the last 4 games, 3 of which were multiple turnover games. We have to clean that up. 

Defense
8. The pass rush didn’t register a sack. Ben had a lot of time frequently, but his quick release (that Collinsworth may very well whack it to) made it hard for anyone to get home. They generated some hits and pressures but were overall underwhelming. 

9. The LBs were up and down. Queen and Fort rally to the ball quickly, but Queen still struggles with play recognition. I think he’ll be okay, but not until the game at this level slows down for him. With that being said, I know that PFF has him as a terrible player, and while I love PFF for analytics, I wouldn’t take it that far. Queen frequently rallies to the ball, even when he messes up. His tackling needs to improve. He’s a rookie in an unprecedented season, cut him some slack. For now though, he is a liability in the middle. Ferguson/Bowser have really made the most of their time lately, good to see them developing. 

10. CB play was mostly great. We needed the secondary to prevent the big play and they did. However, I don’t understand why we refuse to disrupt the timing of their wideouts. We know the plays, yet continually give them a ton of cushion. We all know Peter is largely boom or bust, but Marlo has the tools to be physical at the line. We saw it a little in the first half, but it faded throughout the game. That offense relies on the timing, if we want to beat them, we have to disrupt it. 

11. The d-line is hard to evaluate because the Squeelers don’t really have a run game. They missed tackles and failed to open up pass rush lanes. They weren’t bad per se, but they didn’t really do a ton either. 

12. The safeties mostly played well, Clark had 13 tackles, a career high. Sadly, they failed to make a play that could of changed the game on the final third down conversion. Elliot and him have been under a lot of fire, this is a position I think we need to add competition to this offseason. 

13. Overall the defense was our saving grace, can we really fault them given the circumstances? Tackling was poor, and has been for awhile now, we absolutely have to clean that up. I believe that generally falls to the LB coach or D-line coach. Tackling in this game was bad, but when you haven’t hit in, how long was it, it’s bound to be bad. Red zone D was beautiful almost
all game. They got gassed but that’s to be expected with how much they were on the field, without subs largely. 

Coaching 

14. Roman called a safe game. He clearly didn’t trust the passing game with RG3. We still can’t scheme receivers open, it’s frustrating watching all the picks/quick slants Pitt runs and wondering why we don’t even attempt those. Roman isn’t going anywhere before the season ends, but his time may very well come to an end if we don’t make the playoffs or go one and done. 

15. Wink did great IMO. That’s really all I have to say about that. 

16. Harbs deserves credit for having the team ready this week despite, checks news feed, the apocalypse. They played with guts and heart. I’m personally proud of them. On Harbs, once again I’m seeing the fire Harbs stuff start to trickle in. I won’t lie, I see some valid points. He holds onto coordinators so long, and he doesn’t have the offensive mind to correct and offense. However, he is a super bowl winning coach (you can say it was Ray or Ed or whatever but that doesn’t change the facts), extremely well respected, and beloved by this team. He isn’t a bad coach by any stretch of the imagination. Furthermore, who you gonna replace him with? Reids aren’t sitting around looking for jobs. Replacing a head coach is a huge gamble, I can’t believe the organization has seen anything out of him that they’d be willing to take that gamble. 

Notes

17. The play call to run the ball at the end of the half, IMO, doesn’t bother me terribly. However, the clock management was terrible. This is an area where Harbs has to get it together. The play call following the blatant hold by the Steelers was great, just didn’t work out. 

18. The end of the game was some of most blatant ref ball I’ve ever seen. I don’t understand how that happens. The NFL should be ashamed. 

19. Given what I was expecting, I was super proud of our guys yesterday. I saw a fire in their eyes, let’s hope we keep that fire going forward. We still have a good shot at the playoffs, but I really think we may need to win out. It’s doable, but let’s also not think it’s a guarantee. Dallas is going to be tougher than we think, they have lots of weapons, depending on who we get back it could be a challenge. We must beat Cleveland. The rest aren’t overly concerning but nothing is guaranteed. 

20. Expectations we’re high this season, and we failed to meet them. We are at worse and average team, and at best a top 10 team. When we play our best ball, we’re a force, but we just haven’t. 

21. One final note, related to us as fans more than the game itself. First, it was nice to be in a game day thread that wasn’t just “we suck” or “this team is butt cheeks.” I enjoy game day threads because I get to actually talk ball with fellow fans. This sub was super positive following a division loss, which was nice, but it went over the top a little. We still loss, moral victories don’t change our record. I get why people felt like that though, again, proud of my boys. With that being said, there’s always a few post whining that people are being positive. I get that you want to be a realist, and I’m down for that, but calling out your fellow fans for feeling good comes off patronizing, and like you just want to be “edgy” or whatever. It’s all in how you frame the conversation, this isn’t us vs them, it’s us discussing with us. 

I know that was a long one, and I look forward to discussing. Keep your heads high Flock, none of us should feel shame about that game. As always FUCK THE STEELERS."
"Do you expect the run game to stay as is if we fire Roman? 

I agree his passing concepts suck but I'm still not sure it's worth losing his run scheme which is effective against strong defenses even with the current roster. 

Maybe we just need a passing game coordinator? 

It just feels like nobody is worried about our run game getting worse post Roman when that is a very real possibility."
"I will just say, sometimes there are losses and moments that feel like catalyst or inflection points in a season. That game was one of them to me. Something about it felt like we were gonna be okay, even with the loss. 

In a way it helps us down the stretch to manage personnel too. With no preseason we had no game tape to evaluate some of this fringe talent. Today we did and they played their tails off.  

I feel optimistic. Not often after a loss. We tried the one seed thing. Didn't work. I'm ready to run the gauntlet in Tennessee, in Pitt, in KC to get to the Superbowl to beat the Giants. 

Let's. Fucking. Go."
Who among you can do a deep dive into the Ravens WR coaches? Honestly has it been the guy (or crew) for the last 12 years that was just cloned from the early 2000's? Why has this team been cursed with bad WR play?
"Not in as much detail as most posts in this thread, and I'm aware ""too many cooks spoil the broth"" (you might have an American alternative). But I'd like to see Hill get more carries going forward."

"If we want to meet the #2 Steelers in the playoffs as the #7 seed:

- we need to go 10-6, the colts to not go above 10-6 and the raiders to go 9-7 max. 

- the chiefs must win out and go 15-1 

- the Steelers need to lose 2 games, preferably to the Bills and Browns.

Aren’t the bills the only real team that remain on their schedule? They’d have to lose 2 of their remaining (and don’t we need them to beat brownies)?
I hate doing this. There is to many variables this early in the game to be worrying about it. Let’s make the post season and see what happens. It is likely they will get a bye and games will work out however they workout
Steelers - Titans - Chiefs would be the ultimate redemption arc playoff run
"Man, it's been a hot minute since I had to scoreboard watch."
"The AFC north gonna get blasted in the playoffs. The entire conference is being propped up by a truly garbage schedule. The Ravens by virtue of when they played their toughest games are probably the most properly rated team. 

Cleveland played 4 teams with a winning record all year and lost three by a combined 71 points. If you take out wins over each other, the entire AFC North has three victories over +.500 teams."
It would be really funny to watch the Steelers get throttled at home in the playoffs by the Browns.
"As a Steelers fan, I would love this scenario. The three game sweep is so funny to see, I almost want us to lose so I can watch it happen"
"A covid-decimated team held their own, but ultimately fell to the Steelers.  The Cowboys loom on the horizon.  Can the good guys return to winning?

This got a chuckle out of me

I came too close to almost eating the onion on this one lol
this season is so stupid i almost believed it
You finally made me buy coins you bastard and on a Ravens sub no less. I'm a Steelers fan here and I was really looking forward to this match up.
Love the onion 😂
I laughed
That'll teach 'em
Lmao gotta love the onion
"Good game guys, I wish both of us had all of our players. Looking forward to next years games. -Steelers fan"
"Ravens fan for life here. In all seriousness, I hope the only thing the Steelers took home was a win. Game should have been canceled. The risk was not worth it. People dying from this shit!!"
Haha.
Oof I was so close to eating the onion.
You get a hug!

In other news The Football team manages to become the first team to lose a game against a team with no players.
They got off easy. Should have been a first and a second.
6-5😂😂😂
Fake news much?
"Time to pay the man, guys stepped up hugged last few games and really looks like he’s developing this year."
"He’s improved. But throwing out “pay the man” is a little too much. If he continues the way he is and finishes the season out well, we shall see."
"Give him the decosta special, 3 years at 6 mil or so a year"
"> Time to pay the man 

Pay him as in extend him? Sure. But I wouldn't pay him much. He played well last night, but I'd like to see a little more, and for more than just one season.

I think we try and keep him over Judon, but I certainly wouldn't be breaking the bank. We still need to extend Yannick."
"Has Bowser notably improved as a pass rusher this season? Genuine question. 

I remember seeing earlier in the season he's made strides in run support but was curious about his pass rushing numbers."
Bowser has always done pretty well IMO we have other locks we need to concern ourself with first but I’m sure this off-season he will get a good offering
There's definitely a role for him on the defense going forward even if its not as an Edge rusher. His versatility is an asset.
"My question would be what role does he have early downs and on 3rd down.  I don't think he is a great pass rusher, so on 3rd down he'd have to cover TEs and RBs.  Is that a valuable position on our defense, or can Fort/Queen do that?  

I think he would be a very good 4-3 Will, but that position doesn't really translate great to our D."
King Koopa Szn 🙌🏽🔥
"Depends on what he wants.  Not sure he is playing like a second rounder right now and this is the best he has been.   Certainly would like to see him stay, but if you're talking big contract, I'm not there."
He should get a 1 year deal with a 2nd year option
3/30 would be perfect.
Every year I swear to god it’s a new “ X linebacker has balled out for a few games we should pay them” and it barely ever works out for us. We still don’t have an X factor edge that’s worth paying big money.
I'm all for him becoming great because I'm not sure there will ever be a better name to have on a jersey
"I love me some King Koopa and I'd be all for bringing him back on a mid-tier vet contract, but I'm pretty sure Ferguson is gonna take over the SAM LB spot next year while we resign Ngakoue as the RUSH LB."
Pay him for what? How many sacks does he have?
"Yeah, no. He’s not good."
""
Why? For G-Ro to never use them?
"Show it to Marquis - he can learn a lot about reaching for a ball, not worrying about the ground, and having some heart."
"Decosta is doing his job right, it’s G-Ro who still uses the three tight end package instead of coming up with WR plays"
"We were historically terrible in November of this year. That is usually our best month. Before this season  we had owned this month during the John Harbaugh era, going 36-13 in November since 2008, including league-best 22-4 mark at home([source](https://twitter.com/jamisonhensley/status/1322918939303809033)). This year? We only won one game(keep in mind yesterdays game was supposed to be played in November, but still). What's even more crazy is that we went undefeated in October....which is our historically worse month. 

From 2008-2018 we were 17-25 in October. Last year we went 3-0(and we did so again this year) and just when you think we were going to round the corner and start playing well.....November happens and boom....shit hits the fan([second source](https://twitter.com/jamisonhensley/status/1190267977008062464))"
"Yea that is odd, probably the Greg Roman effect"
""
"3 of our 5 losses realistically should have been wins. This is the one major reason I am holding hope in this team. If we clean up some of these ridiculous penalties, and other mental miscues, we could be very good."
"They didn't allow Harbaugh close enough to observe the spotting of the ball during the 4th down play. Ravens are entitled to have the game replayed, at a neutral site, with all of our players."
One thing for damn sure is the Ravens are the last fucking team the Steelers want to meet in the playoffs.
"If you counted the points we scored and ignored the others, you'll see it was a shutout."
STOP THE STEAL(ers)
This is fucking hilarious.
"Isn’t it odd how when they keep counting the points, they all come largely in their favor? 🤔"
This sub is way more fun than the Steelers. Just like your qb.
So true!

"Didnt break my heart, the refs did that."
""
"Sorry if this has already been posted, but my friend at Penn State made me aware of this song’s existence after his touchdown yesterday"
"I was curious if we actually have been getting hosed by the refs as badly as it seems this year, so I went to nflpenalties.com to look at the numbers. 

The Ravens are: 

 - 5th in penalties against with 72, behind KC, CAR, AZ, and BUF

- 2nd in penalty yards against with 715 (BUF #1 with 726)

Sucks right? Clearly there are some discipline issues and the illegal formation penalties on offense can be attributed exclusively to coaching. But this is where it gets absolutely infuriating...

In Beneficial penalties (penalties against opponents) the Ravens are:

- Tied for dead last with HOU, with only 47 beneficial calls. None of the other 4 teams above us in penalties against are even in the top half for least beneficial calls, with the next closest being Buffalo with 63 beneficial calls. 

- Dead last in benficiary yards with 382. The Saints, with 396, are the only other team below 400 yards of beneficial penalties. 

Put it all together, and our penalty differential is a league worst -25. The next closest team is NO and BUF at -14, and then no one else is below -11. The difference between us and 2nd place is the same as the difference between BUF/NO in 2nd and the Browns at 14th. 

In addition, we are dead last in net penalty yards with -333, with only the Saints anywhere near us at -316. The next lowest team is -176(!!!). There is no logical explanation for why us and NO are so much worse off than everyone else in that category. 

TL:DR; The refs fucking suck, and we are by far the most affected team this year (save for maybe NO, but we all know the refs hate Sean Peyton) Go to the site above (nflpenalties.com) and sort by “net count” as well as “net yards” to see what I’m getting at. 

This post wasn’t made to sound whiny or bitchy, but it’s kind of hard not to after looking at the stats lol"
It anyone is wondering the steelers are first in the nfl in net penalty yards compared to our dead last
I remember seeing someone speculating on Twitter a few weeks back that the endless string of bad calls/non-calls against us was the refs' way of getting back at Harbaugh for yelling at that guy in the KC game. Don't think it's actually happening but it would certainly explain a lot.
"One of the worst things in the officiating community is how refs will get together before the game to go over what each team is known for or has a reputation for. For example, in soccer, if you know a team is known for being a little too aggressive, then you can try and get it under control by calling smaller fouls early on to send the players the message that it won't be tolerated. 
However, this leads to a bias. You are essentially looking for opportunities to call fouls which will lead to more fouls being called, ones that in other games you would either choose to not call or you just wouldn't see because you're not micro managing the players. 
In football, and for the Ravens, this could mean the officials saying this team likes to use weird formations so make sure you are looking extra close at their formations. Or, their corners like to play physical so if it looks like pi then it probably is. Things like that where you have a preconceived notion going into it, and then you see something that reminds you of it and it confirms your bias. Could lead to lots of extra penalties"
"I think the most damning is the lack of (still zero) DPI and offensive holding against our opponents. Sure we don't take a lot of prayer shots that lead to DPI, but there's been so many cases of, at a minimum, illegal contact that are getting intentionally ignored. Watt shoving Hollywood 10 yds downfield? No problem. Humphrey hand fighting with Crypool downfield? DPI.

The amount of absurdly obvious holds our opponents get away with, specifically in high leverage plays that have serious impact on the outcome of the game, is just maddening. 

Steelers holding in the end zone? No safety, just a first down. Pats with 2 blatant holds on the Burkhead run that got them off their own goaline and jump started a back breaking drive? No problem, fuck you Baltimore!

Fluker exists on the field? HOLDING, BALTIMORE. Although Fluker does suck and he definitely does hold tf out of people, but if we're not getting away with it then neither should our opponents."
CNN can’t say these are baseless claims! We have the data
"I'll buy that we're the worst in penalties against without a conspiracy, why not. We play aggressive on defense in an offense-oriented league, make some formation mistakes on offense constantly, etc. 

As for penalties in favor, if it smells like a pig, dresses like a pig, sounds like a pig, it's a pig. There is literally no way on earth other teams, when they play us, all magically play the most fundamentally sound game of their lives."

So I recently took a milestone in sobriety. At the meeting, my friend, who's a steelers fan, spoke about how when he first met me. At the time, I had around 2 years in, and he had 6. He stops and goes ""interesting... What else have I celebrated 6 of, that you've only celebrated 2 of?"" As we're in Canada, this reference to Super Bowl wins went over the heads of everyone else, but got quite the colorful response from me. It was a great dig, and even though it's the Squeelers I have to respect such a good, super specific burn"
Hahaha well played. And congrats on your milestone! That’s amazing.
"Fellow Canadian here, living in an area with wayy too many steelers fans. Some Americans may have trouble understanding, but you'll go crazy around here if you aren't able to differentiate the person from the fan. I'd love to be a part of a community where the vast majority of people heavily cheer for the same team. Everything is a pissing contest up here from standard sports to the Olympics - everyone would rather argue about how ""their team/country"" is better than just celebrate an event.

Congrats on the milestone though! Hope your friends took you for a drink to celebrate ;)"

I think what I like most about Fruit Punch is like the whole team is getting in on it now and it's basically just stand the guy up and beat the shit out of the ball until the whistle blows.
If we played the steelers 3 times a year in the regular season he would probably have 9 by now cause marlon always fucks juju with the punch outs and not to mention the ones that went out of bounds against the steelers and eagles
"Surely you mean most in a season, not all time?"
Should’ve put in a single season in the title. He’s still 45 shy of Robert Mathis for career total.

"I could see it happening especially if the Cowboys stick with Zeke as the starter he should get one or two there, and then against the Bengals it’ll happen once."
"Only problem is when they all focus on trying to punch the ball out instead of tackling, meanwhile the ball carrier rumbles forward for another 6 yards"
Peanut Tillman was the master at that.
Do the ones that the D doesn’t recover count?
im pretty sure tillman has way more ff than marlon. are you saying most in a season?
Too bad we don't play Juju anymore
He made some great punches yesterday.
So 5 away from having the all time record for himself?
Correction I meant tied most all time in a single season thank you to the users who corrected me
DPOY of the year in my book
"Wait are you serious? This is fucking insane...

Edit: nvm it’s most in a season. Which makes sense imo"
"Looking at most of our receivers. Hollywood, Snead, Duv, Proche and Dez. All but one of them are dudes meant to be in the slot. Very strange team building.

I honestly think we need to get at least 2 new WR's who can handle the outside.

The amount of fixing this is gonna take..."
Boykin is not an outside receiver. He never uses his size to his advantage
"Try to get an outside WR in AR in FA would be best scenario, but this team time and time again rather get an aging WR. I’m convinced this coaching group will never develop a Star WR, we either draft a Rookie WR who is already at an elite level or attack free agency. Devin Duvernay is great, he has speed, he’s physical unlike Hollywood. But they just can’t develop nor utilize WRs. Even when Joe was QB, there wasn’t a WR who was drafted and turned out to be a star. With the exception of Torrey Smith, he wasn’t a star but he was good."
"Unless I missed it, did Dez do ANYTHING at Pitt?"
"It’s going to be hard to change our WR misfortunes until we get better at evaluating and developing them. You can’t just keep putting band-aids on the issue by signing well known free agents, although that does help. 

We need to hit on the WR position. I think we did better this year with Duv and Proche but it’s not enough."
Dez can play outside
"Hollywood is not a slot receiver. I get that his speed and the fact that he is smaller makes him a fit for slot, but he's just too small. He would get fucking destroyed. Duvernay and Snead should be our slot guys. If Hollywood can put on 20 more pounds of muscle, put him in the slot."
"Which I thought would work well with what we were building. We were adding a bunch of speedy and shifty receivers who we could spread out and kill it in the short passing game (playing to Lamar’s strength/ or weakness in throwing outside the numbers). It would be a great compliment to the run game we had. In theory, it seemed like it would work, kind of like the Patriots old offense (a bunch of those type of WRs paired with receiving TEs).

The problem was we just didn’t run that offense this year. It seems like we’re just running plays with no sequencing, we don’t set anything up, we don’t work our pass game off our run game, nothing."
Duv could play on the outside if he just improves his route running progressions and variety of routes.  Duv has the size and speed to do it.
Stretch zone offense is the next step up for Lamar. I'm going to guess that's the next direction.  Turns out Hollywood Brown is just another Travon Austin.
"I’ve noticed we’ve got a lot of international fans here, and I was wondering what folks thought."
Why do new accounts post absolute rubbish in this sub.
Thought about what?
"So i keep seeing people calling Hollywood a blazing speedster. Still waiting for that speed to show up

Edit: Looks like people are getting a little defensive of Hollywood a couple points

1. Im rooting for the guy to be a great player but he wont get any faster and will have to do it as a route running specialist. 

2. Hes not that fast get over it. Thats not a hot take just the objective truth. He lost speed after his foot injury and hasn't regained it. To draft a desean Jackson type with a 1st rnd pick without top end speed isnt a great pick. As someone else said on the thread Daniel jones had reached a higher top speed than hollywood lol. Last week he couldn't seperate from tj watt"
"He didn't exactly look slow on Tuesday when he scored a 70yd TD, but I get it - it's fashionable to shit on Hollywood.

Edit: a word"
Ahh.. never change Baltimore..
"I agree that he didn’t look super fast on that play, but I think we need to give him the benefit of the drought on this play because he scored. He may have been able to run faster but it would have been harder to make that double move he did to escape Minkah, he may have seen that Minkah had a advantageous angle on him and so slowed down a bit to be able to put Minkah in a bad position. But yeah I would also like to see a play in which he just burns everyone else on the field."
"People forget the norm is for WRs to take a few years to  fully develop in the league. 

Freaks like DK, AJ and Terry Mc are not the norm. 

I would bet if you put Brown in another offense with more passing weapons he would look better. 

It is just easy to shit on him now which is kinda BS."
You forgot the /s
"He’s not that fast? No he is, he isn’t used properly."
Didnt he hit like 19mph last game?
That extra weight he put on has made him look a bit slower.
Looks like he lost it. Dude didn't look fast on the steeler TD.
Was taking to another fan on twitter (jasonnyboy) and made a point that i hadn’t thought about but what if we move Brown to the slot & put Dez & Boykin out wide?
I'm not worried about the speed but I don't see any elusiveness. he was programmed to fall down last year during his lisfranc recovery and he hasn't kicked that habit this year.
Hollywood would be an amazing receiver if they used a nerf football.
"He is fast though, you are watching the nfl right?"
"It really would've been nice to see him open it up and beat all the angles down the sideline on that long TD instead of having to make a move back into the field to score. Apparently, he didn't even crack 20mph according to the next gen stats. There are plenty of guys that would break 22-23mph with that much open space, so not sure if he felt he didn't need to or if he is actually lacking the next gear that he's had in the past. I'm hoping he just went as fast as he needed to and has more in the tank"
Why do they call Hollywood cause he’s from Florida?

Fuck the Steelers.
"Kaboly is a dumb dumb and I refuse to believe otherwise.

The guy always has really bad takes."
Right now this team is living in our head rent-free.
"Ok, there's some important context missing from this title, which I'd like to explain here...

During a normal NFL season, every team gets at least one stretch of their schedule where they play 3 games in 12 days. This plays out as a Sunday- Sunday-Thursday stint. However, it's important to note that this 3 game stretch is always followed by a 10 day layoff before the next game, usually referred to as the 'mini-bye'. So, while it's true that every team faces this situation at least once per season (some twice), they always get a mini bye afterward to recuperate. Teams also know about it in advance, which helps with planning.

In the Steelers' situation, things ended up happening in reverse. If the game had been played on Thanksgiving as originally scheduled, that would have been their 3rd game in 12 days and followed by the expected 10 day layoff. However, with the game being postponed, that changed how this played out. Had the game been played on Sunday, it would have just been like a typical game week and you wouldn't be seeing these complaints. When the game was postponed to Wednesday, it created a scenario where the team would play 3 games in 12 days, except they would not get the 10 day layoff afterward that typically comes with it. Now, this would not have been a problem if the Steelers had known about the delay in advance, as they could have used the extra days on the front end as a mini bye. Unfortunately, due to the game being pushed back to Sunday first instead of immediately to Tuesday or Wednesday, Pittsburgh had to assume they were playing and practice as normal, rather than rest. 

This may not seem like a big deal, but these periods of rest are EXTREMELY important for professional football players, due to the abuse their bodies endure in games. Pittsburgh was not only not afforded that rest in this scenario, they were also not afforded it when the Titans game was moved (since it happened so late in the week)

I know this is long winded, I just felt it was important to explain that this is not the same as what normally happens with 3 game stretches, and implying they are equal is deliberately misleading.

">  do you think its appropriate to have Lamar Jackson to continue to play quarterback or to switch to halfback completely?

Oh man. Another surface level person who thinks they've figured it all out just because we're not going 14-2 this year. 

How quickly people turn on a player that we want to develop. If this is a real take, you need to study everything that made last year a success and compare it to this year. It's not even close to ""They've figured Lamar out"". Bandwagon fans man."
"I think you’re onto something here. Let’s put Lamar at HB and see how he gets on? I reckon we swap him with Ingram and he can play QB. He’s had two direct snaps this year, but that should be okay. He fumbled one but we all make mistakes."

"Serious question. If the starter and backup qb go down during a game, is Sam next in line to play qb?

"I've not been on the fire Roman train until that interception against the Steelers. Why?

It was the same fucking play as the last pick 6 against the Steelers. Not only that, it was Proche's only snap of the game. In fact, his only snap against Pittsburgh last time, was again, the same fucking play. Oh, and guess what, Proche's ONLY snap against the Titans... SAME PLAY. ROMAN WTF. STOP RUNNING THE SAME PLAY, WITH THE SAME RECEIVER, IN THE SAME SITUATION, 3RD AND 5 ISH YOU FUCKING PREDICTABLE CUNT......

But I digress. Roman needs to go, his scheme is that of a 5 year old. His play calling is even worse. Honestly, I'm not opposed of firing him right now. 

I don't really know who we should hire, but I wouldn't hire a RB coach to be offensive coordinator when our issues are in the passing game."
"**In the NFL**

* **Mike McDaniels** (Niners run game cooordinator)
*  **Darrell Bevell** ( Former Seahawks offensive coordinator/current Lions interim HC)
* **Tom Clements** ( former Packers offensive coordinator/ current Cardinals passing coordinator)

**Kevin Wilson** (current Ohio St offensive coordinator/TE coach, former Indiana HC)"
"I don't know enough about current college coaches to suggest any reasonable options there (no, Lincoln Riley will not leave Oklahoma to be our OC) but from the ranks of NFL offensive assistants some options could be:

* Mike McDaniel (49ers run game coordinator)

* Mike LaFleur (49ers pass game coordinator)

* Harold Goodwin (Buccaneers OL coach/run game coordinator)

* Mike Kafka (Chiefs passing game coordinator)

* Dave Canales (Seahawks passing game coordinator)"
"Not necessarily who I want, but...

If Doug Pederson gets fired by the Eagles, I could see him coming here. He and Harbaugh have that Andy Reid connection from their days with the Eagles, even if there's a degree of separation between the two. I know they did joint practices in training camp before, so there's definitely a connection there. And we love to bring in re-treads at OC. Seems like a Harbaugh move, similar to when he brought in former Eagles OC Mornhinweg."
"Find me a 39 year old coach at a D3 college whose RBs average like 18 yards a rush. 

We all know there’s this tendency for coaches to get coaching jobs because they’re coaches so they must know how to coach. The NFL is the ultimate meritocracy, but coaching is an old boys club. 

My sense is that the Kyle Shanahans and Sean McVays aren’t that uncommon. They’re smart, creative guys who understand the game and innovate on it because they’re not attached to how things have always been done, but they’re not the only ones. They’re just the only ones who managed to get into a position to prove that to us. I think the barriers to entry for NFL coaching are so tremendous for someone who doesn’t have connections that there must be an absolute goldmine out there, if only you can find it. 

I’d love to keep Roman on and launch a gigantic search to find one of those guys. I have no idea how, but I’m convinced it’s possible. We have a guy with a proven track record who’s struggling to take the next step; let’s leave him in place and bring up a pass game assistant to help him develop the pass game until we find *the guy*. Once we do, and we’re sure we’ve got it right, let’s pay him so much money that his family won’t let him leave for a HC job."
"Ryan Day @ OSU

"To the people saying we need a passing game coordinator - we have one. His name is David Culley.

If Roman goes my money is on him getting promoted. No idea if he's good or not but that's what I'd bet on."
No idea who would be available that would be perfect for Lamar. Roman had that back ground in working with QBs with ability to use their legs. Not so sure there is another NFL OC with that kind of background. I would almost want them go the college route potentially.
"Pep Hamilton from LA would be an interesting look. Experience as an OC, and he's doing great things with Herbert and the LA passing offense"
None of Harbaugh's choices should even be considered.
" I pray to god Harbaugh is smart enough to see the writing on the wall. Romans track record is well established at this point. We got what we wanted out of him and he is not a coach that can adapt.


Plus his face is so fucking punchable"
I'd like to look for a college run heavy coach with experience in mobile QBs like lamar and please this time make sure he can actually adjust instead of just doing whatever it is roman does
"This entire thread is incredibly dumb. 

Where was all the Roman hate last year? He ran the same plays?

The fact that there is a thread about firing the 2019 Assistant Coach of the Year because he couldn’t win a Wednesday afternoon football in December with 2nd and 3rd stringers without practice against an undefeated rival at their place is laughable. 

You all are “what have you done for me lately?”.  Guess what, we’re not playing up to our preseason expectations in the craziest season in memory. If it weren’t for a couple plays - on both sides of the ball - and calls by the referees, the Ravens are a 10-1 football team and none of you have anything to say about this play calling.  We have a winning record with the easiest remaining schedule in the league for crying out loud.

If being an offensive coordinator is so easy, why don’t some of you start coaching? According to this thread we have a bunch of high quality coaches here. I’m willing to bet all you Reddit Couch QBs have never coached competitive football in your life let alone have sat down with college and NFL coaches and watched film with them as they describe how detailed their thought process is. Play calling is a process and an art that is so difficult to truly master.  Sometimes shit doesn’t work out and there are off days. After reading this thread, it appears you all have been perfect day in and day out at your jobs. It’s not nearly easy as it looks, even in high school.

Moving on to these “suggestions”:
1. McDaniels - has lived in Shannahan’s shadow and has yet to call an NFL play.
2. Bevel - the Lions offense has been trash this year, and if he’s so good, why did he leave Seattle?
3. Clements - working under Kliff who ran all the same stuff at Texas Tech
4. LaFleur - we’ll play the same game as we did with McDaniels, but wait he’s got an older brother
5. Stoutland - eagles run game coordinator, lol cmon man that offense is atrocious 
6.  Getsy - best option so far but tough to look bad with Aaron Rogers
7. Dennison - if he was so good, why’d we let him go?
8. Canales - that offense is just as up and down and Russell has a completely different skill set
9. Wilson - cmon now, this is the NFL, we’re not playing Purdue and Illinois. I’m sure he’s a fine coach but not offensive coordinator at this stage. 

Roman is a proven play caller that is built to run the offense that was given to him - mobile quarterback, decent line, good RBs, and subpar receivers. Doesn’t take much to look at the Kaepernick led 49ers and/or Tyrod led Bills.
And QB Coach James Urban was Michael Vick’s guru in Philly to earn him Comeback Player of the Year in 2020.

We all agree the passing game is lacking, that’s not Greg’s fault. Why not get on DeCosta and the scouting department for continually drafting poor receiving talent? The Steelers seem to be doing just fine in that department, yet year in and year out we miss. The run game is great but when you lose Yanda, Stanley, and Ingram, things are going to be a little different.

People hate Ravens fans across the country because of threads like this. We need to appreciate what we have, good Lord we could be the team 45 minutes south of us. Relax. Lamar is in his 3rd year for crying out loud.

Go ahead and down vote this comment away, but this is ridiculous if you genuinely want him gone.

TL:DR - Roman is not to blame and we’d be dumb to fire him."

"It feels like an entire new season. Defense got a fire lit under them hopefully a bunch of players coming back, need to turn it up these last 5 games against the easier section of our schedule... and anything can happen if we get into the playoffs.

I’m not trying to sound arrogant or like I know we’re going to dominant or anything like that. But we’re going to see what this team is TRULY made of when it really really matters."
"I'm just excited for a turnaround. Been a tough month with injuries, covid and 4 close losses in 5 games"
"Well, I'm only excited because we're back to the easy part of the schedule, and frankly, losing at this point isn't an option. If anything was going to kick this team in gear, that should be it. 

But with so many players with COVID, I'm still not super optimistic that we will be full strength come Tuesday. 

We really need Lamar to come back ready, and the run game to be on point. Dallas has a week defense, and it's time the offense find it's stride and help our defense out. I'm hoping Dez is ready for his breakout game against his former team."

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/k6r6c0)"
After the steelers game I gained some back. Before I thought all hope was lost.
I do in the players but not in the offensive scheme and co-ordinator
"Objectively speaking, most of our lives will remain unaffected whether they trend down or up. Given this, I’d rather invest the energy I put into being a fan in a positive way

tl;dr 

bigtruzz"
I have confidence that we’ll make the playoffs. Any and all games played in January will have me extremely anxious.
"I believe they Ravens should really start doing what some teams do in the NFL and that is quick passing. It’s painful watching our WR’s run plain routes and (of course) not getting open as a result. We need to take advantage of DB playing zone on guys and quickly give them the ball. The titans game 2 weeks ago, for example, Dez was always open as butler was playing him out and it took us to the end of the game to figure out we can get yards giving him the ball. Even the announcers made a comment on it.

Lamar holding on the ball with these garbage screen plays need to go. It’s no surprise Lamar is getting sacked when we have him running plays where he holds on the ball for 5 seconds+. He should only have that ball for 2 seconds. 

End of the story, look at Mahomes. No I’m not trying to compare Lamar to Mahomes but the success Mahomes is having with quick passing is intriguing. I just don’t see why we can’t run these plays. It seems so fitting for a guy like Lamar Jackson."
Mahomes goes down the field. Ben is the quick passer. But Harbaugh also doesn't believe in things like rub routes.
"I’ve been pounding the table for a Deebo Samuel, Aj Brown, Laviska Shenault type player. Just throw screens and slants (throw some bunch formations and picks in the mix) and boom, a short passing game that can result in big chunk plays. 

We need someone besides Lamar that can turn nothing into something. We might have it in Dobbins, now let’s get another at WR"
">do quick passes  

You misspelled ""run the fucking ball"""
They don't do that at all because Lamar is still in the sit in the pocket until the seem opens for him to run or take the sack mentality. If they ran a hurry up or a quick pass offense they would absolutely get guys are hard counts with the threat of the run game or the quick pass coming. But they don't
"I'd probably improve our offensive output (and I'll take that however I can get it), but I find those kind of plays so boring if there's no YAC. It's just snap, throw, catch and tackle/fall. They're over so quick with nothing cool happening."
"Something's gotta change in our WR department, we need some outside hires from the Chiefs or others. (Steelers but doubt any of them would come/Steelers would let them join us).

On the flip side they have been amazing at drafting DL like us"
We also just rarely spend high picks on WRs
"It’s not the scouting, it’s the coaching that makes our WRs so bad"
Yeah its been 25 years of sucking at drafting receivers lol. Torrey Smith is the most successful WR they drafted
"It's the coaching. Look at Perriman now.  He is a better receiver now then he ever was with us. In fact there were people in this sub saying they would take him over Brown. 

We cant develop these guys. Hollywood would be a killer on another team. In fact I would even say that Hollywood has regressed since being coached by the Ravens, he had better technique last year and coming out of college. We need to address this issue first before anything changes."
We weren't particularly good before they took them. The best we drafted were Stokley and Torrey.
I mean I'm not sure the eagles have been much better at drafting WRs
"I feel like we don’t talk enough about the culture.  

I think the defense has always been good because of the longevity of the positional coaching staff and the culture/work ethic that comes from the players - if you are a linebacker or dlineman, it’s very much a meritocracy.  Your draft position doesn’t matter, just give it your all every day because we’ve had starters come in from all sources.  I think the stars we’ve had in Ray and Suggs helped create that environment.  

On the WR front... we’ve never had a home grown talent to make that culture and currently have a bunch of journeymen or young guys.  Our WR core has gotten better in the past when we had a vet join like Anquan.  I don’t think Torrey does what he did for us without Q.  If you look at our WR room now.. who are these guys following?  No one is setting the tone and has proven what it takes to be a regular star/contributor in the league.  I’m hoping Dez’s work ethic can translate to that even if he lost a step - that to me is more valuable than anything."
"No team has ran the ball in the last 10-15 years more than us. Doesn’t really matter who we put at WR, Harbs and Co seem insistent on being a run 1st team which will naturally make it harder to break out as a receiver."
We were always ass at it.

"Ingram is on a hard decline. He should be mentoring Dobbins.

Edit: He hasn't cleared covid list as well."

Lot of info there. RGIII to IR is the one that sticks out. Or was that known?
AVERETT SEASON IS IN FULL EFFFFFECT
"A few thoughts...

* If Wednesday was the last time Robert Griffin III suits up in a Ravens uniform, hats off to this organization for rekindling RGIII's love and passion for football and major props to RGIII for helping and mentoring Lamar Jackson ever since he was a rookie.

* Getting Anthony Averett back is huge, especially now that Jimmy Smith will probably miss a few weeks. A combo of Averett, Tramon Williams and even Davontae Harris is a solid trio behind Humphrey and Peters and is definitely much better than when Khalil Dorsey and Terrell ""Owens, Barry"" Bonds were the only other active corners for a few weeks. When Smith returns, the Ravens will be close to the level of depth they had in the secondary before the season started.

* I wonder how the o-line will look this week. You have to imagine the Ravens were very impressed with Trystan Colon-Castillo against the Steelers that they would like to roll with him at center. That said (and with any changes to the left side of the line being extremely unlikely), who gets the nod at right guard and tackle? I can see it being Ben Powers and Patrick Mekari, respectively. I feel that's the best it's going to get with the offensive line at this point; a line consisting of Brown/Bozeman/Colon-Castillo/Powers/Mekari from left to right."
Holy shit Chris Moore is finally on the field this year
"So, Luke Wilson is part of the 53 man permanently? Ugh, hopefully after really getting some practice time in he'll be more effective, but based off Wednesday I'm not excited about it"
Thank god we have Averett back.  I’m sorry buddy I’ll appreciate you for now on.

"Follow-up tweet: Of course, as Baltimore showed with its running backs last week, being eligible doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll play. Robert Griffin III landed on injured reserve today, so if Jackson can't go, it'd be Trace McSorley against Dallas."
"I have a hard time seeing us not playing Lamar. It's not quite the same as not playing Ingram or Dobbins because we *also* didn't have Lamar, or a full o-line, and the rest of the team was decimated... unless Lamar is physically ill, he has to be ready to go... right?"
Honestly with our defense and run game I would feel pretty good about our chances with Trace against the Cowboys if need be.
Honestly I just hope Lamar is ok cuz I don’t wanna have him get sick or injured

"This sentiment might not play well here but for as hard as the Ravens played, the Steelers made it easy for them. Tomlin's right. They sucked."
This made me like him ever so slightly more.
Tomlin’s a good coach. That’s the problem.
"With his move to the IR and the (limited) success of Trace McSorely, I assume that was the last time we will see RG3 in a Ravens uniform. Big respect to a great teammate and Raven. He may not have been spectacular on the field but he’s been an amazing presence on the team and has done a lot for the Baltimore community as well. 

Thank you Rob, you’ll always be a true Raven"
"If RG3 doesn't play next year (or beyond) I think he's got a future in coaching, esp. at the college level, or announcing/analysis. In some ways I think he's been a spiritual leader of the team even if he wasn't really leading on the field. I've never heard an awkward press conference from him, he always speaks with authority and poise and a lot of what he says is genuinely insightful. People talk about Ingram being a potential announcer but I don't think he has the analytical mind for it. RG3 does. I could see him playing a similar role to what Michael Vick has been doing lately."
"He seems like a good guy, and I'm glad he got a chance. RG3 is an example of why sports can be a bitch. He has the heart, but not the body. I'd say it has been a big plus to have him on the team, and I wish him well elsewhere."
"I hope he’s not done as a Raven and gets a chance next year (but hey, there’s always the jets former raven squad). He’s the perfect mentor for Lamar and he seems like a really stand up guy now, really matured since his younger days. Glad he got a 2nd wind for his career here and that we got to “RG3” so many teams in the 4th quarter last year. Wishing him well."
"I've never seen a player so excited to get kn the field, even when it was just a play here and there. Back when we ran that Heisman package and Lamar had no business pitching the ball, but did anyways just because he knew how badly Rg3 wanted it. I feel bad for the guy, but hopefully what he showed in the last game was enough for a team to take a chance on him? Doubt it, but I think he still really wants to play"
"I love the man and wish him nothing but the best, but I'm not sure that rg3 keeps the backup roll. Greg Roman and the lack of starters didn't do him any favors, but I think the spark that Trace had in the 4th pretty much iced rg3s backup roll. I am excited to see where his career takes him, but I don't think it'll be quarter backing a Greg Roman offense. I do think he has talent and more to offer, but it just wasn't connecting. Even when he would step in last year to finish out games, there wasn't much (granted they didn't want him slinging the ball around I'm the 4th while having giant leads)."
It’s the least we can do lol we ruined his career.
Bad timing for me buying that RG3 jersey..
I would love to have RG3 back he is an awesome guy to have around. Just like Ingram. Id honestly be sad to see either guy go just bc there such great teammates.
"Part 1/2 

I think Griffin will get an opportunity to compete for a spot somewhere next year if he wants to.  I'm not saying he'd necessarily make that team, but I don't see why he couldn't come into training camp with a team.

However, if he has money in the bank and a future career (Or a calling of some sort in art, charity, or activism) beyond football (or as a coach or an analyst) in mind, this might not be a bad opportunity to go out on his own terms after having come back and shown that he could be a good team player and at least hang in the league as a backup despite losing his legs (Figuratively speaking).

Injuries and poor performance cut his career short in Washington and Cleveland and then he seemed done after no one would sign him to play anywhere on an NFL roster in 2017.  To tack 3 years on to that moving up from third string to backup for a quality franchise like the Ravens, with no rumors of backstage intrigue or of him trying to undermine Joe Flacco (For the one year they played together) or Lamar Jackson, but from what we know being a supportive teammate in the film room and helping Jackson adjust to life in the NFL and be a better player instead of undermining him or keeping his own counsel hoping to win Jackson's job, is impressive.

In a way, I think this has been a bigger accomplishment for him as a football player and a man than his early success.  

He came into the league a very hyped player with a ton of endorsements who I think struck some people as arrogant (Although it wasn't necessarily true) and as succeeding based on pure talent rather than football IQ (Also not necessarily true- there's a long history of people often unfairly stereotyping young African-American quarterbacks in that way. Frankly, as a Ravens fan, I wasn't following what was going on with a middling-at-best NFC team closely enough to judge for myself whether the description some had of him was accurate or people falling back on a stereotype.).

He came back in a role a lot of people who came up the way he did would have been too humble to take, a tryout to be a third stringer behind a former Super Bowl MVP and a new first round draft pick (Making him not only the 3rd stringer, but a guy who neither the current starter or the future starter on a team that had people slated for both roles already), and he never complained about it or gave any sign he was doing anything other than his best to keep himself and his teammates prepared.  He showed that even though he couldn't run the way he used to, he could hang enough for the front office and the coaching to be comfortable with him (in the second and third years of his Ravens tenure) as the backup on a team that looked at itself as a Super Bowl contended the last couple years, at a key position where a lot of injuries occur around the league, behind a running quarterback, who no matter how careful, is always going to be just a little more at risk of injury than a pocket passer (The more you run, the more you can get hit).

I remember talking with a relative who was (and is) a fan of Washington (There's no accounting for taste ;) ) and when I mentioned Griffin lining up at receiver and faking a sweep like he meant it, my relative was shocked.  Being willing to do stuff like that and play it all through was not the reputation he had in Washington, apparently, but he did it in Baltimore.  Not everyone would. 

I remember another quarterback who, when split out wide, stuck his hands in his fanny pack looking disgusted and not even halfway running a route- he'd just stand there sullenly at the line of scrimmage for the entire play.  Then he'd complain about it in press conferences after games, arguing that there was no play where the team wasn't better off without him up under center and that you didn't see Tom Brady being asked to split out wide, long after it was apparent that while perhaps he was better than the statistics showed, he was no Tom Brady (To be fair, that's a good thing in some ways- no cheating with deflated footballs, no sliding and then kicking a safety in the shins after the whistle.).

I'm not trying to start an argument about that quarterback (That's why I'm ommitting his name), who I have some fond memories of, but I'm just mentioning that guy's bad moment to show what Griffin could have been like all the time, and maybe some would claim was like early in his career, and was the polar opposite of in Baltimore.

I think when RG3 came to Baltimore, he in a low-key way was reported to be going by ""Rob"".  It wasn't I think a way of drawing attention for him, but rather a way to come back as a normal guy and politely deflect attention so he could do his job and be a good teammate.  I think Rob Griffin may well have been a better more mature person that RG3.

He didn't complain that we didn't work him into the offense in a slash role. He didn't complain about anything- at least not publicly.

This is who he built himself into when arguably his biggest strengths that led him to his early success were gone and a lot of guys would have given up on football.

I agree that the Ravens may well move on to McSorely who is younger, probably better (At this point), probably cheaper, and who was brought in and kept around with the idea of being LJ's backup, probably with this percise timing in mind.  The Ravens traditionally haven't carried a third QB.  That Trace has been there tells me they have always had a plan for him, probably as LJ's long-term backup, as long as his play in practice justified it.

I think the idea may have been in part that Griffin might have worked himself in competing for a starting job with another team or being a backup for a team with a starter who seems more likely to get benched, or else would maybe be in the situation he seems to be in now, but either way that this coming off season would likely be his transition point."
Dude showed a lot of heart trying to play through that hammy pull.Seemingly bigger/better layers have sidelined themselves for way less.
Really feel bad because I wanted him to be able to showcase himself
"Part 2/2 (This starts getting a bit non-RG3 related, but it was originally typed right as the second part of my RG3 comment in the thread. I ran into some space limits and had to split it up)

The Ravens also may want to start carrying a third string QB again of a different sort.  LJ is the reigning NFL MVP.  His job is not in danger in 2020 or 2021 even though his play has been a bit disappointing at times this season.  McSorely's potential promotion to backup this off-season is likely going to be in part specifically because he'd make a good backup to Jackson.

However, knowing that running QBs only rarely have success past the first 5-10 years, and sometimes burn out even earlier, drafting a third stringer with a big arm who rolls our a bit might not be a bad idea as a cheap long-term insurance policy if a time comes where we are looking that way (Remember, the idea of a last day of the draft rookie as a third string QB next year is not likely done with the idea of him playing next year- it's a long-term maneuver).  One lesson of RG3 is that a QB who relies on his legs who loses even the smallest fraction of that speed due to injury, which can come at any time, will not always be able to beat NFL defenses anymore, which are extremely fast.  Covid-19 has been shown to, in some people, cause some permanent heart and lungs damage equivalent to an average first heart attack (He needs those lungs), and that's what LJ is out with.  And if he gets past it with no changes, he's always a play away from that big ACL injury or whatever.

If a strong armed third string QB is good, and good under pressure, he could even conceivably be brought into games where the Ravens are down big late to try to move the team way down field fast with his arm.  He'd still not be the guy to come in if LJ gets hurt during the week or in the middle of a tight game, but there could be some value to this hypothetical guy as sort of a ""comeback specialist"".  

I don't think the NFL has any restrictions on third string QBs anymore- it used to be that you'd get an extra gameday active if you made it a third string ""emergency"" QB, but that if that emergency QB ever entered the game, the starter and the backup could not reenter the game. Now there is I think just an extra gameday active for whomever a team wants at whatever position they want instead- no such thing as a designated ""emergency"" QB with special restrictions. If you want to make him active, you can bring him in for anything you want- special plays at QB designed for him in special situations where he comes in and then comes out when the situation changes, lining him up at halfback and doing a halfback toss, lining him up at WR, whatever- that doesn't keep you from bringing the starter back in or from using your top backup if your starter gets hurt or is ineffective. You can put three QBs on one play these days, if you want to.

It'll also be interesting to see where they go with the offense next year in terms of the playbook- whether it's Greg Roman still handling it or someone else.  The league has clearly again adjusted to LJ in some respects, and we'll need to make the next move to break their system and see if they can crack the next one.  Or maybe it's a personnel thing, I could see a big bruising old-time first round pick RB who can barrel over the safeties teams are lining up as part of their defensive front sevens forcing opposing teams to choose between either using a more traditional defense LJ can run wild on or the stop LJ scheme with all the defensive backs playing linebackers who would struggle to bring down a world class power running back who could eek out at least 5 yards on that formation almost every time as he drags several DBs playing linebacker most of those yards before they can bring him down.

Obviously, Jackson also still has some work to do in the passing game, but he's only a 3rd year guy and seemed to have it mostly figured out in 2019.  We can keep working with him on that and maybe give him a nice solid possession receiver who specializes in fighting for contested balls, and a strong healthy offensive line.

Not saying LJ *needs* it, but I could see a sort of off-season coach we'd recommend, or a good passing QB who's retired, working with him on throwing mechanics and just passing and reading defenses all off-season.

I also wonder if we might consider more I-formation and pro-set (With or without the fullback) and less pistol formation and shotgun formation."
"He’s been a great guy to have around for Lamar to learn from and he’s been really surprisingly comfortable in this role with the Ravens. He’s still got it, that’s clear. He just got a tough break out there. I hope he gets a shot somewhere, a real shot. His whole career, he’s been denied the opportunity to really show what he can do. It helps that he no longer has a head coach determined to watch his quarterback die out there."
Uuhmmmm no

Controversial tweets gets people riled and then gets tractions. That’s why you never like or retweet this bullshit.
Any person who slightly has a brain that watched the game on Wednesday can clearly see how bad this team is without Jackson. Yes Jackson has mistakes in games but after that shit show of an offense no one should question him
Everyone hates on Lamar but he was severely missed last week

I never understood why people on Twitter do this. People are always going to like something more than they will retweet it
It’s ridiculous. Trace made ONE good throw. Hollywood added ~60 yards of YAC. We might win 2 more games this season with trace at the helm.
He’s thrown 6 passes and we’re seeing this 🤦‍♂️

I'm not saying trace mcsorley isn't a good qb but lamar is better. Trace throwing one TD is nice but lamar has thrown quite a few TDs and many more. If trace mcsorley gets to start (which he wont) I would be soooooo mad and sad for lamar

Nope. Harbaugh is being hush hush about it.

"Goddamn I hate the waiver system. Absolutely broken, but I hope he falls to Bmore"

He has 36 catches in a 4 year career.  I think we're already chock full of AAAA players on the backend of the roster.
"For someone who had a Lion in fantasy, Marvin Hall was frustrating for seemingly constantly coming out of nowhere with long touchdowns, taking points from me. At this point any receiver good enough to see the field for another team should be on our radar."
"Sorry if any of these questions have been addressed.. usually keep up with the forum and didn't see any of these answered.. also I think harbaugh is keeping these things on the DL.

&#x200B;

Is big babby/campbell returning in time to play the browns? This is HUGE considering the browns are ahead of us & Chubb & Hunt are admittingly some DAWWWWGS.

&#x200B;

Does Powers continue to start at RG? or does Tyre come back & start against Dallas. Also.. does fluker return in time for the Browns game? I know he's not the best RT but he is the best we have. Don't mean to look passed Dallas.. but we SHOULD beat them.  


Moving Forward do we see Dobbins as the main back? Hopefully so.. plain and simple.

&#x200B;

Lastly, I really hope Elliot & Yucky Chucky are good to go next Tuesday. Both were limping by the end of the game & chuck was on Zrebiecs injury report. We will see!"
"1. Yes they will both be back
2. Philips was activated off IR already 
3. Dobbins will most likely see more carries down the stretch, the benefit of having Ingram still in rotation is now we have 4 fresh backs that can all take a lead role going down the back of the season to playoffs hopefully one of them gets hot in the process"
Like my gran papi always said.. CAW CAW
"1.  Both Williams are Campbell are older and very big.  I’m hoping they will be back for the browns but there is no guarantee.  Wolfe has stepped up in a big way in their absence.

2.  Tyre Phillips and fluker both stink. I wouldn’t be surprised to see a line of brown, boze, colon, Mekari, Holden.

3. I think dobbins will be the guy."

I mean I don’t get the statement “just McSorley”..we have Tyler Huntley as well ready to be called up from the practice squad
We also have Huntley who will get pulled up but will be inactive most likely unless Lamar isn’t back.
I think Tyler Huntley could be legit. Kid has a big arm and is mobile af
"We got plently of depth in the QB

If Lamar can't play that's fine Trace goes up with Tyler as his back up."
"Should’ve started last game, then maybe we could’ve won."
"I always thought ""is on IR"" was RG-III last name."
Kinda late.....but gotta give props to practice squad player Nick Moore on his NFL debut and for smoothly filling in for Morgan Cox. Long snapping is actually much tougher than people realize and he excited flawlessly. Especially impressive given no real practice time for the last two weeks.
He didn't send it over Koch so he's a winner in my book
Honorary wolfpack
"Saw him practicing 2 days prior to the game and dude was killing it. Was snapping the ball at a goal post and damn was he consistently getting loud ""pings"". It was an oddly beautiful symphony."
What about Tre'mon? That 37 year old mfer played like an absolute beast!
Wolfling
I always thought it was weird the Ravens kept protecting him and used up a spot for him on the practice squad but i remember the Titans lost their LS to covid and it really threw them in a panic and Zrebec used that as an example why we kept Moore. It proved to be a smart call in the end

"I know this will be received poorly, but at what point do we stop using Steve Saunders as a scapegoat? He was absolutely the most egregious violator of COVID protocols, but I don’t think he is alone. Harbs had some boneheaded comments earlier this year, and now is under scrutiny for lack of oversight. And then we see little blips of insight into players’ personal lives. Marlon got COVID earlier this year, and perhaps coincidentally always had Instagram stories from bars and restaurants. Tonight, he has more stories from bars and restaurants. I don’t know what it’s like to be an nfl player, but I know what it’s like to be a professional during COVID, and these guys seem to take risks that I, and my coworkers, don’t take. Which baffles me because their income is orders of magnitude above my own. Does anyone else feel frustrated with the entire team and how they’ve managed the COVID crisis?"
yeah it's not just Saunders. it's a really bad look for the whole team of course. disappointed
"You aren't out of line at all.

I think you are asking a lot of these kids to give them what is likely the biggest paycheck they have ever seen and then tell them to stay home every night.
Even more so when you considered they are in the prime of their live, stronger and healthier than 90% of the population."

"Marlon has cosigned the stupid shit trump says about Covid on Twitter so it's not surprising from him. Also, I agree the team is to blame just as much as that guy. If he wasn't wearing a mask then that should have been addressed earlier not when nearly the entire team contracted Covid. Honestly, we should be disciplined for this."
"How about we're in a fucking pandemic without a bubble in place, you have better odds than ever of contracting it no matter who you are right now"
"You have a point--the team has to be held responsible for letting Saunders violate protocol so blatantly.  I wouldn't worry, though.  I have no doubt that the League will take this opportunity to punish Art Modell posthumously.  I'm guessing that we'll have to give all of our 2021 Draft picks to the Steelers for daring to inconvenience them slightly.  Oh, and everyone will have to run 500 laps around the Hall of Fame while Browns and Bengals fans throw things at them.  This will backfire when some confused Eagles-fan visitors to the Hall decide to lend their extensive throwing-things experience to the crowd and wind up launching a tractor-trailer into the building.

I'm exaggerating, of course...but it's gonna be harsh."
"Not out of line, just really late to the conversation.  People have been saying this over and over for 2 weeks."
The surprising part is how he got access to the facility.  Don't teams do temp checks at the door?  Reports were that Saunders was symptomatic which means a fever.  Chances are the Ravens had a total failure in basic protocols.  Gonna guess the Ravens get docked a 5th rd pick by the league.

Just reaching for anything to convince them it's a fluke and their team isn't just mediocre and coasting on refball and lucky bounces.
Have you even been on our sub? Most of us are memeing ourselves and talking about the loss realistically. Maybe the feed shows differently
"Funny how when anyone mentioned how our team has been riddled with injuries for weeks it’s been “excuses” but all I’m seeing from Steelers fans is how injuries played such a big part in their loss 🙄🙄 

To be clear, I would never wish injuries or sickness on anyone but it’s pretty interesting how they also have to keep eating their own words: “you guys have covid cases, you should have to forfeit” “injuries are excuses” and I have a feeling they’re gonna have to eat all the “lol 1st seed 1 and done, overrated, bla bla bla” from last year as well, come playoffs"
My favorite part is that my biggest steeler fan friend used to bitch and moan constantly that we would just dink n dunk and then have Torrey draw DPIs.  That is basically the whole Steelers offense this year.
"I loved seeing them have meltdowns over the end of half shenanigans. Last week it was “it’s just a smart play. It happens all the time” to this week when it happened to them “fuck Washington, they shouldn’t have 3 points, they’re cheap”."
"I liked the knuckle dragger that was crying about how they only have half of their offensive line. When they're really only missing a mediocre Pouncey.

Imagine having to play a game when:

Your starting guard (Foster, not HoFer Yanda) retired last year 

A starting (Banner, career backup getting first shot, not even in the same league as All Pro Stanley) tackle is on IR

 A starting center (one, not 2) is on the covid list.

I can't think of any, not even a single team that could *possibly* be going thru a situation like that. Those poor Pittsburgh Victims."
I heard they lost and watched the highlights. When I saw them go on a 4th and goal I was just like oh no shit these guys are morons. The Washington offense isn't legendary. It isn't threatening. They did the same shit against the rg3 ravens and Ben threw an int. Just kick a fucking field goal. Bad start to a game and wft got heated after that stop
"They always fall apart down the stretch and I've been saying it all year. 

Their team is always built to be gassed by week 16. I would be surprised to see them lose 2 more games over the next 4."

"Is Irsay coming? Cause fuck no.

We’d go from the penthouse to the outhouse as far as ownership is concerned, or more appropriately the penthouse to the penitentiary. 

Seriously that pill popper has ruined two generational QBs on his watch and has one less championship than we do with arguably the greatest QB of all time. 

Ask Bart Scott about that. 

We literally just got a generational talent at QB and if we stopped calling the same plays and had a strength coach who wore a mask, would probably be sitting at 8-3 right now. 

And this is a down year. 

Meanwhile Indy has no prospective QB past next week, has a few solid players (Nelson, Leonard, Buckner) and an ok coaching staff but won’t be considered anything more than an 8-8 team at best. 

So if that were to happen I’d feel pretty terrible"

Very odd question. You don't rip the heart out of a fan base in the early 80s only to come back later; doesn't work that way. I don't expect most on reddit to understand what happened.
"I don't think any fan would really be happy with this. Either fans are old enough to remember the Colts, in which case they already hate the Colts too much to ever root for them again, or they're too young to remember the Colts, in which case they'd be losing their lifelong team in the Ravens for a team they'd have no reason to welcome 'back'."
"As much as the nostalgia of the Colts would be nice, no. The Ravens are Baltimore's team now. We have the memories of Unitas, Donovan, Ameche, Moore, etc. Older fans have never forgotten them. We are making new memories with Lewis, Ogden, Flacco, Jackson, etc. 

Embrace the past, but the Ravens are our future."
"I'd be fuckin' pissed, wym ?

The ""Ravens"" just make sense due to Edgar Allan Poe and the connection there. 

Also, I bleed purple and black, baby. Purple is my favorite color. I have purple bedsheets and black pillow cases. Ain't no damn way I'd be as happy with another team as I am the Ravens."

WHO'S UP FOR A QUID PRO QUO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IN THE DMV AREA AND BEYOND.
I was watching the WFT-Steelers game last night with an Eagles and Giants fan and all 3 of us were rooting for the WFT. Pretty funny to see that the Steelers can make division rivals root for one another.
Fuck Dan Snyder but it was majestic to see Alex Smith take down the Steelers.

Hell yea. I've been wanting an all maryland super bowl since I was a kid. Way to beat the Steelers!!

The majority of teams play 3 games in 12 days every single year.
"This happens multiple times a year.

Anytime a team goes from 2 sundays to a thursday game its 12 days in between all of them.

God what a bunch of babies."
"Ebron is about as smart as he is good at catching the football. 

Or blocking for that matter. Check out Chase Young abusing him like Adrian Peterson would to his kid on that fourth and goal. 

I’m sure if they had more rest then they wouldn’t have thought a single block on young with a journeyman TE would be a good idea. 

Or passing to a RB who has caught five catches in his career on a gotta have it fourth down was the way to go. 

Fuck this garbage ass team and their garbage excuses."
This happens every time a team has a tnf game the Steelers fans are just salty and stupid
"Our three game stretch, other than NYJ, was quite tough. They played the 1 win Jags, our reserves, and the NFC Least's second place team."
"Steelers are pure trash, there team is an anomaly, they will be one and done"
They’re so mad they finally got exposed as an overrated team 😂😂😂
"Lmao their original schedule had 3 games in 12 days, nov 15, nov 22 and nov 26. Then it was changed to..... 3 games in 12 days hahaha"
Right but they all wanna bitch and cry and make excuses the Steelers fans some straight bitches 😂💯
"The sun rising in the east, setting in the west, and Pittsburgh and their sycophants from r/NFL whining about scheduling inconvenience. A tradition as old as time."
"This has nothing to do with volume of games. That team has been squeeking by all season. They barely beat the Broncos (4-8). They barely beat the Texans (4-8).  They barely beat the Cowboys (3-8). They have played a very easy schedule for the most part. Giants (5-7), Eagles (3-8-1), Bengals (2-9-1), Jags (1-11).  They played the Browns before they got their shit together and started winning some games. The Titans was probably the first above average team they played all year and it was a very close game.  Hell even moving forward they get another free win from the Bengals in a couple weeks and  really only have 2 or 3 above average teams left to play. Are they a good team this year? I mean sure you have to at least be decent to win that many games but they had a lot of help with a very very very soft schedule."
"I feel like there was a weird situation where we ended up with 3 games in 11 days at one point as well. 

I would say the more accurate comparison would be when we practised all week then lost our bye in week 3 or 3 of 2008 due to Ike because we had to play Houston on our bye week. So we has like 14 or 15 games straight and made to the AFC Championship with a rookie HC and QB."
"It’s also ridiculous because they had 9 days to prepare for the game on the 2nd against the ravens. So over that same stretch of 3 games in 12 days, they also only played those 3 games in 21 days. Quit whining."
Steelers also played 3 in 12 last year it happens all the time to everyone
The Steelers have played 3 games in 12 days in 4 of the last five years. They’re the most whiny fans on all of Reddit I swear
"I forget where I saw it, but someone tweeted out last week ""Steelers have to play three games in twelve days. Last time the Steelers had to play three games in twelve days? 2019. Before that? 2018"""
The bills and 49ers were also playing their third game in 12 days and they weren’t complaining
You shouldn't need three days to plan for The Football Team.
"I think Steelers fans are less upset about being 11-1, it's the fact that they lost to fucking Washington.

Goddamn, last night was a fun watch."
"As a Steeler fan, I don't think that. I think the amount of fans stating this is very small. I think there are more non-Steeler fans saying that they are saying it than actual Steeler fans that are actually saying it! My wife us grumbling about it, I just tell her to chill.

The Steelers lost because their run game was crap, WR's could not catch, and they refused to kick field goals and went for first downs when it made absolutely no sense. Dumb."
"Every team that plays Sunday, Sunday, Thursday plays 3 games in 12 days.  Don't most teams do that every year?   Did the Steelers do that twice or something?   What am I missing?"
Fuck the steelers
We lost because we dropped passes. Again.
" Happy Gilmore accomplished that feat no more then an hour ago.

It's not the amount of time that's the problem, they played like crap against the Ravens and kept that up against WFT.  They apparently can't run without Connor so that kills their short passing game if they aren't worried about the run. 

People always like to point out how Team X or Y figured out the Ravens, it's nice that the Ravens practice squad essentially exposed the Steelers."
"I'm pretty sure the Ravens have gone Monday, Sunday, Thursday in the past as well."
"Poor Steelers man, they lost after playing their 3rd game in 17 days. They even had to play our practice squad last week :/ They really have it rough."
What's worse is the random fans from other teams that have been rimjobbing the Steelers since Thanksgiving.
"That December 12 game was THE SHIT. I was working out of town (Corpus Christi, TX), so I wore my black Lamar jersey to my favorite restaurant after work (Chuy's) and went all out with my meal. While I wished I was with my family, at least if I was working out of town by myself, I had a good game to watch with some good food and drink."
"They are such crybabies, jfc."
""
"I love this. But in all fairness every fan base has em, have you seen the game thread when we’re losing? We don’t get a first down and people clamor for us to fire someone."
"""you're from Ohio stop acting like you're cold"" damn that's hilarious"
And another thing- bring back Terry Bradshaw!
For a fanbase that likes to gloat about the number of rings they have they sure think their organization is the  worst
Imagine feeling that the biggest problem with the human being named Ben Roethlisberger is that he wears gloves when he plays football
Tomlin is the most overrated game day coach in the history of the league. He may be good the rest of the week but he makes head scratching calls every single game. It’s bizarre.

"Not gonna lie, first read that as lose and was triggered"
Hope you guys kick butt tonight.
How about we give the bulk of the carries to Dobbins with Gus backing up.
"Lamar needs to let himself go. I know he wants to prove the critics and haters wrong by hanging in the pocket and looking to pass, but we're out here to win football games. If you can pick up a first down with your feet, just do it. You shouldn't bank on Boykin or Brown getting open and catching a pass if you can just get a first down yourself. Not saying to be a run-first QB, but if the defense is giving you the opportunity to get a decent gain, just take it. Everyone knows our receiving corps sucks and our passing plays are horribly designed anyway.

Baldy pointed this out on one of his breakdowns a few weeks ago (@Patriots)."
"Just imagine if we win out.

Then our redemption tour begins.
At Titans
At KC
At Pittsburgh 

Win SB over Tampa Bay."
"As a Giants fan and the Ravens being my favourite team in the AFC, I hope he absolutely roasts the Cowboys tonight.

Personally would love to see color rush tonight  since I got my color rush Lamar jersey and hes gone off when wearing it. But black on black is so good too.
Color rush will be next week against the browns this week we are wearing black jerseys and I think purple pants
"Zeke has fumbled the most out of any RB and is going against the team with the most forced fumbles (Marlon, 9, peters, 3, ginkel, 3, yannick (some on vikinngs) 3 and deshon elliott, 2) also, the two best o-line are out, dak is out, ranked 32 run defense."
who is ginkel lol
Let’s hope Zeke only gets garbage junk yards due to us having a huge lead the entire game
"You know this means he has no fumbles right? This is Baltimore. That’s how these stats work. Most fumbles vs most forced? No fumbles. #1 run defense vs worst run offense? Field day in the ground. 

It’s like these stats exist just to jinx the team."

"Ever since their older vet’s have retired, their locker room has descended into hell. Tomlin has no control over the team. You saw it with Ben’s radio shows. AB’s antics. Bell’s holdout.

"Their offense is GIMMICKY. Stop the run, tackle their receivers after the catch, and force them to go down the field 15+ plays of short passes. They are bound to drop some balls and have incompletions due to bad timing. Good defenses will continue to EXPOSE them for the frauds they are. The Ravens held them to 13 offensive points and the WFT held them to 17. The steelers are in TROUBLE. When it comes to the playoffs they will get smoked by the upper tier teams in the AFC"

"The fact that his only good year came in a contract year is pretty scary/risky but the fact remains that he has really balled out this year and would still be in his prime entering free agency assuming the Titans don't retain him since declining his 5th year option.

Do people think he can be the franchise big bodied WR that we need here? Assuming he'll demand a bit less than Allen Robinson in fa"
I’ll take almost any receiver in FA at this point lol
Titans fans were ready to call him a bust until late last year when he realized he was about to be in a contract year and remembered how to catch the ball. For me he's low on the list of receivers I want us to go after. He's definitely behind Robinson and DJ Chark.

Not to mention they have the worst rush defense in the league

Knowing Roman, he will think that’s what the cowboys think we will do, and come out passing on the first play."

Why are we posting shit from the steelers sub here?
"Anyone else really hoping they target Dez a lot today to stick it to the Cowboys organization? You know he wants to go off, I hope they let him show them what he still has."
You know we have shit receivers when we're waiting for old man Dez Bryant to break out.
I really want to see Dez do to the Cowboys what Steve Smith did to the Panthers. Especially the post-game shit-talking.
I completely forgot this is going to be Dez first game Vs the Cowboys.  God I hope he goes off.  More importantly I hope Roman calls plays to give it to him effectively
"I definitely am. How many times over the years have we seen a player go off on their former team. IF it’s ever going to happen for Dez, tonight would be the time."

"I’ve been down on this team throughout the season, but goddamn this sub is depressing today.

It's insane how many elite runners we have. Our RB4 is really Justice Hill lmao. That man could start on quite a few NFL teams
Guaranteed he will.
God damn how tall is Justice Hill. His torso is so long
Penalties and turnovers incoming.
"The easy answer, we are a running team, let's run the ball. But truth is our o-line took a step back.

We have hollywood, proche and duvarney, we are a play action team who wins with the deep ball. This sounds good, but there is no time in the pocket to make a deep pass.

We have MAndrews, dez and willie, we are a short middle of the field passing team who can make contested catches. I haven't seen this come to fruition.

We are a gadget team, as Lamar goes we go. Fake reverses, misdirection and Lamar does the rest. Worked last year, isn't working this year

So what do you think our identity is/should be?"
"Our identity right now is Greg Roman. Regardless of who, where and what we do on the field, its his identity and everyone has figured it out."
I don’t think we have one anymore lol
Should be run heavy with nicely timed play action. And every now and then to prevent the defense from subbing we should go hurry up/no huddle like the colts game. Let’s see if gro figures it out.
To physically be there but mentally not
Running the exact same plays every game like this is Madden.
Its a little bit late in the season for us to try to be finding an identity as a team.  This is one of the main reasons we are at risk of missing the playoffs this year
"I remain in the minority thinking that this team should become a spread majority passing team. However, I do recognize the current WR talent/GRo aren't conducive to this. I want to see the Bills, Cardinals or Cowboys (w/ Dak) offense just copy pasted with Lamar. Let Lamar's high IQ dissect the defense, then use the insane running game to close it out."
You are proving his point nicely. Not sure what you’re arguing about.

"welp, Dez won't get that chance"
Dez went off all right
Dez went off...the field.

"If they had him covering on islands like they did with Lamar Jackson and Henry Ruggs last week, I think he'll do way better with us."
Let’s fuckin go! A-squared (as he is known around my apartment) was looking pretty promising earlier this year.
Players only please. We all know Greg Roman would be the answer otherwise.
Tbh Mark and RG3 have done there jobs to mentor Gus and JK and Lamar and Trace.
"Unless he comes at or near the minimum contract, Skura. He's just not the same player after his injury and this is a strong draft for interior linemen."
"Maybe Judon if we can get someone better. He has his moments and he’s honestly not terrible, the issue is really whether he’s worth as much as we’re paying him. My frustration with him is that he’s inconsistent, he’ll have streaks where he constantly gets flags and does dumb shit but then will make a good play so you like him again. He’s done better in the later half of the season but the first 5ish weeks seemed kinda rough for him. Glad he’s worked on not getting so many flags tho."
"For me its RG3 - great guy buy I don't think he should be in the league anymore with his injuries. The role for Lamar's backup is more important than it would normally be given the offense's propensity for running the QB position. 

RG3 was great as a mentor and as an team leader, but as a player he might be done. I won't be mad if they keep him but if they keep him they should also be keeping McSorley or the guy on the practice squad. (I think hundley?)"
Dammit op I was gonna say Greg Roman
"Judon, he is not worth what we are paying him. Beyond that, Skura, Rg3, and Mark all seem to be in their last year as Ravens. I will miss all 3, but cap is gonna be tight"
Luke Wilson
"No one I really WANT to see gone, but I'm pretty sure guys like Ingram, RG3, Levine and Mcphee are all going to be replaced to save money next year.

I'd be surprised if Jimmy Smith wants another one year cheap contract too."
"- Judon is an easy answer but really, it’s not fair. He’s a decent player but overpaid and likely to BE overpaid. The penalties are killer but I can’t help but feel might be less of an issue if he didn’t have to try to Superman everything to get pressure because the rest of the front 7 can’t win an one on one. He’s played better in games with better performances around him (as all players do). 

- Ingram - he’s too expensive and unfortunately has hit the over 30 wall for RBs. He’s just not the same, and Dobbins is looking like the real deal. Plus he saves $5m on the cap

- Boyle - not because he’s bad at all. But because for a $5.5m cap space cut I think you can either restructure/extend or get a cheaper replacement. 80/20 rule. 

-"
"I think it has to be Judon, but I'm 99% sure that RG3 will be gone"
Judon unless he lowers his asking price by A LOT
CHRIS FUCKING MOORE
"Ingram.

Gus and JK are significantly better."
"Tavon ""IR Hero"" Young"
Miles Boykin
Judon and only because hes going to be expensive.
"After the first 10m of the game - Marquise Brown. He’s soft, he can’t catch, and he’s already developing an attitude. 

Get rid of him while he’s worth something."
"Roman 


Yea I know u said don’t say him but honestly I’m so done with Roman he needs to go"
Hollywood judon Ingram young averett in that order
John Harbaugh
"Will the Ravens lose again this season, Nevermore, nevermore."

Forgot to mention Dez gets his first TD back against his former team 😤😤
My guy it isn't gonna be a crucial recovery because it'll be a blowout
""
"Yes.  If you notice, almost all of the other players rotate in and out except Marlon, Peters and Elliott."
I think so
Yes. They gave Queen some reps with it during training camp but Clark will have it when he's on the field.
""
Hope he balls the fuck out tonight
"Just another game, water over the bridge... My ass. Give him red zone jump balls."
He tested positive. Not playing tonight :(
So did they do the Covid testing right before the game? When exactly did we find out dez has Covid?

"Don't they always?

Hoping they have a huge 5 games to finish the season."

That's dope.

This is amazing! Is this a hobby of yours?
"I actually really like the non-custom side of the helmet as a full-time thing. I'd be really excited with that helmet/uni update (even though our current setup is pretty lit too). Obviously the custom part wouldn't be there if that was full-time.

I wonder if any team has ever experimented with having two different logos on a helmet? Starting to wonder what it would look like if we replaced Backwards Bird with the Shield, but left Forwards Bird alone. I know Pitt only puts their logo on one side..."
Damn that looks nice af
That’s clean!!
beautiful
The shield fogged up on him during the game and he went back to the other helmet.

I remember those days
Please. I just need a flash of the 2019 offense.
I’ve been going to bed at like 8:45 the past few nights because my toddler’s 4:30am wake up calls are rough. I’d really like to not have to stay up until 11pm tonight...

No
"That’s a tall order. Maybe if Lamar throws 3 TD passes, all to Dobbins, and runs for 2 more himself? Lol"
"Nah you’re probably boned unless Lamar chucks a shitload of TDs to Dobbins. 

I’m probably screwed this week as well, if it helps. I’m relying on Lamar and the Ravens defense to carry me to the promised land and into the playoffs."
No
Nope.  Even if they both ball out they probably get benched for backups before they got that many points.
I’m in same boat as you but I also have Tucker
"You’re mixing streams, dude. Ain’t kosher."
""
[deleted]
Just read the rules then?
We don't know if athletes are exactly the same when coming back from covid. Remember cam newton? What if Lamar Dobbins and Cambell aren't 100%? I'm nervous AF after what happened to the steelers Hawks and Green Bay
">remember cam newton?

no. who's that"
I've thought of this. Some come back fine some like Ryquell Armstead dont come back at all. If Lamar tested negative and was asymptomatic he should be fine but some of these players will be more tired than usual
"Well, we will see in a hour won’t we?"
I think we kinda know the short term effects of it but long term is the unknown so he should be fine if he went through proper screening
"For what it’s worth, from what I’ve heard Lamar reported having no symptoms (which means nothing in terms of possible long term effects, I know) and thus was working out on his own the whole time he was on the list. So he should at least still be in good shape."
I thought I was on /r/nfl and this was going to be a Kelvin Benjamin setup.
"No one is overlooking this uncertainty.  Fox led its coverage with it, and Jay Glazer talked about Campbell specifically."
I am always nervous AF.
I think this rule of thinking can be taken to anyone in general. But athletes are asked to do a hell of a lot more than the average person.
Good thing we’re playing the cowboys.
"The big guys worry me, Lamar I feel wouldn’t be as big a worry as a 300 lbs dude."
Lamar wasn’t great pre Covid this year. It can only go up

Hopefully they “ICE UP ❄️” tonight !!!

">Tells punt team to stay on the sideline

>Scores TD on 4th down

That's my quarterback"
Ah man a Healthy Ravens team would have 100% beat the steelers last week.
LJ Fort is so solid. Can't believe he was just on his couch
"LAMAR SAID NO

LAMAR CALLS HIS OWN NUMBER

LAMAR SCORES

ABSOLUTE LEGEND"
"JUMP FOR IT YOU FUCKING LAWN GNOME

Brown has no catch radius. That's a ball any other receiver catches, it's not even like it was particularly high or out front"
Aikmen shut ur bitch mouth
Lamar just carried the team down the field and all you all will remember is that throw on third down
Lamar waving off the punt team and scoring a TD is __________________
"HOW CAN YOU HAVE AN ILLEGAL FORMATION PENALTY ON OFFENSE WEEK AFTER WEEK, FOR THE PAST 5 WEEKS.

HOW.

SOMEONE PLEASE IM LOSING MY MIND, HOW CAN YOU STILL NOT FIX THIS ERROR."
Props to Dalton that ball was fucking CHUCKED
It's so nice and refreshing to see Lamar taking lanes and running when the defense has given it to him tonight. Felt like he's been a bit hesitant to do so earlier in the year.
Lmao seeing Queen actually try to get to Dalton through 6 blockers all by himself was hilarious
Lamar should attend the Peyton Manning passing academy over the offseason.
We are so lucky we are playing an awful team tonight
Rolling out right on a short field to a side with 1 receiver makes absolutely no sense
Troy Aikman sounds depressed talking about the Cowboys defense.
JK “Easy money” Dobbins
"Listen, I'm still not sold on Greg Roman, but tonight, he ran the football, and for that I'm thankful."
"Games that have felt like 2019

Week 1 

Week 2 

Week 4

Week 5 

This game"
The Ravens nearly put up 300 rushing with a chunk of the O-line injured.  I’d say Dallas is pretty damn bad defensively lmao
"Harbs: ""we probably shouldn't handshake on national TV""

OMG IM DED"
I feel like pulling Dez Bryant was a conspiracy.
"So weve got snead, dez, and mandrews out. Marquise is shit, and duvernay gets one pass per game. Ingram averages 1.7 ypc and he starts. What the fuck are we doing?"
This game is drunk.
For real lamars mechanics have dropped he fixed last year
"Tucker boots past the endzone.

""fuck if Im doing any more tackling tonight"""
Next Monday is the season pretty much. Don't see 10-6 being good enough this year.
"I get that we live and die by the turnover, but sometimes we should focus on tackling first."
Really sucks that even with a spotty Lamar we woulda beat the steelers last week
DOBBINS SENT ME TO THE PLAYOFFS I LOVE YOU
I swear this sub breaks down any time the opposing offense gets a first down lmaooo yall some goons
"Is there any player in recent memory who exemplifies “play like a Raven” less than Hollywood Brown? Soft, selfish, stupid."
Queen held that with his middle fingers. That man is greatness in the making
what’s with the illegal formation penalties EVERY FUCKING GAME
Okay 4 sad Cowboys with Tuesday’s Gone playing in the background was my favorite shot of this game lol
Gus is hands down the most underrated RB in the league shit ain’t even close
Dalton and 4th & Long is somehow automatic vs the Ravens
#INJECT LAMAR INTO MY VEINS
"Tucker misses, Boykin scores, and Dez quits football all in 1 night!!! What a weird time"
We got robbed of an INT
Let's start this next drive with Dobbins....how about that.
Tucker missing was just his 500 IQ knowing that it would put us in better position to score a TD. Absolute GOAT.
"y’all can shit on Campbell all you want i’ll praise him for being the only one to actually get through, d-line is pathetic right now"
Dallas has one of the worst lines in the NFL and Dalton has 7 seconds to throw a pass
"""Ingram up the middle for 2"" and other phrases heard several times a week"
If we can get a true #1 receiver. Then I believe Hollywood can be a dangerous #2.
The cycle repeats. Zuerline miss
"Two former OSU running backs though the first half of Ravens-Cowboys: - @sgellison


J.K. DOBBINS:

* 5 rushes
* 51 yards
* 10.2 average

EZEKIEL ELLIOTT:

* 10 rushes
* 53 yards
* 5.3 average
* 1 catch, -4 yards"
Get ingram the fuck out hfc.
With how dominate Wolfe has been. Keep Calais off the field until he’s more healthy.
Omg Peters
I will never not be annoyed by Buck/Aikman calling a game like they're on Dallas radio
Dalton and Long. PTSD
"I’ve said it since Lamar took over. 

We NEED big WRs with large a catch radius. Lamar has always been inconsistent with his accuracy and we will continue to live with it. 

So I’ll never understand why we went with the *smallest* of the speedsters in the 2019 draft."
Joe Buck is apparently the antichrist.
We have been called for illegal formation more times than Greg Roman has called a screen pass
Anyone else notice how well Bowser was timing the snap count on that last drive?
"I love Wink, but it feels like the defense has been struggling with wide open receivers quite a bit."
This man is still crying about that missed call
That wasn’t a good team drive. But it was a very good Lamar Jackson drive.
I think that Lamar will be able to turn the passing around. He just is not comfortable with no off-season.
Marcus Peters got cleared out on that play
Marcus Peters been BBQ chicken the last couple of months
Hensley: Baltimore cracks 30 points for first time since Oct. 18.
That was definitely not OPI guys lol. Marlon just got beat.
no more ingram snaps please
Not the worst half of football we’ve played.
For a team who blitz’s so fucking much you would think we would get some sacks out of it
we need ricard.. I'm not even joking
"hollywood slowing down, realizing the situation to turn up field, track the ball and make the catch 

👌👌"
The announcers are so far up the Cowboys asses
SECONDARY SO SOFT WTH
The defense has three total sacks since week 9
Honestly did anyone really expect Lamar to look sharp coming off of covid and not playing in over two weeks? I think he’s played great considering the circumstances
"This is the Lamar paradox:

Boykin was wide open and he missed what turned out to be an easy throw after he did really well to buy time.

Yet, he'll do stuff like that Hollywood TD throw where he was throwing into a tight window while running left.

He's our QB and our MVP, but I'm dying for some passing consistency from him."
"Game hasn't even started and it's going bad. Shouldn't be played if covid is back.

I can't even drink because I work in the morning, but fuck it I might."
>Yea I’m going to go ahead and call it a quit for the rest of the season... I can’t deal with this - @DezBryant
#Marquise Brown is now back to being known as WR #15
Smh 9 missing the tackle. That bum
"If this was 2019, we score that touchdown, special teams pins them inside the 15, defense forces a punt, and offense drives down the field again for another touchdown, rinse and repeat."
Illegal formation ✅
How in the FUCK do we have illegal formations every FUCKING game
It’s very concerning we don’t have a sack against the Cowboys O-Line...
Y'all are horny as hell
Calais needs to stay out. Get healthy.
Can we please use Dobbins? Please?
Andy Dalton continuing to chuck to wide open wideouts standing still without a ravens anywhere close to them. It’s a joke.
Patrick ricard is a fucking concrete wall
Y’all realize Lamar practiced 1 time in 2 weeks right?
That is a ridiculously bad spot are you fucking kidding me?
Of fucking course. A no call and then they get the TD on 4th down. Fuck off
>Dobbins is in for a 5-yard TD to put this game away. Ravens 294 yards rushing is a season high. - @jeffzrebiec
"32nd ranked rushing defense is right

This is where I would Super sim to avoid injuries
"4th and 19. Most teams: Stops them.

Ravens: lol nah"
"Harbs
""We can't shake hands on National TV"""
I love how the first thing I see in this game thread is someone commenting how our defense sucks because we gave up one first down. Sums up these threads.
"#Love that Lamar was like ""keep the fucking kicking squad off the field!"" Then scores a TD lol."
It's becoming really obvious that the Ravens are winning in spite of Greg Roman rather than because of him
Fuck these commentators
#Joe buck u cocksucker
That HAS to be in the running for the worst announcer jinx of all time
Justin Tucker intentional miss very cool
"Holy shit, did we just scheme a receiver open!?!?"
Everyone talking about the illegal formation but no one's mentioning how brown couldn't catch that inbounds 0 field awareness
"Difference between the obviously noticeable burst on Dobbins vs Ingram is the difference between the burst of Dobbins vs Me. 

I dont have much burst fellas."
"Just don't tip it to AJ Green, Ihedigbo!"
The whole fucking defense really didn't even jump to contest. Are you srs.
Not one raven jumped lmao
We may as well approach this game as if the Cowboys were the old Bengals.
I sure hope we win this game by more than 3 points. That was a horrible no-call.
"Come on Lamar, that was an awful throw why are you dropping your elbow there..."
"160* yards rushing in the first half. Run it once and then pass twice on your opening possession to start the half, causing a three and out."
Ew that release was.... Ew
Calais walking menacingly towards Dalton
"This reffing is ass, missing calls on both us and dallas"
"Why are we not running Dobbins, I specifically requested it."
WHY IS INGRAM STILL PLAYING ROMAN???? WHY???
Greg must be allergic to dobbins I fucking swear
I’m going to say it. I think Dobbins will be better than Rice
"What a fucking throw, and what a catch. That's what souljas do! More of that please"
Where is the pass rush? Can we get a sack please?
Dez just retweeting people with their glasses of wine lol
Can we make the Bus a raven lifer? He’s so consistent in playing hard
Wide open Boykin and he bounces it in front of him. Goddammit. Doesn’t matter in this game but that will lose games against real teams
That is a generous first down
Aikman sounds so sad
The secondary is sleeping on 3rd/4th down alot this year
Team looks like half the players had a respiratory virus recently
I'm so pissed off. It's just unfortunate he warmed up. He was around everyone. Dez heal up. You seem like a smart man soni imagine you wore your mask and it didnt spread but football gods give us a fucking break
"Steelers blown 10 point lead

Patriots monsoon when we get the ball in the 4th quarter

Top run defenders getting injured before facing Derick Henry

Titans blown lead

Entire team getting COVID

Luke Wilson dropped go ahead TD against the 11-0 Steelers

Every wild card potential team winning, two at the last second on lucky plays

**--> YOU ARE HERE**

Dez bryant gets Covid triggering a second team outbreak 

Ravens miss the playoffs"
I guess we're going for herd immunity at this point
Why are they using a test notorious for false positives 30 minutes before a game? Fuck this. I wanted Dez tonight.
"Why can’t we fucking enjoy one game dammit

We’re fucking cursed"
"Oh my god, I forgot holding could be called on the team playing us."
Fuck me Dez out with Covid. I hope it's a false positive so he doesn't have it. If it is I'm gonna be choked he isn't in the game.
I'm a straight dude and I never missed a man in my life the way I missed Lamar Demeatrice Jackson
Bad throw but also bad effort there by brown
Can we remember that Dobbins exists now?
This season has been wasted by... GREG ROMAN. Enjoy
look at that hold on Chris Board clear as day
"No offense to my short kings out there, but I sincerely hope we draft a WR next year that’s the size of an adult human"
Good thing they have dalton who literally ONLY plays well against the ravens
The architect? Dude couldn’t design a shed.
Fuck you Joe Buck
Madden cursed our whole damn season
"was all part of tucker's huge brain play

truly playing chess while other kickers playing checkers"
Boykin/Duvernay/Snead>>>>>>Hollywood
Just realised. If saunders wasnt a fucking idiot dez wouldve played tonight FUCK SAUNDERS
Boykin looked like he was actually attacking the defense there for once.
Not so funny when it happens to the Cowboys is it Troy?
JESUS CHRIST ROMAN THAT PLAY HASN'T GOTTEN POSITIVE YARDS ALL YEAR STOP CALLING IT.
We do run the same plays too much.
How many goddamn illegal formation penalties have we had this year fuck
Im so sick of illegal formation penalties
NO RAVEN JUMPED FOR IT????
Lmao that hail mary defense was shit
[deleted]
JK Dobbins and Gus Edwards are both averaging over ten yards a carry. Not sure how Dallas has a chance if that stays the case in the 2nd half.
[LMAO look at this tweet that ryan mink deleted](https://twitter.com/eazy_ei/status/1336479917123440640?s=21)
"Ugh, knock it off with that sidearmed bullshit"
Lamars gotta make that throw.
Man our pass rush blows
Why is Ingram getting carries. Legitimately do not get it
Lamar my man you are a bi polar passer
That is a fucking sight for sore eyes. MVP shit those past 2 plays
"One of the main problems I have had with our WR core is that they really struggle on the scramble drill, Lamar has trouble finding them after the play breaks down. But  that TD to Hollywood was exactly what we need"
"Throws like that make it obvious that Lamar *can* make great throws, and anyone who actually watches him knows that. He just needs to keep working on the mechanics to make the easier throws more consistently"
"I’m so glad he caught that. Y’all been trashing him cause he’s our WR1 but isn’t a WR1. Isn’t that more on GM, coaching and management? He can still be a stud while not being WR1 talent."
The talent is there. Just needs more time to develop. A conventional offseason would definitely help....fucking COVID....
Man I’ve missed this energy from Lamar all year it feels like. He’s at his best when he’s having fun out there.
WHY THE FUCK YOU GONNA CALL A ROLLOUT TO THE RIGHT WITH ONLY ONE RECEIVER GOING TO THE RIGHT
"""They're hot, I like 'em.""  
Joe Buck confirmed for foot guy"
Absolutely no chance he had that first down. What??
This teams not doing shit against a playoff team with this pass rush.
# FORT CAUGHT IT
This sub has the memory of a goldfish. Peters had a great game last game. He was the best player in one of our games earlier this season. I would like to know who we could replace him with
He was down for like 5 seconds wtf are they smoking lmao
"I'm greedy and want another touchdown.

Fuck the refs, and fuck the Cowboys."
Mark Ingram seems like the perfect mentor for Dobbins.
So nice finally seeing Lamar and the offence having fun on the sidelines for once this season
Wolfe is our Unsung Hero
>The Ravens' 294 rushing yards are more than they had in any game last season. They ran for 285 when they blew out the Rams. - @jonas_shaffer
Lol andy dalton on fourth down
Fort holding down the...fort.
I thought we learned JK was out best RB already.
can we please just fucking use dobbins
Why have souljas when they cant even run forward?
What the point of having Soulja’s if they can’t catch
"Well, we are who we thought we were"
At leat held em to a fg
"Fans: Use JK Dobbins, he’s a 100 yrd per game back 
Roman: No, I don’t think I will"
"Did y’all see Bozeman just kneeling with the TD signal up


He already knew once Lamar was gone"
Tucker literally saved a td man
"Why does this always happen to us lmao 


Defence makes a clutch stop and the offence chokes


Offence starts cooking and defence chokes"
How was there no holding there.
Why is Brown our WR1
Troy is trying to jinx tucker so bad
FUCK JOE BUCK
Lol im out like dez
We really fucking iced ourselves
"☑ Tipped interception

☑ Big kick return

☑ Rare Tucker miss

All the BS coming against us"
This is kind of a shit show
Dude how does Brown not get his feet in bounds is this a joke.
Dead honest what's the fucking record for illegal formations in a single season
Can someone send roman a chart of legal formations?
What's the point of trading for Yannick if he's going to be this quiet?
Cowboys fans have the right to be pissed on that one
Troy so quick to start whining when the Cowboys don't get a call
Anyone else just get fucking Dalton 4th down hail mary flashbacks or was or just me
I feel like we should’ve rushed some more there like only rushing one is kinda useless
Dalton on 4th down to a big wr with everyone in coverage is what Ravens nightmares are made of
pretty weird half all around tbh
Pass rush has to start gettin home. He has all the time in the world
We’re playing with less heart than when 60% of our team was out
"Thoughts:

1) OMG how is it not even 6m into the 3rd quarter. 

2) Lamar has got to get his mechanics back on point. His side arm all the time shit is hurting the team. 

3) The lack of pass rush is really something. Even with Calais still clearly not 100%, this is awful. How is no one able to get pressure even on a blitz?"
Holy fuck Lamar learn to throw
M V FUCKING P. SUCK MY FUCKING DICK.
That’s all on Hollywood.  Great play by him. Credit where credit is due
"that was beautiful. Great throw, great catch. Everything perfect"
It's crazy how LJ can misthrow the the easy passes but drops a dime like that.
"So he sometimes struggles with pocket throwing but running to the left and throwing on the run to a tight corner is perfect, got it"
Can we get the practice squad defense back from last week?
Lamar had that 1st. Poor spot
Dobbins and Gus need to be here for a while lol
LAMAR IS HAVING FUN AND SMILING!! This is a good sign people!
"Petition to change JK Dobbins nickname to ""Easy Money"""
101 yds for the Bus. 14.4 ypc!!
Aikman is about to cry lol
Keep in mind lamar hasn’t played in two weeks and is without Mandrews and Snead. Rust was expected in the passing game and we still up 17
PTSD
"This league is a shambles. How do they randomly identify Dez for testing 30mins prior to kickoff? He’s been around the team, who else may have it? And now they’re still gonna play the game? Could it be a false-positive? Just baffling."
This is so fucking stupid.  The NFL is so fucking delusional.  I can't believe they are going to play this game after pulling a positive player off the field during warmups.
"I already know how this is gonna go. The offense is gonna be flat, give the ball up constantly and in bad positions. The defense is still gonna play well tho and keep us in it. Then the offense will wake up and we'll make a comeback, but once we need a stop from the D they'll break bc they've been out there all night."
"the only time he ever misses is when announcers have to run their mouths

# SHUT THE FUCK UP"
I'm glad that FOX does the little +6 graphic I always forget how much touchdowns are worth.
We should trade for Yannick so we can get some pass rush
"Hey Steelers, this is how you beat a shitty NFCE team"
I would Thanos-snap half this sub just to get Erin Andrews to kiss me on the cheek
Literally just saw a tweet about Dez hugging all the cowboys coaches
Not to sounds so negative but if our team catches another case of COVID we may lose a game down the stretch and things may be over for us. This is fucked on all types of levels
fort dawged him bruh
The way Fort just tossed Zeke and walked away was so badass.
fort might be the most underrated pickup we've had in years
Let’s hope this is the turning point where Lamar goes from decent back to legend for 2020
"I love ingram, but I dont want him taking any snaps really."
god damn so sick of these inside draws with Ingram for 1 yard. Waste of a down
[deleted]
Roman needs to go right now he has coached the skill out of the offense. I literally can’t believe the shit I’m seeing week after week
I hate Greg Roman
Holding on yannick...
No longer the Madden Curse. It’s the Roman Curse.
Can we just have Lamar call the offense
**How TF was that not holding??**
Tucker 🐐 with some tackling highlight reel material
I feel bad for Wink the other parts of the team constantly putting him in bad situations
So Lamar gets on the board and ST shit the bed? Fuck cmon man!
"Okay Tucker, no more freebees. Put the next on in the end zone."
Marlon is guarding for 4 seconds with no pressure with no safety help with Gallup having half a field to work with. That rarely goes well for the DB
This is the vaunted Ravens defense *cries*
A smart OC would mix play action in there but what do I know 🤷🏽‍♂️
"I’m not a superstitious person but... THAT WASNT TUCKERS FAULT, IT WAS JOE BUCK"
"Relationship ended with ‘Soulja’, Boykin is my new king."

Tucker with the big brain play missing a fg for the sake he knew we'd get a TO resulting in a TD
The announcers sound so unimpressed and bored when the Cowboys aren’t scoring
We need a team of all 7’0 receivers
when dalton throws deep against us... that's some ptsd type shit
bro both teams icing their own kickers lol
Joe buck is a field goal killer
"Yeah, Dallas fans, we know how that feels"
"Holy shit hahah both QB's throw a pick, both kickers miss a FG, does that mean we're due for a big kickoff return?"
"Deion Sanders, the legendary Baltimore Raven"
Tbh i think Roman is gone after this season
"y'all notice yannick has done nothing, like at all?"
"Andy is not a crybaby, he got right back up. repstec"
And that is why Gregg Williams sends pressure.
Andy throwing a hail mary against us im getting ptsd
We know Dalton’s superpower is throwing hail Mary’s against the Ravens. He almost did it again.
Dez's Twitter right now... shit's wild
[Dez confirmed he's coming back](https://twitter.com/DezBryant/status/1336496497769197569)
"Go Ravens!!!!

- Giants fan"
I wish some of our missed calls were focused on as much as they're hanging on to that miscall
I keep making excuses for why the team is doing bad like the poor o line play or our weapons being bottom of the league tier... Then lamar makes a throw like that
Seriously these mechanics should be better by now
Anyone else unreasonably annoyed by that red spot on Daltons nose?
Lamar just hasn’t thrown with confidence with proper arm action most of the season. When he does you see flashes of his very good arm strength and zip/location.
Holding?
Campbell blocked in the back right at the refs feet
"That was a blind side block on campbell, towards the line of scrimage..."
Dallas bailing us out more than us playing well tbh.
its almost like Tucker says this place is a tough place to kick or something
We’re kinda fucked for next year cuz we shouldn’t really pay judon or ngakoue but also our pass rush would be terrifyingly worse without them
Get Ingram out of the fucking game we need to end this
Why are we still rushing Ingram....just stop.
Ingram looks fucking fried please get him off the field
If there is ever an injury on the field in a Ravens game there is a 95% chance it is a Raven
WOW AN ACTUAL EXCELLENT THROW AND CATCH
#WR #15 will now go back to being known as Hollywood Brown!!!!
HOLY SHIT WHAT A THROW AND CATCH 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Bollywood a couple good games away from getting his nickname back
"SOULJA BOY UP IN THAT HO 
WATCH ME CRANK IT WATCH ME ROLL"
"So did Brown improvise there? Cuz if so, I like it and fuck Greg Roman."
Lamar channeling his inner Flacco this season. Making the easy passes look hard and the hard passes look easy.
Remember this is 4th quarter ravens defence. No lead is safe
Justin Tucker put a hex on Zurlein I’m convinced
"[HISTORIC. @Lj_era8 becomes the FIRST player in NFL history with 5,000+ pass yards and 2,500+ rush yards in his first 3 seasons. #RavensFlock - @SNFonNBC](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Eow-aV-WEAIBwsj.jpg)"
What the fuck!  That was absolutely NOT a first down!
That was NOT a first down
That was a stupid generous spot for Zeke’s catch.
LJ Fort is a top 3 importance on our defense.
Harbaugh’s arm broken or something? Call a fucking challenge dude
LJ Fort should have an INT.
This team is legit all over the place. If we could just clean up the dumb shit we’d be close to scary good. But we been saying this since week 5 so I doubt it
The Dallas Cowboys kickoff fielding team is a collection of very stupid individuals
#STUNT. ON. THEM. HOES
That drive was purely run right?
"The greatest sadness: We'll end the game on 294 rushing yards probably, and not crack 300. 😭"
EZ 💰
Wolfe has been fantastic
>Gus Edwards now over 100 yards for the game - @jeffzrebiec
That shot was dirty from the start but they didn't need to gaze at those sad men for so long lol
"im so confident that we can send the steelers home if we make it there

but im not confident we can get there"
That hug with Lamar and Jefferson was adorable
"Erin Andrews makes football cleats for cervical cancer and the announcer’s response is “they’re hot”. Dude, they’re football cleats. For cancer."
"Lmao talking about tucker being automatic, now he’s gonna miss

Edit: FUCKING CALLED IT"
THE MONSTERS ARE ALL FULLY BACK AND THE COWBOYS HAVE 1 STARTING OFFENSIVE LINEMAN
The game is not going to be canceled. Stop acting like the league cares about player or coach safety.  The owners are in the box they dont give a fuck
Dez has to be a rapid test false positive right?
Never discount Dalton in ruining our playoffs chances...
It's the first drive guys holy smokes. Our defense always adjusts and comes back stronger
"Good play, LJ!"
Fuck Fox News
"Cowboys receivers- can catch even behind tmy back

Brown- ill tip the ball right in front of my fucking face. 

Fucking bum"
"Rewatching the play, that ball wasn’t catchable, and there’s obvious DPI. Once the interception happens Brown gets blindsided in a hit that would’ve been called had our defense made it."
How often does Roman call a passing play where the receivers run more than 5 yards?
Can Steve do us a favor and just Dump Roman already?
Lamar TD. Everything is right again
Boy I love scoring TDs on 4th down.
That was a fucking MVP play right there
lamar is my dad
Goddamn tucker tried to tackle
Tucker just saved a touchdown
Can we just appreciate Tucker’s effort on this busted coverage
Lol live shot of Board being held by two guys right there.
"You see how other teams can just get receivers open...

Why can't a Harbaugh team do that?"
At least if we lose we can just watch football for fun
How do you DPI and give up the TD
"The players may like Wink, but he constantly leaves the secondary out to dry only for the blitz to get ZERO pressure"
Their average start is on our side of the 50. We got the cobwebs off. 30-17 final Ravens incoming.
Our wr1 looks like he’s 12
"STARES DOWN THE RB, come on man, how about a passing play with some progressions"
Fuck aikman and buck and the lineman
Fumble ✅ interception✅ false start ✅
Fuck Joe Buck. I’m muting rest of the game
Anyone else just see Dalton screaming into the void
That's crazy Queen was able to keep that from hitting the ground
Hollywood would have ran backwards before diving forward for a few more yards when the defender got close to him
"I really hate that my initial reaction to Dalton's reaction was ""Fuck you Andy!""

He doesn't deserve that hostility. He really is a lovely person."
Justin Tucker the goat once again turning 3 into 7
Big brain play by Tucker to let us get an extra 4 points. Very thoughtful
#Balance has been restored.
Mm it’s so sexy to think of my various cardboard cutouts watching that shanked FG attempt
How tf do we keep getting illegal formation penalties. Such a dumb penalty we get all the time
Oh boy another illegal formation call on us. That's what like number 50 on us
Joe Buck tried his best for the Double Jinx there. Fucking scumbag.
Can anyone fucking explain how we get at least 1 illegal formation penalty a game? It blows my mind.
Good job killing another drive with an option toss Roman.
"HOW DO THEY NOT KNOW WHAT THE FUCK THE FORMATIONS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE

&#x200B;

I DON'T think any other team has had that particular penalty called so many god damn times on them in one season"
Remember how we were hyped about Hollywood gaining weight this off-season? Serious question did he shrink?
"dude this is the week Hollywoods finally lost me

its gotten to the point where his lack of effort is killing drives"
Lmao poor Queen. Down there getting his ass whooped
How is Lamb the ONLY guy going up for that ball?
I hate Andy Dalton. Always plays us tough
We're making too many mistakes that we will not get away with next week
i mean... they *almost* had that.
We gotta ground and pound from the start and put this game away
"Averaging 10 yards per run.

3rd and 4: Pass."
WHERES THE FUCKING HOLD
Looked like a first down to me
How is our defense ranked 8th??
">Justin Tucker has said a few times that M&T Bank Stadium is the hardest place to kick in the league ever since they put in the new scoreboard.

>It changed the wind patterns and now it swirls more instead of being a static directional wind. Makes it tough on kickers. - @BrettKollmann"
Why is Ingram still getting touches???
"Gotta be honest, Lamar has looked awful throwing the ball. But god damn do I love that man"
SOULJA SPOTTED!!!!!!
That guy wiping Lamar's visor was gettin' after it
#LAMAR CANT PASS CANT HE!!!?
HOLLYWOOD GETS TO KEEP HIS NAME ANOTHA WEEK
Jackson haters in shambles 🤣
But real talk...we talk shit about Brown but That catch remarkable
"Isn’t it crazy how you can see a few kicks before tucker misses one, that he is going to miss one soon. His kicks will stop being exactly down the middle, then he misses one. Then it resets and he goes back to right down the middle again."
Marquise has to hit the Soulja boi next time he scores
That was the most Lamar drive I've ever seen.
You’d think Troy Aikman was a porn star with how much he’s sucking off the Cowboys
That throw.... what the fuck
Cringe at Troy calling those cleats hot
I miss Sizzle.
Sounds like a cramp from twitter reports
The refs just completely fucked us on 3 straight plays...
#BULLSHIT WTF REFS 😡😡😡
INT robbed from us and then a bullshit PI flag
"Don’t worry about the PI y’all, no one will remember it, just that one hold we got away with earlier."
How are receivers on other teams consistently wide open but Ravens receivers are typically smothered?
"Marcus Peters and getting roasted in clutch situations, name a better duo"
LJ Fort is one of the hardest players on our D easily
"That’s a pick, we should’ve challenged but I have 0 faith that it would’ve been overturned."
Lol Troy aikman is in shambles right now
No fumbles for Zeke. I said that shit was coming - ‘most fumbles’ meets ‘most forced fumbles’ means no fumbles. That shit is just so Ravens.
We definitely got some shit to work on. Glad we got the W tho
WHY do we insist on giving them 10 DAMN YARDS of cushion EVERY PLAY!!!!????
Let’s never play Andy Dalton ever again
Not perfect. But we got the dub and Lamar is smiling. That's enough for this week.
I really thought that Hail Mary was going to happen because it’s Andy Dalton and we’re the Ravens lol
"obviously props to Lamar but that was a good route by Hollywood, that’s the difference a solid receiver corps would make for Lamar"
The NFL has the money to end homelessness and pretending to care is more disgraceful than acting like your better than it
Lets see a peters pick six and a hump punch out for a turnover we score on
As an wft fan pls beat dallas’s ass
uuuuh  [dez has covid??](https://twitter.com/DezBryant/status/1336469570262020102)
Lmao this is just so 2020 its fucked
That's fucked. Glazier says that his test was inconclusive this morning... I wonder what protocol is for inconclusive tests around the league. There must be a clearly set rule (to assume that it's negative) since they let him get all the way to the field. Crazy!
harbs looks so sad :(
Ok I just tuned into this shit. So like why is this game happening if someone just tested positive?
our black jerseys are sexy
"First time all year our Dline has had McPhee, Campbell, Judon, Yannick and B-Will on the field at the same time"
Why is Ingram in
I fucking hate Greg Roman. Get ingram out of there you fucking idiot.
Why he run backwards lmao
Soulja
get rid of brown and ingram please
"Nobody wanted to hear anything about it last year, but we passed on DK Metcalf to take Marquise brown"
Marquise is so bad.
When we throw 2-3 yards passes I seriously don’t understand why we don’t run the ball
So it's 3rd and 5 and we're passing it for two yards? What??
With no Mandrews expect LJ to force it to Marquise like that all game
Someone find Michael Campenaro and offer his Hollywood's job
And of course Zeke having a terrible year but he’s gonna go off on us
I just want to see in my lifetime a stud Ravens WR that we draft
If we don’t see dobbins this game just fire Roman at half time
He’s so fast he makes fast people look not fast
Lamar is an expert at scoring TDs on fourth down
Lamar is back babyyyyyy
"**""Fine, I'll do it myself."" - ~~Thanos~~ Lamar Jackson**

(Although, Brown Jr. and Bozeman were really the ones who made that run possible when they picked up their assignments on the pull.)"
Dallas gives up that nice hole and Lamar punishes that nice hole.
Big hold on Chris Board
thanks for showing the blatant hold
Obvious hold on 49
Kick the fucking ball through the end zone and be done with it. This high kick shit that may allow you to get a stop at the 20 isn’t it
"CEEDEE with a 18 year cushion.......

Edit: yard cushion"
Tucker tried
Tucker really needs to wrap up there /s
wouldn’t it be dope if we were just somewhat consistent
Ngakoue got pushed down from behind man come the fuck on!!
Yea well this architect had been using an engineering scale on accident
Buck and Aikman are saying that Roman is going to stick with the run because it's working so well. I thought announcers were supposed to research the teams they are going to call?
"What the fuck


Who jinx tucker"
Tucker has missed. Hell has taken over
FUCK YOU JOE BUCK
Announcers have some voodoo shit when they say something good about our players
TWENTY TWENTY NEEDS TO END
Did....did Justin Tucker just miss?
"FUCK YOU BUCK AND AIKMAN.

SERIOUSLY. FUCK YOU"
"Yea I’m ready to call it quit for the season too, Dez"
That false start is literally our season in a nutshell. Drive ending penalties taking points off the board.
"Blame the announcers all you want for bullshit make believe hexes. 

That miss is on the lineman who jumped on a fucking FG attempt. 

The penalties this year are unreal."
"“Queen is trash”

Lmao shut the fuck up."
"Huge big brain plays by Tucker

+4 points"
"Fuck yeah

You jinx the GOAT we take that personally"
Boykin is better than brown. Dont @ me
"Any of yall bashing Lamar's throw, its clear he was trying to lead Boykins forward. Boykins slowed up a little early."
How about a Zeke fumble
"In a span of 49 seconds ...

- Justin Tucker misses 36-yard FG (ending streak of 70 straight inside 40)

- Patrick Queen makes first career interception

- Lamar Jackson hits Miles Boykin for 38-yard TD

Ravens ahead, 14-10, midway through second quarter. - @jamisonhensley)"
Peters is so scared of getting burnt he's giving up a lot of cushion. Adjust!
"gonna say it again, we can never have our offense and defense show up at the same time this year"
This is some voodoo shit joe buck is actually cursed
There must be a nasty wind there or something
2 minute drill. I expect 3 pts minimum.
Anyone know why the clock started up again after the delay of game? Seems weird to me.
"See, if Tucker misses a field goal, you know the is wind is fucking bad."
These car commercials crack me up. Yes honey Im surprising you with a 70 thousand dollar truck. Enjoy the payments!!
LOL this team is going to set a single-season record for illegal formation penalties
It's gotta be a record for most illegal formations in a row
Greg Roman do you know what a fucking formation is jesus
"Yes yes, every week like clockwork. Coaches should be ashamed of those illegal formation penalties."
JOE BUCK SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT TUCKERS KICKS ALREADY
the penalty makes it irrelevant but that was such a bad play by hollywood. no fundamentals at all
"Ravens and illegal formation calls, name a more iconic duo"
illegal\_formation?\_ill\_do\_that\_again\_goofy\_meme.jpg
Lol got away with one there
Jesus I got some aj green vibes
We got lucky
None of our defenders felt like jumping there lol
I hate prevent defense
if you are curious about how the coaches views Queen’s coverage ability he was the only one rushing in a hail mary situation.
Dallas has the worst rated everything - why isn't this 50-0?
About 9 players were in the vicinity of the ball and lamb was the only one that jumped to catch it
Let's be honest.  Even if he does catch that.  He would be dead before he secured it.
The score may say otherwise but the defense hasnt been that great today
Dez pulling some mental gymnastics on Twitter to confuse everyone
Troy Aikman looks like he doesn’t give crack any breaks.
UGHHHHH. What happened to Lamar's mechanics
Wtf Lamar come on dude
Lamar looks closer to his 2018 form than his 2019 form
Yannick getting held by guy off the street
We are not gonna have a single sack against a horrible o line. Wow.
"can we just sub-in the D-lineman we used last week, it's obvious Calais isn't healthy yet"
"Zuerlein small boy, Tucker big boy"
"Fuck these medical dramas, they all look so corny"
Ingram for 2 is such a sad standard
Ingram for 2 yards heard that one before
I love Ingram but dude can’t hit the hole or do down hill running anymore. Please stop using him as the rb1.
take a shot every time ingram carries for 1 yard on first down.
Dobbins and Gus are cooking. Let’s send out Ingram.
Waiting for the season-ending Greg Roman injury.
"EVERY FUCKING FIRST DOWN RUN BY INGRAM HE HITS THE MIDDLE OF THE PILE 1 YARD PAST THE LINE OF SCRIMMAGE AND GOES DOWN. CAN WE PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE FUCKING STOP WITH THIS PLAY CALL. DOBBINS AND GUS HAVE CARRIES OF 30 + YARDS. INGRAM COULDNT GET TO 30 YARDS WITH 30 CARRIES."
Steve Smith showed how Roman runs the exact same plays on every team he went to with zero adjustments. If that ain’t reason enough to move tf on....
"Dobbins for a big gain, time to bench him."
One of his best throws of the season. Great job
We can call him Hollywood again
Alright Greg. Lets have a chat. IF THEY CAN FUCKING DO THAT WHY ARENT YOU CALLING IT MORE
I still believe in hollywood brown.
r/nfl thread has now been silenced
Weird how all our best passing plays are from receiver improv and not Romans play calling
Peters got submarined
Wink really does a great job of masking how awful our pass rush is
"Dez’s twitter feed is great, i feel bad for him"
PAT RICARD REALLY BITCHED THAT GUY HOLY SHIT LMAOO
Rare run of negative yards for dobbins
also the Spanish announcers are better if the regular fox sports announcers are their usual dogshit
STOP FUCKING ROLLING YOU SHITS
Lamar looks like he is enjoying the game at least
feelin a little bad for boykin tonight. that's 2 on lamar that he coulda had
"This game has been great

Lamar sacked 0 times 

Boykin and Hollywood looking good

250 rushing yards"
Generous spot..
Looks like they're picking on Averett.
Guys Lamar just had walkthrough for this game lets chill for a minute
Lj is the unsung hero of this defense
Keep trashing the D but that's the first TD on a full length drive this game for the cowboys
"No pass rush, overrated pass defense, and shit tackling better clean this shit up or Browns might hang a 40 piece next week"
"Dallas. You are embarrassing yourself.

Proche is 1000% down, lol."
"Clearest onside recovery of all time.

Fuck off Dallas."
We need to re sign Gus ASAP
JK rb1 is a hill imma die on for the rest of the season. good win tonight boys. get better dez
Its so nice when lamar plays. I seriously don't remember us scoring under 20 anymore. Normally around 27+ mark. Its not always pretty but God damn this offense consistently puts up big points
All this sad yee-haw music makes me giggle
Just panning in on the shame at the end lmao
"I hope we can do this next week, CLE won’t be a cake walk"
HUGE Win. Lamar knocked some of the rust off. LFG!!! On to Cleveland!!
"4h and long, let's blitz our best cb"
Happy Lamar makes me happy
"This offense is broken.

Even if that pass had been caught, it had zero chance of getting a first.

This is after using Ingram over Dobbins, which is indefensible, and after 2 or 3 motions for a 4-yard pass.

wut"
hARbAuGh wAs a SpEciAL TeAms CoAch
"i dont wanna play another game on fox with joe buck again

devil type shit going on"
"Second half bingo:
- Greg Roman taking dobbins out of the game
- Pass pass pass punt 3 & out
- Awful 4th down call
- Andy Dalton 4th & Long 
- Dropped INT"
"Fuck you, Joe Buck."
">Tell me why they pull me from warming up so I can go get tested... my shit come back positive...  I tested positive for Covid WTF - @DezBryant

>Interesting. Bryant was not on the field for the team warmups. - @jeffzrebiec"
Lmao what kinda protocols do they have that someone tests positive like 30 mins before the game starts
DAMN BRO I WANTED TO SEE THE X TONIGHT! 😭
tired of this bullshit season
Fox’s whole broadcast plan just went in the trash because Dez isn’t out there. Man it’s like he and the team are cursed.
"Okay they got a first down, fire harbaugh, Jackson, Roman and DeCosta"
Y’all see Dez’s tweet from a few minutes ago? He basically said he quits...
Get ingram off the fucking field
"Marquise doing the usual run back towards where the ball was throw from, lol. Its like an instinct."
Why did Brown run backwards? Fight for yardage and don't be soft.
Dobbins having a year but all we see is Ingram. We really need a young OC
Too much ingram already
damn good job soulja
"i'm so fucking sick of Brown, he's a fucking Bust, just admit it and move-on, stop tanking games for him"
"Man, we would have had a run like that....if Dobbins got the start"
"Brown just shows no effort, never seen him try to catch a ball that wasnt placed perfectly"
"Hey look, a pass slightly behind but the receiver still brings it in. Does brown know that’s a possibility?"
Greg “Who the fuck is JK Dobbins” Roman
The ball wasn’t catchable because Hollywood is tiny. If that was Dez it would be a catch. Which leads back to the point HOW DID WE FIELD AN OFFENSE IN THE OFFSEASON ADDING NO WEAPONS
Hey GR I like Ingram as a person but JK is better rn use him.
"On this week's episode of: 

Let's see how quickly the defense fatigues due to the offense's bullshit"
"Ravens receivers tonight:

Marquise Brown (5’9” 1st round pick)

Miles Boykin (3rd round pick with 351 career yards)

Devin Duvernay (3rd round rookie with 199 yards)

James Proche (6th round rookie)

Luke Wilson (practice squad rookie TE)

Eric Tomlinson (practice squad rookie TE)"
LOOK AT THAT WE GIVE IT TO SOMEONE BESIDES INGRAM AND WE GET YARDS
BLACK ON BLACK LOOKING 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
THERES THAT 2019 RAVENS PLAY CALL
This game better be a huge confidence boost for everyone!!
So basically if it's 4th and 2 you always run it with lamar. TD every time
Lmao bradley bozeman
Lol Was that Bozeman signaling TD 3 steps into that run?
The best part of that is Bozeman at the line the entire way lmao
"Here I am saying to my TV screen ""Don't go for it on 4th and 2, just kick the 54 yard field goal or whatever it is, Tucker can tie this up, the offense, who the hell knows!""  Shows what I know!"
We can thank tucker for that no TD
Special teams what the fuck?
That sums up the 2020 Ravens right there.
Okay it's not OPI but that's a horrible PI call
Marlon choking as announcers are singing his praises. Smh
How come when we play a team that struggles in certain areas they become gods at it against us?
Hollywood is a very solid 2 or 3 option. But we need to get a real wr 1 to let him shine
Again any one being a doomer we were down 14 last night. Remember that
High af in my abode in downtown dallas and thinking about going to 7/11 to flex my lamar jersey
Honestly these past few weeks our O-Line has been very good. Great news considering Stanley is out for the year.
"""They've proven they can run it up the middle, I don't know why the Ravens would do anything else.""

Greg Roman . . ."
He fucking jinxed it . Dickhead
Fuck.
its ok tucker we still love u
knew he was gonna miss lmao
Roman has the be the most brain dead OC i ever saw
Fucking announcer jinx my god
Are we really about to beat ourselves again 😩
Dude this madden curse is fucking next level this year hoooooooly shit
"I don’t believe in jinxes, but that’s some voodoo bullshit if I’ve ever seen it"
I’m not mad at Tucker. Bozeman fucked up that first perfect one.
"Justin Tucker is so good that he purposely missed the FG so that we could get 7.

Big brain goat."
BAH GAWD THATS BOYKINS MUSIC
"Alright, we've toyed with them enough.  Time to pour it on."
The fact that this abysmal ass cowboys team gets to have prime time games for half of their season every year is criminal.
Where’s the guy who was in here calling Queen trash? Game day thread gotta be the most reactionary shit ever lol
"I just want to **single out the Fox music supervisor**. I am **loving** the Grateful Dead, Widespread Panic playlist!

Throw some Greensky Bluegrass, Trampled by Turtles and make fun of Phish while you're at it!"
"Please, for the love of all that is holy, let's keep SOME momentum here. Tired of this swing shit."
"Offense is sleep Defense is awake. Offense is awake, defense falls asleep lol"
Wolfe is definitely one of the most underrated Ravens
"Offense: *starts doing well*

Defense: lol wut do"
"Wink's pass defense is sucking ass tonight.

Dudes just wide open."
These fucking announcers jinxed both kickers. Lol
Jesus two missed FGs after a penalty. Who’s at b dubs?
Tuesday games are cursed.
Why did the clock still run after the delay of game?
"11 point lead at half, get ball back and score again to start the second half. Make it happen."
hopefully Lamar trusts Boykin more
Roman please use dobbins as RB1
"Uh, that kind of penalty is... what the fuck?

Does #25 on the Cowboys even know how to play football? That ball wasn't catchable probably but the refs called that because Willson was MAULED."
"God damnit our weekly illegal formation foul, fucking shambolic and amateur. Every week!"
Our weekly illegal formation penalty
How are we always drawing illegal formations?
"ILLEGAL FORMATION.

DRINK!"
How do the coaches not see illegal formation calls every game as a problem
Joe Buck trying so hard for the three-peat
Boykin > brown
How many illegal formations are we going to see until Harbaugh realizes the offense is fucking broken with Roman.
I cant stand how much of a bum brown is
GIVE DOBBINS THE BALL... THIS IS NOT HARD!!!!
So sick of the illegal formations every week
My girlfriend always jokingly asks if Hollywood is Marques Brownlee and I’m pretty sure he’d be an upgrade
Roman brain transplant petition
Harris has been solid these past couple weeks.
Why Does Wink Leave Lamb open every fucking play
That we mostly stonewalled Pittsburgh offense 6 days ago and are now getting shredded by the Dallas Cowboys makes no sense.
Dalton is smart. He's getting the ball out super quick. No time for the Ravens to get a good rush without blitzing.
False start? Hello?
Rush 1 lol
Lamb only one who jumped wtf
"At least Queen was actually trying, could’ve very easily just half assed it. Like the passion there"
Wish we had CD instead of Soulja
Why is Marlo getting so wrecked?
Our secondary playing like booty tonight
Need to score on the drive to start the half and start putting this game out of reach.
"Lamar has zero touch on the ball this year. No pressure, receiver is open. Overthrows it."
Jesus lamar sailed it again
That was a horrendous throw. Man...
3rd and 4 with this defense... should have run the ball
Why is hill on the field every 3rd down
Fuck his arm mechanics have regressed. At least his legs mechanic improvements are still intact
Terrible pass
This drive was exactly like that 1 guy described right as the half ended. Roman the predictable lol
Troy is so fucking biased lmao it’s pathetic
"How is that allowed, their linemen just literally tackled our pass rusher as soon as he started to have an angle at Dalton!  Number 78 of the Cowboys just pushed him in the back, knocking him down, when he otherwise had a free shot at Dalton.  That's 100% a penalty, and yet again, no flag."
Where’s the block on the back they did on Campbell?
at the rate our D-Line is playing the only chance we have of touching dalton is at the post game handshake.
cmon lamar redeem yourself
"I really don't get how the refs aren't calling holding on the cowboys O-line, the right tackle especially."
Bro Lamar is out here fixing the o-line because they are gonna get a goddamn illegal formation
Another rush to Ingram up the middle for 2 to fuck us for the next 2 plays
This offense has deep issues. It's an empty stadium so it's no communication  issues they just don't know the plays
Lettssss fucking gooo hell of a catch
Dobbins is the best player on our roster yet Roman doesn’t even fucking know it
I was just kidding about what I said earlier. Hollywood and Lamar are perfect in every way
TD HOLLYWOOD!
#THEY FINALLY SUCCEEDED WITH THAT PLAY YESSSS
Where you clowns talking shit about him 3 seconds ago? You either stick with our guy or you go watch Patrick Mahomes or something
"How's he make that throw, but will overthrow a guy 10 years down field?"
"Where's that throw been all season, damn. What a throw, what a catch!"
Lamar can absolutely throw outside the numbers. He needs a receiver!
LMAO just as I say something about lamar's passing he throws a dime... sorry for doubting you
"This offense is so deadly when Lamar is accurate on his throws. Good instincts by Hollywood, and  GREAT pass man I can't get over how pretty that was."
Wtf was that by Chuck? Soft push lets him get an extra 8 yards
Do we have a sack yet this game?
I feel like our secondary looks the same against every team. They play off and allow 10 yard catches over and over. It’s like deja vu
Obligatory LJ Fort batdown per game ✔️
Damn LJ Fort is having a good game
Let's put this away. I don't feel like being tired tomorrow because the Andy Dalton led Dallas Cowboys made it close and I had to stay up until the last 30 seconds.
Our pass rush sucks we should trade for Yannick Ngakoue
"If we win, Ravens Player of the Week Greg Zurlein"
"F to their kicker, he's getting fired"
Thank God Ricard is okay
HOW ABOUT THAT JINX TROY YOU FUCKING CUNT
"Tucker: *shocking miss*

Zuerlein: Hold my beer."
i really hope we keep gus and dobbins for their careers
"""LET'S FUCKING GOOO!"" Lamar! There are children watching this game! Probably, idk."
Best part about this game I think is that Lamar is finally taking what the defense is giving him on pass plays. He's not trying to force a pass when he can scramble
At least we made the field goal
Lamar def needs work on his passes but his footwork and running has been good this game.
I think Lamar needs a good week of practice. Maddeningly inconsistent tonight
Troy Aikman cleat fetish confirmed
I am sorry but those cleats are ugly as fuck
That was not a first. These fucking refs.
Lol what he was at least a half yard short
There was a holding a couple plays back that prevented a sack.
I will be dejected if Roman is the OC in 2021. Completely tear down and rebuild the offense. Lamar/the O is so close to consistent greatness.
Jamison Hensley tweeted he’s walking around and fine
"I get the realists, I do, we have issues. We aren’t a SB contender. But this sub is so absurdly negative all the time. It’s honestly draining."
Kind of hard to stop them on the goaline for like 8 plays straight
Peters is having an awful year
CAN WE JUST HAVE ONE FUCKING GAME WHERE THE REFS ARE CONSISTENT?
F U C K T H E R E F S
Silver lining is BWill looks great. Blew up three straight runs at the goal line. Wish we had him against Henry
We miss Jimmy Smith badly. The secondary is atrocious when he's out.
Get another TD. Fuck the refs.
Refs trying to F us on the onside kick but then they remember the game is on camera
Proche has great hands. Needs more opportunities in the passing game.
Who else heard Gus hee hee ing
We haven’t abandoned the run and it’s the 4th what is this sorcery
Wonder if they are doing Lamar runs to get his confidence back up
we need need this confidence. next week is gonna be a battle
They are feeling sorry for the cowboys.
"I kinda feel bad for the cowboys

EDIT: JK you morons"
"This was needed, onto Cleveland thinking we basically need to win out one step of the way there , LJ still has many issues he needs to fix, same with the rest of the team but if we are gonna go somewhere it’s gonna be on his back and of course the defense"
"It’s been a month 

But we finally got a win"
Dalton completing a 4th down in the bank? Lol.
"Elliot with the hammer, damn."
"I know some of this was garbage time, but really not thrilled about Andy Dalton going for damn near 300 on this defense"
"This shit was messy, we have 5 days to clean up. Fuck the browns, fuck the Steelers, fuck COVID. MNF we running the table."
This defense definitely doesn't resemble the Ravens defense of old. We don't wrap when we tackle and we don't lay the wood consistently enough to make the offense think twice about testing us
I'M SO FUCKING DONE WITH FOX ANNOUNCERS
Aikman literally crying in the booth
Lamar's fundamentals have gotten so wonky. I swear he didn't throw lazy ass passes like that last year.
Keep in mind Lamar had ONE practice before this game after covid.
"We get back to our roots, and look at that. Our team actually looks like they're having fun for like the second time all year. LET THESE SOULJAS RUN THE BALL AND THEN IT OPENS UP THE PASSING GAME. ITS NOT ROCKET SCIENECE. LET'S GO!!"
Lamar needs to fix the bad throws or else we won’t be able to beat Cleveland
"I think it's time to be honest, this team is mediocre as fuck. We're not bad, but we're not good either."
Hollywood brown actually sucks upvote party
"Jesus fuck, they jinxed the fuck out of that one there"
"This sub in classic fashion, buT wHy ArE wE pAsSiNg??? 


 Because sometimes you have to do that. Especially when the WRs are getting open, like they did on that one. 

Lamar needs to be more accurate."
"Nice job escaping, not so nice job throwing the ball"
"1:30 am but my Ravens are playing

Let’s get this flock"
Dez tested positive for covid 40 minutes before the game
>Saw Ravens GM Eric DeCosta hustle onto the field to talk to Ravens coach John Harbaugh during warmups. I imagine this was the topic. - @jeffzrebiec
"I'm not very smart, but it would seem that if someone tests positive who was already warming up on the field, they have to cancel the game. Am I thinking about this wrong?"
Dez hasn't quit shit hes emotional he said he has done everything right follows a routine and is confused how he got it. This was a huge game for him he is emotional I promise you he will be back no Dez slander hes been a mature fiery leader for a team who should already have leaders. Hes emotional I remember when my work caught it and I worked with 2 people who had it and I was sure I had it I was emotional worried. he will calm down.
What a shit show wow
#Jerry Rigged The Test!!!!
fucking dalton...
LJ Fort making a tackle that I want. Put these fuckers into the grass
Need a 3 TD team galvanizing win
"I dont understand why Ingram is still a feature back when its so blindlingly clear that hes not even the second best back on the roster rn

most frustrating thing about the team rn for me"
Someone tell soulja he's supposed to run the OTHER way
Brown is a fucking bum.
Lol told y’all nothing was changing
This passing attack is just pathetic. Not timing no accuracy no playmaking no intellegence.
Fire Greg
Where the fuck is dobbins bro why aren’t we pounding the rock
"Boykin caught alot more shit, for less bad plays.

And he didn't go tweeting stuff he couldn't back up either."
Wow look at that the no name Cowboys TE can catch a ball that he has to reach for a lil bit. Watcg and learn Hollywood
See bad throw but it was caught.
Marquise Brown a bust
I hate this fucking red head so much
Holy shit looks like we havent learned any lessons lol. Shitty playcalling on offense and no dobbins jfc
"If this season has proven anything, it's that if this game comes down to the offense winning for us, we've already lost"
It hit brown square in his hand. Not like it was finger tips.
What a fucking shame we have to count on Hollywood tonight
Someone tell Roman that receivers can run other routes than 3-yard in-routes.
"There ya go Souljia!!! Hell yeah brother, fantastic play!! You just got 4 yards!!"
WELCOME BACK 8. WE'VE MISSED YOU.
"That was a ""fuck you"" TD"
"4th and 2 long TD? Where have I seen that before?

Let’s GO LAMAR"
Fuck a first down
"Shades of 2019, let’s do more of that."
god he is so fun to watch
THAT'S MY FREAKING QB LET'S GO
See what happens when you put in JK and Gus and COMMIT TO THE RUN. It opens up the QB run
That was a big fuck you to Greg and john
"Fucking awesome run, but for the love of god please get Ingram and Brown the fuck out of this game"
"🥲

He back"
"I’ve tried to limit myself commenting in these threads because I always overreact, but did y’all see Lamar telling the special teams to stay on the sideline for that 4th and 2? That’s the shit I love about him. Need that confident spark back badly"
"LOL, well, we hadn't seen special teams totally shit itself for a bit, so I guess it was time they joined the offense and defense"
Harbaugh has some experience as a special teams coach
Nice double hold on one guy! Jesus christ lmao!!!
"Cut Tucker, mfer can't even make a simple tackle /s"
Well there should be a horse collar flag
Super obvious holding on #49 during return
"The Cowboys literally never turn over the ball...they already have a turnover

The Cowboys special teams is the worst in the NFL..."
HUGE hold on 59
Aight lets just boot it out the endzone now
Kick it out the back of the fucking endzone every time
I have not missed the heart-attack games...
All we need is the defense to make a terrible play and we've completed the trifecta in the first half
Offense wakes up and everything else shuts down. Nice
That's just bad defense by Humphrey
>I’m about to drink some wine and cope.... - @DezBryant
GUS BUSSSS
It’s clear that Ingram should be the #3 and it hurts for me to say because I fucking love that dude
GUS BUS
">**3&8? Toss a 3 yard pass to the sidelines**  
>  
>–– The Architect Of The Baltimore Ravens Offense"
I blame that miss on the commentator
You can fuck off joe
Gonna be one of those games boys. What can go wrong will go wrong.
Absolutely cursed season the fuck
Fuck the announcers
FUCK YOU TROY
“Tucker has made 70 straight”
lol fuck you Joe
"STFU COMMENTATORS, YOU ALWAYS JINX IT"
joe buck is the worst bro. jinxed marlo now tuck. fuck.
literally speechless. fuck the announcer curse.
Why does our middle line backer have better hands than our #1 WR
I like how Boykin used both arms to catch that TD.
HE FINALLY DID IT
Tucker missed on purpose to set that up
Tucker obviously missed on purpose because he knew that would happen. GOAT
I’m sorry did Boykin actually use his size to secure a catch
How many of y’all had to start deleting your comment you had typed up about us throwing on first down
"Where’s that penguin meme?

<—Miss out on 3 points due to missed FG.

Immediately intercept and get 7 points instead.—>"
For a second I thought they were going to show me some PTSD inducing footage that Andy Dalton caused our team once
Limited practice time may be what’s getting to our defense.
"Just weird watching every other team throw to wide open receivers 50-60 percent of the time. For all the shit we give our D, it’s one of the better units in the league. If that can happen against our D, why the hell can’t our offense make that happen with the most mobile QB in NFL history."
#Defense is soft
this is some dean pees shit
A reminder that Cowboys top 3 WRs are legit #1s. These guys are great. DBs are still very good.
Have we gotten a single QB pressure?
Can this game please not be close
"Please sir? SOME ASS RUSH

May I get to the QB please?"
Holy Cow McCarthy is angry
Yikes our pass rush is actually still horrendous even after Yannick's signing
lmao I love the facial expressions of players when someone misses a kick
I watch those two lady announcers on Amazon Prime. they're better than Buck and Aikman to me. They don't slob on teams' knob. they just talk about the game and go
“Hsjdjdodkowowosis jdjdjdodksi. Go Boys.” - Troy Aikman
dobbins gotta be rb1 moving forward
Hey Greg maybe we should uh... maybe me should give dobbins a shot there bud?
"LOL Aikman, dude got mauled before the ball got to him, how would you know it's not catchable"
Soulja sighting 👀
The Slot Soulja!
It’s a good thing roman can bench dobbins at half time like usual. Prick
Another illegal formation.  The Ravens remain so frustratingly stupid.
It is unfathomably unacceptable for us to be getting this many illegal formation penalties this season
That was absolutely horrendous by Hollywood.
That effort to toe drag was awful.  Marquise is shit
"absolutely fucking embarrassing the number of illegal formation penalties this year

and they just keep happening every single week"
Watching Ceedee Lamb out there really makes me jealous we desperately need separation and playmaking from our receivers
"This offense literally could not be more cursed.

An illegal formation penalty. Again. For the 12th game in a row.

Rushing to snap the ball when you have 3 timeouts. And when a score with possession to start the 3rd could be game.

Rolling Lamar out to one half of the field, so taking away 50% of the grass -- which has not worked all year.

And the throw is not good enough anyway to keep Hollywood inbounds.

I love this team. I swear I do. But our offense is barely functional."
Wr coaches are to blame at this point. They're training these dudes to stay off the line one way or another
I'm more upset with how we waste our first and 2nd down gaining 3 yards once we get in the redzone
We can’t let this team hang around man. This cannot be another titans game we need to put them away by the fourth.
I hope Harbaugh chews these guys out the Cowboys are atrocious
Damn we got lucky they didn’t throw that flag
BuT tHaT wAsNt CaTcHaBlE
Ravens get screwed by the refs every week and no announcers ever stick up for us lol
"Wow the refs gave us that, is this what it feels like to be pittsburgh minus being complete fucks?"
Honestly was catchable. Dodged a couple bullets there.
This defense does not have the same energy man idk what's going on
"my fucking HEART

i was prepared for it cause dalton voodoo"
"Glad we are up at half, but if this is the team we are bringing to Cleveland next week we will be in for a rude awakening...fuck the browns, fuck the Steelers."
I think I'm going to make Tucker as my first cyberpunk character
"That was way too close for comfort, Lamb almost had that one"
The Cowboys are AWFUL in the second half. Put this away
Pls just put this game away there’s no reason We should only be up by 7. Next week is going to be insane
"Who wants a bet the first play is an incompletion to Hollywood to start the half?

Edit; well I’ll be damned."
161 rush yards? My god
"shut the fuck up about the pi. refs suck what else is new, no constant mention when it happens to us"
Why the fuck does he sidearm shit man when he doesn't need to?
Bad pass.
"""Why he throw short?""

Because every throw that is >5 yards downfield is ridiculously high"
He was open dude
Come on lamar fuck
Where tf was the holding call wtf who else saw that shit
Was that Fort getting literally held to the ground????
Can't say the refs aren't giving us calls
I'm not gonna be a bitcj that's a bad spot
What is even considered a HOLD anymore?
The kicker for the Cowboys looks like the main character from LA noire
I think they should place a random cut out of waldo randomly in the bleachers so we can try to find him during the game.
"Where the hell is Dobbins?  He hasn't been on the field for any snaps in this half yet, I don't think."
"Someone please go explain to Greg that you can pass on first down

While you're at it make sure he knows what play action is"
"3rd and 8?

Time for a 3 yard pass to Hollywood that is 4 feet over his head"
Lamar can’t pass
Another horrible throw
Hollywood actually got open and it was a trash throw
We have the worst pass offense in the nfl. We aren’t moving on from Lamar so it’s time to change OCs
That’s on Lamar. Shit needs to get fixed
"If Lamar can just be a league average passer, he’s an MVP candidate again. Just be average, King. Love that throw."
Now that was a beaut
Holy fuck was that pretty
Ok Hollywood I won’t shit talk you anymore for now
SOULJA
Good catch by Brown there. I’ve been critical but that was 100% great play. And a real dime throw.
That was a fantastic job by Hollywood and Lamar holy shit
Perfect goddamned throw
That's vintage 2019 Hollywood
That's exactly why Marquis Brown would be very dangerous if there was a big physical WR-1 on the team too. He'd be that second guy who could maybe improvise or burn somebody.
This team baffles me. It’s does some great things. And then so many questionable things. Just remain consistent
CALL GOD 🤙
Is this what it's like to have S O U L J A S?
"HOLLYWOOD ""SOULJA"" BROWN CALLED GOD AND HE ANSWERED"
WHAT A THROW
Where has that connection been all year?
YOOOOO THAT WAS A SEXY PASS AND CATCH
BROWN TALKING SHIT TO THE DB HE GOT HIS CONFIDENCE BACK!!!!
"That is what is so frustrating about Lamar. We KNOW he can make the throws. His mechanics seem so simple to point out and fix, it makes it frustrating when he drops his arm on throws for no reason."
That’s the point of having souljahs and using them I guess
that was beautiful!
maybe the most impressive play yet for this duo let's go
Damn Lamar. Looks like a college QB on a bunch of throws and then makes an amazing throw while on the run. Wild.
We should make Lamar throw that pass 50 times each practice
Say it with me roman: abandon the run
Lmao Peters
I wish Jimmy Smith weren't constantly slightly injured
"4th quarter Ravens defense starting a few minutes early, I see."
Blitzing marlo should be an automatic jail sentence
ZERO pash rush against the worst O line in the league
"I may be wrong, but I've noticed this season (past few weeks especially), the D seems to be playing prevent. Maybe the ""opportunistic"" approach just looks that way, but teams have just been marching down field and then fizzling out in the red zone."
M&T has ended this man's career.
Feel bad for zuerlein
Gus would be a star on another team. We are so lucky we have him as a number 2 option
"Looked like Lamar got that 1st down to me, not sure about that spot."
lol Lamar rude af
I like seeing good sportsmanship.
"My GOD 70 yards on 5 rushes, Edwards is insane"
I love seeing Lamar playing excited like this
Fuck Troy Aikman
I feel like this is the first time this season Lamar has had fun
It’s good to see Lamar smiling again. That’s the vibe we need.
Can Harbaugh see?  Need some defroster glasses
Ffs get 7 let me sleep it’s 3am
"This is the first game that felt like 2019

Take me back"
With Mandrews out there we’d look even better in the red zone
What a shit fucking spot wow
look how fast Bowsers first step is jesus
Classic averett
Let’s hope Marlon isn’t hurt.
I’ll give Avereet a pass he had 1 practice as well straight off of IR. He was playing well before injury. I think he’ll be okay
"honestly, Averret has played pretty well tonight having just come off an injury. He plays hard and fast."
jesus christ these referees
Pussy PI call on that
Yo fort picked that
Why did Harbs not throw the fucking Challenge Flag
That was an INT
get after that ref chuck!
Refs fuck us again...
Brandon Williams is so valuable
How do they not even review that pick smh
Bout had enough of Aikman sucking off the boys for the year
"TF are the cowboys cheering about, we clearly recovered it


god Texans are dumb lol"
#BIG BOI NO LITTLE BOI!
"Tell us how you really feel, Troy"
Is that Lamar laughing?
"Lamar

I love the enthusaism and desire to run

But pleeease get down earlier rn my dude, you’re too important to this team!!"
DOBBINS WALKING RIGHT IN
EAZY MONEY
OBJ’s soundbites are gold
EASY MONEY
"THERE'S MY EXTRA TD.

""EASY MONEY""."
LET'S GO DOBBINS TAKING US TO THE DUB AND ME TO THE #1 SEED
EASY MONEY!!!!
The Blocking there literally made me coomb in my pants.
"Haven’t heard Lawrence called once tonight. 

Orlando might actually play better at LT than the right side"
I want one more Ravens TD. Call me greedy
Lol.  Fox wrong for that.
"Man, dropping both the pats and titans games really sucks. Win just one of those and we'd have breathing room to drop a game down the stretch. Oh well. Hope we beat the brakes off the browns."
Harbs gonna get in trouble for that! Lol
Funny as hell seeing a bunch of grown men act like commentators curse is a real thing
Ngakue still missing
"I love how butthurt Aikman and Troy are over the no call PI and failed Hail Mary. 
Fuck the Cowboys. Let’s go Ravens 

- Giants fan"
Erin Andrews is a 10
Lamar putting this organization on his back once again
Jesus please show that replay of peters
Fort deserves a fat bag with the heart he brings every week
Man don’t y’all miss the Ravens defense that’d get at least 3 sacks and a couple turnovers a game
LAMAR IS COVERING UP THIS AWFUL PLAYCALLING
Btw JK Dobbins banged my girlfriends cousin during his time at OSU
"marlo

what are you standing around dumbfounded for? 

you deadass just let him score, bro"
Vibes in these game threads 📉📈📉📈
So sick of the NFL with these commerical breaks. A fucking commerical 2 seconds before the 2 minute warning?
did you know dez tested positive and isnt playing
Yeah I'm not paying Yannick let him walk
"FUCK THESE REFS MAN

3 STRAIGHT BLOWN CALLS"
Dobbins ran through their d like he did my girlfriends cousin
I just wish Dez could have taken part in this. He has a big chip on his shoulder with the cowboys. I don't think he would have gone to a team that wasn't going to play the cowboys this year
Lamar had 1 day of practice and has 3tds and 200 plus total yards and a 70 percent completion percentage 🐐🔥🐐
Campbell and William's are back Jimmy is out
weird playing dalton lol
It's been two years since I was this nervous before a game
Anyone else want to see Skip have a melt down tomorrow?
For those who can’t see the game because of local reasons it’s available on Amazon prime.
"I’ve been drinking bloody marys for the past few games, and we’ve lost. Tonight I’m breaking out the Baileys. Let’s go boys!"
No Dez????
"Wtf is up with this team and Covid? 

Regardless, must win game here to keep pace in AFC."
Really sucks. Any chance Dez's test is a false positive? Not talking about him playing at this point obviously.
That Andy Dalton artwork was fucking horrifying
Fuck Andy Dalton.
Fort’s visor gives me Ray Lewis vibes
Ingram lost all of his explosiveness
The fact Ingram continues to get work over dobbins is astonishing
Wrong way Hollywood...
Hollywood just gives up 2 yards for no reason after the catch. He needs to stop running backwards.
What a garbage ass first drive. Fuck Roman
Utter dogshit from Brown get your fucking hands up or please just cut yourself from this team!
3rd and 8: let’s throw a 5 yard pass to the 5’7 guy who’s covered
"Ah yes, love gifting the worst defense in the NFL an easy interception on our first drive of the game."
Use both hands maybe?
"lmao, souljas"
"Marquise: catch ball, run backwards. Drop ball, cause interception."
Bollywood Brown
Marquise was drafted off hype and name value alone this dude is such a dud. I’m almost embarrassed by how much I was hyping him up to all my football buddies that summer. Guy is going to be CFL bound in no time
I swear if Andy Dalton ruins another fucking day for me.
Marquise Brown is a waste of fucking time
"We gotta get Lamar a different car pool man, stop forcing it to this bum because he's your ride home. Hell I'll call the uber myself"
Hollywood is not meant to be catching passes in traffic/middle of the field
"Good stop in a bad situation. Now, keep Ingram the fuck off the field."
Let’s Get Ja’Marr Chase
I once again ask that when we pass we call multiple routes more than 3 yards down the field
Lamar is not above criticism. But Roman does this shit EVERY WHERE HE GOES. He is the constant source in offenses regression when he’s the coordinator.
Might need to part ways with Ingram
"Hollywood is putting in 0 effort since his tweet.

I'm over it.

With the few targets that Dez has gotten this season, he's shown 2x as much effort."
What is this bullshit. Give carries to Dobbins
"USE GUS. GETS 7 YARDS.

GRO: DUHH INGRAM RIGHT?"
I swear we waste first downs every single game.
Go for it
#THERE'S LAMAR'S FIRE
M V P
THATS MY QB
STUNT ON THEM
Fucking hell yeah beutifull
oh how I missed lamar
 Oh Lamar is back. Telling John to keep him on the field and scoring out of it.
Thank you lamar for calling the shot on that 4th. We need more of that
"That's what I want to see from this team. Lamar taking control, showing passion and making great plays"
"It isn’t lamars speed that’s impressive, it’s his acceleration. He goes 0-100 just like that. Damn"
"SEE

IT'S NOT HARD

STOP GIVING THE BALL TO THE BROKEN TIRES"
Lamar looks back to normal. He was never as fast this year when he had that groin injury preseason.
Tucker prolly calls that a miss. Wasn’t right down the middle.
Lamar said stop being a pussy I’m gonna score real quick harbs
Finally! Keep running Lamar. Thats what makes him special
you see ravens fan stop being down and have some faith in your team
"our offense is literally Lamar, we gotta help the man out"
LAMAR MVP JACKSON THATS SIX
God bless Lamar Jackson
that clip of lamar telling the sideline that he's got this and then running that td in is ALL TIME. gonna be on his career highlight video
Fuck passing. We can just run our way into the playoffs ala 2018 ravens
You guys remember how we threw to a TE for like 14 yards? Let’s fucking do that more. Christ GRo takes years off my  heart
Lamar is ready to have some fun again
Why not just kick it out like normal teams do
I hope they mention John coming up on special teams
Well that didn't take long...
Tucker for Defensive player of the week
"Wow lmao, Chris Board held too no call"
Wide fucking open 😡
Don’t tell me we’re gonna lose to the cowboys 😂😂😂
Very unlike our ST unit.  I bet Harbs is pissed.  But I guarantee there was a missed call in there hes more pissed at.
"This also happened against the Patriots...let me remind you.

The offense gets on the board with a TD in the second drive...

And the defense let a limited offense drive the field for a TD...

Now this time it is the special teams..."
That's that shit I don't like
I love when commentators compliment someone and they immediately give up a play.
Opi and Cowboys oline holding like crazy but na it’s all on Marlon
So does offensive line holding not exist?
Jesus we struggle to play disciplined football man wtf
Feed JK
run game is working well... time for roman to stop running it like we did against the titans
Oh you think G Ro will stay with the run do you Troy?  Care to make a wager?
Fucking Greg Stupid Roman
Hill is growing on me
Fuck you Aikman. Don’t try to jinx the GOAT
Lol this is so 2020
Dr pepper jail
Jesus they did jinx him wtf
How tf do you false start on a field goal cmon bruh
HE ACTUALLY JINXED IT
"FUCK these announcers, they always try to jinx stuff like this"
JOE FUCK
"Ayyy, fuck these announcers lmao"
Joe buck you son of a bitch
Fucking Aikman still playing for the Cowboys!
"On the one hand, if we lose maybe we’re one step closer to firing G-Ro."
One Gus bus run and a bunch of garbage play calls.  Roman special
FUCK YOU TROY AIKMEN AND TONY ROMO FUCK THE COWBOYS WHY DO YOU ALL HATE TUCKER
Fuck the announcers
Fuck Joe Buck with a 10 foot spiked rod
Cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
All my homies hate Joe Buck
#KNEEL FOR THE QUEEN
"Thank you for missing Tucker, 4D chess"
BOYKIN
Boykin making plays baby !!! He's a soulja!!!
Somebody in my neighborhood is shooting off fireworks cuz they just scored. Pasadena.
Tuckers sacrifice wasn't in vein
Miles Boykin >>> Soulja
WE CALLED A DIFFERENT ROUTE CONCEPT!!!!!
Awesome play by Jackson and Boykin. Good to see Boykin play his size and just run through arm tackles.
JACKSON 5 INCOMING TN
Tucker: I’ll just miss this field goal right here so we can get 7 in two plays
people have gone from shitting on boykin to shitting on hollywood
That chick in the mirror ad has a great ass
I know Tucker missed but how do you get a false start on a field goal?
This pass rush just isn’t getting there
D is playing way too soft. Too much cushion
I would love of we could get a sack
"All the money we invest in this defence, can’t even get a sack against the worst o line"
#LMAO IT'S POETRY
So penalty before the kick equals missed kick? Is that the new rule?
SOMETHING IS IN THE AIR
At least the announcers are jinxing equally? 😂
Can we get a TD I want to be comfy.
Finally changed my flair from Ingram to Dobbins. Lets go.
TD here would calm my nerves. Defense needs to tighten up. Offense needs to keep pounding the ball
Chance to double on points here and after the half. Let’s get it.
Points here and to start the second half
Troy aikman has a permanent cowboy penis in and around his mouth
"GRO IRL rn after that run: ""Take him out of the goddamn game."""
Troy Aikman and Joe Buck is just fucking miserable man lmao
Hate that play call
"Why do they question an obvious penalty against the ravens, but when an obvious holding call was shown on the replay for the cowboys big kick return they don’t say anything but just compliment the returner. Bs"
Hey announcers....we are in Baltimore...not Dallas.
Almost 200 rushing yards in the first half... holy
Every game illegal formation
Every fucking week.  How
Oh look an illegal formation penalty I’m shocked
Seriously. Bench Marquise.
How the hell do we have 1+ illegal formations a game when no other teams ever have them?
The illegal formation flag is the greatest meme of all time
"Another illegal formation, coaches do your job and teach the players what that means"
This might be the most undisciplined Ravens team I’ve seen in 10 years because wtf
New streak begins
I swear just don’t run that pitch anymore
y'all remember hollywood last year? how was he better with a screw in his foot
just let the man kick in peace
If I was Decosta I would be standing over Romans shoulder in the booth. Every game.
No reason for Ingram to see the field in the 2nd half.
If we play like this Cleveland gonna run for 500 yards
Our defense is allergic to stops tonight.
How have we not gotten to Dalton? Their O-Line is Swiss chesse
Yo Bowser EXPLODED off the line
Just imagine if we had these WRs...omg.
D-line struggling against dudes off the street
Seriously surprised Dalton signed with the cowboys.  He should have walked into the Bears starting spot
That Boykin touchdown would have been Dez..poor fella
Def got away with one but shut the fuck up Troy you fucking cuck.
buck and aikman are actually like horrendous
Ten cents says a makeup call is coming...
That was just terrible officiating.
They refs are going to give one backnto the Cowboys for that missed call. And it's going to hurt later
"Got away with that one, but holy Troy I know you played for the cowboys but you don't have to sound so dejected they didn't call it"
Troy is thinking 65 yard field goal attempt is the smart move?
I hate Andy Dalton Hail Marys
Holy shit Lamb was SUPER close to bringing that down
Lol none of our guys even jumped.
Makes me sick knowing we took Hollywood the pick before Montez Sweat 🤮
"Real talk - can we do Tuesday night football from now on instead of Thursday?

1 more day of rest for players. 3 straight days of prime time football."
People complaining about the defense are insane. The two scoring drives were for ten points on 49 yards total. And Dalton has been getting the ball out quickly which prevents the pass rush from getting home.
Prepare to say goodbye to Dobbins again
"God, Erin Andrews is so fucking hot."
Lamar needs to get his arm situation settled.
Lamar really needs to throw lower
"Who is surprised we went run, pass, pass after half time?"
Poor fucking throw
"That’s on Lamar, bad throw"
"Counting the PI to wilson, lamar has overthrown 2 deep balls so far. 

If boykin catches that in stride, he might still be running."
WTF was that throw
What happened to that qb guru that Lamar worked with?
Just geez. These are easy passes that every NFL quarterback should make.
LMFAO wtf Ngakoue gets pinned to the ground and no holding but there’s a phantom holding call on that fair catch punt
**We have no pass rush** what else is new to the oblivious people not understanding how we're getting fucked on.
this pass rush is pathetic
what's a pass rush
Bro where are the holds refs?
Isn't the Cowboys' O-line severely depleted? I'm shocked we haven't sacked Dalton yet
Are the kickers not accounting for the speed at which the earth is spinning
Pass rush needs to wake tf up
Campbell did not look happy moving around in that replay. Still hurt? Thoughts?
"We better win this, Cowboys are gifting this to us."
Capitalize fellas
Does Greg understand play action
ozzie goat sighting
PUT DOBBINS IN THE FUCKING GAME GRO WHAT THE ABSOLUTE FUCK IS YOUR PROBLEM?
Lol all that work pre-snap for a 1 yard gain
Ingram with the explosive two yards
JK still has 5 rushing attempt. Why these coaches don't wanna win?
ingram just took the wrong hole there
"See? This is why reason #746336273737 why Roman is an idiot, Ingram just doesnt have it. So in a close game you’re gonna put him in, instead of your backs that are averaging over 10 YPC. Give me a fucking break. I hate Greg Roman so much."
Dobbins average 10 ypc again. Please fucking use him.
Ingram is washed. Probably gone in the off-season.
"we should have been seeing mostly gus and Jk by like week 4. The fact that they're still giving ingram significant carries this deep into the season is absolutely nuts. Like it's not just a small drop off, it's a fucking cliff."
These plays fucking suck and when we do throw its a checkdown or its inaccurate
"Yeah, Troy, it's almost like Lamar is hard to tackle or something."
"Dobbins finally in and gets 6?

#shocking"
dude dobbins has been $$$ tonight.
I love hearing how disappointed Troy is every time we make a play lol
Dobbins is ELECTRIC
"Wow, Greg. It’s almost as if we do better when that Dobbins guy is in!"
Dobbins hits the line of scrimmage at such a high speed every time
The only time Ingrahm should get a snap is when Dobbins wants to eat a donut on the sideline.
"All this running is great, but my man can’t be missing these passes"
That was fucking beautiful
Soulja boy up in that ohhhhh
HOLLYWOOD
Where are the Hollywood haters? Let’s go!!
SOULJA! He did things!
Hell of a throw hell of a catch
Soulja boy tell em
A fucking dime
Are we giving him back is Hollywood nickname or are we waiting a week?
That Brown illustration is gonna give me nightmares
"that shit was beautiful by both lamar and hollywood

goddamn 

more pls"
That was an amazing td! Nice throw by Lamar and nice catch by Brown I’m a proud ravens fan right now
Peters got lit up.
We’re missing our big man in Jimmy
Grounding
That is ridiculously fucking obvious. How are refs so consistently incompetent?
STOP. FUCKING. BLITZING
Aj brown level of tackling
I think i forgot what a sack is and how it occurs
"Unsung Hero must be between Derek Wolfe, LJ Fort and (maybe) Tyus Bowser this year"
HOLY SHIT WE GOT A SACK
>HOLLYWOOD THATS MEAN!!!! Great throw ACTION JACKSON - @DezBryant
"What is this ""sack"" concept you refer to?"
Only took 53637583 blitz’s.
Wait you're *allowed* to tackle the QB??
Foot on the throat NOW
Quick shoutout to Jimmy Smith. It shows when we don't have him out there. Miles better than Averett
Yo tuck might have missed but let's all be thankful our kicker is not complete ass.
Didn’t know Patrick had a son lol
ricard just BOUNCED that bitch
So Pat Ricard is back? That's good to see
"Ooof,  that's alot of guy falling on Jackson"
LJax SLIDE dammit 😂
"Was lurking the cowgirls subreddit and saw this

“I think we are owed some of Baltimore's draft picks if any of our players end up with Covid in the next 5 days.”

Yeah because it’s our fault the NFL decided to continue the game? What an idiot lmfao."
That’s the only play I’ve ever seen Dobbins make a bad decision
Back to highlight jackson
LETS FUCKING GO
Lamar having fun. I've missed this
Lol all love between Lamar and cowboys defense
That YPC for Gus and Dobbins is stupid good
Say what you want about Lamar but he’s special. Just needs more time
why tf was that a rollout. that was stupid
Bad throw but wtf was that playcall?
You gotta hit that pass Lamar.
"Man, Lamar has looked like old Lamar tonight while running but these passes are rough."
"lamar should've had that but also jesus christ end zone rollouts are awful

the only reason he had a chance for that throw was extending the play after nobody was open"
Anyone see Greg Roman’s tin of Copenhagen lmao
Lamar throwing so many shitty throws and you can still see how much better our offense is with him
Let’s Go Ravens! Going up 31-10 would be awesome.
Bro if our defense doesn't get it together this week the browns are gonna smash us. But also fuck the Browns
Hump please be ok
"I still can't believe they gave Elliott the first down on that catch, he was without a doubt short, it wasn't even really close."
Should have challenged that Fort catch
LOL BUT THAT IS A FLAG.
Man that was a pick dude
Shouldve challenged wtf man
Fuck the fuckin refs. Fuck them all
Big Baby is the heart of this defense and no one can tell me different
Peters totally lost.
Marcus Peters gets burnt too often
Fuckin Peters...
"Peters wasted the goal line stand, fuck man"
MP Juice Man likes to give up a lot
Two all pro CB just watched cooper catch that
"if the big play happens on 3rd, d will 100% give one up on 4th"
How come Chuck and Aikman are not crying about Fort's pick like the cried about the blown call in the first half
Wtf cowboys are idiots 😂😂😂
The announcers actually thinking that was debatable
Did y’all hear lamar screaming 😂
Gus is so god damn good. Dobbins Gus has to be our 1-2 next year
"# EASY

# MONEY"
Why in the absolute fuck are you making Lamar run in this situation?
EZ money
Ingram laughs like a little girl and I'm here for it.
EASY MONEY
EASY MONEY!
"# EASY

# MONEY"
the dagger 🗡🗡🗡🗡🗡
EASY MONEY
Dobbins single handedly win my fantasy game with that td lol
Energy is back in the team
EASY MONEY
Dobbins!
Man. That actually makes me sad to look at lol
We can outrun the clowns if we only use dobbins and Gus bus (except for rest of course)
Dalton out-manuvering our rushers would be funnier if this wasn’t a long-term problem and we have to basically win out to make the playoffs...
Peters almost had that
good to get a win! Now let's bake some Brownies
"If we can’t dominate the Cowboys, we don’t deserve to win any more games."
We legit gonna make the cowboys look like a good team huh?
"I just fucking hate the commentators. Every fucking week. I wonder when he is going to miss again, will it be this kick?!"
"Hi my name is Greg Roman.

I don't know how to run an offense."
"Why are people blaming g-ro for passing there? The call was great. Boykin scores a TD if that ball is accurate.

Stop blaming GRO when he actually does a good job."
Lamar gets flack for a bad pass but it's like we all forget that for about 27 other QBs thats a sack
# BODY SLAM
Lamar just handing out that post game Covid
"Mofo comes off covid, 1 practice, misses 2 throws and ppl wanted his head. Most criticized QB pass to pass."
"Lamar can throw but has inconsistency issues due to mechanics?

🔫Always has been."
"Sightly high, slightly outside, but that's a catchable ball.

Hollywood wasn't ready for the ball."
These fuckers out the massive jinx on it
"Marquise brown is a bum, not only that he is a below replacement-level player. I’m tired of apologists on this thread saying it’s his utilization. He can’t get separation and he has zero ball skills besides running backwards to avoid contact. It’s time to cut ties, no sunk cost fallacy bullshit. This has to end."
Can we appreciate how deeply Joe Buck wanted to jinx Tucker.
Lamar’s accuracy is really an issue now.
Lamar is throwing very poorly this year. Very concerning.
Atrocious throwing technique
Can’t even blame Boykin! He came to play today he was open
Fuck all you haters that say he can’t throw
Should frame a picture of that Brown touchdown and hang it up until next year when he gets his next one.
"Did the NFL remove the rule on wearing alternate jerseys twice a year, we already wore ours twice"
">Ravens inactives: C Trystan Colon-Castillo, DT Justin Madubuike, DT Broderick Washington (concussion), CB Jimmy Smith (groin) and CB Tramon Williams (thigh). - @jeffzrebiec"
I hate fox coverage
The all black unis are so ridiculously hard and every time we wear them I’m baffled at why we don’t wear them more often. Just a beautiful beautiful kit
we cant have SHIT
"No Dez tonight guys, Covid"
Welp. I was really excited for a Dez revenge game.
[deleted]
"Dez announced he's quitting the season? Man, I really hope he's just reacting in the heat of the moment and isn't actually calling it quits"
Did anyone else think this game was at 5 lol I've been waiting here for 3 hours
Damn Patrick queen struggling in coverage
#FORT
Wow defense doing it
Thank god LJ can use tackling fundementals
Gotta love these play calls right now
Now who tf is Lamar gonna throw to 🤔
My wish is for no three and outs today. Fingers crossed
"Time to show everyone why you won the MVP, Lamar!"
Dez tweeted he's done with the season :( hope it's just spur of the moment frustration. He's worked so hard to come back
Sigh I feel so bad for Dez
"Not gonna lie. Dez being out really damaged my excitement for this game. Was talking all day about wanting to see him breakout. 

Oh well. Shake it off. LETS FUCKING GO LAMAR."
1st down runs still pain
WHERE IS JK
Holy shit it feels so good to have Lamar back
Ingram is just so slow since he came back from injury. I’m ready for the JK Dobbins train.
I am retroactively pissed we traded Hurst and added no replacement
Please stop forcing Ingram into the lineup man
I love Ingram but he has no business starting at this point
The soulja with the -1 YAC😈😈😈
Hollywood running backwards lol thanks champ
why the fuck is Ingram still starting?
Fucking Bollywood
Fkin Hollywood 🤦🏼‍♂️
Soulja...
I’m sorry- we should never have an empty backfield tbh
I miss snead.
Of fucking course
Hollywood is literally the worst
Marquis- time for the next man up.
"Alright, we have to start holding lamar accountable."
Season was over the second we had a COVID outbreak don’t know why y’all got so optimistic for some reason
"I'm ready to bench Hollywood. Not even bc that was his fault, it wasn't entirely his fault - but I feel like we force him the ball wayyy too much"
BAD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN MARQUISE BROWN IS TARGETED
Empty..... 5 yard pass ..... 3rd down ........ haven’t seen that before
Duvernay and Proche at least act like they give a shit when they run routes
This offense genuinely reminds me of 2017 Flacco days.
He literally ran backwards to avoid contact on the first throw and made no effort on the second. He’s Nate Robinson soft.
"If it was Peyton throwing, he would point Hollywood to the sideline EVERY HUDDLE until he learns he has 2 hands."
I don’t wanna lose to Andy Dalton...
"Not fully his fault on that one, but honestly dumbfounded I ever thought Brown would be a good WR. He's like 5'4, 80lbs. He sucks."
"Ah well, we got one holding call this game. Can’t get greedy..."
Least we held them to 3. Stop the stupid pass plays and run the ball till they show they can stop it
I'm expecting Lamar to be a little rusty on the first few drives. Lets run the damn ball.
Lol these route trees are trash
Who's 33 and why has he been in the practice squad for all but 2 games? He's pretty solid!
There goes our soldiers 🤣🤣
guys have some fucking faith god damn it’s the 1st qtr plenty of time
well fun first 5 min sub but yall are already too toxic...
Please for the love of god put jk in this drive
JK should be #1 in depth chart and it ain’t even close :(
Spotted them 3. We’ll heat up tho.
#GUS BUS
I think 95%of NFL wide receivers make that catch.  I’m saying that literally.  Our WR1 is about the size of a 7th grader and doesn’t give the effort to make up for it at all.
So Dez is quite frustrated... with a virus?
Gus is so much better than Ingram at this point
"Announcers; i dont think Cowboys can stop the run

Roman; watch me"
dobbins should be the #1 back
"""Yeah, keep ingram though"" -Greg Roman"
"Dobbins gets a big run

Greg Roman: *pikachu face*"
Crazy what the run game looks like when literally anyone besides Ingram gets the ball.
#The Ravens are their own toughest opponent
That snap was on Lamar not mekari
Go for it.
Lamar trying to get some of his 4th down mojo back
I LOVE IT.
"Lamar is finally like, ""alright guys, stop being pussies on fourth down."" Love that gesture"
Why are we throwing behind the line to holywood when he likes to avoid contact. Ya let's force him to run head-on into the defense
HOLY SHIT LAMAR WELCOME BACK LEGEND
MY BB
Damn he fooled the fuck out of them
**Vintage Jackson**
Love that Lamar has his confidence back.
He still got it.
Unbelievable he hit top speed soooooo quick.
LAMAARRRR
"Lamar is an actual Souljia, he does his jobs and knows when to shut up and play."
Lol they had to dump the audio cus Lamar was spitting some shit
TD. Thanks to Luke...... WILSON
Love Bozeman calling the TD!
Can we please just run and never throw. We have no receivers we can rely on. Jackson dobbins Gus. That’s it.
That was the most predictable play call and it worked lol
#WE SHOULD HAVE A TOTAL OF 5 PASSES TONIGHT
"that was the ""fuck COVID"" run"
He said fuck Greg romans shit playcalling boiii
Hollywood honestly doesn’t look fast idk what the hype was about
Hopefully this drive is all you need to see the difference between Lamar and McSorley. It's not even a conversation lol
Look at Bozeman putting up the TD signal before Lamar even got there!
Now lets get lamar a true #1 receiver
Daddy Lamar is the only reason we are competitive
"as much as i'm sick of Roman using lamar to run through the middle, it was the right call on that play


Now let's mix it up so they don't figure roman out like every other team. FEED DOBBINS PLS"
Please y’all keep talking shit about Lamar it feeds him
"Hey number 8 is pretty good, we should play him at quarterback every week!"
"Honestly fuck our receivers. Keep Snead, and duvernay. The rest can go"
"37 yard TD run on 4th & 2. Not bad for a ""running back"" that just recovered from COVID ;-("
"I’ve noticed it’s actually usually the same people screaming the end of our season when we do something moderately bad. 


Most of us realize not every play can be perfect."
#CAN YOU ALL FUCKING TACKLE HIM JESUS CHRIST
As soon as one group of our team plays well another part immediately falls apart it never fails lol
"Welp, the short kick off giveth and the short kick taketh away."
Come on special teams
Damn thought tucker had him
i knew this would eventually happen letting teams run on the kickoff
Queen was getting held like A MOTHER FUCKER really opened that run
I thought you couldn’t block 2 on 1 during kickoffs??
One great thing happens and then something bad happens
So we're using this game to scout Gallup right?
Hump is ripping one out at some point in this game
Block in the back?? Something
I much rather have the Cowboys drive down the field on a special teams mistake than our defense playing poorly
The most surprising is the QB pressure. How are the ravens not blowing their line up?
We were far too happy after our touchdown. We're not allowed to do that in 2020!
>D.J. Fluker now in at RT. So looks like Phillips and Fluker are rotating every two series. - @jeffzrebiec
HOLY SHIT HE ACTUALLY FUCKING CAUGHT IT
I am genuinely surprised he didn’t drop that
"This has been the most disheartening season since 2015. Our players do not make clutch plays, they're irresponsible with their social media and partying (Marlon and others) and generally just have no heart or strength.

Honestly so disappointed in Harbaugh and Eric DeCosta, this isn't Ravens football."
#BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKERS
Gus is so underrated
If we let Gus leave that is a **massive issue**
Did they just call Greg Roman a architect? I must be a rocket scientist then
I'd like to see Greg Roman's playbook
"Dude. Fucking why.

Pointless."
The dumb ass penalties every week are KILLING ME.
Its all fucking checkdowns
"One yard check down on third down. This offense is so, so broken"
"Oof self destruction, that feels like home"
Announcer jinx
Fuck these announcers
3rd and 8 and we go for a check down
".....

Tucker missed... it's like we're actively trying to lose this game."
Bruh
WHAT THE FUCK
NO FUCKING WAG
You've got to be fucking kidding me!
What even is this season
It’s really one thing after another with this team
Jfc guys
Every facet of this team is broken
What the fuck
The announcer... wtf
This is the darkest timeline
Were actually a cursed team rn
Trash playcalling led to that. Fuck man
"That’s it- only running the ball and that’s it from now on. 4th and 10 from the red zone, run it."
Pain
"I can’t even. A game that shouldn’t be close, we are losing."
"Fucking Greg Roman man, made tucker miss that."
This is just comedy at this point
JOE SHUT THE FUCK UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUPUH
Fuck you Joe Buck
"Do you asshats want to bitch about Tucker now, too?"
This is what they get for trying to shuffle running backs like a deck of cards
[deleted]
"Can we please revisit that 3rd and 8 play call. I mean wtf? And why to Justice Hill? 

This offense this year is so frustrating."
2020 has gone too far now! Leave Tucker alone!
Can you Lamar go up to Harbaugh and tell him that we ain’t winning a SB with this offense? A la Joe to Cam Cameron. Top 10 QB in the league and we regularly have 50 yards passing near the half.
At least we got the ball back quick. Good job B Will
“He’s mah queen “- J.Snow
MY QUEEEEN
Holy shit. Myles Boykin actually did something. This really is 2020
MILES FUXKONG BOYKIN
DEEP PASSES AND GOOD STUFF HAPPENS FUCK YOU ROMAN
Anyone else getting emotional whiplash?
Opposite day guys. Queen is best coverage
IM ON A ROLLERCOASTER OF EMOTIONS BOYS
An open WR... well I never.
Tucker missed field goal and then Boykin gets a td... wtf is going on???
"High IQ missed field goal by tucker, even when he misses he scores"
A BOYKIN TD??? Batten down the hatches it’s going to be a blizzard tonight!
"All the things that can go wrong do, and then a rare Boykin TD. Gonna be a weird one."
NOW KICK THE BALL OUT OF THE ENDZONE
PATRICK QUEENNNN
"Miles Boykin comeback player of the year.



Change my mind"
8D chess from the Ravens to give themselves a 4-point boost with the missed field goal
Boykin with a hell of an effort on that catch
"What a team response for Tucker.

Misses his first FG aiming 5 years (fuck 2020.)
Defense picks off next play.
Jackson TD to Boykin.
Which gives the ball to Tucker to chip in the XP to rebuild his confidence.

At least that’s how I imagine it."
"I'm learning in real time that dez might quit football after testing positive for covid-19.

This ravens season is wild."
Why is Lamb always wide open
"Is it bad that I'm genuinely higher on boykin going forward than marquise?

Brown's speedy as hell but that's it. Boykin has every physical tool and the only thing in his way is focusing up and getting help n the same page with Lamar. That seems way more fixable than Brown's refusal to do anything physical"
What a hit by Queen in the hole
I don’t think Dez will actually quit the season I think it was just a heat of the moment tweet and I don’t blame him
"Ferguson always gets rinsed on play action and reverses, it's actually so bad."
Marcus oh my lord
Peters giving 8 yards again. C'mon man you're fast enough to keep up
Marcus “off” Peters
"I'ma fucking smack peters, why the fuck is he still not playing up"
What is with this team man. If it's not the secondary its another area failing. We cant play sound football in all three phases ever
The total lack of pressure is an issue.
The secondary is bafflingly bad tonight.
"Our run dline gets so much penetration but when it comes to a pass rush, they're non existent"
Lmao love Gallup just stopping and standing there watching the ball fly outta the stadium
Yannick getting dominated just watch him
I'm just going to go ahead and call a Calais pick six in this game right now
Hahahaha
We gotta spend a lot more than like 30% of our cap on our offense. Spend too much on players on defense that barely do anything
Joe Buck will never compliment a kicker again
Who is the dicksmack that signed Baker to a MULTI year commercial deal
"Damn, tonight is not the night for kickers"
Why was the clock still running after the penalty? Thought they got rid of that loophole the pats & titans exploited it
The ghost of Edgar Poe in the building or some shit
Gritty’s body was modeled after Mike M
A TD would be awesome. But a FG would be okay too
First DPI of the season LFG!
"Announcers are a joke

It wasn’t catchable cus Wilson wasn’t able to go up and try to catch it lmao"
Literally tackles the fucking dude and he wants to question it
“Idk if that ball was catchable” yeah no shit he can’t catch a ball while being tackled!
"Ravens got a FLAG, it must be Christmas"
Dobbins is faster than all of these other dudes
Zero excuse for JK not being the feature back. So good
“DaMarquise Brown” Joe Buck
Fuck this retarded timeshare. Give Dobbins the rock
Really ugly calls in the redzone today
EVERY FUCKING GAME
ANOTHER ILLEGAL FORMATION FOUL WHAT
Get your fucking feet down man
FUCKING HOW DOES THAY KEEP HAPPENING
This is every single game!! 100% coaching
Lots of those penalties this year
So fucking tired of these OL penalties
GR crumbles under pressure. He has no composure
Illegal formation #400.
YOU KIDDING ME?? HOW DO WE GET AN ILLEGAL FORMATION PENALTY EVERY FUCKING GAME!?
"I know we’re passing for clock management, but hell, we got timeouts, keep running it. 

Real tired of the formation penalties. Feels like we get one every game."
Lmao fucker tried to jinx him again
How the fuck do we have errand snaps and multiple pre snap penalties every game. Greg needs to be demoted
How are we still lining up illegal in every fucking game
The coaching for this team is clearly fucked. What was that penalty
TUCKER REVENGE SZN - 1/1
"Yeah, Brown is starting to really seem pathetic out there."
Lol Zrebiec is fed up on twitter
Roman should be fired just from the crazy amount of illegal formation penalties we get. It’s insane
"Even if the play didn’t count, how does Hollywood not make a better effort to get 2 feet in bounds there? 

He might actually stink at football..."
Buck and Aikman calling the Ravens (or most any AFC team) is just garbage. They clearly don’t know the team.
Thought that little bitch was gonna return it again
They call holding in. Your guys games? Holy shit wow. They only ever calm it on us almsot
Andy Dalton is doing better against our defense then Ben Roethlisberger and we have more people back lmao
Has Andy Dalton been hit this game?
Yo if yannik doesnt take over in the second half hes not worth it the cowboys have practice squad tackles on the field
After all that's been invested in this Dline how do we still lack a pass rush. It's really mind boggling
Everyone remember you can watch the second half en Español to counter the joe buck curse.  Voodoo bastard......
Could Troy Aikman be more of a Cowboy cheerleader than he is right now? He sounds like a desperate fan.
This field is a fucking slippery mess
wowwwww we got away with one there
THEY mauled our d-lineman
[deleted]
Wow we got lucky as hell that the ref didn't catch that
Holy shit that was so obvious too. What happened with shit like this in the Steelers game?
lmao cry more Troy.
"“The only thing you can hope for is a defensive penalty.”

Did you see what just happened"
Is this what it feels like to have the refs on your side? Its a first
Cover zero!
Pretty fun game
I would’ve been pissed if he caught that haha
AJ Green flashbacks
Dalton to Green flashbacks
"Wow. Lamb should've caught that which is wild.

Special talent."
YIKES HE YUCKED THE FUCK OUTTA THAT BALL
I HATE playing Dalton. He either has 4 TDS and a game winner against us or throws 4 INTs no in between
"Wink got bailed out by the refs AND the Cowboys there.

That said, I'm not complaining. I can't remember the last time this season luck was on our side."
It looked like we've never practiced a hail mary before
Ravens past few weeks have been testing my mental health lmao. Everyday it’s some new crazy shit happening
can we start the next half with a score
Defense not looking great so far tbh. Seems like their WRs are constantly open.
Lmao Greggg Williams getting shit on during a ravens/cowboys game. Love to see it 😂
Stared the receiver down the entire route
keeps throwing this stupid floaters
"Love Lamar, but he usually throws too high"
Bad pass
And again. Terrible throw.
mandrews seems like a distant memory right now. come back soon bby
I hate that sidearm
man lamar would be a top 3 qb in the league if he'd improve his throwing
D needs to strap up. Tired of these easy conversions
It's good that we are using Dobbins
Two throws no jk dobbins winning formula
So are the refs just not going call the hold
"Pass rush MIA, against a terrible O-Line nonetheless"
That right tackle just held so bad lmao
OBVIOUS HOLD MISSED! FUCKING WONDERFUL
Our pass rush gets held all the time and never gets the benefit of the flag.  Hard to get pressure when the refs let the O line hold at will and often just straight-up tackle our pass rushers.
"You’re probably asking yourself, “Why’s a Browns fan here?”

I’d rather talk with the AFC North fam than bend a knee for “America’s Team”. FUCK THE COWBOYS! FUCK THE STEELERS!"
Block in the back I. Front of the ref wtfffffff
Calais obviously still isn't 100%
"They actually got a touch of pressure there, influenced the pass.  A miracle."
damn Dalton's yeeting these mfers
We’ve gotten lucky quite a few times in this game
"When Tucker misses from close, other kickers on the same field get stiff legs. Just a rule"
You’re not Tucker bitch
Not Pat! I had him do a Cameo for my grandmother and he was super sweet.
This Ingram bullshit has to stop. I feel like he's trolling us.
Ah another Ingram wasted down for 1.5 yards
"TIL AFC North starting quarterbacks have the numbers: 6, 7, 8, and 9. Pretty neat. (Still, fuck Porky the Pig Ben Roethlisberger)"
Bro ride Dobbins hes gashing them. I love Ingram but come on now
Ingram with 4 ypc. Every other RB is over 10. Get your shit together GRo
"If this is the best we can do against the Cowboys, we may as well pack it up and get a better draft pick."
Dobbins averages more yards per rush than Ingram has total yards in a game and you still give it to Ingram to waste every other 1st down
Greg Roman seriously has 3 fuckin plays
"Roman is a lost cause playing Ingram, fire that fucker"
I’m so sick of injury’s
"Absolutely horrible play calling.

Ingram misses the gap to the right of Ricard, Rciard gets injured and we get 1 yard then a QB draw, awful"
Go figure. Dobbins for 6.
Because if he tries to slam Jackson and misses it’s a TD? What does aikman not get?
KEEP FEEDING DOBBINS
What more proof do you need Roman?? Was the Titans last postseason game not enough for you to prove that Ingram just isn't the same guy anymore
keep feeding jk you fool
We don’t have a receiver in the top 50 for yards. Wild
I cant wait for this thread to tell me how Brown missed that pass.
Lamar needs to stop holding the ball.
"i've been a lamar defender all year but this game is troubling. It's not just the playcalling and receiving, he's not passing well"
Make LJ pass all off season
Why is justice hill in the ducking game?????
"Hey Roman,  


Please give the ball to Dobbins more.  


Sincerely,

Fans everywhere"
Thank God for Lamar Jackson
"It’s nice that Lamar can make those runs, but I hate the fact that he has to rely on them."
LOOK AT THAT BLOCK BY DOBBINS MAN
THATS IT LAMAR FUCK YEAH
WHAT A FUCKING PLAY
#TOE DRAG SWAG
Nice fucking catch
I'm not trying to hear shit from you niggas that keep talking down on this kid.  TOUUCCHDDOOWWNNN HOLLYWOOODD
3tds for the boy
"Holy fuck that was a fucking great throw 

And damn good footwork by marquis"
THAT IS HOW YOU THROW THE FUCKING ROCK LAMAR GOOD SHIT LETS GO
Great first down but wow not a single player is open. No separation.
Lol how the fuck does Lamar just throw a dime after throwing shit. A little more consistency will help my heart out.
What a fucking drive from Lamar.
Dobbins don’t even gotta touch the ball for the play to go well
Holy shit Hollywood cooked that guy
"Everyone here including me was like ""Lamar what the hell with that throw to Hollywood"" and they go and immediately make us eat crow."
What? Boykin and Hollywood in same game.
SOULJA BOY TELL EM
That was a perfect pass
ALSO REALLY LOVE HOLLYWOOD SEEING HE NEEDS AN OPTION AND KNOWING THERES NOR SAFETY TO STOP THAT OVER THE TOP
There's the speed! Hollywood made that defender look silly!
"Lamar working on floating the deep balls, apparently. Great throw"
"that TD was clutch, we got this as long as we don't let them score an easy TD off our fuckups. Just need the D to stay solid and cover the receivers"
THATS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU USE YOUR SOULJAS
Finally a dime pass
That’s where it’s frustrating is we know he can make that throw. It’s getting playcalls to do that and him to consistently make that play.
No more visor for lamar
Lol @ Zeke
Hollywood needs to move both arms to the ball alot happoer with him this second half
Aw man now we have to watch the defense again
He just grabbed a defender by the ankles or am I hallucinating tf was thst I’m confused what I jsut saw
Why is the secondary playing so off man. They get 7 yds before we touch them
How is it possible to have a wide open reciever on every play yet also get 0 sacks 😓
How is that not grounding
There’s that makeup call
Intentional grounding I guess isn't a penalty anymore?
"We finally get pressure, he intentionally grounds it, and they still don't throw a flag  hahahaha. These refs"
that's grounding but whatever
"Averette is a CB4 and Amari Cooper is one of the best route runners in the game. Shit happens lol. Dallas has a lot of firepower out there, relax"
Blitzing Hump on 3rd down? JFC
STOP FUCKING BLITZING IT ISN’T WORKING
DALTON HOCKS UP A DUCK TO NOBODY WITHIN THE TACKLE BOX AND GETS NO FLAG WTF
Lmao the refs are fucking atrocious this game
Wasn't Board the one crying about playing time? He has been god awful today
Can we get like 1 sack pls
"And in the 4th quarter, when Baltimore needed them most, the Defense vanished"
Two possession lead heading into the 4th with the defense reeling...where have I seen this before???
I wonder what we’d get in a trade for Ngakoue I was super hyped for the trade to get him but now I wish we looked elsewhere
Remember when we had that 13 or so sack game a few years ago? Sigh...
wait we get sacks now?
HUGE sack timing. Makes the fg much more difficult
"Jihad Ward for the first sack of the game, just like we all guessed"
Allah Akbar
Right when this thread is complaining about lack of sacks the Ravens get one. Moral of the story: let's keep doing it.
AHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
Holy shit Legatron
HOLY SHIT LMAOOOOOOOOO
#Zuerlein fucking sucks
You may beat our first 64 Blitz attempts but we’ll be dammed if you beat our 65th.
"Yo, Ricard is 310 lbs? And runs like that... Jesus, get out of the way"
LB-TE-DE-DT-MINOTAUR Pat Ricard
"Plz Lamar dont look for contact, u mean too much to the team"
"How about that jinx Aikman, look who suffered in the end? Fuck Troy Aikman"
gus edwards got a madden stat line
LETS GO LETS FUCKING GO - Lamar
OLD MAN INGRAM!!!
[deleted]
Now this is the elusive Lamar were used to after some ground and pound
This rushing attack finally looks like last year...
back-to-back good ingram runs
what happened to the first down and LOS visuals?
We're still not really giving Lamar much chance here with the play calling
"Eh I aint worried about Lamar, the dude hasnt practiced in weeks, if hes missing throws like this next week then ill be concerned"
Lol rollout to left for 5’7 Hollywood with 3 DBs on him. WTF ARE YOU THINKING ROMAN?
"He's in between now. Sailed a couple and is pulling back and driving them into the dirt. 

A full week of practise should help dial that in I think."
Gonna have to clean up his mechanics @CLE
I LOVE the sky cam on the kick offs
"can we get those vaccines in before the offseason 

gotta get working on the throwing mechanics without the bullshit looming"
"Obviously us winning is most important, but I need 5 points total between Lamar, Dobbins, and Hump to when my matchup."
he was short  right
They are just attacking Anthony Averette
Averett is a liability in coverage. He's getting worked.
Why can't our defense play well when the offense is clicking and vice versa
That clearly wasn’t no fucking first
Averrett has got wrecked all game what happened to Tramon
How is Bowser so much ahead of everyone on the D. Thats 3 times he knew and timed the snap count
Are these refs looking through a fucking kaleidoscope?
These refs are drunk tonight
Wait why is that not a turnover????
Bro Fort had that!
Throw the flag
FUCKING GARBAGE
These refs are so fucking bad it isn't funny.
THAT WAS A PICK
"that's a pick

HELLO?!?!?"
That WAS a pick
Zeke? More like Weak
Someone give LJ Fort a game ball please.
Peter’s got bitched
Peters got juked out of his fucking jockstrap.
*LJ FORT IS A BEAST*
Peters getting toasted a ton this year
I guess our opponents just can hold all day.  Fucking pathetic.
Peters is so hot and cold man
Peters gets turned around so much
Secondary is at its best when we don’t need Peters to cover a WR1 or WR2 and instead have him do his thing
How is Amari Cooper only 26? I swear he’s been playing for like a decade...?
"As soon as they showed pass on 3rd down, I knew we were fucked"
I should have never bragged before the year “Our secondary is our strength”...... oops
"We're just good enough to best Dallas, but let's be real, we're average at best right now."
Juiceman giveth and taketh away
Come on harbs why not challenge that
He’s clearly down lol
Cowboys on drugs lol
What was that even controversial?
These refs have been awful for both sides
Run these fucks over
Mans was down for like five seconds. Dallas is so blind lmao
hopefully shit baker comes back to play next week
RUN WITH GUS. FFS
Just. Give. The. Ball. To. The. Runningbacks
Everytime edwards touches the ball he gets 6-10 yards minimum but we still putting in ingram for some reason.
I love u gus
#EZ MONEY
EASY MONEY
Gonna be fun to hear skip bayless whine about this tomorrow
Officiating has been absolutely abysmal beyond belief. Cowboys probably deserve 3 off of the missed PI to end the half (though he very well may have missed it) and certainly didn’t deserve that TD on the last drive.
JK DOBBINS!!!
Good. Fuck the Cowboys
I just saw Danny devito in that weird white wig from always sunny in the crowd
You guys feeling better about our chances against Cleveland?
It’s gonna be a ***long*** flight back to Texas
DGAF the Cowboys Aikman.  Most of America doesn’t care either
EASY MONEY 💰
J.K all day
They did them so dirty playing Tuesdays gone after that
Yannick wtf was that shit
lmao @ McCarthy and Harbs repeatedly accidentally walking in the same direction
NGL that TD pass was a bad throw. Glad Boykin secured it.
NFL better hope this is an amazing game because the amount of shit that's about to come down the pipeline for still playing this game  with the Dez positive test is going to be crazy. PR nightmare if I've ever seen one.
"As someone who is a neural viewer of this game, has lamar been getting cucked like this all year by drops and stuff?"
running ingram on first down for 2 yards max and then throwing some short ass pass 2nd down every single drive gonna do that time and time again
Marlon got DPI and gave up a touchdown 😂
"Fuck the PI, they held and then blocked in the back man. How are the refs even worse with no crowd"
What’s up with the special teams play this year. Harbaugh must be livid.
FCK JOE BUCK
"I just knew that was going to happen. Felt it, even"
Erin Andrews still a dime damn
"Lamar is 7/8 right now

The one incompletion is the tipped interception"
"I wonder why Yannick has been absolutely silent since he came to Baltimore? I'm certainly not giving up on him, but what gives?"
#BUCK SUCKS BUCK SUCKS BUCK SUCKS
Run Lamar. Jesus. You had a whole field! We are we trying to contain him?
LAMAR HAS LITERALLY JUST RECOVERED FROM COVID AND HADNT PRACTICED IN WEEKS. FUCK ALL YOU SAYING HE CANT THROW.
There's one of those wasted timeouts due to slow substitutions we see once every single game for the past 10 years
"This team and Lamar are playing with a new fire, a new hope. Something is clicking now... I hope I'm right and this doesn't blow up in my face. But I feel our season is about to change for the better"
#Why does this defense ALWAYS get such bad ball spots?!?!
IDC that was a great goaline series by the defense. 5 straight stops.
This is the softest fucking secondary I’ve ever seen out of Baltimore. What happened?
"Petition to cut Hollywood and pay Lamar every penny, sign here."
That was literally Gallup's first td since week 3. Lmao. What a joke.
Just thought of this can u imagine brown even trying to catch a hail marry in between all the defenders lol
Is Lamar’s arm fixable? It wasn’t this bad last year. How has he regressed so much?
"I see a lot of toxicity in this thread. I know I’m a Browns fan, but I think y’all should give Lamar some time. To me, he’s still a 🐐"
That throw was shit. Nobody defend it.
Why. The. Fuck. Is. Roman. Calling. Pass. Plays? Hes legit a dumbass right? I mean what kind of idiot stop doing what is currently winning the game? Fuck you roman! You POS
Marquise has lost Hollywood. Any more mistakes and he’s just Marq
"""Okay now that we're down 3 no more of this running the ball business"" - Greg Roman"
Things wouldn’t be going well if Dak was playing...
Matt Judon just posted a video of him at a gun range. What the actual fuck if he’s on the Covid list shouldn’t he be home!?
Satan really picked the ravens since January to brutally ass rape but not any other fucking team. Joke
"I don't even need to refresh. R/ravens thinks it's just Hollywood's fault, and Lamar didn't just airmail an easy ass pass."
Andy dalton led cowboys with worst defense in the nfl are currently shredding us. Yep
FUCK EVERY COMMENTATOR
REMINDER TUCKER WOULDN'T BE IN THAT POSITION IF GREG ROMAN CALLED A SEMI COMPETENT PLAY ON 3RD DOWN
Boykin tries his best to fuck that up lmaooo
"Justin Tucker always says that M&T is the toughest field goal kicking stadium in the league, and I am starting to believe him."
Runs straight out of bound instead of getting a few more
Probably going to draft a safety in one of the 1st 3 rounds come April
Lamar’s mechanics are shot
Shit right there is why Hollywood is so frustrating. He can do stuff like that while doing nothing for quarters beforehand. He has the talent to be great
"Good thing about Lamar is that even when the passing isn’t happening, he can run. 

And then, would you look at that, the passing is happening 😈😈😈😈😈😈"
"Ok guys, I need to sleep for work GL"
Wtf was that tackling chuck
I like that we've started using that jet sweep motion. Shows *some* innovation and teams like the rams have some pretty successful plays with that motion
Another shitty throw to Boykin
"Hey, Ngakoue finally almost made a play when he was unblocked with a minute and a half left in the game!"
"Had the ravens just managed to win one of the coin flip games (both Steelers games, Titans, Pats) this season would look so different."
If we don’t get Dez some red zone looks bruh..
So. Excited. Love watching this team play!!
"Please let’s not underestimate the NFC east team 

But we got this bb"
Can't wait for the shit show hopefully the 3 straight losses motivate this team to stop sucking
As a ravens fan living on the west coast I’m loving these national games! Plus with lockdown today’s the perfect evening for some football.
"LET'S GO RAVENS. WE NEED SOME Ws TODAY. LET'S GET IT.

RAVENS 37 - COWBOYS 14"
"9:30am here and I got the day off, can't wait to see the squad back in action"
"Based on warmups, the Ravens' offensive line looks like this:

* LT: Orlando Brown
* LG: Bradley Bozeman
* C: Patrick Mekari
* RG: Ben Powers
* RT: Tyre Phillips

By my count, this would be the seventh different starting offensive line combination this season for the Ravens. - @jamisonhensley"
Dez aint quitting dude has always been super emotional he really wanted to play badly id be bummed to
NFL really fuckin us over man
2020 everybody. What a fuckin year its been.
Dez just tweeted he’s done for the season. This can’t be true?
this doesn't make any sense.
"Cowboys fan here, I feel so bad for Dez.  He's been shafted so many times, should have been in league last few years, and I know how much he wanted to ball out against the boys.  Brutal. I hope someone close with him takes his phone so he doesn't have anymore rage tweets."
Troy and buck luck so punchable
We got calais and B-will???
#STUNT ON THESE HOES
We need to defer we’re 6-0 when deferring
"“Comcast is required by law to black out the programming currently airing on this station” 

Uhhhh ok...."
The Dez shit just completely took the wind out of me
I swear to god if we have another outbreak and miss the fucking playoffs because of it....
Get them off the field defense lol
They fuckin' mic'd up the one dude who's gonna grunt the entire game
LJ 💪🏽
cool guys don't look at tossed zekes
Ik the game just started but the defense looks like they’re missing tackles early
I’m expecting dalton to throw to aj green
Score on the opening drive with a relentless ground and pound.  Set the tone early.
A broncos fan here to root for you guys against the cowboys best of luck and zeke can't get 14 points in fansty or there kicker can you please help me with that and thank you
Of course we have to get some fox bullshit mixed in here
"Ok, I get it.. Ingram is the ""starter""  but where my boy JK?"
Why in gods name is Ingram still starting?
Lamar got the good legs!!
Does Ingram have Roman's nudes?
If Roman finds a way to NOT feed JK the ball in this game I will riot.
these play calls are dead
It marquise goes backwards one more time
Hollywood ran the wrong way... 🤦‍♂️
Did he really run backwards?
Run the other way Souljia you fucking moron.
Ok... Idc if we win or lose use the fucking younger guys that have looked better. I don't get why they keep forcing shit and expecting it to work.
Why are you running backwards LMAO
Lmao great
Goddamn it marquise
Marquise was so turned around for that catch the I thought it was an interception for a second
Nice tip soulja
I can’t even watch. We’re so fucking bad.
"fucking worthless receivers, typical"
Bench hollywood
Fuck I just want this season to end
Marquise needs to start putting in more effort man oh man
I don’t understand why he even threw that to hollywood. No chance of a first down
BROWN IS ASS!!!!!
I’m tired of how we use marquise
"Greg Roman. You have JK Dobbins. Weekly reminder. Don’t be a idiot sandwich, you donut"
"Get that useless fucking piece of shit out of the game, what a fucking bust receiver"
Who’s drinking tonight
"Cut Brown dude, Im over his shit."
"This team, still, just doesn’t have it. Can’t click. Just not there. People surely can open their eyes now"
I feel like that ball was extremely catchable
And now his mindset is gonna be fucked...
"That's why Hollywood can't be any kind of possession or lead receiver.  The slightest bit of contact (in no way a penalty of any kind) and he doesn't even try to make the catch.  The ball was there for him and he didn't even put 2 hands up, that was some Perriman bullshit."
Practice squad guys playing better than the starters
THIS FUCKING BUM IS OUR FIRST ROUND DRAFT PICK
Hollywood. Dude. C'mon.
Whenever I participate in the game thread during the game we end up sucking. So I’ll see you guys later lol
I’ve seen Brown have the ball hit his hands and not catch it more than I’ve seen him catch it
Lol cant fucking wait until we fire roman
First possession and any onlooker would think we are already down by two scores
It's not his fault that he is short not strong not that quick to get separation
Why are we still starting Ingrim? I really don't understand what they are seeing that I'm not.
"I am honestly shocked that we had such a good offense last year.  Is it really all the O-line?  Most of the offense is the same except for the O-line, but we just look so awful this year."
"So much for the Cowboys having a bad offensive line lol, the Ravens are getting nowhere near Dalton"
This is germane but did anyone notice the redhead erasure on dalton’s headshot graphic on fox?
"They have one of the worst lines, yet I don’t think we even have a pressure."
"Even with a prime time home game, all the announcers can talk about is the shitty ass Cowboys"
I blame Greg Roman more than any individual offensive player with his old stale scheme
Time to go take the lead and never look back. Leggo boys
can we please use dobbins he’s our best RB
"Marquise is a huge bust and no one will realize it but the fans. The team will just cover up his flaws and say we see no problem because of his stats. But in reality my guy is a BUM and AJ Brown, Metcalf or Samuel would of been hella better picks"
Donald Trump's hands are bigger than Hollywood's hands
"How did Ingram drop off so much in a year? 1,200 yards to this?"
Got the pick out the way. Let's get it together.
Maybe use our best running back this drive idk
Why tf are we not giving dobbins the ball
WHERES DOBBINS
It’s almost as if Gus is better than Ingram
"We are like the inverse-Steelers: instead of playing down to inferior competition, our weak opponents play up against us"
We need a true #1 WR desperately
Keep dobbins in
Jk looks to be 100%
Jesus Christ Dobbins is so good
I thought we benched Skura.
"Dobbins is literally 3x better than ingram, yet that was his first snap"
Lol. Can’t even snap.
Would you look at that? Dobbins is good. Use him Greg.
That’s the last we’ll see of Dobbins tonight lol
That’s the drive
The ghost of Skura
Even when Hollywood doesn't fuck up he still pisses me off
THIS IS WHY U HAND THE BALL OFF TO DOBBINS
Why did we trade hurst
Soulja sighting
LET. DOBBINS. COOK.
Maybe we could try sending our fastest WR more than 2 yards down field.
The kid gets picked up and thrown like a middle schooler with one arm from a struggling linebacker smh
Truss
There’s the MVP!
LAMARRRRRRR
Just run the entire game. No need to throw
Look Greg even FOX has a Dobbins graphic
I need some Passing TDs though for real
"#OH

#LORT"
LAMAAAAAAAAA
Let this be the rebirth of the Ravens 2020 season!
YES! THAT IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE
Let’s fucking go!!
Let's fucking gooooo
The MVP is fucking BACK
Think he’s covid free
Greg Roman: time to pass 80 times. Ingram is staying in. Dobbins you’re benched
#WE 2019 RAVENS BOI
"Let's fuckin gooooo!

Thats the Llama I know. Telling the special team to stay on the sideline and let him go for it. And then score. LETS GO BABY!"
Did they show Dez with no mask playing with his phone after testing positive for Covid?
Mmmmm  fuck yeah. I would die for Lamar.
The red sea just fucking parted
That's my Llama
Cowboys practicing physical distancing
Are we Navy now?
THATS MY MVP
Heeeeeeeesssss baaaaaaaaack
"Lol #77 pulling the Steph Curry and celebrating because he knows Lamar gone, a.k.a, Klay has an open 3 😂"
Where's the guy who says Danny Dimes is faster than Lamar? When Lamar hits the gas it is over
Lol
"God damn, our tackling has been really bad for weeks now, seeping into special teams now too."
I am once against asking to be drunk
#THIS IS WHY WE CANT HAVE NICE THINGS
Tucker just saved us from a TD return
cmon son
Wide open. Defense playin gross RN
Can we uhhhhh make a tackle
What's with the short kicks?
"One of our players (Gus?) was held on that huge return.

Refs didn't call it. Interesting."
FYI the Cowboys are playing PS OL and we can’t get to Dalton
We’ve gifted them everything so far. I’m not worried but they gotta clean up the poop
Nothing is easy with this team damn
... wow. And they just talked up Marlo.
How the fuck we can’t get no pressure on this ginger
"Everything Troy Aikmen says, the opposite happens"
Cant even stop them even while holding them....... so the D will be horrible this game? Jfc can we have some consistency?
"Such an obvious hold on #49 on the kickoff, need to bounce back this drive"
"everytime there's a flag, I'm like ""what'd we do now?"" smh..."
I think Yannick is cursed. Vikings are dogshit with him and then great without him. We are good without him and then shit with him.
[deleted]
"No excuses, Marlo got worked on that."
Lmao this defense getting worked by a bunch of scrubs
I guess if its gonna be called DPI then at least save the TD.  Still love you Marlo
You can’t really blame the defense when you keep putting them in tough spots
I’m so tired of 1-2 yards on every first down play
Keep running the goddamn ball
GUS BUSSSSSS
"It may be a home game, but the team still chartered the Gus bus"
GUS BUSSSSS
THANK GOD WERE FINALLY JUST RUNNING AND MINIMAL PASSING
it’s time to bench Ingram and feed gus and jk
I’m sorry I love Mark but unless the other two need a breather I don’t want him running anymore
Power-I HB Dive call it 30-40 times.
"Pretty simple, we run until they stop us"
KEEP DOBBINS IN
Joe Buck saying what we're all thinking about Dobbins over Ingram.
Omg take ingram out he’s washed
Glad that Hollywood is getting involved at least
I hope Ingram wants to coach with us. He’s obviously losing his spot but i love that man
Good job by Ricard to avoid block in the back.
That’s it roman.... ABANDON the run
1 bad play call from Roman prevents a potential td drive.
The check down was his first read lol
We should try throwing past the first down line
Why are we coming out of the huddle with 10 seconds on the play clock? Speed the fuck up.
JINX
Yeah knew that would happen.
This game is cursed
"Omg false start on a field goal we suck end the season -thisnsub

I jinxed it sorry"
Lol
Literally nothing can go right for us.
we must be in a parallel universe
Ok. For real. That should be a bad omen if there was one
Cursed season
These are actually the worst announcers holy fuck dogshit analysis over and over
pain
This simply isn’t our season
Jinx fucker announcers
I'm going to chug the tequila idgaf. What's happening
IT'S THE MADDEN CURSE!!!!
Fucking Joe Buck keep your whore mouth shut until after it goes through
FUCK BUCK
"Special Teams, Kicking, Offense, and Defense are all shitting the bed today"
"Well fuck, even the GOAT messed up."
“Let’s jinx the kicker for about 8 minutes straight”
Lmao @ people who believe in jinxes
Fucking announcers. Always. Just keep your mouth shut about kickers. Fucking aye.
My head is going to explode from frustration. Seriously
Defense please go off!
"Lol this feels like a game we feel like we are winning but lose because of these moments. Good teams don't make these mistakes, we are average."
Announcers jinxing the GOAT get fucked Buck
"hahah, we even get announcer jinxed. this shit is too funny :D

&#x200B;

ALSO ANOTHER PENALTY!!! THIS TEAM IS SO ORGANIZED AND WELL COACHED!"
"The Washington teams de-throned the Steelers and Justin Tucker misses a field goal kick?! 

2021 can't come soon enough. Also, I would like to go back my own reality. This alternate universe sucks."
joe buck showers with his socks on
yo people are making posts out of comments haha
"I wonder if the guy controlling the crowd noise at the stadium tonight has our ""bullshit"" chant from years back on his soundboard"
We just iced our own kicker huh...
HE NEVER MISSES. HE HAS MADE SO MANY IN A ROW. HE IS PERFECT! Obviously the announcers have nothing to do with the kick but it’s so annoying how often they seem like they’re deliberately leaning into the “announcers jinx” thing.
This commentary team needs to shut the fuck up
Yea I’m going to go ahead and call it a quit for the rest of the season... I can’t deal with this
PATRICK QUEENNNNNNN
Muh Queen
#QUEEN
YAAAAAAAAS QUEEN
So happy to have B Wil back. Dude is a MASSIVE presence
Holy shit Boykin was naked
KILLER QUEEN HAS ALREADY TOUCHED THE FOOTBALL
There you go Boykin
Boykin sighting OMG
Aight let’s get it baby
WHAT IS THIS GAME LOL
This first half has Been a fucking roller coaster
TD. Let's fucking go boys
Well that was quick.
Well that was fucking easy!
THATS MY BOYKIN
PQueen is a better ball catcher than most of our ball catchers
Ok... I’ll take a do-over. Lol.
That’s how you bounce back. With a boink.
BOYKIN!!!
Wtf Boykin did something!!
BOYKIN IS INVOLVED HOLY SHIT THE COWBOYS ARE FUCKED NOW. EAT SHIT TROY AND BUCKY BOY
"Nice catch by Queen and then a nice catch by Boykin!  Both great catches!  Honestly, Lamar really floated that ball, almost left that play on the field, Boykin did a great job on that play!"
Justin Tucker playing 4D chess out there; miss the field goal to set up the touchdown
"Wait Boykin is our WR1?

Always has been"
Tucker was planning for the long term with that miss.
Let’s go Boykin!!!!
Boykin is our best receiver rn
What a fucking catch.
What a catch by Queen using the pinky to keep it from the ground
SO HAPPY FOR BOYKIN
Y'all see how boykin didn't celebrate with brown ???
Cant believe a ravens receiver was that open
BOYKIN DID SOMETHING!!
Such a rare sight to see our WRs catch the ball AND get some YAC.
WHERE THE BOYKIN HATERS AT ‼️
Dez definitely stole Boykin’s jersey.
"My stream is super behind, but let it be known that I always believed in 80"
"And Queen just gets caught off in coverage, needs to fix that up still"
You know I'm convinced that ball to Boykin would have been Dez if he was playing and that makes me kinda sad for Dez
That reverse is on jaylon ferguson
Queen my dude you GOTTA learn to cover those intermediate zones. It's an MLBs bread and butter
Queen out of position
This line is STUFFING Zeke. Impressive stuff.
I smell a Zeke fumble very soon!
Come on d
Take in the Cowboys had 12 days to prepare for us
Uhhhhh pass D you gonna show up???
Peters god damn
Secondary cmon man
Wolfe is such an underrated run stuffer
"Weird, peters doing jack shit against a scrub wideout on third down"
wolfe is lowkey one of the best FA decisions we made
D-line needs to step up. If they can get past the backups in for Dallas’ O-line pass D isn’t an issue
"wolfe has come to life these last 4 or so games, feel like he wasn’t doing much before"
Middle of the field been open all day
This defense is a shadow of its former self damn
May I please get a crumb of pass rush?
Derek Wolfe is putting up a good season quietly. He was great last week as well.
Absolutely have no answer for the passing game
"Peters is so confusing, he recognizes plays before the ball is snapped, but still gets burned on every route."
Let’s make it 28-13 after the first drive of the 3rd.
Lol
Yo refs I know it's hard to do an easy job but he went out of bounds the clock should stop
Alright boys we need a methodical drive downfield now and we get the ball at half
You miss a field goal and you miss a field goal! Everybody's missing field goals!!!
Wind must be ripping across the 10 yard line. Typical MT bank crosswind that doesn’t show on the post
So dis the rules for the clock running change? He ran out of bounds then they had a penalty and the clock never stopped
WWE
Fuck off Fox commentators
"“I would argue that that ball wasn’t catchable” 

Shut the fuck up. Uncatchable PIs are obviously a thing this year."
The most obvious pass interference ever
Jesus Christ Aikman it went over his head because he was hauled down while jumping for it.
Thats the first pi called for the Ravens all year....
Like I said last time he played.. this nigga JK Dobbins is different
Definitely an uncatchable ball but officials never ever call that anymore
Holy shit it's like Dallas doesn't have a run defense
Greg Roman is going to use that play as an excuse to not use dobbins next half
dobbins is the future
"After long run: START DOBBINS
very next play: BENCH DOBBINS"
Soulja
"Is it just me, or do these pitches to the RB on the outside never work"
Do Troy and Buck know that there’s another team not named the Dallas Cowboys playing tonight?
I want us to call some of those power runs we did with RG3 and Trace last week where we pull the whole line almost. I haven't seen us do that with Lamar.
"So has Brown regressed?  I feel like he would have had that toe-drag last year, but not this year..."
we gotta fix these illegal formations
Is that DeCosta on the sideline?
Even my stupid ass could see that was illegal formation like clockwork
Every. Single. Mother. Fucking. Game.
oh my god Buck can you please stop talking about it now
Holy shit - that is so sloppy and unforgivable.  Too many illegal formations week in and week out
How have we not fixed these presnap penalties?
How do we have that same penalty EVERY GAME
how many formation fouls are we going to get this year? we get 1 or 2 a game it's so dumb
I'm gonna pluck my pubes if I hear another illegal formation penalty this year
Cumberland Blues outro!
Lol Grateful Dead before every commercial
How is there another illegal formation penalty. How????
Dude. At this point I don’t blame the players. Greg fix this scheme so we have less Illegal formations. Whatever you’re doing now is not working for the guys FFS
Isn’t it actually better that Tucker missed the kick? The interception and TD wouldn’t have happened if he didn’t miss
Fucker can’t jinx tucker again
"Well if there was a time to get the weekly illegal formation, might as well get it here where we were just gonna get 3 anyway instead of negating a big play"
I can’t stand the illegal formation penalties. This has to be on Roman; how do you call a play that’s illegal before it’s even snapped!
Hollywood lost his speed from muscle gainz? I rather have him be fragile and be fast.
Can’t have a ravens game without illegal formation
Baffling how undisciplined and error prone the team is this year. So many unforced errors.
Our offense could be the same juggernaut as last year and I would still be cool with firing GRo just for the illegal formations.
Greg Roman got a 0 on the wonderlic score
THEY CALLED THAT A FIRST DOWN?
Play tight for 20 more seconds
Our pass rush can’t get past a practice squad line btw
"0 pressure and sitting in soft man / zone, that’s the only way Dallas is gonna gain yards so why are we playing like that?"
Please don’t let them score
Come on wink
Can't generate an ouce of pass rush man. Smh.
Pick 6 incoming
"Andy Dalton standing in the pocket with hours of time every snap, rush is so bad."
How is Andy Dalton driving down the field at will
I just realized this is a Buckeye back battle.
That’s a great open-field tackle by Averett.
"I didn't know Averrett was back. He's not great, but once you get beyond him our CB depth is not so good."
"Averett, nice tackle. Too many people let cooper go in a situation like that."
"Sweet baby Jehoshaphat can you fucking sack the ginger please 


Don’t just feel up his linemen. I know they’re beefy but good damn sack his ass"
For such an amazing defensive lineup they just can't get stops when it matters.
Has Campbell or Williams played a single snap yet this game?
Have we touched Dalton at least once this game? Why are we not getting to the QB?
Watch them get first down anyway
Really questionable series from Wink.
Am I the only one that thinks Humphrey could’ve picked that
Lol we def just got away with one
Seeing Dalton get clocked felt good
Hey the officials helped us for once. Still fuck Aikman though
That's a blown call ngl
Us benefitting from bad officiating? Against the cowboys? That's absolutely wild
Aikman should never call a cowboys game ever again.  It’s like listening to Bill Simmons talk about the Celtics 🤮
so this is how the steelers feel
"Whoa that was a terrible call. 

^oh well"
We got bailed out by the refs right there.
Refs might be wearing their masks over their face
Not a bad DPI there given the play. Take the yards not the TD. But still a bad miss by the refs.
This is galaxy brain shit from McCarthy.
If Tuck gets a shot at a 60+ yarder I guarantee he makes it to make up for the miss earlier
"Honestly, that was a spectacular throw by Dalton.  We lucked out that Lamb couldn't haul it in!"
Why the fuck do you not rush anyone???
After that first half I can say this game is certainly being played like it's a Tuesday
Glad we didn’t have Gregg Williams 😂
"I assumed that was going to be deflected to AJ Green, even though AJ Green does not play for the Cowboys"
Wow our D attempt at this Hail Mary was pathetic
"Terrible end of half defense ngl, bad hold that should've been a flag and then almost gave up the hail mary"
"float like a butterfly, catch like a lamb"
"Wow I’ve never seen a commercial shot exclusively with a Samsung Galaxy, Justin. Very cool!"
"We have a lot of issues that need to be addressed this offseason hard to try and put together an order.... 
IOL 
WR 
Edge/Pass Rush 
TE (depth) 
Corner (slot depth Tavon is just too injury prone)"
"Kind of worried that the covid outbreaks plus injury bug will allow this organization to think we've just had bad luck this season. Granted we've had horrible luck, but there's also a lot that we're not doing well."
Lamar really needs to stop sailing these passes.
Is being a Ravens fan enough to get a medical marijuana card? Asking for a friend
Won a game of online chess during halftime. Gotta love it.
"classic

either a terrible play call, receiver drop/no effort, or lamar overthrow

all year"
Lamar is making a habit of switching his throw angle when he doesn’t even need to. Qb coach should be all over that but nah
It's looks like Roman airmailed another one
Holding wtf???
Our defense is making andy dalton look like 2019 lamar 😂
HOLY SHIT WAS THAT NOT A HOLD
Dalton has all day. Unbelievable
Defense is playing with bo fucking heart man. Wtf also refs are blind not see 2 holds on that dalton pass
Calais is extremely rusty I think he’ll be fine next week
I wish I could suck at my job and still get a fat paycheck
Wink with the 1 handed catch
Hook it again
Miss
There's only one Zeke in this town...and his last name is Cohen
So can this team just not play defense until the opponent is in field goal range?
We could run the ball here to close out the game but I sense more side arm shenanigans from Roman and Lamar
Ok here we go. Let’s put this away.
Refs are terrible
I love how there are Giants and WFT fans joining in the game thread this week
Noooooooooooooooooooooooo Ricard
"Why can't Ingrahm get >2 yards per rush? Different plays he's in on, or just not able to find holes?"
2 yard Ingram
"I'm really disappointed that Harbaugh doesn't tell Roman to put Dobbins in, jfc"
Ingram??? You either give the ball to Dobbins or Gus!! Get the goddam memo Greg.
"It’s mind blowing that gus and dobbins only have 9 carries combined. They are clearly our 2 best runningbacks, our passing game sucks, and the cowboys run defense sucks. Give them the ball and we win easily."
I don’t know how dobbins doesn’t get AT BARE MINIMUM 15 touches a game. I just don’t understand.....
Roman with the 1000 iq move to not play our backs that are averaging 10 yards per carry. Cowboys will never expect it
"Why in the hell are we not play-actioning?

And when we do, why does it always look like the exact same play?

We are gashing them on the ground, G. Ro!"
Harbaughs pose is a mood
Dobbins is just so much more explosive than Ingram
Some absolute trash throws by Lamar.
Awful throws all night
This is embarrassing
Why is he in on every third down?!?!
I wish Lamar's passes were as good as his legs.
Jackson like disgusted he had to run there lol or that he didn't pick up more yards
TD. Hollywood
Getting 13 yards there is something no other QB could do
"Hell yeah, Brown!"
FAST BOI
We need a young OC that will help Lamar succeed not being senile fails to make adjustments
SOULJA BOI
SOULJA
Okay that TD to Hollywood was hella impressive
Hollywood is now a PFC. No longer a Private
Great block by Dobbins there!
Today he is a legit soulja what a throw
#What a fucking pass!
That's exactly the sort of thing that Brown is supposed to be doing.
SOULJA
REDEMPTION ARC
This has been your once-a-game cool marquise highlight
how he hits those and misses dudes 5 yards out???
LJ DIMES
Dime
Yo hollywood you made a legit play there
That's a good throw
anyone get flashbacks to that arizona game last year? same thing dropped the mother fucker right where it needed to be
Feed Hollywood my god
AWESOME THROW AWESOME CATCH LOVE TO SEE IT
RIP that cornerback. Holy shit. He did everything he could.
"Jerry ""Diet Coke"" Jones in shambles"
are the browns going to nuke us with this defense?
How was that not grounding bs refs
"Oculus commercial honestly just had disclaimers say:

""Not actual gameplay, do not attempt"" and then the commercial shows the girl letting go of a building falling.

&#x200B;

Next, the disclaimer says ""Do not play near obstacles or pets"" and it literally shows her playing by a couch, coffee table, mirror and dog..lmao"
How that not grounding tho
I'll let that missed intentional ground call slide after the missed DPI on us in the first half.
I don’t think anyone saw how big Wolfe would be for us.
Make up call for the DPI non call in first half
Lol this defense fucking sucks
"Oh look, we didn’t tackle again on 3rd down!"
Maybe we leave our best corner in coverage
LMAO a check down goes for a first on third and 8 because of a missed tackle. My god this defense stinks.
We need to stop blitzing and force dalton to beat our coverage.
No excuse for that conversion.
Good shit LJ.
I feel bad for dez but someone take this dude’s phone
Blitzing Humphrey on 3rd is fucking stupid. Stop doing it.
"Dez is hilarious right now on Twitter, he’s had to much wine"
Defense has been ass tonight straight up.
"fort jumps it sooner, that's a pick"
Ezekiel Elliot is averaging 5.2 yards a carry and they're still having Dalton throw is 30+ times
Heard McPhee call out that Chris Board went the wrong way on that 3rd down conv
TBF Cowboys are loaded on offense. If Prescott was out there it probably be tied
"Some of these calls feels like Wink is high on his own press clippings.

It's 3rd and 7+. You don't always need an exotic blitz. Man up Humphrey and Peters and let them play. Playing 7 yards off and sending the house is. not. working."
Fort actually wraps up when tackles and i love it
1/4
1/4 lmao fucking wow
"# OH

# LORT"
Another missed field goal? Are there air spirits tending the goal posts or something? What is going on out there tonight?
RICARD IS DADDY AF.
When Tucker fails EVERYONE FAILS
Imagine not having Justin Tucker.
#yasss Ricard is back
I love Pat Ricard. Dude's great.
We used to dump off play action to Rickard every game last year. Nice to see that back
"man i really feel for Zuerlein, they really gotta stop trying with him"
Project Pat yeeted that DB
I love Ingram but this should be his last game unless someone gets hurt
love seeing lamar come hype up whoever after a big play. such a great leader
# THIS IS THE KIND OF OFFENSIVE PLAY CALLING I LIKE TO SEE
I’d feel so bad for Zurlein if he did this against a different team. But since it’s my team I’m overjoyed
Lamar please slide
I honestly love how the opposing D aint even mad when Lamar scrambles on them. They pat him on the helmet every time.
Lamar’s playing his game right now. I love it.
Those look like 2019 rushing numbers. Love to see it.
Ingram with big boy carries now!
Good couple runs by ingram
Ingram looks good on this drive
is mark andrews still out? haven’t been able to keep track of the situation due to finals
Come on JK TD
Where are the visuals??
I want to see more of that right there from Lamar (minus the incompletion obviously lol) but his athleticism could make him a Russel Wilson level magician in the pocket
Lamar been balling today Hope we see this Lamar all season
"Man, a better throw would've been a TD. It's okay though. Hay is basically already in the barn at this point."
I like that Lamar is giving Boykin a some looks at least we need him to show up for us
Wonder if Aikman ever got over that no-call dpi before the half
That Play was only made possible because of Lamar . 1 day of practice and dude is balling making the throws he needs and has extended drives when needed
We still trying to trade for Gallup?  Very down
Why we no sack bad QB? :(
Averret sucks
And Bowser is still mastering the snap count.
Bad spot
What a spot
how the absolute hell was that a first
Averett getting lit up like a Christmas tree
Our DBs are good at tackling today. Too bad not a single play on the ball.
Bruh Averett is getting COOKED as per usual
humphrey plz
"regardless of the awful spot, there was no reason dalton should have gotten a throw off with the entire line swarmed around"
"Look at like fort, most players would let that go he goes full speed deserves a big payday"
THAT IS NOT PI
Bro that’s just fucking perfect coverage
That was an INT too
He caught that in bounds
That was an interception are these the same refs as our game tf
Ticky tack penalty.
Fuckint refs are BEYOND INCOMPETENT.
Zeke ain’t gettin shit
This goal line stand must be huge for morale
Nice having Williams back
Oh fuck off. All that hard work and you just leave Cooper wide open.
Sweet coverage Peter’s
Fucking refs man.
Peters is so frustrating
"Great pass and catch and blown coverage, our D line has me hype as hell for that almost goal line stand though"
Peters is so confusing
Refs gifted that wtf
Run the clock down
Phish freeeee played for the commercial transition!!!
This cowboy team sure is stupid.
Sticky hands porche
Just pound out some runs here
That was a very bad play
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST ROMAN IS GONNA GET LAMAR FUCKING KILLED
Lord these refs are clowns I can’t believe this man stared an interception down from 3 meters away and couldn’t call it.
Really wish we’d stop running with Lamar when there’s 4 mins left and up 10. Bless the knees
Give. The. Football. A. Bus. Pass.
"Run it with ingram on third down. He got it, but man, Greg Roman is stupid."
GUS DADDDDDDY AFFFFFFFF
Gus is pulling madden averages.
Cowboys got thrown under the BUS
Edwards is a MONSTER.  Stays in bounds on a 24 yard carry when we're trying to close out this game.  Amazing.
"Ingrahm: ""look at those yards I got""

GUS: ""LMAO NO"""
Running w/ Lamar is just idiotic right now. Just give it to Gus or JK. Jesus.
GUS EDWARDS WITH THE DOWNFIELD RUNNING
"GUS #1
DOBBINS #2
INGRAM #3"
Imagine having your qb run right now...
"It's a nice win but this Cowboys defense... Good God, they really suck. It's embarrassing for them"
"99.9% chance of victory.

GG no re"
290 rushing is madden level shit
DOBBINS!! TD!!
Let them have fun y’all
#EASY MONEY
Troy aikman didn't like that
I think JK has made more than enough of a case to be the starter from here on out.
Hay is in the barn
EAT DOBBINS EAT
Ingram really clicked with that kid.
Troy is DEPRESSED!!! Lmao
Honestly if we don’t use Ingram we could out run the browns
EASY MONEY
This was a great gameplan for playing the Cowboys. I hope we realize it probably isn't a good one for most of the other games.
Somber bench cowboys
I’m just happy we crushed Andy Dalton
Just straight up abusing Averett with these curls
Aight boys onto the Cleveland Clowns
are you fuckin kidding me
lol at Ward flopping on the field for the TO
how many masks is Lamar going to put on lol
Dalton 4th and long.... except this time it’s meaningless :)
The bois are back in town
I remember a couple years in the Mid 2010s where the NFC was tough but mostly the AFC is where the big boys play football. My Pack might not beat any of those good teams coming out of the AFC and we have a lot of work to do to get there.
Can we play the cowboys every week
We’re down by a field goal. You’d think we just gave up 3 touchdowns in a row unanswered based on these comments jfc
"What’s with all the sudden hate for Lamar? Not antagonizing, I’m genuinely curious."
Yannick ain't getting paid based on this game.
Wolfe gives it everything he's got can't say the same about some of our players on D
This is an abysmal performance from the secondary. Extremely disappointing.
"Man, Rams and Chiefs fans really tried warning us about Marcus Peters"
"""really the best run team in the NFL, and John Harbaugh is among the best in the league.""

- Troy Aikman on the Ravens, Tuesday Night Football."
If we make the playoffs our team will have vaccinated themselves while other teams are catching it we will.be fully.healthy
I know that if I were in Dez’s shoes I’d be fuming and probably not be thinking straight. I bet he calms down and uses this as further motivation to come back strong.
That was an awful throw.
WR #15 strikes again
That was both on Lamar and Hollywood. That play had no chance and who tips the ball like that
This is a pattern now whenever we force the ball to hollywood bad things happen
NO LAMAR SLANDER EVER. NONE. HE IS NOT THE PROBLEM.
Justice Hill on third down is probably the lowest iq play I could imagine
FUCK YOU AIKMAN FUCK YOU
"This team is so sad right now. You IMMEDIATELY check down to nothing on 3rd and long, then false start in a dead quiet stadium, then miss a gimme FG.

Zero focus."
FUCK JOE BUCK
Marquise “Hollywood” “Four-yard Pickup” “Two-Hand Touch” Brown
we deserve one of those calls after all the bullshit we've gotten thrown at us
Am I the only sports fan that thinks talking about announcer jinxes is fucking stupid?
Ive always found Erin Andrews sexy
"Crazy thing is, Lamar has an offseason trainer. Like what the fuck was he doing?!"
"They’re making fun of Calais but at least he made it through, our D-lines pressure is non existent too often."
Lamar just silenced everyone in here. Shhhhhhhhh shhhhhhhhh
if Lamar can ever make those passes consistently it’s seriously our league for at least 3 years if we continue to build around him
That’s on Lamar. Shits gotta get fixed. Still taking the 3.
I just can't with Greg fucking Roman. Man's a run game genius but he is utter GARBAGE with his passing plays. Fffs
LAMAR PUT THE MASK OVER HIS NOSE !!!
"A win is a win, but I was definitely hoping tonight’s was of the “this team appears to be back on track and there’s confidence going forward” variety and not “we were lucky to have played such a shitty team who tried their best to give the game away and STILL put up a fight.”"
"If the NFL takes covid seriously, they have to cancel the game.  If the game get's played, it means the NFL cares nothing about player safety."
Scoring 17 against one of the worst defenses in nfl history is just not going to work. This team is round one cooked; that’s assuming we make the playoffs.
Awful throw again.
I mean that play was all Lamar lmao put it right in the bread basket and he still almost dropped it
"Lamar should have had that but that was an inexcusably bad playcall. You line up everybody left, and leave Lamar with one route to Hollywood on a rollout right? Like how does Greg Roman draw that play up and think it’s a good idea?"
Guys we need to keep in mind Lamar is coming back from COVID. We have no idea how it’s still affecting his body
Bruh chill we the ravens man. We ain’t even playing bad we got spoiled last year. Now let’s not act like spoiled brats
Y’all need to chill. It’s the first quarter.  Shake some rust off and let’s see how we are by halftime
How can we rationalize playing this game when someone who was just on the field with all of them tested positive....just sayin this is sketchy
are we about to make elliot look good again?? fuck me.
"Shit throw, shit call and shit effort on catch"
that's a bad pass and bad route
Why the hell didn’t we tak DK Metcalf or AJ Brown?
"Look at these concepts. They run gallup from the inside and break off on a corners route, while the rest all run opposite to spread the D. 

I just do not get why we cant look at other concepts from other teams and use them, lmao. We barely even let Lamar take a snap from center, it's so infuriating.

This is the type of shit that causes player to stagnate in development. I want to get rid of our first if we dont have a high pick and trade for a good WR. At least improve in one fucking area since our DL is constantly decimated"
Y’all keep talking shit about Lamar lol
Feels like we’re trying to keep this a game...come on guys. Tighten up.
Did anyone expect a rusty team with no practice to be spot on. We just have to escape with a win. The gloom and doom here is fucking cleveland status and I wont accept it
"Our defense isn’t bad, but they aren’t as good as advertised.  If you’ve watched the games all year it’s obvious they can be picked apart."
HOW IS THAT NOT A HOLD PUSHING OUR PLAYER DOWN
Y’all can’t really blame the defense here. The drive started on our 30...
We're down to the fucking Andy Dalton led cowboys lmao
"I will remind you again that this exact same thing happened vs the Patriots. 

There is too much resources and effort dumped into this defense for them to give up TDs.

And that is my problem with dumping all your resources into the defense...because if you are depending on the unit you neglected in the off season to help your defense out...

Yeah, good luck."
I can’t believe we’ve already given up 10 points to a team that hasn’t been relevant since Kurt Cobain wrote a Nirvana album.
oh come on lamar? he was looking at hill the whole play
Fuck Troy Aikman dirty cowboys scumbag piece of shit
[deleted]
We need tall recievers because Jackson airmails everything.
Ngl this game is kinda wild
I've been watching football for a majority of my life. But...like...what is this game?
"Yes baker it does stink in your stadium, it hosts the browns and it's in cleveland"
Was that even catachable? Seemed way too for from Lamb
"Queen actually believed he was getting to dalton, and sadly that's about the best look we've had"
"Is it just me, or do we never have athletic WRs? I mean it seems like Dallas always has some guys with significant physicality. We have lil Hollywood. And even when we spent a draft pick on a receiver, it was Perriman who never showed any real physical flashes.  

Why can’t we draft WRs!?"
How about that No. 1 WR for Baltimore huh guys? Wasn't it a brilliant idea for the front office to send Jackson out there with him as his go to WR?
Are these shlubs in the booth just gonna but hug the cowboys all fucking game
I am fine if Ingram never takes another snap.
The fact that this a game with the 3-8 Cowboys has me incredibly worried boys
Lamar sure dont look like he just recovered from COV19!
Dropping Mcphee and blitzing humphrey?
ravens are the best team in the league
They would give up the 4th down lmfaoooo
Jimmy smith is the best CB. Secondary turns to shit when we he doesn’t play.
"Harbaugh is a bitch for not throwing the challenge flag, we could’ve had the ball but instead it’s still a game"
We will lose to the browns. Chunt will shred us.
Even tucker......... jfc man. What a fucking shit show this team is
Hell yea Brandon Scott's finally mayor
[deleted]
Ngakoue is looking like a fairly big bust at this point ngl
"No matter what happens I love this team till I die.

Edit: Spelling"
"it’s a Tuesday night , I don’t want to drink but ... I’ll start with one beer"
Is this real life?
">According to @JayGlazer, Dez Bryant had an inconclusive COVID-19 test this morning and thought he could play tonight. When he was warming up, the doctors pulled him because the test was inconclusive. They retested him at the stadium. That test came back positive. He was sent home - @jonmachota"
No DEZ tonight. Shit
With or without dez we should no way in shape or form lose to these Dallas Cowboys
"If the Ravens lose this game I’m gonna be so sad, you’re all gonna be like “hey champ, you ok” and I’ll be like “:( don’t call me champ”"
McPhee Campbell and Williams  all back. Plus the monster of Wolfe the unsung hero this year also that's an elliot on elliot tackle
I’m tired of Andy Dalton he needs to go away
2 minutes in: WHO SHOULD WE FIRE RN
Who is #33 again? I was impressed with him last game.
LET'S GOOOOO D
3rd and 24??? bring the blitz
"Lamar finna come out in the second half with sleeves, it's cold as fuck rn."
I’m convinced our defense could intercept every pass except one and someone in the thread would say we’re gonna lose based on one catch
"Lamar, Ingram and Dobbins shouldn't run a lot this game. COVID can affect your cardio big time. I expect to see a lot of Gus today"
Here we go
Why is Dobbins not the feature back!!
Ingram huh?
Why Ingram in?
Thanks for your commercial Fox my relatives are now arguing
#Hes baaaack
Take fucking ingram out. Why the fuck is he in?
I don't care how fooled a defense is by a screen...likely need some blockers near the runner
Ingram has the ball 2 times. Gains 3 yards...
"They really told Dobbins ""you the starter...jk its gonna be Ingram's geriatric ass"""
HOLLYWOOD. STOP GOING FUCKING BACKWARDS YOU LITTLE PUSSY
"fucking why, ingram was great and i love having him on the team, but just fucking use Dobbins fuck"
Not a great pass wasnt even going to be a 1st if caught
Brown is soft and short arms shit.
That ones on Hollywood
WR #15 got popped after that pick
Soulja
Hollywood has two arms. I wonder if he knows that.
"God, Brown is really not that good."
Brown is awful
What the fuck was that route supposed to accomplish 3 yards behind the first down marker?
How useful is Hollywood in run-blocking?
Not a great throw but come on Hollywood
Idk how we can use holywood man he is not good at anyhting
Lamar has to shrug that off. Can’t have Steelers multiple TOs bullshit happen
At least hold em to a FG
"Bell can catch a pass behind him, and at the same time also doesn't take off down the field towards his own end zone. What a nice thing we should have, can we get one of those??"
Hollywood looking like a pewee freshman football player among those men
" honestly fuck it, let’s just only run the ball. forget passing"
Son of a nutcracker!
👎
Please Roman do something
Can't believe McCarthy didn't try a fake punt there. We never would have seen it coming
how do you have that great of a D-line and can't get pressure on Dallas' 3rd String O-line? jesus this is going to be a long game
Lamar needs to run more. He’d rather throw it now and not take the easy yards like last year
Hmm I had thought we were done with stagnant offices since Joe left. Guess not
Lamar just needs to throw and catch the ball
All i want for Christmas is a new OC. Im sick of romans same fucking 3 plays.
Atleast they’re playing phish at every commercial.
I honestly don’t know why Greg tries to make mark Ingram work when dobbins is clearly better
Can’t believe dez tested positive for COVID during warm ups
"I'm so tired, I'm already wondering how I'm going to make it to the end of the game"
2020 is shitting on the Ravens
"I'm convinced Brown is to the Ravens what OBJ is to the Browns. 

Being forced fed by a QB to avoid drama and resulting in garbage plays making the QB look worse than he actually is."
give duv and proche snaps over hollywood
Hot take: that was a bad pass that’s on Lamar and also a catchable ball that’s on Hollywood.
We give it to a running back other than Ingram and immediately get way passed the los
Who's dick do I have to suck to get dobbins some totes wtf
"Oh weird, running works. Welp, time to throw to Hollywood!"
Did Lamar’s groin ever heal? He’s had that same limp all season
Gus had a nice run better not keep him going - GR probably
Dobbins!!!
#THIS IS WHY YOU PLAY DOBBINS
"It's not even funny when us as viewers can understand and see Gus and Dobbins are the better backs, and to run your hot players until you cant.

Roman doesnt do anything. I truly believe he has no idea what to do outside running concepts"
Dobby is free once again!!!!!
See what happens when you don't run Ingram?
"Look at that, first Dobbins carry for 15

It's not that hard Roman"
"Roman: ok Ingram, you're back in"
Dobbins with a huge run and it's a surprise to NO ONE.
Dobbins is the silver lining
Gus and JK only please
Bruh
"dobbins, the one spark right now"
It is so hard for this team to play mistake-free football nowadays
Just don't fucking throw the ball all game. It's fine
"Dez out for the rest of the year with a case of ""I'm too old for this shit"""
"Roman, we better not see Ingram for the rest of the game. It's clear he's not the same back. Ride Gus and Dobbins."
Jackson was playing with his mouth guard out on that last play.
"...one pick, one fumble. So far so good"
Interception & fumble out of the way. Give JK the ball and we good.
What kinda play call is that? Screen on 2nd and 18???
Why the fuck are we using Hollywood on short routes. He's a deep threat (when he actually wants to be)
"2nd and long and he tosses 3 yards behind to the guy who can't catch.

i cant"
Are you fucking kidding me with that play 18 yards and you throw behind the LOS
GO FOR IT
Go for it
YES LAMAR LETS FUCKING GOIII
Mark ingram should never get another carry. Brown should never get on another team bus. Lamar needs to learn to play under center with these snappers. And Greg Roman needs to be excommunicated from football
YEA BABY
Give it to Ingram... he’ll get the yardage /s
LFG lamar
That's my Llama!!!!
TD. Needed that shit
ITS SIMPPLLLEEEEEEE
Oh my god. The way Aikman said thanksgiving
So let's just run every down lmao
Shades of the Seattle game
Dejavu
WELCOME BACK LAMAR
That's just terrible defense but hey I'll take it
There we go. Lamar doing what he’s best at
Keep this shit uppppp
Thought JT missed that lol
"Welcome back, 8."
Man I was waiting for a flag but thaaannk god no penalties on that run!
"Lamar has scored three 35+ yard TDs on that exact play, and I’m pretty sure all were third and short or fourth and short."
Brown's ego is proportional to his skill...in madden
I LOVE YOU LAMAR DEMEATRICE JACKSON! I KISS YOUR MAMA ON THE CHEEKS
LLAMA
Maybe covid put Lamar through a time machine to 2019 or something
Just like Seattle last year.
Shout-out to the sound guy at Fox for playing us off with Rush
That's my fuckin dude. There you go Lamar. So happy for him.
Where’s everybody complaining at now?
HE’S BAAAACCCCCKKKKKKKKKKKK
Holy crap did that first quarter go fast! 😂
Oh fuck
Jesus fuck we can’t do shit right
"and back to your regularly scheduled programming, the 2020 season"
Fucking wide open
Deshone what the heck
Wow and this was a great ST unit historically and it gave that up.
"Nice try tucker, good form for real"
"Jesus this fucking team man, just impossible to play a consistently good game"
Straight up if we establish the run this game is ours. We can just kill the clock and score. This is 2020 Greg Roman tho
"At this point I just laugh when something goes horribly wrong in a ravens game. It's always something new, just gotta laugh and move on"
Marlon...
OF FUCKING COURSE IT WOULD BE AGAINST US. FUCK YOU
Announcer jinx not surprised
"fake crowd boo's, really?"
Giving Andy Dalton all day to throw has hurt us before
Fuck Andy Dalton can just get away from this bum
"Dog shit, apparently you can’t touch receivers at all"
It’s disgusting
Bad field position for our Def last 2 possessions. Clean that up and Ravens should have this game locked up
"I legit can't understand how the D-line can't get pressure on Dallas. there is so much talent on that D-line, just fucking unbelievable"
WE RAN A SUCCESFUL RPO
Hollywood caught a contested catch? I’m shocked
HOLLYWOOD CAUGHT SOMETHING!!!
GUS BUS
WTF did he really catch one?
"Tbf, Marlon is one of the few players this year who consistently earn their paycheck"
"#RUN RUN RUN

DALLAS SUCKS AGAINST THE RUN"
Gus it up!
GUS THE BUS! beautiful
I watch other teams and get jealous at the separation. If Lamar doesn’t throw the best pass of his career every play it don’t work 😂
We having at least 2 100 yard rushers in this game
The Gus Bus makes no stops!
#DON'T STOP RUNNING THE BALL
I’m scared that management will shed Gus and keep Ingram and Dobbins when we should be moving on from Ingram
**LET GUS COOK**
"""the architect of this offense"" LMAO"
Guys... we’re running the ball. It’s so beautiful to see 🥲
I am excited for some play action TDs
"Play-action for the touchdown, baby. CALLING IT NOW."
bro can we just be a regular team who calls regular plays ?
"Seems like the Cowboys are unblocked in our back field pretty frequently here.  We have had some clutch big-play runs, but a lot of these plays are getting blown up immediately."
What a play call on 3rd and 8
Look down the field
DO NOT JINX US
What the fuck are we doing. Damn. Hahaha
Defense has to step up. If they do we win this game
Wtf
Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you.
Fucking Bradley Bozeman
Holy shit. We’re melting
So it's going to be one of those nights.
Still the goat.
Had to happen on prime time
Fuck Joe Buck
Are you fucking kidding me
What have we done to you football gods
WTF
WTF!
"That was no good?  I can't even tell from the camera angle, I guess I just have to trust the refs on this one, but it looked really close to having gone directly over and above the upright, which would be good if it had."
Joe Buck what're you doing!
Shows how important the entire wolf pack is... aren't we missing one of them?
Are you kidding me. Wow. Unlike Tuck.
FuckinJoe
YOU DUSTY HAIR PLUG CUNT BUCK
entire team is failing today
"Fire Justin

(I AM KIDDING!!!)"
Can't even blame tucker we iced our own kicker LOL
"If someone could murder joe buck ,all sports would benefit."
We suck in all phases the great trifecta
The ultimate jinx is acknowledging that you are jinxing them and still doing it
Wtf is going on?!!! We couldn’t just snap the ball on the first kick?!! We had to try to make them jump offsides and then we fuck it up with a false start. Then we miss the fucking kick on the next try. Jesus Christ this is the worst season and it’s so heart wrenching. It’s like every little thing happens that comes back to bite us in the ass.
Nfl games are predetermined confirmed. Living in a simulation. How come everything bad is happening seconds after someone mentions it lol
Let’s not focus on the “jinx” but the flag.
Honestly if you told in 2017 me that we’d have a mediocre season during a pandemic after two great years I’d take it
"If we lose this game, Roman better get the boot this shit is embarrassing"
"For the Xth time. This team **lacks heart and strength**.

Top down issue starting with our FO. We have been poorly developing players for a decade, and scouting the wrong ones. We dont hold our players or coordinators accountable either"
"Lol is it really Joe Buck's fault though? Like, id blame the O-lineman that essentially iced his own kicker with that false start over some superstitious ""jinx"" by Joe Buck."
"it says a lot about how good Tucker is that we stop watching to get snacks when he's kicking cuz we assume he'll always make it

we still love u JT its ok"
Wooooooooooo
DROTY
YASS QUEEN
CROWN THE QUEEN
QUEEENNNN!!!!!
LETS GO
The Queen's Gambit pays off
JUST WHEN I LOSE HOPE THEY PULL ME RIGHT BACK IN
"God I fucking love Queen, man is my dad"
we needed that hell yeah!!!!!
LFG 😂😂
Boykin redemption game!
"The ball didn't come within 6"" of the ground and Tucker was playing 4D chess.

Like a Sac Fly thats not a hit to his stats."
#TD BOYKIN
YASSSS QUEEN
I can breathe now
**YESSSSS WHAT A CATCH**
Holy shit we fucking did something
#BOYKIN TD..?...!......?
Yo wtf was that a passing touchdown
"Damn, that was a bad throw and an outstanding catch"
Well this took a quick turn that was about to get bad
FUCK YEAH BOYKIN
Fuck yes Boykin
Patrick Queen is my new favorite raven. He’s swag as fuck
WAS THAT SEPARATION?????? WTF
"Bro y'all are a fucking rollercoaster of emotion. Lmao, holy shit."
"Could have been a better ball, but the result is the same! LFG"
Oh shit what just happened??? Boyked!
Yo boykin scoring just to shit on you doom and bloomers fuck you he said
And then Queen does what he does.......stay with it folks!!
GREG “HEART ATTACK” ROMAN STRIKES AGAIN
Damn I guess the miss was worth it lol
OK BOYKIN
That’s a hell of a play and finish
Tucker is off today. Both PATs were off centre and the missed FG.
That would of been DEZ :(
Where’s all you little bitch whiners now? Jesus let the game play out
Boykin breakout game please
2 hands on the ball it’s amazing how that works!!
Wait Tucker missed a FG??
LMAO that defense does not know how to tackle
I CALLED THE PLAY-ACTION TOUCHDOWN.
can we please just beat the shit out of the Cowboys now
YOINK
**Dez Boykin**
Hill and Boykin been earning their snaps on Special Teams. I like that.
[deleted]
BOYKIN!
I want to be excited about that boykin TD but even that looked a little shaky 😂 but i’ll take it
that's my quarterback!!
Dez has covid?????
Boykin is still a #5 WR on a good team. Upgrade the weapons!
We could have trade skura and a nice piece of lettuce for hopkins man
Why can't we get to Dalton?  Their line can't be that good
"Who was in here saying Tucker couldn’t kick a touchback. He can kick them fine, he makes a conscious decision most times to kick it high at the goal line to get (ideally) a short return."
Need some fuckin sacks already damn
ayo what ever happened with earl thomas? felt like an eternity ago?
Why is Lamb always open lol
"Offense scores, defense starts letting them drive down the field..."
Wolfe has been so good in the run game.
"Something needs to change on 3rd and longs, we absolutely suck on them for some reason"
Ravens D won’t play too aggressive this game. They want Dalton to make the mistake not them
Bruh Wolfe has really really stepped it up. Like he's been dominant
What the fuck was Peters doing on that coverage.
d is not legally allowed to make a 3rd down stop
Peters always 10 yards off
"What the fuck is this coverage? Why was Peters so far off? Come on, Wink."
"Peters playing kinda scares so far, find your mojo man"
"where is the pass rush, jesus man"
This sub including myself has no appreciated Wolfe for what he has done.
Yikes that zone was terrible. Fuck zone against Dalton. *4th and 12 flashbacks*
Holy shit the cushion
D is giving too much space
bro a miscommunication like that on defense is unacceptable
Peters playing so fucking soft man
Wtf is going on with the defense
Lol just point at Gallup and don't pick anyone else up. Interesting strategy
If we can't get pass rush today we're never getting it. Cowboys OL is literally Uber drivers and Wendy's janitors.
For all the man coverage skills we have why do we insist on playing 10 yards off at all times
What a shocker. The offense is playing well so the defense obviously doesn't.
How are we not getting any pressure on Dalton against Dallas' banged up line???
Seemed like zone D but our lbs are in man
Lol averett just pointing and watching
Remember that year we had Suggs and Dumervil? Man that was nice actually getting to the QB
"I dunno why the cowboys are trying to run, their receivers are wide ass open every play."
Mcphee deserves judons money
GET A FUCKING STOP
Something about the way Dalton plays football just works against this D. He always throws it so fast
Technically that grounding
Is it just me or does Calais have some serious anterior pelvic tilt?
where's the D from last week? lol
This defense I think says we think we can win this in a war of attrition. I don't disagree. As long as we are willing to adjust when required.
BAHAHA
YAAAAASSSSS
Told ya
#LMAO
This game is bizzare
iced
An eye for an eye
Kickers getting fucked tonight lmao
Is there a serious wind in Bmore or something?
Lol. You can’t make this shit up. Both kickers get a five yard penalty and miss a typically easy kick.
Deion gonna get a charge stealing peoples pizzas
Friendship needed with Hollywood Boykin is my new best friend
Lol wtf
Aikman is bias.
That was insane.  Wow what was their defense thinking!?
Hell yeah that was catchable. The only reason it wasn't a little closer is cuz they held him down.
"Dez was seen on camera hugging cowboys coaches pre-game.

Bro... the entire NFL season is about to mirror the movie ""contagion""... hopefully w/o the deaths."
Our first PI!
First PI drawn of the year
He still hit him early still a penalty
Fuck Troy Aikman
"He grabbed his head regardless, something would've got called"
JK IS THE MAN
Lol Luke Wilson trying to play grown man ball like Andrews at half the size
Dobbins is a top 10 back in the league. He doesn’t start
Dobbins is fast
DOBBY!!!!! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
Lamar its like wilson not Mark hes gonna stop mark runs up the field that's the reason
Why we cant make pitch work
FEED THAT BOI!
We’re on pace for 320 rushing yards 😂😂😂
DOBBINS RB1
DUBBINS!!!
HOW DO WE KEEP GETTING PRE SNAP PENALTIES ON OFFENSE.
damn Hollywood is tiny
Lol illegal formation 😂
What does that penalty even mean? Tf
We get illegal formation at least 2 times a game every week
Shouldn’t that flag blow the play dead instead of giving the defense a free play?
Guys just be glad WR #15 caught it
I mean yeah he made it but shut up about it
Jesus run the ball. It’s working.
I swear we have so many speedsters but never run sweeps. Lamar obviously cant make pitch work we keep trying
Lack of practice showing thru tonight
I do not understand what the fuck an illegal formation is. I can't believe I didn't get the call to come play last week when we couldn't field a full roster. I'm literally perfect for this team
"I really hate that they keep trying to make that play work where they basically cut the field in half.  It really struggles, it forces Lamar to throw into tight windows (not his specialty) and it makes it impossible for Lamar to take off."
We take way too many procedural penalties
"We need more levels in our routes. Just have one guy run a slant and another run a deep dig, Lamar is good at intermediate routes over the middle."
"At least one illegal formation penalty every fucking game.

Could probably count the amount of times I've heard that call against us in my life on one hand before this season."
He’s a god again
Yep. Can’t score in the RedZone. Bottom half in the league for TD percentage in the RedZone.
Seattle Sounders? Do they put things in their urethra?
Peters leg is hurt.
"Will we ever sack Dalton? Seriously! If we can’t sack against this line, Baker going to throw all over us next week."
"This says the ravens only have 4 illegal formation penalties this season, which leads the league but cannot possibly be correct

https://www.nflpenalties.com/penalty/illegal-formation?year=2020&view=team"
Really thought I'd be seeing more pressure on Dalton this game.
We’re going to let them get in fg range
We literally can’t get any pressure on the quarterback no matter how many guys we send on a 3rd string oline... smh
Who else saw a d lineman jsut get tackled and no penalty. That’s was us last night basically
"Whoever their rt is, is bullying whoever we have rushing on that side."
yea that looked like a flag on us but i'm not complaining
We got away with that one
We got away with one there.
Damn we kinda got away with that
Bowser has the snap count timed. He slipped there but bro he bgg is playing great
lol refs.
We got lucky there lol
There were about 4 penalties on that play. Refs said fuckit
We deserve a non call or 2.  Thanks refs.
"Feeling like the Steelers getting away with a call like that... 

Don't like it."
"Definitely should’ve been at least holding or illegal contact, but not PI"
nice
Damn that's an awesome throw
That's the opposite of the Jets
Jesus fuck that should have been caught
The fact they almost pulled that off is ridiculous!
Why not go for some pressure and try and get Tucker a long FG?
I’m glad we don’t have Adam Gase
Playing it pretty soft? We didnt rush a single player.
Wow we got lucky there
Eh if the Defense gets a good amount practice for the game they will be alright
"Yeah those replays of the hail mary look absurd, not one single Ravens player looks like they brought their hands above their helmet."
On the bright side. 1 penalty all game
"I feel like CeeDee could have easily ran through that, pretty light contact and CeeDee instead flopped for the call, he is a strong dude"
I honestly wish someone would show games with no announcers. I'd pay for that.
"\#Ravens WR snaps in H1 (unofficial, 27 total snaps):

* Boykin - 25
* Brown - 24
* Duvernay - 24
* Proche - 2

(Boykin seeing a lot of snaps with Dez out) #RavensFlock - @Yoshi2052)"
damn yeah that was pretty nuts Deshon didn't get flagged
Good on Duv going down rather than losing the ball.
Awuzie refuses to be blocked by bigger players lol
Duvernay was SO close to breaking that
Wow
Wow
That was ugly.
Boykin was open
What the hell happened to his footwork and throwing mechanics?
"160 rush yards in the first half so immediately abandon it.
Why are so afraid to be who we are? I found life became much more enjoyable when I embraced the fact I was a dick."
Still no sacks
Tired of these fucking holds being allowed.
How the fuck it was not holding on Ngakoue?
These dudes really cant get pressure on this depleted ass line?
Not one single piece of this team has improved as the year progressed. I realize COVID and all sorts of other factors but that’s astonishing. This team is much worse than it was in week 1.
Yannick is invisible
Zeke been struggling? Just play the ravens. Cowboys oline struggling play the ravens pass rush they will be gods. Why is it when a team has struggles on things when they play us they disappear
Team looks so fucking flat.
Look at all the time Dalton has in the pocket.
D is getting cooked
"Damn we got lucky, cooper was open"
"Our defense plays with the mentality of, “i hope they make a mistake” instead of forcing them"
Can somebody wipe that blood off the tip of Andy Dalton’s nose maybe?
The reffing has been decidedly bad. I will give them no holds cause they haven't called any either way.
hahaha he missed again
"Got lucky there. MP and Humphrey look absolutely lost. Haven’t seen averett much, idk if that’s a good thing or if he’s just not getting snaps."
Oooooooh that feels so goooood
Running the ball every play wins us the game but figuring out something consistent in the passing game gives us a shot to compete with Browns/Giants
Those are some terrible dog owners
M&T out here ruining careers.
Desperation bowl? wtf
Come on offense. I want an 8 minute drive capped with a TD. Pound that rock!
I got excited for Dobbins being in on that 2nd down play.... then Lamar pulls the ball back and keeps it to get 2 yards.  Damn.  But the 3rd down run was nice!
That's a 1st
Fuck yeah Lamar
Pls run with JK
Dobbins > Ingram all day
JK all day
Dobbins may be as fast or faster then Lamar. No reason he shouldn't be the first look at RB.
Dobbins rules
I don’t see why Roman doesn’t see that Dobbins and Edwards are getting chunk yardage while Ingram is getting next to nothing and still decides to put him in. I love Ingram as much as the next guy here cause I love the energy he brings but Jfc we need to stick to 1 or 2 and let them cook
isnt it wild that first down handoffs go for 2 yards max with ingram but you do the exact same play with dobbins or gus and they work for 5+... almost like there's something to learn there... just maybe...
"Ingram should run in the 4th quarter is Dobbins and Gus are gassed, otherwise let him do his personality thing from the sideline and talk him into staying as a rb coach"
Let's just bleed clock and at least make it a two-score game. Please.
3 carries in a row for dobbins in the second half! Are we sure Roman is still calling the plays? 😹
Dobbins is averaging 8-9yrds. KEEP FEEDING HIM ROMAM
9 of 12 for 76 yards is bad
Hey guys this running game is having some good traction...I think it’s time we throw three downs in a row
Seriously Lamar.
His mechanics suck
Lamar come on dawg
GRo must’ve read this subreddit now that JK is in
So fucking bad
Run. the. ball.
Fucking Greg Roman /s
"I really, really like Dobbins."
Boykin looked open for the first down there.
Come on he was wide open...
God cut Justice Hill!!
Why tf is dobbins getting subbed out this is bullshit
Damnit Hollywood. But that wasnt a good pass
Why in the fuck is Hill in there
This guy cant throw man what the fuck is going on lately
"I figured it out: Ingram has had enough of this football bullshit, they had their 4th child a year ago, he just wants to enjoy life not worrying about injuries and whatnot. So he channelled all his energy into his padawan JK Dobbins"
"ah yes

shit throw into false start

love it"
Lamar really carrying Romans shitty scheme
"I rarely get to watch games living in TX, and I want this season to be over with"
"Lamar run good. Lamar pass bad.

Edit: I rescind my statement."
Lamars run game is n point. Passing not so much but hes running efficiently
Thank Christ for Lamar's legs
why is justice hill in the game
SOULJAAAAAA
#SOULJA PLAY
SOULJA SIGHTING
What a fuckin throw
Oh look play action working again.
THERE we go
SOULJA
Good block dobby
HOLLYWOOOOOOD!
FUCK YEAH!
SOULJA!!!!!!
SOULJA BOY
What a throw!!!!
We need to sell our soul for a WR next season .. Not a toy or gadget on but like a proper 6'2 - 6'3 WR that can go up and. get the ball
SOULJA
"Hollywood making catches tn, thank god"
Damn what a THROW
"Ok hollywood, now do that more than once every few games?"
What a fucking throw JFC
SOULJA BOI TELL UM!!!
Holly-WHOOPED. Friccin morons...
That was pretty as hell. Happy for Marquise there
fuckin dime
Wtf was that graphic lmao. They made him look light skin.
Souljah
THROW IT ON A DIME
SOULJA TIME
TrAc3?!?!?! /s
Enjoy that Gatorade Hollywood
What a fucking dime holy shit
this quarter has lasted so long
It's great to see Brown Making a great catch after running a perfect route. There's the potential of this offense right there
Now if only we could get consistency from them both we would be cooking
"Good adjustment by Brown to cut up field, beautiful pass by Lamar on the run"
This is what happens when lamar takes off and makes them worry about the ground game we open up receivers
"Hmmmm I am smelling something, smells like a FUMBLE"
Ferguson is a big fucking dude
How is he that wide open
So much for having an elite secondary. They look clueless
Wolf’s been showing up
Clear grounding
A good pass rush.... that’s new
Our defense can’t hold them to a three and out for shit.
Run stop has been pretty good. Pass rush and coverage has been awful
"Just gotta start tackling their guys,  duh."
Get ready for the big turnover....I feel it
The biggest surprise outside of the Dez news is our WRs catching TDs
Fort just gave me the stank face what a play covered up the tight end played the run and broke up the pass in ONE PLAY.
"“That should have been picked”

You all armchair QBs work for Circque du Soleil and at home because of Covid??"
first tube
Sack!
hey we got a sack
Where is the Fort love. He just covered a TE  played the run and then recovered and broke up the pass wtf that's one of the best LB plays ever
#yesss we finally got a sack
Oh my fuck it actually worked for once.
WE CAN GET SACKS??
Yannick be getting pushed to the outside every time
Cowboys kicker is ass lol
Great time for our first sack to force a long field goal!
Thank you D finally!
That wind is insane!!
Our pass rush is way worse without judon hope all the judon haters can see his value
Haha what the hell happened to Greg the Leg
Someone is seriously in Zuerlein’s head
LMFAO HE MISSED AGAIN
Damn rough day for their kicker
Joe buck is paying the price for the jinx earlier
14 pt game with 14:14 left in the 4th
GREG YOU FIRED
We don't need sacks or defense when we have greg Zurelein
RICARD JUST LAID THAT POOR DUDE OUT
Lmao let's go Pat
Well now we know Ricard is good
# PRO BOWLER PAT RICARD
Got to like Ricard's return to the field. Very much in his style.
In all seriousness it's been pretty windy in the Baltimore area the past few days. It's a tough ask for anyone to make a kick.
My man bounced off project pat
Choo Choo motherfuckers
"Holy shit I feel bad for Zuerlein, I remember him, JT, and Blair Walsh were the next big thing at kicker when they were rookies"
#FOOT MEET THROAT
How much do you guys think Ricard squats lol
Gus was such a great find
Gus looking explosive today
Pat Ricard legit our most sure handed receiver
Shades of last season this drive
Can anyone remind the score when they played Pitt?
"this is the most lively i've seen lamar in a few weeks, i love it"
5 rushes for 70 yards- Gus is eating like usual
Just run up the middle
"Glad we got the first, but looked like Dobbins had room to run after the catch"
So nice to see Lamar having fun out there again
For once Dobbins made the wrong read on that one.
Nice run by Ingram. Finally.
"lamar is stupid good at that shit

it's insane"
Let’s punch it in with Dobbins!
Didn't set his feet
In Tucker We Trust
Digging the Chalk Dust⭕️⭕️⭕️⭕️
Troy Aikman jinx cost the cowboys 9 points from field goals
Please just be a covid rust...
If nothing else hopefully this game gets Lamar's confidence back up so when he has his favorite targets back he's more on point. Dude actually looks like he's having fun out there for the first time since week 5
Why is our coverage such shit tonight? Is Wink having a worse game than Roman?
Finish this drive and safe to call it a night?
All year we’ve been giving up first down after first down with soft coverage
This secondary is getting exposed without Jimmy Smith.
"Fuck, not Humphrey!"
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO MARLOOOOO
How is that not a hold
Humph. No.
not humphrey please
How was that a first down lol am I just biased
Of course a terrible spot leads to marlon getting hurt on the next play. Holy shit
"I’m purely speculating, but Marlon wasn’t grabbing anything and also didn’t look like he was in that much pain when he was on the ground. Hopefully he just got shaken up on that play"
It's just really hard to play corner when the guy can shove you at the top of his route without any fear of a penalty but if you in any way try to counter it you're probably getting a flag on you.
Hensley says he looks fine
How is a multi billion dollar league still using a guy running 20+ yards a legit way to measure?
How the hell is this defense ranked 8
Yea keep Humphrey out the rest of the way fuck this game. Onto Cleveland
"At this point I just want this game to end.

It's been 2.5 hours of dumb Roman play calls and soft ass defense."
Those lips on Cams drawing looked so fucking exaggerated and racist lmao... Who the fuck thought that looked good?
Averett just getting picked on
Tackling maybe should be a point of emphasis
Bowser gotta make that tackle
Damn they literally clotheslined Fort
Challenge
Yannick finish the play for once lol
Ngakoue is coming so close every time lmao
That's a pick.....
Fort had it
That was an interception to this is bs
"That was an int, and not PI"
Wow that was a pick
Lmao never a PI but not an INT
FUCK YOU REFS
If Dallas scores hopefully you guys keep getting some first downs and finish strong.
"Damn, these stops on the goal line are nuts"
Run D??? 👀
Fuck yea this red zone D is SOLID
Yo I can’t believe how hard we held Zeke like this that’s fucking bullying
Really good catch
Peters lost again 🤦‍♂️
This and the Pats game considering the competition is the worse D I seen all year. The Chiefs are the chiefs so that’s whatever
MP got burnt
MP was on skates
For fucks sake
"Peter’s is not a good cover corner he’s a ball hawk, this happens every week"
phish count . at least 3
Marcus Peters wtf
As we are right now we are not a playoff team. Shits sad.
Lmao how did they think it’s not even 10 yards
Why are they even fucking talking about this lol
Why is this even a debatable call
This is not a question.....
Guys believe it or not the games aren’t always going to be as easy as they were last year. We have a 10 point lead with under 4 minutes left. I’ll take that every week even if it’s ugly.
I don't think the refs would rule it a pick anyways
Lol LJ Fort picked that off. Oh well
STOP RUNNING BACKWARDS PLS
MFW Lamar's fake handoff fools the fox camera operator
At some point they need to call personal fouls for jumping on Proche after he was down... just seems dangerous to let them pile on him after a clear recovery.
"Did we really need slow motion shots of proche clearly holding the ball, being slowly tackled, sitting there, and then slowly beginning to get up to know that the Cowboys were full of shit?"
Baker looks like a rat
"Why are you getting fancy, run up the middle and get that 1st down to end this game"
"Cool juke for no gain, like that meme from yesterday LOL"
Thank the lord
Fucking Gus Bus man that man is a different breed
#GUS BUS
Edwards is ridiculous
There's no reason Gus Edwards shouldn't get 50% of the 2nd half carries
"Feels good to beat Andy Dalton.

Fuck him."
Gus Edwards is unreal
I like Ingram coming off the bench. Less pressure and he can come in fresh against lineman that are getting worn out.
That Marlon Humphrey cackle...
i love gus edwards.
The BUS is rolling!
I’ll eat crow here - when I saw Ingram on the field for the 3rd down I thought it would kill the drive. GJ!
I would’ve preferred if that was Gus but JK FUCKING DOBBINS
JK DOBBINS
EZ MONEY
DOBBY!!!
Dobbins is a fucking monster!
Talk your shit OBJ
LETS GO LETS FUCKING GO
Scoring a TD would ice this. Let’s Go Ravens!
JK all Day
EZ money
6 rush yards shy of 300. Damn
GG EZ COWBOYS
Hell Yeah!!!!!!!
The rushing box score is going to be absurd
"The cowboys need to buy an entirely new defense. 

Yikes. They're awful"
We played pretty decent today defense got some things to work on though if we’re gonna beat the browns
Looked like Humphrey just gave up there.
GOLDBERG GOLDBERG
Lmao bro what the fuck
Pick 6 or bust
"The AFC is much tougher than the NFC this year. Ravens, KC, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Miami, Cleveland and even the Titans are tough."
um can we not do hugs
Elliot a straight thumper
How are we gonna protect averett next week?
How about Harbaugh stops playing 4D fucking chess and just kick the ball out of the end zone every time
Lamar hasn’t looked great...
Yikes. lamar cannot throw anything over 10 yards tonight.
"Seriously... boykin might have scored a TD on that play if the ball was accurate.

Lamar's mechanics need fixing."
The Cowboys are awful we not winning against Cleveland playing like this
Boykin was wide open and the throw was atrocious again
"Once again the half-field play.  

Lamar is so furstratingly inconsistent."
"Shoutout to the run game, but our passing offense is a complete disaster. The pass plays look like shit I used to draw up with other kids on the playground"
We got this. Covid was a revival for this team. Let’s make this push!
We’re fucking cursed
"Welp, looks like it ain't gonna work out for Dez  🤷"
Dream of a blue wave ends in GA? Lol wtf
These passing concepts are trash man.
Did dobbins fuck GRs wife or something
"Just to remind everyone: there's absolutely NO REASON for us to lose to the 3-8 dumpster fire Cowboys. NONE. I don't wanna see a single ""we can still do it"" post/comment here."
Good that interception almost made my head explode. Wtf was the playcall. The pass decision by lamar. The piss poor attempt by madden legend Hollywood.
We need to get rid of 15. Asapppppppp
"Hey Dez, chill"
WHY IS SKURA AT CENTER?!?!?!?
Don’t be surprised if roman abandons the run
If he dropped that TD then that would be a pitiful PI call
Man Marlo has been struggling since Covid.
Well thats a fucking announcer jinx if I’ve ever seen one
"Ah yes a short pass to Justice Hill, surely will work."
FUCK OFF AND GO TO HELL JOE BUCK
"Fuck you troy, and fuck you Buck"
Everybody in here has to calm down a bit lol
"Is it opposite day? Queen int, boykin big td? What next"
"Defense: Elite  
Offense: Struggling  
Baltimore: Ravens"
lmao fuck you Troy and Buck. karma.
Joe buck too busy riding Troy’s cowboy cock
The refs are against us!!! /s
Refs giving us an actual break for oncd
Banned of r/nfl for 3 days yeehaw so here i be
"The defense hasn’t looked great at all tonight. Granted, the points came on short fields as a result of Hollywood and special teams, but they’re pretty much able to do what they want. They got bailed out by the no call at the end of the half, too.

Ravens should be running away with this thing given their rushing attack vs. the Cowboys defense, but alas, it’s the 2020 Ravens, so, here we are. Expecting a pass heavy second half cause Greg gonna Greg."
Imagine if they spent this much time talking about the no calls Pitt always gets
"&#x200B;

Now, Lamar has Mechanical Issues?"
Lamar’s mechanics have regressed. Idk what his off-season coach did to him ....
Guy wins the MVP and all of a sudden doesn't need to work with his throwing coach this summer only AB and the soulja
"I feel like Lamar lost some of the chip on his shoulder, don't remember the lazy passes like that last year"
Alright zeke give us one of those fumbles you've coughed up all year
"Designed Lamar plays are complete wastes of time 99% of the time. Lamar is a quarterback, fucking throw."
Aikman is a piece of shit. Glad we don’t play on FOX much
Yet another pass rusher tackled by their O-line with no flag.
That's Gorunding
Why does our defence always suck ass in the 4th quarter
You can't miss these throws against good teams. This defense is abysmal.
That play never works!!!
"Okay... 

Lamar hasn't played his best football today but man... he's missing short range passes which is very unlike him. Some of this might be rust.

Just trying to be fair."
"Like a guy below said, yea Lamar missed thr throw, but most other QBs are getting sacked on that play. Be appreciative lmao."
How did John not challenge that??
Peters sucks most of the time wtf is wrong with him
"If LAMAR does that throw then  it’s Muh Lamar bad .

But since it’s Dalton people don’t talk about it"
"Fuckin pick play, holding on the O line. Clear as fuckin day. Jesus refs what the FUCk"
"Hate to be a downer, but that's a good example of Lamar needing to work on his touch. Boykin was wide open and the ball was a jumper. Almost gave the defense a chance to catch up."
"I'm not going to pretend like Brown literally didn't just miss the ball with his hands and got lucky it hit his forearms.

He ran a nice route, but Christ clean the catches up if you want to talk big shit."
"Y'all bitch just as much up 10 as you do when we're down 20, goddamn"
"Roman is a talent vampire, he sucked all the talent out of our offense and lamar and this is what we have left"
Y'all switch up so fast lmao
We’re just a bad football team.
I'm convinced there is not a more bipolar group of fans on this site than this one right here
Peters man you gotta make that play or dont do it at all 😂😂😂
Another shitty throw
"It’s insane how inconsistent Lamar is.. Like what in the fuck was that throw to Boykin, but the throw to Hollywood was amazing."
Bad throw but can we talk abt the playcall? Lamar had to make something out of nothing
"Not to be a nagging female, but we need to get better at wearing masks on the sideline. And masks that go over the nose"
Uhhhh... Is the game cancelled?
"I'm bummed for Dez. I'm sure he really wanted this game. And to get pulled at such a late hour for such an awful reason. I wish him the best, as I do for everyone who gets COVID (yes even Steelers). And what's worse is it's still running around within the organization.  I hope all these young guys don't have lingering effects."
"Fuck the cowboys, fuck covid, fuck joe buck, an fuck the Steelers"
And now roman puts in fucking justice hill...fireable offense in itself
"Hollywood doesn't get to bitch anymore. Last week he wouldn't lay out for the pass that he could have caught. 

Tonight he can't even bring his other hand up."
Bench Brown. Seriously.
Fuck roman with a cactus in his ass. Fucking garbage ass coordinator
Ravens offense seems to have reverted back to Flacco/Morninwheg days
Wow clear hold
Ugh. Tucker my boy. What have they done to you
We’re just so cursed. It all started when Earl tweeted before the Titans game last year.
Hollywood is lucky we dont have enough guys to field a team. He could use a week in the cooler to get his head right.
We don't get pressure
HOWW IS THAT ON MARLON
How was that DPI? Lmao
"We don't care anymore, both onfield and in the boardroom. We give away a dumbass easy TD like that and all our players do is go ""oh no"" and walk off. No passion.

And our board CLEARLY doesn't give two shits since GREG ROMAN IS STILL EMPLOYED"
Humphrey didn't even jump
Oh wow a checkdown on 3rd and 8 nice call roman
"He legit only looked at 1 read, fuck man"
roman about to get cute and stop running. how many fucking times has this happened?
Gonna be one of those games.
Bruh fuck Joe Buck lmao
DAMN IT BUCK WHAT HELL WHY DID YOU EVEN BRING IT UP
Y'all are crazy with the jinx nonsense
We still don’t look good. This is what we should be doing against a bad team. But much better than this. Let’s hope it’s just a little rust!
3 timeouts + 2 minute warning. Run the fucking ball
At least TRY to get 2 feet in what the hell
This is our chance to fire Greg Roman before he ruins any playoff run/chemistry that we have.
That is big time pass interference. And something that people who are just looking at penalties against/ penalties for are missing: penalties not called.
"TJ jacked up hollywood way harder last week in the exact same situation, and also was a no call. Also ball needs to be catchable and it was 20 yards over their heads"
Stupid imo to only send one guy. This ain’t Madden lmao.
Not a single raven put their hands up on that hail Mary lol
Troy and Joe are terrible to listen to. I hope our guys shut them up and send them home mad.
RUN THE GOD DAMN FUCKING BALL WTF IS THIS.
"Man Lamar passes are so loose and easy 

Need to fix that"
Can we please take this offseason to do whatever they did after 2018 to fix his throw mechanics again? He's doing the sidearm shit so often when it isn't needed now.
"Almost like it's predictable that we'd get a three and out, like I got -11 downvotes about.

Roman calling shit plays and Lamar overthrowing aren't the issue though because we have 161 rushing yards against a 4-8 team"
"Has Lamar regressed or is it just that the receivers suck? 76 yards, we’re in the 3rd quarter"
Like what happened with Ingram since last season? Was it just Yonda making him more productive?
Ok we need more of that from Soulja and Lamar
I just don’t know how he will make those ridiculous rolling left back shoulder throws but miss a 10 yard slant by 5yds. The inconsistency is just mind blowing.
#R/nfl in shambles after that throw
"Just realized no matter how annoying Buck and Aikman may be, I'll take any announcer over Collinsworth."
"If dallas had made those three field goals, this is a one score game. Defense has been playing worse than the scoreboard shows"
"harbaugh should have whipped that flag out and yeeted it immediately 

shit wins the game"
"That's fucking horse shit that they even had the opportunity to score that. Interception taken off the board.

Why the fuck do we get fucked by refs every single goddam week?"
Zebras can eat my salty nuts
EASY MONEY GREG ROMAN CANT YOU SEE THAT
That play just now gave me PTSD
God dammit Dalton why’d you have to 4th and long us again with 50 seconds left
"These completions won't matter, but it is important to notice that Averett is a completly liability and got burned by their whole WR corps"
cut yannick and Ingram for a WR1
"Honestly if brown is already this much ofa diva with what looks like a fraction of the talent of his cousin, it's spelling bad news for him"
That pick was a bad throw
it is 3-0. BLOW UP THE TEAM AND DRAFT A WHOLE NEW ONE!!!! THE GAME IS OVER!!!!!
Queue the grown ass men screaming and blaming the announcers for that lmao. Never gets old
Somebody please draw Patrick Queen as Killer Queen from Jojo
Please see that top down replay by FOX to see how the floating arc pass by Lamar was actually a dime to not get an INT
Lamar’s mechanics coming out of college were inconsistent. He’s not there yet but the LACK of a real off-season did him no favors at all. He will be fine.
THROW IT ON A DIME TIME????????????????
Gonna regret the Peters contract in a year or two. He’s been really bad since the extension.
Can't wait
Let’s go
LET’S FUCKING GO RAVENS
take my energy lamar
Fucking bullshit
the comments on the live pregame show on YouTube are an absolute shit show lol 🍿🍿
Jerry snuck a positive test in so Dez wouldn’t Womp dat ass!
Who tf is Cousin Sal?
">All other #Ravens players tested negative for COVID-19 and no high-risk close contacts were identified, source said. So, no Dez Bryant, but game on as scheduled and no other players impacted. - @TomPelissero"
Does anyone else have to be pulled because of contact tracing?
#BELEE DAT
We finally won a coin toss. Let’s go!
Lamar looks rdy dude
">Dez Bryant’s daily PCR test taken this morning came back tonight and was inconclusive, per source. The test was rerun and that also was inconclusive. He was pulled off the field for a POC test, which was positive for COVID-19. That’s why he’s out against the #Cowboys. - @TomPelissero

>Unlike many teams, the #Ravens are so close to the lab they get their test results back the same day, rather than overnight. With an 8:05 p.m. Eastern kickoff, the rerun and retest process played out while Dez was at the stadium before he was pulled off the field. - @TomPelissero"
"On the bright side, our whole team has already had COVID so they probably couldn’t have caught it from Dez."
Is Williams and Campbell back
We won the toss and defer? Might as well just give us the win and save potentially larger covid outbreak since it's an automatic win for us.
I hope we smash the Cowboys tonight
That's what you call an Elliott-on-Elliott tackle.
This is such bullshit. Player safety My Ass
"Off tackle runs for 6-9 and the Ravens D, name a better duo."
"First game I’ll be able to watch since the Colts game a few weeks ago, and Dez gets the rona. It’s always something lol but let’s get the w"
Questionable
can we get a stop one time tho
Not the call I would've called?
Fortified!
Fuck yeah
Alright folks. Drama behind us. Let's see some damned Ravens football.
Lol.  Zek should have just dropped it
lol
Let’s go llama
thank god Lamar is back
Wish I had a stream that doesn't stop after one play
Let’s go roman dial up the pass pass pass for me
Get Ingram off the field. No More
Ingram and 2 yards name a better duo
why is ingram the starting back
😉
llama baby
WE WANT DOBBINS
Really glad we're running with the hot hand--Ingram...
Where is dobbins
Why is Ingram out there
Get ingram out bring dobbins in ffs
"31st in passing

yikes"
"Ingram I love you, but why are you still starting"
Nice job Marquise losing two yards for no reason
Steve Smith Sr roasted the hell outta Roman it was GLORIOUS
WHERE THE FUCK IS DOBBINS? INGRAM IS SUCH A WASTE
nice backwards run
Let’s give dobbins 1 carry for 5 yards and take him out the game
Fuck
Sigh. Whatever
"Even if he caught that, it had no chance at a first down. Wtf"
Jesus christ
Lol
Ass
Oh boy here we go again
Unfucking believable.
great
Use two fucking hands what the fuck
This team man. What in the fuck
smh
Yup
"ffs, don't know why I had high expectations coming into this"
"It feels like our tips Always get picked. Steelers can have 7 with 0, but Raven tips always get intercepted"
That's a really fucking good pass for most recievers fuck
"Same old, same old...."
Dallas fan here rooting for you guys to win (I want a top 3 pick in the draft)
here we go with these playcalls again
"Were playing against the worst run defense in football
Why would you pass"
Roman bout to make the Cowboys D look elite af. Im sick of these fucking drives.
Look at this hollywood hops....ffs
Thanks soulja
Goddammit
McPhee has looked good so far today.
Brown sucks ass
Jfc queen needs to get better
About to get embarrassed tonight.
Come the fuck on Brown. You're a professional receiver. Use two hands
Why is 33 on Gallup
Well at least our defense is still good
"The pick was a bad throw, but just because it was a bad throw, does not mean the throw was interception worthy. But unlucky but it just ended up in 3 points. Need the offense to start clicking ASAP"
GO FIGHTIN' COVID CORVIDS!
Another’s levels concept by Greg Roman
We gotta limit the Florida men on this team
can we try Duvernay or Proche more on the offense? just get Brown out please
"Don’t put dobbins in, we didn’t want to win anyway. Keep playing Ingram"
#Gus still a bus
Just accept that if we lose this game we don’t deserve the playoffs. Makes this much more interesting.
"It's actually incredible how many players on this team who were good last year, are anywhere from mediocre to terrible this year."
As an outsider why do you hate Ingram so bad?
#BUS BEDWARDS
Gus Edwards nearly got as many yards on that run as he did all of last week.
What the fuck did Dez think was gonna happen in a pandemic?
All gus Edwards does is run right up the middle and get 8 yards every time. Keep him in
Hell of a fucking run let’s gooo
DOBBINS
Keep Dobbins in roman!!
#DOBBINS ALL DAY
Feed Dobbins the rock.
Why tf did Ingram get snaps. Gj jk
"Alright, Dobbins can't block for shit, but on running downs he's the cat's meow."
Imagine that. Dobbins getting a big run
"Wow, same exacy time of run to Dobbins and he gets 13 yards. Stop starting Ingram please"
We need a steady diet of Dobbins runs and Lamar runs.
Nah that guy sucks back to the bench
Time for Ingram to get 5 more carries
Who look Dobbins plays and we start moving down the field who woulda thought
"I love Ingram, but Gus and Dobbins need to be 1-2 for the rest of the season."
We give it to Gus and JK and we immediately do well running. STOP GIVING IT TO INGRAM
JK has the explosiveness that Ingram does not
Well would ya look at that...it’s almost like Dobby is super talented
Triggered
Who the fuck is snapping
FOR FUCK SAKE WITH FUCKING SNAPS
"Ingram --->
Gus Bus -------->
Dobbins ---------------->

Which one do you think gets the most carries today?"
FEEED THIS MAN!!!!
Where have intermediate passes gone
Can't wait for the two more snaps to Gus and Dobbins before 3min left in the 4th down 10pts
What even is that play?
Dobbins in one run got more yards than Ingram will all game
HE DIDN'T DROP IT
Brown is just nothing special. He’s a guy. He’d be a good third stringer on a team with a decent offense.
We should use that Dobbins kid more.
Let Dobbins be great. More snaps
Go for it
We got this
Lamar said NO
"Go for it, give it to Gus.


Edit:  Or that."
[deleted]
Why does Hollywood stand 2yds in front of the line of scrimmage when we need 10+ yds lmao
"Oh fuck yeah

I like this"
I’ll take it.
Lolez
TOUCHDOWN LLAMA
LAMAR I LOVE YOU
LAMAR IS BACKKKKK
THERE HE IS
THAT BOI GONE
That'll do.
Holy shit yes!!!!
Did we run that same exact play on 4th and 2 vs the R Words this year? Think it was the same exact spot too lol
THAT’S MY QB!
I think the stream of the game on twitch is faster than regular cable.
LAMAAAAAAAAA
Lamar!!!! Welcome back!
1921 dom perignon Lamar
My heart nearly dropped on the PA. I haven't felt that in a long time
Aint mad at dez. I wouldnt want to take multiple covid test every week either.
thank you 😌
How is it that myself and probably many others KNEW it was going to be a fake handoff that Lamar keeps and runs with and NOBODY covered him?
"Watching on Prime I saw the TD and went to this feed just to see negative comments because of the bad snap, Hollywood getting bullied out of bounds on the screen & Luke WIllson praise for actually catching it lmfao."
Can someone find a link to that TD? I'm studying for a final exam and can't be in front of a TV
If we establish a run that they can’t stop play action is gonna open up so much
The best running team in the league playing the worst run defense and Roman is thinking too hard
Hell yeah coach let’s go for it!
"It's was so obviously what was going to happen on that fourth down play. You had to know Lamar was going to keep it, right Dallas?"
The veer is the best run we have
Anyone else want to draft Penei Sewell in the worst way? I’d legit move up for him
Wtf
DAMN IT SPECIAL TEAMS
Harbaugh is a former special teams coach
What the fuck was that....
Jesus man
Why are we shooting ourselves this year I don't get it
Jfc can we do something good without 20 bad things happening? Fuck man!
Typical Ravens football. Keep it close. Ugh.
"Tranquillo motherfuckers, they haven't done anything but get a nice runback"
I hate my favorite team
Coaching & fundamentals. Aka what we been lacking since October.
We should be better in second half hopefully
Wtf was that
We are making the fucking cowboys look good. Fuck
How are we pretty much one on one and getting no qb pressure
Where is the pressure? I better not see yall blaming Humphrey for covering a dude for 7 seconds and then letting him get open lmfao
How do we lock down Pitt and struggle here?
We haven’t been able to practice in two weeks right?
Well that sucks only 4 plays and the answer back
Let’s get another one LJ
"Welp, so far this game looks like the past few weeks, let's hope something changes"
I feel like Ferg misses a lot of tackles.
Offense gonna stunt defensive is looking porous.
Give me Dobbins.
"*offense shows flashes of 2019 offense*

Defense: “Let’s go ahead and take a break!”"
"Oh good, this game has been deemed the desperation bowl, exactly what I wanted 2020 to be for a team that broke records last season"
"So far they've scored on a tipped ball and a ST fuck up. Nothing entirely alarming, let's cool our jets fam."
Soulja redemption
#WACK
Souljia catches it when it's dropped in his chest. Nice. Big bucks material.
That was approaching gritty for Marquise
"If you need a distraction from the game, https://www.pff.com/draft/nfl-mock-draft-simulator. Put us at 18 just out of the playoffs and keep trying til we finally get our prized #1 receiver."
"wow Hollywood is actually catching tonight, nice"
"Lead the ball man, he had nothing but grass infront of him"
Hell yeah nice run
That juke by Gus
Gus Bus! All aboard!
GUS BUS
GUS EDWARDS!!!! Huge run!!!
All aboard!!
Yes!  More run game!  Run game was literally what drove our offense last year.  THIS is what we need to be doing!
only reason Dallas is winning this game is because of our stupid mistakes. I’m so turned of this shit.
let's get dobbins and gus some carries
It’s great seeing you guys shit on Marlon and Queen when they have a bad play while simultaneously praising the offense anytime they look remotely competent after weeks of being bad
DID Y'ALL SEE GUS MAKE THAT GUY MISS?
GUS WITH THE JUKE
That juke lol
Gus Bus all day every day
YES GUS
GUS & DOBBINS LET'S GO!
Punish these mfs man!!!
Feed JK and Gus
#BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKERS
Is this going to be one of those 72-68 highschool scores?
Run. The. Ball. All. Night
"Ingram would’ve been tackled for a loss by Jaylon there

Gus gets a huge gain"
Every play should be a run
fucking get ingram out why
"You would think we wouldn't stop running

Greg Roman has other ideas"
hell yes. Run it down their throats.
there's no way we just called that on 3rd down
Where’s the goddamn play action
I like Justice Hill. I thought he was much older than he was until I picked up Madden this year lol
Surely a play designed to get past the line!!! Dude really is whack
Tf didn't he snap the ball?
Holy moly
"We've been gettin really close to some delay of games. Same last week, why don't we try some early in the play clock snaps and set up hard counts"
Damn announcers jinx
:O
FUCK
Why does justice hill get snaps seriously
Lmao
Lol
Murphy's law
What the actual fuck
wow
Pure comedy!
Fuck bozeman
"How does that even hook, the wind was going right and the ball was strait up and down"
Can’t wait for jamarr chase or devonta smith
WTF IS GOING ON!?????
Literally jinxed it lmao
P A I N
Joe..................................................just shut the fuck up.
Fuck you Joe
That looked good to me...
It happened
This is literally painful to watch...SAD
I’m in shock.
I am displeased
😆no such thing as a jinx just got in Tucks head
Pain.
same shit as the saints game smh
Petition to fire Joe buck
[me rn](https://imgur.com/gallery/jLCVPkv)
"Just not our year.  Literally nothing has gone right.

Madden curse 2020"
Undisciplined ass team.
"Serious question, what does Harbs do during the game? At what point does he step in and tell Roman to wake the fuck up and stop running plays where the receiver is at the LOS on 3rd down? When will he tell these guys to get to the line with more than 5 seconds on the game clock?"
Oh shit hell yeah fuck yes
The nerve that fuckin asshole has to jinx THE Justin Tucker.
QUEEN BWILL
Holy shit Patrick got one!!!!!!
Lets be thankful Dalton is in. Dak would have fucking torched us.
Caribbean Queen!
they keep targeting Harris
Mah Queen
Thank you baby Jesus
God we needed that in the worst way
OH THANK GOD
That's a catch
Thank fuck
HE CAUGHT THAT
Im back
Ayyyy
BIG B WILL
THATS MY DROY
Fingertips pick.
BY HES M U H Q U E E N
Queen is a fucking beast. Best draft pick in a while.
FUCK YES QUEEN!!
There you go Queeennnn
Thank you  football gods
Guys this rollercoaster
YAAAAAAAS
Thank god the Ravens FO knows how to pick first round defensive players
Queen is a ballhawk
Finally Boykin!
FINALLY A FIRST DOWN PASS!
Boykin baby
flashbacks to the beginning of the game
BOYKIN!!!!
Ez
Quick strike!
LETS GOOOOOOOO
"Touchdown Ravens!!

&#x200B;

Miles Boykin"
LETS FUCKING GO BOYKIN!!
Can we put in Queen at receiver?
I thought a fruit punch was coming in against us
Boykin stopped lol
LETS GO MILESSSSSS
"Let's go man, blow these fucks out of the water!!!"
Love to see Lamar air it out!
BOYKIN DID SOMETHING LETS GOOOOOOO
Good shit Boykin way to get that YAC.
BOYKIN TOUCHDOWN
Feed dobbins or fire Roman
MANKIN
"Please, keep telling me that Lamar Jackson sucks"
Helllllllll yeaaaaaa. That’s what happens when you don’t throw it to soulja boi
SHH NO ONE CELEBRATE CUZ WE DON'T WANT IT OVERTURNED
Dead we score a passing TD?
Okay Boykin
BOYKINS #1 RECEIVER
Boykin getting some action let’s go!!!!
I like that it’s a pass play and not some bs fluke qb run.
Action Jackson!!!!
BOYKIN!!!!!! HERE WE GO
"That’s my soulja😈😈

I’m talking about Boykin baby!"
BOYKIN more like WR1
"This fucking game man.  We look bad, but were getting off miracle plays"
Ravens throwing passes over three yards!! I’ll take it!
....I take back my previous post. Tucker just redeemed himself!!!
I like that
Tucker back on track
Also that catch was harder than it had to be Lamar thank you for finding the wide open Boykin
"Feel that? The way the shit clings to the air, Randy? It’s already started, my dear good friend. THE SHIT BLIZZARD -Jim Lahey"
"Miles Boykin? Who's that?

lmao"
He’s BoykIN-the-endzone!
Boykin Goated
Big boi Boykin
#BIG PLAYERS MAKE BIG PLAYS!!
"Lmao my dad said right before the snap, “alright time for a one play touchdown” and I said nah not with Roman calling plays"
Estimated Prophet 😎😎
boykin learned to catch!!!
not this time andy
Just saw Dez in the rafters during the pan out. He’s gonna bungee in during the 4th
Why is the D playing soft? Lots of room is being given.
"Ravens WR1 seems to be the guy that plays in the slot, specifically on the right side of the formation."
"A foot above is head is not high. He caught it pretty easily, stumbled on the run."
Their offense looks good.
Trick plays fuck us up too
Just yeet it
Man we gotta be the worst 3rd down defence in the league jfc
DBs getting their poop pushed in again today?
Wolfe putting work in the past string of games
Our corners are just so frustrating
Andy not looking terrible
"Even if Dak didn't go down, the Cowboys D would be holding this team back so bad.  Idc how many 400 yard games Dak has that Defense is bad."
Derek Wolfe deserves a contract
Our corners takes social distancing seriously. Bold strategy.
"Run defense is there, need the pass coverage to tighten up"
If our defense doesn’t stop blitzing this is gonna be a close game
Wolfe has shown out last few weeks
Did Dean Pees replace Wink today?
Derek Wolfe seems to be getting better w every game
Bro what the fuck defense
“Bend don’t break...unless it’s a close game”
Why the fuck do we constantly play 15 yards off on 3rd down?
Send a blitz and still get no pressure. The ravens special
No pass rush and broken coverage. Perfect combo lmao
Stop playing so far off for fucks sake
"Here goes wink blitzing like his life depends on it again.

Just hold em to a fg and don't turn it over in 2min..."
How is their o-line a turn style on running plays but all day on pass D?
"I’ve always had this feeling that if you play us enough the average QB will learn our scheme and roast us apart, my evidence the career of Andy Dalton."
run defense looks really strong rn tho
Drive was way too long for my taste.
The only solace I can take regarding our defense is that Dallas has really good WRs so I'm not too surprised they're being productive
LMFAOOOOOOO
Thank God he whiffed
Lmfaoooo
This game lmao
LMAOOOOOOOO
Haha at least Tucker was close
Wow. Not even close on that kick
So hard to kick in this stadium in December lol.
Ok I feel better about tuckers miss now
Lmao what is this game
Lmao dejavu
BRUH MOMENT
Something in the air for these kickers
"Anything you can do, I can do betteeerrr"
That wind must be swirling! /S/
LETS FEAST BOYS.
Yeah that was blatant
LMAOOOO
jesus that was egregious
Aikman hates us lol
"Aikman, what? You jock the cowboys?"
We finally got a PI call!
FEED JK
J.K. Fast AF
These asshole announcers lol
JK🤤🤤😫😫😫
"That was a ""you fucked my sister"" tackle"
Mans got RKO’D
Dobbins is so freaking fast
Lamar needs to call that QB guru on day 1 of the off-season lol
DOBBINS JUST DID THE ZEKE LMAO
"LMFAO... they destroyed willson

Ball looked uncatchable but i'll take it"
Can we pls get rid of Aikman as a commentator
Dobbins put on his fast boy cleats it seems
START THIS FUCKING MAN PLEASE
"JK is awesome, man"
Dobbins got wheels too
Let’s get 7 points
DOBBINS. THAT SPEED
"What do these announcers mean ""uncatchable"" and ""way over the heads of everybody""?  He's a professional athlete, he can jump and reach those arms over his head, that was definitely at least \*potentially\* catchable, which is kind of the whole point for why they throw the DPI flag when they tackle the guy before he has a chance to jump for the ball!"
Troy take off the cowboy hat for even 2 seconds please
Simply give dobbins the ball
Maybe stop the clock harbs?
Run some hurry up and keep pounding
Aldon Smith really has awesome seats to watch this game.
Pound with Dobbins
Anyone else see JK shoot the cereal bowl over to the dallas sideline? 😂
I love the juxtaposition of 55 on 15. Dude's like 3x bigger than Hollywood
"Was it shocking? Was it? Now they are shocked he missed one, when its like they jinx him every fucking week. What is it? Yall want him to miss or make it?!"
It’s amazing that other ravens receivers don’t get pissed off watching Marquise play more than them
Thinking about how blessed I am that I can’t hear the commentators for this one
[deleted]
Is marquise brown better or worse than John Ross? Lol discussing with my friend and being dead serious
Is there a way that I can bet there being a flag on a special teams play? Because I feel like I can make some good money if there is
"Certain members of this defense just seem completely unwilling to tackle.  Elliott just zooms past with no effort to push him out of bounds or tackle him at all, the defender looked like he just assumed he was going to go out of bounds, and as a result Elliott uses his awareness and balance skills to make it probably 3 extra yards when he should have been pushed out of bounds immediately.  It's getting really frustrating watching the lazy tackling effort."
Imagine allowing a score to Andy fucking Dalton with a drive that starts with 35 seconds left
Where's the pass rush? We've gone like 8 quarters without a sack.
Our DBs are there to tackle after the ball is caught. Do we ever play man?
"Shit, them having to pass if take away the run, may be bad for us."
can they get a fucking stop
False start? No?
We have barely even made contact with Dalton. How is that possible
"Damn, I thought Marlo was gonna pick that when Lamb slipped, was an easy pick 6 if he did."
How many times has Averett changed his jersey number lmao
That was a nice tackle
Lol
Lucky
Damn gifted
Almost everybody on this field sucks tonight.
We got away with two on that one.
Wow we got lucky?
Board just sent Dalton to another dimension
They got away with a hold
Big miss lol ill take it though
Can we please put any pressure on the QB without blitzing
👨‍🦯
"I’ll admit, that was a bad no call in our favor"
So our defense can stop Big Ben and the Steelers Offense basically twice... but we letting Dalton stand in the pocket with like 10 seconds and not gettin them off the field? Seems legit
Super lucky to avoid two penalties there.
Well that was a freebe
yeah that's a bad missed call
Defense got bailed out by the refs this time.
Let’s rush 8
That was way closer than I would have liked it to be
We could have at least rushed 3 and hoped for a field goal before half.
Well we’re winning. I don’t have much else to say😂
damn that was too close
Silence of the Lamb
What the fuck is this defense doing...
Lucky he didn’t catch that all our guys were just standing there
I love that the hail mary is well underway and Buck is still bitching about a no call from the play before
All the years of 3 fly we played should make everyone an endzone hailmary god😂
Does FOX know this is a nationally broadcasted game? No they don't... Didn't think so.
"Why didn’t we send a 3 man rush? If Dalton had to get that ball away quicker, we could have had a shot at our own Hail Mary!"
At this point I'm not sure if we sign Judon or Yannick. Deffo not big money for either. Super weird situation to navigate after the year is over
Up and down. After these crazy last two weeks — people sick w Covid and no practice — it’s hard to expect normal health and chemistry. Glad we’re winning.
A TD here would be incredible
I think fox likes the Cowboys a little bit don't you?
Lets go second half hope we run it down with dobbins and gus
"Whose Welch, #57? Practice squad?"
This team can’t block a screen for crap
Man I hate these behind the line of scrimmage plays.
I like the play to duvernay. Put the ball in his hands and see what he can do.
"We’re gonna end up winning this game by 3+ scores, guaranteed"
Roughing the kicker
This is the make-up call for the missed hold.
Just not accurate enough...
If your name isnt mahomes or rodgers no team wants to see their QB throw the ball with that technique
That progressive commercial was legit funny
"Run the first play, pass the next two. Again, Greg Roman can fuck off."
Nice pass rush guys!
Man the DL is rough.
Where is the pressure?
Complete embarrassment to our pass rush
How are we not stopping this fucking offense
Awful spot no cap
"These sidearm throws when they aren’t necessary really need to stop.  Otherwise, pretty happy so far.  Only rushing 1 on the Hail Mary was stupid though."
Can someone explain how we are giving Dalton this much time against a Swiss cheese line?
Someone explain to me why our DBs are never in a position to make a play on the ball. They just tackle.
[deleted]
HOW DID HE GET 3 YARDS ON A QB SNEAK
\#78 wasn't holding?
It’s for the best they had it on the first time anyway.
Our D line kinda sucks
The time of possession seems like it’s been so ridiculously lopsided in the Cowboys favor.
This Defense is soft asf at times man
That one game we had a pass rush (Bengals game I think?) was nice.
Lmaoooo
Anyone want to win this thing??
bro
hell yes lmao. We're finally getting some bullshit luck going our way
Whose ready to get bitched by the browns next week
Gamea really buffer with Prime? Smh.
Dude I need Dobbins to just do a little more. If he does a little better I'm the #1 seed in my league.
"more injuries, great"
Man fuck this season I'm so sick of seeing our guys go down
"Pls Ricard, be ok."
"I love what Ingram did last year and the impact he has in the lockerroom..

But part of my soul dies every single time we start a drive with a handoff to him"
"Now just run the ball until they stop it. First, second, third down."
Where is Earl Thomas when you need depth at FB?
Harbs stop being a beta tell Roman's fat ass to put dobbins and Gus in the game WTF
I have no idea why Greg Roman hasn't figured out that he needs to just pick a RB and stick with them.
Stop giving Ingram carries
Tucker 58 yarder coming up. Trust me
"Personally, i would be feeding the ball to jk but what do i know?"
"This offence, yet again, is so inconsistent. It’s so stale to watch."
"Everyone running Iso routes, no separation. I really cannot fathom how Harbaugh is okay with this shit"
Oof 1 for 6 on 3rd down (now 2 for 7)
No excuse for Ingram to run anymore literally zero
Just keep running Lamar. Stop forcing the throw
RPO stuff isn't working anymore. Wish Roman would stop calling it.
"I know guys need rest breaks, but how do we not give Dobbins the ball every play? All he does is gain yards"
I'm curious why there hasn't been as much of lamar juking people out of their damn socks this year. Last year it was like literally every week Lamar was taking souls with jukes. This year its more straight line running.
Dobbins all day that’s why I call him DAD
No offense to Lamar but don’t throw it again this game.
MASTERS GIVEN DOBBINS A SOCK. DOBBINS IS FREE
Dobbins is the best Ohio st running back in the nfl
Another horrible throw
Come on lamar wtf
Another ugly ball.
Why does Lamar’s passing look so much worse this season
lamar... man... come on
"Haven’t stopped dobbins once , let’s throw some mo"
Can we do ANYTHING well without penalties?
terrible throw
Wtf is wrong with Lamar this year
Lamar gets so mad everytime cause he didn't get a TD from these runs
"That throw looked a lot worse than it was, I think.

That looked like a pick in waiting if he had put it ""in the right spot"" ahead of the receiver."
"what are you guys talking about, that window is almost non existant"
Lamar needs to accept who he is and stop trying to be something he’s not. I’m not saying he shouldn’t throw just that he shouldn’t have any pressure to
SOULJA!
Beautiful throw!
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO
WOOHOOOO
Heyyyyyyyyyyyoooooooooooo
 LETS GOO ROAD TO REDEMPTION
That’s 2 straight 3rd downs that Lamar bailed out GR
Soulja
"There's a GREAT fucking throw, and a great catch. Thank you"
Perfect
YES!
Soulja time
SOULJA👿👿
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
there we go lamar! now do that every pass
All my boy Hollywood needs is a good pass
Let’s goooooo
THANK GOD. Great pass and catch
Great play by brown!
LETS GO MAR!! THATS OUR MVP
Calculated. Good call roman
That’s what Hollywood can do just needed a little more confidence after some rough games hope this is the game that turns it all around for him
they all fools they just activated goat lamar for the rest of the season
"Team is starting to find its rhythm though, it seems finally!!"
The field been slippery tonight
Make the stop
Lets put Geno stone in he played some DB in college
Omg the r/NFL game thread is such a toxic place.  I mean its fun when its not your team playing but jc the Lamar hate over their is real.
This girl wants to fuck andy
We couldnt even get pressure by bringing the house.
Pass rush is a consistent problem every year.
Not being mentioned in the AFC is old school let's gon
Another blitz where no one gets close to Dalton and he throws to a wide open receiver.
Okay but why the fuck we have Averett on Cooper???
Averett back like he never left
Secondary is getting fucking cooked
Fucking learn to tackle Jesus
Oh my fucking God. Just tackle
Is Malik Harrison hurt? Why is board in there?
We have no ability to stop them on 3rd down.
Holy shit that’s embarrassing. Had 2 on 1
Man this defense honestly is quite disappointing.
I know they’ve only let up ten points but this defense is atrocious
How do you let him get that first...
What is with this defence on 3rd and 5+
Our tackling is so soft.
Short catch and run is killing ua
FORT he is so good
Nice play by fort
"Someone needs to drug test wink.

Blitzing humphrey there is malpractice."
Dalton is pretty solid as usual.
A SACK????
What is this 🤩
"I just really don't understand so much this season. Like we've absolutely blown up inferior lines this season, even before we got Yannick. Why are we getting nothing done in pass rush today?"
Our prayers have been answered!
A sack? Are those allowed?
Finally
Yeah fucking sack let’s gooo
"GOD, FINALLY."
well timed sack
OMG A SACK WHAT IS THIS
We remembered what a sack is (cue anime wow)
BUY YOUR LOTTO TICKETS
FINALLY a sack
HADDY
FINALLY
Yannick just snuck in for a half sack LMAO
fucking finally a sack
Hahahahahahahahahaha
"Clutch sack.

And a missed FG is icing on the cake."
BUM ASS
#HOLY SHIT
Holy shit lol
Finally a sack
Oh my god- McCarthy wants his boys to go Hunger Games on Zerlein
Oof
Wtf is that
Holding my Justin Tucker extra close tonight
Greg will be unemployed by Breakfast.
"LMAO 😂😂😂 1-4 on FGs, couldn’t be my kicker 😌"
holy hell their kicker sucks
Ye yee
"Holy fucking shit, Greg the leg is in fucking shambles!"
That kicked just lost his job
Angry run!
Joe buck is just built different at jinxing kickers
This ones for you WFT
BIG DICK RIC BIG DICK SHOULDER
The hell is going on with our stadium today? Nobody can kick
I kind of feel bad for Zeuerlein but I also don’t
NEW DAY SUCKS
Pat Richard is our big body receiver
Zuerlein committed to the tank lol
Let’s keep the bus moving
Gus has been rising to the occasion!
Kinda feel for Greg
Can't stop wont stop
Edwards is so good
Imagine trying to tackle a 300 pound dude running full speed
Lol Ricard
25 made a mistake there
Just walked home from the bar in Frederick and we seem to not be shitting the bed anymore. What happened boys?
Damn he trucked him
I feel for Zuerlein
That’s a big boi😂
Gus edwards is shifty as hell
Gus all day every day
Holy fuck gus
"My stream has fallen way behind, but this thread tells me I have something to look forward to."
Miss seeing this last week
Lamars game is on point today
"Gus Bus 5 for 70. This shouldn't happen. Run him so much more. The wheels on the bus don't stand still, that's for sure."
Wow even Ingram got a pretty decent run in there!
"Dobbins doing the carrying, Gus coming in for the big gains and Ingram coming in during the 4th quarter fresh. No teams stand a chance if we can pull it off well and still make the account for Lamar"
Line has looked good from what I've seen. Lamar looking back to himself. God I hope this is a springboard game
Put this in so I can sleep
Dammit. What's up with this redzone offense
he had dobbins early on that smh
Lol harbs get contacts bro. Life is way better with hem promise you also Lamar myl is s was wideeee
I'm gonna say Lamar saw the crossing DB and threw it in the dirt on purpose
"Lamar's playing ok for a guy who has barley practiced. Problem is, that a lot of these plays have also happened pre-COVID."
I think it was more miscommunication than bad throw. Lamar expected Boykins to dive on it low.
"Happy that Lamar is running again, but damn those missed throws are inexcusable. Most backups could hit that throw"
"*after that rollout call*

""Hey Roman. You know Andrews isn't in the game, right?""

Roman: ""WHAT!!???? SINCE WHEN????"
Ngl I almost shit my pants when Campbell limped off and Richard went down.. glad both are back in the game. Resuming my blackout now 🍺🍺🍺
Dallas defense looks absolutely gassed.  Punish mode engaged.  Just let the bus go finish this shit and let's get Ricard a td....the man deserves it
Is it just me or is the fake crowd cheering for the Cowboys?
These wrs are wiide open
3 times better than the Steelers at this point
"We have 250 rush yards on 30 attempts, and we’re up 17 in the fourth quarter. That we’re throwing at all other than the every four or five plays, change of pace, is absurd."
Holding in the backfield not called again would’ve been a sack
Haddy might be a viable interior rusher
Wow they made up for the original spot
Another first down thanks to Humphrey going for the ball instead of the tackle
Are they finally gonna called the right tackle for the false start
I pray Jimmy is healthy next week...
He’s fucking short
Not fruit punch!
WHAT. IS. A. FIRST. DOWN?!
That's not an opi?
NOT MARLON
Not Humph :(
Even when shit goes right for us shit goes bad
Be ok be ok be ok
I hope humphrey is ok but our defense is playing real dumb right now
"Maybe I am exaggerating but this is the best the offense has looked since opening day. Despite just coming off the COVID List Lamar looks just like I expected to, inconsistent. But running the ball has been amazing and the offense overall seems to be clicking a lot more"
jimmy smith’s presence is missed so much
Update: Humph seems fine
The ref spotted him short then realized it was close so he gave it to him. The refs in the NFL do that a lot.
My mental health is not good already and now hump is down
Marlo please be ok.
Damn that rocket mortgage ad had TERRIBLE acting
No... no no no no no... please be okay Marlon
Marlon stretching on sidelines wants to come back in. We are okay
If Marlo misses any time we done for
LOL another embarrassment by Averett
No facemask? That's surprising.
They are going after Averette
I think ravens fans started loving Marlon so much because Jimmy was and is oft hurt but when it comes to playing corner and covering the best receiver on the other team. I truly believe Jimmy is the best of that description to play the position for the Ravens.
I mean what even is tackling though amirite?
#CAN WE PLS LEARN HOW TO TACKLE
These singing competitions are asssss
"honestly I would rather us bring back Bowser over Yannick, Bowser almost has it all together meanwhile Yannick is just too inconsistent and is gonna want a lot of dough."
Did 73 help tackle his own man...?
Thats as obvious as it gets on that hold
This defense has some really bad games. This is one of them.
"That was a pretty nice play by Elliott, I’ll admit."
Wrap the fuck up..it’s embarassing
LJ Fort came to play holy shit he’s fun
#YASSS WE PICKED IT
Why can’t this team tackle? Wrap the fuck up
They just ignored that hands to the face
Our defense BLOWS today.
Wtf he waited an hour to throw the flag
Of course it’s a flag
Why defense do so bad
Defense is concerning for next weekend
Ngakoue so close there
Review that please????????????????????????????
Why tf would you not challenge that?
That was an INT
WHAT
BULLSHIT CALL
Wow that was a catch
Can’t do shit if these cocksuckers won’t call holds
Should have challenged
lol on knocking the ball out of forts hand
i hope they kick it so they can miss the FG again lmao
Is that considered a pick even if the ball touched the ground after he was down?
Horrible call
"Wait wtf flashbacks to our bad ass final stand pls do this. Edit : fuck yessss two games in a row

Edit 2 : fuck"
Yannick missed that strip sack by literally a couple inches
Stout
STUFFED
the goal line defense on this team does not quit.
Defense not breaking..let's fucking go
BWil is huge
so stupid
GET THAT SHIT OUTTA HERE
Why didn't they just throw on 1st lol.
All that just to let amari be open
What a catch
A WR making that stretching play and toe tapping is what the Ravens need
Well give them enough times and they'll eventually get it. Wink better reem this defense out after the game
watch the onside or other special teams fuckery
Offense needs to close it out
Wtf is our coverage tonight.
All that to let Coop get wide open
If peters would ball hawk more than he fucked up id be cool with his missteps.
Inc 3 and out
Bring back the burnt toast memes
These passing D needs to be fixed yesterday man
"Survive this game and regroup in practice.

Plz no fumbles on this next drive."
Aikman go run headfirst into a brick wall challenge
Lol not even a question
Lol wtf was Dallas even looking at?
wtf?
Haha nice try
Shouldn't have been that complicated but ok. Let's wrap this game up.
It was a catch but it doesn't make a difference at this point. Who cares
No shot Dallas has that.
"Yay, more rushing yards"
That was most certainly a pick tho
Dude just give dobbins the fucking ball
If turnovers are automatically reviewed why not rule it a pick and let it get reviewed?
We literally run the same 5 plays on offense
It worked. But giving it to Ingram there was dumb
We run woooooo I cant fucking believe it
game over
Edwards is feasting!
Hell yeah nice run
OMG Ingram did something!
Gus Edwards best game by far. Dude is actually making downfield moves???? What????
Well. Cowboys are bad.
Smart run by Gus. Love it
ok who we thinking for player of the game
gus is a beast man
"Gus really is like a closing pitcher man, he’s a monster when you need time off the clock lol"
Good for Ingram. Unfortunately that will get him more snaps lol.
Gus Edwards lmao.
These spots are pissing me off
If our offense was less predictable we would dominate like last y ear. I mean we all knew gus was getting the ball there still 20+
Having fewer yards to go than enough to get 300 Rush yards is sad to see
Love to see a JK TD
Probably don’t put LJ in the firing line with the game basically over plz
Pad those stats!!!
ez $
EASY MONEY
The hay is in the barn!
YEE FUCKIN HAW
Easy money baby
My fantasy team is pleased thank you Jk
Ez Mun-e
Damn why couldn’t our covid game be against this team
Oh Oh We’re Baaaaack
Somehow the Cowboys offense wasn’t also the issue for them tonight.
Yannick can't even get Dalton when he's uncovered. Dude needs to step his game up.
Deshon going full goldberg
NICE HIT DESHON
lay the wood joker
Really thought Elliot was weddle for a sec lmao
"Don't love that the d is playing like they already won, even though they basically have"
GG BOYS
gg boys
JT gettin that royal farms money
Why don’t we hear “John Harbaugh is a special teams coach” there? It’s funny how they only bring it up on the special occasion that something goes right lol
I realized I just hate watching this team. That they were gonna come out with a chance to put this away and instead go three and out with a miserable series was entirely predictable.
Lamar couldn’t set his feet fully but Boykin needs to come back for the ball 🤷🏽‍♂️
I hope we can get Trace in for a bit
this defense still can't tackle
Sign Will Fuller for the low next season
Fuck joe buck forever
Pollard almost got the 1st down because peters refuses to fucking make a tackle
Hollywood is mr big waste (of a draft pick)
Great throw Lamar! Nice way to start the half 🔥
If you have positive opinion about Lamar don’t go on r/NFL u will get downvoted to oblivion
That was BAD. Fuck man
"If we play like this next week, we're gonna be FUCKED by the Browns and bye bye playoffs"
"I would like to point you to my comment in this thread 2 hours ago. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/k9gc3e/-/gf4e7hn"
"Here comes Lamar


He ain’t played in two weeks- be prepared for rust folks!"
we cursed now boys
"Was really looking forward to seeing Dez throw up the X in all black, on Dallas.

Stupid covid."
"He was only around the entire team and hugging cowboys.

Nobody close....and now offhandedly blaming fauci lol.  liquor time"
Man the ravens look completely different than last year. Thought Lamar was the next Vick
"Shit throw, shit effort. It was a shit play all around"
"On the Hollywood tip. Wasn’t the best throw,  it it’s watch catchable if he used two hands and doesn’t already begin going up field."
i will gladly miss playoffs if it means roman's ass is gone and we actually get a good fucking receiver for once that isnt 78 years old
Seems like every time we throw it to the soldier it’s a int 🤣
That's not on Dobbins. That's blocking amd scheme.
Guys let's just be positive
"Greg Roman needs to go, this shit is embarrassing, it isn’t even the on-field shit, its persistent pre snap penalties and nonsense wasted plays and free turnovers. This offence completely relies on Lamar just being better than everyone else. There is 0 coaching"
Lol. I know it worked - but it shouldn’t have. That’s the exact same fucking play GRO always calls on 4th and short.
We should be eating these guys alive. They’re arguably worse than the Jets.
Every time we score defense turns into shit and they drive effortlessly.
"Refs always have been against us, why are yall acting suprised"
This would be a shutout with our 2019 team.
Why is Marlon criticism so downvoted here?
Humphrey and DPI. Name a better duo.
"I usually get really heated and emotional during ravens games. Honestly tonight I just feel completely deflated and dead inside. 

Last season I woulda been running around my apartment after that 37 yard run by Lamar and yelling at our blown kickoff stop/td.

Tonight, I'm just curled up on the couch with my kitty who's sleeping and I cant be bothered to wake her so I'm just sitting in silence. No excitement, no frustration. Just indifference, numbness. I know this is overly dramatic, but I'm just so bummed by how this season, and YEAR, is going, that it's hard to get my hopes up."
What the hell is this play calling.  Stop getting cute and smash them
LMao we are so bad with the fucking options. run it up the god damn B gap you bitch
Seriously? Lamar's first and only read on that play was a fucking 2 yard swing route? Just seems so low effort.
WHY THROW IT TO THE FIRST READ?!
Gro can just fucking go suck a dick
This team is fucked
They literally always jinx him
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SAY SOMETHING
Joe Buck is a fucking simp
And those jackasses had to jinx tucker
FUCK YOU JOE BUCK
I mean it's hardly a jinx if they talk about his record literally every time he kicks. Eventually he's going to miss one and that's not a jinx. Not that there's any such thing as a jinx anyway.
I actually think buck took satisfaction in calling that miss
"This team does not , and I have never been so certain of anything in my life, deserve to be in the playoffs. You can’t keep dropping passes, making inaccurate throws, missing tackles, missing blocks, calling bad plays, and getting penalty after penalty and be a playoff team. It’s bad business we need a harsh reality check and draft position."
"I honestly can't believe there are so many comments blaming the fucking announcers that Tucker missed.  Come on, y'all"
What a read and throw by Lamar. And credit to Boykin for getting that open.
Lamar just lay it in their hands just once bb
"Dawg, Boykin almost fucked that up. Lamar was leading him forward lmao. Boykin kind slowed down in anticipation. Happy that worked out."
Looks like yannick doesn’t want to get paid
Shut the fuck up Aikman
Isn’t it beautiful when we rollout Lamar when his best target area is the middle third of the field?
Perriman > Brown
"I hope we win for WFTs sake, they straight up balled out on Pittsburgh"
Wtf how is that not DPI??
Bailed out
Troy no one gives a shit. Have a coffee and a water during halftime
lmao woulda been such bullshit if ceedee actually got that
So if Dez tested positive does that mean a bunch of the guys on the field will be going into COVID protocol this week since I’m sure they had some contact with him?
And of course we come out throwing in the second half
Offense is still trash
Marlon is straight up lost out there.
Rush getting exposed without Judon
3 pass three and out anyone?
Hollywood fault. He aint as good as dk or aj so that's why he couldn't catch that throw
And justice hill comes in to get them out of FG range and then leaves. Thanks fucko
"Lamar’s had some bad moments this game, but I think I’m feeling a little better about him right now."
"Ravens DBs and inability to tackle, name a better duo"
MVP JACKSON STOP PLAYING WITH THAT MAN😩💦🍆
"Somebody needs check on Dez 

Something ain’t right"
Imagine how fucking dangerous the Raiders offence would be this year if Amari never threw his bitch fit for the trade
I thought Yannick was really going to make a difference here.  I actually don’t even remember the last time we had a good pass rush.  Maybe it’s only partially on the players?
He had a man wide open
"If we go up by 21 in the 4th, do we let Trace MUTHAFUCKING McScorely eat??????"
Man.. can't help but think that would've been a TD with Gus or JK
15 pass plays is good and bad
So Boykin should’ve had close to 75 yards with 2TD if Lamar could just throw the ball correctly
Pain
You guys will be fine. You’ll win out.
They just gave them hope man wtf
EASY MONEY
dont be doing no damn tiktok dances
We could see Trace take a snap this game 👀🔥🙏🏾
Mister Biscotti.... I... I dont feel so good...
"Don’t cry we never get any calls, most penalised team in the league. Deserved"
Damn dude his throws are so bad
Yo he almost didn't catch that.
"These announcers are getting on my nerves, Aikman is such a homer"
"Dude AGAIN. Boykin wide open and he puts it in the dirt, his mechanics are fucked"
Sorry lady but cervical cancers closer to your uterus than your heart /s
"Tackling is dog shit this year, what is Harbaugh doing?"
Shit throw
Tucker kicking looks off so far ngl
"this fuckin sub has been so irritating since the influx of post 2019 fans

anything less than a 30-0 win is a fireable offense to you guys jfc"
Not going to lie that was pretty fucking funny 😂😂😂
"HOW DOES HOLLYWOOD NOT GET 2 FEET IN THERE

He's so bad, literally any WR in the league gets 2 feet in there regardless of the penalty."
"This offense isn’t beating anyone in the playoffs if by some miracle we even make it. 

No WRs. Hollywood isn’t doing anything special. Lamar has regressed badly with accuracy and touch. For every good pass he makes 3-4 bad ones.

Roman ...fuck off"
Browns r gonna end our  szn on primetime if we come out like this
Rushing 1 person? What a fucking terrible decision
"If we had the chiefs playbook, we'd be way better at passing"
"Lamar is miles worse than he was last year. His mechanics are fucking shot right now. You can't be an MVP QB and miss wide open receivers on 3rd down. Coaches need to be on his ass, quite frankly."
"We're the only fanbase with a franchise QB that gets mad when the OC calls pass plays.

Just be real, deep down y'all have serious doubts about Lamar."
The cognitive dissonance of this sub defending Lamar for everything he does while also decrying Roman every time we throw the ball sure is something.
"This dude yannick is a bum, literally has been non existent all szn"
We will not beat the Browns playing like this next week
"So trading for Yannick was a waste, that sucks I was hype for him. Pass rush is still more nonexistent than my life."
HOW DO YOU GIVE THEM THAT FIRST DOWN. GOD THIS FRONT 7 IS A BUNCH OF PUSSIES
You guys feel like this is a season changing game? Because I feel it is? I feel it in my heart.
What has happened between his MVP season and this season that has caused Lamar's mechanics to regress back to his rookie season? We rarely saw these throws straight into the dirt and balls sailing horribly last season.
"I don’t think we will, but if we lose to the cowboys and Andy dalton I will be have to take a 2021 break from this franchise"
#ERIN ANDREWS ISN'T THAT HOT
Hmmmmm...Justin Tucker missed a  measly 36-Yd Field Goal  😮😮
This still doesn’t redeem him....but he’s getting their.
"wait

mls is about to play their champ game ??

shows how little i give a fuck about soccer lmao"
#I love this team FR but the Ravens just never look prepared for primetime games.....the narrative is starting to look like it's real
Even a wide open TD throw looked strangely awkward and unnecessarily difficult
damn people flaming hollywood for something that wasn't his fault lol
"Realistically, if Baltimore loses this game, does the conversation start about a coaching change be it head or OC"
"HOLY SHIT! 

WTF IS GOING ON"
Game should be canceled
"First game in two months (boot camp), let’s go bois"
Andy Dalton is a cool guy but damn do I hate playing this mf
Lol why run it on 3rd and 24
COVID beat lamars ass
"Looked like illegal contact to me.  Or holding.  Something, there was definitely some pulling on Brown's jersey, and some contact with his arm, as he was trying to make that catch."
"Fire Roman, cut Hollywood's sorry ass"
Really making the cowboys oline look elite
The qbs job is to get that ball within an arms length of the receiver. Any other top we can make that catch. That wasn’t on LJ
I want a coach that can salvage Lamar. He's falling apart out there.
"Dobbins touch’s ball, gets 15 yards, won’t be used again until the 3rd quarter. Fucking GRo"
Honestly it’s whatever that Dez is gone man dude wasn’t going to turn this offense around and suddenly make us 2019 ravens again. Cya Dez
This coaching staff needs to go
I think he did that same arm motion to the sideline that he did in the Seattle game last year that was also a 4th and 2 and also was a lamar run up the middle for a td
I promise you there is no reason that we need to throw the ball more than 20 times this game. Please Greg don’t fuck this up
Good call
I haven’t enjoyed watching the ravens since week 1
Marlon is hit and miss
Don’t worry Zeke will have a fumble eventually
Being a ravens fan. Pain :(
y’all acting like corners can’t have bad plays chill that’s his first td let up all year
yeah let’s hurt these announcers
Fucking trash announcers
THESE FUCKING ANNOUNCERS JUST KILLED MY BOY TUCKER. I WANT BLOOD.
We don’t have the offense for a comeback either
Joe Buck is a cunt
He almost overthrew a wide open Boykin
There's no way this has ever happened before
Who wants to lose more?
Hollywood is a perfect nickname for him. And I don’t mean that in a good way
"This illegal formation stuff is a staple of roman's offenses. 

However, he has called an objectively good game overall."
Why is it that I keep watching our defenders (this time it was Averett) hit or wrap up a guy but they still get another 3 or more yards before actually going down?
Why is that not a 10s runoff?
"Oh so when a call against the cowboys is missed they make a huge deal, but against the ravens they are silent"
"Bailed out, Deshon Elliot always getting burned when I see him. I swear."
"Why the fuck would just let them run out the clock. Send nobody on blitz, fuck sakes."
That damn sidearm shit
We're lucky that the cowboys are awful.
#jimbrownwasaraven
Ricard is someone we can’t lose man
JK laying the wood on Jalen Smith!!!
Like lamar is a rb its not wven funny anymore
No excuse for this guys. This is just shit qb play.
yall was saying?
"Keep talking sh*t about Lamar's passing, guys. I think it's working just a little"
Not bad for for a $10.99 plush toy on the clearance shelf.
That draft kings chick has a head as big as a fat melon JFC
Does wink not think adjustments are real
Queen is looking good. All over the offense. Excellent draft pick.
oof he had a first just going up the middle :(
Have the cowboys stopped a run for less than 5 yards more than once this game? Why the fuck we running empty on 3rd and goal?
Such a bad throw god dammit
Shitty throw. At least we don’t have RG3 in though
All these outside the hash and sideline timing throws dalton is throwing just makes me wonder how good lamar could be... sigh
Phantoms PI??
Your up 17 with 5 minutes to go just see if you got it the hell
"Peters, which game is this guy going to show up at"
Oh Marcus what is u doin
"If we have no pressure on Monday, Baker is going to feast"
MP half glass of juice ass mf
The defense needs to walk home tonight lol
These refs are definitely on the Cowboys’ payroll.......
Spectacular 0 yard run from lamar there.
Obj sounding off isn't quite a normal sight to be seen. Boy is quiet he must be feeling it tonight!
Happy to see Lamar and Souljah chatting
"A win is a win, but I would've liked to see some progress in the passing game. Lamar has taken a big step back this year."
averett looking like some chaps pit beef. good god he’s ass.
That a terrible throw by Lamar though. Still shoulda been a catch. But goddam what a bad 3 yard throw.
We’re just a bad team lol it’s not that complicated
"Honestly, being a ravens fan has been embarrassing"
CD Lamb wasn't catching that ball regardless of that hold
Terrible play call by Martindale. Didn’t like that at all.
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but we ain't going to beat the Browns playing like this."
Mechanics are fucked.
Anyone even average at throwing could hit that pass
Did...did Hollywood just...run a route?
The fuck was Peters dapping up the cowboys coach for???
"Ooft that should've been picked.

Edit: nah would've been a tough one."
Awful throw
Trace mcsorely time?
Jimmy Smith is the leader of this secondary when he is playing  they look different
Hey Ingram got more than a yard and a half
Soooo Andy Dalton going to end our season 2 times in the past 5 years hahahaha? you really can’t make this shit up
Browns fan... you guys are more than likely gonna win this game... but do you guys think you’s look off lately? Probably because of all the covid stuff but damn you guys looked like a different football team the first bit of the season. Also obligatory fuck the Steelers.
Rare nice throw by lamar
Does any QB get killed for their first inaccurate throw of the game the way Lamar does?
"Fake News, Dallas Won, stop the count. We need a recount."
How’s life?
That wasnt a terrible pass for a RB
I haven’t been this excited for 2 games back to back for a long time (forgot the last time lol)
:(
🥲
I really really hope that he was incredibly careful today since his AM test was inconclusive.
How much we winning by tonight boys
"poor Dez. He got the rona :(. Hope he gets recovered well, even if he doesn't play ball for us"
All I can say is ... at caramba
"We fucking got this, with or without Dez. 

**BELEE**"
Lets go boys!!!
Demeatrice Jr about to stunt on dem boys.
Lamar with covid is still faster than everyone
Tit Bit Nippily tonight at The Bank
Why does Zeke just look.... dirty
They’re going to run because it’s all they have. Zeke will fumble hopefully.
What are the cowboys doing lol.
What was that playcall by dallas?
"Has a team ever played on 6 days rest four times in a row before? We boutta do Wed, Tues, Mon, Sun"
And we’re still running with Ingram up the middle for 2 on first
https://twitter.com/dezbryant/status/1336473462668464128?s=21
Oh that motion with Hollywood could be interesting. I would love to fake the handoff to him and then fire it to him on the wheel if open
Nice
Why are we running Ingram in the middle on first...
Rust?
Get Mark out of the game...
Fluker looking real terrible
Mother F
Don't run backwards
Just run the damn ball...
WHAT THE FUCK BROWN
Not ideal
Well shit...
Nice throw by lamar
Dude
Can we shit can gro already
Seriously fuck Brown. Bigger just that Perriman
Hollywood didn’t even try for that
Imagine calling yourself a souljia and being a soft little bitch game in and game out...
Embarrassing
Why is the score -0 to 0?
"Can brown fucking try, fucking disgraceful"
Use two hands brown.
Hope this does not turn into a td
"Just jumped into the game, someone tell me why Dez ain’t playing, I’d heard he’s not???"
Im still mad about that INT from the terrible play call to the throw to WR #15 trying to one hand it
Does anyone find it at least a little bit funny that the Steelers wide receivers tip a million balls into the air and none of them get picked while ours always seem to fall right into defenders laps.
Dont use Queens pic
"Today's the only game I'm not going to be able to watch in its entirety because I have leadership training.

I'm somehow not as upset about that as I normally would be.

Jesus Christ we're tough to watch this season."
BUS
This is why I would be so hesitant to pay Lamar if I was DeCosta. The inconsistency scares the shit out of me.
2nd and 3 is so different than 2nd and 9. Please no more Ingram.
Roman: let’s take gus Edwards out now and give Ingram 50 carries
If Jk isn’t 100 % then give the ball to Gus over ingram.
I missed what happened with Dez ???
Loom what happens when we put in dobbins
Why wasnt Dobbins starting again?
"Huh, running Gus/Dobbins works? Keep doing that and stop benching them roman"
Holy shit Dobbins
And now we won’t see dobbins again till the second half
If Ingram gets another snap we should riot he’s not good anymore
"Gus Edward's has been our best hb for around 3 years , what the fuck does he have to do to start?"
Yes please! read option
NOW LETS GIVE IT TO INGRAM FOR 2 YARDS
Inexcusable that's the first we saw dobbins lol
Better sit dobbins.
Bozeman has been so underrated this year
Wow......ffs
Is there a way to find out how many interceptions are thrown when targeting a specific receiver.
Time to take dobbins out!
HMMMMM Idk guys I don't think we should use this Dobbins guy? /s
I hope we just run run run now.
my man dobby
Oh come on....Skura wearing a different jersey.
JK HOFFA
We love mistakes
What happened with Dez?
We’re cheeks.
Shura at it agian
Our soulja
Mekari trash
Where’s that C from last week? Dude was a monster.
Seriously Dobbins not being the main guy is the only example you need to showcase Romans incompetence
Jesus this fucking team is impossibly difficult to watch
If we can’t score on the Cowboys who have one the worst defenses EVER. I need to see a firing idc
Luke.... WILSON
Oh wow Hollywood fought for extra yards!
"If we can’t beat this defense, we can’t beat any defense."
LUKEEEEEE
Guaranteed Roman kills the run before the cowboys do.
ALRIGHT COACH LETS GO FOR IT
"our offense was so good last year because we had an explosive running attack... idk what happened but ingram just doesnt have it anymore, literally every other back has it way more however"
Lamar gonna pick it up himself watch.
If only lamar could play under center
OMFG! Snap the ball properly
If we go for it...better be Dobbins.
Give it to Dobbins
"Roman, cut the shit with the cute passes for brown."
"We’re doing our best to screw this up, come on guys, shake it off"
Luke Wilson for TE3
Run here
"Why, what the fuck is the point in throwing to that useless piece of shit, he can't juke or out-run anyone"
"Hollywood is such a bitch man, can't fight anyone off"
the cowboys are beyond trash
Dick fingers Willson caught it!
Lamer is the goat
dial up a 12 yard pass concept on 2nd and 18 don't just call a fucking screen every time
hell yeah!
Hell yes!
Cowboys are so trash 😂😂😂
Word up
That was... easy
NICE
LJ8 BABY
LMFAOOOOOO LESGOOOOOO
"LET""S GOOOOO"
Add it to the reel!!!
HOW BOUT DAT LAMAR!?
LETS GO
was that llama’s longest run of the year??
ILU LAMAR
#JUST GIVE IT TO LAMAR
LAMAR IS BACKKKK BABYYYYYYY
WE MISSED YOU KING!
That’s our Quarterback
Focus on rushing attack feels soooooo good.
Idec just run it we can have Georgia tech stats for all I care just put ur head down and ram your way to the damn super bowl who cares
Just keep running it
Welcome back BAby
How many yards was that?
Lmao Dallas sucks
DAS MY FUCKJNG QUARTER BACK BITCH
And a competent OC
Now let’s see if our defense can show up against the fucking Cowboys.
"The passing game is still a shit show, but atleast that was nice"
Ffs
FUUUUCK WHERE IS OUR DEFENSE
Lol
I missed the starting offensive line up for the Ravens when Fox ran it; is the o-line Brown/Bozeman/Mekari/Powers/Phillips from left to right?
Why he running side by side with pollard?
Harrison and Harris fucked their lanes
Dogshit special teams.
"That's the kind of play we can make when the team we're playing has to respect our other backs. They bit on Dobbins going to the outside. Granted Dallas has a really bad defense, but it's good to see us play to our strengths"
Let's go d!
what the fuck
lmao rip
figures
Ugh
I see no pass rush
This team man
Make that money dak!
Looks like we’re in for a rollercoaster tonight
God balls
DAMN IT
Marlo?
Sad noises
What is going on with our coverage today?
Oh come on
damn one of the worst plays i’ve seen from humphrey in a long time
This team is depressing
Doesn't matter but how tf is that DPI?
Fuck off special teams..
Welp great job guys! 👏🏼
Fucking lol
The only way our offense can get yards is through fluke running plays and now our defense is looking like ass.
Dallas got Scott Farkus at qb tonight. Love the Justin Townes Earle on the outro though!
"To any team in the NFC east, we’re truly sorry lol"
Pass rush needs to start getting to the qb
"Fuck passing, establish the run"
Lamar really needs to hand it off more often
Lamar breaking more records!
Defense in the neutral zone? His hand was past the fucking ball
Marquis Brown did a thing!
NGL I Highkey love Tuesday night football
I understand we scored on that play but that is a disrespectful play call to our wideouts and I wouldnt expect any DC to call anything different.
Gus Gus gua
YASSS GUS
Bus
Roman can't cook up a passing game at all
LOL LETS GOOOOO GUSSSSSS
MMMMMM INJECT THAT RIGHT INTO MY VEINS
"Holy shit, it's like running the ball WORKS."
damn Gus is good
GUS BUS KEEPS ROLLING
KEEP RUNNING THE BALL. The Cowboys rush defense is horrendous!
Good great grand get on the (Gus) bus
Where tf is Dobbins
**LETS GO GUS**
IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE BUS SHOULD BE KEPT OUT OF THE DEPOT SOME MORE
"This Cowboys defense sucks so bad, if we don't gift their offense points this shouldn't even be close"
Are the ravens running offense that good or are the cowboys running defense that bad?
"Keep the defense out of shit spots, run the ball, this should be a bad night for Dallas."
I’m so glad I’m not a cowboys fan 😂😂
Run that fucking rock
Okay Fluker I see u
"Ingram with a long run, did Edwards slip on his jersey???"
Big pancake by Fluker there 😍
Stop switching the damn running back every play pls
Get Justice Hill out here! Run everybody!
Lets not throw the ball all game. Seriously.
Play action now!
Ricard totally fucked up that play lol
Has the speed option worked this year?
We gotta keep running the ball!
Ummm keep it up the gut. Option hasn’t worked much
Sighhh
Fake FG inbound
Just tuned in....can someone tell me how the cowboys scored? Turnover? Bad defense?
Why was hollywood so slow off the line there
Right call but I think the defense made that call.
I'm kinda shocked it wasn't Fluker. I would have had him to get a penalty first.
Pain.
Welp. Fucked er boys. We’re losing to the cowgirls
Fucking Christ can you curse us more
Gotta be fucking kidding me
What the fuck is going on
Fuck Joe Buck.
Well shit
I came in to this fully expecting a loss.
My mouth actually droppee
lol
No way
Cut Tucker?
Fucking hell
Why god why
I’m beyond tired of this team beating itself
Shake it off. Defense has to come up big here.
Yeah man
fucking garbage announcers.
"That FG is good from 31.

Fuxking penalties this year."
This is the second time this game we were jinxed! The first time they praised Humphrey before their td was thrown to his man! Absolutely cursed!
Well this is less than ideal. Defense has to step up now.
I think this team has some voodoo shit on it because it’s just not our year
Nobody cares. Work harder.
So Tucker short kicked it and they couldn’t cover costing field position now he misses. Not his day.....
Getting 2012 AFC championship vibes
Announcers mention that every time tucker kicks it's notthe announcers fault he missed hes a fucking human. Its. abig surprise I know but he is not a robot incapable of missing. Be happy he is human. That's what makes him so awesome.
Chose the wrong month to be sober from alcohol
Tackling continues to be atrocious.
Lol this game is going well. It’s been the same shit in every loss since the Chiefs and the 2nd Steelers game. Bad play calls. Small mistakes. Penalties. Let the other team hang around and then we choke.
Learn to tackle pls no offense but damn
"But fr, Koch called for the snap on the false start right?  Why didn't Cox snap the ball?"
Dobbins is the best RB on the team and they barely use him
Who’s 33? I remember thinking he looked solid last season
Defense heard me!!
Lol it kinda feels like everything that could go wrong is going wrong with this team. Sad times
Please tell me it’s a pick
Let's a forced turnover here... fruit punch time
Idk if he caught it I hope so lol
I think that hit the turf....I hope not!!!
Awwww yeah!
Ok now we redeem
Dolt on
Finally dammit
Well there's a fucking break at least
Patrick Queen DROY
YASSSSSS QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEENNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
No team wastes more talent than this fucking team
Great INT Queen.

Brandon Williams bailing us out

Can’t wait to waste this opportunity
Nice catch
Big fucking Boykin!!!
LETS GOOO
Cowboys secondary making Boykin look NFL-caliber
Nice

Tucker missing the kick was actually good for us 😂
THERE WE FUCKING GO BOIS
LETS GO MYLES!!! NOW THATS A SOULJA BENCH THAT BUM 15
"Killa Queen, Bites Za Dusto"
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Well that was quick!
Fuck yeah Boykin!!!
More of that yes
Lamar is back in so may ways!
Wow this game is a rollercoaster
Let's turn this game around boys!!
LETS FUCKING GO BOYKIN
LETS GO
We should score at least 40 this game lol
Was that the spark we needed?
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO.
that was fast
Dallas took our memes about not needing to cover Boykin literally
Boykin! Let’s fuckin go buddy!
LVE IS GETTING FUCKING COOKED TODAY
Now I’m happy Tucker missed
We just need Special Teams and Defense to not shit the bed here
Tucker 88D Chess easy W
Oooo. That ball was close to coming out.
Ferguson chopping to get edge contain on the reverse and then looked surprised when they actually came over there lmao
OPI?
Zeke Ingram
Corners don’t look interested in playing tonight.
Awooooooo! 🐺
Peters giving me a fucking ulcer with the soft coverage
How is Dallas moving the ball on us?
What is this soft ass coverage
Our pass rush sucks
"If it's thrown underneath at Peters, you're going to catch it"
Why someone always open
How does he get that wide open 😂
WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE WIDE OPEN
Ginger picking us apart
Lack of pass rush there was awful.
Secondary what is you doin
Just give him the first down clowns
From scrimmage to 1st down there wasn't a single body in the zone
FUCKING GET TO DALTON. GOD DAMN
"No pressure, no coverage is a bad combo"
send EVERYONE and let receivers have 7 miles of room
this pass rush has been so so bad this game. their offensive line has somehow been worse than ours this season and we still can't get any good pressure
Is it too much to ask for both sides of the ball to play well
"I love the man defense, I do, I like it’s accountability, but teams are roasting us in it because of the cushion Peters gives. It’s not a dig at Peters, but we need to adjust to cover that problem."
Okay was it man or zone if its man its averett if zone it's someone else
Every pass is a first down. Play closer holy fuck
McPhee has been great tho
STOP SENDING SAFETY BLITZES
"Peters almost let Pollard go to get the first down it looked like there, or it looked a lot closer from that camera angle"
"Holy fuck just please blitz peters, he sucks in pass coverage rn"
"Seems like our defense is just pushing guys and they stay on their feet, what happened to tackling?"
We can't  run over the cowboys OL  who full of Janitors and  shitty club bouncers
Need man press coverage these soft coverages don’t work
What's up with our defense??? Why is it so trash???!!
LOL holy fucking shit
Two minute drill- let’s get some points
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOL
Should have gotten some royal farms chicken
2 minute offense let's go
Is skura benched? I thought he got switched to tackle?
WTF is this game!?
Does anyone know the name of the song that just took us to break? The guitar sounded great.
Lol what the fuck
I need a big gain 1st play please
PI
Lol why tackle him he cant catch and stfu aikman
"Terrible call but hey, we got one"
Bro I remember like Wilson from hard knocks hahaha I gotta love him rn tho
Hair goals!
Lmao wtf was Lamar even doing there
That isnt catchable it really isnt
man got MUGGED
These announcers lol
JK footwork and vision is amazing
"That ball was almost uncatchable.  

Holy fuck Dobbins is fast."
Lol sitting there like they didn't do it
DOOOOOOOOOOBBBBBBBBINS!!!!
Give to dobbins. Repeat.
LET THE DOBBY LOOSE
desperate ass PI
Dobbins wtf get to the bench bro
So what did I miss with Buck and Tucker’s miss? Just tuned in
Hell of a run make another tk’d happen I know you can do it
that speed holy hell
Jesus what a throw again....
Dobbins is low key our best weapon.
DOBBY
Dobbins has speeeed
That was the first PI call that went our way this year
hell yeah dobbins
That play should have been a pass
Troy aikman and shitting on the cowboys name a more iconic duo
Wow Hollywood got him one
Every fucking game
smh
Does Harbaugh know what a legal formation is??
There's my Tucker!
Tucker back on track
Love the Grateful Dead outros!!
"Just lol... 

w/e."
F I R E D
Whats up with all the dead & phish?
"Well we actually aren’t playing that bad, and I know it’s Dallas. But damn I’m kinda impressed....."
Just one game without 1 illegal formation penalty. Just once please!
"We can't really hang out with real friends either, miller"
Watching the twitch stream. Is it just me or does the stream die every time it comes back from commercials?
Couldn’t make that call on the big return??
idk what just happened but i'll take it
I haven’t paid much attention to him (which is a great thing) but Harris has been great so far.
i thought they were going to call that foul on us for the tackle lmao
Lamar lookin like Darth Vader with that big coat on the sidelines
We better not give them 3
Swiss fucking cheese
"So this means Roman will now just bench Dobbins for the second half right? I mean who actually wants to win games, that sounds risky... /s"
Great tackle
"They're gonna get three here, arent they?"
FUCKING COME ON DEFENSE
Where the flag for the block in the back wtf who else saw that the right o line is doing some fucked shit
👀👀👀
bowser getting steamrolled into the ground back-to-back
"Hahaha, this really is funny when it happens to the other team."
What is Elliott doing??
Deshon Elliott is still a liability in coverage!
LOLOLOLOL
"Wowwwwwwwwwwww

We are getting soooo lucky. Defense getting bailed out.

Tipped pick. Uncalled DPI. Lamb slipping. Zurlein missing FG."
We better not give up the hail mary here
Aside from all the slop we’re playing a good game but we gotta pull away
"I think our Wrs are fine, but I wonder is it more David Culley, our passing coordinator than Greg Roman, is he the one that designs the pass plays? & wasnt he the one responsible for that 1 year that no Wrs on the chiefs scored a touchdown?"
Joe could throw a 20 yard out route on a dime but couldn’t throw that screen like that lmao
Holy shot can we please rush it
LOL
"Since that was Boykin, we will excuse him. Had that been Brown... Fire him on the spot."
If we’re gonna throw when we shouldn’t be can it at least be play action? Ffs Roman
"I get the “run the ball” sentiment. But if we can’t even complete two passes for 6 yards, what’s the point?"
"Yikes. Horrible throw from Lamar, but uh, why are we passing? 

How often does Greg Roman need to be reminded that he’s in charge of the 3rd ranked rushing offense playing the 32ND RUSHING DEFENSE."
Lol this team can't set an edge to save its life
All of the star players in the NFL’s commercials have the nerdiest voices lol
I drank a whole cup of coffee on that down
"FFS, dude basically had time to take a nap in the pocket"
Lmao 3 clear holds I get missing one even 2 but 3?
Wtf is yannick doing
no pressure again
My entire life is a lie about what is actually a first down
I’m getting bored - can we get another turnover?
can we PLEASE cover the receivers??? Dalton's got all day cuz the blitz isn't working
Here comes the D forgetting to tackle and not playing with heart. Happens every week
where is yannick ngakoue?
"I just want one game where we play a complete game. Feels lien when the offense shows, the d is gone, and vice versa."
This pass rush is awful
campbell wtf
We really need to be dominating the LOS the skill position players they have are among the best
LOL
Need some rofo coffee?
Bum ass
Lol Dalton with the Moon ball attempt
Got that Buck Luck
Jay Glaz*er*  face
Fuck everything
well this drive is over already
Oof
Ricard took a hard helmet to helmet and fell after the play....did not look good
Why did he keep that? Dobbins had daylight
Nice lemar
First down steelers
Thank you!!!
What happened to Ricard? Stepped away for a second
I don't think we've run a single play action play since it opened up a long touchdown for Boykin. That's malpractice.
Time to bench dobbins ffs Roman you’re such a clown
Dobbins all day
Roman in the game thread confirmed
Ingram would have gotten 1 or 2 yards on that
Dobbins balance is amazing
DOBBINS = WIN
This is like the Dean Pees defense.  Under utilized and horribly schemed
Wtf
How Dominate the Cowboys: Spam Jk and Gus.
Jesus fucking Christ dude
Annd fucking self destruction
Fucking hell lol
God damn it Justice
Gotta go to work
Bad throw and hesitation
"Why is justice hill playing so much? Gus and dobbins are both beasts, we should be playing them as much as possible"
Lamar waiting for the Lb To move and he didn't then threw it behind. Thats not great
Why does lamar hesitate? It's like he has been taught to not trust his instincts
thank god for lamar. He's SO FAST
It’s still weird watching games with no fans lol
Our entire offence just relies on Lamar being a better athlete than everyone else. Imagine what he could do with coaching and a modern day passing scheme lol
Damn lol
"In Madden, this would be referred to as a ""QB Draw Cheeser"""
At this point we should just borrow the navy playbook. We have a great running game and a great running QB but we can’t throw
Yeah he missed Hollywood but it also was a bad read on the play because once he doesn't throw to Brown right away he's supposed to go to his next guy Boykin who was more open
Throwing optional
There we fucking go
Damn that boy is fast
AHH FUCK YES
Dime
What a theow
THE REAL SOULJAH BOY!!!!
BIIIIG PLAY!!!! 💜🖤💜
Good thing we’re playing the cowboys lmao
Everyone been slipping on the grass tonight
bruh that returner almost fucked his blocker's ankle
What is up with our substitutions?
Yannick can’t get one sack against this beat up o line?
He leaped out like spiderman and got ragdolled
Wide fucking open.
Why tf are they giving the receivers so much room?
stop fucking blitzing holy shit
Sheesh
You'd think if we were gonna get no pressure we would at least cover
"Andy Dalton actually looks pretty good. I mean that as both a compliment to him, and disrespect to our D."
Averette got worked man
We're never going to get another sack the rest of the season are we?
Why do we insist on sending the fucking house every play? Leaving our corners out to dry tonight
"Just overall terrible refs this year, I wonder why, how does the training program in the NFL work?"
"Offence: hey we got a lead!
Defence: it’s the 4th quarter, time to take that away"
I'm just hoping for a Zeke fumble on this drive
"Board really screwed up there, biting towards the sideline."
Fort gotta secure that
no business getting that first
Here we go
any injury updates?
What was that song?
"Defense has no excuses today, offense ran for 200 yards. They had plenty of rest"
Finally a sack!
TOOK LONG ENOUGH YAHEA BOY
YES
YES
Finally.
A sack??? What’s that?
Ohhhhh Holy-Ward
Their kicker is some ass
McCarthy is just a shitty coach lol. How do you keep sending Zuerlin out like that?
Heh
Lul
"Actual coverage by the DBs leads to a sack, who would have thunk"
McCarthy gonna have an aneurysm with all these missed FGs
Zuerlein lmaoooooo
Zuerlolien
Cowboys kicker needs to be fired!!!!! Lolololol
I feel bad for greg the leg
Damn
Run the ball with every back we got
WTF is going on???
"Damn, their kicker is going to have nightmares about this field"
"Y’all the cowboys defense is 9th with dalton. McCarthy is still decent as an offensive mind, we’re not getting sacks cause McCartney is good enough at offense to take advantage of that in the past game. That’s fine, matchups happen. Everything else he’s been awful at cause we’re sweet"
Great stop D. Now let's put this game out of reach
Damn nice hit lol
He needed a spanking lol
OK PAT
weird ass kick
God damn
Buss it
That’s a big boi
🚌
GUS BUS
I thought Zurelein was good? I mean I don’t mind the misses but 3 misses is surprising
I get so hard for some good FB play
GOD DAMN
Damn Edwards
Woods went horizontal lmao
Another Greg that people are calling for to be fired.
Can we trade Zureline 2 misses to erase JTs miss and pretend neither has happened
Legatron is batting 0.250 on FGs tonight
**NOW THATS A GROWN MAN**
How TF did Lamar get all the way down there that fast to celebrate with Gus?
"Kinda tired of these announcers acting like the Cowboys even want to be in the playoffs. It’s a wash for them, it’s fine. What can you do when Dak goes down."
Needs to be 60 40 dobbins gus
Edwards lookin shifty this game lmao
Just put Gus in the Ring of Honor honestly
GUS BUS
I love how Gus cuts
That cut!
Wasn’t a hard hit but i’d still prefer if he didn’t take those
Oof
"What was that play call  
Has Roman ever heard of a dive"
"#G U S

#B U S"
Hammer it up the gut young fella!
3rd and 3. Why are you throwing?
Edwards and Dobbins are 1 and 1A
Did we sign Ingrahm's nephew or something? who the fuck was that?
"""LET'S FUCKING GO"""
Gonna be trace time soon
He was trying to shade Boykin away from that safety
Chalkdust Torture
Lamar should’ve thrown that td..
These routes are cancer.
So we rest Lamar now? Next week we definitely have to choose our poison. Baker played great on Sunday y’all think he can replicate?
THROW IT ON A DIME TIME????????????????
It’s a pretty wild week in football when *I’m* in the GDT defending Lamar
That's a tough catch and throw to make
Pressure!
Averett sucks when playing teams based in Texas.
First 0_0
Just need 50 more rushing yards for 300
Can we not....
fuuuuuuuk
Ah fuck
Ahh dammit...
Pls no
Not Fruit Punch
more injuries....
Please :(
I wish our offense could run combacks and out routes
We’ve won... but at what cost
fuck. pls not Marlo
Hump seems Fine
"Tackling drills all week in practice, chubb and hunt will chew us the fuck up with these arm tackles"
"Averett 

Again"
Averett again
Tackling meeds work. Too many missed tackles
"So if I was playing the Ravens i’d just spin my way to the end zone, doesn’t seem to difficult"
what the hell was Bowser doing?
COME ON DEFENSE. FUCKKK
Why is our defense playing like crap
"I never see commercials unless it's football season.   Damn, TV looks awful."
WTF DEFENSE. WTF REFS.
Zeke is good at football
"Wow, some garbage tackling there."
"The day the ravens start being able to finish tackles, we’re gonna start winning some games"
Bad tackling has been an issue.
Ravens never get holds.
Clear hold
ANOTHER HOLD HES FUCKIN CHOKING FORT
That wasn't hands to the face/facemask on Fort? WTF
Clear hold AGAIN
What the fuck man
"Goddamn we haven't been able to tackle in the 4th quarter for like 6 straight games now, what the fuck is wrong with this defense?  Every week people come at me when ask this same question, the answer is ""they're exhausted because the offense sucks"".  I mean, maybe the offense has largely been underwhelming, but it's still an inexcusably bad job of tackling."
THATS AN ILLEGAL SHIFT. THEY HAD TWO GUYS MOVE AND DIDNT GET SET
The hold
"I know averette has had a rough night, but who would you rather have. Him or bonds?"
Averett might need to miss time again lol
RESPECT FOR THE EFFORT FORT
I love our 4th quarter defence. Soft as fuck and play with no heart
Averett saves the day.
so many fucking holds
Me too troy me too
"Facemask on Fort and no call, great."
Is Dalton just throwing to whomever Averett is on?
You guys calling out Averett lol who do you want in? Someone from the XFL?
Fucking challenge something harbs the fuck
"Lmao, you can't play defense anymore man"
That was an INT!
Weak call
AA for the save
People can dog Lamar for missing a few throws all you want but defence has been holding us down big time tonight.
SOFTTTT
That was a great play by Averett
"Bend, don't break!!"
Yannick did very well hitting Zeke
Ball dont fucking lie.
Jesus christ man
Welp :(
Peters got ghosted
Good D Peters 😂
Dammit peters wtf
"Without that ultra soft holding we wouldve already been off the field, gotta love it"
Peters got toasted
And then our weak ass secondary give up the TD
How do you get so wide open in the damn endzone? There isn’t a whole lot of room!
Peters got shook lol
Free
We playing like the game is over wtf
Keep the phish outros coming. I feel like a Llama encore after this drive⭕️⭕️⭕️
This defence has been off tonight but Reminder that was the first full drive of the game by the cowboys. A fumble for 3 and a long return set up for the other 7
"how do you hum ""belee dat"""
I knew when dalton was gonna pass it was gonna be a TD. Pur secondary has been terrible
Lol
Clearly our ball lol
Huh? Lol
Run the clock and kick a Fg
Time for a ride on the bus baby
This is just another one of those games against an awful team that should've been a blowout
are the cowboys high wtf?
"Alright, we cant do shit about that pick, can we move on please."
"These refs have been the absolute worst tonight.  On that last drive alone there were multiple holding calls they should have and didn't call, they gave them a first down on an awful spot, they didn't call the INT, it was just atrocious.  That was an INT.  But on the 4th down TD, there was (for the 20th time tonight, no joke) holding, that they again didn't call."
Rare bad decision on the keep
Yo why the fuck is GR calling plays where Lamar is running right now? Greg you stupid fucking idiot let the RB's run and waste time don't risk our god damn QB.
Stop getting cute and just run up the gut
I really want them to take out Lamar and put in Trace to ice the game. Can’t risk any injuries in garbage minutes
Just run up the middle. Its like we want them to get the ball back
"The Giants defense is legit as hell, good thing they have no offense at all"
"Dallas has an extremely slow front 7.

Shocking tbh."
great job gus edwards
If we lose to Colt McCoy in a couple weeks I'm done lmao
Gus is built different
"thank goodness we won this one. we need marcus peters to play better, more pressure from our front 7, and to RUN THE BALL ON OFFENSE FROM THE START instead of trying these gimmick passing offenses for the entire 1st quarter

season isnt over :)"
GUS BUSSSS
I fucking love our RBs and I love our backup O-line
Stop running Lamar
The wheels on the Gus Bus go round and round
That stretch run has killed the cowboys all game.
Gus is having himself a grand ole day
Double’m up!!
EASY MONEY
EAZY MONEY
Do they have extra flags for special teams tonight the shitz getting Wild
Maybe Michael Irvin will give the Boys bench the emotional support dog
Sidelines are always open
Good guys win tonight.
Averett is such ass
Oh Averett
POG POG pog
Is Lamars mask upside down?
NO STOP THE HUGGING
sooo glad brandon scott won and not gift card sheila
"So he scores a touchdown and he the best in the legue makes a bad play and he sucks make up ur mind ppl!!!!

Seriously tho, lamar is a good qb and we need to stick with him good and bad moments."
"This sub: RUN THE MOTHERFUCKING BALL YOU MORONS!!!


/runs for a 1 yard gain into the line 

WHY ARE YOU RUNNING THE BALL?!?!"
"lmao, thinking about when people were like: ""harbaugh coached teams get better in November/December"""
How did he win MVP when he can’t throw the ball?
"He's gonna make it anyway, can we save the theatrics lol




WOW"
Lamar looking really fucking good tonight. I’ve been hard on him all year but he’s definitely looking MVP form tonight
We need a solid defensive back so bad
We don’t deserve playoffs....we’ll just get carved up by any team we’ll face.
They are abusing Averret like my dad abuses me /s
So Lamar scores 1 TD and has another 37 Yard Td pass and y’all want his head for a bad pass that luckily didn’t get picked? Y’all turn on this man quick
Bad throw. Felt like he couldve ran
Yall are hilarious saying cut all these players and the 1st quarter hasn't even ended yet
Y’all are fucking blind if you think anyone was catching that ball. That was a piss poor fucking throw that’s not even debatable lmaoo.
Here goes dalton for 7 before half time
"I get it the Ingram had a couple of off games but you motherfukers are crazy saying he shouldn't even have a job anymore seriously take a step back and think about what you do for a living and how that gives you any qualifications to be calling football plays or signing contracts for players seriously what the fuck is wrong with you guys


Edit and I'm not saying he's playing well I'm just saying you guys are fucking ridiculous"
"Marquise “Breshard Perriman” Brown.... can’t catch a 10 yard out, but pulls that shit in"
Peters has looked very ehh to me most of this season. Hope he can pick things up.
Wow Averett really is some burnt chicken. For a 4th -5th string cb you don’t expect much but it seems like he’s getting beat every snap he plays
Day what you want but I feel so lucky to be alive to witness Patrick Mahomes play football. Goddamn.
There’s no way they can play this now right?
Is Lamar playing tonight?
Shit defense is already looking bad
We're not winning this game if we can't tackle again
lol I'm not worried at this point but I'd honestly rather play vs Prescott than Dalton
Tackling is not looking good so far..
Roman is so ass man
catch the ball ya dingus
He went down so easy after that interception. Brown is such a pussy
Why are we passing so much against the worst run d in the league? Our scripted plays are shit. Why isn't dobbins in on the scripted plays.  Dobbins and gus that's the focus. Fire roman
"Dez wanted so badly to get back and play. You test positive and you sit out for 10 days and you come back to play if you wanted it so badly.

Sit there and fuck off then. Sounds like you didn't want shit but a paycheck."
"That was excellently designed by Roman, nice blocking scheme"
FYI this game is being streamed on Twitch if you want a better quality stream and less lag time
Just gonna ignore that offensive holding again... 🤷‍♀️
Jesus marlo is about as inconsistent as fucking lattimore
Marlo wtf
Please never let Ingram touch the ball again I don’t care dudes washed it’s football he can dance and cheer on the sideline
Pound the rock now because we know Greg will pot a stop to that in the 2nd half
"Ok, Ingram got them wheels"
Me waiting for roman to bench dobbins
Roman will run the ball chill yal. Roman deserves some hate but he is still partially responsible for the best offense we have ever had and the best running offense EVER.
I feel like planned Lamar runs never work. They have to be spontaneous.
WTF was that 3rd down? Was Hill the primary receiver?
freakin a man quit jinxing us
Joe buck rides Troy’s dick every night
That honestly looked good to me
Just had to pop in to say lmao what an announcers' jinx
Joe Buck is and always has been a sub par announcer.
I watch football to take a break from the stressful work life. This team makes me wanna die
Tucker gonna lose his title to Younghoe Koo.
John is losing this team right in front of our eyes
"Hahaha, THIS IS THE SAME OLD RAVENS. Wow, just wow. Play calling is the same, Lamar has some off throws, run game is working, but then again this is Cowgirls... It's starting to look real bad. Brownies are gonna kick our butt."
"Some of you are fucking retarded? 


Could it be that he missed because he had to kick two field goals in less than a minute, one 5 yards more than the other? No, it's the guys in the booth"
LaMaR CaNt ThRoW
"So two of the most bashed player, Queen and Boykin, just came up big lol"
I like Deshon a lot but he needs to learn how to tackle
"I must be the only one on here who rates Joe Buck and Troy Aikman, although it may just be because we pretty much never get Fox commentators for our games. It's a nice change from the usual CBS suspects."
"Seriously, Brown is not good."
Lol 161 yard rushing is more than some team have had in a game all year and people STILL complain. Madness
was that Decosta on the field?
Such a change to see opposing penalties and I’m so here for it
These commentators love giving sloppy toppy to the cowboys
Mccarthy very dumb
"Fundamentally this team is so flawed I don’t know where to start lol. The poor tackling, constant illegal formations, false starts, dropping easy passes"
"I think it was the right move to risk a holding call or PI to save the TD, but it shoulda been called."
"We need Yanda to come out of retirement and go back to 3 TE sets. I love Dobbins but, man.... why would you throw out a winning formula that allowed us to have a HISTORIC record-breaking year and made Lamar MVP????"
#YALL THIRSTY
"Fuck, Duvernay, had some space, gotta accelerate quicker"
Boykin is clearly tired of playing in the NFL
Where's Urban to talk to him about his throwing technique
"As an outsider, can someone tell me what changed with the Ravens this year vs last?"
I was on a work call the past hour. What'd I miss?
I don’t want to pay yannick or judon. They both suck.
"Why are we always in the pistol?  I miss play action instead of this option shit
all the time"
Wide open
"You don't gotta be a Lamar hater or a doubter to know that he's not a good thrower this year. Pedestrian at best. For every 1 good throw this year, he throws about 8 very bad ones. 

Yeah I know he's reigning MVP but that was based on last year. 

Something is very mentally blocking him."
He started to come then he pulled out
At what point will these coaches realize they throw at Averett every play.
Not a fan of deshon elliott
Why is Dez Bryant saying he’s going to quit?
We really need to draft a new cb
Peters got burnt but... WOW what a catch
Peters sucks. At least for what he is being paid. The guy can’t tackle and can’t even guard right. What a disappointment.
"Man I do not think that's a pick, I don't think he got control before his leg goes out of bounds"
They can't even put on masks right
Is it shitty to breakup with someone a week before their birthday?
Fuuuuck you Joe Buck. Fuuuuuck you Chris Collinsworth. Suck it you cowboy cuck little bitches
And now we have to watch Lamar throw another pass again🤮
[deleted]
You guys are way too afraid to criticize Lamar. That throw was up and away. Even Joe Buck said it.
"Bad play for the ""I HATE DOOM AND GLOOMERS UGH"" crowd."
Hollywood Brown isn’t good. A receiver that’s 5’9 isn’t a #1 guy that’s a slot receiver. And speedy receivers are only good for going deep and if his QB cant hit him that deep then he’s useless and I’m sorry Lamar sucks at throwing deep unless it’s against garbage teams
You guys gonna bitch about how much refs hate the ravens now?
I’m glad they didn’t look hard at that TD because I’m not entirely sure that ball didn’t touch the ground when he landed.
Wasn’t Hollywood’s fault. Bad throw
Why couldn’t the ravens draft lamb
#WHY ARE WE PASSING THE BALL
for a 6'6 guy it barely went over his hand there.  if he jumped he might have had a chance.
Still don't like 15.
"Some of Lamar's misses I literally do not understand.

I'm sorry, but even a college QB would not have thrown that pass INTO THE DIRT. What in the world is going on with him?"
This team ain't winning a playoff game if Lamar continues to play like this. This is not a sustainable run-pass ratio.
Elliot has regressed twice as much as than Lamar this year
Hate to say it but our secondary has been really bad for several games. No one is ever in a position to make a play on the ball.
A quality receiver would have pulled that one in.
Lamar has been bad this game
Lamar is just a better running version of Tim Tebow....
"If any other QB had passing stats as horrendous as Lamar this season, they'd be flamed the fuck out of. Why do we keep giving Lamar outs?"
Me after 3 minutes: WE ARE WHO WE THOUGHT WE WERE
Lol get ready y’all. Pass calls from here on out from our main man GR 🙃
the announcers man
Fucking aikman
Roughing the passer
"Man, the key board warriors are out tonight!"
Roman is the only coordinator in the history of the Nfl that's directly responsible for every missed throw and bad decision that his QB makes.
Lamar can’t throw wtf. Now the 4th string RB gets a penalty
Some of you guys are insane. You can not blame Greg Roman when the WR was wide open in the end zone.
Marlon is a beast
Idk if he had control with both legs in
Punk ass weak defense
Wonder if Dalton is gonna get killed for that bad throw 🤔
Effort. Our team lacks it. Loads of talent. No effort.
"It was ONE pass  
You guys are as bad as the announcers"
"That was a bad throw, y'all really never give it a fuckin break. Take off the purple goggles"
Boykin looked like he dives and gets that???
4th quarter defensive breakdown incoming...
Man I know it’s going to be unpopular to say in this thread on this sub on this night but I legitimately like Baker I wish he wasn’t on the Browns
"We need to cut: hollywood, Ingram, and Greg Roman.

We need to shop: Peters, and maybe Clark just to see what we can get."
Patrick Queen is such garbage. I know I’ll get downvoted for this
It’s trace time?
Holy shit there’s no such thing as jinxing shut up lol
Lol this sub saying marlo is a top corner is laughable hes just physical. He has a big DPI every game. I get downvoted everytime I say it. I'm downvoted but top corners dont get targeted.
That is the first bad throw of Lamar's game. Cut him some slack
Browns going to embarrass us next week. This team just isn’t it this year.
"I will say this the moment special teams starts to goof is the moment where I move on from Harbaugh, thats his niche and they're giving up big returns only hell knows what else is going on."
[deleted]
Why do we have 4 RBs active when Dez has shown to be productive lol.
"WOW

Take Notes Hollywood"
"Our season is fucking over. There are so many people I blame, but Greg Roman is a good start.

And also Hollywood. Can we stop drafting fucking rookie WRs and just get veterans?"
"I’m not entirely sure how the upper management works, does DeCosta have the power to fire Harbaugh and Roman with out owners approval?"
"Yeah... if lamar's going to play like this going forward, we can kiss the playoffs goodbye.

Whatever. Going 1 and done again wouldn't have been productive anyways."
WTF DEZ
Is the game not on CBS all access this week..?
"Dont check out Twitter Dez fans. 


He just gave the middle finger to the Ravens and said he quits"
😹😹😹
Shouldn't have thrown that.
Our O line is not holding up.:(
And that's why Dez Bryant spent so long as a free agent.  Mystery solved.
We should literally not throw a single pass all game.
Why the fuck is Marlon in zone wtf.
It looked like #40 completely gave up his lane.
its gonna be one of those games boys
Hey look at that. Out of the back of the end zone. Tucker just needs to do that. I k ow they told him to make it returnable.
"Better not let bad them stay close for too long. We can lose just like the Seahawks, Steelers."
"Pass is.... caught

Exhilarating commentary"
[called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/k9gc3e/1282020_week_13_game_thread_dallas_cowboys_at/gf4f759/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
"It's a missed fg in the 2nd quarter. It sucks, but take deep breath everybody."
Your guys expectations on this team is too high we’re at best going to get bounced in the wild cards lol
"Fucking Zero Pass Rush, terrible"
Why is the defense getting so exposed?
Bad Luck Buck!
How was that not a catch
It wasn’t even catchable
Y U NO RUN?
Averaging 5+ YPC with 4 yards to go and we decide to air it out..
Of course it doesn’t look like a good spot to you Joe
campbell getting worked
i did not realize brown was such a tiny dude.. jesus.. one solid hit from someone and that little man is going to be in a world of hurt.
Are we good again??
These refs are awful on both sides
I feel like this is one of those games that is going to show too much to other teams down the stretch for no reason and bite us in the ass in a game that matters
I’ll forgive it because we’re ahead and it might be rust but if Lamar can make those throws next time that’d be great
NO NO NO NO NO NO
We're so fucked if Marvin is out for any length of time
"Dez tweets ""Yea I’m going to go ahead and call it a quit for the rest of the season... I can’t deal with this"" Then he says ""I'm coming back"" this season or next season is unclear WTF????"
Losing marlon in the fourth quarter of a blowout would be just perfect for this season
Anthony is TRASH
Nasty release
ehh... didn't like that playcall.
Is harbaugh on the hot seat?
Lamar should not keep the ball anymore. Come on man!!!
Our OLine has been way too fucking shit this szn for Brown Jr to be talking shit like that lmao
Mike McCarthy you coward!!
"A free 3 points for the Cowboys because Lamar can't throw, and Hollywood can't catch! So awesome!"
Humphrey contract is starting to look interesting
Be thankful ur playing the Santa Fe school for the blind
Peters went from a great trade last year when we should have won the SB to absolute trash this year and a bad pick up
"Cut Hollywood, Chris Moore, Boykin, Fluker. Let Judon, Bowser, Ellis, Ward, all walk man.

This team has no top end talent and no heart.

we need real players ready to make impacts."
"I thought Harbaugh had a special teams background?

Was Harbaugh not an expert on special teams? 

What happened?

...

What a joke. We get flags, other teams get 50 yard returns."
FUCK THIS KICKER!! GET HIM OFF THE FIELD!! HE IS CLEARLY THE WORST EVER!!
Wasn’t the best throw but that’s WR’s are for bailing out the QB good shit Boykin
"Say what you want, Lamar hasn't look THIS bad in a while. Post COVID games looked rough for Newton and Trevor Lawrence.  I'm concerned if this is normal but these many misses aren't anywhere close to his normal."
"If Lamar throws this ball one more time this game, I quit"
our receivers could at least try to jump for it.
We’re gonna get killed
[removed]
Defence ready to blow this one: another classic ravens loss?
McSorley time !!
Peters is probably a net negative as a player overall
"If legatron hits any FGs we lose this game.  Fuck this team.  Bring on 2021, we won’t beat anybody if we somehow make the playoffs"
Trace
Lol they just said how Hump was amazing player lol. POWNED.
Instead of wasting our picks on yannick we should’ve traded for Jamal adams
this is a super bowl caliber performance
We’re ass
OPI?!?!
Awful call why call a screen when we are gashing the ground game
"No way this is happening. No way we’re this bad, I just can’t believe it. I was so excited for this season :("
That's grounding yo
Lamar out here throwing ducks tonight but also making the plays he needs to. #thatsmyqb
Averett should’ve stayed on IR tbh
Smh “but he wears the green dot!”
Secondary is getting exposed
Secondary is so clueless tonight
Lamar Jackson is a elite running back.
No pressure at all. Yannick is a bum. Nice to see Marlon lay down now that he has that contract.
"Lamar through that pass to Hollywood a bit back, too late.  The AVERAGE nfl qb hits that 85% of the time.  Face it guys, lamar is average at BEST at passing."
Erin Andrews always brings the sexist creep out of me
[deleted]
"Just tuned in. Surprise, surprise... playing like trash.

Lmao at the downvotes. Delusional homers."
"Steelers fan her and I come in peace. Just read through the bleacher report game thread tonight and there are a lot of Lamar haters.  Tell me
Ravens fans why do so many of you hate him??? I would love to have him in my team."
"Dez out for the year.

What. A. Pussy"
Receiver fault
"Over under we'll go three and out with the palys being:

1st down - Pass for 1 yard or incompletion

2nd down - Run Ingram inside or Dobbins outside for 1-2 yards

3rd down - Over throw to open WR after Lamar is flushed from pocket

4th down - Average punt from Sam Koch (because we can't admit he's lost a step a little bit with age)"
two TERRIBLE passes in a row and yep...INT.
[deleted]
Marlon getting called on everything this season. He got away with it a ton last season and it’s catching up to him. He is not lockdown anymore
[removed]
"Is Justin tucker hurt? He can't kick touchbacks and his fgs have looked weak

Edit: there it is I was wrong :)"
We have to use our 3 timeouts here
Hollywood is still not good. I would need to see plays like those consistently to think otherwise
"He’s still only Holly, until he cleans up his otherwise shitty play"
"our OLB Bowser getting lifted off his feet, ugh"
i really want the steelers in the playoffs
[deleted]
Don’t throw Lamar
Bad throw by lamar. But he probably has a little rust
If we win this will it put us on top of the AFCN?
Calais washing up rn
What are these AWFUL crossing routes!!!! Dude I really want us to lose out. No talent on either line or at WR...so maddening
He almost fucking missed that.
These guys are too happy for beating a trash team
Was thrown high but Boykins job with his height is too jump for it
Ok I’m Honestly not trying to be pessimistic but why tf did Boykin look like he was jogging? Is he really just that slow? The man literally never shows any sense of urgency
Andy Dalton is going to beat the ravens lmao
"Dez gets Covid, potentially spreads it to the team and... leaves. Great signing"
Cleveland is going to eat this team and end the season Monday
Who woulda thought that maybe you shouldn’t put a RB at QB 🧐
Hope we blow it whatever it takes to get harbaugh and that fraud qb out
"If he keeps throwing like shit, McSorely needs to go in man"

I really hate this season more than others. What the fuck.
"Prayers up that he has a smooth and quick recovery. 

If we have another outbreak on our hands the season is over."
There's a chance it's a false positive. The rapid tests have been really inaccurate.
This is so disappointing for everyone
Apparently his first test today was inconclusive so they pulled him to test again and it came back positive
"If he was out there warming up w everyone and is positive now, he prob spread it right?"
"Why the hell are we testing players when they’re warming up? How about we do that, I don’t know, a couple hours before the game?"
"Bracing for the ""**Dez Caught it!**"" jokes..."
What a joke.
That's it shut it down play it Saturday night more time for rest
Dufuq kinda shit is the league pulling now?
PAIN
"Wtf is this bullshit

He should have been tested hours before game time 

He got dressed in the locker room and was out warming up 

Our entire team is a close contact now"
"It sucks he got pulled at the last second, but would you rather have him play positive?"
NOOOO
Watch this shit be a false positive.
Worse game for that to happen ffs
I feel really bad for Dez here. He may never get this opportunity again.
Bruh why would they wait until 10 minutes before the game to test him. That’s so odd...
Wait are they even gonna play now
This is some bullshit test him again till we get a negative FUCK IT
Bye
"How is this not rigged? Excuse me if I’m wrong but why would they pull only Dez, 5 minutes into warm ups for a COVID test after he has already been out in the field??? This makes zero sense"
"Game is bigger than you Dez, you're 8th string- completely irrelevant to this matchup. Cry on twitter after the game"
[deleted]
Wtf
Could be a false positive
Jesus christ man
""
"Ah shit, here we go again"
"Once again, we're all wondering if Dez caught it"
He was warming up before the game so who knows how many high risk contacts will not be able to practice this week
""
"WHAT THE FUCK. Dude this season is a disaster and so is our team's response. We deserve to get fined, the fucking team is so lackadaisical in preparation, taking things seriously and staying away from COVID it has no spiraled onto everyone who DID.

This shit is top down. Harbs, EDC and Steve really need to get a handle on these players and this situation altogether.

Hope it's a false positive but jesus man"
Dude what 😭😭😭
Wtf
They’re saying the games gonna get cancelled 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️
And they aren’t running tests on the rest of the team. The NFLPA is so fucking weak man.
"Surely if he was just pulled now, during warmups, a lot of the team are close contact no?"
Week 18?! 😭😭😭

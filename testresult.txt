as a browns fan who is frequently on the browns sub i can say with confidence that youre full of shit as far as the laughing at injuries comment goes when the news broke about dobbins and gus virtually all comments were wishing the ravens luck with their injury situation the one most likely troll comment that was glad about the ravens injuries was heavily downvoted and again remember this is on the browns sub

please throw a 400 yard game lamar i would absolutely love it a great running game is cool too but i would just like to see an absolute air raid on this garbage secondary
2127 280 yards 3 tds 50 rushing yards
one large order of a jackson 5 on the way
for the season i am going to say over 351


view poll
tyson gonna get 1k and get traded to the jets next year
idk why i have a feeling tyson is gonna feast not dobbins levels but i think he can get 650750ish yards as a lead back
definitely responded thinking it was all rbs and then saw lamar on there after the safe bet is lamar at 900 yards
dont forget about trenton the cannon cannon
i realize this is a tyson williams subreddit but yall are sleeping on latavius he gives you everything gus does plus decent hands and proven blocking

its about time hollywood turns into a clone of his cousin lol i see hes steadily packing on muscle
mark andrews with sammy in second assuming hes healthy for all 17 games they attack the area of the field lamar most heavily targets and i consider sammy to be the best of our wrs imo
very difficult question aside from the bottom two options lol because i can see a scenario where its any of the rest
lol my pick is ridiculous but i think bateman can win out theres a true hole in this offense for targets that are wide open for him to take even despite missing 3 games im hopeful he will be our receiving leader and be the true wr1 weve all been dreaming for
its batemans szn
andrews not just because he is lamars favorite target but also historically hes been the healthiest option proceeds to knock on every piece of wood i can find
heart says hollywood brain says mark

charlie wildcard says leveon bell lol
do we root for the bills and chiefs which helps the ravens in the afc north or root for the steelers and browns which help the ravens with the overall afc seedings top seed
if youre not rooting against the steelers then you are most likely an imposter among us
bills and chiefs no question
worrying about seeding in week 1 is silly its a long season always rooting against division rivals
chiefs and bills of course
if you gotta this then youre in the wrong sub
bills and chiefs
is this really a question
bills and chiefs
bills

i like their fans
ill root for chiefs and bills always against division rivals as their losses equal a step ahead towards the playoffs for us in a round about way that said harbs is part of the reid coaching tree and the bills are developing a pretty good footballfan culture up in orchard park
go alex collins
these posts disgust me in what world would you ever cheer for the steelers
bills and chiefs you want the browns and steelers to lose as much as possible
i dont think ive ever seen this question on week 1
lets worry about the division first
browns and steelers for betting purposes
bills and browns why the browns you ask because theyll soften them up for us
steelers and browns we re no rivals to suckers

im really the only one who knows the ravens will score over 41 points monday nightthrowing tds are gana be insane hopefully a jackson 5
ill take the road w at 3117
yes
no jackson five on monday

im surprised daelin hayes was left out

and houston
i think we end up with a bunch of 35 sack guys on the team not sure if a clear front runner jumps out

oweh just isnt a good pass rusher yet as he has a lot of technique to learn bowser is great in coverage so he doesnt rush as much mcphee just lacks the burst to put up big sack numbers at this point ferguson is not a very good player and didnt even dress for games at the end of last year
honestly if preseason goes anything like the regular season itll be ferg and queen competing this year
houston absolutely deserves to be on this list

i hope ravens fans temper expectations for oweh kid has a lot of the physical attributes but hes still raw i think hell be a good player but it might take longer than expected this is not uncommon for pass rushers making the leap to the nfl shit even guys like zadarius smith and matthew judon needed a few seasons to marinate before they really came into their own
oweh
tyus but next year i think itll be oweh
looking at the ravens season ending irs jk dobbins and lj fort are out that should put players who have double initials as first names on high alert but luckily the ravens dont have any more of those on the roster

marcus peters and gus edwards injuries are bad news for players whose first name ends in us tyus bowser ardarius washington and latavius murray might be playing on borrowed time
more accurately its players like tyson williams mark andrews brandon williams tyre phillips brandon stephens as gus and marcus both have first name s as their last name its far worse than you say

congrats

also i respect the upgrade to the gildan softstyle gildan heavy duty feels like youre wearing insulation
congratulations

this reminds me of fun family story my grandfather went to every baltimore colts game from the moment they started to the time they left except for one game because of my uncles wedding

he complained about it to the day he died damn it joe there are 36 sundays a year that dont have a frickin football game
congrats

try to always listen even when you dont want to meaningfully apologize when youre in the wrong avoid going to sleep angry at each other and cherish every moment it aint easy it can be a lot of work and growth at times but its worth it best of luck to you and your spouse and may this be the happiest day of your life
congrats
congratulations enjoy marriage
congrats have an elite wedding

see if you can work in a fuck the steelers into the vows
just remember no matter what happens today you still have monday

congrats
congrats hoping the football gods gift you losses by the browns steelers and bungles on your special day
congrats
congrats but youve been a mr the entire time
i wouldve started looking for replacements for you in your wedding last spring come on man its opening day

its not too late to switch it to tuesday
congrats man rock her world tonight and on the honeymoon
ive met some fans who would love to get married and watch the game at the party
mazel tov to you both
you almost had the official shirt of our rb corps mri mris
todays my birthday and your wedding congrats you two
congratulations thats awesome
congrats fam marriage is awesome you get a life long best friend and nothing beats companionship just remember that when she drives you nuts the good times outnumber the bad times 10 to 1

enjoy
i assume these are sleeveless
congrats
whats worse blown acl before the start of the season or getting married
my thoughts on the udfa rb who is the last man standing from the backs the ravens started camp with he will get the starting job in week 1 and never relinquish it


my projections for williams in 2021
rushing 1300 yards with 1012 tds
receiving 200300 yards 24 tds


bell murray and freeman will all back up tyson and be used situationally all season ravens make the playoffs tyson makes the pro bowl
15001800 total yards and 1216 tds i think your bar might be too low
this is optimistic even with the extra game those numbers are high in the ravens rb rotation model gus over the last three seasons averaged just over 700 yards 5 ypc 135ish carries and 3 tds his last season was 129 of his 194 career receiving yards and 6 of his 10 rushing tds

williams has zero snaps and was on a futures contract he looked good against backups in games that didnt matter im my opinion he still has everything to prove and theres no reason to think hes going to be a stud or better than gus was last season

guess well see soon enough
i think thats definitely possible but gonna be tough given how much we use all our running backs i think williams starts out strong but as others get acclimated to our system he may not get as many snaps

but if he is absolutely balling especially if he has a killer game in week 2 against kc i could totally see him being the 1
like just imagine tyson balls outand we have 3 startingcaliber rbs with him dobbins and gus next year

primetime games are fun but im always sad on sundays when i have to watch other teams all day
now thats a pup
shi tzu
getting ready to watch the steelers and browns lose all is good
already watching the pregame gotta make that beer run though whats everyone drinking

what game are you most excited to watch today



that looks nice
removed
my wifes favorite team patriots is playing today so im going to that game im obviously a huge ravens fan but its gonna be so odd going to a game to a team i hated for years and years

i am so tempted to wear my ravens gear there

just wanted to know for the people that have been there before how is that stadium
hey there

i am also a ravens fan who has been to gillette i went to a ravenspats playoff game awhile back at their stadium its a very nice venue and the shoppingrestuarant complex was also good too

btw at this point wearing ravens gear wont be too big a deal there a few dirty looks and the like are what youll probably get
i have never had a bad time at a live sporting event minus a few bad interactions and every stadium has its charm i am sure it will be a great time sometimes it is fun going to games where the ravens arent playing because you have no stake in it you can just root for a close game and enjoy the atmosphere and get loose have a good time
i brought my steelers friend to the ravens rams game two years ago he wore steelers gear it was annoying af
ive worn my 52 jersey to a couple nonraven nfl games it drew the most attention walking around stadium tofrom seats concessions etc i guess because like social media its easy for a complete stranger to throw a quick verbal jab as they walk by knowing theyll never see the person again

also from 3 different games it seems that the cheaper the seats the more likely fans are to say anything about it and only after a few beers also if theyre winning you should be fine if it starts to be an ugly loss people tend to last out at anything

of course i was also wearing 52 which is a polarizing player for many nonravens fans have fun

i know this is asked a million times but either im dumb or cant find a straight answer lol

my wife is getting me a streaming service for my birthday on wednesday so i can watch live football games on the tv and my phone legally

is fubo worth it can i watch all the games including monday and sunday night with that

or does game pass work im not looking to getting a vpn either

thanks


edit i appreciate all the help guys i think i might just tell my wife that there really isnt a good option for our circumstances and to save the money guess its a life on the salty seas for me

thanks a ton
ive talked about this on this sub with someone else before so ill just copy and paste what i told them


if you live in the baltimore or dc media market you can download the nfl or yahoo sports app theyve been putting the locallybroadcasted games on there for free for a few years now

if not you can use locast a free local television website along with a geolocation changer to trick your computer into thinking you live in baltimore and allowing you to watch the game online completely free and legally

just a fair warning though locast has unskippable ads that play about every 15 minutes so if youre using it to watch football it may unexpectedly interrupt plays to get rid of ads you have to pay a 5 per month subscription to locast since the regular season is only 4 months though this still ends up being an extremely cheap and reliable way to watch the ravens
im pretty sure the only way to be able to watch every game is sunday ticket
i know you said legally but nflbitecom is great no vpn required just gotta get past the pop ups lol i use that for the ravens games

my actual streaming service is sling i use that because its cheaper than cable and i am able to get espn nfl network and redzone
reddit football streams
dazn dazonestupid name is expensive but being able to watch every game and go back to the ones ive missed is super worth it they have redzone and other nfl programming too
hello ravens fans im a casual ravens fan fts that lurks here frequently but an avid fantasy footballer ive got a quick question about what you guys think the ravens gameplan will be tomorrow hope you can oblige

related to the recent running back injuries how do you expect the offense to flow tomorrow will we see the ravens passing a little more than what wed typically expect or will they stay dedicated to the run game with williams and lamar i dont think anyone would dispute that williams will get a rb1 work load but part of me thinks we may see a lot of watkins on monday because of the rb injuries to my knowledge theres nobody behind him that has a full grasp of the playbook so the snaps spelling williams will have to go somewhere
just win baby
i think it was gonna be very lamar 2019esque anyway the raiders d is bad and gus bradley is the cover 3four man rush type they air it out as long as everyone is comfy with it
it comes down to two things

kicking ass and taking names
im no expert but i think its to score more points than the raiders
nice try jon

dangelo hall did it better 2 years ago
im in a 12 man ppr league and im trying to decide who to start at my flex position just wondered what the fanbase thought about who is going to have the bigger game tomorrow go ravens
tyson he will get the bulk of the rb carries this week like hes the only rb that knows the system
id go with tyson i expect him to get 1215 carries and probably around 75 yards im starting him in my league
williams will touch the ball more
holly
williams for week 1 imo
lower floor for williams higher ceiling for brown
do you have options outside of those 2

god damn that stat that commercial dont remind me of jk
lmao thanks chub

if browns win were officially fucked in this division with our injuries
stefanski looks like a pedo
ha the midget baker he is not 110 of the player mahomes is or lamar
chandler jones bout to walk into cardinals front office with a blank check at this point right nowlove to see it against tenn
i understand we all hate the browns but that whole situation was bullshit harrison tripped and then gets pushed by a coach he obviously shouldnt have retaliated but that coach should have at least got ejected as well

ive had success using a vpn to put me in europe than buying the international version of game pass this allows for live streaming games

only catch is making sure the vpn bandwidth is enough to accommodate streaming with out fading out or loosing definition

edit didnt read carefully i use vpn unlimited
nflbitecom will have every stream no vpn necessary the government doesnt have the manpower to go after illegal streamers
hi all question for those of you familiar with kickoff parties for the season ill be attending tomorrow evening before the game then watching from the stadium with some friends and saw locals all time low will be performing how longshort is a set for these events are we looking at something like 34 of the most popular songs or a 910 song show similar to what ed sheeran did thursday

thanks so much
watching the game got a comment
shocker steelers oline is horrible
despite the score the bills line is giving allen tons of time their offense looks improved

pittsburgh looks the same to me so far
both josh and ben looking pretty pedestrian lots of holding calls lots of dropped balls game is still 30
color commentary is pretty weak not a fan of charles davis doesnt really add much besides recap of play by play and speculation nothing technical
forgot how much i enjoy seeing the steelers fuck up josh allen is nice with it
im woefully unimpressed by buffalo cant believe they beat us last year they are entirely 1 dimensional

pittsburgh looks about the same to me have no line whatsoever
i cant tell if the steelers d is doing well or if allen is just shaking off the rust they should be up 240 right now but the dude keeps missing his guys wide open down field
ben looks awful
steelers defensive line is killing the bills ol and the steelers ol sucks both in general this is going to be a low scoring game
not a squeeler fan but their d looks scary
man that bills offensive line is terrible 4 man rush every play crazy pressure every play
my only comment is fuck the bills they played like shit and made some very shit decisions
bens arm seems to be as weak as last year thats good news for us
yeah bills need to stop going for these flashy plays at 3rd and 1 and just focus on getting the first
down
ben looks old
54 total yards for the whole first half makes me smile

fuck the steelers
fuck the steelers
steelers blackout hats look like its a big yellow zero
lol josh allens scrambles are so weak compared to lamar
typical team playing the steelers make stupid decisions and let them back in it is like teams play them to lose
why the fuck you over throwing deep all game when you got this
allen looks like dirt need to give him that same energy they give lamar when he struggles
najee harris is really proving pff wrong when they ranked him 20th coming into this year
bills need to quit screwing around and put this game away vikings letting bungles run all over them we dont need pit and cin both starting out 10
are the bills going to blow this game
allen gonna get hurt running like that all game s
im not going another year with pitt winning games like this
bills o line is struggling against pittsburgh steelers d tough or bills line sus
wow

who could have guessed the steelers offense would be shit with no line and ben returning
someone get that clip of juju getting fucking destroyed
plays like that make me appreciate johns ability to draw up trick plays
bills lost right there
i hate watching the steelers play because its literally just ben trying to play hero ball
ben isnt very nimble
heeeeey theres eric ebutterfingers i didnt think he was still there
josh allen is playing like hes been reading all the stories about his big arm hes trying to constantly showcase it
i cant get into this game im not seeing anything spectacular besides juju getting blown up
bills better put it together i have them in my suicide pool
fuck the bills and their fans
huge play by that juiced up watt brother
wow what a catch by claypool
wow washington really is where qbs go to die
they should feed najee boy is gonna be depressed if ben keeps trying to air it out all the time

i was just told by the giants that i have to be in stadium and connected to their wifi in order to enjoy this benefit i cannot imagine how it is a benefit if i am there in the stadium to watch a live game

i could have swore when the team started we had three mascots edgar allen and poe im i misremembering like this is some mandela effect or did that really happen

lfg

sick
where do i send all of my money pls
ive heard of people not washing their lucky jerseys but you definitely shouldnt put that in the wash haha
u made this yourself

it isnt for everyone targeted more at instagram fans but that is fine no one has to watch it i am glad they have it though my wife likes it and it keeps her in the loop
sorry i actually love that young lady who runs the show her name escapes me
yes
honestly dont like the lets gooooooooo pretty annoying

welcome back and fuck the steelers
just go watch the ravens 2019 highlights and you will be caught up
lamar jackson
whyd you switch to soccer

guy has terrible luck poor guy never gets calls haha but he is a solid starter
tyrod and mark out there
ravens and hokie fans rejoice
always a raven

guys killing it out there 757 represent
he looks fantastic
mark ingram also had a fantastic game obviously the texans aint winning a ring but i really want him to get to 10k yds before his career is done
proof that you dont even need healthy lungs to own the jags
yessirrr
i would say he got em got em good
lol just realized you posted this congrats on the banger lauren

titan up lol

clearly julio chose the wrong team
getting crushed
yes

go coach a game
obligatory fuck the titans thread
you watch this version of them and you wonder how they manage to cause us so much trouble
titans are horrible the texans look like the best team in their division rn
marcus peters is proud theyre getting stomped out good and proper chandler jones with a goat esque performance

julio chose the wrong team
chandler jones is their daddy
josh allen mvp candidate lmao
lmfao bills getting stomped unfortunately its the steelers but the bills looking more and more like a fluke team
i could be off but i dont think its just a one week thing they lost their oc didnt they we of all teams know how much that can affect things
unstoppable offense is all they were described in the offseason
i was told they fixed there defense lol
also in other news josh allen overrated af
it was pure gold i wish i could bottle that feeling because holy fuck were they atrocious on every front facet imaginable the oline was laughably bad mind you az defense is much improved this season but stilli literally burst out laughing at some of the lack of heart and hustle from almost every player after the 1st half these guys talk so much have done absolutely nothing in decades

i cant wait to watch them play defense next week lmao russ gonna pick those boys apart on the edge with their 10 yard cushions everytime

titans are ass yall
fuck the titans
the best thing so far today
love to see them lose but im not judging anything based on week 1
hell yes

fuck the steelers
i respect the steelers i feel pity for the bengals and am glad to see their future looking bright fuck the titans fuck the bills fuck the chiefs

edit first and foremost fuck those smug ass browns
i literally cant stand the sight of mike vrabel and we all know he thinks the titans are tougher than the ravens so todays smackdown by the cardinals was my favorite game of the day k
titans are a garbage team and a garbage organization who cares
in other delightful news bakers gonna baker
hopefully they wont even make the playoffs
they looked fucking awful made the cardinals shit d look elite
ha ha the balloon popped pretty quickly eh
this aged nicely
chandler
with what cap lol this isnt madden houston cost 2mil chandler would be multiple picks including a 1st and costs 20 a year
hes balling out because he wants to be paid

literally zero way we get him lmfao
keep your judgement until we see houston and odafe

i feel theyre gonna be a huge part of the d

probably posted in eagles sub about hurts


marcus peters would be proud titans looked fucked up front continue to run it to henry way too much and julio only has 3 catches for 29 yards
hes about to get a massive contract
now if only we can do that
lmao pretty much almost like their ol isnt any good

very nice
its only foolish if it doesnt work
where do you find these
sacrifice them lungs for the greater good


for everyones awareness this is an agreement between pretty much every team sub
cool man way to go
disgusting you never wish injury on anyone
an easier course of action would be to not do into their sub and just ignore any obnoxious fans
im not gonna ignore any of these trolls and idiots coming in our house and say stupid stuff we ravens dont tolerate that nonsense run em up outta here
messaged the mods you dork

fuck the steelers but watching all the allen fanboys get silenced was satisfying
like most teams in the nfl they play the steelers like they wanted to lose bills had some really foolish coaching
this dudes a fucking weirdo go back to your own sub
why is this on the ravens sub lmao
its week 1 not worried bout the steelers theyll eventually collapse and play down to their competition and lose games theyre not supposed to lose big ben played horrible today refs made some questionable ass calls all game long
op with some weird energy posting this here and then linking to it in the steelers subreddit do we live so rent free in your heads bud
why was this linked like our opinions are biased n shit and we got mutual respect but you forget that its the browns we all despise
comments and observations
regardless of afc record implications if the browns win just imagine how insufferable their fanbase is going to be about it theyre already obnoxiously cocky about the hype for this season

i live in oh i wont be able to leave the house
jesus christ the chiefs have the worst defense in the league at the moment
landry is so punchable
stat that commercial with dobbins is going to get depressing after the millionth time its aired by next week
stay classy browns
howd the refs miss harrison shoving the chiefs coach

the chiefs coach should be ejected too for shoving harrison
if the browns win this im going to cry myself to sleep
lol i see aaron rodgers last dance canceled after season premiere
baker moving the ball well apparently
of course kc will shit the bed week one but then come out guns blazing next week
the camera effects are crazy com8ng back from commercial the iso focus with blurred background looks like a video game
maybe the super bowl loser curse is real
catching the dophinspats game looks like a lot of empty seats in foxboro
arrowhead is bumping
stepping on a down player and shoving a coach stay classy cleveland
they should eject the chiefs coach too for pushing the browns player right
note for next weekcover tyreek hill
this just in

the browns still suck
was it really am incredible game for baker sure he was efficient but whats the point of empty yards if you throw 0 tds and pick when the team needs you most
browns gonna brown
browns players being trash already what a horric act by harrison
its all set up for us to lose this week just feels like it
they called that on kansas city
browns looking good for real
chiefs defense playing like swiss cheese rn
sad to see orlando playing for kc
cbs got two good late games fox got trash
baker pounding the field after the pic should be a meme
baker baker turnover maker
great game
orlando brown was a rotating turnstile i know he was going against myles garrett but give me stanley any day of the week
the browns are looking better than we ever have against the chiefs and its cause they have an oc that knows how to call a pass game
props to cleveland oc calling plays that are working
i want the chiefs to win so theyre less vengeful week 2 lol
browns are falling apart gah damn
lol probably still could have gotten it off if he tried too
holy cow browns
this is probably gonna be one of those 5251 games since defense isnt happening for either team especially if the browns are just going to go for 2
browns pass defense and defense overall looks awful
holy crap big pass from mayfield dude was not even covered
i got the over
holy crap if the browns score again before half time did not want to have to sweat them this season maybe theyll turn into old browns in the 2nd half
interesting to see how well we play waller this week cause its a step up next week with kelce do not want kelce to bury us
lol if not only do chiefs come back to win but cover they need a fg
how is ward never getting called for dpi on tyreek
at the end of the day browns be browns
there was some clown last week in a thread i cant find saying tanenhill is elite omg that fucker is stupid
yea typical browns hater talking shit because their brains cant possible entertain the thought that the browns are a top team now probly a pittsburgh ass eater that lives in ohio
the browns arent actually good right
and here come the chiefs uf
good stop by the browns on 3rd and long

no excuse from me bills played like trash the oline got exposed a little bills never could handle physical teams josh was erratic all game
if we somehow lose tomorrow were already going to be getting bashed by everyone but tomorrow josh allen aint going to get bashed everyones going to say its only week 1 smh
i moved from bmore back to my high school town in billsmafia territory everyone i work with is a bills fan they all know im a ravens fan debating how to play this tomrw when we havent played yet all this hype over josh really irks me i think lamar is better ill just wear my lamar jersey tomrw abs not day a word
i do agree lamar gets treated way more harshly than josh but i just wish this example could be with a different qb

i like josh and the bills too much
its just weird how lamar jackson is treated like a fluke and josh allen is treated like the next elite quarterback neither player deserves that treatment
honestly who gives a shit
it should be less about josh than it is the media
hes joe 20

and just so were clear ive always been a huge joe flacco support

hes better than average
egh no hate for allen or the bills and their fans he deserves the credit he got and hes not responsible for the jerkoffs who hold lamar to higher standards for reasons we all know
if lamar was in his place hed get bashed nonstop despite having an mvp
morons always propping up this kid what has he really done other than throwing the ball in diggs vicinity last year diggs is the buffalo bills he was last year and will be this year too if he regresses allen is back to being a 50 passer
this reaction is embarrassing so sensitive over stupid shit
the media calling that steelers def elite is a fucking stretch the bills gave away that win
i am a lamar fan and have probably been a fan of this team longer than 80 of the people on here but why is it that if you guys dont hear the media praise lamar at least three times a day then you slip into fetal position and forget how to function

nobody can give a good reason for hating josh allen other than the fact that the media speaks highly of him and he gets compared to lamar does everyone forget how much positive attention lamar got in 2019 and 2020 he slipped up a bit in 2020 whereas allen excelled so yeah allen is going to get some attention

havent even played a single regular season game yet and everyone is already crying about lamar not getting any attention
ill give you one its one game lamars had bad games everyone except maybe mahomes has bad games

edit holy shit yall really upset im not getting out my pitchfork

can we stop this chip on our shoulder nonsense every time baker allen or mahomes has a bad game just because the media is unfair on lamar doesnt mean we have to project outrage onto other teams
this is the year the league figures out josh allen

the browns were this good when we played them on monday night they were legit last year too
did anyone not see this coming stefanski is a good coach and the roster is one of the best in paper
browns got that beastly ass offensive line thats why theyre looking so good im scared a little lol
cleveland was a good team last year too they came up short against the chiefs in the playoffs but they smacked the shit out of the steelers theyre definitely a threat in the afc north
that or chiefs pass defense sucks but so far unfortunately the shits look legit and so do the damn bees
this isnt an overreaction at all with all our injuries and them getting healthy theyre probably the best team in the afc north
anyone who thought they wouldnt be good was smoking some purple colored crack
they were due everyone has their time eventually even the browns we just gotta get in the playoffs and anything can happen
if you arent afraid of the browns you havent been paying attention
they are a good team its possible to root against them but also realize they are one of the top teams now i feel like a lot of people are so desperate to say same old browns and make fun of them but thats just setting yourself up for disappointment most likely
if anyone thinks its lolbrowns this year im not sure what team youve been watching the last year theyre gonna be tough to beat this season im worried they might sweep up with the way the schedule is set up
alternatively have you considered this fuck the browns cant wait to see them browns it up and find a way to suck this year
not an overreaction for the steelers or browns offenses look improved and good luck to any team blocking the combinations of clowney and garretwatt and ingram
its been justified for over a year
the steelers and bengals already won and the browns look well on their way two of those wins would come on the road against the two teams everyone has pegged coming out of the afc bills and chiefs absolute nightmare start to the season for baltimore
steelers were 110 last year just sayin
browns are good we cant be holding onto the past no more fellas baker really boutta beat mahomes before lamar wow
this post got kinda funny over the last few minutes
this looked exactly like last years browns to me above average offense when balanced great run game can take the sails out of opponents by burning clock yet give up unconscionable tds in the deep secondary repeatedly and make bonehead penalties and thus consistently play close games

theyre the most volatile team in the league in many ways because theyre good enough to win 80 of the games they walk onto the field for but seem to win about 60 instead
theyll fuck it up they always do
the team i respect the fans act like eddie murphy in trading places but i will forever root against them
thats what happens when you put the ball in bakers hands with the game on the line
ha ha cleveland remains cleveland a cess pool for fans and teams alike
removed

can we not it would be different if they were a rival or a team that didnt absolutely destroy us last season
damn thats cold lol
i get this reference dot jaypeg
probably a good thing we traded him
he was bailed out a lot last year by lamar he allowed a pressure a game on a mobile qb when stanley allowed 1 all season it was a steal of a trade honestly but i love him as a rt and a person so i wish him the best
judon wasnt great today either
lamar helped him so much because you couldnt just pass rush lamar like a normal pass rusher
proof that hes not a fucking left tackle
hes missing assignments and the result is garrett is in the chiefs backfield untouched not a good first half for him
anyone else notice that the broadcast denoted him as a rookie at the start of the game seemed almost like a weird omen haha
damn just hate to see it
hes going against myles garrett lmao
guys i hear ya but its only one game
he just got beat around the edge by garrett
i mean hes coming from a run first offense its gonna take him time to adjust
guys be better appreciate what he did for us no need to shit on him for having a bad game focus more on how awesome our old boys tyrod and ingram looked instead we are better than this
lmao just allowed a key sack he really is ass
yeah but its not like bateman balled out today either
he was always going to be ass protecting on the left side on the right side and as a run blocker for the ravens not so much
he has always had trouble with the speed rush it will be gloria this season with kc who throw a lot
cbs listed him as a rookie in the lineup
oh well so sad im happy with the draft picks
have you heard him rap tho

bills steelers chiefs and browns all look very legit gonna be tough sledding team needs to come together coaching needs to really execute well gonna be very challenging and exciting
hold onto your butts
did you see the bills steelers game

though its unfair to make any real assessments after 1 week
the browns have the best offensive line in the league chubb isnt touched at the los and baker has all day to throw theyre going to be tough to beat
afc has way better teams

all 4 nfc west teams could make the playoffs because as a whole the rest of the nfc sucks outside tb
steelers had some dogshit offense their d saved that game for them completely
bengals play a solid game today as well zach wilson impressed me i think his team really let him down today decent day of football excited to watch matt stafford lead rams
bills didnt look legit today josh allens deep ball accuracy was bad and his downfield balls while in the vicinity of the wrs were poorly placed honestly the chiefs browns and steelers look scary but the bills absolutely do not like a mediocre defense with a mediocre ol and a qb thats seemingly regressed from being elite thats a playoff team given there weapons but its a first round exit
gotta admit chubb and hunt are studs lost count of how many broken tackles you can credit chiefs for bad tackling but great running backs have a knack for causing bad tackles
idk i mean ben looked pretty old today lol
the browns look legit man
bills dont look that legit lmao browns look the most improved and impressive for sure
i expect ben and the steelers to be good early but regress late like they did last year bills should get their shit together they have great players and a great coaching staff browns have a loaded roster but i dont believe baker is an elite qb chiefs are still a heavy favorite imo us colts dolphins and chargers should be teams to watch down the line as well i feel like the titans are going to regress this year with the oc change
steelers are a paper tiger their defense is good but captain fatfuck on offense doesnt worry me bills called an absolutely stupid game chiefs browns yes for sure very worried
idk what bills steelers game you watched they both had glaring weaknesses especially the bills the steelers have an elite defense as we expected but the offense was dogshit the chiefs are the chiefs 3rd quarter explosion and all the browns look really good i think we fit somewhere in with the chiefs and browns assuming injuries dont fuck us over too hard
watch put for chargers as well herbert is scary good
my takeaway was that the bills and steelers offense were booty

start with can tavon young stay healthy
its been so long since hes been healthy i honesty forgot how good he was he def was solid in the slot hasnt had much chance to take a step in being elite he hasnt played in the regular season for like two years now so its hard to tell where hes at right now
imo hes never been healthy long enough to even get a gauge of that tbh
by elite do you mean like a top 5 or 10 cb

if so then no
hes a playmaker without a doubt maybe hes just been lucky but sometimes id rather have someone lucky than good for playing less than 1500 defensive snaps 7 turnovers and 2 tds is elite in my book only problem is staying healthy is a skill and he doesnt have that
yes can be one of the best slot corners
yes but his play style isnt conducive to staying healthy at his size
if tavon can stay healthy i could easily see him as a top 10 cb in the league


i wanna say unbelievable but is it
this is why they are the clowns
yesthis is true lol
browns gonna brown
the brownest punt attempt ive ever seen old school football follies
anyone else hoping for a tie
easy now skeeter we dont ever play too well against kc so lets hold our horses
the browns are legitimately good sucks for them that they couldve beaten the chiefs but im not mad about it
well theyre playing the chiefs and i thought they played a good game and had a shot to win the game i hate them though

how is this a question we need to win the division for the chiefs record to impact us
chiefs 100
rhymes with reefs
well we are in one of the toughest divisions in football that isnt anything close to a guaranteed division title for anyone we need the browns and steelers to lose as much as possible and hopefully we dont look right past them like this post seems to be doing

quietly i cannot express this enough
theyre in a one possession game against the defending afc champs in their house its not like theyre getting blown out by the new york jets id be thrilled if we put up just as good of a fight vs kc next week
i thought cleveland was one mistake away from winning im not laughing im shit scared
tony romo is public enemy 1 on the brown stains board lol
someone in that thread literally compares mahomes to curry and baker to lebron lmaooo
strip club trip with your wifes brother rules look but dont touch
quietly read and dont troll save that fir the warzone that is rnfl
baker baker turnover maker

hey all moved to northern va since last season and looking for a ravens friendly bar i live in the fairfax area if there are any local

thanks in advance
same boat
irelands four courts in arlington i think they have a roost there
how bout them browns is brown a verb
theres no moral victories in football you win or you lose dont know how these clowns can be happy losing i would have been furious how do you blow a 10 pt lead with all the momentum in the world
browns gonna brown
its really amazing to me that they lost the chiefs had no answers for their offense in the 1st half it really seemed like the browns would score a td on every drive

reminds me of our playoff loss to the pats when we had a 2 td lead twice just mind blowing
it is an adjective used just before the word poop
personally i kinda think wins are a bad way to evaluate a qb but they do matter to some extent that pick was a bad decision by baker idk if he was trying to throw it to the wr or he was trying to throw it out of bounds he had a solid game overall though mahomes being mahomes and immediately scoring really changed the game
removed
baker gonna baker
baker with a game ending turnover too was just
because weve beaten mahomes so often
baker
eh he didnt fumble that ball or muff the punt

you know odel is ecstatic with that dooky 2nd half
i absolutely lost it when the punter couldnt handle the snap at the end of the game its a classic browns choke job lmao right when that happened i knew the browns were gonna lose
this is what i like to see
but really though that browns offense looks very good went toe to toe with the chiefs
baker throwing a game losing pick
browns lose baker throws a gamesealing pick and edc looking like he fleeced the chiefs after objrs performance cant get better than that
browns did look good until fourth quarter started the sheer willpower of the chiefs not to lose though
i really thought we were looking at both afc championship teams getting beat by afc north opponents but then the browns had to be the browns for the final 5 minutes
chiefs fans here browns fans talk a whole lot of shit for a supposed underdog team with a great fandom shows their character
not gonna lie i was a little worried
meh who cares i dont give a shit about the browns pissed the steelers won lets go win tomorrow
hahaha fuck the brownies
f u c k the shitbrowns
im not a petty person i love the ravens

butfuck the browns haha
i will always celebrate their misery they played a mediocre defense without two of their best players and still lose

choker mayfield
baker choked again brown playing lt looks like shit if the steelers would have lost it would have been a perfect day
brownies blew it ya love to see it
removed
this is better than the titians losing
classic browns
hyped for tomorrows game
browns gonna brown
request for someone to make a looping gif of baker pounding the ground like a temper tantrum after his pick in the 4th quarter
i watched all game knowing that moment was coming and cleveland did not disappoint well not me anyway
i was hoping for a tie because in the record for the playoffs that a half l for both
ha ha
one of the few times i root for the chiefs when they play the browns
removed
browns like choking and baker is bad chubb has to carry their offense
i mean im glad they lost too but really a fucking upvote party for another teams loss this makes us look sad honestly
browns doing browns things
we need to go up by like 40 against mahomes next week
fuck them shitstains
classic baker
you cant shake off the dookie mayfield was extra doo doo with that last throw
yeah but baker mayfield was great until he threw that pick to lose the game s
baker mayfield isnt the goods man if we had one of these teams receiving cores werent crippled we would be unstoppable the afc really is winnable man
im obv happy the browns lost but this doesnt really make our fans look good
the best part of the browns subreddit are the comments like this wasnt a loss bitch if you didnt win you fucking lost 01 my next favourite was well get our revenge game in the playoffs lol the browns wont make the playoffs even in my fantasy league theres one bandwagon browns fan who said they look so good theyre going to win the super bowl flat out said they wont win the game theyll find a way to brown it up
in our shadow forever lol

for all of you guys talking shit about baker he outplayed lamar
this is awesome instant karma
careful talking shit before you even play your game might just bite you in the ass

as much as i hate to see the browns win i was kinda hoping kc would lose we need all the help we can get to win the conference
lol can we not mock the browns for this
we still havent beaten the browns under lamar how can we roast the browns for doing the same thing they put up a good fight and stayed in it till the end
maybe once we beat the chiefs we can say something but until then we really have no right to roast them for it
does our qb miss wide open throws and fumble twice in clutch time

orlando on the ravens orlando on the chiefs
got to say i liked orlando but lamar made him rich dont think for a second he didnt
mahomes is doing orlando no favors by dropping so deep into the pocket its a nightmare scenario especially when youre facing off against an extremely athletic myles garrett
lamar carried this man
theres no way he allowed only 5
the scheme and lamar benefits any olmen who come here
e
d
c
i think orlando will get it going
we should be wishing well for our guys after they leave us except for when theyre playing us
i hope to god that the ravens continue to follow this model

trade guys whose values are inflated due to the systemlike brown unless they are actual elite talents in their own right

retain our own unique players that would be under valued by the rest of the league with mid tier dealsgus boyle ricard etc


for long term planning when they recognize that they have a player that the rest of the league might over pay for they need to invest resources in developing a quality backup

thats how they can continue to build an elite roster even after jackson is off of his rookie contract
orlando isnt a elite left tackle but hes above average left tackle which what makes him elite playing right tackle i dont think hell ever replicate that success he had with the ravens because hes not aware of what he really is
lets not hate on former ravenswishing zeus jr all the success in the world
damn man
hope we can make him work as hard
am i still the only one that thinks they should have traded stanley

edit lamar carried this man has near 50 upvotes but this is getting downvoted like crazy wheres the logic here

id celebrate more if they finished the season this way not after week 1 especially when they barely lost to the defending 2 time afc champs
lets wait on our game before we trash talk
cleveland always finds ways to lose games even with a loaded roster
im not gonna trash talk at all they played really well the only way ill trash talk is if we beat them they look scary
nature is healing
my hatred for the turds aside the hype for them this offseason might be more warranted than the hype before the 2019 season
ya damn straight i love to see it
can we at least please stop the trash talk until 1 we play our first game 2 we play against them all we are doing is giving them ammo in case we lose

all i gotta say is we havent even played a down yet and were talking mad shit lets worry about ourselves for now
id be down for upvote parties when we win a game celebrating the loss of another team against an opponent that we couldnt beat ourselves is just embarrassing
maybe this is an unpopular take but upvote parties in general are dumb im all for celebrating the team we all love but upvote parties are lazy karma farms that add nothing to the conversation upvote parties regarding other teams are even worse
upvote parties are reddit at its worst no i will not help you farm karma because some team lost
if we have to have upvote parties it should be reserved for accomplishments such as making the playoffs winning the division etc doing it for week 1 losses for other teams is incredibly dumb like so dumb that words cant even describe how dumb it is
i think its childish but thats who took over this sub so here we are
i have mixed feelings on one hand its cathartic to celebrate a hated teams loss on the other hand it does make us look lame as shit and its mildly embarassing
its fun when its justified

most of the time i think they are just low effort karma farms

apparently weve moved on from even having upvote parties with a picture as if it wasnt already bad enough
its week 1 i wouldnt be worried about any team other than the weeks opponent
pleasanty surprised the second option had that many votes

im pretty sure this sub talks about other teams more than other of the other subs and its mad cringey its one thing to celebrate and laugh at a rival losing but making an entire thread for it is pathetic

this wouldnt be a problem if this sub had better moderation way too much bullshit posts allowed here
every sub does it i dont care for it but i general it doesnt bother me
its not ok unless that team is named the browns steelers or titans
really couldnt care less what anyone posts its not hard to swipe a finger a centimeter and skip over it also expecting an entire fan base to agree on something is asinine
people who care about how our sub looks are like kids or something its an anonymous online platform who gives a shit give these losers all the ridicule they deserve
if its the steelers or that florida team that the league has the fix in for fair

dude stay humble for just a second the browns punched the chiefs in the mouth if it werent for stupid mistakes they would have won
all this shit talking is gonna come back and bite us tomorrow i believe in karma and the amount of shit this sub is talking before even playing is crazy
bruh they almost won this isnt the flex you thought it was
we all feel some way about the texans im sure but ill always be rooting for those 2 and they came up big today
shoutout to former ravens coach david culley getting his first win as a head coach
texans balled out great job former ravens 10

counterpoint obj isnt a good pass blocking lt

but also agree the garrett is a beast
yeah i was keying in on him honestly i hope he fairs better throughout the season
love obj but he isnt athletic enough to be a dominant pass blocker the way the chiefs need him to be
actually he is a piece of shit who assaulted a player on field but go ahead and forget about that like the browns who thought it made him a walter payton man of the year
hes everywheres on the rams defense
he was really bad last year and was bad for us it was well worth it for us to trade him for peters
oh lort
good to see him putting everything together i got nothing but love for former players i will say i remember that game against the browns where he got shellacked
i would love for him to do well he was all over the place but he wasnt challenged in coverage at all bears passing game was just awful until the game was already out of hand they hardly attempted any throws more than 10 yards downfield
he had a good game but lets not go that far
i know its only the first quarter but hes having a great impact for the rams right now

had the tip that lead to the pick and just recovered a fumble
once a raven you tend to play like a raven till you dont
he played really well tonight


view poll
all of them will happen
lamar becoming the first qb in nfl history to have a rushing td a passing td and a recieving td from huntley on a gadget play on the season opener
i say tyson just as a secret weapon
i dont know about the raiders run d but i know that they have very little footage on the guy

that has to amount to something doesnt it
i predict lamar will have 6 total tds tomorrow guaranteed both passing and rushing
i voted for marlo bc i dont know how bad their run d is off the top of my head
tyson easily dude is gonna go wild on that shit raiders d
i think a ffrecovery for td is more likely for marlo

i forgot that teen titans had the best intro of any 2000s cartoon
its still crazy having a player as box office as lamar on the ravens
i dont remember too much but raven was by far the strongest right very fitting
now i gotta go watch teen titans
robin looks like trae young
umm this video didnt need to go so hard but damn that pumped me up for tonight

removed

i am going to be on a plane from 815 till 1015 flying to atlanta for training
i hope the plane has wifi so i can catch the game on the nfl app or something
get my wife to dvr the game worst case scenario
neat thanks for letting us know
hope youre able to catch the game man

personal news if its not a contact what is it especially on a tuesday
she teased a new podcast coming out about a week or 2 ago im sure its that
big news dropping tuesday ravensflock
interesting i feel like it cant be personnel related lamar extension trade etc or cassie wouldnt have the scoop this far ahead of everyone else
duel reality raven vs duel reality panther fight to the death
god i love her
have they announced the ring of honor inductee for this year yet
suggs retirement
hype videooooooo
its probably a new podcast

id love for it to be that the ravens finally have the rights to use the old winged shield logo
pat mcafee has aaron rodgers tuesdays maybe cassie is getting lamar jackson tuesdays
could it be new uniforms

i thought the league allowed previously banned uniforms to be allowed this year

i hope we get the og ravens uniforms for one of our prime time games
greetings as the title states i am from new zealand ive been following nfl and the ravens since 07 and ive always wondered about how many americans are hungover at work on mondays our sunday games are early monday mornings and throughout the day the ravens game tomorrow is at 1215pm tuesday for me i love watching and getting on the beers when i can so yeah always wondered how productive monday mornings are super jealous of the tailgate parties you guys have as well
im under 21 but that doesnt stop me from getting drunk off kool aid
you in lockdown bro or out of tamaki makaurau

planning to have it on my laptop while i wfh
yea im in the uk currently and the games are at 0115 lol its definitely a bad morning at work

when you need a laughand a midlife crisis
honestly i was more shocked by that ted lasso caterpillar on his face lol
i saw that too and had the exact same reaction i spent several seconds trying to convince myself it was just a lighter shade of red lol
aaron rodgers looks old as fuck too with that beard and the pulled back hair he looks like hes either gone full evil or preparing to start a life as a hermit in the wisconsin back country maybe both

this is cringy af

yep dropping sometime today

e source cassie calvert
god i hope so
i am missing the ravens report too

im an australian but my long distance gf was born in maryland so i am now a new ravens fan am excited for the start of the season any cheers or chants i should be reciting while i watch
i hate night games only because i have to get up early for work
lamar comin
wake up i havent even gone to bed yet

raiders fan hoping for a good game for everyone it should be really fun and its going to be good to see what this defense can do against you guys
hell yeah 215 am here we go european flock
brah im so stoked for this gnarly game brah its gonna be totally rad
almost time for bed here in australia go ravens
caw caw mofos

its 10pm here so i think i dont think ill make it to the game if i wake up now
im in the philippines so its gonna be tomorrow morning for me but im damn excited to share this first game with you guys
lets goooooooooooo
rocking the white threads to work
where are people tailgating in vegas before the game any bars good spots
im about to come off a 12 hour shift can i sleep or must i wake the fuck up
i wonder how much they bring up if at all the ravensraiders afc championship game gruden was the raiders coach and that was 20 years and almost 8 months ago 11401
lets fuckin goooooo
anhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

that is all
toddler woke me up at 457am thank god for ravens game day adrenaline counting on it to carry me through tonight
ive overslept been waiting for this game and im so excited to see this game big truss
fuckkkkkkkkkkkonnnngngnnnnnn lets gooooooooooooooooooo ttttttouchdoowwwwnnnnnnn rrrrravens
cawcaw motherfucker
woke up depressed see this post happy
lets get this bitch
i just woke up im well rested for the game lets go
i got 100 for jackson to throw 2 tds tonight lets go ravens
i moved to baltimore about 4 months ago and love the city ive never really followed the nfl but im looking forward to my first ravens game tonight raven emoji
how are you gents feeling about tyson williams tonight expectations
have they announced what jerseys were wearing
i think i speak for all of us when i say


go big llama
lets gooooo first game ever became a fan over the summer
lets go team
we have been waiting so much for this game ravens football finally this is real
ok ok im up im up do i get coffee now or straight to shotgunning
guys

we get to watch lamar jackson play football again today
anybody got a link to the official roster for tonight want to see who is actually playing what with all the changes
can i just say playing week 1 mnf is absolute torture i have been dying for ravens football since noon yesterday
lfg
i got a bad feeling about this one raiders fans gonna be all hyped up our run game is nonexistent and you never really know which lamar youre going to get i think we lose by a field goal

being a gm must be so fucking stressful at a moments notice your roster can go from being completely set to needing a massive overhaul cool to see the timeline on how it gets done
peters is important but the most important

feels like a bit of an overstatement clark and humphrey id say are both more important pieces possibly brandon williams in the conversation too
whole article is a great read the playbyplay of the deals getting done at lightning speed is amazing few teams could have pulled this off this quickly


allen wasnt even that bad the steelers just have a great defense its getting kind of exhausting to see a player have one mediocre game and the media and everyone say hes been exposed even if that players not a raven
a lot of it was steelers defense but allen made a lot of bad throws without being pressured hes a good qb but yesterday def seemed to back up the allen is inconsistent argument
have a great secondary dont blitz allen boom hes figured out we did the same thing last year and it worked great
as ravens fans we know how annoying this is when it happens to lamar
yea for the most part i think a lot of teams are still rusty a lot of starters didnt get much playing time in preseason and it shows for some teams some teams looked like they were still in preseason week 4 mode now if buffalo still looks as bad as they did yesterday around week 4 or 5then yeathat may mean something
hes not bad for a running back
people saying the steelers figured out josh allen are ignoring the part where josh allen looked terrible he overthrew a bunch of open receivers and was inaccurate on a bunch of 510 yard routes he didnt look good

was that the illusive man

just when i thought mandrews couldnt get hotter
carr looks like such a slappy in that pic
lets roll
ravens football is back and so i will be back with another season of crappy photoshops for each weekly matchup as always if you have any suggestions or requests please let me know lets go ravens
i was waiting for the week 1 hype video from the ravens official accounts before realizing they probably had to completely redo it after heavily featuring gus as a stepup moment
the fact that you were able to fit his chest piece in there lmao well done
andrews we with the flow tho
i missed these so much over the offseason
grudens expression as the ss dude is killing me haha

great work
wow this is awesome nice work
this is hilarious and wonderful
ok thats funny especially harbaugh
we all know gruden loves that damn play a few years ago when he was in the booth his brother had the wft run a fullback pass on 4thandshort against the cowboys he lit up like he was opening a christmas present so im watching for two things tonight

1 when the ravens face 3rdandshort especially inside the 20 i expect to see ricard catch a simple bootleg pass off of playaction thats made to look like power
2 when the raiders face 3rdandshort i expect to see our pass rush let the fb out into the flat and our safeties to come crashing down and maybe even jump the route

no excuse not to be prepared to stop this play and every excuse to have it in the playbook
the ravens knowing about this play would be the perfect reason not to run it which means the ravens wont have to worry about it which means the raiders will definitely run it which means the ravens will be ready

x200b

checkmate gruden
carr just better not throw to the backside venus or gruden may have a stroke on the sideline
richard is on ir itll be the fullback ingold or te2 moreau

4517 ravens
my house cleaner is a raiders fan he just came in talking a lot of shit for a guy who predicted a 137 score
i think its going to be a lot closer than people expect and im kind of worried
i predicted for fantasy purposes the defense to score 12 tucker 10 and andrews 15 so im going 3414
3117 ravens

annoyingly close game and we are sweating at 2417 in the 4th but we march down the field and lock in the w with another td at the end
idk how you guys are saying things like its not close as if were not limping into this game with 4 seasonending injuries a wiped out backfield lol not to mention injuries to watkins bateman

im thinking 2720 ravens i think this will be a close game
4210 is my prediction there secondary is pretty dismal and they dont have any good pass catchers outside of waller there pass rush is decent but its not where it needs to be to be able to hide the trash secondary there ol will be bad because they havent played together much and are very young no icognito will hurt them too so carr wont have much time to throw it could be closer if waller has a dominant performance if tavon doesnt look right although we may not use him for waller maybe we use stephens
idk a lot of people saying blowouts but i am super nervous i think just because its close to kickoff though but idk
i think we blow them out full strength since were not full strength though itll probably be a close game maybe 2724 ravens
miniravens 24 raiders 14 for my oldschool snl fans
not only do i think it will be close it is a must win with kc coming to town next week
my prediction is that the ravens go up big 1720pts but take our foot off the gas and end up winning a closer game 3427
4513 ravens

can i ask how you guys became ravens fans always curious how wayyy outoftowners join the flock
if it werent for the tats i would have thought she was a mannequin lol
youve found a winner there my friend
shes awesome
i know exactly how she feels

i see a good meme template potential here
love that picture on the wall
she is a keeper man
thats a poe tattoo
shes gone hardcore bmore with that poe tat i should ship you some crab cakes to eat while you watch a john waters film
im sorry fam

of course what else would he say these guys are washed up and not good anymore we are very worried
did the ravens already active those guys bell murray and freeman
ok greg but did you even bother with a passing game this year
those pass concepts better not be trash like last year obv we want to see what new receivers can do but what matters more is if theyre used properly
ravens gonna lead the league in rushing still arent we
were really excited

thats the biggest pile of manure ive ever read i can only imagine the sleepless nights roman is having lately lol
well this aged like milk

heeeeap fond memories in this clip

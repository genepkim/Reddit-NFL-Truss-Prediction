this is rravens
i dont see wtf this has to do with this sub
i was looking at the stats and he did not register a tackle
the opposite the coaches are speaking very well of him this year tbf he isnt playing that well but much better than what last year which people just assume
no jimmy smith just took his role on the outside for this past matchup we used jimmy outside a lot this week because he does well against the tall physical receivers cinci has while marlon mainly covered boyd in the slot last week jimmy played a lot of deep safety and vs kc he was matched up against kelce a lot


hes turning into a pure swiss army knife for this defense and its beautiful to watch
says he got 11 snaps 16 but hes played half the special team snaps
calais had 2 tackles but he played a great game

stats arent everything


guy in the replies mad that marlon blocked him for calling him marvin
humphrey was born to be a raven a literal raven
i was expecting her to say he punches sandwiches and shit out of her hand all time lol
thats my favorite
ahhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhhhh marlon humphrey

poor kid reminds me of randy marsh saying i didnt hear no bell every time he takes a snap
dude has a rock for a tricep lol
im a simple man i see big baby and i nut and upvote
burrow im so sorry
i posted a few weeks ago about wanting to pay someone to mail me a ravens scratch off and if possible a ravens bic lighter from a gas station i sent one guy money but they just never showed up i will pay for the stuff from the gas station im just looking for someone to buy me a 10 ravens scratch off ticket unscratched and a ravens lighter always look for them but we only have steelers browns and bengals thank you for taking the time to read this yall are great

thats quite the system theyve got there for wideouts

i dont see them run it much at all anymore any ideas why am i making things up here
they still do lol just last game the ravens put the focus on passing for some reason youll see it more soon
this is what ive been asking the last couple weeks our offense revolved around the read option last year we ran it multiple times a drive and ingram and lamar both excelled at it i dont think we ran it once yesterday and have only run it a few times all year from my recollection definitely nowhere near how much we used it last year

i remember against the rams last year knowing it was going to be a blowout when the read option was working early i knew the bills game would be tough when it wasnt working early

so what has changed they have barely run it all year so it isnt lamar being hurt teams having tape on it doesnt matter because you can know it is coming and cant stop it if the right read is made

only thing left is concern with running lamar so much or i guess the offensive line isnt nearly as good is another possibility its too bad because it is what made our offense what it was last year it opened up everything i also think dobbins would be great at it too
i think lamar is hurt
i blame the hole left by yanda on the oline pass protection has been pathetic this season

dont know why people assume middling receivers would produce the same on our team as they do on other teams were already significantly less pass heavy then most teams and when we do decide to air it out like we did last week lamar targets hollywood and mandrews almost exclusively we have receiving talent that were underutilizing we dont need to act like the grass is greener in carolina of all places
dudes dont get that our recievers arent really the issue its the fact that romans pass plays are bland and poor at scheming guys open the reason lamar only passes to andrews and hollywood is because nobody else is getting themselves open we need to scheme around them boykin is like 63 and duvernay runs a 43 40 we should be designing plays specifically for them as well we have one of the most dominant run games ever when we choose to use it we really shouldnt need a top 5 receiving corps to be successful
what role would he have on our team we already have hollywood who has that same skillset our team is not really pass heavy to warrant two small speedster wrs and paying 10m to a guy who doesnt have a clear cut role and before this season only had good not great seasons just seems like a luxury for a team that had other holes its not like anyone expected wr to be our need this season

of course now it seems like we should have made a move but im not mad at edc for failing to do so
meh robbie anderson wanted to be reunited with matt rhule
i felt the same way about shaq barrett last year
with as bad as new orleans has been would edc take a shot at cam jordan
melvin ingram seems more likely imo especially now that they are 14
saints are 32 tied for division lead and just won with their defense they are not trading all decade cam jordan
the saints problem is somewhat fixable peyton just doesnt have the heart to tell brees hes getting benched for winston or whatever other qb they bring in
if i had to guess saints would want hollywood brown in return

they miss mike thomas badly

lol the way you said fighting for a new soul makes it seem like a war between angels and demons for your child and not for her fan loyalty lol
my wifes family are also eagles fans my father in law who is a eagles season ticket holder got brian billick to do a cameo video for me as a congrats when my son was born in august

he got brian to ask if he was coming home from the hospital in an eagles or ravens jersey as if there would be a choice

congrats on your daughter
i will light many purple candles for the soul of lj may she root for the ravens forever

and more seriously hope shes happy and healthy when she enters this world
here you go
lunas an awesome name congrats
i remember the ravens media had said this offseason that they would be using crowd noise from real games this season to pump in noise in the saints game after their tds they play a recording of the crowd doing who dat who dat why are the ravens not playing the crowd doing seven nation army after tds and turnovers we need that badly doesnt feel right watching games without it recently
i think theyre indeed pushing crowd noises thru the stadium speakers but if youre watching on tv the crowd you hear is being added by the tv company
im also missing the chants of ravens ravens after scoring plays led by real fan dan
i coulda sword they played seven nation army right after hollywood scored
iirc artificial crowd noise is controlled by the nfl at the stadiums not the home team
want crowd noise let fans back i love the silence fuck the fake noise
because its stupid as hell and completely unoriginal
disclaimer this is such a weird and random request a couple months ago a video circulated on instagram of lamar jackson holding a shield and dancing in the ravens locker room i cant remember which teammate posted it nor which sports page reposted it but im just curious if anyone else out there saw it and can link it to me

the song in the background is dank and im trying to find it its driving me insane

btw ravens are looking great and can honestly say im jealous of you guys keep it up
can we have our records back
twitter link

the song is actually featured on lamars ig page its his latest video post his ig is newera8
maybe
its loe shimmy ecstasy
mods if this breaks rules strike me down
lamar is jacked strongest qb in the league not named cam newton or josh allen

im now hype af for this game
im hyped too but right now we gotta worry about philly and getting this passing attack back into rhytmn
ben wont be able to tackle him either
steelers opponents so far have a combined 3131 record lmao and theyve all been close games 10 5 7 and 9 point wins lmaooo steelers are so fraud and will get exposed during the second half of the season i cant believe people are actually buying into them
to be fair the defense has won those last few games against pittsburgh regardless
steelers aint a real team yet
i didnt capitalize pronouns on purpose in case anyone asks

tucker is currently sitting at 90759 while butker is in second at 89655 respectively

im happy to look up any more information youd need to figure it out but im just incredibly curious

tuckers
only 4 extra misses and hed lose the title to butker
bonus he also sits at a whopping 991 for career xps made 315 out of 318 is insane
for his career justin tucker sits at 303 att 275 makes

3039yds 85 att 83 makes

if they each miss their next four fg attempts

tucker 275307 89577 a drop of 1182
butker 104120 86667 a drop of 2988
the 61 yarder the end of the first half this was all i can think about was his completion percentage
if your kicker is not in the 90 percentile disgusting
whatever it is the number keeps going up because on any given game even if he has a miss there are at least 2 hits to mathematically squash it

compare that to last year
thats fine just had to do better when you pass less four verts and more crossers challenge outside the numbers more more short and intermediate routes that arent seams the zig hollywood ran on third was beautiful
brutal

when you are trying to build a multi dimensional offense you need to practice new plays


when you lose your all pro right guard and ask your young offensive line to pass block when they are behind in down and distance there will be growing pains

if we can add 10 really good plays that attack outside of the numbers to the 2 dozen plays that attack the middle who is going to stop us shit teams had to have a stacked defense up the middle just to slow us down last year
wtf if this data is true then holy shit what are doing comparing this chart to last years chart sheesh


jesus hes a huge human
these pics make it look like jonathan ogden played high school football in 1957
lmfaoooo the first pic has me dying hes cartoonishly huge compared to the others
thanks for the laugh
im starting to feel sorry for his mother what did he weigh when he was born
number 73 on the black team
my other favorite photo thats similar to these

andy reid and the other 15yearold boys in the punt pass and kick contest
hes the big guy isnt he

s
every huddle run behind jo on 3 1 2 3 break
mammoth
i see this pic i upvote always
this is likely the snootiest school ive ever been in and ive been in some snooties
met him once at some bar in power plant live about 20 yrs ago said hello and we shook hands it was more like i looked to my left and saw a very large dude next to me and i said holy shit are you jonathan ogden he laughed and nodded

dude is huge
roman and harbs are getting lots of questions regarding our passing deficiencies but i havent come across anything digging into coach culleys hand in what were seeing hes the passing game coordinator and wr coach has anyone come across anything detailing what the hell hes doing this year
nobody outside the building has any idea how much input he has and therefore how much heat he might be getting for all we know the passing game coordinator title might be nonsense and hes just the wrs coach with a fancier title
i think it was 2014 or 2015 when he was on the chiefs and kc receivers had 0 zero tds that year in 16 games now i know nothing about coaching receivers or football in general its just an interesting information regarding culley
yall just be googling people to hate lmao
this is what i want to know my assumption is that he has very little input as far as our passing scheme is concerned roman seems like the type to fully run the show
he needs the boot too

he can be our guy without being perfect and still have areas that need improvementwork youre not a fake fan just because you see the flaws and potentially ways to fix them on your favorite team lamar of all people is a guy who knows he has elements of his game to work on and is by all means willing to put in the work
stony case elvis grbac kyle boller vinny testaverde

the people who are bitching about lamar didnt sit through games watching these guys play

they jump on the bandwagon for one season dont understand the game and then complain when he doesnt throw 350 yards and rush for 100 every game

me i love the guy i think he might be playing a little sore or hurt but lets also remember last season was above and beyond anyones expectations

sit back enjoy the ride root hard and dontbeajerk
ive seen people say hes hit his ceiling and wont improve hes 23 ive seen the same people say they wont give up on carson wentz because he still has room to grow hes 27

tldr people are stupid just be rational and understand that lamar wont be perfect every week and will struggle sometimes go ravens
ive said this and i will keep saying thats part of what has people frustrated its not that we now think lamar sucks its that we all love lamar and we know he can do a lot better than what hes been doing
were 41

this sub has become full of fake fans andor trolls people who want to stir up negativity around an elite teams fanbase they want to create distruss of the team they want us to lose faith in the ravens

we are 41 we curb stomped the 41 browns our defense has the best ppg average in the league who cares if the offense hasnt fully got it together by week 5 were off to a great start and our offense will get better as it runs the ball more later in the season because we typically run the ball more in cold weather

i dont care if lamar isnt putting up mvp numbers hes still preforming well and keeping turnovers to a minimum

also we lead the league in total rushing yards lets see best defensive ppgleading the league in rushing yards

this is what happens when you get a bunch of bandwagon fans they all get sour when things arent working 100 perfectly imagine being disappointed in a 41 team

also look for the return of ravens fans to the bank next home game
the only issue with the offense is that they no longer run to set up the pass if we can get back to that then well start to look dominant again

i think that lamar and the offense gain confidence from qb runs and that we should encourage our mvp to tuck and run rather than try to prove the haters wrong by throwing deep to hollywood in double coverage
theyre a young offense with plenty of room to grow personally im excited to watch him develop and take ownership of the offense
murray
turned around the franchise youre going a bit into the deep end there i mean we had 5 years of average and were perennial contenders outside of that and had a superbowl win its also only been one full year i mean i love him as much as the next guy but not at the cost of disrespecting the history of the franchise

the real guys behind the greatness of the franchise are the gms they pull in incredible talent at a very consistent rate almost all of our greats came to us through the draft rather than through free agency there are so many great players in our history of 25 years its crazy
honestly i stand with lamar i feel like hes getting into his own head and not having fun out there right now thats what made him so special last year he did what he wanted but had fun this year it seems as if he has to over perform for some reason and the matchup against patrick really messed him up big time
hawks fan here bird gang respect and i gotta say the criticism will only get worse as your success continues russ is on another insane tear and even i find myself criticizing his every mistake because when there are less they all seem to matter more keep your heads high cause i wanna see a bird on bird bowl also fuck the steelers
i love lamar i hate the purple pants
who is dissing him year three and he gets better every season beating kc will come in time
is every fanbase as dismissive of our coordinators as ours is hey we made it through matt cavanaugh we can survive greg roman the only oc that seemed to be a fans choice was gary kubiak well hes calling plays in minnesota and they look good at times but this year without diggs they arent the same

lets start a game greg roman is a better oc than
they must have never watched kyle boller play
thats our qb and you either ride with him or you can go be a fan of some other team
i thank the philadelphia eagles every day for trading the 32nd overall pick in the 2018 nfl draft to the baltimore ravens
he is going to give us super bowl trophy somehow someway and it dont matter the stats he is gonna get us super bowl
he did not turn around our franchise lmao
give it time i dont know if its a need for him and the team to gel together more or justs needs to be more consistent but im sure hell get back up to where he was last year i mean hes already doing good now
amen
any ravens fan that is bitching is a fuckin bitch
thats my quarterback
lets win a championship first
this guy is a beast cant wait to see more of him
i was at that game on the 50 yard line
anyone that thinks lamar is a problem is an absolute buffoon hes the only reason this offense doesnt look like the horrible scheme that it is
turned around the franchise is a strong phrase i feel
still hasnt done what joe flacco did win a playoff gamesb still not many people in this town will put respect on joe flaccos name lamar needs to play better sorry
forever grateful for lamar i just want want him to take the next step it really feels like hes regressing from a passing standpoint our oline hasnt helped with poor pass blocking that bengals game was eyeopening mainly because he didnt run at all and his passing was extremely off
the teams that win superbowls often get hot at the right time i honestly think us having issues to work on and stuff to correct and still winning is sort of an advantage we have a lot to go over and a lot of space to get better i also think lamar might be playing a little hurt also our offense has been super simple this year i think we might not be putting stuff on tape when we dont need to against some of these lesser teams
should i genuflect

thats not a lot of boos luckily for wentz
wonder how much tickets would be
im wondering if well open mt up a little more after the bye week
thats dumb af pointless
just as numbers climb back up wonderful
eagles will begin welcoming fans to home games starting this sunday vs the ravens total stadium capacity will be limited to 7500

we are all wonderful fans and im not speculating anyones commitment or football brains maybe im a bleeding heart but we just beat an nfl team 273 a team that has fucked us many times look all im saying is this isnt the acc sure we have concerns but god damn enjoy the window while its here this is fun
people are still just sore from the ass whooping from the chiefs cant expect the team in cruise control demolishing bad teams to really erase that there are clearly issues and concerns to be addressed there were a lot of complaints in 2012 as well and the team ended up winning the sb it is important to be realistic and assess issues with the team while also trying to enjoy wins against inferior opponents going to take some time for everyone to get over the chiefs loss though it was a brutal one the team has looked off offensively since then and people are wanting to see improvement that takes time it will come
its funny the ravens are currently 1 in the entire league in dvoa they have the 17 off 3 def and 1 spec teams by that metric they also lead the nfl in point differential they are doing all of that while trying to figure things out on offense

if this team figures it out on offense they will be better than they were last yr
idk id rather talk about the issue than circlejerk over how good the team is then again everyone has different motivations for being on here so as long as people arent rude i dont care
yeah we really are its okay to have criticism over a players performance or of the teams game plan but i really cant enjoy myself when im in the game day live thread one small mistake and its trade him or fire him or this defense is shit etc etc

like you cant expect this team to outscore our opponents by 50 every game
this probably goes to your point of us being spoiled but once we take a 2 score lead or the opponent does which happens less often the game sort of feels over
exactly i hate all the fake fans i pass dropped and its fire this guy fire that guy i remember flacco days where every game came down to a one score win or loss
ive been a fan since 2008 and we have had exactly 1 losing season sure a fair bit a disappointment missing the playoffs but never realizing 3 games into the season that your team has no hope we even transitioned from flacco to jackson without any pains

its good to be a ravens fan
when you see the potential this offense have its har to settle for mediocrity im just so proud of our defense so i dont care 41 baby
its ok to expect the best from the best
i mean we cant go 160 anymore and im pretty pissed and disappointed s

not long ago flacco was our leader and we legit couldnt win more than 2 games in a row or win by a comfortable margin im not bashing flacco because superbowl but it makes me all the more thankful for jackson
the only problem is the offense is not yet complete we need 2 big physical play making recievers hollywood and mark andrews are insane but hollywoods size 58 and andrews speed at tight end truly equal out to only 1 reciever lamar is intent on being a pocket passer albeit most probably from criticism and not running the defense is ravenous you can pretty much guarantee at least 1 defensive td a game the running game is solid but unorthodox
yes i was saying the same thing lets appreciate the team we have right now we wouldve given anything 10 years ago to be the team that averages 30 points per game
definitely its annoying to see people bash a team thats better and has been better than a lot of teams in such a short amount of time people put everything under a microscope and think they are the head coach or gm its like people would rather our qb throw for 500 yards and lose than do what needs to be done even if its ugly on the stat sheet to win i often wonder how long the people who constantly complain have been actually a fan of the team considering how many posts in this sub of fans jumping ship from their shitty team to root for the ravens its like do any of you complainers remember it wasnt too long ago where 88 was considered a good season or when we had an endless carousel of qbs before we drafted flacco do people not remember jumping from elvis grbac to randall cunningham to jeff blake to chris redmon to kyle boller to anthony wright to steve mcnair back to kyle boller and then back to mcnair
dont say this too loud or people will get their jimmies rustled

i dont call it f5 szn more like read too much into tweets szn
its f5 season boys


alright who we robbing
ok be honest how many of you follow edcs wife on twitter i unashamedly do didnt know there were more of us though lmao
idgi
i dont get it whats so funny



eagles and being hurt name a more iconic duo
eagles rt lane johnson gathered more opinions on his nagging ankle sources say its just a matter of trying to get some rest and fight his way through it no talk of surgery shutting him down or anything like that well see about his availability for sunday vs the ravens

on todays ravens recap we discuss the powerful defensive performance and patrick queens development we also discuss the ravens offensive identity and remind ourselves where the ravens were a year ago

if you enjoyed last weeks offensive filmstudy with ufilmstudy i go on another dobbins diatribe this episode
only the bangedup new york jets are worse
efficiency is good
they rank 31st in passing yards they dont rank that poorly in passing efficiency

they were what 27th in passing yards last yr well it didnt matter because their run game grinded out yards they were 1st in passing efficiency

the jets are awful because they are terrible in both yards and efficiency
trade lamar
theyve been up pretty big on everyone aside from the chiefs theres no reason to be chucking it up when youre in the lead and the team is a top running team in the league
dont take volume stats too seriously we would be passing more if we were behind more we were bottom third in the league last year in passing yards too
sunk in and still dont give a fuck 41 with room to improve most ravens fans can remember offenses much more stagnate from past seasons keep faith and fuck the steelers
the ravens were 27th in passing last year who gives a shit
theyre 4 and 1 and this wont make the head coach wannabes happy because they think theyre not running the ball enough
the number one passing team is 13

let that sink in
stink in
worrying stat but well be fine were still better than 95 of the other teams who chuck it 50 times a game only teams ill worry about are the chiefs steelers patriots maybe bills but theyre due to get exposed and they will
i dont care what we threw what did we run for and how much clock got ran off
even last year w our op offense we didnt have volume stats for passing
ravens had such a strong second half of the season that i believe people forget how bad they were doing until week 7 versus the seahawks when we acquired marcus peters cut a lot of people and did some change arounds
its only week 6 with no preseason think we should be confident and believe they will clean up mistakes in the season half of the season
anything you think is wrong im sure the coaches and players are aware and more
even with the woes were still more dynamic than 2012 early 2018 ravens hell i was a fan during kyle boller era i much rather us be under dogs and under the radar its kinda annoying that were so good that were on blast for the entire league and any little mistake is amplified to the max by everyone outside the ravens base
we got this and i just pray the season doesnt get canceled and all our players stay healthy
we werent even doing bad prior to week 7 last year

people on this sub seem to have forgotten that most teams dont just flat out expect to win every game

i totally agree that our offense has looked a little off but were still out there bodying teams 386 vs the browns 273 3117 these are beatdowns

there are plenty of playoff caliber teams that dont blow teams out this badly we are still a very good football team and if they can get the offense rolling again we may be unstoppable
the issue i have is that we are seeing the same mistakes weve seen time and time again usually hitting us in big games its not like penalties are killing us which can be fixed it runs deeper

i do believe these issues can be fixed its just frustrating to see the same things crop up

im taking the bengals game lightly as i do feel lamar being banged up and no practising played some part

this eagles game will be a good indicator they arent a great team but they seem to be able to hang about and flash at times id like to see us go there and play an all phases good game we really need to see receivers stepping up too

whatever effect you were going for on that headline you got it from me
clickbait

rg3 has become incredibly outspoken recently and im all for it
watching this bils game rn josh allen isnt even really throwing that accuratley diggs is looking so good at finding space right now and opening the field though bills playcalling and route design is also really nice
i think with the right play calling hollywood and duvernay could possibly be the best 12 combo the ravens have had in a long while the speed and ability is just too great hollywoods route running and duvernays burst and big play ability makes me happy at night
allen just forced a throw to diggs in triple coverage hes been tearing it up but looks extremely human tonight lamar will get back on track i agree playcalling is really the key
all you gotta look at is the 2012 ravens sure flacco was slinging it but every time he felt like he was in trouble he would just toss it in the general vicinity of anquon boldin and more often than not boldin comes down with it we lose boldin all of a sudden flacco is a shell of his former self

mandrews is the closest thing we have to that now and he ranks 4th on the team in routes run having that true possession receiver that can beat any corner in the league 1v1 is what we are missing all other contenders have him chiefs have hill and kelce bills have diggs packers have adams cowboys got cooper seahawks have dk and locket

i think getting lamar his q is what we are really missing from being one of the most dominant franchises ever sure hollywood boykin and duvernay have all showed varying levels of promise but i dont think any of them are going to turn into that q role we need
the bills have been secretly good the past couple of years adding diggs was definitely the right move as he breaks up the game plan i wouldnt be surprised if they win their division by multiple games and even win a playoff game not good enough to go past that point yet though
the bills secret is that dabolls becoming a better pass game coordinator they scheme up a lot of high percentage throws

allen has improved a lot as well

diggs is the icing on the cake for them
russell wilson got dk hes immediately in the mvp disscussion
he also has john brown i always thought he was a number one as well

excellent content
that shit was straight up disrespectful of henry he might as well take a piss on norman while hes establishing dominance
just a bills fan chiming in to say that i laughed at this
once he gets past the 2nd level the defense is just fucked
lmao


i really like our current uniforms but these are tough ngl
havent bought a jersey in like a decade but would cop this immediately
this a sample or bootleg or whaa

im not on twitter anyone know

how the fuck is adam gase a good enough con artist to stay employed

sign him as a receiver lol
jets fan here bell is still really good and i think would be great for you guys hes a great pass blocker and pass catcher too he isnt just a runner i think he is going to tear it up wherever he goes he could help lamar out by doing the little things right
bell wasnt the reason jets are 05 its that dumbass they call a coach i never understand why the jets chose gase did they not see him in miami
i feel bad for jets fans somehow adam gase has lasted longer in that organization than jamal adams and leveon bell
must have been real awkward for flacco and bell last week after all those great ravenssteelers games they found themselves together exiled to the jets
i dont think we have room for him
really dont want the ravens to bother he hasnt looked anywhere near as good since he took a season off

jets are fully embracing the tank im curious if wed be able to pry a player like herndon williamson or maye off their hands on the cheap herndon especially i think could thrive here as a te2

for bell hes accounting for 15m in dead cap for the jets i highly doubt hell be expensive wherever he wants to go but i also think he wants to win and he wants to be featured my guess in order of likeliness

1 buffalo
2 pittsburgh
3 chicago

dark horse after spending years in the tundras of michigan st pittsburgh and new york miami sets up for the future by offering bell big money south beach and the chance to be tuas future goto
the jets have released rb leveon bell

sign ab and leveon
hes not coming here we have 0 need for him
so many in this sub wanted the ravens to sign him
no one say it the answer is no
ok
pass
i hope we give him a look ingram doesnt look the same as last year and we could use bell to fill that role while dobbins develops

no thank you we already have 3 capable backs and right now dont think our oline is good enough for his patient running style
its either going to be seattle patriots or bucs picking him up outside shot of chiefs
not sure if everyone caught the pat mcafee show from earlier today but pat aaron rodgers and aj hawk had an interesting conversation in regards to aaron being a good talent evaluator to which he said yes he thinks he is

i would link it but the vid is 40mins long

basically aaron surprisingly gave lamar a huge vote of confidence he first and foremost mentioned in regards to how you know someone will be a good qb in this league from early onand randomly he chose lamar jackson as an example

being able to throw the ball at a high level you have to be able to sling ityou look at lamar as talented as lamar is athleticly he is one of the fastest guys in the leagueyou watch him in college he can sling it i mean he can really sling it big time arm throwing 7580 yards

so you just knew 1 he is supremely athletic 2 he can really throw it so footwork wise hes gonna figure it out with coaching and a good offense

amazing interview with aaron the guy is must watch tv on the pat mcafee show every week looking like an mvp and nfc favorite so far this season

i braced for aaron to roast lamar after his lethal my down years are career years for other qbs comment last weekbut instead he had nothing but great things to say about him during a season where lamar and the passing attack are struggling a bit so far
i remember rodgers talking with him last year at midfield in a preseason game when we played lots of love between the two
lamar sees aaron rodgers as one of the goats in football he said it in a press conference in 2019 its cool to see rodgers have a lot of confidence in lamar though im sure lamar appreciate it as well
i heard it it was great to hear love that show


heres the link
love rodgers on mcafees show he seems like a guy who actually takes things like lamar calling him the goat to heart as a true sign of respect and will probably keep that in mind for the rest of lamars career
thats pretty dope that he brought up lamar as a example
he also further addressed that there are a lot of components of a qb that could be coached by sheer athleticism isnt one of them basically complimenting lamars natural athletic ability
theres nothing surprising about that rodgers commented on lamar while he was still in college saying he was going to be dangerous in the league after his rookie year rodgers said that he was surprised lamar didnt take the starting role earlier and he wouldnt be surprised if he saw the ravens in the super bowl the next year and during the mvp race rodgers said it was lamar and it wasnt even close since week 10 rodgers has always been a fan of lamar and sung his praises him saying it again is the least surprising football related thing thats happened this week
game respects game
his espn comment was hilarious

it was on for a little bit the sound was off though thats normally how i watch espn broadcasts the past few years anyway
well we got good coaching good offense remains to be seen

made me love marlon more such awesome energy
marlon is having a blast out there and kicking butt doing so
lamarlon 4 4 8
my god marlon is a different animal not a lot of corners that can do as many things as he does at an elite level covers tackles gets his hands on the football and physical like a linebacker
marlon blitz me blitz me wink

next play burrow drops back ravens send pressure and hes sacked by marlon humphrey

dude is such a fucking dog also im pretty sure if marlon punched me in the chest full force hed straight up cave my ribcage in dude has a disgustingly powerful and accurate hook
this makes me appreciate the energy humphrey brings and the poise lamar has like lamar isnt the hypeman for the team hes just focused and always trying to improve and humphrey is far and away the hypeman blitz me wink gets a sack hell yeah
i love how they added music to this weeks episode the montage with the song was hard

ravens sign bell just to start him against the steelers
no but he shouldve sign with yall instead of us hed probably be in several rush title conversations now he just gone
bills are probably the best landing spot for him they have money and singletary doesnt seem to be good enough to be a lead back

would love to have him as i dont think hes washed given gases history of making everybody worse and instantly becoming better the second they leave bell could have a resurgence i just dont know where he would fit unless we cut ingram all of a sudden

that hold out really hasnt paid off beyond getting guaranteed money his legacy will be what could have been he was on a hof track before the hold out and i dont blame him for holding out it just didnt work out
how long before we could trade him give him 2 week make him look like a god and then trade him for a pass rush
lets get this out of the way now the ravens dont need leveon bell

i think arizona would be a good spot for him
do we need him no at the right price lets kick the tires id still rather save up what cap space we have for potential pass rush or oline help though

is that an eagles wing on his helmet
oh fuck where did you get this

hold your thoughts for now

the bills play the chiefs next monday
any given tuesday
i left all social media for about a week after that awful mnf game bills fans were talking shit
i just find it funny how when the bills get killed by the titans no one starts questioning josh allens legitimacy or wondering if he can ever come back from a deficit or talking about how when the bills lose they lose hard you know the way they do anytime lamar loses
ps in my heart of hearts i believe the bills just laid an egg it happens theyre still a contender but i will say it over here where the bills cannot get the satisfaction of my encouragement lol
bills fans are assholes i live in pittsburgh fuck the steelersi went to the steelersbills game last year girlfriend is a steelers fan fuck the steelers and the bills fans were insufferable they have been like that at the bank too had season tickets since memorial and never had a good experience with bills fans

psfuck the steelersif that wasnt clear
josh allen had a terrible game but i feel like if he has his usually game then the bills still lose just not by as much the gap between the bills and titans isnt as pronounced as the score showed
i had an argument with a steelers fan friend saying the bills were better than the squealers i still believe that
i think the pats will still win the afce
i always just deadstare my coworker who is constantly complaining about the unfair criticism josh allen receives eye roll amirite

holy shit what a lopsided trade lmao
if this is the stuff happening in your league its not very competitive all 3 players are greater than all 3 players collusion
cams hair is amazing in this
seems like a bad trade
i lose brown but holy shit i cant believe he made this trade unprompted
considering the depth the team has at rb ingram edwards dobbins having a total of 19 carries between the three of them in the last game against cincy really doesnt seem like theyre utilizing the talent at that position also on a semi side note id like to see dobbins involved in the passing game more often maybe put in the slot position in certain situations
i honestly think they are trying to pass as much as possible in what are perceived as the less difficult games to give the offense more reps and looks at it

we know we can win the game on the ground but with lack of camp and presesaon have to use season games to get gud

this was significantly worse than ets stiff arm i dont think i could stiff arm a six year old this hard
im having flashbacks
why doesnt he like the number 29
henry is one if the most fun players to watch he also looks really cool his hair is badass and his size body type makes him look really badass too almost like a comic book
yeah this isnt rtitans get this garbage out of here post on their sub so those assbags have something to watch while on covid quarantine



you could probably have some fun with ed reeds crazier interception returns in 2008 he had a 107 yard int touchdown return against the eagles and the same year he had a crazy six against the dolphins where he looped back and forth across the field a couple of times
ray rices checkdown on 4th and a mile against the chargers is pretty iconic and lamars run on the bengals last year
do a blank black poster for when the lights went out in the super bowl
a silly yet still memorable one would be kochs safety at the super bowl
if you could manage to put multiple plays on one piece you should do the prime time game torrey smith played after his brother died thats a very memorable moment in ravens history
4th down and game over featuring ray lewis and darren sproles
ray lewis steals the ball from eddie george and goes for 6

i consider this as the play that signaled the ravens org shed the browns and arrived in the nfl as their own new thing
hey diddle diddle ray rice across the middle
thats a great idea but maybe add the players number
lamar jacksons spin move td run against the bengals could be a good one
jacoby joooooooneshas it at the 20

lamars legendary run versus the bengals last year

please add the b andor o button for the added flare for the spin move
justin tuckers 6 field goals against the lions in order from shortest to longest with the shortest being on the left hash and the longest being on the right
the ray rice 4th and 29 play from the san diego game that same season
looks great adding the defensive and blocking assignments like a madden play diagram could add a lot of flair
i think its its one play you should include the line dont have to show them moving like jacoby but i think it would add something

without the line i think having memorable games could be a good idea like one poster mentioned torrey smiths game his brother died jamal lewis 295 yards last minute drives etc

honestly that could look weird but might work


one other idea would be to add a qr code with the radio call or something
love it do you sell them
lamars run last year against the bengals jukes and spin move

hopefully for flaccos sake hes not hitting cb lamar jackson too often
that is just weird
ive been a jets fan for three decades and ive decided that im no longer sure i can continue to waste my life supporting a team that is so fundamentally flawed are you guys accepting refugees from the jets fandom

people have divorced spouses for less emotional abuse and ive always had a soft spot for you guys love the colors the literary name the coach

whaddya say
youre practically a ravens fan already with the amount of spare baltimore parts the jets always claim
heck yeah if you want to fit in here then the first thing you have to do is buy a marlon humphrey jersey secondly annoy your friends about how patrick queen is a future hofer lastly defend lamar at all costs even if it means flaming our oc
a reverse ravens to jets trade interesting
welcome aboard but theres three words you have to say first
i mean you were already basically a fan of the 20142018 ravens roster lmao
bonus points you can wear that green flacco or mosley or any of the other ravens playing in new jersey right now and i at least will be cool with it
being a jets fan is like being a knicks fan so i think its acceptable i would call dolan less competent then the johnsons though
its a natural because youve already cheered for so many former ravens players the jets are like the ravens retirement home
theres always a seat open on the gus bus welcome to the flock
fuck the jets bro we always have room welcome
welcome
welcome to the flock buddy
fuck the jets and more importantly fuck the steelers
welcome bruh dont give up on nyj tho life after gase has no where to go but up

yes because this is only popular on this sub


podcast with michael crawford

should fans be this concerned about a 41 start
would the ravens benefit from having a lead back
detail on play of each offensive lineman
how are the ravens impacted by reduced pistol usage
you guys are awesome
love the site and all the work put but the audio issue returned this episode

i read this post in trumps voice
never
he said he doesnt want to coach anymore now that hes gotten used to having free time again with his family
his offense was struggling to keep up with the innovations of the mid2000s so im not sure 15 years on hes ready to be an oc

now if only roman can actually call some more damned run plays

i had a bet double at the start of the year for queen droy and minshew most passing yards minshew is 150 yards off the lead so far minus dak so need him to get hot
it should be noted that he wasnt the defensive rookie of the week he was the defensive player of the week
vote for week 5 pepsi rookie here
bug truss

i remember this game great game
he has shown since signing with gb that he absolutely deserved it but that game probably made zadarius a hefty sum of money 13 of the sacks in his contract year came in that game
obligatory fuck the titans
the first and only ravens game ive been to
i was there worst part though we travel all the way to nashville climb up to our seats and who do we sit next to two huge steelers fans steelers gear on and everything why
remember when everyone thought willie henry was such a big steal and he was going to be amazing
god i miss zadarius
does anyone know if kenny youngs been contributing with the rams
only game ive been to since i live in bama

did he make it before rg3
these have so many easter eggs theyre just master pieces
rbleacherreportshows


basically we are running the ball more effectively but choosing to not take advantage our passing game has also regressed

imo we need to get back to the run first identity and the passing game will improve

edit it should also be noted that the rbs are running better even with lamar having a reduced role in the rushing attack
in essence brown and andrews account for nearly half of all ravens targets through five games whats more alarming is that the rest of the group from boykin on down have a 695 reception rate while hollywood and andrews combine for a 616 catch rate with five drops per pff

this is my issue with boykin hes not drawing the other teams best defender or double coverage most of the times they dont even expect the ball to go to him so when they do throw it to him or design the play for him he should be breaking for big yards
in there most recent power rankings cbs placed pittsburgh at 2 and baltimore at 5 espn and nflcom both have pitt below us but within 23 spots the steelers opponents have a combined win of 167 with pittsburgh only having a net point differential of 52 the ravens opponents have a combined win of 458 nearly triple that of pittsburghs with a net point differential of 90 nearly double that of pittsburghs

the fact that these organizations put them anywhere close to us and some even multiple spots above us is so disrespectful it hurts i cant wait to shit on them like always fuck the steelers also fuck the patriots browns and bengals
you will take pittsburgh to the woodshed you guys watch
pitt is undefeated and is normally a top team each year except last year its not surprising to see them be ranked that high overrated or not just based off of their supporters and what people expect of them i want them to be bad but im not gonna worry about ranking until they play us

x200b

fuck the steelers
steelers opponents have a combined 3 wins theyre about to hit a tough stretch of cleveland ravens and titans theyll probably come out of that 42 media will die drop their praise then another stretch of bad teams dallas bengals jags theyll be the darlings again

im not complaining at how easy their schedule is its only slightly easier than ours their schedule is backloaded so we will see how it plays out
dan hanzus knows not to play with us
who cares really the only ranking that matters is where you are after week 17 you guys get triggered over the smallest things
its not going to matter until we play each other their d is pretty good but im not confident with their o but it is true they havent really played a true contender yet it will be interesting to see what happens this week
probably a shit post

but i just have this feeling that lamar is going to get back to his old self against the eagles shake off the jitters and what not people have been concerned about his level of play and i think lamar is too and he is going to fix his problems this week and get back to his old self

does anyone else agree with this shit post of mine
hes really really due for a game where he steals the spotlight
i think weve gotten away from a lot of what worked last year i think the lack of an offseason program also set him back some its fair to assume there would be some form of regression after winning an mvp in an offense there was almost no legit tape on hes not playing well and some of that falls on the oline and the oc he has to play better and i think he will philly gives him a good chance to do some the things he likes to do attack the middle of the field and what not hes on pace for 3k yds 29 tds 6 ints which would stilll be a good season for most qbs better than any joe flacco regular season i think getting philly and then rolling into a bye before pittsburgh is going to help a lot of things
eagles have the worst staring lb group in the league and its not even close we also have struggled against mobile qbs last few years add the fact that the offense is missing 7 starters ravens will coast to a double digit w
i dont know if i agree but im certainly hopeful i think they may be better than their record indicates theyre working with a number of backups and still doing well the number of points they put up against pittsburghs defense is nothing to sneeze at i really am hoping that these first few games were like the preseason and we get really clicking
i think lamar might play better in front of fans home or away so yeah even though they were competative against the steelers last week i dont think itll be close
personally a bit worried about their beast d line
i agree that i want to see lamar put a 50 berger on em
part of me thinks we wont see the aggressiverunning attacking version of lamar until the stretch run and playoffs
should i start hollywood in fantasy this week
cursed post
yeah just a gut feeling
mark andrews will so that helps lamar to have a bounce back game
hell get back to it remember it wasnt until what week 8 or 9 that he started to really dominate up until then his numbers were very similar to what they are now
i feel like the defense is going to bully wentz
big truss in dobbins week 6
not with 1 carry per game
youre gonna get 45 yards on 4 touches only hope is if he manages to find the end zone on one of those
i expect him to have some bigger games as the season rolls on with an expanding role from here on out but theres no indication next week is the week to begin that trend i would hold him for later this season but manage expectations for next week
whenever they decide to give him the ball more hell pop off who knows when thatll be we seem to be a passing offense now for whatever reason
thanks for all the responses im last in waiver order so ive already decided that jk will be my rb2 my matchup is so close that his success will determine whether i winlose but yk what i have faith in the flock
probably not what other options do you have
you realize gordon is probably gonna play atleast this week
he will get you 810 pts with his current role

hopefully they start spinning him up though
this could be a good week for him most likely slay will be on hollywood so they could lean on the run game more this game
im doing the same dont have a choice this week hes a boom or bust fantasy player at best we have to hope he finds the end zone on one of his 5 carries

the referee announced 7 as the one who commited the penalty the editor was just doing his job right lmao
holding on to the football
totally read your caption as wtf team
i saw this and i thought i was crazy

lol
didnt he just get done with corona
fuck the titans

tannehill is a frat douche derrick henrys dread looks like a giant turd after eating nothing but protein for a week and kamalei correa sucks

hes 4th on their depth chart at olb and was garbage here

hard pass
it seemed like correa started coming into his own during the second half of last season when the titans were making their playoff push he worked his way into tenessees starting line up and had 7 sacks 7 qb hits and 7 tackles for loss between the final 8 regular season and 3 postseason games

i wondered what happened to him before you know getting covid im guessing the additions of clowney and beasley took most of his snaps
no
lol fuck that team

on the real though unless hes a good pass rusher we dont need him
garbage
noooo thank you that bridge has been crossed i dont think hed be a guy wed bring back
in related news i am demanding an nfl team signs me
kamalei corona
traded to the jags
im trolling guys
i feel like theres really one move to make and its ryan kerrigan we need to bolster our pass rush and hes not bad against run are there any other pass rush additions trade or fa that anyone can think of
takkarist mckinley24 he exactly hasnt lived up to the 1st round hype but hell be a fa next season plus the falcons are in cap hell i think he can be had for a day 3 pick
melvin ingram is really the best answer

big cap hit now and hes a ufa in 2021 but hes 31 not at the immediate end of his career with a few years left in him he brings leadership and good pass rush moves

hes worked in a 34 d and knows how to play the chiefs hard wed be able to probably extend him to a 23 year deal 2 with a 3rd year option

hes making less than judon right now and hes a significantly better player

hes on ir right now i wish we wouldve traded for him back in august is what it is but i think hed do well for us

edit id like to add this would help shore up olb while ferguson develops more and we can draft an olb or two that can learn from ingram
i would start by involving duvernay more next week against the eagles see what happens then evaluate the overall offense over the bye week if lamar still cant rely on anyone besides brown and andrews then put together a package and trade for michael gallup

last year edc used every avenue to beef up the defense because it struggled early this year its the offense so it deserves the focus
i know theres not a lot of oline talent out there but i feel like if we upgrade the middle this offense would look much more like 2019
i know most of this sub is pretty set on getting a wr or pass rusher but i think gerald everett could be a cheap one year rental higbee has taken a lot of his share of the rams offense and hes in the last year of a four year contract worth about 6 million

everett is a solid blocker and improvement over boyle as a receiver he could slide into a hayden hurst role and let us utilize more 3 te sets like last year
o line wr1 playmaker pass rusher rg3 to cowboys
theres no one on the team id like to give up though or even any picks the only spot im concerned about is on our offensive line
i want a julio give us a julio
jj watt
curtis samuel long speed and just the type of yac receiver we need to compliment the run game
corey davis

zach ertz

maybe yannick still hes only on a one year deal and vikings have been garbage or one of the 3 edge dude from the titians vic beasley clowney and harold landry
cooper kupp for a third


dream would be a 4 way trade where we get aaron donald julio jones and khalil mack without taking any cap hit along with their 1st round picks but i have a feeling that wont happen
4th round pick for mahomes so we dont have to worry about the chiefs anymore
maybe try and get gallup from the cowboys or even like kerrigan from the football team
yeah

lets throw in mike evans and godwin for a 3rd and 5th next year

sure itll work fit in nicely with julio

realistically i would want someone like gallup
allen robinsonchris godwin or michael gallup for a 2nd rounder
quenton nelson for one of our patented 5th round picks go from a sure fire hall of fame guard to the best guard of the new generation
julio for a 2nd late second because were a damn good team and some mid round picks is a dream but taking into account the dead money they would owe for moving him theres not a gm that would make that trade also other teams would offer a better second than we can if they were dumb enough so its pointless to even talk about this trade takkarist mckinley for a 6th would be a trade scenario i could see between atl and ravens

my realistic dream trade would be josh sweat for a 4th eagles are bad hes good and on a rookie deal through next season
tj watt for a 5th julio for a 5th zadarius for a 5th
we have enough talent to win rings we just have to do a better job at sequencing drives and making adjustments on the fly its like the entire first half is scripted but if we dont get the lead early then our play callers wet the bed it literally happens every stinking time can we somehow acquire another offensive mind gregg roman has done an exceptional job at installing this offense and transitioning lamar to the nfl but man his incompetence at play calling in high pressure situations is glaring with jimmy smith returning im not worried at all on the defensive side of things with him back theyll be a sturdy unit we have the talent to win now we had the talent to win last year too
i would like the ravens to trade for corey davis he should cost too much since hes only been okay mostly because of marriota being terrible i think he still has all the tools to be a number 1 wr
zach ertz for powers and a second round pick

love jimmy ravens legend

stealing a comment by which perfectly sums up how i feel about jimmys legacy as a raven

theres a few stages to a guys career that make me consider them all time ravens overproducing on your rookie contract is one and a lot of guys do that being in the upper echelon of your position during your second contract is another and thats harder to do but the hardest is in your third contract when you accept a diminished role and become a locker room leader and a veteran presence to help develop the next generation of talent on the team and thats by far the hardest to do im really really happy that jimmy seems to be checking that third box now imo hes en route to the ring of honor
love me some jimmy smith although i will say i was always certain wed trade or bag him based on injuries and availability

i think hes deserving of the ring of honor even though i wanted jimmy traded for picks or players a few years ago business is business i wanted him to succeed terribly

if he had elite availability and didnt get injured often i truly believe hed be talked about on par with pp and richard sherman he was a solid 3 cb if they were 1 and 2 from that draft

also he made game saving play on crabtree in sb47
you guys when remember when our success pretty much depended on this guys health
never forget that super bowl performance jimmy deserves a spot in the ring for sure
i love longtime ravens who are still on the team jimmy sam even guys like pernell mcphee who left and came back loved having bynes back last year which they had resigned him

keeps continuity with the previous eras without them it kinda just feels like rooting for laundry
will not tolerate any jimmy slander around me when healthy jimmy did everything we asked of him never had to worry about 22
hard to believe weve already had him for 10 years its a shame hes only played a full 16 game season two times but hes always been a very physical and reliable corner

i was hoping with how we were using him this year hed stay healthy but its looking like hes questionable philly

found it interesting that after the ravens td to hollywood lamar and him talked about how cinci was just going to our spots and i hope that doesnt mean much but interesting to hear combined with what teams have said about our offense in the past few weeks
so pretty much just marlon
observation 1 lamar jackson isnt very exciting micd up

observation 2 marlon humphrey yells a lot

observation 2a marlon humphrey is our hype man of the present and future

observation 3 marlon humphrey is good at football
humphrey is fucking possessed lmaoo never seen this much hype from anybody

dpoy
i like the random noises marlon makes


no
i dont see how this guy isnt going to be on the jets in a few years
damn tough crowd im still enjoying it that song remains a banger i guess we a devin duvernay household now
basically the title discuss away friends
hed be so perfect that guys is so underrated
i want gallup but hes actually not bad if crowder can be a better snead for a low pick then it might be worth it
best we can do is a 5th
i mean id prefer a big body for once but hed be an instant upgrade over some of our other wrs
am i a joke to you

duvernay probably
yes he is exactly what we need his ability to get open quick is up there statistically with mt not quite there but surprisingly close and that is exactly what we need
man fuck it trade our whole team at this point i fucking hate them
i think the receivers we have are a good core to progress forward i dont think we necessarily need to add more wrs but to utilize the ones we have better

respectfully disagree although the skill set isnt the exact same crowder is very similar to a few of our receivers duv and snead as far as being smaller build slot guys

crowder is dope but its about time we put duvernay in a lot more and see if he cant bring a similar skill set to what crowder would offer us at a way lower price tag if we go wr it should be a big body guy to replace boykin but id rather us trade for a og or edge rush if we do
crowder i barely know er
only former ravens go to the jets not the other way around
i wonder who we would trade considering they just released a back
just said to my wife yesterdayif only we had another 59 receiver
so the jets are pulling a miami its not a bad strategy for a shitty team
hes so fucking annoying to play against so i guess that would make him a great player to have
dude if it was up to rravens wed have traded all of our draft picks by now
i cant wait till we see shitsburg
wdym you lost it on him
he just yelled it out of the blue
honestly they could lose to the browns this weekend
fuck yinzers man i live in pittsburgh country and it blows my brothers and sisters are all pitt fans just remind them they got rgiiid without our starters
were you wearing a ravens jersey
rthathappened
hoping we can 20 them again this year
lol where in cali is there a safeway havent seen one one since i moved out here
they still havent really played a good team they were so shit the past two years they got a cream puff schedule im glad the browns are doing better so the squealers lose more divisional games


why does the clown face in the second row remind me of the steelers logo so much
we dont run the ball enough lamar throws to 2 receivers we dont run screens we dont have any creativity to our offense all valid criticisms
maybe just me but i have literally not read any takes here re not even making the playoffs
lol our defense is better but our offense has taken a step back im not at clown level since i know lamar can turn it around
while i do think our play calling has been stale well still dominate the regular season
im here taking bets that roman shits himself in our playoff game
i think if we just continue to invest in our offensive line and commit to running the ball well be fine
there are even people in here saying that wink should be fired
what about the completely realistic critique that is why tf arent we running the ball
its billichecksp and harbaugh and then every other coach is way behind them imo i hope he never gets fired he has shown the ability to change and adapt to his roster that very few coaches can do
i look at it in a positive way last year we were rolling winning 12 in a row no adversity werent ready for playoffs and the challenges that brings this year we are getting by beating the bad teams lamar looks average and we blitz too much kc game figure it out during the season get rolling late like 2012 team play wild card weekend and win 4 to get the lombardi back to the bank
theres a few issues that the ravens need to work on like getting reliable receiving options in the redzone or helping lamar get more accurate in tighter windows but to think they are missing the playoffs is an outrageous claim lol
feel like this is the sentiment as last year remember the seattle game thats when everything changed yeah the defense balled out last week but i feel like it was all scheme i also feel like our offense is only going to improve it can only get better we have been spoiled from last year but i think the gameplan is evolving trust the process we got a rookie that set to explode off 72 ypc its just not healthy to look at the this team currently and doubt this early we all saw what happened to the defense last year and we all know what lamar and co are capable of
im not one of the ungrateful fans who doesnt appreciate being 41 for what it is however no team is a lock for the playoffs in october unless they have a shit division and we do not
i can maybe get behind the idea of roman being let go idk harbs needs to stay though
i havent heard anyone say harbaugh should be fired but i do think greg roman should be on the hot seat
isnt the entire point of this subreddit to discuss the team id say the true clown is the one who blindly thinks the ravens have no issues

tons of people who just regurgitate groupthink which is a clown move as well
the way i look at is if theyre 41 while not firing on all cylinders look out later in the year when they get it going

besides with the extra wildcard teams this year almost 45 of the league makes it into the playoffs and were certainly in the top 45
pretty damn accurate imo
i mean even if youre a bandwagon fan who tf actually thinks they will miss the playoffs lol
the only thing ive seen here and that ive said myself is our offense gameplan needs to change lamar has looked a little off on deep throws past couple weeks and then had some takes on the offense during chiefs game too
we cant forget the should we pick up antonio brown which i see daily on facebook ravens arent comfortable with the oline with losing yanda and stanley playing injured which explains some of the questionable play calling yesterday it was larry fitzgerald who would never come to baltimore
only thing ive seen is getting roman firedi agree and thats about it

lamar just needs to throw better roman chokes against good teams and is too stubborn to adjust defense a bit worst from last year but still great
150 the entire official ravens group on facebook it is soooo bad regarding roman i obviously dont think he needs to be fired but some of the plays this guy has been calling with the type of run talent we have have been so boring he doesnt really try anything fancy or creative seeing what kc is doing with tyreek what cleveland is doing with odell what la is doing with robert woods has been extremely eye openingfun to watch duvernay is begging for more touches and looks this guy is something special in our offense and he needs to be used more same with brown get them involved in more cheeky plays we have speed but we arent using it just hammering the ball up the middleover and over again

includes

how the ravens played with just 10 men on their 4th and 6 play and just how difficult that is for an offense

kc getting leveon bell is that a done deal now any source besides the usual speculation
because he liked some kc stuff we see this all the time even instagram videos of players together until i see someone report it its all just speculation im not playing these guessing games
goodell must intervene dammit they cannot let lev go to the chiefs or steelers i fucking dont care if he goes to any other teams
at what point do we say fck it sign ab

never
calm down
at what point do you realize its never gonna happen and stop making these dumbass posts
ab can be signed after week 8 right
in week 9 when hes cleared to play
why do people care where bell goes its not 2017 anymore hes washed
i dont understand why so many people on this sub seem to think signing ab would be some sort of magical solution the dude is probably on the decline at this point and he would just be a huge distraction
edc is on the phone man chill and ab is not happening
i dont know how anyone that has observed antonios behavior would want him on the team i feel bad for him but there is no way i would sign him

nice quality work
i wish i knew how to do that lol

tldr he goooood

worth reading though

my 1 year analysis

this guy is fucking awesome
not bad for a 5th rounder
for those interested since joining the ravens peters has 5 interceptions 199 interception return yards 1 forced fumble 1 recovered fumble 2 tds 1 sack 14 batted passes and 55 tackles in 15 games he has been targeted 93 times allowing 55 completions 59 completion rating for 580 yards 105 yards per completion and allowed 3 tds this is all good for a 657 passer rating a qb with a 657 passer rating would be 35th out of 35 this year of passers with at least 14 passes per game and 34th of 34 last year with the same metric a 657 passer rating against would put a cb anywhere from 5th to 15th in a typical year

meanwhile on the other side since peters arrival humphrey has 2 interceptions 8 return yards 3 forced fumbles 0 recovered fumbles 0 tds 15 sacks 12 passes batted and 76 tackles in 15 games he has been targeted 95 times allowing 57 completions 60 completion rating for 505 yards 885 yards per completion and allowed 2 tds this would be good for a 7248 passer rating a qb with a passer rating of 7248 would rank 32nd of 35 passers with at least 14 attempts per game this year and 34th out of 34 passers with the same metric last year a 7248 passer rating against would put a cb anywhere from 10th to 20th in a typical year

tldr we have two of the best cbs in the game but you already knew that
his first game in seattle really set the tone for the rest of the regular season last year
mp juiceman
lol a 5th rounder and kenny young incredible
such a great move and a lot of fun as a fan it was like a big offseason acquisition and we immediately got to see him play
i love his balance with fruit punch who is much more physical to juicemans ballhawk

j u iceman
what are the odds we land the best ballhawk in the league ed reed has got to be so proud
i was super choked when we didnt draft this guy always dreamt of him opposite of jimmy look at where we are now best dbs in the league
i remember the days where we never get prime player out of free agency and just aging veterans which we can probably squeeze some sweat out of no disrespect to ozzie but decosta making splashes like this make it more exciting
he always makes me laugh on the field hes got a sss vibe to him where he can just annoy the heck out of you if youre playing against him thats ravens football though
mp juicemannnnnnnn
im really glad marcus found a good landing spot in a defense that can accommodate his style of play i miss him on the chiefs and i still wonder if his erratic attitude had to do with bob sutton the general locker room vibe kansas city or what i know he had his theatrics with us but hed be slaying with hb and juan thornhill behind him
hows that mp jersey treating you upjmoran840
eric decosta and ill fucking do it again
if we can sign one of the best defensive players in the league with all sorts of anticswhy the fuck dont we aim for a big signing on the offensive side i heard the falcons might be cleaning the whole house soon and that includes one of the best receiver of all time julio jones who still has some juice left in the tank it wouldnt hurt to try to get him and he can end his career with us instead of somewhere hes likely going to like the fucking jags or something we coulda signed lb 2 years ago or diggs recently bruh honestly it dont hurt to try to get ab dudes crazy but hes going to stretch the field and make our offense dangerous andrews and hollywood have been great but if we dont start getting duvernayproche involved there will be a lot more games that look like week 3 all over again
this may be the best inseason move our fo has ever made certainly turned our d around last year
and today kc signs leveon for nothing the powerful get more powerful nervous but excited for this twoway race to the top

our beak is bigger

you dirty dirty slut
lamar isnt allowed to wear his sick gold tinted oakley visor during games

lamar has talked about how in practice his receivers are getting open and theyre connecting really well but then come game day no one can get separation and hes missing throws obviously the only answer is we need to petition the league to let lamar wear his oakley visor and release faster chief on the rest of the league
clearly brian billick
the real answer is that we need another running back some say we should go for bell but look no further than buck allen in fact hes the answer to any question in these trying times

who should we sign buck allen

whats wrong with greg roman he hasnt consulted enough with buck allen

when is covid going to end when buck allen rises from the west
bro it aint the visor

our ranking last year was bottom 14 of the league and we led the league in tds mate and what we changed from 2019 was pulling roman away fom the passing game and installing a new passing coordinator and still blaming roman instead of watching the film or giving any honest critique that isnt the same regurgitation of roman bad

truth be told lamar isnt looking to snead or boykin and they have been plenty open in all of the 22 film we dont scheme players open we are using our time with a wide point differential in game as an opportunity to test and teach our passing game as well as get lamar under center rather than insanely relying on the pistol formation so stop complaining and let the coaches keep pushing the awfully bad 41 team until we flesh this whole 2020 team out
why would he need to answer for it we are 41 and have had huge leads in the wins not racking up passing yards when you got a big lead
look at the comments from 49ers fans in that thread

someone should tell greg there is this thing called a screen play it takes pressure off your qb

roman is the root of our offensive woes its merely overshadowed by our lack of a receiving core hes great in the run game but it seems he cant come up with creative pass plays to save his life at the moment

we had open receivers at times kap just didnt see them or he missed them the oline could not pass block worth a damn which in turn made kap more nervous and he didnt have time to make more than 1 read it is not all on roman

while roman certainly does deserve the blame for the last place passing attack does he not deserve the credit for a top 4 rushing attack

the dead last ranking has fairly obviously been exacerbated by the fact that the niners simply havent needed to throw the ball in the majority of their games to win when youre blowing out your opponents as the niners had done in the 5 games prior to the panthers you dont need to pass the ball the niners simply havent passed much and its not even close 40 fewer attempts than the 31st ranked team 107 less than the average so the overall stats look much worse than the reality actually is

that being said the frustration with the niners passing is that when theyve needed itit hasnt been there and more to the point if the niners are truly the super bowl contenders that the public think they are then silly things like good defenses shouldnt stop them from doing what they need to do to win a game

so go ahead and blame roman for the 32nd ranked passing attack but if you fail to mention the top 5 rushing attack a second year quarterback horrible receiving corps and a league low passing attempts by a wide margin then youre not telling the whole story

i dont think you understand how bad it actually is re passing game you make it seem as though we dont try to pass because we are putting up so many points just by running that is not true our defense is why we are winning games we cant rely on a run game alone and thankfully the defense has stepped up to carry the weight that our completely god awful passing attack has dropped

when needed re passing game it isnt there but thats just it for it to be there we need to be practicing it even while ahead even if they are just small screens and dump offs while ahead it would just increase kaps snaps and throws so he gets comfortable just because were ahead on games doesnt mean were should run the ball 100 percent of the time and risk injury to our backs

most of these looked quite familiar to what some of us have been saying about the 2020 ravens offense the last quote on the other hand

roman is currently trying to do just that and is still getting blasted however i agree w the other criticisms of him
the top comment on that thread is them complaining about the lackof screens sound familiar lol
edit the link is dead but the headline highlights how the 49ers struggled as well with passing the ball under greg roman

the ravens passing offense is currently only outperforming the abysmal jets and not by much

fortunately the ravens are ranked 3 for rushing yards per game with only the patriots 2 and the browns 1 ahead of them

its an interesting ride searching greg roman on the 49ers sub
we need to put hollywood and duverney in the slot put boykins on the outside with a snead
i hope 6 years was enough time to work on those passing schemes
can we please as a football world stop using raw yards as the main metric for offensive effectiveness in 2020 dvoa we are 19th which while not where we want to be is also fine for now and not worth panicking about

who is burrows why do people add an s to every nfl players name
joe burrow is one tough mf he took an absolute beating and kept getting up and doing his job i really like him

yo that foot is the foot of a future first womens nfl kicker i guarantee it

idk looks like a new bandwagon fan to me lol jk shes adorable hopefully the squad gets the w for her first game
congrats on the lil one my brother excellent choice of clothing
may she never know a ravens loss congrats
beautiful little lj congrats
hold her like a football just dont spike her
her and my sister have the same birthday albeit 33 years apart
congrats whoadie

i agree with harbaugh shutouts are earned and we let them get in field goal range on two 4th down conversions
i dont have a problem with it shutouts are hard and theyre earned if you want one then stop them on every drive if my team was in garbage time to a division rival id want a fg too to fuck their shutout
whats wink upset about that cincy didnt quit even though they were blown out he should be upset that his defense let them get into position to kick that field goal
cincy let burrow get destroyed to try and be competitive when the game was lost in the first quarter
want a shutout stop the other team from scoring its the end of the game no one cares
update wink was calling taylor a pussy
tbf i dont think any dc is too happy about another team scoring on them
seems petty if you ask me the game was ours at that point they played a great game shutouts are always great but garbage time points dont reflect on a defences performance

dang i know her from a friend of mine and shes a really great person sending prayers and wishing all the best
if anyone can kick cancers ass its tucker
super cool to see this from tuck goat on and off the field
man life aint fair shes so fucking young 23 with breast cancer wtf i hope she beats the fuck out of it

thats a take for rravens not rnfl which is where im guessing you were
cant ever support someone who talks shit in another teams sub its just petty and unnecessary
as much as i hate the browns this is an asshole take they have the same record as we do right now and their offense is statistically performing much better across the board their defense isnt but i wouldnt sleep on them this year
yta
thats my hearts desire however they are looking like a formidable opponent hopefully we still wipe em every year but i think the next matchup will be harder for us since ward is back and they are looking like they finally got into rhythm
bernard pierce
never forgot ravenscom once wrote an article comparing him to adrian peterson seriously
got nothin on my boy chester taylor
lorenzo taliefero
the infamous bobby rainey
bernard pierce was good af his second half of his rookie year and never produced again
what about our irish dancing pot dealer
cake day
this guy was so gifted athletically but had no instincts whatsoever
rashaan melvin
bro im fairly certain i still have one of his energy drinks

scratch that im thinking bernard pollard


eagles fans werent exaggerating when they said he sucked

theyve been getting destroyed by good tight ends all season long
from what ive seen the eagles are using gerry to cover the wr3slot so sneadduvernay szn babayy

chiefs are expected to sign leveon thoughts

i think hell be good there because hes talented and its the chiefs but he seems like a bigger ceh not a power back like they need
some people in here will say its not a big deal its a pretty big deal im confident bell was not himself due to gase
i hate this league for allowing this
definitely sucks that they got another offensive weapon that being said theyre gonna score regardless as long as mahomes is there so we just have to make sure we can put up a better offensive showing next time we see them
eli5 how the fuck kc is gonna be able to pay all the talent they have
because that team needed more weapons
rolleyes
itll make it even better when we beat them in the playoffs
honestly i dont care maybe i should and dont know enough about football bell was once a great back maybe he still he is feel like hes probably lost something but is likely still good but its not like the run game was the chiefs big weakness if they had picked up a stud defensive player id feel differently

this just feels like the chiefs making a move they didnt really need to ceh is good and bell predictably ringchasing
cool cool cool
lol its like people forget he was a power back at michigan state and weights 225 he can run between the tackles in short yardage situations its just if another hole is bigger hes going to cut through it
im not a cap genius but werent they the most cashstrapped team in the league how did this happen
checks notes nope running backs still dont matter
fucking golden state chiefs smdh
its frustrating that our fo never goes for huge signs like this a player of that caliber can be the difference between a win and a loss but honestly trade doesnt affect us we already got the chiefs game outta the way theyre only going to do damage to the rest of the league but not us if we meet in the playoffs thats when we should worry but until then were chilling in baltimore
bell makes the chiefs less efficient because they are going to feel like they have to use him and throwing check downs to the rb running the ball is way less efficient than throwing downfield to kelce hill plus they invested a first round pick in a rb who they also have to use

give them separate pages they are different people
the fucking disrespect
its been discussed here before how since we traded hurst we havent had the personnel to run the 3 te sets we ran last season if the seahawks are willing to deal hollister what would you all think he isnt playing much for them right now and they seem to prefer luke wilson thoughts
do we not have a third te on the roster
hollister was awesome last year when he was getting significant playing time so if the price is right this would be a great pick up not sure how he is in the blocking department though
how much is left on the deal if its one year then sure but i doubt we carry 4 tes going into next season and i really love breeland plus we stashed him so i doubt we trade for a te that has more then a year left on there deal
if they were going to offer any of their tight ends im almost positive it would be olsen before the other 2 remember they also traded for hollister to begin with
wasnt this a espn write up we traded hurst away as we had a different vision i dont see us going back on what they want to do even though from what we have seen hasnt been working great

but id be all for it but thats not the area of need


now it will feel that much better when we finally beat them
with their insane running back depth
i literally couldnt care less
locker room distraction maybe until i start hearing reid bumping his awful album im not sold that he will be that impactful chiefs fans everywhere claiming we are unbeatable now though
because that team needs more weapons
this is been a bad year for us and i think this should be a mid scoring game with philadelphia losing by less than ten honestly i wouldve much rather beaten pittsburgh because as you know we play in the same state so the next time some steelers fan tries to tell you that they are pennsylvanias team cough penn state actually is remind them what is on the state flag and the state seal of pennsylvania and which city has over five times the population of pittsburgh our injuries and salary cap issues will not be a good matchup for a strong team like baltimore you guys are a great team to watch and i love the uniforms with the maryland state flag embroidered on the patch oh and yes thank you for demolishing the giants in the super bowl 35 bird solidarity
hey man excited for the game and hopefully it will be fun to watch and no injuries i expect our defense will hold you guys to 2 scores and well have to see how our offense looks lamar doesnt seem comfortable yet but i think its coming maybe even sunday
hey mate
im feeling like it will go the same way as most of our games this season a bit if a grind without looking too flashy get a 2 score lead and then control it from there have also been riding that andrews is in a favourable match up this week so im excited for that i wear his jersey during games
most ravens fan would like to see lj8 have a big game just for entertainment purposes as much as anything
also expect peters and humphrey to get turnovers especially if the eagles are chasing points and taking a few risks throwing into coverage
i tell what is hard though working out if i want the browns or steeles to lose
the ravens are favored by 75 so vegas thinks the game will be close between us with you guys getting your great strong safety back now it should be interesting with the ravens offense vs the eagles defense because the iol is a mess right now and the eagles dl should feast but whereas before that didnt matter as mark andrews would be open most of the time now you get parks back which means mandrews will have a far harder time and a far more equal matchup andrews vs parks is a 6040 slay vs hollywood is like 9010 and i think our other wrs outside of duvernay arent good enough to feast on your bad cb23 as for the run game i expect it to struggle because the iol is still a mess maybe if we put mekari as starting rg thats if philipps isnt back we can do a lot more guard pulling which we did last year with yanda like last year which would benefit the run game a ton if the ravens run game dominates i see them winning big because then the pass game is opened up as for the eagles offense vs ravens defense i dont have any real confidence in the eagles offense beating the ravens defense the eagles ol is injured to death missing the starting lt rt tackle 3 is also injured in peters and lg this should allow the ravens dl to feast like it did on another bad ol in the bengals to make matters worse wentz is far less mobile then burrow as for weapons your goeddert te2 who is really good is out with injury ertz is underperforming heavily i think hes mad about contract situation jackson and jeffrey are both hurt and there status is questionable ward has really nice hands and chemistry with wentz but hes just ok fulgham just had one great game and idk what to think of him and lastly reagor has looked really nice so far but he hasnt built chemistry with wentz yet lets say the eagles have back jackson and jeffrey i still see jackson locked up by humphrey and jeffrey likely by jimmy smith peters cant do that with the size difference as for the run game i really like miles sanders hes a fun back to watch but with that amount of injuries on top of the fact that hes more of an outside runner which means the tackles matter a ton just makes me think his biggest impact is out of the backfield as a passing back because the dl is going to be smacking around the eagles ol all day i think this is either a low scoring game by both sides or a high scoring game by the ravens essentially a complete rebound with the eagles scoring like 1017 i have the eagles under 195 points on the game and feel damn good about it

edit sorry for the wall of text im typing this on phone so its harder to tell where i should tab the paragraphs
hey bro should be a fun game but as another commenter said andrews will probably have a big day you guys have trouble covering tes like him if you can get sanders going in the screen game and ertz back to fashion running quick block and release plays then you have a chance otherwise wentz hanging in the pocket equals big plays for us battle of the birds game on

also people can say what they want about philly fans but this is a cool way to approach a conversation about our teams good on ya wish i could get a cheese steak from jims right now
eagles are good team but right now beating the eagles or any other nfc east team wouldnt bring us any joy tbh we set our goals on bigger things and were hopeful to do that
what happened to ertz hes barley been getting targets
we are going to win

thanks for stopping by
ah the classic philadelphia friendly discussion i am familiar with it

three afc north teams in top 10 oh boy
how the fuck are the steelers 3 they are not better than the bills packers or ravens
let them sleep well wake them up soon enough
keep your shitty articles out of here
im just curious because i dont see people talking about this much vs the bengals he had 2 attempts and iirc both were unplanned scrambles

so what is the speculation injury he was on injury reports before the bengals game and took some days off practice but physically he has looked fine in these games just look at the 50 yard td

mentally i dont see him having as much fun out there as he did last year cbs shows isos of him on the sidelines often so we can generally get an idea of his mood and usually that mood is having fun and being whacky with hollywood and mark ingram but even when they were handily beating the texans he looked all serious and at times miserable he was looking a lot better vs the bengals but still no planned runs
teams have overplayed lamars stretch runs to the outside all year the ravens generally dont call designed runs for lamar up the middle that is a big reason for his statistical decline in that department

there is a plus side to this while overpursuing lamar teams have left the weakside of the play open more often than not thus running pitch plays and stretch runs opposite lamars momentum have been highly effective duvernay dobbins had big runs counter to lamars momentum against cincy

i also believe the ravens replaced some of his stretch runs with rollout pass attempts
i think hes hurt and the fo is being coy about it
in regards to the sideline and him not having as much fun

last year not huge expectations and really took the league by storm

the thing is he lost to the titans when he did have the expectation to win people arent calling him a playoff winner due to the past two years

i just think hes taking things more serious and really wants prove the doubters wrong again that loss vs kc this year didnt help either
but the thing is the 50 yard run happened like longest of his career
john harbaugh decosta and lamar all offseason lamar is going to run less this year

lamar runs less this year

fans
i think they are trying to develop him more as a passer i dont buy into the whole injury thing why risk your franchise qb who won the mvp at 2223 its not like his time is ticking we have a relatively young squad

and in all honesty i dont think many people expect us to be winning the super bowl this year so i dont understand the reasoning to play through an injury not to mention the fact that we have rg3 as a back up yh he isnt the rg3 of old but in terms of back ups thats a pretty good one to have

in order to get over the hump of beating the titans and the chiefs lamar needs to become a better passer so why not develop his passing i think he knows that which is probably why he hasnt been having as much fun because rn he isnt where he wants to be as a passer i think his mindset is now superbowl or bust
take away all of the steelers wins and theyre winless
the designed runs havent worked since week 1 it seems like teams actually did study the film and prepared better on stopping him combined with the few tweaks hes had to his lower body already

which im kinda fine with theres going to be growing pains because now this is basically a new offense and thats why his numbers arent great but were still scoring points and winning games and theres a lot of season left for him and the offense to get more comfortable
something is definitely up you dont go from breaking michael vicks rushing record one season to being at the bottom of the league in quarterback rushing the next season out of coincidence
yeah im actually glad hes running less cause weve won a most of our ws pretty easy and i dont want lamar running with the game in the bag just like i dont want lamar sitting in the pocket waiting for a deep route to get open when were winning the game by a healthy margin
they literally talked about this ad nauseam on 1057
didnt lamar and harbaugh say that lamar was gonna run less this year
im not sure whats going on im hoping they they just arent looking to open the play book on should win games the line was struggling the first few games but seemed to have it together against the bengals going that can set up the run game again
first he ran too much hes not gonna last now he doesnt run enough he must be injured i need everybody to stfu and just watch damn
theres only two stats that matter points for and points against
if you remove all lamars long runs he doesnt have any long runs are we worried about this guys
you play to win the game

hello

fucking love that purple one
that purple one is fucking awesome i think the third one is a little too similar to the saints though
first one is dope but i dont want to look at lamar in steelers colours
1st one dope afff the 3rd one looks too much like the saints
number 1 and 3 are fire
so no one is disgusted to see lamar in black and gold first one looks great
number one is the one that needs to get grouped with the purple chrome helmet a post was discussing a while back on here
oh my god the purple and the gold one are litt
yo 1 and 3 are sickkk
dope designs especially love the first one side note lamar could make our old purple on gold unis look good
damn it would be so cool if teams had bca jerseys like this where they keep the teams main color and add in pink as a secondary color would be awesome and im sure selling the jerseys would raise a butt ton of money to fight breast cancer really cool idea the other jerseys are sick too
the first and third one are but that second is just a little to purple but you got the talent keep up the great work
this would be sooo tuff
not a ravens fan but the third one is
that is fresh
dang its been so long since the league has done bca that i forgot what the pink unis looked like reminds me of my younger years playing mut with all the pink unis comin out now
i fw the gold heavy man
what would the first one look like if you replaced the white with gold instead
i would try 1 without the white outline like this

edit this is the qb practice jersey
ravens jerseys need purple in them enough said
i agree the third one looks a bit much like the saints colors but it still looks hella dope first one is even more dope second one is dope too but looks like a breast cancer awareness week uni not that thats a bad thing obviously
although it does look a bit too much like the saints love the third
i hate the steelers but that black and gold looks cleeaaannn
first and last one are mint
how do you change the colors and keep the shadow looking the same
first ones go hard as fuck
the first ones go hard as fuck
first one looks ice cold bro good work
the last one kind of looks like a saints jersey
why is lamar holding a cigarette s
delete the golden one
sweet jesus tomorrow is last 2am game day after the bye itll be 3am followed by 3 1020am game days
what are you talking about
guam represent game day is 3 am for me
what would be beneficial for us in the standings if the browns or if the steelers won tomorrow

i hope they both lose
itd be better for the steelers to lose since theyre currently undefeated
browns winning would be more beneficial to us
a steelers loss
down vote me all you want but i think the browns are the bigger threat
a tie
i hope the steelers stay undefeated until we play them would be amazing to hand them their first loss the same way we handed the patriots their first loss last season
browns have an easier remaining schedulethan us and the steelers so a loss would definitely be more beneficial but a steelers loss would feel better no doubt
covid outbreak the new meteor
personally i think its a very bad look but its being blown out of proportion ie rnfl doing what it always does some people are even saying that they hope lamar gets hit hard so he learns in regards to the actual situation i thought lamar was above that hopefully he just flopped for shits and giggles and didnt think they were actually gonna penalize the defender if he actually tried to get a penalty out of that then he is absolutely in the wrong
im not sure what the hell youre talking about
every team in every sport will flop and sell penalties
its a very bad look but its being blown out of proportion

my exact thoughts nobody likes to see flopping in any sport but rnfl will have you believe he is singlehandedly responsible for the flopping trend and the only guilty actor

i hate cheating in sports as it completely takes away from the point of the competition it is bizarre though that in a sport in which peds are common and gamesmanship is every teams mantra that a singular incident is considered too far

lamar does it again give him shit and fine him but keep that same energy for other incidents as well
the amount of patriots fans acting outraged in the thread makes me chuckle a little bit
he just shouldntve said anything the problem is lamar is so wholesome he came out and said he flopped most athletes just leave it at that
receivers call for a flag literally every single time they dont catch a ball and the coverage is good deandre hopkins pushes off on cbs every time he catches a ball people need to get over it
i dont understand why people hate flopping so much
eh receiversdbs have gratuitously faked being interfered with since the beginning of time acting playing up an offense to encourage a favorable penalty call is an integral part of all sports
tom brady didnt even have to flop if you just touched him wrong he got a bonus 15
why does this sub get sooo worked up about what happens on rnfl

have you guys not learned already how trash it is

use your own judgement flopping is wrong but every team in every sport will flop or something similar to gain an advantage its just part of sports these days its all theatrical and im sure its encouraged unfortunately
i think theres no situation lmao every qb in the league flops at least once per game and this has been going on for decades it truly makes you wonder if the posters over there have ever watched tom brady play a game

thats not even getting into all the wrs who start tripping over themselves if a db lays a finger on him this isnt some newfangled strategy the kids are trying because they watched too much basketball its just something that players do have always done and will always do

night shift and nonamerican bros where you at
i appreciate the extreme specificity of that
roll call
looks like iggles are on the menu boys
5 more minutes
need to just blitz wentz they have a 3rd string lt and third string rg starting today
caw caw
game day babyyy time to stunt
nobody is safe on the eagles today nobody is safe biggggggg trussss
wha wha big truss
literally just a picture i took of a raven
ayyyyyeee
from wentz we will sack
wooooooooooo
cacaw
first game in forever im more excited to see the defense take the field not even a slight on the offense i just miss our dominating defensive stands wentz gonna be running for his life today
its 1134 am you liar

ive bought from chinese sites before theyve been great quality but shipping will probably take 2 months or so bc of covid

nah bro youre just fuckin yolked
probably a chinese distribution i learned with the hats from lids the tight forehead brims that have to be broken in 9 out of 10 times come from a chinese manufacturer
i went down from a medium to a small because mine was too big

i kinda want to make this a tradition im into these retro computer graphics lately nostalgia is naturally a part of getting old haha
reminds me of this class i took on digital archaeology we had to use ancient computers and learn how to use them then we had to pick one and do some kind of project some kids chose to use the original paint software to make images like this

i wound up adapting the add adventure for
acereraks tomb of horrors into hypercard on a macintosh ii for my project
holy shit this is amazing
nice job dude
space
is that a iic
this is great i love it
this is pretty neat
the best part might just be the 3 players you chose lamarclon i also love the layout of lamar in the middle as a qb flanked by two cbs plus how they all come out to 8 4 4 8 2 x 4 8 suggestion for your next 3 campbell in the middle flanked on either side by stanley andrews so it similarly goes offensedefenseoffense andrews in the middle might work well too since then itd be linemantight endlineman
damn can you convert this to a modern desktop background how would that work like to truly capture the vibe i feel like a pic of the monitor is the best way vs the actual image file or whatever

i say we get lamar to throw as much as possible before the playoffs
expect another pass heavy game this week their backs are the worst at covering tight ends i expect another game to try and get the passing clicking on all cylinders
lets get it bugged out now if we can hang 27 points on an off day i look forward to see lamars progression i am following bylaw number 3 protect lamar at all costs even if it means flaming our oc
wheres the coaching hes looked bad throwing the past 4 weeks now why arent the coaches really putting him in a position to succeed like they did last year is it just a mental block for him he looked so good throwing week one and he made some passes against the texans hes been terrible ever since the chiefs game though someone get this guy back his mojo

cant wait for no country for big ben
first play of the game lol you called it
every week this season i will be doing a crappy photoshop for our matchup here are the past weeks submissions

week 1 don lamar

week 2 the texans chainsaw massacre

week 3 over the top

week 4 he got game

week 5 gladiator
this aged very well
im coming for that booty carson
strip sack
aged like keanu reeves

reeeeeaallly well

i got downvoted a little bit in rnfl for saying that while i agree flopping isnt cool ive seen mahomes and big ben do it lol
receivers call for a flag literally every single time they dont catch a ball and the coverage is good deandre hopkins pushes off on cbs every time he catches a ball people need to get over it
tom brady didnt even have to flop

if you got dirt on his uniform he got an extra 15
this isnt news
ironically the commenter with the most shit to say is actually one of our own anyone notice that

why the hell is he advocating for someone to rough up lamar
that thread is a prime example of why rnfl sucks
im not a fan of it but unfortunately its a part of the game i wish it wasnt that way though players are too finesse nowadays half the time a wr goes deep hes looking for pi more than the ball
i criticized mahomes for this heavily against the patriotsi cant be a hypocrite cmon lamar in a blowout
everyone does it on all sports too its part of sports these days whether thats right or wrong its theatrical you do what you can to give your team and advantage it is what it is

but lamar is too honest this is the second time this year hes been to honest and too much of a nice guy in what he says he got to reel back a bit and keep quiet
look at all the saints in rnfl pretending that their players dont flop
well he did say he wants to be as good as brady some day
i still think it was a pretty dumb play by dunlap
lol look at the amount of downvotes i have on that thread for simply explaining that everyone does it it pains me to see that its not only rnfl but other ravens fans that are thick as pig shit
lol
well uh i guess those penalties just got offset by the terrible calls against the other bird team so
yeah if hes going to do that which id rather he not id also he rather not talk about it flopping in a blowout dumb

low effort sure but it really encapsulates the spirit of the people around here
idk man seems like you worked pretty hard on it to me
king shit
lamar good
lamar murray

i just want to say i found this funny but i also want to provide some backstory

apparently the real santa was a no show due to dubious reasons possibly contaning alcohol for a christmas half time thingy and they instead got some random eagles fan to dress up as santa and do it instead eagles fans threw snowballs the fake santa thought it was funny and played along fun was had by all and nobody was hurt sidenote the eagles were having an atrocious season in 1968 and were in the middle of yet another bad game against the vikings so eagles fans were pretty bitter and this was a good way to release some tension



and apparently there was some battery throwing thing in the 90s but that was a phillies game with phillies fans
for context eagles fans threw rocks and batteries at santa

nflbite
i used nflbite every week
bilasportnet has been my go to for both ufc events and football games
its on the nfl app this week
sportsurge
batman stream or something like that
this may be common knowledge already i just found out jamison tweeted that with the 3 picks we sent for the 32nd they drafted dallas goedert avante maddox and miles sander its crazy both sides ended up winners in the trade
its crazy both sides ended up winners in the trade

that is what most good trades should be
i never thought to follow up on who they got but yeah thats a pretty good move for them

miles sanders is gonna terrorize the nfc east when he stays healthy and they beef up the line a bit goedert is solid and maddox is a smart player but gets burned if he ups his speed hell be dangerous

and they went and got jalen hurts last year who was my favorite qb in the draft

fuck philly in general but they rocked that trade and didnt waste the picks
i live outside of philly so i am friends with a ton of eagles fans they all enjoyed that they drafted the te i had at the top of my board with our 52nd pick

im happy with the trade though obviously lol
espn just posted the kc buffalo trade for the 10th pick and thats another one where both trades worked out fantastically for both teams
related to barry sander
if only the eagles could start winning some games

not that i care just saying
goedert has a ceiling of elite tight end he reminds me a ton of andrews except with slightly more size and slightly less athletic maddox is a okish number two cb miles sanders is a versatile rb who is a great outside runner and good in the passing catching area id say hes probably top 5ish as a pass catching back
were big mad baby

found it


no kink shaming here guys
if youre just looking for the picture google images probably has it

big koch dekochsta
cock

well shit who is gonna be our quarterback now
oof wolfe and williams being out sucks but madubuike had a pretty good game against the bengals and the eagles are playing mostly backups besides the c
thank for marcus and jimmy werent on that list saw they were questionable before the game
guess mcphee will play all over the line
i know hes a good special teamer but i really wish we would have got rid of chris moore he is useless on offense and i havent really seen a difference yet on special teams with him gone the last 5 weeks
dang wolfe and williams
wow moore is fully healthy and an inactive hes totally getting cut if he cant carve out a role on st then hes gone
sooooo maybe justice hill gets a turn at the ball today

derek carr when the loud voice in his headset calls to pass it to the fullback on the flat
yes mr president yeah i love oranges too
i really want to see him have 1012 carries today dude is shot out of a cannon every time he touches the ball
they need to quit dicking around with the rookies duvernay and jk have both proven to be more than capable than the starters we have now

just in case you guys were unaware faker mayfield just threw a pick 6
lamar has really struggled with his touch on the ball this year
confiscate that air horn
we need to play 100x better vs pittsburgh
i mean thats not surprising they got like 9 tries for that td inside the 10
the demise of our quaterback has been exaggerated
hope youre not bored as they show the depressed eagles fans lmao
where tf is our oline
the receiver pushes off and we get dpi this game is bullshit
instead of getting angry lets just laugh at the browns instead lol thats what always makes me feel better
seriously annoyed with all the extra plays from penaltys
have refs called a holding on any team weve played yet this year
a comedy about needing a kidney have we hit bottom yet
can these sorry fools catch the ball lamar needs to throw it better too
execute whoever is doing that horn shit
hightower survived the fruitpunch

im not actually mad at that possession that was just good defensive plays by philly getting back to back swats
lamar first drive

33 35 yards td 1549 passer rating
rravens liked that
hey falconscan we have julio please we have some good 5th round picks to give you fair deal
charles davis is 100x better than dan fouts
ravens 30

eagles 0

refs 22

covid 19
lamar such a baller
jackson getting murdered by drops receivers need to be better
bro can they save hurtss coming out party for their next game
i thought u couldnt benefit from a forward fumble on offense unless the defense touches it
lamar is second coming of christ and theres no way you can convince me otherwise
boykin running the wrong route man that never happens
you get 10 chances youre gonna score
harbaugh is gonna need another belt because i assume hes going to wear his current one out whooping the absolute fuck out of the oline
remember pats got beat by broncos chiefs lost to raiders last week texans took the titans to ot 9ers got ran by dolphins

it wasnt a fun win but its a win put it in the w column and work on the penalties and offense to click again move into the bye 51
im so tired of the guys its the 1st quarter chill out comments our offense has looked off since week 2 its cause for concern
i cant fucking stand those people that label fake fans as people who have legitimate valid concerns about this offense being a fan doesnt mean being blind to the teams issues
first two receivers to catch a ball

duvernay

boykin
this defense has potential to be historic
best kicker in nfl history
kick that guy with the horn out
how the fuck is this horn legal
i have a sinking feeling were gunna get exposed by the steelers next week this team other than the defense looks shitty right now
if marlon tackles you youre fumbling
boykin is michael thomas minus the awareness hands route running iq and being michael thomas
funny all of the relax guys comments are awfully quiet how usually when we all realize something and call it out it ends up being more true than some like to realize weve been calling out these same stupid mistakes for a while now
you just got scored on by nick boyle
that was good improvisation on that
our offense looks neutered
is it just me or do lamars mechanics look worse this season
dobbins im open

also dobbins jk
1 kill the guy with the air horn
2 lamar needs to step into his throws
we need to run the heisman package to assert dominance
eagles on the board no lmao
duvernay has already contributed in 6 games what boykin has in like 22
boykin and a 5th for julio
defense is tired as fuck
this commentary is 100 better than last weeks crew
remember when we were saying the ravens offense looks horrendous this is what we were worried about you let teams hang around and now its a one possession game with the eagles totally in it now
absurd penalty
these refs gifting this game to them
12 penalties for 132 yards vs 3 penalties for 20 yardseither phillys depth players are that much more disciplined than bmores starters or shawn smiths crew had it out for the ravens today meanwhile all day long i saw the eagles linemen lining up the same way as stanley zeus plus committing false starts a splitsecond prior to the snap and holding galore yet they were rarely if ever called for it the pi on peters was egregiously erroneous as was fergusons apparent roughing the passer penalty
guys we are up 70 in the first quarter can we stop acting like the sky is falling just bc we had a one drive without scoring lol
lamar determined not to run it looks like he had an open lane there
these tipped balls are going to become pick 6s eventually
apex ball hawks has a nice ring to it
campbell has absolutely earned his contract so glad we got him
scariest part about this eagles team is their backup quarterback it seems
damn lamar probably be killing this d in practice then lmao
lamar can still burn babbyyyyy
i mean honestly can we just run the rpo every play
humphrey is insane
lol hightower spun to avoid the punch totally changed his run because of the fruit punch
good thing we have a bye next week because the team needs a good shellacking
mental mental mental mental mental mental mental i dont think i have ever seen us have so many mental breakdowns in a single game before
i seriously hope john harbaugh rips the offense a new one and doesnt give some happy happy bs talk
170 to this weve gotta get better
refs are favoring the eagles and not even trying to hide it
i havent been so irritated watching a game in so long
oh my gosh roman not abandoning the run a nice balanced drive is this real life
oline gonna have to step up more today
averett is getting better by the week if ya ask me
pass game getting worse by the week
that is a disgustingly bad route concept on 3rd and 13th
i will shove that air horn up the owners ass
can someone kill the guy with the airhorn
i blame the air horn
dude with the air horn needs to be castrated
philadelphia run a better 2 qb set then we did lmfaooooo
the air horn guy proves that even with limited fans eagles fans are the assholes of the league
imagine if judon makes the tackle its 2nd and 15 and that probably never happens
rpo it just works
havent seen a called run for lamar in a while

charles davis
humphrey is the defensive mvp so far this season
boykin never seems to know what fucking route hes running
lamar throwing to boykin with him no where within 15 yards name a more iconic duo
ward singlehandedly gave them a touchdown
it was good as soon as he stepped on the field
some confusion between mark andrews and lamar jackson leads to ravens blowing a timeout and an animated conversation between qb and te

jeffzrebiec
second drive in a row where lamar has looked good second drive in a row where his great work has been undone by the offensive line

i hope they get lit the fuck up this whole bye week because these penalities are shit you shouldnt see in amateur leagues let alone the highest level
even gene agrees
proche is now in harbs good book great special teams play
nerves calmed
dd and boykin both with a 3rd and long catch you love to see it
this defense is sick even if we had the old offense id still be pumped about this team

ingram crazy enough seems like a good back for today with how bad the ol is playing his patience is helping the poor ol play
he said the gus bus
all gas no brakes

no stops on the gus bus
dobbs you got to hold onto that
wentz is about to get mariotad by the ravens go for 12 sacks d
when the ravens defense sacks carson wentz i think to myself yes
omg the horn is annoying af
fuckin air horn
i took a peek at the eagles thread most of the complaints i saw were about the horn that keeps going off i have to agree that it is annoying
just in case you guys are wondering air horns are banned at lincoln financial
these desperate plays by philly might work some but theyre sad
just hit both of their qbs on every play
god these drops are helping us big time
kc has absolutely ruined romans play calling ability
if i was the qb of the philadelphia eagles id be taking out life insurance


easy field goal

lamar jackson ya cant do that
how does no one get open in 8 seconds
i love you lamar jackson
llama safely keeping a 6 feet distance over defenders
marlon is an absolute legend at the punch
fruit puuuuunch
humphrey is quickly becoming one of my alltime favorite ravens
why is he so fucking good at that lmao
marlon humphry is one punch man
fyi nfl record for forced fumbles in a year is 10 marlon is at 4 in 6 games on pace for about that record
defense has been pretty stout the whole game they have spent a lot of time on the field if the offense could have capitalized on all those punts they forced earlier then none of this would matter
marlon is gonna make them pay if they keep targeting him lol only a matter of time
davis is a very good commentator have to say
john going to make them come in on monday for all these damn penalties
roughing the passer the defender not beating inertia according to the refs
our o line is so bad man i really think thats the core of all our problems
yeah this is not going to be a happy bus ride back to baltimore

134 yards in penalties what a fucking joke
trade for julio
time to go watch flacco with the jets
that was a disgusting juke by lamar
christ that was sexy
humphrey is the best corner in the league
matt judon is gonna get 2 unblocked sacks today and his price will skyrocket
my friend whos a steelers fan is trying to say the steelers have had a tough schedule
lamar had all of 1 second there
yeah calm down guys haha we cant score every possession
calais campbell is killing it out there great play
i hope marks okay also lamar avoided disaster there
ok lamar is just off this year
well now this is looking like shit offense is still looking rough something needs to change
if our defense was average we would be 14
lamar is clearly dealing with a knee issue he is so much slower on the edge the past few games
is it unpopular to think mark ingram is weighing the running game down
lmao why are the ravens in third place on that chart
you nfc east

the guy she tells you not to worry about afc north
someone needs to find the horn guy and take him out
if you bring an air horn to a game you should get in a car accident
uh fans are not allowed to have air horns can the stadium staff take that away they are trying to imitate whistles
whoever has the horn need a to be kicked out like what the fuck is that
horns annoying as fuck
i guess i cant be mad because its 170 but man the offense looks bad
whys lamar sidearming everything
good news is that i think they killed horn guy
the browns fucking suck lol
browns reality check

ya love to see it
these fucking offensive penalties holy shit seven
i dont understand what happened to our offense
lamar needs to know when to throw it away but man the penalties are killing us also our wrs need to get open
judon missed 3 tackles today 2 should have been tfl

lamar haters wya now lets talk
marlon dpoty im never gonna get tired of saying it
im getting to the point expecting a fumble on every tackle
marlon punches the ball out literally every game lmao
another play where boykin and lamars chemistry was off
lmao another play where boykin and lamar arent on the same page
play duvernay over boykin everybody on the sideline said lamar was right for throwing that pass and boykin wasnt there
i wish lamar would try some passes down field instead of slants and check downs
penalties today have been killer not the whole story obviously but terrible none the less
penalties on offense and defense have been horrible today
that was on malik harrison missed his assignment in the flat
oline wanna see me get a bunch of penalties wanna see me do it again
who knew when we brought in tucker that hed go on to be the most accurate kicker ever
isnt it crazy how our offense has looked lackluster and we still scored 30 this bye week should be good if our offense clicks well be unstoppable
double coverage and no one could knock that away
ravens really need to look at themselves this bye week cause this aint it
w or l harbaugh going to rip into them after the game completely undisciplined with these penalties
the refs are actually fucking us bowser got tackled in the backfield and fulgham started that interference
d has been lazy these last eagles drives and dont bring up theyre tired we had time of possession by over 12 minutes at the start of the 4th q
play like a falcon
this is the sloppiest game weve played all year
one team having 7x more penalty yards than the other isnt fucking normal so frustrating
the amount of penalties today have been unacceptable even though 12 should not have been called but seriously 12 wow
that dropped interception by elliot looking a lot more depressing now eh
whatever it counts as a win
i miss yanda
ingram just isnt doing it for me anymore
28 games of 20 points is pretty insane tbh
big dick nick
this the lamar i know we back baby
two third down conversions on 3rd and 10 by passing

thats the kind of thing that will be key to long term growth great start
that was solid but i am worried about all these damn rollouts i would think g ro would have figured it out after all these weeks the slant to duvernay was amazing we need more of those
browns doing browns things lol pick 6
julie ertz husband cant escape the hump
lmfao why do teams try to target humphrey it aint going to go very well for them
our line is still shakey
too many near interceptions dammit
i clinched my ass too hard just now on that throw
gus is literally a cannonball
that was the quote of the year by the playbyplay guy

up 140 in the first quarter and 41 and the offense hasnt clicked all that well yet

my point exactly
the bengals are putting an ass kicking on the colts just to show that 273 games dont come easy
lol that paper person ad needs to be a super bowl commercial xd
philly is booing we are healing as a nation
i think the biggest problem with game day threads is that fans are now used to us putting the game away as early as possible
triggered by the graphic showing browns ahead of us
that is fantastic coverage by chris board
damn thats some insane coverage from board
we need to come up with a new nickname for calais campbell he is the second coming of haloti ngata
wink really heard you guys bitching about the pass rush
was calais campbell our biggest off season pick up i mean figuratively not literally literally he definitely was
calais campbell is washed my ass
calais campbell has been my favorite offseason pick up ever man
that horn is annoying af
im gonna fucking murder the horn fucker
why do some of you even watch football lol anything we do makes you angry
i love the how on earth will we beat the steelers comments as if steelers didnt play philly extremely close
is anyone else hearing the air horn every time the baltimores offense is about to run a play
i can hear marlon screaming lol
why would we call a timeout just to not do anything
oh come on thats roughing
what a bullshit roughing call
for those trying to blame lamar solely for these throws you need to be looking at the drops are receivers are having that one that got tipped wasnt even for the receiver who jumped up and tipped it
dumb to take the sack there
harbaugh should tell lamar he gets a 2k bonus if he doesnt side arm it for a game
super questionable play by lamar
here we go if our offense cant pull their shit together now eagles have momentum bad place to be
i may be completely misremembering but i thought there was a rule that the ball cant be fumbled forwards unless the player who fumbled recovers the ball
critiques actual football plays


yall omg lmao are you guys bandwagons our offense has 100 passing yards against the worst secondary in football were doing enough
yo what happened to the vibes in here im not even talking about the ravens game im talking seemed like a bunch of haters came in here
everyone liked that
i love when lamar breaks away like that i could cry its so beautiful
2019 ravens
fuck running to the outside lets go up the middle
campbell for defensive player of week
that counts towards his stats right
marlon humphreys punchout
were calling those fruit punches for now on sorry fbi agent peanut tillman
dude baltimore defense is fucking amazing 3 decades of greatness legendary players year after year
boykin not being where lamar thought he should be im shocked
get boykin off the field
i love how the coaches talk up boykin because it makes them look really stupid rn
that was a fucking trip but were not getting any calls going our way
stopping them after giving them 10 plays inside the redzone is a tough ask
9 penalties for 63 yards
wtf they picked
marlon chill bro dont hurt yourself
tucker crushed that kick
that was actually an ok drive defense got rested and watered plus we got some points not to hateful
what a hold by sam koch
that was good from 70
i feel like if we fix the o line our offense is going to work a lot better
this offense makes zero sense
tuck is so damn good i know we all know that and say it all the time but damn man hes so good
put ertz on ice save him for when your good again hes too good of te to get him killed out there today
lamar just said on the sideline he doesnt have time
i cant believe theyre letting this shitty ass team stick around
im over it win or lose it wont change how i feel our offense needs a huge revamp
bruh how tf can your penalty calls be so onesided
all im asking for is a first down i cant believe im hoping for this but come on man our o is so unsynchronized
we need this bye week bad go study the playbook and wear a fucking mask guys
i dont agree with the whole we didnt deserve to win this because i think we did deserve it but this definitely was an ugly win
i understand we have issues on offense lamar is off oline is not really good receivers are practically nonexistent run game has regressed a lot now after you read all this whining look at the fucking eagles its still fucking good to be a ravens fan
if i marry marlon as is the plan i will invite you all to the wedding
duveryay
look i just want to say this duvernay seems to be doing a lot more than boykin has this season
that double fakeout was beautiful
dont be shy come on doubt lamar some more come on whered ya go
holy shit lamar was slick there
lol 2 bad runs and the sub calling for ingram to be benched and then 2 good runs and hes acceptable
that was such a good drive utilized almost everyone didnt abandon the run sharp passing by lamar hopefully they can keep this up for the rest of the season
lol baker just pulled a baker
eagles fans sick already
humphrey is so good
damn those eagles fans look liketheyre having a bad time
not good opening for dobbins
removed
calais campbell should not be as great of a finesse guy at 68 he was in the backfield damn near instantly
where is you throwing lamar
fire greg roman
if nothing else we drafted jk as insurance for ingram

so for the love of god do not rush ingram back in while he is hurt
lamar clearly not at his fastest with whatever groinknee thing hes suffering from but yet hes still way faster than every other qb except maybe murray
classic ravens football lmao defense elite offense suspect the good thing is that lamar playing through a slump flacco in a slump boller in his prime
ravens nice af
god i love our defense set us up so nicely for that babydrive and td
so is our defense good enough this year to carry us

might just be a classic ravens team again

that ad was fucking odd
that one was on dobbins
easy first down dobbins come on

edit bailed by a penalty but come on
seems like dobbins just needs to synch up with lamar slightly more they will get there
miscommunication there not inaccuracy

when you operate w rookies that happens at times
tucker is such a luxury man

my heart rate didnt rise all when i saw 46 yd attempt lmao
wentz might die today
wentz may legit die today jfc their line is horrible
calais campell is just a large large person
really appreciate proche at pr this year no non sense gets 510 yards every time love to see it
campbell was a fucking steal edc the damn goat
wtf is going on with these penalties jesus
something its way off with this offence its just not in the same page
fuck phillyfucking horn blowing trash
philly fans and being complete garbage humans name a better combo
that air horn cannot be allowed
someone shove the air horn up that guys ass
a lot of complaining we were 1st and damn 35 why risk ints when we are up 170 safe plays safe runs we will have another shot


that airhorn though that shit is annoying
are they trying to pull a 2018 us on us
and let us say

fuck off the field
that is a fucking horrendous call
weak sauce call not mad with calais
that is an awful roughing the passer call holy shit
im confident out offense will be better after the bye historically were damn good after bye weeks
all that matters is how everybody decides to play come playoffs dont peak too soon
when is the last time lamar had 100 passing yards at the half he needs to get upto 200 yds a game hes done well spreading the ball but our targets outside of 15 and 89 dont look like theyre part of the team
challenge unlocked start every offensive drive with a 1st and 15

lamaybe just throw that one away
wtf lamar gotta throw it away
just throw it away man we are playing dumb football all of our mistakes have been mental errors blown coverages late hits false starts not lining up on the line
what the fuck is wrong with our route concepts why are wrs all in the same spot running into each other down field that is honestly so unacceptable execution is one thing but scheme shouldnt be so terrible
on that replay 2 receivers ended up in the same location with 3 eagles the route combos are effed up
cant be mad at elliott just no one there to recover it for us
the way this sub loses its shit whenever someone scores a td is hilarious lmfao

you guys really think this is madden and want us winning 600 every week huh
thats my fucking llama
who wouldve thought wed score more if we played to our strengths crazy
lamar needed that
marlon humphrey is just fucking ridiculous
fruit punch
weird how they mix the fans in with the cutouts right
extremely high effort 3 yard rush by lamar
blitz that many you better get a sack or else something bad is gonna happen
well that was just beautiful mother tucker
best kicker of all time
tucker is a god change my mind
i dont think lamar played great but i think he did enough this offense has been slow today due to the offensive line really disappointing how sloppy theyve been
we have sucked major ass today once again if we played a good team wed be getting blown out fuck people that are saying we shouldnt be concerned
theyre trying so hard to give this game away
do you guys finally get why people were complaining about the offense relying on the defense for an entire game isnt sustainable if the offense kept their end of the bargain this game would have been decided a long time ago
harbaugh please unleash hell on this entire fucking team after the game this is absolutely ridiculous
thats fucking bullshit they waited to see if the ball was caught before they mad ethe call and he was holding peters jersey wow
are we really about to blow this game
the defense has had so very little time to catch their breath the second half the offense is killing them
i dont remember the last time the ravens collapsed like this
can we talk about calais please
we beat the refs
130 penalty yards cmon
i cant believe the 3rd quarter isnt over yet this game feels like its been going on for years
great hustle elliot love your impact since etiii been gone
those stagnant trash drives better not come back to bite us
this is such a classic 20132017 ravens game
im attracted to large women
gro play more duvernay
lamar that was sharp
that was freaking beautiful
that play design looked horrible but great fucking play by lamar
that was insane
still hate the rollout to the right but

td
lamar the magician jackson
really really liked the use of duvernay and lamar using his legs to extend the play to nick boyle on the td great start
yall edp is so mad
oline needs to get their heads out of their asses
nerves back
to be fair batted balls at the line were a concern for murray coming into the league
great coverage by averrett there pinned him to the sideline and eliminated the receivers space textbook
so refreshing seeing our front 7 getting after the qb thats been mostly absent so far this season
i see the offense still really is just shit all together i dont care what categories we lead in it sucks
okay that drive fucking sucked two drops in a row
baltimore did nothing but add talent to this offense i dont understand
without opening a new thread for this

are you satisfied with deshon elliott so far
you love to see it 3 straight runs with gus
god we suck so much we are only up 14 points in the 1st quarter and we only have one takeaway
lmao this cutout bud light commercial is wack
imagine being an eagles fan and paying out the ass to go to a game in the middle of a plague just to watch your team get dog dicked by a squad that isnt even firing on all cylinders yet couldnt be me big truss
what a commercial lol
ingram has looked old as fuck this year man

dude is still tough as nails but hes not evading anyone
dobbins needs work
gotta catch that

aaaand it wouldnt have mattered anyway
dobbins has to catch that
every time they start praising tucker i get hella nervous
baker is 27 for 23 yards 0 tds 1 pick for a td
it is really annoying though because that was an easy mode first down if he had just caught the ball in stride like lamar threw it
i hate to say it i hope i dont sound ridiculous i dont know who this board man is lol
calais a grown ass man
x200b

keep sacking wentz
4 yards of offense now
calais just drove 2 grown ass nfl athletes back 5 yards into their own qb dudes a beast at like 37 years old
a lot of people are complaining but at least we arent the fucking eagles
calais sack was fucking nasty damn
wasted a down on that pass
lamars fundamentals are all sorts of fucked up rn
what is going on man lamar looking like tebow rn
imagine risking getting the rona just to watch your team get blown out
fuck this airhorn
someone please find the jabroni with the horn and shove it up their ass sideways kthx
throw a flag on the horn this is bullshit
i hate this offensive line today i really do their shit discipline ruined this entire drive
theyre batting too many of lamars balls at the los
seriously fuck that fan with the air horn
you know id love if we tried to take some shots to hollywood you know the guy whos been getting open on deep balls all year
dont they actually have a jail cell at the philly stadium or was that the old one anyway if they do thats what they should do with the airhorn guy
hurts is about to be the starter
im scared of hurts more than wentz tbh
mcphee played his part
damn all those next gen stats and watson still 14 lmao
marlon the literal light of my life
hurts probably would have got it
fuck that conservative bullshit
we certainly wouldnt have been this scared last year remember the second browns game g ro is a straight puss
drop td for a drop int fair trade i guess
how tf is that roughing the passer such a bullshit call
incompetent refs
ill forgive you calais that was not rtp
weak penalty
glad they missed that refs blunder was a disaster oh well love to hear the symphony of boos at the linc going into half time
do the refs not want to call anything on the fg try no
chuck clark robbed of an interception for the second straight week due to a penalty
i forget that 52 yards isnt a gimme for most teams
ravens 17 eagles 0 refs 0 at half

has duvernay not had a good play when he touches the ball
the baltimore false starts
just fucking throw it away
this discipline fucking sucks
throw it away
nice play judon
judon whiff
we fell for our own gimmick how the fuck
lmao fucking absurd decision from philly
sanders mustve been mad lol running all those yards and not get the td
gotta respect the effort from elliot
duvernay continues to play great
there you go deep passes
are we saving rpo for pittsburgh
lamar be like ill do it myself
sins forgiven
damn who could have guessed rpos work for our team
lamar to the fucking house
23 straight quarters with a score now
calais is a grown ass man
calius literally looks like a man amongst children
fruit punch
holy fuck how does marlon do it every time
i love marlon so much
as good as our pass rush has been the last 2 weeks matt judon has been invisible in both games how is that even possible this dude wants a big contract
the cardboard cutouts look happier than the live fans
our jv offense is about to be 51 lmao
god damn it boykin
boykins weekly complete fuck up right there
boykin needs to be cut lmao
does boykin know the playbook
we all knew that was coming cant hold em for 8 downs
does holding exist
damn that drive almost ended 2x queen almost int 4th 10 if not for roughing the passer
hope marlons ok that looked like it hurt
i cant recall many times this game where i was pissed at a playcall biggest issue this game has been offensive line more negative plays than the eagle is unexcusable
ahhh nothing better than a tucker pallet cleanser
death taxes justin tucker
how do you not call tucker the
tucker makes a 55yarder look so easy
tucker hit from that spot about 8 years ago as well
thank god we have a bye before the steelers

really need to work in some screenseasy quick passes to take the load off the oline if we try all this dropback passing against their d we will struggle
why would any eagles fan willingly come to this game
need a marcus peters or clark pick here
any super fat dudes on here can yal block
anyone remember the days when tucker was the entire offense
half the eagles line false started there and it wasnt called
i could be 100 wrong but arent the eagles repeatedly committing false starts
okay that left tackle was a yard and an inch off the line and youve been calling that against us all day and also it was a false start
lol they finally called holding on the eagles now that didnt hurt refs did it
this is why we have complained about the offense it isnt a overreaction its a problem that let the eagles come back
stop taking fucking flags
im actually thankful our bye got moved a week earlier lol
were actually being robbed today fucking pathetic
thats a bullshit pi call
good wake up call you dont finish a team theyll come back
if we let them score we better fucking stop the conversion fucking ridiculous
fuck these refs
i hope the refs get poison ivy on their nuts what a bunch of horseshit calls and officiating
refs are a joke but lets be real it is the offense why we are losing running up the gut into coxtheir only strength on defense all game very smart
guys i still belee
matt judon makes one fucking play

wheres my money
we got bailed out by phillys incompetence
a horrific play call might have just saved us
well the refs couldnt solidify the win we were trying to give them
beautiful what an ugly w except for tucker perfect as always
thank you proche
its a win thank god
harbaugh needs to fucking lay into every single player except tucker koch and calais today was a fucking embarrassment on every aspect and this team is in dire need of discipline and playmaking
survive is definitely the right word for it
close game that shouldnt of been close period
we gotta give lamar the ball more and let him do his thing tends to work pretty well
the ravens defeat the eagles by halting a 2point conversion attempt for the second consecutive meeting between the franchises 2016 2726 2020 3028 however both games should have been blowouts instead philly surged back with wild comebacks
lets not discredit the dude thats an outstanding catch correct call
im done with the boykin experiment
fucking eagles getting bailed out by these refs
the ravens will escape perfectly said by the announcer we legit escaped with a w that should have been an l
this sub is so toxic its like you guys have never seen the ravens suck no matter what happens you and try and pick apart the team we are up 140 in the first and you guys cry i dont care about next week just enjoy the fucking game enjoy winning football games cause they come and go
1 lj is awesome on that kind of play his ability read leverage and make off angle throws is top of the league

2 it should not be that hard every time
why did they go for 2 isnt it a 3 score game either way
i havent seen us get this fucked by the refs in a long time
really hoping lamar comes out with a chip on his shoulder this week im tired of the hot takes
game predictions

lamar and o gets back closer to normal
jk dobbins gets 2 tds
duvernay gets his first receiving td
queen gets 2 sacks 1 forces a fumble
defense keeps dominance
tucker only kicks xps
about 3 weeks ago someone swapped bodies with me ive lifted weights and ran or some other form of cardio every day i quit vaping ive ate well i kind of miss being able to eat whatever and drink beer how do i swap back
boykinwith a catch
wtf has gro seen in these rollouts to keep trying them
greg roman seems completely out of his depth this season
duvernay is such a beast
duv getting physical
what a play thats 2019 llama
nice play lj
lamar saving the playcall
boyle is jesus
what awesome playcalling on that drive and what execution by lamar

this is what we were hoping for
it literally cannot be stated enough lamar jackson is younger than joe burrows lamar is the only dude in the league not allowed to have off games bounce back time baby
thats the best drive this team has put together this year
humph
awesome start for the defense
anybody watching this with philly fan friends or family
that was ugly
let lamar cook
sheesh these batted passes are annoying this is how it must feel to play against the monstars
can we take a second to appreciate the all time raven starter sam koch guy has been one of the best most consistent punters in the league and he eclipses suggs for most starts in a ravens uniform today
out come the cretins
punt returns are so dangerous man
nfl really milking these commercials wtf thats like 5 in a row now
this is what bothers me we have 2 receivers iin the same spot just 5 and 10 yards deep all the time why
passing offense is ranked second to last in the last three weeks
4 slants on 3rd down lol
our offense has looked like a disorganized clusterfuck since week 2 shittsburgh is about to pound our ass into dust in 2 weeks
lamar had him open throw was a lil off
lol lamar needs a space of 20 yards to slow down after he runs hes too fast
beep beep motherfucker
lamar definitely looks like hes favoring something on his lower body

edit lovely me lol
gussss feed him i love his no nonsense style straight hammer
see what happens when we keep running the ball
gus should be rb1
gus and dobbins are the future at rb
gus bus drives it into the endzone
meanwhile the bengals woke the hell up 200 on the colts
i fucking love our defense
things we are still missing today carson wentz interception and a marlon humphrey forced fumble
this commercial is super bowl quality
facemask wtf
can this team make a catch when it isnt literally hitting them in the numbers besides andrews
nice miss on that facemask
remember when romo said that butker was the best kicker in the nfl
nice missed face mask
these damn dropped balls man we must have the most drops in the league cuz holy fuck
ian giving too much build up for that kick but of course tuck showed that he deserved it
no facemask there alright
is 40 really the steelers best start since 1979 thats surprising
campbell is a monster
calais shoulders bout to be hurting from all those dingers hes hitting
campbells acquisition changed everything for the ravens defence he has been incredible and is totally dialed in
this defense is playing lights out
jesus our defense is fucking insane it makes me so goddamn happy
lamar needs to chill with the sidearm throws just for the hell of it
something is 110 wrong with lamar this is just bad at this point
fuck off with that horn
whoever in the stands has that loud ass horn needs to be removed
stop with the fucking horn bruh
why does lamar continue to throw with a lower arm slot when it isnt necessary
duvernay is great at getting the ball and getting upfield
look at phillys defense celebrating like they done something
bruh try at least one deep ball on those 3 plays greg is such a pussy
wtf is the annoying ass siren right before each ravens snap
lamar really needs to stop this side arm throw crap
that political commercial was bizarre
browns back to being pretenders
great responsibility by mcphee
eagles gotta let hurts start
that was in triple coverage gotta break that up
steelers beating the browns down right now titans look really tough as well weird games today
hold em to 3 max here
you shall not pass
good stand but we got lucky with that drop td
this will be hard to reverse if youre the refs you cant see the ball in the scrum

i think the play will stand
see i think harbs should be taking time outs and trying to put at least 3 up
we are up by 17 but it kinda feels like our offence is not clicking that well with lamar missing throws and our run game not getting going
lest we go a moment without mentioning the chiefs
homecooking refs wtf he tripped
r u fucking serious
i hate these refs
awful call
ball dont lie
ball dont lie fuck the refs
positives our defense may be the best in football definitely top 5

neutral offense starting the game like they did against the bengals efficient at first but stalling out

overall a very good first half
dear lord stop falling hollywood
brown literally always catches and is immediately on the ground lol
hollywood brown constantly catches and falls down
another false start harbaugh fuming
what kind of routes are those
this game should both be 340 for the ravens and 1717 it feels like
too many offensive penalties today my guess is it has to do with the crowd noise for the first time in a while
screens only work if the deep pass is a threat
man we cant ask for a better bye week than this week they need to seriously address the offense before our huge game against the steelers this matchup might really decide the division i wouldnt be so worried but the browns can never beat the steelers smfh
anyone feel like we simply cannot have lamar drop back for a normal route to develop i believe thats the interior oline issue bleh
judon missed a tackle imagine my shock
i though you couldnt fumble the ball forward doesnt it come back to the spot
why do you go for 2 there
decent field position now go score
well hollywood gets so fucking open
lol announcer called that
lamar jackson woooooooo
lamaaaaar
hot knife through butter
lamar looks slow
dont gotta pass when u run like that lmfao
funny how it works when we do what we did all last season
29 straight games scoring 20 points we have a chance to tie the nfl record against the steelers next game then breaking it against the colts
lamar fucking jackson
that play calling executing looked like 2019 ravens
dont need him to run every play if he pops these out
lamar i do this my fucking self thanos jackson
did it just get dark in philly or is something going on with the feed

just give marlon the dpoy stop wasting everyone elses time
marlon ball punch is a cheatcode
fruit punch my man 44
time for roman to pass every down now
you get a fumble you get a fumble

everyone gets a fumble
falcon puuuuunch
can we throw the ball to proche i just want to see what happens
marlo is one bad motherfucker
wanna see a deep ball to hollywood
marlon humphrey and forcing fumbles name a more inconic duo
damn if oline wasnt in th way lamar wouldve been gone
judon not showing up today shows his real worth
let him go and get overpaid

id prefer to eat my words and he ball out
is boykins head ever in the game
lmao boykin
boykin and lamar not on the same page imagine that
honestly how is boykin even employed
did they just try to touch my mans koch ill fight them
did peters think he was gonna catch that he seemed mad
when you send 6 rushers and get no pressure thats what happens
vintage jimmy smith
complete bonehead penality you get one step after the ball is thrown and ward took three before the hit the ball is out your play is over and you give them three more shots at the end zone smh
fucking boneheaded penalties all day long thanks a lot jihad eagles coming back just like last week
marlon clocked his ass
cincy was up 210 on the colts now theyre down 2827 yikes
this offensive line just cant run block as well as they did last year
automatic
tucker is a beast wish we could have killed more time on that drive though
tuck
what a fucking weapon wow
in tucker we trust
bless you justin tucker

also lamar looked good on that drive its the fucking oline that refuses to block in either the pass or run game
the way justin tucker makes me think about 55 yarders the way other teams think about 35 yarders
have we even taken one deep shot
alert jimmy smith is still a real good cb
stop getting penalties jesus fucking christ
edc gonna have to trade for an entire new oline
i hope harbaugh is pissed at the team this week these penalties are ridiculous
10 for 73 so far is inexcusable
the majority were legit penalties
this team needs to run extra laps or something
wrap up patrick queen
my god this defense has to be exhausted
ughhhhh this should not be close fuck off
these refs have done everything in their power to force this into a one score game
stop

fucking

holding

my god man just one drive without a flag please
please trade for julio jones
this team isnt beating kc or ten
suck my whole cock what a bullshit call
fire these refs
horrible game deciding call you dont call that terrible fucking refs
refs realllly trying to give them the win
132 yards in penalties a joke
that is not dpi that is a terrible call
thats a fucking bullshit call both guys are fighting for the ball
these officials need to read the damn rulebook if the db is playing the ball its not pi
these refs are fucked man
gene steratore says its a bad call
not blaming the defence for this shitshow they did their job all game

our mvpled offence shit the bed again
i think i might vomit watching this drive
at this point just let em score
this team needs a slap in the face
there needs to be an investigation into this crew after the game yes we made so many mistakes but how many game deciding calls have they continually made against us this is ridiculous
how do we defend against referees
refs ride the eagles dick i swear
these refs smh my head
trade judon for jj watt
bs call puts them 49 yards upfield refs are trying hard to make this happen just remember how great our d is lets go
elliott dropped int queen dropped int ward roughing the passer on 4th and long offense constantly moving backwards due to penalties

smfh
too fucking close i dont care if we win we have got to be better than this shit
judon made a play
this game shouldve been way easier
were probably one of the worst 51 teams
fuck the refs fuck the offense fuck the second half


but a w is a w
this game was fucking shameful sure the holds were mostly bullshit in that they called that very onesided and the dpi was complete horseshit but all those illegal formation and false start calls harbs should be furious
the bye week couldnt of come at a better time we need to get our shit together if we have a chance to be a top of the afc north
51 for the first time since 2012 both times we started 51 we won the superbowl both times
honestly that second half too me look like a lot of unlucky bullshit that went the eagles way wentz tossing up prayers and they were being answered i dont think lamar played terrible either i hate that he throws sidearm but the penalties is what killed us
so is jk dobbins starting from now on
penalties 12 3 fuck off nfl
can yall shut tf up now about lamar whenever he has a bad play hes still lamar
imagine waiting almost an entire year struggling through the pandemic paying top dollar for tickets so you can finally watch this shit show with your own eyes thats what fandom is
lamar should just say fuck it and start running we need to fucking win games
everyone who says dont act like the sky isnt falling how can you watch our offense and not be concerned as fuck
3 horrible blown coverages in 1 game we are lucky we are playing the eagles
only have ourselves to blame for that td
terrible officiating
were no where close to contending with seattle kansas or tennessee changes need to happen both coaching and players
was that good enough for you rravens
i fuckin hate watching refs hand teams the game this game genuinely reeks of corruption
eagles dline is legit
57 seconds two timeouts and we arent even going to take a shot lol stupid decision
absolutely unacceptable from lamar
careful now we are going to have people in here say you cant complain because we are winning
i know yall arent calling our defense trash they can only carry for so long
this team shouldve been put away honestly tf were letting them hang around for
do you realize how bad you have to be to give up these types of drives to the eagles a team with their top three receivers on the shelf

fucking revolting
i cant believe we are 51 lmaooo
low key worried about us getting gashed without williams but regardless big truzz lets goooooooooo
inhales

lets fucking goooooooo
had a play or two like that last week against the bengals too and teams like kansas city make those plays
can we make duv wr 1 already ffs
im really liking duvernay looks like a steal so far
these first 2 completions are much improved passing plays
this is the offense ive been looking forward to
holy shit that was some playground shit there
lamar was perfect this drive
great runs ingram
perfect start
neck boyle
neck boyle1
outstanding by boyle
very nice play by the llama
cant wait for wired this week
the juke pass gottem
indefensible
thats my quarterback
lamar improv play only him or mahomes consistently make plays like that
dobbins and duv both with touches on the first drive

greg roman you reading this bruh
so who we going for boys browns or steelers i personally would like the steelers to get smacked
the eagles first positive yardage play
also how weird does it have to feel to sit next to cutouts of other fans wonder if well see a classic eagles fan fight with a cutout today
pittsburgh up 100
we got the wet shits on first down and im sick of it
damn that would have been an excellent screen to dobbins had josh sweat not been right there with the swat jk had plenty of room to work with
so far the playcalling hasnt made me mad looks creative enough the screen wouldve been a big gain the tipped pass on 3rd seemed like it wouldve been a easy 1st down

ol is looking bad though
oline needs to pass block better thats it thats the comment
jeez wentz kinda sucks
defense is doing its job and doing it well gotta get another score here
wtf was that
that was damn near a disaster
the o line is ass tf
can we see a replay of the play instead of a fucking bengals touchdown fuck joe burrow
dude what the fuck type of play call is that on third and long short slants really
not good enough shitty throws shitty o line play what the fuck is going on
offense start doing something challenge
what is with our offense today
snead was slow as hell on that route
takeaway streak continues
you see chuck get up in that linemans face thats like twice his size
this ravens defense wow
boyle is getting his these last few weeks
gus bus
perfect oline performance there
gus bus
lamar looked off handing that ball off s
what the fuck is this commercial
that commercial
that was one of the best commercials ive ever seen

bud light 1010 commercial 210 beer
lamar pulling the flacco staring into the void of his own soul while sitting on the bench
damn that commercial was a movie
were clearly the better team but weve also gotten pretty much every lucky break
oh yeah facemask right there lol
we cant catch a ball anymore huh and when we do we fumble it
i miss yanda
come on man perfect pass
anyone wanna take a guess which hole cox just exploited findabetterguard
missed obvious face mask
i will never get sick of watching jt kicks beauties
if today has showed us anything outside of this game is

1 bengals feasting on colts shows the browns beating them isnt that impressive

2 how did the steelers allow their game against the eagles to become so close

i get there is still plenty of the game left but just some thoughts
when did we get a pass rush
good grief he got bodied xd
well the sacks keep coming and they dont stop coming
weve lacked interior pressure for years now so this is great to see
campbell again
philly has 5 yards of offense in the first half

scratch that they really might have 2
im sorry if theres any eagles fans in here but they just look sorry as hell rn
he carried 2 grown men into that sack like they were children
kaboom it lmao i had no idea that was a real company
lol and cbs was marketing brownssteelers as a matchup of two of the best teams in the afc
okay i love lamar but that was the worst fucking throw of the entire season in the entire league holy sweet fuck
why is lj throwing side arm so much
is lamars arm okay he seems to really favor the sidearm and dipping the elbow hes basically 2018 arm mechanics 2019 vision and feet right now
lamar has gone back on his mechanics his footwork his arm motion
thats the lamar we know
lamar with the first down
nice run by rice i mean dobbins
can they deal with that annoying ass horn please
well this drive is a fucking dud now
refs are being abnormally picky about offensive linemen being too far off the line today
how is that horn allowed in the stadium
just fucking punt it lmao this drive is fucked
1 and 35 no problem jk do your best ray rice impression
philadelphia geese with the fucking horn honking
something is up theres no way he should be sidearming every other fucking throw this is nonsensical
thats 3 balls batted at the line
offensive line is so bad
weve just given up on this drive havent we
are those people with the air horns the same assholes who did that at phillies games this season most annoying shit ive ever heard
i really dont understand the constant sidearm throwing puts everything at a rising angle
why not try some downfield thrown dammit
i predict a calais safety
okay horn man we get it we know that you are there and that you know how to use the damn thing
i am a roman hater and i find it stupid people are blaming roman for those playcalls

no one has a 1st and 35 playcall at that point just try to get field position and regroup for next drive
philly will demand they bench wentz now lol
beautiful move

for three yards
eh lets hold them to 3
can we get an interception here
mayfield is 512 79 yds 2 int
jesus how do they miss that glaringly obvious hold
remember week 1 when we had that 99 yard td drive to end the half and we thought this offense was good can we do that again please
what a performance from our defence today and last week they deserve the half time rest damn really impressive
how do you review a play where you cant see the ball
theres nothing to review here stop wasting time they wont be able to change the call because hes cradling the ball and you cant see where it is this is not rocket science
damn he actually fumbles the ball on the second surge
he never reaches the ball its way behind his head and shoulders
why were we calling timeout to stop the clock if we werent gonna try to score
take some fuckin shots downfield why call the to then
it seems that guy got his horn taken away
at least kind of try goddamn
you see that almost interception thats why you dont try to give them anything were up 170
mcphee trying out for eagles wr
roman said yall niggas wanted me to run the ball right
jesus christ refs fuck off with the homecooking
the eagles fucking suck lmao
longest half ever
that seemed like a long half
the vikings are getting dicked
marshal yanda hurt us alot lets all be honest
yeah imagine this being the joe flacco years wed still be up but itd be like 90
offensive line is going to be running a looooot of sprints in practice this week

every other play man
hollywood stop being a pussy its football
this offense pisses me off with how much better they should be
fucking penalties kill this drive unbelievable dude
i like that we win these games bit its just not sastifying with offense struggling like this
man if judon could tackle anybody and not play flat footed he could he really good
this is why we need more now its a 10 point game
elliotts best game of his career

edit given that that td was not his fault
great play by elliot just an unfortunate bounce we should be more disciplined against the option
the defense has been amazing today except for 3 plays but those 3 plays could all be touchdowns this game could easily be 2117 eagles if they could catch the ball
good run followed by a good strip just didnt have a guy on the spot lucky td
offense you gotta fucking show up for one drive please
great play from elliott unfortunate bounce
nice runback there now the offense has got to put points on the board
cbs called that
where are all the haters at now
mvp
well that looked cathartic for lamar
nice run
x200b

lamar jackson
good shit
yeah lamar this is the man we all know and love
cant even give him a crease such a cold mfer what an explosive run and hole from the oline love that guy lj
let lamar do what he do stop trying to make him be something hes not shit lets go mvp
this is actually a highlight reel for jackson
mvp

mvp

mvp
lamarkable indeed
jackson fuck this wall in particular
lamarvelous
lesssss gooo
yes more of that it literally all we gotta do with this offense
now the d needs a pick 6
calais campbell is going to be defensive player of the week for the afc
they have no chance against calais lol
campbell has been the best offseason addition
wentz may die today fr
calais campbell is a beast
bro calais just clubbed that rg into another dimension
campbell is having a monstrous day what a steal for a 5th rounder
campbell threw that guy like a ragdoll lol
marlon i invented the concept of a fumble humphrey

lmao even a failed fruit punch counts
damn marlon almost got that

calais campbell tackles 5 sacks 3 tfl 4 qb hits 4
crazy game
first ff from marlon that was not returned for a td

is marlon regressing
this game is basically a coin toss heads ravens penalty tails eagles fumble
boykin smh
fuck miles boykin for real
boykin and lamar not on the same page what else is fucking new
bro lamar is never on the same page with boykin
boykin what is you doin
back to the limpdicked playcalling i see

edit also boykin ran the wrong route
overall this has been a fun game to watch for us
offense needs to help the defense out theyre gassed
you dumb fuck
jesus fuck we are playing like a bunch of idiots
not this bs again
dumb penalty but i low key like how nasty this d is
discipline of this team has dropped
is this the ravens game with the most flags thrown on us were usually very disciplined something else to work on this bye week much needed man 3 weeks of straight ass offense
marlon has been out of position a lot today
that would been good from 65
fletcher cox is really good
this tucker guy is pretty good
goatucker
consecutive quarters with points scored streak still alive
the greatest
tucker i fucking love you
tucker is automatic
i want to marry justin tucker
gus has 11 carries for 17 yards lol
by the way thats 24 straight quarters with a score
chuck clark causes no dramaet3 intensifies
jimmy smith has been so lockdown this year you forget hes even playing at times because his guy is never targeted
4 penalties for stanley alone
i rarely see illegal formation and now its every fucking play
i never thought id be frustrated at a ravens team that scored 30 in a game but here we are
i dont know whats more embarrassing losing to the falcons 4015 or blowing a 21 point lead to the colts
i wanted falcons to lose so julio asks for a trade lol
damn imagine being an eagles fan right now though
lol nice tackle queen
bowser is going to get paid somewhere else as is tradition
ed reed would never
thats good old dean pees 4th down defense
how the fuck do you let that happen holy shit
marlon is just mauling whoever has the ball
never should have been in this position if the offense played better
2 all pro corners and they couldnt knock down a floater fucking garbage
holy shit that was lazy
wake the eff up d
this game is way too close for what it shouldve been horrible 2nd half
no guys the offense isnt that bad youre all just whiners s
im gonna fucking throw up
the fuck is our offence doing trying to give the game away
11 fucking penalties today did we sign michael orr last night i must have missed the signing
wtf happened to our team bruh you cant tell me the loss of yanda and hurst caused this much of a decline
fire marty
i thought the fire roman people were overreacting but goddamn our offense is one of the worst in the league
yo these refs have to be questioned this is insane
what the fuck
how tf is that pi
lol dont call the hold but call that awful pi
deadass im going to the fbi website and dropping a tip
132 penalty yards absolutely inexcusble
thats gotta be a fucking joke
are you fucking kidding me oh my god what a bullshit call
that is fucking unreal
this game feels like a carbon copy of the bills game last year
full collapse on both sides of the ball
the refs just dont want me to sleep huh
this is a very long game
terrible offensive line receivers cant separate no edge rush awful play calling

this team is winning a super bowl
i popped in the rnfl game thread quick and regretted it right away
blatant false start no flag i guess the refs cant see green
refs cant execute for them fuck em
any ordinary worker gets fired after a performance this atrocious these refs need to be looked into
that onside kick proche catch could legit be play of the game
team better be running suicides all wrek
procheduvernaycampbell for player of the game
too close for comfort
good felt one of the runs had to be designed lamar run
lamar i know you wanted the score please slide next time tho we win now
harbs just told judon we trading your ass
we need to give up a 5th rounder for a starting guard
i thought lamar was crawling bc he was hurt
last quarter was 226
i honestly dont mind all the flags but when there is zero consistency in the calls ie a hold for us but not a hold for them thats when i lose my shit
we need this bye week because this game was way too sloppy and our offense has not looked good at all this season we scored 30 largely because of the defense getting us great field positioning
theres no reason why this game shouldnt be a blowout
for anyone who wasnt around for the back end of the flacco era welcome
madden curse
the rumours of lamars demise have been greatly exaggerated
lamar dont throw the angry ball at the autism foundation sign bro
shit happens our defense has been on the field so much today offense needs to put the nail in the coffin right here
honestly beyond the offense looking like shit the fucking undisciplined penalties today are unacceptable usually harbaugh doesnt let that shit happen
the offense as a whole especially lamar is playing pretty good its just the fucking o line seriously thats it lamar was sacked three fucking times today too
some fucking scrub mossed our all pro dbs smh
jesus christ everything going for them i still cant get over 3 forced fumbles and they got lucky on all of them
giants fan here please win we want to take the division with 5 wins
do i love this team yesare we as good as we think no
guys baker was pulled because hes hurt and playing bad they didnt just bench him on play alone
for all these new ravens fans to be happy the ravens have to

score every drive
let up 0 tds
lamar needs a perfect passer rating every week
250 yards rushing every week
500 yards passing every week
this o line really sucks
greg roman is actually slow
has anyone else been so disappointed in consecutive weeks with consecutive 170 halftime leads we are beyond spoilt as fans and beyond spoilt by the defense
imagine if we had this defense with our offense that we had last year
boykin has shown me enough
remember owning teams in top i memba
only people playing worse than the team are the refs
were not beating pittsburgh
they blew a lead to the 131 bullshit nfc east eagles

and you all think the offense is fine
god i hope we win this one i fucking hate the eagles this may be sacrilege but i may hate them even more than the steelers
predicting queen gets his first pick this week
run the damn ball
damn bruh why does the steelers and browns game have to go on at the same time the ravens play they should have scheduled that game for an early afternoon game its going to be a good game hopefully they tie
im watching on a stream so im behind so yall are going to see me react to plays late lol
ingram is so much slower than gus or jk
ingram missed a huge hole there
horrible play call by wink why rush secondary when theyre that backed up
get ingram off the field
lamar and boykin fixed we are never losing a game again nice try nfl
plz remove the rollout to the right from the playbook

plz
damn duvernay is fast
run behind stanley
if we can take some of the coverage off of andrews and hollywood dangerous
nice duvernay
seriously why are we rolling out almost every playaction pass
feed duv
this is just the type of drive were used to not big chunk gains every play but one that chips down the field you love to see it
the jukethrow td sweet
what play by lamar
boyle
duv going to end up being our 1
lmao frustrating as hell for 55
im tuning in a tad late but caught that they were showing a replay of duvernay with the ball did he have a good play
fucking lol
ohhh td what a play lamar
fuck that was nifty
touchdown ravens
full boyle
stop these rollouts every fucking pa pass i am screaming at my tv like a lunatic


good shit lamar nice catch and td celebration boyle
lamars looking 100 today
a lil shake n bake baby thats all we need
that gave me an erection

edit autocorrect
literally just some madden 07 mike vick bullshit out here so fun to watch
this is revenge for losing to the steelers
d looking stout first 2 drives
okay thats the 3rd time it hasnt worked roman maybe call a different run play
yanda was so huge for us haha need tyre to figure out pass blocking or give fluke a chance
goddamn i hate this oline
we might need to leave tyre on the bench powers and mekari played well last week
crazy that the last game suggs played for us gave him the franchise record for games played
avertt was in good coverage too
oh fuck that sucks i hope hes good
i can hear humphrey yelling lol
dalton winning the nfc east
i love dogs but that tongue flapping lapping dog commercial is extremely annoying
damn he nicked his head off of proche weird hope hes okay
so the d line seems to be doing good finally
duvernay is lucky he didnt get flagged there
uh oh
ingram limping a little
i love dobbins get touches but where the hell is gus at
im wondering if that ball was intended for mark andrews its weird that they were so close to each other there
sigh im calling buttergate eagles buttered the balls during pregame receivers cant seem to catch although the one to snead was a bit offtarget
lamar not looking hot today
last year in these shitty pass plays lamar would just run for a first when they busted this year he looks determined to be a passer and stick with the plays the problem is that romans plays are so bad that it was genuinely better for lamar to just take off last year
we cant get in 3rd and long all the time with our offense
roman is infuriating
lol our passing game would be statistically dead last if it wasnt for the jets sad
we need to go back to those 2 te sets our play calling has been shit so far
clear fumble lol wtf are these announcers looking at
lets fucking go 19 straight games with a turnover
defense cannot stop forcing fumbles
elliots moving it before the knee goes down
nick boyle the new wr1
you guys think marlo had a ted talk on stripping footballs last week
wow lamar ran
that was a bullet
yeah lamar is definitely not 100 based on what i saw on that scramble
lol the bus got creamed and still moved forward xd
alright fuck it well win the sb with our historic defense
yeahhhhh gus busssss
gus busssss
tha wheels on tha bus go round and round
140 and havent even played that well love this team even in its hiccups
the nfc east tastes delicious
lamar walking weird
lamar running the football really changes the way coverage is played by the defense it makes him special and using it gives him a better chance to be a better passer
lol look how effective the ravens running game is when roman calls simple run plays its astounding
guys bozeman was drafted in 2018 with lamar and the guys we need to extend him now before his 4th year he is sooo fucking solid remember the hurstalex lewis rotation give that man a contract
sometimes i feel were just looking shitty on offense because we are trying new shit out and saving real shit for when we need to actually score
funny how bad teams look like trash against us and rob our wins of any respect look at the bengals crushing the colts the 41 browns they are trash of course though
lmfao browns losing time for them to come back to earth playoffs here we come after beating the cowboys bengals and colts
re bud light commercial

uhhhh
that was strange
that commercial is hilarious
what the actual fuck are the eagles doing
everyone needs to chill tf out

two things can be true at once offense needs some time to work out kinks and were also still dominating and stacking wins i swear some people think if we dont score every possession everything needs to be changed
wentz is so bad lol where tf was he going even
cut to the outside damnit is something i say to a professional athlete while sitting on the couch knowing full well i couldnt outrun a moderately fast college flag football intramural player
cmon guys wr rb te all have issues catching the ball this year
wtf wheres that facemask
two penalties from our star olineman come on now
while it was coming back anyways brutal drop from dobbins but a nice drive for our offence to get us in there
we cant be asking our lg to reach to cox on the opposite side
damn i never realized how big of an impact yanda had
that incompletion for dobbins is the result of the abridged offseasonno preseason if he and lamar are a little more inaync thats a first down

ten weeks from now at the end of the season thats complete 1110 times
wanns now how manny fantasy points baker has right now
058
i just want some 7 foot tall mfer thatll catch everything in a 2 mile radius man
browns down by 17 there goes their super bowl run
fuck the steelers
browns best start since 1994

san diego browns inaugural 2022 season confirmed
nice to see board make a play
defence shut out the bungles who are blowing out the best defence colts
chris board showing up
ok i will say our defense is looking bomb
the monstars
campbell aint playing around with that road to 100 sacks hed get them all today if he had the opportunities
i love seeing great coverage from lbs
bro i love calais
campbell is a fuckin tank
calais campbell for a 5th god who is letting edc do this
board looked nice in coverage hopefully something to build on
lol i gotta ask who made the bungles so angry xd
are the bengals and eagles lines really bad or did our d line suddenly get way better the last two weeks
wentz has negative yards now lmao
waytooearly game ball to calais campbell what a start to the game hes had today
i like proche as a pr hell probably never break a long one but hes got good hands and always goes forward
lamars passing is atrocious
at what point is lamars accuracy a concern this year
i get why folks are frustrated the ravens are not perfect and the offense couldshould play better and yet we are 41 have the second best super bowl odds behind kc and are first in dvoa i get why its frustrating with last years offense and this years defense the ravens would legit be playing like one of the best teams of all time but the fact is the ravens have been playing like a very good team even if it seems like they could be better i think thats reason for optimism tbh if the offense that returned basically everyone from last year gets back to where it was this season is going to be pretty fun
lj needs to hit these full stop
wtf is up with lama
lol lamar jesus
bring back 2019 passing lamar
geez lamar that was ugly
lamar its ok bby
wtf is happening to lamar
that was a 2018 lamar pass
thats my llama making it happen
wtf to the guy with the air horn
i was today years old when i found out i cant handle lamar doing front flips that shit was worse then a joe flacco nail biter check down game
i feel like ive seen more illegal formation penalties in this game than i have in my entire life
thank god for the bye week after this
whats with all these illegal formation penalties
i feel like theres been a ridiculous amount of illegal formation penalties this game on both teams
this offensive line is a fucking joke
now does this mean they will start calling holding on the eagles too because it has been constant just asking
the browns r down 240
you have got to at least attempt to go deep
promising drive killed by penalties
someone needs to eat that horn
lamar chill with all the sidearm bullshit fire that bitch in there cmon
security will eventually find the horn guy they cant let that go on
jalen hurts three yard gain ahhhhh
hurts plays like hes murray
nice read my pernell
lets just run every gimmick
dont worry wentz will fuck this up
not a catch
not a catch
0 chance thats complete
great play but also a whole lot of luck lol
so block in the back only applies to us got it lol
lowkey our secondary has been getting away with receivers getting open bc theyre dropping balls this game they need to play better especially since better teams would not make the mistakes that philly is making
falcons are up 20 you know what that means
just wondering did some of you expect that the defense should hold them to negative yards all game theyre going to play football back
big d
god damn the bengals are eating up the colts d

meanwhile kirk cousins threw 2 ints against the worst defense in the league
the defense on fourth down is chefs kiss
they keep saying the second leap but the football doesnt make it only his head lmao
we all knew the d would be pretty solid this year but its a surprise to me at least theyre overshadowing the o as big as they are
not bad wout bwill
why cant we just go for it we get the ball back
now was the time to pass more and we dont
bs call
weak ass call
for what
did clark scoop that up man thats 2 picks clark has had taken away
horrible rtp call
eagles kicker didnt agree with the call either lol
bhahahahahhahah
what a horrible roughing call thats just football go ahead and just baby quarterbacks
these refs are calling everything on the ravens
thats the weakest shit ive ever seen
jesus so fucking soft
thank god he missed i wouldve been mad lol
ball dont lie
terrible call wtf
bullshit ass call
they miss anyway lol

lot of bad play all over 1pm games today
that steelerstitans game will be huge next weekend
lamar bless
oh yea love me some lamar jackson
oline is getting penalties but no push
these procedural penalties are awful
bradley oher bozeman
good shit happens when duv is in
free duvernay
duvernay should never be on the sideline sign my petition here
stay up marquise and thats a big gain maybe even a touchdown
duv wr1
another procedural penalty these guys need this bye week to focus up
the fuck was that lamar
the entire offensive line needs to be running laps in practice one for every technical penalty yard
make them practice every day during the bye jesus
lamar tf are you doing
out of field goal range excuse me we have a justin kicker
passing offense definitely deserves that second to last spot
we need a star wr that can get open
good looking drive up until the end there
those routes were pretty abysmal
another week vs suspect defense lbssecondary weak and we cant get the offense going going against pit ind ne ten after the bye going to be a very rude awakening for the offense
elliot made a great play just unfortunate luck
alright lets put up 7 of our own then
you can only diarrhea for so long on offense
why go for 2
the offense needs to actually do something now
wow unluckyi saw that fumble coming too
what the fuck was that absolutely bizarre td
this is probably the worst i have seen this team in terms of mental focus in a very very long time its a tough season but man if harbs cant get them on track in that arena im concerned

need this cleaned up by next week or it will be an embarrassment looks like we couldve really used the bye next week
our run defense has been shockingly good considering no b will or wolfe
that was another crap throw by lamar low in a wide open dobbins
too many takes in here that are fuckin embarrassing
why dont we run rpo anymore
marquise needs to learn how to run with the football
finally
gone lol
there we go
put some respect on his name
i love seeing duvernay return hes so explosive he will definitely have multiple return tds this year
llama
mentally strong drive there didnt let philly build any momentum well done
everyone is happy again yay
yes lamar thats what we need
teams have been overplaying lamars outside runs all year

the middle runs and runs opposite lamars momentum are wide open
lamar wheels
well done roman lol
hahaha his last td run almost got ruined by early celebration but he couldnt help himself here

atleast he did a double take to make sure he was in the clear
way to answer back
wellthat was a nice response lol
anyone else catch charles davis pulling a romo
campbell breakout game
campbell with 3 sacks
he just threw a 300 pound grown man
is that 3 for calais
marlon forced another fumble peanut tillman jr
holding against campbell but its aight
some mark andrews garbage time fantasy points and im a happy man
lmao marlon
that technique by marlon is so clean reminds of dbz when they would learn new powers lmaooo
fruit punchhhhhh
drew lock is 920 and the broncos are still beating the pats in new england 183

bb tb may not want to admit but each was a big part of the others success
campbell for player of the game
fruit punch got my dick hard
is it a specific instruction to not throw it away
thats the best loss of 2 ive seen today lol
lol wr not on the same page i didnt even need to see the number to know it was boykin
another miscommunication with boykin
i see why they dont draw plays up for boykin
lamar has got to throw shit away instead of taking a loss when hes scrambling out of pocket
alright its either lamar or boykin not watching film or studying the plays because this is 3 games in a row now that they are in different dimensions
watching marlon punch the ball out makes me think it hurts like hell when he misses and you take a haymaker to the ribs
fuckers tryna hit sam koch we riot
i always thought that was an automatic first down
dude shut the fuck up

how does koch sell it by trying to spin out of the contact stop inventing narratives
mt not even based in baltimore smh
good no call hightower pushes off as well
cant wait for this bye week guys no stress over this team for a week but then we play the steelers
super bowl 47 hero jimmy smith
havent heard queen name much today glad he showing u now
i think judon gets half his stats from hitting the qb a full second after they throw the ball
come on fucking idiot
come the fuck on
sit ward dumb fucker
what the hell completely stupid play
yea you know that was coming its not 2008
penalties killing us man
what a dumb fucking penalty
i hate these flags man
offense can put this away
icymi the bengals and titans just blew big leads against the colts and texans
we need a classic ravens 9 min offense drive
is hump ok
shorten this 4th q up score at least once more and get the fuck out of here
yo nick boyles having a big day
yo refs can we get a late hit i mean itd only make sense
iol getting blown up
gus edwards who always seems to get a couple yards or at least back to the los has been dropped for a loss like 5 times today
based tuck
good from 60
in range as soon as hes in the parking lot
for the love of god just score a td so we can get tf outta here
cmon dawg give the defense a fuckin breather
goat and it aint close
best kicker in the league
goat
yo tuckers so reliable hes more reliable than grass being green
mother tucker
tuck my boy you did it again
jeeezuz what a kick ahhh remember when we were winning games with tuck and our defense good times

let it not be a secret to anyone that i love justin tucker
tucker rn
autuckmatic he was even smiling like yeah i know
this would be the ravens first win at the linc in the harbaugh era if it happens
thanks texans
lets get a golf clap for jimmy smith today hes been amazing
just a quick question did we draft jk to just sit on the sideline
illegal formation
lmao how many times did the chiefs ol do that to us without a penalty
these illegal formation penalties are ridiculous
line is in your name how do you keep getting illegal formations
tucker hits everything
i love our d
judon punching air on the sideline seeing that unblocked sack
fuck tennessee
for what its worth i think romans playcalling has looked better and slightly more creative than last week
man wentz has been hit hard all day and keeps fighting respect
i respect carson wentz dude has balls of steel
the killing joke
our d man its unreal
not an interception still love the jokers hustle though
how much money do these refs have on this game worst refereeing ive seen in my life
how lol
how does that completion happen with marlon and peters there

come on man
both of our all pro corners on him
oh fuck off man lol
were trying to blow this arent we
did we practise at all this week
eagles blatantly holding since the refs wont call holding lol
wow this game should have been over a long time ago embarrassing that we have just let them hang around will be such a failure if we give it away
peters misplayed that he was there but he didnt time the jump
imagine if even one of the 2 tds that eagles receivers dropped was actually caught bad offense by the eagles has helped us a lot today
dude nothing is working for us offensively
im legit annoyed
if we dont eat the clock here so help me god
holding again
and a fucking penalty
seriously need to let the oline walk back home after this game
did the refs bet on how long this game was going to last
refs are a joke 2020 vision on our team but actin like stevie wonder when eagles are holding tackling are rushers to the ground
27 seconds of offense what a joke
greg roman needs to go straight the fuck up
absolutely bs call they were both fighting for it
this is one of the most embarrassing performances youll ever see
weve given them almost as many yards in flags as wentz has throwing

fucking hell man
132 penalty yards in this game
fuck these fucking refs fuck them
132 yards in penalities lol
i am so fucking angry right now
when we had yanda and a mauling offensive line roman was fine but now we dont have that much push and we need to develop our wrs and their routes thru play calling
end this shit
remember when we had that big lead
shiting the bed here best chance is to stop the 2pt conversion if they score
playing against practice squad players all over the board
oline rly screwed the pooch in this game with all those flags
62 with the hold
wr will be wide open for the 2pt conversion
still a chance for skura to get a offensive holding penalty
i dont even understand how we got into this situation this shouldve been an easy w
3014 is the new 283
ah classic ravens football
this should open the eyes of all the morons saying relax ravens are blowing teams out
we stopped them wheres the flag
taco bell
an obvious uncalled false start too worked out but terrible
incredible no call on that false start lmao
even if we win this feels like a loss i hope the team views it the same way
wow we do not deserve this win i really hope the offensive line is chewed out in practice cant fault the defense too much i feel they were given no rest in the fourth quarter

edit spelling
despite our issues today our special teams continues to excel
talk about an escape
i am dead
jackson scared me like fuck there when he got up he kept his arm right on his body like he hurt it and i got spooked
we escape with the win lots to work on over the bye
kick a fg to rub it in the refs faces
we need these types of games a lot to learn from and motivation to get better cant blow people out every game in the nfl gg
pure fucking luck i just hope they were using these last 3 games to develop lamar cause if this is us against the steelers were getting fucked
steelers game going to be a slug fest and hopefully a chance to prove we can be better than good teams
u g l y
obviously not a great game and a lot to be addressed but if we can still win while the other team gets a ludicrous amount of lucky bounces and officiating help ill take it
this sub is starting to make sense to me as if the very same sub that wants greg a roman fired wants jalen hurts to start after one play lol
every route was in front of the sticks wtf
lamars sidearm passes are very hit miss just use regular motion give the receivers a chance
ngl joe bidens ads go kinda hard
no confidence is the offense

2 minute drill with two timeouts and you call 3 runs back to back sad
the fact that were that upset about being up 170 instead of 24200 shows how far weve came since the flacco days
that drive minus that tarded swing pass to rb to start was why we were so good last year run run and run
you would think this is pittsburgh sub as much as everyone talks em up fuck the steelers i dont care if we are 015 i refuse to talk them up
i think a lot of people are ascribing problems to the offense as a whole that can actually be explained by simply poor line play the o has actually been quite good today imo without the penalties yes i understand that penalties are still part of the offense but the point is that in theory a good team will clean that up in the time between week 6 and the playoffs im feeling pretty good today
i only hope we lose to force the fo to make a move
getting a bad loss to the eagles here might actually shake things up

this team barring a tremendous meltdown will make the playoffs but i have zero faith theyll be able to do anything except get bounced early again
man i liked this sub a lot more before we signed lamar i swear 90 of you are just reactionary babies it legit feels like most of you arent even watching the game just complaining
this offense is just not good enough right now period

you are 100 kidding yourself if you think this offense is enough to win against a slew of good teams en route to winning a lombardi the defense and special teams are great those units are good enough the offense is not

in rnfl today all i heard was how andrews was gonna feast because gerry is shit where is andrews meanwhile lamar is sidearming everything the line is brainfarting on simple fucking procedure every other play there is no run game receivers cant get separation and lamar just gave up an unnecessary sack to lose us points this is not good enough period
a lot of yall are super fair weather everybody saying lamar needs to be benched or madden curse needs to take a good step back and stop watching this game
this side arm nonsense needs to stop his decision making is back on point tho this week off is important if lamar gets back to week 1 form we best team in the league no cap
i feel like watching a game from late flacco era again
i hate to say it but no way we beat pittsburgh only scoring 24 really hope we clean up the offense on the practice field this week
i really really want to believe in this team but we look like paper tigers at the moment
bruh that looked like a pass from jacksons rookie season
one thing lamar can definitely improve is his body language when things arent going well
these last few games make me nervous for pittsburgh
if we lose to hurts i swear to god
lol when we want them to throw greg roman chooses to run is he toying with us
man last year we would have tried to get a td with less than a minute left lol
everyone is so mad we didnt try to score were learning from last year and not blowing our load in the regular season jesus christ sorry were only up 17 points on the road with a team that actually is allowed fucking fans
feel like lamar got lazy on his technique that made him so efficient last year keeps throwing sidearm and not stepping into his throws hes right on the money when he does could also be the oline regression
i get that i am a part of the problem but i turned that am to a was not every game is going to be 5010 we are lucky to have a great team but cmon yall were are pitching a shutout right now and we pitched a sort of shutout last week
but are we ever outta fg range
i hate our inability to get separation so fucking much jesus christ
this teams going to look like shit against good teams our schedule coming up is going to be brutal for us
wasnt there a rule that you cant fumble forward into the endzone
some of you guys have never experienced the heart attack flacco era of winninglosing games in the last minute we arent going to put up 40 each game lamar is human
some of yall need to understand the offense has looked like trash the past couple weeks and saying it looks bad isnt being toxic
game should be a lot more one sided than this offense has a lot of work to do during the bye week
lots of missed offensive opportunities feel like we should have 50 on the scoreboard right now

thank god were headed into a bye week pop the offense up on those jacks and change the oil

offense killed 19 seconds of clock and yall blaming the defense

these motherfuckers are tired lamar cant pass and we cant run on em
this could easily be the biggest choke of the last several years
we have given up a more than the field in penalities its hard to close the game when you are so undisciplined
i had this dream that tucker was about to kick the game winning field goal and then harbaugh blocked it with an ipad
why do the announcers fixate on the nfc east they all suck
prediction boykin or duvernay has a big game coaches are looking for one of them to step up and be a difference maker todays the day that one does
im gonna need at least 1 receiver to get 100 yards today and duvernay needs to be incorporated more
prediction our announcer today will know who our qb is
biggest concern i have today is the run d without brandon williams ravens give up 160 yards on the ground a game without him on the field
this is lamars rebound week i belee
who do we want to win brownssteelers
fly ravens fly on the road to victory on the road to victory fly ravens fly score a touchdown 1 2 3 123

hit em low

hit em high

and watch our ravens fly

fly ravens fly on the road to victory

r a v e n s ravens
calais is a beast
marcus peters wtf was that
that was a td
yes wink bringing 6 on 3rd 22 makes a ton of sense
peters blew that one but holy shit how fast is jimmy smith still
greg wtf was that
that was tentative as fuck ingram
does jackson seem slower or am i crazy
those naked bootlegs arent fooling anyone this year
3rd 10 is my best friend now
duv needs to be moved to at least wr 2
duvernay is not afraid of contact
boyle is roilin
boyle me timbers
that was sneaky
also great play for the td
what a play improvising our way to 6 ill take it
god i fucking love lamar

anyone know what rap song that was when cbs was going into break
tucker with that big kick energy
i hate it when greg takes away half the field with his playcalling we got lucky bcos of lamars talent there
im a couple of plays late but devin duvernay is going to be a yac machine for years to come in due time
whoa that half record
you can still be a sloppy scorer while our offense is scoring something does seem different
if we could stop those lamar rollouts thatd be great those have been going for 1 or 2 yards each time
this pass rush though
damn 57 yards for koch on his longest game as a raven
let lamar run it bring back 2019
cox and graham are still pretty good man everyone hates on the eagles but those guys have been good for a while they need more playmakers tho
i say it every week and will keep doing so we need to find a better replacement for yanda our oline is clearly hurting and its constantly being proven fuck another receiver fuck another pass rusher if we trade for anyone it needs to be a solid guard
random thought its a good thing zach ertzs parents never named him richard
damn hope that dude is ok
averret has looked good so far
and here come the boos
he did that to his self
that doesnt look good you hate to see that happen to anyone
that was brutal
its hard to see how he got hurt from that hope hes ok
high speed collision head on dangerous stuff i hope that guy is ok but it seems to be that as bad as it looks the guy who gets flipped endforend is usually not the guy who gets hurt in that situation
idk how people constantly talk about how lamar is gonna get injured for his style of play when they never talk about wentz he runs quite a bit too is made of glass and gets hit on every play
ugh
everythings getting deflected
why is lamar so hesitant to take off he could have run for the first down already a couple times this game
just because were playing the eagles doesnt mean our receivers can play like eagles receivers
what is the play calling thats 2 straight plays with guys running routes into each other
i get last week was frustrating due to never running the ball but thats not the case this week the oline is sucking passes keep getting tipped and lamar is missing throws yet again
that was bonkers
his knee was never down imo it was on his foot commentator is ass
bruh nobody in the league is better at forcing fumbles than us
boonk gang
ferguson has been having a solid sophomore year not as much of an instant hit as you want from the ncaa all time sacks leader but hes improved clearly from year one and im excited to see how he grows throughout the year
the ball is starting to move before hes down its a fumble offense needs to capitalize here
dude longhorns balling out today good play elliott
that play is going to stand
defence offence
defense is absolutely ruthless though guys
lamar looked kinda slower there hope hes feeling alright
i hope mark is ok
free gus
the gus bus only stops for the endzone
gusbus
hop on the gus bus next stop the end zone
apex ball hawks

i love it
all aboard
gus deserves these goal line touches way to go bus
da wheeelllss on da bussss
cant stop the gus bus
feed gus
the wheels on the bus right to the end zone lets goo
points off of the turnover solid football two touchdown lead

what we like
the o line did something
really nice 1st quarter in this game
all aboarddddddd
its gonna be another blow out that we all know could have been even bigger isnt it
give it to gus
this is a complete team we may not be playing to potential but they are cohesive i like it
i love mark but its obvious that hes not primary back material he needs to be a compliment not the main course
no panik to panik to no panik all in 15 minutes lol
the eagles look garbage on offense so far so were up 140 have they even had a first down yet lololol
the fact that the bengals are up 200 on the colts rn makes me feel like our win last week was more impressive than i thought it was at the time
pass yards 4

lol
who thinks we should take a guard in the 1st this year bozeman played c for bama so we could slide him back and get someone like leatherwood in the draft feel like we need to get stronger in the interior
ian eagle calling philly the city of brotherly love reminded me of this hilarious tweet
dae actually like that commercial
protect the ball
bro i could see that fumble coming a mile away jesus christ my heart skipped a beat
just imagine the boos in that stadium right now if we werent living through a pandemic even with what 7500 fans they still could heard pretty easily
i guess ingram is fine lol
ingram doesnt have the burst right now sit him
the ravens havent given up points in the 1st quarter on the road since october of last year
they tried to trap cox nah hes too quick for that
where was our facemask ref wtf
another week where we should be winning by a lot more but hey i shouldnt complain
cmon dobbins
dobbins has to catch that
automatuck
this defense with last years offense and wed never lose a game
we really could win this game 303 and people will still
be bitching about all these changes we need to make and how we arent good anymore smh
justin kicker should be his real name
i am not claiming to be an expert but doesnt lamars delivery look different this year i get that theyve had time to practice together and get used to it but could that be where the problems catching the ball are coming from
lol i swear the refs dont like the ravens every week is always some bs or missed calls
hey were second place not third
yall acting like were loosing theres definitely stuff to work on but yall need to find your chill its 170
this game is over i dont think philadelphia could score 17 points on us if we gave them 8 quarters
ok cj board we see you
not bad for a 5th rounder
carsons not gonna survive today is he
campbell fired up
we scored 38 on the browns and our offense is non existent
got damn calais
bro our d is really coming along we can win a superbowl with dilfer of the d plays this well they have like 1 yard
carson wentz is 27 for 3 yards lolol
that might be the most impressive sack of the team all season
campbells chunky noodle soup boy
i went to check my fantasy team the ravens defense is producing the most points for mewhich is nice because im a ravens fan so this is good but sad for my fantasy team
either pat queen is hurt or the ravens used board intentionally on passing downs that drive

board did a great job btw
remember this eagles team put up almost 30 on the steelers and we are without our 2 best dlineman this defense something else holy shit
lamar is so inaccurate right now
jackson what is you doing baby
the punter has come to play

literally his first good punt
i want to get hyped with the d but im still scarred from kc
what the fuck lamar in no way did you need to side arm that ball imo
course the air force is sponsoring us we are shooting down everything out here our defense is a no fly zone
this side arm business is fucking garbage
carson wentz drops back

ravens defense is it for me
horrible pass on 1st down 0 yard run on 2nd and 10 great start
nice play lamar
jk all day
nice run by dobbins
bro lamar extended while flipping in the correct direction wtf
feed dobbins and gus and watch the points roll in
finally dobbins did something
everything about dobbins reminds me of ray rice same number similar physical stature and they even kind of run the same
these offensive line penalties are going to kill us
lamar gotta stop sidearming shit he doesnt have consistent mechanics please clear your head during the week off
ravens do a not touchdown

rravens what the fuck
stop

with

the

flags
so are the refs just getting bored with the game and trying to get the eagles back in it
oline owes me 500 pushups each
you cant beat good teams making these mistakes
the good news is at some point these will be half the distance instead of 10 yards
what the hell is that horn
bruh the ol has essentially ruined this drive
uh alright fuck it 2 deep shots
oline combined iq 3
this is an interesting strategy to keep the ball away from the eagles just keep committing penalties that replay the down
just kept the clock running that whole time big brain stuff lol
beautiful punt boy is a weapon
lamar needs to pump fake or fix that sidearm shit cabt do that all the time
dude what the fuck are they doing is this a joke or something why is lamar only throwing sidearms wtf is the oline doing why are we passing screens over and over on a 3rd and 30
hurts is gonna stay in
didnt realise they were allowed to get 1st downs
lol we let hurts scramble
how are you gonna let hurts do that you
eagles just running 2 qbs for the rest of the game might be their only hope
what was with the fucking annoying ass air horn
all that for 3 yards
hold them to 0
that was obviously not a catch in bounds
think its a catch just a good play
not gonna call that block in the back
defense got lucky on that one
good thing eagles only active play makers are ass
lucky the eagles dropped another pass
defense bailed out a couple times but horrible catch attempts by philly
wow bailed out by that drop
game of drops
short
he short
looked short
denied hell yeah lets go trenches
thats a stop
that was short
short now fuck off the field
refs will probably give it to him lol
campbell is a monster
big stand
fuck yes
held to zero
juiceman about to play his own pickup game in the backfield
defense is fine even if they give up a td here thats still only 7 points allowed in a half

the offense is more concerning lamar and the offense has looked extremely mediocre the eagles are not a good defense
that was the play to have hurts in right there
wow what a combo of luck and good ol ravens d
lol his body didnt even cross the line if they get this then the refs are payed off
defense balling out without brandon williams and derek wolf
take a deep shot to hollywood please
wow content to take it to the half
wtf was that not even trying to score and now we have to give them the ball again
i hate not pushing it at the end of the half you have the literal best kicker in the history of the nfl with 2 timeouts and 50 seconds just freaking push the ball now you give them the ball back because you wanted to play it safe
could have at least tried to make it 200
we have 80 yards to go and risk going 3 and out passing and giving philly the ball with tos and over 30 seconds with field position near their 30

not worth trying to get a fucking field goal when were getting the ball back anyone who disagrees needs to play something other than madden
good try mcphee
that was 3 free points bro
what the fuck
refs giving them all the chances
theres ur pick lol
oh duck off thats not roughing
the fuck was that rtp call
i cant stand roughing the passer calls that arent flagrant even slightly
such a weak rtp
boi you aint no justin tucker
chuck chuck
ball dont lie
you know harbs is cussing the refs out behind that mask lol
hahahahahaha theyre killing themselves today
man the eagles suck
ball dont fucking lie
ball dont lie bitch
ball dont lie
lmao the bengals are blowing the lead
tucker is my dad
dude the defense is looking lovely this fucking offense lost weak milktoast i get lamar trying to develop as a passer but what the fuck man why isnt he actually throwing more than a 2 yard screen and when he does throw further he sidearms it he seems like hes hurt or something hes not running at all and he looks so out of rhythm he passed better last year he doesnt look like hes developing well if last years throws looked better than now idk whose fault this is necessarily but its gotta change
im all about this tucker royal farms commercial
wtf are the patriots doing
atleast were winning but this has really been a shit game to watch
the defense has been really improving this year week by week its great to see
jesus christ more penalties
please stop with these penalties
perfect glances off a wrs hand and a flag on the same play lol
what the fuck is going on at the line of scrimmage holy cow
i predict we see a lot more hurts this half
oh man that was some 2019 lamar there
theres our lamar
see when greg romans passing plays inevitably fail lamar needs to get over being seen as a running qb because romans doing you no favors
stunt on them
you guys still think hes not that fast anymore lol
the fucking llama has been spotted
yes lamar thats what i like to see
finally jackson runs
jesus fucking christ this o line is pissing me off
welcome back lamar 3
i think the coaches said the offensive player that gets the most penalties today gets a bonus thats the only explanation
man our runners got hit almost before getting the ball
i think winning has made the coaches too relaxed explains why every aspect of the offense isnt clicking dont hammer the fundamentals into them enough
really liking what duvernay is doing in this game heres hoping we put him to use more
yes offense yes
someone bring out the belt and whip the o line in a row
jesus fucking christ how atrocious has this line play been
what is lamar doing here
wtf 1 step forward 2 steps back
jesus christ lamar throw it away
jesus christ lamar now out of fg range wtf
cmon andrews
these penalties are killing us
god our pass game is so shit doesnt help that the oline is ass as well
omfg
jesus fucking christ
taking a sack there wtf
great job lamar get sacked out of fg range throw it the fuck away
im glad he didnt turn it over but that could have been a fg for us our offence is dying for the bye next week looking way out of sorts
this offense looks like actual hot ass
offense has been in a daze for weeks now theyre about as stable as crypto
wrs cant get any separation against average dbs smh
oline get your shit together
what the fuck happened to our offense in one year oline has no clue what theyre doing lamar has regressed exponentially and mark ingram has fallen off the face of the earth our incredible defense is the only reason were up
offense get your heads out of your collective asses and go score fuck
how fucking stupid is that
well thats on peters a bit
bad luck
bruh thats actually so lucky
what a weird 2 pt conv play
that was dumb

i am fine with that but it was dumb
can someone please explain why tf they went for two
damn we sent the house and overran that play bigtime chuck shouldnt have to take on the lead blocker
duvernay is awesome
offensively we have no identity we used to be a run first team even on fourth and 3 now i see us having lamar throw sidearm incompletions left and right and running maybe one third of the time

run the fucking ball from the get go and set up one on ones jesus christ
how do even these passes look bad
eagles o lineman hugging a ravens defender on the ground after weve been called for penalties on every other play lol
its so nice not to worry about our returners fumbling lol
has lamar taken shots downfield yet today
does greg roman just suck at designing screen plays
even if he hadnt been touched brown was going to slip anyways lol
i just want to see one deep shot to hollywood a game atleast

that was maybe the best pocket weve made all year
lets gooooooo
theres the rpo
llama
has there ever been a receiver that goes down right away like hollywood
z o o m
need to have at least a few run option to keep the defense guessing

edit haha im a little behind
fuck yes need more of that
vikings suck
need that
letttsss goooooo
there he is
its almost as if that play works and we should use it more often
this is still our motherfucking guy have some faith yall
big truss
whats up with us coming out late of the huddle almost every play i get eating the clock but even when were not up its always like with 52 seconds left
keep dat llama
big truss
i need several happy paragraphs from those aggrieved commenters from before lol
the ravens may have dialed back on the designed runs for lamar this season but when they do call it jackson just gets it done
lmao so what ive noticed is teams arent letting lamar get to the perimeter but he can kill them between the tackles look at his td runs this year between the tackles obviously its dangerous to do that too much but its there
campbell going to make soup out of wentz at this rate
holy shit hahah campbell just swatted 66 out of the way
first burrow now wentz we bullied the nice guy quarterbacks we better bully the bad guy quarterback coming up lol
monstars baby
calais just tossed 66 aside like a fly on that sackwow
marlon humphrey is one punch man
does that count as a ff you dont gotta recover it right
3rd straight week for a ff from marlon
fruit punch gettin game coverage
fruuuuiiiiit puuuunch
marlon mike tyson punch out
damn our defense are some ballhawks
its crazy how people will take jalen over humphrey i dont think marlon has let a single td this season when the ball gets thrown his way
next payday im getting me a humphrey jersey fuckin love his game
lol fun fact amazon doesnt own their fleet
cj board update he does have a neck injury unspecified what
i know weve been keeping track of number of consecutive games with a ravens defensive turnover but were gonna have to track the number of consecutive marlon punch outs soon too
mayfield is out of the game rn fyi
why do we run on 2 and long
peanut punchhhhh
offense keeps doing jackshit on 1st and 2nd and then its 3rd and long every time
another wasted down
boykin and lamar just cant get that sideline throw down
uhhh boykin literally took off on a dead sprint and looked over his shoulder after the pass from lamar was already on the ground wow they were so off there what the hell happened
boykin is so bad every game hes running with his head down
marlon looks like a boxer out there
boykin forgot his route on that one clear supposed to be comeback route
john harbaugh said boykin is in all the right spots
its always boykin they gotta get on the same page
boykin has gotta be put on the hot seat he has no clue what hes doing
again with boykin
is it really boykin running the wrong routes coaches seem to say hes playing fine and not in the wrong
ertz is having a bad game
welp bound to happen
wonder how the coverage was supposed to go
this game is nowhere near over 2 score game if they get points here d needs a stop
ward definitely hit him late
damnit ward
good call there
cmonnnnnn we dont need to blast him after throwing it
what a stupid penalty
wow it wasnt judon
we are just going to ignore the blatant hold there refs
that dude could have took a nap and then got back up and caught that ball wide open
i feel like professional football players should be able to tackle thats just me
that was a pick
harrison fucked up big time there

lets go offense
ok now go score
hump took a big impact trying to stop the 2 point conversion hope hes ok
i just want the fucking steelers to start losing man i want first place back
nick mark andrews boyle
bungles boutta choke on their 210 lead lol
imagine having 13 open on 3rd a 4 and just throwing it away ffs
the goat
automatuck
tucker is good beyond words
get your flags ready refs
making 55 yarders look like xps
if we come out playing soft coverage i will be very annoyed
bengals went for a field goal to take the lead and doinked it
four and out yessir
jimmy still a g
i wanna give the eagles some respect they may not be the best team but they got heart i can tell from the way they are playing
we have to have the best db corps in the league no
this is beyond fucked up
lol of course a fucking penalty
another penalty holy fuck
10 penalties now
i swear to christ this offensive line needs to have their bye week revoked or something fucking a
these fucking penalties
holy fuck these penalties are killing us
the more i see this oline the higher stanleys price becomes
5 of 6 ol have been penalized just fucking awful
refs have let teams hold us all year what a load of shit
how many flags seriously i think everyone on offense has gotten one by now wtf guys
ive seen that same holding call on mekari get ignored when were on defense all year i feel like
the entire oline needs to walk home tonight
score would be insane if our oline wasnt flagged every play
its tucker time heck yah
i really wish we had a receiver who was capable of getting open quickly obviously one of them is out on the market rn but
lamar high key been frying today in the passing game
gotta clean up these penalties

i hope that guys ok hate to see that
browns are frauds
humphrey just shoves him down for a sack lol
holy shit you can get called for holding against the ravens
carson jackson
bad tackle by queen
queen soft as hell for that
an offensive holding on the eagles do my eyes deceive me
wow they held us wow
texans no
how do you guys like dev duv so far
if anyone cares thats the second offensive holding call weve gotten called for us this year
picked elliot
elliott didnt catch that
two missed picks this game damn wentz will be really fortunate if the game ends with 0 ints for him
lmao jalen hurts is funny af yall see the face he made at the camera
jalen hurts sighting
are you fucking joking
wtf
oh come on

that was double coverage
in triple coverage on fourth down are you joking
how did they miss that
i swear to fucking christ if we lose this game
and just like that its a game
maybe if the offense could keep the ball longer then a minute the defense wouldnt be tired af
why does it seem like they stop caring like half way through every game
defense is so gassed right now
wtf is going on
can the overly optimistic fans fuck off now
this is actually really embarrassing
peters hurt or just giving up
no idea how this defense gives up this many yards in a half to a team devoid of offensive talent
goddamn these penalties
jesus christ this is pathetic
so many bad penalties disappointing performance
penalties will be the death of us
eagles would be up if the receivers caught the balls they dropped not a good look d has had its moments but they were exposed this second half
we are literally trying to blow this game
nfl refs go brrrr
unfuckingbelievable
lamar is not getting any help at all out there man
we really gonna let them tie this game huh
were not even at the 2 minute warning yet and we let them have the ball back with the clock stopped fans back in it too

wtf are yall doing
27 seconds on offense tell me again how everything is fine
offense is not consistent playcalling is god awful offensive line sucks that is all
lol how much time did we just take off the clock like 10 seconds complete disaster when we could have sealed the win
and now its all on the d should never have got to this
og ravens football is back
whered all them fucking relax fans go only up one td now 27 seconds of offense with 3 mins left embarrassing
fucking bullllsshhiiiit
that is such a terrible call my god
feels like im watching a classic flaccocam cameron game
refs i stg
this is bullshit
12 penalties
eagles dude pushed marcus out of the way
well this is embarrassing
hows that pi
what the fuck is that call
what the actual fuck was that call
that was a bull shit pi
now yall see why offense fucking matters goddamn
someone has a stake in this game
the refs exposing us right now s
who is gilchrist some ps guy
we gonna blow this game
omg these lucky ass plays
haha this game sucks
were is body built by taco bell
gerry sandusky literally said the hay was in the barn on the radio when tucker nailed that last field goal
fourth quarter 3028 blood pressure 35097
greg roman
watch there will be a wide open receiver on the 2 point conversion
fuck the refs
fuck our offense
fuck everything
shoot roman into the god damn sun
the offense couldnt stay on the field and sustain a drive at the end to put this away the defense has made some costly mistakes today but this is mostly on the offense tons of terrible penalties that killed our drives too
ugly ugly game win or lose this game blows
false start on the 2 point by a mile not called
the eagles oline left side moved early on that 2 pt try with no flag but screw em
and a false start there too
they missed a blatant false start on that too 68 went way early
thank god
mother of god what a terrible game and it never ends
games still not over yet
can judon get back on the bus ride home
eagles have more false starts than the ravens have penalties
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
holy fucking shit it literally is just a fucking rerun of our 2016 game
it took judon 5 fucking weeks to do something
fuck you bitch
there you go judon
on the peters bs pi there was a big time missed hold on bowser of course not called
even though we won can we get a blame of the game thread
once again our defense won the game
proche mvp
proche has the best hands on the team
well its reassuring to know we not the falcons
where was the dumbass earlier saying this game wasnt ugly and we should stop complaining
thank you proche
bless our special teams they can get the game ball offense and defense dont deserve shit today
llama with game ball
there we go that bootleg to seal is like that houston mnf 2017 game
we held on boys holy shit
now the hay really is in the barn

thank you faster chief
lol the army crawl back inbounds
fucking heart attack
kind of nice to win a game with my heart going 90 by the end forgot what that felt like lol
both 5 and 1 starts ended in super bowls
good to win but man that felt like a loss
the ravens offense is a mess but the refs where horrendous is there anything that provides quality assurance for them after performances like this
crawled to the win
marcus peters got picked on this game
god our fanbase is so annoying the offense is absolutely struggling nobody is saying otherwise but you get looked at like a leper if you point out that were also 41 and currently up 17 in the first half i watch football for fun not to constantly moan and groan about everything that goes wrong
im seeing some serious losers in this thread
get rid of the horn fucking retarded eagles fans
look at everyone complaining that were only up 170
lamar has been figured out hes not scoring on every possession ravens blow
another week with a lot of people saying complaints arent allowed well lamar has completed 462 of his passes the oline has been bad and the run game is averaging 37 ypc thankfully the defense has made these multiple weeks of bad offense irrelevant but pretty soon the ravens start to play some decent teams and this offense wont cut it
guys chill out we are winning by 10 against a horrible team and our offense looks like shit for the 4th week in a row but we shouldnt be concerned right
jalen hurts is gonna be in this game i can feel it
the dude hasnt moved since the hit and his teammate comes up to him flexin bruh
i really wanna watch the game with yall because covid but some of yall are toxic af just enjoy the season jfc
yikes another bad sidearm pass step into your throws lamar is his shoulder hurt
i dont think that was a catch
nfc east really is a cripple fight isnt it
we really shouldnt sleep on the browns baker is hurt and chubb is out theyve played just as shitty of teams as we have this year except for the chiefs
out of curiosity

through 5 games

2020 lamar 949passing yrds 9tds 2ints 637 238 rush yards 1td 58avg

2019 lamar 1271passig yrds 11tds 5ints 654 308 rush yards 1td 62avg
lmao why does hollywood just fall down on every catch he is not a 1
the offense is fine

8 penalties
about 35 times per game this season i go wtf lamar that rarely ever happened last year
i thought you cant fumble forward
can we give lamar the option to call his own plays hes a smart kid he understands schemes rodgers does it in occasion russell wilson does it in occasion so why cant lamar
we need to hire a passing game coordinator this is insane
keenum is in for the browns

lol
people need to remember that eagles have a top 5 if not top 3 defensive line
we were winning3014 stop blowing ass
this is 100 on the offense if they actually knew how to score without the defense giving them turnovers or great field position this wouldnt even be a game
ravens got this lamar murray is the next mahomes yeeehaw
lamar is so out of it man fuck everyone who says were toxic and fake fans for having valid criticisms man looks like he isnt even trying on some of those
baker benched lol
lamar looks like a rookie qb out there not the mvp of last year
another mental breakdown this would be a bloodbath against pitt
unpopular opinion i think the offense looked good today but penalties are killing our momentum
offense fucked us over they suck
not a single mask in that crowd wtf
our rush game is weak today
mark is hurt i repeat mark is hurt
even if he catches that its not a first down does roman know this
this offense is leaving a lot to be desired this year bad play calling poor touch and accuracy on passes no hands by the wide receivers and the ol isnt providing any time to step into throws rough showing that i assume wont be addressed until the bye week
sidearm pass fail

that was really bad
man lamar really needs to quit side arming it when theres no pressure on him no reason to do that
that was easily the worst coaching decision ive seen from harbaugh in a long time why the fuck do you try to run out the clock when 30 yards gets you into tucker range with 2 timeouts thankfully they dont have tucker so it didnt hurt us but still
the browns are imposters
much more positives than negatives in the first half i wish we could focus on those more
elliott is not to blame for this he did all he could
a million penalties pre snap

completely covered receivers

no downfield calls

raven fans lamars to blame for our shite offense

of course this is now a close game roman is a real liability if our offense cant fucking do anything
i know im not supposed to say positive things about the ravens in rravens but it is nice to see lamar looking around for additional targets
lets see what dumb penalties get called on us this series
thats opi clearly pushed off but thats alright
you guys remember when we couldnt criticize the offense because it was 170 pepperidge farm remembers
if we continue playing like this we arent winning the division
im gonna be fucking sick to my stomach
132 penalty yards isnt the refs fault man one or two calls is the refs fault this is embarrassing
blame the refs all you guys want if the offense had done shit for the past 3 quarters we wouldnt be in this situation
penalties are killing us tbh everything has looked fine except that if we limit the penalties we could legitimately have like 40 points rn
we should be 61 after today we bet the eagles and the refs
1 rush results in negative yardage

greg roman alert alert abandon the run
i dont care what anyone says our offense looks like hot garbage
as much as we had the ball lamar having 85 yards is pathetic lamar is struggling he is a huge part of the offense problems idk why we cant admit it here sidearming for no reason throwing short throwing late
steelers are spanking the browns but struggled with the eagles its a week to week league lamar will clean his shit up literally no reason to think otherwise when has he not improved going back to his true freshman year at louisville
offense is aids stop trying to be different go pack the rpo and win ffs
and i thought this team was going to beat the chiefs lol
lets abandon the run
if gr is reading this dont abandon the run
i hope none of our linemen gets tossed around by fletcher cox tyre will start again at rg i guess
ellis and madubuike in for wolfewilliams
man i really wanna see our o clicking this game
lfg
51 before the bye would be huge lfg
i should have gone to the game a friend said i could have gotten tickets bus ride and tailgate for 500 would have been worth it since it doesnt look like we are going to be allowed at any home games this year
looks like we won the toss and are deferring
first play
we might murder wentz this game
can we get an official sack counter


i
exactly how we drew it up
that couldve been bad
lol the peters gamble totally failed and we got lucky there
breakdown in the secondary but thank god the eagles suck lol
thank you football gods
lamar could have burned him on that corner 3 steps sooner wtf
play dobbins
i cant believe we dont run the option anymore i cant understand why
gotta get boykin settled in good catch
ok boykin
can we stop the bootlegs these shits arent working
that ball looked so bad
the defense has given me hope the offense not so much so far but its still early
there is dobbins only carry today
wow love that play
make duvernay the wr2
duvernay me like
as soon as i see that rollout i already know its about to be a useless play
omg a pick play
are we ever gonna get a game called by tony and jim nantz
wow good shit lamar
we so hot we boyleing
two straight runs are we allowed to do that
beautiful
thats more like it
feed the boyle feedtheboyle
andrews in shambles
im feeling peters interception here
philly defends play well

uh ohhh you got lamard u friggin morons
who do you guys want to win steelers or browns
sanders couldnt escape the fort
were gonna feast on this eagles rg
oh hey the eagles got positive yards there
this defense is good
oof hollywood was open these batted passes are tough
we had two first downs on 2nd and 3rd just got tipped twice damn
this ol is young guards are very young players and skura has to get back in game shape
these commercials wtf
philly has a deep and talented d line folks chill
wish roman would call more straight forward run plays
the playcalling is looking better the offense is looking good that last series the eagles d just stepped up were looking great so far not every possession is gonna be perfect were fine
sam iron man koch
matt stover
wentz fell off so much dude
anthony averett lmao
get off the field ahhhhh get off the field ahhhh ahhh ahhhhhhhhhh
anthony a has been playing pretty well these past few weeks
lol sam koch looking so casualrelaxed on the sideline just another day at the office for him
damn is he okaykoed himself
ouch
damn i hope hes ok
man proche has looked so dynamic returning punts
ingram limping off
ingram slow monkas
i hope thats just a calf cramp for ingram luckily we have other rbs
that doesnt look right
another 3rd and longsmh
what even was that drive
who was even supposed to get that
this game is just listless so far
lamar still not looking like himself and the offensive line and play calling are still really sus roman needs to get it together already
why are lamars hot reads 5 yards from the first down like even if snead caught that no way was it going for a first down are bad plays being called or is lamar making the wrong read why arent we taking shots down field the playcalling has been ass this season
so i see we went back to the old ravens defense saving our ass and offense looking like a lame duck
savage
thats a turnover
fumble recovery
fumble all the way
thats our ball
fumble ball was moving
good kid but wentz is trash
clean strip babyyyy
streak continues if this holds
that better be a fucking fumble
his knees on his shoe no
andrews switch jerseys with boyle
hell yeah 19th game right hell yeah d
the young dudes on defense must just practice punching and yanking the ball out they are unbelievably good at turnovers
wow defense carrying the entire team what else is new
td pass incoming to mark andrews
apex ball hawks
boyle boykin nfl played by a bunch of men by lamar only throwing to boys
yay a completed pass
this defence got my dick hard
the gus that couldnt slow down
touchdown ravens

gus the bus
gus is definitely better than ingram at this point
wow running the ball works who would have thought
bus edwards hofer
offense 100 is feeling better than last week
thats why i love gus dude hits every hole at 100mph so even if he gets stopped he still gets yards
the bus
the teams we have played this year have covered the rollout so well that lamar needs to run somewhere else for real he runs right like every play
bengals are up 200 against indy
when you take 4 tabs before the game
that commercial is creepy as hell man wtf
anyone else have a creepy feeling about that commercial wtf was that
i pray no one poaches wink from us next year
wentz just accepting his fate at this point pathetic to watch him just stop and protect like throw it away dumbass
wentz used to be good
they booing hahaha
wentz looks bolleresque
damn the eagles really suck lol
are they gonna make a 1st down today
sack city
great return by proche even if it wasnt long in the end
im glad we got mcphee back i remember being upset we didnt resign him back in the day
proche looking like our best punt returner in years fields it well makes good decisions and usually gets a solid 10 yard return
how many more drives until we see jalen hurts
i thought the colts defense was good
oh boy snead come on we cant have that
this year im glad for a return to a little normalcy defense plays lights out while offense sucks ween
snead you got damn lucky there but great play regardless
willy dropped that one come on wiily
jesus christ snead
its ok snead iv that was still a hell of a play and it worked out in the end
snead cmon son
snead almost got marloned
why send ingram back out there and risk him aggravating the injury this feels like the exact scenario we drafted jk for
why is ingram in we have jk and gus why risk further injury
snead fumble happened because he is unfamiliar w catching the ball on deep routes
ingram doesnt need to be in the game if he hurt put in gus and jk
some of yall need to chill these are people too
justin tucker is elite
i swear for every reception we must have like two drops its actually insane
offense hasnt been great but were still up this shows you what generating pressure off of four rushers can do for our defense
this offense looks lethargic lamar cant be the only playmaker
this upcoming draft we need to draft all offensive linemen
these drops are just insane
that was a catchable ball for dobbins but im not going to complain because we cant get tds on every drive overall a good offensive drive and a fg puts us up 17
cant wait for edps reaction
17 points in a half is nothing to groan about folks
cant watch the game how does lamar and the offense look judging by the score it seems pretty good
i see you chris board
shoutout to anthony averett for not being trash lately
lets go defense calais is the best
who says we need a pass rusher
eagles punter mvp
campbell is a monster
defense is fucking eating holy shit

also that was a hell of a punt
i wanna see an average joes episode with calais campbell rushing a pass against 4 average joes and juat watch the carnage
judon just out there running
honestly ridiculous punt though
bruh imagine having carson wentz on your fantasy
so that puts them at what 7 total yards
afc north straight stomping on the colts
wtf was that lamar
that is a depressed dog mask lol
i dont like this passing man whats going on always so low
helmet straight to the knee ouch
something ive noticed it once you get under lamars skin he really struggles to overcome if we can fix that were unstoppable
that dude went straight for his knees
lol reset lamar
lamar pretending to be one of our tes
theres 2019 lamar
eagles game thread getting toxic lmaoo
dobbins looks so good making guys miss
what the fuck has happened to wentz he looked legit for a couple of seasons
5 total yards
holy fuck what is the oline doing
keep feeding dobbins
hey guys lets not get to another 4th and 43
fucking five ol penalties cmon
might as well just punt with 1st and 25 we will get the ball in better field position from wentz anyway lol
jesus
is this a record for illegal formations
bro are you kidding me 3 straight plays with 25 yards of penalties
stanley has 3 fucking penalties unacceptable
this oline is so bad and undisciplined to boot
this is when we take a shot down field to hollywood
the fuck refs
1st and 35 smh offensive line needs to get it together
if it gets to 4th down fuck it hey diddle diddle lamar up the middle
3 fucking flags in a row this is god damn unacceptable
i was just thinking that i was really enjoying how much the referees were swallowing their whistles this year lol this is a comeuppance of biblical proportions
why does lamar always throw sidearm
the whole o line taking turns fucking up
if i was the coach i would putting the oline through the wringer next practice
uh 1 deep shot
there aint much you can do on 3rd and 30 really got some yards and pin back the eagles on the punt
fuck it go deep
hurts to watch
that was a brutal series couldve easily gotten 3 more points on the board dont like what im seeing from the offence at all the bye is going to be really beneficial for us
why are we not taking shots downfield
up 170 in the 2nd defense is lights out offense looks like shit deja vu much
why havent they used brown yet that was the perfect drive
tackle him what the fuck
lmao they put in hurts
pleased to see growth from this offense week to week its not perfect yet but i believe lamar wants to be better than any of us could even imagine hell keep working
honestly props to wentz for the blocking there lmao
stupid ass browns
1st and 35 just throw some short passes no point in trying
jalen hurts my feelings
im honestly scared of hurts
lol
here we go with the stupid bullshit plays
so this is what it was like playing against lamar last year
eagles phasing in hurts this drive makes me giggle
not sure why were going 1 dimensional lately
its not fun to play against a mobile qb man lol
foot not down
thats not a catch 2nd foot was out
thats not a fucking catch
no way he caught that
bullshit luck on that ward catch
i dont know if he had control the whole time but think its the right call to stand
cant get mad at that hell of a fucking play
that looked like a catch from the front on angle cant be mad for getting a call right
my bad yall i meant to type homecooking
broour defense is so streaky lolwild
im not even sure what im watching anymore
he didnt get it
short lol
short
i think we got em
he aint get it
no way he got that
what a fucking stop
loud noises
can we please take a deep shot now
looool imagine not being able to sneak a yard
denied
let the shutout continue
lmao marlo screaming
i agree with the announcers carson needs to shoot under and he has it easy
guys i thought i hated ian eagles commentary but i am loving him and charles davis together
refs really making this game boring as shit
without bias where do u guys think our defense is ranked
alright lamar do some lamar shit
no turnovers please
come on harbs try for a fg at least
dobbins kind of rescued that play all on his own picked it up from a low position and managed to make 6 yards out of it
dobbins goes from 0 to 60 at once
lol philly trying to extend the misery
snaps are shit all year wtf
lol are the ravens not going to try to get a field goal not tryna sound greedy or anything but
dont understand why we took a timeout on phillys 3rd down and then are trying to run out the clock
seems like we aint even trying to score here might as well have kneeled
how has carson wentz managed to lose his starting job every single year of his career
you dont block koch koch blocks you
what kinda pussy shit
why not pass there and try get the 1st we see the clock out
mcphee just needed to step back once to get that
mcphee cmon
mcphee gotta get that
the d is more excited to give tucker a fg than roman is
half time awards only the defense
are you shitting me free fg attempt
what
wrong call it was ferguson horrible penalty
what is this sloppy shit
weak fucking call
nice try refs
fuck these refs
terrible call gifting them points
what a shit call
bullshit fucking call wow
weak ass call to negate an int
pussy ass refs
holy shit what a weak fucking roughing call
good they deserved to miss that ball dont lie
he thought he was tucker
well despite our best attempts philly still not in this thing lol
suck my fucking dick refs
did he just say ngata damn i miss that guy
philly got exactly what it deserved there soft rtp call and wentz bailed out of two interceptions go fuck yourselves
wjz trolling elliot with the tucker commercial
even pikachu is upset here in philly ian eagle 2020
tucker and royal farms lmao
halftime thoughts
cj board took a nasty hit in the wasny game went limp after the hit and is being carted off
are the browns good or terrible
all i can think is madden with charles davis
we cant even line up correctly
this is a very classic ravens game
why does this team have so much trouble lining up correctly how
i just want old ravens offense back
have we completely given up on rpos
houdini
amazing run thats what we want to see he should scramble more
lamar has to run the ball to be effective not because hes a bad passer but because defenses have to be worried about his dual threat ability
that just makes our offense so much more dynamic
another penalty wtf
theres a lamar run
enough with the penalties smh
i really hope this is a wake up call for our offense
yknow we lose yanda and now nobody knows how to play oline great
pretty sure the browns are not the kings of the north
raise the confidence of the whole offense pls
announcers really playing bingo with our offensive line
nice run duvernay p
ravens rbs 19 carries for 53 yards today
we are seeing our rbs hit in the backfield every running play

are they just beating their man horrendously or are we watching the read defender just play the read right
ooooo hollywood coulda had 6 there
hollywood heard me saying duv should be wr1
smallest possession receiver ever
dobbins running behind last years line woulda been fantastic
so sick of these 3 yard sidearm dump offs christ
eagles look like a cfl team today for sure
fucking hell o clean it up
way too many flags this week
why do you stop your momentum dobbins
the penalties this game wth
throw the damn thing away lamar
this offense manidk
so bet the falcons will blow it again
i wonder with this many false starts its something to do with ljs hard count
ref hit himself in the face with his whistle lmao dumbass
the guys committing penalties have been in this offense for years
are we just testing lamar to play with more yards orrrr
i love seeing the benglols again after they were so fucking annoying for years
lamar cmon man
why doesnt greg give lamar a checkdown
no offense no
throw it out of bounds dude thats 3 points down the drain
i cannot believe all these penalties man it is rediculous if i was lamar id be super pissed they cannot get any momentum because the whole oline is fucking up
that time was good playcalling by roman but the penalty killed that drive and the sack sealed the deal
idk if last year we were too used to flacco and got excited every time we came out big but 100 shit has slowed down this year and we have a reason to be pissed
our pass play design on 3rd down was garbage 2 deep outs stacking each other by 5 yards creating a traffic jam

lamar shouldve thrown it away but sheesh
wtf that was so lucky
that was a sweet play tbh
there we gowe get the ball back
this is why the offense needs to score points ffs
i didnt think the offense could fumble forward guess you can
offense please put life back into my soul
please offense offend
good return duv
every game our o scores 1 td our d gets us 1 and then we do nothing for the rest of the game it seems
duvernay is such a good returner
greg roman amazing screens with no blocks
lol should we go for 2
im not sure why we keep running to fletcher coxs side thats definitely the weak part of our line
our running game has no lanes today kudos to the eagles
hes fast
say it with your chest
he turned on the jets for that one
and there ya go
thats what im talkin about
thats the lamar we know
lamar

jackson

hype
there we go
love you lamar
thats what im talking about
kachow
we need this to be lamars turning point
we need more qb power inside runs are better for us offensively
calais fucking campbell is a beast
stop it youre killing him eagles oline blows
lmao campbell threw that oline man like a little boy unbelievable
campbell is so large
he made that boy look like a pillow
this game is gonna send campbell to the pro bowl
calais damn near clubbed that man to death
a 5th round pick guys
another ff
campbell for president
humph with a punch out so good
this defense is great to watch
marvin bringing the pawnch
saitamarlon humphrey
the humphrey hit
another punch by humphrey
marlon punch sighting
f r u i t

p u n c h
marlo dpoy
fruit punch
is that the 3rd game in a row marlos had a forced fumble
players id least want to get punched by

marlon humphrey
calais campbell
i enjoy our improved return game compared to last year
peanut punch i like that lol
marlon fruitpunchfree humphrey
thats defensive player of the year right there
humphrey is the best cb in the nfl
lamar go stunt on those hoes
there is a 50 chance the falcons still lose this week lol
ive been pretty impressed with elliot so far this season hes stepped up nicely replacing et3 having missed the past 2 seasons with injuries hed got a forced fumble and pass batted down and has had a few sacks i think this season
baker got benched
boykins running the wrong route lol
boykin and lamar hate each other
cmon boykin
why can you not add that to the end of the kick seems dumb
like its not even up for debate who was right lamar or boykin boykin was fucking blocking the corner into infinity never even looking for the ball
weve been whiffing big body receivers since we let q go
running the ball on second and 10 is so infuriating
yikes he was wide open
we got burned there
all the flags theyre throwing and none for holding
sure bitch about the pi there when your oline was holding carson
no we did not lol there was no contact
great play by jimmy
he had a hand on a hip with no pull that would have been ticky tack then they hit feet and both fell
humph is elite
how many dropped ints we have this year
lucky we didnt get a roughing the passer
not that i want a rtp but that was worse than calais earlier lol
wentz got cranked
omg another fucking flag
were lucky we didnt get two of those in a row
jesus fucking christ
dumb ass
with this trash ass like judon still cant make a play lol
lmaooo bengals blew a big lead
thought that was judon am shocked tbh
bullshit
fucking idiot wasnt even close
thanks ward for being a dumbass
if he just makes an effort to let up a little on the tackle they dont call that dumb mistake
this game is giving me a headache
mekari in interesting
was our offensive line coach replaced by a succubus
the fucking formation was all fucked just now it would have been another penalty
nick mark andrews boyle
great throw
was there ever a doubt
mr automatic
would have been good from 70
wow
a punchers chance maybe if that puncher is mike tyson
romans taking a good nap along with the oline and officiating squad
how bad is fluker if hes not getting any playing time i thought we brought him in specifically for rg

all but one other 1pm game are already over we still have 10 minutes left in this thing
d just came up huge there
man i love our defense so god damn much
really like seeing jimmy out there hes still a damn good db even if hes not the shutdown corner he used to be
fuck yeah jimmy our cb depth is unfair
jimmy is as sticky as ever
jimmy could still be the best in our db room
need one of those good ole 2019 8 minute td drives here
lets get a fucking td here and bury this
lotta flags more than i care to see that being said close this one out so that we can healrest for the upcoming bye week
thats like what the 3rd illegal formation we have to tighten up this stuff
lamar just pump faked so hard he almost threw himself forward lmao
im was excited that jimmy resigned happy its still working out
these fucking refs
this is so bad on the offensive line
we need the 2019 ravens offense to magically appear and eat the clock for 8 minutes lol
lol these penalties make the line run sprints all through the bye week
how are we the only team in the league that gets offensive line penalties right now
who the fuck wants to watch this
our team is definitely undisciplined but they have ignored some blatant holds by the eagles oline fucking hell
how long do they want this game to go lol
they absolutely cannot call that hold with all that theyve let go this year fucking ridiculous
the refs have something big up their asses im pretty sure its a wad of 100s
the offense looks fine
this game is literally unwatchable what a laughable offense
the ironic thing is the actual pass blocking has been much better so my guess is that they have put some of these changes in to get an edge and theyre just walking a bit too close to the line on them
well i lowkey love hollywood gets it done
bro our offensive line is actually so shit now
some of you all keep saying offense but its the damn o line
that was the 4th drive that was killed by penalties
10 penalties for 73 yards

god damn
tucker with 3 for the field tuck right there
patriots lost to the broncos lmao
the only blatantly wrong call has been the roughing the passer at the end of the first half you cant really argue formation penalties or offsidesfalse starts it would be nice if they called some holds on the eagles oline but this is the most undisciplined ravens team in the past few years by far
hump with a sack
second straight week our pass rush been eating
fucking tackle that asshole
how did we just allow that
humphrey is a fucking boss
this game is so weird
how the fuck do you allow wentz to run for 40 yards lmao
we just let carson wentz run 40 yards
hump with the sack
a flag thats not on us celebrate
i really think its because hes a qb didnt want foul
carson lamar jackson wentz
that looked like everyone thought the other person was going get him down
queen buddy what was that
lets go texans
as long as the titans show up next week
this is why i get annoyed not going for a score with a minute left in the half the eagles arent rolling over put them away
joker szn
wentz got blown up on that pick by bowser
why tf is this game so longggg lol
he didnt even catch it lol
of course he dropped it
at this rate the texans titans game is going to go all 10 minutes of ot before this game is over lmao
we can never get the easy pick
glad our defence is keeping these 2nd halves entertaining every week
fuck it just do it again
fuck
2 dropped picks this game
so many dropped ints
at least bowser made a good play on the pressure
humphrey like wolverine looking for that fumble
the only other 1pm game going is in ot and we have more than 4 minutes left the ot game will probably end before ours at this rate
lol nice push off
peters looks off today
what the fuck is going on
bruh if they get this its a one score game
please just run the ball and end this game without ever giving philly another touch
give me a fucking break dude
eagles nobodies show up more than some of our starters
if were playing like this against the fucking eaglesoh man playoffs aint gonna be fun
run the fucking ball and eat clock roman you fucking dipshit
what the fuck are we doing dude we should have put this away last quarter
how is this game this close dammit wtf
did the ravens take a team nap during halftime were looking dead out there
marcus peters looks banged up slow to get up every time hes given up a lot of plays this second half
the fucking ot game is over and we havent hit the 2 minute warning why is this the longest game
lmao the texans titans game really finished earlier than this game which is not even close to being done
still cant blame the d weve been dominant on defense theyre just gassed because our offense isnt taking up time like we did last year
cant get 3 yards on play fake this ol is garbage
offense needs to pick it up now
we better run here on 2nd im delayed
shocking holding what a fucking surprise
embarassing
how many damn holding penalties are we gonna commit
fucking offensive penalties i cant even
lol another offensive penalty at the worst possible time
now truly thankful for the titans covid mishapscuz if not we would be playing the steelers right afterwards now we have an extra week to get this shit fixed
penalties fucked the ravens in the ass with a 10 ft pole if they lose
harbaugh isnt gonna go easy on em at our next practice
we have to trust lamar to help us seal the deal
fuck these penalties
bruhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
this is disgusting
this is infuriating they should be killing this team
here we go another bad drive
jfc no one was open
this was supposed to be a cake walk
my god this team dude come on this shouldnt be close
83 penalty yards this game
well thanks for the early bye week we need it
def no mvp repeat
this offense is reminding me of the 20152017 offense regarding horrific penalties
11 penalties for 84 yards
fire roman
this team wants to make me drink
are you fucking serious on this dpi
i absolutely hate the throw away lamar has to slide if hes giving up on the play saved them a timeout
ravens are just shitting bricks
there it is boys we gonna lose
lamar needs to stop adding 10 yards to every play
if you move out of the pocket stop going 10 yards backwards before you throw the ball its so fucking irritating
youve gotta be fucking kidding me
holy fuck what an awful call
fuck
thats some bullshit
what the fuck are yall doing
why were all the routes deep nothing underneath for 9 damn yards
are you fucking kidding me
how is that dpi
bullshit
this is serious flacco era vibes
27 seconds time of last possession
fuck you refs are you kidding me
im so fucking tired of refs sucking ass
fuck
were fucked
fucking hate this
this game is rigged
what a shitty call
what the fuck
the team has played sloppy today but that was not a penalty
this is poetic
are you serious
l o fucking l at this game already
pathetic defense
ffs now were going to loose this
132 yards
deja fucking vu didnt this already happen the last time we played philly theyre gonna score and miss the 2pt conversion
relax fuckers we need a game like this so the team can learn
bowser got tackled by their lineman on that huge dpi but of course lets call it on the ravens
just gotta hope we can stop their incoming 2pt conversion tbh
o line is the problem open your eyes
carson flacco wentz
p a t h e t i c
this feels like the old days of the ravens defense giving up the lead
inventing the second half was a mistake
please stop the 2 point
im glad they just went ahead and scored put gro and lamar in a highpressure position they need to prove it
there we go fuck
if the refs werent homecooking this would be a 587 game
luckily the eagles are bigger clowns then us
im like what happened to the original plot of the movie
also can this announcer shut the fuck up this game isnt over
thanks to the eagles for some dumb playcalling on the conversion there
judon
there you go judon
finally taco bell did something
fuck you
false start from the left tackle and we still stop them fuck you eagles
that was a false start as well but id take it
they have some many uncalled false starts its ridiculous
lol theyre playing fly eagles fly after that yikes
that was a real good kick hell of a job by proche
fucking finally judon and wow this was too close that was a fucking false start too
whos 28 poor dude got lit the fuck up
as bad as the offense has looked they could still get the ball back
carson wentz looks like prince harrys long lost cousin
this game had major bills vs ravens vibes where for some reason it was a lot closer than it shouldve been with a bunch of flaggery
oof too close for comfort we need a lot of work but 51 with work to do is fine
just be happy the eagles dropped a wide open td early in the game this could have been a well deserved l and we know it
im still ticked off at the offense even if they win the defense gift wrapped them multiple opportunities to put this thing away romans called better plays but honestly hes still very inconsistent top that with the constant penalties by the oline although some were complete bs also the refs are garbage
has anyone noticed that the eagles lt has been jumping the snap by a fraction all game
game
lmao lamar is hilarious
yay we won barley
the ugliest of wins
another ugly ass win
had to be lamar to ice it one thing i will say is running him less seems to have made those deceptive keeper plays much more effective
go and fucking score so we can pretend like this wasnt a close game
fuck it we take these
ballgame

lucky to get out of here with a win and thats what matters
wow we didnt blow a 16 pt lead with 6 mins left lets celebrate like crazy
llama wanted to score lol
ravens 30 eagles refs 28
i mean if were gonna play like this at least we get a win cant be too mad just a bit mad
offense identity needs to change now if we want to be competitive in the playoffs
this game sucked but were still a good team time to get to work and show out after the bye
was way closer than it was ever allowed to be
we have a garbage game where we play down every year it sucks but its in our dna close them out asap and move onto the next game is the only thing we can do
should we bench jk then according to you people just checking
i swear this sub is toxic were up 170 yet everyone here is saying this game is ugly like you guys must have never watched us win 137 4 years ago or losing a 129 game against the browns two years ago or 63 win over the chiefs during our superbowl year yall bandwagons dont know shit
thats what happens when the offense does nothing defense starts fucking up
even if the ravens win this game they need to make a trade this team is smoke and mirrors the defense is great but cant carry the offense when is keeps getting 3 and outs really need to simplify the offense because right now the execution is just piss poor
lol gregs back at it with the gimmicks olines falling asleep too
bench ingram
like were gonna lose this game if lamar doesnt get his fucking shit together
can the people who say the offense is trash stop prefacing it with i will say what no one has ever dared to say as if this sub hasnt been lobbying for greg roman to be fired and lamar to retroactively give back his mvp since week 2
5th rounder for derrick henry
this is why webbitch about the offense because this game should have been over essentially an hour ago anyone who says we complain fuck off
how can you watch this team and be optimistic about january football
i hope we all now understand our offense is terrible and being up 170 against the eagles doesnt mean were whining fuck this game
this is the first time ive seen carson wentz play since like 2017 has dude been really this ass how can u go for an obvious mvp to a possible back up in the span of 2 years
oh that pass was tipped thank god that would have been ugly if he just missed by that much lmao
when do we start worrying about the offense lol
that route was shit by snead why did he meander across the defenders face stay flat and he woulda had an easy catch
oh look when we run the ball we score imagine that
its amazing how much this offense has regressed
why are we not taking deep shots
thats a catch unfortunately
is john fox consulting our offense
lets not go 3 and out after getting the ball at halftime ok
ugh i kinda want the browns to beat pittsburgh to give them their first loss and tighten the race
the ravens wont be satisfied until every offensive player has a false start
when the offense is struggling against the 131 eagles
finally a good drive and touchdown
not bad for a quarterback
29 consecutive games of 20 points im so tired of the whining
blame is on ward for that td why tf would you do that
looking like we shouldnt have got rid of hurst
10 penalties for us today most of them are presnap and mental errors absolutely awful
these past 3 games have felt like the same game over and over again were getting so spoiled we find blowouts boring
these lamar stats arent even too bad but to the eye everything looks plain bad
i swear the refs has it out for us
idc what anyone says our offense has looked decent and the only reason this game is close is cause of penalties if we clean those up well beat pittsburgh
are we allowed to start worrying now or
judon may be the most useless defender in the nfl
12 penalties and 132 penalty yards

fuck these refs
for the first time in his career judon made a play that was not a penalty
we are so fucking lucky they missed that field goal in the 2nd quarter
proche was a really good pick havent seen a 6th rounder contribute this much for a long time
ravens 41 and up 170 at half

ravens sub wtf roman omg lamar is dead fire everyone we are rebuilding this year whos the next qb in the draft
and some of u clowns were really questioning our qb
you can tell someone is a newfan when they give up faith after a couple bad drives
bro in order to pick up a 3rd and 30 you gotta throw it 30 yards downfield not 5
we get the ball back but it would be nice to score again but they wont lol
were honestly lucky its not 1714 lol
some of yall ravens are done team sucks move them to indy and give the steelers the division
cut boykin
the offense needs to fucking exist on the next drive or the game could become uncomfortable
yall doubting we could do it can fuck off lol youve gotta have faith no matter what
i swear our fans are so spoiled yeah its been a rough game for sure but how the hell do i see so many people in this subreddit give up on lamar if you cant handle this please leave your bandwagon fandom is not welcomed
so sure the eagles came back and made them sweat but they had literally ten plays that were just straight toss ups untimely penalties that kept them in the game and every single bounce go their way fumble for an td

it wasnt pretty but it wasnt as bad as you think it is right now
im not tipping shit to philly only got close because of shitty officiating
we need to make a move for a offensive player no juice from our wr core
poor campbell he signed here because he thought it was the best chance at a super bowl oh well
1 rushing play doesnt go as intended

greg roman i smell 60 pass attempts
so far the eagles d looks good against the run but our d looks amazing 3rd 3 and out eagirls havent even gotten a first down
the offense fucking sucks
our boys got the dropsies again
i dont want to hear any shit for calling for romans head sure were goodand if we win well be 51 but this offense has serious struggles we get into 3rd and longs and have a terrible passing gamelamar hasnt been as good this year and a lot of it comes from culley and roman
offense looks shitty yet we are winning 170
lamar is playing like shit lately
baker mayfield

410 43 yds 2 int 2 sacks


lamar needs to stop throwing side and changing his arm angle every throw when the pocket is clean it either gets tipped or its inaccurate i understand when hes on the run and try and fit it in tight windows but no need for it in the pocket
3rd and 30

screen for 6 yards
yeesh our offense isnt even close to the boogeyman that we were last year

guess were back to a defensive primary identity again
i do not like this play calling

this offence cant be happy with how they are performing
worst fucking 57 seconds ive ever seen wtf are we doing
we shut these punks out like we should have done cincinnati
once again i think we need to pass our way out of this funk lamar is a semicold 3 pt shooter right now
im on your head today roman whats up with the soft playcalling
the one thing you dont do is take a sack there lamar plays hero ball way too often
i bet we dont score any this half
vintage jackson didnt spend that long trying to buy time

og jackson use to just takeoff and gone
how do you like that lamar haters
fuckers in rnfl telling me always in the barber shop
lamar jackson aint bout this lamar jackson aint bout that
my boy a bd on fucking lamron and them
he he they say that nigga dont be putting in no work
shut the fuck up
yall niggas aint know shit
all yall motherfuckers talkin about
lamar jackson aint no hitter
lamar jackson aint this
lamar jackson a fake
shut the fuck up
yall dont live with that nigga
yall know that nigga got caught with a ratchet
shootin at the police and shit
nigga been on probation since fuckin i dont know when
motherfucker stop fuckin playin him like that
them niggas savages out there
if i catch another motherfucker talking sweet about lamar jackson
im fucking beatin they ass
im not fucking playin no more
yall know them niggas roll with lil reese and them
love llama
browns getting exposed
hump gave up the play to hightower but the playcall put him on an island

i dont like when humphrey is on an island while playing in the slot hes much better as a boundary corner in that respect
run the ball use gus or jk pass to duvernay be smart play smart

please
tuck god
lamar has actually played pretty well today i give him a b
we 100 deserve to lose if they comeback
this is what happens when you rely too heavy in your defence

lamar and co have got to do something now
these refs cant keep only calling holds on one fucking team fuck these pieces of shit
oh great another penalty harbaugh can yell at the ref all he wants he needs to be yelling at marty and his offense

edit ok roman not marty basically the same thing this season
my name is greg roman and i get fired for obvious reasons
god damn it please dont blow this
we are really about to give up a td huh
crazy that we didnt have a single penalty until the score was 170 and we were driving again mid second then we accumulated 13 consecutive penalties since then while the eagles have gotten 1 we must really be undisciplined huh
judon only does stuff when hes unblocked idc
welcome back to the flacco era i guess
so if we can hang on to win this its probably the best of both worlds keep pace in the division but have all that work to do going into the bye before pitt
fuck the refs
lol they scored once why are you all acting like whiney babies
so are you anyone who criticizes the offense is bandwagon guys ready to acknowledge that our offense does in fact have some pretty serious issues
this team is just shitting the bed completely on offense again were lucky philly is awful
we are so ungrateful fans because we are 41 and complaining about our offense

fuck this giving up play calling
with this offense pittsburgh is going to destroy us
why is our offense so stagnant i just dont get it run the ball
this eagles offense is worst than flaccos absolute worst kinda feel bad for them
didnt lamar loose a close friend recently some of yall need to chill
roman wtf was that 1st and 35 all 3 play calls were short yardage plays
stop with the downvotes it was a damn catch credit where credit is due
were making fun of bakers numbers but besides the ints almost identical to lamars
i love how a bad day for jackson is considered a great game for every other qb in the league
another missed sack another wide open recevier
peters keeps fucking giving up finish the damn play dude
lol we are fucking frauds
lamar is a bad passer this year
im really hoping i can find a single ticket to the steelers game in 2 weeks the ones for browns steelers are going for 390 on ticketmaster id imagine our prices would be about the same
lets go bois
any ravens fans in philly rn
so is marlon covering 13 on eagles right
we should run over these guys pound the rock
how many punchouts will marlo get
what the fuck is this schedule commercial lmfao
front on these moes
lfg flockgang
threw out my back so im watching from bed

lesgo flock
lets goooooooooooo
we on defense first boiz
starting on d
yo bat man is in the stadium
lets go boys
american tv and their god damn adverts
is it just my tv or do the eagles uniforms look kinda blue
calais gonna getcha
great start
burrow is watching this like it haunts me lol
great start on d
first 2 plays lost yards lets go d
our dline seems to be improving
defense is on fire
wentz going to be sacked 10 times today
gonna be a long day for wentz
calais
wow good thing he dropped that
f in the chat for wentz
holy cow he dropped it how is he open
he had us beat thanks for the drop
we got lucky af wtf happened there
cmon mp
he had the pass just dropped it we got lucky
thank god the eagles are big fucking suck otherwise thats a huge play peters what are you doing baby
wow we were lucky that was a great start and there was some form of awful busted coverage
we got so fucking lucky lol
lol 3rd and 22 almost turned into a disaster for us
you guys are so quick to bench people lol
like thats an option play but not one that fooled anyone last year i had no clue who has the ball half the time
this is why we throw to duv
duuuuuuv
i love that we actually used a bunch formation to help get a player open this is what we need in the passing game
duuuuuuuuuuuuvvvvvvvvv
duuuuuuuuuv
rush rush pass rush rush pass

hmm
free him please harbaugh
what a play
bruh
damn son
that was just mmhmm
i love it
that still wasnt a clean drive keep stacking reps and getting better end of the season these guys are going to look so good
feeling good today
okay cover the receivers now
they really dont trust wentz to throw it
be better offense line
second time we got away with a dropped pass there
dang my nfl app stream is really far behind which is unusual
yikes
oh he got oofed hope hes ok
we could use more pass rush off the edge but the d line has been doing a great job at pushing in the interior weve gotten pressure up the center and have been way better against the run i really like what calais campbell is doing for this team
first time im really seeing our defensive line looking dominant all season
i love these bb commercials lmao
damn ingram looks hurt
wtf
he hurt his shoulder
strategy for philly defensively cry and pray
ingram no i hope youre ok
scary
yikes man
ive never bit my tongue so hard
jfc
will we ever run a play from under center
what are these play calls stop having lamar throw slants when we need 10 yards for the first allow him to throw it down the damn field
the offense is still dead
cowboys fan here were counting on you to keep the nfc east trash for us so im cheering for you
heres the offensive game plan run for 2 yards pass incomplete pass incomplete punt repeat until d gifts you a turnover
im trying not to panic about this game but im definitely worried about our oline and offense this year
ive been frustrated by playcalling but todays game feels like lamar is just really off even the completions have been super iffy
x200b

fumble

ravens recooer
wtf is this game lol
lol
thats a fumble
the hell was that pitch about
elliots foot is under wentzs knee
hot potato
also my toddler has learned how to turn off the cable box unrelated im selling a cute toddler anyone want one
thats close gotta stand though
ball was moving before the knee was down
that is a fumble i havent seen anyone this ball hungry since ginger lynn
nice work by elliot
all the offensive problems are in execution lj needs to be slightly more accurate and receivers need to catch the damn ball

hot take play calls have been ok
damn one if these times lamar will keep god damnit
thats a fumble
dope dope
fumble 100
balls coming out way before the knee is down
refs are so flag happy they literally throw inadvertent flags at least once a game pathetic
these simple run plays are key 3 yards right there
i miss the rpo
our offense is not playing well at the same time whats wrong with this team being the old defensive monster ravens but with a more exciting offense that can make plays
i think its one of those situations where theres not enough to change the onfield call regardless of which way they called it
our backs are working so damn for 23 yard gains
maybe the offense will have a chance at scoring this drive
we should go back to the basics i feel roman trying to be cute with his play calling
great d

i need some gus in my life
i want to see us get hollywood involved around the redzone
run run run
yessssssss
gus is the man
nice run by gus
putting it on them mushroom stamp style
awe yeah
all aboard
love this team
fly ravens fly on the road to victory

r a v e n s ravens
glad we finally did something after those last two terrible possessions
were so lucky the eagles are trash but great teams are suppose to trash bad teams so were doing our job
i would love to start using the pistol less and get to more traditional shotgun in neutral situations more
thats how you block offensive line keep it up
one thing bad about all this success is all the bandwagons i dont want the ravens to be the warriors of the nfl
browns disappointing per usual
do you guys think this cardboard guy was paid as an actor or as a model

edit oh nevermind
sacked
damn 12 total yards
his own player almost sacked him lmao
its fun seeing the ravens d dominate again
his oline should get the 05 sack lol
love hearing those boos
defense mad they didnt get the shutout last week
100 hurts will play the 2nd half
lets go defense
wentz almost got sacked by his own team
i feel the pain of eagles fans man
what are the odds that we can get wentz benched before of our d
were those the first boos from eagles fans
these eagles are very likely to go to the playoffs
a snead sighting
that was close willie
snead gave me a heart attack just now good catch
well thats it for snead
have the eagles even gotten a first down yet
another td and this game is probably over frfr
i knew they were fucked from the first play of the game if you let us rush 4 and get pressure youre toast lol
my heart
the eagles have 3 yards of total offense so far this defense is ridiculous
good to see snead involved fumble is a rare thing tbf
our d is really good makes me so happy to see a smothering ravens defense
someone make a lamars off bot
dodged a bullet there
first appearance by willie snead this season lol and he fumbled
more plays like that tho
jesus christ its a good thing we are playing the eagles mistakes like this against the steelers and we are in trouble
snead snead snead
me yes a nice catch and run no dropped pass

snead lets drop it during the run
omg lamar took the intermediate crosser
snead has to be more careful there he has to know hes gonna get caught from behind
nice draw play
and thats a quick way to ride some pine finish the play and hold the fucking ball
god were getting lucky today
one of my neighbors is a big philly fan if we win i light spend some extra time outside wearing my jersey
every time ingram gets in the open he looks as though hes about to trip
we dominated cindy and they are up 21 to 0
god damn sneed thank god you were close to the sideline
give it to gus holy crap
that defensive line getting penetration on second down was concerning that being said the refs missed the facemask on gus
goat
come on dobbie
lol at least our defense has been exciting
id go for it give the offense more reps
22 straight quarters scoring now also thanks for giving them love cbs
its just fucking automatic with him
dobbie has drop
people suggesting that catch was hard for dobbins need to be put down jfc
lmao pete carrol talking about a game plan not making it
koch corralling the high snap like a boss
love tucker
my iphone can shoot an emp now is that a violation of the geneva convention
biggest indicator of how good our locker room is is peters coming in making a tackle attempt used to see him begging off tackles
i missed gus the bus td fuck
wowowowow
taking bets for marlons first ff today my money is on before halftime
damn the d is playing so well today
quite a lot of illegal formations already today line judge is not playing with either team
look at his emotion hes fired up
calais
side note its been real nice to see how chill this game thread has been so far
thats a good punt from philly
why would you make a mustang an suv
thank you edc for this blessing
this is old school ravens football and i fucking love in
if the d has suddenly woken up and plays like this every week we may not even need 2019 lj
lamar needs to throw better what is wrong
wtf was that pass
lamar needs like an intensive throwing camp over the bye week
jk
here we go finally a play where you have no clue has the ball for a sec
nice draw play fool their line
the lamar guaranteed 10 yard scramble
draws are working today
turns out i hate leblanc
some one mute the trumpet
jk dobbins hell yeah
dobbins thats what we want to see
currently a 97 chance of victory according to espn
jk is a keeper i like seeing him increasingly more hell be rb1 next year
i love these draw plays huge gains on 1st downs with them
dobbins is good when he gets multiple touches
fuck
this o line is
lamar out here making my heart explode protect yoself man
did we bench powers for tyre phillips
nothing hits quite like that first ice cold miller lite on gameday
okay i get the false starts and shit but thats two calls for oline not on the line
yay another flag
another flag
it really irks me that we seem to always break out of the huddle with fuck all time left on the play clock
what the fuck man effectively killed this drive
goddamn another flag
harbs needs to get up in this lines asshole
refs calling everything wtf
another penalty what the fuck
lol lets just keep moving it on back
what the hell
going backwards
make that six flags from the oline holy shit
how many flags can we get on one series
ravens what in the fuck are you doing right now
just punt
browns benefited from beating up on shit teams this division is going to be a dogfight between us and pittsburgh cleveland still cant compete
come the fuck on with the flags bro
bruh the oline is going full retard right now
fucking offensive line is bullshit
lets get a false start here and make it 1st 30
we are the only team in the nfl getting called for these lmao
lamar obviously doesnt like this o line
im fucking done with roman cant wait until a terrible organization offers this clown a hc job
1st 35 lol
1st and 35
oh so we dont call facemasks on our running back but now we call everything

i feel like this is an antibattery drive
refs are fucking killing us wtf
lamar deep ball incoming
harbs about to stroke out
the refs just feel bad i guess
marquise brown and mark andrews are nonexistent
wtf is this lack of discipline
these refs are spazzing out with these flags
time for jk dobbins to show that hes really ray rice jr
fuck it 3 deep shots

i almost forgot that you could get holding calls in the nfl
135 o
1st and 35 lmao
another tipped pass
love it when opposing teams are getting smashed and they celebrate the littlest things haha
this possession looked like pure shit
offensive focus is just not there you can see it drive by drive when its all locked in it looks great for a drive
that was pretty pathetic but it wasnt lamars fault now him only throwing these sidearm passes is kind of worrying
damn this commercial is slapping right now good shit lol
where is my mind is such a song
i dont think lamar is letting the play develop enough i dont think roman is just calling slants lamar is passing to the checkdowns
you would think that an offense that has to practice against our defense would be better but then again i remember the days when they also had to practice against goose ad and ray
just tuned in offense still looking off
lol the ravens are team jalen i guess
very few teams if any would throw long passes on 3rd and 30 guys its not smart
anyone remember that lady that used to bring a duck call to games sat in the 500s and wouldnt stop blowing that fucker im getting flashbacks
good for jalen
hey thats our move
ian eagle was so impressed by that 3 yard gain
is hurts the new kaep
theyve run a new play every play this drive lmao they really want it
falcons vs vikings and washington vs giants lol absolutely pathetic
this game should be called the wooder bowl
philly is out here pulling the madden plays what the fuck is going on also is this the beginning of wentzs benching
did ward even touch the ground
no catch
incomplete
are they blind it looked like the second foot bounced in bounds
you gotta be fucking kidding me
lame ah well
catch
ridiculously unlucky that his knee fell on marlons foot
2nd lucky drop for us
lmfao best pass of the day beautiful rainbow for nothing
kinda crazy that if marlons foot isnt there it might not be a catch

i love the sun

no eagles shall see the ball
lollll yikes
eagles settle for a field goal
eagles gonna eagle lol
short
s h o r t
didnt get it
thats the eagles season summed up in a nutshell right there with sanders dropping the wide open td pass and then wentz not getting the fourth down conversion
no way he got that
100 short
if we can get points this last minute we sitting real pretty
you get nothing
shutout in tact
feel like an option play with hurts there wouldve converted that
they shouldve kept that other guy in lol
lmao eagles
gotta feel bad for wentz
lol how is it under review lol
gottem
now its under review what were we just doing lol
woooooo
we already did 99yds drive with under one minute left lets repeat that
if we score again before half time just bring out rg3 when we come back
a quick drive down for 3 wouldnt be bad 6 even better
so why did we not try to go get a fg thats the first time in a long time that didnt happen
why not try and make something happen in the last 50something seconds
i dont get it we almost had a full minute should be trying to drive down the field and take it to zero
wtf why did we kill the clock but call a timeout earlier
force a turnover on first down and get some points before the half
theyre gonna call tucker and try for an fg
mcphee noooooo
pheeeeeee you got to grab that
almost called that come on mcphee
roman saw the sub and said you fuckers wanted to see more runs lol
theyre about to come back out with hurts wentz looks hurt
holy shit so close
how did he not catch that
juuust over his head
lmao mcphee come on dude
mcphee lol
greg roman need to cut that ugly mullet off
guys im pretty sure its the head coach johns call to be conservative at that point of the game ita not greg roman he is given the plan and draws up the plays according to it

throw that hail mary and theres a decent chance of a pick six
you dont take your time outs to get the ball back late to just hand the ball off

disagree
well thats annoying
damn that sounds like something judon would do
ahhh calais taking a page out of the judon playbook
ball dont lie
block and return it lets gooooo
omg that pick was taken away for a rouging the passer what a catch clark lol
thats what they get
that aint falco tucker
nope boo birds out in philly
fucking bullshit roughing call
bumass eagles did all that for nothing
glad he missed shouldnt have had the opportunity to kick it anyways
haha

x200b

no gimmies
lol
ball dont lie
eagles have some problems they are not gonna win very many games this year if this is how they are gonna play the nfc east as a whole is so fucking bad this year 6 wins could be enough to take the division
damn i hope we bring it to pitt fuck that team
holy crap i forgot we started on defense w
lamar will get right but we need to see it now
all of our games in the beginning of last season looked like this remember the cardinals

also remember no preseason is hurting our very young offense lamar also didnt get to work with his throwing coach during the off season like he did last year
see more hurts sounds like the announcers are wishing for injuries
embarrassing
its like have we played offense before
this sidearm bullshit has got to go
we need a guard my god
bengals blew a big lead
thats my mf qb
im honestly not too confident in a 17 point lead we saw their offense can do stuff when hurts came in and we have yet to really score just from our offense all 17 points have been from defensive play
seriously though what is up with the oline and penalties today
what the fuck these penalties
false start michael oher
fuck if duvernay turns that into a fly route he is wide open and gone

edit oops may have been proche actually
wtf did these guys drink 20 cups of coffee before the game xd
thats the lamar i know and love
finally andrews gets a catch
andrews site
draft oline
way too many penalties by the offensive line today i guess im their defense this is one of the best defensive fronts in the nfl
wow our ol is sucking collective ass right now
these penalties are disgusting
i mean do we want to play or just keep getting flags
duuuuuuuuu
odds on skura getting a flag at some point
duvernay should be wr 1 lol
average of 10 yards to go on 3rd down jfc
hollywood
love that play chiefs do it all the time and we should be doing it more too
roman is cam cameron in the pass game sometimes a big reliance on iso routes for the wrs
he wouldve scored if he didnt fall
tripped over air again
its spreading to the te now
definitely having a sloppy game tbh its okay it happens but sloppy still
no one open
ugly punt by sam is it windy
fuck these flags
throw it away instead of costing us points
they need a bye this is shitshow level offense
i just dont get why we are so bad on offense penalty after penalty same boring play calling something needs to change fast
jesus we cannot take advantage of 1on1 on the outside between the numbers and the sideline

eagles are a pro team and wins in the nfl are hard as hell you rarely see a spread higher than 135 points just wanting our o to take that next step if we can hit them at 50 my gosh
what the fuck
defense can only carry the game for so long
are you fucking kidding me
everytime i notice judon i am miffed
well shit
yoooo what the hell was that
fucking judon
well fuck
fucking hurts bro
smhhhhhhhhhhh
offense needs to wake the hell up now
mark ingram out for the rest of the game
going for two wasan interesting choice
hurts holds on to that option for wayyy too long
were so unlucky lol
ingram is our for the game
im glad were not just gonna get by on the other team being awful this team needs to be punched in the mouth hopefully they realize whatever has been going on with this team isnt good enough
pedersons a fuckin moron going for two lol
the baltimore duvernays
durvernay needs more touches dudes a jet
i feel like duvernay is becoming a tyreek type better than hollywood has
much better roman
good pass
run game is not where it was last year either not just the pass game
aye see what happens when you drop back and step into a nonside arm throw my man lamar
now go for 2 here
wow they really just left the second level of the defense completely open
lol easy mode this team is fucking silly
that was a great drive
lets go
nice run from lamar we should do that more often
you love to see it
lamar action mvp jackson
lamarrrrrrrr
awesome drive there great response to the td
that is the same running play lamar scored his 52 yard td run against wft on

scary to see our franchise qb running between the tackles but that play is pretty filthy

confirmed today that davis is the best announcer outside of the boi romo
we beating that steelers record
our offense is fucking nasty when we are calling plays to score points it just seems like when we are up big our offense switches to protect lamar mode and our offense doesnt work when lamar isnt taking zone reads
what was that oline man doing lmao
i fucking love every player on our defense
man that dudes fucking huge
that move makes me think that campbell probably doesnt fight a slice on the golf course
marlo again lmao
hump punch
it bothers me that the eagles are in the running for their division with such a garbage oline
campbell is just so large
no mas wentz
that punch lmaoo
marlon punch
183 is a weird score
theres our marlo ff
marlon with another punch out my god what a stud
the eagles are really dropping the ball
fruit punch strikes again
defense nasty swag
bengals were up 210 its 2721 bengals now colts came back
youre better off not having the ball anywhere around marlon legit dont throw towards him dont be running near him stay the fuck away from him
what the fuck is marlons training regimen dude is rocky balboa
what was the plan there roman
the eagles need hurts in the game wo him in as a runnerdecoy their offense has been dreadful
marlon been doing that one punch man workout
ah shit phillips ran off the field hope he okay
whoever that guys who asked me why i thought our oline would seriously regress and disagreed with me fuck you
seems like boikins always makes a bad play every game now
wait why is it declined
they ran into koch
why did we decline that
idk what it is but boykin doesnt seem to know the right playcall because ive seen him multiple times not run the right route that lamar throws
why did we decline that is it a rekick
running into the kicker is only 5 yardsroughing the kicker is 15 yards and a first down
humph lucky there was no flag there
jimmy still got it
nice play jimmay
nice play by jimmy
holy shit based jimmy smith
jimmy smith looks like hes in sb47 form
dude we need to catch one of these easy fucking picks
the streams are sucking ass rn
why was peters playing so far off of someone hes faster than
surprised no flag tbh
i think that was roughing
wentz saw the rush and was like f this im out
campbell needs to do a goose flop
oh fuck off
stupid play
i swear our guys that struggle to get to the qb always go for the late hit just to say they did something
omfg
theyve been hitting him late almost every play cmon guys the man isnt even playing well let him be
i hate it
almost a late hit by judon there again
jihad ward trying to let the eagles cover
damn who pissed him off lol
this defense and rtp penalties in dumb moments against bad teams

name a more iconic duo
just a little bit open lol
jihad nooooo
titans this l today
even though we dont look amazing offensively i still love out tem hope we can improve
same situation as the houston game we good
he did hurt himself god damn it
we need this bye week so badly man
mekari in instead of tyre
titans might lose
nick boyle has sure hands man
feedtheboyle
nice pass lamar
great catch by boyle
jackson can throw darts but really hasnt shown many good touchloft throws at all need to open lanes again with the run game for that to be successful like last season
nick boyle is the star of the offense today thats sad
tuck
ravens offense going for the minimally viable product
alright d needs to focus up
just business as usual for tucker
that accuracy my goodness
cant cuck the tuck
just no flags please
with our defense playing better i think this team will be making trade for some offensive help before the deadline
not sure this was a hot decision tbh its still a game
jimmy smith never stops being good
pour one out for wentz
jimmy is balling the fuck out today
lmao bengals are losing
always loved jimmy
stop playing with jimmy today man
jimmy again
lmao did peters just fall down on his own
jimmy smith has had a hell of a game
deshaun watson is incredible
the oline is going to be gassed with all the extra reps they will be getting
lol another illegal formation absolutely brutal
what the fuck
what the fuck how is this happening
learn to line up
jesus christ lol this has to be our worst game for penalties in a long time
i cant stand this interior offensive line
oline is absolutely pathetic except stanley
literally beating ourselves
mekari should consider playing for the chiefs wouldnt be a hold there

how many penalties is that has to be over a dozen on o right
jesus christ
this oline cant even line up properly
but we cant get holding or a facemask lol
the announcer is right sloppy af offense
whole team needs to run 10 laps around the stadium after the game
we should have our guys especially the linemen run gassers because of all the penalties
dawg these fucking offensive penalties are insane

anyone yelling at lamar should redirect it at the oline
this offense is sloppy as fuck they need a huge wake up call
the middle of this game was rough for a minute but still an improvement over last week in my eyes
this has to be a coaching issue
our oline needs so much help
gonna be a pretty aggressive film study this week from harbs this week
this may be the most offensive penalties i have seen one team have in a game wtf is happening
i rewound to look at both of those lined up in the backfield and i just dont see it
all right im switching to texanstitans for a moment lol
holy war ward
wow driscoll was like a third string tackle wasnt he
eagles players just keep dropping today
eagles chargers nfc east variant
lmao someone was unhappy about a push off
i think coaching is trying to develop the o line and passing game with these bad teams but the penalties are unnecessary give lamar the proper line and hes gonna shine but he cant shine if he keeps getting set back
dpoy
holy fuck what a sack was that
youre going to let wentz do that
nice run hes a warrior
damn they made wentz look like derrick henry
what the fuck was that by queen
marlon yelling push off on that 3rd and 8 but will not be heard gets the sack the very next play
carson lamar jacksons wentz
gotta be kidding me lol
fucking game is not over yet wtf
tennessee are no joke
wait the other team is allowed to get called for holding too
were they trying to tackle him or give him a high five
that should never happen
tackle him
patheticour d sucks no way we beat x team insert coordinator needs to be fired


s
new england is below 500 for the first time in october in over a decade
a penalty on the eagles
a holding against the other team they exist
titanstexans game is tied
shit jimmy just injured himself it looked like
fucking titans
come on houston
jimmy hurt again
this shit is just dragging
great coverage by peters
anyone seen judon this game
i love the joker
pick
joker szn
tha joker
he didnt catch it hit the ground
game over
its tha joka baby
joker
fuck
ahhh damn no pick
joker for real
ref sounded like he was cryin
joker
longest 4 minutes of my life
that was bad
jfc
marlo is so viscious when hes going for the ball
lmfao
lol judon is pissed that the one good play hes had all game wentz got the ball out
that was one angry tackle by marlo lol
the hell was that
how the actual fuck did that happen good lord
wow i hate it
fucking come on
anyone wanna tell me how thats okay
i would be annoyed at the defense but im more annoyed at the offense for not putting this away
judon literally hit him while he was trying to throw downfield and still couldnt finish the sack
come on man

why is this a game
pain
marlo looks like a fucking piranha when hes taking people down
fuck this
this is absurd this game shouldve been over so many times
this game sucks ass refs have made this a game
what a swing from a game ending pick
we really blowing this arent we
i swear if greg roman calls some bs here
peters gettin victimized i think he is hurt
has philly gotten a single flag on them
eagles are not pushovers with a rookie qb like the bengals are and were learning that rn
marcus peters is literally limping why was he out there
dudes are tired on defense this whole fucking abortion is because we choose not to run the ball
gotta give it to whoevers calling the eagles plays theyre figuring out what works
what the fuck
houston lost fuck
besides some trick plays are defense played great this game is on the offense particularly the oline since they kept putting the defense out there after so many 3 and outs
why is our hands team not there
block someone pls
i didnt think id be nervous going into the final 4 minutes of this game
are you fucking kidding me with these flags man
oh look another penalty
and holding of course
this shit is inexcusable
how did cincy lose
lololololol wut are we doing
eagles jersey grabbing every single fucking play when theyre on offence and these morons close their eyes but when we have the ball theyve got supersight
sorry but lamar and the line has fucked us in this one
youre welcome eagles fans
i hate this
screw the refs bruh nfls a complete joke
holding calls kill drives
fuck guys im a little nervous trust the d though
i am actually angry right now
does anyone think we will get a timely stop here
i turned it off a few mins ago to watch tnhou wtf happened
we have no momentum rn
can we please not blow this game for fucks sake
zeus has been getting pushed back all game so he cant actually roll out to the right
now we gotta be worried when we are down 10 and up 17
ill give it to him there nobody was open at all
lol jesus christ
really great defense but we should have run it to get them to take their final to or atleast a pa
dude stay in bounds to burn a time out wtf
even if we win this is a pretty uninspiring performance
good thing were not playing a good team
3 forced fumbles and no recoveries how bad luck id that
what the fuck
are people intentionally ignoring the fact that our offense has looked terrible all season and was ranked 25th before this game schemes gotta change
what
we are so boned against the squeelers
peters is a fucking idiot hes had multiple bad games in a row now and may have just lost this one on us
bruh
that call is a joke
gotta be shitting me
fuck this
no fucking way man
terrible shouldve just ran the ball

all routes ran to same depth no checkdown option to keep clock ticking
refs are stinking garbage
thats bs penalty
the worst they can do right now is tie and they need a 2point conversion to do it we are capable of stopping them
sooooo its on the defense
im tired of refs fucking over my sports teams
wow
fulgham initiated
these refs are the worst
what the fuck
if anything theyre either going to tie it up too fast or not tie it up
i hate that the only other game on is wtf and giants i dont want to watch that crap either
challenge the flag
epic diarrhea
cant wait for the next flag
fucking bitches
pathetic
yeah
hold em guys lets go
give them the td here so theres time to get the game winning fg
feels bad man
sorry ass penalties all day offense taking a giant shit no one but the ravens to blame
dont let judon on the bus home
so pathetic i dont know whether to cry or laugh
humiliating
i think our offensive play calling got too cute
bitch
judon heard us
oh look judon finally showed up
judon chalupa
62 with clearest hold ever no flag
im shocked the refs didnt call a penalty
putrid performance all around
who else judon lol
fucking finally
bent but didnt fucking break
nice hold there on 62
finally a stop when we need it
lets gooooooo offense put this away
aight here we go

1 recover the onside kick

2 get one first down
judonhero
sit down
fuck you wentz
everyone needs an ass whooping on the bus home everyone
wow for all his bad plays this year judon mightve just won us the game he read that absolutely perfectly
ravens will pass now
now gotta hope we get the onside kick
omg judon did something good
offense still needs to kill clock here
my heart rate is spiking
the eagles scratched and fucking clawed man my mouth is agape one of the craziest fucking games i have seen in a while
god damn our offense sucks ass this year lol
proche
proche is a godsend
this was the worst ravens game i have seen in a while
come on wentz get up and fucking jaw some more
yo i honestly thought for a second the eagles picked that up my heart sank but thank god we got it
good job proche
ugly ugly ugly ugly
awesome by proche
im still annoyed that we let the eagles make this a game
games not over until lamar kneels lol
thats game
can we seriously do anything other than shotgun dive up the middle jesus
ballgamr
proche has great hands

ok the way lamar crawled scared the shit out of me lmao
lamar ices it omg if he scored a td there
let lamar do lamar things
good playcall there
i need to go find a way to get my heart out of stomach now gg boys
what is the record for longest game that didnt go to overtime 3 and half hours and counting
hopefully a close call wakes everyone up
a big relief but this game was waaaay closer than i would have liked it to be
i feel like they were both making contact
the penalties situation was terrible but they also did put themselves in some situations to be called even if they were bad calls refs should be disciplined though esp for that peters dpi

that being said this game was a disaster in general after the first half and were lucky to come out of it rest and regroup and learn this will be a good week for this team to figure out who and what they are before steelers week which might be the most important game of the year for both squads
lamar looks so much worse as a passer than last year i dont like it at all
defenses have figured out lamar jackson
sign antonio brown
lamar looks sooo uninspired does he even like to play this year
we could legit lose this game with how bad the offense looks
you just knew the refs werent going to let philadelphia come away without points
cant blame that one on roman lamardo better
literally every play can be roughing the passer refs definitely pick when to call em imo
wait 14 days and we will play the steelers and everyone can stfu about whether the ravens are a good football team
dude no fuck this ref crew they are calling this game so fucking one sided eagles are holding constantly fuck this
ive kinda come around on how gloom and doom you guys are because last year i thought you were too cocky and we saw how that turned out so
lamar is pissing me off so much right now i love him but god does he look bad right now
fire roman
ingram stuffed what else is new
touchdown nick boyle
17 ydrush and dobbins is getting touches gro is about to abandon the run and i dont blame him
lets see the people mad that were gonna throw on 3 and 13
no designed runs again for lamar today
are we sure flacco is on the jets
facemask
these guys are handling balls about as bad as the first girl to give me a blowie in 10th grade
chris board wtf you da man
this is just sad they have nothing
lamar come on bruh i know this aint you somethings up
you guys need to chill about hat throw were up 170 and youre bithcing about one play how about all the good passes were dropped
2nd and 30 better throw a 5 yard hitch
we bout to have a brownsesque down and distance
browns will never compete in the afc north
is our oline to blame for the offensive regression
peters u really gonna get driven back 20 yards by the other teams qb
good effort but not a catch
fuck that is a catch
its closer than you all think that right foot tapped right as he fell outside
did you guys who are saying thats bullshit even watch the replays
big stop for the d still have time for our own drive
i agree with not going for points here offense has looked bad a turnover would be horrible
dont understand our sudden lack of aggression
werent we leading 170 last week also offense hasnt looked any better tbh
i dont understand the complete abandonment of the read option
why didnt you throw it away
fuck this horseshit thats pathetic
fumbling into the endzone
elliot 2 ff he great
this sub when were still up by 11 and the other team scores anything scrap the season
passing game needs to be revitalized and greg roman isnt exactly known for that
its funny how all the lamar hate just completely disappeared
stupid fucking play man
this sucks but thats ok couldve easily been a much closer game at this point remember we did get lucky those couple times
selfish penalty just gave them 8 points im not really worried about losing this game like i wasnt worried about losing to washington last week but these kind of mistakes are going to make it impossible to win in the playoffs
how did lamar possibly miss an open hollywood on that 3rd and 4 doesnt make sense to me
pathetic third down call

its 3rd and 4 call a slant call an option run with lamar call a run if youd like to use more time and maybe get closer than a 55yard fg

im not trying to be overly negative but holy crap
what the fuck happened to this oline were they just scared of pissing off yanda or something
alright im getting pissed now
eagles oline is a hospital
good tackle queen
imagine letting the browns score 7 pittsburghs d is trash lol
fuck these god damn refs
bruh we had 2 defenders there
we never make it easy
yah it is hard to fathom that philly is still in this game
eagles have dominated us this half nearly 250 yards
sure would be nice to have the fg lamar took the sack to knock us out of range for
these flags are completely bullshit
no receivers got open
fire roman
this team wont do shit with this offense
lol
im here so i can have others to wallow with
just one play a peters pick a marlon punchout please just get a defensive play and end this
just stop the 2pt and we good

i feel bad about this game but we should still win this
yeah at this point in the season we are not a playoff team we really are not playing to our potential
if judon reads this sub i know he made that play and checked reddit to see what wed say
hope this game also showed the we dont run the ball enough crowd that that is not the issue with our offense
lamars play today has pissed me off so much
this team looks so poorly coached lately super talented but poorly coached poorly schemed so many mental lapses and dumb penalties
eagles fans were saying that this team is trash lol okay worry about your depleted team
i hope they get this 2pt and we lose this game 100 deserve to lose it
our offense hasnt been good since week 2 3 straight weeks of horrible offense against bad teams if we cant put crazy numbers against was cin or phil how are we suppose to beat pitt in 2 weeks this team is not as good as our record indicates
nobody should be bragging about this 51 record this offense has been pitiful and we are making way too many fucking mistakes we lose by 3 scores if we played a real team like this
offense hasnt looked the same since kc its like they have ptsd
wtf are these short passes and runs on 35 yards
thats a catch dude
dogshit offense
dont let ward back in the game cost us points with that dumb hit

when a rookie pulls up and plays smart the veteran should know to do the same
this win shouldnt make any of u happy what a collapse
our offense sucks part 43697436
it was nice having an elite offense while it lasted
another blown coverage by the defense
were fucking terrible
sign antionio brown
blue moon is my favorite beer
offense just looks horrendous i imagine they are trying new things they dont normally do to make sure they are playoff ready but it just looks awful dobbins needs to get more touches ingram just looks like hes lost it also we are they not taking literally any shots down field need to stretch the defense because the running game is also stagnant and lifeless
wink heard yall bitching about not getting to the qb
holy shit peters horrible read
that was an ugly ball haha
lets not do a run pass pass sequence
if this was our team from last year we would have already rgiiid them by now
sus play calling from roman these past couple games
that better be a fucking fumble
good to see a designed run for lamar though those have been absent
dobbins is having a really bad game
should we call him campbells chunky or just chunky or is that stupid
yoooo what was calais going off on judon for was it just hype talk or was he pissed
sit wentz bring out big dick nick i know hes not on the team anymore
something is up with lamars arm
im so glad greg roman calls the plays and not reddit
this offense is systemically fucked man
wtf did greg roman expect that play to get 4 yards
fake punt
youd think wed be able to defend a zone read
yowhy isnt hurts their starter at this point
called the hurts debut
whatever
damn bros thats a catch
bad idea to call timeout imo now philly go go for it and then if they get it they have a full minute to get a td
hurts would have picked that up
greg is insane wtf was that didnt even try xd
gro has called a good game he has called some nice quick hitters lamar has just missed most of them

the deep crosser gimme to snead he hit was nice
mcphee wtf
why is andrews not playing
and now roughing the passer this is the stupid fucking shit that has to stop
cowher in a turtleneck and tweed looks like a jeff goldblum that really let himself go after getting lasik
isnt hollywood supposed to be one of the fastest receiver havent seen him once get behind a back and take it to the house
ffs offensive is a dumpster fire
jesus our offense looks like ass this game
zrebiecs twitter feed is a little crybabiesh for my liking he highlights every negative and glosses over positives
offense sucks
why the fuck did we abandon the offense that helped us win 12 straight last year in favor of this lackluster one ill never understand
lmao fucking pathetic
throwing form gets worse every game
big dick energy lets go
see that makes zero sense were up by 18 with about 17 minutes left in the game why would you throw on first down
ahh yes right to the wide receiver

i know it was miscommunication its a joke
how is that not rtp after the earlier call lmao
bullshit call
touchdown ward
im so disgusted with the mental lapses today
philly was able to make it a game against us and pittsburgh yet cleveland cant handle it
passes out to mark andrews always a reliable target

doubt
this has been gus worst game ever
need a turnover here
damn poor ertz i like that guy
fire this whole o line
fuck this oline
what was that tackle queen
fucking christ this game has gone on forever
lol its a clown show out here
the red zone updates for the ravens are basically

the eagles aint gonna win bruh
our offense is so bad they knew theyd kick it deep
i have a bad feeling they look scared on the sidelines
harbaugh is going to absolutely rip this team wow
welp we suck
fuck you greg roman
wheres the open guy

yeah that happens when you have no wr1 on the roster
fire everyone
cowardly d on this drive
we are playing like a falcon
good win offense needs to work defense just has to keep doing what theyre doing these refs need to be blacklisted from doing baltimorephiladelphia games
almost 300 yards for daddy lamar
end of the season we will only see the w
lots to work on but hopefully this gives us a kick up the ass and motivates us even more for pitt
bench ingram
thats a catch
refs and review dont understand how out of bounds works
bad coaching shouldve kicked it
not sure what is worse lamars throwing or all these penalties
greg roman mustve been drinking last night with these play calls that and these dumb penalties
fire greg roman please god
hollywoods injury fucked him up a little mentally he instantly goes to the ground every time lol

if they comeback roman deserves all the blame
these refs are stinking garbage miss every holding call vs other teams but every penalty is called vs the ravens homecooking
did you all not see this coming
wheres all the morons who said its only 6 points
makes you wonder if last year was a fluke for lamar in the passing game he looks pretty bad overall this year reminds me of his first few games a starter i wonder if the coaches let him do his thing a little too much might need to focus on fundamentals a bit more
snead needs to stay off the field
roman needs to be fired after this game win or lose
lol at some of the incredibly hot takes in here
very poor awareness from lamar there he is simply not playing to the same level as he was last year i type this as a huge fan wearing his jersey rn he needs to be coached up
slow stroking my meat for lamar
what a fucking garbage play 3rd and 30 you know youre probably going to have to kick it take a fucking shot deep what do you have to lose

im not gonna jump the gun but it might be time to start considering removing greg roman
its lamars third year and hes still struggling with basic fundamentals
did baker just get benched thats fucking hilarious
homecooking refs again trying to get them free points
we are going to lose we are going to lose judon is hands down the worst defender we have
shut the fuck up all you whiny bitch plastic fans jesus christ sometimes the offense doesnt look good and thats fine still plenty of games to iron it out id hate to see how yall would act when we had boller starting at qb
we got this
i had to come to the uk man having games start at 6 pm fucking sucks
hope we see the return of the lamar show jackson 5 incoming
i gotta spend the day doing yard cleanup i live out of market best way to listen to the game from my phone
i feel like jo absolutely dominates the local commercials lol
lets gooo
whooooo
jordan richards going out to call the coin flip
perfect start
that is a good way to start the game
thats a hell of a way to start d
getting started in a hurry
yea cc
think well see hurts debut today
campbell
we eating today
how are we 4th in sacks lol
thank god he dropped that
man we got lucky
lol completely fucked in the back end
hell yeah good opening two plays so far
we got away with that that should have been 6
lol you can always count on receivers to drop a pass
whew
peters got beat bad
and we start at their 47 or so nice
lol
glorious field positioning
jesus peters you nearly got us killed there
yeah lets not let that happen again
holy shit mp
that was more luck than skill
good field position lets gooooooo
lets go
good pass and catch
very nice 3rd down conversion
good throw
does anyone else not understand why phillips is starting hes been terrible and fluker and mekari have held up better
good job boykin
boykin caught something yooo
weird throw didnt look great
bro that is a small play just a regular out but it was good timing but that ball was ugly
boykin got separation whaaaaa
just tuned in did i miss anything
lets face it lamar will never be able to scramble outside again without 5 defenders staring him down
theyve figured us out
one day these bootlegs are gonna get lamar popped roman needs to stop it
sweeeeet
duv reminds me so much of ssr he plays so much bigger than he is
defense is better than offense the ravens way
lel
llama
that was nice
let mark eat jus block for that grown ass man
that was filthy
my stream lagged and i thought tucker missed lol
hell yeah boyle
it seemed like we did a bootleg to the right but had most of the receivers go to the left side of the field not giving lamar a lot of options
yall really freaked out too much about lamar he is a stud
poor wentz
lj fort revenge game
good play fort
haddyy
we gotta execute dammit
lets go d
ouch
x200b

ouch that is going to leave a mark
big hit on that return
oof
not to take anything from anthony but look at the eagles receiver core and offensive line both are shit shows
good to see him walking away hope he is ok
im only okay with the commercials if it involves the big tidday thicc butt progressive chick
lamar was kinda shocked at that hike
mark is hurt damn
lol they called a normal run play and we got 2 yards ill take that any day
feel bad for wentz missing peters johnson starting g and top 2 receviers
omfgg what kinda play
that was an awesome 1arm tackle lol
did bruh just make a kent tekulve reference hes already so much better than dan fouts lol
flag
man new ravens fans are so bipolar
what in the shit was that play
knee down
what is this play calling man
lol wut
theres too much emphasis on ball control instead of taking shots down the field
thats a clear as day fumble
wtf was that
love this defense that play will stand
should be our ball
thats a fumble
his knee wasnt down
that should stand ball is moving
that might be coming back
yall clearly dont remember the kyle boller years yes our offense is stagnant but damn were 41 right now enjoy it
defense carry again
knee was on his foot a little too i think this is one that stands as called
close call man
thats a clear fumble
lets goooo
i said it last week and ill say it again we need more plays from under center
this means nothing if our offense cant captitalize
oh man i am glad im not the ref that has to review that i genuinely cant tell you if thats a fumble or not
crazy fumble
his knee was on deshons foot
should stand
lets put a smile on that face
offense looks like garbage but the defense has been amazing
feedtheboyle
if we get the ball lets take a deep shot straight out
keep pounding
i was doubting this defense after kansas city but im glad theyve proved me wrong
bus
boom
gus bus
gus the goat
gus bus
da gus bus
the gus bus does not disappoint
gus bus
gus
gus bus
we will need the o to step up big
good hustle by judon there
ingrams leg is it the same one he injured last yr
what a shame that it takes ingram getting injured for the ravens to utilize the younger fresher better rb rotationcombination
this d is waking up loving this the past few weeks
this doesnt seem fair
holding must not be getting called this year
wentz will learn to go down faster against us he does that too many times he gonna cough it up again
wentz sacked by everyone
jesus even when the dragon had his wings clipped i didnt see a offense as bad as the eagles rn
this defense is slinging the d
flacco at his worst was 1000x better than phillys offense
have they even had a single first down today
throw in the towel
ian sacks can technically half 3 halfs 3 people can get a half sack on a sack its weird i know
it was a funny bud light commercial but i wouldnt want to see it again
lmao it looked like wentz got sacked by his own teammate
the fuck is wentz doing lmaoooooooo
wow wentz must love taking hits
jesus hold on to the ball snead
saw that fumble coming from a mile away
youre surrounded cover the ball lol
dont scare me like that
snead unaware of the dude behind him on the play
knead for snead
come on snead cant have that one step forward two steps back shit
yall wanted other receivers to be involved right
omg snead just gave me a heart attack
whew
whew dodge a big one
ill take the gain though lol
i agree its too early to say for sure but a lot of us were right the offense is starting to gel this game
what if we pull a reverse and light it up against pitt
wtf howd they read that so well xd
hi im umdg009 and i criticized the lack of diversity in the offense last week
book it dano
wouldnt have mattered anyway
espn has us at a 954 chance of victory right now
for a second there i thought tucker would have missed that as the greatest kicker of all time
who has koch passed stover
carne asada
defence has been dominating damn
judon and campbell jelling well today
the eagles now have 7 yards of total offense
calais campbell deserves a super bowl championship added to his hof rsum
when was the last time we had a bad defense
monstars balling out
taps mic and clears throat baker mayfield is extremely streaky and will never be able to string together a full season
defense is doin the damn thing
i think this game says a lot about pittsburghs best defense in the league
lamar you killin me
isnt their whole line out today not sure if they are any good to begin with just asking for some perspective because the bengals line was absolutely shit
any thoughts on madabuike and broderick washington so far this game
in my opinions the only thing the ravens are missing is an elite runningback
kaboom your problems
i dont understand the gun running scheme now its gross line up in the pistol and run the ball
thats my llama
was that a statue of liberty play
that same run play ingram got like 4 yards and tripped
its not a ravens game if an offensive player doesnt do a fullon flip after a play
i love that playfake
wait youre allowed to call holding
finally dobbins had space
there you go dobby
2 runs 2 first downs interesting concept
jk all day
hoping lamars qb coach goes back and watches film with him seems like maybe his machanics are slipping
run the ball every 1st down pls
bro fuck holding
boyle elite blocker
but lamar slings that one right in there lmao what is happening
those fake quick throws to draw are working really well i think well throw it once and get them off guard for big gain
these fucking penalties
sigh refs see everything the ravens do
not a ravens game without some kind of penalty
look i dont think tyre is awful but i dont understand why hes starting as a rookie
that play reminded me of a certain someone
about to be 1st 35
fucking sloppy
how do we not line up right
another flag
no discipline
fuck john harbaugh
get it together
rigged
dude what the fuck is with the flags
fucking embarrassing
take the fucking stick out of your asses ref
i hate that yellow fucking flag
this has got to be a record
yo wtf lol
why
is this legal
wtf all these flags
just punt on first
the offense is so concerning right now
good drive and we just shit the bed
these fucking flags though
epic
the eagles too
hail mary
i will literally take a gain of 0 for the next 3 drives if it means no more penalties wtf
okay team lets convert this 1st and 35
god damn these penalties
yesss more penalties i love it
1st and 35 wtf
just fucking hail mary it
screen to jk lets go
good punting position at least
throw the ball over your shoulder
miles boykin on the sideline throw it up deep
we should be up by like 28
that incompletion to andrews was tipped also it was the first incompletion gerry has forced all yr
can anyone share where i can steam the game please and thank you
any possible oline trade targets we need all the help we can get
im late to the party i see were up 170 anyone have some highlights of the day to catch me up
i love same koch but im seeing way to much of him 2 and 30 we still dont go deep 3 and 25 we still dont go deep either lamar is scared to throw it deep he doesnt have enough time to let plays develop for that long or greg just isnt scheming deep passes either way that shit needs to change man we cant be the only team in the league not completing long passes
lamar may have had a suggestion to sidearm the throws to avoid getting knocked down even that last sidearm was knocked down
we run too much we need to throw for big yards s
mitch trubisky rookie season never forget
they really trying anything now with hurts to get the ball moving smh
go figure we get fucked when a dt qb comes in lol
isnt that what we used to do
god this is fucking annoying
what the fuck was that
here come the miracle plays wtf man xd
lol
so thats what it feels like
dude was flying out of bounds
thats an absurdly good catch
i have faith in the refs to screw this up
lame but i guess its right
he didnt have control when his first foot came down
right foot looks in to me go get that int or punch out d
great
keep the shutout
now get a pick
eagles have had the ball for too long now
im liking a pick here
eh if we made that catch id def say it was in bounds lol
i gotta say that was a great catch
i stand corrected holy shit
holy shit another drop in our favor
i know defense is on the field but allow me to adjust my fedora and go in on how sidearm throws are disrespectful to the flag s
we got lucky yet again
shoulder makes it but that angle doesnt show the ball
we score here
take a shot
lol
no way that theres enough evidence to overturn that
its not where his head is its where the fucking ball is you dumbass announcers
2 fumbles for wentz
call stands
thats a fumble anyway
queen with the slight push back lol
dobbins is explosive af
battery time boys
never thought id see the matt cavanagh offense again
shutout is on track
wentz looking hurt
dammit mcphee
why not practice 2 minute drill team had a minute
we did try to score we knew our defense has the best chance of scoring lol
this is like the third backflip this game wtf
lol good effort mcphee
god damnit mcphee hold onto it
mcphee has to catch that
cmon
ball dont lie
airhorn
chuck must be filthy back to back ints taken away
hahahahahahahahahahaha
what the fuck is that call
l o l
weak call imo
bullllllshit
horrible last drive almost giving up points
what a waste
put in hurts we wanna give him a taste
hearing phil simms reminds me of madden 25 lol
hollywood sighting
how did the eagles get a fg attempt at the end of the half
smh
this o line isnt jelling
but for real even though our offense looks off this is still a cool game lol if youre not enjoying this at all go take a walk and come back or something
i hope by mid year the o line can get more acclimated the penalties are killing us
how can we not line up
asleep at the wheel
flag flag flag flag flag flag flag
holy shit stop it
its so much harder to run the ball when were 20 yds from the 1st down everytime why can we not get cooking until 3rd and 10
can we cool it with the flags jesus
just doing that will open the pass game
ol penalty counter 8
madden mode when he turns it on
every single player on the oline has been penalized besides skura
lol false start now
come the fuck on dude
can greg roman get our receivers open
eat your heart out
fucking fuck me

wtf are these penalties
these penalties need to be fixed badly way too many undisciplined mistakes by the oline today
finally hollywood got a catch
nice throw
great play call
there we go
listening on the radio i guess he tripped
devin duvernay playmaker in the making
okay now were clicking on offense
kill me
dis is hilariously bad
oline wtf xd
jesus fuck can you guys not false start
the offensive penalties are killing us we already had a 1st and 35 for crying out loud
just wacky rn
well damn
lol
ooooof
are they still doing cmon man if not put that play of shaqtin a fool throw it away lj
i think we can get it together over the bye week
idk what they need to do but they need to feed brown and dobbins on short passesscreensslants get your big play guys the ball and have them make plays its clear the ol misses yanda and cant give the same type of production they did last year lamar needs to get the ball out quick or just have them run on jumbo packages i feel like they are trying to do much and its getting too complicated for everyone
thats about right
uhhhhhhh wut
lol
what the fuck man
nice one
well shit

wow
lol wow

fuck that
the fuck
if hurts is in they are gonna run cmon
hurts is winks demon rn
time for mvp lamar to show up now

edit he did
where tf was this when marty was here it was all qb power with a little passing
its actually not a block that was a straight up tackle lol
time for 8 more o line penalties
not sure what was worse the design of that play or lamars throw
queen gave up on that play if he kept running he was gonna get the ball at the end zone
deshon elliott more than made up for his bad angle at the start of the play when his hustle to still run down the field and force a fumble its just too bad that his efforts ended up giving the eagles the points anyways
throw slants
nice throw to brown
this play calling is atrocious on offense i just dont like it
i fucking hate screen passes like that run the ball
best throw all game
why do we keep playing bubble screens
lamar
im quite sure that these past few games have looked bad on offense because roman is focusing on the weak spots of our passing game against weak teams to improve them thats probably why were abandoning the run game if we went run heavy against the bengals and eagles there would be much higher margins of victory
wentz has gotten absolutely clobbered today
i can feel it in my veiny neck john harbaugh
i swear wentz is blind he reacted like a full second too late to campbell
if he dies he dies
calius just out here having fun
humphrey maaaaaan so cloooooooose
lol dominated
marlon fruit punch
fruit punch marlo biaaaaaaattcccchhhh
we need to see the stats for most punch outs in 1 season
duvernay and proche in pls see what we got in them mostly duv though
marlo or pat tillman whos got the better punch bois
fruit punch baby
lol lamar almost escaped there
boykin ran the wrong route
you have to look at the ball to catch it
who is at fault on those lamar or boykin and as fans how the hell do we figure that out or cant we
wow nearly blocked the punt too
offense isnt clicking how i want it to but defense still dirty
well with some of the blown coverages in d they didnt capitalize on but then forcing two fumbles that we got nothing out of i think defense has been pretty even on the board vs their performance now

dont know why they havent been using more rpo with hurts it was so effective
smh
why was peters on ertz
just realized not matter what

bird gang will not have a perfect record today

this is so sad
hey wink blitzing has been effective but doing it every 3rd is not xd
oh come on why is peters playing that far off on third down
my uncle told me this should be a blowout i said it should be closer than it is the defense had a few dropped picks but also blown coverage we got lucky on whos right

thoughts
fuuuck i know that hurt
jesus christ
not pi and this commentator is a puss
yeah thats dumb and unnecessary
manoh well
that safety blitz was awesome
bleh
that was just stupid
goddamnit
wow that was a blown coverage and a half
low snaps by skura
offsides
some good work by boyle today
best throw from lamar all day to boyle right there
i love when lamar has to do a 360 to hand off the ball what kind of call is that g ro
gus didnt even have a chance there
tucker territory
can we do any runs that arent shotgun dives
best ever
have not had a lot of success on the ground today other than lamar obv def needs to be adressed
old man jimmy
ballgame
great stand defense oh look the offense has another chance to do their jobs and put this thing away
ertz stay hurt so glad we got andrews
that was a huge risk to take there we have guaranteed 3 here
thats game imo
cmon denver
should be game right there
lot of opi going on out there
the eagles caught the injury bug a few years ago and its never left must be disappointing for their fans
why dont they just put in hurts games basically over doesnt hurt them
fuck yes
excellent coverage
lmao wtf would you throw that at ricard for
lets eat some clock and beat them up
come on
the hell
come on
these formation penalties are on the coaching staff fucking hell
you really gonna put us out of fg range
bruh
holy shit these penalties
this is ridiculous
lol browns and lol bengals
you cant be serious
fucking oline we need to replace every single one except skura
so many penalties
so many penalties
ref ball
what the fuck is with these refs we are the only team to get that call
another penalty on our offense come on man
ok who tf is paying bonuses for oline penalties
can we stop giving away penalties you stupid fucks
this goddamn pathetic lol
these penalties bro wtf
penalty yards are still yards right guys right
thank you tucker
jesus christ tucker is good
au
to
ma
tu
ck
pats lost
offensive line is killing them
thats what happens when you put a practice squad bum against a top 5 defensive lineman in the game
i promise you give us saints oline we would be much better its not the playcalling its not that we arent running enough our oline has been pisspoor
definitely a hold penalties are a bit worrying right now
thats money
so many flags jesus
ward gets redemption sorta
thats not a fucking catch
georgia southern destroyed umass yesterday
but the ravens dont get any pressure on the pass rush
player of the game campbell or hump
our offense takes one step forward and the two steps backwards

another fucking ugly win what is this team
this game seems endless six minutes left
what was that you think game is over
dpoy
lol again
sacks on sacks on sacks on sacks
pq what was that man
are they scared to tackle him
lol d lol
looks like the eagles ots have also been lining up deep off the line
peters cant tackle it shed a block wonder if thats why screens works so well
great jimmy hurt himself
did a raven get hurt
something must be wrong
dayum he gave queen a stiffy
ouch he landed right on top of peters
what are we doing
humph coulda killed that guy but didnt want the flag
i think and hope mp just got elbowed in his area
why play so far off the recievers
thank you
easily elliots best game so far
good pick
it has been the day of tos in the league
thank you joker
remember when our defense got zero pressure lol
int and 2 ffs for elliot

he dropped it
bowser handing elliot that pick what a good stunt by the defense

yeah thats coming back
why so serious wentz
looks like it was on the ground
elliot has been impressive lately

edit spoke too soon but hes been good regardless of the drop
no thats not a pick
oh he dropped it lol
thats coming back lol
damn couldnt secure it
damnit
fuck it hit the ground
wentz got a face full of bowser
dude finally get wentz the fuck off the field this game shouldve been over a long time ago

edit of course its not a pick weve now bailed wentz out of 3 interceptions
ah fuck
incomplete
not an int
noooooooooo
the d is suffocating man

live it so much
damn
i hope we keep tyus
bruh wentz looks like a tomto
so close
marlon getting annoyed lol
man how did he do that lol
the texans are choking
ah well this looks like this is gonna end with one of those final scores that hides just how lopsided this game actually was
fuck
just brutal
texans about to lose damn
brutal
cannot wait to play the steelers man
just wow
just lose
lmao
another two point conversion come on guys
eagles could still win this
wide open again
well now its close
team needs to wake the f up on offense and defense
mp juice man has not been juicing this year
if they get put in hurts were screwed guys
can we please just fucking end this this game has gone on for years and years
dont let them back in this game please
run the dang ball
offense needs to score
nice work peters literally right there and pulls a rahim moore
bengals lost lol thats kinda bleak
need this offense to show why we are elite everyone says we cant win big games while thats yet to be decided lets win a big moment here
a field goal puts this one away
can we be aggressive here please
lamar needs to butt excavate them now
wentz got us out here looking sus
alright offense no holds no fumbles run that rock
uh i would rather this not be a one score game right now
lets go lamar end this game
love marcus peters just wish he was a little more consistent
shite
id fucking trust my d against this offense as well
tennessee just won
offense please do something
we need to line up under center once in a while
aaauuuggggghhhhh
ridiculous
sigh
oh boy another fucking holding
do we need to lose this game to realize how undisciplined our team has been playing
wtf another penalty why
pucker your buttholes friends
bruh what is this offense
we deserve to lose this game
fml
unreal absolutely awful
been better off with a sack there tbh

oh no
it is what it is looking forward to this team getting some adversity
fucking pathetic
baltimore and silly penalties a love story
were gonna fucking lose
jfc
jesus christ is this game actually happening this is insane
okay now we have a reason to be upset
wtf were those routes in third down
we suck offensively
so many forced fumbles this game so few actual tos
fucking pathetic
can someone get fucking open
our wrs on lock bri
that entire drive was 19 seconds
needed a good drive to get points or kill time and we get a 3 play drive that lasts 27 seconds and the eagles still have a timeout
come on defense lets stop them
imagine if ward didnt commit that rtp
fuckin wow
please make this stop defense
welp
lol
pathetic
lamar liked it here he wanted to play here he loved the coaches if this team isnt careful those 2 sentences will be true
excuse me
should be opi
barring a turnover this game is gonna be tied
i thought this was our year but kinda feeling it may not be anymore cmon guys
way too much time left for philly to come back and send this game to overtime

hell if wentz is fast enough and we have another shitty drive they have enough time to win
how the fuck is this eagles team alive worst offensive line performance in years thats how fucking disgusting literal f grade
oline tackling ravens defenders eh let it go
omg come on peters please
fuck the refs

what the fuck
how do you miss a tackle on a guy standing still catching a punt
wtf is going on
the offense looks worse every week im concerned
they were both fighting for position on that ball
not like this
yeah fuck this
every player who committed a penalty needs to run wind sprints
were gonna blow this holy shit
i want to kill myself wtf
how many penalties holy shit
all time weak shit
the eagles are doing it without miles sanders no big deal the refs are on their side
can we get a quality wr

this is about to be a total meltdown
wtf
welp i hate life
take mt wbergy
ot
damn
oh boy
my heart man
so many penalties dammit
penalties and the inability to move the ball has been our downfall rn
its been a long time since my heart has beat like this
hold
sigh
lads
pls no 2 pointer
pick play coming
what a load of fucking shit
people pinning this shit on the defense like our offense didnt just go 3 and out and gave them 30 seconds of rest
bruh
at least they got it but they literally made me nauseous af for no reason
thank god
i didnt know teams could okay from behind
lets go d stand at the critical moment
judon did something
i cant believe im saying this but thank you judon
at least we stopped the conversion
offense do not mess this up
how much you wanna bet they get another chance via penalty
horrible play call
this is where the mental comes in lets go boys
first time all day judon actually did anything

not thrilled it took 58 minutes but ill take it
now we need to run damn clock please
get on the ground
big
its not over yet they got a timeout
wow shocked that we stopped them
embarrassing
and they jumped offsides
ok burn the clock dont allow shit
bodybuilt by taco bell
come on offense
holy fuck man
bro wentzs landed on his hands crazy he aint break em
refs gonna catch the onside for philly
judon 945 m apy
time for an onside i guess
thanks to dougie p for the play call that bailed us out
fuck off bitch
its only a penalty when we do it
games not over
fuck you philly and fuck you refs
please just close this disaster out
can the offense please hold the ball now tho literally just for 155
no false start on the lt
ugly win but a dub is a dub
i cant believe the game was so close
bro i called it our 2016 game against philly ended in a failed 2pt conversion and we won by 1 barring this onside itll be the same shit again idk why i just knew
they c oco old get it with 5 seconds lol
no fucking passing
and we recover the onside kick we might just avoid a super embarrassing loss
lamar needed to go down there
ball game bitches
why do you do this to us eagles
fuck please slide lamar
honestly cant believe were 51 weve looked mediocre against awful teams
gotta get better
hopefully we learn from this
12 penalties for 130ish yards weird game terrible oline and we still won not clean but even great teams have sloppy games the difference between great teams and above average teams is the great ones pull the w still
put the camera on acuna
anyone still here

roman needs to befired
derrick henry has more rushing yards than lamar does passing
we are sure as fuck not super bowl contenders
so when they bout to fire greg roman
there is no game thread more insufferable than ours when the team we support is up by freaking 11 points
2 bad lamar passes that drive
again sign antonio brown
thats so fucking lucky
i think it was good fb iq that he kept it nothing was open and the defense was all over the receivers we need a top end wr bad so they can get separation
baker officially pulled for the day
not what we needed
lamar is actually accurate when throwing to a wall
dude wtf is up with our offense
free gus and dobbins

classic ravens go up 170 then sputter hard
yeah thats complete
bullshit
i just i dont think were playing as aggressive as we can be were not utilizing our weapons correctly and and at the end of the day i think roman is at fault here this is the same shit he did in san fran this is why san fran immediately dropped to the bottom of their division after their superbowl appearance because he changed the game style to less aggressive the only reason we are still competitive is our defense and unless we fix this shit soon we will not beat the harder teams

steelers arent a fucking joke this year and if our offense continue this short choppy bullshit we will not beat them if we cant even move against the fucking eagles what the fuck are we gonna do against a competent defense
please lets see some halftime adjustments lamar needs to get his head in the game
those people are open enough
ugh its not a terrible call with how the rule is written but thats such an annying rule
white tight end time
these refs are litterally playing for the eagles
garbage time td
why is it that every time a receiver is wide open its marcus peters blowing the coverage
something needs to change at the bye or harbaugh will be on the block
were soooooo fucked this season
this team is embarrassing right now
anybody think this team would beat the titans or chiefs
how is that not a touchback
2 ineffective runs and a successful pass play this sub is going to explode
lamar needs to fucking go thats twice now he had chose to not run and got a yard instead of 5 ffs what the hell are they telling him let him ball out
offense play calls are sus so far except for the boykin throw
this might be the shutout weve been waiting for
come on offense start clicking
those were catchable passes dropped
someone run the football lamar run that shit if you cant throw
before the season i thought for sure we were gonna go all the way on paper we should be much better than last year apart from the oline weve gone completely backwards on every part of our offense and are so fucking predictable if i on my couch know what play is about to come on 3rd and long then you know damn well the defense does i dont doubt we will make it to the playoffs but i would not at all be surprised to see this team go 1 and done again thank god the defense is playing so well because if not we would be fucked
andrews was open for the td there
id like to see more passes to rbs
boseman wake the fuck up or get off the field
we up 170 but its all mostly to the defense we not gonna get this lucky against the steelers
guys need to catch those but lamar also needs to hit them closer to the body on these bullet passes
can we get some 3 te sets and some rpos going maybe some pistol what we ran last year
how does the fake screen work if we never throw normal screens lol
fucking michael oherwait
1st and 35 and we run the ball xd
if we are playing this way against this terrible eagles defense next game against the steelers is gonna be ugly
lamar jackson 20 omg
holy shit
bs he didnt have full control when he got that first step
geez is that perriman
remember this isnt just about breaking the plane either you have to maintain forward progress i remember when they screwed us against brees the one time with that call
catch the ball mcphee omg
was he not in bounds there clock should have run out after that tackle
what a fucking chokejob
get roman the fuck outta here yesterday btw
what is this shit show
these penalties are embarrassing this is a real professional team out there holy shit id criticize their discipline but theres nothing to critique because their discipline doesnt exist
lol charles davis talking bout hollywood like he fell no he fell on purpose
belee guys
there need to be more playmakers on offense out there another top tier wr is needed
and we have a ball game boys
wtf defense i know youve been lights out all day but wtf
roman back at it again with the horrible playcalling
all that for a sack
roman wtf was that its like every drive they get either jekyll or hyde as oc xd
aw come on marlon
oh fuck off
andddddd another bail out
way to fucking go ferguson
here we go again
hey guys i saw baker was benched in the 3rd quarter how much were they winning by
24th in the league oof
we do the slowest handoffs ever
mostly im agnostic about these how can we play like this vs pittsburgh takes but i am concerned our run game will look very similar vs their d line
how far can lamar throw sidearm these seem to be hist best looking throws
zero holding calls on the eagles like 3 on us
these refs are fucking ridiculous
penalty on the eagles can that happen guys is that allowed
do not let them score for the love of god
i know you guys hate this team this year but i love a balanced offensedefense team defense isnt perfect but we can count on them
what an extremely unathletic play by peters pathetic coverage and jump
man our dbs have been exposed a few times today that shouldve been an easy play on the ball

why didnt they challenge wentz being down
we deserve to lose
this team man this fucking team i dont think i have been this angry in a while fuck
we really need to assess our wrs and see if we can make some kind of trade or signing lamar needs someone who can get open quickly
this crew is complete bullshit
this team is a fucking joke
deserve to lose playing like this on offense
how are we struggling against the eagles
thats awful
the they dont bring in offensive target and oline we are fucked
get fucked
we are not the falcons

thank god

now where the hell is my julio jones
people saying its not the refs how you gunna defend them on the no call on the left guard pulling 2 seconds before the snap on the 2 pt lmao
any given sunday my dudes ill still take the w
i think if our offense was slightly better we wouldve scored 40
this game should be a big wake up call to the coaching staff hope offense improves cuz this was ridiculous
i swear to god any one of you who posts a take it easy on our offense post im gonna cuss you the fuck out rgiii should be in against this dogshit team rn
nice job upgrading the receiver position in the offseason guys

bang up front office work
thats a catch
how the fuck is that a catch
is there anything we can do to get greg roman fired ill sign whatever ill wear whatever he needs to go the faster the better before the damage is permanent
were getting 1st rounded again
hate to say it but were frauds
uhoh they scored 6 lolsome of yall are fucking awful fans
can we just take wentzs head off one of these plays tired of seeing his awkward ass dance around light him up
uh oh were only up 176 with one loss on the year bring out all the fans talking about how trash this team is
this thread is embarrassingly toxic

if you want to call out bad plays do it in a constructive way lets educate each other and drive good conversation
god this team sucks were going to fall ass backwards into the playoffs and embarrass ourselves again
shitty o is back on the menu time to panic and not run another down the rest of the game
omg decosta needs to be on the phone with abs agent right now
love the humphrey punch but he cant try to do it every play cost us a td in pittsburgh last year good thing he made up for it in ot
if we dont get points on this drive im nervous
we deserve to lose
were still gonna win
i want to be active at the trade deadline but idk what we need maybe julio jones basically a wr who catches everything regardless of the pass being slightly off
madden curse is real
my mans lamar just needs a fresh cut he lookin like a human cockroach out there with that hair
lamars been figured out by the league
why are they hugging all these dudes with covid going on
steelers going to smoke us penalties side arm passes run blocking have a lot to fix on the off week hope we fix a lot of this
yall need to have some faith lol
when did we turn into a clown offense
i dont mind lamar trying to take a step back and not do as much against worse teams but when the going gets tough he needs to be ready to be the point guard and not be slow due to lack of playing that way
ab
great now the backup is in and we about to get picked apart
marcus peters got driven back back carson wentz didnt even try to make a tackle on that play
bullshit
next draft wrs and des every round please

thanks homecooking refs not a single one called on the eagles though
if we win itll feel so weird we dont look or feel like a 51 team at all to me
hopefully this is the last game for roman
jesus christ we have so much work to do we honestly deserved to lose this one
theyre really reaching with this bar commercial tf do you want any president to do about a disease this infectious niggas dont want to get sick so they stay home
its 170 stop bitching you toxic fucks
end me now
duvernay was open over the top there
honestly anyone who thought this is a good team needs a reality check this is a good thing for this team to go through gotta learn that walking all over the browns bengals and wft wont prove anything to anyone gotta get way better if they want to compete for anything this year
lamar stop showboating youve mostly looked like ass
until lamar becomes a better passer we need him to keep breaking off these runs
downvote me all you want but i think the steelers are gonna eat this teams lunch without some major changes
lamar needs to learn to elevate the ball

thank god we have the easiest schedule this year
lol that was embarrassing eagles almost cancels out the lucky td
it seems like lj just doesnt want to play today very little killer instinct
why do we run it to the right so fucking often it doesnt work ever we have way more success running to the left period

guess which side of the line cleared that hole for jacksons td the fucking left
this is fuckint bull shit just giving them shit wtf
we dont deserve a bye week with all these penalties absolutely unacceptable
just tuning in how did yall let this eagles team comeback
run the fucking ball jesus christ
lamar is straight up bad this year not just a down year for him or whatever you want to say his performance so far this season is straight up bad
every whiny bitch ass ravens fancomplaining about the refs again maybe its just this team
once again we have a great first drive and then get sloppy and lose all rhythm defense is carrying this team were setting ourselves up for a massive upset game
quick first drive of the game abandon the run
imagine if we had prime alex collins with these rbs
incoming screen pass
im a patient man but it taking 5 games to get this running game going
im not here to talk about the game im here to discuss the commercials thats what they mean by play every game like the superbowl right
lamar is 2018 lamar without the rushing
safety incoming
i love that progressive advert
only one foot down
i dont think its a catch but what a play by ward
why the hell would the eagles not take the 3 points and make it a 2score game that is so pathetic
did calais kill the shutout just now
that miss was just bound to happen
yknow
offense is so bad
holy fuck the offense is entirely in misstep so many penalties
gimme a touchdown right here and ill nut
oline is really struggling
goat
almost another fruit punch
defense is gassed
sigh
the fuck
is this me or this game is going fast
fucking go for it
fuck these refs smh
honestly we need to fix something soon with pittsburgh coming up
roman needs to be replaced
these refs getting on my nerves
we traded lamar jackson mid game to the eagles
okall you gloomy weenies can calm down
this team man lol
titans win
did rg3 come in i turned it off what happened how did the eagles score
belee
lolnice
thank god and im shocked it was judon who finally did something useful this season lol
why in the name of all that is holy does roman go away from the running game almost every game
get roman the fuck outta bmore
earl thomas catches that
really stroking my shit for fun now
offense has been a fucking joke and predictably our defense is getting gassed because they cant do literally everything i am utterly shocked this is happening this offense has fallen off a map after last year this team is supposed to be a top three superbowl contender
sign antonio brown mannnnnn
this fucking defense misses every damn sack i stg
why is every throw sidearm
pack it in boys gg
lamar looks like shit and people need to stop making excuses for him

dude needs to to a sports psych or somethin on the bye week cause he clearly has the yips
i could care less if we beat the eagles we gotta fix our offense asap
2000 ravens simulation good defence trent dilfur type offence
another great start to a drive 2nd and 17
cmon lamar
slants and screens middle of the field is soft
random but im nervous as hell to face the steelers
peters is kinda bad sometimes

just tuned in same shit from the kc game no pressure at all on wentz
biden trump downplayed the coronavirus

also biden trumps lockdowns are horrible

can i just say i fucking hate the white jerseys because i really hate our away uniforms

ok roman and lamar dont shit the bed here
i told you guys we are going to blow this game im here to say it again we are going to lose sorry raven flock

trade marcus peters dude is a bum

oh fuck off mcphee im heated on that one what a pathetic drop
first great throw all game
this game sucks to watch
wentzs passing is as cringe as elliots love for the joker

i would honestly rather run on every play rather than try to force throws half the time
shot ourselves in the foot an nearly bled out the running game is meh the oline is meh marlon humphrey is having an incredible year peters gambles too much wrs dropped a lot of balls overall grade today a d

we need a better quarter back sorry not sorry
im calling it like i did 30 minutes ago its going to be a blowout and we will lose defense can only protect you for so long without offense putting up any points on the fields
trade marcus peters dude is a bum and gave up 160 yards
trash defense ravens trash seasons gone gg boys

edit forgot the s for all the slow fuckers in the thread
why do i get a feeling this is about to be a blowout i hate to say it but i think were going to lose

it must be 2008 or later since thats when the nfl logo was changed
my favorite part might just be the little banner ribbon above our logo that just says nfl lol youd think itd be something like est 1996 or afc north divisional champs oranything deserving of a ribbon
my god that is so terrible but awesome at the same time
not even joking my grandfather owns that exact same thing lol he bought it either right before or after the first super bowl so you could probably date it at 2000 or 2001
dumb question did you check the tags on the inside lol
woooooooow
i would wear the hell out of that

either way its getting worn

i find it kinda funny that sizzle ended up playing just one more game than ray haha
let sam koch
most folks outside of baltimore wouldnt appreciate special teams the way we do until something happens to their team because of their kicker or punter

special teams absolutely matters we definitely appreciate sam koch

thats a durable koch
also the best qb of all time

as much as i hate the steelers its always hilarious to see the browns get smashed


this was the first legit lamar play ive seen from him this year it was the kind of crazy shit he pulled once a game last year gotta get that mojo going again

it is crazy that they can afford to use real games as practice sessions benefits of having the easiest schedule hopefully theyre saving their a game for the steelers and titans
ive tried to explain this in the last two game threads on rnfl were doing exactly what we need to do to develop him as a passer and were about to be 51 it looks ugly because hes still learning
i dont like the designed roll outs so often seems like hes better in the pocket and it doesnt cut the field down the rg position is a problem big time i like sneed as a guy but it seems like dd and proche should take most of his snaps
im more concerned by romans schemes for passing it seems almost nonexistent by the lack of guys getting open i know hes not sean payton or andy reid but man i dont see much creativity unless its a run
if this game goes to ot thats just extra reps right
john should call his brother jim to shout at these players
dw im with you running the ball is not as effective as people believe do people really expect us to run or 3rd and long like tf
im with you i want to see lamar continue to develop unfortunately what im seeing is that all the progress he made coming into last season in terms of his footwork arm angle and delivery is all gone that level of regression concerns me
pass game has looked damn decent today no huge plays a few deflections and bad ol play but its been sharper and more spread out than it has been in recent weeks
im with you we got an easy enough schedule that lamar can get real game reps as a passer to learn and still win
youre not lamar needs to throw its obvious our qb and wr arent in synch with the playbook our run game isnt anywhere near what we we saw last week and the coaches clearly dont many designed runs for lamar
they want lamar to get better at passing but they dont want him to throw the ball
imagine if we ran the ball all the time thats how teams figure out our offense id rather see lamar using more passing plays and getting better game after game

also were up by 17 and are 41 people need to chill on the worst offense ever talk
its not that we want him to run every play its that we dont want him to pass every single play and rush for 3 yards a game
and hes obviously getting better
but thats what makes the offense so deadly if we have lama4 barely run it gets rid of the whole run option for the defense last year it was 3 options the defense had to work out running back runs lama4 passes or lamar runs and this year hes been running a lot less and the offense isnt looking too good
funny meme
i mean it does work when he runs it and mixes with passes instead of giving it away to our rbs i feel like sometimes ravens get too confident and the coordinators dont care like today
this game was the best game he had in his career as a passer even though he goes for the side arm passes way too much he was passing with great timing and passing outside effectively enough for other teams to notice
it was kind of nice to see some of those early passes to duv and to see dobbins getting some more reps i had a heart attack when snead fumbled after that long catch and run our defense definitely carried us yesterday though those penalties were embarrassing cant convert if your 25 yards from the sticks every set of downs it was nice to see a couple good runs from lamar and nice to see other receivers getting involved
i swear black qbs are the only ones that are considered still developing after winning an mvp leading the league in passing tds lmaoooooooooo i think the most glaring developments need to be from the o line and recievers
its not about running it more its about threatening to run it more
develop as a passer he lead the league in passing touchdowns hes not a bad passer hes actually a really good one who just hasnt found his stride yet this season and the play calling isnt helping if you dont establish the run this team is very predictable on offence which it should never be
this subs attitude this year has been disappointed annoying as hell
i agree hes gotta throw the ball at some point this is the nfl nobodys ever won by running the ball every down he came into the nfl as an extremely raw passer he has to develop at some point hes gotten better every year the sky is the limit

removed
way to go and place the hex jinx on em lol

its hard fir me to imagine looking at this game and thinking its a wr problem
oline and a dip in lamars own performance are the real issues but neither one of these can easily be addressed through tradesfa

a veteran wr would open things up more though so i wouldnt be shocked to see a trade before the steelers game
yes its the recivers fault that hes overunder thrown or has to come back to the ball because leading the reciver seems to not make sense to the qb if anything his weeks shows that lamar needs to ditch this side arm throwing bullshit and practice on hitting a reciver leading them through the route recivers have been fine in this eagles game so far lamar has not

came here to bitch about that how is that allowed
its gotta run out of air eventually right
shove it up their ass then proceed to empty the cannister

its fucking brutal i just memed it

urban isnt the one throwing side arm duds and not leading open recivers
ravens dont have a single former qb on its coaching staff never liked that fact

oh shit thats what that fucking noise was
shit was so obnoxious though i didnt hear it again in the second half they made the guy leave or something
this was annoying to me too and im an eagles fan
glad they got him
they were doing that shit in the oriolesphillies series and it pissed me off to no end
we were calling him out in our own subreddit thread reagles how somebody like that isnt kicked out of the stadium almost immediately is absurd
anyone have audio link of it
didnt this happen outside a baseball game earlier this year
im from philadelphia hate the eagles love the ravens and philadelphia fans are just obnoxious
i keep the volume so low that i couldnt hear it
ikr i was wondering wth theyd even allow that nonsense ridiculous imo
so much crying about philadelphia fans lmao



well thats totally completely absolutely not something i ever would have expected to happen three years ago
sure as hell doesnt feel like 20 points lmao
just 2 more games and we got an nfl record
we really are spoiled as a franchise i tend to be an optimistic fan but even at 51 i still think weve been disappointing
so youre saying the ravens have a good offense
you wouldnt know it from fan sentiment
i mean for a few games in a row last year they scored every possession lol the efficiency has been historic
we still have one of the best os in the league and its like were not even at 50 of our potential
we have to do that against the steelers next week should be interesting
1 cup of spoiled kool aid please
if my memory serves me well we ended denvers 20 point streak

cant fuck with the tuck
lets hide behind this wall of chainsaws ravens offense
i mean to be fair he had to be used to it with all the years of flacco that he endured
what wouldve been the fga if ravens had tried at the beginning of the 2h when jackson had that bad sack that took them out of field goal range i felt they shouldve tried anyway
this commercial has been on forever and it still gets a chuckle out of me
ugh fine im just glad i did extra stretches today

facts

ive never seen an athlete that the worst they play the more endorsementscommercials they get
this is a bad take the dude had bruised ribs and his offensive line was getting him beat up on
ha ha
you guys defend other teams qb more than you care to defend your mvp qb why is that

if you go to the eagles board or browns board they are shitting all over jacksonyet here you people are quick to defend the no 1 and no 2 overall picks that no one ever questioned their abilities as a qb
technically we are media so and since its been posted on this sub then i think we are at the next stage at this point

your post is bad and you should feel bad
last season he had an elite deep cover safety playing behind him he doesnt have that this year
peters gives us 2 elite cbs that pi call was bs and hes playing great this season and last
idk about hot garbage but he has been much worse this year
this is how peters always is makes plays that make him look like a genius but also gives up a couple baffling and infuriating plays on occasion
did everything they could to get philly back in this game ravens have played like shit no doubt but my god these fucking refs are ridiculous
they needed it to end as a 1 score game so the eagles would cover after listening to a podcast about tim donaghy and the nba betting scandal i am not convinced that any sport refereed by humans is on the up and up
complaining about refs is lame


the second half literally made me fucking sick
i think the refs were trying to save them selves from the eagles fans by having everything go their way

that is absolutely lamarvelous
the rules are simple

previous weeks

week 1 lamar jackson
week 2 marlon humphrey
week 3 whole team except special teams blame
week 4 patrick queen
week 5 defense

this weeks nominees are
justin tucker for hitting two field goals from 46 and one from 55 like its nothing those are not easy kicks he misses any one of those and we lose
calais campbell
calais campbell
justin tucker

nodoubting three 40 yarders including a 55 yarder i love that man
easiest decision ever

matt skura

only ravens olineman to not get penalized today and lets be real this is probably the only time he will ever get a chance to be player of the week so lets let him have it yall
deshon elliot and calais campbell absolutely no one else
ravens alltime great most games played record holder sam koch

thanks for giving opposing offenses long fields over the years
gonna say special teams overall tucker was money koch won the field position battle for most of the game when the offense couldnt get a first down and defense couldnt get a stop we got the onsides kick recovery
justin tucker he misses one of those on this windy day and we lose


justin tucker

won by less points than his 55 yard fg added
hopefully we can get a blame of the game eventhough we won if so penalties
big boi calais
calais or no one else

im annoyed af
deshon elliott
justin tucker and calais campbell
were winning but these dont feel like w at all

another ugly ass win
calais campbell
tucker
you guys are gonna hate me for this but lamar he came through when we needed it
calais campbell and its not even close really
campbell and tucker pretty much it
calais campbell the big guy feasted against the eagles honorable mention goes to deshon elliott for his determination effort and hustle to run down and force a fumble after his bad ankle to start that huge miles sanders run in the third quarter even if the eagles ended up scoring on a lucky bounce i guess matthew judon edit and lj fort deserves an honorable mention too seeing how he they made the gameclinching tackle the same goes for justin tucker because his field goals made a difference today and he makes making 55yarders like look the easiest thing ever
tucker without him we lose
proche with the onside kick recovery
calais campbell
calais campbell because he is a grown ass man
campbell on d

but without tuck we wouldnt have won this game
justin tucker
justin tucker
calais campbell
most definitely my all time favorite player tucker

edit campbell deserves credit as well they are pretty much the only two though
campbell harassed the shit out of wentz
campbell for sure he had 3 sacks and hit wentz multiple times hes been a huge pickup for us and hes been underrated for way too long now
calais campbell
tucker and jackson everyone else seemed super undisciplined
lamar im proud of him good bounce back game
calais campbell

3 sacks ate doubles all day set the tone for a solid defensive day in a game where defense had to make up for the offense being way too slow
not greg roman

calais campbell

we are bottom 2 ranked pass offense this needs to change if we want to compete for a ship lamar has bailed us out enough we can take a risk with a new oc

50 shades of trestman all over again
campbell
calais campbell deshon elliott look his effort running on the arcega td this earl thomas would never do that for me
judon
2 pt conversion stop won it for us
gotta be cc
campbell
not a lot of deserving players today im voting calais campbell
special teams
campbell

nobody was great tbh disappointing performance
campbell dude had three sacks
special teams

the only unit that consistently performed today
dst
calais for me with the hear marlon is having he is still an argument for best defensive player with everything he has done that play on the early screen pass was amazing
special teams

justin tucker with the auto foot once again and that on side recovery at the end to seal the deal
calais campbell for all those sacks
the monstar himself
james proche after all that bullshit
campbell easy
campbell
we won but im gonna nominate the offensive line for blame of the game anyway too many penalties and tackles for loss
calais has to be hm to tucker
tuckere
calius or jimmy
campbell
calais
am i going to get downvoted for being the only one to say marlo
the eagles almost any other team and we lose this game calais campbell was amazing too
tuck need i say more
tucker
patrick ricard for the pair of blocks that opened the path for the 2nd td rewatch that play he pushed a guy 5 feet to his left then spun around crossed the gap and pushed a 2nd guy 5 feet to the right to make a wide open runway for lamar
lamar he was still not mvp level but showed improvement on and offense that kept shooting itself in the foot encouraged about the steelers game
campbell had a world beater of a game but humphrey did too so its hard for me
easy its campbell
the officials
campbell or tucker

if tucker does not hit that 55 yarder we lose
i thought it was fine except for the penalties penalties really destroyed us the whole game plus the refs hoed us on those last few calls on defense
yes yes it was that bad an effort like that is going to get us rolled against the steelers
as a whole yes the offensive line was playing like ass the penalties were mostly boneheaded mental errors
offensive line isnt as good as it was last year
way too many penalties all over
on on the positive note lamar rushed 108 yards on 9 attempts which i believe is 12 ypc which is good af and lamar utilized boyle instead of spamming andrews

on the bad a shit ton fucking penalties mainly by our oline not creating big enough lanes for our rushers to pass through a couple under thrown and over thrown passes and apparently forgot how to convert 3rd downs in the second half
lines been an issue penalties run game not as good as last year lamar seemingly under pressure most plays this bye week we need to figure out our oline also we get williams and hopefully wolfe back
i think the offense will be okay they had some sustained drives and turns out when you have a 1st and 15 every possession it doesnt go great
it wasnt our best outing nor our worst lamar was pretty good on the ground though i really want him to look at the flim and see how bad his mechanics are
an important stat our rbs put up 74 yards on 28 carries today
more times than not we see ourselves 2nd and 10 first down plays seem to get us nowhere
i have a buddy who has been saying that we need better wrs bc our wrs are trash hes partly right we need better wrs bc we need people who will make up for lamar jacksons inaccurate throws i read some dumb trades we want to see article bc what else are you going to do on a wednesday work and it had us getting julio jones for a first round pick thats the kind of player that we need i have done 0 research on the salary stuff so i dont know if it will work i think that will help our offense a lot
yes it was dogshit playcalling

did you get a new account or are you a different person
we have beaten every bird team minus ourselves although we have beaten ourselves a few times in the last 3 seasons
i think we still own it right need to check birdbros reddit

edit yeah we do
this belongs in a museum
purple birds green birds
i asked for one before but you should post another added on that has a darker background please
dont you mean the lombirdy trophy
title lol just funny seeing it on the jets
flacco looks so mad playing for the jets poor guy
flacco never mentally recovered from that acl injury he lost some mobility but more than anything he lost all of his aggression which made up for his 12 bonehead passes per game
i dont get why people are saying that the ravens are experimenting with their offense vs bad teams whats experimental about running the same plays over and over with that being said roman was calling better plays this week but he was inconsistent also oline penalties shafted any good play that the offense wouldve gotten at times lamar played better than last week for the most part too but still some mistakes like not throwing it away and the occasional miscommunication im glad that theyre able to win even with their issues hopefully they can fix them during the bye week
you watched that game right lamar did not have a good game throwing he made terrible throws and needs to ditch that schoolyard side arm crap
last few weeks some people in this sub have stated that ingram should not get more carries than dobbins and gus today he got significantly less due to being shaking up dont get me fletcher cox is a beast and destroyed a lot of our runs but personally i think this game shows ingrams experience and skill set gets under appreciated by some people in this sub
i think the problem is the plays not the players jk isnt much of a northsouth runner but all those fakes are so bad they are faking no one but taking your own players out of the game
if the oline is garbage it doesnt matter whos running the ball
i love ingram but i cant imagine he wouldve have too much more success most of our hand offs were stuff before the handoff was completed i hope we start to see some faster under center runs
justice hill deserves a shot hes the fastest of all of them
i think if we going to have a trade we will have it this week with covid protocols and all who are our targets maybe a wr or a te
i believe the wr corps can get it together duvernay and brown have the ability to create separation and sneed had some solid catches i want the passrush to be improved if anything all these sacks and hurries look good but lets not forget who weve played for the last three weeks washington cincy philly all terrible olines if we want to compete with the titans and chiefs then we have to improve with passrush
offensive lineman yanda leaving seriously messed up any chemistry they had last year fix that up and give lamar an average 1s longer to throw could make a huge difference getting a wr doesnt do much if lamar doesnt have the time
julio
it fucking better interior o line and a receiver desperately
how do we feel about a brandon cooks or a mike williams
kerrigan for pass rush or possibly one of chicagos 57 tes
curtis samuel
no great line help on the block anywhere i think we maybe make a pass at a wr but no one on the block is likely
get julio jones and antonio brown now
julio and an a new right guard idk who is available there

we were never behind that game and it was only a tie once at 00 be grateful that we won we could have lost that game but we didnt
hard disagree this wasnt a loss by a miracle

this meme sucks
we dont have ours either and after todays game well be lucky if we have it after the steelers game shitty meme
i dont know man i just dont feel justified in talking shit with this team

we never gave up the lead thats a w and were 51
eagles had a lot of wild catches in clutch moments just to have a chance i dont like it but my only issue is we cant finish our sacks i pretty much anticipate every qb to do some wild stuff in order to have 5 mor seconds to throw
will be a ufa this offseason and looks like hes ready for a change of scenery could probably be had for a 5th
why would the colts trade him at this point theyre potential playoffs opponents
we need help by the deadline not by offseason
dont think he adds anything hollywood or duvernay doesnt our weak passing game so far hasnt been on our wrs imo
why would we want an older wr that plays a similar style to hollywood this team is lacking a big bodied possession receiver in the bmarshjefferyjulio mold not a declining speedster
i dont really care about any free agent who doesnt play offensive or defensive line
your playcalling is sketchy sketch but when its good its really gooooooood
his route tree fucking sucks
its been my gripe since the titans loss where is the creativity give me a trick play to get everyone back involved i never want to hear we play our game again
offense mainly oline needs to click more and were 51 and the sky is falling mentality on this sub is ridiculous

yes its perfectly fine to criticize the offense they arent perfect and the penalties were absolutely embarrassing today but lets take a collective chill pill if we arent playing our best football and are 51 into a bye then that tells you something about this team

raiders beat the chiefs and chargers really almost did as well patriots lost to denver today 9ers got destroyed by the dolphins last week seattle got taken to the wire with the vikings who look bad its okay to have tough stretches difference is great teams squeak out these wins
i agree with you but i think people are concerned that if were struggling now then the steelers cowboys pats titans are gonna smack us it is okay to have a tough stretch but when the going is only gonna get tougher it is concerning to say the least especially with this team who has superbowl aspirations
agree with pretty much everything in here good post wanted to add my own thoughts

for whatever reason this sub seems to believe that there is only one way to be a fan of a football team and its whatever their way is people just let ravens fans enjoy football in whatever way they want if youre a fan who likes to pinpoint every mistake and qualify our record at every opportunity thats fine if you want to ignore the bad and put blinders on and be happy were 51 thats fine too

for some reason there seems to be a prevailing attitude that the way we discuss our team matters it doesnt were fans for gods sake if uoverlyoptimisticravensfan just wants to be happy that we won dont fucking respond to him and tell him thats not allowed because the offense sucks and the steelers will crush us if uoverlypessimisticravensfan wants to voice his concerns with the oline and the secondary theres no need to tell him to shut up because we won and he shouldnt complain i honestly think that some people forget that nothing that ever happens on this sub will influence anything in real life lmao
barring injuries the longer the season goes the better our online will get the rookie phillips for instance should get more comfortable very few rookie o line men have a good first half of the year
football teams are made up of humans they make mistakes have bad games etc what separates the great nfl teams from the mediocre and bad teams is how they respond the ravens are a team that consistently responds positively to issues that they encounter theyll work this week on those issues players will be held responsible etc there have been a number of concerning things that weve seen this year but theres still time for them to work on improving everything
panic will set in for me if we are in week 12 and offense hasnt hit its stride i think its kind of good that our team hasnt got hot early on hopefully this is building character and making them tougher id rather us be hot heading into last 5 games or so and ride that vibe into the playoffs than be regular season warriors like last year
ive had this realization the past couple weeks after the game i feel like the offense hasnt played that well and we still score 30 like every game its quite a luxury haha
people just need some perspective the only stats that matter are wins and losses and we are 51 id say thats pretty good and better than 42 where we were last year
best take on here imo its not panic time were doing great right now offense is worrisome though but just hoping they catch fire mid to late season

anyone else notice that marty bass on the local post game show seemed to be slurring his words is he drunk or did he have a stroke or something
hes always drunk after games lol
id assume inebriated though i didnt catch the segment

i legit never noticed till this meme that the kid has a fist full of sand lol
mood
schooled in dallas but hes no cowboy


view poll
i think it should be gus with dobbins as the 3rd down back i dont think the ol is good enough anyways ingram seems to be hesitant gus just runs downhill which is something we need right now need to get dobbins in space
dobbins should be the starter and 3rd down back with gus the goaline and short yardage back
ingram has proven that he can run over people and pick up multiple big plays a games
dobbins needs to develop honestly he needs to beat up on a bad front a little bit to gain confidence so we shouldve used him more last week
im mad only 10 people chose ricard
ingram dammit
gus bus and its not even a question
its tough because how much of it is ingram and how much of it is the line dobbins definitely showed hes not a starter yet today imo

a win is a win and you take it in this league

but lets not get content with this record we didnt play a good game offensively and the defence just fell asleep second half lot of work is needed another week of the same mistakes as the previous 3 with a nice touch of penalties added to that
win whats important now

no team is ever locked to win the super bowl
hell no not the way were playing
not with this offense
well they already beat washington on the road so there goes that theory i suppose both times baltimore won super bowls they lost away washington and additionally the ravens split with pit winning against them on the road losing versus them at home

another thing that happened both times but is unlikely this time around is denver also being in the postseason to defeat en route a world championship victory sorry i just wanted to make mention of some other random meaningless statistics
i remember going to the playoffs 106 and the last time that happened we won the sb then a ne wr threw a touchdown pass on us

team needs to win the division first and pit is not looking like they will go down easy
i wish it worked like that but it doesnt

now its time to study how the likes of michael thomas deandre hopkins larry fitzgerald catch balls

last night i watched an hour and a half of marlonhumphreys tape studying how he gets the ball out officialshon4

video in tweet

github whatsnew
i studied tape of tucker and i got my ball out
we have a week off until the beloved steelers game to hopefully be the team to hand them their first loss of the season also some other news devin bush is done for the season
steelers look legit wasnt expecting them to be an actual threat this year i have a hard time seeing them lose more than 4 games this year gonna be tough to win the division if we cant hand them one or two losses
lets feast
hopefully the titans hand them their first loss and then the ravens provide their asses with a second straight l especially with this flawed postseason system the ravens are 51 yet would be a 5th seed right now at best that sucks

lets not even begin to bring up how unfair it will be when some nfc least franchise gets to host another nfc opponent with a much better record simply because someone has to win the worst division in football
i hate cheering for injuries even for the steelers but that certainly makes winning the division easier i guess both teams did end up losing that game after all
i am very very nervous for this game


honestly saying this as a ravens fan thought wentz played the best game of any qb this year

7 hours later

in buffalo romans offense fizzled out after a few seasons

in san francisco romans offense fizzled out after a few seasons

in baltimore
yes
cant implement a new offense this season were got to have to stick it out with roman the rest of this season
roman has been with ravens head coachjim harbaughfor several years as an assistant dating back to 2009

im pretty sure jim hasnt been the ravens hc for even a day
greg and greg
not until we move on from jackson what roman did with jackson last year was historic too soon to move on
plz

i still dont understand why our offense is so different from last year in playcalling and execution losing yanda is part of it but it has to be more than that
our offense calls to many plays that start with dumbass fakes that nobody bites on
wont be popular but lamar isnt progressing in his reads he misses the tight throw too often and doesnt make a quick read when its there he waits for a big play and the line isnt good enough this year to allow it to play out yandas departure hurts but teams have come prepared to play us now additionally hursts blocking hasnt been replaced

the defense is scrappy and its a physically violent scheme better than last years the defense will make up for mistakes with forced turnovers to get us good field position which is necessary to stack wins for us

adding a receiver isnt a bad idea but it wont compensate for lamar missing open guys and waiting too long to make a decision

now i love lamar hes my qb and my guy im ride or die just honest criticism from a fan for all 25 years
defenses are playing smarter
ravens fans should be happy that theyre 51 and stop being so whiny
fire greg roman
this was lamars best game throwing outside the numbers in his career
the scheme is slightly different this year too last year was a lot of three tight end sets with high low concepts this year we only carry 2 tight ends and ricard cant run routes passed like 2 yards were trying to stretch the field instead using wr but lamar hasnt been able to hit those shots oline has been poor in addition to the slight change in scheme the coaches are definately holding lamar back as well him running is such a huge threat not sure if that knee injury is whats causing it but i dont think they want to unleash lamar yet
we have the whiniest fan base maybe in all of sports for fucks sake were 51 and people talking about people need to be fired enjoy the ride man
lamar is an average thrower
i think we should open up trade talks with dallas for michael gallup they need a db so i could see marcus peters be a decent trade to get a recover who is very good and would help us tremendously got flamed for saying marcus peters got torched on sunday but its just facts
if you want a hot take coming from a outsider living in baltimore the ravens have had a cake walk schedule this year teams are figuring out lamar and the real issue that i see is that they have no 1 wr that was not addressed in the draft

mb is ok but hes not a 1 he can take the top off but they need a big true 1 wr

the fact that the ravens almost lost against the eagles today with no jeffery jackson ertz godert or sanders is scary they were literally starting wr and tes from practice squads and the xfl

i dont even think the ravens make the playoffs this year
im starting to think our wr issues come from our offensive coaches a wrs first job is to catch the ball blocking is second and a nice addition to have boykin is really out there just blocking every play so much so he forgets to run his route

this is the 3rd game where he just did rubbish on 3rd down if hes not catching he shouldnt be playing duv was targeted 3 times and caught all 3 thats a 3rd wrs job
a blocking wr had a place in last years offense since weve apparently decided to throw that offense in the trash and try to be passfirst im not sure what purpose he serves
duv needs a bigger role every time he touches the ball something good happens dude can make plays with the ball in his hands and he looks natural out there
out of curiosity are you british

oh i agree with what you are saying
been saying this for weeks

he and snead offer no playmaking abilities and need to be schemed open roman hasnt shown he can do that this year or any other year hes been a coordinator
a blocking wr is a bad wr we need guys who can get the ball i agree with you about the coaches the wr coach has been trash since he got here
wow we should just fire roman and hire you

can you imagine where hed be if torrey caught all those pi call passes
what kind of clickbait shitty title is that
flacco is currently the backup quarterback for the new york jets perhaps hell get an opportunity to pass montana later this season the jets are so bad that flacco could either get a start or get some playing time in a blowout loss

new york is currently trailing miami 240 midway through the fourth quarter the jets will fall to 06 on the season with a loss tonight

wow someone isnt paying any attention the writer knows the score yet clearly isnt watching gee golly wiz i hope joe gets an opportunity to step onto the field this season

oh wait he saw action vs denver due to darnolds injury and has since started both of the jets two most recent games against arizona miami respectively

pretty fucking terrible the offensive line couldnt keep the game clean for shit and the officials handed philly a god awful dpi that came pretty close to letting them tie it
sloppy af but its a w
offence didnt get much going and the defence fell asleep we let them back in the game but held them at the end for a close that should never have been close win
3028 good guys
bad we was up 246 in the 2nd half and got outscored 226 to only win by 2 not good enough we didnt deserve to win but did so ill take that
no good
not good at all
dont even mention julio because we cant afford him and i dont want to give a 1st round pick for someone in his 30s
just looking at teams with 14 records or worse

marvin jones golden tate sterling shepard jamison crowder and brandin cooksfullerstills
id gladly give a 1 for julio what are you smoking
jacob hollister
corey davis zach ertz
michael gallup of dallas for marcus peters dallas needs a db bad and unpopular opinion incoming i dont think marcus peters is a great cb he ballhawks himself out of position quite often and he is constantly giving up huge plays if he stays i would like to see him moved to safety

what am i looking at
lol that will be a fine this week
high socks are required he really doesnt care

x200b


next thing we know marcus peters is gonna ride around town in black air force 1s and a trench coat saying shit like you come at the king you best not miss and a man gotta have a code someone call mcnaulty
i saw that shit today and was like
just rawdogging his shoes smh
the league will likely fine him
i think he took them off mid game i was so puzzled when he game out in like the 3rd quarter
what was criminal is him accepting todays game check he should pay us for having to watch his garbage play today

the two main issues i had with lamar today were 1 not stepping into throwsrelying on the sidearm when he didnt need to as charles davis pointed out on the broadcast and 2 going way too far backwards on dropbacks to the point where using his natural scramble ability becomes a bad option and hes forced to throw it away oh and he threw a few too many chunky balls for my liking


but man he did pretty damn good all things considered we cant expect him to be perfect every week even if he hit 1583 multiple times last year at least the flaws in his game are identifiable and rectifiable week to week with good coaching
he needs a fucking wr for crying out loud
this confirmed what ive been seeing all year long lamar hasnt really regressed the offensive system has just been figured out by everyone else how the fuck is a qb supposed to be successful with the amount of pressure he faces plus the lack of receiving weapons it literally seems like our run plays are getting stuffed constantly and nobody gets open ever i really hope roman doesnt waste lamars talent and changes some stuff to get some easy yards or we need to fire him and hire a new creative mind after this year this run first style was cool but now we have basically no pass game and its fucking us over when we need to move the ball
no part of this offense is clicking right now

the line is not getting a big push in a game where the ravens were up 18 going into the 4th quarter they were not able to open holes for the rbs

the wr are just not getting open boykins in hood for one bad option route a game snead gets no separation

lamar needs to do a few things 1 learn what a touch throw is 2 step into passes 3 throw a little more accurately

but this all comes down to one person and thats greg roman this offense is predictable and uninspired they run less options they give up the run to quickly they dont run screens which means teams can come after lamar i dont see slants despite having duvarney and hollywood they dont take deep shots
if this is lamars floor i wont complain
anytime i see qbr i hear skips voice on a scale from 1 to 100
we have a bye to get right and they lost devin bush for the year sucks and sorry for him on the other hand theyre playing very well on both sides of the ball in ways that we arent

things im worried about when our offense is on the field
the rg position and getting annihilated by heyward and watt
our difficulty establishing the run as a result
minkah effectively spying lamar

all leading to lamar needing to beat them with his arm if we get the lamar of the past 4 weeks then we will need a defensive feast to win

on the positive side i think we have the personnel to take advantage of them in the passing game especially their linebackers vs dobbins and boyleandrews plus i dont think they can completely shut down hollywood and i think duvernay can be an excellent slot read and backfield threat to punish their aggressiveness

things im worried about when our defense is on the field
we will probably not get much pass rush their o line is good and our rushers arent
ben has the ability to punish our blitzes he may not be himself this year but im sure he has enough bullshit in the tank to piss us off a few more times
claypool looks irritating

i do think of our dbs get up for this game and brandon williams plays we match up quite well versus their offense in theory im good with marlon and peters vs juju and claypool queens coming along well

all in all i think this has to be a game plan similar to the one we rolled out against the pats last year quick and horizontal to slow their pass rush and rpos to capitalize on their weaker secondarybackup linebackers
ive read on the subreddit about playing weaker opponents and having lamar become a better passer but i believe the steelers are a game where we should utilize our best assets

these next two weeks should rely on getting the run game going working on our defensive pressure on ben and not getting complacent we saw how potent our run game can be today how pressuring a qb can work for us and how complacency almost cost us a game

if we decide to air it out they need to be plays comfortable for lamar when lamar gets hot our offense is unstoppable i think getting good drives in the beginning to put the pressure on the steelers could seal the deal

im excited for the game but also hesitant the bye should help us prepare for the game but its a ravenssteelers game so im not ruling anything out
gonna be so mad when wink just throws db blitzes at the fat one and he picks apart
nice write up i think you hit just about all of the major points i hope lamar really works on stepping into his throws with more confidence instead of the more recent relaxed side arm stuff
i mean the steelers have also have struggles against weaker opponents its not like they are unstoppable

1 fix the penalties first off those are momentum killers

2 our offense has driven down the field we just need to finish it off with td not field goals

3 continue getting to the qb like we have this season

i am more optimistic then some with this game
im afraid ben is gonna pick apart our blitzes i wouldnt be worried if wink new how to call plays that arent blitzes but even against the chiefs he was like fuck it lets keep blitzing to a detriment
im drinking the ravens are holding back koolaid so im not that worried no one really has a clue what theyre talking about everyone favored ravens over the chiefs and look how that turned out being the narrative underdogs against the steelers are a good thing imho
we score more points than they do
i think the defense ahould do well enough if they play like they did for the first 3 quarters today the steelers offense hasnt impressed me tbh seems very predicated on the connection between ben and claypool but our secondary is our biggest strength so i feel like we can limit them there


the steelers have a great d line and that will cause problems like you said id prefer to see a lot of runs to the outside short passes and really grind away i feel like its almost the reverse of the usual we need to establish the pass so that the run game opens up


and for fucks sake no more dumb penalties
stop the penalties in key situations that pi at the end of the game vs the eagles couldve almost cost us the w luckily we got out of it but it happened before one big part of the l against the titans was the fact that we played against us
whats up with lamars arm slot he had a nifty little sidearm completion on a cross to hollywood thats cool

with a clean pocket and a guy open downfield hes doing some goofy sidearm delivery and throwing balls into the dirt he missed a guy by 5 yards yesterday

last year he stepped into those throws and delivered darts whats up injury we dont know about
might as well give up we have no shot tradefire everyone we are the worst s
every game is different kansas city bitched the hell out of us and then laid an egg the week prior and the week after

not super worried about it it will be competitive but im sure we can figure it out
on defense do not blitz with our cbs plain and simple they should be covering the wrs rush 4 or 3 and drop 7 or 8
if we dont get to ben its gonna look like the chiefs game
on offense lamar just has to play smart cant force the ball against that defense i hope the offense work on screens during the bye because i gotta feeling the steelers are gonna blitz the living hell out of lj on passing downs
trade for juju steelers traded with us this offseason for wormley juju nota getting the targets he deserves and hes a free agent next season
how do we beat the chiefs is what i want to know
congrats to 5 years for me and the w from the ravens

same
let me preface this by saying how much i love our mvp qb i remember the kyle boller grbac anthony wright and chris redman days for some of you new fans those were dark days

the s 41 attempts 238 yards 58ypc and 1 td

besides todays game and the one rush for 50 yards against the bengals the numbers are abysmal

im not upset with lamar i dont think any ravens fan should be upset with lamar i think we the fans are more baffled with the coaches who arent setting this guy up for success hes the most electric athlete in the nfl today his running ability opens up his throwing lanes however lamar has had abysmal rushing s this year

so the question we as fans deserve an answer to is this is lamar not running as much because lamar doesnt want to run as much or is it because the coaches dont want him to run as much

on one hand lamar might want to prove hes an elite passer and shut up the haters it could be possible considering how competitive he is i personally think theres no doubt hes an elite passer minus the last 34 games hes played the latter could be because theyre scheming and coaching up the pass offense or it could just be theyre not great at scheming passes greg roman either way is a little disturbing to the bottom line of the team as a whole either way i hope they figure it out and play better its crazy this teams so good they are 51 despite playing very poorly on the offensive side of the ball

this offense runs well when lamar does whats your thoughts
i personally wouldnt say lamar is and elite passer yet he 100 can get there but the covid season has definitely hurt him no preseason minicamp otas etc he has little chemistry with anyone outside of hollywood and andrews and thats not really his fault snead doesnt get open boykin blocks on pass plays and duvernay isnt on the field enough as far as his rushing the opponents are doing a fantastic job defending the read option keepers to the outside the opponents always have more guys out there on the edge than the ravens can block and as a result the ravens should be able to pass on these teams when they are committing to the run hard but they dont they double andrews play man with a safety to help on hollywood and leave the rest of our pass catchers 1v1 and they dont get open if we could consistently get easy gains through the air lamar would have more open lanes to run and the offense would look similar to last year but its just not there i believe theyll figure it out and lamar and the o will get better and better as we progress through the season but the coaches and ol need to step up and do their jobs first
hasnt lamar had a knee injury for a few weeks
he really hasnt had to run and it makes no sense to just run him just to run him when youre beating teams by 3 scores
honestly his loss on the line shows all the pre snap penalties the holds the holes that the front 7 finds when marshal yanda was there shit like this didnt happen now though without yanda the weakness is pretty clear yanda was the anchor on the line and with every game those issues are showing through

the offense outside of the line is honestly fine at least today they were the offensive line has been a constant issue over the last 5 weeks

lamar is playing the best he can

so is mark andrews

hollywood brown

nick boyle and etc

its obvious but a shit line throws everything an offense tries into dissaray even with a mobile qb like lamar we gotta get our line situation settled otherwise against teams like the steelers who thank god we face after our bye week will fucking eat our lunch no fucking joke


just my two cents
so what youre saying is that we need to spend this bye week forcefeeding yanda copious amounts of cheese doodles until hes back to his playing weight and ready to be our starting rg vs pittsburgh in week 8
i think lamar could play better his sidearm passes have been very hit miss in the short area there was no reason for him to sidearm the pass that skipped 5 yards in front of an open mark andrews both of his interceptable passes today happened because of short armed throws he needs to trust his regular motion i also think that in the offseason he needs to try to raise his release point sometimes his release point leads to low or short passes

from a decision making standpoint he hasnt been at his best so far this season however i also believe that he made progress in that respect against the eagles

the offense doesnt only miss yanda imo they miss hurst because they miss the 3 te set out of the pistol i dont think lamar necessarily misses hurst i think gro does wo hurst gro has to design creative passing plays w 3x1 sets that isnt his strong suit never was

i actually think lamar misses seth freaking roberts its sad as hell to think about but its true he was a vet receiver with the ability to play outside inside imo he was a better more versatile receiver for us than snead last yr he also made some tough catches he only caught 20 passes but was a guy lamar trusted the playoff game soured us on him but now look the guy who is supposed to excel in his stead boykin runs 1 wrong route per game and might be too green to be relied upon this point

i think one of our offenses biggest issues is age losing yanda hurst and roberts was 1 thing replacing all 3 with rookies duvernaydobbinsphillips fluker has led to a disjointed inexperienced offense in many areas

we need to remember that our offense is 2 things young and cheap its younger and cheaper in key areas this yr vs last yr maybe we shouldve anticipated their struggles considering that however i also believe their collective ceiling is high
hollywood needs to stop falling down afterduring every catch its obnoxious he needs to actually get yac
maybe we trade for an offensive lineman
yep it is the biggest issue and the guys who were supposed to fix it were the tackles and they havent performed well enough phillips has been pretty awful to the point that they finally just benched him sunday and i think over the bye we might start working on a new rg but continuity matters on the line so whoever we pick we need to stick with for awhile and try to get them playing as a unit
thank you captain obvious
that flag for dpi was complete bullshit pass deflection good coverage idk im not a fucking football player but i do have eyes and i could tell it wasnt dpi without a replay or a rules analyst telling me so
yeah gene steratore the former ref whos the cbs rules analyst didnt like the call either small consolation but at least its not just us ravens fans hot under the collar an objective pro said it was dubious as well
i mean the receiver and mp were both battling idk how the fuck that was pi tbh honestly a really bad call that couldve led to a loss but luckily our d stepped up at the right time
i love how referees always manage to make this call only at the end of a game near a comeback i mean all game they let stuff go then suddenly they feel the need to throw the flag to ensure a comeback is possible

funny enough i dont even think it is anti raven or any conspiracy against us it just seems to be the way it happens in most nfl games wait to a huge moment to bother throwing the flag it could just be that is human nature
bowser got mugged on that play too and begged for a flag to no avail thus at the very least there should have been offsetting penalties so instead of course shawn smiths crew attempted to job out baltimore again just like the final drive buffalo last season

sooner or later that squad is going to cost the ravens a game the ravens received 4x as many flags and 66x the amount of total penalty yards compared to the eagles 12 for 132 vs 3 for 20 calls being that lopsided at the highest level is absolutely unacceptable
it was a terrible call truly terrible

but this aside i cant stand fans that spend the whole game moaning about holding calls and the other team not getting called it happens to all teams every week im sure there were holes that didnt get flagged too watch around the league and youll see it every single week

what i hate is when its clearly one sided either be really picky with holding and do that for both sides or be loose with it etc
the refs did their best to keep the eagles in this game deshaun elliot should have an interception
no offense but youre completely wrong in your pass deflection reasoning

the deflection aspect of the rule means pi cant happen after its deflected not that theres no pi if the defender eventually deflects it i could be wrong on this play since i cant find a replay but i doubt it was tipped at the line since it was 50 yards down the field

still was a bad call but not because it was deflected

willis mcgahee back when rice was the starter
he wasnt the best by a long shot but i really liked having ricky williams on the team that last year of his career
in terms of how good of a carrer he had priest holmes should be it
mcgahee leron mcclain and my personal choice of chester taylor
weve had plenty of great 2s so i wouldnt go that far yet he has been kicking butt though
priest holmes when he was 2 behind jamal lewis in 2000
i have him on my fantasy team and cant believe he hasnt gotten more action in games
it was sad watching him play tonight i think if darnold stays back we may never see joe again

i genuinely cheered my heart out for every completion and for both of their 3rd down conversions that 30 yard sack was awesome he hands off the ball off so fucking good that cadence 180000 sethut flaccos favorite

rip iron dick elite dragon i will remember you forever
hes just stealing money from the jets this doesnt count
i love the guy as ive said many times here any one of you who doubts that he has the heart of a champion and a desire to win can f off

but hes been playing professional football for many years now and father time is undefeated i just hope when he hangs up his cleats for the last time he has his health
im a ravens fan but a bigger usc fan so im torn
it was nice to see what a bad nfl offense looks like again vintage flacco in that game

also not that it matters but im pretty sure hes saying white 80

purple is too neon
i love our purple we already have almost blue
looks like a halloween sticker
that would make a decent color rush jersey put us in a thursday night game with the seahawks in their neon green and us in neon purple and id like it
i definitely prefer a darker purple
is all i have to say about today
you guys will bounce back it did have a chiefs vibe to it i felt like we were exposed that game and the same could be said for packers
hey man it happens we got smoked against kc at home your record is still very good and youll bounce back
you know what after watching back the highlights im not as pissed offensive line was bad but playcalling was better lamar looked sharper defense had a bit of a collapse but they held tight late

it seemed like a effort was made also to get lamar passes outside the numbers and he stepped up and made those passes thats a big move for his improvement i think the next step might be improving the consistency of his spiral and getting some of the sidearms out of his game of course the deep ball but i think that will come soon enough he hasnt been able to reel it in just yet
were still scoring points and winning but were being held back by the offense themselves with miscommunication and penalties

either we improve this bye week or we start losing games

and we also passed up on dj moore and calvin ridley
we are so trash at drafting and developing wrs its laughable
dont remind me
the acl tear really set him back but the pick looks even worse in hindsight he was a raw prospect with only one quality year of production playing in a relatively average conference

five years on another wr drafted in the 1st and you could easily argue the team still needs a true 1 wr
and then gave up on seriously addressing that position through the draft until after we changed gms
i like our 2 guys this year even if they are currently limited roles they both have great hands with boykin having trouble each week i think they will start getting in the game more
its not that we drafted him the 1st round but hes still in the league
perriman was actually good last yr shocking i know

a team needs to rescue him from the hellscape that is the jets

i know a lot of people want a midseason trade to get lamar some wr help but this offseason has too many free agent weapons to not wait keenan allen chris godwin and my personal favorite allen robinson this guy paired up with lamar would be absolutely elite i know the team likes to improve upon whichever part needs the most improvement such as last year with the defense and linebackers and look at us now our defense is probably the best in the league im confident this offseason if we can get a wr weapon and maybe a great olineman from the draft well be golden and allen robinson seems like an opportunity too good for the front office to pass up what do you guys think about this
would be nice but i think hes gonna be way out of range and will require some cap shuffling
im going to die on this hill

the ravens biggest need right now is not receivers yesterday showed the range of our recieving corp brown boykin snead andrews boyle duverney and dobbins all caught passes we have weapons theyre young but theyre weapons

our biggest issue and its glaring and i dont know why people want to push it off is the hole left by yanda

you can look at stats by side of the offensive line rushes to the right side result in fewer yards consistantly blitzes from the right side land more more often jackson is under more pressure when rolling to the right it is our weakness our run game is suffering and our deep play options are suffering because that side of the offensive line is completely terrible

i do not want to see us waste what very little cap space we have left for this season on a high cost veteran wr when it wont fucking matter all the weapons on the world arent going to make that hole disappear we need a quality guard before we add anymore weapons
were looking at 137mill committed to 2021 that would mean 38mill in room for the predicted cap theres a few key guys that need to be replaced or resigned stanley judon snead wolf skura bowser mcphee ward and gus

the good news is that most teams are looking at scary cap situations with the cap going down next season that could limit competition for fas and with the cap expected to go up to 225m you can get away with structuring the contract for a lower year 1 hit without too much trouble

i would prioritize the dledge in free agency but i dont hate the idea of adding robinson with judon mcphee wolf and ward pending fas in an already weak group thats going to need a lot of moves just to get back to the current quality of the group let alone improving
keenan allen just signed a contract extension with the chargers 4yr 80m so hes gonna be unavailable i would love to have have allen robinson but i think its highly unlikely he comes here
why would the bears trade him they are 51 tied for the lead in thier division need to look at teams with 14 records staring at a rebuild
lets go after juju
at the risk of answers being overly positive due to recency bias 2 forced fumbles yesterday was pretty awesome pretty much the title

expectations postearl have ranged from we cut earl for him he better back it up to hes a sixth round pick whos never done anything but get hurt lets be real
hes looked good with room for improvement exactly what youd expect out of a guy whos basically not played before this
homestly at first i was one of them people who was biased saying this and that about him i cant lie but these last couple games hes made me eat my words and im glad he seems like hes molding into that position a little time getting used to seemed to be all he needed
hes played well hes been aggressive with a few lapses in coverage but he does everything 100 the more experience he gets the more he can fine tune things i think the bye week will do some good for him i think him and chuck are similar players hybrid safeties which is a plus because they can alternate roles i like him wink has been high on him for years
hes always shown promise now hes showing he can replicate and even exceed what he was showing in practice and in the preseason

having clark and elliott back there is the best safety combo weve had since reed and landry
dude plays hard and wants to hit someone every play i like him
i dont think hes hurt us at all he also has better speed and range than earl at this pointage catches up with everyone the real bonus is no more drama and baggage that came with earl
pleasantly surprised pretty late in the offseason and this year of all years to be named starter and still play well

dude thumps and he has shown promise in coverage seems like an unheralded budda baker to me
ive been pleasantly surprised i always knew he had talent but the injuries were hard to overcome

i dont think hes been amazing or anything but he hasnt made too many mistakes tackles hard has improved consistently hes been all around solid
better than i expected if he can stay healthy and keep learning he could be a really really important piece of this defense
hes good good tackler doesnt make mistakes in coverage and has the burstsuddenness that allows him to be an amazing blitzer
serviceable starter caliber player better than kendrick lewis
i feel like if he can stay healthy he has the intangibles and the drive to be a great safety
pretty good for someone who wasnt a starter before
dudes a missile im just worried about him hurting himself coming in too hot
hes a physical force for sure but he makes a few mistakes a game if he gets the mental part down hes a decent starter right now all hes good for is delivering punishment though imo thats just my eye test

sb champion on his rookie year
this is the ravens subreddit pictures of goats belong in rfarming
mvp of the eagles game right here
thats lil boi tuck i know kickers arent meant to be bulky but even tucker looks bigger over the years compared to that baby faced assassin
absolute legend
best in the business
ill always upvote the ole tucker fucker
what more would it take for him to make the hall of fame when he retires he already has 3 pro bowl selections as many as vinatieri 5 allpro selections including 4 first team selections to vinatieris 3 total selections hes on the 2010s alldecade team he has a ring and he leads the nfl in alltime field goal

all this and hes played roughly 13 as long as vinatieri has in the nfl
butker is better
yo so no homo and all but he is gorgeous as fuck

hes in my jon hamm phylum of handsome men
he looks like a kid
god the fly wire jerseys aka the toilet seat jerseys were completely ridiculous
that beautiful art patch
1 pixel per field goal hes made
harrision butker missed an extra point yesterday oh wait hes the best kicker in the league
if tucker retired tomorrowhof
still fucking got it
im about as wet as this picture and im a guy
hallowed be thy name
hes not an elite thrower of the football but hes solid and an elite talent with his legs is it because of the hype he garners is it his personality like why do people enjoy watching him struggle maybe its just because i get lost in the twitter comment section too much but man people can be straight aholes on there

for me only one thing matters hes fun to watch thats the whole point of football to entertain and jackson does that for me i wish i could drown out the haters of the world i would be a much happier person if i didnt go on twitter as much but i rely on it for football news

sorry for the early rant
pretty much every qb gets hated on flacco was a superbowl mvp and still got crap when you play at an extremely competitive level and people arent a fan of your team theyre going to nit pick
because they were wrong about him experts thought he should be a wr then he went to the ravens and shocked the football world becoming mvp in his 1st full season hes in the right organization and once he wins a sb hell get the respect he deserves
first twitter is a gigantic toilet bowl

second everyone hates successful people

third fuck everyone who hates on lamar
twitter hates everything while people black people cows cars gasoline women men lgbt those who dont like lgbt honesty dishonesty trump biden republicans democrats etc etc etc etc

i want to know why people care the social media world is one big hate fest right now and i choose to ignore it

if you think about it lamar is good people are scared of course they want him to fail they dont want to have to play him the same way we wanted brady and manning to lose
hes unapologetically black
im critical of him for sure i want him to be as great as he can potientially be
i  twitter two years ago and i dont regret it at all that shit has a terrible way of affecting your mood with all the bullshit thats on there delete it friend itll have a positive effect on you in more ways than you know
agree w everyone who says that twitter is trash if you want my opinion i think the flak primarily comes from 3 groups

1 racistshaters i think this is the smallest group might be naive of me so i will not spend any more time here

2 jealous teamsfanbases i think there are a lot of teams and fans of those teams who see lj and are frustrated with themselves for not being so forward looking as harbaughozziedecosta

3 people who want to see improvement you wrote that the point of football is entertainment so why are they giving lj so much grief i think that is partially true i think that you can get only so much entertainment from losing winning is much more entertaining lj has not been as good as he can be this year and its not unfair for fans and objective watchers to criticize his mistakes and expect better play

was he more entertaining this year or last year
everyone hates everyone mostly
they had a narrative around him in college coming in to the draft and they want that narrative to be right so bad

the other thing is just rivals taking smack to each other
this sub is just one giant circle
thats why i hate twitter every time i log on i leave pissed off
its several factors but a lot has to do with how hes pretty much the most unconventional quarterback weve ever seen and hes breaking the mold and no one can accept it
honest question why are people here so sensitive about it like theyre his girlfriend or something
i get that hes not an elite thrower yet but dude led the league in pass tds last year so put some respect on his throwing ability

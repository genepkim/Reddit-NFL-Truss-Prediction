ive been living outta pgh for for a few years so i miss the local radio and coverage of the team i cant find an updated 2020 version of here we go

anyone know if one has been done
i can give you a website to watch it on but not a radio version

were definitely the worst 90 team in the league right now


and the best


and the only baby

most hated overrated undefeated team in the league
steelers win the super bowl

the steelers are without doubt the worst sbwinning team ever
ive said this before and ill say it again for one last week 2013 chiefs started 90 ended 115 and lost in the wildcard round at indianapolis so no we are not the worst 90 team ever not even close
well someone has to be the worst but were still a 90 team so who cares weve never had a better start to a season and i for one just feel so proud and grateful i got to witness it
we havent beaten anybody good
this self loathing is getting a little out of hand are we a perfect team no but to pretend like were not elite or somehow weve been lucky is equally untrue
our season reminds me of peytons final super bowl win with the broncos great defenses can really carry a team
i havent been super into football that long but is this the worst our run game has been in recent years i feel like our offense is so horrendously one dimensional a team like the rams or colts could shut our offense down bad and win an ugly 1710 game i also dont know much though
im banned from the bengals sub and i dont feel like lurking but i wonder if theyre still insisting we only have played bad teams
im a chiefs fan and can confirm the 2013 chiefs are certainly the worst 90 team
by default we are the worst 90 teambecause we are the only 90 team ahahahah
damn i made the same meme in the discord last week but didnt post here all of that lost karma the hugh manatee

i cant wait until this meme says worst championship team
folks are just mad because we can win games without a strong run game ben can just throw all game defense is bend but dont break and were getting turnovers

as usual people are just hating to hate fuck them all tbh
i got a jar of dirt
the chiefs have had a worse schedule and they have a loss
worst undefeated team ever
theyre averaging 30 points a game while their opponents are averaging 19 against them
what really scares me is the idea that after we catch our first l were going to dissolve and lose all momentum especially if its to anyone other than the ravens or bills
they still missed danny marino in the draft
this is my favorite
i said this for 890 great minds think alike



edit correct numbers
in all seriousness i think theyre pretty good idk fans nitpick because no team is perfect but their record sure is
this is like every team in 2020
there is already enough nonsense in the press these days to answer such a amateurish take on a undefeated professional football team even for fun sometimes sports conversation for sake of conversation is idiotic given how many professional sports reporters and analyst there are go steelers

urinating tree yinzer intensifies
yasssssss perfect
stairway to seven baby
its hard to beat a good team its even harder to beat a good team thats having fun
this is fantastic
excellent
i wonder if thats true yall have had some squeakers

ok for inventing steel they sure dont know how to spell it
k bye
i didnt realize today was show and tell for primary school so i have nothing to share my bad
the earliest known production of steel is seen in pieces of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in anatolia kamankalehyk and are nearly 4000 years old dating from 1800 bc

the steelers were named in honour of sheffields industrial past much like the american football team of the same name based in pittsburgh pennsylvania the sharing of nicknames is merely a coincidence the american football team actually predates sheffields team by 58 years and was already popular worldwide due to their dominance in the national football league in the 1970s sheffield and pittsburgh are considered sister cities

but congrats on your first cup win or whatever
ok

this list says it was published today but its a week old thats weird
this is last weeks
the website doesnt even have records correct
steelers are the best team in the league until proven otherwise
seems pretty accurate id put the bills over ravens and saints though theyre looking very good also put tb at 10 titans and dolphins move up 1
removed

started fucking around with a new art program and liked how this turned out this year is too much fun so far gotta commemorate it

well footballwise
yo this is too dope hope to see an update next week

thank you for filling the hole troy left in my heart
its absolutely crazy how much he has helped our defense since last year happy bday minkah
that first pick could have been anything it could have been minkah fitzpatrick
damn i wish his birthday was tomorrow because mine is
one of the best i wouldnt say the best
removed

wait arent you guys 18 sure weve had some weird losses over the years but yall are terrible and havent done anything over the yearsso
please use this thread to post any trash talk about next weeks opponent some people from their sub may come here to do the same so please

do not downvote visitors for using this post correctly its a trash talk thread
guys lets take this one off
we sent in double agent josh dobbs but all he came back with was this video and this video of jaguars practice it was less than useful
the game isnt in pittsburgh we dont have a chance
theres a word in pittsburgh for this years jags team coincidentally that word is also jags jaggos jagoffs you know jags they play like jags they lose like jags and theyll probably trap game us just like a jag would do
you guys have a habit of losing to the jags under the spotlight as a jags fan fully embracing the magic of the draft please dont screw this up for us i want to see big ben tossing bombs all the way to our 1 pick 115

am i sleeping on the luton futon yeah im sleeping on the luton futon
you will respect the tank
i bet you guys only beat us by 10 points
i said it to myself all last year lamar sucks it was only a matter of time before the rest of the nfl figured out his schtick happened with vic happened when wild cat was supposedly the next big thing just be a running back already
one of my best friends back where i grew up is a jags fan and he was so jealous i got to see you guys lose to atlanta in person last year he is getting married to a steelers fan next summer and i was thinking about getting him a jersey which player on your dumpster fire team is worth buying a jersey of josh allen or should i wait for your next qb instead justin fields might break that ohio state bad qb streak
as a long time jag fan i can honestly say that beating the hell out of steelers in their house twice in one year and doing it twice are some of my fondest jag memories last time 2017we did it with blake bortles he kicked your butt yeh old memoriesim a jag fan
in 2020 thats what we have memories pathetic dont come here screw things up for us
you guys know the undefeated dream would be over if it was played in heinz field

but since its in tiaa enjoy helping our tank and your free win
if you guys somehow lose thatll be really embarassing for everyone involved
fred durst is from jacksonville
please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this weeks opponent including weaknesses strengths or info on lesserknown players you think will have an impact

if you are a fan of the opposing team feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above andor ask us about the steelers
tomlin should play the 2017 playoff game on a continuous loop in all the team facilities this week to make sure we dont overlook the jags yet again
hoping to see a cakewalk this week i know jacksonville has been one of bens demons for some time so would love to see us come out firing
it would be the jags coach 100th loss can we please help him with that milestone
theyre terrible and we are undefeated i expect this to go down to the wire
i think we finally should see two impressive performances in a row the steelers have tape on this rookie so he wont be an unknown threat and the jaguars defense will not have a good time stopping this passing attack but i want to see the oline start making lanes and giving connor some room to run this game if decastro cant do it put in dotson i dont care if hes a vet he needs to be able to run block
this game will go how our games against jacksonville usually go 1917 final
cant overlook this team luton is going to want to make a statement and they took green bay the distance

its another game that on paper we should handle easily but might end up looking more like the cowboys game ben typically clutches up jacksonville for whatever reason even all the way back to that ward gw catch
ive had jrob and chark on my ff team and watched more jags games than i ever want to again after this year my perspective is jrob is very good but hes allergic to the endzone this is largley due to the jags redzone playcalling being abysmal the jags will often find themselves down big by halftime and abandon the run completely or teams adjust to force luton to pass and hes just not that good chark is a beast but hes not qb proof they lost westbrook for the year and this hurt their wr depth keelan cole is a good special teams player but average wr in short their offense is really bad

a lot of people pointing to last weeks greenbay matchup being close as a concern greenbays defense is hot steaming trash if z smith isnt making plays theyve got nothing else jags also had a kick return td i will give the jags defense some due credit here the greenbay offense is good and they got a few stops on them to make it a game

overall im painfully aware of the jagssteelers history but this team isnt those teams im not concerned a lot of flukey stuff would need to happen for the jags to knock us off relax my dudes save some anxiety for thanksgiving
jacksonville is the real trap game
jags fan here i think you all win this week absolutely the question of how easily i think will just come down to both teams play calling your roster crushes ours in talent so i only think its close if say your offense overthinks and gets too run heavy our secondary is hot trash no way in hell we can cover juju claypool and dionte and on defense for yall i think taking away the deep ball will just make luton inevitably run into mistakes even if we have say an 8 play drive its only a matter of time before he ducks one for minkah to grab

i think last week is a bit of a mirage packers got too in their heads with playcalling and the wind really hampered both offenses after lutons first deep ball attempt got swatted by the wind he never really tried again
just please dont hurt any of our young guys

this season is a wash and were already down lambo

soon we rid the team of wash and marrone in a combo

so please go out there and beat our guys
i wouldnt be surprised if we played lax because we have a short week with the ravens coming up then on thanksgiving ideally we would get up big on them early so we can rest our starters but thats not the steelers way
jags fan i come in peace curious about the backfield situation in pittsburgh im the dynasty owner of mcfarland so id love to hear the insights that folks that follow the team have on the backfield my outsider view is that conner is the bellcow until the end of the year but going forwards mcfarland emerges as the clear 1 as the team moves on from conner no it just seems like hes been very inefficient and mcfarland moves real nice

or is it mostly the team kind of moving away from the run game because the offensive strength lies with the wrs more than the rbs and oline thanks for any answers
afc central

god hates the jags
they have more film on this qb than the cowboys backup hopefully thatll save us from the stress the dallas game gave us
well i dont know about you guys but im absolutely fucking terrified
i hate the steelers but i also hate my jags hoping for a tie
do we take a qb or rb in the first two rounds this year i dont know who is leaving this off season i just enjoy speculating about draft picks

oops wrong thread
flair check
mvp talks are around mahomes rodgers and murray why not big ben
it seems like if the idea is to have pockets of fans distanced from each other they could get a good 3040 more people in by opening the upper bowl and selling sociallydistanced clusters of seats up there

is there a reason theyre not doing this or a plan to start doing so
i think they are only allowed x number of people in the stadium and the fan amount fits in the lower area
thats also 3040 more people at the gate at the concession stands in the hallways and in the bathrooms
i think that the days of spectators at games are going to come to an end today
if things keep going the way theyve been theyre going to leave all the seats open

so deep fried i feel like im at the state fair

can i get it on a stick
2 lombardis 3 heismans
rival sub status check

ravens in shambles 50 in denial that lamar is not good 50 on suicide watch

browns starting to get cocky again being tied for 2nd place is the greatest thing that ever happened to cleveland just being set up for a return to the factory of sadness

bungles acceptance of cellar status fts its all about 2023
people consistently forget there are 4 heisman winning quarterbacks in the division that are all worse than one steely boi
i bathe in the bloothe
burrow legit

mayfield ehh meh ehh browns lol

lamar gimmicks up they know my play coach
in total in the total games ben was in there were two lombardis and 6 heismans pretty good if you ask me
i apologise in advance for the long post but please bear with me

firstly heres a bit of backstory

so ive been a fan of football for a while now and always had a soft spot for the steelers for no actual reason i guess i was just drawn to the team by fate

it wasnt until the 2018 season where i decided i should really double down and learn the sport inside out and become a proper fan i signed up for game pass and have watched the steelers ever since i guess its my fault that we missed the playoffs these past 2 seasons whoops i completely understand about 95 of what i watch on the field but still have those occasional whats happening here moments

the only issue ive had is that being from england the sport is usually looked down upon and you dont find people talking about it very often our main sport over here is association football sorry i cant bring myself to use the s word being a proud englishman so thats all anyone talks about here which makes it hard to properly get invested in gridiron football as theres such little exposure here other than places like reddit

ok so what is the actual point of my post well i want to finally double down and fully commit to the sport and make it as important to me as association football and my beloved arsenal i have the personal belief that you cant be a true fan of a sportteam unless you know your stuff and commit your time and heart to the sport and your team so my request is the following

what are the best sources of information for me to go indepth on the sport such as formations player positions rules the draft league standings etc so i fully understand the sport i have a hard time with certain things a few examples being what the role of a safety is why the play clock stops on certain plays but not on others why timeouts are used when they are and what the coaching roles are i want to completely iron out my knowledge of the sport to eventually know it inside and out

the same goes with the steelers i want to know the franchise inside and out i want to know more about the iconic players like joe greene and troy polamalu and generally want a good knowledge of the history of the franchise i feel proud of arsenal because im fully invested in them but with the steelers whilst i get the proud feeling its obviously not as strong because my support is only in its infancy a great example being with us going 90 so far where if i was fully invested itd be the best feeling in the world but im not getting the full pride feeling just yet i have trouble with how many players there are and only really find myself rememberingnoticing the ones in the spotlight such as watt ben juju claypool conner johnson dupree etc whereas the players in positions that do their job without the credit they deserve are completely lost on me because of the sheer size of the squad

that being said what are some good sources of information regarding the history of the franchise these iconic players the current squad and also are there any good forms of media like steelers podcasts and consistent video releases on youtube thatll immerse me in the squad and help me get a good understanding of everything im completely aware that i can just google and youtube most of these things but i was hoping that people would know of some gems of information or something similar that might help me more than a lot of the stuff ive already found and not found too helpful from a regular google search

once again sorry for the essay but i thought that if you understood my position youd find it easier to help me
lesson 1 never put the words new england and fan together in a post title here unless theyre followed by the phrase coming in shame
you absolutely have to watch with others to learn the sport you can do it academically but its going to have a disconnect between what is read and what is on display the majority of us learned watching football with our parents and friends asking questions the same way im sure most europeans learned uhfootball we live in a world of online voice and video chat i bet if you asked theres tons of fans who would hop in a voicevid chat and watch with you answering questions and explaining what happened
nice try belichick go back to your subway sandwich commercials thanks for beating the ravens though
weve had 3 head coaches all great since 1969 we were never a good team before that but the late 60s is the start of the super bowl era which most people in the league use to describe the modern nfl

im not sure exactly which resources to use to learn but you can easily divide our history into the chuck noll bill cowher and mike tomlin eras to help break it up into more manageable chunks

if there are youtube videos detailing their careers thats probably a good place to start
another brit steeler here feel free to msg me if youve got any other questions mate
a brief history lesson

the thing to start with the steelers is the ownership art rooney founded the steelers in 1933 and his family has owned a majority stake in the steelers ever since they are widely considered to be some of the best owners in all of sports not just the nfl theyve proven to have a commitment to their players as much as winning they helped engineer what is called the rooney rule for hiring coaches which requires teams to interview at least one minority candidate before hiring the rule have its flaws but has largely been a step in the right direction

the steelers were absolute dogshit for their first 40 years of existence like lions or browns bad we dont like to talk about it by the time the 60s came around the nfl was dealing with a major competitor in the afl the two eventually agreed to merge leagues in 1966 and the merger was finalized in 1970 the first nflafl championship in 1967 was retroactively referred to as super bowl i this is largely considered to be the birth of the modern nfl and referred to as the super bowl era for which most nfl records stand

meanwhile the steelers hired chuck noll to be their head coach in 1969 nolls first draft pick was mean joe greene who is widely considered not just one of the best defensive tackles of all time but also one of the best defenders of all time they were still bad for the first couple seasons earning the 1 pick in the 1970 draft they took qb terry bradshaw who finally led them to the playoffs in 1972 the steelers would win their first ever playoff game i told you they were terrible off of one of the most miraculous plays youll ever see known as the immaculate reception

in 1974 the steelers had what is still known as the greatest draft class of all time and its not particularly close they drafted future hall of famers wr lynn swann lb jack lambert wr john stallworth and c mike webster and signed a fifth future hall of famer in s donnie shell after he went undrafted that draft class would help the steelers win their first super bowl as rookies in 1974 kicking off a stillunmatched run of 4 super bowl victories in 6 seasons

those teams were defined primarily by what would become known as the steel curtain defense a play on winston churchills iron curtain speech during the cold war originally the steel curtain referred to just the defensive line but would eventually apply to the defense as a whole greene lambert olb jack hamm and cb mel blount are all in the conversation as the best players at their positions of all time

in 1978 the nfl implemented new rules that defenses could not make contact with a receiver beyond 5 yards from the line of scrimmage this is typically what we call pass interference andor defensive holding today this is known as the mel blount rule and was quite specifically created to curb the steelers defensive dominance the only thing it managed to do however was awaken the steelers offense bradshaw who had faced multiple benchings in his career and up until this point been seen as a dont screw it up or game manager type qb won the nfl mvp in 1978 and super bowl mvps in both 1978 and 1979

anyway that covers the glory days for the most part i wasnt alive then but i love reading about them i would encourage you to watch the americas game docuseries which covers super bowl winning teams in depth it gives an excellent view of the playerscoaches of the teams and is great for learning football history i still tear up anytime i watch the 2005 steelers one
behind the steel curtain is a website dedicated to steelers news and analysis they have a series of articles updated weekly that is called film room nothing has been so instrumental in growing my understanding of the intricacies of the as those breakdowns of film during the season they break down the previous game during the offseason they do more general explanations of positions personnel groupings and nuances of our scheme my favorite time is from february to april where draft prospects are evaluated as well here is the link to their film room articles but other main page pieces are worth time too
even though ive been around football my whole life there are still aspects of the game im just now discovering for indepth commentary and film analysis i like watching youtubers like jackson krueger sports or brett kollmann i would say timeouts are mostly saved toward the end of the half to be used to stop the clock they are also mostly used before a big 4th down or goal line play the safety has no sigular role it just depends on the defensive set safetys are just taught to be deeper down the field than the deepest receiver
i feel your pain and successes when the nhl went into lockout i started watching the premier league english football was frustrating to me for a good while but after watching it a ton i learned to not just enjoy it but to love it

in regards to your two bigger questions

1 for the rules heres the simplest one i found dont worry about the penalty stuff you understand the basics and the finer points will get easier to get
2 for steeler history i liked this write up

also dont worry a ton about knowing all the players just follow the starting 11 on offense and the 11 on d and youll be fine if you try to remember the infinite subs per game youll just go crosseyed again youll learn to love 75 of the roster over time through watching the games

just remember as a steelers fan the browns suck and are to be pitied no empathy though just pity as they suck and have sucked for a long long time imagine an english team getting a new superstar 9 year after year the expectation that this is the guy only to have them score 1 to 2 goals a year then get cut and another superstar 9 is signed rinse and repeat the ravens are to be hated the city sucks the fans suck and they also had a player that may have actually killed a guy finally always refer to the cincinnati team as the bungles this is what they do and who they are
theres more uk nfl fans than you think thousands in fact
fellow london based steeler fan here have been following since around 2002 when we had tommy maddox at qb and the bus at rb i chose the steelers because of the bus and how he used to run people over and ive stayed up so many late nights watching games on tv until like 3 in the morning i loved it when the international game pass came out so i could watch every game not just the two that were selected for uk tv

in 2017 i drove around pretty much the whole usa in a camper van and along the way stopped in steeler bars all around the country to watch games i still facebook chat with a few steeler fans that i met it ended with a trip to heinz field with my then fiance now wife for a stadium tour and the ravens game right after shazier went down one of the best days of my life think it was 3938 steelers check out my post history for the final score selfie

i found two things that helped me learn the game

one was as others have said watching with others that know the game and discussing it with them the great thing about the stopstart nature of the game is that the commentators give pretty good analysis post play and you pick up loads that way

the second thing i did was play loads of madden on ps2 back then playing the game like that helps you work out a lot of the smaller strategic things around play clocks and timeouts it also lets you learn the rosters at one point i think i knew almost every starter in the league let along the steelers although madden isnt not perfect of course and not everyone has time for it

hit me up the next time the steelers come to wembley im still looking for revenge after that terrible vikings defeat in 2013
while i would love to type you a wall of text answer your questions and fulfill your dreams thatd probably get boring for you quickly although youre welcome to streamwatch a game with me sometime and ill fill you in if you want i watch on gamepass as well from peru

youtube is getting more content lately there are channels that do nfl film study and can break down formations and such

if you want to know more about steelers players theres arthur moats channel where he breaks down individual performances as well as game discussion about critical moments that can help you understand some things better bud brought a buddy is good too bud dupree and another player talk about stuff

maybe ill just make an nfl rules channel to teach people how the game works and spread the gospel
also a uk steelers fan for more coverage of the sport sky has a dedicated nfl channel you can watch through now tv too and it will show highlights from all the weeks games along with some of the us and uk paneltalk shows watching this will help you a lot
fellow british steelers fan here

for a deeper understanding of the game id recommend you read take your eye off the ball 20 by pat kirwan an exceptional book which breaks down positions and formations and so much more

i watch every steelers game live but to keep up with the rest of the season i listen to the head on a swivel podcast imo its the best of the british nfl podcasts
to learn the history you absolutely must watch the 6 americas game episodes they are done about the superbowl winner every year then maybe see what you can find on the team website and on youtube also read about the steelers that made the hall of fame for more information on our stars including insight on our few bright spots before the super bowl era and chuck noll as for learning more about the inner workings of the game i recommend watching with someone more knowledgeable if possible see if theres a uk steelers facebook group and possibly go out to a bar with american tv and watch together
i understand how you feel with me being a western pennsylvania born and raised steelers fan who became an obsessed liverpool fc supporter in 2017
to answer your what does a safety do question heres how i think of it safeties are the defensive backs that typically line up and defend in the middle of the secondary there are two types of safeties the free safety and the strong safety generally speaking strong safeties ss are bigger and stronger than the free safetiesfs ss are more likely to be better at tackling and run stopping fs are more likely to be faster and better in pass coverage to clumsily make a sccer comparison if the nfl cornerbacks are the equivalent of an epl lbrbs the ss is like a cbcdm and a fs is like a sweeper

in short a ss is the hammer of the defensive backfield and the fs is the ballhawk of the dbs
theres lots of good advice here so ill just tag a few extra thoughts

1 very few fans actually understand what all 22 players on the field are trying to do all the time most people are just watching for the skill positions to make big plays that said i think most experienced fans do have a general understanding by position group roughly you can think of these groups as offensive line qb rbs and receivers on offense and defensive line linebackers and secondary on defense youll find that in the modern game these lines get blurry quickly rbs frequently play as receivers safeties sometimes play like a linebacker etc but in broad strokes this will help a lot with understanding the basic mechanics of the game

2 its worth googling around about basic formations and personnel groups this can be thought of as whos in the game where are they lined up and why again this gets pretty complicated in the modern game but its helpful to know the basics its much easier to read offenses for instance an empty set means you have 5 receivers on the field with no rbs which almost always indicates a passing play a heavy set conversely usually has at least 2 rbs and 2 tight ends meaning were almost guaranteed to power run defense is much harder to read and you have to pay more attention to who is in the game you frequently see lbs replaced with cbs and vice versa but the shape of the defense is usually pretty amorphous

3 this may sound silly but for basic formations and strategy i would actually really recommend playing madden you have to pick the plays which means you have to analyze things like personnel groupings down and distance and clock management theres also tutorials that help to illustrate these concepts for noobs obviously video games arent real life but i think its a great teaching tool

4 rulesugh football is hands down the hardest game to understand from a rules perspective theres a lot of them and they dont always make sense different rules apply in different contexts all the time i think another brit in the thread recommended a book for basicsbest i can offer without a buddy to watch with is googling things when you see a call you dont understand tread very warily thoughtheres honestly a lot of fans who dont really understand some of the rules theres also a lot of rules that have gray areas of interpretation pass interference is easily at the top of that list you see a lot of homer bias when you watch a game with friends when in doubt theres always the rule book lol

5 clock management is very important to understand especially for late game drama thats mostly where timeouts come into play because a timeout stops the clock if you ever see a timeout outside of the last few minutes of the half its likely because theres just something screwed up and the team needs to reset for instance a miscommunication on the play call or lining up and seeing the opposition in a set they dont like you can google around for clock management but the critical stuff to know is what stops the clock running out of bounds as long as the player is moving forward too an incomplete pass hence spiking or clocking the ball a timeout or a 2 minute warning

i would recommend continuing to post specific questions here too im sure youll quickly become our token british friend and people will give lots of helpful information honestly because of the complexities of the game i almost always learn something new in rules threads or analysis threads and ive been watching my whole life and played all through my childhood and high school days the game is complex and constantly changing
hell man im american and have been watching football my whole life and still dont understand what is happening on the field about 30 of the time
nice article about the franchises leadership in the hiring process and some notes about what makes coach t special from peter kings weekly column


link
great read
thanks for the article

at this point hes just trolling all of yall that take this so seriously
what i like about our team this year is how cohesive we are and we arent necessarily fantastic in one area but just work extremely well as a team all the parts fit
being in 2nd place is not an insult when the 1 team is the defending champs are only a game back and have the best qb in the league chiefs are the only team that potentially scare me i think its reasonable to put them ahead any lower than 2 is dumb though given how up and down most of the other top teams have been
1 i dont think you should care too much about power rankings theyre just convenient exercises for websites to create content
2 he definitely does not say that a 90 team should be 1 he says he understands the gripe that steelers fans have with not being 1 and that typically they would be 1 but that he doesnt think they should be because mahomes tips the scales
allow me to say i dont take nfl power rankings as the end all be all thats who wins the chip i just find it annoying that people continue to devalue the steelers and praise the chiefs when both teams are playing at a ridiculously high level

edit grammar
i mean the chiefs are a good team but i think the steelers have them beat as an overall team the chiefs offense is better but the steelers have a way better defense which to me travels better plays better in big games and wins championships so i think the steelers are the better team in that respect

lol wasnt he the guy that blocked him from celebrating on the star too
removed
no
he sucked complete ass last year

no
no
im giving you a chance to say this was a jokeit was a joke right
he was not found innocent the accusers lawyers tried to extort him and the case was dropped
we have an absolutely great mix right now of top shelf starters and subpackage specialists who have been playing together for a while and work together seamlessly behind them weve got a nice stable of promising young developmental players we dont want to push down the depth chart for no discernable reason

this seems like a really terrible idea
i remember him being on the draft board and hes still young but he was absolutely atrocious last year with the giants the giants kind of just threw him in there sink or swim style and he got roasted and taken advantage real good pretty much on every play hes a project at best a project with baggage

oh man so this is the hill we die on to lose to jax
everyone seems to think its conner thats the problem i just dont see it he looks like the same guy to me who ran effectively just a couple of years ago i think its the line not blocking particularly well in the run game and the play calling is whack conner is a down hill runner and we almost always try to have him hit the edge its completely bizarre
hey reddit we did it
fun fact from brian batkos chat yesterday we had a 100 yard rusher in all 3 games dotson played and have only had 2 100 games without him in the lineup not saying he should start but maybe he should start
lets get it
good get fichtner canada and sarrett in the lab and figure out a way to get some movement up front and then tell conner to focus on getting northsouth as quickly as possible i think some special attention to the offensive line is warranted and could pay huge dividends for the whole offense
stop treating conner like a bellcow and itll immediately improve
my main beef with conner is that everyone thinks he is a power back but hes really not

if you watch him i think hes too indecisive he stutter steps at the line too much and thats why hes stuffed more often than not

just my opinion not a big fan of his although i still think hes the best option we have
starts with mcfarland getting 20 touches and snell getting 15 connor time to get on to your lifes work next plug doctson in at lg so you can pull

the three sisters very nice idea

edit to add i wonder how well a defensive line of rachel carson andy warhol and roberto clemente would stop the jags
that jaguars spots look like hes got the nervous sweats not that i blame him
ah yes the jaguars natural enemy suspension bridges

been waiting for this all week
that jaguar is so adorable he looks like my cat when i get the vacuum out
smiley little bridge posts
heres a silver for putting smiley faces on the bridges
jaguars cant melt steel beams
three rivers not bridges
killed it
i know a lot of people said we brought him in just for depth but is there any chance he gets more snaps as he becomes more familiar with the system spillane and vince have been fine over the past couple of weeks but we really havent had to play a team in that span where their lack of sidelinetosideline speed was a factor a majority of the afc teams set to be in the playoffs have stud rbs so im curious if the plan is for him to takeover the job as we get closer to the post season
i wish they would im really not a fan of watt being in coverage so much and williamson would help that the defense looks so much better when watt is rushing
i was under the impression that we brought him in because with bush out we dont have a good coverage linebacker im sure its not an easy system to immediately pick up
i definitely think theres a good chance he gets more and more snaps potentially for both vince and spillane as the season goes on hes not an athletic freak but he definitely brings more speed and agility to the table than vince and spillane do and hes still a damn good run defender

id bet by december vince and williamson are taking more snaps than spillane but that spillane will still have some kind of a role
obviously it comes down to him vs spillane spillane seems to be struggling shredding blocks so unless he loses the job to avery then avery will be depth he did look good in the limited snaps he got tho
if spillane keeps up his play williamson will probably only see snaps to give a player a brake mid game hes basically just realllllly good depth at the moment we may try to resign him for cheap if we decide vince is a cap casualty
spillane and vince have been fine over the past couple of weeks

if it aint broke dont fix it

we really havent had to play a team in that span where their lack of sidelinetosideline speed was a factor

like baltimore with lamar jackson
i came over via the links from the mod on rjaguars had me thinking about how im excited for this week if only to hear the boys talk about my team all week lol just wondering if you guys watchlike those guy
pats a yinzer
yessir aaron rodgers tuesday right now
the c gap will live forever if you havent seen the troy polomalu story yet for the love of god watch it
troy polomalu is an asshole for ruining that poor local kids dreams of scoring a td in pittsburgh justice for pat
thought i was in the wrestling sub for a second hes a charming guy for sure
i used to love the pat mcafee show it was a regular listen to me but i kinda lost interest pats all about himself and i find those personalities insufferable
ive been to kraynaks in sharon pa a few times but im not from pennsylvania and i remember them having quite a few steelers decorated trees that were for sale at the time i was a few years younger but as im currently in college im toying with the idea of getting a fake tree that is black and yellow i dont know that im completely sold on buying one right now but im at least interested and was wondering if anyone knew of a website that i could use to find one
sorry i cant help with your question but i can say this if you want an authentic pittsburgh christmas tree just take a regular christmas tree and top it with freshcut french fries and coleslaw
pretty simple question

btw just a side compliment too our wide receiver group is playing amazing and they are all still super young none are veteran pros yet just shows how unselfish they are with each other
no
it all depends on what happens with the cap really but theres a lot of expiring deals after the 2021 season so those high cap numbers could be lowered with extensions but the likely answer isno mainly because guys like minkah juju and tj need to get extensions over guys like joe haden av or conner
no

they have 201m in cap space committed to 34 players for next year the cap is likely to decrease from where it is this year so youre talking about probably being 10m over the cap with 19 players short of a full roster before you sign a single player a roethlisberger extension might be able to get you as much as 14m in extra space best case scenario

so likely best case you have 4m in space with 39 players on the roster and all of the following going to ufa

dupree

conner

alualu

juju

av

feiler

hilton

sutton

plus a bunch of other players theyll be lucky to sign 1 or 2 of those guys
if everyone takes minimum deals and we release any non needed cap hitslike feiler imo dotson has performed more than well enough so in short no
no
i know everyone loves juju myself included but hes not nearly as important to resign as some of the other players we are absolutely stacked at receiver juju is a luxury to be honest if it comes down to him getting signed vs some of the guys on defense that would be hard to replace like hilton etc then i would hope that kevin colbert lets him walk with that being said i think that juju loves it here and will work with the team to do a contract that makes sense for everyone well see hopefully we win our 7th lombardi trophy this season and its not as big of a worry
nope especially not since juju has reemerged and dupree is just as good if not better than last year
no

there are simply too many big names performing at very high levels right now

i guess if ben retired maybe
nope

lmao as an ohio u alumni this one hurts but is so laughably true

we dont rearrange practice for 1 player and dates of that nature
just saw this as well
nice try ben but the standard is the standard
this tells me both ben and tomlin are very happy with life right now and that makes me happy
i love tomlin with all my heart man just has a way with words
i love reading tomlin quotes because i can hear them in my head as his voice and cadence
i need a mike tomlin quote compilation in my life and put it on pornhub
what is this subs opinion of aditi

she is the goto for all the major outlets but when i hear what she says it seems like a lot of technical verbiage with no real meaning for example today she is talking about the steelers needing to stop with the finese in the run game and start using the power run game since it is what conner is best at now that makes sense his ypa on counter and power plays have been best but power is an outside run that i would consider finese compared to i formation draws and inside zones

also tomlin seems to breeze through her questions a little faster then others not trying to give her any significant banter or any hemming and hawing
hopefully mason makes the most of those extra practice reps
get back in the kitchen benjamin

tomlin
i mean bens is a mac conference qb and we all know how tomlin feels about the mac


i love coach

weve got 90 wins
900


this is just the beginning
every sunday i wake up to get impressed by watts resilience and jujus clutch playsmy favorite players
so who wears no 100
i just remember it looked really cool and ebron was smiling in it i want to use it as a background
the steelers usually publish the photos taken on their website check there first as it was probably taken by the team photographer karl roser
removed

he had a career game on sunday honestly
ok but chris boswell tho
just make him sit out 6 games every year he was also pretty good last year till about the last month
rumors of his demise were greatly exaggerated
youre forgetting what jordan berry played like in 2019 through 34 of the season he was having by far his best year

then the bills game happened and we pretty much lost directly due to his shanks and he continued to be horrendous down the stretch
2019 opm needs hair
does this make berry one punt man

ill see myself out
if i had to guess last year berry was forced to punt so much that his leg was dead by the end of season know mcafee has said that fatigue as the season drags on is a very real thing for punters
he knows his job is constantly at risk so he has to do better
is it just me or is his punting motion kinda cool to watch like it feels like me moves less after contact
he trained so hard all his hair fell out
from espns story on the upcoming jags game

roethlisberger joked after throwing for 333 yards and four touchdowns against the cincinnati bengals that he might talk with tomlin about taking another week off practice

but no such luck

we did have that conversation tomlin said tuesday ill acknowledge it was a very brief one and i will see him at practice on thursday
i laughed and laughed at that does anyone else hear his voice in their head when reading his quotes
ive realized that ben has made a suggestion but given that its a stupid ass suggestion ive chosen to ignore it mike tomlin probably

hes old now better trade him think we can get darnold this offseason s

bullshit is what is
put us below the jets for all i care
garbage
who cares not only is it rnfl but its the 1 loss defending super bowl champs
honestly the chiefs look just ok they let the panthers convert all three of their fourth down attempts last week
i dont care about where were ranked but this is just obnoxious

seen it a lot not new to football at all so kinda embarrassed to ask but wtf is epa
if you can read this points to you
this might be easier to read if you did it by game and not by play
all i can tell is that alex smith is really helping the football team

comeback player of the year lol the inconsistency seems to be gone knock on wood just the bombs he used to produce just half the time plus pinning at the 10 pretty consistently
with berry back we now have a stable and reliable punter that can boot it down the field i am glad we have him back as our punter this is week 2 of my appreciation and underated players comment who do you think is underated or unappreciated
dude is absolutely dropping bombs out there love seeing it
we just ignoring the 29 yard punt with 235 left in the 4th quarter because it didnt matter
removed
no there are 9 teams in the afc with 3 or fewer losses
mathematically speaking no

practically speaking yes

given that were 90 heading into an expanded playoffgiven that weve got incredible talent and depth all over the field to hedge against injurygiven that even with a complete and utter lack of talent at the most important position on the field last year we still managed 500 ball and have the same veteran leadership in place on the sideline and on the field

given all that the likelihood we dont take part in the playoffs is greater from covid from large scale natural disaster or from thermonuclear armageddon than it is from results on the field
no

supposing the steelers shit the bed and go 97 the only teams that cant catch them right now are the jags texans and jets the rest of the teams in the afc have a chance to tie or exceed that number

that leaves 12 other teams for 7 playoff spots if the steelers win this week that guarantees 106 and eliminates the bengals and chargers and maybe a few others based on results from catching them so were down to 10 other teams

going 115 and the broncos cant catch them

124 and were over the patriots

133 and were in the playoffs

of course thats supposing all the other teams win out which is nonsense

im guessing realistically were going to be in around our 11th win
youd have seen 17383738 steelers have clinched a playoff berth threads instead of all the 90 spam
removed
like half the afc is 63 it will be a few more weeks to clinch as they even out a bit
right now if you lose more than 3 games youre out of the playoffs in the afc theres still 7 games left so got a ways to go yet
no
i think the soonest we can clinch is week 11
the post just before this asked the same question mods delete spam like this
no they can technically still miss if they beat the ravens they clinch both the playoffs and the division tho

ik it was before he got signed but if teams are talking to you why the frick would you cause problems
opinion

dupree no we should not resign him even though hes been good a number of years some of his stats have been padded by having an overall great d line i think its pretty clear we drafted highsmith to replace him dupree is going to get paid way above his skill level next year

connor no even though hes a pittsburgh guy hes not special in any way

mike hilton no even though other than joe haden he is our best cb he will be asking for way too much he is currently averaging 32 million a year with his current contract i think we can continue developing younger cb like marcus allen to replace him with hilton being injured weve shown we can play fine without him

sutton yes resign him going into the future i can really see sutton becoming the veteran to hold down the secondary if anything happens to haden overall seems like a really athletic smart leader

tj watt you have to pay watt hes the heart of this defense and is so versatile

juju this is a tough one i really think it comes down to how much juju will be asking for he makes so much money off of cereal and just being an internet celebrity and nfl ambassador he may be perfect happy with a small contract steelers really dont need to pay him hes just a great teammate

hopefully i didnt get anything wrong or say anything too controversial
juju has proven to be the most reliable receiver on the team and bens go to guy in the big moments they need to find a way to resign him
we better pay juju that man deserves it took on a leadership role at the age of 23 the core of our wr group i respect your opinions though i just feel juju should get his money and it most definitely should be from the steelers man i hope they pull it off
dont wanna be a dick but this list is terribly wrong lol
i think thats some disrespect towards dupree whether or not its by us the dude deserves to get paid
why would you pay watt we have his 5th year option still
weve got to sign juju even with our op ass receiving corps hes our most talented guy we have a diverse and dangerous wr room we need to try and hang on to that for as long as possible with conner dupree and hilton gone i have 100 faith that kc will find the room to sign everybody else hes a magic man
i think juju is a no hes looking good this year and will want to and should get paid hes not good enough to invest in long term though
for those curious



player of bens tds

antonio brown 72
heath miller 41
hines ward 41
mike wallace 29
santonio holmes 17
juju smithschuster 16
martavis bryant 14
jerrico cotchery 12
emmanuel sanders 11
nate washington 11
jesse james 9
chase claypool 7

chase is tied with leveon bell markus wheaton and matt spaeth
jesse james should have 10
anyone else look at ab all the way up there and get sad i know this conversation has been said a million times but i miss the player ab used to be all but a hall of fame lock and he threw it away
wow didnt realize that lb only caught 7 tds from ben
i do not remember seeing cotchery get 12 next youll tell me lance moore had 6
ben and ab were magical rip
i forgot all about mike wallace whatever happened to that guy
jerricho cotchery was a fucking stud man wish he was here longer instead of with new york
you now remember jerrico cotchery
surprised sanders isnt higher in my mind we had him for a while maybe not
my biggest takeaway from this is that spaeth and bell had the same number of receiving tds from ben that feels impossible
only two on the list were 1st round picks impressive
would have thought holmes higher
plaxico burgess and his 23 tds are missing from this list not sure if i want to claim this but we graduated from the same high school him almost ten years later
coates didnt make the list

i knew gilbert was gonna be an issue for us because we had literally no film on him to study had dalton started for dallas i dont think the game wouldve been as close weve got a few weeks of film on luton so i expect the defense to get it done hopefully our offense doesnt take 40 minutes to show up this time
im a pittsburgh native living in jacksonville my son will be born this friday he will be wrapped in a terrible towel we will not lose his first game as a fan
me shakes ativan bottle pills rattle inside

me whew that was close
hey at least when we lose we have the excuse that we always lose to them
the steelers are 90 and on a roll its not like they play down to their competition ok maybe we are in danger
nah dont worry we only have home field advantage at heinz field our stadium is usually 60 opposing fans
big ben has the fire this season this isnt our year to play down to our opposition

ive got faith

ive got faith

ive got faith
something something admiral ackbar something something trap
10 and 0 take the steelers and give the points
tbh ive always thought taking a loss during the season is good gets rid of the perfect season pressure
any chance we can trick a jacksonville player into like shining his shoes with the terrible towel and posting it on twitter because dang did that work against the bungles
trap game im not taking anything for granted
im feeling a weird 127 victory
the worrywart in me is screaming regression to the mean
theyve had chances to lose to crap teams this year and didnt do it 100 theyll lose to either baltimore or buffalo and drop another when theyre resting players after everything has been clinched
facts right here ugh
i was at the 309 loss at heinz fieldi feel this on a spiritual level
we are not already thinking about the ravens
on the road against a bad team is where steelering gets turned up to maximum overdrive
at jaguars has always been a trap game must be the humidity
i feel this so much for some reason jacksonville always has our number
i havent been watching this season but this i completely understand funny as hell
theyre gonna force us to wear black arent they
dont do it dont get cocky
last i checked they are dead last in pass defense i was more concerned with the bungles than i am with the jags i think well be fine
when the schedule came i circled this game as the trap if we pull it off and if we beat the ravens bills and bengals in the next weeks do we tank the cleveland game if we have playoffs sealed up why not rest starters it might be a mustwin for browns and it would mean ravens would most likely get left out hmmm
they dont have ramsey anymore we good ramsey is bens kryptonite
does anyone else feel like we play down against seemingly worse opponents then when we play against better opponents we go all out
i fully expect the entire first quarter to be vintage randy fichtner run run screen punt

tldr tj good
he gets a couple more sacks and how can anyone argue he isnt the dpoy
he has the least pass rush snaps of all the top guys and almost as many sacks has a pick so many qb hits and pressures this dude should be a dpoy with little argument
if he gets a couple more sacks sunday theres really only one other guy he has to fight with to be considered 1st and thats jc jackson dudes got 6 picks already this year
i know there is way too much to play out but i think there are some creative things the team can do with the cap besides restructuring heyward or ben i am wonder what else you all think we could do to make some necessary room

my curveball idea force retire pouncey like we did troy he is vastly underperforming his contract that will open up enough space for 1 more player
possible extensions that lower cap hits ben haden pouncey decastro nelson ebron vince tj could sign him to a megadeal and push all the money down the line similar to how chiefs did with jones

possible restructures tuitt heyward

possible cuts haden 7m pouncey 8m nelson 825m decastro 875m ebron 6m mcdonald 52m v williams 4m

if its up to me id extend ben nelson ebron and tj to make their cap hits as low as possible hard to tell exactly what that would look like restructure tuitt and heyward cut mcdonald and vince last big decision would come down to pouncey vs decastro idk if its injuries or age or what but their run blocking is not cutting it this season and one of them has to go so that we can use the money to keep villanueva then go after iol early in the draft
i appreciate you trying to come up with ideas but pouncey isnt going anywhere
you can create 13m max with a ben extension and 7m with a heyward restructure you could also get 4m with a tuitt restructure

forcing pouncey to retire is the same as cutting him either way its 65m in dead money and 8m in savings of course if you do that youve just royally pissed off your qb and now you dont have anyone to play center

if they really want to go all in with this core they can create some more money with really backloaded extensions haden and nelson could net you max 4m for either of them on an extension

you can pick one of haden or nelson and extend them that could net you at most 4m in cap space watt could get you as much as 7m decastro as much as 6m
if pouncey leaves so would ben
we dont even know what the cap is going to be yet and its likely going down next year but the question is how much thats going to make the cap gymnastics really fun next year
on the plus side at least pouncys snapping issues from last year have not carried over to the current season
when a player retires all remaining dead money accelerates to that year he has one year left might as well keep him unless you think you have 2 centers on the roster who are better than him and its worth eating 11 million to prove it
since you cant push the 5th year option on tj we are on the hook for 10m if he remains on the roster in 2021 which he obviously will be so for all the people saying extend him it does nothing for us next season

extend ben first because his 40m cap hit next year is killing our cap if anyone can take a team friendly deal it is ben he has made around 200m in his career and doing so gives him the chance to keep winning

cut vance if he doesnt take a big pay cut extend vince and spread his 7m next year take a hard look at pouncey haden nelson and even decastros contracts to push money into the future let some of our fas walk this might mean a few people out of al hilton sutton and feiler are gone im pretty sure juju is a steeler next year same with alualu
if ben retires how would that effect his cap hit
dont you put that evil on me
cut candidates deadsavings

vance 27m52m or ebron 25m6m my guess is vance
rudolph 233k1m
samuels 64k920k
mondeux 0780k
james pierre 6k777k

not a ton of cap can be created here but there are some bottom of the depth chart guys that create some space

restructures

tuitt
heyward risky since hell be 35 at the end of his current contract and hell have a huge cap hit
nelson

extensions to lower 2021 cap hit

ben probably unlikely
decastro
haden probably unlikely
pouncey only if ben is extended
watt will be on 5th year option almost guaranteed to happen

that might be enough to resign the guys we want to but itll be tough
well i think 64m in dead cap is better then 145m in a seriously regressing player that 8m would be enough for squeeze out juju or bud or 2 of alualu hilton sutton ebron
i havent heard anything yet concerning the color rush jerseys anybody
thats what i was assuming
they didnt release a jersey schedule this year but thanksgiving seems like the logical spot for color rush
dont careall i want is a winand another and anotherandanotherandanother
they will probably announce after the jags game if thats the game for them ben is undefeated in them so that would be nice
are they doing the throwbacks at all this year damn those would hype me up on thanksgiving
forget color rush i miss the bumble bees
i cant see how we dont wear them
i like the color rush and thanksgiving thursday night against the ravens makes logical sense but if we are 100 going into that game my superstitious self doesnt want a jersey change change nothing opt out of color rush and take the punishment
please those are my favorite jerseys and i will be at the game

i feel very good about our chances this team can beat anyone my biggest worry is that we go undefeated during the regular season and lose in the playoffs if i had my choice i would like to see them blow up for one game towards the end of the season get the bye in the playoffsif we have a bye at allrefocus and take another lombardi home

i mean yeahthe ultimate would be the first team to go undefeated since the 1972 dolphinsbut that seems so out of reach there were many really good teams that have tried to do that since 72
this is a weird season for the offense it just feels like they arent playing very well but here they are putting up 24 points every week and averaging 30
is there some way we can delete the steelers 2019 season from all stats and records just put na or something
i think this contributes to case big ben has for mvp this year 500 team last year to 90 this year just with ben back
is that stat adjusted with those three red zone trips at the end of games they knelt
what would bens stat line look like if he went up against this years steeler defense the offense is exactly the same also
considering the team practices together all the time and knows each others tendencies id wager it would be garbage our dline would eat out oline for breakfast
a football game doesnt work like that

both the offenses and defenses approaches will depend a lot on the flow of the game and to even have a guess at that you need to know whos playing offense and defense for both sides

in a vacuum i think the defense is the stronger unit fwiw
i think ben would fare well with the quick passing game as it would neutralize the pass rush that being said we cover short pass route fairly well with our team d it would be a fun match up for sure

best in the game

looks like he might have been able to get to the outside great run back either way
ray ray was a great findi am glad he is on our team
the field always look so much shorter from this angle lol
i wouldve won 425 if he stayed on the outside
dude you must have been sitting right behind me that looks almost exactly like what my pov was
shouldve juked the kicker inside than run down the sideline
i know hes not a big guy but he should have tried to just run over the kicker lol i really think he might have scored if he did
im so fkin happy we dont have a guy just signaling fair catch back there anymore
so those cardboard cutouts of peopledo they get in the way of the field when seated i have been curious about thisso expensive to go and at least one benefit would be a great view without obstruction only to get there and have cardboard block it would be beyond frustrating
dude i fuckin love this dude i also love you for these videos please continue going to every game that you can and post these lmao
where can i find more videos like this i havent been to a steelers game since hines was only with us for a year or two i love to see video from the stands and want to watch more
thats 2 times this year he wouldve had a touchdown if he stayed outside
i miss the packed stadiums so so much


that chief story was gold love the pmac show
skip to 155 if you want to get right to it
did he bring up the c gap again

super cool better find a good place for it
damn thats awesome
awesome

its because they are the defending super bowl champions and have a former mvp qb whos in the hunt for his second that carries weight do i think we can beat them obviously i do but until we get the chance and unless they lose another game or 2 and we keep winning they will continue to be number 1 also im not sure being ranked as the second best team in the entire league qualifies as being slept on
1 loss defending sb champs returning their entire roster yeah id give them 1 too
i meantheyre defending spb champs who lost like no one have an mvp qb doing mvp things and a decent defense

until they lose 12 more they get the 1 ranking
nfl app with dark mode oni know the pain
to be the champs youve got to beat the champs
whats this supposed to be seems to be missing context
why is the text like that
even if the steelers go undefeated and win the super bowl the chiefs will still end the season at number 1 and will start next season at number 1

i find it funny how every teams sub goes on about how funny it would be and fantasizes about beating us
that jaguar costume smells of bong resin and broken dreams
i feel less anxiety about this trap game now that they disrespected the towel blowout incoming 423 you heard it here first claypool 3 tds
ive totally used mine as a mask when a tt in the back seat was all i had and i was already in the parking lot at giant eagle
they done done it again i was actually scared about this game for a minute
the sign is the only thing that lets you know that this was a picture taken in 2020 that home crowd could be from any year for them
this is a really old picture photoshopped to say covid it used to say ebola

see here
rentfreeeeeee in whoval
one dude said the steelers are their biggest rival like wtf
2020 says dont fuck with the terrible towel or youll pay the price
i am a little worried because this is already the perfect scenario for us to play down coming off a big win going on the road against a trash team what scares me even more is our recent history with the jaguars
blowout incoming
you dun fucked up now jaxson
at least pittsburgh is not in florida
jaguars have fans
that one did make me laugh though
apparently this was taken 100514

that day we beat them 179
i dont think theres any more playing down this year steelers are the team to best this year so were every bad teams superbowl
its in poor taste and its not even funny if youre going to tell a joke about a serious issue then it at least needs to be funny they are trying a bit too hard with this one
lol let them have there fun i have no problem with them just playing around
how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man
homerism aside i dont really find a football covid joke to be in good taste trash the steelers all you want but why make a joke out of a pandemic
jags dont remember what happened when they did this last time

this isnt an argument you want to make from preseason if the goal is to score gotcha points

were division mates and they were the first place team last year that means based on last years records they were absolutely 100 guaranteed to face a stronger schedule than us across 14 of the 16 games because we play the same afc south the same nfc east and the same browns and bungholes

other than that they play last years first place teams in the other afc divsions and we play last years second place teams

the only difference in sos we play the 142 ravens twice and they played our disaster of a qbless season record twice

in short their schedule was tougher than ours except for us

obviously as the season plays it doesnt always work out that way but its not exactly a point you want to celebrate
i dont see how this is possible we play the same teams except for 2 games where they play the division winners and well play the second place teams
the thing is also that when you are undefeated you have left a wake of weaker teams behind you

they only appear weaker because they had to play you
the difference in schedule is that we have the bills and the broncos they have the patriots and chiefs
who have the ravens beaten


also if the steelers win against the jaguars and ravens we clinch a playoff spot

marge oh god someone carved swastikas on your eyes

homer oh marge im sure it was just ab filled with hate
rsteelers turning into rsimpsonsshitposting im here for it

the song is blitzkrieg bop
the steelers sound guys actually play this song a good amount always gets me hype at games
hey guys vikings fan here wondering how much tickets for your home games are this year my girlfriend is a big steelers fan and i was considering getting tickets for her and i for the game on the 27th my question really is if the seats for two are a reasonable price this year and if they are worth taking the trip to heinz field thanks all
do you mean the 26th looks like cheapest pair of tickets is around 600 on stubhub not surprising considering its a home game against the ravens and theres limited capacity seating

edit if you meant dec 27th there are no tickets listed
absolute cheapest for any game seems to be 300ea after fees thats what i paid for the bengals game 1126 ravens tickets are around 4506 grey market december tickets arent on sale yet

to all the people saying just stay home i say go fuck em this is a once in a lifetime chance a steeler game with 5000 people is an experience that is never happening again no lines at concessions zero traffic easy parking ushers keep people separated its great ill be at the rest of the home games

please dont listen to idiots who think being a lifetime smoker actually protects you from a respiratory virus yinzers dont always send their best
give her a bigger present and stay home good friend of mine just beat covid and described the symptoms as a never ending concussion complete with the vomiting and aversion to bright lights
stay home my rona experience smoker here so drs said that because of the tar build up and other chemicals in my lungs that i was in a way protected from any coughingbreathing symptoms fever 2 nights in a row that broke and both nights ambulance ride because i was a degree from hypothermia the lethargic state that my body was in was unreal unlike anything i have ever been through or could imagine i could not walk from my door to my car without stopping i couldnt take a 10 min shower without stopping half way and sitting down and for the grand finally i had 90 viles or 3 weeks worth of labs smooth muscle antibodypositive scleraderma and ai hepatitis that was in march its november and im still not 100 im healthy exercise and now take a good amount of vitamins dont full yourself this isnt a cough
terrible idea covid is raging out of control in the midwest wait till next year
challenge accepted seriously i think we can come up with better
claypool likes mapletron i see no reason for it to change not like it would the nickname has sort of already stuck
nah its legit hes got a logo for it and everything its here to stay
mapletron is just fine whats the point of burying a nickname to force a new one
optimus primus

primus sweed

les
everyone knows that setting the goal to come up with a great nickname is the origin of every great nickname
chase atm because he is always open

idk i like mapletron lol
mapletron is a great nickname and hes embraced it so what is the point of coming up with a new one that probably wont be as good
i mean we could just call him claypool its not like its a bad name or hard to rememberpronounce

im willing to purchase my first nfl jersey but im curious about the size for me im 170cm and weight about 64kg 57 tall 140 lb was thinking in a youth xl chest 425 length 29 or an adult small chest 35375 length 29 waist 2932 any thoughts thanks un advance
i have an xxl for when i want the jersey over a hoodie but i also have a l just to wear although thats getting a little tight in my old age and i also have two xl jerseys that fit a lot nicer
fyi im 61 and about 110kg
in case youre looking at color rush they seem to run smaller than normal jerseys
just a heads up the youth jerseys have different sized numbers than the adult jerseys while it may fit its gonna look like a kids jersey on you
i would say to get an adult medium jerseys are supposed to fit large and typically youll have it over a hoodie or jacket in a normal noncovid world at a game
do you plan on wearing anything under it im just about the same size as you i have jerseys in 3 different sizes tho depending on when i want to wear them haha
get a adult medium im the same height a little heavier and a adult medium will fit you perfectly
you lost me at cms and kgs



obviously fake ab does not have anywhere near that level of sentence structure or lack of emojis
mr big cycle
antonio shorter and worse chase claypool brown
wheres the ab translator when you need him
people downvoting totally missing the joke apparently
i wish he wasnt as talented as he is its honestly hard to watch someone that good at something just ruining their life i listen to a podcast called crime in sports hes definitely going to be discussed on there if its still around in a few years

i am surprised they have 754k subscribers

theyre trying to screw over vikings by voting ngakoue to the pro bowl

if ngakoue makes the pro bowl the 5th rd pick the vikings gave the jags turns into a 4th rd pick possibly a 3rd if the ravens somehow won the super bowl which wont happen fuck the ratbirds

this is a level of pettiness i can get behind

vote ngakoue



edit this also fucks over ravens theyll lose a 5th pick in 2022 fucks over the ravens more than it does vikings im sure we can all get behind this now
its gonna take a lot of fuckery to get him into the pro bowl
i mean this is petty and kinda hilarious but also a great example why nothing should be a fan vote
why would i want to help give an afc team a higher draft pick
stop the count

count the votes
maybe after this weekend
this is a cause i can get behind





i was begrudgingly ok with letting him go coming into the year but im adamantly against it now juju is the beating heart of this team and he sets the example in that receiver room id argue after ben minkah and watt hes the fourth most important player on the team
hes hines and heath and the hype man all rolled into one
is there a stat for of times running headfirst into a defender or two to fight for that first down
itll be interesting to see how many 3rd down targets juju will get going forward since id assume the opponents know his success on 3rd downs time to switch it up the offensive play calling a bit going into december and beyond
everybody was so ready to dump him after last year not considering that he was injured for 4 games and playing with the 2 worst qbs in the league even then he still averaged more ypc than the year before give him even an average qb let alone big ben and he will produce
i am pretty sure he also has 0 drops and a true catch rate of 100 he is so reliable at 23 years old not even talking about him as a person we need him
hes my favorite
my dogs face lights up when i say juju he knows good things are going to happen
and he does it with a smile
you have got to find a way to leave your mark on the game
shows how much ben trusts him and you cant put a price tag on that
he is on fire but he has gotta out diggs stefons dave chappelle rick james cleat yeah i know i spelled that name backwards i live in mn lol
he is a great number 2 not wr1 money

this mf didnt practice all week probably just sat on his ass eating chips then pulls up on the block stomps on the bungles and wins afc offensive player of the week
comeback player of the year i think so
not bad for the 4th best qb in the division
and he barely played in the fourth quarter
cant believe hes holding us back
that is my fucking quarterback
das ma quarter pounder
at 38 years old so under appreciated clearly more efficient than ever and coming off a season ending injury we shall never tolerate big ben slander
the steelers are tight that is all
i think he has a legit case for mvp russ has sort of fallen off it could still be mahomes or brady but theyve already won it so theres a chance ben could squeak it out
first prek school teacher to win the award

ben roethlisberger is washed up and old1
rest the man
fire tomlin for making ben practice this week
i really wish ben would stop holding back the steelers
ben starting to creep up there in the mvp discussion it will impossible to overtake mahomes but he is staring down an excellent season by all metrics bens season is beyond impressive once you take into account the surgery and all that noise that he and stillers were finished
king of the north
wait til next week
you go ben coco
i actually thought that was a fairly poor game by his standards but a wins a win congratulations
big ben is washed im sorry i cant hear you anymore
i feel like ben is the end of the era of football players being somewhat normal dudes like as opposed to the hyper training athletes we have now ben is just naturally gifted to the point he doesnt need to train each day to stay on top of his game just a guy being a dude
this man needs to be the front runner for the mvp hes pulled us out of every single hole randy put us in this year
meh kill me for this but some of those throws especially the deep ones were pretty god damn terrible he overthrew claypool at least 3 times on routes that would have been 100 tds with an accurate throw i think that they just saw the big stat line against the bungles and determined that ben did amazing but honestly i thought he was alright claypool was better than ben
2 of those tds were so unnecessary
07 patriots
2020 steelers

those numbers and his first quarter was absolute garbage gotta love the guy
anyone else hope this is his last year

my lordthat was probably the angriest ive ever been as a steelers fan im getting a little angry now but then i realize were 90 and im happy again
jesse james caught that ball
i was watching this game with a bunch of people who had never seen a full nfl game before they asked me why people hated the patriots and i told them its because bullshit calls always went their way lo and behold this play happens at the end and they were all in disbelief none of them have ever watched another nfl game ever again fuck the pats
never been more mad at a call

this ended up costing us the 1 seed and we would have played titans instead of jags then hosted pats for afc title
i still get so mad about this we win that game and were the 1 seed not ne then get tenn instead of jax in the divisional round ahh what could have been
what gets lost in all of this is that the patriots had at least two gamewinning touchdown catches earlier that same year wherein the lack of ball control during the process of the catch was much more evident ball bobbling and wobbling moving around between hands getting trapped with the ground etc they were scoring plays which are supposed to be subject to review and the refs didnt even take a second look but of course the pats were supposed to beat the jets and texans anyways so why bother getting the call right pittne is a marquee matchup so you gotta take a half hour to scrutinize every play and apply the strictest interpretation of the rules possible

if you look at replays throughout nfl history you can easily spot thousands of catches that were much more dubious than what jj did that night under the older rules the standard is the standard except when the pats are involved and suddenly all of history flies out the window thats what gets so many people pissed off
damn man i just woke up why you gotta do this to me already
jesse james caught that ball will be written on my grave
call me crazy but i was an outlaw jesse james fan was disappointed to see that guy leave for detroit

and it was a catch
based on the dumb rules at the time regarding going to the ground it wasnt a catch glad that the nfl looked like idiots and was forced to change the definition of a catch after they got called out for gifting yet another win to the pats with that dumb rule
heath got robbed and so did our season i really think that was the one for the killer bs completely shafted us on playoff seeding and set up the debacle to follow fuck the pats fuck tom brady
stop angering up my blood
i cried when that happend
seeing this makes me sick to my stomach a call that only the patriots would get
ive blocked this image out of my mind along with the entirety of my middle school and high school years
this one still pisses me off one that pisses me off more the the bettis coin flip debacle fuck that shit
im still mad about this
hot correct take they got the call right the rule was bad but was applied correctly
people dont understand the rules at the time incomplete

hes definitely stepped up since hilton went down fun to watch
pff has him as a top ten corner
weird story but im a tennessee fan and a steelers fan my son was born like a month after the draft and we named him cameron just because he went from the vols to the steelers
i have seen him get a lot of love lately and rightfully so i was super high on him last year in the limited time he saw the field but hes just been awesome this year quickly become one of my favorites but im not hopeful theyll be able to keep him longterm
great mustache lunch pail guy
joe hadens replacement
best db weve drafted since gay happy to see him have somewhat of a breakout year but hoping its not enough that he plays his way out of here lol
i love this fucking team
great cover guy who isnt afraid of physical play
that ripped fumble against cincy was dirty i was so hyped hes doing so well
as a tn native and ut fan i love seeing him do well love him and hilton 2 guys that just dont get enough credit in my opinion
avery joined that week sutton been on fire since that day relevant because avery is strip ball king


the reactionary kneejerk takes really are astounding he throws 3 picks against ten then under 200 yards against bal all of a sudden hes holding us back mfers really expect to see mahomes and rodgers numbers and everything else is game manager numbers
ive said this before but ben is a type of qb whos impact on the steelers success can be hard to quantify when hes not having one of his 6 td perfect qbr games and while i think pffs system is the best system for quantifying as many aspects of football as possible they still cant really measure why ben is so good

i dont know if you guys like basketball but a player that gets similar treatment is kyle lowry kyle is constantly disrespected and called a fake allstar when in reality he does so much for the toronto raptors some athletes just play winning footballbasketball regardless of their statistics

also part of the reason the pff folks are reluctant to give loads of praise to anything other than our pass rush and occasionally claypool is because a lot of them are bengals fans pff is based inaround cincinnati regardless of what the numbers are that effects their enthusiasm and how they interpret the data

i think they do a decent job staying unbiased but on some level it cant be avoided
the important thing is steelers fans know what ben means to the team especially after last year
ben has never gotten the credit he deserves people still talk about his bad performances in the super bowls despite being the 1 reason we made it to them in the first place

2005 2008 2010 we do not make those super bowls without ben period
we should all be so held back in all aspects of our lives
ben will never get the credit he deserves just have to accept it pff is also complete and total cancer

because our franchise qb was out for the overwhelming majority of 2019
thats the difference between mason vs ben
as i said on twitter today all the dumbest motherfuckers work for pff
i dont understand why the pff podcast guys refuse to give ben actual credit its so dumb
i support this fact
i know it doesnt matter one iota but every week i find myself annoyed that we are the last undefeated team and yet we cant seem to jump the chiefs both teams have had some close games and some blowouts but only one has won all of their games

i was curious about what you folks think on this matter
literally nobody should care

just enjoy this amazing season and stop caring about whether other people think we are the best or second best team it doesnt matter at all
the steelers could win the super bowl at 190 and people would still put the chiefs above them at the end of the season and to start next season
first of all it doesnt matter second the chiefs have mahomes and he is 251 tdint advanced metrics love him even more but like i saidit doesnt matter
the better question is why do you care
no probably not a 1 game difference isnt that big and as i said in a thread last night they are the defending super bowl champions with patrick mahomes former mvp and possible mvp this year at qb and got most of their roster from last year back they get the nod in the power rankings because of those things its as easy an explanation as there can be
it depends on whos rankings your looking at were at the top of some of them
there is no methodology to the power rankings so its impossible to predict
no because the difference of 1 game isnt enough to offset the fact theyre defending sb champs and have returned 20 of 22 starters
well find out who the better team is come playoffshere we go steelers
doesnt matter power rankings dont mean anything the record is what matters
first of all as everyone else is saying who cares about where we are on a list of power rankings it literally means nothing and is really just for fun

secondly as long as mahomes hill and kelce are healthy i would take them over every team in the league regardless of record and us having one game over them is hardly insurmountable
i know it doesnt matter one iota

and were done here


if this happens it also fucks over the ratbirds who will have to send a higher 2022 conditional pick originally a 5th to minnesota
fuck it ill vote for him too
i didnt vote for him because i hadnt heard of this yet ill go do it now
i won the pro bowl by a lot
i voted for him the pro bowl is a popularity contest
lol


dont worry it wont happen the fan vote doesnt count for much and no player or coach is voting him in so even if he received 100 of the fan vote hed fall short of getting in to the pro bowl based on the player and coach vote
pro bowl has always been a popularity contest this is no different
its not fraud its collusion get your trump buzz word right
which position does yannick play i need to vote him in
hold upyou said jaguars and fans in the same sentence

haha my baby is undefeated too
who defeats babies

and its a shame it might not come from us
too many good players good problem to have
if sutton was starting on the outside i could see him get nelson money hes a solid outside guy as hes not a full time starter my guess something like 4year gets it done

sweet that 4th should be a nice immediate starter at wr
the sixth is for sean davis lol
was hoping that wed snag a third for hargrave but having three qbs change teams and sign for 20m pushed hargrave down the list a bit
love the info thank you so much for posting i find the compensatory picks very confusing especially once the season gets going and player get cuttradedinjured glad to see we will gain some capital in the draft i for one believe this is an under appreciated factor when letting players walk im not saying we could hav known we would get dobbs hawkinsor davis back but its hard not to smile when you realize we got picks for 2 of them and would have had a third if the other had not been cut
but with bud dupree matt feiler zach banner alejandro villanueva juju smithschuster james conner mike hilton cameron sutton and others scheduled to be unrestricted free agents in 2021 its inevitable that they will have some roster spots to fill


goddammit

has tomlin lost the locker room takes in three two one
for context tomlin said this about prepping for the jaguars

we are not a big ten team playing a mac opponent this week tomlin said tuesday every time we step into a stadium were playing professionals players and coaches weve got a ridiculous level of respect for that write your story follow your storylines about trap games and things of that nature we understand what were going into in jacksonville that thats a group thats trying to kick our butt a professional group capable group and were preparing with that understanding
joke aside i wonder what of steelers fans are mac grads quite a few schools around there

mac grad who is a steelers fan
big ben and tomlin are secretly divas whats next chase claypool is a satanic worshipper
why are so many people not realizing this is banter yeesh
steeler fan and mac school grad the mac was better back in the early naughts but hey diante johnson seems to be doing just fine

william mary from the storied colonial athletic conference the coaches cradle lol

i guess you just need to find talent where it is
can someone explain what this means
i love the ballbusting team is obviously loose and having fun makes the winning that much more enjoyable

hell i feel like we draft a lot of mac guys
shots fired
caa for those who are curious
big 10 badgers
big sky conference
i dont even know what confrence william and mary is in and i was within walking distance from their football stadium for 10 years
cusa and aac here utulsa
i went to toledo got to see ben vs bruce gradkowski once
fake drama who cares anyone who knows about college ball knows how true this reference is
its fun to go through and see people happy but not cocky about being 90 like we all know we could lose the next game but we are all so happy that we keep winning we all know x number of other teams would be partying and celebrating and acting like assholes just saying im happy to be a steeler
looks at game thread

we arent acting like assholes

the response from mike tomlin
literally me lol
fuck lebron
who cares lost all respect for lebron when he decided to support china and his money over human rights
fuck lebron dude is all about that money and sucks chinese government dick

you can vote as much as you want jesus i should just set up an autoclick and submit program and have it run overnight a few times
this is a cause i can get behind
hes going to get the most pro bowl votes in history
this is not gonna end well for the ratbirds lololololol

yes that would definitely be the game to break them out
has to be a certainty imo holiday game prime time against a bitter rival with playoff seeding implications the perfect storm to break out the best unis in the nfl
itll be a massive disappointment if we dont
oh be still my heart if we bust out the color rush at home on thanksgiving night

i hope lamar has a peaceful death because it sure wont be pretty
as much as i like thes unis when are we going to wear our throwbacks those are easily my favorite
when the color rush come out i start itching to break some shit baby lets go
any idea how drunk ill be jesus
please
pittsburgh needs to go back to block numbers i want a claypool jersey
anyone know our record wearing these
if you support an ensemble with the word splash anywhere in the name its time to move on from football and just go full time project runway

you think anything scares ben

he laughs in the face of dread

a big hearty bearded crooked nosed laugh
big ben is like michael myers never runs or moves faster than a slow walk yet is always right behind you somehow

who cares

its just sports writers doing what they do writing shit to generate attention it means absolutely nothing
claypool should 100 be on this list but dont knock antonio gibson its unfortunate he plays on the washington potatoes but hes a beast

i just recently moved to minneapolis and have been going to the awesome steelers bar at patrick mcgoverns pub in st paul to watch the last 6 weeks its a wonderful atmosphere if you are ever in the area for game day

however the governor of mn just closed all bars and restaurants for 4 weeks in the state and from what i understand the game will not be televised here

anyone have any recommendations on how to watch slight notes i live in an apartment directv is a no go and id really like to not be picked up by the pirate police tomorrow

thanks
crackstreamscom
nflbitecom
living in an apartment shouldnt preclude your being able to stream live games via directv the online nfl ticket option has a free trial so you can see if it works for you for a week good way to watch one game even if you have no interest in watching legally moving forward just be sure to cancel after watching unless youre okay being dinged for the 70 bucks a month a week later
if you are truly looking for something unorthodox maybe one of the other fans here could set up a twitch stream and do an interpretive dance for you based upon each play of the game
ive been using all year
hey enjoy it i live in illinois right now cant wait to move back
just an fyi for yinzersabroad if you try the steeler app and it blocks the audio try the actual snr website

thanks for posting this for the eleventh time it wasnt stupid enough the first ten
this will be the first game i dont wear my troy p shirt since my gf made it for me so if we end up losing this it is all my fault for forgetting it at my house while visiting her dad lets hope the shirt wasnt the key to staying undefeated

safe to say i didnt cost us the game by forgetting the shirt thanks for you all counter balancing my forgetfulness
i on the other hand i have my one year old son with me to watch the gamedidnt have to work today hes been with me for every tight game this year so lets hope thats enough to offset you forgetting that shirt
im just a little stitious
dont worry i stopped wearing my lucky jersey and we just kept winning steelers are way above that shit
well i am how could you forget the shirt the jags are 19 you know were going to play like shit
dammit wolf wheres he live
the real superstition is steelers nation performing the counter jinx ritual all week we have to truly believe the jags will win for it to work
we lose spillaine is coming for your gf

its okay i have my new polomalu salute to service jersey so i got you covered

1 franco harris 11 1972

2 louis lipps 11 1984

3 chase claypool 10 2020
i know they are our rivals and i really dont have great feelings towards the team but i hate seeing burrow go down if its a season ender like some comments here said
those announcers can fuck right off
im way more worried than i should be about losing the sack streak
ot for baltimore coming to pittsburgh on a short week while our guys got rest yes please
i too am looking to bust one
in a 30 game there are so many ppl calling this a loss already it is fucking ridiculous we are 90 even with ugly wins that is what good teams do calm the fuck down and lets go
drug commercialsthe healthiest looking sick people you will ever see in your life living some of the most funoldpeople lives ever
tj literally has to be tackled for a ref to begrudgingly throw a flag lmao
oknow can we just stfu about edmunds hes been a starter since his rookie year and a solid performer for the last two
i dont want to jinx it but
ben with the game breaking block
big blocklisberger
fuck you announcers for that one smh
have you heard about our newest wr stud diontae washington
they finally called a hold on tjs man this guy gets held half of every play
you know what ill take having four top tier wrs and a good te over a single diva megasuperstar wr especially when the love is spread around so much
and with a meaningless end of half pick roethlisberger falls behind sam darnold and drew lock in the espn qb rankings
did you guys see that ref have a stroke with that flag
time for mason to hand it to snell a bunch of times
kinda bummed for cincy


didnt hate burrows seems like a pretty standup dude hoping he comes back next year healthy
anyone else unspeakably nervous
that celebration was perfect
claypool is like ab but with a healthy amount of swagger instead of being an arrogant douche
yup juju is a team player and has installed that mentality in the rest of the team love these fucking guys they make steelers football fun
lol member when miami said he was just average
if boswell misses fuck this announcer
that guy in the overalls might have been the most steeler thing ive seen today
i dont understand how you can be an nfl offensive coordinator and run it up the gut on 2nd and 12 out of the shotgun with your 3rd4th string speed running back
that burrow injury didnt look to good never like to see it prayers
that one ref was just like iunno
it would take ben to throw for 500 yards with tds to 6 different receivers 3 rushing touchdowns and a defensive shutout for yinzer fans to be happy
dear nfl
please raise salary cap so we can retain all of our players to make it fair we will fire our oc
i want a derek watt rush attempt and a chance for rudolph to throw it downfield why because fuck these guys thats why
our 2nd string hitting people like they want to play 1st stringlove it
fuck you ian eagle learn how to pronounce your own name
someone this week on this sub called committing to the run game the hill that 90 will die on and honestly thats the best take ive read in weeks
claypool is getting a framed picture on that wall this week
juju is such a team player you love to see it that kid is good for any team i hope we can keep him
randy dying to call a run on third and nine
we needed 15 randy called a play to throw behind the line of scrimmage smooth
jesus chase is just eliminating their dbs one by one
juju slipped on a penalty flag wtf
mason rudolph the human victory cigar
i bet someone will find a way to still say were overrated maybe something along the lines of

if the jags scored on every drive then pittsburgh wouldve lost
thank you titans
64 lmao trashbirds
these announcers need to shut the fuck up
best team celebration happy birthday juju
ben just blocked like 8 guys
ben blocked 3 guys
i feel so bad for burrow he had to go die for the bengals team
the screech was me sorry you could hear it from pa
tj got a holding call tj got a holding call
edmunds heard yall talking mad shit since day 1
edmunds has 2 picks and watt finally had a holding call holy shit
hed be able to go back in if it werent for the scoring situation

cut to juju limping along the sideline like hes totally not in any shape to go back in
man what a ball by big ben holy shit
chase claypool roty
the ravens and titans are beating the absolute shit out of each other today you love to see it
lmao that shriek was exactly what i was thinking
refs see everything except for tj watt being held all game smh
just let juju sit the rest of the game we can manage without him
uwu were not jinxing him dont worry uwu
if i had to guess our record just based on these game threads i would guess that were the 18 team we havent been dominating in many games this season but this team has gotten the job done when the pressure is on cut our guys some slack
best celebration so far
aw they got juju a cake
the birthday cake celebration for juju you love to see it
ben always throws one hilarious block a game lol
ben with the 710 split
conner only averaging 8 ypc

stupid fichtner
minkah has that ed reed ball hawk trait the ball just finds him
edmunds got his pick baby yessss hes been lights out all year after getting so much hate for little reason last year much deserved
only bens fifth int this season and almost all of them looked like that
i love how offended coach cowher is on bens behalf about tomlins mac comment thats the second time hes mentioned it today lol
yeah well wait till they see my release time when the steelers get to 100
anyone else hear that screech lmfao
this team is absolutely handcuffed by fichtners playcalling
i get jack lambert vibes from tj watt sometimes that tackling style
i may be drunk but i reflexively said awwwwwww when the whole team came off the sidelines to congratulate terrell this team just loves each other
edmunds 2 int game would not have been on my prediction list
can yall stop asking to cut edmunds
seeing edmunds succeed is so amazing



remember last year we had the barron and old edmunds special
congratulations on alex smith winning his first game back

a goddamn warrior
juju got mario kart banana peeled by that ref
am i the only one who thinks alex highsmith will be the gem of our 2020 class he has shown great play recognition plays in coverage and was said a stud pass rusher in college

im pretty excited for the kid
this is where mason really shines
lamar sucks man i cant wait to eat some rat birds on turkey day

100
alright yinzers

1 the off is not going to get a td on every drive
2 the def will not get 3 and outs every time
3 lets just have a calm relaxing 3 quarters before you start going ballistic
4 thx
5 edit too late omg
announcers love when shit like that happens
luton is scared lmao cant blame him though id probably shit myself if i had to deal with our pass rush
obviously great play by mapletron but that throw by ben on 3rd to washington with pressure in his face was outstanding
dammit my stream is 1 full minute behind the live feed appatwntly so nothing i can comment is timely and anything i read hasnt happened yet
claypool is a fucking dogg im looking forward to this wr corps for years to come
i love our wr te lineup this season sooo much we cant lose juju
might have been the best deep ball throw by ben all year
so flag on a push none for a punch got it these refs are a joke anymore
the refs love the steelers
how the fuck did johnson catch that holy fucking shit
might not have been a td but that was an amazing play by dj
holy shit what a second effort and catch
hey for all of you guys on the fence or worse about dj jumping on the bandwagon now welcome refreshments are in the front please enjoy yourselves remember to say molded after ab at least three times during your trip
lol these florida men they keep showing in the stands
claypool is so good at drawing dpis that every game haters will say the refs saved us
run run pass special
when youre 90 and have the second most 3 and outs in the league
stop running on 2nd and long

and especially stop doing it with backup running backs
cameras should be banned from getting near the blue tent
that scream was exactly how i felt holy fuck lmao
i love seeing us steelers fans caring that burrow got hurt we got some really good fans man its good to see
did switzer put on ray rays jersey for that play
the play calling is atrocious im pretty sure fitchner has money on the under
did you guys see that far ref just hold his flag lol
it sure would be nice if tennessee and philadelphia would help us clinch the division faster by winning today
we should keep juju out for the rest of this game we need healthy players for thursday short week is a curse
man i cant help but be happy for edmunds you know he wanted those today so bad
good for edmunds hes been underrated by a lot of fans so i feel good hes finally got the counting stats those guys care about plus if he can play the ball like today the ceiling for him shoots way up
what an absolute steal by edmunds
the eagles let down the entire state today
what a finisher you see the ravens offense body language on the sidelines they knew they were done
as coach t says there are still areas to improve upon the best part is we are improving areas on a 100 team the standard is the standard
bend dont break hopefully ben is dialed in today
icing the kicker in the first
swear to god every time they put one of those stats up
lol these announcers spending the whole game so far trying to jinx us
so far dline keeping the end zone gluten free




ill see myself out
2nd and 10 i swear if this is a run randy
haikusbot sure loves

this sub on game day i think

get me one more beer
what the hell else does tj have to do to get a flag blatant holds
really the int would have been nice but the holding on that play was ridiculous
that td celebration was precious and i never use that word
i love this wr core
watch the nfl fine juju for some covid violation for blowing out his football candle
best celebration ever
its sure starting to look like we got a top 10 talent 49th overall
that dude threw a punch and got nothing
personal foul 15 yard penalty for getting punched in the face
minkah is the most clutch player on this defense
minkah making picks large benjamin throwing blocks aint nobody overlooking the jagoffs

we do need a juju bd td

time for a 2 minute drill by the guy who basically invented the shit
haha harbaugh is fighting with titans players before the game ravens whole organization is a joke
man alualu has been a good backup the previous years but hes been a fucking revelation this year really playing well even feels like an improvement over hargrave to and thats saying something
i had complete faith the entirety of that run

looks around nervously
dj is ab 20 without the obvious issues
diontae is a fucking monster today
as a james conner owner on my fantasy team i did not appreciate the give to snell there but i will take the points as a steelers fan first
guys guys guys now were not 20 points in the lead therefore we cant lose a 20 point lead again really the int saved us
this is looking like 2018 steelers offense paired with the 2008 steelers defense pretty incredible plays on both ends im loving this season
that was the most pathetic opening drive i could think of lol
only the steelers can make 173 feel like barely winning lol
i really hate that joe burrow just got
seriously injured even though hes a bungle i like watching him ball
damn it titans youre supposed to beat them not fall to them
sorry to hear about burrow
burrows knee just got destroyed real tough break for the kid
lmao who screamed
pops just started snoring tells you how interesting this half has been
can we get juju a td for his birthday
bullshit call theyve done that to us all game no calls
i knew the quarter wasnt supposed to end there because of the penalty but once the ads start rolling the nfl must stop gotta love it
this clay on clay violence has to stop
refs are literally clueless
claypool has prolly 3000 yards if you counted pass interferences as yards
juju twist his ankle on the flag or something
claypool 64 238lb and ran a 442 40 the dude is scary for anyone
wait what happened they call the hold on against tj

how did that happen
is terrell edmunds elite
that wasnt even the top 10 holds on tj today
anyone talking shit about edmunds based off last years play can kick rocks hes been good this year
that was a great interception
i didnt call 2 picks for 34 but good on him
holding call on tj followed immediately by edmunds second pick of the day truly these are the end times
but but but edmunds doesnt have ball skillz
remember when we signed ebron and people told us good luck he cant catch fuck them
10 and 0 has a nice ring to it
hope juju can play vs ravens
joey burrow
joeyb
nov 22
thanks for all the love cant get rid of me that easy see ya next yearraised fist



done for the year
that feeling when youre 100 encroachmentjpg
come on titans
pretty sure the pandemic postponed your honeymoon
thank you derrick henry
which one of yinz is at the game shirtless in overalls and a hard hat
hey edmunds sucks guy you wanna walk that back yet
here we goooo

get ready for folks in here to live and die on each play lol
ian eagle is a fucking cunt fuck him
fucking announcer talking about jinxing it then he actually did jinx it
i really hate these announcers why do all announcers seem to be trash
how many jinx graphics do they have queued up
i mean people are freaking out it was one quarter i get the slow start thing but we have only had the ball twice one bad drive and another where we drove 50 yards but we just started at our own 5 so we werent in position to kick a fg or go for it its gonna be fine
u can just tell ben hates these playcalls lol
tj being put into a judo throw like every other play lmao
lol tj just getting blatantly held
holding the fuck out of tj watt what are these refs looking at lol
jardiance can ruin your taint hard pass
claypool is elite
nice to see the receivers celebrate jujus birthday
bro i fucking love chase man i hope he ends up with us long long term
claypool 10games10 tds roy
now that celebration is great
chase claypool is my dad
nelson pushed him and chark through a punch
minkah and clutch ints name a better duo
jacksonville is in the redzone time to let minkah do his thing
drink every time minkah bails out the rest of the d after a garbage drive
best trades the org has ever made
guys minkah might be good at football
alualu has been awesome this year hes a serious difference maker
minkah is the the true fitzmagic
ive never seen conner make runs like that he looks so much faster today
holy hell dj is a freak
now that was a florida steelers fan lol
jaguars what are you doing

steelers were burying you
if ya snelllllll

what the steelers are cooking
fat guy just sitting there vibin my man
i love how it says welcome to sacksonville in the background as edmunds gets a pick
this team makes it impossible to buy a new jersey

im torn between claypool dj juju watt or minkah

honorable mention to bush
is bumped off his route another way to say interference
even if it meant missed calls against us its refreshing having so few flags so far
ben now has as many ints on the season as he did in the 2017 game vs jax
diontae james the team is in trouble you ready

james yea yea im ready

diontaejames fushinha

diontae washington this isnt even our final form
ah yes the 2nd and 12 rush attempt
wow who would have guessed a run run pass to start a half
how in gods name is randy fichtner still our offensive coordinator
ben should just go into the two minute offense on the first drive of each half
we need a sack cant break that streak
everyone complaining about runrunpasspunt but what you all dont realize is that the mccloud play was technically a forward pass so ya know progress
haden walked off with no assistance fingers crossed
burrow injury


damn burrow is down hope hes ok
prayers up to burrow
gotta hand it to our guys wanting to check on the status of the jags player
can vance return by thanksgiving our run game definitely was far better with him blocking
who screamed
you guys hear that person scream when ben tossed that pass
that scream haha
chikfila advertises heavily during nfl games

also chikfila not open on sundays
why tf are we throwing short of the sticks every 3rd down
this has officially been the most boring 3rd quarter ive ever seen
ben shaking his head he agrees the play calling is shitty
can we get a replay
show the replay wtf
how can people complain this is us undefeated would you guys rather have ravens offense
you get the feeling pittsburgh d is finally exerting their will

sir they have 3 points in the 4th quarter
does claypool not get the calls because he is a rookie

im happy he doesnt complain but my god how much more obvious could it be
i have few criticisms of claypoolbut i think hes missed a few makeable although contested passes he will get better
not running the ball on a 2nd and 1 and then 3rd and 1 against a 18 team up 173 in the 4th

theres a serious lack of faith in the run block of this offensive line

how far can you go without a run game
wow that ref really didnt want to throw that flag lol
jacksonville needs to stop pulling chases jersey seems like the universe doesnt like it
love seeing boz back he missed a 46 yarder on his first kick doesnt let it get to him and cranks a 44 and 47 thats how you bounce back
edmunds island
edmunds with his second
what a fucking grab by edmunds
edmunds changing the narrative
wtf i love edmunds now
holy shit edmunds what a pick
edmunds yes drag this drive out and end it
edmunds having a career day lmao
whats going on here tj got a call
somebody find the edmunds hater and waterboard them
i think with 2 interceptions today edmunds passes ike taylor on the steelers all time list
edmunds playing like this zoinks me right in the jinkies
put in mason let ben have a rest
my heart really appreciates these 2 weeks of heart attack free football
oh gosh juju hobbling around on the sidelines hope hes alright
just a reminder that jake luton still gets paid at least the league minimum which is like 600000
juju take my toe happy birfday
lmao the lady screaming happy birthday juju
juju is a fucking treasure and im going to be heartbroken if they cant keep him
so juju stepped on a flag and got hurt right that is how it happened
100 lets crush ravens next week and clinch the division
browns could be second in the division
game ball goes to edmunds best game of his career so far
tj watt would lead the league in sacks if he wasnt getting held every damn play
best qb drafted in years just sacrificed himself for a team that couldnt bother to protect him
just realized i had some funds in fanduel made up an impossible 30 7 leg parlay to try for 16k wish me luck

took steelers at 105

ben under 2755 passing

conner over 715 rushing

jags under 295 points

under 125 pts total in 4th qtr

luton over 2195 passing

and a pit defense or st touchdown
luton threw that one away as fast as i would have seen a steelers defender rushing me down without anyone blocking
thats 12 batted balls at the line of scrimmage for roethlisberger this year
talking about the jinx jinx fucking eagle and cd
asshole just jinxed us
as they talk about announcer jinxes they jinx it
d line looking good so far getting pressure on j gluten
its not even our second drive yet and people in this sub are already being a bunch of depressing lemons
ben gets rid of the ball fast because he is tired of getting hit
wr loves passing game with hof qb


more at 11
astros cheated
im so looking forward to winning on the last play with no time on the clock


sigh
run run incomplete punt
not even 14 of the way through the game and weve got people throwing in the towel already lol
hope pouncey is okay
stop running backwards ray ray
80 yard punt
all three drives have stopped when weve decided to run on first and second down bringing up third and long
cant wait for the 2nd half where we finally have to abandon the run
we definitely look like the better team here hopefully it can start showing on the scoreboard
look at the positives folks each run run pass is one drive closer to ben taking command and thats where the fun begins
are some of you really panicking jesus get some perspective its early were tied were up 3 in the division best record in the league shits ok cool out
i am glad that was incomplete because watt was held
does tj get held half the time or is that just me
they never call holding when tj is being held its so fucking obvious

however the jags cant handle the pressure anyways so fuck it
holding on tj holy fuck
these holds on watt are getting ridiculous
what a catch mapletron
juju blowing out the birthday football
air canada
one claypool touchdown on the board another one for my prediction to come true

seven touchdowns and he ties the record for most rookie touchdowns in a season
bro that birthday celebration
absolutely dying at that celebration
espn after that td pass nah that dont count
chase claypool is pretty good at football
that commercial is a disgrace and should be banned for destroying a beautiful song by sir elton john
ou td total for claypool 175 yeah randy moss hes coming for the rookie record
what the fuck nelson gets punched and were cool with it
minkah from the top rope
fitzmagic for the good guys
yeah bitch fuck you conley fuck you chark
thats my first round draft pick
can you even call that a block by ben
bens block lol
ben was a blocker whether he liked it or not lol
minkahs takedown would have made khabib proud
who needs blocking tight ends when you have a blocking qb
that catch made me pull out the finger guns
dj gets so many targets because he always abuses corners as a route runner even if his hands arent abs he gets too much separation not to throw to him all the time
diontae keeps one upping himself with these catches
hey they just showed one of us on the tv wearing overalls
snell snell mach snell
all hail dionte and minkah were not worthy
we get the ball back in the 2nd right
eh not really upset
fellas theres 9 seconds and you got one timeout you go for the td once then take the fg if you dont get it
officials just get tired of throwing the flag because thomas threw washington to the ground in the end zone
lutons passer rating down to 150 718 for 87 yards and two interceptions if he took the snap and spiked it into the ground 18 times his rating would be 393
dionte washington according to cbs
start with a jet sweepfacepalm
it seems unfair coach cowher has to wear a suit for the intermission show right now lets get him a steelers hoodie and sweats instead
bro we need to stop that jetsweep play it was cool once everyone knows what we are doing
randy fichtner sucks
why are they running our smallest rb up the middle
im ready for offensive coordinator ben roethlisberger
alright sack time i feel it
fuck hope allen is okay
lol ahhhh
damn its pretty bad if they are carting him off poor kid
lmao who screamed right there

stopped watching at 33 came back at 173 and havent scored since do i need to stop watching
why does cbs insist on using that low camera angle on punts its impossible to see anything
i could watch dupree sack rookie quarterbacks all day
it must be terrifying to just have bud duprees giant hand appear out of nowhere when youre trying to throw a football
juju takes hits to the helmet every time he has the ball
claypool would be having a monster game if claybrooks wasnt grabbing him all day should have 3 pi calls right now
small tug down below
little tug he was fucking hanging onto claypools jersey for 15 fucking yards
what the fuck is this just run in to claypool on every play strategy
looked like a hammy gotta keep those hammies loose
if your hayden and you feel your hamstring pop like that you take him down to avoid the touchdown i think it was intentional
lol at claypool being such a massive human that guys get hurt just being near him
kick the fg and bring in the back ups
did juju slip on the flag

the refs flag injured juju
lol yall were expecting the team to lose the game

were up by 3 scores and ppl acting like were down by 28


son of a
its about time they call that
edmunds
edmunds got hands
edmunds is having himself a game
edmunds the fuckin madlad
edmunds ate his wheaties this morning
oh were calling holding on tj now sweet
edmunds coming up big today
finally a holding call
number 2 for edmunds
edmunds has he finally become the safety we hoped for always deadly against the run now a ball hawk too
i appreciate that the defense is making a no name qb look completely lost much better than the dallas game or driskel for the broncos
edmunds is blossoming alongside minkah having a future hall of famer back there with you is a good way to relax and ball out that was one hell of an int in the rain
holy shit what a grab edmunds
edmunds haters are in shambles
im so happy for edmunds hes been quietly improving every game and this is fantastic for him
my dad literally just called that interception
show me a second claypool touchdown
lol fuck the guy saying edmunds sucks literally ten minutes ago he probably on his dick now
this fucking defense
wish i could pull out one of my dozen comments on how edmunds is a great fit in pittsburgh and is on the cusp of that next level of play but ill just let the boxscore do the talking
woman cleaning her glasses in the rain i feel her pain
its time for rudolph to take the field

and definitely take dj claypool and conner out of the game also
juju is just doing a gangster walk right


right
im starting to think we did sign derek in order to pressure tj to stay with the team
really sucks about juju i dont know how he comes back to play on a short week while hes limping around the sidelines but well see he definitely looks upset as hell
how concerned should we be about jujus injury he doesnt look right but at the same time hes on the sideline still and not the locker room
toe injury is probably the best case scenario and he looks a little less sad now at least
ugh let rudy throw it we should have 1000 points if it wasnt for rrrrrandy
football players are so gosh darn big
can we lend minkah to tennessee for the rest of the baltimore game and get him back afterward they need him more than we do at this very moment


burrows confirming hes done for the season
ok titans march down that field and win please
i love tomlin so fucking much
all you people trashing edmunds screw you
i wonder how long into the game its gonna be before they bring up that vilma and ben were in the same draft again for the 7474732th time
edmunds haters in shambles
steelers know they have the target on their back and that its now officially hot in the kitchen

steelers control the game from the start and win 3117
this feels like one of those games that takes a year off my life im expecting an ugly comefrombehind win
is it wishful thinking that since tua is taking over in miami that fits would make a better backup in pitt or am i on crack
post malone fucking sucks
clearly the game plan today is to blitz the hell out of luton it worked out pretty well those last two plays
thanks commercial


just remembered i needed to buy 2 luxury vehicles for my perfect family of attractive mate and 25 average kids in my huge private driveway home


brb guys
i respect the gutsy call but thanks for the great field position
announcer jinx
he missed because of that stupid graphic
ian and vilma are hells commentary team
the steelers arent going to lose this game but the problem is starting out like trash every week that shit has to be fixed to win the one seed super bowl
are these announcers trying to do more jinx with these graphics
its so frustrating listening to the announcers on these games anytime the underdog does anything positive they act like its a huge deal
bud looking fast today
luton getting rid of the ball like a man that doesnt want to get sacked
i hate announcer jinx like seriously dude wtf inb4 ben hasnt thrown a pick in such and such attempts smfh
no quarterback has been getting rid of the ball faster than big ben

i dunno luton is letting it loose pretty damn fast to avoid even the chance of someone to sniff at a sack
claypool gonna have a monster game today you can just feel it right in your buttocks
between the elevens

i love this rookie 1111 chase claypool
slow start for the pittsburgh steelers

as per usual
this defense is absolutely mentally abusing this kid lmao
buds going to beat himself up about that one that was 6 easy points
bud your bicep too swole that couldve been a pick
run run 3rd and 8
lets draft this quick athletic gadget type of player and only ever run him downhill between the tackles

misusing the fuck out of mcfarland
running mcfarland like a power back straight up the middle is frustrating run him outside in space and let him take advantage of that burst
juju better get some birthday presents in the form of td passes this game
imagine thinking fichtner isnt pure shit when our offense only starts clicking when we let ben call plays and air it out fichtner is predictable and lacks creativity on offense would love to see what a real oc could do with our offensive weapons
i think i just saw the most blatant hold on tj ive ever seen in my life
damn the league really said fuck offensive holding this year
almost turned into a pick should be our team motto this game good lord

edit we got the pick fuck yeah minkah
walmart lets celebrate what matters

me like living wages for all your workers

walmart like these fieldgoals
juju hines ward smithschuster
theres no shame in passing the ball a lot when the running game isnt working randy you asshole this team deserves a better oc hes fucking awful
so do we get to talk about claypool as roty yet or
claypool already a stud
that was insane
claypool roty
a celly
there goes that boy claypool for his 10th td in 10 games ben with the dime
10 touchdowns in 10 games unbelievable
bro our wideouts are just top tier i love this team
chase muthafuckin claypool the next steeler wr legend
claypool is unreal how do the steelers find these wr
announcers tryna make drama ball always goes to juju in the 2nd half
juju is a national treasure
01 personnel this offense only works in it week in and week out

this is taking 5 receivers empty set and letting your talent win

is it sustainable long term i do not know i wish and hope other formations see success but what i do know is that this 01 personnel is absolutely lethal
60 years since anyones done what hes done not a top ten rookie according espn of course
fucking dumb from nelson
ez pz
big mink
who called that minkah pick


get back out here
what time is it minkah time
minkah was such a fucking steal for us
dude has a sixth sense for the ball jesus christ
minkah my duuuude
ben
minkah swinging his dick at the whole jaguars team on that drive
talk shit get hit jagoffs
beautiful way to take away at least 3 points
hell yeah fitz whos ya bitchhhh
that whole run is why were 90
the alualu alleyoop
need to get some points of that turnover and put these jags away early
sick block ben lol
had me in the first half connor ngl
conner channeling a little bit of barry sanders there

running 50 yards for a 16 yard gain
that was a theres the hole hit the hole no no no okay wait okay yes kind of run
ben the bus driver roethlisburger
sack this fucker keep the streak alive
wait this one announcer guy is ian but its actually ian not eean
holy shit
impressive as hell by dj
fucking hands
ive been waiting all day to say this

steelers now entering the heinz red zone
wow what a catch
im starting to think that maybe panicking in the first quarter might have been premature
thats great coverage but an even better effort by diontae
wow flava flav has really let himself go
lol that steelers fan chilling in the overhauls
edmunds has leveled up
were now leading the league in ints
ohhh ben i think we saw that happen just a couple games ago
whelpthat suckedoh wellonto half 2
gets bumped off the route yeah thats called pi dude
how was that not dpi dude shoved him away
when i saw ben step up in the pocket i thought it for sure was a td
that was the ugliest throw ive ever seen from ben lol he heaved his whole body into that int
ben the goat tackler
we still get the ball to start the second half ben tried to do too much but hes ben so not shocked
cowher sending a message out to all the fuckboi fans lol
2nd half goals sack juju td and another mapletron td
the hell kind of juice did berry drink during those weeks he had off this season
fuck randy fichtner
stop calling the draw play please just remove it from the playbook at this point
cmon the sack streak needs to stay alive
84s helmet tho lol
thank god hes walking
i can see joe walking and jumping around on the sideline he looks good
lol
fuck this tent right here
sackkkkkk
sack streak lives on
the streak is alive
the disrespect from the pa said his name wrong
hopefully not a serious injury
ok juju bd td lets go
tee higgins has been good for the bengals this year but they should have used that 2nd round pick on an offensive lineman you need to protect your qb i hope hes ok
no booing from pittsburgh fans par for the course as we arent classless
cincinnati where quarterbacks go to die
jfc can we please just let ben do his thing how much failureevidence do we need that the oc blows
that scream came from joe in washington just took awhile to hear it in jacksonvillebut in all seriousness i hope he has a speedy recovery
fucking chick fil a showing ads on sunday
really wish theyd have taken the points at the end of the half id feel better about this dogshit playcalling if they were up 3 possessions rather than 2
im guessing ray ray saw something the camera didnt he pointed to his right
4rh and 1 nah 4th and 6 going for it
how is randy not fired
2nd and 15 throw behind the los is basically the same issue as a 2nd and 15 run
i dont like seeing this offense stall over and over again against an inferior and injury ridden defense
they said jags qb could have been a pro baseball player after this game i think hes going to wish he had tried that
just me or did the chippiness and shoving stop after halftime shit was getting ugly
bud brought a body bag
that was the manliest tackle ive ever seen
lots of no calls holding pi etc
i swear 27 on the jags keeps grabbing our receivers jerseys if im recalling the player right hes done it every time
feel like they couldve called pi on that one if they called the one on edmunds earlier
dude claypool is a pi magnet
ive never seen more opponents have players get injured
i like how that ref debated throwing the flag on the steelers sideline lol
everyone after claypool gets injured

keep that in mind ravens
claypool the corner killer
oh man i think that defender was hurt and trying to hold on to anyone to stay up
maybe putting 59 dbs on a 64 238lb receiver isnt a great idea
okthis is getting dangerouswin by this minor score and get outta there
yo keep juju out let him get some rest
did juju get hurt stepping on the officials flag

weird timing
you guys need to chill out its 203 they are a professional football team that almost beat the packers last week
jags are literally killing themselves trying to get back in this thing
another oneeeee
finally gave watt a holding call
lets go edmunds hell of a pick
finally call a hold
terrell edmunds dpoy
so thats what has to be done for them to call a hold against tj got it
lets go edmunds
just grabbed it lol
terrell baby
holy shit edmunds
edmunds has made a huge leap this year and i hope fans can finally stop shitting on him
wow what a fucking pick
picksburgh
its time to admit that terrell edmunds has become a quality safety
titans in the red zone
im starting to feel bad for luton any other defense and he might be having an okay day
if they cant score we cant lose
so we are up 273

can yall stop bitching now
ravens might lose to the titans lol
i fucking love seeing us throw with a 2 score lead with 7 minutes left put these teams away and dont let them back in it
titans lead the ravens
pull ben put in the reindeer

man that feels nice to say without it being a criticism
how good is this fucking team though i know this isnt the chiefs but this teams only real weakness ive seen for more than a quarter at a time is run blocking
damnnnnnnnnn were really spoiled to be sad about not having that be a pick six lmao
thats mason rudolphs music
2 ints for each of our safeties today
dont like juju limping around esp on a short week against the ravens
let mason throw
they said juju is fine to go back in if needed cut to him hobbling on the sideline
anyone here that lady screaming happy birthday
you know dasher and dancer and prancer and vixen
comet and cupid and donner and blitzen
but do you recall
the most famous reindeer of all
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games
then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
rudolph with your nose so bright
wont you guide my sleigh tonight
then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
youll go down in history
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
had a very shiny nose
and if you ever saw it
you would even say it glows
all of the other reindeer
used to laugh and call him names
they never let poor rudolph
join in any reindeer games
then one foggy christmas eve
santa came to say
rudolph with your nose so bright
wont you guide my sleigh tonight
then how the reindeer loved him
as they shouted out with glee
rudolph the rednosed reindeer
youll go down in history
i recognize none of these numbers
smile in the sunshine juju my man youll be good
dude that girl is a keeper
this game has gone well titans got it tied up with buttimore get that coin toss boys put us wayyyyy ahead of them
did you postpone your marriage or did covid19
no trap games here time to roast some ratbirds for thanksgiving 100
meh id rather have them take the home run shot than 3 tbh
im not gay or whatever but id have sex with chase claypool
still no flag

refs are a joke
lol ratbirds
im sitting in line to get tested for covid so this game thread is my current lifeline
back with chinese food dogs and myself are in our jerseys good weed is ready to go and the victory preroll is on standby

lets fucking do this
okey wait when do i start panicking
huge hold on mondeaux on that big run
bend dont break
good stop there lets go boys
ill take them just putting three on the board

now lets hope the offense doesnt come out weak
jags have nothing to lose definitely need to be aware of crazy stupid big gains on trick plays
its a little weird a qb as big as ben has so many balls swatted down at the line
i hate playing jacksonville so much
welp he was due for a miss boz still balling out this year
announcers jinx
well he had to miss eventually at least it wasnt a do or die situation i love me some boz
honestly hate kicking fgs in their territory
i blame charles davis 100 for that miss and im still happy we have him over vilma
i wish i could punch both the announcers right now
you know id be pretty happy if these announcers shut up so we could watch the rest of the game in silence
the nfl has to do something about their announcers im glad pat mcafee said something these guys are atrocious and it gets worse on the bad games
how many shows does cbs have about the fbi i swear theres like 10 per year
is there a stat for a qb with most tipped passes by defensive line i have a feeling this year that bens balls have unusual ratio of being touched by defensive lineman anyone has any insight is it something about his technique
ok offense needs to score a td now
defense is going balls to the wall
that qb is ballsy for a rookie i bet hes got at least one int in him today hes going to be overconfident after having a decent start
you can tell how terrified lutton is of the pass rush and its fueling me
2nd and 10 runs why just why
why cant we just play an 81 team instead
everyone givin up already we got this guys
bud looks like a crazy man out there today jeez
randy trying his best to get praise from bill cowher at half time what a horribly unimaginative oc he is remember when we would mix things up a few years ago when we were lighting the league up on offense why dont we try a little bit of that maybe mix in some no huddle and let run run pass punt take a break for a while
is matt canada a viable option at oc loved watching his team at maryland
aahhh buddddd hes having a game thoooooo
lol wentz 50yard int returned for td i know its the browns but hey theyre not winning the division
heyward in coverage lol
our defense is eating wake tf up offense
annoying how slow we can start at times but we just arent going to lose this no need to panic
chill people its only 30 lots of time
oh my god the list of side effects on this commercial is longer than the rest of the commercial
diontae johnson is really making a name for himself
how the fuck did conner turn a surefire loss into a minor gain
the run run pass has killed every drive
simmer down yung padawans
so were moving the ball through the air and yet we run on two consecutive plays honestly should be throwing on every play with all the depth at wr if we want to run the football then thats when do short throws
claypool being on the sideline on 3rd and long is insane
gets to their side of the field
having luck with passing with a run sprinkled in
run run pass field goal
lets run our power back outside and our speed back inside its brilliant trust me
time to take the 2nd and long runs out of the playbook

time to take the 2nd and long runs with notyourstartingrb out of the playbook and incinerate them stalled out two drives
hold but whatever
how the fuck are they calling ahold against tj

fuck already
yall see watt get choked on that 3rd down
me fucwoooonoooo
watt got mugged
jardiance lower your risk of heart attack

side effects include literal ass explosion
juju is a tank
claypool roty
i knew the big play to claypool would connect this week
theyre having so much fun out there
chase god damn claypool

we are really handing the ball off to mccloud now but thank god for mapletron
claypool is going to be a legend
hell yeah claypool td

10 tds 10 games and hopefully now the 10th win of the season
mapletronnnn
holy fuck i love claypool lmao 10 damn touchdowns and hes not a top ten rookie lmaooo
roethlisberger perfectly thrown

x200b

touchdown steelers
lets go claypoolllll
claypool is damn near a cheat code
yessss great throw by ben to the best rookie in the league
that birthday celebration lool
we still worried about ben rubbing his elbow or nah
big ben is looking accurate today
i love our tall boy
mapletron
lets go d
so that rakuten commercial just gonna slide thru with no comments eh
keeping the tradition to only enter gt when we scored a td

well hello fam lets go
boston hill and groman sounds like a law firm
steve nelson penalized for getting punched in the face
he fucking punched him wtf
i mean that shouldve been a penalty on nelson but really nothing on jax for punching a dude in the face
the shove was stupid and deserving of a penalty but isnt throwing a punch a straight ejection
holy shit we are going to have a serious brawl b4 halftime at this rate
fuck ya minkah
minkah fitzmagic
update minkah just made me hard again
alualu baby
yes minkah
bah gahd thats minkah fitzpatricks music
i turn the game on and see the turnover
i love the good old announcer curse

theyre still in this if they score
i thought was time for an interception hehehe
nose for the football cant be taugtt
ben sprung that run
ben with that block wow
ben thought about throwing a block down but then thought better
minkah has some kind of sixth sense or something man he just always seems to be in the right place at the right time
can minkah sign my soul please
lmao at this sub saying conner sucked last week when today is just more proof our run blocking is complete doodoo
alualu is making hargraves departure a total nonissue
guys diontae johnson is pretty good
steelers water girl is thick af
ben is making throws today
nice grab
helluva catch by diontae
i guess dj is the man today
our receiving corps is sneakily one of the best in the nfl
what a fucking catch dj
are you shitting me what a fucking catch
go dj thats my dj
djjjjjj
holy shit what a fuckin catch
dj nice recovery on the bobble
now that is how we do it
lets go needed that td before the half
its steely mcbeam
i like the flava flav style steelers logo necklace on that dude
so sick of these announcers labelling what is clearly dpi as good coverage
57 takeaways since last season jesus
rsteelers is in shambles
ill take those picks all day but i hope we get a sack at some point want to break that record for consecutive games with a sack two games away right now
lol they just push washington away to get an easy int and hoped the refs didnt call it jesus
big ben and shoe string tackles name a better duo
all of bens interceptions this year have been inconsequential
is that not dpi i mean he hit him off his route as the ball was in the air
at least ben got the tackle and saved 7 the other way
i liked how we were going balls to the wall trying to score at the end of the half
that really wasnt a terrible throw from big ben
im honestly more happy that they didnt take it back for a pick six there than disappointed about the interception he was flying to our side of the field
my favorite rookie dionte washington
ravens cant beat a good team change my mind
that shit is all fitchner absolutely ridiculous how he just keeps trying it
berry is really redeeming himself these last few weeks
run run pass punt
that 3 and out was my bad guys didnt have my beer ready
runrunpass

the randy special
run run pass
tmobile who says you cant have it all

me literally you when my phone loses signal as soon as i walk into my office
im starting to get worried that or sack streak might end today they cant get there before he gets it out
fuck id rather be 91 then lose valuable players especially with ravens game thursday
he walked off which is a good sign
great seeing haden walk off
haden is jogging on the sideline praise lord
okay good to see haden up and walking around on the sideline
we need a sack cmon defense

edit we got a sack
sack
i really wish tj would just throw a fit to the refs because hes being hugged on every fucking play
my god the holding
sack streak stays
nice hold on tj there
stephon tutt lmao
joe burrow just got carted off hate to see it

edit looks like left knee
almost our entire defense has a chance to be allpro this year thats pretty crazy

injuries they suck
sucks that burrow got injured like that hes a real talent bungles need to ge a real oline whatever it takes
i love that even though this is a testy game our guys still showed support to josh allen
damn armed guard outside the blue tent necessary
go for it
shit burrow looked like he was in some serious pain there

bengals might have finally broken burrow
so no conner at all in the 2nd half cool cool cool cool cool cool
remember when people were saying ben was the worst qb in the division lol almost forgot about that
shouldnt chickfila also refrain from advertising on sunday as well
wow awful spot
what kind of spot is that he clearly got it
our o line does not block for shit on 1st down runs
1st down run for 0 yds fuck yeah
yes a 215 screen i love it
3rd and 13 seems like a run play from randy
this offense is one of the most puzzling offenses in the league sometimes they look great other times they look clueless
18 team and we have had like 3 3rd down conversions out of however many
can we score some points
are we just playing now to get to thursday
lmao that choke slam
i mean he kinda hit him the head but no one say it too loudly
i cant believe i didnt notice that whenever somebody else gets a sack tj copies their celebration
if we had a run game we could just take 7 minutes off the clock but noooo
pounce running down to juju to pick him up says everything
geez every other play in the nfl has a player injured this season this is almost feels like the hunger games
we just got flagged for that but no call again
how many times are they going to get away with pulling the jersey this game
conner is playing well i dont get why were going 5 wide on 3rd and 1
not gonna lie bros this game is kinda boring haha
so do the ref squads let our opposing teams know how many penalties they get to have before the game

i mean im sure they already tell them that they spot them 20 holes against tj but
claypool is brutally murdering these dbs
claypool is like feast or famine
dam finally that was like 3 plays in a row
claypool must have some sort of curse on these dbs if they touch him
about time the refs had eyes
jesus christ the jags are dropping like flies
claypool is a allowing ben to channel his inner flacco
jesus everyone is getting hurt today this is awful
db got hurt so he threw himself at claypool to stop a free td smart play tbh
what is claypool made of dbs are going down like flies when they try to cover him
lets score and get our boys out the game and get a head start on some rest for an early week against baltimore
did juju really get hurt on a penalty flag
think about it do we actually need refs to throw flags
dicks wings
3 score game 100 coming lads
the jags field is fucking terrible wth
offense needs to be better this jags defense is god awful and decimated with injuries
oh look we scored in the 2nd half
i wanted juju to be more involved but ben doesnt seem to throw to him much
juju looked very uncomfortable on the sideline hope hes okay
3 position lead with 10 minutes left here comes the fuckery
is it raining again or is my steam just shit
theres literally a jaguar body down every play
nice int way to keep an eye on the ball
edmunds again holy fuck
finally called one
edmonds
two for edmunds bittccchhhh
holy hell edmunds what a grab
why even have an offense
as much as you bitches bitch about the offense give the defense love
edmunds is the man
terrell here we go
lol fuck the ratbirds way to go titans
umm why is ben still in the game
steelers at 100

what did it cost

a first round pick
go titans
mason rudolph time now
i saw steelers fans on twitter crying saying they hope this is just them playing down to their competition lol if this playing down then ill take it
lets put mason in we good
ebron has been really really good for us
im so happy for the team but i feel awful for juju right now its one thing to be on the field and just not be the one making plays but being injured is different especially on his birthday
im really impressed with suttons progress this year
whats it gonna be luton sack another inteception maybe a fumble
that stats just mean lmao
am i a homer or does tj get held every play legit question
two for two baby minkah and edmunds with two interceptions each
minkah is kinda disproving that theory that dbs are wide receivers who cant catch
were just being mean at this point lol
oh look the human victory cigar is back out there
safeties absolutely feasting on luton today
edmunds can not lead the team in ints in a game by himself

minkah
rudolph time again oh man insult to injury
more interceptions than points allowed lol
glad we put the 2nd team in gotta be ready with the a team for thursday
my lord safeties are on fire right now
we want bama
come on titans
this team fucking rules
at least masons getting muchneeded experience while giving ben a welldeserved rest
how bad our oline is at run blockingis very very very concerning
i woke up right around game time and went to the living room to watch the game just then i hear a loud crashing noise from somewhere in the house i find that it was in my bedroom that my mirror came crashing down and shattered everywhere and some glass was on the bed i was like holy shit the steelers are going to get crushed today lol

thankful for this
ravens to ot
damnit titans defense that was a brutal defensive stand
i love the energy our locker room has now its a far stretch from what it was before
cmon titans take my fucking energy
that girls a keeper
if you cant find a woman who would postpone their honeymoon or wedding for the steelers then whats the point that dude better hold onto her and never let go
oh course the announcers fucking jinxed us
as soon as the fucking announcer said chris boswell is on a hot streak i knew he was gonna miss yeeeesh announcers curse
so this is gonna be another game where tj watt is just allowed to be tackled to the ground to make things fair huh
so much negativity here were up 14 relax
claypool has injured 3 dbs today by landing on them is this like part of our strategy lol
fuck you ian eagle
why do commentators always jinx kickers with their stats i hate it here
change in plans

spent too much on beer and xanax watching the stillers
let ben run the offense im sick of our awful oc
are we just playing conservative and letting the defense do work were not in a big enough lead to be calling shit plays like these
let that be a lesson to you nobody commits pass interference five times in a row without a flag on my watch
greetings from the stadium where its about 70 black and gold
wings ordered mug chilled lager ready tshirt on

here we go
i got this 11 christmas ale ima die go stillers
well
pssst yinz gotta tackle robinson pass it on
the sky is falling
patented belly to back sackplex by tj
honestly that drive being a field goal gives me huge hope this game any other time i wouldve looked at how that went and said they def getting a td already
keep blitzing him luton looks awful against the blitz
not too bad of a drive considering the 12 yard run was one of the biggest holds of all time on mondeaux
theres been pressure on almost every single play if we get up on them and make them pass its over
well that was interesting
lmao bold
anyone got the stats on how many batter balls at the line this season seems higher than normal
of course that happens when they talk about his streak
why the fuck did they have to jinx it
dp a fake since they iced us
perfect weather and he shanks it cmon man not the jags
these announcers are annoying af
diontae johnson reminds me of regigas has pretty good stats but hes got that slow start
jax gives up the most points to opposing teams on opening drives of course we fail to score against them

just like teams like dallas gave up the most rushing yards per game and we had no running game against them figure it out fitchner
fuckin troll announcers
i am not worried starting terrible is our thing it appears
lol at the people blaming the announcers for a jinx when that snap was absolute trash
hey there are steelers fans herelets show bored children

fuck you cbs
so


gonna be one of these games
fuck it time for dline to feast
holy shit its just awesome to watch mike hilton juke a lineman and get in the backfield to get the tackle so important against the run
the steelers really do get all of the shitty teams best punches
one of these days that blitz is going to smoke this kid
lord the jags are horrible at reacting to a blitz lol
the blitz is working against this kid
i think ray ray should have let that one bounce
not rayrays finest moment
killer field position our first drive not so much our second

we got this here we go
is anyone listening to steelers radio i just started listening this year it sounds like theres someone on mic who i dont recognize does anyone know what im talking about or can provide context
happy birthday son of ben
conner doing exactly what he needs to pushing outside to open lanes before cutting upfield being decisive using quick cuts to set up blocks etc
chase the dude claypool
shit pouncey got rolled up a little there
jet sweep isnt working try something else fichtner
i saw that run coming fichtner running on 1st is predictable
run run pass and randy fichtner name a more iconic duo
berry did some training when he didnt have a job
every nonsteeler this week why are you scared
did berry just not take his job seriously until he got canned
our gameplan is always try to force the run then it turns into ben just do your thing
i thought we were getting a safety
luton why do you run from defensive hugs
80 yard punt
at least the defense came to eat today
did ray ray forget how to return punts
that punt was ridiculous
man this defense is just electric to watch
just keep running youll break one sooner or later just stop going backwards
ben needs to take a shot deep ive seen a couple times where its one on one on the outside and they pulled the safety in
im working today is the sky falling yet thread isnt hyper negative
are you depressed try this medicine it might make your immune system attack your organs which will lead to death but the couple of weeks youre upbeat is totally worth it before you die from organ failure

the fuck are these ads
conner runs 38 yards for a gain of 2
mcfarland is a good back but he seems better in space with the amount of speed he has
gentry down again damn it

ebron stay strong
run run incomplete again
im fine if we win with 8 fgs

a win is a win
fichtners playbook run run pass punt
randy run run pass fichtner
i literally sit here and yell at my tv for them not to run it again on 2nd and long
watching randys play calling is like slamming your head into a brick wall
man that run run pass on their side of the field will work eventually s
the run run pass when were on the verge of scoring is infuriating its not the wrong call all the time but its the wrong call when bens hot and youre in striking distance
could you imagine this offense with someone like andy reid calling plays or just let ben do it ffs
out of the jinx business my fuckin ass
let ben loose
theres gotta be a point where big ben just has to stop listening and start calling the plays
remember this offense does a lot to figure out what works were gonna tag this defense patience
i cant imagine how annoying these next gen stat commercials are for your team when they are having an awful system
im not at all worried about this game not even in the slightest but jesus fucking christ lets finish a drive
i do love all the omg we cant run people you have such bad football knowledge you cant start the season with multiple hundred rusher games and be bad at running you can scheme poorly and lose your big time blocking te blame randy you are all very used to that
luton is getting rid of these balls so fast the moment he senses pressure he wants no part of our front seven
is tj ever gonna get a holding call
most egregious hold of all time on tj cannot believe that wasnt called
why does watt get harassed every play
gotta say this games going exactly how i thought it would so far classic jags game if we are still playing like this after half time then ill start to sweat
id like one 71 yard td pass please
in the words of mike tomlin lets not try to manufacture a run game today for balance lets win the game
yall watt wont get holding calls against he just wont hes too athletic you can literally call holding against him every play and you obviously cant do that as an official so you have to just not call any
worshington coming up big
warshington
he can run a two minute offense at any point of the game

what if theres 10 seconds left on the clock
he fucking looped it you hear that boys
mapletron
thats ten maple syrup bottles
this rookie is broken good
td claypool
glad i started chase
chasee
mapletron
oroy
happy bday hahahah
perfect throw from ben
mapletron
chaseeeee
claypool roty
that was a good deep ball by ben
mapletrooooon lets goooo
look at the success that they have the instant that they go to the no huddle why does randy wait so long for us to try it we should be up by a couple of scores at least
the reflection on that mask scared me lmao
now we gotta get that sack d
that is unbelievable
why was baby chark doing the same thing not a penalty also
nelson what are you doing man
punching a helmet such a smart move bruh
how is a push worthy of a flag because the offense retaliated and our guy started it makes no sense
calm down boys no need to get tossed from a game against the jaguars
minkah so disrespectful i love it
steve nelson needs to get his head in the game wtf man
minkah had enough and put that run down
hell yeah minkahhhhhhh
fuck yes
alright fitz
hey mother fucker think you can just make a clean tackle fuck you fight me
hold em for three
i love minkah i didnt know this but evidently my type is splash play safeties
you know jacksonville was talking shit to our team probably talking all this you aint going defeated today cmon boys
how is minkah always in the right spot lmao
lmao minkah
its borderline suspicious how perfectly positioned minkah is for these picks the man can predict the future i think
blocking ben is best ben


lol
i love this fucking defense talk your shit dont let this 18 team try to act tough
fuck yeah minkah
minkah motherfucking fitzpatrick
minkahhhhhh
lets fucking go minkah talk yo shit
barry conner
conner is having a nice game
minkahhhhhhhhhhhhhh i love you
finally we capitalize

2 missed picks but we really only needed this one
did connor get faster
see flair for comment
redzone d cant be fucked with
ben throwing blocks lmao
conley punching the air on the sideline rn
ben sometimes you are better off actually throwing a shoulder or cut block instead of that fake block you do haha
mink mink mink baby
you aint getting through ben
how is that not an additional 15 tackled by the fucking jugular
big blockin ben
that ben block tho
conner is fucking putting on a show today

big ben with the block too
thats my first rounder
ben blocking better than our oline today
remember saying minkah was a no show we stupid some times
best block by ben ive ever seen
10 points on those 2 upcoming drives would be nice and i could relax a little
ben charging his lazer
damn big ben out there lookin like daniel jones the goat
what a fast half
this team is special man holy shit this is great
dj is it guys
johnson making it look easy

torch the clock for the score and then start the second half by doing what thats right putting another seven on the board
awesome effort
yo catch of the week
holy fuck dj
johnson that was sick
thats an insane catch from dj there
holy balls what a catch
dj is such an anomaly

hell drop something easy but make nuts catches like that
benny with the jets

lets go
fuuuuuuck yeah fuck jacksonville
i think our receivers are good
you guys we look really good right now
still thinking about that catch holy moly and now we got the td
thats benny snell football baby
i swear they always have snell as the power back but shouldnt it be conner i wonder why they do that
ya aint playin mason rudolph anymore schobert
and we get the ball after the half
no matter how good or bad they are always feels good kicking the shit out of the jags fuck duval
diontae is a monster
sickest catch since ab was on the squad reminded me of that chiefs catch where it was tipped and he recovered for the td
as a steelers fan that makes me happy as a conner fantasy owner that is absurdly upsetting
you benny snell football


me an intellectual benjamin snell national football league participant
alright yeah the worlds gone insane edmunds got a pick

im very happy about it
defense
guys this is just a friendly reminder

defense wins championships
guys get in here edmunds did a thing
we look like a 90 team right now
that was an absolute dime to edmunds
terrell has bloomed into a beautiful daisy
conner with 69 yards
claypool just runs by guys didnt the draft experts say he was supposed to be slow
does any wr get held more than chase
damn thats sucks not too mad at it though
would have been nice to have the pts but not upset
that pi really saved them cuz claypool had him beat easily for that td
we wouldve gotten only 3 more points why not try to go for the td we get the ball back after half anyway
ben is an elite defensive player
i mean a full shove to the chest but i wont complain
these jags uniforms look like the villain team in a comingofage football movie
bens our best 2 way player nice tackle
yeah i see what ben was thinking woulda ben a tudder if washington wasnt blocked off
straight up shoved back washington how was that call missed
wash tried to sell dpi instead of playing the ball there wasnt really on ben
how have we not gotten a sack yet lol wtf
it looked like washington may have been trying to sell that bump a little oh well solid 2nd quarter all around
how does lamar go 411 for 54 yards in a half and they still have 14 points
say that pi gets called do we try to punch it with the ball on the goal line or take the three with only having one play before the half

i am good taking that shot we did boz has been hugging the left upright and already had a miss and i would lean on a pi being called there but since there was already one on the drive the refs already met the maximum amount of help to the steelers in a game
ive got the ravenstitans game on the tv and the steelers game on my laptop and the halftime shows of the two are almost synced up word for word it is wild
212 run
not a fan of how theyre using mcfarland
we run the same run plays every game no shit we arent doing well
running on 2nd and 12 okay
what is this playcalling
if we are going to give the ball to mcfarland it needs to be in space they are misusing him
2 runs for 1 yards niceeee
i mean defense is easy when you know whats coming
james conner averaging over 8 a carry but we dont even have him on the field
obligatory randy should be calling plays for peewee football and not the nfl
tf was that playcalling
terrible play calling
berry starting to put up some good punts after realizing he can be cut and life outside the steelers sucks
just so ive got this straight mcfarland up the middle conner to the outside

and a play designed for ray ray

doesnt make a ton of sense to me
underwhelming drive there jet sweeps havent works for 34 weeks draw on 2nd and long because steelers and heave it deep and hope on 3rd not really in agreement there
at this point im pretty sure theres a clause in fichtners contract that if he calls run run pass a certain amount of times per game he will get a bonus
what is that facemask yikes
give him that special shot ben gets
blue medical tent mic drop lol
defense hungry for the sack
he lifts weights
no mortal can keep joe haden down
uh oh i think our sacks record is gonna come to end today

edit phew
hes good thank the bosgod oh this dark clouds just dissipate away and now were good
watt just gave the jax rb a helmet noogie
sack
sack baby
there it is
yes theres our streak
the streak is alive and well
sack streak continues
the right tackle jumped early again but i think the officials are getting bored
the streak goes on
sack finally the streak continues
steeler sacks are like thanos inevitable
tj giving helmet nougies haha
everybody no sacks for the steelers today hmmm

sack streak the reports of my demise have been greatly exaggerated
watt and ogunbowale hugging it out on wisconsin
steelers doing alright i want more defense
the bengals already killed joe burrow
haden back on the sideline now looks good
ahhhh
we gonna see mike glennon soon
we have to no we must fire fichtner at the end of the season hes as bright as a 2 watt lightbulb
haden back on the field for the steelers
chick fil a ads on a sunday is just taunting at this point
watch the fake
dupree just dislodged more lung material out of luton then a doctor aspirating a covid patient
why the fuck is the offense back on the field after losing 5 yards
this is why theyre 18
bengals sub doesnt want anyones best wishes for burrows nice meltdown over there
how do we get the worst commentators every single game
connor with the disrespect
a stiff arm and a stare down by jc
that flag was thrown so late
their secondary is basically all rookies why cantdont we throw past the line of scrimmage
oh mama
luton would like this game to end now please
lutton seems to have a good attitude about getting hit
tj soooo close still having a quiet game statistically only one tackle and a few almost sacks
that banner should say sacksburg
bud got him like a character next to a window in a zombie movie
grave digging dupreeee
imagine that play action on first down nets 9 yards
duprees arm just appeared and dragged the qb to the underworld
bring bud brought a buddy back 2020
ju ju hurtok maybe we should play it safea win by one is still a win thursday
another helmet to helmet against juju
damn juju hurt there
ebron on 3rd down so hot
claypools timing was off on that one

watch ebron
finally a flag
finally we get a pi on claypool
another dead jag
this game is a drag
does anyone have the stats on how many pi calls claypool has drawn its got to be a record or close to it
ok so are these guys actually getting hurt or do they just not want to play the 4th quarter of this game
jesus these poor jags are dropping like flies
claypool assassinating their secondary
corners have been breaking themselves against claypool all season
sure all teams are mostly the same in facilities except dont forget that the bengals dont have an indoor training facility
claypool taking out all of the jags secondary out
claypool out here ending careers
jesus claypool is literally held on every pass thats some scary respect from defenders
corner killer claypool
players gonna stop covering claypool they get hurt every time
claypool is like domino from xforce guys just knocking themselves out to take him down
to flag or not to flag the ref went full shakespeare there
thank god the jaguars dont have an actual qb
wouldve been a touchdown actually guy blew out his knee and tripped claypool what is with all these knee injuries this year hoping the best for that guy
fuck juju injured
id like to thank espn fantasy for allowing taysom hill to be tight end eligible this week
did juju step on the flag
did juju step on the flag
that field looks like poop
butler probably thinks eifert is still playing for the bengals
ahh i see eifert is still built like balsa wood
finally
and another hold on tj
tj does just engulf people on tackles
the d is locking things down now
edmunds actually going off for once
bruh edmunds again save those picks for more important games please
holy fuck they actually called one
what a pick by ed
that is filthy
edmunds got a taste for blood lmao big playmaker all of a sudden
in the rain int
that was a snag
trap game who
championship defense
another one for terrell i predicted that he would get an int but two is good as well
their qb is so bad its actually blowing my mind
titans
just soak this shit up boys were not the prettiest but this sure is beautiful
edmunds has been straight up excellent this year glad to see him get some big plays finally
can you stop trying to concuss all our players thanks
handling this game the way were supposed to i feel good
100 and titans just took the lead
and game time to put all the backups in
and tennessee is up baby
lets go now rest our guys for thursday solid win
take everyone out now put in full practice squad
i dont feel good so i cant yell i just shook my weed jar loudly to celebrate this td
time to take out every starter
funny thing on that td was conner was finally gonna have a lane to run through
rest em up we got a big one on thursday
whomever had the steeler d in fantasy


congrats on hitting the lottery
minkah both safetys with 2 pick games love to see it
4 ints lol
can the steelers blow out anyone
gg baby double minkah seals the deal
lol in the jags pregame the hosts were saying that ben needed a 5 int game like back in 2007 for them to win i believe they were calling out the wrong qb
come on titatns
luton is now at 109 qbr
minkah fitzpicktrick
juju stop walking around god
well 100 is terrifying
65 65 65 65 65 65

65 65 65 65 65 65

65
lets get a derek watt handoff
jujus been on the injury with toe and foot injuries through the season hoping that hes all good for next week
thanks tad dickman
luton is bad yo
they really want luton to throw 5 picks
is there a single jacksonville fan in those stands
jags getting clamped by our 2nd team d lmao
looking like ot in baltimore
tied in baltimore
lmao titans and ravens going into overtime
kick the fg lol
i wanna see them have rudolph throw the damn thing why have him on the roster if we cant trust him to get a first down with a nearly 30 point lead and 2 minutes left lol
cmon tits 15 seconds two timeouts you can drive down and get a fg

nvm they just going to ot
imagine thinking we cant beat any team with this defence they are orgasmic
mason is so good at kneeling and handing the ball off
who is undefeated
juju is still limping
they dont even trust him to hand it to the running back anymore smh lol
100 boys
come on tits please
wooooooo
i still hate these announcers but that little ben plays juju when he catches passes story was just adorable
finchter is the biggest idiot on this planet this is what he did this drive
1 conner is getting hot take him out for our third string running back on second down
2 the passing game is gaining steam two straight runs and make it a 3rd and 7
fucking idiot
oh fuck please not joe
from the bengal sub fuck they finally did it they finally let him die
go for it fuck it
edmunds needs to be cut
worst play call ever scoring a td is so terrible fire randy
i placed such a large wager on big ben to win cpoy it was a fucking lock now ive come to find out its actually an award for the best story not performance and participation trophy alex smith will probably win what a joke
yall ready to watch us make a 3rd string rookie look like brady
stop running on second and long oh my fuck
stop trying to force the run
wow that was a dangerous play also that bump on washington looked illegal as hell
lmao ben loves throwing picks in the end zone as the 1st half expires
you know when ben throws those interceptions at the end of halves or on third downs where its basically a punt i dont get upset about those directly but it irritates me that theyre used against him as a quarterback on every rating and ranking that comes out whether its pff or qbr or just regular old passer rating
haden walked off the field
im blaming this injury on randys shit ass play calling
haden has apparently popped up and jogged off under his own power
burrows leg went 90 degrees t h e w r o n g w a y
our play calling is so fucking garbage
i miss d bush for the run game
its rudolph time
we are playing against a secondary filled with hotdog vendors and equipment men yet we can barely move the ball so puzzling to me this shit wont cut it against good teamsand theres an enron td as i am typing to make me shut my fat fng mouth lol
ugh minkah is good and all but think of what we could get gotten with that mid 1st round pick s
are alualu and hilton playing today
im having a hard time getting fired up for this one just dont lose or get injured
beer ready check steelers ready check win in the pocke check

if anyone doesnt have cable tv check for possible streams they tend to work few minutes after game starts
so


did we lose the run stop d playbook
must be nice to be able to run like that
james robinson is gonna get 100 yds on the ground
its so early im not worried in the slightest
forcing them to kick


steelers goin to a supabowl
i know nothing about this jake crouton guy but i hate him already
defense got it together a little later but well take that at lol
that fg just doubled the amount of opening drive points weve given up all season
not a bad series that 3rd down conversion was basically unstoppable because it was such a perfect ball not gonna get too many of those
to those of you thinking this is going to be a bad game the only reason that they made a significant drive was because of a very well placed ball we should have no issue moving forward
pls just stay quiet doomers
that was almost as bad as the boswell soccer kick
no worries men i had on the wrong shirt its fixed now
ok
okay ill take it
i guess when youre 18 you just say fuck it
this thanksgiving im thankful for the jaguars incompetence
that was a pretty cool kick though
that was gonna be an interception if that wasnt tipped
literally exactly what conner needs to do use the stretch to find a hole upfield cut and go boom money all day if he can keep finding that
how many batted passes does ben have
stfu ian eagle
of course
pissed they still believe in icing the kicker even more pissed it work
commentator and graphic curse
fuck those announcers they put a hex on bosgod
yinzer christ i implore you to smite these ducking announcers
loving the pressure were getting on their qb definitely a big part of the gameplan today
luton looks like he needs a good sacking
i wouldve rather played the chiefs today
defense is waking up
lmfaooo we arent going to get a sack because anytime theres even an ounce of pressure this qb just fucking sends the ball flying
attaboy james stiffarm that jaggo
conner im goin fast mama
jfc


jesus fing conner
25 yards from conner yes please
big boy run james
happy birthday juju
is our run blocking that bad
well this is going as expected
yeah this is pretty much what i expected so far
why throw that no way thats going for a 1st
great punt
whenever fichtner runs the ball on 1st and 2nd down we always punt yet he does it time and time again the guy is a moron
vince pick 6
pouncey being examined in the tent as per snr
bud has been living in the backfield so far only a matter of time before they get a sack
are we just looking past them to thursday
our dline is flying around the field today
jeez thats a punt
offense wake up please jesus christ
i love tunch i love him and its painful to listen but i love him it hurts my heart but im thankful for tunch
why did he look like switzer on that one
god this pass defense is making cream love seeing mike hilton back out there
mike hilton is insanely fast
hell of a fucking punt god damn
holy shit the punter lazered that shit down field

god im so happy looking at a wide receiver whos first thought is to hold on to the freaking ball
i thought that play was over when those defenders came unblocked kudos to conner
jc is doing all he can with the blocking hes getting
conner making wine out of fucking water this oline needs help
that probably wouldve been a weak pi call that wouldve came back and bit us later in the game anywah
conner having a game
i take back anything bad i said about conner the last 3 weeks
positive yards on a screen pass
per
nfloncbs
zach gentry in the locker room with a left leg injury eric ebron only te available right now steelers
anthony mcfarland run on 2nd and 9 what the fuck
gentry was in a total of 2 games had 0 impact and already injured safe to say we missed on him
has run run pass worked in the last four years
any other oc wouldve just given up on the run for this team and just accept the fate we cant run
how many 2nd and long runs are going to ruin good looking drives
claypool

that was great defense by that the rookie
seems like we are getting very little separation today over the middle and on these sideline routes also would prefer to see connor be the feature back today
everytime our rbs touch the ball on a runthe oline is already in the backfieldthey give no space to runit aint the backsthe oline just cant get it done against anybody apparently
i like macfarland but he needs the ball in space not on regular between the numbers runs sometimes i wonder if they could put a back in the slot and run a sweep sometimes to get them momentum with the ball
only a matter of time before the o starts scoring touchdowns the d is looking sharp were gonna be fine
we have the worst run blocking oline in all of football
somebody stop randy fichtner let the dude stand on the sideline and get paid let ben run this offense
very tired of randys completely transparent run run pass until ben goes fuck this and calls his own plays we should be destroying these guys
waswas that a hold on watt that didnt get called
oh man first bud and now nelson


a turnover is coming boys
tj just dragged down no call wtf
lord the hold on tj
at least the defense is on point
we gotta stop trying to get holding calls on tj hes officiated differently regardless of how unfair it is to him
2 dropped picks we seriously need to capitalize
watt was drug down by his jersey
a side effect is an infected taint jesus
watt needs to start crying for flags this is fucking ridiculous
juju laying the wood down
ive never heard unnecessary use of the helmet
holy shit juju hits so fucking hard
i love james washington actually hes good whenever hes out
what a fucking throw
so ive been really in to reading about myths and legends recently have any of you ever heard of something called a running game
mapletron
is that a deep pass
mapletron
the deep ball to claypool pays off
lets go
dat boi claypool
popped the cherry boys
hell yeah claypoool
washington james washington seven foot twenty washginton
goat
what a fucking throw
what a throw and goddamn catch
you know its bad at rb when mccloud knew how to run inside zone
wooooo
what a dime
nice deep ball on that one

claypoole is like cris carter he only catches tds
lets fucking gooooo
im feeling gooooooooood
oroy
claypoooool you fucken stud
claypool mother fuckas
that touchdown was bootyful
chaaaaase look what happens when we stop run run passing
boom headshot
nice celebration
mapletronnnn
if we can get up by a couple of scores then the defense can really feast
thats just stupid nelson
d taking this series off
you want to be mad that fitzpatrick tackled you hard

dont fight for extra yardage you wont get tackled hard
pushing punch push to the head
miscommunication nelson looking rough today
damn that was some mma shit
minkah
boys are ripe for a pick
good job for just walking away from that minkah didnt even look back
tackled him by the fucking neck wtf lol
about time we got a deflection pick
minkah saved us
that was a horse collar tackle if ive ever seen one
minka is angry today
god tier minkah
minkah every time lmfao
minkah
my dude minkah
who else but minkah
gotta love minkah
i like minkah
minkah baby
thats our first round pick
minkahhhhhhh
i see you minkah
minkah is literally always around the ball its amazing
conner doing his cj2k impression
lets fucking go
these commentators are jinxing the game for both sides
yessirrr lets go minkah baby shoutout to tyson for tipping it
lets stop running
lmao at ben blocking
he used ben to set a pick lmao
the issue with the run isnt conner its the blocking
the boys are amped now as am i
i was gonna say minkah needs to chill after he took that dude down with a spinebuster

fuck it keep it up minkah
james conner needs to go hurrrr deee durrrr
large benjamin
this feels so good after seeing how the jacksonville offense was jawing at us
what are the odds nature made has something to do with that nsp group
the defense has been great in this half seriously solid and coming up with the turnover when the jags were driving good job d

hell of a catch dj
great throw
two minute warning killed our momentum
what a catch
nice route dj really is reminiscent of mbc
dionte johnson
jesus diontae johnson is taking more dives than an over the hill boxer
but dionte always drops it on 3rd down
dj
great fucking catch dj
this wideout group making it super hard to know which dude is the best they one up each other all the time lmao
diontae will be our number one receiver mark my words
wow how did he get that
whattttttt helluva catch
dj is the truth if he can sort out the mental lapses he could be elite
give him the td my god i love dj
lynn swann is that you
talk about focus what a catch
holy shit dj balling
god damn

dj really on something else today
yes
when im playing gta i always take my cars to bennys
snell ya later
insane who is better johnson or claypool
that diontae catch was fucking beautiful
hell of a catch and focus by dj my fantasy team was hoping that was a touchdown lol
id like to see a sack this drive
edit that works too
lets go boys i wanna see 90 97 48 or 39 make a splash impact play
happy for the td but is james conner not capable of the high percentage 1 yard run feel like its not fair to him to not give him the run after the game hes playing
good pick by edmonds
see this is what youre supposed to do against an inexperienced backup qb
nicely done edmunds
lmfaooo edmunds
aaaaaaahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
okay second half they gonna be throwing a lot now better get that damn sack preferably 6 second half sacks
aaand thats why teams often just kneel out the half
that shit was thrown right to him this time i bet hes happy he finally got in on the turnovers everyone else is getting lol
edmunds get some you beautiful man
edmunds got his int
this game going to get ugly here we are going to be seeing the legend mason rudolph sooner or later
gotta get juju one here
edmunds had a pick super bowl confirmed
two tos left lets do this
69 yards nice
fuck that woulda been a great catch
the only bad thing about blowing out the jags so early is well have to endure rudolph for longer
i was looking at all our guys measurements on this mickdraft website and i didnt realize juju has bigger hands than deandre hopkins almost 11 inch hands thats why hes only got like two or three drops on the season
honestly a good penalty to take there for the jag he was beat
edmunds can finally talk to his rb brother about getting ints
edmunds got a pick every yinzer in this sub combusted lmaooo
oh no he was intercepted with 1 second left
teams always are interfering with chase
what the fuck ben
he pushed off
claypool got as many receiving yards as pi yards dude draws them all
ah oh well still up 173 that might of been bens worst thrown ball al year
big ben threw a pick oh well anyways we get ball at half lmao
we get the ball at half probs shouldve just kicked the fg but whatever
ben and end of half picks

a truly iconic duo
name a more iconic duo than ben and end of half endzone ints
woah wouldnt that be pi hugeeee pushoff
ben making that tackle is just amazing
lol washington got bodied wtf
ben and throwing picks in the end of the half name a more iconic duo
i dont like leaving points on the field but it was a pretty good first half all things considered
the shoe string tackle again
so maybe a dumb question but if a receiver pushes off like that its opi so why isnt it dpi if the cb pushes off on a jump ball
ben looking like hes chasing a colt
this is how this game should be going but not at all how i expected it to
ben might get shit on for that int but tbh from that angle behind the line they showed at the end washington really should have kept running right idk why he stopped

the defender pushed washington to the ground
how the fuck do you not call that interference
i cant believe taysom hill had like 19 regular season passes ever is 30 and they have jameis as a backup and hes actually performing 913 for 127 lol this is sean paytons wet dream
questionable last play guess the little hold at the end when ben tried to exit the pocket made him rush it given the play clock otherwise solid second quarter first one was your typical pittsburgh steelers 1st q action so no comments on that luton is as accurate in hitting his receivers as i am in hitting my life goals dont make him look good in any way and just finish the game early
where can i stream the game
i am not sure what to do now we are comfortably in the lead up two touchdowns against a 1 win team it feels like the game is cruising to an easy victory but history has always been that the jaguars will come back and give me a reason for taking bayer aspirin before the game
i no one gives a shit about other peoples fantasy teams but i have will fuller and i am going against deshaun watson and how in the fuck does watson have 26 points when his 1 receiver has 11
the fact that we have more rushing in a half than we did in each of the last three entire games
yes waves by kanye
what is it with 1st run 2nd run
everytime mcfarland is in the game they know he will get the ball
3 and out punt nice game plan out the half offense
i hate randy
ah yesrun run pass my old enemy
run run deep shot sigh
well that was lame can we just let ben run free already
its pretty ridiculous the difference between when ben is calling plays and when our oc calls plays
randy runs this offense like duck hodges is the qb not ben our fucking hall of fame qb playing the best football of his career
i wonder if there is no creativity in play calling because they dont want to show much to other opponents
passing opens up the run game for this group not the other way around not sure why they insist on forcing the opposite

i dont want to end up seeing mike glennon
guys we still need our sack
honestly id rather come out of this game healthy
hes walking boys good sign
not joe money haden
holy fuck bud is so fast
yards given and taken away
i love tj watt
haha there it is
the sack streak lives
sack streak continues
sack streak lives
fuck yeah there it is
the streak lives on
we got our sack boys
sack streak continues boys
sack baby
the streak continues
sack streak
tj giving nuggies
theres our sack nice
joe burrow looks like he has a season ending injury you could have just bet money that that was going to happen the bengals are such a bad team
streak is alive baby
theres a sack
need to drain the clock get a td and take the starters out here
lots of knee injuries this year damn
that gap commercial made no sense
randy has like 5 plays in his playbook gahd damn
lol nice try randy maybe the 3rd try will work
damn titans are supposed to be doing better
legit feel bad for the bengals
hadens fine thank god
you guys might have your weird as shit pharmaceutical ads but its refreshing not seeing a gambling ad every 30s
thats fucking stupid making allen limp walk into the locker room get him on the cart or stretcher
good job dupreeeeeee
yinz questioning our playcalling the fuck are these jagoffs doing
wtf is jax doing
did i just have a stroke
wtf are they doing
wtf is this mickey mouse bullshit i see before my very eyes
the announcers that made 0 sense lol
allen burrow and burkehead all just had their knees destroyed what the fuck is going on
gonna need to do a deep dive into the jags cheerleaders
lol jags 65 with that james connor power mullet
lmao that was meannn
connor sonned him
conner on his way to over 100 yards today the jags are the pallet cleanser that he needed to wash the last three weeks away
idiot jumped on the pile and hurt his own guy
whos ready for the run on second and 15

when was the last time we had a 100 yd rusher
our second half offense has been a bit underwhelming
jesus tj
the sack bros strike again
bud sacked him while the tackle was holding him
pay bud
great job by bud to avoid the facemask
im fine with the deep shots on 2nd and 1 now get the first with a run
i need a small tug down below
wheres he getting that claybrooks is 59 it showed hes six feet listed weird
the most obvious dpi of the year
i shouldnt laugh but fam you cant keep interring on the pass
the injured db grabbed claypool better than giving up a td
catchable as fuck
man they al l get hurt guarding him
chase keeps hurting dbs getting tackled on routes lol
damn it is raining pretty good right now

and damn another guy down hayden is fucking hurting
wow the jags just cant seem hold up against our receivers its like almost every play another one bites the dust
claypool literally built different
hate to see injuries especially on a call i dont think was good
it seemed like the cb was gimping when chase made his move and that is what caused the dpi on that one hate to see guys getting injured
tackling before the ball gets there pi

well at least we have a baseline now
claypool must be a terminator its the only explanation for how so many corners can hurt themselves by tackling him
2 dudes injured themselves while committing pi on claypool never like to see guys get hurt but maybe if they tried to actually defend properly instead of just interfering on every pass thrown his way they wouldnt be hurting themselves
are we just thanos snapping the jags secondary
thats 8 straight pass plays this drive
i hate it
according to teresa varley on twitter lutons current qb rating is 171 lol
come on bozgawd
i thought big ben was doing pushups for a second there lol
lets just call the game okay everybody knows how its going to end dont need any more weird ass injuries
i havent thought about it in a while but can you imagine having banner on this team we could be 90
looks like juju slipped on the flag
wizard of boz
my fianc and his best friend are rewiring the house with highspeed wifi and disconnected our cable so ive been watching the game on the bffs phone through his cable now theyve got the wifi off and i cant watch the game and im going to strangle them
bring in every back up there is and get on the plane
when boswell leans forward his numbers on top say 69 lol niccceeeee
the rb screen pass has literally never worked in this offense not even once this is like watching someone repeatedly put their hand on a hot stove because theyre too god damn stupid to learn that theyll get burned
titans keeping things competitive eagles not so much
come on tennessee you got this
holy fucking shit
niiiice
helluva play by edmunds
what a nice pick well done
edmunds with his second interception
edmonds haters in shambles
have a day terrel
i didnt even know edmunds had hands
10 and mutherfucking 0
edmunds breakout game
i see you te

edmunds made a difficult int you know things are going well when that happens
edmunds is trash
terrell on another one this year lets go young money
please drain this clock leave jacksonville healthy start preparing for the ratbirds
ill say it weve got the best safety combo in the league
he just pulled a lynn swann
edmunds has two picks in one game am i dreaming
im okay with juju sitting out not getting hurt more hurt
the titans scored
100
td titans
keep it up titans
and thats the dagger were on to baltimore
titan up

titans are up on the ravens
alright its mason time
claypool wouldve been open too on that td
see yall thursday fuck duval

ahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahqhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahqhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaha
our safeties just padding stats today

wow 4 picks 2 for each guy lol
come on qb thats to easy for our guys man
time to turn our attention to the titansravens game
thank goodness they restin ben hes earned it for sure
titan d folding like a cheap tent
juju limping

note this is only as accurate as nflcom when the bot triggers
i cant remember the last nfl game i watched where both teams had all 3 time outs at the 2 minute warning
steeler gal vibin
hope juju is okay
i think i hear here we go off in the distance
10 and fucking 0 lets go boys
good job mason
100 mother fuckers imagine not having double digit wins at this point in the season
100
can cbs switch to the damn ravens game could have cut away from this one 5 minutes ago
damn 100 looks beautiful on the screen good game boys
its going to be really funny to watch the people on social media say worst 100 team in nfl history

thats like saying someone is barely top 10 alltime like its an insult were 100
were all titans fans right now
go titans
lmao didnt even need to kick
oh no its 30 tomlin worst head coach panik s
fuck ian eagle
he is riding a hot streak it would have cost you exactly nothing to say that
i would much rather see big ben take a shot downfield on 1st and 10 than 3rd and 2
is it possible to draft a new oc getting real tired of ditchers playcalling
nelson deserved the pen but then getting a shot to the headand nothing way to go nfl
like to see conner punch that in he earned it

edit obviously take the points and happy for snell tho fuck the jags
stop trying to be something we are not running is not an option
please dont be hurt joe we cant lose you mannnn
i hope haden is ok
shit haden out really fucks out secondary
god damn it not haden
lets hope its a stinger or something i love that guy
9 plays 0 conner touches what the fuck

chase should have still had that
held that jersey longer than jacksonville has had the ball
damn everybody who covers chase literally dies
this game would be atleast 313 with a competent offensive gameplan
wow another 3 and out fire fichtner s
were at the tippy top of the mountain


and were only half way up


dr disrespect
ah yes the classic playbook

1 run for loss
2 run for shortno gain
3 chuck it and pray
4 punt
i am ready for this 60 mins battle
its definitely one of those games isnt it lmao
ian eagle can get face fucked with a shovel
fuck these announcers jinxing the god damn kick with multiple graphics and talking shit
lol are we really gonna start with the run run pass today again
can we not run on 2nd and long
ray ray head a little too big right now play smart now we dont 6 every return
it looks like the gameplan when we get near the endzone is run run pass
that was the most predictable run in the history of predictable runs
as the pandemic peaks world wide

cut to a shot of the stadium filled with thousands of fans
go 5 wide fuck it

get a lead then work on the run game
celebrating garbage time interception lol
ben and forcing last second first half passes to the goal line name a more iconic duo
shades of the bettis fumble shoestring tackle lmaoo

fuck that was 11 years ago god damn
its still not too late to die on establish the run hill lol
son of a bitch
please not joe
knee holding is never goodbut ben walked it off
its tough to sack a guy whos too terrified to drop into the pocket before ditching on the play
haha love the ref looking at the steelers sideline being like you guys think i should throw it and then putting it back in his pocket
are they just gonna keep hurting themselves on claypool
refs need to watch where they throw beanbag flags that was right in the path of jujus feet a few years ago a ref damaged a players eye with a flag
this game right here is why steelers are underestimated even tho were 90
so uhh i goofed and didnt leave the room earlier and thats when boswell missed hes perfect when im not in the room i usually leave i feel so bad
edmunds is trash
i dont know who kidnapped the real edmunds and gave us this one but thanks
not another word about edmunds being trash please
90 not a divisional game terrible opponent

not worried in the slightest calling it 95 we win 5 we lose and it doesnt matter in the slightest either way we roll to 100 or we get a little taste of humility ahead of the toughest part of the schedule and force the team to refocus down the stretch

barring injury theres no way to lose

but prediction 2713 hwg
i hate that ill have to watch via redzone but ill be on here for the whole game excited
herewego
last night i was cursing pitt in heinz on my tv but mostly my shitty hokies and now i have to push away those memories away and now root for the steelers the next day feels weird man at least one of my teams is good
i understand the jags suck but i still dont get why ravenstitans got nantzromo instead of us
it in get a big lead get the starters out early win

they have a game in 4 days
can we talk about how evan washburn looks like sam rockwell if he was buff
phew i got here before thread went toxic because we didt score 77 tds in the 1st love yinz psychos
i will never not be disturbed by medication ads
lets gooo baby no trap today time to exact some revenge for the last couple of losses against the jagoffs
damn juju is so much thicker this year
lets avoid a trap game get this w
j gluten
im ready for another heart attack game lmfao
steelers owe the jags a good old fashioned ass kicking lets get that ass kicking today
give me a juju birthday td pls
i got my heart medication ready lets go
hammer down i want the starters resting in the fourth quarter
1st pass was a completion oh shit were fucked

s
and so it begins
that was some good blocking on that run tbh
crackstreams keeps buffering wtf
keith butler in his classic jacksonville form
did you see watt getting hugged
thatll be his best drive of the day this will not be a repeat of dallas
man their o line and our d line are smashing each other
bent not broken lets gooo
jags
wow st did something good
troll game
wow

ill give it to jacksonville

they are going for it
hahahahha
wtf is that
haha lmao
baaaahhhhahahahha
good job by our st recognizing that one
i see the jags are pulling out the wacky stufff
they are going to go balls out today

i expect a fake punt to
jags are trying it lmao
great awareness to recover that
i like that call
that means jacksonville has absolutely zero confidence and their players dont either
boy the jags fucked that up
lmao fuck jacksonville cute little fuckers
its so funny that the narrative has completely shifted to now the steelers are actually good on their first drives
credit where its due that kick was clever as fuck
honestly mad respect what a fucking call
bbut i wanted a touchdown
bad pass
thanks for that graphic
sounds like tunch and hillgrove are having a bad day
it seems to me that they are using the west coast offensive with these short passes
i swear balls hit his hands all the time i know that was a little ahead of him but thats so frustrating
big ben threw that a bit in front of him still good effort by the defender making sure johnson didnt get a chance with it
icing in the 1st quarter jags pulling out all the stops
fucking graphics
fucking hell
terrible snap
should have just gone for it on 4th and 3 there but hindsight is 2020
awful snap
technically boswell missed the one in dallas too but a penalty saved him
that was a notsogreat pass by ben but statistically this season diontae has some of the most drops in the league
yeah snap was short surprisingly the play calling on the first drive wasnt terrible imo good call on 3rd ben just missed
pat mcafee is right these announcers have become absolutely horrid and ruin the game
screw booger all my announcer hate is now directed towards ian eagle
come on announcers why

relax thine buttholes we got this jagoffs pulling out everything they got and it still wont be enough
hotel ads during an ongoing global pandemic what a world
they literally gift wrap us elite field position and we do nothing with it pathetic
im one more dick head announcer call from watching the rest of the game on mute
im taking back my pro bowl vote for our long snapper
bro y do we always have to start slow
lol here we go gonna be one of those games great field position and they end up with 0 points buckle up guys
wel theres the jinx
they reaaalllyyyy wanna jinx this
they couldnt have played that 3rd and short better thats all effort by robinson
welp they just showed the undefeated vs 1whatever teams graphic its all over now i kid
wow that was a ton of pressure
literal only way these announcers can try to make this interesting i wouldnt be surprised if the title of their scripts this week were jinx
steelers radio team absolutely butchering ogunbowales last name lol
oh yeah now robinson is fucking terrell davis shut the fuck up
defense is heating up if we can force jacksonville to throw it i think this game is over hes not connecting on anything
ngl jax calling good plays and being aggressive

i mean our d will figure it out but its fun to watch
not liking the fact we have to start from our own 5
special teams actin real special right now
just ignore the announcers nothing they say impacts the game
yall watch with sound on amateurs
thats how you run the ball
nice run by conner
fuckin schobert man glad hes not gonna be around a lot
i dont like that play
why does he throw that never looked anywhere else
why could ben have possibly saw there
pick 6 comming up minkah
well we flipped the field completely at least we are moving the ball and not going three and out call me an optimist but i think by the end of 4 we will be alright
now deion sanders intercepting food seems like a great running gag commercial
gotta love tj taking bud out of that play lmao
o line needs to get their assignments in control
wtf was that punt
jax o line just gettting abused
awww bud
that was a bomb lol
right off the pads unfortunate
wow looked like dupree never tried to catch a pass should have been a pick 6
thank goodness for this d
their fucking punter is legend
all competition aside those turquoise pants look nice af
alright can we not waste 2 downs a series this drive
lets try one deeeeeeep not to claypool once please
i wonder if its sometimes hard to be a ref and not be like shit that was a nice catch
they need to come out in the no huddle for some of these early series they have been successful with it when the other team is expecting it maybe it will work when they arent it has to be better than the fucking constant bill cowher offense
nice recovery james
great little run by conner there
claypool with the toronto toe tap
bens deep ball has been sad
chase trying to win an oscar
i think claypool could have got that i dont think that jersey hold was significant enough to stop him so i dont know what happened there other than he lost track of the ball
nice run
if mcfarland could stay on his feet he might be able to do something dude gets tripped up on every play
id love so see mcfarland run the jet sweep
a 1 yard run nice
why are they mixing in backs when conner is having a good game i dont get it
connor actually looks like he has some speed today
come on bozgawd
it would be the most steeler thing to lose to jacksonville 03 too bad they are gonna win
some poor play calls today
exactly the same playcalling sequence that killed the last drive killed this one run no gain run no gain almost picked
anyone in here whos available to play tight end next week
bos is back
fuck off randy let ben throw the damn ball fuck
mcfarland got next bruh said no one ever
every time they run it 1st and 2nd down i want to pull my hair out elite receiving core against trash secondary and they run the 90s bill cowher offense
do we need to force it to johnson 15 times a game
shit pisses me off
try juju he was open
teams know were going to go run run pass so maybe stop it
taking a page outta the last few years of chuck nolls playbookineffectiverunineffectiverunpasspunt
quit forcing it to johnson
dont believe in boswell believe in the you that believes in bosgod
we put so much pressure on ourselves to convert 3rd downs when we waste the first two downs every time on shit runs
pretty sure i chose a bad week to start 4 steelers on fantasy
why is randy the way that he is honestlyevery time we try to do something fun or exciting he makes it not that way i hate so much about the things that he chooses to be
its so frustrating watching this team when we get close to the red zone if you run on first down and get 1 or less dont fucking run it on 2nd down youre not fooling anyone when we do it all the fucking time
are we holding back on play calls due to thursday game
we are passing great time for fucking run run pass
i think mcfarland and snells failures are solely on the offensive line the fact james conner has positive yards just shows how good he can be
gentry ruled out ebron is the only te active now
run plays need to be few and far between thats just where our offense is at right now
hold on watt
our d is on it today offence needs to step up
omg so close
it must be so badass watching yourself throw a td on the big screen after it happens thats gotta be a high
the jags remembered theyre the jags but this punter can take the rest of the day off good fucking lord
guys named miles and helmet misuse name a better duo
didnt know that was a penalty
trying to set the record for 1 yard runs i think we can do it
juju is such a fucking tank i love him so much
ive never heard unnecessary use of the helmet
dotson needs to go in for feiler when hes healthy
2 straight rushes for 1 yard then an overthrow to claypool and punt
i wonder how much of our run game issues have been due to vances absence its struggled ever since hes been out and hes our best blocking tight end since ebron is more of an offensive weapon and gentry is just not good

i love these receivers
washington is looking thicc
lol hbd j2s2
gee another first down run who couldve predicted that
mapletron
thats what we have been waiting for
lets go mapletron
ray ray is a better rb than mcfarland
mapletron
finally
claypooooool
lets gooooooooo claypool
beautiful
i luv you chase baepool
that dude look like et
billy howton claypool is coming for ya
what he hell nelson
ah now it makes sense
what
he got punched
its called offsetting you dumb fucks
really nelson with that shove are you fucking kidding me
he slapped him wtf atleast have offsetting penalties
damn they left him wide open
i have chase claypool on my fantasy team and hes a beast him and metcalf are the next great receivers
ugh nelson playing cover 3 and flat defender playing man
minkah with the power bomb
jags full of fake tough guys
yeah chark and nelson gonna have more problems throughout this game
nice blown coverage there d
i need a game to play with bong rips for watching the game any suggestions
minkah just made me hard
so punches are legal now
that was aggressive
lmao minkah showing them who daddy is
nice spinebuster by minkah
minkah
thank fuck
wow now im super invested in this game fuck these jagoffs
lets go minkah
defense is making way too many easy mistakes on this drive clean that shit up
thank god for minkah
fitzmagic
talk yo shit king
all pro son
minkah i love you
minkah bailed out nelson there bigtime

there are bad penalties but you cant get stupid penalties for pushing another player thats unacceptable
fuck the jags
take control on this drive
fucking minkah man
jfc ben get outta the way lmao
wtf chokehold takedown right there
always in the right spot
minkah is the definition of clutch
yesssssss
minkahhh
thats my boy

love the writing on this season
you knew that was gonna happen luten dodged a few ints already
big ben getting that block
lets fucking go thats my safety
he always finds the ball
ben putting his old ass on the line lol
i know that was a first down but that was still fucking stupid on bens part
please cover up the elbow next time ben
wow

how the fu
beast
thats what mac school players do mike

td baby
its benny snell football baby
there we go
snell yeah
thx for getting us closer to tlaw
snell yah baby
i am ao glad were having ben 2 great drives lets go
lets get boswell lined up on the right hash he seems determined to go left today
roethlisberger gaining ground on daniel jones today
amazing second quarter boyssssss
ok do not give up a fucking fg
the way that guys face mask lies on his face makes him look like the grinch
honestly the only team thats scares me anymore is the chiefs afc championship game baby
you should have took a knee and ran the clock out
or youre losing so youre tryna shake hands now fuck outta here jagoff
edmunds
all i will say is that the jags return guys facemaskon those close up camsis not flattering
rookies getting welcomed
finally edmunds gets his pick
enmunds
edmunds finally did something
wooo edmunds got one
int get em
best play for jagshalf time
holy shit edmunds finally got his
we can get more points here if we play it right
omg terrelle intercepted a pass i cant feel my face go hokies go steelers
i guess minshew aint too worried about his job
boswell wants to put another 3 on the board before the half
air mails it havent heard that phrase in awhile
defence getting their stats up today just need some sacks
it took us like four years in the mid 10s to get that many takeaways lol
i missed part of q1any sacks yet
juju thats one you should have
lutons passer rating is down to 150

ooof
pi
69 yards nice
are people still saying bens deep balls are garbage
one more endzone throw before the half boswell if we miss the td
claypool is so fucking fast
they literally have to tackle mapletron on routes to stop him
thats still a good penalty he doesnt pull on him and claypool walks in
gd ben fuck
ah man at least thats the end of the half
jersey pull theyll get ya everytime
claypool seems to get a long pi every game love it
vintage ben
guys look i ran 50 yards for no points
bleh just a weird bump on the route leading to a pick but ben with the diving tackle
does ben have amnesia the dude has forgotten his age and his seasonending injury last year
didnt he learn after the titans game
opening drive td to start the 3rd it is
we are treating this game like a practice game basically lets try to jumpstart the running game and also lets take a few shots
looked like pass interference he picked and pushed off while ball was in the air
i miss james harrison
is our cap so fucked that we have to release juju to free agency at the end of the year
my god 6 beers in the looooong first half this is going to be a 4hr game easily
its alright boys i know we are all traumetized with close games but weve never looked better
2nd and long run face palm
nothing like a 311 straight out of halftime
we get zero blocking going left every time
shotgun running is not working
fucking ridiculous ass offense
come on berry boom it
fichtner please stop
i really wish ebron blocked that corner back we cant get anything going on second down runs
are we still sackless
we come out the half playing like bitches on offense which doesnt surprise me at all
84 has a weird looking facemask
if mike is walking on the field joes done for the day
please be something minor
luton is gonna try layne and hes gonna get a pick the antwon blake special
oh thank god hes walking around
just a bit offsides
its not serious thank fuck
we good he up and moving
ref giveth and ref taketh
so haden with a stinger maybe a sharp cramping or a slight ankle roll seems to be okay
slide to the left


slide to the right
guys how is joe haden my stream died and they havent said anything on redzone yet
were yet to get a sack today
lets goooooo
the streak survives
you can un clinch your butts now
bear hugging wattthats one way to stop him from killing your qb i suppose
the streak continues
false starts so hot this drive
the streak lives
the streak lives on
haden looks ok praise be
finally a sack
ahhh our dpoy candidate tuitt
whew 67 boys
let the floodgates open now that we got that first one
the streak lives
alright only conner is allowed to run the ball now
it would be nice to have a long slow time consuming drive where noone gets hurt
the streak stays alive
pa guy stephon tutt
our defense has arrived
is joe ok i missed it

edit hadenprayers for burrow tho
nice push snell but conner has a great game im guessing there limiting his carries to save him for the baltimore game
when we said pass the ball we didnt mean like that
tighten up ben
that injury to burrow oof
shit i just started watching

what i miss
randy please just let ben run the no huddle for a little while we can score another td or two and then we can go back to your fucking shitty bill cowher offense
k nvm
its pretty amazing how this team is 9 and 0 with fucking randy finctner as our oc
do they have any idea what theyre doing

do they have multiple coaches calling plays
dang bud looks like he really hurts to take hits from
lmao what was that
why is jacksonville being so dumb
ray rayda fuk
mccloud seeing ghosts
what the fuck was that
they took the penalty now theyre going for it

uhhhh
bleh i get why ray ray went fair catch out of reflex part of the special teams unit wasnt out but fuck man wish you had taken a peak at the room you had
put in the dagger
wtf was that jax
ray ray wasnt taking any chances
this is why they are 18
lol what was that stupidity jags actually out here
how many times are we gonna start a drive off with a fucking run
lmao in the browns game the announcer just said big chubb
randy must just flip a coin when choosing if its a run or a screen
they are not giving him that reach
good run by jc
thats a first
lol checked the bengals game thread and saw some well wishes from steelers fan for joey b downvoted to hell classless fans kill em with kindness
he didnt look short to me with the stretched arm
i dont get this offense sometimes its really feast or famine
randy is trying to make sure that the game is super close at the end
way to make the defender miss jc
jags breaking like hard boiled eggssmh
this looks like time for a jet sweep
my lord stop with injuries
well we gotta pass now
woohoohooo conners a baaad mamajama
love the stiff arm as he was moving out of bounds didnt need it to get any farther just straight disrespect lol
here comes the draw play
getting fouls so youre forced to pass the 1000 iq strat
has ebron got a catch today
im not used to seeing ben throw this many short pass attempts from a playcalling pov
untimed down to end third quarter cbs is going to love running those extra ads between quarters then
would be sweet to see us put some fourth quarter points on the board perhaps a pick six
if nelson was 2 in taller he would have had that
tj watt rocked spillane there haha
bud dupree is my spirit father
du0ree decapitated him
bud is a beast
bud lets go
holy fuck bud with the clawwwww
bud just sonned him lol
have my children dupree
good job protecting that ball juju
bud brought a buddy to the turf
jags are gone mentally
why cant a quarter end on a defensive penalty
no flags come on
man a lot of jags are going down for the count
juju is back in
fucking pulling again from claybrooks
chase has gotta catch that he knew it too
dude peeing on that replay by the field phone things
so were just not throwing flags anymore coolcoolcool
i think chase could have hit the dirt to catch that
takes their guy pulling a hammie and taking our guy out to get the call geez
poor dbs on chase
theyre down so many dbs how are we not running the score up now
id like to stop seeing players get injured i just tuned in at the start of the third and its already too many
not juju
dang not juju
juju in pain gah
praise be
looks like an ankle injury for juju
praise be
ben is really gonna throw it 50 plus times going into a short week jesus christ
didnt know efiert was on the jags
tj watt is my dad
lowkey surprised fast willie parker didnt get 1000 yards as a rookie udfa
hold up whats going on theres still 10 min to play we cant let up
is joe back out there
yes
this poor qb gets no peace
game over jagoffs

you have another quarter
what a play
well whoever said earlier that nobody should bet on another edmunds int is really eating their words now
what in the fuck edmunds hell yes
this is a good easy win if you ask me theyre basically coasting through this and still winning easily
dream for the play callerrest ben just run it now and get good punts
let conner get over 100
yeeessssiiirrrrrr thats my boy rell
thanks rayray
titans score
good to see ray ray getting targets
apparently tomlin had the over
gamesteelers

lets go ebron
i dont feel bad about this one bit fuck the jags and fuck their stupid duval chant
eric ebron baby
and they got the 2pt converstion

can we pull ben now
thats game sit ben
great pass ben ebron keeps getting better
reindeer time
juju looks so upset
and for the next 218 we are all titan fans
let juju rest well need him in a few days
went to the pro bowl did eric ebron
ok yoda
sutton almost with another turnover
the nfl needs to institute a rule where the captains of both teams can get together agree theres no point in playing anymore and have the game end
johnson has more catches than luton has completions thats just an embarrassing stat line
you get a pick you get a pick everyone gets a pick
you get an int and you get an int
not only can we continue an unbeaten streak next week we could keep baltimores wonderful losing streak come on titans going as well
another one
and thats a comfortable lead on the league sack lead
what the fucking fuck does tj gotta do to get a holding call
post game thread
watt being held at all costs wouldnt be surprised if he leaves this game without his jersey on
dionte johnson has more receptions than loton has completions where are all those bastards who were complaining a back up was tearing up our defense
i guess the jags are handing picks for christmas this year
i just lold the second i saw that 4th pick
lol go home jags
i switched to the ravens game to see lamar choke but this is awesome lol pad those stats minkah
our defense make me feel sum kinda way
time to cheer for the titans now
luton wishing he would have stayed in bed today
oprah luten out there
not looking good for the titans cant stop a runny nose
florida weather is just the fucking worst
time to watch the ratbirds
ravens going to ot most likely
bosgod gonna put up three take us to an even 30 me like
how quickly yall think we could order a toe styled birthday cake and send it to the hotel in jacksonville
i would take a baltimore tie here
10 0
somebody get juju a fucking wheel chair
100
100
lets go titties
lol lama sacked
please tits please
just need a fg now
suck it ratbirds
how can anyone possibly defend this garbage play calling its a joke if we werent undefeated this would be a way bigger topic than it already is
remember these guys played a bunch of good teams close

dont except a blow outz
so its gonna be one of those days huh
backup qbs


the steelers kryptonite
real talk fire tomlin before the end of this drive or wait til the half
well they stopped the td atleast
tbf that was a pretty good fake kick

good execution just not a good result
fuck these announcers
that was berrys fault
fuckin kidding me guy
like the announcers were doing their damnedest to jinx that
they couldnt have tried any harder to jinx him
thank you cbs for jinxing chris boswell
abandon the jet sweep please just purge it from our playbook
lmfao dropped picked 6 and then a 65 yard punt just one of those games
great call on the back to back mcfarland carries to ice that drive
whos the dumbass picking angles for these field goals
stop with this fucking bill cowher bullshit im so sick of it were better than this we have a fucking hall of fame qb playing lights out and our fucking coordinator acts like neal odonnell is the fucking quarterback fuck you randy hes so fucking awful
oroy
not a td we wanted to keep bitching for no reason
big dick chase
yeah flag the push and not the punch to the face
number 22 killing us on this drive and hes our guy

is it bad that i correctly predicted us running down the middle with our 58 running back on 2nd and long
so does benny snell football not exist anymore or what
run run pass punt where have i seen that before this team could be absolutely elite with even halfway competent play calling
thats not good
mother of fucks
fuck haden is down and holding his knee this aint good
every freaking run play decastro just stands around even when conner is trying so hard to get open

if the oline didnt give up so easily maybe we could actually gain some rush yards
screens are not working especially on xlong
i love claypool as much as the next guy but hes dropped some very catchable balls this year still great but damn some balls just go right through his hands
pi rules thrown out for this game the refs are just guessing
please fire randy cheeseburger fichtner into the sun
are those edmunds first 2 ints ever
can we pls start dobbs over rudolph
lmao they still dont trust rudolph to throw even in garbage time
let the big dick reindeer sling it plz
hes fine guys he lifts
hey did you guys know that games arent decided in the first ten minutes

chill the fuck out
i hate to be that guy but this play calling is fucking garbage no no that is an insult to garbage this play calling is hot fucking mayonaise on a piece of stale fucking bread
big ass fucking house family is just playing in the living room ugh only place i can get some peace and quiet is my lincoln parked out front

are these ads serious
marcus allen making penn state proud in these trying times
why take a timeout there seems like a waste
the announcers literally just fucked boz
announcers are jaguars fans
that stat just gave jax the win
you know your defense is bad when the steelers can run on you
clay pool and a clay brook lol
snell and running directly into a pile of people name a better combo
the offense cant start slow against real teams or they are toast in the playoffs
whenever our defense is playing lights out our offense goes to sleep whenever the offense is firing on all cylinders the defense blows coverages it would be nice when both sides of the ball show up to play whenever games are outside ohio
dude our run blocking is so garbage
anyone else noticing when a run fails today they just do the same shit again fuck randy
bens thought process that guy has a defender draped on him like a fucking coat ima throw it to him
is anyone surprised at all were struggling with a 18 team mainly the offense wetting the bed
this play calling is really starting to piss me off spice it up some randy
100 on nelson if they score here
jesus christ this playing calling
randy is going senile if he thinks the run run past scheme still works
imagine watching that oculus commercial while high lol id be tripping
lets not completely take our foot off the gas at the top of the second half please
that offensive drive was comedic at best trying to create a run game out if thin air this is pittsburgh we dont run the football well
say it aint so joe
were gonna make this a game arent we
cock sandwich
oh no
fuck not hayden
plz haden no
jags confused ray ray so much he decided not to return it
lol todd haley make that play call
future cincinnati bengal matt feiler
what is a penalty
why the fuck is this team so hellbent on throwing conner is averaging 8 yards a carry give him the damn ball
all it took was a tackle to get the pi called
i think the last deep ball was more of a pi than this one but i understand it
these short yardage calls are awful
chase is wr1
play calling is awful how are we nearly shut out this half
obligatory fire fichtner
this has been a confidence building drive for jags so far damnit
2 quartets without a single point great
we desperately need that 1 seed dont trust these fuckers on the road
come on steelers lets make this a relaxing game and move on to 100
ugh eyean eagle is calling the game

fuck me im hungover
why is the game on cbs but i get two cbs stations and not one has the game why is it like this
hope the bot doesnt implode this week
we gonna see some avery williamson this week didnt notice him against cincy
oh man this broad singing on wmbs can stop already put on wolf tunch and billy already
lets beat their asses
ride the wave ben 4 tds 400 yds yeah ive had a couple
lfg
steelers won the toss
lets gooooooooo
representing from 7500km away letgoooo
we should have this in the bag but that doesnt change the fact that jags are always a thorn in our side and that worries me
claypool gonna come up with two touchdowns today
if the pre kickoff chat from the announcers is any indication this is going to be a long game
here we goooo
anyone know why the game isnt on my local cbs
can i change my flair on mobile app
this is basically jacksonvilles super bowl take down the last undefeated team this will be a tough game
is alaunhaltig back this week
sigh beer one is gone already
god dang it bobby
link to game
now i remember why i dont watch games with my parents at their house

their bootleg internet stream that they insist on is so far behind
lol thanks for the field position
what a high risk play
holy shit onside kick
jags know the steeers worst nightmare a back up quarterback
lmao they really just did that
that kick was not for the brand
lmao nice try jacksonville
they pulling out all the stops this is going to be an interesting game
why did jax do that
better punish them for that
so marcus allen
damnnn ballsy lol
actually goated call i wish we were that aggressive sometimes
hot second there i thought johnson was gonna take off and be gone
honestly great kick
id like them to run up the middle thats what conner does well hit a hole and go
i really love how dj has blossomed as a receiver
please score a td not a fg
yeah but now show consecutive sheets banned from
ahhhh bos is wide left
and so it begins
the jags look desperate
not ideal
lets go titans
another bad snap by canadyhes gonna lose his job
pain
garbage snap get it together guys
man that sucks get it back
its gonna be one of those days
those fucking jagoffs jinxed us
fuck the announcers but canaday needs to get his shit together that was a terrible snap
we had a perfect situation sniffed out the trick and get away with nothing oh yeah this is going to be a nail biter boys get ready
every kick boswell has missed this year has been either his snapper or holder completely fucking him
c h u d ii bud the c h u d
announcers with bosgod voodoo dolls
damn that was actually really good
im surprised luton can throw as far as he can with his noodle arms
defensive pressure is fuckin awesome today
good d
rayray what is you doin baby
here we go 20 plays 12 min drive td
ok the neighbors fencing but was clever

the first 800 times
verizon this is the 5g network america has been waiting for

wildland firefighters just wanting basic service
i no longer watch the game with sound so i have other stuff playing off to the side with that info out there true detectiveseason 1 has been fantastic
doug marrone on the hottest seat in the nfl

ian eagle how much of this mans dick can i swallow and still attempt to announce
great run james
run run run
i am speed
lets go james
schobert plays like a steeler
too close for comfort
our offense seems to take a half to get anything going
jesus christ that was close
nice coffin corner kick now lets force a turnover
what was ben doing on that play why does the offense always start so so slow
flipped the field anyway
defense better stand up
good punt
berry coming back strong after getting cut hope that lit a fire under his ass
everyones mad at snell and its like dude they never actually run the sweep to a receiver unless its claypool or mccloud i just looked at that and felt run up the middle and thats what it was i imagine the defense felt the same way i know everyone gets mad about the jet sweeps too often but id rather have the ball in one of our receivers hands or run snell outside instead of up the middle
regardless of play calls ben has to tighten up thats the second drive he stunted by a bad pass on third down
oh sweet bud
so close bud
ok please no run run pass
i slept through the entire first quarter apparently didnt miss much go steelers
play action bomb to claypool on first down
that punt was fucking insane
that punt had the power of an aaron rodgers pass
bold prediction mccloud takes it to the house this game
theres whats wrong with the run game horrible scheme
that was a very impressive two yard run
helluva 3 yard run
15 yard run 3 yard gain
great catch
steelers and sideline catches name a more iconic duo
difficult effort for 2 yards
the run on 1st down is so predictable my grandfather with dementia knows its coming
wow awesome grab
hes fucking holding the jersey
no flag
not trying to take away too much from a 20 yard pass but thats another throw that got away from ben luckily dj got it on target he could run fir days
what a catch chase youre the fucking man
claypool is this good as a rookie damn he is only going to get better
i have faith in conner hell get it
i knew my faith would go somewhere
who did they say went to the locker room
looked like my dog chasing a squirrel
come on man
bad route by dionte
this run game is atrocious
nice camera work on the fg jagoffs
damn the line held really well on that play too surely someone was more open
lol these play calls
2nd and long run
that was a boring last three plays
praise be
so whats xavier grimble doing these days
we just cant convert on third down
why a anyone not named conner is running the ball blows my mind also running on 2nd and long blows my mind
run blocking is a disgrace smh
my dog is free an is a good oc just let me know
our oline is so bad at run blocking

so why do we call continuous running plays
ben playing backyard football ben listening to the o coach
why is that jello so center on the truck is the driver 7 feet tall
luton isnt very good
jags offense looking like they have celiac disease
we need a sack
steelers te zach gentry sustained a knee injury and will not return to todays game
happy birthday juju
juju god damn
were using the jags as our little play toy thing trying out running game strategies i think we know that ben will ice this in the end
please please send randy home and let ben draw plays in the dirt
these 2 yard runs on first down are an awful call
how are we 90 with this run game
honestly surprised we made it this far into the game without a penalty almost forgot what it was like having the game stopped for these
that was dirty as fuck
miles jack celebrating after giving up 15
joe schobert is living in randy fichtners nightmares every single run lmao
what a fucking catch
guys im so sorry my lucky marcus allen shirt is currently drying and will be on to start the second half
this run blocking is horrendous
i swear dj falls after every catch haha
oline playing like fucking shit
wow djsgot hands
what a throw and catch by ben and jwashington
i wish they would just use intermediate passes more in the 1020 range then they wouldnt have to get all these wild third down conversions
that was sexy
what a man
well ray ray isnt curtis samuel but you damn well know well do whatever gimmicky shit we can
rookie of the year chase claypool
great job defense
chase claypool is the grandson of the grassy knoll shooter
boo
lol this defense is so smart
lets get a turnover
robinson looks really good strong and decently fast makes conner look like hes running in mud
that wasnt good
stop giving up 15 yard runs tf
dumb
god i hate the jags
jesus christ nelson youre better than that
why was vince williams covering on the outside on that play were lucky luton didnt look right
ha fuck you conley you cant even shine fitzs shoes
jesus where is our pass rush
holding on ever damn play now
jaguars trying to get in their headskeep calm
nelson what was up with that soft coverage
ok minkah
fuck it we will have lots of clock left regardless
heyward got bent backwards on that play looked worse than it was
that jags player pushed the ref
nelson is the soft spot in this pass defense hes getting beat every play this drive need to adjust asap
okay good cam
yessssssssss
mika
lets go
we need to step on their throats here
minkah pickpatrick
all i see is studs
minkah magic
loving the variety in the running game
dj lets goooooo
should have been a flag opposite too
that dude has some serious holes in his jeans
ill never get tired of seeing mapletron tower over our team its hilarious
holy shit
if youre gonna show fans at least show the ones wearing their damn masks
ebron stumbled and still almost managed to get there
how about these phenomenal refs

s
score a td
thats a td
diontae woke up
touchdownnnnnn
lets go snell
dj
here we go indeed
we need to close this game out early in the second half no more bullshit come backs especially from a 18 team
this game is going to be a massacre
he finally has a pick
okay lets not give them a fg holy fuck
edmunds congrats
lets goooo
another interception
damn this is like the polar opposite of the last 2 years games lol great throw
ok edmunds defense is feasting today
28 seconds and 2 time outs back to work
steelers feasting on another rook
wtf edmunds wow
holy shit edmonds made a play
defense looking pretty darn good now
hahahahahahaha
umm lmao
edmunds first pick this year yay
fuck yes
lets get a fg
mike glennon incoming
34s been playing great this year was only a matter of time really i shouldnt have been so surprised
i would feel kind of bad if it was the passtronaut josh dobbs having to start against our defense and throw 2 ints in a half
i went to the kitchen thinking the half is over now i see we have the ball back lol
this defense is elite

rsteelers has imploded
elite
claypool is a monster at drawing dpi
love the jacksonville defender celebrating that broken up pass like theyre not still down 14 points lol
oh man he would have caught that for sure make em pay
pi
finally a call

refs woke up ffs
oh well
elohel
my stream went down after the int and i was shocked pittsburgh didnt kneel it down like usual i like this aggressiveness
well that was stupid pi on their part
lol why not go for the fg tho
fuck
god fucking dammit ben
doh
too fucking greedy dude
ugh not the way to end the half but whatevs
around the league

note this is only as accurate as nflcom when the bot triggers
ahhh fuck that sucks
meh 3 would have been nice
gosh dangit ben
blatant pi
ben did that just to hurt his stats so people dont realize how good he is
tough but whatever not even really a momentum builder because they know they didnt get points and we start with the ball if anything this just is a little reminder to ben that he doesnt have to do it all
the tackle part 2
the jags are pulling out all the we have a shit team insults which range from insulting the fans and saying to hit ben keep it coming jags fans that are currently punching air
3 points wouldve been nice there as well but i dont blame ben he had a 1 on 1 and tried to give james a shot backshoulder unfortunately he stumbled coming out of contact with the db after the ball was thrown
does anyone know if rally house in ohio sells steelers gear or is it just ohio teams in there
this weeks useless fortune cookie reads

your hard work is about to pay off in an impactful way

cool if only i had been working hard towards something
does he just like holding a football
im off work this whole week yinz and what a way to start the staycation lfg
another 1 yarder
i think i could live without all of these give it to mcfarland three times series
is james conner hurt
yeah now im going to complain about that opening drive
rr p nice randy
strong start
i think if they called holding penalties consistently thered be one against the jags every play
ah rrp to start the half love to see it
1st possession of the half 2 run out the clock plays and launch the ball into orbit on 3rd down

fuck me
i dont know a lot about football positions can sutton play outside at all or is he really just viable in the slot
cam sutton time i guess fuck i really hope hes okay but his reaction looked bad
man that sucks next man up though the process is the process
heal up quick joe too valuable to this team
i started james robinson in my lineup this week im glad that at my expense we are keeping him unproductive
cmon joe you got this
guys can we not
oof enough with the penalties boys
1st down offsides

my bad
basically offsetting penalties lol
so 75 isnt holding tj watt at all s
get a stop
oof burrow ded
tuitt is a beast
we got the sack thank goodness
there it is
tuitt is looking at an all pro this year
sack record extended
they were getting one this drive for sure
sack
lets go tuitt
there it is
the streak is aliveee
about fucken time anyone hear that
joe burrow looks hurt pretty bad
rip joe burrow
burrow is down in cincy
fat randy trending on twitter cause he shanked one lol
need offense to keep our d off the field that haden heart attack was too much for me
damnit sucks to see burrow get hurt
welcome to the dj show
great effort by snell
i hate when liverpool and the steelers play at the same time i have to stick with the steelers on the big screen though since they play less than half as many games both teams looking good today though
let me guess short yardage and fichtner will send mcfarland up the middle
holy shit we just cannot run the ball
nelsons hair is wild
just got back to my computercan we talk about tuitt stealing cams sack lol
in backyard football scoring a 14 point lead is equivalent to leading 20 not big enough
is net punting yards measured from line of scrimmage or from where he actually kicks from thanks

berry has been a beast great to see it continuing
joeeeeeeee
good shot by bud
that does look uncomfortable
wtf is happening
holy fuck that might be the end of burrow
lol are they trying to get another delay of game
what are they doing
bud found himself a new buddy
lol nice subs lol
lol what
they were just giving him a group hug
that little guy is gonna get crushed today
bud took his soul lmao
bengals game thread is imploding over burrow
ray ray had room to run
ok jags secondary down and pass rusher allen outwe need to pass
juju ward blocking for the win
coach told him to fair catch not our return team on the field
i feel so bad for josh allen first burrow and now him
i feel a bit bad for conner theres just no holes for him
run run pass lets fuckin go
jaguar has hurt itself in its confusion
so fucking tired of these 1 yard runs
this play calling is so frustrating to watch
dj trying to get 20 catches in a game
face wash by jc
conner having a great day
arm is stiff it is
badass stiff arm and finish
this jags team so many injuries
im getting sleepy
that was meant for juju
oy
welp that sucked
are touchbacks considered good or bad as far as punting goes
our offense could be so much better without fichter
why did we still take an end of quarter commercial break
i wonder what he said to tj
sack

its bud time
tj and bud name a more iconic duo
bud finally gets one after playing great all game
theres bud
have they said anything about haden yet not sure if i missed anything
bud baby
another sack
put em away right here give defense a well deserved rest plz
how tf did dupree get him lol omg too great
im not gonna lie that was a facemask
im gonna miss bud
whew dodged a couple flags that could go either way there what a strongarm by bud
cmon titans you got this
he smacked chases arm contesting the ball is why that wasnt a catch
stg this claybrooks dude gets hurt every play
jax is damn good at holding and pi like damn
dang 40 passes
fucking finally
finally a fucking flag
how long has it been pouring
wtf is this game injuries man
iguess
claypool goes deep and catches a td once and now jacksonville wont stop holding and committing pi against him
good yac claypool
id like conner up the guy on 3rd and 1 but needed those points badly
aaaaand eifert is out for the season again dude has zero luck


not wishing injury on him ever just commenting on it
ive never seen a qb with less touch on his passes than luton every throw is an aroldis chapman fastball
christ luton might be the worst quarterback ive seen all season
i can almost relax
one handed sort of
pick city
why is ben still playing
alright now throw in rudolph and run the ball
edmonds coming in hot
edmunds better get a game ball today
ebron
aj brown with the grown fucking man touchdown against the ratbirds
ray ray looks like he might be growing as a pass catcher thats some nice depth
another helmet hit pos
thats what i like to see
td titans
lol the eagles arent helping
dart
ebron

game
frustrating you think the line is being trash and conner dances all over the place you think conner is dancing around too much and the line is making trash blocks
yes
king ebron
man i think that foul goes both ways ill gladly take the yards but mccloud lowered his head too
1 step drop is a specialty
fuck it ill take an ebron touchdown
cool the yinzers can shut up now
reindeer time now please
the tits make the 2pt convo
come onnnnnnn titans
thats game boys
if we come out of this week with a four game lead over baltimore and a three game lead over cleveland im still going to consider it a four game lead
how many tds is that for ebron this year
holy shit ngl stopped watching at 173 and we scored 10 points lets gooo
i would play mason but its just handoffs from here on out ben will stay in
sutton i fucking felt that pain so damn close
and here i was thinking ebron wasnt having much of a game
minkah
12 11
our secondary stat blocks thanks the jacksonville quarterback today
another one
alright boys can i relax now or
minkah
lol cbs is savage with that graphic
we have the keys to all success
insert its already dead meme
okay this kind of sad now
wooohoooooo minkah
luton just giving us stats
minkah with another one lets go
ok whos getting the hat trick
fitz fucking magic
i think i feel bad now whats happening
its weird how many 3rd and 9 or 10s we give up yet only 3 points
idk when the last time we had two guys with two picks in one game but im guessing it had something to do with rod woodson
mason jar time
and the ball of derek let him get some yardage
the ravens are moving down the field quick
nice tackle highsmith
damn birds lol
good job d love to see everyone stepping up
lets go titans
this qb for jacksonville shouldnt be in the nfl he is pathetic
ravens in ot baby
i just bought a tj watt jersey so im glad it isnt bad luck
take us to the titans game cmon
good game boys no messing around just foot on the gas pedal
luton putting his helmet back on looking so deflated dont blame him a bit
ahh boys see yall on thursday
keep it 100
where can you catch the postgame at
cams big throw at the end really helped my fantasy team
judon going down could be big for thursday
lets gooooo
this playcalling is garbage
can we please not suck on the road against a shit team for once
that drive is on ben that was an easy throw
every season were doing well then get pitted against an unstoppable force like the 18 jags
this whole starting slow shit has to stop come on man this aint gonna work all season
wtf dude two easy touchdown drives end when we go full idiot mode and put in back up rbs to run 2 dives in a row then hope ben makes a long 3rd down randy is killing our drives with that garbage
steelers fans and crying about the commentators name a more iconic duo
well dj hasnt had his usual early drops or issues today
our top defensive status is going to be in major trouble if haden is gone for a long time
bush going out ended our rush d
managing my expectations today we have a short week coming up playing the ravens in baltimore classic trap game here calling it now 4th quarter drive with 3 minutes left to win the game by 3

love you guys
why do we always do this
uhhwhat are we doing exactly
damn that was a hell of an attempt by jax glad our boys were sharp
fuck these announcers
ian damn you dumbass cant pronounce his own name
fukcing cbs
jinx works ffs
dont even start this shit today
i absolutely do not trust this team after what they pulled against dallas had me pissed off the entire game
are we panicking yet s we got this
im gonna miss smokin bud
connor snell
they knew big ben was going to ebron before the snap even happened
i love the overreactions already
the run game will not take off until we finally insert kevin dotson into the starting lineup
can we just let ben pick plays please
starting slow every fucking game even against tanking teams is really concerning espacially coming playoff time
need to run conner more hes deserved touches so far give ben a break
bud is a body catcher apparently
offense 0 points in the 1st quarter against a 18 team
bens deep ball has left the building
wish i was watching right now cbs decided to air titans vs ravens game instead for my area once again cbs has disappointed me
fichtner mixing it up again i see
why wait til 3rd down to pass
jesus fucking christ how many times are we gonna runrunpass
randy can suck a fat one dumbass calls a run over and over we should be at least 14 points right now
of course our defense is playing good all game offense finally scores a td whats happens next our defense shits the bed
cam suttonnelson
you get paid millions of dollars to play this game and not jeopardize it by pushing someone like youre in middle school
edmunds did a thing
wtf was that ben
could be pushed off our guy any harder or was that maximum effort
can we just take the points ever
hiding on the other side of a glass partition is so hilarious
run run 25 yard incompletion so predictable lol
lets be honest out o line is doin 0 for running game we could have hade prime oj in his bronco and we would be stopped on line of scrimmage
noooooooooo
oh fuck haden doesnt look good omg
noooooooo
oh fuck me
fuck
it doesnt sound like shes saying funkifier at all
no sacks so far for pittsburgh

luton is a coward confirmed
when did josh allen play linebacker i thought he was a qb
mccloud is looking like switzer today lol
ray ray seeing ghosts
so sad to hear that cinci didnt bother to get burrow any help and hes now dead
these plays man what in the blue flaming buttfuck
we keep getting cute
really dont like letting them hang around
ah yes the old dominate the game but let a bad team hang around game from the steelers today
mapletron gotta catch those
claypool has an insane catch radius he probably wouldnt have gotten that but he might have been able to
how did that one ref just hold and stare at his flag
its gonna be tough in the playoffs if we cant run the ball to run out the clock late in games
time to pull juju he got some hamstring issues
fuck this offense is so frustrating
the lack of a running game today is disappointing and to rack up all these throws behind the line of scrimmage is infuriating
what the fuck kind of screen was that
juju hurt thats why we have washington a good wr
even tomlin shaking his head at this dog shit play calling
i wish wed fire fichtner right after this game i know we wont but i just want good offensive play calling i just want something entertaining to watch the defense cant make splash plays all day they get tired and all fichtner can do is run right into the pile and throw screen plays please god fire him
offense is definitely struggling i worry about us vsing baltimore next week
guess we avoided the trap
my heart is so happy this game is turning into a laugher i was so nervous about this one
this has been a hideous performance
almost time to go get chinese food already got a good sativa ground up testing at like 24 putting jerseys on my dogs and myself when we get back and a victory preroll on standby for tomorrow morning after i get home from work

lets kick some jaguar ass
how bout the announcers get in a car accident and die in a fire jinx
people are really crying about spillane as if butlers not the one getting lbs in man coverage on wrs and being clueless about how to handle those mismatches when they pop up same shit every week and he still hasnt shown any indication of knowing how to solve the problem thats the weakness of the defense dont get worked up when the inevitable happens
oh goodie here go the announcers deepthroating the jags holy fuck
only 4 ints but not for lack of trying
man randy is retarded
jesus christ if you run it once and only gain a yard why would you run it again so stupid
why does ben only throw to dj
can we stop the fucking ineffective runs up the middle when our passing game is working
our running game is dead just stop it is not working even against bad teams stop

we chose not to sign a running back or work on our runblocking so it is what it is
our run game is bad are we trying to force it to improve it or is the play calling bad

chase is having an awesome rookie season but hes been dropping a lot of catchable deep balls
bruh ben is going to fucking kill claypool with all these overthrows like holy fuck
this is just anemic playcalling 20 points against this decimated defense is really pathetic
we suck its over
why does it feel like were losing

im not enjoying watching this game at all
i dont give 2 fucks what the scoreboard says we look like absolute dogshit and this is why no one cares about our record
conner is averaging 28 per attempt over the last three games i knew he was struggling but didnt expect it to be that bad
bratwurst cooked beer by my side lets go
we really letting luton do this
ahhh our run defense is still trash
for fucks sake

older fans warned me about this how do we proceed now
the graphic jinx is real
god damn it canaday
they had to jinx bos didnt they

come on randy just retire and let canada take over
whew pick 6 avoided
god the run game just isnt working stop trying to establish it and just let ben do his thing
why are we always so bad against the jags
why is snell playing
not loving the offensive play calling to start this game why try to run the football when were not a running team should just do what were good at which is spreading it out
lol ben should have at least 2 ints now does this guy have nightmares of the jaguars
man gotta come down with that pick bud
is bud angry
holy fuck our offensive line sucks
lol back 2 back runs
why is our run game so horrible
ben needs to pick it up but i trust he will he gives me a lot of confidence but i wish he would be ready from the start of games anyone else feel the same not necessarily saying he doesnt come ready to play but maybe he plays it too safe early its just a different ben late when were in a game
nelson looking like ike taylor with that drop
ok so safe to say were playing for the field goal
why is the time running down after conner went out of bounds
run on 2nd and 8 sigh
we are a pretty lucky team
wow edmunds actually did something holy shit
terelle edmunds sucks
he did something
ugh why cant we take the points
come on ben that was ridiculous
ben is better than that man take the 3 points always trying to make a playground play
couldnt have just taken the easy three boo

bosgod deserved to eat again
now pittsburgh is gonna recieve the kickoff ben knew exactly what he was doing
oh ben well at least that happend against the jagoffs could be worse
stop stop give up 3rd down lol some things never change
damn it
nooooooooooooooo
fuck time to see layne play some solid snaps i expect to see sutton move around outside aswell
fuck
no
nononononononono
come on joe be ok
holding the knee
i knew it saw that hit and said i hope hes not hurt heard that triple whistle and knew he was damn
nooo not joe
idk about yinz but those side effects though
anyone that thinks randy fichtner is good should have their account 
this playcalling is putting me to sleep
oh my god this offense looks so ugly thank god for this defense
i dont see how that isnt a penalty
its refreshing to see a receiver not come down with the ball and not immediately cry for a flag they were def battling good no call
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck ben that was on you
chases route just took out haydens knee
alright whos next on the claypool deadpool reference
fuck juju is down
offense has been playing fucking awful
terrell edmunds blowing his load in one game save some for the good teams terrell

ravens going to ot
good game for the dbs still terrible game for the running game its like they didnt do any changes from last week they have thursday night football i dont think they will be making that many changes to the running game unless they would want to use derek more lets hope juju is good fir thursday as well 100
fuck is wrong with our defense
spillane just got shredded on that tackle ugh
not ideal start lol
fg good for jagstime to fire st coach
johnson dropping too many 3rd down passes
wow give jags confidence in their first offensive possession dont capitalize on great field position then miss a fg starting to feel like the cowboys game
another first quarter where we do nothing
feels like this offenses only chance of doing anything depends on bens arm and thats a shitty spot to be in he cant throw 65 times a game
thats really bad im pretty sure justin layne is not ready for this yet
losing haden will destroy our defense
bush and haden this team is cursed
this is actually pissing me off
i know people are bitching about our offense but we have zero run game suspect o line and no mobility in big ben offcourse we are fucking predictable
please put in dobbs
dude thats fucked conner should have gotten the td
cant play for shit against bad teams doesnt matter what tomlin says it shows every time
can we really not score more than 17 points on the fucking jaguars
the whole fam is geared up got two 19s on the kids today happy birthday juju
anybody got a stream crack streams isnt working
please dont hurt us sincerely jags
so what are our draft targets next season another big ben replacement rbs or maybe a te
im unexpectedly hungover today so hoping for a not so close game

here we gooooo
here we go
ill add wing and fries are cookin beer in hand celebration edibles are on standby
jags fan here put us out of our misery
slight drizzle boys
how do i watch this game its not showing on my cbs channel
im here i have not missed kickoff once this year and almost slept thru it i dont wanna say its why were undefeated but hmm
jake get ready for tj and bud to make their introductions
lfg
and now stuff it
lutton gonna get sacked all day today
get a stop here
oh lord
good stop boys
why wasnt that jags pass intentional grounding
is minshew hurt or benched
the jags are gonna run play action every time they see tj play the middle giant scheme flaw
across the 50
good run
conner pop off please
30 looked like 36 on that run
hey should we use our kicker for the onside try nah
oh okay interesting kick
good start offense
he hit em with that okie doke
two of those a game it seems
so many bats
pretty crazy how much thats happening it doesnt even look like hes putting his arm low on his motion to me either
my stream died how did we get such good field position
shiddddd johnson down there somewhere
fuck shoulda tried a run
no bozgawd for now i guess
wait what he missed
i like that were coming out aggressive early
lets go defense get a turnover
how far was that kick
cock sucking motherfucker eat a bag of shit
just another tfl
how do people think wed fair against a team like the chiefs im genuinely curious

would be fun to watch
let that shit bounce into the endzome cmon man
lets get a runback from dj

edit oops ray ray i meant
number 65 has reported as eligible
im a huge proponent of fielding punts inside the 10 because of how adept at backspin modern punters are but when you have 3 guys inside of two yards of you all unblocked even ill say to let that go
yeah jc
time to get to work lets bleed out this first quarter on our way to a td
i can not believe he outran that d back lol
finally
we can run
go steelers
geez
i guess ben didnt see washington open there
what was ben even going for there
man can they talk about the jaguars anymore
this jacksonville quarterback seems good he is mobile reading us pretty well making decent throws i like him
we needed that pick
deep claypool touchdown on this drive
lord what an effort to get positive there
conner really celebrating a 2yd rush
wow what a catch
dj is looking good today
stop running the football
stop running it for fucks sake
that was an ugly run
a more accurate ball to dj is a td there
working stack working stack and loses track of it no interference
ok conner
chase gotta go to the ball and stop flopping for pi
good shit jc
why do we run mcfarland between the tackles and connor to the outside
uh didnt he just get tackled no pi
i do wish if they were so insistent on getting him the ball theyd do it on more passes he has good hands overall for a rb
ebron time
man he could have gone outside no yeesh
conner is showing up today big time
seems whenever we run on 2nd an long then have 3rd an long its an obvious throw and the d eats it up
jeeeeeez
twice now we are rolling and decide to run twice for nothing then incomplete on 3rd somebody tell randy the bar down the road is doing all day happy hour and get him out of here
these third down conversions are killing us
bens angry now
ben trying to force it there
i dont really get why ben made the throw he was looking at it the the entire way so he mustve seen the double coverage i guess dionte got outside leverage on the out but i still wouldve liked to see ben come off of that
man juju is open on so many of these plays
guess what its not fichtners fault that the offensive line is getting blown off the ball and ben is throwing it right to jacksonville
i really fucking hate this allstate ad comes on constantly when im at work and i always think inception is on only to get disappointed when i look up from my desk and see that stupid ad again

doesnt matter how many times i hear it my dumbass reacts the same every time
swear we always play like ish in jacksonville
jag are consistenly running at he left side of the line

man no sacks no ints but weve been so close sooooo many times
i just want to let everyone know that im sitting in a different chair wearing a different shirt and baking some breadso ive broken my routine hopefully im not disturbing the juju or being a jynx
it was pretty out of reach but nelson is going to be kicking himself for that one
how about that blocking by pouncey there
pouncey got away with being downfield early there
where the yell is our offense man wth tomlin can we please stead it out
jujus always bringing that polynesian power
thanks jack
juju strong
run on the first so a second run coming
run run pass punt here we come
im just waiting for juju to get an unnecessary roughness call on him for bullying some of these guys
yes dw
big play james
how about a 3rd down delay handoff up the middle
holy crap

pass and catch
is it just me or does he slip a lot
1st down
see flair
first down stillers
the pools bigger than the brook today
chase is on the case
that ad break was just long enough for me to listen to the george washington rap

i figured other people needed to know that
hes based
mmm i love tackles for a loss
wtf
they shoved each other no wtf
wtf
wtf
thats so weak
stupidest fucking play ever
oh dude why why why why would you do that
soft fucking call
why the hell would you do that nelson
wtf is nelson doing
that should have been on both guys
are you fucking kidding me
did the center literally just say exactly where robinson was gonna be going
these blitzes just arent hitting home
i feel like nelsons regressed this year
no one within 20 yards if him lmao
good blast doubles
defense getting shredded here lmao
cant give baby chark that much cushion
no cam
cam no
sick bottle spin
id hit the whipped cream over the bud light too
missed false start there
conner getting a few extra yards by reversing field and by bouncing outside may be more harm than good in the long run dude just needs to put his foot in the ground a head up field
what a fucking catch
westerville central high school stand up
lets go
prevent defense just gives the offense freebie 20 yard passes i hate it
holy shit int
all receivers on rookie contract qb on rookie contract
woooooooo
yo another pick lmao
bince does not play friends during games i guess
2020 huh
int
here we go
i called 34 getting a pick the other day yes
lets goooooooo
hope we really try to score here instead of halfassing it to halftime
i would have been 10x more surprised if he didnt throw a pick lets go boys
i feel a pass to claypool in the parking lot is coming
steelers big man you posting in this thread how is the game
and you guys say the announcers dont cause this shit lol they hopefully wont throw a pick here they said
i have a weird feeling were gonna see the end of the sack streak today obviously i hope it stays but luton seems to be trigger happy even to throw it away
he looks like his name should be winger
thats right bby draw that pi
2 plays and a fg dont fuck it up

talking to you randy
flag baby
finally a good dpi call a really obvious one but still
dammit ben
mapletron had him dead to rights
claybrooks had to do that cuz that was a td for claypool
i love that ben has a guy where he can get those flaccos
flacco airball
lmao everytime i love you chase
ah yes the ol throw deep and hope for dpi
run it up
thats what i wanna see well take an easy three points before the half
just like in the titans game
remember when flacco used to do that to us all the time
bad ben
oopsie
son of a bitch
dionte was wide open
ugh shouldve just thrown it away and kicked the fg
greedy
thats no big deal
uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
settle for a 173 lead

yeah okay
oh no anyway
ive seen this movie before
cmon just take the three
that was fucking frustrating
take the 3
yeah whatever jacksonville you shits
we make it so easy for some teams
jags still dangerous since they got nothing to play for
most inconsistent offense ive ever seen
fing why

x200b

run run deep pass out

i dont even know who we have behind joe
haha eye for an eye
this is interestint
joe burrow is seriously hurt
yeah theres our sack
sack baby
finally
tj gave him a noogie thats fucking awesome
bear hugging tj literally fuck this officiating crew
boom here we go d
67
sack streak continues
ray ray learned from that mistake
joe burrow is down having his left knee checked
i can rest easy now
king tutt
does anyone have a link to live stats for the game i cant find them anywhere and im trying to figure out how many receiving yards a few players have
barely got that
that punt was mid
totally banged up defense hopefully we capitalize on this and add more to our lead
nice hit
great stop
they 100 would have gotten that third down with a run lmao
wthgoing for it
thats an odd strategy
oh please stop them here
why the intentional delay of game there lol
if bud just goes for the ball hed have way more ffstrip sacks lol
nfl teams and players always give back to the community
jags are confused
what the hell are they doing
it doesnt appear that the jaguars even know what the jaguars are doing right now
mastermind of jacksonville
such a nice guy that bud is hits your qb but lays him down gently practically tucked him in
i guess the mickey mouse bullshit kinda worked ray ray was nervous about not having the full punt team out there
some really poor offence on the last few plays
he had that first
qb sneak mf
rhino for 2
just sneak it
hope joe burrow is ok looked like a rough hit
ez
connor making them look stupid
never mind that worked actually
whew that was a little lucky
1st down 1 yard run
damn man
is haden still out
feel like im gonna get some use out of this
bud hug
we keep getting this type of pressure theyre going to make a mistake again
how many interceptions have we dropped today
bud got a buddy
aight o leggo
lets go ben defense needs a rest
is haden ruled out i was driving during that point in the game so havent seen or heard anything
right off the helmet tough
gotta catch that chase
2nd and 1 is the new 3rd and 1
jags are dropping like flies
juju back on the field bless him
these injuries are horrible let it stop
we have tight end sighting
we are playing like shit this game taking a lot of wind out of the sails
man they are banged up just search that 1 v 1 and we should get a flag every single play at this point they cant hold our guys without a foul
claypool make em miss
i will definitely get a bosgod jersey
why no fucking replay
ray ray respect
ray ray is so fast
most obvious run play in the history of obvious run plays
tennessee took the lead
watch conner get injured in a game thats over because for some reason we still want to keep him in there
damn it philly
beautiful right there
any update on juju
god damn what the fuck was he thinking with that tackle
i feel bad for juju now
lfg
lets go
dagger
ok pull all the starters
i actually really wish i could watch the last 2 minutes of the ravens game rn
if titans win today and we beat ravens do we clinch the division

forgot about the browns lol
is dobbs inactive put him in for some revenge szn
damn that was pick 6
almost had em again
great stuff overall run game wasnt as bad as last week at all
minkah
eat up boys
minkah
theyre playing some funky music
ok i feel bad for their rook lol
at what point do we start feeling sorry for luton
can someone explain how this isnt a heart attack game
this guy passes like me in madden
minkah
minkah
minkah
this guy fucking suckkkkksss
hit the ground
ah yes the pre victory line up
jags are toast
and to think i was a bit scared of jay gluten
face mask
benny doesnt hit the hole as much as he sorta sees what the hole is up to first then makes a move
juju has a toe injury
wooooooooo
10 and 0 woooooooooooooo
great game guys go titans
i wanna see the full 10 minutes
da faq goin on down 03 tomlin gotta gooooo ben washedddd we need ab back
why are we like this
we arent going to beat good teams playing like we are scoreboard doesnt tell the full story i feel like weve made a lot of poor decisions
gonna be a frustrating game lolhopefully the steelers got the bs out with that drive by the jags
why is our special teams so bad during these trap games like wtf
does our offense ever have a game plan they literally come out and run random plays hoping they work and dont try to break down defenses
jacksonville is so bad this is fucking embarrassing

nelson fucking sucks
yall still say who cares about those 3 points games can change so quickly
this one goes over the head of mccloud

forget about it mccloud youre out of your element
when i saw spilane covering him i knew where it was going
those jag uniforms match their seasons performance so far fucking putrid
why the fuck would you try that this early
so if we had to lose a game this week would we rather lose this one or the ratbirds
looks like were using the second half offense early this week given the results id say thats a good call
terrible canaday
he would miss against the jags lol
i knew they were going to jinx it knew it in my bones never fails lol
god that was dumb let the ball go
this is gonna be a blowout
why is our run blocking complete dogshit
fuck you state farm

can we score at least one td before we throw away two plays to anthony ffs
thats 2 batted passes 2 almost picks and a missed deep ball from ben something about the jags gets to him
oh look no jinx and we get a fg interesting

lots of dropped ints for both teams today
slept thru the first quarter after driving to a campsite to pick up the other half at 7 am whatd i miss
anyone else wondering why the mods havent updated the bengals record to be accurate with their six losses
as much as a running game helps not needed right now we need to play to our strengths get the lead and then mess around granted its what were doing now but the first few scripted drives are always so off
dammit spillanebush makes that tackle
weak ass call
nelson sucks
its obvious that conner did something to someone getting screwed out of goal line carries week in week out
i wouldnt put your money on edmunds getting a pick

his first ever
bruh luton got picked off by edmunds lmfaooooo
i hate flacco ball so much but ill take it
fr tho does tomlin hate james conner
shoulda threw that towards the middle there where washington had leverage and another inbreaking route was coming open in the endzone
trying to give a receiver a chance probably should have taken the 17 point lead they do get the ball though
evan washburn is so pretty
fans youre going the wrong way

mccloud what

fans youre going the wrong way

mccloud how would you know where im goi oh shit
thats randy best worst playcalling in the nfl fitchner to you
oh nooooo no no noooo joe
dammit
fuck
plz no
fuck fuck fuck fuck
this is bad
fuck please not joe
ugh the yearly haden injury hopefully its not serious

is tj watt playing today i havent heard his name yet
oh nvm
it feels like they want plays to be before the sticks as much as possible like its a good thing to have third down four times a drive
in the 3 and a half hours of a football game with all the ads timeouts and penalties how much time is spent actually playing live football
got to catch that
of course i have ebron in fantasysorry i cursed him
chase gotta make that catch
every team holds and pis our wide receivers when they go deep every damn time especially claypool
masons best game in steelers shirt
why does claypool fall everytime he goes for the ball whether or not hes interfered with lol
no wonder people consider us the worst 90 team of all the time holy shit we should be kicking ass this team has one win
i hate how tomlin tucks his tail in between his legs when we have a decent lead just fucking bury them so we can pull the starters late games its the 18 jags ffs
bos coming up with that performance anxietysheesh
if it comes down to the wire its on that right there why force that shit man
this fucking team not gonna win a super bowl starting games like this they do it literally every week
jordan berry blows
asleep
come on ben has to hit dj there what a bad throw
ben realizes that he can throw above the d lines hands right seems like every throw is almost or is deflected
conner would be a decent 2 rb hes not an rb 1 with his vision and lack of explosiveness
thats stupidly unnecessary just take the 3 points and get the ball back in the 2nd half stupid by ben
no no this could literally end his career
i hate this game so much
this is gonna be a long game boys
that was a terrible pass lol

bens been so spotty this season

edit downvoted because its true most batted down passes at the line of scrimmage etc
trap game
ben isnt a good garbage time qb
butler putting tj watt in the middle to rush the qb is fucking infuriating fire this idiot already
yall down voted me last time but ill say it again jordan berry blows
was that benny snell football because i dont like it
i always think its funny that the steelers media is always showing haden one handing catches during warmups but he drops everything that touches his fingers in game
time to start talking 190
djs biggest weakness are his hands in a year or two he will become the next donte montcrief
how can we be so happy about being undefeated when our offense looks anemic and boring every week
come on
interesting what happened to mondeaux on that run
so what ben are we going to get
3 and out incoming
big time play by allen
you gotta catch those
thats a big 3 points in a game like this
and yet another opening drive without a td
spillane cant cover for shit
maybe our defense can score a td
nice job d okay offense let ben sling it just abandon our absolute trash running game
so we just keep playing for the field goal right our offense fucking stinks
ben fixates on johnson too much he always looks for him on 3rd down
a tuddie here will demoralize the jags lets do it
throwing short of the sticks come on ben
thats kind of a bullshit callhelmet to the back sucks but how else do you want him to make a diving tackle
huh another run on 1st down weird
yeah im ok with that call take the first if you can get it id rather both but meh
god damnit why are we making a team like fucking jacksonville look decent
way to go ben
i didnt want to jinx an unnecessary ben int but i fucking knew that was coming
jesus ben dont try and tackle him
man i would not have thrown it deep in the middle of the field there one deep pass down the sideline to try to get a td incomplete kick a field goal i think that was the better play but whatever we get the ball back at halftime
first 3 and outugh
goddammit
fml
omg dupree
fuck it as an ou fan lincoln riley can be interim oc for the rest of the season
ray ray doesnt call fair catch in the end zone calls fair catch when its wide open
if we score quick and get the ball back i say take ben out what you guys think
dae kind of want the ravens to win today i dont really want to face a ravens team that is coming off three consecutive losses
honestly impressed that browns will be 73 by end of the day
our defense is looking pathetic
look at that tj forces a bad throw with pressure when he rushes from his side

seriously fuck keith butler man what an idiot this guy is
bens deep ball is gone guys we have to accept it
im not a doomer but this one feels cursed
dj to juju happy birthday i got you a free agency
about to get shutout in the 1st quarter
another freaking offsides
our offense is dog shit not going to beat the chiefs in a shoot out
i hope we take a ss early in the draft edmunds is our weakest link

an elite offense wouldve finished that drive with 7 cannot believe we didnt make jacksonville pay for that dumb play call
robinson is gonna pound us into the ground isnt he
wow we couldnt even get 3 smh
ben with 2 picks in the end zone this season stop it
awful decision youre there for a field goal attempt fucking hell ben

can spillane get off the field

tomlining
mcfarland is trash dances in the fucking backfield instead of just running
conner is awful

out for the season guarunteed

edit alright thank goodness i jinxed it i didnt want to be right believe me
edmunds is garbage

no
gtfo of here with this dumb shit
no and please turn in your towelif you even have one
if it gets 5 million likes coach t should do it

why are you wearing a ufo on your head
milwaukee markers are best markers

here too there are basically no jag fans
what would you expect lol
do you want a jinx because this is how you get a jinx
its working you can feel the tension building in the jags
im surprised gates open that early make sure we hear you on the broadcast
wow a game with no jags fans what a concept
thats the biggest scoreboard ive ever seen how big is that thing
all the yinzers eventually make their way down south
i have that same terrible towel
i use that exact same towel
this did age well
this mf is a time traveler
idk if they are blending in with the seats but i cant even a jags fan in this picture
i was there too and man it was steelers themed in jacksonville the whole weekend felt amazing and loved interacting with all our fellow steelers fans

so normal

i was at the christmas game in houston a couple 3 years ago and it was easily 75 steelers there too it was closer to 5050 tailgating tho houston folks have some amazing setups
thats normal when the steelers play a bad team
im convinced its about 45 bucs fans 45 dolphins fans and 10 jaguars fans in florida
this is the way
jacksonville has a huge steelers fan base down there
no way it was 90 easy
it was 8020 steelers points as well
literally 8020
way less than 8020 if there were more than 10 fans i would be shocked i have an hd panorama i can cross reference
nice same thing in dallas a couple of weeks ago
cuz we are the worlds team

dont get me wrong i want him to get more than one td next game but wouldnt it be awesome if he got one so it could be 11 games 11 tds and the number 11
i wonder what the chances are he can get 7 more in the next 6 games
fantasy pickup of the year fr
born 30 minutes from me and have him in me pool its a good time to be a homer
i really wanted him to score again today so he could havetie the record for most tds in his first 10 games
10 games with touchdowns


0 games without touchdowns

im ok with us being that aggressive when were up 14 its not itll affect momentum even we get the second half kickoff
no harm no foul
this post is perfect
our quarterback has insecurities about not being the hero its the price we pay for his talent live by the ben die by the ben or as tomlin put it once hes a gunfighter sometimes gunfighters get shot
completely agree its great to be aggressive until you need them to not be
we dont settle and things of that nature
i can live with that play up 14 i think things are a bit different in a close game i think the clock in bens head was a little fast had to get a throw off to save the fg but just booming it out of the endzone wouldve been the right call

i actually was surprised we even went for a score tbh so it kinda felt like house money



looks pretty good do you work for nfl pro shop
damn thats clean man
what exactly is the fix i just see a snell jersey
why not mcfarland
bumble bee jerseys orange square jerseys
works
shut up and take my money
hey i have a buddy who works at balph lauren if youd like me to get you an interview theyre always looking for top talent
it still makes me really sad to see bell on other teams even though it made 100 sense for both sides he was my favorite player ever
how do i fix my brown jersey

it says new york in the picture
well her closet obviously
looks like a salute to service sweater maybe definitely looks more vintage
bro shes wearing it go get it
thats definitely vintage as someone who buys a shitton of vintage pittsburgh merch ebay is your best bet but grailedcom could work as well use the searchterm vintage pittsburgh steelers crew neck
bae moore
she is so hot
can i get whats wearing that shirt
i think this may be a mid 90s sweater shirt my dad has this in grey


i think edmunds is a lot better than people give him credit for but also that ball was horribly overthrown and right to him lol

edit alright 2nd one was all him good play and good catch
and another one
34 coming out in force today he shows that he is a true asset to our team
the first pick was a gift that second one was a great read and athletic play i have hope he can still be a long term piece im not expecting a bud like rise but im not putting completely out of the realm of posibility
terrell edmunds perfectly filled a hole the quintessential steeler pick has started every game since drafted he has always served as a great safetyvalve safety outstanding openfield moves and solid coverage his biggest downside has always been ball skills but a lot of that is opportunity with how the rest of the d is playing the last 20 games hes finally getting his chances to play the ball he has shown great improvement yeartoyear

i really dont get the hate even read something earlier about him still being the weak link he is not he is one of the strongest links that holds this defense together and allows the playmakers to do their things just because he isnt flashy doesnt mean he isnt key its good to see him get rewarded for all his service

i feel bad for him his o line is god awful he seems like he gets hit every throw look at last week man was limping every snap shit sucks prayers tho
let cincy ruin him then we can pick him up for a steal
this is fucking enraging promising young quarterbacks take note before going to play for that trashass franchise they do not care about protecting you there
is it an acl injury i didnt see the hit
get well soon

dude deserved so much better than the bengals draft a stud talent and then put up some tissue paper to protect him fucking bungles

hope he recovers fully guy can ball
poor dude they should have either spent big on oline or brought in a journeyman to get smacked around behind that line for a year if they couldnt do that how do you take a great promising qb and put him out there in year 1 to get abused
he deserves so much better i hate seeing talent like that being wasted freaking bungles man not giving him the proper protection he deserves
made me hella sad when i saw him getting carted off hope he recovers fast
mike brown should have that team yanked from him cheap piece of shit wont even pay for an o line for his franchise qb hope burrow makes a full recovery and signs to a franchise with standards
here is the injury very sad
kid is money shame on the bungles for giving him that o line
he deserved so much better
you hate to see it
fuck man hope he bounces back real quick prayers to that young man

oh yeah and fuck the bengals coaching staff for putting him in that situation they finally get their franchise qb and this how they do him
didnt watch this game but based on the steelers game this is the coaching staffs fault what kind of moron is running fake punts to extend drives in a hopeless game where their rookie qb is taking hit after hit like seriously its vanity on their part to try and make it look better protect your qb from himself

wishing him a speedy recovery but screw the bengals coaching staff
bengals fan here and a huge burrow fan coming in peace after last season i had almost lost all hope in the franchise i was mocked jokingly but still sucked at school for rooting for a team that i wanted to succeed because someone from my hometown was on it eifert and now bates iii i dont watch college football but after we drafted burrow i went back and watched a bunch of his games and realized he wasnt just a great player he is a great human he never forgot his small town and everything he does traces back to his roots i appreciate men like that and so i appreciate this post thank you from a bengals fan
ts and ps

nasty hit hate to see it hes been a bright spot on that otherwise garbage team
i hate seeing rookies get hurt bad like that
hope hes okay but hope he goes to a much better team soon id hate to see him be the next jake plummer who was too shellshocked from all those years at arizona to be really successful on the broncos
im just going to sidestep some of the choice cincy comments and post a link to his charity since i didnt see anyone else do it in the thread



bonus is that the area in question is pretty much as close to pittsburgh as it is to cincy
sad to see this burrow is a gamer wish him the best
i got crucified for 10 weeks for saying joe burrows oline was gonna get him killed and here we are

i feel really bad for the dude he has been a real ray of hope for the bengals hopefully he comes back from whatever this is and does well
hope he gets well soon man so tired of the bengals browns and whoever gase is coaching ruining peoples lives like this
burrow take my knee
hopefully he comes back and makes a case for me to hate him
feel so bad for him you can only get sacked so many time before statistical probability catches up joe had to play against the defense and his own oline every game
hope hes ok
best wishes on recovery joe you are the only non steeler player in our division i like
needs that mobility to play his style of game hope this doesnt turn into a carson wentz situation cw has never been the same without the threat of the run postinjury
win a ferrari but dont buy any insurance
i love seeing stuff like this from steelers fans man
if theyre smart they shut him down for the rest of the season he already has taken a seasons worth of punishment they arent going anywhere get him healthy get some offensive line help for him in the offseason and go forward

but these are the bengals so they will totally rush him back onto the field so he can take 6 more games of needless punishment bengals are going to bengal
hopefully is not so serious
deserved way better
prayers up what a nasty injury and what a crappy organization that caused it to happen

joe and the rest of that team deserve more than their owners gm and coaches
lifting joe up godspeed your recovery
i felt so bad seeing that pop up on tv was having a fantastic year
seeing this post at the top of the sub just shows me how much class the steelers fan base truly has when we could be celebrating our 100 start we all still take the time out to respect our division rivals qb going down for the season proud to be a steelers fan
sending some positivity to you joehopefully its not as bad as it looked
i got downvoted to fuck in the game thread for saying that sucks hes a fun player and im sorry bengals fans so fuck the bengals fuck their fans but god bless joe burrow
dude was having a really good season too and looked good every time he touched the ball sad
really enjoyed what ive seen of him this year such a shame hope he comes back 100 looking forward to many more battles with him in the coming years
looking forward to a speedy recovery and his assistance in making this rivalry mean something again
poor guyif steelers fans know anything its how much qb injuries suck hope burrow gets a new team honestly guy deserves better
it actually broke my heart to see him carted off best of luck to this guy amazing guy on and off the field
ts and ps
class post op best of luck to joe
i like joe he is a fierce competitor who will be a worthy opponent for years to come i hate the bengals but i wish joe a healthy and quick recovery
this is awful damn
word hes a baller everyone seems to like and respect the dude
regardless of teami hope this guys career isnt over as soon as it started i prayed for this kid as soon as i heard he got hurt their season is over hope he heals for next year
went into bengals sub to wish him well and got downvoted to hell and many mean messages from my genuine comment they are very hurt right now
sucks man he will bounce back for sure
i hate this for him he was on the verge of so many rookie records i wish him a fast and full recovery
man knees arent supposed to bend that way shame
man poor dude behind that line
come back stronger and better the nfl is more fun with quality qbs
bengals are just the jets without media attention joe b deserves better hope he fully recovers
whats the latest
hope he gets well soon dudes legit
yeah i hope hes ok i dont like to see this for any team
poor kid hope he can recover from this it looked horrific
everyone and their mother knew that he would be sent there to die behind that atrocious oline what a shame
hope he comes back just as strong

also hope they have better o line when he comes back
get better afcn bro
it sucks to like a player so much when theyre a bengal but i really like joe burrow and i hated seeing this happen cinci needs to desperately revamp their oline
need this guy in the league hes a gem get well soon joe
this hurts me as an lsu fan even though ive always been a steelers fan i will always root for joe too he deserves so much better one day i hope to see him in black and yellow
it takes a genuine trooper to take dozens of shots every game and still get up this madlad was still on the field after tj watt rattled him for an hour straight heres to a speedy and painless recovery this man deserves so much better
hope he heals up quick i hate seeing this happen ill be sending a prayer his way tonight
hope hes okay im tempted to see what rbengals is saying about this but going there always makes me angry
prayers up
watched him at the ohio state have the best season at lsu and win the heisman and the natty carve up the browns secondarys jd make some amazing plays in his rookie year hope he gets better soon and recovers well this kid is gonna be a star
feel bad for the kid i knew his career wasnt going anywhere as soon as he became a bungle
man that oline hope he will be back and better next year though
absolutely gutted about this
what happened
as a steelers fan living in cincy i have to admit this is one of the few bengals players ive ever rooted for because i genuinely believe he is a good guy and i want the best for hi hope he can come back healthy and maybe with a better oline to support him next year would hate to see his career go to waste just because the bengals tight wad organization doesnt want to pay for decent players
should have done what eli did
have they released what the injury actually is other than a kneeleg
they simply are going to ruin his career without an offensive line to protect him
i said it in the game thread but ill say it again tee higgins has been a good player for them but they should have spent that pick on an offensive lineman instead you have to protect your qb and cincinnati didnt do enough worse yet they asked a rookie to routinely drop back and pass 50 times a game to just be competitive burrow is a great talent but you shouldnt put him in that position still i still question why they traded dalton too there was no need to rush burrow out on the field in a shortened offseason even if he did end up being ready to answer the call
guy has been balling out trying to make that team work even if its somehow not serious you bench him for the rest of the year he does not have to prove anything more at this point do not rg3 or luck this guy bengals
i hope he recovers well he has looked great thus far shame he didnt have the oline help to keep him safe the division is much more fun when all the teams in it perform well
this guy is an absolute stud sucks he plays for such a disgraceful organization deserves so much better get better soon joey b
terrible shame to see a promising young player get this injury he was easily going to be afc rookie of the year too
what happened im out of the loop im only concerned about the steelers
does anyone got the clip of the hit

i was really impressed with his play in the steeler game

x200b

heres hoping its operable and fully recoverable good luck burrow
seems like a good dude hope he gets back in there soon
ive been afraid for him since he got drafted knowing there wasnt an o line to protect him poor kid
rest up going man get better and cant wait to see you out there next year
burrow is definitely a talented player with a bright future if the bengals give him a line to protect him you hate to see it happen
he should come to the steelers
really unfortunate well wishes his way knowing he will be trouble in the future
not an expert on injuries but watching it in real time i thought he had a joe theismann type injury dont know which is a quicker recovery a compound fracture or torn acl either way hopefully the kid recovers soon hopefully it doesnt have any long term effects on his game as a steelers fan i hate how much i like watching him play haha thoughts and prayers for sure
as much as our rivalry goes no one deserves this
i hate to see this so sad for a rookie that was playing so well at least this doesnt really affect their season considering their season was already lost
here is a youtube doc reviewing the injury frame by frame tough to watch the actual injury but the explanation of what happened on the field is interesting unsurprisingly it boils down to knee bad it makes me sick thinking about this dude having that happen hopefully it is just a road bump in what will be an awesome career not an endpoint

good luck burrow my heart goes out to you for a full and speedy recovery
i honestly cant tell if this post title was meant to be sarcastic

feel bad for the guy and the bengals though they had a shot to win a couple more games this season and build off some positivity if they cant get this dude some help next year burrows gonna have a long painful couple years
it hurts to see this happen to anyone but especially to someone with such an amazing gift hope to see him on the field again soon

my buddy and i were talking about how good he looks and how trash his oline is not an hour before it happened the poor guy he deserved so much better
bungles curse

should have pulled an eric lindros i dont know a football equivalent
i actually do feel bad for him i hope his career goes the way of carson palmer he gets paid but his team still blows he seems like a good dude and i hope he sticks around i just hope his team is always losing
it was bound to happen since they posted that gif on their twitter which we broke their qbs leg so the curse strikes again
giphy jay cutler dont care
fuck joe burrow and any other bengals qb why is this here were a steelers sub
removed

last i checked this is the steelers subreddit why is the top post about a bungle
fuck him and the horse he rode in on



dude locked up here shutdownrestart

he has als my man
delete this holy shit
hes never had a losing season and were always competing for a playoff spot not really sure why youre asking for him to be fired
tbh i feel like ben talks on the sidelines more to josh dobbs than that other guy plus it looks like they are drawing up plays together
i love dobbs and while i dont know if hes got what it takes to be the next guy for us at qb i can see a career trajectory being like that of kellen moore in dallas
remember the eagles game where dobbs told ben to do the double move to washington for the td
ive actually noticed that too every time bens on the sideline hes in dobbs ear makes me think hes the one being groomed to ascend to the throne
randy is trash whenever we are in hurry up we shred these dumb jet sweeps need to stop
fun story of mine i saw him at ikea a couple years ago and it didnt dawn on me until after we left i pointed him out to my wife and said that looks like a dollar store brand ryan shazier on the drive home i had the wait a minute moment


again not even on espns honorable mentions of top 10 rookies for 2020
he has gotten a pi on at least all of his past 4 games and probably more i cant tell if he is drawing these calls or if his defenders are really doing him this dirty regardless these penalties have helped keep the pittsburg drive alive
hes big and fast these dbs are helpless even if they play perfectly hes got an advantage
hes huge hes gonna get mugged all the time because dbs cant hang with him

exit fucking beautiful haiku
its cause he is beating players on routes and they would rather dpi than give up a touchdown
a pi is a first down
hes beating guys with his athleticism and they have no choice but to hang onto him in order to prevent easy tds
i think that one where he was tugging his jersey im not sure if they were more the defender knew without a doubt they claypool had a touchdown he had to do it
hes hard to cover for the defenders its basically take a pi or give up a touchdown when they get best like that and the better move is to just tackle him

i miss this man

buzz on steeler gal
my only issue is that im 61 with a long torso and the jersey isnt long enough but thats to be expected with a womens jersey
those are my favorite im sad they dont wear them anymore the color rush ones are my favorite now
hell yea bumblebees for life haha
please tell me you have link my grail jersey is a bumblebee heath and i cannot find my size for the life of me ive had a special notification on ebay for like 3 years now and still nothing
nice pick on jersey number as well watt is an animal that deserves all the steeler love us fans can give him

e n c r o a c h m e n t
we dont concern ourselves with losses and things of that nature


the record is the record
i want to keep seeing this every week

this is the way
im a simple man i see smiling tomlin or edited martavis tweet i upvote
i see tomlin face i upvote
wild because us psu fans have both sides of this stat lmao
my team
wanna see me do it again
king of the north
fire mike tomlin
and the ravens lose again
we desperately need to lose a game or two the pressure of 160 is not only bad for my health but also for the pressure it adds on to playoffs
thats what happens when you cant see past lunch
good thing we listened to the yinzers and fired tomlin
so how soon can we clinch the division if we beat the ravens thursday i think we eliminate them from winning the division so all we have to worry about is cleveland
when the standard is the standard and we stop living in our fears

bengals better spend their first two picks on ol this guy deserves better
that fucking sucks for him hopefully he comes back healthy next year
the minute cincinnati drafted him i was afraid this was going to happen theyd better get some help for this kid on the oline next year such a shame seeing all that talent wasted
big oof deserved so much better
removed
the bengals are really gonna fuck this kid up and its a damn shame
sucks for the kid at least they have to blame somebody besides us for it
hes a very exciting player to watch heres to a speedy recovery

a legit ray of sunshine in an otherwise dreary year
the steelers next man up mantra is really being taken to heart by these back up players

lets take a moment and celebrate the holding call that tj watt got today
come on titans please


edit lets gooooooooooo
loltimore
trap week avoided
i cant believe juju injured himself on a penalty flag
imagine not being at double digit wins by this point in the season
100 and how sweet it is lets get down to business

bad

canaday been a season long issue but we paid the price today on his poor snap causing bos to miss the fg probably a good thing we brought in a ls this past week just to be safe

2nd and long runs why why why why why i like randy unlike most of you but dear god why are so we committed to running on 2nd and 9 i counted 2 today which is 2 too many utilize the quick pass to get those yards if anything


good

tyson alualu welcome home big man from batting the ball to plugging the gap this guy does it all and makes a huge difference for us

edmunds the one knock on him throughout his career thus far is his ball skills and thats a fair criticism he sure showed that to not be the case today and grabbed two picks two he doubled his career ints haters are in shambles but a very solid day for him

minkah minkah doing minkah things nothing to see here

berry it took our aussie to get cut but he came back with a vengeance looking real nice out there as of late

conner got a lot of shit as of late but he showed up today and to his credit he made a lot of his own doing the line didnt look that impressive for run schemes but he showed out

diontae young goat wr1 picking up where he left off and that connection with benjamin is growing and growing lord have mercy on defense that have to cover these receivers best in the league bar none

titans taking baltimore to ot in a physical game while they have to travel to pittsburgh on a short week lets go baby

100 dont let anybody tell you different bring on baltimore lets fucking do this thing
ravens are 3rd in the afcn bwahahaha
a lot of complaining from folks today but it was a good easy win if you ask me they basically coasted through most of the game and won pretty easily it was never that close after the first quarter sure a blowout earlier in the game makes it more comfortable but who cares a win is a win

just because their record sucks doesnt mean theyll lay down for us to run over them 30 isnt needed every game this is the same jags team that was winning against the packers last week going into the 4th quarter defense shut them down and we got the win finished relatively healthy and getting ready for baltimore
guys fichtner is just playing 3d chess he didnt want the ravens to have any new film for thursday hes going to blow open the playbook against them ratbirds im talking more screens and outside runs the whole playbook baby here we go steelers
ravens drop this and they fall below the browns who won their game today patriots loss today too as well as the bengals browns fucked it up by winning
how long has donte moncrief been with the patriots lmao 100 here we go
no big injuries 100 i hope turkey isnt the only bird that gets cooked on thursday
aight edmunds you made us fuckin proud today

keep goin
trap game what trap game
happy birthday juju we love you
i forgot what its like to have an elite secondary

this team is great lol the ravens get well soon joe burrow

go steelers
not bad for a mac qb
i am erect
100 and we beat the powerhouse that is the jacksonville jaguars
remember when colin cowherd said the ravens would go 160 lmao what an asshole
and the ravens lost lol
now we root for the titans to win this in ot
titans win
ravens lose in ot

theyre behind the browns in the division

this is the brightest timeline
hot take minkahs 1st half pick saved the game by shifting the momentum


edit
not really hot take minkah doubters can get fucked and if they still exist should be banished to the shadow realm aka browns sub
lol ravens
ravens lose upvote party
100 time to take care of the ratbirds while enjoying some turkey see yall thursday
10 and fucking 0


holy fucking shit lets go


also come on titans
i fucking told you all not to be worried

but its a trap game
ill take a boring win over an exciting loss any day hope everyone is healthy for thursday
game


blouses
lmao the browns ahead of the ravens in the north now
the steelers are good


not because they beat good teams


but because they beat bad teams
lets go titans
i just checked the ratbirds sub expecting a good laugh but its just pure sadness i almost feel badjk see you assholes on turkey day
taking care of business against bad opponents this team feels different now lets go titans
titans marching down the field and the ravens defense cant do anything
rravens absolutely imploding for better or worse that team will be in full panic mode on thursday
its an amazing feeling having zero drama on this team right now
vrabel is harbaughs father
so now were in this weird situation where the outcome of browns games affects the playoff picture
more mac players please
keep me updated on juju news please
alrighty then checks playoff status go raiders
titans got a chance to win it right now lets fucking go rivalry temporarily suspended
this calmed my nerves a bit but we still have the ravens on thanksgiving knocking hard on wood
fuck baltimore
henry got a td in ot to beat the ravens
bonus coverage rat birds losing shame eagles couldnt do their job in cleveland
steelers are the worst 101112131415161718190 team of all time
all you need to say about this team is that the worst player on defense had 2 picks today
lets go titans in overtime
hahahaha lets gooooooo
i feel like we just won twice today
the eagles ruined our perfect day by letting the browns get a win
ravens lose
reading about this season has been interesting especially when you see

tomlin has never had a losing season
does this mean the ravens are now a trap game
can someone please send a pic of the guy in the stands wearing overallsjust pure steeler nation
decent run game against a good run defense it needs to get alot better but as of today i am happy go steelers
like i said in the other thread mason is good for handing off the ball and knelling
browns gonna have a better record than the ratbirds
and that rat birds just lost today is a good day
just came in to write fuck you baltimore ravens
cleaveland is now 2nd in the division
ravens currently third in the division

looooooooooool
alas no onside recovery

still a great day

get well soon burrow
wheres that info graphic where colin cowherd picked baltimore to go 160 and and the steelers 97 and browns 79 or something anyone post a link
i will say this is probably one of the most balanced games weve played all year in terms of how well our offense was passing and rushing and defense
james conner 13 rushes 89 yards 68 yards per carry

hopefully thats the first step to the return of the running game good game for conner and the offensive line
we would easily score 40 without rrrrrrandy and claypool getting interference on almost every play call that shit also let rudy throw for ducks sake yeah i said ducko
its confirmed cincinatti is our trap game this year with burrow out its even more likely
dionte is for real
titans first sack
so we did our job but go titans
henry 30 yards run wins it
fucktheratbirds
lol ratbirds
based tennessee
its funny this year i dont hear a lot of the tomlin sucks comments lol
titans beat the ravens

texans beat the patriots who beat the ravens

the ravens are not ready for whats coming next week
lol imagine last year that i told you that the browns would be ahead of the ravens 11 weeks into the season
hmm i guess the only good teams we have played are the titans and browns lol
steelers are a second half team cant say i hate it id rather a team that starts slow and finishes strong than the alternative
we not gonna crack that nut with the first swing we gotta work on our warts the standard is the standard
dont stop me nooooooow because im having a goooood time having a goood time
im hoping everyone recovers and heals up quickly were going to need a full roster against the dirty rat birds
titan up
titans win
henry ended it for the titans
titans well in fieldgoal range now
ha ha fuck the ratbirds
and the ravens just lost great day
baltimore just lost
lol ravens
ravens lost
whats harbaugh whining to vrabel about
we clinch the division with a win next week
lets celebrate the titans and their victory too what a good weeknd of football
ratbirds lose
fuck the ratbirds
ravens lose
and ravens lose browns overtake ravens in the standings ouch
minkah with a lacklustre boring game just 2 picks smh
and hey go titans
not related to our game but was just at a bar cheering the burrow injury please dont be those fans get healthy man
my bad guys my son didnt wake up from his nap and put on his lucky juju jersey until the end of the first quarter
any word on juju yet
wow what a quality win i cant wait for our boys to still be ranked 2 in every power ranking this upcoming week
its looking likely that we will see browns vs steelers in playoffs this year
its ravens week
every phase was just fine

back home to host a lets face it mediocre ravens team
titans getting the ball fg wins it
boring ass second half but fuck ill take it especially against the jagoffs defense was fun as hell to watch though
this makes me happy
ok titans fg wins this you got this
we did it
never in doubt
now let the rat birds lose
titans are getting chunks i like
henry is a tank my god
titans win yesh
henry
obligatory minkah appreciation post

ravens in third place
thank you titans 100 aaaaaahhhhhh
ratbirds lost
ravens lost king henry
did we just clinch the afc north
i missed the last quarter and a half any injuries
lets go raiders
oh man diontae is so good he didnt run many deep or complex routes but he didnt need to
100273 blowoutwe need to fire coaches dammit
lets go
started off shaky but we got it done quick turnaround to thursday glad bal went to ot and lost
the reason connor ran well today is they didnt call that stupid tosssweep know your damn personal connor is a northsouth rb and they used him that way this week
i only followed on redzone why did mason have 3 rushing attempts and 4 yards
steelers win liverpool win got my ps5 im on cloud 9 right now
worst team to ever go 100 without scoring less than 24 points a game by far
week 12 will have massive playoff implications for the 1st seed race primetime ravens will be our hardest matchup but the chiefs will also face their hardest opponent tampa even if we lose we need to pray for a kc loss we have a few tough late matchups against the bills colts and browns unless we go undefeated we are gonna need at least one kc loss
i honestly couldve never thought this is how the season would be like but i am excited af the defense is on another level
thursday we win back the north
awesome momentum going into turkey day if titans manage to win in ot id feel very good about our chances
bring on the ratbirds
happy with the win but randy is so bad i am sick and tired of the 2nd and long runs those absolutely kill a lot of our drives offense looked really bad today but at least our defense had its best game so it didnt matter
i love this team
we slaughtered jacksonville this was the sign i needed
where can you watch the postgame conf at
demons have been banished
big shouts to tad dickman
is then edmunds sucks guy ever gonna walk it back or is he still hiding lol
come on titans
2 yards from fg range
46 yards fg as it is

1st down though
game over man game over
titans did it
lets go titans
henry
henry
fuck the ravens
thank you tennessee for beating the ravens
thursday is for the division

edit forgot the browns existed
woohoo fuck the ratbirds
iggles poised to win
i didnt think polamalu would be unseated from being my favourite player but minkah is definitely creeping up and up absolutely love that guy
lamar is the goat savior
i know the nfc east is shit but am i right in thinking that the steelers are now with 6 games to go guaranteed to finish with a better record than all of the nfc east teams
thanks for beating us im hoping we can trade down out of the 2 spot and land a boatload of picks
was terrified going in to the game then we went 30 down and missed the figgy and i got even more scared dont like it at all when we go runrunpass on 1st2nd3rd but other than that i have minimal complaints thought we looked composed throughout another 20 point win and 100 baybeeee
nicethank you
i may sound like a debbie downer but i am not getting hyped until playoffs the way i see it this season is superbowl or bust i remember seeing ben training with juju and connor and thinking to my self he is back and will strive to nothing more than a superbowl win anything else is a failure in my opinion

and as crazy as it sounds i hope they lose a seasonal game as to maybe refocus themselves on the end goal a superbowl just my two sense

other than that i will try and enjoy the ride
i am getting a fucking hard cock over reading the ravens sub rn lawd i cant wait till we cum grind out a win on thanksgiving
k so who do we want to win ten or bal maybe a tie

what is up with today bruh we blowout the jags tj finally gets a hold call edmunds has two picks and hillibilly likes tomlin

if you seriously still think tomlin is a bad coach then youre a lost cause it wouldve been ridiculous to think he was bad coming into the season to begin with

you can use those but last i checked tickets were like 1000 or more
yup you can use resellers but id avoid using stubhub because i personally know more than 3 people who got scammed by them

anyways the best thing for you to do would be to grab 3 more friends and create your own pod since youre gonna have to sit in pods of 4 anyways this way tickets could be cheaper than buying a single ticket or two tickets and share your pod with people you dont know

the best thing would be to wait like hours before kickoff because then tickets drop but you need to be on it to catch it download this app called gametime it sends you push notifications when prices drop
easy to get just google it but really expensive
2 or 4 its almost impossible to get 2 right now unless you pay a ton
youre going to have to buy them from a season ticket holder theyre raffling the limited attendance tickets off to those folks for first right of refusal and with what theyre reselling for not a single person is saying no theyre not doing box tickets at all so crack open your wallet or dig into your life savings if you really want them that bad
this mightve been just a lucky game for him or he might be making a turn to be a quality safety but ive always thought since they drafted him that theyd move him to inside linebacker hes a great tackler and cover tes pretty well and he plays best close to the line of scrimmage i especially thought theyd do it after bush went down but i think everyone craps on him because he doesnt make the big splash plays but he doesnt need to he just needs to be a good tackler and play the pass a tad better and i think he does that perfectly just my thoughts
hes having a great year

he doesnt get splash plays so people hate him
hes definitely thriving next to minkah
edmunds
he was already a quality safety

this game was just randomness coming home to roost
seeing as how it generally takes at least 3 seasons for a db to develop id say edmunds is right on schedule
hes been getting closer and closer to making splashes all season and today came to fruition
i thought that first pick was just a little bit luckybad throw but that second pick was all him
he was always a project when we drafted him so its taken him a few years to learn the defense and learn the position
he either does great or fucks up terribly

the fucking cleveland browns who are now 2nd in the division
im feeling pretty good baltimore just lost in ot and our boys coasted through the last quarter of that jags game we should be in better shape come turkey day lets go 100
well blow them out just like the first time we are browns kryptonite
chubb should be back for that game so he wont make it easy but im confident with the team we have that well find a way
cleveland still has tennessee and baltimore again this season before ending with us again need a win thursday and the division is ours to lose
we dont have to watch out for anybody except our weekly opponentwe control our destiny not cleveland
i for one welcome the browns opportunity to be beaten by the steelers in the playoffs
people always claim parity in the nfl but it laughable there are like 3 good teams in each conference for an average team like the browns being 73 is as likely as 46 given a couple bouncescalls the steelers are so far above the 2nd tier of afc teams that they are playing different games thats not to say we couldnt lose to any nfl team
haaaaaaahahahahahahahahahaa
as a browns fan imagine being worse than the browns lmaoooo
cant wait for them to pay lamar like 45milyr
but i thought they were the second best team in the league behind the chiefs thats what the experts said they had a 11 chance of winning out thats the best in the nfl they looked unstoppable lamar is gonna win every mvp here on out right
could you imagine playing a game and not winning


like wtf ravens
steelers are 100 and we are 20 today titan up
and 9th in the conference

lets goooo
its a great thing to see hahahaha
yesssss
you hate to see that
they are currently closer to being the bengals than to being us this pleases me

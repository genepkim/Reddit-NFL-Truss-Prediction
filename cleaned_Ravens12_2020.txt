grew up a steelers fan
he reminds me of a guy youd see at a gym that tries to outlift everyone there
his face speaks fragile masculinity
he is a mole
he just screams anti mask trump supporter lifted pickup truck wide beater
god he looks like such a tool
i bet he voted for trump
looks like a steeler
i hate to be the guy to call for someones job as her probably has a family and mouths to feed but with the impact this has had why isnt he being fired
you expect players to have lapses in judgement they are young and sometimes immature you dont expect coaches to you expect them to set the example i wonder what the mood in the locker room is players might feel they have been betrayed
he was the type to hear about mask mandates and be like but mah rightssss

hes losing his mind and im reaping all the benefits

washington reunion
get u a contract rgiii
dude dont wish the jets on rg3 i want him to succeed or at least never get hurt again after how much washington nearly ruined his life and career

x200b

lets put him with the patriots next year they have money bellichunk got to experiment with the running style qb for a season already rg3 will be a better success there than cam

trace was put on the list even before lamar sadly

stop the count
cut my life into pieces

bobby 3 sticks please dont throw a pick six
mark is a high risk player leaving it on the field every week for this franchise and fans while wearing an insulin pump for type 1 diabetes covid has not been generous to diabetics this is actually a really scary outbreak now
im praying for all of them any lung damage will likely end a career
reading all of these posts and seeing how many people are positive i would not be surprised to see him opt out now while he is still healthy wouldnt blame him either
i wouldnt worry too much im a type 1 diabetic as well and while it certainly makes covid more dangerous than for the general population its not nearly as bad as for type 2 diabetics with other comorbidities such as hypertension obesity and heart problems hes young and very much in shape that said right now it seems like the ravens have a pretty poor culture when it comes to respecting the health and safety of their players and staff which is a shame

edit for a toplevel athlete longterm complications could also be an issue though which is probably what you were talking about
beginning of the season i had every reason to think he would opt out for this exact reason

hopefully hes at homewouldnt be surprised if hes out of the next 23 weeks
you guys are probably gonna hate me for this but believing that prayer will fix anything has probably got us here in the first place the amount of people calling it a hoax and believing in god is ridiculously high

can we all start listening to scientists from now on and heed their advice instead of useless things like praying and thinking santas brother will do anything at all
good news is for a type1 diabetic whos been managing their a1c it doesnt present much more immediate risk note just being active does not mean he has a good a1c level hopefully he does though a danger it does present is that any illness can throw blood glucose out of whack which can possibly lead to a coma or ketoacidosis regardless theres always the chance of normal covid effects such as lung scarring
i would be okay if he opted out not worth his future
does he have covid or do we not know yet

the fuck head that infected the team being an anti masker in a pandemic with the virus
strength and conditioning coach
literally hitler


the caption being backwards is a nice touch
its definitely been a rough season that what made the 142 soo special
for real though havent heard a peep from mark since like week 1 remember bring your own energy theres no energy no life no sign of brotherhood watching the team last season brought me so much happiness every week this season is just sad
madden curse rip
damn
back to 4chan incel
this is the 2015 season all over again lmao

steve saunders should be fired with cause immediately i am sure the ravens organization is considering all options beyond his current suspension

his job as the head strength and conditioning coach was to keep players healthy strong and in top physical condition throughout a long nfl season his carelessness and inability to follow strict nfl covid19 protocols has put the health and safety of the ravens players and staff at serious risk there is no excuse he can provide to justify his actions

he has potentially caused harm to psl holders that may be in a financial position where they need to sell their psls this off season playing games without starters or forfeiting games could very well cause the ravens to miss the playoffs lowering the value of a psl damaging the reputation of the organization and possibly losing draft choices diminishes fan enthusiasm making it harder to sell a psl

he should be fired immediately so that the ravens organization can distance themselves from his careless selfish actions and move forward to reclaim the reputation of excellence that the organization has built over their first 25 years

shittsburgh squealers
at least theres captain fat fuck
steelers a terrible name all by itself
i just refer to them as bitches
bumblebee bastards

and the usual shitsburgh
shittsburg stoolers pigpen
its ok to just call them the steelers what are you like 9
nah were better than that id rather just beat em on the field than resort to name calling and throwing hissy fits on twitter and reddit
pissburgh shitsburgh and fuck the steelers also call them baby bitches with that blankie they carry around

12 players in total tested positive they need to postpone on sunday
i dont think this season will end well for any team because of covid and i can also add to the list of why things sucked in 2020

dunno man im a dallas stars fan and that run was magically worth it
the season hasnt even started yet all i care about is peaking for festivus
what if goodell takes away some picks that would be cold shit maybe roger takes away a 3rd rounder for the next two years

oh hes a jackass
if you have to call yourself a leader you arent a leader
oof his twitter is filled with letthemplay to resume college sports irony
fuck you steve
fool should be fired for conduct detrimental to the team like big picture we have some at risk players like campbell and andrews and hes pretending it doesnt exist
is this the guy who infected half the ravens team with covid most probably cost them the playoffs this is the guy smh

this is how clippers fans must have felt man leading up to the biggest choke in nba history it cant get worst right fellas haha

i can relate
this is exactly how it feel this is spot on to
spot on
i feel this
weeks
this is how it feels to be a browns fan every week

leaving it here for what if you care so much write a complaint and send it to the nfl and the ravens front office
why squeeler fans keep coming in here and act like we run the team yall look dumb af lol

edit this mf spends more time in the ravens and browns subs imagine spending more time on other team subs instead of your own looking like a fucking idiot lol
lmfao steelers fans so mad rn imagine we beat them with a practice squad theyd cry for the next 20 years
lol the steelers fans in the comments of that post are so fucking stupid they really think the nfl gives us some kind of special treatment

oh wait youre probably one of them
steelers fans so scared of us they want us to forfeit

my god you are straight pathetic trash
how about you fuck off back to pennsyltucky

on some brady shit because it seems like they moving the game because lamar cant play they propping that boy up just for people to tear him down
thats a dumb take barring a complete reschedule lamar wont be playing anyways but yes the tinfoils are out on twitter
this is dumb nobody hates lamar and if they do who gives a fuck hes your quarterback if ravens flock backs him fuck everyone else
theyre moving the game because of covid wtf are you smoking
i doubt the media is going to shred lamar tomorrow theyre going to shred our fo and organization for letting this type of shit happen youd expect this type of shit from teams like the lions jags just bottom feeders but from the baltimore ravens who have been a class organization for years this shit is unacceptable man our team should be ashamed for not following protocols
can we not have dumb conspiracy theories and a victim complex in this sub sports fans are worse than the dipshits that still engage in video game console wars or other dumb meaningless technology brand wars
i hate lamar because he throws like he sees ghosts on the field

so to the fellow ravens fan i ran into at san jose ca total wine tonight nice to know im not alone in the area
big sighs
personally im enjoying assassins creed playing as the ravens clan while pretending every enemy is a steeler

always liked the panthers too for some reason


happy us thanksgiving to you bud
take this upvote and enjoy your chicken bro
all love for the panthers and especially sir purr here happy holidays since thanksgiving is now technically over
panthers are my second favorite team love the players love the uniforms and now love the memes appreciate the lighthearted post theyre rare these days
ftf
hahah thanks sssr bro we needed this
dang that goat looks like turkey weird
is that the murderer

hope no one has too severe of a case and no lingering effects just got over it myself recently and the worst part has been the lingering headaches that come at random
me too i think lost in the anger and scheduling a and confusion is that these guys are facing an actual and potentially serious illness hoping they all recover safe and sound
fr at the end of the day everyones health matters compared to a game of football no matter how entertaining it is
as a steelers fan i came here to share this sentiment while we are all frustrated with the whats going to happen that takes a back seat to these guys facing a sickness that could result in death or long term complications i hope everyone comes out ok and healthy
its really sad how rnfl finds it funny and likes how more ravens players are testing positive because we deserve it or whatever when there are people on our team who are high risk and legitimately can get very sick and even die im so fed up with the widespread belief that because covid hasnt made many athletes really sick its not that dangerous anymore and no athlete can get really sick from it
we live with this in our world today but its much bigger than football and can have life long effects get well ravens we will fight another day when you can bring your a game

and steelers


2019 was a great season and things were looking to continue their upward trajectory in 2020 and then out of the blue earl thomas had sex with his brother and look at us now covid injuries season probably down the shitter and maybe its not all earls fault for having sex with his brother but that certainly seems to be where the wheels started to come off
its been downhill since we fucked the dog against tennessee in the playoffs
earl thomas fucked his brother

i get it but uh lol you know this isnt what exactly happened right lol
this is the type of quality content i come to other teams subs for
thank you for the laugh
i agree although we had some bad luck before earl fucked his brother things were generally going pretty well until earl fucked his brother but from the time earl fucked his brother on things have got worse

romans lost it since earl fucked his brother
ingram got slow after earl fucked his brother
hollywood got the magic screw removed from his foot since earl fucked his brother
everyone whos not injured got covid after earl fucked his brother

and it all started when earl fucked his brother who knew earl fucking his brother would have so many consequences
yes 100 agree never bring cancers on to your team theres a fine line between winning and losing once a guy starts obsessing about money and they diss any teamcoach just stay away from them no matter how good the resume looks
im a new fan i need context lol

fire saunders massive fine if an investigation shows that the ravens knew the strength coach was violating maskdata tracking protocols repeatedly and didnt discipline him loss of draft pick
first they have to prove ravens break any protocol they didnt do anything to other teams with positive cases too like pats
i am not familiar with what the nfl protocols are i assume some were broken but im not sure what are the trackers a nfl thing or ravens insight would be great here

considering the current evidenceassumptions and assuming we broke official nfl protocols

saunders banned from the nfl for life from all positions on all teams
investigation to see if other senior staff were complicitignoring if so 4 game suspension
ravens hit with a 500k1m fine
ravens forfeit a 6th round pick
fire saunders fine the team heavily and investigate to see who was aware of saunders fuckery

if other leaders knew take a draft pick a fifth or a sixth

regarding forfeiture id prefer that be based on the investigation too but obviously time is a factor there and its wrong that the steelers players wouldnt get paid for something that happened in our house so im thinking week 18 might be more likely but forfeiture would be justified
given the circumstances it wouldnt surprise me if they took away a higher draft pick4thfrom the ravens compared to what they previous teams got deducted raiders and saints in order to send a stern warning to other teams
we may be known as the team that ruined thanksgiving at least were not the team that threw batteries at santa

fuck the steelers
thatthat was the eagles
fuck our organization its been known he was a covid denier anti mask wearer this whole time we deserve to forfeit straight up

and today is the first time ever i said fuck our organ
forfeiting the game is worse for our team than any beatdown the steelers could give us
i dont think well forfeit i just think itd be more damaging to our team culture than a blowout would be
also do steelers fans know that if we forfeit their players wouldnt get paid either
but wed only lose by 2 s

while im sending my thoughts and well wishes to all of our guys im especially worried about calais he considered sitting out the year due to his asthma it sounds like hes symptomatic

i hope he bounces back quickly i also hope for no more positives if we play sunday i would not blame a single player for sitting out if i were mark andrews i probably would sit out
brain dead bastards wont understand this
i hd it it n0t tht bad
this is bigger than football something steeler fans and players dont seem to understand

i saw that if the ravens decide to forfeit then both teams wont get paid i highly doubt the steelers dont want to get paid instead the steeler fans and players should suck it up deal with the fact that the 2020 season is a complete dumpster fire due to the pandemic be grateful they even get to watchplay football and just wait to see what will happen to the game
this is heartbreaking and reason 5739472 why all the whining from steelers players and fans has been especially repugnant were talking about human lives here no one has any idea how hard this virus will hit each infected person plenty of people recover just fine and then there are those who dont im devastated for calais and for everyone else who is going through this right now anyone who complains about the inconvenience or unfairness of moved games or tentative schedules or starts preaching forfeiture as if thats the most important issue on the table when were dealing with a pandemic and a terrifying virus is in desperate need of some serious selfreflection
my thoughts and prayers out to your players for a fast and full recovery
i honestly hope we just forfeit and call out the nfl player safety my ass
about damn time this thread gives me hope finally looking at the heath of players on both sides and not thinking this is some nefarious trick to save our sliding record
on the bright side if we do play sunday it would be a massive opportunity for one of the second stringers to step up this has the potential for someone to make a career for themselves and maybe even get the season turned around for us

its a very long shot but opportunity is opportunity and you couldnt ask for a bigger one as a practice squad kinda player

thats pretty much the only positive i can take from this and its not much short of a miracle we deserve something good this season right
if only that were true for most people
not really its human nature no order exudes chaos
maybe if the team had good leadership this wouldnt happen starts up at the top

nfl better not cancel or move the game again your team couldnt properly operate under covid restrictions not anyones fault but your own damn fault
whats up ravens flock safe to say this seasons going to shit so i decided to come up with a big plan on what we should do this offseason to go back to the team we used to be and im determined that if the team follows these steps well have a great 2021 season

1 fire greg roman and steve saunders immediately we need these people off the team immediately after the end of the season if not the end of this week saunders is an asshole who doesnt care about the players or staff and romans offensive scheme has looked predictable and incompetent this entire season we need an oc who can make consistently good schemes utilizing lamar and our offense that helps us win like we did in 2019

2 overhaul a lot of our offense get rid of most of our receivers we need good weapons for lamar and if we overhaul some of our depth we could get a great wr from this stacked free agency allen robinson kenny golladay chris godwin keenan allen juju any one of if not multiple of them would be great accusations if we decide to overhaul get rid of marquise as well im sick of his shit he hurts our chemistry and has been incredibly underwhelming i want him out of baltimore overhaul most of our oline as well i like stanley but we need a lot of help in other areas so we can protect lamar joe thuney would be a great accusation if we overhaul the oline if we take these steps well be golden

3 prioritize team chemistry immediately we are a shadow of the team we were last year in this aspect we need lamar to become a great leader and become the big truss team we used to be this chemistry will help us win games focusing on this is an absolute priority and itll be a lot easier once we get a fresh start on some offensive areas

4 if we get a first round pick under 20 draft a wr we could absolutely get devonta smith if we get a first round pick above 20 draft a de get rid of matt judon a new great player would freshen up the area and potentially give us another defensive superstar prioritize on the oline and defensive areas in the draft find some good new young talent we can build

im confident if we follow these steps we will become contenders again
youve been playing madden w salary cap disabled eh
i hope our next oc comes from the spread offense school if we spread the field more horizontally and vertically then we open up running lanes for lamar on scrambles look at what the cardinals are doing with kyler and how many yards hes getting on scrambles thats what we need like yea sure lamar isnt as good a thrower as kyler but i still think that offense can work really well for us
some items to consider that make this all much more difficult

1 only 30m in projected cap space but with the nfl cap likely to go down next year due to covid lost revenue

2 significant fa losses may happen based on 1 these hit o d and st starters and depthrotation players notables include ngakoue judon wolfe j smith board bowser mcphee ellis ward snead skura rg3 fluker edwards m cox c moore

3 reduced draft picks due to win now trades like ngakoue

4 overhauling a team and prioritizing chemistry are often opposite goals or at least opposite results
lol most of our receivers are 1st and 2nd year receivers giving up on them already is why were so bad at the position they need time
i just want to let you know kennan allen signed a four year extension at the beginning of this year also just because those guys are due to be fa doesnt mean they wont be tagged or extended allen robinson is probably the only wr the ravens could sign out of that list
this whole covid thing might be a blessing in disguise we dont need to be winning football games right now outside of covid this team is not very good at football and this may be our last chance in the next decade to tank for a a top 10 receiver instead of these listless fucks we got running routes right now i hope they continue to show no fight for the rest of this season just like the last 5 weeks and we go 79 or something we need a blue chip receiver prospect its time
but im still throwing on a ravens tee
you know what yeah this sucks knowing we have 2 games in 6 days and 13 guys on the rona list but with our schedule we still have a shot with our forgiving schedule and we need to go 11 for a real shot at playoffs this season has been full of the adversity we faced last year

in the past 3 weeks we have seen glimpses of the offense clicking will it be last year nope but maybe the battle testing will help us as we hopefully claw into the playoff tournament

i know everyone wanted to give the yinzers their first loss on turkey day but how about we get in and spoil their offseason with a move like the giants to the patriots when they were the last wc

is it hopefully fuck yes but all revolutions start with hope

more ways for steeler players to whine
so if sundays game cant be played will we have to forfeit doesnt seem fair since the titans did not have to forfeit
damn who negotiated these clauses the players should consider forming some kind of union or something
approx 20 million dls between all players in potential lost salaries just because of one person stupidity
and a final score of 20
the nflpa is an embarrassment if youre a player how do you not fire all of those clowns
any idea
no we arent
if we forfeit then their 160 is tainted haha
im not sure steelers fans are smart enough to tweet
lol no

also what are the cryptic tweets
tales from the crypt
a forfeit win against the ravens would be the third toughest game on the steelers schedule
league would be a joke if they make us forfeit

they set precedent by moving the titans game earlier this year for a lesser outbreak and we have caused no other rescheduling based on the precedent i can see no fair way in which we have to forfeit
steelers fans need to stfu i get theyre having an undefeated season and thats fair but were in the middle of a global pandemic clearly people arent taking it seriously and theres a ton of players getting covid

i honestly could go either way about if they should postpone or play im not expecting us to win but it would be nice to see if it could be close on the other hand thats a very selfish pov we need to consider every teams health not just ours honestly they shouldnt have had the season on the first place tbh
no steelers fans make up this story
my thoughts and prayers out to you guys that your players have a fast and full recovery from the covid outbreak i wish we could send some replacements to help you guys out i hope this virus is contained and nobody else on your team gets it
thanks bro i know everyone is severely upset about this situation but im only concerned about these guys health mark andrews is a high risk player and ive been scared as shit for him ever since the breakout started i just pray all our guys recover 100 percent football means the world to me but i love our guys more
im upset with this saunders guy as well
im hoping the ravens players impacted get well too without complications im pissed at steve saunders thats it
morale is definitely low but we appreciate you and the rest of our cheese bros
thanks buddy i echo the sentiments of others where we arent so much concerned about the season as we are for the guys and their families could there have been safer decisions made by the coaching staff absolutely at this point we just want everyone to be okay and we are pissed that were at this point hope all is well
bro dont you got a job lol
removed
you do know our sub literally controls nothing that the ravens do right
shocker another maga steelers fan
the reason they cant have the game is so the other team wont have an outbreak as well turns out viruses spread pretty easily
thanks for typing words dr rectum
fuck the steelers and fuck that clown as potus
did you think this through before you posted so you want a team who is currently having a large outbreak and multiple new positives to come play your team you want to be in this same situation as us losing multiple starters for two weeks i mean i dont understand the logic no matter how you feel about the virus and idgaf what you think about it and dont want to hear it honestly if a player tests positive they dont play for two weeks thats just the stone cold fact so playing us would probably ruin your teams chance at a perfect season

rg3 aka ryan mallett v20
idk how stillers fans dont get that postponing the game isnt just to protect the ravens players but also the stillers players legit if we played last night there would for sure be stillers players testing positive next week

this is why theyre shtposting on reddit and thankfully not making important game decisions
idk why but almost all steelers fans are so whiny and aggressive when it comes to the ravens and were here like bro wtf
the ravens are scared of playing us we are so scary
the steelers have to be one of the most dramatic franchises of all time they can be a mediocre ass team while also having some of the most media attention and yet they complain about the nfl hating them
its crazy how self centered some steelers fans are acting putting football ahead of players health guaranteed that if the shoes on another foot and a massive outbreak happened to players like captain fat fuck juju claypool and others they would want to postpone the game
rg3 gone make a highlight tape on them boys
bro for some reason steelers fans are now saying that the ravens are favored by the nfl like how does that work
they cried when they lost their bye theyre crying now that they get the bye back they just cry about everything like the spoiled little fat kid who screams at his mom for not getting enough dunkaroos
i love rg3 but realistically hell probably get injured before the first half is over
i hope my boy rg3 wakes up hungry on tuesday
rg3 time really i mean he is a good player but our line is garbage our only good lineman is orlando brown ronnie stanleys season is over and marshall yanda retired our line is one good player and a bunch of inexperienced penalty prone players
we really have nothing to lose with the game this weekend backs to the wall given no chance to win by the public hoping we pull out a statement upset in pitt
i actually have a ravens rg3 jersey finally gonna be worth the money
didnt lamar jackson get covid
wheres ryan mallet when we need him
we had a prime time everyone tuned in game we are the really the only reason anyone would beis tuning in go ravens
rg3 time we actually dont have a worse chance without lamar yay
so im a penguins fan so naturally i follow pittsburgh sports fans on twitter and my god they have not shut up about how the ravens need to be punished more as if half our team being forced to not play is not punishment enough

the most egregious thing i ever witnessed was mike shanahan leaving an injured rg3 in a game when the redskins were up 14 and had kirk cousins on the bench cousins already won 2 games in relief earlier in the season not only did rg3 get severely injured the redskins lost the game i believe shanahan left him in because he was friends with dan synder
im ready for rgiii to throw for 240 yards and dez to have 120 yards receiving with 2 tds i am very much here for a 2012 throwback
end of the day bawlmer fucks

league officials at the nfl are meeting later today to discuss the ravens situation im told by a league source that a decision on the game at the steelers sunday may not be made today however test results from today dont come in until tonight

github whatsnew
this probably is going to result in some investigation similar to the titans organization to see if the team was culpable in the actions that led to its players testing positive fuck that coach saunders but the nfl will see if people knew anything more or if people were not following procedures beyond the one asshole

is this rravens or rsteelers
ironically were not actually scared of playing the steelers were scared of playing just about anyone with literally half our team out with covid plus injuries and no lamar steelers acting like theyre the 180 patriots

lets hope the chiefs dick them down in the playoffs fuck the steelers
harbaugh and tomlin have literally split games since 2008 5050 where is the narrative that harbaugh is afraid of the steelers coming from
how about we stop talking about the steelers in every post its pathetic we complain about their fan base but cant see the irony when we look at ourselves
steelers act like they werent spotted two scores and got away with a opi for another score

behind a paywall any way to copy the relevant parts
the current problem is theyve all got rona

good it shouldnt be
as much as rnfl wants a forfeit to happen ill be shocked if it actually occurs

the ravens are definitely getting fined and losing draft picks but i dont think any party involved wants a forfeit for several reasons
the league trying to keep the integrity of the 2020 season intact

an 18th week just makes more sense at this point

fuck the steelers
only rnfl is discussing this
honestly id agree we should forfeit if there wasnt already precedent for what happens in these situations from this season


i also find it rich titans fans trying to hop on this like us having one idiot fuck the team is worse than a bunch of their dumbass players practicing together after positive tests on their teams
i love how people apparently dont realize the nfl is a business and as such is trying to make money nbc paid money for this game and im certain they want it to be played one way or another and if it isnt the nfl will probably have to pay some kind of restitution to them it should surprise no one that the nfl will try everything they can to avoid a forfeit and they most definitely wont be having the ravens forfeit two games
the ravens have protocols and everything in place to prevent a covid situation theres not much they can do when one covid denier walks in sick without a mask he should be penalized not the ravens and im glad the nfl seems to agree
why would it even be in the discussion
well the nfl is all about money and a forfeit would lose everyone money so it wont happen i personally wouldnt care if we just took the forfeit and let our guys get healthy for the next week and tried to continue the playoff push rather than the alternative of getting blown out with half our starters from the practice squad i have a feeling that game on sunday is just gonna get pushed to week 18 because the nfl really does not wanna make games just not happen

the poor 100 steelers are clearly the victim here theyre such a mistreated team with such an awful schedule oh god their schedule is so fucking hard i think its only fair to give them the win its a good thing we delayed the game so that rg3 can start to make the game easier

s obviously
lmao what exactly does this prove

fan come in peace posts or seeing them in random comments is annoying imo were not a charity case lol imo if i wanted to see the thoughts from other fans i would go to rnfl
tbh i dont mind when other fans come in here and talk as long as theyre not being annoying even posting is fine but god damn youre right the coming in peace posts are fucking stupid
urodgerstojordy is the only one thats aight in my book
we have some of the worst mods on the site honestly they dont even pretend to filter out posts any meaningful discussion is outweighed by 10 my opinion on the state of the team or what do ravens fans think about and countless other bullshit posts that are clickbait polls or some average fan that thinks their opinion needs to be heard
i dont care if other fans come in here as long as they arent just trying to piss people off like a bunch of children however the coming in peace thing is so cringeworthy and is so redundant they act like coming into a different teams subreddit is the equivalent of going into the demilitarized zone in the southnorth korea border no one is going to attack you just because you like a different team unless those people are assholes and childish
bunch of fucking cucks with nothing better to do than overhype the worst flukiest 100 team in fucking history fuck them
i dont mind them here but many of them are just trolling and or are just here to be argumentative
while true im more irritated with the influx of trolls weve experienced over the past week
is it ok if i stay here i really hope you guys dont mind me here
i dont post here and i dont say dumb shit like coming in peace in fact i tried to remove this sub from my custom feed but theres no way to do that apparently it has been interesting peaking in on the feud between this sub and the steelers sub im glad the packers and vikings subs respect each other and mostly leave each other alone
id rather allow other fans to be here and deal with minor trolling than become one of those bullshit echo chamber subs with required flair rules
we win tuesday we punch the whiny insufferable entitled bullies right in the mouth in front of the whole league with our backups like we did with ryan mallet and with rgiii last year what if everyone recovers and comes back healthy to rally for a playoff push despite all the awful bullshit this year sometimes being a fan is about moments like this and our response says a lot about us

i weirdly crave these moments where theres no hope and the whole world is laughing at us and wants us to fail i think its a beautiful opportunity like buster douglas or helms deep for you real ones the entirety of rnfl rsteelers and a good portion of this sub think we are fucked and should just forfeit or worse just phone it in and chalk this up to a loss but jesus christ imagine if we did the unexpected this has been one of the worst weeks as a ravens fan in a very long time if we lose or forfeit as expected then its just what everyone thought an end to a terrible week and the mockery continues for a while but a win sunday or even a crazy fight would be one of the most epic moments in my fandom and would be on par with any of our best victories things are never as bad or as good as they seem in the moment i dont see the end of the season or franchise here i just see an opportunity to shock the world

most importantly i always try to remember this is literally a childrens game where freakishly large men in tights throw a ball around and give each other chronic brain injuries it sucks that football is our escape from the real world and the real world is fucking up our football team but nothing is more important than controlling the virus and keeping people alive and healthy no matter what happens this should be a wake up call for everyone if the game needs to be moved or cancelled i agree 100 but what if
im right there with you if we can survive the next two games i like our chances buuuut its going to be tough considering we will likely be losing even more players well essentially be playing all back ups
i dont expect us to win but if we do i will never let steelers fans hear the end of it
i mean im okay win or loss i have no expectations as long as we dont blow another lead if we go up 10points at half time we better fucking close out the game this time blowing another lead would somehow make the week even worst
if we win the steelers are never gonna shut up about not having a bye
we will pull the biggest upset of the year and that will be enough for us to rally back and take the division
i mean 99 chance we lose on sunday but god damn ive never preyed harder for a rg3 bounce back in my life imagine if this dude randomly turns into rookieg3 out of nowhere right now
tuesday
ill keep watching every minute of every ravens game sure but i just have less energy for football this season fuck the steelers i hope they get exposed in the playoffs
never surrender play better expect more what happened to the mottos instituted into the locker room last year
theyll say it was because of all of the uncertainty and schedule change


view poll


view poll
the steelers are still very good

just not that good
steelers getting beat the first round in the playoffs
it was the pats last year and its not close but short term memory and current events will lead the steelers to win this poll

people were saying the pats had one of the best defenses ever last year lol
the steelers are super overrated but people were calling the patriots a generational defense like the 2000 ravens i have not heard people say such positives things about the steelers but i also dont listen to yinzer radio nor do i have a desire to marry my cousin or drink straight heinz ketchup
shittsburgs walk szn

plays the whole nfc east

bengals browns twice

saved by refs vs titans ravens and cowboys

played 2 teams above 500

mickey mouse schedule

barely beat denver
its close but these steelers are just too overrated
2019 ravens
holy fuck can us steelers just have our goddamn year
why isnt the 2019 ravens an option


week 18 coming right up
yesterday they said there were 4 new positive players we know about ward and lamar did they ever say who the other 2 were
per source ravens had one additional player positive today from a pointofcare test pcr test results will be returned tonight

tweet i aint even mad i just want all them boys to recover and be healthy
big vince i appreciate u
finally someone with sense
steelers fan here and this has been my mindset the entire time

as much as i hate the ravens i care more about humans and know that this virus sucks bad the two games i look forward to the most every single season are the two times the steelers and ravens play im not one of the whiny fans out there asking for a forfeit or the easy way out this rivalry is hands down the absolute best in the nfl when both teams are as close to healthy as possible and all of our best players are out there scrapping for that hard fought w this aint a soft rivalry

i hope that your players come out as healthy as possible at the end of this and dont have any of the nasty lingering effects that it can cause and with the absolute utmost respect fuck the ravens i know you guys feel the same
as a steelers fan i was sad that i didnt get to watch them play the ravens for thanksgiving but the correctsmart thing is being done even better that the game has been pushed to tuesday night hopefully itll be televised as a prime time game hope everyone recovers well and that we have a classic cutthroat game on the 7th
i dont really like any steelers players but one i dont mind is vince hes got that old school lb mentality a physical run stopper and blitzer i like watching him play
as a steelers fan ive never understood being upset over the games being delayed these are real people and covid needs to be taken seriously football is just a game
i respect that i can imagine the other players were frustration tweeting and have similar sentiments
mods can this be a honeypot thread to get rid of all these damn lurking steelers fans
he should teach their scumbag fanbase a lesson on class
respect
i dont think steelers players and fans are mad at the league for moving the game theyre mad at the ravens for allowing this to happen which they should be i dont why ravens fans are crying about the steelers fans crying
steelers fan intruding

i love big vince dude was a great special teamer that became a starter for years thats admirable

and he is approaching this reasonably if this game gets moved to week 18 or cancelled completely and that somehow costs us a bye week in the playoffs who cares

these are peoples lives the pandemic is a big deal i hope as few people as possible get affected and those that do recover this was always gonna be a weird season i just want people to stay safe

i love irrationally hating yall its fun rivalry in sports is such a great way to channel hatred on something that ultimately doesnt matter but this isnt something that doesnt matter we need to put hate aside a minute

also hines kicks ed reeds ass troy was better than ed ray is a murderer flacco is pathetic and when you come at me with some ben shit thats alleged and probably true and terrible but weve got video of ray rice fuck yall but for real stay healthy

yes
with a few weeks to gel dez snead stills duvernay and hollywood could turn into a solid wr group

but wed have to actually start using duvernay and dez lol
for sure worth a shot if he falls to us though i cant imagine he will clear waivers or even fall to us
why would he want to come here
the houston texans are releasing wr kenny stills in a mutual parting sources tell espn a veteran wr in stills now available to sign and help a playoff team for the stretch run

ill say it a thousand times we could have prime randy moss on this team and he would help us receivers are extremely limited if a team doesnt throw them the ball

we have talent we just dont use it

if hes not in the building by monday ill be pissed
hopefully he falls far enough down in waivers but i can imagine ne nyg or chi taking him at least we get to decide before green bay itd be stupid to not sign him if he falls to us imo
yes please
please sign me up dawg
if he falls to us through waivers im all for it why not we have very little in that position nothing to lose
no chance he gets past all 4 nfc east teams on waivers
lets goo
its waivers right so a team with a worst record has the rights to sign him before we do
yes
one can dream
yes please
doesnt he have a problem with drops idk i havent watched the texans much this season
i wish we got robbie anderson but he would be a good alternative
hes literally better than every wr we have right now
please stop with this we could have prime randy moss on this team and he wouldnt help us if we dont throw the ball desean is balling the fuck out right now getting numerous different players involved and kenny still wasnt producing

we have talent we just dont use it more players doesnt change that it just makes it worse
removed

if the steelers lose that entire city is going to erupt in anger
im surprised its not a week 18 game but the nfl is doing everything they can to avoid making a week 18 rn

id imagine dallas is on sunday now or will be moved there shortly

edit nvm next monday at 5pm
this also means that our game against dallas is also going to be pushed back probably
wait will anyone who was on the list be able to make it back on time for the game
lmaoo what about the dallas game
weather calling for snow
steelers fans finna be big mad rn lol
just hope the dallas game gets pushed to monday and not sunday that way we get lamar back
its tuesday night in amerrrrica
hmm so dallas will likely be sunday by then we could have some players back
moving to tuesday means we can get b williams back im sure he was on the list for close contact right the 5 days will be up providing he doesnt get the virus
x200b

lol so covid will be all gone on tuesday

x200b

rg iii still starting
bum bum bum bum
everyone talking about the steelers fans crying as if they dont have legit reason to be pissed theyre getting totally fucked im not mad about it i just think its funny to see people act like they arent
steelers will win but will catch covidherpes from playing your team that will put all the starters out for 2 games and then ben will die because hell have a reaction to the vaccine that will be out by then

browns win super bowl
removed
its not about competitive balance or being able to play more regular starters its not a refusal to go next man up its about containing the spread of the virus and protecting the health and safety of all players we have guys testing positive every day now that were negative the day before playing sunday would likely mean somebody who tests positive sunday am and you dont learn until monday would be on the field

frankly most of your fans dont understand the issue because you keep framing it like its about allowing us to field more players which it is not
i think it has to do more with there still being positives coming in so the outbreak is not under control playing sunday would potentially jeopardize players on both sides until we know for sure there arent any more positive tests coming if we have a couple days of no new positives we know likely the players wont have been infected by this outbreak and it is safe to play thats why moving it to tuesday to give a couple of extra days makes the most sense
i think the majority of our sub doesnt want the game played because we dont want to infect the steelers or our healthy players weve been getting cases daily and based on the current trend theres no indication that more positives will not show up on sunday

for the most part i dont think theres major homerism going on here a good amount of ravens fans are fine with the game being forfeited even if it doesnt benefit us we recognize that the health of the players both steelers and ravens is most important here an equal amount want the game postponed more or less for the same reason not because were afraid of losing or want better playoff odds

if the team isnt getting more positive cases were totally fine rolling with rg3 and the rest of what we got because whether its sunday or tuesday thats likely what well have regardless if not forfeiting or moving to week 18 are all options it seems most of us are willing to accept
this post should be  by our mods

the game has been moved to tuesday the packersniners game is a false equivalence to what is happening with the ravens the game has been postponed 2x to control an outbreak and nothing else

how many times do we have to point these things out its tiring
honestly i wish there was more conversation around this like what youre doing rather than im just here to shit on the ravens for internet points its not like we are happy that this is happening the way that our season is going i dont think anyone cares when this game gets played bc we are a mess no matter what and who we have available to us my take which seems to be unpopular for some reason is that the longer the game gets put off the better covid is active and spreading across this team right now why risk spreading it to a 100 team

my take is that it makes way more sense to just move the game to week 18 and forget about it i understand the double standard and why pittsburgh would be upset but all things considered thats just the way that it is it sucks but these are the circumstances we are dealing with this season im not trying to be a dick i honestly think this is just common sense

as far as other teams like the titans and 49ers are concerned i have no idea what to tell you but its not like the ravens have any control over this be mad at the nfl not the ravens god forbid the steelers have an outbreak and have to answer to the same questionscriticisms this can happen to any team this is the world we live in right now
as others have said thank you for starting a decent conversation and as others have also said its not about having our starters on the field or not we have a huge problem because we keep seeing new positives every day

that is why nfl initially gave both teams 3 more days to ensure no more positives would trickle in and now theyre giving the game another 2 days since we had more positives yesterday with each new positive come more close contacts and so on so its a matter of not spreading the virus onto other teams

we couldve gone ahead with the game on sunday but imagine if come monday 2 3 4 etc more players test positive this would now mean close contacts exist on the steelers too which would create a snowball effect and a chain of spreading throughout the nfl thats what the nfl wants to avoid

as a ravens fan i trust our depth chart and will believe in whoever we are able to field but beyond that ive stopped caring about the game and the season all i want is for our team to have no new positives and to see our players get healthy without any major issues
fuck off moron do you want your team to risk getting covid because players are actively testing positive
why do these fucking morons keep coming to our sub jfc
attention fans coming in peace and all lurking other fans of other teams

we are not worried about who plays and who does not play we are worried about infecting your fucking team

please let us worry about our players health and the health of all of those in the ravens facility and all of their loved ones in peace we know the ravens fucked up

now that you know how we really feel please just go away and if you happen to cross paths with someone who thinks we deny that the ravens fucked up please tell them that you have been here and that we know
the game has been moved to tuesday to eliminate any possibility of fielding any positive players to infect both teams not to screw the steelers people that test negative one day could test positive the next day at this point were playing with fire if we continue the season in my opinion
we already know who rg3 and gus are so playing them wouldnt help us learn anything new if thats what you mean

my opinion is that whatever punishment the league doles out is appropriate because the team fucked up id prefer an investigation to determine how many people turned a blind eye to saunders before the team is punished but i understand that this may not be feasible and that its pretty likely that other leaders were negligent in not addressing saunders noncompliance so i dont think we can be upset when were punished as a team

however i dont think the 49ers should have had to play back then the game should have been postponed two wrongs dont make a right so basing any decisions on this past game doesnt feel right because itd be doubling down on the wrong choice so i dont think forcing the game to happen is the right choice

if it werent for steelers players losing their checks id say a forfeit would be fair but since this would hurt the steelers players i think postponement makes the most sense

also ignore the fragile members of our sub who will downvote you and tell you to go away id rather peoples opinion of the sub not be colored by the worst of us its embarrassing
steelers fans really want covid for some reason ffs


cowboys game could probably be on sunday
incoming more steeler tears
im guessing the cowboys game gets pushed to sundaymonday the question is when was lamars test taken and when does that 10day window come into play was it when it was taken or when the results were made public
ravens and steelers pushed back two more days until tuesday obviously ravenscowboys initially set for next thursday will have to be moved as well

i know steelers fans arent going to like this but it makes the most sense for the nfl to make a week 18 and push the playoffs back a week i think its not a matter of if but when at this point it gives the league so much more flexibility
x200b

what time is this game
is there still 2 weeks from afccgnfccg to the super bowl this year

just move everything up and do afccgnfccg and then boom superbowl
steelers fan from the uk here ravens are a close second favourite

moving the games makes sense my only gripe is that they moved it from 1am friday too late for me to 6pm sunday perfect im off sunday to 1am on wednesday which is too late again

yes the steelers get a shorter week but theyre 100 so the result wont exactly win or lose the season for them if one days less prep means they loose vs washington then theyre very lucky to be 100 these are very unprecedented times im just happy to have football to watch to be honest
monday at 5pm
this gives our players a better chance of playing against the cowboys and the steelers get a condensed week double w
removed
he has to fall to us in waivers first i doubt he gets to us but fingers crossed
he has better hands than what he have on the roster hope he falls down the waiver and we scoop him up
shit goodell is gonna find a way to milk the hell outta this
think of all the lost thanksgiving ads
i like tuesday night football when theres a game on thursday tbh

only gotta get through wednesday without football
that number excludes the titansbills game last month caused by the former failing to communicate with the players regarding practices that sound very sus and im a titans fan
i think per contract tuesday is supposed to be a day off but i wouldnt mind seeing a sunday game moved to tuesday

no he will not play he has to have 10 days between tests he will miss two games
following a positive test if the player isasymptomatic he can return once

10 days have passed since the initial positive testor

five days have passed since the initial positive test and the player receives two consecutive negative pcr virus tests at least 24 hours apart within that fiveday period

yes he could play

lamar and the rest could be back for this i think
monday bb
well the positive is everyone on the list rn obviously if taken off the list can play for the dallas game next monday
oh shit that mean the cowboys game is 2pm here on the west coast i might have to call out of work for the last half of the day
5pm thats a bit early
im assuming players cant practice while theyre on the list this would mean lamar would only have like maybe one day of practice before the cowboys game

do we really want a lamar with no practice to start immediately
gifts are nice
ravens should really have to forfeit this game getting a little ridiculous

i fucking hate that coach what a fucking scumbag
i kinda wonder who the unnamed player was in the initial tests if it wasnt lamar
ravens qb lamar jacksons positive test came in thursdays round of covid19 testing he still wont play tuesday night against the steelers but based on the timeline its possible he could be cleared in time for the rescheduled dec 7 game against the cowboys

make it stop
to nobodys surprise none of our wrs came into close contact with strength and conditioning coach which is pretty clear considering none of them can fight for the ball
i think ive had enough

where is the ceo of covid19 i have a knuckle sandwich for him
you gotta be kidding me

if cox got it then is sam koch at risk of having it too

does that put tucker at risk of getting it too

omg im literally fucking panicking fuck steve saunders or whatever the fuck it is holy fuck
is this only happening to starter quality players or are those just the only players they tell us about

we have a pro bowl covid roster
stop the count
lol literally everyone that has snapped the ball for this team is out
really glad we kept tyler huntley on the practice squad since he is our new qb2 if you watch last years week 17 we were starting rg3 and our top 2 rbs were gus and justice so we have done this before we also didnt have calais or justin madabuike nevertheless missing these guys is gonna hurt pretty bad
lets just throw the injury list in there as well
even morgan cox well im glad we got that ls on the practice squad
and this doesnt even count the injuries we may still have
so all these guys are out and most of them could be back for the cowboys game now correct


our season is still in our hands
our receivers are so bad they cant even catch covid
whos our backup qb on tuesday

wow thanks for breaking the news

lololol theyre scared to play us

in all seriousness hope everyone gets well
oh how the turntables have turned
they should forfeit
if the move the game its because theyre the darlings of the nfl special treatment
man i just want to laugh like crazy you cant make this shit up

but i wont because this fucking virus is ruining everything we love in the world people losing their jobs and livelihood their relatives their health is in jeopardy this entire situation sucks major balls i just wish it would be over so we could get back to the regular fuck the steelers ratbirds posts
tuitt is a big loss hes really good but i think the other 2 r backups

hope everyone stays safe i dont wish this on anyone

get this mans face off my screen forever please

ban this franchise from the league
oh how the yinztables have yinzd
that cant possibly be true because just earlier today i read a post in which one of their fans explained that they are careful so they havent had more than one positive all season
i like how this has been news for over an hour now and their sub has like one excusemaking post about it and thats it very few comments typical
i definitely did copy and post in the steelers forum what will they say now that their players have it now cant say they got it from us

this seems to be for possible close contact with someone who had it and they reported it as they should if you wanna compare these situations then its a little weird considering the coachs discretions
if we played yesterday our guys would have gotten it so it works out so we can be as healthy as possible funny how shit works out lol
thats called karma
hey at least they most likely wont be able to practice just like we wont be practicing before the game tuesdayif that game even still happens now at least that will be fair since we were going into the game without practicing since our facility will be closed
cant stand steelers fans all bitcing saying they were losing out on this and that when they had every advantage with us having covid players and no practice b4 tuesday game and they dont dare want to wait to play us if we had all healthy regular players but now it looks like there team getting karma for their players talking crap online has to be rightif they want to say we werent following protocol for our players to get it then how could their players get it if they were double standard as mofos act like everyone that takes precautions against covid in every way wont get ityeahok our players took all precautions and that one coach didnt and his maskless face spread it around the facility what will steelers say now that they got it cant blame us
what a joke
ahh oh how the turn tables
we do not care about covid protocols or things of that nature tomlin probably
lmao instant karma but srsly just hoping everyone gets through ok
something something turn tables
but the ravens have more
this is the ravens sub

think about it the steelers dont know anything about the people who theyre about to face but we know everyone im really hoping for a shocker
i hope we win too but lets not get crazy with the expectations this is going to be a tough fuckin game to win
ill be watching this game expecting to lose 400 so if its anything better than that ill be happy shit if we can lose even 2417 or something at least we can make fun of them for almost losing to our backups
ill be happy if its within at least 10 points were literally playing guys straight off the street atp lol
lmao were getting our shit rocked were losing more and more players dont be delusional
anyone else getting the replacements vibes
i am going to have to leave work early
i live in ca games gonna be at 2
you mean tuesday
out here in the ol mountain standard time i have to leave work at 230 to be home for 300 i actually bumped a meeting from in person to zoom for this
still be working when they kick off thats weird
a late prime time game for europe

i just hope lamar and rest of our guys are all doing okay and with get back to full health
will b will potentially be back for the cowboys definitely not by tuesday right

as a yinzer can yall shut the fuck up and stop coming to this sub jfc yall annoying af
franchises who draft top 10 qbs should be treated as 10year olds who want a puppy they must first prove that they are capable of taking care of them

or maybe that dumbass coach is just an idiot
a coach being a fucking idiot and a pandemic has nothing to do with curses

so irresponsible steelers should forfeit the game and lose their 1st round draft pick
its hawkins tuitt and buggs they are reporting close contact so who in pittsburg brought it in
idc we gave this man shit for his rough stretch earlier in the season hes been playing great since the colts game and people are still shitting on him hes lost two friends this season and where can he go to take his minds off things the internet where people are joking about his covid situation

lamar the mvp bruh idc if covid fucks up his career like cams imma be mad asf hes been much more accurate hes kept us in games people really out here thinking he cant throw the ball like he didnt drop 36 on the league last year

we gonna come back from this maybe take an l to these crybaby squeelers thats cool reg season dont matter we gonna get the whole squad back and b ready for the playoffs ong i cant see a team beating the ravens full strength

steelers only lost by 4 chiefs idgaf they defense overrated we can win a shoot out omm i hope the ravens play the titans first drop a 50 burger on them with a fully healthy defense banner 3 otw yall
lamar can turn to several places instead of the internet and covid didnt fuck up cams career multiple injuries including a foot and shoulder that caused him to miss extended time theres absolutely zero reason lamar would have a lasting effect in his play
i wouldnt call him the goat

he hasnt proven hes the goat yet hes proven hes a good qb when he plays well but he hasnt produced any results ifwhen he produces postseason results ill be happy to see where he stands against other top tier qbs but as of now hes a good qb
you are delusional or very optimistic i hope we win too
bwahahahahahaha
removed
he has to pass waivers first
hell yeah

undefeated in a ravens jersey against the steelers say it aint so
imagine we actually win steelers fans would be crying so bad fuck whatever happened last week against tennessee we still historically own those clowns this win would be the win of the season imagine a crippled team beating a 100 team at full strength steelers fans would have 0 excuses theyre due to take an l and what better team to do it expect their arch rivals
that hoody is fire
rg3 with clean handoffs coming to gus
can you imagine if he outplays lamar the next two games so significantly this fan base calls for him to start over lamar down the stretch
hes been here for years
this is karma for all the shit i talked to my wft friends while going to school in dc but i still believe
i know its asking alot but maybe roman will mix up the play book with a different qb not gonna hold my breath on that tho
bobby triple sticks is about to pull through
creds theravenshub on ig
steelers fans we arent overrated we are the best team in the nfl

has to play the ravens wo any dline starters no mvp qb missing 3 linemen one starting rb

steelers fans the rat birds have to forfeit
are there any ravens fans who actually care when we get called the rat birds
as much as i love trash talking and boasting were getting handed the golden platter in terms of we fucked up but still getting treated nicely

as much as i wouldnt want to see it the nfl had the right to force the ravens to forfeit

both from a management and player standpoint the organization dropped the ball this isnt a simple we forgot to pull our mask up it was a person knowingly going against the rules and having no accountability from the organization for his actions we can say fuck the strength coach all we want but we should also be scrutinizing the management that allowed that behavior and actions to exist
nah man as a yinzer i dont want to win off of covid i want your team to at 100 and our team to be 100

i want the best team to win not the least infected one

removed
i think they should be forced to give away some of their wr

they confused the term outbreak and breakout understandable
ragedlikemilk
checks date of article someones having a piss
dez bryant ready for breakout season
to be fair it doesnt say he was going to have one just that hes ready for one im ready to win the lottery
still waiting
were shitting on dude but as soon as he leaves the team hell be playing better than any other receiver we have
idk dont count him out yet
what an idiot
removed
where do we stand on the waiver order will he even get to us
kenny stills is an instant upgrade to every wr on this rosterthis is a no brainer signing so it wont happen this team will stick with that awful bum boykin instead and 60 says he doesnt catch another pass this szn
personally i dont think stills would change much to the ravens offense if anything hes a slightly better willie snead
is kenny stills gonna make lamar jackson throw a good ball probably not

so do we have any other tackles
he played the entire game for us vs ten and did well so that sucks

but if we can just not lose anyone else we maybe have a shot but who fucking knows at this point
so whats that 5 healthy lineman so one injury tuesday and what happens
thats starting right tackle will holden to you pelissero
most of us already knew last year how the bandwagon operates but holy shit every social media platform has turned on lamar from some elses shitty decisons in the organization
well its good theyre getting off the bandwagon now because we dont want them back and never wanted them in the first place
i dont ever think anybody on the sports media world was truly on our bandwagon they keep moving the goal post for lamar week to week theyre gonna let lamar chill for about a week and not criticize him because of covid but the moment he steps on the field again its lights camera action unrealistic expectations blaming him for every loss even tho its clear they dont even watch the games etc etc they will finally leave him alone when he wins a sb but until then were basically the cowboys now
i miss people hating us because we were good and not because our players had the audacity to get infected by a virus that has killed millions
the trolling this year is off the charts i think it has more to do with people being assholes than actually being football fans
fuck that shit root for your team anything else is just a distraction
everyone hated ray at one point in time too
fuck the bandwagon fans straight up

like sure if the team catches your attention and you wanna hop on thats fine but you better be ride or die from that point on as far as im concerned

the hate is fine in my book fuck it i just hope our boys come through this thing in tact
maybe our merch will go on sale at stores that over bought when we were hot and now real fans can get some christmas bargains
he hasnt been as good this year as last year obviously but there have been so many other problems including stanleys injury that you cant blame the seasons issues on him
let them turn away bunch of fair weather douches who know nothing about football
have you seen the guy who is a steelers and chiefs fan and makes fun of other people for liking bad teams ex the cardinals who are literally good this year
removed
damn lamar needs to stop his 5g radio transmitter before he infects the entire team
god maybe they should forfeit tuesday
its getting ridiculous now s
john sherman smithschuster complains about a game being moved the steelers get covid cases like 2 days later im pretty sure hed take that tweet back
my teams reaction wasnt great lets just hope everyone recovers 100

i love hating yall but this isnt the time for it this isnt just a game right now hopefully we see you tuesday or week 18
if i can be frank the whole covid news with the ravens have been playing second fiddle to me all week because one of my dads best friends is in the hospital for covid and im scared for this man hes been there for my dad and our family through the hell weve been thought for years between my dads oldest brother that helped bring his family over from war torn el salvador dying in 2009 to my grandmother dying of heart failure 2 months back this man was there for us with love and support and he might be gone soon god forbid when i read ju jus tweets about being mad over a game it immediately filled me with rage that someone who is above and beyond protected better than the rest of us had the balls to say something stupid like that idk all that silly love i had for ju ju is just soured now
seriously just forfeit the game and get healthy
hahhhaahah this has the be a shit post right

we genuinely wholeheartedly cant deem the two comparable

additionally with how the tables have turned theres no way the ravens should be expected to forfeit with both teams experiencing covid related setbacks at the moment i cant see the tuesday game happening at this moment either most of all id like to take the time to say that even though we all love football and want to see our favorite teams out there each week their health in these trying times takes precedence with players league wide testing positive now is a time not to focus on wins and losses or playoff spots but rather the health of these humans who have put themselves at risk to participate in this season praying for the players health and hoping for the best
agreed man fuck covid
at this point in time we dont actually know if any steelers players tested positive we know they were added to the reservecovid list and will likely miss tuesday but its not yet clear if they were added because they tested positive or added as close contacts

its hard to keep up with the high volume and frequency of news related to this story but i think this is an important distinction to make
with cases of covid surging to new all time high levels across the country other teams might soon be having similar problems if this affects a few more teams rescheduling will take a supercomputer to figure out
testing positive

i was under the impression they isolated 3 close contacts not positive tests
the steelers and test positive they were in close proximity to someone who did
steelers getting positive results pittsburgh should have to forefit we can play this game too steeler fans

this is the man that needs to have a talk with juju and claypool
removed
brown snead boykin proche duverney or dez who do you cut
our receivers are non existent im not sure the exact reason why but kenny stills would probably be better than some of our guys
you could go back in time and get a prime
jerry rice and lamar would still miss him by 25 yards downfield
lets make winning on 121 a tradition
last year it was the 49ers that was a great game
time for an upset
make it 8 in a row for baltimore

sigh i miss 2019

hell yahh
is there any way to find out other than players
edit i am referring to the ravens coaches and staff specifically
yes but names have not been released but zrebiec has reported its been a mix of staff and players every day id imagine if it were harbaugh or any coordinator wed hear that
it is strange
you would think like the food service people and the custodial staff and others would be getting dragged into this too
browns and the vikings
it sounds like just a conditioning underling of saunders but no name released

i was at that ul game teddy had just left so i figured we didnt have an elite qb for the next season

most his plays were runs but dude ran like a wild man

lol of course they are runs
where does a team even find another long snapper can we just yoink one from the streets
we got a guy weve been protecting on the practice squad i think his name is nick moore
the only team with a practice squad long snapper lol

so im a big cyclist and with covid and the emergence of zwift basically a game where you use your own bike and pedal to move your avatar on screen hill resistance is fed back to the trainer your bike is hooked up to so hills feel real and are much harder the uci world champs are now all virtual and will be run on this game so

lets move all remaining games to madden and we know who the reigning madden nfl pro champ is right

my final point of the day fuck the steelers
ride on if you ever want to ride mattychays
i helped zwift hire their game architect ride on and go ravens

lol so true it hurts
no man keep him awake

everything started breaking once he went into a coma we need him on gameday
pain
lost 3 of 4 since the bye and have had a fucking outbreak happen on our team smdh
take me back to the texans and rams games
plot twist the nurse is a steeler fan and smuggly turns on the tv to nfl news and leaves the room
not like we were playing all that great before the signs were there

id also like to see lamar wo gro

sounds great
as a louisville fan this just angered me beyond belief lmfao they came for lamar and devante
id like to see lamar w out greg roman yeah us too man us too
i unsubbed and removed it from my channel completely done with it its a shitty echo chamber full of stupid ignorant people felt much better since and i will go somewhere else for my nfl news
and thats one of the more reserved takes on lamar that ive seen
lamar without roman sounds like heaven where do i sign up for that
someone save me please
i just expect it now so it doesnt disappoint me hell bounce back in no time and all these haters will crawl back to their caves
i too would like to see lamar without greg roman lol
ironically this was one of the more held back takes on him they typically go in on this man

makes my fucking blood boil
fire roman please
1 stay out of rnfl its bad for your mental health

2 lamar is one of the most disrespected and criticized qbs in the entire nfl the idea that anyone is overrating him right now is hilarious

plague like a raven
if we lose we should have just forfeited because we wasted their time but if we win its because the league was giving us special privileges man everyone just wants to hate on us dont then
if you win then honestly the steelers are jut fucking trash
its just backlash from last year and a return to normalcy as a ravens fan while it was fun being the toast of the league last year our super bowls were won down in the mud when nobody outside the fan base and castle believed
dont know what the steelers are complaining about they literally got as much time off as us its not like they played on sunday and have to play again tomorrow both teams have had 10 days off
anyone saying ravens got a favor is clueless nfl is protecting the steelers from us giving them covid and they are to stupid to see it 16 players from the 53 man roster cant play tomorrow our starting qb cant play steelers got their precious bye week basically and to top off the fact they get our practice squad ravens couldnt even practice before the game for you know the 16 new players forced into starting roles if were even remotely competitive tomorrow will be shocking steelers must have desperately wanted to have covid to be so pissed about not playing us already
everyone is going to talk shit on everyone on the flipside if the steelers win theyre winning against 20 of our players being out including our starting qb if they lose theyre losing to a team of practice squaders its more of a loselose situation for them than it is for us
i mean threatening to go on strike to get an extra day of practice is special treatment if i were goodell i would have said you either play tuesday or forfeit

please lets keep this
i like it
not going to lie this is my phones wallpaper now
purple update as requested
i was expecting this to be ironic and bad why is this good

can we actually use this pls
this is so good did you do it
problem with this its a plague doctor not a plague bringer lol
man this is great you could probably do an oriole as well
simply amazing thank you for the new wallpaper
i like this
damn this looks nice

i decided to look at the cba to get some answers even though the nfl has lawyers for that they actually pay and they dont pay me oh well if you have any comments on my legal analysis feel free to share lawyers often need multiple heads to look at this stuff

this is not a defend the ravens at all costs post baltimoremarylandamerica needs to take covid seriously and the ravens need to face punishment this is just a can someone tell me what is going on post because thats how ive felt these past couple days also i looked at the actual agreements and rules not articles because i actually believe that the nfl is coordinating an effort to make this look more confusing than it is by crossing wires with conflicting reports thats a conspiracy though and not part of this lol

first talking point the ravens threatened to go on strike rather than play on tuesday the ravens might have vaguely threatened to sit out my guess is the ravens called goodell and said we cant play but they would not have been successful and they wouldve both known this as is standard and legal with just about every cba the players have signed away their right to strike by entering into the cba sitting out is a work stoppage and it is a strike article iii section 1 its just icing on the cake that this would have been over working conditions would have been a strike even without that i will not speculate on the facts of what happened behind closed doors but the bottom line is this threatened strike if there was one was meaningless and the nfl and the players know that there was likely no strike what was more likely is the players saying they couldnt play and the league begrudgingly agreeing but thats me editorializing

but then that begs the question cant the ravens just forfeit

second talking point the ravens should forfeit this is one that i actually parroted before you come for me i just want the spread under control i actually still think thats the solution but it hit me that the ravens might not have the ability to unilaterally forfeit fair warning this one is very gray purposefully so if you ask me

first its worth mentioning that the cba makes literally no mention of what happens if a team forfeits this makes sense it doesnt ever come up literally not once has this happened so whats the point of arguing over it

second the only rule in the entire nfl rulebook about a forfeit is that the final score would be 20

third the special covid portion of the cba again makes no mention of forfeit and it makes no mention of what happens if a game is cancelled or postponed i know that sounds unbelievable but you can look for yourself

so heres where we are the only thing that makes mention of these things is a memo from goddell to the league after the titans outbreak how soon we forget it is clear from the memo that the league could make the ravens forfeit and that this would also be a forfeiture of their game checks however that was not agreed upon in the cba but ill leave that one alone for the players lawyers also if the ravens wanted to forfeit they dont have an avenue to follow of what that would look like as there has never been a forfeit which again its okay if it happens for the first time in 2020

long story short unilaterally forfeiting is not black and white like i thought it was on one hand it sounds wrong to say a team of any sport cant forfeit on the other the nfl has an agreement in which the players gave up certain things like striking and got things in return the nfl can definitely make the ravens forfeit not saying they should saying can however i cannot confidently say that the ravens have the ability to unilaterally forfeit if the nfl views a forfeit as a strike then the players signed away their ability to forfeit

well see how this all plays out i could be wrong because i have to imagine the owners knew what would happen if a game had to be cancelled even if they didnt have it in the agreement before the season started and there is a secret agreement or an understanding that this would be the plan all along postpone at all costs there are also obvious money driving forces at play here too im just saying for all of our edification there is a chance that the ravens could not elect to forfeit
shouting forfeit on reddit twitter fb etc was never about player health player safety contracts rights it was about the easy w against a tough divisional rival during a relatively easy season schedule

no regular fans have the knowledge of even remotely considering the consequences of a professional sports team forfeiting a game everybodys acting like theyre a huge loud drunk crowd in a shitty pub things just dont work that way people need to stop being onlinesmart because theyre obviously not and its not just about sports but practically everything

were in the middle of a fucking pandemic lucky to have a season at all although some of us think it shouldnt even be started at the first place
tldr
no playerteam wants a forfeit even with so many out player who are available want to play as for many like rgiii its not just about winning now its also about getting something on tape that can help them get an offer next year with careers so short for many a forfeit or even a voluntary miss of a game can be detrimental to their attempts at a career its a difficult spot for many players and one that the nfl exploits

plague like a raven
problem with this its a plague doctor not a plague bringer lol
fyi i did not create this
why the hell is the game being played tomorrow

if you have to reschedule something 3 times in less than a week because of a highly contagious virus maybe its not safe for the players and support staff of both teams to participate never mind others they come in contact with

forget all the bs about whether or not rescheduling the game benefits someone or whom should forfeit etc this lunacy is out of control

nfl never had a plan and still doesnt
its all about the money
this guy aint bad not every steelers fan is a bumbling idiot just like we arent all saints we dont pay to injure players wait wrong kind of saint
the nfl has the moe plan money over everything
the league would prefer if teams blame each other for how the virus is handled because it takes the attention away from them
i said before they even moved thursday that we should just fckn forfeit and go into quarantine and get right we shouldnt win the steelers game regardless were missing too many guys 65 with our schedule can still make the playoffs who cares oh yeamoney

but the nfls failure to properly buffer the games either through a bubble like the nba or padding the schedule with bye weeks to account for adjustments is the real problem there was no preseason theres no reason we couldnt have done this
its all about the money

imho it should be forfeited in fact if i was in charge of the nfl at the start of the season id have said

if a team cant play a game because someone of their side broke protocol which caused an outbreak they forfeit rescheduled are only good in case of an outbreak and no one is at fault
the nfl and common sense are like oil and water should have been moved to week 18 the league was worried it would be a meaningless game but that happens every year anyway

fuck the steelers
fuck the steelers and fuck the nfl
this game shouldnt be happening but since it is fuck the steelers see you boys in the post game thread
with the state of both teams i propose we have tucker and boswell attempt 10 50 yard field goals and whoever makes the most wins the game all those in favor
go to work
get paid
are we sure its game day
im still bracing for another delay but lets go
whos watching the game from work lfg
man im really about to leave work early to watch our backups play i think i might be addicted
stream from work flock
oh hell yeah todays thanksgiving

how can i listen to the radio broadcast of this game on my phone im at work in iowa

edit nevermind i have to go home to quarantine because my mom and dad just tested positive
fuck the ravens and just please dont get covid im begging you
removed

i doubt the coaches browse this sub and probably wouldnt even answer that question

educated guess would be not unless rg3 gets hurt our offense is built for running qbs like rg3
lets hope not if hes in the game that means things are going terribly really wish fans would stop hyping up players that arent good
only if were updown by a good amount in the fourth quarter or something happens to rg3
if rg3 gets hurt
i was reading jeff zrebiec saying he doubts it because trace hasnt gotten any type of conditioning or practice in this weekand even said huntley may be the backup idk
gameday what are we thinking about tonights naye this afternoons game i am very curious to see what greg roman can come up with playing with a depleted offense our defense looks okay except for the fact we will definitely miss some dtaction with williams and madubuike both out

i am very curious about tonights game it will be a win or loss thatll define the season
rg3 remains undefeated against the steelers as a raven
i dont even know man im mentally checked out i love this team but this season has been a nightmare
the possibility does exist to be the upset of the season
the possibility also exists to be the largest deficit in ravens steelers history

i am more worried about our ability to keep putting points on the board than i am keeping their offence off the field
i just dont think we will be able to keep up today
i highly doubt todays game affects how the rest of our season goes i think the real game is how we play on tuesday vs the cowboys if we dont show up to that game then were wasting our time
curious is the wrong word im dreading to see what shit he puts together
expecting a loss and moving on
personally all i am hoping for is no more injuries i legit dont care if we lose this particular game i actually expect it but man does that put a sour taste in my mouth i am interested in seeing if dez can continue his way up the depth chart though
i am expecting us to get walloped we are missing so many players it just seems like the chances of winning are almost 0 i will of course be watching and rooting for our practice squad though because fuck the steelers
we play balls out and win maybe catch the steelers napping and build up a big first half deficit


more like against themselves
lol ravens brought this on themselves

rg3 to dez all day long
if we win this game somehow ill tattoo rg3s face on my assand ill do it happily
i love the optimism but im gonna scratch this game off as an l i hope im wrong but im not confident
dream scenario

greg roman thinks that without lamar theyre going to need to run the ball a lot more

to his surprise but nobody elses running the ball a lot in an offense built around the run works

it works so well in fact the the ravens actually beat the steelers this makes roman think wow if we could do this with backups imagine what we could do with the starters

cowboys come around and roman tries running the ball and feeding dobbins a ton they blow the doors off the cowboys and look like the ravens on last year all the way to the super bowl
im not trying to get anyone hyped too much or anything but my dream last night was rg3 going off today
it was a close loss when we had our team at full strength now half the team wont be playing i dont have high hope
speak on it dex
in lamars voice lezzzz go lezzz go dezzzz go
well that didnt go as planned
hi ravens fans would any of you have a template of this meme by chance i cant find one online would be much appreciated
narrator there would be no stunting
lets go boys

edit source ravensnumbers
how is this line only at 105 i know we usually play these games close but damn we are missing so many people
perfect
worst thanksgiving game ever
bruh im working
this is as complicated as dark
lol straight outta an snl sketch
haha thats a mouth full
jeebus this headline gave me a headache

but its still good haha
anyone know where i can listen to the game
i am confused
im surprisingly excited for this game given the state of our team time to channel 2015
at least our beatdown will come after some great meme work
im ready but i forgot to thaw the wings oh well
who was screeching like a wounded cat after that tackle

you seem cool but i still am obligated under section l subsection 5 of the rravens unofficial rules to say fuck the steelers

have a pleasant day you crazy yinzer
its insane how narrow minded and stupid people are the nfl isnt trying to protect the delicate ravens this situation is different because we had an out break with multiple players testing positive daily imagine if the ravens played pitt on thanksgiving ignoring this outbreak now the steelrs would most likely get an outbreak and so on and so forth
i just want this whole thing over but this type of outbreak will happen again for someone else during the season lets hope its handled better than this
this right here is something mr rogers would be happy to see

have a good day
go choke on a primantis sub

kidding

good luck

fts
stfu dont come in our sub

jk good luck as well
we do too also fuck steve saunders

view poll
hell nah lmao

lets be realistic about this afternoonwere without an entire defensive line offensive line virtually have no te or our starting qb and they havent practiced in a week playing against one of the better teams in football

so 65 we have the cowboys bengals jags browns giants we should win all those games if the team is back to healthy and well probably need to

go in truzz fuck the steelers fuck the browns amen
this is cake compared to 2018 at the point we benched flacco losing record rookie going in had to basically win out and we pulled it off belee
and in true 2020 fashion the browns game will be our toughest hurdle
106 makes the playoffs almost every year with a 7th seed now 106 is almost a guarantee i think we get away with 1 more loss but winning out would definitely guarantee us a spot
always been the case ravens never get help but they always control their own destiny
im ready to go back to being the ultimate nobody believes in us underdog that the entire league craps on that is until our team comes charging into the lions den with a spear screaming like a banshee and ruining the narrative

harbaugh has to be having the time of career with this pregame speech everybody is sickhurt nobody thinks we have a chance but its the fing steelers win or lose a few of these nonames are going to prove to be true ravens today by stepping up and kicking ass

big truzz time to remind the league what ravens football looks like
you guys better win all those fucking games wft needs cowboys and giants losses lol
got to catch up to the browns first oh the irony lol
honestly hoping we dont make the playoffs this year lots of quality midround talent in next years draft get healthy hire a new oc grab an elite receiver or ol in the draft and come back hard next year

in your opinion what would be a realistic effective game plan to come out of pittsburgh with a w

to me it seems clear that running the ball 4050 times would do it considering we could have all 4 backs for today while mixing in play action passes pittsburgh will also be without stephon tuitt who they had last time



as far as their run game vs our defense we might even have an advantage since they dont have james conner

our secondary is at full strength and it should also be noted that we didnt have jimmy smith the last time we played

finally lettuce pray that gro takes his head out of his ass in this one
turnovers from the secondary run the ball down their throats with gus edwards and jk if hes activated take any points we can get whether theyre with tucker or not
convince pittsburgh to say fuck this shit and sit their starters to protect them from the virus
no turnovers pound the ball clear eyes full hearts
you nailed it except i want to phase out ingram and hill shouldnt play anywhere but special teams

sometimes we rotate too much and it prevents us from getting into a rhythm
defense gets a shut out and tucker hits 3 fg

in my wet dream we win 90 and utterly piss of the the entire world
prior to the snap our lineman start clearing their throats if the steelers are smart theyll be in no hurry to engage and the ravens will get off the ball faster every time
game plan

1 run the fucking ball


2 defense be god tier please youre our only hope


3 win
ride the bus to victory

running successfully keeps the game short keeps their offense off the field and negates their biggest strengths in the pass rush and turnover potential not sure how we can do this without an o line but its the best plan i got
to super simplify it we have to play a mistake free game and force the steelers to make a couple
idk why but i feel much better about this game today then i did monday i think well still lose but it would be much closer as for how we win mark ingram must perform a sacrifice to the football gods
if there is any chance for a win it will come down to time of possession and ball control d will probably need a few turnovers and the run game must take control but due to our patchwork o line i doubt the offense will get much going in the air or ground
same way we won week 17 last year

dont turn the ball over and run them over let rg3 run as well hes unironically a fantastic runner and still has his speed
not adding much here run well limit mistakes create mistakes but one wildcard that is out of our hands pitt is fully capable of coming out flat and playing like shit its unlikely vs us in a rivalry game but them taking it lightly being rusty vs our us vs world mentality could be just what the doctor ordered
running is key but i feel like we need a quick score early pa bomb flea flicker or at least some type of speed score on the one hand weve had hardly any practice recently so not much time for the backups to get in sync for tricktiming plays but we also should have the advantage of the steelers having little to no tape on the guys we might heavily feature which could lead to some misdirection i think everyone thinks that were gonna run a lot with gus but id like to see some creative screens to duvernay or hollywood and see if they can take advantage of their speed
i think our best chance at winning is points on defense

i dont think our offense will be able to score enough by themselves scoring on defense and keeping a short field for rgiii
and for the love of god
no stupid penalties
by getting more points than the steelers

mandrews slander
the soulja drops it
andrews drops it it should it be andrews is wide open and has to diveleave his feet to make a circus catch

hope the ravens win so rnfl has a meltdown and cause fuck the steelers
itsgonnabecolditsgonnabegrey anditsgonnalast you for the rest of your life
well done
this is amazing
now this actually put a smile on my face thanks man
i hope we win and watch everyone lose their shit
does anyone think we should just give trace mcsorely his chance today
were gonna get owned
wow those refs were bad why is 82 on the team what a pussy
shit was glorious

getting kind of sick of these threads about how half our roster is out because of covid and the steelers are 100 and we need to respect them blah blah blah

the steelers are hoes on them we shall stunt

2 points

who have the steelers beat i mean yeah they beat us but we have greg roman as our oc and a legit bottom 3 recieving corps the steelers struggled against the jags also hoes in a game which jeapordized their undefeated season

yeah i know broderick washington is going to be heading our dline and i know lamar is out but i ask you how can a fully healthy steelers offensive line exploit our 3 defensive lineman if james conner is out big ben will be forced to throw in our secondary that still has 2 all pro cbs

we are going to destroy the steelers our offensive may be mediocre when healthy our defense may have forgotten how to tackle rg3 may throw more picks than completions but he played like jesus in 2012 and when he won the heisman

fuck the steelers ravens 2013
the only way to survive humiliation is to own it well done
lol ill take the enthusiasm over the goddamn doomers infecting this sub

not saying people cant be worried about this game but the giving up on the season is too much were a 64 team in the playoff hunt youd think we were the jets by the way people talk
hah
im with this guy fuck the world and fuck the steelers

if we dont get into the playoffs fucking sucks but well be back next year

never take counsel of your fears stonewall jackson
bruh you gotta put the s so some karma whore from rnfl cant come crosspost and get free ravens bad karma
the steelers crushed the jags 273not sure what game you watched maybe youre thinking of the dallas game
i lost it at who have the steelers beat i mean yeah they beat us
gotta love it lmaoo
we beat the jags 273 thats not a struggle that would be like yalls 5910 win over the phins was a close game
steeler fan here i think youre forgetting that we also beat the titans which you guys lost too ee also have one of the best if not the best defense in the nfl currently so your inexperienced quarterback is going to throw a couple of picks right to fitzpatrick haden nelson or another one of our other amazing secondary players also our dline is having a great streak of consecutive games with at least one sack at 68 so yall better prepare for your guy to get bruises all over him consider it one of our welcome to pittsburgh presents

also big ben has only 5 interceptions this season compared to 24 touchdowns whereas lamar jackson has 6 interceptions and a measly 15 touchdowns so yeah ben might throw a pick but you can be sure hell be slinging touchdowns all night long

that being said i hope we can actually play a nice clean game ive been on this sub constantly saying that i hope your players get rid of the nasty virus real soon and that i cant wait to see an amazing game played im praying for the safety of all your and my players and i hope you will too see yall on the field


the steelers are hoes on them we shall stunt

can we let this meme die it backfired on us already
lets go fuckin get some and give some we comin after grandma at tea time

fuck the steelers and fuck the nfl
love the energy
forgot to mention the star of the show fuck steve saunders
if the ravens lose they are eliminated from winning the afc north and the steelers are set up nicely to go 160 fun times
this game is going to be more lit than the rockefeller christmas tree tonight s maybe
there we go someone posted this earlier and didnt call me a bitch it didnt feel right
from chiefs kingdom go get it boys
fuck the ravens and i hope we can actually have a game
fuck the ravens

well if he hates us i cant imagine how much he must hate yall

the steelers have the same exact schedule as the ravens but play the bills and the broncos instead of the patriots and the chiefs of which the bills have been a better team than the patriots the six week stretch of the steelers not traveling was simply due to a coronavirus outbreak with the titans the steelers also travel the second least of all teams that is correct but number one is the ravens the steelers also practiced until friday on their official bye week thats doesnt sound like rest to me i appreciate the work you put into the post but your points have glaring holes in them
the reason they had 6 weeks without travel is because their week 4 away game vs the titans got canceled that then took away their full week 8 bye and made their bye week 3 days off in week 4

at least the few games flacco started were their most competitive games all season

man that sucks were shorthanded enoughthe players that are eligible to play should play
wow usually dobbins has to average 10 ypc before he gets prematurely benched
makes sense wish it was different but they havent practiced in pads in weeks you cant not practice and then go execute at a high level in the nfl
did anyone think this was what was gonna give us the win
at least this will slightly shut up the steeler pissbabies that think the nfl pushed the game so wed get players back
what a waste
maybe coaches figure were going to lose so they are just benching people to be safe
personally we were underdogs going in to this game at full strength with our situation sorry to be a downer but i dont see any chance we win id rather not expose them to injury when its really not going to help much you know its going to be a physical game the way it is
this really sucks
if theyre not playing then there is a reason good enough for either of them to not play

i think the only reason this game wasnt cancelled is that nbc paid a shitload of money to have it thanksgiving night and expected a ton of viewership the league is also negotiating new tv deals right now so they probably feel obligated to keep the networks happy if nbc wants wednesday afternoon they get wednesday afternoon

im surprised nbc would not rather have a week 18 game though at this point it looks like week 18 is a real possibility as cases ramp up in the league and nationwide it would probably be limited to games with playoff implications so ravenssteelers could have been one of only a few games if not the only game im sure that would get better numbers for nbc than wednesday afternoon
not to mention 11 straight days of the team having a positive covid19 test if this game doesnt qualify for a cancellation or reschedule to week 18 what will

screw goodell
this is about contract law and nbc not the nfl nbc has a contract with rockefeller center tishman speyer that says that thry will telecast the christmas tree lighting live so they cant then go back to them and say you know what we have decided to not do this to show a football game instead with another client

damn four more of these and well have the entire roster for today
i think we see a heavy dose of dez tonight this afternoon short dump routes and him fighting for more yards
if this were 2013 we all would be ecstatic about having rg3 throwing to dez bryant its crazy how things can change
post this in rcowboys we basically bandwagon yall now

i love football that said we have had 10 days of positive covid cases this game should not be played today

imo they should move to week 18 or just cancel it
yes they are pretty much past the point of no return now

i threw a buck on hollywood getting 100 yards and a td it was like 5700 ish figured why not
while i would bet on the steelers to win this one i feel that we have a better chance to win than most people on this sub think the steelers have almost lost to many bad teams this year yes the steelers are a good team this year but have proven that they are very beatable despite their undefeated record our elite secondary is still intact which is huge and is capable of creating turnovers yes our d line is depleted but considering the circumstances they did a better job than expected in handling henry last game our offense will definitely be shaky this week but plenty of bad offenses have looked competent again the steelers this season additionally we have multiple unknown factors on our offense in some underdeveloped players that may surprise us with their increased workload today duvernay dez dobbins proche also i think rg3 is still a bit of an unknown he looked very lackluster last year in his start against pittsburgh but the weather was terrible in that game and havent seen him play in good conditions yet like i said before i dont think we will win today but i think we will be pleasantly surprised today regardless of the outcome
lets set our expectations mathematically we almost cant win the afc north i just hope we give dez some practice today and that the team recovers keeps uninjured is ready to play the cowboys next tuesday

yeah its going to suck if we get blown out but you cant be surprised if it happens given whos even on the roster avoid rnfl as its going to be a massive jerkoff over the rulebreakers losing

best case scenario we keep it competitive and maybe win a close one if the steelers really choke
i understand but youve gotta wonder how theyre gonna fare with a depleted ol that has already been pretty lackluster this season thats my biggest concern today
who cares what chances people give us

well either win the game or we wont well find out in about 67 hours

we have a lot of injuries and covid absences it would be a miracle win but well see
if we win were going to the super bowl no doubt big truzz
i just want they play healthy a this point
we won with ryan mallet anything and i mean anything can happen in this rivalry
itll be hard for us to win but the steelers are paper tigers this year they have been extremely lucky in a lot of their games sometimes thats just how it goes like our 2012 run this is a weird game i dont like our chances but anything can happen
trace no longer has covid so he might play a few snaps

removed
if we beat pittsburgh and end their undefeated season while putting us back in the playoffs i would not give the slightest fuck what any other fan thinks not that i even gaf now nor should any ravens fan

theyre probably all mad because lamar has beaten their team before
wolves do not concern themselves with the opinion of sheep
uhwhy
if rg3 balls youre going to be unfond of my subsequent comments go ravens
who cares what other people think about lamar lamar doesnt care why should we
people are going to bitch regardless you shouldnt concern yourself with it

tbh just hoping we can see some flashes of greatness in our back ups or starters ill literally take any one of the following


dez to have 10 catches for over 100 yards
gus justice to combine for 200 on the ground
hollywood breaks his funk for 100 receiving
a no name olb for 3 sacks
pretty sure the team with its roster healthy and not playing with mostly backups has the benefit
if you lose follow the gop precedent sue and claim you won s
if the ravens lose today they will be in the 9th seed for the playoffs they lose the tiebreaker with lv raiders based on their conference record

things are bad enough get that cursed cake shit outta here

weve done with mallet we can do it with rg3

im trying to decide when an appropriate time to start drinking for this game is
now heres wonderwall
the ravens broke protocol they should lose a draft pick

answer the nfl has only docked draft picks for repeat violations this was not a repeat violation

the broncos were forced to play double standard for the ravens

answer the broncos had one player test positive and three players go on the close contacts list because they werent wearing masks in meetings the ravens had over 15 players test positive the delay of the ravens game was due to several players testing positive for consecutive days

the ravens cried about playing tuesday to get ingram and dobbins back

answer the ravens didnt want to play tuesday because they had not practiced and ingram and dobbins arent playing

the ravens got four other players back by delaying

answer none of them are playing either

the titans made the steelers miss their bye

answer tell me how many yards ben roethlisberger threw for in week 4

the ravens are getting an extra day of rest because their next game was moved to tuesday instead of monday the steelers only got moved to monday

answer both teams had their games pushed by a day this is not an advantage for the ravens the cowboys will be playing on 11 days rest

the steelers never would have let this happen

answer they already did earlier in the season vance mcdonald was put on the covid list and ben was moved there as a close contact if their game that week had been a thursday game they would have been without him also see one conner james
i dont know how true this is but yesterday i read something that the broncos were not totally cooperative regarding their situation either something along the lines of not cooperating answering questions about the bracelets and stuff like that which if true i can totally see the nfl being like screw you then youre playing figure it out
trash talk never dies haha rg3 and dez about to take us back to 2012 today and make a highlight tape

i believe we have a home game played today at mt bank north
its honestly frustrating how people have already given up on this game not to mention the season

if this season has taught football fans anything its that this is a week to week game the steelers almost lost to the cowboys

the game doesnt start until kickoff and it doesnt end until the final whistle cheer your team through that whole period or get off the bandwagon

truzz
shh yall hear that thats the sound of a raven shitting on a terrible towel
gus is going to go off and rg3 going to make ben wish he was playing a running back dgaf brigadiers make your smart ass remarks and downvote us
the way i see it if they can get in tuckers fg range theyll be quicker to let him kick than they usually are and ive already said i could see him getting the nfl record 9 fgs
no just no

rockin my marlo jersey hes playing right
im gonna wear my torrey smith jersey today hoping that his 2012 magic will come back and bring the 2012 magic back to rgiii and dez
i should do that to my ray rice jersey lol

obvi i gotta shout to the the classic


view poll
you are very dumb if you think you need a new head coach
not over harbs if i was another team and i needed an hc hed be at the top of the list
for starters harbaugh isnt going anywhere the second thing is how much is bieniemy responsible for the success of that offense hes got studs all over that offense not to mention reid would he still have success without all of these pieces
imagine the coaching turnover in the nfl if fans had a say
this is his chance to start a game and prove he still has has in the tank he is going to lay it all down on the line for us today and hopefully lead us to victory regardless i think he will have an amazing game
if the run game gus bus can take over and rgiii can hit some play action i actually like our chances
all imma say is we thought we were going to roll the patriots and they ran it down our throats the same could happen this afternoon to the steelers who by the way are due for a let down here soon
fully predict we see trace by the 2nd half
this didnt age well
hes had his chances and he hasnt looked good against much worse competition
win or lose im really happy hes getting starts and playing time again

you deserved to get banned is it that hard to not use that word
get with the times and dont complain to us about your inability to sympathize for people with disabilities

i would have banned you too
i dont think thats the lesson you should take from this

understand that using that term is punching down at a group of people who didnt choose that condition and by complaining about it you sound like a boomer being told they cant drop the nword anymore
ok dont use that word then its not hard
i was banned for suggestion marty smith would be a better on air commentator than booger mcfarland
i got banned from there during the djax jewish twitter debacle

i literally just turned around some antisemite commenters words by quoting them and replacing jewish with black to show them the obvious racism of their comment

got banned appealed it to the mods who told me they didnt see how my comment followed and the ban stuck

fuck rnfl and their racist asses
i got banned for saying devin mccourty was very articulate in a post game presser once
hes a baltimore rapper so thought i would ask super unique producer and got him as my top artist this year so wanted to see if anyone in the flock knew of him or listens to him
yessir all my heroes are cornballs was spectacular
love jpegmafia dude got his start living on calvert street

thank the gro

underrated movie scene in an underrated movie
im not going to fuck your face gary
god this clip is so versatile
i think thats nerves not covid

wait why are we playing this game then
this game should be cancelled
grey brain i hope the ravens win

galaxy brain i hope everyone on both teams is healthy
wtf this game is cursed hopefully hes okay but the nfl some corrupt mother fuckers
steelers should forfeit s
itd be nice if they said if he was covid positive from the rapid test close contact or just having the symptoms this little information updates is fucking brutal
afaik we still have only had james conner actually test positive everyone else was due to unrelated illness or close contact right

so likely this is close contact with jc and hes fine
i predict rgiii will throw an ill advised deep ball that gets intercepted i also predict marquise brown will have his best game of the season so far
justin tucker nfl record 9 fgs
we win
duvernay and rg3 show a decent rapport devin gets his 1st rec td

each ravens rb including tyson williams gets a rushing td
probably a low scoring shitshow honestlyim just hoping nobody gets hurt id guess something like 176 steelers
i predict that a football game will be played and in the next couple of days the steelers will have more covid cases how does the center get covid without the rest of the oline or quarterback coming into contact
133 ravens
i hope we win but i see us losing 203 or something like that i just dont see rg3 being able to do anything
not sure why people seem to think brown will have a good game are you just thinking dez takes a lot of attention away from him

wrong purple team

chill ima cry
this is the wholesome content i need thats awesome
this my first time hearing about this kids story im sad now

how awesome is this mo gaba way officially unveiled on w west st in baltimore

on a day the depleted ravens need to dig deep more than ever before how fitting that this citys most spirited superfan is now forever immortalized

ravens by a million
awesome
im so tired of them and a lot of rnfl thinking this is helping us were still playing with half of our practice squad we both have games on monday weve only had half of a practice to prepare

that being said i hope we destroy them
fuck the steelers
the salt will be next level and i am here for it
if we win and they whine ill be ok
theyre gonna whine no matter what after this game its gonna be thread after thread what punishment should the ravens get
if they lose thats on them were missing 12 starters
were gonna lose if its close ill still count that as a win
that why we have to win
if we win the steelers winning would be music to my ears
3 minutes to go in the 3rd rg3 throws and deep in to dez who breaks and tackle and take it in to score 356

start of 4th quarter trace mcsorely comes in

that is it

apparently i have to put in that its the ravens 35 to the steelers 6
how bout a win

if theyre eligible why arent they playing tho
removed
seriously thats just unnecessary at this point get back to the steelers sub and stop making us all look bad
nobody worried bout a reg season game bruh see the ravens in the playoffs when the team is healthy
o no way really
youre

yep
a user named after chris wormley wgat was the reasoning there
well youre not wrong
should be despite baltimores continous effort of not following protocol

we are fucked
wet ass footwork
we aint forfeiting
wednesday ass football
wet ass fussy

how does this not have a million upvotes
miracle is the goat sports movie change my mind
maurice pouncey is on the covid list now just postpone the game to week 18 already theyre already getting sick without even playing us

big ben would test positive right now and goodell would still play this game
postpone the entire season until we all get vaccinated

all afuckenboard
gus looks like a legit bus driver in this photo haha
lets go ravens woohoo
dont worry no ink this year
this aged well
people can call pittsburgh piss all they want but its actually a nice citymost of it however baltimore is fucking trash no one says hey lets go to baltimore people are more likely to say hey i would rather have herpes

what a time for backup plans

honestly they outplayed both pitt and tenn the pats game was in a monsoon without key defensive players only team that worries me is kc we can beat anyone else
its elo rankings i think our insane run from week8 from last year is heavily influencing this same with titans who had a really good run last year late in the season
when healthy we have the best roster along with the saints and chiefs we just lost a lot of starters this year
street cred bb
if we could eliminate only the brainmelting mistakes wed be handling teams like the steelers and titans pretty easily

until tests come back tomorrow and the steelers start their own trend

pussy ass bitches couldnt wait to play against the p squad
man the steelers think theyre so much better than they actually are
lol theyre not even that fucking nice
if its an easy one why should they need good luck fuck that guy and the steelers
it will be hella satisfying if we can play them in the playoffs at full strength steelers players and fans have no interest in playing this team with starters what a bunch of pansies
if we just sucked ok fair trash talk all ya want but when youre not even playing and your teams going against a squad of backups due to a global pandemic thats low as fuck
dolphins fan here please embarrass the fraudulent squealers i hope marquise brown torches minkah shitzpatrick
well thats dumb
i got a feeling not gonna say but its building up inside
there is no one likable on the steelers
fuck that guy
i cant wait until the playoffs when they get their asses kicked by the chiefs
i wish they played the chiefs this season they would get fucking crushed
fuck him
wouldnt it be so fitting for the 2nd string ravens to spoil the steelers perfect 100 record renewing the rivalry cant wait fuck the steelers
who dat
who tf is this clown
are you surprised that a tomlin led team has players who act like they that
i guess thats sorta how rivalries are
pittsburgh fan
man you all are toxic as all hell can get yes tuitt said it should be a easy one which it honestly should of a lot of your guys starters were out i dont see him shit talking calling anyone out or anything like that
god lord
off covid list but not playing

he is still dealing with his injury from last week
yall can pick the design and whatnot but i highly doubt it comes to that were basically fielding a practice squad and my confidence level with this team is rather low tbh

edit im just gonna get the tattoo anyway whatever lmao
screened good luck to you sir
ill join in if the ravens win this game ill get a rg3 tattoo
youll have to share a picture of it with this sub if it happens
rg3 jersey on the penis the helmet is already purple naturally so add stripes and a poe on either side and ur good
how about a trace one instead
i have the perfect design


what about a trace mccsorley tat
you know you want an rgiii tattoo and are just using this as a free excuse haha
warm up the trace mcsorley tattoo gun
well you wont have to worry about wasting your money from the looks of it
it joe haden suffers a karmic injury after his whining i will get a dr alan sills tattoo
these are the actions people regret around 30

dont worry no ink this year

the titans stomping on the shield at mt was worse but ravens still didnt do anything about it
not only is this idiotic to tweet out against a rival regardless of the situation to brag about padding stats against someone when that team is dealing with a bunch of absences due to a virus thats ravaging the globe is fucked up
wouldnt it be a shame if potentially the 2 seed steelers and the 7 seed ravens meet in the first round of the playoffs this tweet could age very poorly
these guys are suck fucking cunts
removed
if pittsburgh was smart they wouldnt have in key starters in today tbh
meh not too far off the comments ray lewis john harbaugh shannon sharpe bart scott etc in the past used to make
we have three mobile qbs active a bunch of back ups elsewhere except wr somehow who else think roman is gonna go nuts and play some 3 qb sets

i think our run game is going to be crazy today
after tuitts tweet im hyped ready to watch them blow it
im excited to see the steelers get a covid outbreak in their locker room after today and watch it derail their perfect season
tuitts tears will be really delicious then
if we can get one touchdown ill be impressed
i like the enthusiasm but when would they have had time to practice that
uh

real fan dan if you are here you are a legend
i want rg3 to come out guns blazing like hes about to win the starting job the rest of the year and get this offense on track
i miss 2019

ryan mallett the god
honestly one of the most satisfying wins of the decade ended up sweeping them in that terrible 2015 season
hes just salty cuz last 2 years


hoping this bites them in the ass
i dont see any problem with it just makes it that much sweeter if we did somehow manage to win
it is what it is kinda isnt wrong though is he though i would love to embarrass them
weve been getting embarrassed for like the past 3 weeks now between getting best by the patriots titans dancing on our logo and abusing us physically and now this
sounds like us before the titans game lmao
their 100 team reminds me of last years 90 patriots overrated as hell

fuck the steelers
unfortunately their schedule is so soft the only 2 teams left to test them are the bills and colts and both are so inconsistent theres no telling if theyll show up that day
paper tigers
yep they get the same non division teams as us but minus having to play all the first place teams last year when ben retires they go right back to shit
pats were better
i dont think theyll be able to beat kc i dont think anyone can really
you all sound rediculous i dont care who theyve played theyre 100
i cant call a undefeated team overrated plus they beat the ravens
remember the ravens would be a solid name

ladies and gentlemen i have one thing to say
this game is gonna get my hopes up and then disappoint me in the end isnt it
lol a facebook comment i saw said the game hasnt even started yet and weve already been flagged for illegal formation 3 times
so i have heart surgery tomorrow and its a bit of a complicated double procedure i may not make it out but i just wanted to say that deep down this was always my favorite rivalry the games between these two teams has been one of the few things that gave me happiness in my otherwise somewhat empty life
delay of game by rule if 1a player who has unnecessarily remained on a downed runner
he shouldve asked goodell how the fuck that wasnt a delay of game
what fucking statement are they making when they stop a practice squad
honestly if we lose fuck having a blame of the game im proud and the steelers have been sufficiently exposed for my taste already
mods i dont want to see a single steelers fan coming here in peace post after this shit
bowser thinking hes ed reed gonna return it 105 yards for a td to help out his offense
i hate when it feels like were playing against the refs
if we can lead after every quarter we will win
this is the most fun game thread ive been apart of in like 4 years
i cant wait to see the chiefs fucking embarrass these guys
how the fuck are we playing with half a team and the biggest problem is still offensive play calling
idk who harris even is but bravo that was huge
even if we lose this is still an outstanding job by the nonstarters very impressed

this is what ive been saying all year you can tell when theyre unfocused and not trying rn theyre clearly in it to win and it shows might have to reorganize the starting lineup after this imo
can the commentators get the steelers cock out of there mouth
100 team still relying on cheap tactics to beat a team with half 2nd stringers
pad the stats
fuck the steelers dirty ass team
what a fucking waste of a great defensive performance god fucking damnit
ravens hold steelers offense to 2 fgs over almost 3 quarters

collinsworth crickets

steelers start dominating 2nd and 3rd string ravens offense

colinsworth look at this dominating performance
can the fuckers in here calling for lamars head every week chill tf now gro calling literally the same plays with rg3 and trace lamar isnt the problem gro is
imagine showboating when youre securing the game on a final drive vs a 3rd string practice squad
that missed opportunity at the end of the 1st half is really bothering me now
what the fuck is this shit theater the chains showed it short
hell might have won with mcsorley in
they called it short at first and then they wanna call it forward whattttttttt
this game as made me appreciate lamar x a billion he will be worth every penny when he gets his big check
marquise nickname brown should be traded for the best offer asap
glad we hit that fat fuck early fuck ben fuck the steelers and fuck their fans
hollywood stinks man
okay steelers playing 8 man boxes all the time now should take roman until week 17 to adjust
i dont want to hear yall bitching about the defense giving up plays in the 4th qtr when they only get 2 minutes between series they are going to die eventually
imagine if we had llama
browns got no fight in him

doesnt jump for the ball doesnt reach with both hands he doesnt want to go for the ball unless theres nobody in ten yards of him

quite the soulja that one
lol cool refs i never wanna hear about the nfl favoring the ravens again
everytime i hear the crowd cheer on a big play by the steelers defense im just like what do you expect against a back up offense but then i remember that its fake crowd noise and that almost makes it worse
goddamn i cant get over that harris play what a beaut
that spot was high crime
if you want my opinion some of you are taking this way too seriously lol we put a practice squad out there just realize we have next to no chance of winning and then just vibe through the game its way more fun this way
how tf is this steelers team 100
stop the count
3 nocalls all going against the ravens why am i surprised
so do refs just forget how the clock works in ravenssteelers games
give him some fucking hardball questions
people tell me that id like claypool and juju if they were on any other team and thats simply not true theyre genuinely annoying as fuck
if we win i will livestream myself listening to the trace mcsorely song for 24 hours
no ones gonna be talking about that catch in a dodgy ass practice squad game years from now collinsworth you nasally will arnett sounding bitch
the pittsburgh steelers are making a statement on defense

theyre literally facing a practice squad team you intolerable incompetent fuck
worst 100 team ever
chains showing its short graphic says its inches short then it magically changes to 1st down to the refs then calling not enough evidence to over turn it

x200b

i guess the only reason im salty about this game is because it was acutally close imagine these frauds play an actual contender
he needs some milk
feels like hollywood has quit on us
fuck you collinsworth
packer fan coming to say

i love that boy tramon williams good to see him making some plays for yall
fumble or incomplete one thing is certain


marlon humphrey is jujus daddy
this is the weirdest game ive ever seen and pittsburgh should be embarrassed that they had to fight this hard to beat out practice squad defense played great for a while but have gotten gassed here in the 4th quarter and arent making the plays anymore
a gaggle of karens
yall exposed steelers are sus at 110 should be 101 got saved by refs but be proud of exposing them
the fact that yall r even in this game is embarrassing worst 100 team ever ima ravens fan for the day please win this
fuck
lets go fuck you pittsburgh

watching a game with no expectations is fun
our new center is the best center weve had all year hes manhandling the best dline in football wtf
holy shit their team is actual dogshit i hope we meet them in the playoffs
play without practice nfl said its perfectly safe they said
that seems illegal
you can just lay on top of people for 20 seconds
goodell isnt even trying to look away from the script lmao
so is greg roman the worst or the fucking worst
786 in penalty yards if you dont like that than you dont like ravens football
we really could have won had wilson caught that td
this offense is literally high school level without lamar he absolutely carries roman
congratulations marquise youre hollywood nickname privileges have been reinstated until the end of the day
if only luke wilson could hold on to a football
the fact this game is even close and refs bailed them out at half tells you everything you need to know about this steelers team
steelers fans can gloat all they want about this win over our practice squad but they better know deep down that they are the worst 110 team anyones ever seen they are going to get absolutely annihilated in the playoffs
genuinely curious how all these sports involving close margins tennis soccer etc have technology to read stuff down to the millimeter but the nfl still uses half blind 60 year olds best guesses
jets fan i hate my life that being said that ball was short fuck the steelers
refs had dinner reservations sorry yall
we just got bucked on that trace news loool
did we just get fucking robbed by the refs
how is that not a delay of game
im convinced the fire harbaugh comments are trolls dont feed them
the clock management was trash but you shouldnt let them just sit on us like that
i told myself i wouldnt get upset over this game and here we are
if theres one thing chiefs fans and ravens fans can agree on its fuck the steelers

if they beat yall today i promise well kick their ass in the playoffs
tj was offsides
starting to feel a defensive score is our only hope at a w
okay enough with rgiii and out
the steelers are so fucking bad bro i aint even mad if we lose imo they got embarrassed and exposed on national tv by our practice squad
am i crazy or is that att girl so fucking hot
all my homies love harris
the ravens lost this game because of steve saunders
new plan lay on the ball until the game is over
hollywood aint got no fight in him man
that long td was all false hope

always has been
steelers barely beat a team of practice squad players and recovering covid patients they should be absolutely fucking embarrassed not dancing and taunting like they are no wonder their city and franchise is an absolute shit hole of misery
as a neutral fan here that looked short by a solid amount
the refs screwed us at halftime and screwed us at the end
fuck the steelers fuck that ref crew and fuck the nfl bunch of assfucking clowns one and all
we lost but i am proud of my team anyway
im just a cardinals fan chillin here bc i hate the steelers no lie
terrible clock management

harbaugh didnt expect the refs let them hold our players on the ground for 18 fucking seconds
remember the last time the ravens played the steelers and they lost 25 seconds because some steelers player was laying on the ground 40 yards away from the play
steeler fans the nfl wants us to lose
stop the count
rg3andout
think this game eye opening for a lot of dudes who be shitting on lamar clearly werent here during boller
how shit are these fucking squeelers cant even scored on a team held together by masking tape lmaoo
fuck you hollywood low effort af
marquise brown cant run a route on tj watt for christs sake
hot take i like the throw call
i propose we destroy the city of pittsburg

all in favor say aye
i came into this game not giving a fuck and now im mad as fuck
that flag came in sooo late
hard to understand collinsworth with that steeler dick in his mouth
practice squad players making plays
some serious effort this game by our depth steelers are fucking pathetic need the refs to bail them out
this 33 guy is playing like hes a got a real shot which he does
if yall wanna be mad i dont know what to tell you this is a fucking college squad were playing with after no practice forever

be mad at the ne pit 10 and ten games
yeah you barely beat a 37 year old practice squad player whos been blanketing you all game fuck these twats
thrice again i am reminding my brethren that i hate the steelers ref browns and i cant wait to see lamar play tuesday and the majority of players back besides snead
not a ravens fans by any means chiefs but holy hell its been sometime since ive seen a team get so screwed i feel like someone needs to answer for this mess of an officiating squad
this game made sure lamar will be paid big money
wow the steelers beat the ravens practice squad who wouldve thought
rg3 gotta get something going the ravens defense looked good
in the words of our almost former president stop the count

76 game over i wish lol
stop the count
stop the count the steelers are fake news
wolfe is going to eat snells children
hate to be that guy but our d is going to be fucking gassed by the 4th if we have another three and out
how tf do they not throw a fuckin flag it took them 18 seconds for them to get off the ball
how was that not dealy of game
cheating bad clock mangement bad catch pick your poison all of them
its really embarrassing that the steelers need to literally cheat to have a chance of beating us when we are using 50 practice squad players

number 1 team in the nfl my ass
remember that one time we were in crunch and some random steeler players just laid down on the field for 40 seconds then as soon as he couldnt get any more time off the board he just popped up from his injury and walked away
bad clock management

except for the fact that if you take away five seconds of the steelers dude taking a nap there is still about three seconds on the clock after the dropped pass
the defense is playing as if the season is on the line tonight and you love seeing it
brown fucking sucks
of all the drives that was totally one of them
so do the steelers really think they have any chance against kc
put in trace for the memes alone please
fuck you idiots calling out peters for that second pass allowed he was hurt on the play before
im really starting to like this harris guy after today
no one celebrates like the steelers receivers

i know i would be celebrating too after scoring the first offense of td of the game in the 4th quarter against a guy fresh off the couch

ladies and gentlemen your 2020 undefeated steelers
why dez the only one who knows to run on that play snap and throw the ball
juju is a great personality

great personalities dont cry on twitter
seahawks fan here to say this team has gained some big time respect from me im no ravens fan at all but your guys have played with some serious heart tonight down an mvp qb both starting rbs and two stud defensive lineman the ravens have absolutely battled tonight keep your heads up youve got a great coach and a phenomenal cultureteam attitude
marquise brown is fraudulent
shouldve started mcsorley
lmao fucked by the refs all game
i expected to lose the game

i didnt expect to have my heart ripped out and reinserted several times
the nfl allowed the steelers to go 3andout what is this rigged bullshit

goodell loves the ravens

fucking bullshit
tyus bowser needs to be extended
fuck that meathead who got everyone infected
holy shit we scored
stop the count
can ray lewis come out of retirement and hit big ben then go back in retirement
take my legs bobby
hollywood decently covered by a pass rusher what the fuck hes terrible
looks like hollywood made zero effort on that
brown couldnt get separation against watt what a bum lol
i could beat marquise brown in a fight
no matter how this game ends up we are fighting with everything we have and the steelers are being exposed
the steelers were laying on the ball
how yall dissin the coaches they did the right playcall hes gotta catch that
look all things considered we got ourselves a game who knows what will happen second half
that was outrageous officiating i cannot believe they didnt call 4 fking players blatantly laying on him and holding him down those 3 pts will be crucial this game
can i get a fuck you roger
that drive gave me hope we can get down the field under the right circumstances at least
this is why i really hate the steelers not because were division rivals but because they do shit like this thats not a good honest way to win
roman is not even trying anymore lmfao
rg3 can fucking throw hes not a great passer but last i checked his right arm wasnt amputated

start throwing the ball
i fully didnt dont expect to win this game but im impressed with our defense so far
wow that nurses show looks cliche as fuck and unrealistic as well
imagine what this would have looked like at full capacity
right under the chin huh
3rd down routes short of the sticks should be fucking punishable by the geneva convention
cant believe collinsworth can still speak with that steeler dick down his throat
its like hollywood brown suddenly realized hes fucking tiny this year
lmao trace talking smack after being hit
man i cant wait to see the ravens decline hollywoods fifth year option only to see him sign with another team and become a viable number two immediately

this team cant develop receivers for the life of them
literally the worst undefeated team in history
anyone still remember that delay of game penalty that wasnt called we could be up right now
absolutely hysterical that this steelers team was in legit danger of losing at home to a team of practice squad scrubs lmaoooo
the steelers literally only beat a practice squad by 5 points
spot shouldnt even matter they measured and the tip of the ball wasnt to the fkn marker
good representation there pittsburgh with the fat karen screaming
can someone explain how the ball was short but they ruled it a first down
couldnt be more prouder of our boys
how the fuck was that not a delay of game
they literally sat on us for 15 seconds and dont call dealy of game

i dont want to see those dipshits on rnfl talk about how they favor the ravens this is fucking bullshit
bengals fan here just wanted to say fuck the steelers over rated ass team with the worst fans
lions fan that spot was disgusting when they measured it the ball was even short wtf
keen for a win this game ive got ravens winning 523
that play didnt work so watch roman call it 20 more times today
fuck you ben


bowser shouldve stayed in the endzone though
all you need to do is not turn it over rg3 and you have two in three drives
rg3 big ben throwing awful interceptions
stop the count
even if we lose 307 ill be happy we made the steelers nervous and annoyed for even just a few minutes
the steelers offense is literally just throwing 2 yard passes over and over
elliot isnt the best form tackler if youre in front of him hes bringing the wood but he cant really tackle well without the hit stick
who legit is just having fun watching this game and thread im fucking happy the bandwagons hopped off
yo we have a 40 year old corner out there covering juju lol
if that pick 6 didnt happen it would have been 73 ravens
bah gawd thats ryan malletts music
literally like no practice this week and this thread is pissed we are losing with 36 total players active
imagine being a 100 team not blowing out a practice squad steelers are the fucking softest team fucking bad
stat padding meant field goal percentage clearly

but not extra point gotta be clear on that
this is the game for roman to get creative do crazy shit so far he is calling the same shitty old vanilla ass game and his excuse will be covid

fuck the steelers
steelers are dirty as shit lmao
that was a good play call to be aggressive simmer down all of you
went from a fun game no matter what happens to being absolutely raging
did that motherfucker seriously just lay on him
i am not a huge fan of that earlier timeout but have no problem going for it on 3rd they clearly called both plays before the huddle and didnt expect the steelers to be able to waste 15 seconds of clock still wouldve had time for the fg

realistically luke needs to catch that 100 of the time
steelers are being exposed that they have to literally cheat because theyre losing to a practice squad
anyone else fuming right now how tf did the ravens not think the steelers were going to do some shady shit after a run up the middle unbelievable
been rooting for you guys all game honestly that last drive looked promising fuck the refs for allowing that bullshit and fuck the steelers i still believe this game can come to harbough out coaching tomlin for the win
tj offsides half the time
positive play for the ravens lets throw a flag
note these are the same refs that screwed us in the first game this year vs the steelers
fuck man defense is gonna be tired they aint gonna hold forever
the painful thing about this game isnt losing its that lamar would have won it
marlon humphrey and punching the ball out of jujus hands name a more iconic duo
remember the good old days when we didnt realize how flawed our team was and marlo was using the fruit punch every game pepperidge farms remembers
what a fucking play by harris
lmao i dont even know half these dudes on our defense you just have to laugh at this point
doesnt matter what happens in the 4th we came out here on national tv in the spotlight and are giving the undefeated steelers all they can handle with half a starting squad
he grabbed onto the facemask lmao ref was right behind him
lmao collinsworth is such ass


they had their chance with the passing i dont see them doing anything but running here

passing touchdown


if they were going to throw thats what i thought theyd do
dovernay marquise
just not gonna call them for a hold just will not
if trace leads a comeback the meme game will no know bounds
chorus
throw it on a dime
like i aint even trying
just a kid from briar woods
im wearing number nine
met coach franklin down at vandy
flip to happy valley
now im coming back and got the natty on my mind
they cant touch my deep ball
every game im scoring
im your favorite quarterback
they call me trace mcsorley
rep that blue and white
you know i do it for the glory
baker won the hisman next up trace mcsorley
so in the biggest plot twist of 2020 lamar jackson throwing for 150 in this offense is actually really impressive
marlon humphrey with 2 forced fumbles in one game holy
quadruple coverage and he makes the catch

jfc
we saw trace score a td ill take it
wasnt the measurement short wtf
honestly im just saying pittsburgh nearly got beat by the practice squad i dont think they are that good if we meet them in the playoffs and we dont have half our players on ir we should win lets go boys just find something positive from this game
oh shit hollywood took a tackle
we lasted 3 minutes longer than i expected
steelers at 100 are imposters

i hope we will be the ones to expose them if not watch kc rip them a 2nd asshole
i miss flacco at least his balls would get picked off 60 yards down field
god i wish the steelers played the chiefs so they can get their ass blasted and everyone will shut up about them
stat your pads hoes
stop the count
the way he said the ravens lead that got me
stop the count
breaking news

the steelers have announced that they are sending their players home and the game will resume tomorrow all of their mailin touchdowns are being secured
fuck that smiling fuck hines ward
ive never hated a team more than the steelers and its not even close
wolfe has been so great for us
im hoping so hard we catch these guys again in the playoffs
hollywood i like you but youre so scared with the ball
screens off tackle runs slants

nah lets go with five step drops and play right into the steelers strength on defense

brilliant stuff from roman
shout out to humphrey for always showing up for steelers games
we want penn state kid
these guys are struggling against fucking rg3 and our practice squads practice squad lmao
you all wanted mcsorley
trace mcsorley 11 1 td bring it
delay of game on the steelers bro
nfl cheating for ravens tho guys remember
18 seconds refs kinda fucked up
thats terrible they stayed their asses on the ground how do they not get penalized for that
the steelers showing that theyve always been league favorite and they know it
the steelers are the grimiest cheatingest team ive seen in my life time and the refs are screwing us over every other game im sick and tired of this bullshit this year holy fuck
people from literally every team in rnfl except the steelers saying that was some shit and they still think it was fine damn
what kind of watch does robert goodell have is that the covid proximity tracker
our policies are working just fine hello the team on the field is playing with 22 active cases the fuck
wilson should have caught that
yup of course they said it shouldve been a delay of game
wow nbc is gonna fire this backup ref commentator for not sucking off a bad call
lol now they say it was delay of game always this crap what good are these corrections if you get it wrong on the field
lmfao fuck you roman
sam koch is such a fucking stud man best punter all time not even close
this is so frustrating i wanna fucking break the tv thats 2 fucking possessions should have had points
this steelers team is going to lose eventually

i just want it to be us to give it to them
this is the worst 100 team ever theyre going toe to toe with our practice squad
holy shit fuck these fucking refs
coloncastillo has been a pleasant surprise
if we cant throw we need to put trace in
too predictable on first down
oh its third and long great time to use that sweep running play that hasnt worked at all today
bro rg3 has a cannon for an arm if we actually use it we could surprise them and maybe draw a pi or make a big play
fire gro give wink a raise with that money
pick 6 feels worse and worse
i love how they called that roughing the passer to make it seem like bad calls are going both ways but then immediately fuck us with bullshit hold on fluker putting us in a worse position
my hatred for the steelers is at an alltime high

those cowards cant even move the ball on a team missing 20 players and are a shit refereeing decision away from being down
this game has not been as bad as i expected but we still need to get rid of roman they play 10 yards off our receivers and there are literally 0 quick slants in our playbook not every pass needs to be a 3 step drop with some slow developing postcorner
when queen starts trusting his instincts he is hoing to be special right now tho he does a bit too much second guessing what he is seeing
big bens getting fatter as his team gets more complacent
rg3 gonna finish with fewer pass yards than that practice squad wr for the broncos
you cant convince me trace mcsorely wouldve done worse than 25 fucking passing yards
why are people even mad rn we were never realistically going to win in fact we played better than anyone expected probably most people thought this game would be over by half time
bruh did roman just call an option with trace in
minkah is a certified bitch
fitzpatrick trash talking the 3rd string qb after he gained a 1st down really
steelers are some whiny bitches with how much they complaincelebrate vs a practice squad
so we all agree luke wilson will never play again right
hollywood doesnt even fight
luke wilson looks like a homeless hippie that stumbled onto the field
good lord if this doesnt show that lamar is top 5 at worst top 8 idk what does
ravens with a 70 yard pass play with their 3rd string qb

collinsworths face well shit
biggest letdown of this game was waiting so long to get trace mcgoat in
i mean this is a loss but god damn that defense fought to the end they never stopped they were composed of a good secondary and cast offs and practice squad squad people in the front 7 and they fucking shut the shit down in the redzone and the steelers won by 5 that vaunted undefeated team won against raggedy ass messes by 5


if we had lamar and our legitimate offense we smoke their asses
trace mcsorley is definitely the new 2 qb
if we lose the whole team gets to pummel steve saunders if we win the whole team gets to pummel steve saunders
despite all odds this team has forced the steelers to need every call to go their way and play all the way until the last second
if only the refs had this level of scrutiny at the missed delay of game call at the end of the 1st half
worst 110 team of all time
bizarre simply bizarre well get an apology from the league that will be sent under the radar and announced in a harbaugh press conference as usual
things learned

rg3 can go somewhere else
fucking steelers bitching about us all week

fuck that spoiled fucking shit of a team
lol if the ravens were laying on the pile to burn clock and it wasnt called steelers fans would shit their collective pants
literally held gus down for 20 seconds fuck the refs
im looking at all you fake ravens fans that were talking about how much you respect the steelers even though they do this dirty shit all the damn time
yall need to understand how good lamar is lol the comparison is
steelers won but at least they got exposed for being a super overrated team they barely beat a ravens practice squad lol
steelers fans needing to come to our sub to gloat about barely beating a practice squad lol
give bowser an extension let judon walk
raise your hand if your having to restrain your cheers to not arise suspicion with your employer
hype as fuck but why return that
this will be a pad statter for the steelers

fuck outta here
all aboard the motherfucking gus bus
holy fuck we scored lets go baby
were not getting shut out baby
stop the count
stop the count
stop the count
washington fan here rg3 boutta heat up lets go
ok defense blast them hoes
we didnt get shut out boys lets take it
youre losing to the practice squad
the steelers oline pointing out what our dline is gonna do as if they even know
starting practically all 2nd 3rd and practice squad players and yet still managing to have first string injuries this year is rough
astros cheated
excellent swat there by marlon humphrey
im emo af about our guys fighting this out against the odds love this team
so proud of the bois
nfl clearly helping out the ravens i mean what kind of team goes up against a practice squad and can barely get a field goal
lol hollywood literally tenses up five yards precontact insane
if brown werent scared of everything when he has the ball that doesnt happen
pad those stats hahahahaha
and the most overrated undefeated team is
what if some anomaly occurs and we score here
ohhhh is that lamar jackson but slower
just as rg3 started to play well too

fuck this season
all my homies hate goodell
hollywood is so ass
hollywood maybe dive or at least act like you want that one
hollywood cant even beat an olb
why is holywood getting beat and laughing
he really isnt allowed to complain about shit anymore if he cant beat a pass rusher in coverage
why start souljas if theyre not going to get results
that is bullshit that they could all lay on the player to run the clock
the refs have entered the chat
steelers always finding a way to cheat as always and getting away with it
that shitsburg game delay was dirty af
lets not forget that sorry te dropping that ball on his way down
thats almost as bad as tomlins trip fuck that bullshit
goodell reading a script
of course collinsworth is going to blame it on the timeout why cant we count on the refs to make the obvious call
fuck da commish

fuck da refs

and most importantly

fuck da steelers
this team is 100 ladies and gents
claypool epitomizes the wineyass steelers hands up after every play
jesus christ if we had lamar in there this game it would be a blow out right now
collinsworth steelers are thin on d they got tuitt out couldnt name another player

fuck you chris you fucking clown
they should start fining refs
chris collinsworth has such a great narrative voice too bad its used to spew bullshit most of the time
marquise is scared to get hit
so is forward progress not a thing for us cause they spotted that ball 3 yards back where watt dropped him
i saw a hold in the endzone thats a fucking safety
would love to see that block in the back
hate that our defense is trying so hard and the offense just cant
our qb is 610 with 25 yrds and a pick why is he still in the game
should be 1712 we shot our selves in the foot way too much
thats definitely a catch and fumble but good play by marlo
we all knew this would happen with no practicing but rnfl said you dont deserve to have your knees and health
omg a more grizzled queen picks that off for 6
i have good friends that are steelers fans that i make exceptions for but when i see random people with steelers gear i actually automatically assume i will not like that person on average i genuinely believe they have more scumbag tendencies than most people just the steelers no other team nor sport
youre not gonna fool us rapist
that nurses show looks god awful
i like harris that was very good coverage great speed turn high pointed the ball dude can play
i feel like if i was a steelers fan i would be very pissed that theyre not destroying us right now
how are the steelers undefeated
i cant believe we only have 5 passing yards
congrats to the great wr juju on scoring the steelers first offensive td of the game in the 4th quarter against half a ravens teams

loser bitch
ayyy theres our illegal formation call
we need you lamar
steelers busy talking shit to a team with 22 players on the covid list
that was a late hit
lol wtf are they punting makes zero sense
willson is a bum

but hey

its what happens when you get signed and gotta play after being on the couch for ages
i do really hope i never see another comment from fans on facebook about how lamar has been figured out and that trace mcsorley should be the starter moving forward
absolutely nobody gets the blame for this one we kept those yinzer fucks close until the 4th quarter with a practice squad we could kick their asses if we make the playoffs at full strength

fuck the steelers
i want no shit on lamar ever after this look at this offense
the ravens practice squad the jets
low key steelers losing to wft next week

i called this shit
i think its time for our rg3 experiment to end hes just too fragile
how the fuck is that the one they catch jesus fucking christ defense
how tf is this team 100
the fact its even this close shows steelers are overrated
lol the fans left fuck the steelers
have to focus on 115 now god i hate this season
honestly just fuming we stuck with bobby for three quarters
proud of our boys today
yeah steelers arent going far in the playoffsits december and they can hardly beat the ravens depleted d and backup qb cant play down to your competition in the playoffs
imagine the way all the calls have gone today and think the nfl is fucking against you
i hope that the cowboys bench andy dalton so that we all have the opportunity to witness the greatest matchup of all time

trace mcsorley vs ben dinucci
congratulations to the steelers for eking out a win to our practice squad
if chris collinsworth doesnt shut the fuck up
god i hope the chiefs smack the shit outta them in the playoffs
stay down you fucking rapist
stop the count im officially calling this ravens vs steelers game 13 min into the 1st quarter ravens have a decisive 76 lead over the steelers and have clearly won the game any other outcome will be fought extensively by rudy giuliani
tj watt looks like a qanon supporter
i hope this means the mcsorley memes are dead
ruling on the field stands we all saw it was like two inches short first down

wtf just happened
hawks fan here definitely think the flag showed the ball was short the ref must have called it 1st down so they could review it and then didnt overturn because there wasnt clear and obvious evidence absolute bogus sequence of events an you guys got robbed of a chance to make a miracle happen
how tf is this a first down
dont yall ever be ungrateful for lamar jackson again
from here on out marquise soulja brown will only be referred to as wr 15
hey steelers trolls

your team can barely beat a team with second and third stringers

doesnt matter if you guys are 110 or 011 you guys are suspect team
chiefs are bitch smacking the steelers in the playoffs if the steelers can even make it that far
dont ever wanna see another squealer fan talking about the the nfl is against them refs called shit their way all game
lol i have zero expectations today still will probably get mad and post a ton of hot takes
well its been a while since i have drank on a wednesday afternoon but here we go
captain fatfuck looking primo
tell me more about how lamar is overrated
well rgiii threw a touchdown
im so sorry for ever thinking one negative thought about lamar after these first drives
j hill has a lot to gain from balling out in this game i bet he is in the fucking zone
45 for 15 yards and an int them flacco numbers
stop the count
look at us padding the stats
pad those stats justin
if we win this game i truly believe it will be a turning point in our entire season like the chiefs last year
not related to play but the steelers coaches wearing the steelers logo gaiters all have visible breath fog coming through the fabric obviously its not thicklayered enough to meet covid requirements
really cant believe the nfl wanted the ravens to play a game with literally zero conditioning testssessions after like 10 days of forced inactivity
marlo playing with some fire after that titans game

somewhere dean pees must be smiling yeah thats my good ol bend but dont break defense
chiefs fan here guys rooting for yall hate to see so many injuries keep your heads up and gift us a steelers l please go ravens
i think we should put mcsorely in it cant get any worse rg3cant get a first down to save his life besides that fluke when they fumbled the punt
this may be the dumbest game ive watched in years
might as well put in trace who cares really
we arent running with gus anymore why do gro and harbaugh think rg3 can carry
dont blame the defense tbh offense is useless with roman and rg3
i think we need mcsorely to win this game if this drive fails hopefully harbs recognizes the need for a qb change and makes it during the half
the steelers are trash pisses me off we handed them a win last time and theyll win this game because rg3 shouldnt even be in the nfl
anytime i see a pic of lamar i get emotional cant wait to have him back
hollywood just got covered by a linebacker
hollywood was just covered by tj watt
hollywood was covered by a lb
i am literally over brown he can go not just too short hes also too soft too unskilled and too lazy

peace buy a fucking top 1015 receiver for lamar and draft another prospect this one aint it at all
steelers cant beat a team down 20 players and resorts to cheating lol
cheaters cheaters cheaters
im not going to blame the game on harbaugh for that call if we lose but that was not a good call you also gotta make that fucking catch i dont even care about the clock you gotta step up and make that play big play by minkah fuck
steelers are the dirtiest team in the nfl and they get away with everything im soo sick of it
bro i was so ready to go up 1412
hes literally reading a script hahaha
goodell looks like hes ready to molt
even against the ravens c team the steelers still gotta cheat and show the whole of america and the world that theyre scum

fuck the steelers
defense is fucking balling
those 15 yards do not make up for the 20 seconds we lost
not gonna lie rg3 is pouring his heart and soul into this game man wants one last hoorah and redemption under his name
thanks to covid we now get to see 3 te sets
i am proud of this defense good job boys
that rg3 picks six really hurtin us rn
the refs absolutely fucking hate us
i cant even be mad at this anymore its clear that with our real offense the steelers are nothing
steelers should send steve saunders a game ball
gonna take a defense score or special teams score to win
thats a catch fumble unfortunate
if that peters int was an actual int the other week that was a catch
fuck you nfl making these guys play without practice in 2 fucking weeks
this season can fuck off

why is it only ravens players getting injured too not that i want anyone to get hurt on either team but fuck me were taking hit after hit after hit when other teams seem to be immune
harris man proud of our dbs
33 has had some big plays today
give harris a starting job
once remind yall we playing with a practice squad and its a close game relax
yeah thats a face mask color me surprised on the no call
i feel like duvernay is a low key prodigy
chris collinsworth is gawking on steelers d more than mia khalifa in her entire porn career
geez imagine being as annoying as that screaming bitch
trace mcjackson
wow our 75th string te sucks
this is pretty good proof that lamar is making the offense function at even a respectable level
what a fucking joke how do you not pick that off clark
us and allowing 3rd down completed passes name a better duo
lol ravens should be winning rn
defense always crumbles in dumbest way possible
yea chris theyll be telling their grandchildren about how they got their ass whooped by the practice squad but managed to barely squeak out a win lol
trace should have started this game
steelers look pretty weak from an outside perspective
this is a bullshit spot he was short
did they just give the game to the steelers clearly short on live the spot was short too
heheekwkekwdkdk steelers jsidiekwosl the karens
fuck steve saunders
congrats steelers on beating a team of fourth stringers and recovering covid patients
refs fucked you guys over that was short
bro imagine being a steelers fan coming in to this game sub and trolling us when they beat our practice squad by five points lmfao they are getting bounced in the first round its not even funny
so aggravating to see a team struggle as much as it has be 110 in our division
step 1 complain all week about proravens bias
step 2 literally cheat ingame
step 3 profit
imagine getting hyped about barely beating 4th stringers lmfaooo steelers got exposed if you ask me
shouldve started trace at halftime tbh dudes the definition of a second half player especially when his team is losing
pittsburgh celebrating like they won the super bowl after barely scraping by a team that pulled a third of their roster off the couch is pretty incredible especially considering they very well couldve been clawing back down 2119 late in the fourth had they not laid on the dead ball going into the half

so much for padding the stats tuitt what a scumbag that guy is
how is that not delay of game wtfff
never want to hear shit from steelers fans ever again about favoritism
they literally were holding gus on the ground for 10 seconds after he was called down we really have been getting screwed by the refs all year and the numbers back it up
bitch ass motherfuckers blaming the players for getting hurt after having no practice

what kind of fans are you delusional fuckwits
i am once again asking for greg roman to be fired
dont forget the refs fucked us out of 7 at the end of half
im proud of this team

mcsorley had some juice

fuck shittsburgh and fuck the referees that was short by a foot
not a fan of either team but wow ravens got hosed the entire game the ball looked to be short too and they called it a 1st wow
the 110 team really needed the refs to beat a practice squad
i was hoping for a wednesday night football logo and intro im a little mad
the last time the ravens won a game as double digit underdogs they beat the steelers with recently signed ryan mallett under center for the injured joe flacco
do the guys celebrating know that theyre essentially playing a practice squad
defense came to play lets make a drive
i am once again reminding you guys that i really fucking hate the steelers
idc how many yards rg3 or trace throw for lamar is playing next game
they dont call holding when its against us nothing new
adrenaline is a bitch id run it out too haha
come on man stay in the damn end zone
damn you can tell the ravens really want this w
good ben you stupid fat fuck i love it
ok i said i came for rg3 but im staying for trace
this is going to get ugly fast
is rg3 slow now or are we just so used to jacksons speed
yea i dont think rg3 has ever been good for us dude is a solid mentor for lamar but back up qb not so much
bench rg3 holy shit
this game is like golf im extremely emotionally invested and end up having a bad time but it beats working
i want that p6 back
beep beep motherfucker
i dont think steelers are padding the stats they intended to
ravens have the lead who would have believed it
76 can we stop the game here
just a reminder that we were on the verge of blowing the steelers out last game if it wasnt for the turnovers
were not playing terrible defense dont give up so fast
ebron getting away with all these holds and blocks in the back
great a fucking injury fest now man this season is an unbelievable nightmare
madden curse has plagued the whole team
the only people left on the ravens sub is true ravens fans and im pretty grateful
jimmy is so talented but has the bones of a 70 year old it seems
somebody get jimmy a healthy body for christmas finally
bend but dont break
just glad were putting up a fight
hollywood is such a coward will never put his head down and leaves yards on the field
rgiii needs to get the ball out quicker
they get to smash him while hes on the ground
honestly lets start trace
im gonna lose my fucking mind if we keep playing 5 yards off
is there any better feeling than watching ben get smoked didnt think so
wtf is the difference between getting beat once and letting them just get 10 yards of space on every play
fuck you ebron bum ass mf hahahahahaha
steelers high key scared out there lmao
i guess tuitt meant pad boswells stats huh
put in mcsorely for the heck of it
i swear if they dont put in mcsorley im going down to mcdonalds to punch roman in the face
marlon is balling the fuck out and our redzone defense is playing out of their minds we need to give them some rest
now lets put mcsorely in and win this fucking game
if we can somehow make the playoffs we will fucking curbstomp this steelers team at full strength
dear lord pull rg3
we get it pittsburgh are refined football fans and we are a bunch of thugs tale as old as time
harbaugh needs to go smack roman upside his head and just walk away
rg3 finally does good and injures himself as he gets going
i thought rg3 was gonna start high stepping hope its not serious but we have nothing to lose
next man up jeez
you fuckers said mcsorely smh
i want mcsorely but not like this
i feel bad for him man hes had it rough today but when has he gotten the time hes definitely not what he used to be but you can tell hes putting in the effort

sucks that he got injured way back
dude fuck hollywood
hollywood could have dove and caught that but hes a fucking pussy i almost forgot
goddamn marquis jump for that
how can you not make a move on tj watt jesus
hill is playing with a chip on his shoulder
how the fuck was that not delay of game
call delay of game on pittsburgh
fucking bullshiiittttt damn steelers just laying there not letting us ge up
that was both poor time management and steelers bs
i like the risk there we shouldnt be in this game
i like the aggressiveness but that has to be a delay of game
we are at 0 penalties for the steelers by the way
wow terrible the refs have to call delay harbaugh has to hold the to willson has to catch that

the worst part of that in a close game is the momentum transfer that gives the steelers if you walk into halftime down 1210 you won the half you have the steelers wondering whats happening
we may not get another drive that good clock management was fucking garbage
awful clock management this half youd have 3 timeouts if you got on the same fucking page
our coaches shouldve known better than run the ball with no timeouts weve seen that kind of slow down thats on the coaches shouldve taken a couple of throws and ran on 4th down if needed
where was the delay of game
refs fucking us aside he needed to catch that ball
i miss mandrews
screw the announcers
seriously i cannot believe they let a player lay there motionless with no obstruction for a good 5 or 6 seconds unreal
as terrible as an ending it was wilson gotta catch that damn ball i loved the play call just piss poor execution

also fuck the refs 18 seconds to uncover that pileup and run a play while everybody was already at line of scrimmage ready to snap the ball
this is such a 2008 ravens steelers game
pad the stats
tramon is great urodgerstojordy
love it when rules analysts talk about how penalties shouldve been called against the other team but never are
yea thanks for that 30 min later
nothing like third party validation youre getting screwed i dont know if it makes me feel better or worse
make up call for the missed delay of game
that was not a fucking hold jesus christ
our third string center is really hitting these snaps
another drive killed by a mystery penalty
theyre 10 yards off of dez
i dont really agree with that hold call refs are terrible and it will lose us this already impossible to win game i get it theyre making bad calls for both sides
sad thing is greg roman will never get fired by harbaugh
ravens have to do everything in their power to get allen robinson please somebody save him
how tf does ben have a fat fucking face but a slim body dont make no sense lol
get the fuck off the field
god wed be crushing this team if we had our starters
defense is having an impressive performance i was worried theyd be tired out by this point
if we had our starting offence we would be winning this game
you gotta give our guys credit theyre busting their balls only so much you can do though with the guys out
im fully convinced the refs are paid to fuck us
first down play rg3 unloads it down field to dez lets do it no one will see it coming
is a miracle that weve kept this a one score game this far fucking heart of playing like a raven tonight
this feels like 2015 ravens and i gotta say i dont miss it
looks like a fumble and of course it goes out of bounds
and another 10 min commercial break
this game has restored a good amount of my respect for us this season you can tell weve still got a lot of fire despite everything weve gone through
even in real time that is clearly a catch these refs are so bad
when they said pad the stats i didnt think they meant in successful challenges
i dont know about yall but ive been hating the steelers for almost two decades and juju has to be the receiver im the least afraid of in their history ward holmes abhated them and feared them juju ive never feared him once since he came into the league
man were fighting really hard respect
remember everyone bitching when the ravens are concerned no practice would cause injuries
our d is done and rightfully so nothing against them
who is harris
o thank god harris
niiiice harris
we were gonna beat their ass with full team man they are bad
this is the time of the game when if youre not up on them by 20 the steeler cancer starts to work into your system and i dont feel so good
if we tackled better we would be 82

how is that not a facemask
we win this game with a full roster thats the most disappointing part to me
great effort cant expect more with how many backups
squeeler bitches in here downvoting lol imagine playing a practice squad and still being salty af and coming in here hahaha
collinsworth has no context in what he talks about he has no feel for whats happening in the game in how it got there he can only comment through random facts and player hype that has nothing to do with the current moment
if it aint a perfect throw marquise aint catching it
keeping rg3 in the game when hes hurt seems familiar
well at least we can look forward to the steelers getting schooled by the chiefs this just aint our year with covid and injuries and roman needs to go
why are we punting went from a 1 chance of winning to 0 fantastic
listen to those fat gross yinzer screams
here we gotrace szn
minkah is such a bitch way to talk smack to trace lmao like wtf ok dude calm down there
fitzpatrick talking shit to a 3rd string qb
marquise is trash
i almost feel a little bad for the guy that dropped 25k on dez getting 25 yards today
82 is so fucking bad holy shit has he caught a pass
i dont give a shit if its 4th and 20

if you want to win the game you gotta go for it
i dont know if i feel encouraged by this defensive performance or not

i think if we had our actual offense we win this game
has marquise brown always been this much of a bitch i cant recall ever seeing any fight in him
wtf is collinsworth on he has no clue too many concussions you can argue lamar holds the ball too long for receivers to get open you can not argue he runs too much
trace brought a lil excitement not bad
honestly luke willson has been one of the very few disappointments on the field today mostly everyone has been playing their hearts out given the situation but willson jeez these drops have been crucial in a game no one who was giving the ravens a chance not holding on to the football at the end of the first half even if the play was in the moment completely derailed any shot the ravens had of upsetting the steelers he might have been solid as a blocker this afternoon but as the 1 te on this day this is now his second drop that he should have had

long story short nick boyle cant be replaced and obviously the ravens need mark andrews out there
oh yes

lets finally acknowledge how shit their schedule has been
yall bitched for almost 3 and 34 quarters of football before that touchdown just dont forget
this game has no business being this close
lol trace memes gonna continue for 2 more years cause of that one throw
so fucking lucky
fuck me the delay of game non call looms very very large i hate when that shit plays a factor
the defense has done this so many times this season

play solid all game but when its late and they need a stop its a stone cold failure
this game is more a testament to how shit the steelers played than anything if we had even half the sick players back we won this steelers can go 160 they wont do fuck all in the playoffs
collonsworth is so punchable
bro i swear the steelers are so trash idc of we win or lose the steelers should know they are so fucking trash over rated questionable calls dirty play they have to have everything go their way let them go 160 this season and get booped first game hope they all cry themselves to sleep
collinsworth making beating a ps team super impressive lmfaooooo
why is collinsworth crazy about that catch yes it was important but it was cleanly caught and nobody else had a play on it
im a little disappointed in coaching and luke wilson but this team played good for what it had today
its over but that was not a first down lol
congrats on the win steelers unfortunately our practice squad couldnt practice for two weeks for the game today its very obvious you guys are the best team in the nfl being undefeated the chiefs are shaking in their boots
cant believe people r calling this team a contender steelers will fold come playoff time
lets see what roman has cooked up for this drive cant wait
clearly short steelers win off the benefit of refball
yeah really tough for tomlin to coach the steelers to a 5 point drag out win against no more than half of the ravens starters chris real tough
didnt exactly pad the stats there did they
steeers be pretending
pad the stats 2020
if you remove the illegal rg3 pick we still winning
that is fucking horrific by the refs might as well go home now say what you want about the clock management aspect you cant just lie on people for 20 seconds
i am once again reminding my brethren that i really fucking hate the steelers and the refs
phins fan from central pa here fuck the fucking steelers and their dirty ass team and whiny fucking fans literally shoved the guy to the bottom of the pile and sat in him for 30 secs but get the benefit of the doubt bc theyre the leagues darlings every steelers fan acts like the league is out to get them and everyone underrates them maybe you wouldnt be underrated if you didnt have a cupcake fucking schedule i seriously cannot wait to see them get clapped in the divisional round its like the pats they benefit from everything but still act like persecuted underdogs clemson does the same thing and fuck them too phins up fuck the steelers have fun with no good qb after ben retires
if theres one thing chiefs fans and ravens fans can agree on its fuck the steelers
worst 100 team in history


wed be destroying them with our starters in
that dumb bitch yelling squealing and chanting here we go steelers is probably very musty
we got fucked at the end of both halves
i cant believe that team is undefeated they could barely beat a team decimated by injuries and covid led by rg3 and trace mcsorley
i hope rg3 can step it up i hate the steelers
drive that bitch into the ground
welp i guess that shouldnt be surprising
a hold for 5 seconds is called on us but completely turning around us isnt cool
awesome play but why run it out
i have no idea why you would run that out of the end zone but fuck it lets get wild tonight
shouldve went down in the end zone but i get it hes trying to make a play
bowser kneel in the end zone moron good pick tho
time to put in sam koch
rg6
everyone knows what that means
throwin on a dime
rg3 is a good mentor hes not a good player anymore anyone thinking otherwise is fucking delusional
ill be surprised if the ravens get a single first down in this game lol
sam koch has more offensive yards than anyone else will this game
i have no idea who our tight ends are lol
fluker runs 5 yards for the first time all season and he injures himself figures
coloncastillo is lowkey nice glad to see him get some realgame reps
say it with me gus the motherfucking bus
stop the game
chiefs fan coming in peace love our gif wars with you guys and obviously we need the steelers to lose as well lets go fuck the steelers
ravens practice squad 7 undefeated steelers 6
hey yinzers we have a kicker
someone screenshot that guys post in case we win i already forgot his name
so should we just start punting on 1st down to get the ball down the field
stop the count

for the love of god please stop it
justin tucker turns me on
why does the defense look better than it has all year while were missing our whole dline
why are the corners playing so far off pitt does quick throws 247
i wish the ravens could design plays like that just a rb and te pick play quick pass designing players to get open

gr deserves some credit for that rg3 sweep right tho
this kinda reminds me of those kyle boller years where the defense or st had to score or make all the plays
need a pick six by bowser
we are living in the darkest possible timeline
nfl does not care about player safety at all
so ebron is gonna have the game of his life and not drop anything huh
we want mcsorely
bring in trace
lets see trace a good ol wild card is what this game needs
this game feels over despite the current score
havent had a peters pick in a while
marcus peters has been really sus the last few games
i dont know who 29 is but i appreciate his hustle
bend dont break
this team is 100
chuck had that covered even if he caught it
ebron is a drop machine please sign him longterm pittsburgh
these red zone stops are clutch keeping us in this game now lets see just a hint of offense
i gotta do something here d is bending but not breaking yet
all that crying on twitter only to drop an easy redzone pass lmaoooo
the steelers might have to send saunders a ring if they go undefeated cuz we would have curb stomped them at full strength
for all the shit these tik tok bitches were talking the sure look like fucking punks out there right now
we need a qb who can drop dimes without even tryin
see what trace can do what are we worried that rg3 is going to get upset
collinsworth good and misogynistic there
the audio seems jacked up i hear the fake crowd noise better than the announcers
it took them that long to count 12 men
fuck
hopefully its only a cramp from that other run
yo gotta be fucking kidding me
just as he was getting into a groove fuck this
are we about to see traces first career td
is huntley active this game you know if trace gets hurt
just a kid from bryerwood hes wearing number 9
rg3 still on thats good to see
they put on a new foot and hes back
hollywood just sticks his arm out
cmon soulja
lay out hollywood
brown fucking sucks
how does brown not burn this fuck wtf
holly is scared to get hit
marquise that is his name
marquise ran in the lowest possible gear while being covered by a de
hollywood is a bum
marquise really getting clamped by pass rushers lol
this is bullshit
how the fuck is that not a flag
surprised tomlin didnt go out and cuddle on the field right there
looking for the refs brains

last seen being paid by the steelers
the refs really hate the ravens for messing with their wednesday plans
the clock shouldve been stopped or they shouldve added time back on their defense intentionally took their sweet ass time and we couldnt get set this is fucking crooked
lol i didnt know you could just hold people on the ground
ok but can someone tell me how that first run wasnt a td he was down but the ball was touching the plank so doesnt that make it a td and then to have the refs fuck yall over right after
roger just looks like a bitch you know in the movies where there is that one guy who looks like a straight bitch youre not supposed to trust and know hes a rat but you trust him either way thats roger
goddell reading his answers
your protocols are not working
can we get a replay on that first run looked like a touchdown
have you considered shortening the season

lol no we like money too much

but what about player safety

what exactly has this league ever done to make you think we would consider that
the year is 2030 tom brady is still playing in the nfl and patrick mahomes has won 6 super bowls although there are only 30 teams in the nfl cause there are still steeler players on top of gus edwards
bad officials or not who expected this team to be behind by just one score at the half the redzone defense is here today
i was fully prepared for the ravens to hurt my feelings today but boy did that last play sting
eat shit squeelers
steelers have a very very good chance of going undefeated and still not being very good

i realize as a ravens fan that comment can just be written off as sour grapes but im not sure theres ever been a team this weak still undefeated at this point in the season i think the chiefs would absolutely ruin them
didnt expect to actually get this invested in the makeshift squad but here we are
how tf are we still in this game lol
only team that holds
where was the hold
these refs can go fuck themselves
hollywood looking like a kid out there
thats holding

good god
is one game without a penalty too much to ask for lol
gro please go away im tired
im simply amazed how the refs help the steelers every single time
b o y weve left a bunch of points on the field in a 127 game
3rd and 13 in field goal range

roman better option with the smallest rb we have
humphrey always plays 10 yards off the receiver and its so frustrating
wolfe has been pluggin the middle all game ive been sleeping on him
imagine if we had an mvp qb out there
get the fuck off the field you overrated fucks
how many kick and punt returns dont actually have an illegal block in the back called on them
we are going to need a pick six or something to score
how does no one account for their best pass rusher lol
im feeling a juiceman pick 6 today
throw the ball
does anyone think roman wouldnt be calling the same plays with lamar in there i bet he would hes so trash
we need to start a drive by chucking a deep ball and hoping for pi thats the only way we will ever make it down the field
oh man am i excited for the titans to remind the browns that theyre the browns
def a fumble but these shit refs will prob let it stand
thats definitely a catch

we went through this w marcus peters int if thats a catch this is also a catch
refs the call on the field is overturned touchdown steelers
you know were in their heads defensively when they challenge for 5 yards
claypool was laughing can only beat a practice squad team with the refs
harris said fuck your double move
lets goooo no idea who that is but credit to him
harris came out of nowhere great signing so far
we need a turnover bad
why are we keeping roman around he has been awful since week 2 lol
if you had told me the score would be 127 pitt going into the 4th id have said well yeah cause fuck the steelers
gotta gulive our d credit for missing a lot of guys and playing with no practices they are putting in some good work today
i need a list of our players with their numbers so i know who these postal workers are
i really feel like our d should just get us a pick 6
yall are doing everything else
how is that not facemask
why is that not an offensive face mask it would be called on defense
get rg3 out least we can have a chance
give the d credit they were on the field for 25 minutes before they gave up their first td
can we finally put in sam koch so we can get a passing game going
btw are you allowed to tackle around the neck thats a genuine question btw noticed the steelers do it quite a lot and i imagine its hard not too
leading the league in illegal formation smh coaches wanna teach these guy something or what
at what point do we fake that with the most accurate thrower of all time
man claypool is genuinely unlikeable
collinsworth is unbearable
donnie from dundalk is super happy right now hes been waiting two years for this
trace mcsorley throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin just a kid from bryerwood to wearin number 9 met coach franklin down at vandy flipped to happy valley now im coming back and got the natty on my mind they cant touch my deep ball every game im scorin
i dont think it matters who plays qb when roman is calling the plays
pittsburgh is the luckiest 110 team ever
dang pretty big hit mcsorley took at the end of that play
dj flukers time in the nfl should be over after this season
karma for being a bitch minkah
brown is so fucking garbage
dump marquise brown dude doesnt even try

edit ill own this one
guy has no chemistry with team at the end of the day almost back yard ball at this point
trace got into minkahs head elite
lmao brown looked dejected on the sideline you deserve it bro
never seen a team punt with only 5 minutes left down 2 scores
anyone complaining about third and fourth stringers not doing shit or playing bad is a fucking idiot
if we make the playoffs let us play the steelers
holy shit what the hell do you guys expect a 3rd stringer to do when coming in the end of a game against a top defense
without the 15 players if we just had lamar today were winning no doubt mvp

oline was actually better today than recent weeks same receiving corp this is the same offense lamar uses to break the consecutive 20 point game record that only got broken because of a fucking monsoon which by the way he still dropped 17 that game remember that when yall criticize him

we need to stop asking what more can lamar do for us we need to start asking what more can the team do for lamar
put koch in you cowards
soulja sighting
throw it on a dime

like i aint even trying
regardless how this game ends im proud ofnour boys playing broken as fuck defense playing lights out 10 practice squad boys promoted glad we got to see mcsorley make a play since we didnt have a pre season overall a hard hitting close nail biter like usual go ravens and fuck the cheating steelers we should be winning right now fuckin losers
aaah well that sucks haha
man i wish those forced fumbles would not have gone out of bounds nice stat padding though
why si tyus covering a wwr
if the defense werent on the field for 99 of this half
holding man
well we lost boys but it was definitely fun got to see mcsorley throw a td back at it next week with lamar were still in the wildcard hunt truzz
what ive learned today the steelers are overrated
shit rigged lmao
steelers suck barley beat the practice squad
cant wait to see them get btfo in the first round of the playoffs
was really hoping for one more trace drive too thanks refs
feel better after this game than before pittsburgh needed every fucking inch to beat a group of practice squad guys who hadnt practiced in weeks make the playoffs win the wild card and go take them on in pittsburgh full strength boys
i want buffalo or steelers in playoffs imo we match nicely ifwhen we get in
that was completely on the refs but why not spike
the clock management was awful but the refs really need to be punished for letting shittsburgh lay on the ball for that long

no excuses
that drive was fucking hype though
there you go shitfuck steelers it should have been a foul
absurd we should be up 1312
i dont wanna hear one more person bitch about how the nfl favors the ravens after this game
can nbc stop sucking jujus cock
steelers are some bs

that spot was short
big ben rapes women
lions fan yall got screwed by the refs i know what it feels like
worst 100 team ever
call them out for just laying there a joke
i cant wait to see patty mahomes drop a 50 on this undefeated steelers at least the last year we were spectacular in regular season the steelers now are just lucky and will get exposed in the playoffs even more than we did
even the nfl knows they screwed us
luke wilson fucking blows
congratulations to mike tomlin and the steelers for having yet another game handed to them by the refs
screen said 4th and inches im not a fan of either team but that looked sketchy cmon refs
if you werent with us when we go 65 dont be with us when we go 142 lets get it
nobody got injured on that drive lets go
this legit feels like its just some preseason scrimmage
5 yard opening drives for both teams lol
oh no the tiktok squad how scary
haha fools you target the one area of out team that isnt destroyed with covid
only good news is our secondary is basically completely healthy lets go
flags against the ravens count1
im gonna blame that on the lack of practice in 2 weeks
notsurprisedpikachujpg
all i can say to that fumble is wow
our offense doesnt deserve our defense
pay da man
shoulda taken a knee but fuck the steelers
pay bowser yesterday
king koopa again
shouldve taken the touchback but tbh i aint made at that
who da fuck is coaching these guys fall down tyus holy hell

edit good play though overall
bowser judon
bowser
not to be picky had he knelt would we be at the 20 yardline
tyus was tryna get a td for the offense guys they need it come on
put in mcsorely fuck it
this game is gonna be a stat padder for the steelers d
just use mcsorley fuck it
rg3 two drives two turnovers now who is he yelling at on the sidelines
alright ive seen enough of rg3 lets see what mcsorely has
three drives in and i think its already mcsorely time lets give him the chance
i cant believe i actually thought we had a chance
is mcsorley active
ya i think rg3 is gone after this year
the worst part about a pick six is immediately having to suffer again
lmao how are you going to jump around and celebrate like a doofus for stopping a kick return at the 33 yard line
i hate pittsburgh with such a burning passion
fluker gets flagged every game even in madden
this fake crowd noise is really annoying
what the hell is the game
why the fuck do they have the crowd noise louder than the commentators its so annoying
great fuckin playcall right there defense got caught sleeping
pad those stats squeelers
colon castillo skura
lets fucking go gus bus
boy castillo fucked that d lineman up
think we found our new center
and just like that the squealers are already squealing
better call the game now for safety
mind you this team hasnt even practiced
forfeit the game steelers clearly some of your players caught something
for once in my life i can understand what trump was thinking stopthecount
fuck it put wink in at dl
god ben is the most scared qb this year
the guys are playing real hard
as a redskins fan who has watched rg3 since his rookie year wow how a career can change
everything is fine

fucking kill me now
fucking light ebron up put him in the fucking dirt
i googled tramon williams age and he really is 37 lmfao thats sad how far our depth has fallen smh
looks like hump needed the break looks so much better even though they havent practiced in 10 days
they fucking bucked us lmao
brown has caught more catches today than in what 4 games now
please end the rg3 experiment man cmon
trace time
some guy put a huuuge bet on dez getting 25 receiving yards with rg3 in he might get none lol
i miss lamar
i feel like romans offense has like 3 plays
repeat after me rg3 is only a mentor not a player


give trace a try
the steelers have 3 receivers that would be our 1
need a humphrey one punch like right now
rg3 cant drive and offense 75 yards not gonna happen he really cant see the field
i would actually be confident in this game if rg3 werent so washed right now
damn tramon mind you hes almost 40 years old lmao
peters cant cover like a normal person for one play
i made myself throw up so i could leave work to watch this shit show
i would like to log my request for trace mcsorely next drive
yall complaining about peters giving up that pass he was 1on1 with claypool if he gets beat over the top its a td
get that outta here
trace time
tell them hump
ive seen peters smack derrick henry in the playoffs he does not lack heart lol
beautiful footwork from marlon on the washington incompletion looked like he was on a basketball court
what a trash 100 team
fuck it put wink as the oc too mans a genius
this redzone d kinda turning me on
its happening our receivers have infected the steelers receivers
twitter finger steelers cant catch the ball cause theyve been too busy typing
lets fucking put together a drive here boys please
give mcsorely a shot man we need more young talent rgiii is way past his expiration date that man cant redeem himself this game
rgiii to hollywood for a bomb please
lamar is closer to mahomes level than rg3 is to lamar
finally a chance for dez to catch a ball today and he just straight up trips over his own feet while the balls on its way damn
the confidence on that run looked like old school rg3
holy shit rgiii looking like lamar out there
oh shit lamar threw on the rg3 jersey
holy shit rgiii got his orthopedics on
a penalty not on us
fuck did he tear something
rgiiis legs have not been kind to him
bro dez is going to be qb by the fourth quarter
we had a rg run followed by a rg pulled hammy
this is suboptimal
that 40 yarder was too much on him
that hurts so bad to see right as he starts to look comfortable fuck man you gotta feel for the guy wow
trace mcsorely about to put the league on notice
oh man can you imagine being mcsorely right now its your time to shine or blow out like a candle id be so nervous
this half of a game is a summary of our whole season so far
thats what happens when you cant practice for a week but nfl forces you to play a game hammies are gonna go
he was looking so good
phew he back in
trace god dammit do it boy stunt on these hoes only hope rn lets go
edit nvm sit down
our receivers are so underwhelming they rarely make something happen they only catch the easiest of passes and get tackled immediately every time
i feel like that was on target enough for someone who thinks themselves to be a wr1
i swear to god hollywood is the worst route runner in the league he keeps running up the sideline and getting pinned against it like its a wall
he should have laid out for that one
cant believe we wasted a first round pick on this bumass soujia
hollywood more like east la am i right fellas
marquise brown is not good
i hate colinsworth
loving the fucking heart today win or lose this team is back
this is fucking terrible
thats legit horseshit
fuck off nfl that was weak as fuck
how was that not flagged wtf
wow the refs just let them sit on us
fuuuuuck

how was that not a delay of game just take a nap on top of the pile make them drag you off the field if they want to run a play
fuck you steelers that was some bullshit
absolutely a delay of game
should have just spiked and took the points you would feel a lot better with the field goal
bro the play calling there needed to be in reverse and also we should have spiked and kick we need every point we can get
maybe spike it and regroup for a play but im 100 on board with going for a td there instead of a fg given the situation of this game
that fatass was on the ground like nate robinson bruh how they not gonna call delay
if that ball was caught we wouldnt be complaining about time management obviously that bs non call delay of game probably screwed up the plan
goodell looks like a penis
isnt awesome how the announcers pretty much glossed over that obvious bullshit
ok so rg3 took the timeout wtf
i agree hill scored on that play and that was delay of game clearly
this offense is gonna make lamar look like prime tom brady when he comes back next week
it is what it is but

x200b



other delay of game fouls

article 5

other examples of action or inaction that are to be construed as delay of the game include but are not limited to the following

a a player unnecessarily remains on a dead ball or on a runner who has been downed
ever since john freaked out at the refs with no mask theyve literally havent stopped screwing us over
steelers are trash
this is the worst 100 team ever
man the defense is trying like hell ill give em that got some fire
if our offense cant get going everyone will turn on the defense by the end of the game but you cant blame them theyre gonna be gassed
i live 40 min away from pitt hope yall win
skol vikings
thanks terry
lamarg3
weak ass call fuck roughing the passer
the qb runs are wide open if we had lamar hed have 150 yards rushing today
thats a makeup call
yeah thats weak as shit let qbs get hit
no matter how the rest of this game goes i am more proud of this team today then i even possibly imagined
if we win it will be the most satisfying dub since the super bowl imo dead serious between the obvious cheating crying over a delayed game and that pussy defensive end tweeting before the game id love it
the refs really dont know how to feel about steelers falling down
thats a pancake not a hold
effort for once from our soulja
how can you call holding on an inside run play you fucking idiots just fuck off
brown go up field holy crap
its not gonna work every single time greg
special teams balling out
a draw on 3 and 10
what a stupid fucking play call
dammit offense we need you to score
what the fuck is that spot they spotted it where he was dragged back 3 yards
hollywood put on all that muscle to still be afraid of ever player on the field
greg romans situational playcalling is just

we
defense td please man
greg roman is exhausting seriously
put ed reed in we need to score
big time chance to swing this game defense needs a turnover

marlo and yannick need to step up while we have them pinned
would love a juiceman pick 6 here
i cant blame greg roman for any of his play calls his qb is dogshit and his line is made up of practice squad players also weve converted like 5 3rd and longs by running
i would lay on them after every run for 20 seconds
rgiii wentz
we need a marlo punch right about now
lets go marcus
the worst part about this is if we somehow pull this off the steelers fans are just going to say they got screwed by the game getting pushed back
how is the crowd annoying and nobody is there
the bad penalties are the only thing consistent about our team this year
this game is an absolute roller coaster of emotions i love how competitive we are right now
fuck it im suiting up

put me in at wr get my man rg3 some help
making a statement lolololol

they are getting demolished by our practice squad
watt was in the neutral zone again but whatever
lol how is tj watt the only man unblocked how
greg roman doesnt know what slants are
why not throw the ball deep and see if we get a catch or a call just stupid
defense has to score their own touchdown at this point
lets keep talking up the defense playing the guys who could barely field s team

wtf
scheme up something for dez lets get a slant to hollywood maybe a rare boykin sighting take a fucking chance guys fuck
this defense will die in the fourth quarter
marlo has this punch shit down
marlon is so fucking good
i think it should be overturned but its close so i would love for them to lose a timeout
eh i think its a catch and fumble juju and fumbling name a more iconic duo
left tackle uncalled false start
punch
thats a catch and a fumble he had like 4 steps he tucked the bal land turned up field
nbc is the worst they run the most commercials of any network ive watched a football game on it seems like any chance they get they run a commercial break
that was totally a catch
jfc

i hate these injuries more than i hate the steelers
our only healthy group is getting decimated now lol
they dont care about the health of the players not practicing they just need money
remember miles boykin
who was that more of that guy
ik we are most likely going to lose but the defense is fucking balling tonight
can we see trace
all thing considering im so proud of this teamthey are fighting their hearts out right now
if you said it would be a one score game at the end of the 3rd id think you were lying

what a game
5 total passing yards
we held a 100 team within a td with like 10 starters out for 3 quarters i think weve done all we couldve expected
kc will slaughter them
i dont get it g ro is acting like rg3 cant throw a ball at least give him a chance he be did used to be a really good qb at one point in this league
i have only been a ravens fan for a few years but i really hate the steelers now this whole thing and they just seem like the whiniest fan base and players
soulja making no plays
have we gotten a first down after a passing play today doesnt feel like it
greg roman is making rg3s life extremely difficult right now

run on 1st down throw on 2nd and long against this front
defense just gave up a td is gassed and hurt

we gotta go for it there
chase claypool is such a cocky little bitch fuckin hate him
was that a fucking vulture tf was that noise lmao
what was that sinful noise
the steelers offense turned into the old pats offense

boring ass dink and dunk garbage
i wish the refs would just go down to the field and actually start jerking off juju you know they want to
throwin dimes
mcsorely time
put in trace mscorely literally suck my dick
this is just awful to watch i see no adjustments on the offensive side of the ball because of the situation where is the screens the slants quick throws we are waiting far too long to throw the darn ball at this point and rg3 is getting killed

roman needs to be fired for lack of adjusting a gameplan after he said he was doing that ffs
how does minka work back to the pass harder than 15
sam koch for qb next drive lmao
why the surrender punt smh
punt what
punt damn we are really just giving up
someone replaced luke wilsons hands with bricks
honestly have a better chance of scoring with the defense than the offense
marquise brown cant even catch covid when almost all the starters got it how do we expect him to catch a football
everyone saying luke willson sucks but his blocking has been huge today he could basically be nick boyle for us
even though its an l im still proud of us for competing against the best team with a literal practice squad
i take back my brown slander but im still not calling him hollywood
marquise marquise brown
hollywood did something lfggggg
now thats a fucking soulja play
guess we found our bona fide qb2 i like it
sight for sorley eyes amirite
literally threw it on a dime
trace mcsorley throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin just a kid from bryerwood to wearin number 9 met coach franklin down at vandy flipped to happy valley now im coming back and got the natty on my mind they cant touch my deep ball every game im scorin
thats game unfortunately ugh they played with so much heart super proud of this team right now
well boys it was a good effort from our practice squad
leave greg roman in shittsburg
wtf that was short
if it wasnt for ending empty handed in the last drive of the first half
gotta love refball lmao this is trash
how tf was that a first down there is clearly space between the marker and ball glad the refs could finish us off
they cant have the undefeated steelers lose to a bunch of backups lets be real
its a tough sequence for pittsburgh eat a fucking dick they got handed a win against our practice squad
got home from work to catch the last quarter wish i didnt cause now im just mad fuck the steelers
juju will forever be a bitch
haha fuck you pittsburgh
100 everyone
what if trace mcsorely is the next tom brady just waiting to get a chance to play
thats some dirty football jeez
shades of lee evans in the 2011 playoffs against the patriots both of those passes should have been held onto poor efforthands also fuck the refs for letting the steelers waste 15 seconds of clock literally laying down on the field holding our player down so he couldnt get up some serious bullshit
so i guess laying on the fucking players for 20 seconds limp isnt a penalty but the ravens are getting favored though wtf kinda bullshit is this
pad the stats now involves field goals drops and cheap tactics

and fuck off with huge mistake

how the fuck are we supposed to predict gus would be slept on for 20 whole seconds with not a damn thing to prevent it
why do we always run on 3rd and long smfh
im a dolphins fan and that is a bullshit spot

refs really helped the steelers beat our practice squad wow not the only bad call all day but the final play of the game they measured with the sticks and the ball is clearly short of the first down where the chains are extended out how do they call it a first down even with the bad spot it still was short and they said it was a first down anyway it literally makes no sense
i am not crazy right they literally spotted the ball and then showed that it was short from their own marker and then out of nowhere it just says it was a first down and they are kneeling
you know what marquise is gonna do tonight after another horrible game go play madden and only throw it to himself and pretend hes a top 3 receiver in the league
now i think we can officially stop the lamar speak what he manages to do with this offensw is nothing short of a miracle week in and week out
it took the 100 steelers refs cheating and our practice squad to win be proud of our boys today
marlon is jujus father
steelers have to be the worst 100 of all time
18 fucking seconds and the refs did nothing
the steelers are fucking cheaters wtf
harbaugh is so bad at clock management
how the fuck do the steelers just get to lay on gus for 20 seconds
terrible reffing good lord
the nfl bent over backwards for us
juju celebrating beating a 37 year old db lmfaooooo
bro you scored the first offensive touchdown against a practice squad

in the 4th

sit yo ass down

well hats off to the worst 100 team in history barley squeezed by our practice squad
im not mad we stood up
we got donkey dicked by the refs at the end there but fuck it our 80 dead covid slaughtered team barely lost by 5 if not for that end of first half fuckery we win 2119 theyre undefeated and fucking barely beat up on scrubs fuck them


trace looked ok maybe he isnt going to be the next tom brady or whoever but he can be serviceable with a nondogshit offense
rg3 aka the steelers killer bouta fuck em up
who had wednesday afternoon football against an undefeated steelers football team on their 2020 bingo card
lol the thanksgiving commercials finally getting played today
we ran a screen
so now we start running wr screens i see how it is greg

today im a ravens fan since rg3 is in
rg3 looking like old flacco on that 3rd down
i loooove seeing ben getting hit
rapist got smacked
lets fucking go
king koopa is layeth the smacketh down on big ben
and there we have it fellas
this is what happens when you have a team as depleted as us
season in a nutshell
so whos taking shots with me
rg3 sucks lol
somehow this game is gonna be lamars fault on rnfl
can someone explain to me how rnfl thinks the ravens are benefiting from this game and the steelers are the victims here
can we all agree that the blame of the game this time is on covid
nice pick but why run that out
interception for roethlisberger nice

x200b

at least our defense is working today
hell yeah not even 3 points fuck you squeelers
bowser nooooo dude coulda had the ball at the 20
great fucking job defense
captain fat fuck is complete shit
nice throw ben
nice but he was so excited he didnt even think to take a knee
watching ben look fearful of men overpowering him is satisfying and ironic
i cant be mad at bowser hes still killing it so far
ok mcsorely time
yeah get griffin the fuck out that was one of the worst things ive ever seen
rg3 is making this a tough one to watch
mcsorley szn pls
rgdone
can we start mcsorley rg3 is so bad
give us trace
put in trace mcsorley
weve turned the ball over 6 times in 5 quarters against pit lmfao fml
i truly underestimated how terrible rg3 could be
did anyone legit think rg3 was gonna magically elevate the o lmao
i actually want to see trace bc how much worse can it really get
rg3 really shouldnt be in the nfl anymore
steelers fans after beating the ravens practice squad
remember idiots actually mentioning boswell in the same sentence as tucker lol
trace cant be any worse and hes at least young lol
of course another hold this is so fun
does harbaugh not hear us every week when we say were sloppy because we play sloppy
what is rg3 doing
theres like 12 people in the stands please turn down the crowd noise
who tf is steven tuitt why would i care about this nobodys tweet
lmfao rg3 he got pushed for a sack take him out jfc hes a bum
we about to go 3 and out on the goal line lol
announcers obligatory john harbaugh was originally a special teams coach comment take a drink
if i had a nickel for every time were reminded harbaugh was a special teams coach
all be damned touchdown ravens
well at least were not gonna get shut out so we got that going for us
pad that baby
chooooo choooo motherfuckers
if steelers lose by a possession that punter is getting the matt skura treatment
big truss
quick someone call in a bomb scare or something so they have to call the game right now
i take my previous statement back lets go old school rb tds and ints
if you dont like 3rd string centers you dont like covid ball
man imagine having chris boswell
if you gave me a free 1m bet that the ravens would lead at any point in this game i wouldnt have taken it
47 minutes left and the ravens hold a lead
stop the count
cyberpunk 2077 shout out love to see it
on pace to win 2824
one silver lining is we can see some standouts like our center so far maybe will get in some real games later
pittsburgh never gets called for opi so fucking annoying
if the defense only lets them score field goals i really believe we can win this
our dline is the equivalent of a middle school jv team at this point
our boys need to drink some milk or something
why sre we still here just to suffer
i am once again reminding my comrades how much i hate the steelers
i would love the dbs to just jump every route dont give a cushion whats the value of losing slowly take some fun risks
ebron the dude who has massively underachieved his entire career but wont stop jawing about beating up on a team with 23 players out
i think wolfe learned that from ben a few minutes ago thats what he was telling him
marlo the goat
big ben 513 passer rating

stats padding
this has to be the most average 100 team ive ever seen if pittsburg meets the chiefs in the playoffs they are going to get wrecked
throw it on a fucking dime im drubk anhd hypeeddddd
i imagine trace only listens to his theme song waiting to play
soulja alert
can hollywood get up the field my god
even with all these people out gus still not getting his share
why tf cant brown catch on the run
you would think if hollywood is that small and quick and always avoids contact he would be agile and elusive but nope
harbaugh is legit gonna watch rgiii fail to do simple things all game and make no changes
theres no way we go the whole game without a fake punt pass
its so sad when i wonder if well even have 100 yards of offense today 2019 take me back
why wont the dbs press ben is getting the pass off within seconds of the snap
idc if we lose just put trace in
wish we could stop em on third down
cant give up 310 to an offense that lives on quick throws
they are literally throwing 3 yard passes every play this isnt revolutionary collinsworth
classic ebron
lol were still in it baby
damn im so proud of this team not breaking under any circumstance and dealing with the hand dealt
we have to score here defense is holding them to 3 over and over
whatwho should i sacrifice to get an offensive td
fg here will be fine keep it close
trace hasnt practiced since november 18th idk if we see him at all
holy shit rg3 ok we see you
rg triple sticks in the fucking building
thats my running quarterback
245 left in the half and we are still within one score of taking the lead


stop and consider this
how is it still 2nd down on a 5 yard penalty
mcsorley time
noooooooo
no no no no
oh jeez lol trace time
please be okay rg iii
plz be ok rg3
i really cant help but laugh man this game is incredible for so many reasons we need you rg3 pls be ok
by gaaaawd thats trace mcsorleys music


throooow it on a diiiime
tj watt on brown wtf
brown just got covered by watt alright brown now im done with you
oh wow they putting watt on hollywood lol
fucking ddive you pussy i hate tou hollywood
how is brown only a step ahead of watt
my exact words before that play eh justice hill sucks maybe he heard me
justice delivered
more heart on that run than ive seen past 4 games
justice hill fucking hates the steelers
why the fuck wouldnt we call a timeout collinsworth lmao fucking retard
ok if hill can do this in a game

1 why havent we seen it before

2 why do we still have ingram
that was such fucking bullshit
thats a delay of game get the fuck out of here
fuck off
fucking hell wilson how
yo im fucking heated right now fuck these refs
lee evans ptsd
looked like a td at first to me i can understand running a real play instead of spiking
geez theres no flag for holding our guy down
remember the no added time fiasco
welp thats a 3rd te for you
we end up with no points in the red zone way too often
that was absolute bs on every front
what did the refs miss
fuck roger
why am i mad over this game
nah i like that sequence but luke baby catch the ball
goodell looks high af
what a joke all i can do is laugh
why are the steelers a bunch of cheating lieing bastards they should automatically be disqualified for intentionally laying on the ground
this is the worst penalty in all of football they dont deserve 50 yards on that bullshit
funny how it takes the refs for the steelers to beat a team full of practice squad players
cmon offense our d needs your help
defense is standing on its head
this is going a lot better than i thought it was gonna go
i was straight up yelling get the fuck off the field for over a minute after that 4th down stop
the chiefs are going to beat this team by 30 come playoff time
were going 16o
thats a bad call agreed
is it just me or does rgiii look pissed i like it
thats a perfect tackle lol but ill take it
should be an easy one
how are the steelers not blowing this team out
run it consistently with practice squad lineman
how is that a hold
hollywood blows dick
how the fuck is that a hold
our defense is playing so well
play calling sucksssss so badddddddd
if we dont trust rgiii to throw on 3rd and 10 then take him out
i wish the ravens would realize everything didnt have to be out of shotgun a simple single back dive wouldve been a much higher percentage play to at least not lose two yards
how did they call fluker for holding but didnt call ebron earlier on in the game for the most obvious and conspicuous hold of the day
refs cost us at least 6 points were down 5
i am absolutely shocked at the efficiency of our running defense dang
why couldnt they just blow us out way less stressful
ge tthe fuck off the field
defense is playing inspired football

you love to see it
refs need to get the yellowblack meat out their mouths
no matter what happens just remember this

with half our team inactive against the 100 steelers with clear and indisputable evidence the refs are helping the steelers as much as possible we are still 1 score away from leading into the 4th

fuck the steelers and their crying arrogant victims fans
why are you leavijg tj watt unblocked
great drive right there
how many yards do we have today on offense
juiceman pick 6 pls
proud of the team today for keeping it close this year sucked overall but we in good hands
need a turnover unfortunately asking defense for a lot lets see if they can deliver again
roman is really testing my patience rn
whats the point of having bob in this game if they wont let him throw

he may not be drew brees but his right arm is still attached to his body
i have faith boys rg3 doesnt look like garbage def isnt actually playing that bad
i get not abandoning the run but man the steelers are daring us to pass

so to roman still calling zero play action passes
at least we can win against the cowboys hopefully maybe
this is just showing me how much roman is holding back lamar i get were playing with jv offense but thats when you let out some creativity
thats a catch and punch out unfortunately
its a catch and fumble
thats a catch
boo boo schuster
another fumble out of bounds teams have gotten lucky against us
they need 4 yards lets give them a 10 yard cushion
soft tissue injuries and no practice name a more iconic duo
it funny cause i can tell who its going to every time because of how far off theyre playing
we need a marlon pick 6 here
damn why they gotta give a terp carries conflicted ass feelings right there
ik were probably gonna lose but i got a feeling were gonna be alright
the injuries from this game are going to affect us for a while
this game should be 1412 going into the 4th maybe even 1712 ravens could barely put a roster together to take the field and are not getting nearly enough credit for making the steelers work harder than they have all year

i will take so much immense joy in seeing them get pummeled in the playoffs
this game smells of a john harbaugh special ravens get to the end and would have been in a much better place if they had gotten 3 points earlier in the game
playing with a bunch of backup players from injuries and covid no practice time and were still in it so far we are still probably going to lose but its clear these steelers cant hang in the playoffs
pick 6 por favor
cant even be mad about that missed tackle they have played their ass off im sure they are gassed right now
how do we get called facemasks for that but no one else does
is that not a face mask
can only expect the defense to hold for so long whats frustrating as shit no one expected us to win but the opportunities were there and they were fucked up
trace mcsorely please
are yall serious about trace or is this a meme im too depressed to enjoy
happy thanksgiving yall
we are about to get a td
we have to have hope
the steelers messed up before
they can mess up again
this is football anything can happen in 4th quarter
cant blame the defense theyre short handed and just tired theyve been bailing this offense out all game
never been more prouder of this team than i am right now
juju that score was not jigworthy tbh
showing the tomlin kr block fucking awesome love steeler cheating getting celebrated
why am i still here this is barely football
has the team gone a single game without an illegal formation penalty
lol dez thinking we would snap the ball we dont do that here
if rg3 cant run pull him out hes gonna get himself seriously hurt
my dawg rg3 fallin apart bro fuck this game
just throw it up to dez see what happens hes the only one who has ever had a history of hands on this team
why punt when you can just kneel it harbs
we should have gone for it who cares at this point
memes aside in all seriousness rg3 is clearly fucking hurt if hes your backup you are being stupid keeping him in a game thats prob not winnable
that was not a bad time for a koch pass were going to need trickery to have a shot at this spoiler alert we dont have a shot at this
hopefully everyone shuts up about lamar now
that was the closest this game will ever be and we decided to just fuck off and take the l instead of dying on the shield
its clear hes hurt this is the first time ive questioned harbs as a coach take the guy out
holy shit who the fuck is that banshee screeching
whoever just screamed like that needs to shut the fuck up
d is gassed
what the hell is that literal shrieking jesus
who the hell are these screaming seagulls
announcers got the big bens dick in there mouth they scored 12 in the firsr
holy shit ebron sucks
its time boys
trace time bitches
throw it on a diiiiiiime
oh no the mcsorley fanboys got their wish
mcsorley time apparently rgiii injured or coaches just dont think he can pull this off
this defense has given us 12 points twelve
we mcsorely need a score

mcscorely
we cant lose now mcsorley
to cheer everyone up
did anyone really expect us to win today i actually feel bad for the steelers basically our entire offense line is from practice squad we dont have our d line were playing cbs ive never even seen before playing our 3rd 4th string hbs speaking of which i dont see us keeping justice hill after this year but the steelers are 100 and barely beating us theyre running the same path that the bills ran last year
baker won tha heisman

next up trace mcsorelyyy
if trace mcsorely wins this fucking game
vikings fan here im jealous you guys have trace
saunders fuck you bro
lamar is everything for us
dont talk shit about llama no more i dont wanna hear it
doesnt matter who is throwing it to him brown will not get to it
amazing block by gus there btw
its like a white lamar jackson
how does nobody on our sideline stick up for mcsorley after that hit
offensive line has played surprisingly well all things considered
is brown just having a bad year or is he a bust not throwing shade honest question
zero urgency lmao this is a harbaugh problem
remember when our receivers could get separation good times
wilson cant catch
this is peak painful viewing
can we cut wilson idc if we have no tes that dude fuckin trash dog
whats chris talking about lol

seems like our fanbase wants lamar to scramble more instead of sticking in the pocket
marquise cant catch a ball from any of our qbs
this game made me realize how important 8 is my lord
where my hollywood haters at giving up on a wr cause of the coaching
throw it on a dime
love him or hate him the 1st career td for a qb is always a great play to watch

atta boy trace
15 just big dicked fitzpatrick
hollywood fucking burnt minkah
damnhollywood looks slow but ill take it lol
soulja boy up in this hoeeee
please oh spirit of unitas we need a pix 6
trace fucking mcsorely
man you guys really turned on hollywood so fast yeah his tweet was immature hes also still a fucking kid and was frustrated still a bright future for the hardworking kid
pick 6 incoming
another catch fumble out of bounds smh
we need to take out the rapist
why cant it stay the fuck in bounds
i just had a minor stroke from that fumble marlon ballin today
imagine if they fucking called that delay of game
can trace help on d
is it the ravens or is it seasonal depression trick question its both
left ten points on the field at the end of half and not trying the fg with tucker
big ben throwing picks and raping chicks
its amazing that this is still a close game
ravens clutch defensive plays happen on 1st and 2nd

and on the miraculous chance it is 3rd its in 4th down territory and that ends up a 40 yard pass
that was a horrible spot it is not a first down
hes short
bs spot its 4th down
the only good thing pittsburgh is mac miller there i said it
fucking dumbass refs
good fucking week boys keep our heads up we will beat them in the playoffs just gotta get there
can someone photoshop todays lead ref and a corona virus cell fist bumping while bending over john harbaugh and fucking him pls cause i kinda feel like thats what happened today
anyone else remeber monster league football for the sega genesispress acc to kill the refs
stop the count
half ass reception attempt and then has a huge smile coming back to the huddle brown is a shit head
thats some horseshit and im not even a ravens or steelers fan it was so obvious and happened for literally 20 seconds throw a gd flag
honestly just the fact that we put up a respectable fight in the first half is cool by me
claypool is straight bitch
i went from caring not at all and expecting a loss to being more emotionally invested than i have in any other game god damnit ravens
watt is offsides wtf
defense gotta be tired as fuck
chiefs watching this game knowing theyll tear both these teams apart
damn i appreciate the effort from everyone minus hollywood since he just not doing much
well good to confirm mcsorley is pitiful
dude you beat a team full of practice squad players by 5 congrats
thats short stop bailing them out
unbelievable that collinsworth cant take the steelers dick out of his mouth after they barely beat a practice squad team
the steelers need to be congratulated for beating an offense full of back ups
steelers could commit a 1st degree murder and the refs wouldnt see a damn thing
i cant remember the last time i saw the refs call a delay of game for what the steelers just did

we cannot bail our coaches out for running the ball in that situation a spike wouldve been better as it wouldve stopped the clock for a potential fg
juju dancing cause he beat a practice squad cornerback
oh so facemasks dont exist
no excuses we lost it was close which shows how trash the steelers actually are considering we were thinned out drastically time to sweep the rest of our games go to the playoffs beat everyone and bring the truss back fuck the steelers
how the fuck is that not offensive hands to the face or face masking on juju wtf he grabbed his facemask and dragged him to the ground
rg3 yelling at someone on the sideline after one of the worst pick sixes ive ever seen like its anyone elses fault but his fuck outta here bob
i just want to say how much i absolutely hate the steelers fuck them fuck all the calls going there way fuck that qb this week has been a nightmare
pad the stats

easy to do when facing a practice squad you bitch
chiefs fan here plz win lol
oh baby these are the breaks we need if we are gonna have a chance
humphrey fucking owns the steelers overrated wrs
rg3 just isnt confident that he can make the throws dude is hesitating like a motherfucker couple times now that he hasnt thrown it and hes had options
the announcers are the worst get off watts dick it was a bad pass
how many games have the refs won for the steelers wtf man
mickey mouse 100 the steelers are 64 in my book
i hope we see these frauds again worst 100 team ive ever seen
wft fan here fuck the refs
the irony of steeler fans talking about how the nfl is against them
as a chiefs fan go ravens
i support harbaugh for that timeout they clearly planned out their next plays if the steelers werent a bunch of dirty neutered dogs delaying the game pretty sure it woulda worked
fuck this is where blowing the games vs ne and pit earlier hurt so bad we should be 82 not 64 fuck
what fucking fumble


shut the fuck up announcer you limpid bitch
fuck it put mcsorely in
mods better ban the yinzer trash that comes into this sub after the game
will someone tell these drunk assuredly ugly girls to shut the hell up
did we really think wed get help from the refs on that spot
shows a camera angle where the ball is clearly short first down steelers
holy fuck cant get more obvious that the refs fixed this game for the steelers
fuck the steelers
usually i use both the ravens game thread and the rnfl game thread to see differing opinions but i refuse to look at that game thread today unless were winning for that sweet sweet salt
ravens are fielding a practice squad

steelers and their fans fucking rigged against the steelers so unfair i just shat my pants
first time ive seen trace suited up
rg3 szn
rg3 balls out him and lamar run the wildcat for the rest of the year super bowl bound double qb team
all aboard the gus bus
maybe for once this game thread isnt going to be filled with crazy expectations well see though
fuck you nbc for including tomlins sideline antics as a highlight
cant watch today boys will be at work not worried rg3 will stunt on these hoes
lets get this fucking dub boys fuck covid and double fuck dteve saunders
inb4 greg roman calls plays he shouldve been calling since the beginning of the season
offsides much
just here for the fuckin memes boys
really weird to be at work at home and watching football
king koopa
our defense can keep us in this game problem is can our offense score 7 points
3 and out baby
this game is winnable if the offense just scores a few times
yeah we straight up tackled their gunner lol
yeah im sure that was a good call fuck the refs
seems like we get a ridiculous number of holding calls against us all the time this year
good defense
can we see someone else if rg3 looks shitty
lets get this win channel the mallett
force feed dez hollywood and gus this is the way
lol this is worse than preseason
but thats expected when you dont practice
hold on bowser all day
humphs effort has been shit since he came back from covid i hope its not something lingering from it
lol missed holding call love it
yeah the refs are just gonna miss the hold wink wink
blind ass refs
the ref was right there too
defense has came to play
hell yeah for the stop wish he would have downed it in the end zone lets fucking goooooo
stay in the end zone
take a knee man wth
just go down bowser my guy
pay bowser he has been our best olb this year
shouldnt have run it out because rgiii at his own 5 but still amazing plays by the defense to stop the steelers
lets go bb

stay in the endzone tho
goddamn it man just go down
can we see mcsorely
oooof shouldve kneed in endzone
dont even care that theres no touchback we needed that to pump this team up
i hope we win this game and the steelers eat shit
why would you take that pick out of the end zone
rg3 is the derrick rose of the nfl promising young talent until a knee injury changed his trajectory
we stand tall


lol
give me mcsorley
put in trace
put in mcsorely
brown putting in the solid effort to tackle at the end of that play
man marquise really fucking pissing me off dude didnt even try to tackle him
trace time
wow sure am glad we didnt take a knee in the end zone off that interception so we could had some extra room to try and stop that pick six
yeah so when do we get a new backup that isnt a wash up
theres no way you throw into double coverage to our punt returner
we really playing the steelers with our backups for the second straight year
please take rg3 out
someone call josh woodrum
give me that mcsorley so pissburg can get that mcasskick
rgiii is shit he looked shit even when our team was good last year i dont have any faith in him
damn its almost as if this team barely practiced
rg3 is like a old dog at qb and we expect him to do tricks lol aint happening
can john harbaugh play qb
different qb same start to the game pain
put trace in rg3 has been a bum at qb for a long ass time now he aint doing shit
are they really calling holding on us and not the steelers
pad the stats should be an easy one yeah youre playing a practice squad bud get your head out of your ass
rg3 pick incoming
as painful as this has been to watch so far that fake constant background crowd noise is the worst thing about the game
they should just kick an fg now before they can turn it over
rg3 looks like he never played football before offense as a whole looks jv special teams and defense going off tho
just kick a field goal on 110
griffin only gonna throw swing passes
fuck it we should just let tucker try to hit 70 yard fgs
ravens defense gonna win this game rg3 playing like a rookie
he moves like hes covered in molasses
every time rg3 throws i hold my breath it scares me
must be an imax theatre with all these screens
talk shit about rg3
ok hes getting more confident throw a td and we winning
hill doing his best to carry the team
please no turnover
hand it to gus 40 times this game
where is gus bus hes a power back
steelers all week there is no justice for us

ravens justice
i was convinced all last year that j hill was gonna end up being our best back obviously i was wrong but the dude can still play
gus bus
the offense scores a touchdown thank you davontae harris
the center did fucking work
pad the stats bois
now how come we havent been doing this all season 1 yard to go give it to our rb
why the fuck are we so slow getting to the line like this isnt just this week but throughout the season show some fucking urgency
the bus that should play way more than he does
maybe the steelers were the hoes this whole time
anything can happen on any given wednesday
pulling for you as a bills fan if you and us both beat the steelers we have a good chance of catching them for seeding probably would be 2 barring a chiefs collapse
we are in the lead

fuck the steelers
alulu aint shit to our boy colon
we actually have a lead
were in the lead holy shit
stat padding time bitches
fuck you steelers
tucker just padding his stats
we have the lead we have the lead
its not a shut out we actually scored

well done flock
team has a different vibe for sure with the new faces hell of a block
i will never ever let anyone steeler fan forget this game if we win
our d is playing lights out but i dont think we can survive another couple turnovers we need to protect that ball at all costs
yinzers can suck on my hairy balls
dont need to tell me to preorder cyberpunk did that a whole ass year ago
mcleod is looking shaky as hell

ravens should kick to him more and try to force more turnovers
isnt a ju ju a kind of soft candy
stunt on these hoes
surprised juju wasnt too busy bitching to catch that
where have the tackling fundamentals gone
originally thursday night special of sunday night football playing now on wednesday afternoon
please learn to tackle
bag angle by elliott
seems like its gonna be nothing but quick passes and outside runs
how many times we gonna hear about our thin roster
fucking injuries
i dont have enough alcohol
turns out getting thrown into a super physical game with no practice doesnt go well
hold these fucking tik tok bitches to a filed goal please
hey remember when we were worried about injuries because of no practices but we were told that we had to power through it
this is one of the pussiest offensive schemes ive ever seen it works ill give it to them but god damn is it bitch made perfect for the steelers
wolfe has major dad energy
wolfe is a beast
their players gotta learn how to catch
great stop lmao
defense clap clap
of god does the offense really gotta go back out there
ten and ohhhh

shittiest 10 and 0 team ever
waiiiit trace is active
trace mcsorely throw it on a dime like i aint even trying
put trace in you cowards
this is not what i was just promised
was that a fucking slant
i will never complain about an okay lamar performance again
fuck out of here rg3 this dude is so washed up
why not throw mcsoreley out there
why do we go empty backfield on every 3rd and short
if we lose do we already have covid19 on lock for blame of the game
no more bob griffin lets see rg3
rg3 may be trash this oline and playcalling is worse
that boyle replacement 84 has no business on the field guy waits for the snap then just wanders around lost
they might as well run that same screen every play for the rest of the game we straight up cant defend screens
honestly let em have these small yardage plays

dont get beat deep
cant even hate on the d we have 0 offense to compete theyre gonna get shit on when its entirely our offenses fault not including covid issues
love that hit
every offense has a set of plays that give them a guaranteed 35 yards why dont we have that
come on you have to get off the field on 3rd and 10
weak marcus weak
peters is atrocious
why is humphrey not on claypool peters isnt physical enough put him on juju
tramon is more physical than juice

tramon is 37 years old
i think bend dont break is the motto of the defense today
man imagine if we had receivers getting open like that lmfao
im really curious if we played some trash team this week or last week i guess if we would win
why do they keep trying humphrey hes a top 3 corner imo
theres the ebron we all know
get off the field
get that outta here
fuck yes defense

god i love this team
my dick is now getting chubby
defense is doing just about as well as we can ask them to offense needs to get somethng going here
lets see if the offense can sustain a drive and give the d some rest
we need to be playing press man with elliot or clark shadowing claypool deep
steelers falling into the trap game mentality
can we get a 1st down
please put in mcsorley
really questioning harbaugh after these past weeks and then keeping rg3 in this game
did you know rg3 won the heisman
shit good throw and everything
robert you crazy bastard
griffin can still move though
imagine a 100 team not being able to stop rg3 while hes running lmao
oh shit ok rg3
lets go rg look at those wheels
what a play call dont say that often this year
not bad for a running back
nothing will make me happier then if we somehow can pull out a win and can go into rnfl and give a big fuck you
its gonna be so fucking funny if we actually somehow manage to win this lmao
aaaaand hes injured
well fuck
nooooooooo
nigga what the fuck
this season is just fucking cursed
fuck hopefully just a cramp
fuuuuuuck
not like this
oh man i want to see trace but not like that mannnn
hopping for the first on one hamstring heart
ive waited all year for this moment lets go we are
trace is getting hurt at this point im expecting it
i wanna get excited for mcsorely but i feel so fucking bad for rg3 man
everybody yelling no after dogging the man the whole game so far
just as he was heating up
all we can do is laugh at this point if trace gets hurt sam koch is our qb lmao
robert pls go eat a banana during halftime
its almost like you need to practice before you play a game or injuries like this happen

i hate rnfl
imagine if there was no pick 6
god imagine the memes if trace comes in and just fucks the steelers up
dive for that hollywood
bob is back
oh my fucking god its happening stay calm everyone stay fucking calm throwin on a dime like i aint even trying
fuck hollywood
literally covered by a pass rusher
tj watt seeing targets he wants to choke
dive for it brown
brown was just covered by a d end lol
youre telling me that brown couldnt beat tj watt down the sideline da fuq brown
hollywood just keeps disappointing
alright im officially done with marquise brown
how did hollywood not get enough separation on a delb
im done with marquise such a fucking chump wont even lay out for the pass
i dont know that that wasnt a touchdown
steelers arent shit lmao how pathetic
please covid jesus we need this td
fuck this shit
thats fucking loser football inexcusable
how do you not catch that
got fucked by the refs so hard just now
idc about a thing else fucking catch that ball
fucking fuck
what the actual fuck
fuckin a dude
bad cluck management and ref ball again
you all remember that administrative failure bullshit from our houston game where the fuck was that for us here
couldve at least spiked it and tried a fg
for the love of god what in the actual fuck how is that not a penalty jesus fuckin h
at the end of the game we are going to look back at that last minute and wish we could have at least gotten 3 points
we did use the timeout to early though
fuck you goodell
the pass play shouldve come first
the refs let the steelers sit on us for 18 fucking seconds
hey roger your officials fucking suck
how tf am i pissed off because of this game this is the last game i thought i would be pissed off about
can someone get this cuck off my screen
we should be winning this game fuck the steelers
it looks like goodell is reading from a script
i cant wait for the were sorry from the nfl about that absolute farce tomorrow
refs and announcers riding their dicks
this was an ouch on the clock management but hold on to the fucking ball man
too much air on that ball lw had enough cushion to merit a faster throw

but damn that noncall for delay of game
honestly would love a fake onside call here
bud dupree is such a fucking bum
these announcers can go die

refs fucked up
but we were being favored guys remember all the squeeling bitches saying the nfl favors the ravens lol
wilson literally blocked hill from getting into the end zone and then also dropped an easy td pass fuck
are we sure hill didnt score last 2 minutes it should have been reviewed
i came into this game not giving a fuck without any expectations but now that we could be up right now my anger and stress level is at the typical ravens vs steelers game now and i hate that
just a reminder that their offense hasnt done shit yall r still in this hold strong lets give these bums 2 straight losses dmv
how was that pass interference
claypool initiated contact wtf
yes throw the flag after they ask for it lmao what a joke
in all fairness humph didnt get his head around which is probably where the flag came from
juju gettin burnt by a 37 year old
fuckkk if queen gets that clean hes gone
dont forget our defense has played lights out this season if we can just score points on offense its almost like the old days
how will rnfl react if we win today
you know its bad when you cant even get the booth to defend you stupid ass calls
if lamar was playing we would be up by a lot
ahhh some help from the refs
rg3 ben rapeherburger
bad call but ill take it refs have been horseshit all game
damn nbc ripping the refs this game lol

good for them
props to rg3 hes laying at all on the line tonight all you can ask for
rgiiis fake handoffs have looked better than lamars tonight
makeup for the 36 yard bs pass interference
wasnt roughing but its make up for the shit they know they fucked us on
i have never seen a receiver try to avoid contact as much as brown screens will not work with him
absolute shit play call
not a fan of that play call
goddamn help out the defense and score something on offense will ya
whatever refs will
make us lose but this is not a 100 team they will be exposed
why would you run on 3rd and 10 tf
i feel like hollywood could be a money slot receiver he just needs to work on his separation ability to get hit hands route running and body control

trash 1 though
tj watt was lined up in the neutral zone
i just hope jimmy smiths groin problem isnt a longterm injury and hes back by the game in cleveland
this covid shit is good for one thing we can see our starters discussing the game live on twitter
i have a question for god

why
tramon has been a good fucking pick up
it is such a fucking travesty we couldnt play this fake good team with our actual roster
its always steelers receivers that end up being prima donnas lol what about their program just breeds bitch made players
oh wow tj real good job getting in there against our shit oline

at least gro isnt abandoning the run
i hope mahomes drops 50 on them if they meet
defense playing their hearts out and they dont even get a minute to catch their breath im sick and tired of this shit man like the opportunities you do get you squander them and all the other times you got your head in your fucking ass running it for a loss every other fucking play if i have to see another first down run for loss we need to petition for oc to get canned immediately otherwise im not spending another cent on this franchise thanks for listening to my ted talk
you would think that since roman almost exclusively runs on 1st down hed use that to bait the defense with some play action
thats a fumble
fruit punch is back
i mean if you wanna challenge for five yards then okay
knowing us refs are gonna say call stands 3rd and 10 and the steelers will still get the first
tomlin trying to pad humphreys stats by giving him the ff
marlo would be a hell of a boxer with that hand accuracy lol
stop the injuries
the injuries keep on coming
claypool showing his ass again with pointing and laughing dickhead
beautifully played
i hope this covid situation gets the nflpa to really drive harder for player protections how can you go into a game after no practice for over a week and not expect injuries
yessss harris
idk who that dude was but i like him
ignoring everything else about this season our defense has been intense this year
we need to get a strip on ebron dude has brick hands they need to rally to that mf every single time he touches the ball
me and my buddy jim beam are handling this game well
low key as long all of our players get healthy this covid thing was the best thing to happen to our team we have passion playing again
4th quarter and missing tackles here we go
do they not call holding ever on the steelers
cant win a game with 25 passing yards thats fo shooooo
will rg3 hit 30 passing yards on this drive
anyone else half drunk yet its getting harder to see the screen thankfully
thats probably game
i seriously dont care if we win or not i just want them stop doing those stupid ass dances
thats likely the ball game offense cant keep up
i still like tramon williams if jimmy is out for a while i wouldnt mind seeing him get some playing time
we have to throw now so should be interesting
did better than i expected with this roster
does anyone think that was a facemask on juju on the stiff arm
im proud of my boys they played better than any of us expected
fuck mike tomlin
were gonna lose next week to if lamars not playing rg3 is badddddd man
down 12 run it
we averaged over 30 points a game last year let that sink in
valiant effort but wheels are falling off now
harbaugh im begging you just throw trace out for a series
time to adjust greg the run isnt there anymore i know you cant figure out how to play both at once but figure it out
offense on the field for like 2 fucking minutes holy crap this is embarrassing give the fucking defense a break you incompetent assholes
is it me or did rg3 pull up lame after that snap he looks like hes struggling
put trace in for the love of god rg3 is clearly playing hurt and he hasnt been good anyway
those cocksuckers in rnfl are probably enjoying this shit fest because they hate us so much
lmao punting
id love to hear the logic for why you cant correct something as simple as an illegal formation
should faked with with koch there
they must hate trace rg3 is obviously hurt and staying in
man if i was dez i would be mad af give him a chance wtf
the time to throw on that series was 1st down
that was dumb we had to go for it there now steelers can just run out the clock against our tired defense
fuck this gameim going to turn on madden and beat the shit out of the steelers
shut up shrill pittsburgh trash
were so bad and losing is not fun
they look like they dont care like they wanna go home
how are you motherfuckers going to get all pissy about our practice squad getting beat by the steelers this shouldve been a blowout but instead its 719
steelers have only thrown it deep like one time nobody can fucking get a stop anymore lol
ebron is fucking trash
ebron w a vintage drop
lets get ready to throw it on a dime because its trace mcsorley time
oh shit its meme time
tbh even if we lose we get to see trace play soo
throw it on a dime
can anyone who complained that we couldnt beat the texans or washington good enough just appreciate that at least we arent like this normally as many other teams are
if mcsorley wins i will never say anything about the people say start trace ever again
not even mad we lose this game im quite happy squeelers fail to blow out a practice squad and how easy theyve had it all season
watch trace just audible every play because fuck the calls let me dream
now is the time when all the meme wizards find out what a 3rd string rookie qb can do

hint its not what theyre expecting
put rg3 back in
were not winning lmao guys chill
why tf is gro calling the same plays with trace that he would with jackson no fucking adaptation at all jfc
trace jawin
steelers players talking a lot of trash for beating backups
minkah is a chode
luke has been a bit disappointing in his early career here
summary for the meme lords

5 passes one completion
imagine lamar in a run n shoot offense our scheme just isnt good at all this year
cant believe we have sam koch just sitting there with that cannon and havent turned to him yet
brown is sus guys
ok can all the facebook racists shut up about starting mcsorley he is not the way
wow marquise brown made a good move on that to make it into a td im shocked haha
the soulja finally scores again
okay soulja lets go
prepare for the memes
collinsworth just called him one of the most elusive receivers in the league i have seen no evidence of that whatsoever until that very play haha what is he talking about
and this makes the whole fucking disaster at the end of the first half gamebreaking
soulja boi
get a fucking stop
the luke wilson dropoof
mcsorley threw a td hes 2nd stringer in my book now people can understand why the fans were pissed they didnt put him in sooner rg3 threw for 25 yrds
if that unleashes hollywood to do something on a consistent basis this game will be worth it
collingsworth is slobbering all over the steelers dickfuck i cant stand him
absolute dime by mcsorley someone should write a song
we wont win but man i want it so bad
mcsoreley ben trashburger
we would have been in it longer if we didnt force rgiii same shit happens with ingram
beat the squeelers
so happy for hollywood
hey defense were back in it so this is where you do the opposite of what youve been doing all game
pissed that he caught that lob but steelers receivers have dropped a lot of easy ones this game
ahhhhhhh

why did they give me hope again
theyre going to get lamar back flash to sad rg3
give us the 4th down

please just make this a game
how is that a first down
how was that a first
was the camera off the line that looked short
he is short wtf
whew at least we have a cupcake schedule coming up
no bullshit it was a good game practice squad held their own agains these bitches
that one lady
no real practise for 10 days 7 starters on offense gone

i cant get over how big the end of the first half plays into this now but defense needs the stop regardless
wait i thought they called it short
if you would have told me we woulda only lost by 5 cause of a chuck clark hand and a luke wilson drop from winning i wouldnt have believed you
refs were against us all game part 2 congrats to shitsburgh for cheating their way to 110 mickey mouse schedule well beat their ass next year
well at least we have a candyass schedule the rest of the way and get lamar back
oh fuck off lol
collinsworth can go suck it that is all
refs mustve been really pissed they had to work on a wednesday
trace mcsorley throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin just a kid from bryerwood to wearin number 9 met coach franklin down at vandy flipped to happy valley now im coming back and got the natty on my mind they cant touch my deep ball every game im scorin
this one is on harbs he blew the time management
rg3 need to be cut he could not get his team downfield for a field goal what kind of shit is that
breaking news steelers are overrated
stop the count
ravens won by a lot
padding those stats huh
clay pool is a bitch
these smug bastards love to play the officials i swear to god
fuck

the

steelers
fuck the steelers and fuck these refs
get roger goodell off my fucking screen
game is ending 1412 ravens im calling it now
we were 10 yards off of them again on 3rd like wink has his weaknesses guys dont be blind to it
fun fact squirtle from pokemon is half squirrel and half turtle
juju getting away with a nice face mask
typical juju plays bad all game beats a fa corner on a 1 yard route and dances for 20 seconds
harbaugh been playing to lose all year did we lose a voice in his ear over the offseason dudes been making every wrong decision while last year he made every right decision
this shows how bad baltimore needs lamar jackson
steelers are garbage lmao
everyone please for the love of god dont let that catch and run let you lose sight of how dog shit and lazy hollywood has been all season and likely still will be he is going to talk a lot of shit like hes the best but dont fall for it he has to show us a fuck ton more than just that to make up for this terrible season
collinsworth back on the steelers sack again
if i ever meet collinsworth in real life im gonna call him fucking bitch and that im surprised his tiny mouth can fit all that steeler cock in it
without a few killer mistakes jv ravens almost pulled the upset ill take it
that hillbilly lady in the crowd is annoying as fuck
ben acting like they dont make excuses thats his mo his entire career
juju happy he finally got something against the practice squad stfu tik tok bitch
well im glad we can see mcsorely in a game

hes not good lmao
imagine being proud of a team that beat a team that was missing half its players and they had to have the refs interfere on ball placement ruining a come back

steelers fans are such trash
are people really complaining about the refs when our dude literally tackled someone as a blocker lol
take the touchback
remember when some people were toying with the idea of putting in rgiii for lamar this year
how is this team 100
please sir may i have another stop the count joke
theres still 45 minutes left

dont act were the winners just yet
good thing ben cant throw a 5 yard pass well take it
fuck you steelers tik tok field goal scoring ass bitches
boswells kicks look like fuzzy white dog shit
chorus
throw it on a dime
like i aint even trying
just a kid from briar woods
im wearing number nine
met coach franklin down at vandy
flip to happy valley
now im coming back and got the natty on my mind
they cant touch my deep ball
every game im scoring
im your favorite quarterback
they call me trace mcsorley
rep that blue and white
you know i do it for the glory
baker won the hisman next up trace mcsorley
steelers still need the fucking refs to beat a team of practice squad players
hey hey remember how the nfl was favoring the ravens lmao cheating ass bitches
wilson has to keep that caught
walk away with 0 there is embarrassing
please all i want is an rg3 win i aint even a ravens fan
talk your shit juju hahahahahahhahaha
if queen caught that we would be back like 10 yards lol
wow bad call imo

we steelers had ref help all game up to this point our turn
everyone asking for trace to play doesnt understand that he is lacking one thing the exaggerated swagger of a black teen
death taxes and the steelers getting preferential treatment from the refs
are they really going to fucking challenge that

fuck offff
thats all she wrote boys defense is gassed
the steelers defense talks a lot of shit for being awful at football
roman get your head out of your ass you have to throw the ball now you idiot
if we just added lamar to this covid team today we woulda won
were so bad without lamar man how do people not see that i hope this game brings some light into some idiots who think lamar is bad lamar is legit this team aside from an ok defense this team is terrible
someone get that loud bitch out of there wtf lol
loss still stings but that was much better than i thought it would be
i am so sick of the ravens losing incredibly close games this year especially when the refs make multiple shitty calls that hurt us badly in those games and we just seem to have some snakebit bad luck this whole year has just been so incredibly frustrating as a ravens fan starting with january fucking 1st
i dont normally drink this early but i dont think anyone here will judge me
run the clock go home healthy fuck the outcome tbh
chiefs fan checking in here ive got a good feeling for the ravens on this one get it done boys were rooting for you
ill let you know in about 3 hours if i liked wednesday afternoon football
yes lets hope dez makes a catch today
i dont expect a win i just hope we dont lose by too much two tds at the most but well see its game time
nice return duv
my prediction for this game a sloppy onesided blowout that we will all wonder why we waited an extra week for

and steelers fans will never shut up about how the nfl and the ravens screwed them out of their only shot at a 160 season
best kr in the nfl

hey lets kick it short
astros cheated
man i hate the fucking steelers
luke wilson looks like an 80s hair metal band guitarist
they celebrated that too much lol
haha fuck u claypoop
i think this game is going to make people appreciate how much we need lamar
thought shit was sweet
i belee
lets gooo big ben felt that
king koopa
yep gonna be one of those games
jesus that was awful
wow even the backup offense sucks dick
omg that is hilarious fuck me this is going to be an ugly game
wellwasnt expecting much anyway lol
and it begins
watching this game on my phone as i work my shift at subway
mods will be busy in this gdt the steelers and browns trolls are out en masse already how insecure can you be
lol still with the refball
wouldve been better if he kept it in the endzone but good shit regardless
just take a knee in the endzone lol
well the defense is still good
steelers gonna be the same cocky little twats today huh
why run that out
take a knee wtf
that was the worst pass ive ever seen
defense take my energy
win or lose idc im just here for the shenanigans this game
tyus is our best defender this year now that calais is injured
defense came to play but now its back to the offense
if the d can keep this up weve got a chance problem is if they get gassed by the 4th
nice shit tyus
not kneeing there is huge good stand but oof
can we let rg3 throw more than screen passes this drive
if our offense doesnt actively sabotage the game this could potentially be close
aye when he picks a ball off the instinct is probably to try and score a td out of that like ed reed so i dont blame him
bowser about to wally pipp judon
uwhiteboobs wheres my jersey
gtfo with that stupid shit after 1 damn tackle
bench rg3
that looks more like what i expected from this game
damn i didnt realize rgiii was this bad
i was expecting nothing and somehow am still dissapointed lol
well our offense is a absolute dumper fire we want mcsorley
amazing how slow rg3 looks long strides dont help that appearance
trace
lets be realistic rg3 and the o aint doing shit lol our hope is with the d and theyre doing their part
yeaaaaa its huntley time
jesus rg3
rg3 is awful
boykin has no respect
the db read that all the way read his eyes
what a dumpster fire of a game on both sides so far lmao
i know we have no shot but cmon man 2 turnovers inside own 25 already
i got boswell as my only steeler on fan duel and he fucks up the xp

thanks
just put trace in rg3s career is coming to an end and trace is young and can still get better with experience
rgiii can not throw anymore its so bad
i think wed have more of a chance if we just didnt field an offense today lol just punt every time
soooooo trace mcsorely
pros defense st

cons steelers defense
yeah so this going about the way i expected
rg3 definitely doesnt look fast enough to be running read options tbh
we need ryan mallet in here
id rather see trace right now
can we stop putting the offensive woes on lamar now
my expectations were low but rg3 is managing to underperform them
rg3 playing 7d underwater chess by looking awful to help lamar look better to the media and fans
this is just reiterating to me that lamar is the system
lmao how did he not see hayden coming
by gaaawd that sam kochs music
bold prediction offense never crosses the 50 yard line with rg3
oh now they call holding
im so sick of the refs and these holding callsnocalls seems like they call literally every ticky tack hold against us and never call holds against our opponents
fuck the refs fuck pittsburgh
dude how do we never get penalties for us fuck you nfl
jesus this is just bullying
this crowd noise is so fucked up i can even hear the commentators
life without lamar sucks
rg3 looks like a civilian in there
koch qb time
dumbass shouldve fair caught it
told yall we gonna have to rely on d and st
memeiest game of all times
who said we wouldnt get past the 50 p
what in the name of god is happening
we need to win this on special teams and defense keep it out of rg3s hands
fucking literally our d and special are showing just get tucker in range every drive please
pad that big fat bitch
sam koch punting his trickiest balls may be our best offensive play
that punt was the largest yardage gain were likely to make today
in the word of the great barney stinson trace mcsorley suit up
we should honestly just kick a field goal now just to put up some points
wow how is that team undefeated
we need a td right here cant blow this
gameplan run
this offense is dogshit
they dont trust griffin at all get him out
im already tired of hearing cris collinsworth
ok rg3 i forgive you
rg iii got wheels

x200b

like fine wine he gets better with age
what the fuck is this amazing shit
we need rg3 before ngata destroyed him that one game i think the redskins still won that game though
i feel like gus got benched
rg3 celebrating 1st downs after being a turnover machine every time he touches the ball is so rg3
gus the bus
lets fuckin go
easy win

did we clone luke willson 3 times
offense showing some life with the rungame on this drive thats good to see with so many backups on the line backup qb backup running backs its amazing that we were able to put together that kind of red zone drive with these backups

tristan coloncastillo got in their ass at center
steelers thought you were padding stats why are you losing then
stop the count
beep beep the bus is here picking up 6
gusbus
both teams have 2 turnovers
i think our best bet is if rgiii just plays it safe with his passing and runs whenever he can
tucker boswell
coivd test everyone rn
at least the game is competitive
this is the stupidest game of football ive ever watched
coloncastillo with the clean snap and a great block holy hell hes the center for the rest of the year ha
rets gucking 3oooooo
coloncastillos best play as a pro theres a reason weve been holding him
can someone get covid right now so we can call the game where it stands
why am i having more fun with this game than any other game this year lol except the browns game
got em rattled
were winning
missed extra point and capitalizing on the muffed punt could be huge gotta have luck against another good team
even if we lose this has been fun lol
let gus eat then throw hill at them repeat
why do the steelers have so much umd football players
watching anthony mcfarland play for the steelers feels like getting stabbed in the back
im so impressed with the nonstarters lfgggg
ferguson good at edge setting now
we have the lead which is honestly remarkable
tackling issues continue
some explain why we cant just play man with no practice
once again our secondary is slapping wrs with palm fronds and then standing around shocked that it doesnt work
i love rg3 really hope this works out
teams going to wear out if they run the no huddle we dont have subs add in more injuries
almost like playing with no practice is really fucking stupid been saying it all week
deshon elliott got up but derek wolfe is still down oh no

update phew both walked back to the sideline and still have their helmets on
just want to point out no one on the ravens maybe dez now makes that catch ebron did with any consistency
ben wishing wolfe well while he was down with a double tap the helmet

they dont like playing this game any more than we do it should have been rescheduled
ebron push off
theyre picking on deshon in the pass game
that ted danson show looked like a parody but then there was no punchline
jesus can the injuries stop please havent we had enough already
why does anyone take the madden cover
i fucking hate the steelers so much
ngata isnt too old can he suit up real quick for one game
listen yall we have tucker playing anything can happen cryies in flacco tears
i hate large benjamin
dont tell my boss i already opened a beer
we also dont have enough depth if someone gets injured might see dez at safety by the 3rd quarter lol
at work cant watch so this is my first time seeing the game through this feed of comments what a rollercoaster
it feels like 2015 again with everyone out
why are corners not playing press coverage
why is jimmy smith always injured hes like broken glass man from spongebob
wow im shock jimmy actually was healthy enough to play a snap
ravens can stop getting injured right about now
wolfe has really stepped up past few weeks
clay pool aka marlons son along with juju
clay pool really wanted a flag for that
lfg marlo
fucking lol
appreciate that one
no practice but our red zone defense is on point
washington fan here who still has a soft spot for rg3 hope you guys can get the win today
thats another stopped td

keep it up defense
trace mcsorley
oh shit trace time
i wanted trace to come in just to shut up every single start trace person
aw man we got blue balled
loving the steelers looking like shit after all the yapping their players were doing this week
hollywood is tiny as fuck
rg3 wtf was that lol
shouldve actually been mcsorley out there
throw it to who

unless we signed the invisible man no ones open
why doesnt hollywood ever dive for an extra 2 yards take the hit man
goddamn it third bob
route concept also bad
drop it lmao
hes so fucking bad lol
we should try to slant rout like they do
sit rgiii dont let the world see he sucks so we can try trade his useless ass
nothing but slants for brown thats all he gets till he gets it together
play trace
oh i think mp was right probably wasnt a completion
eat more dirt ben
biggest throw they make all game and its incredibly soft coverage dont get ben excited
tramon has been all over since hes been in digging that atleast
this pittsburgh offense is doo doo in the redzone
imagine throwing at humphrey lol
get that outta here
trace 4 minute td drive coming up
you guys are forgetting who peters is hes a coin flip in coverage either he gives up a big play or he picks it there is no in between
pad those stats ebron
our red zone defense is absolutely elite right now somehow
we need a fg drive at minimum dont give the ball back
redzone defense is great just need some offence
was tuitt referring to boswell doing the stat padding lol what a fucking clown
this is honestly going much much better than i expected
mcsorley plz
we need to put richard in the game bobby is done for
stfu collinswoeth
sometimes i wish i wasnt a ravens fan so i can laugh at the shitshow that every ravens vs steelers game is
someone take a flight to pittsburgh to bench rg3
lets get dez involved

edit well that not what i meant
dez tripped on his walker
holy shit
i dont know why but i fucking hate tj twatt

that is all
lamar who
bud dupree looks like he smokes mids
wooohoo rg3
suck the fattest cock all the rg3 haters dude is filled with rust yet he just ran in up the middle like a rb
when rg3 got that tongue out you know its on lmao
rb1 rg3
the fake crowd noise is like a little off i keep thinking there are false starts or game stoppages
please god no turnovers here even a field goal id be happy with going into half
rg3 take us home
damn youd think the steelers hadnt practiced all week
rg getting cramps
oh no
oh no

hes limping
you must be joking
you asked for tracenot sure thats how you wanted him to get in
fuckin collinsworth this line is playing well they literally had one good play and have been dogshit the rest of the game
hammy
why cant we have nice things
holy fuck trace is gonna be in the game
holy shit what the fuck happened griffin just suddenly comes up gimping completely out of nowhere turf monster jesus
noooooooooo
oh fuck
what the hell man this season is nuts
man this really sucks to see i just wanna see the return of rg3 and see him ball out but he guy is a fucking warrior finishing that run while limping
nooo he was just getting going good find to dez if he didnt fall huge run hope he can stay in
shit i didnt want him injured


here comes richard i guess
ran so hard he blew his hammy what a game boys
rg3 is confident running fast for 5 yards but fear sets in after that you could tell he cant break off like he used to
theyre gonna make a movie out of this game
damn bob blew a tire
this is some monkeys paw shit
just got a call from ravens heard i could throw a nerf football pretty well and wondered how quick i could get to pittsburgh
rg3s best drive and he pulls something fuck
throw it on a diiime
please be ok
hes back inthat cant be good
lol its almost caught is a pretty solid summary of this season
get to the fucking line idiots
why do we have such terrible wr coaches
dk would have made that catch
hollywood jogging on that route get the fuck off the field
broadcast crew didnt even bother dressing up lmao
hollywood cant roast tj watt come on hes like 260 lbs damn it
bollywood is a bust
by the end of this game i want justin tucker to randomly kick chris collinsworth in the nuts
supreme court justice hill
justice hill oh lort
this team is playing with so much heart honestly fuck everybody that thinks harbaugh should be on the hot seat
that run there is the perfect example of why i dont get why we abandon the run we can literally average as much as some teams passing games
these play calls are so awful and they are working against the best defense lmao
that might be game lol
kill me
lol they fucked us again
ah the refs being inept again
are you kidding me
that is some bull crap
that was some bullshit
why no spike and kick the fg
fuck the refs too
how do we happen to find every player who cant catch a ball
fucking idiots
the league has it in for the steelers
andy reid school of clock management
thats some bullshit
and thats why you shouldnt waste two of your tos and just snap the damn ball
fuck off goodell the on field product is pathetic
who knew it was this easy to get the offense to not run a play just lay on the ball after every play
get this bitch out off my face
goodell justifying himself and being a cock goblin
goodell straight up knew he was gonna ask that and hes reading off some shit
even with that dirty ass play at the end and our practice squad on the field were still doing better than the browns did against them lmao
lol the steelers getting away with fuckery and wilson dropping the ball making that timeout a mistake is the definition of hindsight there chrissypoo
steelers should get fined for lying on that pile and staying there bunch of bitches

also the refs as well
uh you guys do realize our defense would do the same thing in that situation right

every coach realizes that which is why you hardly see run plays in similar situations
wilsons leg prevented hill from scoring on first down and then dropped the ball on 3rd down he really fucked us there
should do a longest yard play on the ref throw it at his fucking tiny ass dick
damn cris cuntsworth really showing his favoritism i guess we should just hold and interfere if the refs wont call anything what type of inbred logic is this also fuck goodell and his policies this wont be the first outbreak and i hope he gets rightfully shit on when the playoffs go to shit
we should be winning this fucking game we can still win this fucking game
it dont get better than this

well then call the game and go home
and itll end with ref ball as per usual
how tf flag come in from refs 50yrd away but the one right in front of them didnt throw shit fuck these refs
literally penalized for everything and tre steelers nothing someone needs to fucking swing on these refs i dont even care
good fucking stop
humphrey has to turn around there maybe not an egregious play but theyre going to call that 9 times out of 10 if the db doesnt at least pretend to play the ball
queen had that aghhhhh
good shit defense
it ok queen he probably wouldve gotten near where we are
tramon playing like a beast
lets go mofos they dont want this smoke
my pants are off
okay but seriously how is their offence so shitty
the only steeler i respect is conner claypool is a whiny bitch juju is overrated ben is a rapist tj is a dirty player
rg3 playing with heart
damn 4k comments on this thread and collinsworth throws down the best burn about delay of game hang our collective heads
well well well how the turn tables
bad call but we deserve the karma
shut up collinsworth you moldy cunt
so weve firmly established the refs are trash
shut the fuck up williams

cheating fuck
oh the steelers had a call not go their way get fucked cheaters
r g 3 is a fucking savage no fucking quit in him
refs be like quick we fucked up get a make up penalty quick
theyre going to spend more time complaining about this one iffy call against the steelers than they even talked about the end of the first half
damn its tough to overcome holding calls with this o gotta stay clean
thats another weakass holding call on us
existence is pain
can i just give some kudos to coloncastillo these snaps are solid
i want a play action shot to the endzone i smell blood
soulja sighting 3
i dont think deep snapper is a term
what are these play calls
what was that play call
the refs sure do have a good defense
what was that shit
oof if he let that go we wouldve downed it at the 1
hes got that new deep snapper

petition to start throwing never at the end of some gdt comments when hollywood sucks ass
corners playing 20 yards off lets run a draw instead of a quick slant or screen to get in fg range
pick sox come on peters do something
waf has been quite a thrill so far
why cant we air out passes and draw pi like they do oh yea cuz we got some tegridy
ofc jimmy is hurt lmao
ben just has all day
so satisfying to actually be countering this bitch ball ben is playing
defense is balling out
fuck claypool
fuck off refs
how we doing boys this sucks not watching or listening
marcus peters can tackle who woulda thunk
not a good call on block in back didnt push with arms
these refs are terrible
can we get some field position without constant kickoff ref ball
we need a td here a nice long drive would be killer
i was playing a career on madden 20 as a wr and i kept getting so many block in the back calls shit is just burned into my brain i got like 5 a game sometimes fucking corners just turn around mid block
just push the guy in the back from where they punt and we get the ball there no brainer
how are people complaining about our players when we get a penalty theyve shown some bs ones and you think the ones they dont show are our guys fault ok
lamar even got quarantined from that commercial lol
i dont want to see the ravens getting another defensive back in the offseason

invest in offense for once
just got home from work how we doing boys
succession such a good show
its not fair to the defense for our offense to be so damn bad
how do you just not block tj watt
if you could block tj watt that would be greeeeeaat
why do we have no urgency
at least he didnt fumble there
i didnt know this game was going to ravens vs the steeler ref team
the only thing rg3 has done is qb run up the middle they adjusted at half to shut it down now we have no good plays we know rg3s ceiling its time to pull him and see what trace has got
thats probably a catch and fumble
either way the whining about this play will be insufferable
finally a pupu sighting
wish that wouldve stayed in bounds
marlo giving juju flashbacks
marlo been making crazy plays today
thats def a catch and a fumble unlucky it didnt stay in bounds
lol is that a hog call in the crowd noise thats on brand
they gave them too much room on that 3rd down
please reset the clock to

how strange to hear that
wow players that cant condition for 10 days are getting injured
pq almost had that swat
well we didnt get shut out
murder me
who could have known that sitting on your ass for 10 days and then playing an nfl calibur football game might be overly stressful on a body
the defense is getting so tired
this is what happens when athletes cant practice and keep game ready fit
hell yes what a block
just when i thought i had enough alcohol
im just happy we didnt get blown out we all knew what was gunna happen today
i dont know who that is but great play
what a play
great play
i dont even know where harris came from lol
harris out here playing better than bonds
rg3 has 25 passing yards averaging 25 yards per pass and a 250 passer rating
tackle now please
im not mad at the defense theyve had no help at all
i am having a very bad day

i am no mood

this today

has been one of the worst days i have had in a long time
why didnt we kick the fucking fg
facemask
it was a good run

fuck that p6
i dont even care anymore get most of our guys back tomorrow onto the cowboys
what the fuck is roman gonna dial up now that we have absolutely nothing to lose probably some bullshit
whelp offense now its now or never lets go
im more upset with the coaches than anything
my dudes idk what to say most nfl teams even with a back up can get 100 passing yards we have 5 in the 4th quarter without lamar at qb
but how wasnt that a facemask
how nice of them to show the reason i picked my flair
if we had any doubts about this team being soft we can throw that out the window right now they could have folded after the first couple of tos and gotten blown out but they didnt even with all the starters out
lingering on the sidelines is one way to put it
1 more drive and we see mcsorely
rg3 looks hurt af
god if this game was on thanksgiving my inlaws would have had a word with my wife
fuck the fuckin steelers
our defense is going to get us a pick 6
how hard is it the only throw it like 510 yards

why is it always screen or td
how the fuck do they have an illegal formation call every game
rg3 limped on that dropback

not sure hes going to finish this game

btw that penalty shouldnt be on the ravens they were set for over a second

nvm illegal formation so right call
this game was way more entertaining than expected honestly feels like mid 2000s ravens football but with a worse defense
yeah rg3 looks rough
roman im going to try to win a nfl game by not calling a creative passing play
my disappointment cannot be explained accurately
how do you not go for it
so trace in next drive please
pick six plz
big brains harbs knows the best chance we have at scoring is by having our d on the field s
wtf do have to lose by playing mcsorley
why did we punt
punting ended it for us we needed to go for it they drain the clock and probably get at least a fg out of our gassed defense
well a game was played i guess
youd think the steelers are up by 57 by the way the announcers are acting
ravens tackling continues to be atrocious
i hate juju bitch boofer
im hungry what should i eat
trace
trace baby
ab was right about boo boo
come on trace
eric ebron is trying to be the ravens defensive player of the week
throw it on a fucking diiiiiiiiime
throw it on a dime
on a dime
waited too long to put mcsorley in should have been done at the beginning of the half or a few drives aftwr
alright lets see what trace can do
trace is in
do you believe in miracles you sexy thing
ill be honest id rather see huntley lets see what the kids got tho
i expected to lose this game and yet im disappointed it was within our grasp at times the players we had avaliable did their best amongst some bad calls and lack of practice defence carried and we need a new oc lets just hope we can get healthy and try win out from now
trace in roman is still gonna call shit plays
mcszn ravens have 7 points trace is 7 its fate hes putting 16 straight up leggoooooooo
this has made my day lets go mcsorely
please throw the ball down the field
throw it on a dime like i aint even trying trace time
mcsorely comes in and wins the game unlimited meme potential
i hate being in a stream with a delay what is happening is penn state on the field
oh no hes a bust
not a great start i will admit
throw it on a wooden nickel
4 verts mass protect the rest of the game lmao madden this mofo
man i want to trace mckill myself
mcsorley threw a terrible pass and looks slower than an injured bob
oof this is they guy people wanted to start over lamar at one point
yep may as well go for it and it worked
yeah that completely should have been a flag imagine rodgers taking that hit
he gets rid of the ball quick i like it
wilson is so bad lmao
why tf would we punt anyone
the surrender index on this punt is about to be otherworldly pederson in ot levels
the heart of our defense vs the heart of our offense is such a night and day difference i will say the justicerg3 played hard but wow
are yall drunk yet
the fucking holds are just egregious and consistent on the edge i truly dont get it
we need the bills to beat the steelers
defense and st did all they could to win this game it just wasnt enough with his much of our offense were missing
im so weak at the fact that people thought this season had anything to do with lamar this game shows you what hes working with
steelers have had a lot of unforced drops today
ravens receivers get zero separation and the play calling is dog how do we score 20 points a game its all 8
seems like an eternity ago that we were winning games by large margins having a good ass time and running the heisman package
vanilla vickhe even wearin 7
souja
marquise caught yhe ball
that made me happy
minkah got toasted by hollywood lmaooooo9
wr 15 heard us
td trace to brown what fucking timeline are we in lol
yoooooo fitzpatrick get fucked
never doubted hollywood for a second
you can hear the pain in the refs voice when penalizing steelers
traceeeeeeee
dude soulja d out the defense
the soulja was let loose
soulja sighting
they heard yall talking shit
ah yes trace mcsorely to hollywood brown for a 70yard touchdown just like we expected
nice job fitz keep talking shit
hollywood stays as fitzpatricks daddy
if refs did not fuck us at the end of the half we up now
truzzzz
trace is a beast
trace to hollywood
thats my soulja
now thats a soulja move finally
trace shoulda started the 2nd half rg3 simply cant move the ball when needed
pad the stats
is it a touch or a first down omg shut the fuck up cris
souja boy tell em
he would fumble out of bounds lol
thank me later
i just nutted no
you lucky fucks
hey look thry gave us that 18 seconds back
damn heinz field is gross
soulja has made a play so i will refer to him as hollywood until next week
goddammit

can we stop doing this
how come we dont draft guys like that
man its like every game at the most important part our defense finds a way to shit the bed
that may do it well it wasnt as hideous as it could have been but thats not saying much
wait why are we using all our timeouts
why give me hope for no reason
at least we did something
the defense is probably gassed as fuck so i cant really blame them
we dont have any dogs like that on our team
rally caps for pick 6
peters just redeem yourself with a pick 6 or ff6 easy
they gave us a good effort out there i had fun
did no one see that false start on the 3rd down conversion
throw it on a dime
at least we made it a competitive game thats all i could have asked for really
the chains were further than the ball
hes short but not with the refs and the steelers on the same field
fuck the steelers
honestly i count this as a symbolic win for the backups they kept this super close and im v proud
good game goodness gracious though lol
bengals fan in peace holy fuck they give pitt every fucking call even against a good organization like you guys never ceases to amaze me
i fucking hate the queerlers
lol fitzpatrick all that shit talking and you drop an int fucking clown
was that collinsworth congratulating the steelers overcoming adversity there
remember the refs are against us
that wasnt a takeaway by their defense fuck off
huntley can not possibly do worse
tom brady is still better than big ben love to see it
i hate everyone who asked for trace
souljas gotta catch that
we got screwed
how are professional coaches this bad at clock management
fuck chris collinsworth
stream im watching right now playing the trace mcsorely rap song
steelers are the worst 100 team of all time they can barely beat our practice squad
someone explain to me why the steelers coverage guys are allowed to jack up wrs 8 yards down the field an explanation on that would be great as well
even against the practice squad the steelers still need the refs to call a crooked game

theyre not very good
get the fuck off the field you shit fucks
refs are killing us this season
tj watt is my least favorite player in the league i fucking hate him and his fraud of a brother too both are total pieces of shit
unbelievable to me that we should actually be winning right now
whos ready for our weekly fourth quarter breakdown
hows that not face mask on juju
well at least it wasnt a shut out
no call face mask on a crucial play so classic refball game after game lets just go to next year
lmao classic roman

down by 12

run trace up the middle
minkah would be a better receiver than soulja
why am i pissed damn i had no expectations and they gave them to me
rip marcus peters
of course it goes their way

the steelers are such an atrocious team fuck them and fuck the refs
greg roman managed to take a team devastated by a covid outbreak and still make the loss his fault unreal im well past fire roman and think harbaugh should be in the hot seat
based trace mcsorely with the black lives matter decal on the back of the helmet
man peters got bent over a table
i was totally rooting for the steelers before the game you guys got really screwed
steelers needed the refs to beat our practice squad
fuck juju

more like boohoo bitchloser
lol steelers are complete frauds beat a practice squad by 5 points ill enjoy watching them get blasted in the playoffs
how are the steelers so stacked with talent year after year after year its not fair
refs only hit us with that to fuck our field position
lay a hit hollywood i dont know if a ravens player has ever bugged me more then him
rg3 should retire he is fucking dog shit
dont worry guys player safety is an nfl priority
just remember that sam koch is the most accurate passer in nfl history
thats a huge win lets go boys im here to delude myself into a win
marlon got so lucky
defense playing like wild men
i see people asking for mcsorely the looks any of our qbs are going to see coming from roman will be trash

maybe this exposes him rightfully so
idk how yall can be blaming the defense this much the offense has been 1 and out theyve had 0 rest lol
that time management wasnt on harbaugh rg3 wasted those timeouts on his own for no reason
seriously dont understand how thats allowed its obvious they are laying down to chew clock
does anyone know a good pancake recipe
if the ravens get the lead back they should all pile on one steeler player until the game is over if it works for them it should work for us i mean that is the second time they have done that to us this year
cucked by the refs
sure fuck the refs but wtf is harbaughs clock management
look at it this way they are 100 and they are struggling against a makeshift team
fuck these refs
this team legit sucks without the refs
its so frustrating if wilson makes that catch in the endzone its a completely different game still though belee
if lamar and the guys were playing theyd be blown out and dead
fuck chris collinsworth
steelers are god awful
sam sam koch koch
juju and fumbling in tense moments name a better duo
blatant pick not called
nobody celebrates like the pittsburgh recievers
fuck the steelers

worst team to be 100 ever
get him out of there ffs hes hurt
the ravens organization has to rank pretty low on football iq i swear man
steelers fans have to be concerned about how poor theyve been against our practice squad

edit should add proper steelers fans not the melts that come on to this sub trying to get bites or reply to nfl tweets
so hes like not a throwing qb trhen
trace looks just bad rg3 showed experience at least trace just looks like a kid
someone needs to ask hollywood how he got blanketed by tj watt thought he was a soulja
of all the people it had to be it had to be brown i mean i guess beggars cant be choosers but jesus christ he is not going to shut up after that one is he
can colinsworth shut the fuck up
another hold and another no call
to be fair guys we did sweep the steelers last year without big ben i bet a lot of real steeler fans arent flexing big knowing this team aint the real ravens i wasnt as satisfied beating the steelers last season without their main guy
was the ball not behind the pole
wow fuck collingsworth
dirty play what the heck
how tf was that not facemasking by juju

he clearly grabbed the helmet

these refs are laughable
lets do this i feel like ive waited a lifetime for this game
i have to work at 5 and im honestly not upset
when we win i will be unbearable
once upon a midnight dreary while i pondered weak and weary

over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore

while i nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping

as of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door

tis some visitor i muttered fuck the steelers
this broadcast is nuts so far the steelers pa people are blasting the music too fucking loud lmao
my expectations are on the floor i think that means we blow them out
i know its stupid to be hopeful but i really want them to win today
the steelers are hoe and on them we shall stunt
im from cove a washington fan go ravens
lol they actually included tomlins fuckup in the commercial
fucccckkkk the steelers
rip its not sunday though
fuck work lets do this
the best part about mediocrity is you cant be disappointed this will probably be the first game since the texans i wont be super stressed watching
im sensing strong 2015 steelers vs ravens vibes right now
as it currently stands the ravens will go from playing on wednesday steelers to tuesday vs cowboys to monday browns to sunday vs jaguars i just realized that today and its kind of interesting if you ask me
better late than never fuck the steelers
soulja sighting
oh boy that ol
who tf is luke wilson lol
for what its worth luke willson was a fan favorite with seahawks fans
looks like pre snap movement there
awww poor bens helmet is too cold
i mean it could have been worse lol were gonna need our d and special teams to come up big
god i hate that fucking walrus
everybody knew that was a pass right away roman is so predictable
omg whats up with that annoying lady screaming
this is honestly the weirdest ive ever felt watching football
a line up of whining bitches the steelers o that is
good recovery mp
i can be creative with the offense watch heres some screens greg roman probably
come on peters keep it up
big ben looks like a bum although a well fed one
hell yeah
derek wolfe deserves a shoutout man he has been stellar with campbell out
yea bowser
good even if we lose this game fucking plaster bens ass
we didnt concede on first posession hype
doesnt look that bad so far
hey we made a stop lmao
would you look at that flags already
im at work and missed the opening drive how did rg3 look
can they please get dez going
we need to crank up dez
kill me now
what the fuck
put in trace
i dont think i can watch this game just holy shit its gonna be like watching a triple homicide at a old folks orgy
lmfao what was that
the good thing about having no expectations is that we cant be disappointed
there has never been a more predicable turnover than that in the history of football
it was fun while it lasted
maybe we shouldnt be running option plays with our backup qb and rb after not being able to practice for a week and half
no one is even fucking trying what a bullshit ass game lol
marlon has sucked dick tackling last few games
how about they call that hold on bowser
yall arent fun im leaving
steelers catch a break whats new
i really want ben to get hit i want mason in
a stop here would be cool
why are you running that out bro
bowser int baby
bowser playing so fucking well this season give him some of judons money
defense came to play
good guy king koopa giving the offense a few extra yards to work with
get the fuck off the field
67 iq smooth brain return to the 6
lololol but take the touchback u aint ed reed
the defense holds no points for pittsburgh although tyus bowser should have stayed in the end zone after the pick
bowser kneel next time bro
cant wait to hear ebron talking more shit fucking bum
huge statement by the defense
good shit id like to see him have the wherewithal to stay in the end zone but all is good
defense is playing awesome hopefully we can make something happen on this drive
yeees bowser
thank you defense keep it up boys please for my liver
seeing a lot of heart on defense today
you gotta kneel it there but i guess thats cool anyway
nice stop but my god go down and take the touchback ya dingus
what the fuck was that decision by captain fat fuck
i wont judge bowser for running it out pass rushers dont get a lot of picks in the end zone lol
nice pick but why run it out
i know he shoulda downed it but he prob thinking oh i gotta score this offense aint gonna get a first down lmao
i just remembered a piss poor offense with an angry defense is our mo
big ben sucks
wolfes legs are like 6 foot alone
i legit dont know who half these guys on offense are lol
holy shit this defense is so good though can we talk about that
i love rg3
if we dont run the wildcat at some point im boycotting this team
hope the defense doesnt get gassed from the awful offense
rg3 looks like hes going to slip after every step
okay i feel horrible for our defense
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
fuckkkkk
i left work early for this
honestly cant do anything but laugh on that
rg3 jesus fucking christ
rgiii not looking good today unfortunately did i think he was still a good qb not really but this is looking really bad so far
trace time
so whos our 8th string practice squad dude off the street qb
rg3 is awful
nice effort on that tackle to save the pick 6 hollywood fuck yourself you scrawny whore
both pick sixes this year have been when targeting proche lmao
is mcsorley on the covid list
we have to throw the ball deep they arent going to respect shit until we connect on one
this is going to be one of those games where the defenses outscore the offenses isnt it
lmaooo this game is gonna suck
he is just so bad man
this team is so fucking doomed lmao
pain nothing but pain
mcsorley time
missed xp jt gonna win it for us
lol best kicker in the league
sloppy offence defence is stellar tho
time for mcsorley lol
this offense reminds me of when matt schaub was our starting qb
well at least the pick6 came on the 4th pass of the game instead of the first amirite
do we have lamar vs dallas sorry i have pretty much checked out on football since the titans game
fuck me the ass

bob is that bad
lol fuck me man two straight tos by rob
boswell lmao
so its gonna be a game of whos the worst quarterback today im gonna need more alcohol
missed the kick small victories
rg3 is fucking terrible
lol boswell
lol boswell fucking sucks
this feels like the most ravens vs steelers game ever
i think if anything this game will prove to edc that we need a new backup for next season
boswell is trash
damn boys looks like this game is a way too big for rg3

hes acting like he has no idea where he is
throw it on a line
i feel for you guys ravens fans as a niners fan having a backup qb throw a boneheaded pick is all too familiar this season
is trace back yet
jeff freaking driskel tore this d a new asshole and almost beat them and rgiii out here looking like nate peterman
that flag was was so late no one was even moving anymore and yet no call on ebron
will they even cross the 50 today
ref ball starts quick
not sure why they made time for a week 18 game and didnt use it for the perfect situation fuck the nfl straight up
the only team in the league that can hold strikes again
you got to have a better backup qb than rg3 this dude is horrible
this season dont count guys
just when we dont need the refs against them
of course we get called for holding but when the steelers hold right in front of a ref they dont call it
hes so bad
take him out
add backup qb to our list of needs this offseason
who tf calls a running play on 3rd and 23
hey were punting huge improvement
how can refs be so consistently bad its mind blowing
i hope rg3 gets a hang nail or something and cant play

the least serious injury possible
ray ray loves to fumble

source was on his wild ride for years as a clemson fan
lets fucking goooo
just go ahead and let tucker take the fg now dont even try and do anything
our defense is playing an entirely different game right now

nobody tell them
put trace in you cowards
what even is this game
lets go we can get a field goal now
yes i love a justice hill run on 3rd and 23
fuck that you steelers cunts
what the fuck is this game lmao
this is sloppy af and i love it
pad those stats bitch
ok so 3 straight runs and kick the fg
im not gonna sit here and shit on rg3 but sam koch has a perfect career passer rating
this is hilarious
if you dont like that you dont like ravens vs steelers football
offense is only going backwards lol
davontae harris makes an impact on special teams in his first game as a raven lets go
lol who tf is 33 that dude was fast as fuck
flagflagflagflagflag
just kick the fg now before penalties back out of fg range
i just want to say i went to the store and bought whippets

we intercepted

i grabbed the yellow balloon

we punted and i realized my mistake

i used the purple balloon

we recovered the fumble

ill keep doing whippets and 3meo for you brothers
broken ankles alert
holy shit boys we might actually score
this is what the mid 2000s ravens offense looked like btw
rgspeed
im going to be so obnoxious if we somehow win this shitshow
there you go boy
give me justice like im a wrongfully convicted inmate
robert griffin lamar jackson the third
pad those stats boys
hills putting in effort but why tf are we not going past the line gotta go for yards sometime
keep it simple we can move the ball
problem may actually be romans offense more than i thought the way rg3 looks throwing the ball lol
run the ball 3 times come on
justice hill looking pretty sharp on this drive
rg3 looked like he did some anime kick to that guys head on his way down to the ground after getting hit
playing against the steelers defense in fantasy they need 26 points to beat me and they already have 21
we up
td
touchdown
touchdown baltimore
lets fucking go
i want an rg3 jersey
pad the stats gus
we were competitive for 1 quarter lets go no shutout
we scored holy fuck this is some crazy shit go gus
we need to crush them running all game
new starting center
lol we winning
taking a shot for every ravens td fg 1 deep
man that steelers defense is elite
busflamingexhaustgif
fuck them bumblebees
that pat was scary i normally dont even watch
stop the count
this looks like an nfc east game so far lol
alright d keep feasting
this looks to be a fun defense and sts game
if we somehow win this we can clown them until the end of time
should be an easy one
i cant believe this
the bus that couldnt slow down
dezatqb
now just run the ball and protect our 1 score lead for the next 3 quarters
who would win lamar or usain
call the game now and swtch to rockefeller plaza
big ben is looking scared
dude we should be ready for those pussy ass 2 yard passes he did them all game against us last time
grown man run by edwards
i think we all saw that play call coming on third down
we need to draft a penn state or upitt stud just to piss them off
yeah with the lack of practice these guys gonna start wearing down quick
goddamn elliott and wolfe fucked
i hope derek is ok deshon looks fine just a bit shaken up
the madden curse is real
injuries were going to happen when you dont practice for so long today will damage our season more than just a loss
ravens need to put big ben through a table
im pretty sure jimmy smith literally hurt himself on that play
how do they keep completing these tight sideline wellcovered passes to ebron so frustrating
juju bitch boofer
this is what happens when you cant fucking practice
i ugh dont even know what to say at this point our strength and conditioning coach has fucked us all year with injuries and now covid
announcer at the beginning of the game said we had dbs so of course they have to start dropping like flies
lol
60 yd gus run coming
rg3 pls do something
alright gus lets get going
trace
lol mcsorley time
throw it on a dime please
omfg trace is gonna play
lets go trace
trace you tease
trace mcsorley coming in the next drive after we actually scored a td oh ok rgiii is coming back in if he has a bad drive this time though then mcsorley should come in right
throw it on a dime
you fucking idiot tirico
put trace in you cowards
we need to run and quick pass thats it
soulja
dez was open
i know im late with this but holding pit to a fg could also loom large
why dont we have receivers who can create plays after the catch seems like every good team in the league has those guys kansas city in particular is loaded with those guys but we havent had someone do that regularly since probably steve smith sr marquise brown there should have done something on that 2nd down catch made a guy miss instead he just runs straight ahead right into the defenders its pretty lame i gotta say
shouldve run why did we do one run without gus gro is being a doofus again
man rgiii is looking so goofy out there
drop it lmao
wows there alot of ads
tyre got punked
fire gro put trace in
i cant stop thinking about the fact were probably going to lose the remaining decent players on the team to injury this game and throw our season because the nfl had to keep this game and we couldnt practice the last 10 days
tramonnnnn
put in the goat trace mcsorely
huge hit
buried ben right there
nice play guy in earls jersey
sad
i forgot we even acquired tramon
peters ugh
peters 1v1 is awful
i thought peters was good no shade
this is probably the only game all year where i wont go so hard on the fellers if we lose this one bad all things considered ive been fairly impressed with our guys so far
could we just see trace
nice play chuck
bend dont break defense
throw it on a dime
open field catches and missed tackles name a better ravens duo
hahhahaha ebron
red zone d baby
i love this team
marlo is god
murderholes eric ebron
100sure doesnt look like it
lets see him throw a dime
this red zone d is actually way better than i thought
theres still a chance folks
should be an easy one
please trace
dont we have the worst defensive redzone td fhis year weird how it totally flipped so far today they keep getting to the redzone but we keep stopping them there
okay gro stop it rg clearly cant run the damn option just use them as run plays
i miss my boy lamar there i said it
the same gdamn celebration each time they bust through a practice squad lol wtf is that
if this aint enough proof of how bad roman is idk what to tell you
yessir
okay ill take that rg3 lol
vintage rg3
run at them

yes
whaaaaaaaathefuckwasthat fuck yesss
put some respect on bobbys name
r g speed
damn that was a nice run rgiii
that was beautiful
pad those stats pad those stats pad those stats
damn call him rg33
holy shit lets goo
robert griffin
36 for rg3 holy shit
not feeling bad about this game
imagine if that was lamar running thatwouldve been an easy 6
griff daddy wants a start
is that lamar
rg3 heard our asses lol
man im so thankful he didnt fumble
rg3 my man
no fuckin way lol lets go
lamar is here he just put a ton of padding on and grew a few inches taller
rg3 checking rravens
idk how tf that playcall worked but yay
a preplay penalty on the opposition incredible stuff
it would be hilarious if we got a td here and somehow managed to take the lead again after all this
now theyre gonna call rg3 a glorified running back
how did it take them 23 seconds to count to 12
a touchdown here would be a huge confidence boost
five yard penalty thats first
oh fuck guys oh fuck oh no
fucking injuries omg
shit
wtf hes hurt now gosh cant catch a break guy finally shows up
noo
mcsorely time damn
not like this please
wait what happened to rg3
that is so shitty we were rolling
with all these twists and turns and unexpected shit happening this game is on its way to become game of the year
bob got elastic hammys
maybe he tripped and was disappointed he didnt get more yards
fuck goodell
name a better combo ravens qbs and being tough as fuck
i feel bad for rg3
soulja
honestly i am glad we have rg3 in as quarterback rn
marquis is trash
mark clayton marquis
hollywood is a pussy doesnt play like a raven
im convince the only good thing about brown is his speed nothing else
hollywood i mean marquise can barely beat tj watt
so much for a soulja fuck off marquise come on man
hollywoods gotta lay out for that goddammit
watt got beat on a route and theyre still sucking his dick im tired of collinsworth
justice
lets fucking goooo
justice made up for it lets fucking go
bro got wheels
no justice no peace
hill of a run
give me justice or give me bus
big boi
we are clearly seeing justice served
proud of rg3 for staying in hes here to play
lets gooooooo
who is talking trash about my man justice
holy shit i never did like hill but give it to him on that one

why is gus not getting carries
justice hill killin the steelers once again
justice fucking hill clutch run
justice for all
hurry up you ballbags
justice hill wants a contract from someone respect
i was trying to tell people last year that hill was good even though hes small he has power my only issue is he danced in the backfield too much but hes got the tools to be good
wtf was that
fucking garbage man
that was literal cheating what the fuck
lol cheap af
shit refs
fuck these refs they took their sweet ass time to get set
guys thats just blue collar mt dew football guys s
what a total fucking disaster from the refs and our own coaching staff
bad officiating bad coaching bad playing the holy trinity
nothing wrong with going for a td that close in a game like this but to choke away an extra chance you cant run there until 4th down
utter bullshit
i live the guts
jfc take the points

fuck you goodell
just came here to say fuck roger
not good enough bring in trace the ace
he cant even look directly at the camera while spewing his bullshit lets pray that the leagues negligence doesnt result in any deaths
theyll trot griffin out again but hes gotta ride pine man
i really want this to happen
it couldnt have been more clear that we were being held down that is some bullshit
harbs is pissed i hope we come back and fuck these clowns up
honestly i dont blame the steelers for doing that every team does it but its on the refs for not calling it
i didnt know it was possible to call the steelers for holding
so now your throw the flag
horseshit
shit that should have been fucking offensive pi humphrey only interfered quoteunquote after the receiver pushed him around to begin with
thats dpi

he didnt bar his arms didnt shove him down didnt grab him didnt do anything
i hate this torbert fuck remember in 2015 when the cards runner was stopped by our d and they didnt blow the whistle so he got back up and ran for a td fucking idiot
we need our biggest guy to just lay on their guy for as long as we can can we get siragusa back
how was that pi
imagine seeing this reffing and saying the nfl is favoring the ravens
great job d
come on queen catch that lol
offense go take the lead right now lets go
eat shit you raggedy bitches
yo can this offence score just one more time
tramon has been the best db thats sad and a blessing
bitches
so the refs are trying to give the steelers the game and the steelers coaches are trying to give us the game
our d can keep this up short handed until mid way through the 4th gotta put up points before then
robert shouldve spiked it before ht but still fuck the refs for clock management
their offense sucks
i am way more pissed right now being down 5 than if we were down 21
i have a final exam in forty minutes looks like ill be a bit distracted
jimmy out with a groin
its because pennsylvania is a swing state and they want it to vote to their interests lol
feels like the ravens have had 15 different 3rd and 4s in this game
chuck it to dez plz
rg3 running out here yall
maybe the officials were afraid to delay this game one more time lol
ok cris that was actually a good joke
rgknee is killing it bro
thats a bad call
thats a horrible call lol
i dont think that was roughing yall these refs are sucking tonight atleast that benefited us

the driving rule is so dumb worst new rule
rg3 dont give a fuck
wormley
lets go rg3
absolutely need a td
rg3 is still pretty fast in a straight line
the refs in the nfl are just trash no matter who theyre calling penalties against
hey terry get fucked with your non pf call
why dont we run more of those interior read options with lamar its a hugely successful play even with the backup linemen were running with right now and we did it a lot last year
cause of course it was fluker
damn it fluker
oh they call holding on us though dont you fucking worry about that
fluker is so bad
ref spoke elvish for a sec
what a surprise its dj fluker with yet another hold not that i agree with it but it feels like its always fluker getting called for holding
greg roman why pls throw the ball sometimes
ref fucking ball why do refs call so soft in this game im sure both sides wouldnt want that
koch is goat
defense please score
these refs are fucked how was that a hold and they missed the obvious one on ebron and now missed a blatant offside
not kicking the fg at the end of the half is gonna cost us the game calling it
wtf tucker can make those
cmon d
fuck this league man refs decide every close game
you know this game is going way better than i thought it would
this is a goddamn dogfight though yall fucking steelers man doesnt matter if one team or the other is playing with a weaker roster last year we went to ot with lamar and then won with rg3
greg roman is fucking terrible
why do we keep running the ball on third and long
put in trace
why not just let tucker try it i mean we have been pretty much just stopping them in the red zone anyway
patrick queen is really really strong
no two pictures of ben are ever the same
sounds like bens getting a little touchy in the locker room
we are ticked at ebron you can tell
defense has heart
holy shit my heart sank when i saw queen coming to cover did fatberg not see that
call yall imagine if we had the entire d healthy
say what youre about about peters hes gives up some plays but hes a damn good corner
ill never understand why anyone blocks in the back
here we go with the goddamn flags
peters wow
these fucking penalties man this must be another 100 yards lost
the defense is really going to play this well in both steelers game and probably still lose both times so frustrating
we belee
even the fucking sound man is scared af because the pressed play on the loudestcrowd sound file when the ravens got penalized
after all these bullshit holding and bitb calls on ravens somebody should do a house search to find out how many of these refs have ebron jerseys
heywe should try some play action greg
defense is gonna get tired but damnit man if they can make a big play mannnn
this is some shit play calling at least throw deep and hope for a pi if were gonna punt anyways
were def one dimensional but atleast try
time to lay on the ball every play to get some extra breaths for derek wolfe
remember how we didnt score any points with a 2nd and goal from the 1
how about we try this thing called passing the ball
we need a turnover here
almost a sack fumble right there
fruit punch
m a r l o
thats a catch i think
its a fumble but good challenge by tomlin
collinsworth gets so confused on these plays lol i think its a catch
im praying for a pick 6
peters is out now why are we just here to suffer we should of stopped the count
wouldnt be a ravens game if a player didnt get injured on literally every play
the cushion we give receivers are crazy sometimes
destiny is got us to lose this game everything is against us
2 more starters both dbs in this game so far
success all game by not just blitzing everyone and of course thats what we do and let ben feast on quick passes
are you fucking kidding me
peters looked frustrated shit
fuck injuries man hope theyre alright
incredible play
idk who that db is but good play lol
what a play dam
beautiful play
harris
they had an easy first down to the receiver at the top the corner was at least 10 yards off on 3rd and 3
one again i am reminding my homies here i fucking hate the steelers more than i hate refs but inly slightly hold them to 3 and score on a long drive pick 6 the next from bowser and then shut themout the quarter
bad
watching this team just pisses me off
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuude
half of our damn players are limping around just isnt meant to be this week
gotta make that stop
fucking snell
i think a two possession game might make it out of reach cuz the offense cant seem to do anything
sounds the horn of gondor traaaaaace
kendall hinton time
what do you expect d is tired
honestly defense has played well but rg3 aint gonna get us to come back time to put in trace
how many point have we left on the field
hell of an effort cant even be mad honestly it is what it is
i completely forgot about old town road
this game is done offense aint doing shit 65 we are

i pray that the ravens dont fall into the bears trap of reliving nostalgic sb defensive days at expense of offense
here i am bills fan cheering for the ravens
juju has been playing too much fortnite
its not like i expected rgiii to light it up but even that dude from the cowboys no one knew before this season did more hes a backup but hes still a qb he should be more involved
even hines ward thinks juju is soft
get rg3 out fuck
buster brown again
not enough time for rg3 there
guy celebrating that hill fell down
i dont like justice hills running style hes quick but i feel like he backs down too quickly when challenged
hill falls over steelers defender yea you take that
idc what anyone says im proud of the ravens today
does he also play dirty and hit players away from the play
lets not forget this is like the best dline in the nfl
ill take trace just for the memes alone i dont think hell magically get us a win but them memes are all we have now
most illegal formation penalties in the league
gregs trademark is illegal formation smh
you ever notice we never get free plays on off sides
gotta praise how tough rg3 is
refs gonna false start
i had low expectations for this and im still disappointed fuck rg3 is completely useless as a qb
checked the stats we did not play football today it was some other kind of game
thats just giving up punting here
we should have gone for it tbh offense has done almost nothing today outside of the last drive of the half having less than 10 to go is a blessing let alone 2 to go
the steelers are so fucking overrated bunch of cheap fucks too
why is boykins in over dezzzzzzzzzz
what a pussy move go for it its the 4th quarter
nice tackle peters
tackling needs to be drilled into our cbs
just imagine if we had jk dobbins
game was over once we didnt score after getting to the 1
someone shut that yinzer bitch up already
hog calls again
why cant we tackle
stop blitzing
urgency is underling problem with this team on offense and defenseat times especially the 4th and coaching
why do we need 3 guys to complete a tackle
stone hands
why does our defense play so soft underneath i cant remember the last time a team played us like that
the 5 yard hooks are brutal
thank crap ebron
ebron a bust lol
they gassed
trace
trace mcmktherfuckingsorley
touchdown or get fucked
is in
mcsorley time
took long enough
pretty sure trace is in
you ready for some dimes
trace boutta make a 4th quarter 12point comeback in 7 minutes in his first appearance in the nfl
greater chance of seeing this kid get murdered on the field or a successful drive
throw it on a dime
trace about to get 3 touchdowns
trace mcsorley
we are penn state
riveting conversation with a steelers fan lmao
trace gets us a td thatd be cool
shouldve come in at the half
it doesnt matter if we had fucking tom brady out there roman is calling qb power on 3rd and 9 everytime
that was a penny
jesus

mcsorley is off to a bad start
even an elite quarterback like trace wont be able to do anything with romans shitty gameplan
throwing on a dime
can anyone tell me why you bring trace in now

why not the beginning of the 3rd quarter
late hit
that gets call late hit 910
funny how the steelers are playing backups and people i never even heard of and they are talking trash while winning by 12
imagine talking shit to the other teams 3rd string qb
without lamar we are drafting in the top 5
our offensive is no 1 in most predictable in the league maybe 1b to the jets
fantasy pros notified me rg3 has been benched every shot of him on the sideline is getting more and more done on his leg
at least hes showing some urgency and heart
like let them throw deep roman wtf would you loose
no we have to go for it embarrassing
if this game shows us anything is that no matter who the offensive lineman are the ravens can run all over the steelers lol if the passing game was just a little respectable they would have won hell of a game though
i think the actor luke wilson might be better at football than the football player luke willson
thanks for the competitive advantage nfl no covid starters and more injuries
proud we hung tough as long as we did but we were undone by our offense once again coming away with no points at halftime killer not going for fg just no balls we had nothing to lose we were projected to get our asses raped no imagination to give us a edge just straight up vanilla play calling im happy we played with some heart atleast on defense
marcus peters needs to go back to tackling school
bowser held once again w no call

ridiculous

do steelers wrs normally drop these many passes jeez they look bad
the steelers are playing like they want us to make a comeback
trace drawing these steelers flags like a gunslinger
tracemcgoatly
trace a certified beast
removed
holy shit what a soulja
oh god now the mcsorely memes are never going away
lmao the steelers just let soulja boy burn their asses
good job wr 15
throw it on a dime
what
2 plays 84 yards you can do that
wait what
dropping dimes
trace
holy shit we can still win the game
when hollywood gets in a big amount of space hes a beast but thats hard to get often
still owns minkah
yall love hollywood now lmao yall hilarious
throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin
lmao not only did hollywood catch it but he made a guy miss and didnt immediately go down
seeing him do that to minkah made me slightly less depressed though im sure minkah wasnt really trying
holy shit trace shouldve started
please trace lets gooooooooooooooooooooo
most elusive guys in the league lmao
minkah must hate the sight of hollywood brown
souljah
can someone shut that lady up
we lost at least 3 points at the end of the second quarter that is massive right now
can we put that shrieking yinzer in the crowd out of its misery
pathetic fans trash talking our 3rd string based off of 4 plays against a top defense
anyone think mcsorely shouldve been in all game
coaching staff completely misjudged the situation by leaving rg3 in way too conservative when somethings not working this has been the achilles heel of harbaugh hence why we lost to chargers in the wild card round two years ago and the titans last year his in game adjustments has to be in the bottom tier of nfl coaches whereas guys like tomlin and bellichick have won games outright from in game adjustments
trace mcsorley throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin
such a smart special teams play
11 ps players playing and the steelers are fucking kicking it deep
throw it on a dime to a soulja and watch magic happen
crown mcsorely
soulja sighting
i havent really been able to watch along with the thread today but just wanted to say whatever happens i love hanging out on this sub
pick 6 incoming
nooooooooo
winnable
if trace leads us to victory

jesus
damn fumbles going out of bounds man
hell of an effort today regardless of what happens here
wtf special teams my heart cant handle this i have hope dont crush it so soon
if the challenge is a catch this is clearly a catch
fade me now
fuck they pull me back in just to give up that of all passes fuck me lol
who the fuck is rivers
why did i ever have hope lmao
this is gonna come down to a steelers 4th down that they convert isnt it
damn game
71s arm was outside our dlineman is that a hold
bruh the ravens really started fucking us then pulled out
throw it again dare you
just once can we get one of those 5050 plays to go for us this season
someone should write a book on this team whenever the going gets tough whenever we absolutely need a play or a big stop this team folds like a house of cards understandable this week of course but good lord if this team is not the epitome of unclutch idk what is
its the hope that kills you
they will be talking about the covid game for years
gotta be proud of the guys to some extent
fuck shittsburgh
man they had to give me hope
taunting much
i still believe in the fumble
the good news is they covered the spread
bad news is i didnt bet it lol
he cant keep getting away with this
looks a bit short here
just shy or not
short
4th and a millimeter jeez
that was an odd chain
wait what is going on
no way is there conclusive evidence to overturn this whole thing
can they show the chains again
jesus refs they dont need any more help than they already got
wtf we see its short
this hasnt gone well obviously but at least hollywood has played better
fuck the steelers
numb
fucking cant wait to see the steelers lose in the wild card
but who will drive the karens back to their barn
the refs loves the steelers and hate the browns the browns were closer on theirs on sunday that didnt get called the refs was all for steelers this game so crooked
if that bullshit before the first half ended didnt happen we wouldve won
collinsworth has always been so painfully biased towards pittsburgh
the refs have killed us its hard to ask your backups to beat a team and the refs
juju needs to get popped i swear hes annoying af
steelers fan i want ebron to get more involved and catch everything thrown his way



monkey paw curls
throw it on a dime
like i aint even trying
just a kid from briar woods
im wearing number nine
met coach franklin down at vandy
flip to happy valley
now im coming back and got the natty on my mind
they cant touch my deep ball
every game im scoring
im your favorite quarterback
they call me trace mcsorley
holding my ass
man people really acting like cheering for a rapist to win instead of a team that broke covid protocol makes them morally superior lmao
rg3 fuckin sucks
saw that coming a mile away

this is going to be humiliation of the highest order
nice stop holywood love the effort
i never thought id say this we want trace
fuck the steelers lets go
its about to get ugly
stop trying to strip the ball on every tackle
lol the steelers fucking suck fuck your dumb fucking fans and dumb fucking players worst undefeated team ever
the steelers are fucking shitty how have they not lost yet
holy shit marquise with a catch
marcus peters getting torched during crucial moments
big ben is a rapist potato
that was blatant pi he hit him 7 yards down the field wtf
its bullshitbut ive seen our defensive players do the same shit to other teams fuck the steelers but a lot of blame goes to our coaches
steelers getting help from the refs again
fuck those refs
i cant even be that mad about a 5th stringer dropping a pass
its literally wordforword in the damn rules and every one still gonna act like were at fault for that
mutual respect fuck that
claypool is a whiny ass bitch
holy fuck what a fake 100 team
100 but cant convert 1yrd against the back up squad yellow looks sus af
oline is a momentum killer every game
2nd holding on fluker
can we put in wrs that actually give a shit its obvious brown is a bust we need to just cut our losses and move on
refs sucking steelers dicks
fuck it put me in as oline ill drive there myself
3rd and 20 what should we do

run
thats not a catch
these pia coladas gots me tipsys
i pray we meet these steelers in the playoffs with a healthy squad
trace mcsorely comeback time ive seen enough of rg3 today
lmao juju is not hines not even close
thats my backup qb
so i know we need an oline but receivers 1st round
all i know is the steelers are trash barely winning against practice squad players
did you guys actually expect anything crazy from mcsorely
brown haters lets just ignore that one
i mean this team finds a way to choke every week so
god fuck this bitch man
to think if the refs actually called a delay of game and we had a nother shot at the goalie this outcome would be completely different nonetheless im proud of our guys out there the upset was almost there and im freaking proud
fuck the steelers on moms
eat a dick
every time with the refs
john repeat after me take the fucking points
another steelers game another screw job
the chiefs would be winning this game 280
steelers in bed with the refs
rg3 prob gona get sacked for a safety first play now
deshaun elliot always getting cooked everytime i see him it seems lmao is it just me or nah
can we retire this stop the count joke i feel like it stopped being funny like 2 weeks ago
harbaugh took his glasses off he dont even wanna see this
the steelers are so dirty omfg
humphrey didnt turn around at all and impeded the receiver from getting to the ball that is pi every single time
weird a fucking pick play what a bunch of pricks their offense is all gimmicks and fuckery
soulja
i kind of want the steelers to go undefeated just for them to have all the hype from the media just to get fucking clobbered by the bills or some shit round 1 their round 1 obviously

they got more steelers cock in their mouth
i legitimately have no clue what to expect
no td for ben on the first drive wtf is this bullshit ravens clearly paid the refs off nfl clearly favoring the ravens such bullshit steeler fans rn
throwback wednesday to when steelers fans insisted boswell was on par with tucker
it sucks rg3 got hurt he was so electric when he was young makes me sad
i can not wait to come into pittsburgh in the divisional round healthy as a bitch
we waste timeouts better than any team
fuck you pittsburg
hardly any practice and playing in cold conditions
fuck you goodell
bend but dont break baby
money man marlo
marlo
lmao
good shit marlo
why is justice hill getting the majority of the snaps gus must have fucked romans daughter
fuck mike tomlin
i dont think we gonna score again with rg3 lol
if it can go wrong it fucking will with this team jesus
i wanted to see trace but not like this

we cannot catch a break
roger goodell you mean the biggest ravens fan in existence
marquise cmon soulja
fucking shit refs and shitty as steelers cheating again
fuck goodell
fuck goodell
to the ones that want to see trace rg3 is not great but pulling him is a terrible idea at least rg has 3 years with the team and has started a game in this offense trace may be a good backup but right now hes suited up for like 2 games in his career we had no practice i would not trust him in that scenario
i support the timeout ama
penalty on the ravens for existing
steelers still the luckiest undefeated team of all time
hollywood is so slow unexplosive
i though the ravens were a tragedy

but now i realize

its a comedy
could trace really be worse than this
greg roman doesnt have two brain cells to rub together
yeah thats a catch
lol fuck man ben is so strong you do that to like 90 of other qbs and its comes out like a fumble
bobbled the ball and didnt make a football move before the ball was knocked free
i mean yeah what did we think was going to happen today
i guess that was the stat padding tuitt referenced
we should give trace mcsorley some reps
yep here come all the bitch ass steelers fans bragging about being a practice squad team
this is so annoying im a big harbaugh fan but hes coaching like he has all 1st stringers out there kick some field goals give these 2nd and 3rd stringers some small wins and btw we would have been in a position to win wtf

and the overperforming defense some support
put trace in we aint winning this give him a fucking shot ffs
final
bal 24
pitt 22
trace mcsorely sucks thats why hes not playing
pls put in mcsorely harbs
the fuck is trace gonna do
cut wilson promote mcsorley
if cris sucks off the steelers one more time i swear to god
how tf are we still in this game
ok so its just rg3 then
mcsorley is the third stringer which means he doesnt get any reps in practice and this week we didnt practice ill give him a pass
all those fans talking trash about lamar this year hes played shitsburgh 4 times only lost once we are really missing him thats why were losing
i hope everyone thats been shitting on lamar can now realize the amount of value he brings to this offense
2 missed tackles behind the line just unforgivable the rate we have been missing tackles
bend but still break
defense always plays great for 35 quarters then completely chokes lol
we have 2 strong safeties that are absolute liabilities in coverage
lol and the refs continue to play ball for the steelers but you know the nfl loves the ravens
god that chant sounds awful definitely the kind of female steeler fan i picture
now we see why mcsorely didnt go in earlier he fucking sucks
fucking shitty shitsbrugh stealers what a garbage team beat us by 5 points and then the fans have the audacity to be happy and talk shit to anyone about being undefeated i swear those middle of no where redneck fucks come out of nowhere to stop in between cousins they are fucking to spout their mouths about the dumbest shit ever trash team trash city trash from top to bottom
trace mcsorley throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin just a kid from bryerwood to wearin number 9 met coach franklin down at vandy flipped to happy valley now im coming back and got the natty on my mind they cant touch my deep ball every game im scorin
damn ben sucks i dont actually think this but whenever lamars receivers drop passes it gets blamed on lamar
x200b

we are 20 minutes away from kickoff

x200b

this shall be interesting
i tried to not get excited for this game but here we are
i know were probably gunna lose but i wanna see just one marlo punch on jujus testicles
is rg3 even mobile anymore from what i saw last year he isnt
welp if yall win i win 300 from football pool i had yall before all this bullshit happened other guy has pittsburgh and i lose so go yall
john harbaugh about to make his money today
im not particularly optimistic given the circumstances but hopefully we pull one off
girl screeches in backround
is dobbins playing
been a fan since 96 and will be one till im dead but i dont expect much from us wont be surprised if we get demolished we are fielding a practice squad with no week practice but who knows any given wednesday right ravensflock
rg3szn lets fucking go
damn fellas havent had a game where i dont really care what happens i really hope the outcome is different than what i expect but who knows what will happen hope our boys put up a fight against these weak ass cry babies
was yannick ever positive
time to just enjoy whatever bois we still have out there and pray rg3 doesnt break both his toothpicks
imagine we win boys will this make up for a shit season we had
checking in from france lets do this whatever happens ride or die
so hyped for our ravens to beat the odds this afternoon even if we lose lets hope we make it as tough as possible for them steelers
this is fucking weird thank god for telework i guess
aight lets get this bread
kind of nice to enter a game and the only to be disappointed is if we lose by 40
well at least i dont have to look like a raging alcoholic in front of my family now
its wednesday night football bitch
im getting drunk this game like any game just another day really
x200b

rg iii looks like lamar jacksons older brother
soulja didnt avoid the tackle that time
gus mouthpiece hard as hell
damn that had no chance
wow we couldnt get 10 yards
incoming mp pick six
gotta say was very smart to keep nick moore on this roster morgan cox is the last guy i thought wouldve been out
one thing ive never understood is when the defense celebrates that much why not line up to run a play quickly and take a free 5 yards
so was that a bad play design a bad decision to throw it there a great defensive effort or a terrible yardsafterthecatch effort which led to hill being blown up as soon as he caught that i feel like at first glance he should have known the defender was there and made a shifty maneuver to avoid the tackle and get that first down but im not sure
playing iron man while a man made of glass walks onto the field
are the announcers way quieter than the stadium noise for anyone else
they really tryna pad them stats huh
keep it going pick those off
mp juiceman playing safety lol
nice coverage juice mane
defense lfg
eat turf bitch
mp juice man
wow
jesus fuck offense
they really want the steelers to win
lol how hard is it to not fuck up that badly
pain
lmao kill me
brb gunna neck myself
welp here we go
here we go
wtf was that
pain
pain
goddamn it dont do that
yep there it is lol
ok what the fuck
thats a whoopsie
i was excited to watch rg3 so far its been hard2see
this offense is making my dick soft
hahahahaha fuck gro managing to fuck up the backups
wow steelers may win this 30
well that just happened
christ lmao didnt even get one play
fuck the steelers
that should be the last option we run all game tbh
lol why are they crediting the steelers defence they just dove on a lost ball they didnt force a turnover
cmon d bend dont break
god help us
i really want mcsorley in
at least itll be over by half time i guess
thats enough for me to put mcsorely in tbh
blind fuckin refs
wow pff does not like patrick queen at all
dont care what happens im drinking already just want all our players to stay healthy
how do you miss that hold ref was looking right at it
fuck the refs
well i dont know how we expect them to see that hold it was only right at the point of attack
who else will be drunk before end of 1st
that was a fucking hold they missed
that was an obvious hold on bowser fuck this
good shit defense
look at ebrons bitch ass lol talking all that shit hahaha
of course theyd go for it we may not go over 100 yards today on offense
we got a missed hold already
lets fucking go
big jimmy handling business
good play but what the fuck
i like it d
thats what im talking about
bowser
defense is fucking ready boy thats for sure
rofl
hoe them bowser big ben is ass
lets goooooo
lmaooooo love it
looks like its gonna be an ugly one boys
wow surprised to see ben make such a terrible panic throw like that
lets fucking go
elliot is stronggg
ayyyyy should have knelt in the end zone tho but gotta take risks today
that d lookin good so far
who even was that to
holy shit we did something
good defense so far thats what i like to see
bowser go down you fool you aint ed reed lol
ill honestly take it just kneel next time bud
bowser has had a hell of a first two defensive drives
stupid observation should he have taken a knee and got the ball at the 25 rather than try and run it out and start us at the 6 or so and risk a safety
fuckin stud defense lets go
i know we gonna lose but fuck that felt good fuck the steelers
only thing worse than running it out wouldve been not getting the int
adrenaline thats all that was
lets fucking go beli3ve
our defense is looking so solid right now
someone talk some sense into me i feel some optimism
goodell specifically took an invisible drone and flew that right into bowsers hands

this is why they delayed the game had to invent those drones not because of the whole virus outbreak thing clearly
rgspeed
rg3 is not lamar come on relax on these plays
rgiii looks faster than he was last year
fuck me
why do all the steelers players dance
ugh
trace time please
wow
nah take him out hes scared cant play scared show some balls or sit
lol
pain
can anyone come up with a legit reason for why trace shouldnt come out next series

what benefit do they have playing rg3
that was horrible do we have anyone else at all who can play qb today holy cow
huntley season
what is this shit
gosh can we just pull a broncos and get somebody else in here
this is going to be a long day
this is gunna be a horrible game for both teams
im a rollercoaster rn lol

bench him
2 in a ro won rg3
give me mcnugget
man i was really hoping hed look good
might as well play trace

haha boswell though
imagine not having tucker
rg3 is trash
trace time
only reason loss happened last time was because of stupid stuff like that

not because steelers are better or anything they did jack shit all game and let us beat ourselves
i think we all love rg3 but its been clear since he got here that hes not a qb you want starting in most every circumstance
we should poach the steelers draft scouts because they are really good at identifying talent antonio brown juju claypool imagine if we drafted just one of them
anthony wright wouldnt have thrown that pick
whatever happens no blame on the defense theyre gonna get so worn out
i am here for the redemption tour starting tuesday
haden made a hell of a play but damn its gonna be a long day defense will probably hold up and then fall apart eventually due to being exhausted
give us trace
gimme trace please
this is just sad
ravens have a better chance of winning by just kneeling or punting
pain
who is worse rg3 or wentz
this game might just win lamar the mvp again his is clearly the most valuable player to any team in the league
hold we going 3 and out again
we are literally not allowed to have positive plays this is fucking ridiculous
its still early ravens just get something on offense
our d needs to score the points
wtf keep calling us but not steelers nfl favorite right here
so no hold on ebron but one on that
jesus christ
got 100 on the ravens so far so good
thats embarrassing bozeman
rgiii is not it
the two whiniest fanbases in the nfl are the steelers and the seahawks
this game is gonna be an exercise in pain and a test of loyalty
we are gonna get shut out
good call roman lets not even try shows how much he trusts griffin
without going tin foily i have a feeling the refs will try to fuck us today judging by the lack of a replay on that hold im assuming it was a shocker
dig in boys this is gonna be an ugly day
now thats what we call a kick mary
lets goooo
co

motherfucking

cap
rg3 please get the o a td here
tactical punt
pog pog
a lucky break
what the actual fuck is going on
yoooooo lets go boys
rg3 is like watching a slow motion film
jeff driskel and garrett gilbert played pretty well against this defense
holy fuck this game
great play lets see how we fuck it up
yyooooo
niiiiice scoop
lets goooo
fuck ya
what a moron lmao
gus 4 times lets go
we might score today
ok what the heck
score now
lets fucking go boys
tired of caping for rgiii hes had multiple opportunities to show that he can step up and has failed miserably every time sad
duvernay for qb
lets fucking goooo
theres that karma tuitt little bitch hahaha
i love this game so much lol

were not supposed to win everything good that happens im just v i b i n g
please just run it

dont give the ball to rg3

i dont care if its just a field goal dont let him touch the ball
yes
lol yessssss
yessss
our defense came to play our offense
run it 3 times
this game is so bizarre
wow no flag i must be dreaming
i dont have any fucking clue how to feel watching this game
lmfao this offense
4 turnovers in 8 minutes were going for the record tonight lmao
are you fucking kidding me again with the stupid ass penalties same shit just another day kill me
koch is the best offensive player we have so far
this offense looks like the worse piece of shit ive ever seen ive seen better college offenses
if the o doesnt fuck up too much and the d and special teams plays their asses off then this is winnable
jfc o st puts you in close range and you fucking bums push back ffs
run the ball
lmao rgiiis wind up on a checkdown pass is hilarious
at least we still have our special teams nice job koch and co
oh shit justice lets go
they might make the change at half
1st and goal
yooooo
rg3
look at rg3 slowly run for the 1st
good playcall roman
go rgiii
rg3 better watch that knee that tackle didnt look too good
koch for mvp
please no turnover
redemption time for rg
good shit
at least tyre phillips is back by the cowboys game we should be at like 85 health
oh great digging even deeper into the depth chart at ol now
why do they only have 6 did they go for 2
theyre so slow to the line every play

literally have to get 7 here come on
jesus why do we keep running the play clock down every time
i need a gusbrownbryant td for fan duel
we need 3 gus bus runs here wtf
gus bus
td
fuck yeah gussy
we got this bb
gus bus
lfg
get dez involved xxxxxx
we are winning
lfg
watching the game on my phone bc nbc is fucking me
noice
we actually winnin

call the damn match
lol the still blend in snf
i only just turned it on now and were winning wtf
pad those stats
roman really calling run plays for rg3 when hes our only qb
how are we leading in this game
ayyyyy lets gooooo
we might have our new c keith mills was talking about him before the game as the player that will make a difference
their offense hasnt done shit
defense has barely seen the field too should be fresh
just play chess with pittsburgh today let the defense beat up on that offense and then let our offense just do run plays and drain the clock and make their offense beat our defense from everything ive seen so far this team can win today
give credit to cb devontae harris for that special teams play
this game is a royal clusterfuck one drive that didnt end in a three and out or a turnover
thats such a shitty little play
mcfarland why do you have to go to pittsburgh
can we tackle them hoes
not deshon fuck
not wolfe
there goes the rest of our remains of a defense
back to injuries on every play
deshonoh no
can marlon play corner and dline at the same time
i would have rather forfeited thank you
elliott is a dog he will be fine wolfe looks like he could be questionable just great
aw fuck wolfe is our only de left rn please
im tired of injury goddamn
got anymore of those turnovers
steelers wait the ravens were the trap game

ravens always has been
im not even kidding are we gonna have to put some olbs on the line
no more injuries
fucking christ every play we going to have an injury
not jimmy
i hate fucking 2020
juju cries in fortnite emotes
the injuries are just a joke
i was apart of the antiforfeit game but jesus we shouldve its not worth playing with the condition were in
jimmy no
wolfe
wolfe is a fighter
they need some milk
how about a goalline pick 6 ed reed style
alright hump
please stop them
out guys are dropping like flies
hands team lmao trash
ravens and rg3 have been showing heart so far thats all i can ask
can we get a duv run back
if we win this game im running naked down my street
watch trace be literally god
what if lamar comes out to john cena music lol
trace
throw it on a dime
trace time baby
trace time
start mcsorley
mcsorely coming in ooooooooh shit
trace
give me trace mcsorley
traaaaaaaaaaaaaaace
trace mcsor rg3
is tirico on drugs
put trace in ffs
youre not gonna win when your passing game is a non threat
they cant touch his deep ball i say we put in trigger trace mcsorely
ladies and gentleman a hollywood brown sighting
marquise really needs to approach contact a little scrappier
yeah he took that tackle but after back juking
rg3 bad
bruh take off right down the middle easy pickup smfh
play trace goddammittttt
hollywood got 4 steps in and got planted so that means he will fall after his next 10 catches
i need trace next drive this is no bueno
bobby thinks hes way more mobile than he actually is
is trace activated or is he still in covid protocol
field the punt coward
snell has 3 guys on his ankles and the refs still dont blow the whistle
somebody going fumble soon
man on man please
incomplete
no idea who 29 is but i like him
we need to get a cb to back peters and humphrey up that isnt made out of glass
come on juice fuckin a
its like we are a jv team or playing with 8 players hard to watch
tramon doesnt play like hes 37
you gotta make that tackle after giving up an easy first man
joke of an effort on this drive pathetic
terrible tackling too yikes
did 58 slip what was that
lol they only calling pussy ass short passes
i swear they run the same 5 plays and we still arent covering it
marlooo
is harbaugh wearing 2 masks
why is ben even trying to throw humphreys way so many better options
peters may have the logic but he lacks the heart
ebron the drop king
bend but dont break
were good in the red zone but can we keep them out of the red zone
steelers fans must have blue balls at this point theyve been in the red zone like a million times with 0 offensive tds lol
can we get a first down just one to start
got to love seeing that drop no offensive td yet
red zone d is good means shit when the offence cant score
woof
even if this year amounts to nothing we can still enjoy brady getting exposed
get that outta here hump
2yard passes and soft coverage just gotta hit ben hard with the tools we have dbs gotta play tough and they have when they need to

bob please
rgiii has padme hair and i respect that
weve run the same play 3 times already
cmon dez youre better than that
man the steelers d line is talking some mad smack beating our 5th string o line
come onnnn dez
completely forgot about dez
dez trying to throw them off the scent
rggggg
jesus
these guys celebrating literally every stop short of a first down is getting reeeeeally old
lets go rg3 needed all that
yes rg3 has arrriveedd
jesus
1st play 1 yards
2nd play 0 yards

come on
oh

lort
hahahahahahahahahhaahahah
ah man rg3
fyck yes boys
holy shit guys did i just disrespect the now goat by saying he should be replaced by mcsorley
wowwwwwwwwww
rg3 szn
orlando brown with the tumbling block

lets fucking go lmaoooooooo
dez had a nice ass block
tj watt looking like hes compensating for something in that pic
holy shit bob lol
thought he was going to the house there
gooooood damn
i just called him mediocre too shut me up
rgiii lets go boy
whoops
is that the steelers 1st flag
steelers are such a sloppy team
penalty against them interesting
let that bitch fly
they know they cant stop us with just 11
whatok ill take it lol
rg3 hurt
omfg
lol here comes trace
fuckkkkkkkkkk noooo
throw it on a dime
hold tf up
noooo
ill say this about rg3 hes a good mentor and plays hard respect
dime time
is that the leg that caused him almost his career i hope not
not robert man
nooo
its comical now right i mean its just one big prank has to be
jesus christ
damn just when we start to warm up
rg3 is the most injury prone qb ever
get this man some gatorade coach please dont be hurt
that 1 run broke him

get well soon rg3
noooooo he was havin a game
wildcat offense incoming
were a cursed team
man this whole drive is a metaphor for this season
pretty sure rgiii pulled a hamstring

trace mcsorley time
i have no voice yet i must scream
hes okay
imagine if the nfl canceled this season
buster brown out there
what is collinsworth going to do if we win this game lol
terrible route what the fuck
motion man stood there looking at rg3 lol
whats the point of having souljas if they cant beat a linebacker one on one
i say again nothing but slants for brown till he proves otherwise
terrible fucking terrible
i forget who said it but it was a cornerback when the wr runs up the sideline hes doing half my job for me
hollywood clarkson meme speeeeeeeeeeeed
stop fucking wasting our tos
can hollywood jump for that please that was a great throw damn
rgiii has actually had some really good placement on his throws during this drive
imagine being drafted for speed and not being able to separate from a fucking de and then laughing about it on your way back
greg roman is lowkey calling a great game receivers arent playing up to par
time to give boykin browns snaps lol
justice missed the biggest hole possible

edit and he redeemed himself a bit
ooooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh
hill gets hate but i like him
running on 3rd and forever is working wtf
hill was bookin
justice will be had
gahhhh i almost screamed him into the end zone
what evem is this game
was about to ask why gus edwards isnt in

i guess thats why
good to see jhill is making the most out of this opportunity
these are a bunch of guys playing hard it speaks to the coaches with how the ravens came out to play
hurry up
justice hill for potg
ingram better start being inactive for hill
wtf is this time management should of ran it right after wtf
hill
justice
gus the relegated vulture time
qb sneak
hate it
gus couldnt even get it in
aint no way
thats why we needed a fucking timeout
yep that all seems about right god damn
the andy reid school of clock management
are you fucking serious
game losing sequence right there with this backup offence

sigh
he looked in to me on the first play still dont know why they ran first and let the steelers do that
veteran like rg3 needs to be better and smarter than that
this sucks man
you have to come down with that
bullshit
harbaugh elite coach
gotta wonder if the refs are doing the steelers a solid after all thats happened
thats a ridiculous sequence of events
fuck i missed it what did the steelers do that everyone is claiming was a delay of game
nbc trying to explain their covid saftey
with no timeouts i think you need to pass each time so the clock stops if you dont make it we could have had 2 chances plus a field goal if so
i love that there were like 2 flags that half smooth half of football no cheap pi penalties but holy shit call the unsportsmanlike stuff when it happens
98 was just having a nap
weve scored more offensive touchdowns
goodell is such slimey asshole id have so much more respect for him if he just outright admitted that its for the money
just got off work headed home to watch the second half whatd i miss fellas
nice make up call
pain
refs are a joke
thats the refs saying sorry all is good now pathetic
that was ghost
i said bitch where
dang pittsburgh gonna win through the refs
oh look another flag on the ravens cool
steelers are setting themselves up for a tremendously disappointing end to their season in the playoffs
how the fuck
receivers always draw the pi call apart from ours
tramon williams balling out
int if marlon turns around
thats the difference other teams have receivers that can make catches like that we havent
yessssss
keep it up juju
thats ravens d
ball dont lie
thats why we got the 40 year old in the slot lol
good god steelers are fucking garbage
lets fucking go run it down their throats
i wonder if someone is going to tell queen he shouldnt beat himself up over missing the int there
great stop

if queen catches that pick6
can we please get that td back on this drive
queen should have picked that off
tramon williams mvp
where is bryant dez tell them youre activated and should be used
nick saban would be the last person id think aflac would pick as a spokesperson
im good on nick saban commercials lol
does lamar and rg3 have our longest rush this season
need to start those 5 yards dez passes
22 passing yards jesus christ lol
rg3 takin dat hit
soft call whatever we deserve one
lucky call for us
roughing the rg
bad call
definitely a weak call hate to say it but ill take it
makeup call
making up for the delay of game
ehh bad call
weak call but thats make up for the delay of game no call
jimmy smith done for the night
are the ravens gonna win in the words of rg3 yes yes yes
call must have come down from new york to even it up cause that wasnt rp
cris fartingsturd
take a shot here
jesus are they trying to sacrifice rgiii
gus bus
i dont think that landing on the qb is a foul anymore since that horrendous year for it i dont agree with it but well take it
wat
god dammit man
hold my nuts refs
who is this ref
thats a reallllly bad call
ah ofc a good run sent back by holding
bro if hollywood just liked dove he woulda gotten more
hoooooooooooooooooooooooolding
hey brown tried to do something nice
a w today is the only thing i want for christmas
fluker is the new oher
dont know why they went with hill there instead of gus
i think we are gonna need a defensive score i could use a jjss fumble returned for a td after all his chatter
cmon d turnover here im feeling it
co cap is still here
need a tfl or sack
greg roman needs to be fired after this game this is some pathetic playcalling
weve been getting okay pressure on ben at least i guess
soooooo why didnt tucker get the points
need a tfl
humphrey why you go for the strip and not the tackle
theyre giving us so many chances we have to capitalize
we need yannick to feast
why was marlon not even on the screen when that pass was thrown
lets get a marcus peters pick we overdue
jtuck just chilling on the sideline kickers live that good life
defense i love you give them some help offense jfc
were trying to strip the ball out at every opportunity

i respect it
cmon punt return td tgen go for 2 to make it a fg game
yellow is sus
our defence swinging their dicks around
good stop thats why we dont kick the fg there thats why i dont coach lol
block in the vack
juiceman brought the wood
lol refs
flea flicker
levine with 2 special teams penalties todaynot good
we need to run some air raids for these penalties or something man
anthony levine wtf
oh look another flag
lets go rg3
weak flop lol
this defensive effort got me feelin like running thru a brick wall
if we get a first down or two here i think its time for a trick play maybe a double pass from mcsorley or something
its illegal to block from the side
complete dive on they play no way blocked in the back horrible call once again rewind and watch complete and total acting job that some dumb ass ref fell for
theres some sketchy shit going on this field and im glad the entire league is seeing it regardless nothing is going to be done about it
mp juiceman playing a blinder today
gonna have to start passing now
at this point chuck it down field fuck it
maybe we should get hill back in
regardless i am damn proud of this defense
you cant just leave tj watt unblocked
tyre buddy
ran in un fucking covered wtf
why was watt unblocked
thats a pussy move by phillips on that play
i mean all things considered we really are playing pretty damn well
man i wish we did stuff on offence our defence is balling out
our defense is so good
why does this one score game feel like such an uphill battle come on defense
that pitch could be a good play on first down since they are run stuffing the middle but idk
oh yes yan turning it on i hope
thats a catch
yan nope former oriole pitcher

yanni close childrens songs

yannick
marlon has had jujus number every time they meet
i love love love the punch as much as the next fan but it seems to happen 23 of the time right at the sideline which doesnt help
oh cool mp playing 10 yards off as usual
another slant route caught short of the line to gain but converted
peters is playing his coverage so soft
thats about as clear as a catch can get honestly
steelers run the exact same play 3rd down every time
not peters pls
fade me
why cant we hit hollywood on slants like that
of coursecould be down two corners
now peters is injured lmao
fml
the injuries
fuck
another god damn injury
marlon almost got the strip
just stay healthy and get ready for the cowboys fuck this game
marlon doesnt even pretend like hes going to tackle i get the punch thing but sometimes you also have to play defense
great play
why are they playing such soft coverage i am really wondering if anyone has a real answer
all i know is that when we get the ball the coaches are gonna blow it way and it upsets me that i know its coming
im proud of these boys for showing up today
fucking tackle
looks at that bullshit
ugh that sucks man we had them
if steelers are the 1 seed in the afc playoffs is there a team outside of the 2 chiefs they want to host least for a 1st playoff game ravens easily
what the dick
we got em right where we want em
tackling needs work dont it
come on
this defense cant tackle
all you have to do is contain
lucky sob
please get a pick
more 33 less 29
i fucking hate that helmet down and dive tackle shit no wonder bowser missed
this is where the l comes in
williams aint it
nothing to lose lets see some trick plays or a deep shot or something
i hope juju steps on another flag
i would have had more hope if we scored 3 at the end of the half
i am saddened if wilson holds on we are only down 1 score
idk if roman has something on harbs but we really need to give roman the boot
they gave me hope and my pain is immeasurable
still hoping for a miracle
man 25 passing yards in total today lol
why is the steelers schedule so soft only loss i see ismaybethe bills
ony the steelers could thrive so well in 2020 the fucking cockroaches of organizations ugly effective finds holes exploits everything
can someone forward this to roman throw the fucking ball were down too much to run
damn hollywood had em beat
holy fuck throw the gd ball
how is it possible that gus is splitting time evenly with justice today
just put trace in

he can throw a football
cant win an nfl game without passing the ball
oh good more runs
inaccurate bomb by bob
if we did that hit it would be a flag
another run on 1st down
maybe colon castillo shouldnt be fitted for his hof jacket yet lol
the ravens got set so this better not be illegal shift
um taunting after that tackle
its not as complicated as we make it line the hell up
illegal formation every game
get rg3 out of there the dude is hurt and not doing well anyways also who didnt see that illegal formationshift coming gro sucks
its every play with this bull
you see that vet move by dez tho
well this shitfest was fun for like a few seconds
does gro not know the rules lmfao this is pathetic
its not a ravens game without an illegal formation call
lol the qb whos played one game in the last few years just hard counted you
robert playing the defense like a fiddle
fuck it go for it
fuck it go for it
alualu out here wanting to pad stats fuck off
how are we punting here
nothing to lose really fuck it go for it
this is giving up at this point defense is gassed needs more time
our defense will not be able to stop them again
just go for it
fuck punting game is totaled for sure you have to pull some shit to win we just pissed the game away instead at least we have a roll of the dice going for it
how good is throwing well short of the sticks

we dont have the soldiers today but my god the playcalling has done us zero favours this second half
go for it
i wish we would have gone for it but i also think our best shot of scoring is with the defense lol
defense needs to get a turnover here to even try and keep us in the game

best case would be a pick 6 or scoop and score
tired defense is tired defense
we need a receiver so badly
it takes at least 6 men to bring down snell thats not good
this is game over i think
what a dumb punt
but where are all the tackles
do the ravens not know they have arms
genuine question whos to blame for illegal formation coaches players that are lined up qb
peter fuck off my dude
i feel like whenever someone on offense fucks up drops a ball trips etc greg takes a long ass time to involve them again in the offense
why does this team forget how to tackle in the 4th every week
woah peters back in
other offenses seem to take what the defenses give them our offense seemingly can only execute when everything goes absolutely perfect not sustainable
is it one of the first practices when they teach you to wrap up on a tackle or nah
id love for us to run some passes like that for lamar
he tripped fell got up and got the first wtf man
what the fuck
fuck it all i want from this game now is for a blocker to forget to disengage from watt
all of a sudden we cant cover
i didnt realize throwing this many short passes was allowed
this is going much better than being aggressive on 4th down great choice harbs
why are they playing so far off the receivers
a team who pass abs receivers who catch must be nice
d is fuckin tired at this point offense has done jack shit at this point in the game you can expect them to get run over non stop
trace
turkey juju
haaaaaaaa
trace the fucking ace lets gooo
i wish we had an offence
throw it on a dime
finally made the move
mcsorely
throw it on a dime
little late for mcsorely should have started the 2nd half
traceeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
woah
yeah qb switch with only 1 shred of hope left too late man
the comeback kid is in we remember
oshit trace coming out now
throw it on dime trace cmon ravens
is rgiii hurt
theyre in trouble
oh god its trace time
ya waited to late to put him in man
at this point i just want trace to have fun out there
well smack my face and color me nittany lion blue
poor trace this is about to be ugly never stepped foot in an nfl game and has to see the steelers
i think rg limping is what did it he played a decent game save for that pick 6 especially considering hes a backup playing with other backups with no practice

he earned some respect from me today
lets go trace idc if we lose im happy now
just air out deep balls for pis
rg3 sucks man he just does
told you guys about trace
great pass
trace mcsorley in at quarterback
ok fuck this
yep this one is going to just keep getting uglier and the final score seems like it wont look nearly as close as the game was for the most of the day
not a great start
what happened with ebron i just walked away for a min
ok put huntley in
fuck it lets find dave zastudil and see if he wants to play qb
mcsorley to duvernay i see the future of our organization
can we just supersim
steelers fans arent sure how to feel right now because there a lot of overlap between them and penn state fans
oh so watching him get murdered is the greater chance but by the hands of roman play calling
trace goat
go for it no doubt

the ace
wtf is minkah doing
talk about deja vu
if you wanna win the game then put your faith in number 9
trace mcsorely is white lamar after that run
why was the clock still running trace went out of bounds

edit my bad forgot that clock only stopped w 5min on clock
fluker doing a better job at whining for a flag then getting a hand on anyone
luke my god catch the ball
just go for it lol
just go for it wtf
sigh
tbt to week 12 last year
harbaugh must have placed a big bet on the under
trace throws the ball with a complete disregard for his team being down 12 with 5ish minutes on the clock
time to turn off the game
fucking hell harbs how about some trick plays on st
we kinda had a chance to maybe upset them but refs said no
20 passing yards
thank fuck i get to watch the tree lighting ceremony tonight
obj but dupree in the dirt
teams needs to do some trick plays
they have been holding on the edge all day
im getting a real ryan mallett in mustard pants vibe for the rest of this season not the team i know
people are pissed because we expected to lose this game due to half the team having covid


instead its poor coaching
so many drops
put koch in at qb
add that hard count to traces highlight compilation
put koch in
this is the longest game ever
oh shit
soulja
omfg
hollywood
fucking finally hollywood also throw it on a diiiiiiiiiiiiiiime
hollywood finally caught one yesssss
hahahahahahaha holy shit
mcsorely to brown
hollywood did something
throw it on a dime
soulja
mcsorleyyyyyyy
hollywood put him on skates
trace to hollywood

marquise did something
wow trace and hollywood goats

god hollywood looks slow af please let me see the speed on that
love that play but dont say he was limited to half dozen catches hes been targeted he finally took advantage of that
soulja
hes a soulja
s o u l j a
wheres this been all year
ive got chillls
props to this team we came out to play and did the best with the fucked up situation the nfl and saunders put us in
souljatweet curse lifted
lmfao at minkah fitzpatrick embarrassed again by hollywood
we showed grit this game we should be happy about that when we had basically no chance and we have a chance now its more than the offense has shown the last few weeks i wrote this half before half after td btw
people on here blaming the coaching im sorry you sound football ignorant coaching can only achieve so much i feel like people are really underestimating how bad this situation is for us
in conclusion my dick hard
mf trace mcsorley
i just went to the bathroom wtf happened
3 tos and the 2 mins warning lets get weird
if he can do that the rest of the season marquise can earn back his nickname
throw it on a dime
throw it on a dime
cone on pick 6
whatever that was
fuck all steelers bettors
i gotta put pants on
who was confused there fort

defense needs to show up one more drive
its definitely a catch fumble dont challenge harbs
dude if that just bounced in
another fumble out of bounds
im going to assume that kicking play was all genius to confuse them excellent
how is that a catch
lets fucking do this
get this stop
im so fucking nervous
holy shit this might actually happen
stop here and we win
you have to be kidding me
fuck
oh you gotta be fucking kidding me
fuck
feel like we never win contested catches
pure unadulterated pain
damn you gotta pick that
defense is probably feeling it at this point i dont blame them
how do these back to back first downs happen
classic defense giving up the big runshades of last week
how does that lame duck not get picked
unreal
ok thats it
at least that was on first down
cmon d i belee
chuck with the wrong hand on that
thats pitts wr4 making that catch the main difference between our offenses
i cant watch the game right now why is rgiii out is he okay
uh what
easy schedule
is it 4 or 1 wtd
surely thats 4th down
aah it looks impossible to see clearly enough to overturn this right i could be wrong but i have no confidence in them overturning this
queen whiffed on the tackle but still slowed him down just enough potentially
can someone explain to me what happened there i thought they didnt get the first how tf did they get a first
what song played at the end of the fourth quarter it went like bah baba bah bah like a pop sound
bad referring
that att chick is fine
backup qb is a sore need this offseason
bs spot
you guys are gonna win i can feel it
run run pass fuck greg roman literally same fucking calls all season
the steelers aka hillbilly cousin rapist are the worst undefeated team in nfl history
wouldve loved to see what mcsorley could do in this
that makes me feel a little better
yea time for trace mcsorely rg3 is a lost cause at this point
okay wheres trace
yeahroethlisberger is always good for a couple interceptions

x200b

but we aint gonna win on them offense needs to step the bleep up
im hoping that int was just nerves lets go rg3
harbaugh has to be held accountable at some point starters or not this team consistently is committing pre snap penalties
how good of a guy is ben outside of football
no shutout boys
big play here
i will bet 90 of people calling for trace mcsorley have never even seen him play
i know this team isnt the ravens right now but our secondary is our strength this game and they dont look they good tbh tackling like high schoolers its embarrassing team needs a new game plan for next season
ben just doing whatever he wants pitt has dropped several passes that are right there
wow rg3 is actually glass
is trace even active today
fuck you god
this is why we shouldnt have rg3 run something bad always comes of it smh
how do we f this up
what is that bullshit
those fuckers
refs letting the clock run on us again
fuck cant even be mad at the steelers why are we burning timeouts like that
that last 30 seconds was fucking retarded fucks sake
yeah timeout matters less if the refs dont fuck us in the ass
that wasnt pass interference lol
this defense has shown up huuuuuuge today the old bend dont break defense classic ravenssteelers game
fuck the steelers
steelers run d is laughable
what the fuck are we doing
thats not a catch
thats a waste of a challenge
terrell bonds playing hungry
if youve only scored once and its when you were handed the ball in the red zone and you have 5 yards of passing its time to change quarterbacks
oh yeah show us those cheating fucks
rg3 is hurt as fuck take him out jesus christ
bless rg for playing through we pulled muscle hes got but i think its time to take him out and put trace in hes only gonna get more hurt
punting was the smart move defense has played well there is still a lot of time hope for a turnover or short possession that odds of us getting that 1st down were extremly low
typical yinzer big mouth bitch stfu lol
juju is a nerd
there ya go boys what a great throw by trace lmfao
i disagree about going for it there defense is more likely to get a turnover than we are to get a 1st down on 4th and 10
ooof dupree
we played well against an undefeated team with a mix match of players that havent even practiced steelers should be lowkey embarrassed
the steelers have had a cupcake schedule and end with a cupcake schedule this is the exact same shit as the patriots of old who get exposed when theyre not playing their abysmal division the bills and chiefs are gonna eat these fuckers alive

hope we coughed on a couple of them considering how bad they wanted to play this practice squad
we really should have tried mcsorely sooner
gg lets get the squad back and make a run starting tuesday
bullshit whatever
ben holding onto the game ball post game feels like its his last season
imagine if we started trace week 1
can we blame harbaugh for not enforcing mask rules among his coaches
how much you wanna bet this drive ends in a turnover
im out cant watch this makes me so fucking sad and angry this is what it feels like to be a browns fan the last few years
surprised collinsworth didnt find a reason to suck off tj watt on that terrible missed tackle
how the fuck was that not delay of game
pittsburgh pussies
dbs are playing excellently that dpi call was crap
he landed full body weight fuck you chris you tucking scum
why are some of yall hoping they call this a fumble an incomplete pass would push them back to the original line of scrimmage
refs just handed them the win fucking rigged
fire greg roman harbaugh is becoming more negligent by the day
i expect to lose this one
we need a td here
jesus we already have everyone out how are you gonna give them bs calls
holding flag 05 seconds after the punt seems legit
were fucked lol missed hold my ass they just dont call them
why do they celebrate on literally everything
get rg3 out now fuck
huntley time
put in trace or huntley pls
nice tackle attempt there hollywood
worst part is trace is inactive
huntley huntley huntley
we are who we thought we were
forfeiting the game doesnt sound bad now
just fucking forfeit its not worth it
deshon is fine lol
it was nice having a lead while it lasted at least we did not get shutout
this game is there for the taking
count all the points
peters is useless lol
is peters overrated
defense has had a really issue starting hot then disappearing this season i know theyre stunningly short handed and they havent been terrible or anything but were seeing it again
guys were now down to our 3rd stringer do we still trash the 100 mickey mouse team
for as much shit rg has got holywood has cost him a lot
bro seriously why does this team insist on giving me hope just to crush it i didnt truly expect to win at all but this shit is giving me hope man soulja did you know souljas dive when necessary unlike you your a toy soulja useless on the battlefield
mcsorely better come in after halftime ive seen enough rg3
this is why willson is a practice player couldnt be andrews you fucking buttercup
harbaugh really expected the refs to call something against the steelers
just tuning in has tj watt rolled any of our players yet
hello
even college refs are better than nfl you rarely see college refs fuck up and just disregard rules
here come the refs again
im so tired of these fucking refs they miss blatant cheating before halftime but they call that
football is probably the most fun sport to watch now imagine how much more fun itd be with competent refs or werent obviously biased or blind
defense just refusing to quit 3
holding
you know i feel like not taking that 6 points in field goals is gonna bite us at the end of the game
peters looked like he faked an injury to avoid being embarrassed
good job scoring against a practice squad
juju really flexing hard imagine your best game against your rival is against a gassed defense and practice squad players dude really looking like draymond in 2018 when they had kd klay and curry and draymond scores a 3 when the game is like 12089
its time for trace before rg3 gets his leg gets blown out
when the fuck is gro gonna put in trace rg3 has 25 passing yards 25
gro showing how fucking incompetent he is by not giving trace a chance
full team or not romans play calling has been horrendous in a game where you gotta take all the yards you can get he doesnt design any form of short yardage passing game to counter pittsburghs constant blitzing hed rather run hill and edwards into a wall then yeet it 50 yards downfield
time to go 3 and out
trace mcsorely coming in the game
at least this sub will finally realize that the memes were trolling not fandom
lmao now you look dumb bro
why the fuck are we punting at least go out swinging
luke wilson is a poor mans hayden hurst
a garbage time wr great
reminded me of the stephon diggs td to beat new orleans in the playoffs the corner just mistimed and misplayed it
they holding man
someone just got a mean stiff arm rip
and we shouldve went for 2 on that trace td but whatever lol
it was short
we shoulda just forfeited
hes scared to run thats not a good sign he was looking confident on one run but you could tell hes been running scared
literally still shaking and fuming about the dog pile
lmao people blaming refs for marlons penalty

its blatantly obvious the refs are biased toward the steelers
shit i miss it by taking a shit how did the ravens get 7 points pick 6
did we get a call all game

edit just asking i know we didnt play good enough
even if we lose this were going 115 dont worry
this is it boys it was an ok game steelers shouldnt be happy about this win
hey fellow bird bros seahawks fan here i havent been able to followwatch many afc north or ravens match ups as a quick question what are your thoughts on dez bryant was he a good pickup and can he get better as the season continues has his role deteriorated to a screen receiver for an easy 5 yards

thanks a bunch good luck and go birds
this is a weird ass gameday
tattoo pact
removed
run run screen pass milk clock for 10 minutes every drive jt fg every time ravens 15 steelers 14
outside of dline our defense is in tact corners lbs etc defense can win us this

cmon rg3 stunt on dem hoes
lets hope we make it competitive
this is the deadest ive ever seen a game thread at game time

no pressure today boys and girls can you imagine if we cover that 10 or spread epic lol
heading home from work should be able to join yall around 2nd q

fuck the steelers
i almost cant believe this game actually just started like for real
lets go rgiii
game of thrones davos vernal meme ravens logo on davos face apologies for what you are about to see
i see no free elf starting so im assuming hes out all day which is bs
why have we just now ran a play like that lol
that was a fun play
look at those hands tho
duv didnt even look like he wanted to try on that return
did that say luke wilson like owens brother
look marquise you dont die if you get tackled
soulja sighting
theyre ready for gus edwards
well fuck
damn just fuck dez right
wtf big bens hair
so whats the plan for the cowboys game
luke wilson is my boy from listening to pmt
grrrr
i want big ben in the turf show him what no means
we should just have sam koch throw it every 4th down not even fake punt just throw it under shotgun
not unexpected lmao
omg this is going to be a struggle
mp says nah
mp
i see you juiceman
yo nice hit
good answer
get off the field
hey i just saw chris wormley jogging
zebras are the worst animals
greeeeaaaattt
jesus christ man
its not what you want to see
so much for that
ravens look like straight up doodoo
yikes
bum fucks
dammit
pain
cool
gg boys
this is why we needed to practice
lmaoo
im confused
hold to 3
they really just gave the ball like that
jesus
lmao

i need to be able to hold onto something defensepleeeeeease dont screw us
are the commentators hammered its wednesday not sunday its not even night wut
hey im gonna bang my head against the wall might make this game enjoyable
offense gonna cause the defense to get tired by the 2nd quarter
that fucking disappoints me
remember when we outgained pitt by hundreds of yards earlier this season and still lost because we had 4 turnovers you would think taking care of the ball would be 1 priority
is it bad that i knew deep down in my gut that was going to happen
holding much
an unpracticed team on the road with most of their starters out if the steelers dont beat us by 4 scores ill be impressed
now now people we can probably get one good play in this whole game
tennessee ran that exact play against us last week lmao
if we lose by less than 14 id consider it a miracle at this point
marlon has forgotten how to tackle
54 got held on end so bad cant be missed
i hate ebron so much
great play by chuck
well maybe trace will get in
hows marcus peters looked this season
can we see trace mcsorely after that
im just hoping for no injuries we only have 36 available players
theyll go for it
i thought the nfl office loved the ravens
of course they dont call that
what day di we play the cowboys is it still monday or tuesday now
they have no reason to kick a field goal
lets fucking gooooo
yesss
haha
tyussssss
letsssss goooo
lets fucking goooo
is there a link to the showtime cam
the better our defense plays without bwill and calais the better our contract situation gets lol
imagine if our offense was playing
king koopa to the rescue

bowser and ferguson have been stepping up this year its great to see
rapistberger sucks
take a knee kook
lmao
wouldve loved a bat down but great fucking stop d dont get me hype man


not a bat down but a fall down lol
love deshons energy
told yall only wink the one coaching right
wished he wouldve took a knee but im fine
fuck ben roethlisberger lmao
hahahahahaha fuck you ben
if you arent ed reed please just go down in the end zone
im cool w the pick its okay he didnt stay in the end zone
goddamn it guys dont do this dont give me hope
lol they have a selfie screen l
bowsers really been coming through for us
were not winning this game lol so im fine with bowser taking the risk and trying to make a play
lol why didnt he kneel
rg3 dont disappoint me
rg3 szn
i like the defenses energy early on but ive seen this one before im skeptical they can maintain it for 4 quarters especially with like no practice but lets go if we can make this game close when it should be a blowout by every metric imaginable ill be happy
lol
this man is cursed
truly irregular lmao
u have 2 b kidding
lol
ill play
ok this is going to be pain
ah beans
well i expected them to score on the last turnover sono harm no foul i guess
lol jesus christ
so much pain
missed it at least
dang man
yessssss boswell sucks
lol this game
this team is so cocky beating a team that has 36 active players almost half being practice squad players
fuck me
same play we run every 3rd and short
robert wut
well that escalated quickly
rg3 gotta get warmed up
this is gonna be bad
lmao
pain
welp
it hurts
throw it on a dime
ughhhhhhhhh im embarrassed that was easy money
so can we just call run plays the rest of the game
why is the game in what sounds like a demonic version of spanish backwards anyone else watching on comcast nbc commercials are in english
wish times were normal again
rg3 is great he just needs reps
who tf is even the backup
rg3 hasnt played good as a raven tbh hes lucky to be in the league
dont pump and throw the ball in the same direction without even a look off
theyd be better running gus wild cat than rg3 at qb
god dammit
offense gonna give up more points than our d
we did something 5 yards
devine duveryay
nbc is not showing the game for me wtf
pain
wow the wind knocked him down

so far the only lineman getting wrecked are regular starters loli think
rg3 better not come back on this field holy shit
i hope we make the playoffs and see them again
might wanna look at giving the waterboy a shot at qb he cant be any worse
so we should punt on first down right cause we have 2 turnovers and negative yards lol
rg3 is doo doo
as a wft fan who grew up near baltimore and wishes he was a raven die hard ive seen this movie before rg3 no bueno
lamar please get healthy rg3 isnt beating dallas
but of course that holding isnt missed
who is our third qb
yooooooo
holy shitttt
lets gooooo
we cant get 1 first down
lmao
i hope football team destroys the steelers what a goober lol
if we fuck this up
rg3 looks rusty hope next drive the game comes back to him and it clicks
poggggerres

why the fuck am i watching this game
what a crazy game theres been 4 turnovers in the first quarter haha
so they have two guys who might not have played on thanksgiving and we have none
lfg
get the ball out quickly are receivers cant get any separation
tyler huntley cant possibly be this bad
its fucking hilarious that we clown our receivers for not being able to catch anything and our receiving corp pretty much stays in tact in a team covid outbreak
yessss
holy shit he didnt fair catch that lmao
pad your stats go ahead
ohhhh shit
td or bust here
you love to see it
hahaha fuck the steelers
lmfao
lets go

this is an ugly game but it could be one of the greatest games in ravens history lol
gonna be all handoffs right here
its justin tucker time
whoever that gunner was
i feel like levine has been in baltimore since the colts days
pls run it
yoooo
heres a chance for rg3 to gain some of that momentum
gus run stuff x3 and then field goal if we dont turn it over
thank god
heres what happens when teams cant practice for over a week
we should only punt the ball
clown show
take the lead
run run run the ball
who was it that wanted levine out
lets fucking score
big dick koch
i think its interesting they keep talking about all the steelers that might not of played on thanksgiving that are making plays today
we might see double digit turnovers
yea idk if im gonna be able to watch this game when i get home im getting pissed off just refreshing the google updates
co cap
literally penalty after penalty after penalty
hill with the shift
a smart coach would pull out all the gadget plays they have for this game unfortunately we have greg roman
bro we are shooting ourselves in the foot snap the damn ball
five turnovers in the first quarter holy hell
no turnover 3 points and im fine with that
there we go rg3
rg3s throws are so bad

whole fucking team
can we pls cover the under route
need to press these receivers to slow down this pass game
lol add em to the list smfh
fuck now jimmy hurt
were fucking cursed
so nothing but quick throws but no corner pressing
steelers about to light up a practice squad im done with the nfl this year
wolfe back lol
steelers just dinking and dunking down the field aside from the one long pass to ebron defense just giving em way too much space
awoooooooo
i hate this so much
shit just feel like 2014 man
nice batted pass by marlo
i fucking love this defence
our red zone defense is good

their kicker is worse than our kicker
i guess its true the league loves the ravens and are doing everything to give us a win
mcsorley edit fake out

we really need to stop going empty set lol wtf do they expect
was that soulja that i spotted

who else saw someone on the oline upset
why not block a te and rb then air it out not like were doing much with the ball
serious question how many first downs have we got 1 2

tramon williams smacked benjamin
ben getting smacked
if they score a td here its game guys
our guys are taking horrible angles

rg3 szn
this is really a repeat of seattlewashington from 2012 huh
watch us trade hollywood and he balls out for another team

i just want a wr that can fucking catch a ball
damn hollywood

throw was off target but he was misdirected so easily there
i wish we had claypool over brown at this point
i like marquis brown but i think we have given him plenty of opportunities and its time for the next person to step up
where the fuck is gus edwards
justice picking up steam
justice hill
fuck the steelers
justice
ily justice good shit
justice
thats my guy justice hill
wow good run
out of all the wrs we pick brown
i would like to see hill get more work past this game tbh
justice has spoken

remember when bell would get all the compliments in the world for something like that from collinsworth
hill thrill
get juked tj
just a run mike
hill is quick
go mr hill
my 2nd shot of the day coming right up
justice imagine what buck allen wouldve done though lol
touchdown
here comes gus
punch it in
crazy to think we have 4 good rbs
ive never understood why no one gave hill a chance i always thought he was pretty good
justice barry sanders hill
everyone shut up

no jinxing for the love of god
hollywood would be good if we had a true number 1 receiver
i see you hill
we really need to make this touchdown and be up at halftime if we want to have a chance
what the fuck is happening
what in the fuck
wtf
cheating scum
what a fucking disgrace
welp
of course
great
hate that for us
what the fuck
if hill would have just stretched out
oh man this should be good im expecting a politician level response
im trying to figure out why they didnt spike the ball
so many damn commercials
just when i start to be like eh the steelers arent that annoying they pull shit like that
this better not be late hit
giving me classic raven vibes win on defense and special
fts ftr
bullshit
fuck the refs
here comes the dogshit
come on we all know that the steelers are a soft team stop giving them shit
underthrown ball pi check
got a bad feeling shitsburgh will put the game away this quarter
i cant even watch this fucking nonsense are you kidding me
its so annoying that all they need to do is underthrow a deep receiver and its automatic pi
i motion to not recognize this game as a fanbase
what fucking interference
lol pi how do you play defense
im going to push you past me and get the flag
another bullshit call claypool pushed off him
that was dpi only because he didnt turn around

soft league man
that was a fucking stupid penalty jfc
what about that was pi genuinely asking
our entire gameplan should be to air it out against man coverage pi gets called every time this sport is dumb
we get fucked by refs all the time its so exhausting to watch our games decided by people not playing
i swear man
chase claypool has the dumbest eye black of all time
ok guys lets extend our lead
karma
rg3 is pissed lets go get a td
great job defense
defense
hell yeah fuck the steelers
this is why i love defense
pad that stats
wouldve love to see queen get is first pick
rg3 redemption time for retarded goaline timeout
roberttt
yahoo sports actin up
come on at least a fg here
at least the defense looks good
i will die to try to win this game

rg3 probably
ayyy rg3 taking one for the team
lets get points on the board please
b o d y w e i g h t
is anybody ready to accept that we just dont throw outside the numbers not because lamar cant but because we just dont do it
did anyones else streamgame go black
they bite for the rg3 option every single time lmao
that throw was dogshit
yall must be joking
yeah fluke got some toradol and some pain pills and is loving life
holy shit
might not be a foul but im cool with it
jimmy smith confirmed out for the game
what are these refs
is this the covid reserve ref crew
anyone got a new stream link
i take back what i said before the half rg3 is doing pretty well running the ball
steelers cant stop the rpa
rg3 or 2019 lamar
fucking refball
opepa
run the ball
fluker sucksssss
fluker done for bruh
fluker is such a liability
rigged
hold
hollywood knows somethings gotta happen
fluker the fucker
so annoyed with the penaltys all fucking year
just hold onto the ball
how can you even determine that as holding he was plowing him the entire time
good lord
yikes
tj is the polar opposite of jj probably sibling rivalry or opposite personality type thing
what the fuck
let it bounce one more time
i like the run call to get a few yards for a fg but gotta not have it go for a loss

goddamn where are the slants or quick curls or screens
hollywood cuts inside can get more yac but decides to cut outside to run oob
how big is your truss

is it like the ravens

in pittsburgh playin

ooowoo
thank you jimmy i love you
doesnt look bad but we fucking need him this game
good stop
sit down clayman
lets gooooo defense
lj has been solid today
we only rushed 2 there hahaha awesome job d
i can not wait to go into pittsburgh divisional round i really csnt wait
this has to be the best game our defence has had this season right secondary has been straight fire
mark this down as another game where njokeu has been an absolute 0
hell of a fucking tackle juiceman

defense lets goooo
too many penalties
can we pass the ball now
my guess is we kick the fg back in august when its 40 outside theyre more cautious
can someone pull up steelers penalty stats vs their opponents
im convinced our special teams shouldnt even block and we would have a better outcome on punts
perhaps we could not run the ball every first down
just try to draw a pi flag
i dont think weve passed once on a first down
damn theyre adjusting for our run game and we dont have the offense to beat it
they have that 1st down run down pat they are paying zero attention to rgiii arm
if they dont trust bob to throw they should just take him out of the damn game
wtf
good god put sam koch in
remember when we had a unique exciting offense
not even a light choking tj youve changed
yikes tyree
tj watt copied ray lewiss move
i thought that was a block in the back make it make sense
koch is having a game
jimmy smith is out for the rest of the game
mm delish
he does exist
get the stop
this season thats a catch and fumble
thats definitely a catch fumble 2 steps and a football move but who knows with these refs
juju is one of the best at fumbling in the league i gotta give it to him
i want them to lose the challenge
wack
lets say roman gets blown out who do you think would be next up on deck for oc is it culley he has our wide receivers which isnt a strong track record
2 yard pass after 2 yard pass after 2 yard pass
marlon is literally jujus dad
that dude was so open it wasnt funny
mp again
they need 4 yards ill stand 10 yards back makes sense
dude was way open too
now mp hurt f
why blitz there
please stop playing so soft in the secondary
cancel the season
mp out gg
hes hurt
as if we werent short enough
fun just grand
uh oh
well
i love nfl football
cramp
need to hold them to a fg or im afraid its over
he def tweaked something
marlo read that run so good
dude elliot is playing hurt too just look at him try to walk
no practice to practice tackling issue rears its head again
no practice for 10 days starting to show injuries really piling up elliot limping heavily after that play

tyus killing us this drive
here it goes we need a turnover quick score on next drive neither will happen
5 passing yards lol
well fuck
need to see something from the offense which includes less trying to get gus on the edge
we need a long td drive to let the defense rest so they can get us the ball back
honestly whos better rg3 or ben dinnuci
proud of the way the defense fought today it would have been very easy to just lay down and take the loss and no one would have given it a second thought they did everything they could to keep us in the game and if the offense had a pulse we probably would have pulled it off
i want to believe we will win this game but sigh

didnt the broncos start a wr at qb that got 6 yards passing and rg3 can only get 25 im afraid to say it folks but he aint good
hey happy to see a deep shot lol
do we really need to see his shitty dance again
deepest throw all game was nice to see actually
if we give them the ball back right now its over
where the fuck are you throwing that dude
isnt this a presnap foul
mood
why wouldnt they have declined
rgiii might not be okay
as per tradition
why am i mad right now i expected to lose yet im so mad
man if these refs would just call one of these tackles on hill where pittsburgh tries and rip his head off
go for it or fake a punt
ok just do that 15 more times
why do we have no urgency
3rd and 10 throw a 9 yard come back flaccos gotten a lot of sun
ffs go for it
b o y k i n
need to stop running first down
85 seconds holy fuck
literal reeing
we legit dont even know where tackling is in the dictionary let alone its definition
why didnt we got for it so we could get more injuries on d
come on marlon
lmao definitely down
now thats a quality tackle
hey guys i think theyre throwing stick routes maybe tighten up the coverage a bit
i hate this game so much
get this man off my screen
ebron been having a rough day
watch the fake
ah yes soft zone coverage to try and figure out a way to make ben make a mistake with no pass rush on him
trace szn
oh shit here comes trace
lets see if he can secure the backup qb spot for next season
get a td here at the very least
whats the point of having rg3 on our team
only about 52 minutes too late
been calling for trace since the second drive

gotta laugh to keep from crying show em what you got trace
lets go trace lets win this
thow it on a diiime like i aint even tryiiin
oh my goodness mcsorely is pants lol
lmao he didnt even move his feet
lets go boy make a career for yourself trace
okokok first pass bit of a yikes lmao
oof
get them jitters out son its steelers time
ohhhhhhhh
w o o f
bruh
that wasugly
welp
dont worry 1st throw get the jitters out lol
oof
going for it bois
stupid ass play call
cmon kid
oh no
not the noodle arm
same 3rd and long play again duv on the 8 yarder still 2 short
yuh
uh oh lads
can we please take a shot down the field holy shit
i believe in trace to best the 105 line end everyone who thought it was too low
gus bus with that clutch block
hes taughting lol
trace
gulp
gus with great blocking there
we got away with a holding call on fluker there
i mean we will have him next year still i hope he improves but i dont like where his head is at

it wasnt great but its not like the receivers are having a great game either
can lamar play against dallas
the seed i want is dependent on the steelers seed no reason you know just is
peters cant tackle for his life
throw it on a dime
peter cant tackle or cover
guys we fucked up coaches we should have been up going into the half but the steelers are playing a practice squad so shake this one off and onto the next one plus this season will always have an asterisks to it in my mind 2020 doesnt count so many injuries on every team bc players didnt have the same training this year
who the fuck designed those digital football players lol their arms were about a foot too short
why was rg pulled i wasnt watching
that was good effort by peters he need to work on dive tackling or bulking up a bit though
how was that not a flag lol they threw the ball against us thats supposed to always be a flag
so much punting jfc
bout to pull a chiefs fan walkout
it amazes me how sloppy the steelers have been when they actually practiced for this game
trace playing chess and defense is playing checkers
lamar goes unappreciated he makes a bad play and its draft a new qb 3rd year qb doing what hes done hes a franchise guy pay him
watt has been doing that all fucking game now you call it
a stat id love to see is how many yards after contact have occurred after mp made first contact
dat slide
troy smith or trace mcsorely
what
four verts every play lets go
the mcgoat
hollywooooddddddddp
oh holy shit
lets gooooooooo hollywoooooooood
dime dime dime dime dime
soulja
tbh this is game really makes me that much more impressed with lamar were really only down him snead andrews and 2 bad linemen offensively and we just cant do anything passing wise
go go go go yes
finally
traaaaace
hollywoood did something
what just happened
holy fuck
they cant touch my deep ball
dive forward mcsorley
throw it on a dime
oh my god
soulja
holy crap
soulja
no fucking way
that was a move and a half
lmao get it brown
hollywood cameo
hollywood
no fucking waaaaayyyy
oh lort
and rg3 hasnt blown all our time outs
fuck me
how
defensive rally can it happen
hollywood did something
woot
holy shit what
yo should we drop rg3 and pick up ryan fitzpatrick as a back up
where those soulja haters at
yikes that shrill
pat is key so a steelers fg still keeps it a 1 score game
soulja
and he came back to the ball unlike earlier we can win this game
primetime jeeeeet
thats 10 cents right there
the ace
2 overall on his mut card lfg hollywood
hows that soulja for you you dick suckers yeah hollywood
hollywood is back baby im sorry i called you bollywood
what the fuck did i say about those field goals
hollywood you fucking got the nickname back
you guys need to win for the memes alone
the ravens are gonna pull this shit off
a pick six or more dropped passes we can win and i would love it more than any other ravens win ever
i looked away for 2 seconds and i see hollywood just running with no one else around him lmao
get this stop lets go
uh oh
hahahaha that ended up working out way too well
tucker trick kick rn
thats a great call
what the fuck happened i wnet ot the bathroom and we did touchdown
jfc they had no idea what they were doing
pick 6
great play amazing
o
18 be dropping everything out there jeez
i shat myself
can you give us a break ball pls
wow i cant get over how many fumbles the ravens have had go out of bounds
stop the count the clock
3rd doooooooooown
lmao ben just fucked up
what are the steelers doing
wowwww
dammit
fuck its not over yet though
clearly false start on 76

fuck
call timeout
are you serious
fucking garbage attack on the ball what the fuck
how get sond like that
that one hurts
clark wtf was that knock that shit down
sigh
how you let another man do that to you
i dare them to keep throwing
fuck
they run 3 times or they are dumb
yeah thats game lmao
still terrible at tackling
yeah just let em go not like theres a game on the line or anything
how do they give up that pass and then that run the fuckkkk
big run up the middle happens

huh ellis must be in at nt
shouldve been made the change to chase damn this hurts
gotta catch that man
something crazy could happen
no matter how we feel the steelers are given that 1st down
all the while the clock ticked down
if we stop em we only go 50 yards
who deserves blame of the week besides covid obviously
what in holy hell
pussy shit man played like cowards all game
this is the gayest earth in the universe
fucking bitches
ryan hollinscolinsworth man dudes an idiot
im tired of peters tbh

yes they were laying on us but that clock management and play selection was shit youre coming off an incompletion and call a timeout because you run out of time and then everyone on the face of the earth knew youd run up the middle

lets not blame the refs we fucked up
fucking et3 screwed us with his bullshit he was so much better than elliott
justice hill is just no good
fucking take the 3 points you fucking idiots
thats not roughing the passer but we deserve that penalty
feel like theyre gonna drive down and score i hope not but feel it coming
why is rg3 still in the game lets see what trace can do
this team is some pussies not going for it is some tuck tale ass shit ive never seen in my life fucking unbelievable lack of balls in a game where your playing with house money anyways fucking pussies
surprisingly great d
rg3 about to get off gettin them reps in baby my guy about to show the world how elite he is
the boys are playing with no heart i see some weak moves as if they dont even want to be there
100 100 100 100
thats the game right there why the hell did they run it up the middle
the season wrapped up in 2 plays
i cant stand minkah shitzpatrick brian flores knew he was soft af
can we get a receiver that can draw an opi for just existing have the ravens wr gotten a opi call in their favor all year
321 and you run lol
even if its a catch its a bad challenge
this season is a bust its over
ugh i hate juju
im tired of the trace mcsorely talk jfc
i try not to be a bitchy sports fan but like it does feel like everything is against us
just replayed it it is 23 inches short as they showed it on tv
idc what anyone says wink is the only one keeping this team alive gro is a punk bitch who couldnt make different play calls if his job depended on it
but i thought the nfl gift wrapped extra days of preparation to the ravens to make them so prepared for this game how can a mistake like that occur
rg3 sucks lol every opportunity he gets he fucks up
great effort on the tackle hollywood
thats the same play lamar threw his interception on
rg3 is having a tough time he posses the skill to make magic happen magic is on defense today
fuck you boswell lol
might as well put huntley in as a wildcard
im confused why are we getting called for a hold when they let the steelers go i thought we were the nfls favorite
hollywood could have tackled haden at the 5 ran in with him its one thing to protect yourself but you cant avoid contact entirely thats a huge no for the culture
not only do they play the steelers but the refs too my god

well this may be a problem
have the steelers had this ugly bumblebee uniform all year or is this new for this game
averett bwill calais everybody on the covid list will be back by the cowboys i still expect this team to comeback and make the playoffs
my nama jeff
that sucks for wolfe i rolled my ankle once and it still is fucked months later its a weird tight feeling on the round outer ankle bone

if anyone has had this happen to them please tell me that tight feeling goes away i already dont have a meniscus and a patella acl
dude bro
come on boswell miss it


fuck you goodell
wormley is a steeler fucking traitor
hill isnt bad hes just not good at running back p
receivers got open but rg3 had no time to make a play this is a tough dline to play against
lol 3rd and 10 and youre giving a guy 5 yards of space at the marker what the fuck are you thinking
its not that bad we got a chance
too many cooks
oh good
its happening

mcsorley szn
yall really got me dying in this thread
man we need some tempo it takes us so long to snap the ball
terrible clock management
i cant fking believe it
they will never hesitate to throw a flag for the steelers
gotta headhunt these refs at some point
man the steelers are really doing everything they can to be absolute shit bags this week eh the dead ball delay tuitts twitter comments god this team is insufferable
alright offense avoid turning the ball over on this drive and we can do something
option screen or run up the gut for play 1 which roman special are we doing first
i think its time the players look at a rule book this is ridiculous
the scoreboard makes it seem like a close game
at least let trace throw one pass come on lol
thats gonna be game guys
thats a catch imo
refs gonna screw us over again
thats game
idk who williams is but you cant expect him to cover juju
all good game is much closer than the score looks
juju is a name tiktok users came up with sounds like it
roman bout to show for the millionth time what a shit oc he is
we do we have to lose by giving chase a chance he cant be any worse than a pick fumble and five yards
honestly this has been a fun game because we almost had it if we can get healthy and make it into the playoffs we might do something but realistically its the chiefs conference to lose
rg3 hurt again just fucking put in trace and lets see if we have a serviceable backup on the roster
well thats the game fun while it lasted
teams a joke even with the backups bad bad year for ravens
ive been as critical of roman as anyone but you cant really blame him for our starting qb te1 wr1 rb12 and half the starting lineman being out
fuck it go for it
the only thing this team is above average at is quitting wait till we lose to the cowboys next week yall optimists are something else
to cheer everyone up
oh shit
throw it on a dime
like i aint even trying
just a kid from briar woods
im wearing number nine
met coach franklin down at vandy
flip to happy valley
now im coming back and got the natty on my mind
they cant touch my deep ball
every game im scoring
im your favorite quarterback
they call me trace mcsorley
im starting to feel bad for hollywood today
5 minutes left down 2 scores and were playing like this
holy fuck peters you weak bodied little boy make a god damn tackle
i need a soulja
anyone else feeling excitement in this chilis tonight
when the fuck did catching the ball count as a step makes zero sense
how tf was that not picked
that was a big man catch
false start
game
thats gg
thats game
so no holding for the steelers got it fair game love to see it
go for it lol
good time to remind everyone this team could have had kapernick if fans werent so racist
hit ben in his elbow
its a travesty how much this defense gets paid
fuck these fucking cunt refs
of course its juju the crybaby

fuck the steelers fuck the ravens but most importantly fuck these refs
refs steelers are going to struggle vs this covid team with no qb lets give them loads of calls
welp any hope is gone now lovely
im gonna cut rg3 some slack that was a really good read by the db and for his first meaningful start in years hes facing a great defense as much as it pains me to say it it was always gonna be a tough game
as much as i hate the steelers this color combo looks cool
hey guys browns fan just wondering where dobbins is kids a stud and from my knowledge he should be cleared to play no
can we please see mcsorley out here when will there be a better time
the steelers offense has 6 points what a joke

hines was a decent person thats the difference
btw blame of the game goes on the organization steve saunders and other guys for not preventing covid spread
how was he not touched there
lol minkah cant catch
is mcsorely miss daddy lamar
steelers fan here lets fucking go trace
think he got it unfortunately
we need kaepernick as a backup
im looking at all you fake ravens fans that were drolling at signing this bitch juju this offseason
he was down
something about this game is pissing me off we should lose the game i know but part of me feels like harbaugh cannot coach a team up at all he can coach to the players skill level or bring the team down he doesnt add any value despite what his overall wl is
hollywood too scared to even make an effort on that ball lmao pathetic please trade his ass asap
l
steelers fan here this has been a crazy game
why is rg3 in the league he had flukey good year his rookie year but has been dogshit since
our defense looks so fucking bad
our coach fucking sucks

that was no foul
oh look another bs call

like yall aint even trying
wtf is harbaugh doing
bud dupree acl upvote party
peters is a bitch
peters got fucked there eh

dont blame the refs for absolute dog shit clock management
predictable af
why you smiling man come on
im a steelers fan but is patrick queen really ranked 85 out of 86 on pff
removed
we shouldve done a better job in securing a solid backup rgiii just doesnt have it
is it huntley time
bruh and some of you clowns were insisting on benching lamar for rg3 this is lamars offense not anybody elses
he is so slow
get a field goal so we dont get shut out
im actually winning 10 on fan duel with all ravens except boswell
name a more iconic duo ravens and musculoskeletal inquires
this sub is so toxic
just a theory but what if our guys are faking injuries to slow down the hurry up it would be a smart way to get some guys time to catch their breath
loool steelers
marlon
hump daddy
we need to produce consistent pressure inside all game our edge isnt gonna matter when ben is throwing the ball in half a second
rg looks so slow compared to lamar
vintage rg3
wow they let a big chance go to waste
steelers offense has not scored a td lets go d
noooooo what
bailout play by the steelers offense lol
i guess the strategy is let them inside the 10 then stop
lets be honest that was worse dpi peters just got away with than what was called on marlo
we will take 3
glass and paper bones smith
playcalling has been bad as usual but the team is playing well other than our wrs thats gotta be our focus next offseason
we should have just forfeited we lost 2 of corners for multiple weeks
my sons reaction


plenty of time left
thats their first full touchdown drive of the game all we need is a fg and a turnover lets goooo
im still mad about the end of the half steelers fans having the gall to say that the nfl was trying to set them up and was totally in our favor is the dumbest thing ive seen all season
quick td and we r still in this but no matter what happens im so proud of these guys
have ti go for it
at this point no more excuses harbs
lol dez couldnt catch a cold
im a washington fan just watching for fun and i missed the last couple minutes what happened to rg3 and whatd else i miss something about hollywood brown
trace looking real god damn good right now let me tell ya what s
110

im sad
peters is the worst tackler in the entire league hooleeey shit
prayers up for the steelers they have to play teams that are playing well the rest of the season
hey lets not get our hopes to high guys
no way they pull this off
game
he stiff armed peters so he tripped him
need the defense to get a stop or make a play nahh
removed

yea fake an injury you bum your coverage sucks


time to give them the gregg williams treatment
man we fuckin shit the bed huh
mp talking shit after getting sent to hell hahahahaha
marcus peters out for the rest of the game with a bruised ego

no wonder rams got rid of him

fire john
if we lose this game were not making the playoffs because the afc is just too good this year so whos on board for the tank
the fact that harbaugh didnt just get thrown out of this game tells you all you need to know about the collective spine and balls of this team
he was down by contact
marcus peters plays so soft i legit have a hard time watching and youd think hed get fired up and play harder but nope
fuck the steelers but look guys you dont stumble into 110
no heart and no skill on this team before you downvote please post stats to backup your counterstance
removed
so if big ben is a rapist why is he still playing football
this is our for most of us hometown team that is about to get swept by the steelers a week after getting fucking embarrassed and made a fool of by the same team that bounced us from the playoffs and talked shit on our shield what does it even mean to play like a raven
yo im not even mad that was an incredible throw
let me know when they start trace boys im out fuck rgiii

the return of rg knee
i mean he wasnt playing the ball even a little bit
next time yall complain about lamars throwing i would like to remind you what could be
we have no right to be in this game still
removed
elliot being a vagina
02 against division rivals yikes
removed
if this team had any balls harbaugh would not be allowed back on the sidelines because he got tossed for giving the refs all hes worth this team has no spirit and it starts from the top
just came here to see the reaction to 2 players getting injured in 1 minute and all the other problems going on lol
removed
65
yall complaining about delay of game but the play would have ended the same should have taken the 3 clock management is key and they did not play it right
those damn pittsburgh refs always cheating and making it so the ravens lose ugh shitsburgh right lol bad refs cheat bad

edit quick update wed win if our team didnt get sick this is a fake win thanks refs

edit 2 bet the refs are in the assburgh locker room getting money amirite fly high bird brothers

edit 3 grabbed a cold beverage cheers

edit 4 65 isnt that bad of a record we can still maybe go to the playoffs
hey guys lets brigade the lions sub
sad thing is our normal offense didnt play much better than this
this is classic bob g the third mediocre as fuuuck
justice hill looks so slow and why are we using him more than gus

edit i will fucking shut up then
bowser is just trash
jfc peters is garbage
removed
most of the time you want your backup qb to have some fucking awareness in him what a pussy
peters has been terrible this year
fire harbaugh done with his shit time to move on

can we turn into a sub about actual ravens
so how come lamar cant throw that ball to hollywood

are we using the classic greg roman scapegoat
browns fan here now you guys know what its like to have been a browns fan from 19992019


happy thanksgiving ratbirds
karma is a bitch
the ravens need a new fucking backup quarterback if no team signs flacco to a starter contract next year than the ravens need to sign his ass

if lamar were to god forbid get injured for a season flacco could absolutely step in and win a superbowl for us

rg3 has absolutely no chance whatsoever hes terrible i would be a better quarterback than him
this really sucks lamar is chilling on twitter i get he has covid but he has no symptoms wed be winning rn
roethlisberger the goat
removed
are they really playing this game
removed
fire everyone nownow not later fucking now u know if you get stuffed theyre gonna pull that shit thats on u for that and not calling a timeout right away why you wait for 5 seconds to come off bitches
god this team sucks so bad
i know its backups but holy shit what happened to this offense from last year actually unwatchable
removed
removed
yall really look for any excuse to blame the receivers for every single incompletion
now the ravens fans are going to complain obvious pi isnt pi
sweep
watching this team quit on defense every week and watching ravens apologists give every excuse under the sun week after week is amusing heres the only excuse that bares out this teams isnt good at football and has no heart
okay weve had our fun this game and showed some heart time to call off the dogs we dont need to be winning games this year we need to be tanking for draft position
removed

removed
l garbage

marlon isnt a top 5 cb why does this sub think he is so much
fuck you marcus peters

edit good game tho as a steelers fan we definitely arent an 110 team imo
removed
removed
i bought a bottle of jack daniels please help me devise a drinking game for this monstrosity thats about to go down
everytime an announcer calls a player by number instead of their name take a drink its probably because they dont know the name because they are from the practice squadlol
drink everytime collinsworth compares rg3 to lamar
everytime a thanksgiving commercial comes on
my favorite game is see if i can finish the bottle before the second half
im drinking during offensive penalties and im already buzzed
any given wednesday
cheers

the undefeated steelers jerk fest for 3 hours ill join you on the spanish channel

he does what judon does just way better
my god he has been awful
who will we replace him with though were just gonna have to grin and bear it
is it time


they better bench rg3 boy is garbage


lmao gro still running the same plays
so painful to watch rg3 get his ass out trace needs to start
lmao were about to take the lead in a game where were completely decimated and outmatched chill
sam koch is a better passer than bob
jesus christ they arent benching after less than a quarter of play
all of yall are so delusional rg3 is trash and will never be a decent backup mcsorley wins that 2nd string spot
lol yall go ahead and keep downvoting just wait till the end of the game all of you will see how trash rg3 is he has never been the same since his days with the redskins trace should be the true backup to lj too many close minded people on this subreddit

gus bus picking up where he left off the last time we played them
were ahead

one point more than zero im not complaining

collinsworth is a terrible announcer makes false statements and nebulous comments all the time just ignore him

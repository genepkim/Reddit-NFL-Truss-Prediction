How it should be. We got a great team this year
Not sure what I enjoy more. Steelers number one or patriots not in the top ten

We. Do. Not. Care.
Lifelong steelers fan and I love to see them kicking ass but I can honestly give two shits about power rankings
The Bucs are wayyyy too low. In my opinion it’s Steelers/Bucs top two. Either order.
Honestly surprised they put us #1
What an about-face from last year

"Call me crazy, but this may be just a tiny bit of overreaction"
I really like Sutton. Hope he doesn’t go anywhere
Did we need a third post on this in our last 8 that are up?
"He's a free agent next season, we don't know the status of Hilton, and he just played a good game against the Titans. 

I doubt anyone is looking to pick him up for the rest of the season in exchange for players or picks while also still having to pay him next year or he walks. 

Now that I'm home and not distracted with radio traffic I think it's pretty obvious what this pertains to:

Hilton is likely still injured and will be out against the Ravens. 

Stay tuned to see Sutton back on the field and for what is likely gonna be our biggest game of the season. Peace sign or is that the V for victory?

Trade rumors feel ridiculous out of this. We can use Sutton's talents right now and whoever would trade for him doesn't really get a whole lot in the long run unless they are making a run this season like we clearly are which again... why get rid of a useful piece?

For those thinking about a LB trade Spillane is doing an excellent job thus far of filling Bush's role and while not a 1:1 replacement the way he handled himself against the Titans gives me faith he's gonna hang tough against the Ravens."
"What are the odds they might try to trade him? Honestly I’d keep him and trade Hilton, Sutton is better in coverage and can play outside it would be great to keep both but I think Sutton has the brighter future."

Well Cam posted some cryptic things on Instagram last night. I’m sure you are also aware of the way Steeler fans see something and run with it. Basically they all put their detective hats on and figured out what Can meant and also figured out the “trade” as well.
Why stop there? I think we can flip him for Aaron Donald if we REALLY try
"Did... we need ANOTHER post on this bogus rumor that cannot be made with our cap?

Goddamn that’s beautiful
What's the actual size? Is it for sale?
You should spray paint it
"The emergence of Claypool is likely hurting JuJu's chance to get an extension. Washington & Johnson are serviceable WR2 & 3's. Steelers have a history not re-signing WR's. We need to spend the money on resigning Def players. 

JuJu is my favorite Steeler player since Polamalu and it would be heartbreaking for both fans and himself to play in another uniform, but it's seeming more and more likely that might be the situation. I know it's barely halfway through this season and that Claypool needs more playing time on him to see if this is even a good decision, but I'm betting Colbert is already making plans already. 

It would be amazing if we can get him a Superbowl if he does leave, that would be incredible. What do y'all think? Will the steelers keep him?"
"I think TJ, Minkah, and Bud are all more important to sign than Juju right now. Bud more for the chemistry and sheer motor more than anything."
"Claypool doesn't affect Juju beyond his number of touches. The Steelers always find a way to keep the people they really want. They somehow managed to keep teams together under the salary cap since its inception in 1994. Like all consistently good franchises, they spend to the cap every year.  
  
If Juju wants to be here, which he's been pretty vocal about, he will be"
"The desire is definitely there from both sides, but its just really really tough cap wise.

&#x200B;

Maybe he takes a heavily backloaded deal and we hope to figure things out after Ben retires, but I do not see it as likely.  Give it 20% chance at best."
"I think it's pretty low. The Steelers cap situation is pretty dire looking to next year. Assuming a flat cap (which may be best-case scenario), a Roethlisberger extension drops their 2021 cap hit down to about where the cap is now. You then have to prioritize how you get your free agents (AV, Feiler, Conner, Juju, Hilton, Sutton, Dupree) along with RFAs and ERFAs who need pay bumps. Plus you have to think about who may get cut to clear space for any of these guys and a draft class.

With Washington, Claypool, DJ all under contract I just don't see how they bring him back. Even on a sweetheart deal, there are other areas where they will need to spend money."
"I think Juju takes a discount. He has got a very marketable brand that is synergistic with his status as a Steeler. He might get big money from a low level team like Washington or the Jets but then he would have to leave that Influencer/Add revenue behind. Plus, if he leaves and then doesn’t produce with whatever substandard QB he lands with, he’s likely to be cut and end up being the next Des Bryant. It might be more than we want to pay but definitely will be team friendly."
"I don't want to rule it out, but unless Ben retires, I'd put it at less than 50/50."
"My takeaways:

- the emergence of claypool has no bearing on juju

- calling Johnson a serviceable wr2 is disrespectful as all get out lol 

- I will not be purchasing a juju jersey this year, that’s for sure"
"I'd say less that 10% and that is only if he decides he doesn't want to take his market value or the cap goes way above 200M (which is highly unlikley)

With the amount of FA they have coming and the WR core they have, JuJu is a loss they CAN afford."
[deleted]
[deleted]
"Conner, juju, bud, sutton/Hilton (1 of the 2) all gone after this year"
"Very little chance 

We are very deep at wide and will most likely draft another next year. We are 17 mil over the cap currently , and have LOTS of people that need extended or resigned that are more important than JUJU. 

If juju wants to take a big discount to stay maybe, but even then someone will most likely pay him significantly more for name alone"
"Depends heavily on contract demands by Juju and Bud.

The cap situation for 2021 is not as bad as it looks, mostly because the Steelers have less money committed to the 2022 cap than any other team in the NFL. Lots of guys have deals that end in 2021 and many will be cut or extended and there’s a lot of room to shift money into future years.

That said, it could very well be the case that Bud is commanding $25M per year while Juju is only asking around $15-17M.

I’m not sure how the team would feel about investing $80M per year on 4 defensive linemen. TJ and Bud getting $25M per year would put the team at that total.

If Bud and Juju both ask for around $20M per year, it makes more sense with the other talent on the roster to keep Bud."
"I think he'll come in a lot lower than some people expect. He knows he's not sniffing tier 1 wr money. He just hasn't been as productive.

Then I do think there's an element of him taking a 'hometown' discount. There's something to be said for continuity, and I think Juju gets that. 

The other thing is that he's making a killing in the video game world, so I think he doesn't feel as much of a need to squeeze every dollar out of this contract. 

That said, he's a SoCal kid, and I can see him chasing some better weather. Wouldn't be surprised to see him go to Miami or something like that. 

Regardless, I see him coming in closer to a Tyler Boyd, DeVante Parker, Tyler Lockett type of contract."
"70/30 he stays.  The Steelers can't afford to break the bank, but he's also not a burner/game breaker and so don't really think other teams will blow the doors off in bidding, either.  Maybe a division foe will be willing to overpay to reap the benefits of delivering a blow to the Steelers in addition to getting a very good but not great WR."
"I mean depends how much of a discount he is willing to take, but if I have to choose between tagging/extending bud or re-signing juju... no question, bud."
"It depends on a lot. If he wants WR1 money, then no. If we can get him in around 8 million or less a year, it becomes more likely. We got a two big contracts ending this year and I don't think will be back, IMO, next year. Then a few possibilities and some good options for restructuring.

Player and cap space (per spotrac) this year:

Villanueva - $8.4m 

Vance - $6.5m

Possible not coming back are:

Alualu (35 yrs next year) - $3.6m

Hilton (Sutton emergence?) - $3.2m

Possible restuctures:

Tuitt - $15m (contract ends 2022)

DeCastro - $15m (last year of contract 2021)

Pouncey - $14.5m (last year of contract 2021)

Vince Williams - $7m (last year of contract 2021)

In general, this team is going to have massive changes in the next two years. JJSS could be kept, at the right price, and still have plenty when TJ (2022 season) and Minkah (2023 season) 100% need long-term deals in place."
"No one here can give you any type of *realistic* idea of what is going to happen. Alot of people think they are cap experts because they can go on overthecap and spotrac and ""analyze"" the numbers they see. We have one of the best cap management guys in the entire league in Omar Kahn, IF he's a top priority for them to resign they will do whatever they can to keep him, whether that's extensions, cuts, restructures, trades whatever, they'll do it. He may turn whatever we offer him down, but that's a different story. I will never doubt this teams ability to re-sign guys after seeing them magically create enough cap space for the Heyward extension, they know what they are doing and who they want to keep. With all that said, I doubt he's a Steeler next year."
10-15%.  Just my gut
"I doubt we bring him back. I just don’t see the utility of it. We can draft another young guy and move on. Mapletron and DJ are both as talented as juju rn

Smart money is to spend elsewhere"
This might get heat but I don't really care. Juju is STILL one the youngest players in the NFL. He needs to be locked up a long term deal. I'd much rather lock up Juju then Bud Dupree.
"We don't know what the cap will be next year nor do we know what kind of cap wizardry Colbert and Khan will come up with to keep players they feel are integral to the team's success if the cap is $175M.

For all we know the NFL might go capless like it did in 2010 because of the extenuating circumstances. It wouldn't shock me if teams like the Steelers start throwing their weight around because they've got stars locked in at high salaries and a huge 1 year dip in the cap would totally screw up their carefully constructed teams. Then there is the Cowboys who are over the projected cap and do not have a QB on the roster for 2021 and Dak isn't resigning for peanuts. My feeling is that if owners like the Rooneys and Jerruh want the cap raised it will be raised.

So all of this is to say, nobody can say for sure what is going to happen with Juju. He seems to want to stay in Pittsburgh and I hope he does."
well when Ben is off the books and we have Darnold on a friendly deal.. we can keep Juju :)
"You have major free agents this off-season in Conner, Dupree, Juju, Villanueva, and Hilton. I think out of that group the priorities will be Hilton and Juju. 

Villanueva is as good as gone. Banner and Okorafor will be the tackles next year. Highsmith is getting a lot of playing time to be ready to replace Bud next year. They won't spend big on Conner given how runningbacks are valued in the league right now.

As for Juju, he is the centerpiece of the offense moving forward in my mind. Keeping him, Claypool, and Johnson together as long as possible makes the offense deadly. 

Hilton may have a replacement in Sutton, but I think with Haden getting older they would like to keep Hilton on the roster."
"i dont know, i think juju is kinda important for us. He is still the main threat, getting the Ds attention and giving our other WRs the room they need.
Juju looked way better when we had AB who got double teamed every time - but now he is our #1 wr. 
i really hope we can afford to keep him."
"I think I trust the organization to make the right moves. TJ Watt is a future HOF, he’s a must sign. If they can get a people to take cuts, or restructure their contracts, that’d be great. LB and WR we’ve drafted nearly perfect on for 5-6 years. I’m not worried. I’ll always love Juju and Bud and Hilton, even if one or more have to walk"
"Juju would have to take a team friendly deal, but he's an unrestricted free agent next year. A WR needy team will undoubtedly offer him more than we are even able to."
JUJU the 2020 Hines Ward
"Though I love JuJu and he’s one of my favorites in the league, I’d say the chances are less than 25% that he’s a Steeler next year.  The same can be said for Conner.  Heck, if our experience was a bit more pronounced, I’d say trade either before next week for the right draft picks.  Actually, scratch that, because this is our best chance at a ring and they should keep this team in tact.  The only way I see keeping either is if they take a discount.  But, why would they?  Players are lucky to get one big multi-year contract in their career and their value probably will never be higher than it is right now.  It sucks, but I think both are as good as gone unless Colbert can pull some wizardry."
"They draft WRs too well & his role his pretty much been taken by Johnson, with the Emergence of Claypool, they still have Ebron another year...I believe him & Conner will be gone. We’ll be drafting OL, RB, WR this year"
"My logical/analytical mind tells me to let Juju walk. Plenty of talent at the position with other positions needing it's Starters re-signed or replaced.

Though the Steelers have been very willing to let WR talent to walk away. They have latched onto guys and kept them around. Ie AB or Hines Ward for examples. So the question is do they want Juju to be that guy? If no who will be?

I give the odds for Juju being brought back like 2:5"
I think Diontae is definitely more than a serviceable. He is on the same level as Juju as a wr.
I’m expecting Juju back at a 3/40 deal.
"Well thanks for the compliment buddy. I certainly don’t pretend to be an expert, just an armchair QB/Coach/general manager like everyone else."
"I think he could be traded for value prior to him being resigned. The Steelers have always found value at WR. I'd imagine they feel they can hit another home run in the draft so why spend the money.

My dream would be to pickup JJ for JuJu with a second round pick (gives the Texan's a WR since they traded away Deandre Hopkins and something to draft since they are missing 1st and 2nd round picks)

Doubt this would happen and salary cap would be rough but that defense would be insane. Alualu would be gone but imagine that front line"
Juju is cool and all but all the energy I had towards resigning him has shifted towards finding a way to keep bud after how he’s been playing this year.
"People saying Claypool has no bearing are completely delusional.  Touches and available cap dollars are both limited resources, and a team's third most prolific receiver is not a place you allocate anything beyond the most minimal possible contract.  It doesn't matter at all that they play different roles on the offense.  All offensive skill positions beyond QB are highly replaceable.

It's not that Claypool replaces JuJu.  It's that a second talented, starting-caliber receiver *allows us* the luxury of fielding an elite WR corps at virtually no cost, and frees us to build a team with resources directed to the more important, scarcer commodities that good teams build around.  Specifically, OL and defense.

If the front office wanted to, they could find a way to keep JuJu around.

But a front office that did that would be an incompetent front office, and ours isn't.  It doesn't matter if we *can* afford him.  We simply *shouldn't*."

They were certainly still finding their footing by then"
tl;dr Defense pretty good
"#Ravens
* 27th in Yards per game
* 31st in Passing Yards per game
* 1st in Rushing Yards per game
* 8th in Points per game
* 15th in QB Rating
* 24th in Comp %
* 19th in Sacks allowed (15)

Sacks allowed last week = 3 (vs. Eagles)

#Steelers 
* 1st in Defensive Yards per Game
* 6th in Passing Yards allowed per Game
* 2nd in Rushing Yards allowed per Game
* 6th in Points allowed per Game
* 5th in QB Rating
* 5th in Interceptions
* 1st in Comp% Allowed
* 1st in Total Sacks (26)

This Season
1. Giants - 3
2. Broncos - 7
3. Texans - 5 (Wrong)
5. Eagles - 5 (Correct)
6. Browns - 4 (Correct)
7. Titans - 2 (Wrong)

We're 2-2 on the season so far as a subreddit

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jjrz0q)"
I don’t care who we’re playing. ALWAYS 5.
2 or 3 sacks
I think Lamar will try to get greedy  under the pressure of a division rival contesting them and make more happen than he can. 5 sacks
3
"5-6 is very achievable with a running qb, I expect him to fumble on one of those sacks. Or panick pass into interception."
I'll be the cocky one - 6 maybe 7. I think Dupree is all over Lamar this game.
I think because of how often lamar tries to make things happen with his legs it will lead to more sacks
"I think we see Spillane hit Lamar like hit he caught Henry on the goal line.

4 sacks."
People forget we had his number last year without Ben playing. Hoping they can build on thag
"Sack him twice, but a lot of QB hits and pressure. But that’s pretty obvious."
I watched a bit of the Ravens' opening day game and predicted to my buddies that Lamar would get injured by the middle of the season by running too recklessly. What week is it again?
I can't take it. Can we just play this game Friday? I NEED IT NOW

"I was in the checkout line last week and seen the new issue of Sports Illustrated featuring TJ on the cover and a in depth article of his sack/fumbles. So, obviously, I bought it.(Pretty good read btw, just wish they included more of their talk with TJ.) Anyways, couple days later we played the Titans and he was so close to getting the ball out on his one sack on Tannehill. I know he was probably on the sideline thinking about that article and how he almost got one smh.
  So now, almost guaranteeing he has more desire than ever to get that FF, I am predicting he gets it against Lamar. With the magnitude of this game and the recent article, and being so close last week, he is gonna be hyperfocused! Also, Lamar tends to hold the ball with one hand by his side when he rolls out for a rush, and if I remember correctly TJ was the only player last season to force a fumble on Lamar... (Please let me know if I'm wrong on that!??) Either way, I see us shutting down the run, forcing Lamar to throw the ball or make big plays on his feet. Collapse the pocket, he finds his way outside the pocket to scramble, and just when he is about clear to take off and has his eyes down field, Watt is gonna dive and punch that fucking ball out. Hopefully I'm right!

Extra credit prediction: I'm gonna go out on a limb and say Mike Hilton will recover the fumble. If I am correct on all of this, you owe me a sweet tea, because I don't drink soda. Take it to Vegas folks !"

Wowwwww double the legal limit and basically walked. Stupid shit man
Good thing he didn't have any weed on him or he'd be in *real* trouble.
"It might just be me, but the quality of the radio broadcast has really gone down hill.  Half the time I don't even know what's going on.  Might be time to get some fresh voices in there that are better at describing what's going on."

Crazy that it’s this order too... you’d think Claypool wouldn’t be last in the group having the fastest 40 time... but prob bc it takes more than a second to get that big frame going.
That was like the opposite order I would've guessed
Washington never looks like he is going that fast. Maybe it’s the long legs.
Nice
"This probably has much more to do with how much press/soft coverage they get than how fast they are.
I think that means steelers run a lot of go routes against soft coverage, what is not exactly ideal"
"That’s gotta be coaching, no? Might be one of the reasons the Steelers are able to craft such good receivers"
""
For real though Lamar is a beast but we all know Duck would have beat him if he was allowed in the pro bowl lol
I love seeing Cam come in for the high five afterwards lol
"""But you can tell the confidence he has...""

Just a reminder, you get no points for confidence."
"I remember seeing this live and laughing out loud so loud that it woke my son up, and I got yelled at because he had just went down for a nap."
"I am not a QB mechanics guy by any stretch, but why is he standing so close to the wall? Give yourself a little room to step into them."

Did he return after the contact with Henry? I don’t remember him coming back in the game and I’ve read that he did return and also that he didn’t return. I’d like to figure out what happened.
He wasn't in the Injury reports so he's good
[deleted]
People asked about this on game day and others were saying went back in then. So it must have been nothing serious.
"He finished the game, and Tomlin clarified in his press conference on Tuesday that he had only a minor shoulder injury. He will play this week."
You could have searched for this... its been asked and answered numerous times.
"Just want to say thank you for developing Claypool. We Canadians don't have too many stars that have played in the NFL. Cool to see one do really good. Was annoyed you guys got him but happy to see him do well. Was bittersweet seeing him get 4 TD's that one game. That boy is balling out. As much as it hurts to say but you are a WR factory. He went to a great team to grow and develop. Can't wait for this Sunday it should be a great game. If the Ravens lose I'll be able able to somewhat console myself if Claypool was a big factor. Best rivalry in football right now by a mile. Also, whatever the outcome is should make the Thanksgiving game that much better and intense"
Choke on your Timbits Ravens scum!  Good luck Sunday.
May your players remain uninjured. That's the best I can do.
I can deal with a Ravens fan. Canadians however....you make me sick /s
Take off eh.
I liked Canada until I read “Canadian Ravens fans”.  Didn’t know you guys had such poor taste up there :-)
"Sorry for all the downvotes, the Ravens are our most respectfully hated division rival. You seem like a good dude. For that, I also hope Claypool pops off on Sunday! ;)"
".... 

....

...

nope cant do it

I was going to say good luck on Sunday but even from the deepest part of my heart I just can't. I hate the ravens but I admire you for coming in peace and saying how you care for us. I actually have an uncle (not really he's my moms cousins husband but the two were raised in the same house so kind of uncle) whos a ravens fan so I always have a tough time with this. But I thank you for coming in peace and not trash talking like most Ravens fans."
Not sure if its a Baltimore thing or a ravens thing.  But what the fuck does big truss mean?
"You Canadians are so dang nice dagnabit. Good luck Sunday, hoping for a solid showing from both teams."

Brady is closing in on it too. It’s more of a volume stat of playing QB for a long time than anything else. Ben just got a head start from some of the early bad lines he had
"I mean he said he missed being sore, so maybe this is a good thing for him"
Okay but he's no adrian peterson or frank gore playing this game for years at a much more physical position.
"Got bored of no football, so looked up the Steeler’s past drafts. What are your thoughts?"
This was also UDFA Mike Hilton's rookie season
"Not to mention serviceable josh dobbs and Brian Allen who (somehow) has stuck around the league a bit and is with the 49rs

Edit: Brian Allen was actually released by the 49rs on October 27th R.I.P."
"Over 2016!? Artie Burns, Jerald Hawkins, Travis Feeney.... woooooof

In all seriousness, only rival draft year to 2017 in the 10’s would be have to be 2010: Pouncey, Sanders, and Brown. And I’d def take 2017 over that... you know, having seen the evolution of MBC and all."
Man this made me look up other drafts and if bud didn’t turn into what he did 2015 would’ve been a horrid one.
"yeah, Cobert is the most underrated G.M. maybe in sports history. The guy has gone through multiple rebuilds built two SB winners with two different coaches and while several players carried over, many were different. And we've always been one of the best teams during his whole reign, up there with NE, GB, and NYG these past 20 years."
[deleted]
And just think so many poeple thought tj was a reach.
"crazy to think we only got TJ Watt a few seasons ago, he’s the best player on our defense this season"
This latest draft might rival this one in a few years
Who the fuck is James Connor and why do so many steelers fans bring him up in this sub?
We drafted Sutton before Conner?  TIL
"We also got dobbs that year. Serviceable backup, and imo could be valuable to us in the next few years whenever ben decides to hang em up"
"3 years, 20 TD and people still can get James Conner name right"
"In the 2010's?  Most likely.

All time?  Still 1974, no contest."
The disrespect to Colin Hobra
And the Cowboys passed on Watt. Hell the Packers could have used him too
Not even close. Best draft in NFL history not only Steelers was the 74 Steelers

"TL;DR: We now have 4 receivers, and are confident sending Claypool, Johnson, and Washington deep. We now put Juju on short routes, which doesn’t give him as many yards."
we are 6-0 I am sure he would prefer being undefeated rather than lead the league in yards.
Its actually all a secret plot by the Steelers to try and lower his market value a tiny bit to be able to afford an extension with JuJu ;)
"Because we have a ball control offense, Juju gets the most attention, and we have many other options that can win matchups as opposed to when it was really just Juju and AB."
"... because we have 4 good starting receivers, a pro bowl caliber te, and we heavily involve rbs in the pass game..."
"I've said this every week but people saying ""Juju is getting double teamed every play"" are literally just making things up and not watching film"
"Its so weird watching brady and the pats now as i am defintely feeling good watching the pats get destroyed but it feels so uneventfull now lol. And i also find myself rooting against brady even tho the hate is more towards the pats than brady.

EDIT: forgot that they signed AB so fuck the bucs"
"My ill-will is still focused primarily on the pats. I'm actually fine with Brady doing well on the Bucs as long as it doesn't impact the Steelers. 

I'm enjoying the Pats eating crow from not even offering Tom a contract. It's like both sides said, ""We don't need you to succeed"" and we're finding out which one was correct."
"No.  I will ALWAYS despise the Pats.  I'll cheer for the Cowboys over the Pats.  I'll cheer for the Raiders over the Pats.  I'll cheer for the Ravens over the Pats.  I'll cheer for a team made up of Al-Qaida, ISIL, Vontaez Burfict, Benedict Arnold and Jeffery Dahmer over the Pats.

It's Bob Kraft.  The owner.  He's slime.  He's a lying piece of shit.  Everything about him deserves failure.  I'd hope for the first two year winless 0-32 streak for any team associated with Bob Kraft."
"I didn't really care about Brady until they signed AB. Like...fuck that. AB shouldn't even be in the league with all the crazy shit he does, but of course Tom fucking Brady gets to add AB to a receiver room with Mike Evans and Chris Godwin. Plus the Bucs have a great defense, so it immediately makes the Bucs superbowl contenders if AB manages to not fly off the rails, which I personally feel is inevitable but who knows. Fuck Brady, and fuck Arians for welching when he said in March that AB was a diva and he'd never sign him. Just goes to show Brady runs that team right now."
My hatred was always more towards Belichick than Brady.
"For me the reason I hated the Patriots was because of the fans. I know every fan base have their assholes but the majority of Patriots fans were insufferable. So it's still FUCK the Patriots 

Never had a problem with Brady except when he started bitching when things didn't go his way. 

But it fuck the Bucs because they signed AB even though I have no issue with Brady or Bruce (Bruce was cool he just didn't believe in an offensive line 😂)"
"No I still hate both of them
Brady being on the Bucs gives me one other team to look for in the scores on Sunday and hope for a loss"
I hate Brady and the Patriots the same.
I feel whatever my feelings are with no regard to what this sub wants me to think or feel. I hate Brady and the Patriots. I hate them even moreso now that Brady is gone and everyone and their mother in new england is suddenly fans of two nfl teams.
Hate the Patriots... fuck Brady and Bellichunk... pity for Cam... seems bleh since covid.  I still want Cam to succeed in the NFL... just not 'too' much this year with the Patriots... but enough to get a good deal elsewhere and then do even better.
Depends on whether we beat them or not
[Por que no los dos?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckx_Ucg5a-I)
"For me it was always about rings and Lombardis. I didn’t want Brady to get more than Bradshaw, but once he did, it became solely that I didn’t want the Pats to get 7 Lombardis before us. I couldn’t care less if Brady would win another somewhere else."
"Billichek was always the mastermind behind the cheating.  Also, The Patriots are tanking for Trevor and I always thought tanking was bad sportsmanship.  I certainly hate both but it's really the whole Patriots organisation I've hated the most."
Fuck both of them equally
I personally dislike them equally. Belichek and Brady are both POS to me. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle Dum just work at different companies now.
"Hate both the Pats and Brady.  I also find it hilarious that people are saying Brady was the sole reason for the Dynasty because he's doing well on a completely overloaded team, as opposed to Bellichick having a worst season on a completely depleted team."
"In defense of the Bucs, I always kind of liked Arians. Not to say the Steelers were wrong to let him go, but the Steelers mostly had good offenses under both he and Haley. (I think Fichnter was a drop-off until this year, and I'm wondering how much credit Matt Canada gets for that)

Also they have Byron Leftwich as their OC. 

I still hate don't like Brady (definitely participated in cheating), but I'm more excited to see the Pats lose than the Bucs."
"I dislike pats more because I dislike their fans. I dislike how everyone across the country claimed they have some uncle that lives in Massachusetts and therefore they should be pats fans and I hate the aggressive circlejerk that the team can literally do no wrong when it’s now perfectly clear that without the goat they are a pretty terrible team. I hope the bills and dolphins crush them for years to come

That said, I like Bill more than I like Brady because I respect bills focus on football and the organization he can build. Brady is the goat for sure but he’s also kinda a moron, and I’m basing that on his TB12 pseudo science and his AB infatuation. I think it’s really curious that he wanted AB so badly and i think it says a lot about how much he cares about team culture and what goes into building a team beyond just what he can do on offense. I think that’s a short sighted move that is gonna blow up in their faces and they did it for pretty much no reason

Lastly, I like Bruce Arians a lot so I can’t hate the Bucs more than the Pats"
"Hate the Patriots forever. Hate Brady forever. Hate Gronk forever.

Just can't hate AB, no matter how I try...."
Both. Fuck those guys.
why not hate both!
Fuck both at all times
The franchise was more complicit in their first major cheating scandal. The star QB was more complicit in their second major cheating scandal. Fuck em both.
"That's easy, I still hate the Patriots and now hate the Bucs."
"As long as Kraft is the owner and they have an unwashed pile of laundry as a head coach, the Pats can go fuck themselves."
I hate both but with less vengence. Like I hated the Patriots soo much that I hated them more than the Ravens (I started watching when it was the Brady-Belicheck era and the Ravens were always good but the Pats were just better) and now I hate both the Pats and Brady over the Bengals but I hate the Browns and Ravens more.
Fuck Tom Brady. He is overrated and I will never cheer for him at all. The pats are now a neutral team to me cause I still respect Billicheck. But fuck Tom Brady
Yes
I still hate both Brady and the Pats. But Belicheck has me so psychologically tormented that I almost feel like this season is going 100% according to plan for him and it’s all part of a much larger plan. Idk what that could even possibly be but I I’m worried lol.
I hate the Pats and all Boston sports in general. Don’t really care about Brady either way really. In fact since his success make the Pats look worse I’m almost rooting for him to keep winning while his old team keeps losing.
"No, it'll take me at least a solid decade or two of them being complete bottom-feeders before I stop hating the Pats."
"I hate the franchise, the fans, the owner, even the damn stadium. Without a single second thought, the Pat's are the most entitled spoiled rotten team in the NFL."
"No, I wouldn't piss out the flames."
"""Everyone loves an underdog"" so the opposite of that applies when it comes to Brady and Belichick. I respect Bill, he's a great coach and I enjoy his personality. Brady is dorky but he's a genuine hard-working guy, he was a low draft and fought his way to the top.  The problem is that Tom has been so successful for so long it's satisfying to see him lose and now that he's doing great in Tampa it's even worse cause it's like ""hey can you not be so fucking good?""  Good to see Pats sucking ass."
"We absolutely DO NOT hate the patriots and Brady less now.  Fuck Brady, Gronk and AB.  Fuck Belichick and his sorry ass 2-4 record.  No mercy, no forgiveness."
I hate Bellicheat and Kraft as much as I hate Brady.
We are all learning: It has always been Brady.
"At some point you have to stand in awe at a 43 y/o still playing like he’s in his 20s. There’s nothing to stand in awe at with the Patriots right now though, so fuck em. I think it’s hilarious that Brady is playing at a ridiculously high level and the Pats are a bunch of nobodies atm. I’m not counting BB out yet, but if he goes sub .500 this year that’s going to hurt. Tomlin went 8-8 last year. He had a much much better defense, but our offense couldn’t move the ball an inch. BB should be doing better with what he has."
We are learning: It has always been Brady.

"How's this for a bold prediction...

Steelers beat the Ravens this week. Next week is Dallas, and much like Gurley's TD, I don't think the Steelers would lose if they tried. The following week is a division game with the Bengals, who are good enough to not overlook. That gets the team to 10-0.

Then there is a trip to Jacksonville, followed by the Thursday night game against Baltimore on Thanksgiving. I suspect the Steelers will be looking at that Ravens game on a short week and drop the game to the Jags, ending the perfect season in true Steelers fashion..."
"Option 1) Offense looks like shit in the first half, giving away two fumbles. One by Conner, one by Ebron. Boswell misses a field goal. We come back in the second half only to lose the game on a bullshit DPI call, giving the Ravens the ball in FG range where Tucker kicks the game winner.

Option 2) Steelers stop their running game, forcing Lamar to throw. He's wildly off target, leading to 2 INTs, one by Edmunds.  We get the ball with the lead with 4 minutes on the clock. Dink and Dunk for the win."
[deleted]
"I think this is another Steelers game for us. We're gonna be up by 2 scores late in the 3rd, give up a 72 yard run, get burned on the signature run/run/pass/punt, and not get lucky this time and lose by 1-3 points."
I predict 37-3. At least that's the dream I had last night.
"Unpopular opinion: AB is going to do very well in Tampa and not self-destruct. If his head stays on right and he stays focused, theres no telling how explosive that connect can be with Brady. If he's even 80% of what he was on the field at his peak, its going to work out very well for Tampa. He's too generationally talented to have fallen off that much just because he's been out of the league for a little bit.

If the Steelers can't make it, I don't mind rooting for Bell. It's funny because a lot of fans dislike him a lot more than players around the league do. I don't think he's a bad teammate at all. He's a lot of fun to watch and I think he can still be an effective player for several more years. I don't see him falling off a cliff anytime soon at all. Being a physical RB was never his styles so its not like his body is completely beat up. He'll run over you if he has to but he plays a more finesse style at his position of making you miss etc. He's probably one of the smartest RBs I've seen play"
"Bold prediction: Lamar repeats his 3 INT performance vs the Steelers just like last year, but this time we win"
Cam gets his 2nd interception to reclaim his (shared) lead of INT leader on the team.
The absolute worst record the Steelers should have at the end of the year is 14-2
"Here's a bold prediction for you: bet the over (DK is showing 46.5 right now).

I think the bye week is going to be massive for the Ravens as they attempt to re-set on offense and look to scheme up shots against the Steelers defense. I think we could see the Steelers defense do a good job for most of the game, but they give up a couple of big plays. I think the Steelers offense is going to be able to do the same against the Ravens blitz. Add in a defensive or ST score (not sure which direction) and I see this being a higher scoring game than many expect. I think both teams get 23+ points."
Mason Rudolph finishes the game on his knees.
Lamar has a career game. Bad or good is on the shoulders of our secondary...
IF we are destined to lose  our 'perfect record' (not saying we are but) I would rather the lose come last week than this one. Probably not unpopular
"Edmunds and Minkah and Sutton fill in for Devin Bush’s role in the middle of the field, while fans on Twitter and Reddit demand DC fired for not playing Robert Spillane"
BOLD PREDICTION: Steelers blow Ravens out 38-14. Steelers D has 2 takeaways and one of those 2 will be returned for a TD. Juju goes for over 150yds with one play being a 97 yard td. Dionte Johnson goes for 2 TDs again. James Connor rushes for a 50+yd td.
Steelers win Big.
"Okay, Robert didn't do an INT last game BUT I will say that he can get a sack this game against Lamar Jackson"
"Ravens come out hot. We claw back and then lose in heart-breaking fashion. We come in the next week lacklustre and have to come back against the Cowboys who are fighting for their playoff lives. We take care of the Bengals and Jags and go into Thanskgiving with a 9-1 record against the 8-2 Ravens. We win, basically cementing the division."
"I'm usually pretty optimistic, almost to a fault, but I'm pretty sure we'll lose this one and respond Week 12. Ravens off a bye, at home, with aspirations of ending our unbeaten streak, it just seems like a recipe for a loss purely from a bulletin board material perspective. Hoping I'm wrong, but this is where my head's at."
"I don't see the Ravens as that tough of a team.  They are one of the best teams we have to play all year, no doubt, but I wouldn't put them in the same tier as Seattle, AZ, or KC.  Lamar is not playing like an MVP contender.  These are not the Baltimore Ravens of 2019.  The only scary part of this team is the rushing and the secondary.  We've shut down 3 top tier rushers this year already.  And Ben never turns the ball over 2 weeks in a row.  This is the Steelers game to lose."
We're gonna beat the Ravens and still be 2 in the power rankings because Bell is gonna rush for like 12 TDs or some shit
For some reason and it's a bad feeling I think this weeks game will be a loss. 27-24 Ravens.  I do hope I'm wrong.
"I think the ravens plan will be blitz heavy as always, play aggressive press coverage and try to take away the short pass game. Ben knows this and I think he'll beat them a couple times with pump fakes/double moves by the receivers, especially on Peters who is gonna try to jump the slants."
Bosgod from 53 yards for the win as time expires after a #7 engineered drive with 1 timeout in his pocket.
" jets fan here, i was wondering if you guys would have any interest in darnold and what you would give up for him?"
10-7 Steelers and it comes down to Ben’s 2 minute drill.
"As much as I want to win this game, I don't think we will beat the Ravens twice and I want them to win when I go on Thanksgiving."
Steelers D has more touchdowns than the Ravens O
We go 15-1 with our one loss to the ravens on thanksgiving
I think Bosgod is going to have to win it as time expires. Because it wouldn't be a classic without a last minute nail-biting score.
Think ray ray mccloud has a few splash plays with game. Ravens gonna plus press and aggressive and we unleash his speed to take advantage
"Unpopular opinion: AB will be great in Tampa, and they will be in the hunt for the Super Bowl this year. I rank them in the same category as KC and us now...

Hot take: Lamar Jackson is nowhere near as talented as everyone gives him credit for. He is a running back that happens to be in a QB position. His real talent is the run, but his passing is on par with some seriously deficient QB’s. That said, I am not worried about the pass as much this game. 

Bold prediction: I think we get two turnovers from Lamar interceptions, one we convert for points, and this makes the difference in the game. We come out 27-24 by a hair. 

Also, to everyone saying that Ben had three interceptions last week and they are worried about him (here’s looking at you Cowherd)... If I remember correctly, two of those were crappy tips that just happened to bounce in to titan hands... Ben isn’t making terrible throws like so many people are saying..."
My prediction is that tucker will kick a 50+ yard field goal to give baltimore the win.
31-24 steelers win
Cowherd might be right when he said ben's our biggest weakness right now. He's had a ton of bone-headed throws these past few weeks
The steelers are overrated

I was there. He pointed right at me. I’ve been erect ever since.
I see Troy I Upvote
The man was truly the most spectacular player I’ve ever seen play football. The fact that he was so humble was always the icing. Purely one of the best all around humans in my estimations.
Joe Flacco already turned around and jogging back as Troy is probably like a quarter of a second after crossing the end zone makes this picture for me. So defeated.
"[Here's the full game on YouTube](https://youtube.com/watch?v=qxxjWPeIwxA&)

My favorite Steelers game of all time. That crowd was LOUD!"
"Was there with my dad. That was the single loudest moment I’ve ever heard at that stadium. That game had so many great moments too.

The block limas sweed laid on Corey Ivy (I think) after missing an easy grab was amazing too."
number 43 takes us to SB43
We were not supposed to win that game at all iirc. It was jus tthe Troy show
This was the greatest sports moment I’ve witnessed live by a long shot
I hope so bad it’s Pittsburgh and Greenbay in the super bowl. We want our revenge!!!
"This is that one time Troy said, “No Super Bowl for you!”"
"First game I ever went to. It was fucking freezing. It was snowing in the upper section where I was sitting, not enough to stick on the field. Wind was cranking. Had hand warmers on my balls. Felt like the stadium was going to collapse like one of those soccer videos it was so fucking loud in there."
"This is besides the point of the picture, but can’t believe players were allowed to go without knee and thigh pads! As a player for me I felt so much more free without those pads in practice."
I was there too. Other side of the field. Upper deck. That was possibly the most electric I have felt the stadium. The 2nd most electric might have been Pitt vs cinch for the de facto big east championship. If u weren’t there u can’t pass judgment.
I was there. A kid. Wth my cousin. A kid. When he was still alive. When my uncle still laughed. Would be special to win one again this year.

"I'm so glad we recovered his fumble last week. It was such an awesome decision to give it right back to him on the next play, and he turns a tackle for loss into a big gain with a *sweeet* spin move. 

I enjoy when James Conner succeeds."
Amazing what having an actual quarterback can do for the run game instead of constantly trying to run the ball up through a stacked box that won't have any holes.
He's had some rushing TDs vultured too
"Conner has been fantastic this year. I literally cannot say one bad thing about him, and have ate my words that we should have signed an FA back."
"Feels like he’s finally healthy. Having Ben back is opening up the ground game much more, love to see Conner succeed! Dudes been moving way smoother this season"
The thing I like is that he's not seeking contact like he's a human missile like he used to.  There's no point banging yourself up if you can get up field and avoid big hits.
"That's because there are so many Connor haters around and none of those sons of bitches have much to say since Connor has shut them up pretty good.

You'll see them come out if he has a bad game or bad play however."
Shhhhh if it gets out we gotta pay him
"If you take out the New Jersey game  he is averaging 88.4 rushing yards/game, 4.9 yards/carry and  20.8 receiving yards/game (109.2 total).

Assuming he plays games 2 - 16 at  his games 2- 6 averages he is on track for 1,652 yards and 12 Touchdowns."
you can tell JC30 is playing some angry football this year. i love to see him do well and hope he can continue to stay healthy
"I would love for him to have a 1,000+ yard year.


He's got a great comeback story but the injuries have been frustrating. At the end of the day somebody has to produce.


He's been producing ok this year (so far). Really happy for him."
We’re afraid that if we start crowing about JC30 he will get hurt. We are all whistling past the graveyard.
"Hey, did you know James Conner had cancer when he was in college?

That’s definitely a Pats fan thing
I feel like there's not nearly enough dallas on this map. Although maybe everyone just feels bad for them at this point?
"Right or wrong, I feel like the only ammo people think have against us is they think we give off the ""holier than thou"" vibe. Nobody realistically believes we play dirty, cheat, or other negative traits so that's all they have"
"I lived in Connecticut for about a year and actually knew of 2 decently large Steelers fan clubs. I was a part of one for a season. The patriots and giants dominated the fandom numbers, but I was shocked at the amount of Steelers fans. A lot of people in the clubs weren’t even from PA. Most of them were older and became fans of the Steelers in the 70’s. They thought of me as borderline royalty because I was from Pittsburgh and had been to a handful of games."
Haters Gonna Hate...
CT has a lot of New York fans as well which is why it's not the Jets
They hate us cuz they anus
Connecticut resident here and I bleed Black and Gold. We're not all idiots who follow shit teams over here.
"I mean, the only areas that don't like us are Maryland and Ohio (rightfully so because of our division) Indiana, Kentucky Tennessee (colts and Titans fans) and Connecticut for some weird reason. Idk how this make us the ""most hated"" nfl team. More like, successful against those franchises list. (Colts for that win in 05, and Tennessee, because of the old AFCC and because of what we just did to them on Sunday)."

I love Mcafee. His show is literally the only one I care to listen to anymore. It's not just hot takes and stupid shit. That and Moats and Deke.
"Fuck Pat McAfee!  He got Pete Dunne to attack poor Kyle O'Reilly last night!

j/k Love that dude."
If Pat gave up this just to Punt for the Steelers. He would be the dumbest man alive.
"They're talking about the Steelers-Ravens rivalry, among other things."
Love pat but can only take him in about 30 minute segments
"Dan Patrick was speculating that the Texans should trade JJ Watt. One of the teams he mentioned was the Steelers. This was all speculation and sports talk but could the Steelers benefit from having JJ on that D? If so, what type of draft capital are we willing to give up??"
"Doesn't make sense given the cap and the fact that every member of the line is playing at a higher level of ball than he is. Even if we could pay him, it doesn't make sense for someone who would only be a rotation player."
Steelers need to focus on singing TJ first. I don’t know how bringing in a 17 million dollar contract to an aging player helps that. I’d love to see JJ in a Steelers uniform if he hits free agency free next year though
Realistically it wouldn’t cost much at all to acquire him but we would need to work some real magic with restructuring contracts.
"Who would you play him over... Tuitt or Heyward?  Gonna have him play or split with TJ or Dupree?  Maybe try to convert him into Bush's spot?

Only 1 of those 5 is even a weakness... and it's a stretch to trade to hopefully convert him position wise.  

I'd still love all 3 Watts because why the fuck not, but it just doesnt make sense at this time."
We have players that are better than him already in that position
"If we have all three..

And I use my combine card....

Would we get Godzilla with lightning breath?

TOTAL AND COMPLETE WATTAGE!!!!!"
"NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN

Steelers don't have the rest of his 15M 2020 salary or the 17M he's owed next year."
"I heard on the Athletic Football Podcast (great listen) and they speculated probably a 2nd. Yes it would benefit the defense tremendously, JJs been having a good season. The only issue is the salary cap."
no
I'd give up a conditional 5th/6th round pick for him depending on the cap situation.
No.
It makes no sense other than it would be the beginning of some glorious TeraWatt memes.
"Everyone has been taking it as a given that UG III will be substituted for him on passing downs.

Is there any film breakdown of him in coverage? Is he actually a liability, or are people only assuming that because he’s a thumper?"
"I think it is because of his speed. I read from someone here he runs something like a 4.7 40, which won't cut it in most coverage situations. He will just be a mismatch.  Bush and others are much speedier and can keep up with the players they generally cover"
"If he had to play in obvious passing downs expect him to be a mismatch like Jon Bostic and Vince Williams were in 2018. His ""above the neck"" skills may hide some of it. In the end of the day he will get beat.

Basically I think Spillane is a Buck ILB. If they keep him next year. (He is a Free Agent) We may see him become Vince Williams eventual replacement. (Vince plays Buck)"
"He's not bad.  UG3 has the POTENTIAL to be elite due to his crazy speed.  However, if you listened to what Tomlin said, he took Spillane out of dime mainly to give him a breather.  He didn't want to increase his reps suddenly to max and tire him out.  He wanted him to focus on being top notch w/o worrying about fatigue."
"When I saw the all-22 film for Titans, the times where the Titans had wide open plays on play action was because Spillane would bite so hard on it and it would leave the middle of the field wide open."
"The only things that I've seen focus on him just dropping into zones, and then reading/keying on guys coming out of the backfield (which he seems pretty good at - though Batch mentioned that him biting on the play-fake took him out of the AJ Brown catch and run). Not much in terms of breakdowns in terms of him actually in coverage.

He's not athletic, so that probably has people inferring that he's not a great coverage guy (myself included to be honest), and that's also an area that UGIII had in spades in college (athleticism and coverage ability). There's also a tiny sample size here - the man has played 82 snaps of NFL defense in his career."
His (hand-timed) 40 time was slower than Kevin Dotson's (hand-timed) 40

Every season there’s one on MNF and I don’t know why..
It's what the people want.
"Because it's always entertaining.

-In years the Bengals are trash, we put on an offensive clinic which people love watching
-In years they suck a little less, we still whoop their asses up and down the field which people love watching"
"Because Andy Dalton can't.... 


ah crap, nevermind"
Steelers are a big draw & MNF plays 2nd fiddle to SNF and the regular Sunday games.  The NFL has to throw them a cookie.  They get the Steelers but not against a top tier opponent.  That goes on Sundays.
Its quality entertainment
"5 times in the last 20 years. Actually, that’s 5 times in last 10 years."
The national likes watching the Bungles bungle.
Ohio is a huge football market in general.
Everyone like to see a good beat down.
Does MNF get good ratings? I almost never watch unless the Steelers are playing.
It’s a very close RiValRY!
Any good Steelers podcast that you guys recommend...I use to listen to steel city underground but that one started to go downhill (stopped listening to that one a few years ago).
Not a podcast but Moats and Deke is a good weekly show. Actually talk to Deke on instagram a bit and he is a really cool dude.

Thanks everyone!!!
"BTSC Steelers Radio, Arthur Moats"
Behind The Steel Curtain. Very good production .
"The Terrible Podcast. They give amazing breakdowns of the games schematically. They interview a media member every week depending on the matchup. It gives you a good idea of the competition. They have 3 pods a week, all are at least 1.5 hrs so if you need to listen to stuff it deffinetly fills the time."
"I listen to Locked On Steelers Podcast every morning, Thursdays are Crossover Thursdays where they do a joined show with the opposing team. I use Spotify"
It isn’t a podcast but a super underrated channel for Steelers is Simfballcritic.

"Yeah, UG3 being down would be a huge loss. Spillane is a bull and was a good matchup vs Henry but we desperately need someone with speed and change of direction vs Lamar."
"Yep, if Gilbert can’t play, that will be a big hole in our defense."
Hopefully Hilton keeps moving in the right direction and we get him back for Sunday. We can use his speed and pressure to help contain Jackson.
"Derek Watt went from Full yesterday back to Limited. 

Is this dude ever gonna be healthy?"
"Anyone hear news on How’s Spillane is ? He looked shaken up last game . He came back but I would of thought he would of had some diagnosis ?? By the looks of things he’s doing great, just wanted to know if I missed something ."
"I'm optimistic that he'll be out there - IIRC, we had Johnson listed w/ a back issue last Friday and he still suited up (and did extremely well)."

"We have Tyson Alualu up the middle, and he’s one of the best in the game right now. Why would we need washed up Dontari Poe?"

He was absolutely horrible in Dallas this year
What a fucking idiot
lmao
"Quote the Raven, nevermore"
I mean if we get him for mad cheap he could be alualu’s backup instead of mondeaux
"For the people saying no... this 'must consider' is in regards to **Wormley** being hurt.  In that case... yes, I want just about anyone before fucking Henry Mondeaux possibly sees snaps there again.  Its a backup to replace the lower snap count backup to Alualu... lets not get angry over that."

Turned out, we got a really quality player out of it."
Crazy to me that a player would ever not want to be a steeler
this is what a great org/coach can do for you
And signing him was a very good decision by the Steelers.  Certainly an upgrade on Mathews and Cam Thomas.
"Who would have thought the defense would improve when Hargrave got his big deal...

Plus we'll get a good comp pick out of it"
Not being on the Jaguars would be a good decision for anyone's career

I met this dude his first year at the Steelers great guy
He was all over german social Media because he wore a german national team Jersey for his signing.

I remember being little when he was on the Jaguars he was legitimately my favorite player because I thought his name was cool. It’s good seeing him do well with y’all rather than waste his time on my dumpster fire of a team.

Idk been called a bandwagon fan my whole life. Its not my fault that my team is good every year.
"Man I got called bandwagon by a new coworker at 3-0 lol. 
Because he's about 30 years older, he claims he's been a fan longer than I have. Well duh. 

It took showing him pics of me in middle and high school back in the late 2000s of wearing Steeler gear to convince him. 

But you rarely get people calling anyone a bandwagoner here in Atlanta. It's accepted that transplants and fans of other teams live here, especially with the sorry local team not growing on most people lol."
"Lucky enough, I have us tattooed on my leg. And a pic of it on social media the day I got it in 2016"
Screw anyone trying to gatekeep. We welcome all fans as long as your love for dem Stillers is genuine.
"I got called a bandwagon fan the other day by a 35y/o Ravens fan born and raised in upstate NY, who started to support them 7 years ago....right after their Super Bowl win. The fact that I was draped in a Terrible Towel while in the nursery at Greensburg Hospital didn't change the fact that as an adult I moved to Virginia and am now a bandwagon fan."
"I'm a lifelong fan as well even though I've never lived in PA. My grandfather grew up near Pittsburg so I became a fan because he was.  I'm old enough to remember watching the original Steel Curtain play as a kid. I'm surprised by how many Steelers fans there are in the Central Valley (CA), so I don't really expect to be called a bandwagon fan. But I wouldn't be surprised.

Edit: I guess I could pull out my Hines Ward jersey that I never wear because they've lost every game that I've worn it for. Not normally superstitious, but not going to risk it..."
"I've never had somebody accuse me of being a bandwagon fan(maybe because in Indiana, at least in my experience, it seems to be more common to be a fan of an out of state team even though we have our own). I almost wish they would, because I've definitely got plenty of evidence to counter anybody that tries."
As a jersey collector I made the mistake at work of wearing just random jerseys on casual Fridays because why not? Then toward the season's start I started shifting to Steelers mostly. Drew some questions.
Who’s calling you a bandwagon fan?
"If you're not from Pittsburgh, you *are* a bandwagon fan, unless you're one of the three or so living people who were from abroad and supported us before 1970.

"Bernie: America, can you believe this? I let these kids into my division... in my conference... Don't say nothing when they wanna go by a different name or move cities. No sir, not me America. I respect the individual. If that's how they wanna conduct business so be it, I'm not here to control everything they do. I'm just here to win America. Like I've been doing all season.

It's music to my ears and the exact motivation I need to keep this division in line and under my thumb.

*In the distance the whining and crying of Ravens, Bengals, and Browns fans can be heard.*

^I ^miss ^Bernie ^Mac."
Honestly if you can’t laugh at that you need to lighten up. That’s fucking clever
Lol. That was good. I'm seeing some deep hatred for Cleveland though lol.
"The schedule part of this is a bit disingenuous. They say we’ve beaten up on NFCE teams when both Steelers and Ravens have played 2. We beat Philly and NYG and they beat Philly and WFT. 

We’ve both beaten Houston and Cleveland. We beat Denver and Tennessee. They beat Cincy and lost to KC."
"I love that they say “beating up the NFC East must have boosted your egos, when 3 of their 5 wins were to the NFCE and 1 other was against the Bungles. They’ve had an easier schedule than we have lol.

They had 1 tough opponent and got smashed. We’ve had one tough opponent and we won."
Pretty damn funny lol
"in that movie, Marcus and his wife end up killing Bernie Mac, so..."
"Calling TJ Ass, the disrespect"
"I chuckled, it works.

However, saying we've havent beat anyone isnt say much since neither have they.  They played one good team and got a butt whoopin.  We played one good team and won.  We'll play each other twice so thats two more ""good"" teams."
This is great 😭😂
"Funny shit, well done"
How many more times is Lamarr gonna choke in big games? Tune in Sunday and see.
"You gotta admire their commitment to their team and disconnect from reality to put this much effort into a meme, well done. 

That said how you gonna have the Steelers and browns trash talk about their 5-2 start without mentioning 1 of their loses was a blowout against us?"
"Wait didn't they only beat the eagles by like 2? Holding that against us is ridiculous when they had the same problem lol

Regardless, this is pretty hilarious lol"
"We beat the Titans, in Tennessee...."
This is incredible
"lamar jackson... ASS

Bernie needed to be wearing a white suit in this scene to make this perfect.
Good. Let them believe they have a chance. It will only bring them more heartbreak.
Bernie Mac looks too much like Mike Tomlin for this him to be the Ravens fan in this scenario. Definitely switch the roles.
26-23 against a reindeer and a duck.  The only person that scares me on the Ravens is Justin Tucker.
Aged like milk
"This aged well, eh lads?"
I think a lot of steelers fans are forgetting their team has missed the playoffs the last two years and only won three playoff games in almost a decade. They look good now but let's see how it plays out.
So was this supposed to be a moronic insult at us... or just a disguised shot at the Browns?  Because most of the memes I see over there are delusionally stupid and incorrect.
Lmfaoooo are they impressed with who they have beat?!😂
"Go back and watch the 2019 week 5 highlights. Nearly won that game with mason getting knocked out and duck slinging bombs downfield. Our D had Lamar shook, three interceptions, multiple sacks. Also had that absolute bs roughing the passer call on third and long that kept their end of game drive alive.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m nervous as hell, but that game is a good example of how you beat these guys. Force him to throw and take advantage. If our offense can keep him off the field for a chunk of time, I feel better."
"I have faith that the coaching staff looked hard at the Ravens v Chiefs game this year and studied how the Chiefs took care of them. KC has a good defense but ours is better so whatever they did, we SHOULD be able to emulate it."
I wouldn't think we'd lose this game but they are coming off a bye week which makes things interesting
Earl Thomas fucked him dirtier than he does his own brother.
Well the good thing is that Baltimore team has never played against Big Ben. We need Sutton and Fitzpatrick to double up on Hollywood Brown... So i think its going to be close but we will come away with the W.
"I want to believe, but isn't the counter argument to this that final game of last year's season? When we played them in their building we got our butts handed to us for a sad close to the season. Ben will make a difference, for sure, but I expect a dogfight at best."
And Lamar has never played Ben as well.
"Bet this game on the money line, Steelers will win"
"Play like we did in the first half last week for 60 (game) minutes, and they can't beat us."
Realistically if we can control the ground game and run similar pressure schemes to week 5 last year we can  are lamar 1 dimensional. If we do that I like our chances. But we have to convert and not turn the ball over. If we do what we did against Tennessee we lose.
We got robbed by the refs. Bullchit roughing call at the end. Period.
They are one of the best teams in the league and so are we. It should be a good one.

Tj is going to get robbed of DPOY once again

This is a really good write-up. Thanks for sharing!
"I clearly didn't watch the same game as the person who wrote the article, because I'd honestly argue that the Titans exposed our defense."
Great Breakdown of how the front-7 dominated tennessee and how the coverage disguises helped keep the Titans passing game off by a hair
"I really want him to win it, and he's playing at a high level, but something tells me hes still not getting the respect he deserves (maybe the watt name?) But is there anything significant he needs to do to give him a better shot at this award?"
"More Splash plays, and sacks. I don’t think the people voting care as much for stats like TFLs and QB hits which he leads the league in"
I think with the way our team is trending he won't be making those huge sacks required for DPOY. Those usually go towards players who take bigger risks. This team is so balanced that just bending and not breaking will continue to win us games. Let Garrett have DPOY. TJ has his mind on a ring.
Gotta be sack leader I think
He needs to not be hugged every play
"It's hard to put him above Garrett or Baker right now, but he's still hanging around. He just needs to make some big plays and rack up the sacks cause that's what gets the reward."
"Like other people said, sacks are a big one. There’s 2 people that are odds favorites ahead of TJ to win DPOY (Myles and Donald) and they are 1 and 2 in sacks

I also wonder if bud and alualu and the rest of the front 7 hurt TJ’s chances somewhat... part of what makes Donald so terrifying as a defender is that if you want a chance you have to double team him, and you kinda can because the rest of the rams d line isn’t as big of an issue. Garrett is the same thing and his supporting cast on defense is even worse. You can’t double TJ all the time because it means the rest of our monster defense can attack you easier and you don’t want that, so I wonder if the committee is going to consider that as well. Might be bad for TJ personally but that’s the kind of problem we want to have on defense"
He needs to not be hugged every plau
Strip sacks and turnovers. He has less strips this year than last but its still very early.
Tackle Lamar and rip his skull and spine out like predator!!!!!
sack leader would do it I think. and we havy cincy 2x still
it's gonna be myles... sadly
Needs to have more splash plays like last year like the other responses have alluded too. If he can put up similar numbers he should have a good chance. If we weren’t an 8-8 team and in the playoffs last year he probably could have won over Gilmore
"Gotta have 15+ sacks, 3+ FF and like 10+ TFL"
"Hes leading in TFL... gotta be top 3 in sacks probably.  Sacks, forced fumbles and picks are the flashy stats which he is lacking in right now."
"A few more splash plays, aka plays of different stats. His numbers are through the roof, yes, bot only in 2 areas. but getting a few more strip sacks or ball swatts or interceptions will help him tremendously"
"Play better than everyone else, and make more of an impact than everyone else."
"Hope Aaron Donald gets hurt. But seriously, he probably needs more turnovers(ffs or ints) and to be near league lead in sacks."

I know Ben is still decent but i think dak could help you guys out more. Any who good luck on the rest of the season. I’ll be blacked out for the rest of the year because dallas is complete ass.

We need Minkah to get 3 turnovers in a game so we can call him Hat Trick Fitzpatrick
I’m extremely disappointed in James Washington. He will make the occasional play here and there but he should be demanding the ball with his play at this point in his career. He was a 2nd round pick who has been relegated to 4th on the depth chart. I’d consider him a bust at this point.

This is great!!
"so we've seen what spillane is capable of 11 tackles, 2 TFL’s, 1 INT, 1 TD, 1 FR, a fucking monster. but we are also getting williamson. So my question is when Devin Bush is back next year will the linebackers in the game be spillane, williamson, and devin bush? or does linebacker position really matter"
Williamson I believe is just for the year
"At 32 years old and with a cap hit of $7mil, I expect Vince Williams to be a cap casualty if he doesn’t renegotiate next year. But if Spillane keeps balling out we might not be able to resign him for a reasonable price."
Williamson is a UFA I believe
"Next year is vince's last year. 3 million dead cap and 4 million cap savings if we cut him. Assuming we can get spillane on a 3 year deal worth around 2 million per year then I think Vince is gone. Or he extends another two years and lowers the cap hit. Retires at the end of the extension.

Spillane might play himself out of Pittsburgh if he keeps it up ala BJ Finney last year."
"Spillane and Avery are both Free agents in 2021. Last year of Vince's contract.

It'll be interesting to see what direction they move. They could cut Vince for cap saving and try to sign Spillane or Avery to play the Buck ILB. Keep Vince and sign either Spillane (hopefully for cheap)  to be an eventual replacement for Vince.

We shall see. I don't think they'll keep more than two players who can play Buck ILB. If Spillane isn't cheap they may let him walk it's not hard to find Buck ILBs in the draft."
Spillane I’d assume would be backup and subbed in when these guys need a play off. Tomlin usually rolls with whoever is playing best that week when it comes to these next man up situations.
""
Oh shit well good morning everyone
More depth is never a bad thing. I hope he plays well!!

"Everyone on r/nyjets seems sad about this so that makes me happy.  

Welcome Avery!!"
This dude’s funny as fuck
When you go from an 0-8 team to a 7-0 team.
My wife tutored him at UK and is just beyond over the moon excited he’s one of us now.
I like this guy already
Well worth a 5th round pick in 2022 despite Spillane’s play.  Not much proven depth and Spillane hasn’t really been tested yet against a pass heavy offense.
He had a packed bag waiting by the door.
Welcome home.
This dude can play. 28 years old. Did have an ACL in 2019 and missed the entire season. Was in Greg Williams doghouse. Super pumped!
What’s with the bud Dupree comment?
"Something else.  If he really is a rental and walks after this season, I’d think he’ll factor into the Steelers 2022  comp pick equation."
"Glad he got out of that trainwreck.

0-8 to 7-0 BABYYY"
Damn. He couldn't wait to get the hell out of that dumpster fire.
"This guys seems hilarious, but now I'm curious. Did he throw on his pads and go outside to take this photo once he got traded? Or did he have this prepared beforehand because he was dead set on getting the fuck out of NY?"
that pic is so hard 💯
Anyone have a scouting report on him? Strengths and weaknesses?
"Love his attitude.

Hitch the first ride out of town, and leave that god-awful franchise.  Hire someone else to move your stuff."
"I for one cannot wait for the 🅱illiams & Williamson ""don't talk to me or my son ever again"" memes."
Wow that’s fucking big time! Huge mid season acquisition there. Tremendous read and react ability and a very sure tackler. Easily the best player left on their defense.
He's gotta be super happy about this. Worst to first overnight lol
Any chance of re-signing him in the offseason?.... seems like the perfect fit to take over for Vince.
Such an epic picture! Welcome!
Go straight to Primanti Bros Bro !!
"What makes it great is that you can truly throw out the records.  As they mentioned in the broadcast, if we played them 1000 times, both probably win around 500.  Even last year, with backup QBs we probably should’ve won the first match.  Flip sides of the same coin.

It sure is fun to beat up on the Browns and Bengals, but it’s more challenging to know the Ravens are always going to punch us in the mouth and vice versa."
"I know... it’s pretty rare that we win in Baltimore, and it’s pretty rare that they win in Pittsburgh. The fact that we got the win yesterday in Baltimore is pretty big.

I keep waiting for this team to come out overconfident and play one of those groaner games where it seems like the “mojo” is missing and we can’t even tackle properly(you all know what I am talking about). But it hasn’t happened as of yet...which is cool with me."
Ben took 5 of the last 6.   Phuk the Ratbirds!
"I like the next match up with them. Short week, prime time. Steelers play the Jags and the Ravens play the physical Titans."
"I don’t consider Cincinnati or Cleveland our rivals, I know we’re their number one rivals, but I really just don’t think about them. Yeah Vontaze happened and so did Myles, but those felt like the little brother lashing out after us giving him 30 years of noogies and swirlies.

On the other hand, I live for BAL-PIT, some of the most exciting and heartbreaking games of my life have happened between those two teams and I wouldn’t trade it for the world. It’s somewhere between mutual respect and mutual hatred."

Steelering is a deep-seated concern that keeps me up at night.
I never take any game for granted. This the NFL...any given Sunday and all that.
"Yep. This is one of those ""Steelers-play-down-to-a-lesser-opponent"" type games. On paper we should win 38-10. But we Steelers fans will be mainlining Lexapro by the 4th quarter. We will probably ""squeak"" out a one score win..... 24-20. I hope I'm wrong."
The Cowboys? Nah. It’s the Bengals that this will happen against... especially considering they just beat Tennessee far easier than we did.
"Any Given Sunday but I'm quite hopeful we have a stress free 4th quarter this week. 

Besides, it's not a fun trash talking week anyway at work. The Cowboy fans I know have already given up on the season, even if they play in a division where 5 wins gets you in the playoffs this season LOL."
They’ll win next week but prob lose to the Jaguars. They always do.
I’m expecting a bad loss at some point. Hopefully it won’t be to the Cowboys.
"If we lost to the cowboys, it really wouldn’t matter too much"

"So, it sort of hit me just now. Apart from having a great team. HOF QB. Great offense with young receiving core. Feel good story and smart RB in Conner. Top O Line. Front seven that I'm sure gives opposing teams fits of internal rage. A mixed secondary of young talent and veteran savvy. 

Can Roethlisberger keep his ego in check and help groom his eventual replacement?

So we know his history of drafting potential replacements. But we've also seen his maturation this past decade. 

We are set up to compete once again for the AFC representative in the Superbowl for the next decade along with a HOF Head Coach who is due his expletive respect.

Will he go the way of Favre or Brady? Or, will he stick to his word on how ""THIS TEAM is the reason I came back."""
"It is up to the team to find a heir and it is not Ben's responsibility to help him past the usual ""hey I'm the QB1 and we need to ensure you're up to speed in case you have to be out there"" game planning and such. 

I'll give a small personal example. 
I was promoted about 5 years ago and my boss wanted me to train my replacement. 

I found it irritating as it went past the ""here's how to be successful and where the bathrooms are"" to ""make a powerpoint of the job responsibilities and duties and expectations"". 

Basically, she didn't want to train her new employee, who reports to her, not me. 

I had to move on with my new job, not worry about making a copy and paste template on how to replace me. 

Ben can take it how he wishes. Whoever the team drafts and selects to replace him is not his concern. He'll be retired when that change happens I hope, not pushed out the door lol."
"Quarterbacks don't groom quarterbacks.

Genetics, parents, extended family, friends, communities, youth coaches, high school coaches, college coaches, pro coaches, and various kind of trainers throughout their lives groom quarterbacks.

Other quarterbacks occasionally tell them what they fucked up.

The rest of this is just tabloid bullshit."
"We have Large Benjamin locked up for next season.  I could see us drafting a guy he could ""groom"" next year or not depending on how this year shakes out. Ben is 38 but also balling out. We could extend him too. Who knows. We are 7-0 baby let's eat steak."
"I’ve never thought bens ego, or whatever people want to call it, has been a problem. They tried to make it appear it was the problem, but then we all realized it was perhaps the other party"
"Did anyone groom Ben? No. It’s a feel good story, but unrealistic. Did Mahomes get groomed by Alex Smith? No, Alex Smith was traded. My point is rarely does a starting QB get “groomed” in the NFL.  They become starters because they outplay the other QBs on the roster."
"So, you know Large Benjamin personally?



Must be nice."
"Wtf is this lmfao goddamn you guys LOVE to hate Ben. 

Go back and look at masons comments on Ben last year fam"
"Okay, Ego was too crass of a word. But, let's not pretend the NFL isn't full of divas. I've grown up watching the guy. We don't know for sure when his time will be up. He is 1 of 4 remaining starting QB from early 2000's. Surely, he'd want to retire a Steeler. Call it fairytale or wishful thinking. But, maybe we draft a potential QB1 in the next three years and 7 gives more than tips or advice."
"So, Ben's job is to win football games, not train rookies and such. Being in the room with him and watching him go about his job is the only training he needs to do. Obviously he'll answer questions when asked, but these are adults dude. They all have to take care of themselves and their jobs. It's not Ben's job to train his replacement, it's the replacement's job to pay attention and learn."
"He definitely has an ego, a la his reaction to when Mason was drafted. Mind you, Mason's performance last year should give any injured starter confidence in retaining their job.

However, I dont think it matters. Unless some top prospect is available I don't think qb will be considered in the next draft. Perhaps the proceeding one. He and the team should be all in this/next season. If the team were horrendous, then sure, start looking for the heir."

Not bad for a running back.
They're lucky there weren't more interceptions. Jackson was throwing the ball away as he was falling numerous times. Even the last TD pass that he threw was tipped.
But he protects the ball so well! Announcers said so like 10 times.
Thought that was cheese for a second
Delicious?
Ahh now I'm hungry and laughing at the Ratbirds. A familiar feeling.

Its like they don't realize two of their TDs were gifted by the refs and we lost two Dlinemen as well... including the best player in the ENTIRE NFL against the rush super early.
Man I hope the Colts and Titans beat them lol.
Remind them that the Ravens’ best win was against Cleveland
Definitely not the most overrated undefeated team. In 2014ish the Chiefs were like 8-0. In the early 2010s the Bears were like 7-0 and missed the postseason or something.
Ah yes good the gypsy tears will help with the curse. Must make sure we have plenty of them for the Very Nice season.
Not many teams win with 4 turnovers.  Tell him to shit in his own yard.

He has been a nice addition. I think he is due for a huge game too.
"Outside of the fumbles/drops he’s been a bright spot this year

He had one pass yesterday he could’ve hauled in (Ben placed it at his knees and would’ve been difficult grab), but he also makes some spectacular catches. Just got to keep staying consistent"
I love his “look” of always having the black long sleeves. I can always find him on the field quickly because of it.
"I call him Cement Hands Ebron anytime he makes a great play as a shot at all the Colts fans saying “lmaooo enjoy him he can’t catch to save his life”

I’m so glad we got him, what a great 1-2 punch him and Vance are"
He played great yesterday. Reminded me of Heath yesterday of being the nice fail safe for Ben.
Career resurrected
What’s about Dwight stone hands?
"We really needed another solid te, and he brings a great energy to the team. I was really surprised we got him as cheap as we did"
I was very concerned with his lack of hands in the first half yesterday but he sure bounced back.
I live in Detroit so I’ve seen a lot of this guy. Drops will never go away but he is a freak who will make plays every game. And he is bought in more than ever on this Steelers team. It’s that point in his career where he’s proven and now he just wants to go fucking win baby.
He's a huge part to our blocking as well
Ebrontosaurus
"I definitely like his production, I just don’t get his line of thinking with his on field choices. Too many times does he jump when he doesn’t need to to make the catch. That coupled with a few off balance moves that’s he’s fortunate didn’t get him killed. I think Vance has improved a lot this year too. I’d like to see them both getting targets."
"I love Ebron. Some of his drops can be frustrating but the good outweighs the negative in my opinion, and it’s nice to have a weapon like him on the team. If I were to become an OC, one of the first things I’d ask for other than a franchise QB is a tight end who can go up and get the ball but also create YAC. Ebron fits the bill."
He had that smooth ass catch where even the defender looked it off like “nah he didn’t catch it... oh shit nvm he did!”
Yes. I agree. Dynamite player.
"I don't know about EVERY game.  He's had a few duds here and there (Philly game), but he played great yesterday!"
"Are you sure you are talking about 85?
Prior to yesterday’s average game, be stopped on routes, doesn’t fight for balls, dropped passes, and fumbled some he caught, and waves his hands as if he were interfered on or missed wide open on every play. 

Extremely disappointed in this guy."
Enjoy it while it lasts. He’ll probably be a cap casualty next year

yo....
Discy-yoto!!!
tf am i looking at
"He’s made some lights out plays for us the last couple of weeks. Stepping up and making a TD saving tackle on Derrick fucking Henry, the pick 6, fumble recovery... feels a bit like a James Harrison situation where this seemingly nobody steps in and becomes a playmaker on our defense without a hitch.

Surely this dude has weaknesses though, right? What were the weaknesses in his game that caused Western Michigan to be his best college option? Why did he go undrafted in 2018, and then why did Tennessee not keep him after last season?"
he didn't take that fumble recovery to the house and I think sometimes he is a little slow in coverage because his gigantic hose of a schlong slows him down
speed. he is too slow against outside runs. also he is not that good in man coverage
"Consistency. One play he'll look like an elite cover LB and the next he'll look totally lost. May just be communication, not sure. He also takes some really fucking bad angles. He took several on lamar jackson that ended in big runs instead of TFL or short gains. Gotta imagine Bush would've been making those plays. He's only started twice though and Gilbert definitely would've gotten some snaps if he were able to play. Overall, we could br a lot worse off. With the addition of Williamson we should be able to have a decent rotation now"
"He is fairly average athletically, not bad but average. He obviously can't cover the ground Bush could, because no one on the team can. He appears physical and I think he is at least serviceable in coverage. I thought he struggled at times to shed blocks as a smaller linebacker. Overall I am happy with his play to this point and have faith."
He did get outrun by Dobbs off tackle for a pretty big run.  But no one's perfect.
"He gets burned in coverage, not because he’s lost, just not agile enough."
"He's slow sideline to sideline. Watch Highsmith's INT, Spillane was beat badly & that wasn't the only time he was beat in coverage. Watch some of Dobbins or Jackson's outside runs to the sidelines, Spillane often took angles too sharp for how slow he is & was behind the play. Regardless the Ravens have athletic TEs & are incredibly athletic & fast on the run, so it makes sense that this was a poor matchup for Spillane, further exacerbated by the lack of rest w/ UG3's injury, YET Spillane still was a positive contributor which speaks volumes of how hard he works."
"Look at the amount rushing yds we gave up in yesterday’s game, and then look at how they were attacking us with zone runs. 

The sideline to sideline speed Bush had is what none of our other LBs have and it showed up yesterday in a major way"
"Slower than bush. We need that sideline to sideline speed. Also lacks experience and coverage ability because he’s not as athletic as RBs or Slot receivers. 

That’s not to say he hasn’t far exceeded expectations filling in for Bush. He should be a good replacement for Vince as our early down Mike LB if we end up moving on from him this off-season."
You weren’t watching the game if you didn’t see his weaknesses yesterday.  He was directly responsible for just as many back-breaking defensive lapses as he was the pick 6 and 4th down stop.  The Ravens were running right past him around the edge all day long when they weren’t turning it over to him.

"Speed and experience... slot receivers coming across can leave him behind if he doesn't get a step ahead.  Can take bad reads on some schemes and end up behind the play.

&#x200B;

People saying hes not athletic are utterly stupid.. he is in the NFL, you are on your computer, he is athletic."
"Pass covera...\*watches replay of him jumping the route and taking an interception to the house

Ummmmmm...????"
He is out of position a lot and not very athletic.
He is slow. Our offense really depends on a fast MLB so this isn’t the best scheme fit for him. He is obviously a talented guy that can come up in clutch spot but getting Avery Williamson was a good move.

We may have to go 15-1 just to secure the 1st seed 😅
That Bills game in Buffalo in December is going to be a tough one.
Tbh it’s possible for them to go 16-0 they just have to not make any big stupid mistakes. Seems like they won the two toughest games of their year. We’ll see.
I really hate the new bye rules
Sometimes I'll randomly open the nfl app just to look at the standings
"I actually like the new rules, or at least I’m not opposed. How many times have games in December been a waste Bc playoffs were already decided. The push to lock up first will hopefully keep things interesting down the stretch."
Victory Monday is the only Monday I enjoy
Yeah I’ve been a little obsessed with power rankings the last couple years. And now with them consistently at 1 or 2 (sometimes 3) it’s beautiful.
A Steelers and KC game for the AFC Championship has the potential to have a wider appeal than most Super Bowl matchups if both teams finish with two or fewer losses.

"From all the highs and lows of yesterday, leave your final thoughts/analysis/discussion/takeaways from yesterday’s game.

This thread is intended for level-headed, mindful discussion and less knee-jerk reactions. Keep this in mind before commenting.

As always **DON’T BE A DAMN JAGOFF.** Follow our rules. We all have different opinions and mindsets, but we’re all here to talk Steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day. Keep it cool."
"Can we talk about how good Highsmith has been? Dudes been making the most of his opportunities. 

Also Watt was incredible again. 8 pressures, 5 QB hits, and a sack. 

Spillane continues to step up. The plan moving forward might be to have him on the field and sub in Williamson on dime (replacing Marcus Allen). 

The fact that we can play so shitty and still win against a very good Ravens team is incredible. 

Ravens ran more plays (79-50), out rushed us (265-48), had more passing yards (192-173), and more ToP (35:22-24:38). We should’ve been blown out. Yet we won. Great teams find a way to win"
"Very excited to be 7-0!!!

Also, did anyone catch TJ yelling at Keith Butler during the first half? I saw them both screaming at each other. Wasn't sure what was going on."
"I am trying to be rational, so bear with me.

&#x200B;

But we might be the greatest team in all of history."
"A complete team. DLine was huge. Claypool selling jerseys. The coach with the most expressive face of all humanity still shows how he feels with a mask on.

Next week will show whether the ""play down to their competition"" label still sticks."
"Butt is still clenched next day.


We got absolutely shredded on the ground which really surprised me. I thought we would force lamar to throw on us and we'd get torched. But the defense came up huge on 4th down stops.


Not sure who's call it was to let Ben just call whatever he wanted but we watched a HOF'er do what he does. You can't teach that. It's why it will be so hard to find a good replacement when Ben retires.


TL;DR 


The offence f'd up. The defense f'd up. 


Super bowl teams will find a way to win"
"For someone who spends so much time working on his own brand (and I have no problem with this - get yours!), I don't ever want to hear that Juju gives anything less than 100%. In fact, I think he may have less natural born talent (comparatively, of course) but he makes up for it with raw determination. I hope we can keep him this offseason, no matter how unlikely that may be."
Is there any reason why we wait so long for Ben to go no huddle? I’m sure fatigue is the biggest one but even then I feel like they could do it earlier. Seems like they always wait until they’re in a hole.
Anyone have that graphic that showed how many of the PIT-BAL matchups have been decided by 7 points or fewer?
Any word on Cam yet?
"Marlon Humphrey said he has COVID. Hopefully this doesn’t affect our guys from the game yesterday. But we are definitely winning games we would lose in the past. If we play a complete game where we are at our best, I don’t think there is a team who can keep up and beat us."
jets 😏😏😏
"Hello, Chiefs fan here. I haven’t watched any of your games so I was curious, what are the strengths of your team? I’m curious to how we stack up to each other"
"God, Humphrey has Covid and played against us yesterday. Great."
"Robert Spillane makes splash plays and most of the other plays he should make. 

Playing the best and most creative running team in the league is tough. Never thought we would give up 265 yards on the ground but a win is a win and that stop on the second to last drive showed who this team really is. 

Highsmith gets the rookie of the game award even with Chase grabbing 5 balls and a touchdown (that fumble happens sometimes). Excited to see this young and talented bunch develop.

Jordan Berry deserves a game ball imo. He pulled it together after that first shank and put together a solid second outing back. Canaday had at least one bad snap and he was still able to pin the Ravens twice. All three phases need to contribute to a win against the reigning MVP and division champs. 

Can't wait to watch our boys get after the Red Baron next week!"
Honestly fuck Raven fans and there piece of shit fans. There sub was just hoping TJ and Ben got career ending injuries and they also sent Tuitt death threats.
"Like Coach T said, they did not play well at times. I think not having Bush, Hilton, and Alualu in the game hurt the run defense. But what a great team effort to hold on and win.

&#x200B;

The one thing that really bugs me despite the win is the last offensive possession... They really should have gotten a first down and put the game away. I don’t know if it was the play calling or what but it felt like they could have made a better effort there."
I know we are going to drop a game eventually because winning in the NFL is tough but damn it feels good to be undefeated this late in the season.
I’m glad Lamar isn’t our quarterback but damn he’s fun to watch.  He made Dupree look like the slowest guy on the field when he bit on the handoff.
"I will downvote any jagoff talking about damn “trap games” in nfl or our subreddit. Tomlin has a good hold of these guys and our team is full of young, hungry, team-players who are going to give every game their all. We no longer have a roster full of divas who think their shit doesn’t stink. There is no way this team will drop one to the Cowboys."
"Like a lot of you, I’m frustrated with play calling. The metaphor I use is our offense is like an exotic sports car that can burn over 210 mph, but instead of opening it up we’re cool to go 75 in a 70 in the middle lane. Damn we have so much talent I want them to let it rip."
This team is making amazing half time adjustments this year. Coaching staff have been 11/10 given the restrictions they're facing due to Covid.
"On the bright side if someone catches COVID-19 from the Ravens we might get a free bye week when we need it most.

On the even brighter side 7-0.

Offense needs to come alive sooner like we did against the Titans. The first half was brutal to watch but the halftime adjustments showed up quick in the third quarter and was ultimately enough to topple one of the best teams in the league. 

Defense wise we had to lean on them way too much because the offense was flat and playing from behind for a good chunk of the game. Still seeing some small mistakes and missing plays because they are going for the sack or wanting to strip the ball. It's great when it works but a team like the Ravens can and did burn us on some of those missed attempts. 

Another too close for comfort game but I much prefer that sort of game than what happened with the Titans where it felt like luck gave us the win compared to this coming down to skill and how both teams were coached. 

Thankfully the next three games are gonna be easier and hopefully guys like Heyward can be rested."
Bro.  Leveon Bell is garbage doesn’t matter what team he is on.  But more importantly:  yesterday was a testament to our teams ability to stay the course and get the job done.  If we can beat the Ravens we can beat anyone on our schedule.  The moment we get complacent is the moment we lose to the Jags or the Bills.  We have to keep playing hard and stick together.  I’m so proud of Spillane and Juju.  Spillane really took it upon himself to step up and fill Bush’s shoes best he can.  And Juju has been second fiddle but he was instrumental in our win with hustle plays.  So proud of him for staying with us and not getting pissy and pushing over kicker nets.  Love this team!!!!
"I know people point out that QBs get rocked standing perfectly upright in the pocket, but I just can't see it being good for your long term prospects to consistently run your 212lb QB up the middle."

I want to see what we do to Baltimore with Mike Hilton on the field.
The amount of ravens fans still crying about the final play of the game is remarkable to me.  I'm not sure how you watch that play and think pass interference.
"Is anyone else mad that the offence couldn’t get a first down to ice the game, forcing the defence back in the field leading to they Heyward injury?"
"You guys all realize that winning vs Tennessee and Baltimore means the Steelers are almost definitely going to lose to the Nooch and Dallas, right?

The Titans just lost by two scores to the Bungles, and Brady almost lost to Daniel Jones, who is a turnover in human form.  Ain't no easy games in the NFL, especially not with the Steelers."

"He made a couple of splash plays in the second half, but a big reason why they ran so much in the first half was because he wasn't doing the job he was supposed to after Alualu went down.  He did figure it out and step up which is all you can ask for a back ups back up."
Buggs in the pass rush looked fantastic. His hand usage as  was phenomenal to win 1 on 1 but his ability to finish was what impressed me the most.
"He better have, as Tomlin said. He played like trash in the 1st half. Only matters how you play in the last drive against that team though"
"Tomlin said ""he needed to make those plays"" at the end of the game cuz he was fucking up early."
"That might be because we entered the game with the best run defense in the NFL.  We started the game holding various Raven runners to tiny bits of yardage.

And then Alualu went down and they ran for damn near 300 yards on us.

He made a play or two, but he was F- terrible on the day.

Here's the high praise Tomlin lavished upon him:

*""We had no other choice but to use him. And he wasn't any good when he 1st got in, so it was about time he made a play.*""

Enough love?  The fact that we traded for a linebacker and not a DT yesterday is probably more love than he deserved."
Check the flair but also his energy was what drove the defense

Unpopular opinion but I still think the Chiefs are the best team in the AFC until they’re knocked out of the playoffs honestly. Mahomes is just a whole different animal than Jackson or any QB we have played.
\*psst\*... it's not real..
WTF even is this?
I'm watching ESPN right now and of the people in there said that the Buccaneers are better than the Steelers.
I am of the mindset that 1. Kc is really damn good and I won't discount that. 2. I'd love to be underestimated and undefeated all the time. Thats the ideal scenario in my book.
Throwing that ball underhand was easier than throwing it overhand... theres a reason why in baseball you flip it underhand to second base during a double play and not fire it overhand...
"Slow news day. The Pens aren’t the best team in the NHL right now, and the Chiefs aren’t the best team in the NFL. W-L records matters. Besides Mahomes isn’t to the NFL what Crosby is to the NHL.  Not even close."

"They will fuckin suck mahomes off until he is a week in the grave. Great QB, generational talent, but why write an article like this? And they won against the worst team in the entire NFL wow what an achievement"
"Although I strongly dislike how much ESPN absolutely blows the Chiefs and Mahomes while vastly undermining the Steelers, I do agree the Chiefs are the best team in football. For most of the season Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid have been dormant simply sitting behind CEH and Bell who've punched every team in the mouth, allowing them to keep all of their tricks in their hip pocket for the post season."

But locally, Poni is the worst of the worst. It's heavily a shtick, and yinzers give him the attention he craves, but he is genuinely a laughably bad radio host locally. The Fan is taunting us by trotting out guys like him, Ziese, Cook, and Dunlap. Those guys prove that sports radio sells itself. They could put anyone in those time slots and get listeners, and they choose these hacks. 

They had a fun show with Starkey and Mueller 2-6pm but they broke that up and now Mueller is starting to shamelessly copy Poni's antics.

Good news for both him and Alualu so far. Fortunately we have what should be easy games on the horizon but we are going to start to feel the week 4 bye.
Really glad this wasn’t anything serious
Thank god. Maybe rest him against the Cowboys. Rather have a worse defense in that game than lose Cam for the whole season.
Fantastic news. What was the update on Alualu?
"While it's not an ACL, I can assure you Quad injuries, even minor ones, are no joke and can linger for a while.  Here's hoping they allow him proper time to recover so it isn't made worse!"
"Wow, I really thought it was something serious at the time. So happy Cam is ok."
Sit Cam against the cowboys for sure.
Hopefully wormley comes back this week.
Fucking sigh of relief
I was really betting on the MCL sprain for Heyward and something even less minor and odd for Alualu... and quite happy having those reversed since neither got the dreaded ACL tear.
"Thank god. Still remember this guy in the Sugar Bowl gs Arkansas. He was a force to be reckoned with. Just an absolute monster, a terror to Ryan Mallet."
Cam is too strong to get hurt.
I was so afraid that injury timeout would give the Ravens a chance to win the game with seconds left on the clock. Turns out that injury hurt us just as little as it hurt Heyward.
"Hopefully no time missed, a week or 2 at the most?"
This is great. Would love to see a lot of rotation in the upcoming weeks.
I'm wondering how the approach should be. The schedule eases off a bit but you can't take em for granted either.
"Defense definitely takes a hit with he and Alualu likely both missing this week's game and potentially the next three or four, but this could have been much worse news. I think if Buggs works as the starter for the week, we'll see him play more like he did in the second half, which should be serviceable for the time being. Tough to replace Cam, both in production and leadership, but at least we haven't lost him for the year."
Relaxation!
Ahh so my timely rooster sacrifice paid off
"Wow.  That was the longest I ever held my breath 25-ish hours.

Any word on Tyson Alualu (I admittedly have not looked to hard for info)."
And Alualu?
Glad he's okay. What about Alualu? Anyone know?

Spillane may not be the sharpest player on the defense, but he's shown he's a playmaker these past few weeks and deserves playing time. If Avery can be that solid rock that always does the little things correctly (basically the inverse of Spillane) than I think we're good to go."

"I think it turns into a rotation, once Williamson is up to speed on our defense.  Spillane has been playing well, and his performance doesn't warrant getting sent to the bench.   That said, Williamson is too good to be left on the bench all game.   Having three capable of starting at ILB is a nice problem to have."
Spillane is getting tackles and that huge block because they’re targeting him like WEAKEST LINK AIM HERE.
"Spillane prolly starts until the Thanksgiving game, Avery is probably starting by then, maybe the following week. Regardless, I'm very thrilled with the level of play from Spillane considering what Bush did for us."
(X) Doubt
"I think this is a good move. Other teams will watch film of the Ravens game, and likely assume we can be beat at the run. Yes, it’s ridiculous, but still. So I’m guessing they bring in another LB to cycle out run stopping, in case a team thinks they can body the DL again."
Spillanes a playmaker haven’t had an ilb like that since shazier
Spillane is outplaying Bush by a landslide.  I mean the Mack ILB is supposed to make a bunch of plays.  Everything is set up for you to be consistently involved in everything.  Bush wasn't doing much at an action packed position.

I'm always good for getting more oline and dline depth. Maybe safety to shore that up. I don't think we'll see anything else though
"Sign Gilmore, get Darnold for depth, retroactively get Jameis for even more depth, and maybe Kenny Golladay and Checkdown Mike for good measure."
"Trade a 7th for Dalvin Cook, get JJ Watt for free through persuasion, and then scam the Patriots for Gilmore"
No need. The only reason we traded for a mlb is because Bush got hurt.
"...safety?

We have Minkah (there's maybe 1-2 better safeties in the entire league) and Edmunds who is a capable backup/

Who would we go get? lmao."
"NFL trade deadline isn't like the other leagues. You don't want to be giving up all your mid-round picks for rentals because those turn into depth guys you count on going forward. So they won't waste them trying to upgrade someone like Sean Davis and probably not the linemen either.

If there was one additional move I'd make it would be bringing in a veteran QB as long as they didn't give up anything meaninful. You probably aren't winning a Super Bowl without Ben but I'd much rather try with someone like Andy Dalton instead."
"Unless it is signing a temporary FA, I don't see it.  The Williamson signing was a good value at a place we suddenly had need.  We didn't over pay for it, and we are getting a good player at a good value.

How about we save some of these future picks for our drafts?  We didn't get here by trading them all away, as most of the core of this team were players we drafted.  We're in a good place right now, and there is no need to take a flyer when we've been doing well filling in where we needed."
"I would have said Snacks for depth while alualu and heyward have injuries. If Seattle doesn’t protect him Id poach him. 

Other than that I cant really think of anything."
Yes
"D-line seems like it'd be nice to have, but i'm just a random person on the internet."
"If Alualu is going to be down for a while, maybe we need NT/DT help.  Butler came out in a 4 - 3 in the second half to compensate for the loss of Alualu's run stuffing, kicking Cam/Tuitt inside with Bud/Watt playing DE and Highsmith/Spillane/Vince playing the LB spots.  Before that we were getting gashed between the tackles.  Ravens then countered by going more off tackle and straight college options to the outside.

Maybe calling Poe isn't a crazy idea if Alualu is really hurt.  But then again Poe has dropped a lot these last few seasons."
Maybe sign Dontari Poe or some cheap DL for additional depth unless they want to elevate Calvin Taylor from the PS.  I think this team is pretty solid as is.
"Not really a huge fan of Isiah Buggs being the NT in base defenses.

Or at IDL if there's another injury to Cam/Tuitt."

Which Primanti Bros location is better
"judging by body language from everybody around them it seems like a healthy argument both guys just frustrated trying to find answers....side note, Ravens only scored 1 td after this so...."
"I love how Minkah and ""street-clothes"" Mike Hilton both put a hand out to calm TJ down. The whole team feels the frustration of getting gashed by the Ratbirds, but they hold each other accountable. I love this team!"
"As others have said, probably the amount of focus he was told to put on Lamar. He’s a play maker and probably felt like he could have made the right reads and gotten a few tackles in the backfield. 

our D made Lamar uncomfortable though. Took him out of playmaking position where he likes to be. I think thats what won us the game in the end"
Just trying to read body language here but it feels like Butler is blaming/accusing him of something and Watt is like fuck you I'm doing my job
Mink and Hilton being leaders here this is just Teej getting a little fired up
Was wondering that too.  The NFL needs it's own Jomboy.  Any of you guys that want to get internet famous should jump right on that.
"Read in another thread somewhere that tj was telling him to 'stop making me charge the mesh' and that it was putting them at a disadvantage somewhere else.  I gather, that means the same thing others have said in regard to focusing on lamar."
Lol Haden's face
hot dog is not a sandwich obviously.
"Knowing Keith Butler, he probably said that he thought Game of Thrones season 8 was pretty good"
"TJ was probably getting pissed at having to force Lamar to pitch it on those RPO.  If that was the case I'm in full agreement with TJ.  Force lamar to run the ball and punish him, if the ravens are willing with lamar getting smacked every down we'll take that.  But TJ had to force lamar to pitch it every time and you can see the RBs were gashing us for 10+ every time."
Minkah just trying to get a drink of Gatorade
"After watching this a couple times I think TJ was probably getting blamed for not making a call. I’m not gonna say I’m a pro lip reader or anything  but looks like he literally says, “I’m the one who said it..” Someone wasn’t doing what they were designed to do for sure. I think TJ and Bud were switching responsibilities on the option relative to the play, right? I’m probably way off. 

Love the way Minkah and Mike get on him about it. The way Joe looks at him like bro relax, we’ll get it. I’m sure TJ and Butler laughed about it since then. I love that week 8 is the Super Bowl for TJ Watt. The sky is the limit for this kid."
"somebody said similar in the game thread, but Watt really needs to cool his shit there.  At that point we were getting our asses kicked on defense and Butler was trying to light a fire under the whole unit and instead of using it, Watt took it personal.  You can tell by everyone else's body language that Watt is the odd-man out here.  Even Minkah is like ""dude, stop""."

"so ratbirds are whining about ""cheapshots"" at lamar.

but this is exactly what we did last year in the (horrible) last game of the year.  RG3 was running rpo and we hit the snot out of him.  on each video, just keep watching how we hit RG3 on all these plays.

**if they are going to expose their QB and  pretend he still has the ball, then you need to punish him... over and over again.**

i tried to make a single cut, but it wouldn't let me so i posted these as separate videos.  here's a playlist of them. [LINK](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1w9lPqD7wps_0Rgj8N8NFnTaN0YVdEep)


i enjoy watching RG3 jump and dance to try to avoid the hits...  i didn't enjoy rewatching that game..."
Yea when I saw them asking for roughing it just showed their lack of knowledge on what is allowed. Same thing with the final play calling for PI or defenseless receiver when Minkah has just as much right to ball as the receiver.
"If only there was some sort of book of rules that could explain it. Something with words defining 'Roughing the Passer' as...

&#x200B;

>Any physical acts against a player who is in **a passing posture** (i.e.  before, during, or after a pass) which, in the Referee’s judgment, are  unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls. 

and

>Roughing will be called if, in the Referee’s judgment, **a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already left the passer’s hand before contact was made** 

Like, if you're *pretending* or *hiding* the fact that you got rid of the ball?"
"They should know by now that RPO is not protected by roughing the passer... if they want to view it as cheap, sure, whatever.  We aren't going to act like its not a free shot on a fast QB.  And its Harbaugh's fault if he keeps calling that and they cannot protect Lamar.

Its legal, bit of a dick move and that is how tough football is played."
"This is exactly how Steeler D's have been in the vanguard of driving this cheap gimmicky style of offense out of the NFL each time it's reared its ugly head for a season or two.

Dick LeBeau showed the league the way in driving the read option into obscurity for a while in the earlier 2010's.  ""Make the QB pay the price every play, whether he keeps the ball or not.  That'll stop him from running eventually, one way or another.""

Nothing has changed.  It's still gimmickry.  It's still effective until teams have seen it enough to know it's coming.  And Uncle Dick's plan of taking it out on the most valuable piece of the offense is still the antidote.

Don't want your QB hit like a runner?  Don't make him a running threat."
"When defending a team that runs the option you have your players take assignments. In the old days of the triple option you had a different guy assigned to the dive, the QB, and the pitch man. That player was told to tackle their assignment every option play and trust their teammates would do their job as well.

That holds true today, they run any sort of option you tackle your assignment. That's why the option wasn't run in the Pros for years and years - teams didn't want to get their QB killed. Ravens fans need to understand that if Lamar is running option, he is going to get hit. Blame your OC and HC for putting him in this situation. While doing so he is a runner plain and simple and QB protections no longer apply."
In the shot gun/pistol this is the way to play it.   Our problem yesterday is when they ran it to the outside.  Our edge rushers forced lamar to pitch it and their RBs were gashing us for 10+.  Our edge rushers should have taken the rb option away from lamar and forced him to run it himself.. punishing everytime they did that would've forced them to get away from it really quick

"I love Steeler nation but as a fan too yall piss me off when you want Coach T fired. Tomlin has never had a losing season, 8 playoff runs, 6 division titles and 3 AFC championship games, 2 super bowl game and a title in Super Bowl XLIII. Thats better than most Coaches in the NFL. I also think he should have been  COTY last year for leading Pittsburgh to an 8-8 season with a very plagued offense and when everyone counted on us to go maybe 4-12 and be last in the division."
"Tomlin's only sin is being in the same conference as Bill Belichick for his entire tenure. It made fans hold him to impossible standards and kept him from winning multiple rings(which he may well do this year). Same reason Ben gets so disrespected in the media's ""legacy"" conversations."
Can we also just appreciate how fucking cool he looks out there too with the dark RB aviators and the face mask? It’s just a final boss look that goes well with an undefeated team.
"I think it took us to realize what exactly he was dealing with when the circus was in town to appreciate just how great of a coach he is. I've always been a Tomlin fan, but these past 18 months he's easily been the best head coach in the NFL in all phases."
"I’d like to see someone try to name 3 living and active football head coaches (NFL or college) not named Belichek or Saban who are clear cut, irrefutably better than Tomlin"
I love Tomlin
Should be COTY this year
"Tomlin is the best. Stand up guy, class act, hell of a coach. I can't deal with the whiney fair weather fans calling for him to be fired every game, we are down at the half? FIRE HIM! Then crickets when we win. Absolutely bullshit. There is a reason why we are consistently above .500 at the least each season. It's continuity. That torch being passed from Noll to Cowher, to Tomlin."
I don't think a coach should get fired unless they do something morally wrong on have two losing seasons in a row. Mike Tomlin doesn't do losing seasons and things of that nature.
"FULL DISCLOSURE: After the not winning a SB in the Killer B’s era, I wanted him gone. I felt like the team lacked discipline and made constant stupid mistakes on and off the field. I put that on Tomlin. I always thought he was a good coach, but maybe we needed a change and he needed a change in scenery and it would be mutually beneficial to part ways. 

And here’s where is gets ugly. After the Packers fired McCarthy I thought that his offensive mind would jumpstart the team, and I was really rooting for the Steelers to hire him to replace Tomlin. 

BOY WAS I FUCKING WRONG. That take has not aged well one bit and it just goes to show you that maybe, just maybe the people in charge know what they’re doing. 

It turns out Bell, Bryant, and Brown were complete cancers and distractions. Colbert adjusted and brought in high character guys like Juju, Claypool, DJ, and Connor. Ben is healthy. And Tomlin has been incredible. The team is just different this year. Really feels like this could be a special year and I’m so thankful that the Steelers brass don’t listen to rabid idiot fans like me.

And LOL at what McCarthy is doing in Dallas this year..."
It is pretty cool that we will have had three hall of fame coaches in a row
"I have no idea why people want him fired. After almost making the playoffs yesterday with no Ben and a plague of injuries throughout the season, Tomlin’s proved himself to be a phenominal coach."
"He has been a top 5, more likely a top 3, HC for years and 2019 was a master class in getting the most out of a bad situation. He isn't perfect but I'd still take him over pretty much any HC out there."
After watching how good (all things considered) last season turned out it solidified what an amazing coach Tomlin truly is.
His issues with time management and underperforming against weak teams are valid concerns but should be easily overshadowed by 0 losing seasons and going 8/8 with whatever the fuck we had on offense last year.
Always happy to see sensible posts like this. The Tomlin hate is absurd. He has his weaknesses but he's a damn good coach and I hope he sticks around for a good while.
Tomlin is one of the greats. Not a lot of coaches in any sport can say they've never had a losing season as a head coach. He's hella underrated if anything.
I feel Tomlin deserves some of his criticisms. Especially with clock management at times and the team underperformed against subpar teams. However I still think he is a good headcoach borderline elite.
"reason number 751 that tomlin is the best coach...

ben [dinucci](https://cowboyswire.usatoday.com/2020/11/02/ben-dinucci-reflects-first-start-this-nfl-thing-its-hard-postgame-quotes-week-8-philadelphia-eagles/): this nfl thing... it's hard

meanwhile, tomlin leads duck and mason to 8-8 record last year."
"His regular season record is not always what draws up the fire talk. It's playoffs.


If we get bounced in the first round, an undefeated regular season will not matter in this sub.


If you think winning a super bowl automatically makes that all go away, see the penguins sub where their recent back to back stanley cup winning coach(thought to be impossible in the cap era) is often the discussion of replacement.

"It's still early, but it kinda seems like Joe Burrow is going to take over as the man in the North when Ben retires."
"He’s not an elite QB. He really is a system QB. If Lamar throws it 40 times in a game; there’s a 95% chance the Ravens are going to lose the game; simply because they won’t abandon the run game unless they’re down like 21 points in the second half. 

Most of the throws he makes are to wide open receivers that are wide open because defenses focus on the Baltimore running game. 

It really is a terrific system by the Ravens. Lamar would fail on about 27 other teams; but the Ravens did a great job accommodating for him. 

Lamar is a great athlete; just not a great QB."
"Yall need to calm the fuck down. He is I
in no way a shit QB. Hes atleast better than our backups."
This is stupid. Immature and idiot fans post crap like this and think it’s funny or cool.  Lamar Jackson is a really good player who had a bad game and almost still beat us.

PS. Last year likewise to you we were 7-0 and people were saying we didn't play any REAL teams. Just keep rolling and zone out the haters. 7-0 is 7-0."
I think niners had a much better run game. Where as Steelers have a better pass game.
Appreciate the kind words and the parallels from the niners 19 run. Didn’t think of that before. By the way big fan of Kyle. I love how he calls games and his run game. My favorite running scheme in the game.
Oh this steelers team is a different animal my friend.
"I live in 49er territory so I saw them plenty last year. The 49ers had a better run game but, outside of Kittle, the Steelers have a much better passing game.

We’re on a collision course with KC for the AFC crown!"
"Last year I read somewhere a post predicting exactly this: ""The Steelers could be the 49ers of 2020"". I'm just happy we are not losing to crappy teams anymore."
Yep I see it too.. if we had your running game I don't think we could be stopped.  Your runningbacks were nasty man!

It is really funny how you never post unless you have something to rip Tomlin and/or the coaching staff with.

"Also I know the general rules, but I get lost with technical terminology. So a easy to digest content source would be appreciated!

I have watched the highlights shows or the big match ups, but what makes a team “good”, apart from a qb that can throw and dudes that can catch? How does a mediocre player differ from elite? Those little differences are lost on me. And I’d like to know more! I’ve watched AFL and Rugby all my life so that’s my frame of reference, but the sports are so different from each other."
"I recommend the Pat McAfee show... its on youtube, sirius satellite... will get you some humorous and factual takes on most of the top NFL stories.  They also do their own betting and predictions for games each week.  And a fair amount of inappropriate humor."
"Second the Pat McAfee show. And of course watch games! I've been a life-long Steeler fan and to this day there are moments where I learn something new about the NFL. It's a very bizarre sport and after decades watching you kinda feel like a lawyer citing precedent any time something wonky happens, which is often. 

> How does a mediocre player differ from elite?  

This is such a hard question to answer since it's very position dependent and dependent on coaches. But it boils down to execution and consistency. The elite player does great things more frequently than the mediocre player. That might seem dumb and obvious, but it's the best answer I can give.

Some guys are capable of freakish performances but you'll never hear of them doing it again. And then there are guys who do it every week. 

I mention coaching because players need to also be put in positions to succeed. The Miami Dolphins did NOT use Minkah Fitzpatrick well. Trade him to the Steelers and the dude has multiple INTs returned for 6 in less than a year. LeVeon Bell was great on our team, sucked behind the Jets putrid offensive line. 

Which then brings me to my last point: It's a team sport unlike any other. A deficiency in one unit will absolutely affect the rest. Bad OL? Good luck throwing deep balls when your QB is in the dirt. Bad WRs? Good luck blocking on the outside to run the ball or converting clutch third downs. Bad DL? No sacks for you. Bad RBs? No winning time of possession, your defense is going to get tired, you lose. 

So a good team is a balanced one, one whose weakest unit is still above average. It's hard to even say what our weakest unit is right now, and that's the sign of a great team."

For me getting the 3-4 vs 4-3 and how the body shape and style of LBs changes due to each formation was a key point. And then in the later Maddens understanding the Hi-Lo reads etc to get how a play is developing was pretty great.

I know some people may slate me for this opinion but honestly without it I wouldn't stay up to the middle of the night to watch the sport, so it may be what you're looking for."

We could win the next 10 consecutive Super Bowls and people will move the goal post 10 times
when the season is over we can tally up the wins vs winning record teams and loosing record and see how that looks.
Fact is: people hate when you’re better than them. Steeler nation 🤘🏻
"Steelers total record of teams is better than chiefs, Seahawks, ravens etc 

Steelers are also 5th in offensive ppg and 6th in defensive ppg"
"I was discussing with a friend yesterday, we look at Seahawks' record and damn.. they are one of the best teams, but the record is not as impressive as it looks: Falcons, Patriots, Cowboys, Vikings and 49ers.. (Dolphins seems to have a promissing future though, the win aged well)

I believe our two last wins make the record much more solid than theirs."
My favorite new one is how analysts discredit our performance against a 5-2 Baltimore squad and say that we got lucky because Lamar is now suddenly overrated but then praise Brady and the Bucs after nearly losing to the 1-6 NYG.
Our effectiveness in the no huddle yesterday was startling compared to our ineffectiveness in the first half. Let Ben cook a little early in the game to give our offense a spark. #letbencook
@tomlin and fichtner hire this man
7-0?  Burn it down!  Change everything!  Fire Tomlin!  Sign Kaepernick!
I don't think it was the huddle that was causing Ben to miss every single throw
also going five wide with 35 seconds on the play clock allows Ben to do what he does best. find the mismatch on the best wr group in the league and audible.
"What’s up guys fellow yinzer here been a steeler fan since the day i was born. Still remember the dime thrown to Hines Ward from Randel-El like It was yesterday. Anyway, i was wondering if you guys would be interested in an analysis of the Steelers so far this year? Not necessarily breaking down each game and going through It per say, but more of a look at how we have progressed from opening on Monday night, to the last game against the ravens and things like noticeable halftime adjustments, stand out players, who’s underperforming (relative to our expectations) and as Tomlin would say “things of that nature”. I’m trying to dip my feet into the waters of scouting and figures doing things like this couldn’t hurt so i was just wondering if yinz would be interested in It if i started posting these videos in the subreddit? Any feedback helps thanks!"
The sub is always looking for more content. Just don't be surprised to get some yinzers blowing up your comments if they disagree with you.
"All the TV sports pundits who think because you have the most yards and time of possession that shows you’re weakness I f#ck you. The Steelers has 254 yards and do you know why, because that’s all they needed. The main stat is the Steelers had four more points than the Ravens when the gun went off. Haters and doubters would be going nuts if Pittsburgh lost to any of the teams they played so far. It boggles the mind how nonsensical these “experts” perceive being undefeated. This team won eight games without a QB and never gave up. To my Steelers I give much love, 7-0 and the leaders of the pack!"

Great Job with this. With our history of playing down to bad teams and probably missing 2 starting d-linemen against a good running back I am concerned
Shiny.
Perfection.
I'm an undefeated football team...watch how I beat the Cowb-grhrhrhhrr*dies*
I'll be in my bunk
"I’m a Zeke without a win, watch me soar...."
Could be a Tomlin Special but might be too early.
"Hello fellow fans! 

I posted this deep in another thread regarding The Terrible Towel, but I wanted to bring it front and center to get more opinion and see if we can get any traction. Having watched an excellent video on the history of Renegade, wouldn't it be fantastic for the Steelers organization to make an app for fans attending road games to have a synchronized, team managed ""official"" playing of Renegade over everyone's phones!? 

Obviously it wouldn't likely be heard on the sideline, (once fans are actually allowed in stadiums) but the road fans would be going crazy together at the appropriate time, and would hopefully be singing together in sync loud enough to be heard by our players. It would have to work almost like a 'push notification' on a signal sent by a Steelers media manager to begin playing Renegade when the app is running. This would have been fantastic during either the fourth-down stand, or the game ending pass defence.

I just think it would be amazing for every fan running the app to be synched with Renegade, wherever they are.

Cheers from Canada."
"I did send this idea into the Steelers.com email contact form, but have zero expectations of any sort of reply."
Why aren’t we funding this?!?!?!
I love this idea.
Wait this is genius.
amazing
I would use the app at home to go crazy
Yes please

Weird mix of people
They are from Giant Eagle. There are a couple of them on E-Bay asking for $20.
The Bam Morris coin good for several hundred pounds of weed.
I'll give you 30. Lol
I remember getting these from giant eagle as a kid.
I have one too. Pap and grandma got my brother and I both the complete set
"Omg

Sweet find!"
"Steelers beat the Titans

Titans lost to the Bengals

...

Steelers beat the Ravens

Ravens lost to Chiefs

Chiefs lost to Raiders (also Browns lost to Raiders)

Raiders lost to the Patriots

Patriots lost to the Broncos

...

What I'm saying is... The only team we are definitely better than is the Jets and there are no good teams in the NFL to beat this year."
"Its just the Giants

Its just the Broncos

Its just the Texans

Its just the Eagles

Its just the Browns

Its just the Titans

Its just the Ravens <--- You are here"
Yep. Nobody. Appalachian State could probably beat the Steelers right now.
">The only team we are definitely better than is the Jets

Yeah but the Jets beat us in Week 16 last year lol"
There’s always next year I guess let’s just hope the NFL gives us some tougher opponents
"We were overrated by everyone 5 years ago when we had no defense. Don't matter to me, the excuse now for TN and Baltimore is well if not for this that or whatever they'd have won those games."
"Watching other games there’s really no one that good this year.  The Steelers really do look like the best team.  Obviously the Chiefs are the biggest threat, but everyone looks beatable.  I REALLY like out chances this year."
"This is a classic trap game for the Steelers right? Big win against the Ravens, now they play a down and out Cowboys team that they play down to... Ugh"
"Fifth game in a row, third straight away game, after back to back games against 2 of the top teams in the AFC, after a huge rivalry game is a possible upset for any team not just the Steelers"
You people will bitch about absolutely anything.  I passed a half dozen people who would be good enough to start on the 2020 Cowboys between here and my mailbox this afternoon.
bad bot
Steelers football baby.
"I know we play down to bad teams, but Dallas is beyond bad right now. I could however see Cincy causing us fans some anxiety."
"From 2015 to 1018, Tomlin and Belichick have the same record when it comes to losing to bad teams.  So that should tell you that shit just happens sometimes.  Any given Sunday is saying for a reason."
"Right now the Cowboys remind me of last year’s Steelers team. Except their defense is historically bad, and ours was the best in the league. Dalton is kinda similar to Rudolph, and DiNucci is practically their version of Duck but not as good. The only thing I worry about is hangover from playing a physical Baltimore squad and giving up big plays like we did against Miles Sanders and AJ Brown since Elliott and the Dallas receivers do have that ability as well"
"Come on, DiNucci.  He solves a lot of worries."
Bengals for me is our trap game. I think we will do Okay against the cowboys
"Looking through these comments, I don’t understand how people don’t realize that the Steelers are known for playing down. And it’s not just me being a Tomlin hater. All 31 other fanbases and yinzers that aren’t complete homers (including Tomlin supporters) know very well of Steelers tradition. Until we can consistently play up to our ability against shit teams, it’s gonna keep happening"

Just in time for the Ravens LETS GOOOO
Looks like we dodged 2 bullets 🙏
Best case Ontario boys
Oh lucky... must be a minor sprain to be 2 weeks at most.  And definitely should not rush him back... his health going into Thanksgiving is the biggest factor right now compared to the next 3 games.
"So back for the ravens

allllright"
"Bullshit, I saw him do the stretchy test. MCL tore clean off the bone, I would know, I have knees."
Take three just to be safe please
Blessed
HALLEALUALU!
But the 33 team doctors in the post game thread said that Alualu and Heyward both had ACL tears????
Fantastic news. Avoiding a major injury to him/Cam is huge.
perfect timing! get healthy for the stretch
Fucking Ravens games and the injuries they cause... amirite?
A win in Baltimore and our injuries sustained are short term AND we don’t have too difficult of a short term schedule? This is the way.
"Great, our next two matchups *should*  be gimme wins"
Bros I can not fucking tell you how HAPPY I A WITH THIS NEWS. WE'RE GOING FOR THE FUCKING SUPER BOWL BITCHES
Thank god. I thought it was his MCL
"I haven't looked ahead at our schedule, but hopefully he can recuperate during our bye week. I'm sure everyone is more than a little banged up after the slog they've been through recently."
"I have a friend whos dad passed away this morning and they want to bury him in a Hines Ward jersey. I was wondering if anyone in the gta area has a XXL Ward jersey they could possibly sell to me. The service is on Wednesday and i know its short notice, but might as well try here as well. Thanks guys."
Yoooo check your pms I have a 2xl home and away. I’m in Toronto. https://imgur.com/a/07G5zbW
You have my sympathies.  I've got an XL Watt jersey in Cobourg that you could have if nothing else comes in.
I have an XL or XXL Hines jersey but it is at my Dad's in Mississippi. I dont think it can make it there by the time he is buried but we can definitely send it your way as some kind of memorial.
I just so happen to have a home one but it's in Peru so getting it up there on time is unlikely. Looks like someone else got your back. My condolences for your homie.
Who are the Toronto Steelers?
""
This is so surprising. Wtf
Surprised more teams haven’t done it this year alone with how much scoring has increased this season. I would not consider us anywhere near the top offenses this year.
"Every time I read something like this, it just feels like the internet is trying to jinx us."
"Steelers need to change their offense and go to 5 wide (using a back) every play like New England did in 07’.

No one can stop them if we play no-huddle the entire game."
"Should be no problem to put up 30+ next week. Knock on wood, right?"
"It kills me to say this in a way, but this team feels like a Bill Belichick Patriots team.  No divas.  Tomlin is using multiple RBs each game more than he has in the past. Ben getting rid of the ball fast.  No clear number 1 WR, they just ride the hot hand and take what the D gives them.  Significant players get hurt but they get major  contributions from guys who most fans barely knew anything about in training camp.  Hang close to 30 each game even if the stats don’t seem to support it.  Always come up with that go ahead drive just when it looks like they’re beat."
Weren’t we getting shit about not being able to put up enough points like last month lol
"The Seahawks also did it this year. The thing is, they lost one game."
"This team is astonishing how good they could actually be if they played a full 60min in all 3 phases...they are the best team in the league and they haven't put together a perfect game yet besides Cleveland... every game there has been some glaring quarter where a phase is actively trying to lose the game, Defense letting teams get back in when they are 2-3 scores back, offense just being a 3 in out or turnover machine, etc...Its great to see we legit haven't even come close to hitting our ceiling...I hope to see us hitting that next gear when the playoffs come like many SB winning teams do"
"They struggle badly at times, but do give off an impression that when they really want to score or move the ball, they do or can.  There's 4 WR's on the field at any given time who are capable of a splash play."
"I guess the reasons are
1. We don’t give up drives that eat up the clock (except for the ravens game) since our d is great at stopping runs.
2. Our d gives the offense good field position
3. I think we’re pretty good in red zone(don’t have stats to back this up though)"
"All 32 teams have scored 26 or more points in their first 7 games (I think).

This tweet is worded wrong & it pisses me off that nobody has said something yet."

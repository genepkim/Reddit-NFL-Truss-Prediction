i couldnt watch the video because this dude looks like a dorky looking douchebag was this a buck allen meme type of video or is this dude really this stupid
awww does someone need attention
big rape and the steelers are overrated and overhyped the steelers fan base is talking like they are going 160 this season sorry to break it to you pittsburgh but lamar jackson and the baltimore ravens are back and winning this game baltimore ravens nfl steelersfansaredumb
lol this guy
yessir lamar a runningback overrated and useless too

did i do that right guys
how many subs has this post gotten removed from
our d is so much better than last year

the man didnt have a preseason hes 51 and only getting better
i love this perspective i would be curious to see a comparison of our run game stats though i realize our run game was historically good and you cant expect that kind of success every year but it doesnt feel like our identity this year like it did last year
this is damned good perspective
yall remember when we beat the seahawks last year seattle and it give us a hugeee boost in confidence im hoping we can re create that this week against a top 5 team i dont really see us losing to another team besides the steelers im probably reaching here but we can re create the season we had last year and top it off with a sb only other competition we have is the titans and maybe the patriots but other than that we can really run the table
show our yards per attempt passing

i think hes been reported as a big fan of ms carters kitchen soul food
the browns
other teams soul
you might be right man i could totally see him sippin on a nice refreshing strawberry milkshake after a game at his locker with his best bud hollywood
obviously wheaties the breakfast of champions

fuller for me
fuller is there most impactful receiver in that he makes teams respect the deep ball but cooks is there best wr and would be the best fit for us
definitely fells he should be pretty cheap and gives us the chance to use legit 3 te sets again
fuller is an injury risk and cooks is a concussion risk i would be wary about signing either

fells doesnt excite me but like you said a quality third te could be valuable for us
wonder what it would take to have them let jj watt go maybe saya 5th rounder s
i like cobb
how about we cut hollywood a break i dont think hurting your foot once should able you injury prone also too soon to call him just a speed guy
i just mainly wanted to share my excitement i cant be more stoked to go ive been living in ny now for 5 years and havent had a chance to go to a game in the lamar era but can finally go under unlikely circumstances the last of which was winning in the lottery

if you want me to go check on your seats for you or something else let me know much love
please scream really loud

if i hear you its super bowl guaranteed
puck fittsburgh
howd you get the tickets
jealous
how much did you pay for it
sometimes i think im the only one still living in a pandemic lol

please stay home if you can
we should have a code word you scream it and then we know
ahhhhh enjoy my first ravens game i ever got to go to was lamars debut completely by chance i got my ticket at the beginning of the year have a blast you will love it hes so fun to watch in person
congrats bro i personally hope its not your best experience because im a cough steelers fan but i hope u have a great time i live in md and mt bank stadium is a great experience
simple as that

with a win we announce ourselves as last years ravens ready to fuck up the afc north

we lose and we might not see the playoffs
i think its a little soon to be saying a loss against one of the leagues best means no playoffs
we are 51 we can afford a lost if it happens lol
a loss doesnt mean much ravens are going to the playoffs
horrible take
uh theres a good chance that 3 teams from our division make the playoffs this year
after our bye we usually make our presence felt time for our playoff push
dont forget theres an extra playoff spot starting this year i hardly think 52 means we wont be in the playoffs

weve been spoiled the past couple years back with flacco we were thrilled going 97 and squeezing a playoff birth out of it
the schedule is too easy weeks 1417 to miss playoffs lol
does this game have strong afc north implications yes

does a loss mean possibly missing the playoffs not at all

hyperbolic takes like this are just as bad if not worse than declaring that well stunt on those hoes
this game is huge for the division title

but both of these teams are almost certainly making the playoffs
i dont see any scenario in which we dont make the playoffs

tbh the only thing that matters to me for the rest of the season is fixing up holes and getting better with our execution it doesnt matter if we get to last years form to go one and done again
hmmm maybe i worded this post wrong wont be the first time

my point was in regard to our teams attitude and general outlook on the future

hope im wrong
ah yes we will miss the playoffs that will now have 7 teams from all those juggernauts in the afcwhat a stupid ass statement we will likely split the series against pitt this year and probably drop a couple more like the titans we will be fine
fan from australia here got hooked on nfl while in the states in 2017 and picked the ravens before the start of the 2018 season when we drafted lamar worked out pretty well so far

some hot takes here

tomorrow they rushed to get his deal done so he could do his covid protocol and 2 day quarantine prior to the facility for practice same with dezs tryout with 2 others
just a thought i dont think the vikings were as stupid as people think they are with the yannick trade

first off the vikings gave up a 2nd round draft pick and a conditional 5th round pick

vikings made this deal thinking they would be contenders for the play offsthey are at 1 and 5 they aint going to the playoffs

yannick is a very good linebacker his rookie contract is up this year the contract we now have him on top end linebackers are getting 15 million a year he could be expecting a payday of 20 million a year or more now we know the cap is likely to go down for 2021 many teams are going be facing tough decisions and the question the vikings needed to ask themselves

do we keep a star like yannick on our team knowing full well that come next season hes going be demanding a big paydayor do we trade him and get some draft picks to use to rebuild a team with

now what we did we give the vikings for yannick

3rd round 2021 draft pick
conditional 5th round pick for 2022

now i couldnt find out what the conditions for the 5th round pick is but basically the vikings got back almost what they gave which is more value to them if they had kept him had they kept him ok their team gets a few more sacks maybe produces a few more turn overs they still dont make it to the play offs yannick goes into free agency and its unlikely the vikings would have been able to pay yannick enough to stay

the ravens are a play off contender team also yannick wanted to be back in maryland yannick wants a ring and the ravens is the perfect combo who knows maybe because of those factors we get a team friendly deal out of yannick if not well hes very likely to help us making a deeper run this year in the play offs which is something we are all hoping for

this deal was good for both sides hindsight is 2020 and im sure the vikings would have prefered to have never acquired yannick but at least they got most of what they paid for him back i think eric decosta saw that and that is why we got such a great deal for yannick
agree sunk cost fallacy
steelers fan coming here in peace i was so upset when you guys traded for yannick it felt like the only piece missing on an already amazing defense how does your front office seem to constantly get these talented guys for next to no draft capitol its starting to feel a bit unfair lol im looking forward to this sunday it should be an awesome game like most times we play you guys
conditions on the 5th are it becomes a 4th if yannick makes 1st team allpro
thing is they would probably have gotten a 3rd round come pick for him anyways but that would have been for 2022 basically they got a 5th rounder back and got a 1year advance on their 3rd rounder all the while helping tank for a better pick its not a horrible trade but im surprised they couldnt get a 2nd back for him
dont forget comp picks the viks would have gotten one ifwhen he left in free agency and we will get one if we dont give him a big deal and he walks after half a season with us so viks basically get a conditional 5th for him because theyd have likely gotten a compensatory 3rd for him assuming a big contract elsewhere now if we end up losing him we get the comp pick instead so worst case scenario we get a fantastic player for half a season and it just cost us a conditional 5th best case we extend him and he becomes a long term member of the flock
yeah theyre just trying to make the best out of a bad situation by recouping draft picks while also jettisoning a pricey player not as awful on their part as people make it out to believe theyre prepping for the tank
2019 week 4 ravens lose to browns 4025

ravens ilbs were abused both in run and pass coverage afterwards the ravens signed experienced ilbs lj fort and josh bynes to take over for the mistake prone kenny young these 2 players greatly exceed their midseason signing expectations

x200b

2019 week 6 ravens beat bengals 2317

entering this game the ravens were down their slot cb and cb2 as a result the ravens had carr at cb1 averett at cb2 and humphrey in the slot a horrible bengals offense was suffocated on most fronts but were able to move the chains vs the weak link cb anthony averett the ravens defense could not function with such a weak secondary that they needed desperately to make up for the weak pass rush this resulted in the ravens trading for cb marcus peters who quickly replaced averett and turned a weakness to a strength

x200b

2019 afc playoffs divisional round ravens lose to titans 2812

the ravens didnt trust gus edwards to replace mark ingram so the offense had to rely on solely lamar all game as great as lamar is he cant carry an entire offense on his own to make sure theyre never in this situation again they draft jk dobbins to deepen the rb group and have a backup plan for ingram
derrick henry ran all over a ravens defense that was weak in run defense and relied on their elite secondary the ravens defense relied on the ravens offense scoring points quickly to force the opposing offense to abandon the run and attack the strength of the ravens defense their secondary however the ravens realized that they need a contingency a backup plan to win games that dont initially go as planned they were exposed that teams could beat them if they take an early lead and their team is built entirely on snowballing an early game lead to counter this the ravens made signings to bolster their run defense and give their team a chance in games where their offense doesnt get off to a hot start calais campbell derek wolf justin madubuike malik harrison and patrick queen

x200b

2020 week 3 ravens lose to chiefs 3420

the ravens defense relied on blitzing to generate pass rush and let their secondary do the rest mahomes is a blitz killer and knew exactly how to attack the blitz the ravens get yannick ngakoue to pair with calais campbell and make a decent pass rush at least therefore they dont have to blitz as much against elite minds that know how to deal with blitzes
ravens offense went pass heavy way too quickly after just a 3 point deficit this was a panic move and we wont know this issue is fixed until the ravens are in a similar situation where they are down by 1 score issue unresolved
ravens offense couldnt play from behind because of a lackluster pass offense largely due to unreliable targets andrews is obviously reliable and brown has his moments but an offense cant just have one reliable target or else defenses will key in on him defenses have been keying in on andrews a lot this year i think the next and final move the ravens will make before the trade deadline is a 2nd reliable target for lamar an edelman like wr that has high agility and yac to excel underneath issue unresolved
i think duvernay would be a great yac receiver but doesnt look like we are scheming plays for him at least not yet i want to see him on slants and crossing routes so show off his speed
this is a great edc is very good at addressing holes in the roster the problem is and has always been that harbaugh is only as good as his coordinators and right now they arent very good at adjusting

roman came up with a good scheme last year but has been unable to adjust to the league his schemes dont produce open recievers he doesnt throw screens and he abandons the run part of this is personnel you cant fix boykin choosing the wrong options but its gotta get better

wink has built one of the best defenses in the league but when forced to contain mahomes his go to was blitz after blitz which reid beat with screen after screen yannick should go a long was to fixing this but this defense still needs to play better against good offenses
andrews is not reliable he dropped like 10 passes in the chiefs game including td
i think they need a big body guy that they wanted boykin to become their slot is covered between snead and duvernay they also need an ol
while i agree that andrews is normally reliable the thing that stands out to me is how much he dropped passes in the titans and chiefs losses its like when he gets the yips the offense sputters anyone else notice that
i really hope roman took this bye week as an opportunity to draw up some schemes to get guys open defenses adjusted and have been able to shut our o down now we have to adjust and figure out what theyre doing and how we can counter it

that and getting duvernay and dobbins involved more will help theyre both more explosive than our other options at those positions and they need to get more touches
the team seems to get cocky whe ahead and then they make mistakes its cost them repeatedly
doesnt the dez signing address issue number 3 for this year

sure we dont know if it will work out but a solid move has been made

im more concerned about the interior oline having four dhopkins out there wont matter if lamar is running for his life every play

same ill give him a call later and ask

we dont need another de and griffin has not been good this year
if were trading with the cowgirls give me gallup
we might wanna be careful giving up too many picks especially when theyre for aging guys like everson griffin
nah this isnt a good trade at all even for a 5th
lions gave dallas a conditional 6th doing their best edc impression
this makes absolutely no sense they need to stop beefing up the defense and address the ol this aint gonna happen edc cant be involved in something do daft
lol i guess i shouldve prefaced this post by saying that im just poking fun at the idea that it seems like edc can get anyone he wants for a fifth round pick i for one dont really want everson griffin nor do i think we need him just thought itd be a nice little joke
we dont need a de now the only one id consider trading for is jj watt

the contract was never the problem it was more that two of the most wellrun and stable organizations in the nfl decided it wasnt worth having a top 5 wr on their team
i told someone like a week ago ab isnt getting a star or even average contract at his position he was gonna have to earn it just like cam does
000 guaranteed money that means anybody couldve had him but only one team wanted him
removed

his passing stats so far are as good or better than at the same point last year hes not running as much and thats deliberate have patience friend

im a simple man i see jojo and i see truzz and i upvotes
ive been out the anime game a while
as a jojo fan and a ravens fan this makes me feel happiness
lol this is awesome do i need to finish watching this show only got like 15 seasons in
so my defense star purple is the same as your steel curtain
big ben out there like some walking road rolla so we gotta use the same type of pass rush to get to him
now we need jojo memes for patrick killa queen
amazing conflicting because my screen name everywhere else is it was i dio but amazing

is this anime good
please all the jojo ravens gifs we can make my two favorite things
this is awesome man

im another longtime ravens fan from north of the border i made it down to mt bank in 2010 when we beat the saints i had to watch my guys ed reed and jarret johnson do their thing i made the short trip down to cleveland last year to watch lamar for the first time all the cleveland fans thought i was from ocean city i had to look up ocean city after the game as always fuck the steelers
one of us one of us one of us
another canadian ravens fan woop woop


yeah i was made they got claypool too saw a guy with a jersey of his a few weeks ago


depending on where you are in canada the drive to baltimore isnt remarkably far around 8 hours anywhere between montreal and toronto really worth it 100 recommend when allowed again
ravens fan from alberta here fuck the steelers

i feel you on claypool though

edit autocorrect got me
welcome to the coolest fans around eh
longtime ravens fan from alabama here fuck the steelers edc has a slong so big elephants look on in envy also browns fans stfu about us stealing your team you dont know pain

phew that felt good
nhl team
as a norte dame guy i didnt think he would be as good as hes been i swear it isnt the pitt front office nailing receiver picks it is some magic shit in the water in pittsburgh and you cannot tell me otherwise
i think its dope that the flock is worldwide and love hearing from fans from other countries
chiming in from canada as well what made the ravens your team for you
there are literally dozens of us checking in from vancouver got to go to the seahawks game last year for my birthday went alone and spent the whole day drinking purple jerseys went nuts after the peters picksix went out to celebrate after and everyone was really friendly
seahawks and ravens fans alike

fuck the steelers
canadians
welcome friends question are any of you cfl fans as well if so what team
thoughts on nfl expansion in canada

ok more than 1 question

fuck the steelers
wethenorth

made to the nye game against the bengals for my first ever nfl game and damn it was colder than the north lol
andrews and ertz wouldve been a deadly duo
f5 all day
my gf is an eagles fan so i watch a ton of their games the eagles havent targeted ertz often this year half of his targets are last ditch thrones either in double coverage or too highlowtheyve also been trying to develop their younger guys since theyre often way more open ertz is an allpro tein a shitty situation id be pumped to see him in baltimore
ertz has been booty cheeks all season i picked up his backup on the waver after he went down and the backup played far better than ertz has
we got rid of hurst because there werent enough targets for him here maybe im missing something
46 week timetable may even be cheaper for a playoff type move
hope this means in general that we are looking to add a 3rd tight end
no nick boyle love here lol
would be cool if they added another legit tight end hopefully they keep trying perhaps someone not as good as ertz but an averageserviceable te available for a late round pick already low on draft capital this year with 3rd gone and only 1 projected comp pick

ok boykin learn from dez
cowboys fan here you guys are getting a passionate guy who intensely loves the game and wants to win i hope he can contribute
expectations are almost nothing but it would be a cool story if he comes back after that long and can make the gameday roster and be productive


edit

to the guy who responded calling me young but  his comment dez hasnt played football in three years thats a lot of time to be out of the game
officially official

wonder how long until hes on the game day roster if at all
almost no risk high reward
ozzie tries to draft him in 2010 jumped by cowboys

ozzie tries to sign him in 2018 turns down multiyear deal for a proveit and gets hurt

third times a charm welcome to the flock dez hope youre more anquansteve smith sr than michael crabtree
dez caught it
it was deztined

love youuuuuuuuuuuuuu
he can be pulled up on game days because of the covid rules right we can activate someone from the practice squad so we could probably try him out in game with no risk to anyone elses roster spot
hopefully he can make an impact we dont need the flashy speedy dez of old as we have brown we just need a receiver that can get 8yards downfield be open and catch the ball
last time i got excited for a veteran receiver it was crabtree this situation is obviously a lot different but we all know how that turned out lol
great news hell be ready for next week and beyond hopefully hes a rock solid addition based on some of his recent youtube videos where he is absolutely unstoppable
ya we got a tall boy to go with our speedy boys
i mostly just follow the ravens so forgive me but why was dez just sitting around over the past few years
as long as he can come up with a tough catch or two a game ill be more than happy
im not super hyped about this dez should have taken the deal we offered him last time and i dont think our offense needs more wrs if he even turns out to be good after 3 years without playing i think we just need to start being more creative with play calling and utilizing our top tier rbs but if he contributes and keeps his ego in check then i cant complain
lets fucking go love you edc
lets gooooo
glad he is here but he still has a ways to go before seeing the field
man i just want to see him throw the x up one more time
after his emotional response i hope he makes the team
this is awesome yes he wont be what he was and years away from the game is tough to overcome but people forget he was one of the best receivers in the league its not like we just brought back tandon doss or something
i think this will work out dez is a big body possession wide receiver ready to prove to everyone he can still play hell make the wr room better with his presence and experience
here is hoping hes full healthy comes back explosive and does great for us and for him nothing more than seeing someone making a comeback in their career and having the ravens organization is going to help
i like this even if dez never makes it up from the practice squad he still brings a lot of experience to a very young receiving crew
on his twitter

emotions running high right nowim thankfuli cant stop crying

this dude fought so hard to come back lets go

side note i went to see him vs andrew luck in a bowl game live and thought he was the best college wr i ever saw live
excited but not getting my hopes and dreams up obviously our wr core just got better with this signing but dez is coming back from a long absence of footballinjuries going to have to be very veryvery patient with him honestly i think we wont see his full potential until the playoffs dez isnt the answer to our offense but he is a nice addition our sb run depends all on lamar jackson and how he is able to cope with adversity
why do you think they signed him to ps and not the active rosters
useless
source the ravens are signing wr dez bryant to the practice squad officially back

probably not the best plan with his injury history to wear the 88 in baltimore the last 88s freak injury ended his career
still hate that guy he should have joined us years ago and we wouldnt have had to settle for craptree
boykin needs to go to the bench for the time being to learn

i think its fair for fans to be hopefully optimistic but we must be realistic too its highly unlikely we get this version or even a version close to this but if we got close to even half of what he once was it could be beneficial for us

but it all starts at the line they need to improve for our receivers to improve
side note hurry back dak
this being 4 years ago already makes me feel kinda sick
steelers fans here im not too familiar with the protocols what are the chances he plays sunday
as a cowboys fan im so stoked for this hes gonna be a huge red zone threat when he is activated
im a cowboys fan lurking the dez posts and seeing how much time dak had back when our line was healthy was surreal i miss it
fuck the steelers
you mean the defense that was on pace to be the best defense the nfl has ever seen


yeah but the steelers are wayyyy better than the oats last year dont lie to yourself about that lol
fuck the oats

fuck the steelers
fts we got this

its so odd to me that that emoji is a crying emoji i always use it as a laughing emoji
10 years later than it should have happened
is he going to see much if any action outside of practice he hasnt played a snap in over 3 years at this point right
just wait til he gets us that game changing clutch td maybe even in a playoff
oh how the turntables
why did it take so long for him to get picked up

can someone explain to me what this deal is for is he being brought on the team to help teach our wrs is he going to practice squad to get in shape for maybe starting week 13 or 14 on our roster i am so baffled by this i love dez but i just thought this guy are finished is he here to be a possession receiver to fill our ever lasting void of bolden someone educate me please

id like to give a huge shoutout to dean and his team from thread level midnight for helping make mos rows a reality i am honored to be a part of this kids memory mo we miss your giggle on the fan your infectious energy and your ridiculous picktoclicks lets stack those wins ravens nation
this is so cute fly high mo
got mine too along with my fk cancer shirt

really a very well done package and these shirts are really high quality
agreed beautiful thing to receive and a beautiful soul to celebrate miss you mo
was this special order or are they still available
dang i didnt get the certificate or card
i didnt realize this was a thing then you
pretty incredible

see him dec 3rd vs the cowboys
i think he will our production at the position has been nonexistent we could put moore on the field and not even know
he will because boykin is a bonafide scrub

theyre leaking onto ticketmaster and stubhub but be prepared to pay most are listed at 2x face value right now
i havent seen anything for this weekend but if you wanna go on the 26th the cheapest ticket available is for 350 on ticketmaster
i have an extra if your willing to pay a steelers fan one of my friends cancelled dm me if interested
i have two to sell in section 136 corner endzone on the ravens side id like to sell above face but would go below current market to sell to a ravens fan
recently moved to the uk a few years ago from the dmv

x200b

here to say fuck the steelers
yinzers are the chavs of the mid atlantic change my mind
how do you watch the games

why would they put up with it for so long then give up when they finally have burrow
why they have a rebuilding team with a legit qb so they got spanked in the second half by a rival 3 seasons down the rebuild line it happens

burrow looks better than mayfield
all of their games except when they played us have been within a score this is great for them imo they are still a competitive team that just has a few holes to fill and once filled will again be the pain in the ass of the division they are sorta tanking but gracefully next year this division is going to be insane
that game was the final straw

it does my heart good to see we have an international fan base
my completely korean cousin in korea is a huge ravensorioles fan ppl have no idea what the bird is about but every once in awhile he meets a westerner and they strike up a conversation

go ravens
where u at english raven fan living in groningen rn
dutch flock represent yessir belee dat
greetings from the german ravens flock
that flag brings back very mixed memories yes the game was fun regardless but it was also very painful
whos the signature from
my great grand parents are from rotterdam i need one of these flags
the more the better
i have the same flag hanging above my tv the every decibel counts flag
so i knew we had a big following in the uk and i think the wires timing with the old ravens squad helped that but im starting to think were the international team thats pretty darn cool
getting ready for sunday in norway above the arctic circle too ravens fan since 96 fuck the steelers
hup hup
thanks for the international love bird bro you have good taste


his nose never looked the same after that
when you rape people you pay a price
upshaw had a sick sack against big ben i think im 2013 although it got called back for a penalty
i hope something similar happens this week big ben is a shit human and i enjoy watching him get hit and hit hard
i was at this game i will always love seeing this video

fuck the steelers
normally i hate to see any player get injured but this was a different story
can we also not forget ray lewis knocking out hines ward
back when we had a pass rush remember the golden days when our run d was insane
bring this energy sunday
i always wondered why his nose was so crooked
i dont even see how ngata broke shitheads nose i guess rapelessburgers helmet hit the ground funny


wouldnt mind signing him long term
give yannick what we were gonna pay judon and show judon the door please
get hudons scrub ass outta here


he sucks but i would not mind with averets injury tbh
id rather pilfer some teams practice squad
maybe edc always up to something tho
i would unironically rather roll into the game with bonds or dorsey at cb4 and wait for averett who is way better to get healthy
maybe practice squad idk
i rather have gilmore

im ready for the offense to start clicking its gonna feel so good i think its gonna be tough to establish the run game with our ol vs their dl but its gonna be pretty important to us winning

real talk i know goku and saitama are the big bois but do yall think all might in his prime can hang

ravens better not come out flat thats all i know
steelers fans shitting on lamars passing volume but ignore that hes averaging about 60 on the ground and is still top 10 in qbr
if the ravens win im going to need the highlights video to have the ultra instinct music behind it
they should flex this game to prime time
so who is android 17 the real winner of the tournament
i am a steelers fan i just came out of the rsteelers subreddit and saw this all i am gonna say is that this is gonna be a good game
lamar mastered ultra instinct this sunday
well this is my new background for the week good luck clean game all that jazz

as long as we split 11 for the season its all i can ask well that and jackson with under 30 rushing yards
this will be one of the most intense games of the entire season in all of the nfl i am expecting an extremely close asshole quenching game but hoping for a surprise slaying of the steelers
the bye didnt help when we were in the playoffs last year tho
you know goku lost to jiren right you expecting the browns and bengals to be frieza and 17 or something
if this game doesnt result in our new pass rushers obliterating roth ill be disappointed
i can hear the music in this picture
not a fan of how we match up but any given sunday lets get it
as a chiefs fan take my energy

edit ps love you brothers in badassery
logo isnt even a fucking thing
that does not look like a steeler but more so a 49er knockoff
damn anyone else remember what happened last year in the playoffs after a bye week
okay
last time yall came off a bye week yall got absolutely embarrassed in a playoff game

that being said screw the steelers i hope you guys beat them
your neighborhood bengals fan just passing through
not gonna lie though ravens arent looking all that great imo they only faced one good team so far and got mauled

glad to have you back dude good video i think the week 2 vid ran a little long and youre better off sticking to the ravens
i love seeing this thanks for the video as a baltimore native a ravens fan and a nz all blacks supporter i sincerely know what its like to cheer for a team few know of cheers
cough cough oline

i mean that is what happened except for lamar dreaming about his 20th ringlol
im happy were relevant and being mentioned with champions im still very optimistic on lamars career so i can definitely laugh at jabs at the ravens
gridiron heights still the goat tho
that shit hurted

will you shut up man
ahhhhhh shaddup
can we stop with this shit
this sub is obsessed with ab youd think hed played for us with how much people are willing to make excuses for him do we need receiver help yea of course but ab just isnt happening
if you want to root for low character pieces of shit go be a bucs fan we dont sign people like ab never will
can you sit and wait until after the deadline for garbage like this
not even a fit for the offense ertzthats a fit
why would you want that toxicity in our locker room this team aint meant for divas


that username though upvotes are mandatory
youd have to order a custom from nflshop or wait until all the fakes start getting made
goodwill in like 11 months
probably nowhere he hasnt even made it off the practice squad yet

why would you want that but im sure you can custom create one
there are a lot of pretty solid fake jerseys on chinese sites like dhgate im pretty sure you can get them custom made
probably from a crackhead in dallas fuck the cowboys and the squeelers

gold
these videos are awesome always make me lol
man flacco had his moments dude gets way too much hate
hahah flacco

same question was asked yesterday

offers were likely rescinded regardless postinjury
i live in southeast pa and see a lot of eagles games ertz looked bad this year so far lot of drops
probably not injury declined production before injury

man i remember like it was yesterday when torrey smith caught that td im pretty sure i shat myself
torrey fucking smith still my favorite drafted ravens wideout
i miss boldin so much

edit fixed link

i like ed getting spun around during a int return and strolling into the end zone backwards doing a moonwalk i think against the redskins but thats more of a clip than a picture
haloti ngata standing over big ben
ed with the lombardi and confetti is prolly my personal fav

its probably not iconic but it will always be one of my lltime favorite ravens games and what the main two did in this picture was epic


do you think we should make a play for odell obviously once he recovers i personally believe he hasnt lost his talent baker mayfield is widely inconsistent and two i think more schematically he just did not fit into that team i think both sides have started to see this may decide that odells departure is the best option i love the idea of having him dez and hollywood brown in addition to our tes our offensive weapons would be pretty good

i understand why people may not want him but i think he has calmed down over the years and since people here wanted antonio brown who i believe is much worse whats wrong with having odell another reason is that he may cost some draft picks and i think our roster has some holes to fill especially on that oline

the only thing im unsure about is the cap hit im not too good at that side of things however i was reading that his contract is worth 15 mill a year and after this season hell have 3 more years on his contract so i dont think it will be too bad on us lamar does needs to get paid soon theres also that to consider

let me know your thoughts
no heres the thing this team isnt for anybody that is going to be calling for the ball constantly because theyre just going to get frustrated and become a cancer
wouldnt be a culture fit wouldnt be worth the cap space with the big names we need to resign
i dont know about his cap space but i would love to have him on the team

it makes sense that quarterbacks drafted into better run organizations tend to do better if thats the case we might be looking at stable quarterback play for years to come even after lamar eventually retires with 3 super bowl ringsplease dont sell the team bisciotti
his conclusion its still too early to answer the question of whos the best qb drafted in 2018

if you cant tell who the best 2018 qb is maybe analysing and writing about football isnt the job for you
this analysis feels incomplete since it doesnt really consider rushing

mascot poe dontari poe
were good no thanks all i want from dallas is gallup nobody else there is worth it
they cant make a roster on one of the worst defenses i have ever seen so no
dontari noe
i mean their defense cant get worse right
first time crossposting i hope i did it right

are any of these good pickups
in terms of should the ravens get them absolutely not worley is one of the worst cbs in the league and if poe cant cut it on that dline sheesh

from a cowboys gm perspective though why cut them now you need bodies to finish the year and if they embrace the tank then these guys are prime candidates
chykie brown and asa jackson
i bet if we cut marlon and marcus we can make it work
i want eric weddle back in some capacity

even as a defensive consultant of some kind

if we want a lethal defense shouldnt we hire ray lewis ifyouknowhatimean

do you need to shout
my biggest pet peeve in the world is posting shit like this and not actually saying how many yards it was lol
ya can we all give a massive fuck you to this guy hes a bigot that supports noi and is an anti semite i get he played well for us but we dont want to hitch our carts to this bigot of a horse do we were better than that as a franchise and a fan base
dont we hate this dude now
skiuuuuuuuup
my guy
uh its sharpe with an e

give lamar quick plays slants give the guy some slants its not pretty but it moves the chains this will then force the defence to play aggressive and closer to the line this will present deep opportunities for hollywood its similar to the run in that sense we need to bait the backs closer to the line to hit them over the top
id like to see some jet sweeps with duvernay and hollywood if we establish those plays as part of our repetoire it will make it much more difficult to defend the rpo on top of that

having to spy on lamar cover the motion man and stop the run is hard to do seechiefs rams
i dont know much about xs and os especially on the offensive side of the ball but i feel like the passing schemes are poorly drawn up and also poorly executed

it seems on a lot of our passes our 3 receivers are utilizing like 13 of the field so we have 3 wrs and 34 defenders all in the same general area making it harder to make the throws or even get open in the first place we then also roll lamar in that direction taking away the dump off options we have on the other side of the field setting ourselves up for an incompletion or short gain by lamar running

i also feel like our receiving threats literally every eligible guy on the field it seems find their spot and just sit there mahomes looks like a god and could be i suppose because he can buy himself 35 seconds after the snap for his receivers to peel off and get open lamar buys those 35 seconds and his guys are still sitting in their same spot completely covered so he buys another 2 seconds and theyre still doing nothing and lamar is forced to run out of bounds for minimal gain

just in case this isnt a knock on mahomes i just think his receivers help him out a lot more than ours help lamar
i would bring back the read options for lamar on running plays they worked so well at icing any defender in the gap and kept pressure off the line
tldr use your wrs less and your tesrbs more use motion and spread concepts to kill doubleteams and exploit mismatches play uptempo more often and run the ball and not just up the middle

first more heavy sets weve got three good rbs two good tes and a good fb meanwhile weve got one good wr maybe two if dez is his old self boykin and duvernay are still developingand frankly duvernays development is already looking more exciting than boykins so lets swap whos 3 and 4 while were at it in spite of that were running 11 personnel1 rb 1 te 3 wr for 49 of our plays to be fair thats the nfls favorite formation for a reason its a versatile set that lets you get two potential matchup mismatches onto the field and be viable running or passing were also running it much less than most of the league which averages 60

the thing though is that our wrs are mostly pretty bad and if your wr3 isnt very good then thats one largelywasted option if your wr2 isnt that good either there are basically only three weapons the defense has to worry about wr1 rb and te rather than trying to do what were supposed to do and put 3 wrs on the field even when we know that 12 of those wrs are just spectators i want to see us take advantage of the receiving talent we have at the nontraditional receiver positions

dobbins isnt to the point of a guy like kamara or bell but its clear hes got hands so does ingram andrews was moved all around the field at oklahoma and played tight and wide boyle may be a blocker but his hands arent bad and while hes not the same level of receiving fb juszczyk was pats capable of catching a few passes too they may not have 44 speed and theyre not going to run perfect routes that shake defenders on every cut but those guys can catch and can be put into position to make plays in space those are just the advantages in the passing game too a 22 set with dobbins gus andrews boyle and hollywood is a versatile setup that forces at least one safety to play off to respect the speed both linebackers to be alert in coverage because andrews and dobbins are both pass threats but also puts an absolute sledgehammer onto the field with gus and seven blockers since you have two tes what are the ravens going to do out of that set you dont know and more importantly neither does the defense confusion and mystery are the name of the game its why motion and playaction are things and i think more creative personnel sets would let us confuse defenses much more effectively even if its not the personnel youre supposed to run heavy sets might suggest an obvious run but we have the talent to turn it into a mystery the defense has to unravel every play instead of just a short yardage tool


second more motion and spread concepts ive loved the spread offense for years its not perfect but i think it can do a lot to really put a defense onto its heels force them to isolate receivers so hollywood and andrews can beat their matchup instead of having to fight a doubleteam and keep the defense from loading the box since they have to cover the entire field horizontally but zombiefeedback spread offenses use 45 wr sets doesnt running the spread go counter to what you just said only if youre not creative with it i think about all the different ways the chiefs move kelce and hill around how pittsburgh used to use bell carolina uses cmc how all these versatile players are used to spread a defense out and generate mismatches and then i look at the talent we have at rb and te and i think you can use those guys in more roles than theyre being used in

lets go back to that theoretical 22 look from before with andrews boyle dobbins gus and hollywood looking at the huddle the defense will probably give you a base look either 34 or 43 in either case youve already got one matchup you can exploit by putting andrews out wide and letting a 65 target bully a position whose average height is 511 from there you can motion dobbins out into the slot again hes not alvin kamara but hes got solid hands and a good vision for reading zones and just like andrews gives you a great mismatch against smaller corners dobbins gives you a great mismatch with a fast shifty rb against bigger slower linebackers now youve taken a look that originally suggests run against a defensive personnel designed to deal with a run and turned it into a spreadout threewide look that makes it hard for them to organize a doubleteam on the fly against your best weapons and gives you two great mismatches three good receivers forcing the defense to cover all 160 feet eastandwest a deep burner keeping at least one safety out of the box and you can still run it down their throat with a physical runner like gus and a very good blocking te in boyle who can also catch if you want to try and add another option to give the defense trouble thats all assuming that the defense has solid communication and everyone gets to their assignment too and causing those miscommunications is the whole point of all that motion in the first place

this is just one example and obviously you wouldnt do this on every single play but if you combine it with the motion greg loves using to take a bunchedup look and turn it into a spread look or start with a spread and then force those dbs to try and come inside to stop the gus bus running inside with seven blockers you can generate mismatches all across the field whether you want to pass against their big run stoppers run against their tiny passing units throw jump balls on a short guy or any other way you want to exploit your opponent doing whats traditionally the right answer

third is another spread concept i really want to see more of uptempo offense imagine being a db covering hollywood and duvernay two guys with legit 43 speed you have to sprint to keep up with the jogging speed of and having to hustle back to the line every time because theyre going to snap it as soon as theyre ready youll be winded within three plays you dont get a second to rest same for a pass rusher who has to try and chase lamar for 40 yards of backfield dancing not only are you exhausted but by keeping up the pressure and keeping up the pace its harder for a defense to slow down think and figure out what the offense is doing to it you keep them on their heels both physically and mentally it also makes it easier to get them into a rhythm you shatter either by running and then calling playaction or passing and then calling a draw you dont want to be chip kellys eagles use it constantly and have no time of possession but i think mixing tempos and having hightempo drives can put a defense onto skates

finally one i think everyone can agree on and has been preaching for weeks run the damn ball were 3 in overall yards 1 in ypc 1 in 20 runs 1 in 40 runs its not as dominant as last year because tyre is no marshal yanda nobody is but we still have arguably the best running attack in the league and yet were only 13 in rushing attempts there is no excuse not to be using a ground game this effective more its productive and it makes your passing game better

but we have to be a throwing offense to beat the chiefs in the playoffs bullshit the raiders ran 35 times for 144 yards in their win against kc and only threw 31 if you look at their other eight losses in the mahomes era heavy rushing is the trend you see in teams that beat them

2019 vs indy 45 rushes 180 yards
2019 vs houston 41 rushes 192 yards
2019 tennessee 26 rushes 225 yards
2018 pats 38 rushes 173 yards
2018 seattle 43 rushes 210 yards

the only times mahomes got straightup outdueled by the other qb were last year by aaron rodgers and 2018 in that mnf classic against the rams every single other time hes lost an nfl game it was against a team that relentlessly ran the ball down kcs throat you dont win against patrick mahomes by trying to be better at throwing the football than him because youre not nobody is you win against patrick mahomes the same way youve always won against elite quarterbacks by keeping him on the sideline

run the goddamn ball and for gods sake do more offtackle runs ronnie and obj are your best blockers on top of boyle and andrews yet we run more up the gut than anywhere else by a gigantic margin

edit punctuation is hard
id like to see more rpos that start off as our standard run first option plays with real receiving dump offs in the shortintermediate parts of the field defenses are shutting down lamars running more effectively this year by getting much more aggressive they are being coached to bail on assignments once lamar tucks the ball we can take advantage of that ive seen lamar do it a few times to the tes but we can get wrs involved on drags and corner routes as well though asking lamar to throw outside the hash to the sideline while on the run is asking him to play against his strength
i think they should try some more wide open formations i see a lot of lamar drop backs coming from those heavy multiple te sets which isnt gonna help much with creating space for guys also really need to work in some more quick passing game and rpos
tell lamar to know when hes hot and throw to the hot receiver every time hes hot it doesnt matter if he gets picked by a trap defense every time he has to be better at knowing when hes hot
they need to implement tons of rpos into the scripted gameplan make boykin and duv the option on slants hollywood on bubble screens

rpos are super effective with lamar because even when he hands the ball off the other team has to devote resources to stop him from running the quick passes will be open when lbs drop to stop the run to clarify lamar will never be running the ball on these plays read the linebackers hit the pass or hand it off

later in the game lamar can run a read option from the same formation which allows us to get those game clinching runs we had last season
edit while i fundamentally agree with all of the posts increasing the shortintermediate passing looks as defenses are stacking box and defending the deep ball adjustmentbtw this is the same problem flacco offenses had im not sure if lamar and our current receiving corps make this an efficient change essentially asking them to become dominant in all phases of offense and im concerned that we wont regularly get open if im wrong at a reliable shortmiddle passing attack becomes efficient we are basically undefendable

x200b

that said i think the easier adjustment is to improve the running game and limit defensive adjustments to our attack this goes against the top formula but the solution is to go fast break put 12 13 22 or 11 personnel on the field no subs run the super no huddle a la patschip kelly makes it harder to adjust to our formations load the box easier for us to run the ball which should force other adjustments leading to passing game openings
nothing this passing game will not improve until lamar gets better playersand i dont mean dez bryant

people jumped up and down screaming that dak prescott would never be great passer of the footballthat dak prescott is never going to be a 4k a year type passer the minute dak got one wrdak has been a 5k a year passer

people need to stop looking at lamar and co to make chicken salad out of chicken crap he needs better players period

so instead of getting get another defensive playergo figure out a way to get some wr or ol help for lamar if if if if you want a better passing game otherwise lamar and the ravens should expect to rely on the defense to compensate for the lack of weapons when this team goes up against the nfls best
run rpos reverses and play action
1 i want a rb or te as an extra blocker like every play because blitzes are killing our pass game without yanda

2 i dont really know how but id try to work with the receivers on getting open after theyve run their route lamar is pretty good at escaping the pocket and throwing on the run and i feel like our receivers dont do a great job of extending the play once its gone to shit and lamar is on the run this doesnt even just mean getting open but also trying to draw spys away so lamar can take off
more misdirection and scheming guys open the pass game is so ridiculously bland except for the quick screen to duvernay vs iggles wr corps not good enough to rely on talent
stop trying to force the deep ball if its there take it of course but i feel like they try to force the deep pass to work take what the defense gives you

i gave a couple of random crows near my house some of my clif bar a few times and now were homies

its kind of bizarre how cerebral they are with a quarter sized brain
must be nice for steelers fans to know well at least be holding a funeral for them on sunday after the game
damn wheres that guy that posted a genuine question about ravens in this sub before he found it this wasnt the place

i wonder if the ravens in his tree have forgiven him by now
might be geography too forms crabbiness i admit it
the north remembers

and dallas gets a big d look at map
uhhhhh idk jim
if romo dont put some repeskt on justin tuckers name aka legatron aka mr automagic aka the most accurate kicker in history aka mr still fucking got it

edit per request
cant wait for romo to say some shit about boswell being the best kicker god do i hope we win on a walk off 60 yarder from tucker while boswell missed an earlier xp
cbs national game the beloved steelers gag choke spit get romo and nantz ravens are just along for the ride
game of the week
i can watch from texas its a halloween miracle
i hope tucker kicks from the parking lot in pre game warm ups
i hate living in new england and never getting them on locally this should be a prime time matchup
i have to watch the chiefs play the fucking jets how is that a major televised game

great we get to hear romo gag on bens cock most of the game and throw passive agressive shade at lamar and his accomplishments for the rest of it romos great at what he does sure but so is tom brady not a big fan
they are great but for me kevin harlan is the best out there right now
honestly dont think thats that great of a lineup for us for some reason romo is always so quick to judge the ravens and everytime weve had him hes talked up the browns or chiefs

also just listening to him as hes gotten more comfortable hes more arrogant knowledgeable but kind of a douche

personally think ian eagle and charles davis are the best the bird loves us and is just a good voice for play by play
i know this wasnt the point of this post but why on earth would cleveland get chargers broncos instead of our game or even the cleveland game
serious biz
idk about yall but i love the way romos voice sounds
seems like the first time in forever that ive been able to watch a nonprimetime game in cali lets get it
why does texas have a green penis
nice
i prefer al and chris

nantz is utterly devoid of personality and romo mainly squeaks and tries to predict the play with about 40 accuracy i dont understand the hype



x200b

there is this one too
why anyone would have thrown in the middle with ray on the field boggles my mind
brought so much joy to my heart watching this
i miss those days
completely deserved it
the classic

i always thought atkins was more disruptive against us but both have slowed down quite a bit

i uh

what exactly is going on here
let me know if you have any ideas for next weeks drawing
nice drawing and i may just be slow but whats up with the steelers
nice toilet paper drawing of the steelers





also fuck the steelers
fuck the steelers
the b on the wing is such a nice touch goddamn
nice job

best of luck ravens gonna be a fun game against yall this week the first time this matchup will be good since always

we used to fucking joke about somehow getting this guy and we did

edc is god damn football warlock
hope he put ben on his back a few times this weekend
this is highly arousing
wow cant believe they gave him courtney upshaws number
shit just got real now judon can take on rts and maybe be more productive
someone get my man some drip
i hope thats a terrible towel he has in his hand so he can dry off his sweaty nuts with
dez looks different
he needs to get some new gloves still wearing his vikings ones
welcome back to md baby
i must say that uniform looks good on him
wish we had him against the chiefs
lets get it
finally wanted him here soon as he wanted out of jax shit i was hoping we could draft him
im so glad that we might be able to rush just 4 and have everybody else in coverage our defense is going to ruin teams 3
he hasnt been happy with his pt we could use some db depth hes versatile and a decent return man he is also a pending free agent i feel like it would be a sneaky good move for us with tavons injury history an jimmy moving around more
ive been wanting him on the ravens since he was at iowa our secondary would be dominant
id absolutely be down for this
not a bad idea but corner is one of our strongest position groups id rather prioritise interior oline and wr
cornerback is def a need in the future were stacked at the top but dont have a lot of depth behind our top two guys especially is averett and young cant stay healthy plus we have a lot of cap room next year but not a ton of draft picks so we could be big players in free agency that said football teams always want to get younger and cheaper
it was around this time on halloween i was celebrating my birthday and gifts were great and all but what i really wanted was us to take down the undefeated patriots kind of crazy that its the same time with a undefeated team again yall already know what my birthday wish is gonna be again
happy birthday and fuck the steelers
you will be our lucky charm fuck the steelers
i got so drunk that night celebrating my birthday and ravens victory people were buying me shots just cause we beat the pats then i got more when they realized it was my bday perks of being the only raven fan in the bar happy birthday

if dez can find a connection with lamar and be anquanesque i will nut
i think this will go down as another great move from edc dez has the talent to give us a good few years like boldin and smith sr

if hes a fifth of what boldin did ooo baby
keep going im almost there
he just has to be able to do more than boykins or snead and im pretty optimistic he can might take some time to get to that point but were a little more than two months away from needing to play our best football

side note this is really good to hear from a defensive guy especially one that covers our current wrs in practice this speaks very loudly to their abilities or lack thereof
he doesnt need to be fast he just needs to know how to high point a ball well

hope marlon is good to go for sunday

they are using him as claypool prep
hello fellow ravens fans lifelong ravens fan here looking forward to following the team the rest of the year boy that lamar is fast am i right no need to look at my past history cause i definitely am not giving up on a crappy team to follow my favorite player to a super bowl team for the rest of the year
i thought hed go with 88 but since hes practice squad could he be playing chase claypool
are you guys sure thats not kamar aiken
how long til yall think hell be on active roster
am i the only one who gets boldin vibes from seeing dez in a purple uni
did proche give up 11 for him
cowboys fan here just relivin the good old days hope to see dez playing in a game soon
cowboys fan here just relivin the good old days hope to see dez playing in a game soon
cowboys fan here just relivin the good old days hope to see dez playing in a game soon
cowboys fan here just relivin the good old days hope to see dez playing in a game soon
cowboys fan here just relivin the good old days hope to see dez playing in a game soon
just seeing him in 11 even if its just for practice makes me feel so weird lol
so can he play this weekend

i thought he had to test negative 5 days in a row and i thought that was away from team not with the team else what is the point if he can potentially infect his team if he had the virus
wheres the dez tape

yeah when we probably will when we are 141 heading into week 17

x200b

s a little

why 99 and not 96
ha 203

suck it shitsburgh
23 also the winning teams score in all ravens steelers games since the dawn of time
harbaughs got a 1311 edge on tomlin as well in their headtohead record this is going to be one of the most contested games in recent years but we have a dangerous defense adding ngakoue on the edge will be perfect for pressuring worthlessberger predicting judon and ngakoue for 5 combined sacks and queen with a strip sack
the only thing that sucks is our playoff record against them we had that one year when ravens bengals and steelers all made playoffs steelers won the division but then got immediately taken out by us in the wild cards game that felt good af who was the real kings in the north bitch
best rivalry in football no questions asked
so were clearly better fuck the steelers

oof
this is so fucked up but i just died laughing
dont laugh dont laugh dont laugh
unfortunately its the onion unfortunately
a coworker at my old job went to college at pittsburgh during big bens rapey days she and her friends ran into him at barsclubs on 2 occasions and said he was touchy and creepy he was definitely a predator
onion kinda goated for this one
i mean with the whole rapistburger deal totally date raped a chick and had his security keep the friends from stopping it this is pure gold
no offense isnt baltimore one of the rape capitals of the world
im surprised the onion took this low hanging fruit even in 2014 generally their satire hits pretty well but this is just a rape joke in different words which isnt cool even 6 years ago people who laugh are shitty
man maybe theyll have to add bal
removed

send the bear back to his cave
whos laurel is that a player on our team
oh that was harsh
what are some basic things i should know about this team thanks in advance go ravens

always remember





fuck the steelers
1 fuck the steelers

2 refer to rule 1
fuck the
fuck the steelers know that and youll be fine
just go around saying big truss and youll be good
this is a mans game we must protect this house
we are the only professional sports team named after a work of literature
go read the raven by edgar allen poe
fuck the steelers
fuck the browns
fuck the bengals

capitalized letters emphasized loathing and lower case letters emphasize apathy they can all get bucked
i know hes over 30 struggled to get separation last time he was on the field and that was when he was 23 years younger and before an achilles injury but im still hyped he has never been a burner but he doesnt need to be if you look on his ig he still is incredible at high pointing the ball even if it isnt against nfl caliber corners im hoping when he is on the field that the defense has to respect his presence which should help freeing up our other weapons hollywood andrews running game if everyone else is covered and pressure is coming lamar has someone to throw a 5050 ball which is better than taking a sack or throwing it away
to summarise im not expecting huge numbers but a safety blanket for lamar in case of emergency or red zone and someone to open up our options with our other weapons
i mean even if he was washed hes still our second or third best receiver i expect him to be on the field as soon as he gets the playbook down
he had to pass our notoriously hard conditioning test to be signed right its the same test that had him puking a couple of weeks ago

the man has been putting in the work his hands look good and like you said he should still be able to win some jump balls im not an expert by any means but i thought his recent routes on ig look more crisp than they did a month ago

i was thinking last night that we are a great team for him to be with considering our secondary that should help get him back up to nfl speed

im not expecting superstar dez but im cautiously optimistic if he stays healthy he should have a positive impact on the team
100 catches 50 touchdowns super bowl ring
we can afford to wait for him to get up to speed and his role will hopefully be that of anquan boldin that is the tough physical guy who wins 1v1 contested catches

even if dez isnt making big contributions until late in the season its all good 51 allows us some wiggle room for the offense to figure it out
hes not going to be prime dez obviously but even if hes washed hes probably our 23 best wr so he should help us a lot even if hes not that good

he passed the condition test which is supposed to be insanely tough he clearly still has hands and looks good on social media hopefully he can bring a piece we desperately need
10 catches on the season at most
im expecting him to play more of a hybrid te in romans system and help move the chains
if nothing else i hope he can motivate the rest of our receivers hollywood is great but could be a little bit more physical boykin gets open but he never seems to be on the same page as lamar maybe dez can push them to be better
i just want to see dez play against the cowboys

i hope its not bereavement related thatd be absolutely terrible lets not make conclusions and just keep him in our thoughts
what is this post

youre worried because he hasnt tweeted in the past 20 hours
usain bolt is the goat
bro its wednesday



sounds like jimmy smith was limited with an achilles tho not gonna lie that is terrifying how many times have we seen a player deal with a sore achilles that eventually turns into a tear the injuries to young and averett are even more painful when you think they make everyone else more likely to get hurt
if this is the case im thrilled lets hope its not covid and hes ready to pocket juju on sunday
glad organization is taking every precaution to not have what happen to other teams
oh no please dont be covid or anything that keeps him out
thank god if thats proven to be true
give all the dbs a break until the steeler game
mustve been that super hot chips he ate
heavy breathing intensifies


does that make snowball julia

they should replace our helmet logo with this picture collage
i joined this sub because my bf is a big ravens fan and i wanted to get to know them better this is the first post ive truely understood
marlon has more swag than anyone ive ever seen


i dig this exchange quite a bit for two reasons

dez going with the onehand is a little bit showboaty like hes saying im not washed up yet for an old man watch this shows that hes confident he can still play him kinda chuckling about getting sent back to do it again tells me his ego may have been overblown at least for now

meanwhile coach is saying i dont care what your nameplate is or that youve done x andor x in the past we are going to show an example to the young guys that this drill may seem silly to nfl level players it still works on the fundamentals the onehanded circus catch is phenomenal to watch but the safe play is twohanding it and guaranteeing completion

as a team struggling with drops in recent games i like going back to fundamentals since it obviously needs work
i mean he looks decently explosive here yeah its only a drill but damn even if hes 70 of his peak abilities thatll be a massive upgrade on boykin
this is a better angle of the catch
he looks big im excited
kamar aiken looking good
have we agreed that dez in fact caught it
not gonna rock the 88 he looks to much like aiken
kinda getting excited about this acquisition
fluffy dez
ive been saying we need some hands these are some fucking hands
im so frickin excited for sunday sunday sunday
ive seen enough call him up by next week

hes a rapist who got lucky that his accusations came up in the 2000s instead of today what he did is far more egregious than ray rice

i respect every player on the steelers more than big ben and i hope we break his nose again fuck captain fat fuck
i like it when he gets hit
hes literally a rapist if we can cancel shannon sharpe because he has ties with farrakhan then this aint it
watched him whine and complain to the refs literally 3 days ago for getting hit as he threw the ball
fuck that rapist ass hoe mike vick did what ben did he will be spending life in prison
i too hope he gets his fat ugly face smashed in
watched him whine and complain to the refs literally 3 days ago for getting hit as he threw the ball
big ben is such a flopper and a whiner idk who youve been watching i have more respect for andy dalton than big ben tbh ben is just a terrible person
a good rivalry always has great gamesplayers i think both ravens fan and steelers fans can agree that when it comes to it baddirty games are looked down on regardless of what team you root for the brownspitt game last year was awful to watch and the game pittbengals had with brown getting laid out was awful as well
thats how i felt about the bus when we had to play him
philip rivers is a budget big ben
i have never seen another qb fake as many injuries as this clown he sucks
i have never seen another qb fake as many injuries as this clown he sucks
man he whined and still does all the time plus you could argue his biggest attribute was his athleticism in the pocket he definitely is a good rival though
im so jealouse when i see qbs like him play that can carve up a defense or they have receivers to throw to who get open watching other teams around the leage and seeing wrs having separation is so strange

you dropped this king

or showing up to a press conference without his walking boot
ironically the rarest you can get a steak done is called pittsburgh
fake tough guy last i checked real men dont force themselves on women in bar mens rooms
courtney upshaw levelling ben is so sweet
big ben vs ravens d
postgame interviews be like i was playing with covid
ngata breaking his nose chefs kiss
your steak sir very rare

wow thats rare
this is an amazing fucking meme lmaoooooo
i hope he gets lit the fuck up on sunday im talking the type of shit where their lg fucks up and we get an edge rusher with a clean blindside shot i hate ben more than any player currently playing in the nfl such a shit human
he already got his walking boot out of the closet to make sure it still fits for his post game interview
medium or death
whats that very rare lol
not to mention the stat padding he does when hes facing a decent defense



yessss bruh

probably a fresh start new chapter type thing each to their own
dog
cant wait to hear him on 1057 the fan again if youre wondering what im referring to its that he hung up on vinny and hannie back in the day because he didnt like the question
minnesota and jax are basically his ex girlfriends and hes starting fresh with a badder bitch in the ravens
may be a contract thing but im totally talking out of my ass
this is home to him
he must be a real one rip nipsey
upvote this

super bowl guaranteed

does anyone know feels like a good game for a blackout
i am hoping for black on black or black on purple
there are 5 home games left so there are just enough to still wear all 10 combinations as they did in 2018 the combinations worn at home so far have been the following whitepurple blackwhite purplewhite

on the road they have gone with purplewhite whiteblack x2 the whitewhite will likely be rightfully worn on the road so that is probably a foregone conclusion as an option at some point

that would leave these uniform combos color rush blackout all black blackpurple for only the second time ever since it was inexplicably skipped in 2019 primary purpleonpurple purpleblack

i would like to see them wear the blackpurple at some point this season for sure as well as remain undefeated in color rush plus if worn i would like to see them finally win a game in the primary purplepurple look in which they are 02

i doubt it is blackout when we still have a home night game on the schedule
im purple on black money man marlo
my girlfriend is black on purple mandrews

have a great week guys i cant wait to watch this with yall


they have all trained with wr coach david robinson at some point during their careers

dez last three years and currently

hollywood past offseason

duvernay since high school

proche since high school

after looking at some dez highlights i decided to see who else his wr coach has worked with and was surprised to see it was most of our young receivers i would also like to think that when they were looking at dez and his progress they could ask any of those three guys their opinion on working with robinson or they could just like his results based on the guys they have and were more willing to give dez some time with robinson to get things figured out
the admiral
he has damn near the entire nfl listed as clients on his website
lamar throwing to them
whom else his wr coach has worked with
i dont know if thats a good thing dez has been out of league for 2 years and the other three are all rookies
anyone else not worried about lamar seems like most people are freaking out and i remember lamar not being mvp before the bye last season and he ran away with it after the break what ive watched seems like theyre working on the playbook like its the preseason but i havent seen any opinions that line up with mine im wondering if im blinded by the purple glasses or if i have anyone on my mindset
i havent been too impressed with the offense this year however none of the offensive players seem concerned in interviews its like they know something we dont gotta have some big truss
i agree with the idea that we might have been working on the playbook seeing what areas we shouldshouldnt expand upon it felt like we saw a few more of last seasons plays in the eagles game the bye came at a good time to reevaluate i have a feeling our oline play will get a little better than its been but thats gonna be tough this week
i havent really been worried about lamar all year he hasnt really played badly and his accuracy looks ok hes just made some dumb throws and sometimes forced the ball deep im more worried about oline play and wrs oline has looked shaky all year and wrs have struggled to separate hopefully the bye gave them the opportunity to fix things a bit
i am in the same boat as you

there is a lot of room for improvement and were 51 sounds good to me if it felt like we hit a ceiling and were struggling to win games i would be worried

unlike most im pretty optimistic i am confident in our coaches and most importantly i am confident in our players

also truzz enough said
i have big truss that they are holding back on purpose to avoid teams figuring out this years plan it just makes sense because the goal is super bowl and everyone knows it we had the 142 season they wanna build up to it and not fizzle out or be figured out by the time we get there we didnt lose any players or coaches apart from yanda they are working on new wrinkles which obviously arent 100 effective right now so that we arent a one trick pony by the time we are facing good opposition in the playoffs which we all asked for
the steelers
rdontputyourdickinthat
mods can we get this pinned this is pretty big news
fuck those buck tooth fat ass shit towel waving 400 lb weighing womens bathroom stalking motherfuckers

his knee was still an issue he went on ir early in camp most likely he couldnt rehab with everything going on
went on ir maybe he flashes next year and sticks around

other teams are playing checkers lamars playing chess
the topright picture is uncanny
i definitely see it
i dont think hell make it as an actor maybe he should try playing wide receiver
walamar
quick do a comparison like the troy aikmanjay z photo
til lamar jackson looks like a young willem dafoe
i cant unsee it
lamar michael jackson
i love chess and love the ravens ill be checking this show out thanks
its the eyes
ive never been so entertained by a show about something i dont really care about

it was excellent i urge everyone to watch it
isit a good show
i thought the same thing when i watched it hahaha

its the eyes
weird
his eyes arent quite far enough apart he needs about another foot and a half
so i tend to be a bit of a pessimist when it comes to big games if this was last year i wouldnt think twice about the outcome but the steelers dont look completely terrible this year does anybody have any stats or insights on the game to help me go in to the weekend without any doubts at all as to why were totally going to win and of course as usual its still fuck the steelers no matter what
always remember that in 2015 we went 511 with our 3rd string qb in and we beat the steelers twice that year no matter how bad weve looked its always a different game against the steelers
stats dont mean shit in any game but this one in particular lamar has to play better than he has recently for us to win also we need to press their receivers because theyre basically running a 3 step drop west coast style offense
like my son said about the steelerstitans game they didnt win they escaped

steelers are a good team but i see us squeaking one out
i dont have much to add but definitely feeling the nerves for this one im not a football expert but this year has just felt different from last they seem like theyre taking this year to figure it all out and havent really found their stride play seems inconsistent at best that being said im really excited to see the new d lineup we have this weekend with ngakoue and lamar is always a pleasure to watch i also havent watched a steelers game havent felt like vomiting lately so i dont know how they have been doing besides their 60 record
look at our defense

just look at it

on average we give up 173 pointsgame the best insight i can give you is we have 44 and they do not
i was watching espn yesterday and saw a stat that said lamar is undefeated 30 vs number 1 defenses

edit posted this if you wanna check it out
you only need to know 1 thing

we have lamar jackson they dont

only thing that matters
great point as well so much of the ravens hate is centered on not throwing up 45 points on every other team we play
having doubts about this game would be totally reasonable the steelers are really good this year and we havent been very good

jonnu was always gonna be good once he became the starter delanie was just always in the way dude is a freak athlete at te and makes a ton of contested catches
my te could beat up your te
i have both of them on my fantasy this year
seems like vegas is trying to bait people into taking the steelers so i will load up on the ravens still dont like laying 35 though
vegas is responsive they want an even number of people on both sides so that just means that thats where their data tells them theyd get an even split
home field advantage even though thats not as impactful this year
vegas gives three points to the away team so on a neutral site they are saying the line is actually ravens 5 the fact that the ravens have only lost to the defending super bowl champions and the steelers have had a relatively easy schedule adding to the fact that our second stringers beat them in a meaningless game to us and a must win game for them last year is why they lean very slightly to us

the fact that its the best rivalry in the nfl and one of the best in american sports in general is why its so close to just being even when you account for the 3 points for home field advantage

its going to be an amazing game and im really excited to see what happens but a 35 line favoring the home team is basically vegas saying its a push match up
honestly the line for this game has been insane at the beginning of the week it was minus six for the ravens ngl i almost hammered pitt 35 is still too much for me here
i took pittsburgh 55 when lines opened way too high of a line
im emotionally hedging this game will lay 50 on the steelers ml feels dirty and i hope we crush them however if we do lose the game atleast i will have something to be happy about
i think the steelers should be favored because theyre undefeated and we looked like ass against the eagles but i think well win harbuagh is very good at getting the team ready after bye weeks
im trying to figure out how the spread is the same against the steelers as it is against the colts in a couple of weeks home field advantage isnt a legitimate argument this year imo

that was a huge day for us coming off 2 straight losses and a bye billick fired fossil and took over play calling got back to basics also someone absolutely speared reggie bush i forget who this is off memory so i could be wrong
wait why is jamal lewis not featured in the clip at all haha
i cannot believe this season was 14 years ago my god im so old
give jamal the ball
clarence moore synonymous with demetrius williams
dawan landry got a pick six if i recall correctly
great moment great game

as a cowboys fan i really hope he succeeds always loved dez
i think hell be on the field by then remember he tried out in august and we sent him home told him to get himself in shape and come back when hes ready he was self motivated enough to pass the conditioning test this week so hes been working his ass off already hopefully just a matter of developing chemistry with lamar and getting the playbook down i have really high hopes for him we need a big body vet who knows how to do the simple shit like sit in a zone or go up and make a contested catch
i think week 10 is a good target thats what ive been using as a guage unless there is another trade or an injury i understand hes been working all year on his own but solo workouts are different on the body than in pad practice or in game scenarios
i have to say he looks big out there like how andy reid looked in that punt pass competition like how julio metcalf mike evans look on the field im excited
i think ufilmstudy has a more realistic prediction which is a 50 chance he sees the field for the ravens at all

i think i fall somewhere between that prediction and this one but if he makes a contribution well have to wait a bit
man hasnt played since 2017 and is 31 years old now

up to speed probably makes him our 4th target at best its a low risk lightning in a bottle type move but its super doubtful he does much of anything
why is he wearing an 11 i thought we already had an 11
nbc would love him to be there by week 10 too i think he will be there for week 13 against the cowboys would like to see what he would do against his old team that is a dumpster fire right now

but realistically i think it will come down to how he looks and if he is better than other wrs maybe this gives boykin more motivation and he starts playing better but i think the ravens are really looking long term for this so they arent going to rush it
i think the boys should go after mclaurin
i think week 10 is a realistic target hasnt played in a couple of years which means hes rusty but also has low mileage really would love to see him succeed
ill say hes on the active roster next week with no snaps emergency and a few goal line plays for jump ball opportunities in week 10 full speed by week 13
we literally just need a big rz target aside from mandrews he doesnt have to be blazing fast for that he just has to have hands and i dont think he jppd himself
to me this means boykin is on a short leash if boykin starts messing up again or continues to mess up dez will probably take his spot
i say over hes been out of football for a few years but he will be on the field before the end november and make an impact in the postseason
honestly dez bryant at 50 is better than any receiver on this roster so

people forget we signed him to the practice squad this is a great move with nothing but tremendous upside i dont think hes going to be a dominant player but we need a big receiver like him that can go up and catch balls so we will see
i say week 12 is more realistic

pats niners steelers
i think what happened was every time we faced the number one defense we put up enough stats to knock them off number 1
i think its true by the time we faced the pats last year they were 1 same with the steelers and bills
what is number one defense based on points yards not really a good stat id look at the football outsiders or pff
i think what happened was last year every time we faced the number one defense we put up enough stats to knock them off number 1

yellow sus
crewmate speed 100
thats dope im gonna steal it


lmfaoo i can tell hes getting tired of the comparisons
naw i dont lmao
no matter how things turn out at the end of this season or 5 years from now im gonna be a lamar fan


they will not 50 signed jerseys for the whole sub if they do
feels like ingram is a negative asset hes lost a ton of explosion from last year and is injured and over 30 i know his contract is done after this year but i doubt anyone would want to take on the remaining money unless they were given a pick
no this isnt madden

yawn
only 40
he could have gotten injured on that celebration or with the holder ruining his practice swing

in january 2015 i was visiting my then girlfriend and her family in maryland usa at this point in my life i had no interest in the nfl as it wasnt really popular or on the rise in the uk or at least where i lived in the uk

however it was playoff time and her family had other ideas they bought me a ravens beanie and flacco jersey and as i sat down with them to watch the game they had told me about how fierce the ravens rivalry was with the steelers but i had no idea just how fierce they meant

i remember the game like it was yesterday the field goal in the opening qtr for pitts to take the lead then pierces rushing td for us the exchange of fgs up until big dick joes pass to torrey to put us up 209

then the absolute disbelief at seeing forsett fumble which lead to a steelers score and the elation watching t sizzle intercept that pass from ben and the resulting td from gillmore finally another pick from our defence and my utter confusion when the family was explaining what a safety was and how at this point in the game it didnt matter

whats also funny looking back was the idea that i assumed all kickers were as good as tucker and i was genuinely shocked when they would miss pats and fgs

since that day a lot has changed in my life myself and my then girlfriend didnt work out i met a beautiful aussie shelia and settled in down under but what has always remained since that playoff game and if anything good ever came from that relationship it was my new found love for the nfl and the baltimore ravens

you best believe im up at some ridiculous hour just to see my ravens play ill always remember that first game i watched and how every moment stuck with me from watching joe pick apart the steelers formidable defence to the father of the family screaming how does that turf tatse ben every time we got a qb hit or sack and although this season has not been as electric as last season i think many overlook the fact last year was a record breaking season my uk football team is terrible so i am grateful i have a great nfl team to enjoy at the moment

i say all of that to ultimately state

fuck the steelers
dude your story is kinda like mine well except im from the netherlands and it happened 5 years earlier

got into the ravens because of a girl who lived in baltimore shes married with kids now and i wish her all the best no hard feelings at all but my love for the ravens was cemented then
marylander living in sydney here found a ravens jersey in rebel sport yesterday couldnt believe it glad to know theres at least one other ravens fan here
ravens fan from melbourne here i actually feel like we have a good supporter bae in australia its weird
truzz
how are those 5am game starts working out for you
theres a crew of ravens fans here in auckland new zealand too good yarn mate enjoyed it lesssgooo
oh man that playoff game was the culmination of playoff futility vs the steelers 2001 2008 2010 the 2010 one stings bad find that houshmanzadeh drop on 4th down brutal were all playoff loses to pitt

2014 season exorcized that demon what a great game
arnie

yea i laugh every time i see a pundit write an article about this just look at the amount of rb injuries this year to teams like the giants 49ers seahawks not to mention ingram our depth at rb is looking pretty smart right about now maybe i could see us dealing hill but thats about it

i would not consider it a bad thing to never play for the browns again seems like everything is looking up for him now that he has experienced an unfortunate injury
sounds like a good thin for him
odell in the dumps now
with his contract i would be open to the trade heavily dependent on what the price is of course i wouldnt give up a draft pick lower than a 3rd

but odell has talent acl injuries are not career ending hes still only 27 years old mainly his contract is team friendly his cap hit is 15mill which is below market value for a pro bowl caliber wr and there would be no guaranteed money if he doesnt return to form he could be cut with no dead money to me that would be worth the risk if you believe he can still be a top tier wr

21 will not be feasting today or next week unfortunately

this is why we drafted dobbins lets hope he steps up
time for jk to step up like we all know hes capable of
ba god is that jks music
the ravens are without rb mark ingram today and they may be without him next week vs the colts as well source said its more of a highankle sprain than a lowankle sprain and those often cause multiweek absences
remember when every yahoo on this sub wanted to flip gus for a conditional 6th
its weird but this news makes me just shrug this offense has not lived and died through mark ingram and i expect we will see very little drop off without him thats not a knock on mark but gus and dobbins are more than capable of providing marks 375 yard and 3 tds per game


who knows maybe this is a breakout game for either player and they just needed an opportunity to actually add some juice to the run game crazier things have happened
terrible to say it but this could be pretty good since ingram was struggling especially in exploding through the hole while jk looked far more explosive and gus looked damn good too
gus edwards absolutely wrecked the steelers in wk 17 last year
feeing good about gus bus and jk pounding the rock gus in particular has had a solid season so far
jk all day
dynamic duo

jk gus time
justice hill
i have a bad feeling about this i hope roman does not abandon the run again

not believable arm not fat enough for a steelers fan
this is great i need to remember this for next year
that arm looks so realistic
what am i looking at is that a fake arm do you ever give yourself a stranger with it i know you have before dont lie

oh youre the cool lady excuse me sorry
when are you guys ever going to learn
another victim of disrespecting the towel
just sayingmight want to burn this post with fire nothing good comes out of disrespecting the towel

surprised ward is a healthy inactive i guess someone has to take the fall for yannick
with ingram out hopefully this will be jk dobbins time to shine
surprised about ward being a healthy scratch guess they want fergy to get more developreps
seems less than ideal to have both ellis and washington inactive only leaves four dl active on a sloppy rainy day
whats this achilles issue hadnt heard of this
hill should be inactive not ward hill is trash better to risk it with two backs and have ward

looks like a wet start then clearing up after 2 ground and pound baby
kinda reminding me of the 49ers game last year tbh
i want to see fat fuck on the ground at least 20 times today
im so excited i cant wait
if youre at the game bring it bring that noise you gotta make up for a lot of people
bens the kind of guy to set off the lunk alarm at planet fitness
what colour we wearing didnt see an announcement this week
looks like no black out today boys purple on white
duv in for boykin is that true

source
whered you find this out
a source would be much appreciated lol
oh shit
its about time boykin should not be on this roster next year
wow
good i have been saying duv needs to get more work hes been effective in limited touches so far
good thing boykin has struggled a lot duvernay had lots of good flashes not ready to completely give up on boykin though if he improves communication with lamar
holy shit finally fuck
duvernay is my favorite raven loved him at texas
about time
couldnt find a source for this anywhere
source
this thread wont age well
big if true is this true
searched all over twitter and google couldnt find a single source that agrees with you while i hope it to be true i seriously doubt it
i got my sources yall enjoy the game

step qb wyd
dang i forgot about yannick for a second
judon about to give him that body built by taco bell

two burritos one ben

quoth the raven fuck the steelers
this is random but jimmy smith deserves ring of honor eventually
someone send 40 lbs of crabcakes to yandas house
man these 4 yard punches are great please dont get away from them
the greg roman school for players who can run good and want to do other stuff good too
i like to imagine the hood shit that mp was saying when he was fighting for that ball in that pile
if tucker goes down as the best kicker ever in history and gets into the hof do you think the ravens will build a statue outside the bank of him
lmao lamar fucking killed this game 3 fumbles 1 lost 2 ints just shit performance

like last year hes kept the steelers in the game
so a bit of hand fighting is pi but that car crash isnt
mad respect to the fan in the stands wearing the elite joe tshirt
then not showing that pi again says it all dog shit call
bengals fan the ravens shouldve gotten time added
bro these force fumbles are ridiculous i have never seen a team so gungho for forcing fumbles especially in the secondary
fuck young sheldon
i really wanna see a yannik sack before the day is done
we should be up 170 but lamar needed to gift 14 points to the steelers to maintain the integrity of this rivalry
refs gave them half that drive
and then the nfl tommorow will say oops our bad we should have put time back on the clock oopsies
can i get a fuck the steelers
i hate the steelers as much as the next guy but that wasnt a dirty play
ben is playing just as bad as lamar yall need to stfu
christ lamar had ice in his veins on that last sequence had to sprint to the line throw an extra ball out of bounds wtf and then spike it there are only a few qbs in the league who wouldve managed that
every pass we defend is pi but thats legal in the endzone fuck that
man im deflated after that injury fucking fuck
so were just gonna abandon the passing game now

s
can someone make a petition to get the refs fired for being bad
why cant they show us the fucking pi replay
signing dez scared the shit out of boykin
horrible play by lamar you gotta get rid of it i saw that fumble coming a mile away
beating the shit out of the patriots on national television is going to be fun
i honestly wouldnt mind losing if it wasnt handed over by the refs
i mean im no tj watt fan but it wasnt like that was intentional just fucking sucks man stanley is a huge part of this team
maybe judon was on to something when he tried to punch that ref
anyone else feeling fired up
lamar gotta stop playing so cocky and stupid
steelers are lucky to be down 10 right now
i love the game plan today

weve all been hard on roman but big credit to him
you cant win a game not passing at all the wildcat is not a legitimate offense style lamar needs to be able to throw the team needs to be able to pass

this team is not going to be a real threat unless lamar gets it together
the penalty differential in this game is criminal
if steelers win game ball needs to go to the refs that entire drive was carried on the back of weak ass calls
as a european those political commercials are so fucking stupid
can anyone explain why there aint no more time added
ravens lost by four points after giving up four turnovers and dealing with refs that clearly favored the steelers lamar gotta play better idk if its greg roman not scheming better pass plays or what but this is disappointing
i can stomach no flag on that play if the same officials dont throw 70 yards in flags for questionable at best penalties on baltimore
can we stop acting like tj watt deliberately injured ron lol
lets not forget that our defense just blanked the steelers in the first half
yall i cant even lie theres been times where our rush makes me giggle like a kid on christmas cause its so good today
man what a huge impact discussing those 5 yards had
tony romo mentions how we abandoned the first down run


how is it that everybody sees it except for our offensive coordinator


the only guy that matters to see it
i really really really want lamar to prove everyone here wrong right fucking now
someone needs to explain to me how we cant scheme hollywood open once a game with 42 speed
good ole fashioned ref ball expect nothing less from the steelers
steelers have gotten 110 yards from penalties and lead by 4 points the biggest threat to our team is our team
the socialists

bruh i wish
fuck these refs man they dont deserve their jobs fuck them
you gonna blame the refs for that fumble shitsburgh
anyone else notice how even during the sack there were no purple jerseys diving at linemen legs
he fumbled the ball to get some extra yards come on now big brain
i wonder how many wins have been decided by justin tucker
this game really shouldnt even be close were dominating just have to protect the ball should be up 240 if not for the picksix fumble inside the 10
this team needs to stay with their running roots theyre not a passing team they are a run heavy team
lamar just tries to do way too much on every play a first down incompletion is fine
these pi calls are turn off the tv level
i am so fucking angry at this team right now

up 177 and now we are blowing it
if we had even average qb play this game is 283
110 yards in penalties after a bye week just unreal
we have had some bad plays that definitely deserved penalties but when they dont show replays of shit like pi i get fucking suspicious
being beaten by a team is one thing being picked on by the guys who are supposed to be judicators of the game is just not ok
so its cool for tomlin to not wear his face mask
why the hell didnt they put time back on the clock
refs screwed us by not putting time on the clock
how does no time get added back holy fuck
seriously when are coaches and players going to start publicly questioning the legitimacy of the game this officiating is shit
what an absolute bullshit way to end a dirty and bullshit refd game fuck the steelers
tj is such a bitch he did it last year vs rg3 and hes hitting lamar when he clearly doesnt have it this year
man when lamar is on point with his throws its a beautiful thing
how about calling our secondary the strip club
people saying lamar is holding the ball to long not seeing that out wrs arent getting separation or that his oline is absolutely atrocious this season and he constantly has to reposition we needed wrs but now with all our line hurt we cant address it again
jj watts little brother is a biiiiiiitch
free judon
imagine thinking anyone other than tucker is the best kicker in the league
averaging close to seven yards per runlets keep passing

fuck my life
roethlisberger is playing 2015 flacco style just chucking it and letting the refs win the game for him
why the fuck are we throwing passes to ricard lmao
peters getting back at the refs for that bad call lol

try calling a penalty on this shit
sam koch would never
why couldnt you play one more year marshal
how they gonna advertise chik fil a on a sunday
jk dobbins has looked fantastic this half

super encouraging
jk dobbins had 69 rushing yards in the first half
i think having ingram out shows how underutilized dobbins is
if not for the pick six it would be 170 right now defense is playing lights out and the run game is on fire cant let up on the gas
time of possession 2009951
how the fuck do you stretch out a fucking kidney transplant into a 20 episode show so fucking dumb
lamars mistakes 14 baltimore ravens 17
lamars been having alot of off games this season been frustrating to watch
2 picks 2 fumbles and an almost pick in a little over half damn wtf
fuuuuuck this ad normal my fucking ass
greg roman should be fired he did the same shit before he got here run game is great but cant draw up pass plays im tired of his shit
remember when steelers fans were bitching about the refs
the last two touchdowns were bullshit dpi calls
wonder if the steeler fans are still complaining about that one call in the first quarter
im gonna have a nervous breakdown
isnt that a personal foul
that doesnt make any sense by this logic the defense can just fake an injury after every play the clock still runs out and they get a rest
and also why tf did they not add time

peters watching some marlon tape
1 where was the blocking

2 why would we pass when we were shredding them with the running game

3 throw it away
you had like 3 or 4 yards in front of you why throw it
jackson needs to cut the fucking shit with the turnovers
jk dobbins was running well why didnt you just give him the ball to finish it
its still so weird to watch our corners actually be able to tackle in the open field im not used to this
lamars pocket awareness the last 3 games has been absolute dogshit
were you guys not here during the flacco years

time to run the fucking ball and play def its not over
id like to give a quick shout out to the mods for stomping out these brigading rednecks from hicksburgh swiftly
i know it should make me mad but whenever jackson fucks up and he pops up with that smile

that god damn smile
fuck all the steelers fans in this thread
well its nice to see cincinnati doing us a favor by taking out the tennessee trash
i feel like tony romo would be a good friend
edc looks like a genius for picking jk
ngokue is noticed hard nearly every bad roethlisberger pass has been related to pressure brought by him
ben with a whopping 24 passing yards
steelers fans were so cocky and hyping up their defense after beating on bad teams excluding the titans which they almost choked nearly 200 rushing yards allowed at the half lol
do yall really think this is a bad game

its a ravens steelers game and on defense were dominating and on offense were winning more battles than not keep this up and were golden
lamars getting blame of the game if we lose this 100
if not for lamar fucking up they have 0 fucking points and its a blowout
one vantage point is that lamar is saving us tons of future cap space hes not getting a mahomes deal with shit like this
seriously without the 2 int and the fumble were up by 24 the discipline issues from before the bye week are still there
i think this just proves that lamar still needs full preseason camp activities not having full offseason practice and time with receivers has set him back
we about to game plan this to a loss
once again our defense is getting worn out because our offense is fucking stagnant
bullying us now if we fall behind we arent clawing back
now roman is going to predictably abandon the run because were down 4 points
lamar is being exceptionally careless with the ball today
what the fuck why dont you call the steelers fucking penalties holy shit the refs should get fired
refs drove the ball for them
false start not called
ref ball for literally 5 minutes bruh judon an idiot for hitting a ref now theyre getting us back
all comes down to the 4th down now jesus
we are not a contender lamar and roman have regressed hard
2 interceptions 2 fumbles 9 penalties for 110 yards 23 injuries 1 season ending 1 player ejected for punching a referee

fucking incredible
after a whole day of weak as fuck pi we cant get shit
blow them tf out on thanksgiving please
hold up ben only got 24 yards in the first half i better here about this all week just like they do lamar
watt is just straight rushing lamar every play
love the ravens eating up clock wanna see the steelers d gassed in the 4th qtr
i love how a steelers player just runs straight at lamar every play no matter what
put boyle in and tell him the chip block the shit out of tj punk ass
lamars gotta know to not hold it for that long especially not right at the los
lamar cant hold the ball that long
by the way guys you cant run the ball every down

quit blaming the play calls that aint it
pick six fumble in the redzone lose one of our most important players for the season just fuck it all up
lamar is holding the ball too long he needs to get the ball out quick especially with the line is shambles hes not gonna have the time to wait for something perfect to open up
their offense hasnt done shit this is very winnable
that looked like the prime 2019 offense
longest half ever holy shit
say what you want about lamar but hes tough as nails
snead out there like who the fuck is dez bryant
the refs calling forward progress there is some bullshit
i heard a lot of people talking shit about obj orlando and i just cant take it he is solid af and we are lucky to have him

edit this shit talk was a result of me saying obj could definitely hold it down at lt if he needed to and he looks the part
attn can we take a second to slow clap the oline for staying strong next man up
we played like shit against the eagles in the second half

this game is far from over
i really think this defense can be historic
lets not act like the game is over we need to close dont take your foot off their neck until the 4th quarter is done
lets not get comfortable the steelers are incredibly well run theyll make it tough for us to continue how we did first half
bowser judon
cant say that i notice a difference with judon gone

blame of the game is so easily lamar doesnt matter how bad the play calling is you still dont just throw it into defenders lol
lamar you got this
judging from a lot of these comments a lot of people mustve forgot how ravenssteelers games usually go
lamar pff grade going to be a 00 for this game
harbs needs to go upstairs and smack the shit out of roman
just a disgraceful offensive performance yet again

imagine thinking brown boykin and snead will take you to the promised land in this league
yeah that is clearly opi on claypool
claypool acting like he didnt get bailed out by like 3 bs calls
must be nice only having to go 30 yards a drive to score
11030 penalty yards

what a fucking joke
7 straight run plays and look at the good its done us
ofc the refs fucked us again
no clue on how they just allowed it to be 8 seconds
starting to wish judon actually hit that ref
well fuck is that lamars first pick6
worst throw ive seen him make i think
i swear we absolutely waste a play on every set of downs
boykin looking like a man today
refs call a bullshit foul

peters aight i see you ill let em catch it
keep feeding the bus
now all we gotta do is run the ball dont risk with an int eat from the clock and run for a td lets go and fuck the steelers
keep running the ball watt is spying lamar only hand it off to gusdobbins for easy 5 yrdscarry
i got hate for saying tj is a dirty player watch him on literally every rush get a late hit on lamar
hyped we got the ball but that pi call on peters was just about the worst fucking thing ive ever seen
lamar needs to stop playing hero ball sometimes
well boys we could go on to blow out the steelers and this would still be a very bad day for our football team sad to see it
getting brigaded
this thread is moving so fast that no one will know that im saying fuck the steelers
dumbass judon
oh well more snaps for yannick and bowser
judon leaves the field and we get our first sack oh the irony
i think the whole mutual respect thing is out the window right now both teams just want to kill each other and its the way it should be
being frustrated at their offense

steelers ravens
why the fuck didnt they stop the clock fucking bs
the dolphins are beating the rams 287 with under 60 yards of offense wow
karma for that weak dpi call on peters in the first
that turnover was basically a fuck you to our defense
170 if lamar doesnt make bonehead plays
only ravens mistakes are keeping the steelers in this game
lamar better show the fuck up hes been trash this game and people saying otherwise on this thread need to face the facts
only difference between lamars performance in this game versus the bengals game is the steelers are catching these ints
right tackle is a full two yards off the line receivers never getting set we got called for both of those earlier when it wasnt nearly as bad
sack that rapist
justice hill is in and we do a qb dive on 3rd and 8 we have lost all confidence smdh
guys its okay to be critical of lamar we dont have to go through mental gymnastics to just say hes been bad today
weve just seen in the past 3 minutes

a lamar rush td
a hollywood lamar pass td
another hollywood lamar pass td
our offensive line

lt orlando brown filling in for injured ronnie stanley

lg bradley bozeman 3rd year 6th round pick

c matt skura 5th year udfa coming off a acl mcl plc and dislocated knee injury

rg patrick mekari 2nd year udfa filling in for injured tyre philips

rt dj fluker 29 year old rt filling in for orlando brown
they arent even showing us a replay it was def bs
literally a free td on a silver platter from the refs i cant even believe it
these ficking ticky tacky penalties are so fucking stupid
nice job showing the pi cbs
the flags have been very ticky tacky and theyre throwing every flag on us if lamar wins this despite the turnovers hell have a lot of respect mahomes has won games like this numerous times its time we see lj do it too
lol too weak to rebuild our nation that we broke
this game has been called so shit its not even close to funny
its almost like were good at rushing or something
lamar goes right he has a td
theyve got to charge the steelers a timeout for that
shluld be a forced timeout at the end of last play
they have to either give us 5 yards or give us a timeout for the injury
how did we not get more time thats bullshit
calls for pi for them all fucking game
that was a clear foul
fitzpatrick made contact before the ball was even there
with lamar off his game a number of o line injuries rainy day not the outcome any of us wanted but appreciated the hustle in the last 5 move on learn and bring better energy and healthy players to playoffs
judon has more hits on an official than opposing qbs lmaooo
fuck tj watts bum ass
someone in the sub said duv is starting if so lettsss fuckingg gooooooo
this game will decide my feelings for the rest of today and beyond a little
miss yanda
mikes boykin said fuck this subreddit
great job by lamar and boykin on the td
peters with the redemption
welp here i go being a sledgehammer again

gus edwards
steelers have a good plan sending watt every single time the traditional run game has to feast on his lack of contain
saw that cominglamar tuck it and run baby
lamar needs to get out of his own head and just do what he do
dobbins runs for 30next play lets pass
horrible injury after a massive extension seems a very ravens thing fuck
any chance edc can swing a 5th for a top 3 lt
lets win it for stanley please
lamar is so indecisive this season looks like a rookie
if lamar thinks hes gonna have more than 3 seconds to throw especially without stanley were fucked
pitts offense looks weak as fuck
that drive on this defense was absolutely legendary
this game is for stanley
as i have said for far too many years every time roethlisberger is sacked an angel gets her wings
lamar playing 4d chess with the fumble for the extra yardage
ankle for ronniebetter than knee
takeaways at the half

theyre lucky theyre not losing by more points

ben hasnt thrown marlons way at all

this ol combo is great at setting up the run i like that a whole lot especially thinking about the future

a classic afc north turnover showdown
tucker is the greatest nfl player of all time when rated by how good they are at their job
imagine if that pick6 didnt happen and we were up 170
we are playing an undefeated team lamar has looked shaky but i have to remind you lamar always tightens that shit up in the second half we are only screwed when his mistakes get us behind
defense nice and rested
not ravens related but im so glad tua is balling

i was hyped for him for the past 2 years and with the pressure of burrow and herbert in glad hes playing well too

disappointed that all three of those are in the afc though
ben going full flacco and heaving the ball downfield hoping for flags
what the fuck is wrong with lamar
such bad throws so fucking bad lamar is embarrassing himself today 14 points currently in effect due to lamars turnover lets see if our defense can keep it from being 21
why the fuck did we not run the ball im legit pissed
also important to acknowledge all these lamar turnovers are happening in either our 20 or their 20 hes absolutely killing us today
lamar either makes great plays or questionable plays
were getting a touchdown rn
i feel like weve somehow regressed back to the flacco years and not the good ones
which pedestrian steelers lb is gonna get a pick next drive
were down because of lamar
i need a lamar response drive or ima be irrationally angry at him the rest of the day
it aint over yet chin up and caw caw
romo is being annoying asf today usually i love him but my god
fire greg roman
there are so many times this season where ive seen refs destroy the raven momentum with bad calls forget the ravens steelers rivalry its ravens refs
how hard is it to call it a td and just review it
yay thanks refs for fucking us again and again 0 oline holds on pits right fuck this league
claypool wouldnt last a minute with the baltimore fans hes trash talking lmao
quick start saying the ravens are done they are good when we say theyre done
nothing else to say about that drive other than the refs should be ashamed such stupid calls moved the ball for them
pathetic 100 yards again of penalties more shit offense more shit defense at crucial times fuck me
what a bunch of bullshit calls holy crap theyre not allowed to play any defense steelers throw it deep if no catch then pass interference
that drive sponsored by refs

refs you cant get the rub of the green with them if youre the baltimore ravens
cant wait to score so steelers can come out and launch a 95 yard pass and get a flag to win
im loving dobbins
dobbins is a beast
why the fuck would we kick a fg were down 4
lamar shoulda bounced it outside ahhhh
4th and game
fucking heart attack time
with all the shit happened this game im proud of our boys against a great team
no matter what happens defense balled out today not one ounce a blame to them
they better fucking put time back
if they didnt give the time back they should have given 5 more yards for being offside
where is the time
trash refs i know ravens effed up but that legit cost us another chance
if i hated the steelers now even more
fun ref ball
tough when you had to play the steelers and the stealers in one game
just fake an injury if you want with 20 seconds left you dont have to worry about the zebras giving time back to the ravens
fuck off with these trump ads
we arent going to let you run a play because of the injury but you also get no more time

bs
no time added to the clock and an uncalled dpi in the end zone perfect ending to such a shit game
lamar gifting them 14 points smh worst game of his career imo
bro every fucking week they have bill cowher sucking off some steeler in an interview
boykin took coaches words to heart
tied the game back up good shit not losing our heads
come on defense get an even better pick six
steelers fans crying about the refs in rnfl lol
lmao rnfl is saltyyyyy
ah just like every other ravenssteelers game we both beat tf out of each other and go from dammit to yeah boi every 3 seconds
peters luring them into a false sense of security with that penalty so he could get the fumble
thats instant redemption from peters lol
peters said fine ill just let him catch it then
lamar throwing a pick 6 is like the lead singer throwing up before actually going on stage and performing a huge gig lmao
juiceman has officially graduated from the marlon humphrey school of forcing fumbles
dobbins will finish the drive
after seeing pit fans complaining about the refs i sincerely hope we put 60 on em man
tony romo ravens need to get 4 yards on first downs today

ravens get 4 yards on every first down
steelers are hitting lamar after every play even obvious runs theres gonna be a fight ill be disappointed if we dont start one theyre dirty and we need to send a message
held onto it too long honestly
lamar wtf cant do that shit in the fucking red zone
really gonna be one of those games
jackson seems too zoned in to prove he can pass the ball run that down the middle and hes in gotta look to the coaches on this theyre holding him back
delay of game at least 3rd uncalled penalty on the steelers
defense is bailing the offense out so far again
we gotta get out of our own way the way defense is playing we owe them a score
what kind of spot was that by the ref
lamar is my qb no doubt but his decision making these past weeks have had me frustrated with him prove me wrong mvp
fuck tj watt
lamars going to be under the gun all game now losing stanley hurts bad
that will probably be our most impactful injury this year cant overstate how bad it will be to have stanley out
bro im gonna be honest as i sit here in my lj jersey dude has been making wildly risk decisions every single game this season i do not want to see him become a liability coaches need to sear this into his brain
this game is really hard to watch emotionally
please let ronnie be alright
steelers offense looks ass so far we need a td
apparently helmet to helmet contact isnt a penalty on lamar
hands down best drive all season

only one pass and ran all over them win for stanley
gus is a starter on other rosters
we have no choice but to run it down their throats theyre not stopping the run and its the perfect way to neutralize the pass rush
gus and jk are the future
yall see watt so pissed lmao
offsetting flags
if refs were smart the penalties would be offset
judon is a fucking imbecile
judon you dumb fuck
even though it didnt look intentional why is it always fucking judon
ref is an absolute pussy if you dont want to be touched dont be in the middle of a scrum between fuckin 200300lb mammoths
man judon got the short end of the stick on that didnt mean to was trying to split them up but fuck
im glad yannick is here to stay
man i want to see calais squish bens ugly ass
i dont care there is only 344 left run the ball dont give steelers ball back
i know he wasnt trying to hit the ref but hes still an idiot for trying to break out like that so close to a ref play stupid games win stupid prizes
romo hearing and interpreting the audible calls makes me so angry at the normal commentator quality
its not an int but what an awful fucking throw
weve dominated this game and have practically nothing to show for it
hey diddle diddle dobbins up the middle
the number of formation penalties this team has every week is fucking infuriating
say it romo say his name
justin tucker
a run heavy game and were the last game to reach half time

lol
can we just let it set in that defense pitched a shutout so far
colts fan dropping by tucker is just so sensational cherish him
a lot went wrong but god dammit our guys are showing some god damn heart today i love it
didnt even look at the tv knew hed make it

positives the steelers offense was shut out the whole half 26 straight quarters of scoring now the run game is looking strong

negatives losing phillips and stanley wtf judon lamar is still messy today ball control needs to be a focus
its a pleasure to watch the kicking goat casually nail a 51 yarder with 0 fear
goddamn i love never worrying about our kicker missing
being up 10 without ronnie and judon with 2 turnovers whilst dominating top and yards just shows how good we can be if we get everything working
steelers defense is legitimately a nightmare matchup for lamar the third year qb is up 177 at the half i understand he hasnt been perfect but gotta give the kids props were popping off some big runs because steelers defense was told dont let lamar out of your sights yet hes still making crucial plays in a rainy day lets keep this up in the second half
fuck off romo
wtf was that that pass was never gonna make it lamars been a borderline liability this game not that ben is doing much either but jesus
jackson oats his chest and says my fault

no shit
this defense deserves better than our offense
lamar has been pittsburghs best offense today holy shit
this team is winning in spite of lamar and the passing game an elite defense and running game is whats carrying us face the facts whenever we pass lamar puts us in worse positions
lamars decision making this season has been fucking awful
lamar refuses to read defenses pre snap roman refuses to do anything pre snap to help him out its like the book on developing quarterbacks is being willfully ignored year 3 is the make or break year for quarterbacks and these decisions are not getting any better from lamar or the coaching staff
i dont buy the its just a good defense steelers arent forcing 4 turnovers every week this is bad qb play
why cant hollywood brown get open first round pick with no catches we need a spark on offense to go with the run game
this game would be 240 ravens without the turnovers
defense doing that thing again where they are nowhere to be seen around open receivers past the sticks
take some notes lamar thats how fast you need to release the ball sometimes
we have 17 points they have one good drive all game and take the lead
lets see if the mvp can wake up after 25 quarters
time to punch back
just gifting them shit today
also im a giant lamar fan but come on hes just playing like garbage right now
we need a takeaway from our d right now
i believe in the madden curse now
idgaf about the scoring streak run the ball on second and eight
please stop going 5 wide please stop it
i see our offence has used the bye week exceptionally well
that is the weakest holding call i think i have ever seen lmao what the fuck
we scored 3 tds there dont me
so one thing im realizing is that even though this isnt a textbook come from behind game this is the third lead change lamar has been ridiculed for not being able to keep the team in games if he isnt leading this might be a step in the right direction for his confidence especially against the steelers
this reminds me of last years game in pitt where the refs just walked them down the field every drive
refs blind to steelers holding but got 2020 vision on our team
stupid cunt claypool silencing the fans yeah easy when the refs drive the field for you
they couldnt even find a replay to show for the pass interference on marlon because it was such hot garbage
please run the ball please run the ball and burn some clock please run the ball burn some clock and dont give big ben any time for a lastminute drive
ejections over 100 yards of penalties blatantly not calling oline holding or obvious pick plays on pits like whats even the point to watch nfl when its this poorly called
refs carrying old big ben because hes too heavy to do it himself
frankly if lamar cant manufacture a drive here we arent made for the super bowl yet
eat this clock get seven end it
i am fucking in love with dobbins
this seems like a good time to bring up the fact that jk dobbins banged my girlfriends cousin
omg i hate this team on third down and it shouldnt be like that
this 4th down is do or die for us
that was a horrible play call and everyone is blaming lamar he had no shot on that play
they literally cannot stop the fucking run and roman got anxious bc they stopped one run play
not even a fan of either team but i mean kind of unnecessary roughness or something jeez
forgot about the steeler refs
analyst ravens are imposing their will on this steelers team folks we absolutely love to hear it
steelers and refs vs ravens every year
bengals fan here just wanted to say
fuck the steelers
thats not on roman lamar has gifted them 14 shit happens gotta play better
60 steelers at 51 ravens at 1 pm25 cowboys at 241 eagles for primetime tell me thats not some bullshit
steelers are literally just tackling lamar on every play and the refs are like idk i didnt see anything

edit a word
they couldve been called for unnecessary roughness 3 times already
wow where has this boykin been
gorgeous throw
this is going to be a good but strokeinducing game
i think they put a gps voice in boykins helmet cause he was actually where he was supposed to be lmao
removed
marcus peanuts
karma for the bullshit pi
i say that makes up for the pass interference
4 yards every run is what we need at the very least
bruh i missed the first fiveminutes did lamar throw a pick six
my wife is from central pa needless to say we havent spoken today fuck the steelers
bro are you fucking kidding me
chew an aspirin folks gonna be a stressful day lol
dude fucking throw it jesus
so at this rate therell be 15 turnovers between both teams but the end of the game
hes gotta calm the fuck down
is it just me or could he have ran that in or at least close to the end zone
im loving this defense right now
lamar on the bench wondering what that kind of protection would be like
both teams have a championship defense clearly i just need lamar to awaken the inner mvp
are the refs just ignoring the play clock pretty sure they had 2 plays out of 3 run out the clock and no call
jimmy smith is like a fine wine hes ironically gotten better for us even as his talent has dropped off simply by being able to step into a less demanding role
that proves my theory refs have no fucking idea where a kick goes out hes 10 yards off
we have to capitalize lamar cant pump fake three times just give it to dobbins and gus theyre gaining at least 45 yards in 1st down runs we dont need to pass on these jabronis
10 minutes in and the steelers offense hasnt done shit without a gifted dpi thats a positive just need to finish a drive
steelers are so fucking dirty
fuck you pittsburgh
tj watt can fuck himself
jesus fucking christ and of course its fucking watt despite it being accidental fuck
fuck offense were winning with defense now
it has to be bad coaching why doesnt anyone tell jackson to learn when to throw it away
bless up big ronnie get better soon my guy
turned on the game and the first thing i see is stanley getting carted off the field fuck my life bro
i cant even watch after the ronnie stanley injury im so hurt boys
orlando brown could be an lt on other teams the season isnt over
i wonder if ngakoue could play o line
ravens need to run it more they literally get 45 yards a carry
lamar throws a td omg goat mvp

lamar throws an incompletion wtf how did he regress when will he learn to throw
all crap aside the ravens are playing good football on both sides of the field turnovers were bad but offense has moved well against the 2nd best d in the league
wait running as a runheavy offense works
that drive looked like the 2019 ravens
checkmate roman our pass blocking olineman are all injured now you ha w no choice but to run the ball
tj watt could stab lamar with a rusty faceshield and i dont think the refs would call a penalty
calling it were resigning gus next year
dont be stupid boys
weak ass call ejection my ass
i mean he obviously wasnt trying to punch the official but jesus judon you are such an idiot
everyone saying judon is a dumbass rn he did not swing at the ref hes pulling his arm from the coach

should he have been penalized sure dqd hell no
nfl refs are the weakest people on this planet i swear
judon will be a great jet
judon was pulling that pos steeler off peters facemask
oh boy here comes the can we trade judon posts as if anyone wants that enough to give something up
lol this is a good game really feisty havent seen that from the ravenssteelers matchup in while
desack elliott
this is ravenssteelers football

i hate it but i love it

deshon has really impressed me screw et3
seeing campbell jump is fucking scary
this game definitely has a different atmosphere than last years 2 games the rivalry is back fuck the steelers

and watt can suck my dick
uh oh ben faking an injury there he setting up the toughness comeback bs
fuck that rapist
i just had a heart attack
i think we can survive without stanley with brown jr switched to the left and fluker on the right
i love that lamar always has a smile on his face after stuff like that hes starting to have fun out there
now 4 starters jfc just wrap everyone in bubble wrap and send judon to therapy
incomplete but jesus fuck lamar
all those lamar haters love to knock his throws but love those runs
honestly 200 yards from this offense against that defense is hella fucking impressive especially with no stanley
dobbins is so good
snead isnt the flashiest player but hes consistent when we need him
aaaaaaand thats why im at home and not coaching on sundays
means nothing but lamars behind the back spiral pass to ref was amazing
romo didnt have shit to say about tucker
romo quiet
should honestly be blowing them out
i swear to god you could make the goal post four feet wide and tucker would still make 90 of his kicks
defense is playing lights out once again first half shutout
despite everything i feel we have the momentum weve kept the steelers offense off the field
best run game iv seen all season dobbins looks amazing cant wait to get ingram back to
i can already tell 4th quarter gonna have me hyperventilatingand im not looking forward to it
steelers offence hasnt scored yet
all this talk about the steelers being the 1 defense nope

were 1 by far
lets go revenge for ronnie
big ben just doubled his passing yards in one play concern
jimmy smith still a lockdown
lamar is killing us
lamar is single handedly keeping the steelers in the game 3 crucial turnovers that are 100 on him
lamar man what are you doing
been seeing lots of comments


lamar is playing maybe one of the worst games of his career


the fact that our gdts are saying stuff like this every single week this season is big concerning
lamar had a bye week to prepare and hes putting up the worse performance of his career i dont get it
lamar has made average lbs look like pro bowlers today
refs still butthurt that judon made contact with one of them
what is our defense doing can somebody explain why they are suddenly just giving up 10 yards plays out of nowhere
extremely greg romanishly

uh oh looks like were trailing now time to abandon the run
cmon lamar defense can only bail you out so many times
dont wanna run on 2ndbut well run 3rd and 8
our passing game is nothing but lamar trying to improvise nothing has worked as designed
play calling has become predictable and stale
need a turnover
what is this i really dont understand how people become ocs and are this trash get your fucking eyes off the microsoft surface and watch the field
watching this game is the opposite of a good time
why the fuck has tj watt been unblocked for like 25 of the snaps
please lamar do something
please just let gus and dobbins do their job stop going empty sets

i seriously believe roman and the team are letting social media response and pff hype from stats dictate our game plans
lets go lamar overcome adversity and lets score show we can play from behind and get the lead back
watt is such a dirty fuck literally after every single play he does some stupid bullshit
you can only blame lamar so much when receivers cant get open and the line cant get you more than 2 seconds
go fuck yourself refs
ravens made a good play quick throw a flag
were not getting that call with these refs but i think its still a smart challenge
knee that came down on the white we arent gonna win the challenge
we just need one more stop
you all love lamar again or what
i remember how it feels to be a ravens fan circa 20112018
bonds literally gave up on the play
who tf is 38
i hate bitching about refs but omg
what the fuck did we do to these refs
have there been any calls at all on pittsburgh after that first late hit
why was peters just watching that whole play
the refs are literally giving the steelers the game
another questionable penalty by the refs what the fuck
these penalties are a bit excessive
refs go suck a dick
what is up with the penalties this year seems like we get so many this season
was that not an illrgal pick
lol that whole drive was giftwrapped by the refs
its just not fun to watch games that are completely manufactured by the refs
110 yards a free touchdown gifted by the refs john has to be vocal about this bullshit
this d just gave up a long field with undisciplined play lack of pressure and bad coverage cmon man
100 ref aided drive
refs can call the game however they want but just call the game the same both ways
throw it and wait for the ref

gameplan is solid for ben
holy fuck the bungles are gonna beat the titans
awful 3rd 5
i dont like the feeling of this one bit
someone hold me
why tf is it empty backfield on 4th and 3
well the run the ball crowd technically got what we were asking for lol
empty backfield on 4th and short this is honestly shit that ocs get fired for
holy fuck im just in disbelief at how bad that call was
fuck the refs fuck the steelers
need iv sneed
we should get more time
can we get some time back on the clock then
they better add time to the clock
fuck dude my heart im screaming so loud in going to get evicted
lol fake injuries because the defense is gassed
where is our 12 seconds back
we shouldve gotten time on the clock cuz of the injury

wtffffff
unreal refs love them
some classic fucking refball sealed this
you dont see clearer fouls ever
damn cant believe what i just saw duck the steelers and fuck the north
i think lj will learn from this
steeler fan here coming in peace who for years loses fingernails watching the best rivalry in the nfl wanted to say i wish ronnie stanley who is a freaking warrior a speedy recovery its fun to hate each other the ravens are always tough as nails and i am here for it much respect get well soon ronnie if im going to talk shit i want u on the field

call me what u will but lamar has single handedly fucked us
that looked bad

refs fucked yall

birdgang
people saying it wasnt intentional tj watt tried to kill desean watson out of bounds in the texans game

with these calls i wish judon would have knocked that mf out lol
blame of the game is lamar and anybody who says otherwise needs to take their tv back to the store and never watch football again
have a good game games i believe in yall
if you are watching this sober you are a warrior
boykin and snead showing up fucking finally
thats how you come back from a pick 6
boykin looks incredible today maybe adding dez to the squad is already paying dividends
im gonna have a heart attack today
thats how you respond
good ass drive after the mistake
dez bryant is a wr whisperer bruh
so we are all gonna stay here right just let the steelers fans melt down in the main thread
love to see steeler fans crying about refs like they arent one of the golden boy franchises that get favored constantly lol
are they the fuck serious that wasnt catchable
peters taketh and peters giveth
gonna die of cardiac arrest today goodbye cruel world
he ripped the ball back under the pile ha
turn it into 7 lets go
what do you get when you cross an angry raven and a shitty ass call by the refs you get what you fucking deserve
steelers fans gonna cry about the refs im sure
son of a mother fucking bitch these games
damnit man thats two lamar
why is he so afraid to take off and run
ive seen that type of mistake happen one too many times keeps pumping then falls out
saw that coming with the three pump fakes
bad lamar you are at the fucking goal line this is the steelers their pressure is going to get to you after 4 secs you dont pump fucking fake when the pocket around you has basically collapsed

oline did its job and gave you more than enough time to make a decision thats 100 percent on lamar
this offence is just up and down lack of consistency will kill a team the good means shit if you follow it up with bad play
lets get a fucking safety going here
someone needs to tell lamar hes playing in the nfl and not his back yard
lamar has to fucking tuck and run there
my fedex guy wont put packages on my porch lol
god i miss yanda so much the big bearded beautiful bastard
were playing fast and smart on d lets keep it up
short field need some points lamar has to focus on ball security
offense did not even look that bad so far against the best defense in the league good shit guys
i just want to see ngakoue get a sack today lets go
well it was a good year the o line is already shit
how was that dirty he rolled into him
lamar is making god awful decisions
fortunately ben looks terrible today
remember when peyton manning got carried by his defense with the colts to a super bowl that might have to be us this year
man that turnover in the red zone gonna be painful at the end suspect 3 extra points would be enough to win this game
lamar needs to stop trying to be a pocket passer and be lamar be the person that got you the mvp and not this pocket person
its almost like we built a team to pound and pound
gus the bus
x200b

touchdown ravens
minkah definitely led with his head on that lamar hit
everyone stepping up rn
holy shit did greg roman just adjust
how did stanley go down and then we dominate the power run on that drive football doesnt make sense lol
ronnie stanley getting injured is so terrible

i get so sad whenever a big bear goes down
lamar took the toughest shot of his career on the chin literally and got right back up obviously he cant be getting hit all the time but all those people and media who said hes fragile can fuck off kid is tough
that was the best drive ive seen all season
i hate that it took stanley going down for us to start running the offense this way
if not for the fumble this gamed likely be 217 this is tense but we knew it would be weve answered the call well today
tj watt crying on the sidelines hahah
watt are you crying about
the steelers are bitches
fuck these officials man

if you need 5 to talk it over its no fucking penalty

no one wants to see you on the screen
stupid fucking judon
judon is literally good for one thing and thats getting penalties
alright nevermind judon didnt do anything that ref flopped
judon is dumb but that wasnt his fault
thats the same fucking ref put the punt 10 yard down fucking steelers fan
campbell is our god
im just enjoying the hell out of nantz romo
saints fan here that pi on peters early in the game was a weak call and so was that judon call
anyone see that dudes flacco hoodie elite
ravens steelers is the best rivslry by far in the nfl
yannick made first contact i love it


great call wink lets fuckin goooooo
the d might be faster without judon its fine fts
so is ben actually hurt or is he just acting hurt like he always does
there it is the annual ben rothlisberger fake injury against us
bens gonna play up an injury and then limp around all game because he loves when people think hes tough
i miss ronnie but its nice to see how well were doing without him against such a good defense
its almost time for a bomb to marquise
lamar is trying so hard to prove the doubters wrong that hes proving them right
ravens are proving the forward pass was a mistake
they are not the 1 defense they have just played shitty teams
over 150 rushing yards in the first half
hello everyone i hope you have some room on the bandwagon for a texans fan this year my friend recently took his own life and the ravens were his team immersing myself in the ravens seems like the only appropriate thing to do cant wait to join yall along the journey this year
they called justin tucker one of the absolute best and im offended
automatuck
tuck god
that clock stop

lamar hurling the spare ball just in time to snap down the live ball with 3 seconds left incredible
that tucker wink at the camera
god i fucking love justin tucker
remember how bad the thread was 9 seconds in


the teams usenonuse of dobbins to this point is absurd he may be the 3rd best player on offense after lj and andrews and they barely use him
what its like to have justin tucker as your kicker
were destroying this team and were playing like shit we can turn this into a throttling if we stop shooting ourselves in the foot
at the least this dispels any notion of the steelers being superior in every facet of the game a take i saw quite a bit on their sub leading up to this game
man theres a lot to like about this game and a lot to not like really up and down
why is the pick6 the highlight they show when the steelers are losing so badly
we need to resign bowser to replace judon please
the fact that wasnt a flag and the peters one earlier was lol
steelers complaining about flags is hilarious
lamar wtf are you doing
holy fuck lamar
thats 14 points just off lamar that is unacceptable mvp or not
run the ball you get 170 yards in a half and we just abandon it so frustrating
lamar has not looked good since before the chiefs game which is concerning
embarassing stretch of football there
all of the steelers points are off turnovers today literally the only way they can score
my buddy defending lamar and saying hes not throwing bad today is just dumb
lamar is giving them the game come on wake up
well bounce back
feed the bus and dobbins
supposed to be a penalty for talking to the refs with no mask
if we lose the game its on lamar
they wont show a replay what the hell happened to the defense no one within 10 feet of the receiver
lamar the anti flacco plays well against the bengals poor against the steelers
did anyone watch unsolved mysteries on netflix what was up with the alien episode
lamar been coughing up the ball all day and been throwing reckless passes he needs to stop being so reckless with the football
steelers could win this game just by throwing the ball up in the air the refs are clearly just calling pi no matter what
is this the first time the steelers have even driven to our end of the field garbage dpi call got them there this would be a blowout if lamar was just having a below average game as opposed to an alltime terrible game
weird how we didnt need to dive at bens legs there
momentum has been completely shifted
theyre just running short slants and curls and moving the chains odds our offense is taking notes
all momentum has been lost this sucks
no point in paying judon when we got ferguson and bowser and ngakoue
we sure can give up a lead but can never come back
defense could only hold them off so long lamar fucked this game
i love lamar but this one is on him if we lose
lamar will get the blame of the game if he doesnt ball out here in the end of the 3rd and 4th
dammit we gotta stop playing playoff football
where are all th fucking calm down were up guys people this is why you play like youre always down until clock hits 0000
what is a j balvun
anyone blaming roman needs to look deep at lamar a nfl qb should be trusted to throw a corner route
i just bought a lamar jersey and this is my first game wearing it this is obviously my fault im sorry everyone
ball security coach is edward scissorhands
and now were seeing badrews again

jesus
can we also be honest this patchwork offensive line against the kind of d line we are facing isnt helping
roman has to go
really a qb dive on 3 and 8 welp boys somebody get the gun
every time the ravens get the lead they forget how to play football
hill jumped out the way fml
hollywood had 1v 1 on the outside would rather have had a deep shot whatever the outcome than a dive play
3rd and 8 and youre running an option with our 3rd string rb with the division on the line
unfortunate that hollywood couldnt play today
i just wanted my team to win and hold a lead

guess thats too much to fucking ask for
cbs sitcoms will heal the racial divide
how are we not throwing on 3rd and 8
probably the biggest defensive possession of the game inspiring stuff that they held up here

if you gotta play for field goals and grind the win out in all for it
im gonna throw up
im so fucking sick of this game ronnie and the turnovers are just making this so unenjoyable
lamar missed that wide open td fuck
four down territory we gotta get to the 1 with everything then qb sneak
so ravens have to get a td 3 times for it to count cool
every damn year this game is some extra shit
to the naysayers bandwagoners and fairweather fans

remember this drive and dont show your face in the postgame thread
best ravenssteelers game in a while so much drama action and momentum shifts o
why is this bonds guy playing football
why arent they calling holding on the steelers like god damn why do the refs hate us
marlon punch this bitch so i can quit drinking
never thought i would say these words

we need averett back to get bonds outta here
dude these flags are actually insane
i refuse to believe that if they are calling pi this closely that we shouldnt have some in our favour
thats a soft ass fucking foul
wtf ref was right there that was opi on that 3rd down conversion
9 penalties for 110 yards christ
i have never felt worse about a team 4 game above 500 in my life
clear pick missed
claypool sucks dicks behind sheetz on his off days
cant imagine all these bs dpi calls are cheap for the steelers to buy
fuck still plenty of time left time for the offense to work some magic
how was that not offensive picking
the refs have been awful
refball
does anyone have good recommendations for blood pressure medication
pittsburgh refs
our offense spotting pittsburgh 14 points is never a recipe for success
i wanted to see that pass interference replay
we always have to beat the refs to beat the steelers every fucking year
refsburg
lets not forget that our defense has only given up 21 points and one of the steelers touchdown drives started on our own 21
a bright spot dobbins will become a star
i do not believe heyward is hurt hell be back

they were just getting gashed
did roman finally find the missing running pages from the playbook
nobody is kicking shit here tones
oh god oh fuck oh shit someone hold me
win or lose no matter what ravenssteelers are by far my favourite games of the year and arguably in the entire league they are the rivalry of the sport absolutely must watch every single time
run the option here on fourth and short except lamar keeps it this time as hes trained the steelers d for the pitch

it cant go tits up
everyone pray to whatever god u believe in right here
this offense needs to snack away snack away snack away yall
i would run that play 1010 times because that was going to be touchdown
blame of the game lamar
roman is on drugs
tht qb draw was the most predictable bullshit ever
i like going for it dont mind a qb run hate a qb run from an empty set dont see why it wasnt the qb power set from the seattle game
we should really have more time here right
they better reset that game clock
tight butthole here boys
the andrews drop was on andrews he stopped running lamar threw it perfectly for a receiver that was still running and it would have hit in stride
move your ass mark come on
how is that not pi
how the hell do they not put time back
no time added is bullshit
good game shit refs questionable playcalling and turnovers fucked us
ref ball thanks no extra time shit ejection multiple things
steelers get 10 penalties on previous drive softer then that last play gtfo
what a shit called game for real ravens lost this but stop letting these refs ruin games
notice how none of the ravens dove at the linemens legs there
i still think our d can win us this game
helmet hit but no flag dirty steelers
im just going to say it im unbothered by judon getting the boot
most pissed off ive been at lamar hope he shows something
the eye test showed the lamar has not been playing good this year idk where some of yall got those stats saying hes doing better than last year
romo is a clown you take the chance and go for the 1st down and run it way down on the clock for the win

no way in hell you kick 3 and hope to get it back
these trump ads make me wanna kill myself
im still astounded that the call was made to not add time to the clock you mean to tell me both teams are sprinting down the field to hurry up and spike the ball and not one ref went oh hey a steeler is laying there fucking dead back there before there was 8 seconds left if thats the cases then we need to really consider bringing in new refs to the league
are you guys blind boykin clearly ran a bad route there simple curl route where he drifted toward the middle instead of coming back toward the qb will result in a pick a lot of the time when a wr does that
reaction to the rollout
reaction to the td
how did they not add time to the clock
i miss going to games man
i legit barely slept havent been this nervousexcited for a steelers game like this in a while
hopefully we take control of this game from start to finish i wanna see the clowns tomorrow on all sports network to eat crow and re think their thoughts on these overrated ass steelers who have beat absolutely nobody till they beat the titans by 3 points
lets get ready to rumble
ben id like you to meet calais

thats your nose over there
that literally couldnt have been any fucking worse
lamar had a dude wide open to his left open
how was that not roughing the passer by the way
shit throw but nothing that cant be overcame
fucking late hit too
aaaaaand its over
time to abandon the run
offense is garbage again what else is new fuck
idk whats going on with these guys but either lamar cant see shit or these receivers just cant get open there is nothing over 15 yards ever
that makes up for the other two late hits they didnt call
this game is about penalties and turnovers

wow you mean just like every other game thats ever happened
i love lamar i have the dudes jersey hanging in my room cant say im comfortable with the thought of him signing a 200m deal if he stays playing like this
did sone of yall start watching football yesterday that was a fucking clear late hit
sneads 1 appearance per game has come early lol
boykin sighting confirmed
there we go great pass lamar
everyone can get back on the bandwagon now
fuck yeah boykin two big catches already
where all my boykin haters at

see what happens when lamar throws a ball within 4ft of a huge receiver
big boykin no little boykin
alright now lets fuck up the rapist
dude steelers fans over in the main game thread are so fucking toxic
lets go yannick
so much hate there is love good way to put it

i hate the steelers so much but darn if these arent my favorite games every year
bullshit call
punchout peters
the streak bois
mp juiceman with that 4d chess picking up that pass interference in order to force the fumble
the marcus peters experience is a rollercoaster haha
get fucked shittsburgh
peters said fuck that penalty imma get them off the field myself
this is gonna be a good fucking game
glad the replay review team didnt screw that up like id expect them to do
we tiring out this defense babyyy
tj watt hit rg3 late every play last year too
jk is literally ray rice jr
dobbins is the new fucking rice but without the wife beating shit
fuck
ffs lamar needs to stop holding the bar so far out
these qbcreated sacks are killing us this year
we knew what this game was going to be hold on to memorabilia bois
defense gotta bail us out a little
x200b

lamar do better
hes so indecisive this year figure it tf out dawg thats two turnovers that are on him
how you really gonna let them have a delay of game lmao
feed jk g rod u fuck
jimmy tryna punch the ball out love to see it
we need points now while the steelers offense is still ass
wtf is that spot
that was clean lol
tj watt is still so salty from when lamar put him in the dirt last year explains all the late hits
obviously either tore something or broke something there
holy fuck thats a broken ankle god fucking damnit fuck this brutal sport man
they nees to be flagged they are completely reckless behind the line of scrimmage
wtf are we gonna do on the line now there are hardly any options to begin with and now we have to find a replacement for stanley too fuck
literally in terms of how bad this affects our team losing stanley is as bad as it gets other than losing lamar
bruh lamar is going to get killed without a line
anyone else feel uneasy when lamar does herky jerky shit in the middle of getting tackled
lamar doesnt have that fire or anger after bad drivesplays like last season whats the deal
dudei just cant believe that fucking happened

lamar has got to be head on a fucking swivel man
this game has been nauseating so far
fuck the steelers
the game is still tied
we need a defensive td
look at what the steelers are doing on o quick passes fuck cant we do that shit
look how fast that ball comes out why dont we do that i just dont understand
bro we will win with defense
come on do it for ronnie
we can be contenders without stanley i still believe maybe by trade deadline we make a move for ot still hoping for the best though
this game should at least be 137 come on offense
lamar about to break tj watts ankles for ronnie
i like watson but that commercial is garbage
tired of everyone defending tj he plays dirty and reckless every week you dont coach players to tackle with their heads down diving at other players legs he hit rg3 late multiple times last year
run it down their throats fuck these guys
now well throw for some reason
keep running the ball
jk got me throbbins
finally were running the ball thank fuck
beat these pieces of shit
best drive of the season so far
gus bus has no brakes beep beep
thats targeting in college
minkah needs to be suspended for that hit
so much for the steelers unreal run defense
look at that we run the ball and we score
yes that drive was fucking ravens football
lamar was a fucking trooper for taking that hit
that drive reminded me of last years ravens
fuck man i know his chin hurts but that drive would make stanley proud
best run d my fucking ass fuck these motherfuckers dawg run that damn ball
lol had two starting lineman go out and just went out and bitched them anyway love to see it
the ravens are running the ball
8 runs on the drive you love to see it
glad roman didnt try to get fancy at the 1 yard line there no team in the nfl can stop us reliably if we need a single yard this offense built too well to not get 1 yard when they need it
that was a ravens 2019 drive right there lets fucking go
now im getting hyped thinking about dez as a run blocker
stanley down ingram out

gus jk well fucking do it again
this is a what did it cost everything type of game isnt it
if baby bitch ben took a hit like that there would be shit in his pants right now
watt and his coach are screaming at each other nice
tj getting spicy on the sideline
dobbins and edwards is the new rice and pierce
mcphee setting the edge like a boss
let em fight
mathew judon may be the biggest fucking idiot in the nfl get him the fuck out of here
body built by being a fuckin idiot
yo thats a bs call i know judons gone at the end of this season but like he wasnt trying to punch the damn official
lmao what a bullshit contact lmao
is that geriatric fuck of a referee for real get your fucking hand out of his face if you dont want to get touched fucking spastic
really official fucking flopped
weak ass call weak ass official
ejected from the game for incidental contact nice
so judons waving arm hitting a refs arm after the play nets the steelers 15 yards did i see that wrong
this defense
hahahaha fuck you fat man
nice stop after the idiocy
yannick was there fast
this game is gonna turn our boys into men turning point of the season low key
fuck that fat ass rapist
look at the way ben is playing rnwhy do we even worry about lamar
legend with the flacco elite hoodie
that flacco elite shirt
i fucking love how chippy we are we look fucking angry
judon just trying to help clean things up sucks i think he doesnt get a fine on that tho shouldnt anyway
loving this next man up adjustment we are landing some heavy blows on them big jen also has a big problem with his elbow again
the intentional forward fumble for an extra 3 yards
this game is giving me a heart attack jfc
thats a 2020 looking slide
lamar is out here practicing ground ball drills
if thats an int im the pope
ill admit im a lamar apologist but that throw was actually pretty bad
were so good when we stick to what we do best
dobbins is going to be amazing for us
jk dobbins is awesome
i like snead man hes no superstar but he does good work for us
hes called big truss for a reason have some trust in our qb instead of blowing his mistakes out of proportion
thankfully they gave us that
fuck these refs
bullshit he was out of bounds anyways
automatic this guy
yo 2 guys chasing lamar i seriously hate this cheap ass team
justin who the fuck is harrison butker tucker
man these refs are ridiculous lol
this half of football aged me two years i swear
without that pick6 this game is 170
dobbbbbbbins he got out but still we got it clocked
incredible awareness by lamar
this is why i have a tucker jersey dude is the best
dobbins kept chugging there did way too much work to get to the side line for them to say his progress was stopped
every tucker kick is a money shot
massive run by dobbins there there is a huge difference between kicking from 5055 and 5660 in mt feels like tucker basically never misses from 5055
the announcers trying really hard not to refer to tucker as the goat
say it romo
did anyone see that tucker wink
tucker is so phenomenal its at the point where a 50 yarder in the wind and rain is just expected by us never take this man for granted
those points at the half are big need to be prepared for pitt to try and air it out after the half
refs tried to fuck us on that run called forward progress and dobbins didnt get out yet didnt blow the fucking whistle lol almost cost us three points
big bens elbow is going to be the big question in this second half
fat faking fuck
bowser much better then dumbass judon
jimmy playing lights out
dont know exactly what their roles are but bowser sure is playing better than judon
no way thats grabbing tony
i hope we resign bowser hes finally developing and hell be cheap compared to judon for example
two notes on that drive great stop from bowser i remember watching his tape out of college and seeing him make similar plays in coverage glad to see him develop at the next level also very underrated coverage on smith a bit of grabbing peters was called for the same thing in the first q but he rode dionte out of bounds cant ask for much more in coverage
gotta disagree with romo there thats just good coverage from jimmy there but i do reserve the right to call the refs pieces of shit if this kind of amazing coverage gets called a penalty against us
steelers already got a dpi on an uncatchable ball dont need another freebie
that play showed jimmys experience
our d looks nasty as fuck and im loving it
why are we throwing the ball
im getting really frustrated by lamar today
lamar is the only reason why the steelers are in this game
they have 2 tds on lamars turnoversbruh is playing like shit
not gonna lie lamar smirking on the sideline isnt a good look last year he would get really emotional and angry havent seen that today
literally just allowing them to make this game competitive
all the steeler points have been gifted to them by lamar turnovers
everyone is trying to blame everything but lamar dude is playing terribly this game and no one else hes throwing it straight to defenders not roman and ima huge lamar homer but hes ass this game
madden curse is back
its on lamar

but what is with these play designs are they designed to get players open because they arent
the referees union wants to complain about masks but this moron doesnt even have his mask hardly on lmao
lamar is playing bad the oc is play calling bad the weather is bad can we please run the ball right now
something is fucking wrong with this offense
for a guy who made very few mistakes last year he is making some awful decisions
dude football isnt even fun to watch and is bad for my heart why do i even do this shit to myself
who the fuck is terrell bonds
that dpi was weak saucecmon
im sad af i thought hollywood was gonna be a weapon this year
why have we not thrown one deep shot to hollywood in 3 strait games
refball fucking hate that ref turtle looking mother fucker
defense can only hold them off so long
marlon punch it plz
this is literally a fucking joke
people complaining about the d well they cant do literally everything especially when our offense is stagnant at best and lamar dressed as a double agent for halloween pittsburgh wouldnt even be in this game if our offense would stop fucking up
man ferguson is making his presence felt in a positive way its nice to have an olb who does that
ahh i see second half against the eagles defense has reappeared
if lamar doesnt get his shit together this game is done simple as that
this is frustrating cmon lamar i know he can pull it together its just a matter of will he
why do rappers have mcdonalds meals
this is so winnable but were about to abandoned the run and pass every down which will kill us
greg roman cannot play from behind
read option with a 4th string rb hmmmm
greg roman play calling is ass bruh
guy needs to learn how to play in big games no point in adding weapons if you cant get the ball to them they are just going to stuff the box now and force lamar to throw another pick to them
honestly this ravens offense sucks
i am not optimistic about us at this point even if we pull it out our offense has noticeably taken a step backwards further than the one our defense has taken forward lamar is trying to do too much instead of taking the easy play sometimes he needs to shore that up if he wants to be the real deal i have faith in him to correct it but i dont think this year is our year anymore especially with the injuries and general state of the ol
anytime hill is in loss
bernie meme i am once again asking you to throw one deep ball the entire game
feels like gotta get a random play like a fumble or interception to swing the momentum back or a punt return or something


not a huge fan of running the ball on 3rd and 8 either but probably a 4 down type of math if the play had gotten 56 yards
the amount of people saying watt wasnt even touched without realizing that is literally the whole point of read option is hilarious
31st ranked passing offense who could possibly be worse
lamar isnt playing great but when hes bailing after looking down the field its pretty obvious the real problem are the pack of wrs but continue steaming fans
lamar playing like its the playoffs
lamar might as well have been a real llama today i love him but jfc
that turnover in the red zone feeling really horrible now could have used at least 3
i havent seen a single pass outside of the boykin td where lamar has trusted a receiver and launched it every pass has just been some panicked toss after holding for too long id be down for a proper bomb amid an otherwise balanced attack
duvernayyyyyyy
fucking refs man
fuck off refs
need for snead
i feel the need

the need iv snead
refs are wearing more yellow than pittsburgh today
my blood is fucking boiling
this is what frustrates me about lamar as much as i love him throws 2 really really bad short yardage picks then throws an absolute beautiful ball 30 yards down the field to duvernay
in the words of ray lewis lamar is pissed off for greatness
bad throw hollywood was wide open no reason to lob it so high and so far
that should have been a easy fucking td lamar why would you need to throw it so far over man
ref just rolled his eyes having to do the replay we arent getting it
does 1 knee count as 2 feet
they called the shin as a completion earlier in the dolphins game please dont duck this up nfl
fuck it ill do it again
lets goooooo fuck the steelers
when hollywood wants touchdown hollywood gets touchdown
ravens td

refs on suicide watch
look i am the ultimate dont blame the refs guy but fuck those cock suckers and nice revenge play
fuck anyone saying brown is a bust i dont give a shit find another team to bandwagon
defense had time to rest this is where they step it up
refs steelers
some1 give me some beta blockers the way im about to have a heart attack
the fact that the ref even thought that was a foul is awful
glad theyll call that bullshit old on us but are completely ignoring the steelers
and another flag and another flag
im getting real tired of that refs face
so no replay on the pi
are the refs from pittsburgh or something wtf
fuck all refs
can we see the replay
marcus peters wanted no part of tackling him
pass rush hasnt been getting home this drive thats the difference
ive noticed nearly every game we play against a good wr they have little to no catches first half and then dominate in the second
fucking refs
fucking refs gave them that td
we gifted them way too many points early on and now its coming back to wreck us
time for a 7 minute touchdown drive
what are bisciotti decosta and harbaugh doing about the blatantly unfair officiating the team has experienced since harbaughs tirade towards the refs on mnf
first game winning drive for lamar
how tf are you supposed to play defense on receivers at some point its kind of ridiculous you cant even be in their vicinity without a flag
desperately need a replay of the pi on marlo
lamar is lamars worst enemy dudes super talented but his tendency to panic results in picks and turnovers hes gotta get more resilient mentally
we been shooting ourselves in the fucking foot im so tired of it just about every game we get dumb ass penalties
9 penalties for 110 yards second game in a row penalties have been an issue for us
get ready for a bunch of holding and illegal formations penalties
youd think that with the refs calling bs pi all over the place the ravens would dial up a bomb or two
greg roman with good play calling for once run the ball kill the clock dont leave the refs any time
jk needs to be the 1 going forward unless he cant block at all there is no reason he shouldnt be the 1
jk you can come over and fuck my wife
dobbins is rb 1
dobbins is the best osu rb since eddie george dont at me
that dobbins guy is pretty good he should play more
why the fuck not run it quick before the 2 minute warning incase you dont get it
why choose now to run the ball a whole drive could have started this a while ago
lamar to the edge has been there all fucking day lets do this shit bois
dont run it up the gut that shit is predictable
well thats one way to ruin my entire week
terrible fucking play call everyone expected it
fuck you greg roman
im sorry but that one wasnt on lamar we have a fourth and short and go empty backfield
4 turnovers by lamar pathetic
blame of the game on lamar 100
ran all the way up the field with big chunk runs then do a 5 wide qb draw lmao roman never fails to amaze
defense bailing the offense out again
not over yet boys
i hope lamar makes a whole bunch of yall eat a shit sandwich
steelers really to stop with all these injuries
so do we get time back on the clock from the minute he was down
we should get our time back if they need to take an injury time out
put the time back on the clock
should be an injury timeout with like 6 extra seconds
put more time back up
stop booing you fucks bad look
we should get more time
anybody elses heart beating out of their chest
we wouldve had time if they added back 5 seconds
no time added is clown shit
defenseless receiver thats a fucking penalty
the steelers make me sick
this is bullshit
refball
minkah fitzpatrick is a certified bitch fuck him
i am really sick of people turning on lamar yes hes not doing well but he is still our qb

ease up
lamar make a fucking decision bro dude is simply waiting too long
defense is playing like the 1 d rn but o is fucking up
that was an accident but still tj watt is the biggest dickhole in the league
refs almost fucked us there holy shit
anyone bashing the defense is not watching the game

the only reason pittsburgh has been in a position to score points is because of lamar period
lamar bad throw really changed this game man why do you have to throw that pick
cmon lamar defense can only bail you out so many times
lamar has killed us this game killed us
how was there no time added
fuck fitzpatrick he elbowed snead in the fucking throat
hot takes and lamar hate for a week sigh
its ok lamar played like shit the refs were waving their terrible towels all game and we still had a chance at the end

we will ruin their fucking thanksgiving
if you believe that trump add youre fucking brain dead
tj watt wasnt dirty for that play hes dirty for tackling lamar every play regardless of the action
let me see that ref on the street ill show his old ass a fucking swing
bengals beating the titans at this time think they will blow it
i literally hate our offense this season minus gus and dobbins
this offense is a dumpster fire its broken idk anymore
wow congrats refs i mean steelers
i cant believe cbs here is showing the colts and lions game instead of this one ive been mad all morning
ngakoue hype
its too early to be feeling like a playoff game lol
checking in from france lets fucking goooooooooo

and fuck the steelers
lets keep things positive all game long have faith truss
lamar man terrible
snead was open i think if lamar just looked a bit left ugh terrible start
throw was late as fuck shit decision
shit start but holy fuck how is that not roughing the passer
what kind of route tree was that
felt like a personal foul play after that tbh
shouldve came back roughing the passer after the throw
shit i thought that was another pick not seeing smart decisions
snead is sooo slow
nice play by lamar and snead
tyree is so ass lmao
ok lamar more of those please and thank you

boykin you as well
where are all the people done with boykin after a season and a half
that was a beautiful throw
they had a linebacker on him the disrespect lmao
perfect throw
lets get that pick 6 back on big ben
pick 6 on bitch ben now
i think boykin and snead heard yall talking they getting open now
dez signing lit a fire under boykins ass
peyton manning pronouncing tide makes me mad for some reason
tom brady had a pick 6 and a int in the span of like 5 min in week 1 against the saints lamar is fine
fts
lol bens pass so powerful it made ebron do a madden animation for 3 seconds
refs are giving this game to the ravens
here we goooo
i really want to shut the steelers fans up please beat their fucking asses we need this
when will wrs fucking learn you go down or you give us the ball
uh oh you friccin moron u just got

petered
humphrey gotta be a db or even lb coach for us after retirement his strips and punching mentality have caught on to the rest of the team
we still love ya 24
peters said fuck that pi call
bro humphrey sharing his notes
holy shit yessss marlons fruit punch magic rubbing off on the whole team this is the kind of game we need to play
peters knew he had to make that up lol
peters when i thought you couldnt get any dumber you go and do something like this and totally redeem yourself
theres a reason why fruit punch is a juice because it is juice man
peters getting that pi gave us like 30 yards of field position 2000 iq play there
i love how you can tell whos streaming online and whos watching on tv or listening on the radio because the people streaming were still mad about the interference call while everyone else was typing lets gooo lol
im late but your telling me boykin did something productive
24
man this feels like a classic ravenssteelers game so far maybe not as much personal heat between players so far but still closest thing to the glory days in a long time
run down their throats
phillips down had guys falling on him doesnt look good
oh man i saw that and heard him scream
anyone else having trouble finding a decent stream in addition to the fact that theyre all so delayed
so was rnfl just rsteelers all along
lamar runs are quickly becoming wastes of time
you step forward knowing there is a ton of pressure from behind and you pump fake
why did he not hit hollywood there
can we just try handing it off in the red zone next time
why is he second guessing himself so much
we get nothing from the turnover now thats the 1 ruledont turn the ball over
this feels like an old fashioned afcn slugfest my dudes
lot of hate for lamar sometimes the defense makes a play
we cant have this many turnovers if we are going to win this
silver platter twice already and were only 10 minutes in
buckle up it looks like its going to be another classic steelersravens game
lamar does that way too often dude needs to just embrace what hes good at and take off if nothing is there
why is he so hesitant to run this year
if no one hit him i think he would have just pump faked into the end zone
joker calm down you almost hurt queen
get off the field
that play call is a real testament to how the d is playing now they really just ran it for better field position for the punt and to avoid a turnover
i dont think my heart will be strong enough for this game this is simply insane
definitely gotta start doing the d some favors here and get some points
ref just took 67 yards away on that spot
win or lose hopefully theres no injuries i remember old ravens steeler games and losing the next week to bad teams because everybody was fucked up lol
lamar making audibles is fucking refreshing
we need 6 on this drive after that to pittsburgh offense wont be ass for long theyre going to wake up
why did i get hype for steelers week when i knew damn well it would be the most stressful part of the year
yall notice lamar using audibles a lot more this game
lmao were so fucked now
romo essentially pointing out how predictable our offense is
welp oline is gonna be tissue paper for the foreseeable future
fuck tj watt
watt loves injuring guys
oh that replay is hard too watch
and that is why be signed the extension before this game folks
stanleys done for the year

fuck these bitches
of course its tj watt not intentional but it would be him
rally for ronnie
behind lamar losing stanley will have the biggest negative impact on the ravens

god damn this sucks next man upalthiugh u dont think his replacement will be even half a s good as him
stanley on the golf cart thats the worst thats a season changing injury maybe
definitely think were gonna see some moves for a lineman this week but fuuuckk i hope stanley recovers soon
lamar please fucking stop
alright lamar is going to need to make quicker decisions here
wishing the best for stanley
whoever said they really wanted to see dj fluker play really just cursed stanley
defense is gonna have to win this one 100
no time to throw
are there any o lineman to trade for
last 2 passes from lamar were very risky

if boyle doesnt bat down first one its a pick second one was ill advised

3rd 18 w no stanley shouldve just ran a hb draw like the steelers did
thank god the trade deadline isnt hear yet
lamar is hesitating way to much to run this year i actually wish hed be a little quicker to take off in a lot of these situations
luckily obj is a pass blocker first and a run blocker second making him a decent option at lt
defense is strong today
at least the defense used the bye for good
ben looks like absolute shit
defense is doing what it can playing sharp offense needs to grind out long drives for at minimum fgs
look at bens play as well here weather really having an effect i think
our defense continues to be amazing if our offense cant consistently score it wont matter though
lets run for 300 yards
beautiful drive there pound the rock opens up our offence
dang does this bus stop
fuck the steelers always hitting the helmet
we just ran the ball super good without stanley interesting
wow running the ball leads to tds for an offense thats built to run glad greg finally showed up
and fuck minkah
do it for stanley
see what happens when we run the ball greg

do what your roster does well stop trying to fit square pegs into round holes
first drive all year where we actually committed to what made our offense deadly last year defense good let them rest and win
bruh we having our best run game against the best defense in the nfl
best drive of the season just pure domination all around against a great defense
has anyone notice orlando is kind of a better left tackle than right tackle
their d is gonna be gassed by the 4th
lol roman ravens ran the ball the entire drive almost and scored doing it maybe youre having an intervention
would really not like for boyle and bozeman to be coming at me
8 weeks and we finally start running and hit them with a pass 8 weeks fluker getting a chance to become a full time starter
i want to see runs on 910 first downs until they prove they can stop it fuck it give me runs on 910 second downs too unless its like 2nd 11
we need to run all fucking day i hope gus truck sticks tj watt
anybody just see that meltdown on the steelers d sideline with watt and a coach look at this clown
hahaha even tjs coach thinks hes fucking up
didnt they say tickets were randomized im not upset by it its what should happen but funny real fan dan was selected randomly
fight
judon is so dumb
humph is a dawg and i love it and mcphee just completely owned the edge right there
wow outdoing yourself judon fuck you
fuck judon
judon has been such a disappointment this year
do not resign judon
judon is an idiot like always
thats kinda bs but whatevey
terrible disqualification
judoff
brain by taco bell
never seen a ref flop before lol
he did it accidentally but its still his same old bullshit story
imagine playing under the tag and having the chance to make more money than you know what to do with and just shitting your fucking pants for the next year
fucking refball
where the steelers fans who says they gifting us flags yall offense soft af
if i had to pick a starter to lose on defense i dont know if id say judons name first but hed be close to the top lets just move on
fuck the steelers
baltimore guys are amped
the steelers are actually garbage
nfl refs are such pussies
kill ben
we need 7 more on the board before half
both qbs have fumbled now in the first half
im not able to watch much today how is yannick doing
lol 3 ravens dragging ben down like wolves taking down a wooly mammoth
alright

dont turn it over and well be fine 3 and out turnover
this definitely feels like the typical ravenssteelers game of the old and im so here for it
we def need another td before the half but also we cannot force it and give the steelers a bunch of time and the ball back
game should be 210 right now our defence doing amazing
not that relevant but i love lacie decosta feels like the teams mam been supporting elliott all week
uh oh bens arm
bens elbow is bruised he wont pass well this game
please all i ask is we score in this next drive and i can settle down come on lamar
i hate how cheap but legal pittsburgh is playing just chasing lamar all over without the ball
damn ben not your woman grabbing arm
jeeeesus lamar
lmao this game is nuts

each play is entirely too stressful
that wasnt a fumble he was just showing off
its raining lamar just like the 49ers game last year either tuck it properly or dont run
thats how ed reed used to run with the ball lol
the ball seems to be so slippery
bruh can lamar secure the ball at all today

tuck the ball
bout to start a ptsd support group for that first half
this is a long heart attack inducing game
lamar with the classic ed reed one hander
no control on the interception we got lucky
terrible throw terrible decision making he is so out of wack its unbelievable
not a pick but come on lamar
always hated joe haden even with the browns
like seeing snead being more involved
i dont think ive ever seen a team commit so many illegal formations
holy shit greg would you look at that its almost like running the ball works well for us

dobbins is looking pretty good this game hopefully he continues to get touches once ingram returns
this no 1 defense crap needs to stop pittsburghs schedule has been an abomination so far
holy shit cincinnati is up 10 on tennessee at half
these games would be unbearable without you guys to bitch and moan and stress with
love how snead pulls through when we need him
whos the best kicker now romo
see that romo
automatuck
cmon say it romo say it
did lamar just become the first qb to ever throw 2 balls on the same play
ich liebe justin tucker
goat tucker
goat tucker
jfc that 51 yarder just looked like an extra point
i love justin tucker
seriously that 1 miss in nola made me more stressed during tuckers kicks what happened
missing our rb1 lt1 rg1 judon and throwing a pick 6 who would think we would be up 10
fuck the steelers
its an ugly game but a lead is a lead
any further updates on stanley hes key to our long term goal
not entirely ravens related but my stupid ass spoke this into existence last week



idk what they talking bout over in pittsburgh this the best defense in the nfl son
real talk this game should be 240 but they keep trying to force throws at bad times when the run game is all we need
shocker big ben being a drama queen
jimmy is the master at getting no calls lol
jimmy is the king of hand fighting without a flag
jimmy does that shit every time and never gets called
havent seen marlo much all game must really be locking things down
kidney show wont last 6 episodes
why just why
lamar what the fuck
oh for fucks sake why throw
sigh wtf was that jackson but why are we calling passes anyway
jesus christ
dude what the fuck
wtf just run it damnit
lamar has 2 ints almost 3 and 2 fumbles
why are we throwing like this
no fuck why
does lamar just not look for the defensive players
unbelievable just cannot stand prosperity
what the fuck was that
unreal ffs roman run the football wtf passing too much in this wet weather is gonna get us in trouble
stop laughing about it lamar you made a shit play
pitching a shutout without the ints right now
lamar jackson single handedly keeping pitt in this
lamar has been the steelers best player
thats on lamar gro called the play but lamar made the decision under threw the ball and everything
worst possible ways to start the halves lamar dude come the fuck on
just get back to pounding the rock and we good
lamar owes us a touchdown or two
roman isnt helping but getting away from what is working however lamar is beyond reckless
this is like the bengals game except the steelers are catching lamars picks

lamar hasnt seen the field well all year idk what is going on w him
its boykin fault s
maybe

dont stop running the ball or forcing it
can someone explain why they are rekicking wasnt the first one good what the hell is the point
just pound the ball ffs stop passing it
lamar just live another down not every play needs to be a highlight your up 10 its 1st down why force it
run the ball it worked so well last half
run the ball until they stop it this is a comfortable win if we just dont turn it over
cant believe lamar has put up 31 points what a guy
lamar gets to practice against our d he should be ready for the steelers i dont care how good there d is
the worst part about the picks was the decision making wouldnt be mad if a defender made a great play
if we dont run this like 1987 nebraska style imma be pissed
god we need wrs so fucking bad lmao
missed opi then awful dpi call
that int just gutted this game this game has done a complete 180
when ravens wr did that earlier this year it was opi
these refs are a complete joke
man im gonna be pissed if we give them this game in the second half
lmao fuck the steelers fat fuck just tosses it up once every set of downs and they get the call
bullshit call
he got his head around he was fighting for the ball how is that dpi
who the fuck is bonds
its on the refs flow chart that if the steelers receiver didnt make that catch to throw a flag
here we go here comes the soft defense
we are going to lose this game at this rate
god this game is frustrating af please dont blow this shit
getting really fucking dissapointed in our team offense is in shambles for no reason defense is playing off despite the fact their longest catchthrow has come off a no call
we are generating more pressure more easily for what its worth
im in a dejected rage currently i cannot believe this game right now anything approaching acceptable qb ply and its like 313 right now
ferguson and bowser doing well after judon gets ejected
we had the momentum coming out of the half that shit evaporated quick
with judon being kicked out of the game i hope ferguson uses this opportunity to convince the staff to give him more playtime
i cant believe this shit this shouldnt even be a close game
pitt is averaging 30 per game they have given up 14 so far defense is doing a fine job
after that first half to be down right now is inexcusable
we lose this game were going to get eaten alive all week we cant lose this one
please dont abandon the run roman
if our offense doesnt answer this next drive itll be tough to come back defense is getting tired
ben played awful today too but he wasnt throwing picksfumbling constantly it cant be overstated how badly lamar has fucked the game up to this point
here comes the consecutive passing downs 3 in a row leading to another forced turnover because roman sees defecit of 1 points in 2nd half and abandons the run game

its the same every season we were a second half team now were really faltering every 2nd half this season
defense has played fine

lamar keeps giving the steelers momentum w terrible decisions bad field vision he was spectacular at both things last yr

if neither improve he will throw an interceptable pass on this drive as well
yea this is lamar worse game ever
gregory roman run the motherfuckin ball
like are the receivers not getting open or is lamar not seeing them
jesus the fumbling today
that was lucky
you just knew he would fumble that
he never had possesion stfu romo
why do ravens games give me heart attacks every sunday
lol that was an i give up play
lamar is lucky he doesnt have 4 interceptions omg
3rd and 8 and we run it up the middle
im about this turn this game off just disappointing
alright idk boys an actual nfl offense has to be capable of passing the ball greater than 10 yards multiple times a drive if we cant do that then fuck
any chance we can feed up yanda and bring him back
what is greg roman smoking
so they start the conservative playcalling after all the turnovers put us behind smart stuff where was that 2 quarters ago
this pass offense is dogshit
yall can blame whoever you want this is a total meltdown on offense no pass protection running game is gone wrs cant get open lamar holding the ball too long you just gotta hope the defense makes some plays or this is gonna get even more ugly
the problem with lamar right now is he wants to make every play at the extremes not every play has to be a highlight you dont have to wait until the very last second to make the throw
i feel so comfortable with proche and duv on special teams
orlando brown seems so lazy sometimes if he gets that kick out block thats a big play
we need adjustments on offense
lamar needs to keep his eyes up every time the pressure comes to him he looks down
our defense has to score if were gunna win lol this offense is abismal
we need this win seriously need this win
i think yanda at 150lbs or whatever he is would still be an upgrade
why is everyone running these long developing routes like get the quick passes off i didnt see a single receiver stop before the sticks
if we have no oline run screens stop trying deep routes jfc
want to see lamar be more aggressive and just run the ball he should never be getting sacked by a defensive tackle

the coverage may just dictate he has to win this game with his legs hes done it before mainly against seattle last year
ik lamar isnt playing good but the play calling is dogshit too
this sub needs a fucking wake up call regardless of the outcome in the post game thread this offense has an inept pass calling play caller at the head we have absolute scrubs at the wr position lamar is a great even fantastic qb but he has weaknesses especially in his deep passing we know this its the perfect storm for such an anemic offense that the hits to the offense line just spotlight them even more the passing game was doomed to start the season but that doesnt mean lamar isnt talented and we dont have talent in the receiving corps reality is the fo made a bet that our passing offense would take the next step and they havent
theres a deep shot
bullshit call bullshit
thats so weak refs screwing us over again today
bad call
that was a horrible call
how dare he touch the steelers refs better put a stop to that nonsense
snead lowkey putting the team on his back today
what an attempt by hollywood goddamn
that knee is in
snead is having himself a game today
fuck

lamar overthrew hollywood by just a bit

bad challenge it wont be reversed
pretty dumb that any play thats called a td on the field is automatically reviewed but you have to use a challenge on a play like that
knee came down inbounds but these refs dont like us so they wont give it to us
everyone is saying the knee but thats out the shin hits in first anyways and that counts as down
thats not getting overturned but if called a td on the field then its not getting overturned either
fuck the fucking steelers
john better be fucking vocal about this officiating not the same coach talk he says every week
that holding call on skura was so bs
hollywoooooooooooooooooood
was he knee in that time
ive said this a million times but ive never seen a worse called game they made us score 3 tds before we got one they couldnt make some excuse for
suck his dick bitch give him his praise now u cowards
did lamar redeem himself on that drive
that was a tough but amazingly clutch drive
lets get a punch out from 44 and put this game away
refs tried so hard to deny us a td this drive 2v1
i need romo to say tucker the fucking goat mr automatic
im starting to think dez doesnt have to be that good to make a different on this offense
bonds fucked up just now man
this is bonds last game foh
fuck verizon fios mandatory software update on the tv box in the middle of the game
take bonds outt
38 fucked up two plays in a row who is this clown
wish this bonds took peds
these refs are fucking giving it to them at this point
just like the eagles game we are giving the steelers so much with penalties
refs player of the game
whats the point of having a defender on these receivers what can they do that wont get a flag thrown
im over these bullshit dpi calls
we just have to realize that the refs will always favor the steelers
most bs refd game ive seen this season
the ref ball continues
what is worse this drive the penalties or the tackling
what the fuck
head hunt the refs every shitty call gets a blow up
greg you better not get cutesy on this next drive jesus fucking christ
man that was some horseshit bs on marlon a minute ago
well lamar is due a game winning comeback in his career will it be today we shall see
time for lamar to show everyone he can lead a game winning drive and shut everyone up were gonna be hearing it for weeks if not
keen for a lamar td winning drive here
call of duty black ops cold war elite division special tactical unit american freedom fighters super cash grab xviiii
100 yards in penalties and 3 turnovers hard to win any game that way its crazy were still in it
im just waiting for the flags at this point
edwards making roman look like a buffoon for barely using him against the titans last year
the silver lining here is the run game has hit its stride
we run the ball and are getting down the field hm
man the combo of gus and jk is so nasty and its just getting started
for the love of god dont get cute now
gusdobbins should be our 12 dont me
dont score too fast
i love u gus and dobbins
i love running the ball
feed jk and bus
mark ingram isnt playing and we are playing a top 3 defense in the nfl and we are having probably our best running game of this season very impressive
boy not injured just trying to give his guys a break
dobbins is the real deal hes going to have to become the number 1 guy sooner rather than later

great feet and perfectly fits the system being so accustomed to running out of the shotgun
guarantee he is faking that
gotta go for it no question
go for it
no we wouldnt kick it we would go for it
everyone raise your hands up give lamar your energy
we have to go for it here
i have a horrible feeling about this
this is where the big boys make plays
my heart
theyre going to send everything at lamar and pray he sidearms it to the ground
fuck me man this shit is making my heart pump like im running or something
well there it is lamar single handedly lost this game
what a horrible play call how do you not have anyone in the backfield jesus fucking christ that is trash
what a dumb fucking play greg puts together that beautiful drive and in true greg fashion completely shits the fucking bed on the final calls
my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
suicide watch
lamar lost the game
easily had this game wo stupid fucking turnovers
bad offensive performance bad coaching bad luck with refs
no false start on 89
legit angry at this seriously
literally the same shit 4th down call we failed twice vs the titans
3rd and 5 should be 2 runs to runningsbacks
this game feels like the kyle boller days
queen is gonna be a monster we always nail our 1st roundersexcept perriman
prediction lamar will throw a 45 yard td to hollywood that will get called back because of a penalty
lol cool lamar whos played like utter ass today and greg roman with no timeouts have to drive for a touchdown to win it
td to hollywood incoming
i dont believe but shit i might start praying
time back on the clock
they should put time back on
injury timeout should return some time back
hope heyward is good hes a great player would hope this isnt too serious
add time to the clock cmon refs
stop booing
bro thats horseshit we should have more time
flag
why no time added
thats fucking pi
roman and lamar ended up costing the ravens the win tbh

lamar through the first 3 qs and roman in the 4th
wr was wide open on the outside
did everything possible to hand the game away
from mvp to liability overnight
lamar needs to wake the fuck up
lamar is making rookie season mistakes that we did not see last year i truly dont understand the regression
lamar is not playing well some questionable throws very indecisive
ravens are going to have to slowly run out the clock second half

use the time of possession calm down stop fighting stop being stupid and patients kill time
big ben more like fat ben
lamar jackson 1417 baltimore ravena
we should have a sizable lead with gus and dobbins running it down their fucking throats lamar is fucking us no way around it
lamar has looked hot and cold all season the bad thing ishe is more cold than hot
lamar could easily lead the league in picks this year if nor for all tge dropped ones thats scary
truth is defense has been great our offense is not playing like a playoff level team
this sub is going to try hard to blame the defense for the loss despite lamar looking like a rookie
dude said biden is a marxist lmaooo
why didnt we get more time
how is that not pi on 31
trying to calm down after this one we ran the ball down their goddamn throats and held their offense in check lamar had a couple of bad picks that gifted them 14 were still 5 and 2 and dobbins looks like a great pick now fuck the steelers and fuck the refs we are coming for them on turkey day

in any event yall need to stop talking trash about lamar i know hes playing poorly this game but hes certainly not trash
lamars regressed plain and simple
lamar really just laughed that off not sure if thats what i wanna see after such a bone head choice
not a fan of lamars attitude after that 2nd pick totally changed the momentum of the game while lamar laughed it off

its like this season he doesnt have the sb or bust mentality like he had last year
lamar is playing terribly to romos point that drive couldve been game

all three of his turnovers have been abysmal and a breakdown on fundamentals throwing late holding onto the ball way too long lofting one straight to a defender

he has regressed so fucking hard from last year
refs were trash but lamar put them in this game loss is completely on him
just throw the damn ball away stop forcing shit
fuck tj watt
fuck tj watt
matthew judon has got to fucking go
i honestly like judon more now fuck the steelers
judon gets way too much hate in this sub he wasnt swinging at the ref
our production without stanley playing has been very comforting
lamar is losing this game singlehanded
lmao at you guys blaming roman roman doesnt tell lamar to throw the ball straight at the defense if its a bad playcall he shouldnt be throwing it
the winloss doesnt matter today if lamars decision making and field vision both of which were fantastic last yr dont improve the ravens wont do anything of note in january

he played this exact same way against cincy it didnt burn the ravens in that game but is burning them now
fuck you refs

seriously fuck you
lamar is directly responsible for 14 of their points and losing at least 3 with the to in the redzone not good enough
make winks the oc too
this feels just like the chiefs game

lamar is playing weird
play calling is sketchy
defense is holding up as best as it can but its beginning to break
and dont forget how we love getting flags thrown on every drive

cant beat a team and the refs it is what it is
lamar lost this fucking game him and romans shit playcalling
expecting the refs to make the correct call that would benefit the ravens is insane everything theyve done today has helped the steelers
steelers didnt even play that well tbh gave them 14 points off lamar and 200 penalty yards smh
hit on a defenseless reciever
this game is on lamar
refs sucked hard
my
is it just me or is the network only talking squealers

go ahead ignore the ravens we gonna win
we get romo
fuck the steelers front 7 ours is better
fuck steelers say it for good luck
looks about the attendance of an orioles game pre pandemic
x200b

guess were going to blame the lamar jackson pick 6 on the rain and ball being wet
oh itll be one of these days huh
shake it off
well there goes our running game
fucking hell lamar
lamar what a shit play
lamar maybe relax learn to fucking relax
the good news is this gives two things the chance to come back from behind and fix that narrative and help build the narrative the steelers cant hold a lead lets fucking goooo
now were fucked the runs about to be abandoned
were gonna have to hear about that play all fuckin day arent we
were behind say goodbye to the run game
x200b

you cant do that late hit on jackson from fitzpatrick
bailout ill take it
x200b

refs are going to call that allday thanks minkah
not this illegal formation bullshit again
snead stepping up
o line is crushing lamar literally
wow boykin looked surprised he even caught one
boykins caught it
boykin whoa
what a throw
they must have just locked boykin in the bank over the bye
lets go boys
such a perfectly timed pass
woot woot
what a throw wow
finally a nice throw
looks like boykin took all the negative talk about him personal this week
the ravens should cut boykin
what a fucking bounce back play from behind after an opening drive pick 6 amazing lamar baby
lets fucking go defense i have so much fucking faith
boykin see dez watching he gotta show out today
boykin redemption tour leggo
boykin did what over the bye weak lol good shit
its actually dez wearing boykins jersey theyre trying to throw off the scouting report
beautiful drive

we going to get a marlon turnover i can feel it
boykin got scared into playing good
great drive roman is still getting too cute on some of the runs glad we put a string of plays together lamar going through progressions again
dez lighting a fire under boykins ass
our dline is fucking huge and tips a lot of balls big ben throws more balls near the los than any other qb anybody else smell a tipped int or 2
god fucking damn rnfl is fucking disgusting saying refs gave us that down
i think they found the whitest guy in america for that trump ad
fuck ben lets fucking go defense
yannick fast as fuck
so its gonna be a ref bailout type of game
yes we stole it back
juiceman
fruit punch
they love their crabcakes and they love their strip fumbles
all pro for a reason
man my stream is way behind yalls lol see yall at half time
woooow peters aint playing today boyyyyyyyyy thats a bad man
did the refs force that fumble rnfl
just when i think you couldnt possibly be any dumber you go and do something like this and totally redeem yourself
juice punch
that is peters 101 gives a lot takes a lot
peters and humphrey the best duo in the league
lets capitalize plz
i heard him scream
its pretty encouraging how well the interior run is doing
imagine thinking the nfl would want to cheat for the ravens over the steelers they make way more money for the nfl than we do lol
what a fucking waste
its gonna be this type of game huh lol
gunna be one of those games thats for sure
throw the ball away good lord
fucking run it man jfc
run the ball with the running backs that got you there lamar keeper and a shitty pass play come on
you simply cant pump fake 4 times in the nfl he needs to play smarter
cmon now that was a fantastic drive pocket awareness please
man 2 tos already now we gotta come back on defense and make a play
should have just ran it holy crap
we can still win this game but damn for every lamar highlight this season he puts out at least 2 lowlights
wish wed just run downhill at them when we got inside the 10
people saying why not run there were 2 steelers right in front of him
look at the positivewere moving the ball well against their defense but theyre getting to him
well that one year of great offense sure was fun
why the fuck is lamar so nervous calm tnhe fuck down
fucking delay of game
lamar just trying to do too much right now needs to be more careful for the rest of this game
jimmy ole reliable
thats a great stand after the turnover
nice tackling by beans
defense still playing so good i dont want to go back to when our defense carried us
awful punt lmao
great stop

our defense is playing hyped up i fucking love it
steelers playing scared on 3rd down ya love to see it
theyre not getting yac on us we dont let that shit happen
can already see yannicks impact hes definitely drawing attention and creating havoc
steelers playing on offense like theyre scared of us

if lamar co can get their head out of their ass well be good to go
didnt that ball bounce out close to the 50
man 2 turnovers from lamar in 3 drives 1 td as well but

just dont turn it over on this possession field position is good id take a freaking 3 and out over a turnover
who said gus bus cant go east west
no please not stanley
please just a sprain please just a sprain
fuck that is the worst possible injury fuck
god help us please jesus with ronnie
hes in too much pain this is bad fuck
this is bad this is really really bad
nooooooooo i blame roman garbage fucking play call
that looks like his season that sucks
that is one of the worst players we could have go down
wtf dude fuck his ankle is broken
oh wow like i needed another reason to fucking hate tj watt
so tj watt just broke stanleys ankle that fucking destroys us unbelievable
wait in the middle of all this lamar actually did get that pass off should have been an incomplete
hes out for the season
edc has a lot of work to do this week
fuck sakes why does something bad have to happen every 2 min
michael scott face this is the worst
this is going to show the crowd that said let stanley walk how wrong they are
right after he signs his contract why does that keep happening
shit on tj for his intentional play not his accidents
bro my fucking soul watching him in the cart
couldnt we have done a go fund me and pay lamar whatever he would have made for him to not do the madden cover
gotta trade for a lineman now fuck man this sucks
lamar is trying too hard to get the ball out a little bit too often today id rather have the sack than a throw like that even if it was completed
its gonna be a fucked up game now unless the defense can carry us
losing stanley much worse than losing this game and this is probably the most important game of the season
really hope stanley isnt out for the year besides lamar hes the most important piece on the offense ugh very very bad news
at least were getting more pressure today
can we play a bit more aggressively now lets blitz and get some pressure on ben
i like our d
shoutout to wink playing tight press almost every play
great job defense
the amount of people in this thread saying the season is over is too damn high
deshaun has all these nextgen stats and hes 16
the ravens right guard was engaged in a block then had his right leg rolled up on the two worries are for an mcl sprain versus a high ankle sprain at this point we find it very unlikely for him to return today

ronnie stanley just signed a 5year 9875 million extension and appeared to get seriously injured today we believe he suffered a left ankle fracture dislocation after being engaged in a block and getting rolled up on from behind he should be able to return by week 1 next season but his 2020 season is undeniably over by video the whole ankle and foot were trapped and turned outwards similar to dak prescotts injury minus the open component of the injury the ravens lost lt stanley and rg tyre phillips both in the first quarter today

from profootballdoc website
run all day
this bus has no brakes

beep beep motherfucker
almost like running the ball works incoming 20 pass plays
yes please run the dang ball make them stop us
see what happens when you run the ball
gus hates the fucking steelers
now we pound frustrating it took 8 weeks to realise this
crazy how electric our offense looks when you actually stick to our guns
that run looked meh but it still got 4
so waitrunning makes it easier to pass whoda thunk it
that was an incredible hit to stop lj from scoring
that was the toughest shot lamar has ever taken
i hope we get to keep gus
llama it hurts me when you take these shots
lamar is taking some shots today
no stupid bullshit from roman do what you do best until they take it away make them take it away
what a statement drive proud of our guys to go out there with two backups in smash them in the mouth and pound the ball down the field
no call on the helmet to helmet
feels like if we fully committed to the run this game we would be up 21 hope roman realizes that too
i think after the offense looked off cause they tried to make it a little more traditional after ronnie went down the coaching staff said fuck it were just gonna play like last year
i hate to say it but i think ingram might be rb3
greg roman figured out playing a team to its strengths lol
gus wanted it way more than 41

what a fucking beast
all i can say is fuck the steelers dirty fucking team
and thats what a ravens offense is supposed to fucking look

now comes the impossible task of greg roman not trying to get away from a winning running game
fuck yeah open up the pass with them long schlong runs
brown bullied hayward right there you love to see it
with a steady run game like that we can do enough to beat the steelers with our defense really hoping we can snag this win for stanley
it took him three games and our left tackle going down but greg finally figured out how to call plays for a drive
that drive is the 1 reason i never get why we abandon the run we average net per rush as many as some teams do passing we are run of the few teams that can bust one or consistently run for 5 yards
ben is fucking washed
no hate but joe haden looks like a keeblers elf
tj spear the knee watt
fuck the steelers
amazing job by mcphee there setting the edge
nice hustle by ngakoue to make that previous stop
penalties on both sides is the only reasonable option here
judons contract is in jeopardy
chuck clark out there breaking things up really love his presence on this team
classic matt judon
fucking soft ass refs
as ive said before judon is a loose cannon
bullshit call
i cant wait to get rid of judon
hes judone
dont really agree with that call but judon has to be more disciplined
did the ref just flop
another week of refball i guess
thats kinda bs but maybe well trade him for a guard and pick
judon was jerking his arm free and accidentally hit the ref however i understand why they took him out just like that 3 starters gone
that ejection of judos was weak he didnt come touch an official on purpose
yall that was bullshit im not mad at judon
chris board with a ff
ben sackedburger
good ole ravenssteelers game mostly defense multiple turnovers
this game has been so entertaining i cant believe theres still 5 minutes left in the quarter
get off the fucking field
d is playing lights out lets get a long rushing drive with points here plz
ringo ringo ringo guys they are fucking blitzing to the right



ravens yes
the only thing you did by ejecting judon is making it more cut throat dumbest fing call judons play aside that was so fing egregious
lol i thought biden said im joe flacco and i approve
pro football doc just said they believe ronnie suffered a left ankle fracture dislocation and is done for the year

not official but bad news
this game reminds me of the late 2000s early 2010s ravenssteelers games smash mouth football every yard is hard fought and the intensity is turned way up i love it
ps fuck the steelers
gotta keep that elbow good for thanksgiving ben cant go another year without being able to use it for dinner
the worst part about being an afc fan is having to watch the awful cbs commercials for shows that wont last longer than 1 season
holy shit that scared me
this is the number one rush defense holy hell they could give up over 200 yards before its all said and done today
rnfl would have had a field day if he lost that lmao
holy ghost knocked that ball out
why does lamar hold the ball like that instead of clutching it at his chest like other runners
did i just hear romo say gus is banged up
i hope gus is ok
fortunately thats a drop
wait did he drop it lets fucking goooo
thats not a pick
roman run the fucking ball they arent stopping it
come on lamar this is bad you are regressing in the passing game man
that clearly hit the ground but they fucked us the same way last year so idk
man not gonna lie though that was a beautiful play by haden
x200b

x200b

x200b

what is going on with lamar jackson

x200b

that was another close call
just run the clock
2019 lamar and 2020 lamar are like two completely different players
that wasnt really on lamar or boykin pass got tipped at the line
ravens are the only team in the league that doesnt run slant routes i swear
lol well at least lamars run game is on today
orlando brown the wrecking ball holy shit
presnap penalties have been below average this year
jk dobbins makes me happy
gus and dobbins are such an amazong combo
dobbins gets hit and just falls forward for six more yards
get out of pittsburghs ass nantz
dobbins out there doing a great job
damn that was a quick snap professional as hell
refs almost cost us three there
stop the clock i hate when they blow the play dead early
good from fucking 70 man
legatron
the ravens held the ball for 20 minutes that half i like that
weve dominated this game without the turnovers wed be up by more
fuck the steelers bro
i keep that tuck 9 wit me
say it romo
tucker is a golden god a finisher kicker
0 points given up in the 1st half
in tucker we trust
fuck the steelers and the refs
lol u guys see how they tried to cheat us
hollywood with 0 receptions is a bit concerning
717 lets go boys we got this
bens getting picked off if he trys to open this thing up bill
tyre phillips has been ruled out with an ankle injury

2 ankle injuries to our ol so far
wow ben is fine what a shocker
ok lets not let juju get that wide open again
i feel so bad for nfl players imagine having to answer the same stupid questions from reporters for an entire career it starts with possessing the ball yeah you need to have the ball to score thanks
great no call
jimmy smith has really played well so far this season
stiller calling for the flag before the ball is even in the area also uncatchable
jimmy wanted some butt
jimmy smith playing lights out
what is romo talking about that was like nothing
not gonna get a flag trying to sell it that hard
need a 9minute td drive here and then let the defense close it out
steelers just praying for flags because they got shit for offense
romo doesnt know the definition of grab
he had a little hold at the beginning but the rest was just blanket coverage
ben is literally just going for pi calls corners have to play smarter those throws arent even remotely in play
deep hollywood bomb coming soon
doesnt matter that were not getting turnoverssacks caz they cant move the ball
jfc lamar
son of a bitch
run the ball what are we doing
y
anyone remember getting downvoted for saying lamar looks absolutely off this year
terrible decision absolutely brutal
what the fuck was that
what the fuck are you doing lamar
lamar throws 2 ints and sitting on the bench laughing his ass off
god i dont know whats happened to lamar he just isnt even making good throws
i was pretty sure lamar would get on track but im officially in the cautiously worried camp now
run the fucking ball
that wasnt even romans fault why did he even throw that
these plays are such common sense things and why we let them hang in
laughable
i know the numbers are bad but lamar seems to be regressing in awareness
lamar is too lackadaisical sometimes i get that he gets away with shit like crazy but still its like dude just play smart
im starting to get pissed
i swear to god if we keep passing
up 2 scores need to eat the clock ran like 170ish yards in the first half stops running the ball
fucking embarrassing lamar has been pittsburghs best player today
fucking stupid all the momentum back to shitsburgh
lamar dude what the fuck
wtf lamar
might as well call that a pick 6
lamar singlehandedly keeping the steelers in this game
x200b

lamar jackson get your sht together
lamar has been shit today call it like it is
why is he laughing on the sideline
im sorry lamar cant throw its not a bad thing but just run the football god dammit
just run the fucking ball jfc we literally have scored for them
lamar is keeping the steelers in this
lamar with a bad pass

defense somehow tops that with no one even close to the receiver
lol all we had to do was take care of the football
if we blow this game itll change our entire season
why tf is this taking so long
jesus fuck either kick it or dont
can we stop giving them points ffs
run the ball run the ball run the ball run the ball
ive havent been able to really watch the game today but from what i can tell lamar seems to be playing poorly the question is whether this is because he has regressed or the steelers d is really good however based on recent trends im inclined to believe the regression narrative
goddamn can we stop falling on our lineman this game is terrifying
3rd and 5 run it again
f this game man fr
reminder that this gross incompetence is coming off a bye at home
lj was a better passer last year
lamar has been the steelers best offensive player
why the fuck is that not a call
they are both hand fighting thats fucking horse shit
weak call
this game is starting to frustrate me
nah these refs are the dumbest fucks ever
phishing for flags
push offs dont exist anymore and apparently anything a defender does to an uncatchable pass is dpi

refball 2020
wtf mccloud literally threw bonds to the ground
it would be so fucking nice to collapse a pocket one time


edit ayyy
ferguson did a great job of getting that sack
sometimes we take the worst fucking pursuit angles
holding like mofo no call
god i hate prevent defense
lamar has got to wake up
ferguson has stepped up take notes judon
ferguson has been a low key beast this year
this is just fucking pointless

why do we always have these periods of time in games where everything is totally inept
truly shameful how weve blown this game up 717 its sad man
and the ravens now trail pittsburgh in baltimore
fuck this game i need to get drunk
if i see one more baker commercial
give dobbins the fucking ball
why dont we just cut our receivers and line up 4 additional linemen
the steelers have made less mistakes thats why they are winningahand lamar jackson trash performance also
i dont know how the defense can be blamed here thats the worst drive theyve had all game but poor decisions on offense is what gets you here
lamar cant throw the ball pitt cant stop the run roman 5 step drop
jesus christ
gotta get hollywood and duvernay involved
3 fumbles and 2 picks after a bye weeknot good
roman has to do better
3rd and 8 and thats what we do
a qb run on 3rd and 8 okay roman you do you
did hill not want to take a hit there this is sad
this is on lamar and his turnovers
our o line is going to be a big problem now
fucking pathetic
3rd abd 8 trailing run
whole home fuckifier
the playcalling is absurd right now
everybody gonna blame the refs or injuries we need to man the fuck up here
i remember before the season started how we heard ingram say lamar was a million times ahead of last year heard lamar and hollywood really worked on their connection etc hollywood is a nonfactor this season lamar has not been good since week 1 this is so damn frustrating to watch
ben getting wayyy too much time
romo needs to chill

awwhuhhhagghhgahhh
seeing a terp player in a steelers jersey is kinda disgusting
worst we looked off a bye in a long time
id like the mvp to show up now please
nice adjustment by wink your turn greg
our defense has literally had like 1 bad drive our offense is the whole reason were down
if we could not keep leaving watt as the read man that would be ideal
you right lamar trying to do to much but he shouldnt be in the position
steelers have made some nice adjustments against our running game this half since we cant throw either its hard to imagine how we come back here
lamar hasnt been good today but romans play calling hasnt been putting him in a good position
perfect time to play like shit
we have no pass game at all
we could use a possession receiver boykin is ok but he reminds me of a relief receiver more than a consistent starter allan robinson shouldve been an option
were not winning this game with this offense
i love roman going 5 wide with nobody helping chip lets allow a really good pash rush to not have to hesitate with rpo or play action
why is that our 2nd and 8 play call to drives in a row with 2 starting passing offensive linemen out of the game
great catch duvernay woo
holy shit wtf was that was that a competent executed pass play
ok that was a sexy throw also for the people saying we need more plays to duvernay drink up boys
this is an option as well
give duvernay more reps hes at least shown signs of life
where was the hold
fuck the refs so much
wtf refs
he didnt touch him pnfaoooooo
that was soft af
refs suddenly remember holding is supposed to be a penalty at the wrong time
and the holding is where
of all the plays to call holding watch a chiefs game for god sake
that may have been the weakest holding call ive ever seen
they dont call holding this year
phantom fucking penalty justice straight away
someone tell fitzpatrick to shut his mouth
steelers be like but the refs

as they get all the help from them all game fucking shit
i dont know bad challenge here
x200b

i dont think that was a touchdown but hey at his point we have nothing to lose and everything to gain by challenging the call
wow that right knee left a mark that looked like it was in bounds
right knee was down
lamar made that harder than it should have been
refs unlikely to overturn the call its too close
his left foot might have barely touched his knee might have hit in but its sooooooo close i cant be too mad if they dont overturn this tbh
i generally like the romonantz squad on commentary but theyve been infuriating today
there is a less than zero chance this gets overturned
i hate these refs man i hate them
dez is here less thank a week and were already being called for incompletes in the endzone
when is it our turn to get hometown calls i swear every home game we get flagged more than the opposition
losing this timeout is gonna come back to bite us somehow
oh my god a touchdown
karma bitches
review that bitch
i really hate those roll out plays on the goal line but it worked
had to get 3 tds to score once
lets go hollywood
get in bitch
wow refs cant take away the 3rd td eh
from behind with some running and some passing that is a good drive qbs have off days being able to come back is the key thing aaron rodgers started with a pick 6 against tampa a couple weeks back and didnt bounce back as well as lamar has twice this game now
yea suck it easy lamar haters hide you cowards
we got in the endzone 3 times that drive
that drive we overcame 3rd and 14 and 2nd and 22 this game is too close for my heart
defense please make my day
we got the momentum back lets carry that over to the defense we had in the first half
fuck everybody that was talking like the game was over already
fuck the steelers
great td but damn i wish that rushing td stood kind of like that one touchdown against the browns a few years ago that got called back
steelers and refs couldnt stop the ravens on that drive
its not over yet keep the pressure on burn the clock very winnable
if they call a roughing the passer i stg
i wouldve lost my shit theyve been doing that to lamar all game
this ref is a steelers fan jesus christ he isnt even hiding it
38 gotta go
look i appreciate the sean connery tribute but can we please get mr bonds off the field
38 is giving me unpleasant melvin flashbacks
please stop taking penalties
who the fuck is bonds and why is he allowed to play dude looks beyond fucking awful
who tf is bonds ive literally never heard this dudes name and hes getting picked on
bonds is booty but that was on chuck guys lol
that was chuck clark not bonds was the right call
absolutely have to hold them to a fg at the very least
how in the world did pittsburgh end up with such an easy schedule
refs doing anything to keep them in the game
these refs are so onesided lol
over 100 yards in penalties come the fuck on
steelers need to get bailed out but their fans consistently bitch about the refs
defense is absolutely gassed after having to carry our anaemic offense
i dont blame the refs i blame our undisciplined ass fucking defence that has been doing this all fucking year so far
show a damn replay
head hunt the refs
this game should be 724
fuck refball
first half what is a forward pass

second half how does one tackle
fuck claypool the little smug bastard
they better pound the fucking rock
come on 6 min td drive to cap it
loving these runs so far
this drive has last years ravens all over it the fun creative plays that keep the defense guessing welcome back greg you fuck
dobbins is a beast
dobbins lowkey with a near 100 yard game
gus
beep beep bitch
boyle plastered that mf
first 100 yard game for jk congratz heres to many more
this game is giving me a heart attack
69 plays nice
dobbins you can have my first born son
roman finally understood that passing is not our thing

unleash him

dobbins is a free elf
if they had just done this maybe 57 more times theyre up two tds right now whyyyyyyyyyy
jk remind me of dalvin cook
we are so close keep a cool head offense
of course you go for it
what the fuck are we waiting for
this rivalry is going to give me a heart attack one of these days
ugh wish he tried to bounce outside some space would have at least gotten 2 yards anyway 4th and 3 let me guess refs will decide this
yeah that was horrible game over
i cant believe we handed them this game
worst fucking play call
greg roman turned back into a pumpkin hate to see it
cant really understand why you got empty there


oh well next time in pittsburgh
we didnt deserve to win we genuinely aint doing shit this season if this is our fucking game plan after a bye week
fire roman immediately
this pistol college offense from roman is not sustainable weve cut down on qb runs good but the pass concepts are too mediocre
thats a pathetic play call
i mean what about maybe running that option play that worked like 5 straight times
that play call was pathetic roman completely bit on what the steelers wanted us to do
4 turnovers of course we lose

to only lose by 4 after spotting them 14 is wild in itself between that and the penalties the ravens beat themselves today
still got a chance
now we need a miracle
this aint over but im not confident unless they blow a coverage again
queen lfg
time to see if lamar has the clutch gene
punt return td incoming big truss
i called it with the challenge coming back to fuck us now we have no timeouts and they ran 45 seconds off the clock
this is where we see what lamar is made of
if jackson throws an int or takes a sack im rioting
the line cant hold long enough for deep shots to form
it almost always comes down to the last two minutes in baltimore
this offense needs something up 177 at half we should have never been in this position
oh yeah lets throw in the middle of the field with no timeouts jfc
lets fucking goooooo we got a chance
that injury will give us time back on the clock right
ravens should have atleast 15 seconds
give us more time then
my ass just took a giant bite out of my couch
time should be back in the clock
willie snead iv 106 yards today
wtf why no time added
wtf we should have gotten time back
we should of gotten more time
no time added why
robbed fucking clock mistake
should have had another play with that clock
watt took out our 100m man trying to dive on the pile after the whistle
i literally cant take watching another its on me guys signal from lamar after throw a terrible pass to the other team omg
we are 1st in rushing 27th in passing can we play to our strengths
fire dean pees
ive seen us play from behind enough to know this games over lol
bruh some of yall gave up after 1 fucking play
fuck tj watt
it looked like a high ankle sprain to me guys those are incredibly painful and you cant really put weight on your foot i didnt see the ankle snap

could be wrong im trying to be optimistic here
i hate judon so fucking much lol such an enormous waste of money for little production and stupid penalties galore
man this sub is so wishy washy one second lamar is the greatest the next theyre calling for his head calm down people
i have no idea whats been wrong with lamar this year im genuinely starting to get concerned hes just been careless we could be up 240 right now if he hasnt been so garbage
jesus sub 50 with two ints thats awful
these refs can kiss my dick obvious steeler fans
i love lj but he really just gave the steelers the game
man i love lamar but this performance isnt it i hope he improves the rest of the season but as it is right now i would be pretty upset if he gets a massive contract extension this offseason
i see our offense has used the bye week to do absolutely fucking nothing
lamar has complete garbage body language at times man the fuck up and get going
knee was in
genuinely fire greg roman out of a fucking cannon
so this game is all lamars fault honestly
they got handed the game by the refs
not even a fucking rrplay fucking joke of a league im so donr
they didnt put any time on the clock and let that helmet to helmet go
fuck tj watt douche bag

every bandwagon steelers fan can fuck off fuck that backwards ass city and the entire organization burn in hell burn in hell
fuck trump
how is watt dirty for that he went in backwards
watt didnt hurt stanley on purpose but it was completely fucking reckless and unnecessary so yea fuck him
theres really nothing the apologists can say lamar has more bad games this season than he has good ones he needs to turn this shit around right fucking quick
thread is hilarious lamar is keeping steelers in there but he is also the reason are run game is working
dude tony romo literally never has good things to say about the ravens ever like fuck you dude
fuck this trump commercial
fuck trump
soooo can we criticize this team now or would that still make me a fair weather bandwagon fan
fuck you greg roman just fuck you 49ers fans warned us
classless fans booing here
browns fan just wanted to come in here and say fuck the steelers goodbye
im on edge over here boys this ones going to come down to the wire
2 turnovers by lamar in the first quarter not a good start
that was a vintage flacco moment lmao
tj watt can suck my left nut
watt too wreckless and fucking stupid to even make a simple tackle on a guy not moving dumb shit go to hell
who do you want lamar to throw to nobody is open lol
hopefully minkah gets fined for that shit
if ben took the hit lamar took on that last drive he would be rolling around on the ground for 5 minutes being dramatic
pussy ass pittsburgh steelers
ill say it again this feels like the 2004 team the only saving grace is the qb is much better and our schedule is easier
free my man judon
that wasnt a grab romo chill
21 points all on lamars shoulders

boykin will somehow get blamed for it
we should be up fucking 20 if our offense wasnt fucking garbage
yeah we have like 150 rushing yards in a half but no lets continue to throw literally spotted these fuckers 14 points
wheres our wr1 at hollywood sighting anybody
not sure if im missing something but can lamar just not throw a pass 25 yards he did it last season so what gives we know he can the play calling has no creativity id rather we lose and be experimental and creative than try to win with short passes and not utilising our run game enough
man fuck all the people here acting like those of us worried about how poorly lamar is playing is us bitching

this game could have been put the fuck away
as fucking shit as lamar has been this interior offensive line has done him zero favours today nor have the receivers
im so hyped this game is almost over
lamar looking really bad in the pocket
im not just blaming lamar im blaming oline receivers not being open receivers dropping balls at times greg romans awful playcalling and coaching the whole offense has been out of sync this season and no 1 players to blame
why are so many of you so negative if you guys keep saying were done were done we lost when its only a 1 score game yall shouldnt be ravens fans
that wasnt lamars fault that time gregs to blame
bengals fan coming in peace to say im rooting for you guys fuck the steelers
fuck these bitch ass steelers
honestly i think we played better than we have in tough close situations im mad but im really not that mad like i was with the titans game
be loud flock rock that bank
lets freakinnnnnn gooooooooooooooo
everyone picking us to lose
i can hear fans
say that again defending twotime afc north champions
nerves going crazy
refs better call late hits to qb remember how steelers drilled rg3 after handoffs last year
how has no one invented a rain blocking force field for open roof stadiums
we need to go out and catch a body today tbh
lets get the gus bus and dobbins goin early
guarantee harbaugh and tomlin were talking about trash ohio pro football is
dez with the bape mask
man yannick looks fucking dialed in already for this rivalry
jesus dude
that was a terrible pass jesus christ he wasnt even disguising the coverage
is it roman or lamar but we have regressed offensively
lol yeah that should have been roughing
ooof now we dont have scapegoat boykin this was all on lamar
thats on lamar thats a simple read he fucked up
lamar just isnt seeing the field as well as he did last yr especially out of empty

he has to see spillane rotating there he just has to

oh well
stop trying to turn lamar into fucking russell wilson he is not a consistently good passer fucking period

if the goal is to win we need to go to our strengths establishing the run and mix in passing when needed
their clearly trying to injure lamar lol
i think it was a late hit with heward he was going out
dirty ass steelers fuck em
will take it
like how is it not unnecessary roughness to twist a players legs after he hands the ball off wtf
a defense committing a dumb penalty on 3rd and not the ravens
my husband just asked if im going to make my traditional game day bloody mary because he thinks im going to need it
pick sixes 15 yarders ravens steelers football
the need for snead
sneed needs to get the molasses out of his knees
phillips has got to go
snead is such an enigma a 23 that has flashes of looking like a legitimate 1 every season
boykin lets fucking go
dear lord that was perfectly placed
boykin is feeding off that dez energy today
i am so fucking sick of watching a greg roman offense
solid bounce back
touchdown
boykin decided to put glue on his hands instead of concrete
omg its tied now we arent winning by 50 its over
thats what i am talking about
boykin making amends i see
what a fucking throw
lmao lamar was so mad at phillips you could hear him haha
get a stop here and its like the pick six never happened
great route and catch boykin thats what i like to see
that pass was gorgeous makes my pp tingle
alright boykin thats how to keep dez off the field
nice back to good old ravens football battling against the steelers transcends generations
suck my dick bitch
boykin had a real good drive
i want to see us pop big ben a few times after all those hits on lamar
feels great to see boykin get that under his belt sorry i ever doubted you buddy
hard to kill jobs that dont exist
need to see someone smack watt and dupree in the mouth cant keep letting them hit lamar late on the option plays

i hope we draft some nasty sob lineman next year
thats how you fucking bounce back
steelers fans really came here bitching about refs can we please ban them do that bellyaching shit in your own sub
time to rough up ben
kill fat ben
the way that guy staggered backwards after the ball bounced off his knee was pure comedy
that was elite athleticism out of ebron
uncatchable
so much talking on the field i love it
uncatchable yo
he was holding the jersey but the ball was uncatchable weak call
theyre gonna call a tugged jersey pi
welcome to the peanut gallery
ball dont lie
insanely bad call
fuck this fake ass league
we are too damn good at generating turnovers
peters been watching marlon film
way to fucking go juice man
refs are giving the ravens this game lmao ok
peters redeemed himself
mp juice punch
chase claypool the next great steelers wr
peters learning the marlo punch
this team forces fumbles like no team ive ever seen
bullcrap call on petersbut we got a fumble
juice maaaaane
as a canadian i hate that chase mapletron claypool is on the steelers id love to root for him but i cant
if the refs arent going to help peters with that call hell just do it himself
lamepool
fuck these refs and fuck the steelers lfg
phenomenal play by peters
these punches be contagious
karma for a horribly tacky pi call on an uncatchable ball that ref should be under review for that shit
bs call on peters then comes back with that shit hell yeah our boys are dawgs
marlon mustve shared his how to guide on forcing fumbles
fuck
the
fucking
steelers
saw that right away looks like his legknee got a gus bus rammed into the back of it
fuck
looks like the key to beating the steelers run d is to have an rb fast enough to get out the backfield and beat the blitz before they get there
hope hes okay
anyone notice they got a spy on lamar basically every play
fuck that would suck if tyre is out like he hasnt been playing great but having to shuffle the oline mid game is crappy
dobbins is a future star
that blocking by andrews got me chubbed
dobbins balance is crazy he always looks like he about to fall on his face lol
that balance by dobbins to stay up after the ankle tackle

thats vintage ray rice shit

i am so pumped for his future
thats was a really bad decision
ingram done lost his job
fuck
dobbins has a knack for staying balanced he looks so special
lamars gotta feel that he was just holding that ball there hell learn tho hasnt seen it to many times
ick
cmon lamar
kinda fucking awful
lamar gotta pull that down oline isnt good enough to hold that long
i find myself yelling at the tv the same thing i yelled at joe throw the ball already
i know lamar is trying to throw but man just tuck it and run
fuck the steelers
lamar fucking up hard
where were you when this became classic steelersravens defensive battle

i wanna know why we didnt run that in for a td
anywhere from a 10 to 14 point differential thanks to lamar turnovers
that strip sack looked like the one lamar had vs tenn

when youre facing good pass rushes you cant wait a beat to give your guys time take off or throw it away
clearly didnt get that off in time but ill take the 2nd down over half the distance
ben just penalty hunting
lol they just gave up on 3rd and 10
awesome defensive series now lets put up 7
what was that spot hello
what spot is that challenge it
need points on this drive defense getting it done but ben will open it up at some point
lmao what kind of fucking mark on the punt was that
ravens defense steelers defense
lamar audibles now
lamar audibling more i think i like it
jesus dude we really having awful luck
welp fuck
noooooo
at this rate well have to pull fans from the stands to fill out the ol before game ends
say sike right now
suicidewatch
of course its stanley
thats broken
aside from lamar ronnie out for an extended period might be worst case scenario
damn it man the man just got paid too i hope its not a ligament
somebody better actually break tj watt
looked like a broken ankle to me
welp thats the season
take my leg ronnie
well fuck there goes our franchise lt for the season
looks like thats all well see from stanley this season
hes not playing for a long fucking time
looks like a massive knee injury

this is fucked up
cool let me just fly into the back of an olineman trying to take down a qb thats already wrapped up
of course it was watt
if we have to replace greg roman in the offseason i wont be mad
even if we win this game we still lose fuck
why does that always seem to happen player signs a big contract and they get hurt soon after smh
fuuuuck
would rather have lost this one than lose stanley
probably season for him eh
thats just depressing huge part of our team and at a spot where we dont have depth get to work edc
that was such as a risky throw
could have been lamars 3rd turnover of the first quarter wtf was he thinking
lets see ben powers man
lamar is gonna have to learn to get rid of the ball fast
this offensive line situation is bad news bears
we need to leave a te or someone to take a fucking bump into watt to try and stop him none of our lineman can 1v1 him
bright side this is almost certainly the best defense we play this year so this is the hardest challenge for our offense outside of thanksgiving we stay above water here and well be able to just about each game here out
we a defensive team again boys
1 hour 1st quarter goddamn
chris moore sighting
our d is legit
defense playing well at least keeping us in it
our defense can win us this game if the offense stops turning it over
this defense deserves better out offense seriously has to wake up
praying for ronnie stanley yall that just sucks
we better win steelers cant get away with this
run the ball across pittsburghs 40 then take the three
this game is winnable stop being so blek and depressing sucks that stanley got hurt but thats football we have people that are also paid lots and lots of money to come in and do the job lets go down and get some points
trying to get excited about this game again but its super difficult after ronnie went out
ronnie got rolled up on if you guys think tj watt did that on purpose then youre clueless
the wheels on the bus go round and round
gus bus
make gus 1rb already you cowards
beep beep motherfucker
feed that fucker
see what happens when we fucking run greg roman you dumb cunt
those 46 yard runs by gus are so effective man
need ricard or boyle to put watt in his place and show him what you get for being a dirty fuck the play ronnie got hurt might not have been dirty but every run play he is hitting lamar super late it may be legal and hes doing his job but its still dirty theres a reason other players dont do it
gus should be the starter from now on
feed the bus
get on the bus we goin
gus is the motm so far
keep pounding the rock
it only took him like half the season but is greg roman finally learning we can run the ball
jks acceleration is wild
run that mf rock
run it down their fucking yinzer throats
jk went 10 yards in about a second holy shit
run dobbins run
this run game is doing well here the steelers dont look like they have an answer at the moment
this is the greg roman we like
we have to be content running 34 yards at a time it is steady working and keeps steelers off field dont get greedy
the running game is so fucking beautiful
now that is when you call play action
ok now give it to jk
oof lamar please be careful
big gus truss
jesus christ thats a risky play call especially against the steelers who will play dirty
how is that not 15
beep beep motherfucker
that shouldve been penalized
this just proves that if the playcalling is right our offense is dangerous
love how low gus bus gets
orlando going fucking crazy ahhhhhhhh
wish we were this flawless in the passing game
thats how its fucking done
great drive love that we continued to run the ball
spilane cant handle the bus
yeah lamar please dont get hit like that againmy heart cant take it
g g g guuusssss
run that fucking ball
i love gus man he just goes straight up the middle and runs hard
that was such ravens football just keep doing this shit fuck the receivers
lets fucking gooooooo greg roman you fixed your shit
remember when people were like you cant run it every play lol
we really waited to lose 2 starters before we got into our game we havent run like this since last year lol
steelers got fucked that drive
there is absolutely no way ingram should get more carries than gus when he comes back
that was such a nice double ram by fluker and boyle

smart design by roman
zeus and fluker at tackles are better
i fuckin love gus i really hope he gets his fair share of the backfield and gets the chance to produce in the nfl like he is capable of
next time lamar king of the north levels up we gotta put a couple extra points into constitution
absolutely beautiful drive lets keep it goin
man i love our rbs
this is us this is our identity run run run open the opportunity for the passing game and score just be careful with the way we run lamar to avoid those hits
lfg baltimore
good play calling give roman credit also way too much lamar slander hollywood if he wants to get involved get open
ankle for stanley severity not yet determined
hopefully that convinced roman we should not have lamar stand in the pocket like a statue and throw to 5 ft 10 receivers thats not his strength
rush d starting to look sloppy lol
love to see watt screaming at coach
okay on that pi against peters i said it was uncatchable and holding at best romo just called it a holding penalty but didnt comment on it being just holding at the time i feel like that was freudian
lots of bad behavior on that play
why is this feeling i have right now so familiar as a ravens fan
fucking hell team we dont need to give up yards we can beat this offense
should be offsetting washington grabbing peters facemask is bs but so is judon adding extra out of bounds
that should offset they both hit eachother plenty
god judon is such an undisciplined bum
we gotta hit them during the play boys
jesus christ its a rivalry just wash the penalties
if they eject judon he will get more sacks then if he would have stayed in the game
honestly that was dumb by peters and judon but its the steelers so its bound to happen not that mad
omg you fucking idiot
the shit judon
are we going to even have backup players left after this game
so over judon
fitzpatrick contacted an official in first quarter nothing happened to him
soft penalty
lol lame ass call
judon
thats bullshit
dumb call
judon you fucking idiot
thats ridiculous when they also shoved a coach
i know its going to hurt us but im so fucking glad to see judon kicked from the game kinda weak from the ref but still get him out coaches need to stop leaning on him so much hopefully his time in baltimore is coming to an end
watch us get 3 straight sacks from here
time to shine yannick
thats a terrible ejection
lol judon is doing the absolute opposite of playing for a contract
ngakoues city now
judon being dumb shocker
if you hold someones arm like that in the middle of a fight did the ref expect him not to react
judon has elite dumbassery
wasnt even to the ref wtf
judon is gone
i wish we could cut judon he is such a fucking liability and i actually cant stand him
judon was carrying johnson away and was to pulled to ground he wasnt swinging at the ref someone was restricting his arm but he has to chill
judon and giving free drives to an offense name me a more prolific duo
maybe a weak call maybe a bit of flop by the ref but you just cant touch the refs thats practically automatic
although judon shouldnt be fighting with coachesteammates hes gone from here hes done
campbell makes the ball look like a lemon
steelers fans he punched a ref ravens should forfeit
im sorry but i love our chippyness fuck the steelers
there ben has fumbled now too we just didnt get the bounce
steelers offense looking like doo doo out there
earl thomas who
steelers offense is looking lost today
see that steelers no defensive linemen throwing their bodies around for no reason
i really wish there was more duvernay
im not hating that board dude
this game is giving me heart palpitations
i smell a very long jk dobbins run upcoming
judon is losing lots of money this season his on field production hasnt been there
this game is classic ravens steelers
why is ben always hurt
oh man bens elbow being looked at id kill to see the boys fuck rudolph up again
gus and jk both over 100 today
really like to see us hold onto the ball till the half
what the fuck lamar
yikes that fumble scared the shit out of me
lamar you are scaring me
lamar looking at the camera psyche
i didnt realize it was that slickery
is justice hill active
lamar is giving me heartache

fucking wet ball
waste the clock and at least score 3 is a perfect ending to the half
lets make it a two scorer before ht please
lamar fumbling madden 20 style
twitter video weve got a jumbotron proposal folks congrats to the happy couple ravens
thank fuck
incomplete
x200b

lamar you good bro
no int but that was horrible throw lamar
thats incomplete foh
nope dont like that
not a pick

but still come the fuck on man
ahh another devin bush dropped int theyll give them
cant use the ground to secure period
lamar just seems to be playing with a lack of confidence this yearidk
it may get called back but idk

lamar doesnt want to protect the ball today
that was to boykin right
now we run the damn ball
grind the fucking win out nothing sexy make it gross
great play by the defender poor pass not great job by the receiver to block out the defender
they need to make lamar carry a football around at all times and try to strip him randomly
phew i thought the refs were going to screw us again
guys the steelers are a good defense we are fine
huge conversion by lamar

i dont care how injured ben is or how bad their offense has looked all game you put them in oneminute drill and they will get points well done by us
i love seeing willie snead talk shit to steelers players haha
gonna be real i dont see mark getting many carries for the rest of the year
damn we might get 3 points or more out of this drive
ray rice jr
good play dont force it
superstar lamar starting to catch fire mane
pass was low andrews slipped bad combination
gotta make that pass but gotta have more time
why the f do you call a timeout right there
lol these refs are crazy sometimes xd
love tucker
tuck is the man
51 yards no problem
good hard earned field goal
tucker goat
the goat
so money tucker for mvp
tucker you god
tuck is just next level good
god i love that man jt
hey romo can we finally stop the charade about tucker not being the goat
g o a t
roman i know we say to run the ball but i mean come on dont gotta scare us like that with no timeouts lol
jk and snead carrying us today
he had another 1520 yards in the kick my god
guys i loved how it turned after stanleys injury the ground first game is back
love you tucker this will be a game of inches gotta outplay pittsburgh in the second half they will be coming
almost automatic
almost automatic shut up nantz
their offense cant fucking score on us this should be a half time shut out right now

fuck the steelers
autotucker
dobbins with 69 rushing yards in the 1st half
lfg do it for ronnie
tf they didnt show lamars pass td to boykin on the first highlight reel weak
happy to be on top at this point in the game just need to go out in the second half and keep pounding that rock
there might be some hope for stanley since its an ankle not a knee pray to the football gods
first couple drives had some rough calls but overall greg is calling a great game pleasantly surprised i was hardcore doomerposting early on because i was terrified hed try to have lamar throw the ball 45 times again

been bad all year but today hes been great pls keep this up roman
i think pitt is gonna stack the box hard and sell out on the run gonna need some good adjustements from gro
wayyyy to much time
bowser playing well this year
jimmy smith goat veteran
ben penalty hunting
idk if it was a penalty but they owe us a couple
squeelers looking for a flag
made up for the other one
ill take that makeup call for that bs call on peters
steelers cant just cry their way to yards prove you can beat a guy then they should throw flags
shut the fuck up romo
judon is ejected andnothing changes judon to the jets at the end of the season
goddamnit
i really dont get it
run the ball
run the fucking ball roman
run the fucking ball on 1st down
wow
jesus
jesus lamar you suck throwing the ball today
wtf are you laughing on the sidelines for
i mean we literally have a plan thats working and we absolutely have to get away from it why
again a fucking dumb throw
inside our own 20 with a shaky quarterback throw the ball
good lord lamar
why
lamar is too reckless
why are we throwin the football fucking exactly damnit roman
well that was sickening
honestly its really surprising were even in the lead still and the stanley loss just puts the cherry on top its going to be a miracle from god if we come out with a win
both tds have been lamars fault
madden curse
just run every play no need to pass it and get intercepted every drive
lamar ia killing us
lamar is absolutely killing us run the ball the rest of the day
our offense is the steelers offense
honest to got that may be his worst pass of his career
steelers cannot produce until lamar throws picks at the start of drives unfortunately that is happening too much
and just like that it went from feeling like we were up by 20 to being down by 10
i wanna see less than 5 pass attempts for the rest of this entire fucking game
lamar bby what the fuck
even with the line injuries this is a pathetic showing by lamar with 2 weeks preparation
steelers cant wait until we get the ball back fuck
just get back to pounding the rock and we good
stop wasting our time with a fucking extra point holy shit
we need to score again a nice long drive
feel like this is going to be another defensive win and lamar gets bailed out again or its all put on the d in some 4th q play and they cant make it happen because no matter how good they are its likely theyll make one mistake if theyre out there for ages

lamar needs to get his act together
for the americans even the uk broadcast team have no idea why theyre passing the ball
the steelers had under 100 yards of total offense before that pick goddammit how is this team going full 2016
fluker looked hurt there
need another turn over
that chris moore handshake was jokes lmao
prosche was wide open after a sensational route on that last 3rd down
whens the last time we took a deep shot certainly not during this game
i hate this
refball
wow were gonna lose lol
this is why you go deep but we dont
bullshit dpi
this game is giving me ptsd
yo wink can we call man to man please
defense needs a sack or a turnover to stop pitts momentum
fucking bullshit come on ravens wtf
sack daddy
fucking embarrassing
pick sixplease
ferguson winning me over these past couple of games
we knew theyd target queen
ferguson matched judons seasons production this drive alone
the great unraveling
oh boy now we get to do the thing this team loves the most playing from behind
lamar will pass every down now since they are now down
ihave no words
alright lamar redemption time
the quarter from hell
ugh im so sick of baker mayfield and his stupid commercials
defense is so good in the first half again and doo doo in second
every


single


one of us knows what roman is going to do now
jaylon ferguson to me has been the most improved player this year on the entire roster he always had all the physical tools so glad to see him producing a lot more
every time i watch ravens lose so guess i know what i must do for a w
this is going to be an ugly game and i am not happy
this game is basically the ravens against themselves aside from that drive the steelers havent even been playing in this game
our vertical passing game has disappeared
greg roman special incoming
got lucky
bad playcall but why the spin move there
i saw that fumble coming tell me why this happens
hold the fucking ball
saw that fumble coming too
how do guys not know that people are behind them lol
jesus christ
hold on to the ball
can we hang on to the damn ball please fellas
lamar is having a tough game
smh llama that was almost another turnover
wtf are these play calls
having to bring in two back up olinemen this game is really hurting us
3rd and 8 and you call a read option

fuck you greg roman no wonder buffalo dumped your ass
how the fuck is watt in the backfield that early
why on earth are we leaving tj watt unblocked are we stupid
why is watt constantly unblocked
my mood and my balls are blue
play calling and execution is killing us here
i feel the exact way when youd watch joe throw it short of the sticks on third down you just know 3rd downs are unlikely to hit
lamar is holding it way too long on literally every pass play
at this point i can just lose the cider part of this bourbon and cider
well at least lamar didnt turn the ball over on that drive

andrews tried to but to no avail

defense gotta save us
why is lamar playing scared we just refuse to even attempt to air it out and wont take any shots with guys who are 1 on 1

maybe if dez plays well he can change that and get him comfortable with throwing it up on those plays
tennessee fucking sucks
defense do that thing where you bail lamar out
get roman tf up out of here
the good thing is that lamars contract gets a little smaller everytime he throws the ball so it wont even close to a mahomes style contract by the end of the year
these injuries have killed an already lackluster oline lamar hasnt played well but hes under pressure immediately
good fucking stop offense do something
i fear edc is gonna overload our defense and completely ignore the offensethe only flaw ozzie had really
i dont understand it lamar read defenses so good last year but suddenly cant this year
i wonder which greg roman and lamar jackson we get this drive
can we flip judon for a wr offense needs help
cmon offense defense bailed you out lets fucking go
dalvin cook has 150 rushing yards and a 50 yard td catch
fuck this o line
lamar just looked scared on that play
wtf was that on lamars arm
what the fuck are we doing on offense lmao
this playcalling is disgusting
jfc this is brutal
why does lamars expression look so fucking confused youre getting tacked because you refuse to throw the ball my dude
dude fuck our play calling and fuck oline injuries
handing the sacks for free and spotted pit 14 pts
its going to be easier to contain this run when they know we just cant pass for shit
steelers secondary is not good someone is open
he had time ran into the pressure
maybe we should have no line defenders get to the backfield at the same pace but lamar has more room to run
3 and out turnvoer here

just like old times tbh
either no one is open or lamar cant see the field he had more than enough time there to get a throw off have to know against the steelers you have a certain amount of time
yesss duvernay i love this guy
duvernay all day

get that kid more involved
duvernay
finally
he has to be able to do that consistently to win a sb
duvernay is a fucking badass and we need to play him more
lmao then immediately follow with a loss of 2
are you shitting me he failed to hold he tried but he fucking whiffed
fuck that fucking flag
holy fuck this has been a onesided game by the refs
fuck
thats fucking bullshit
how the fuck was that a hold
36 run plays 23 passes but people are complaining that roman isnt calling enough run plays
that just wasnt holding
skura has had a rough time coming back from the injury
lets gooooo get that momentum
ayy lmao fuck these refs
thank you snead for having some balls and jawing those fucks
fuck fuck fuck fuck

many maybe thatll give lamar some confidence though
fuck these refs
thats literally not holding
pissed even if we get a td here there literally wasnt a hold on that call
that hold was so fucking weak
yo this game is fucked i never seen shit like this before fuck these refs
i thought the refs were going away from picky calls i thought the league wanted to reduce those calls
ravens can never get some ref favor
right knee was in no
bro thats a touchdown and a half that knee is so down
think its to close change it
wait thats a td that last replay its close but that right knee is down before left toes touch out of bounds
knee was in but its not enough to change
too close to call itll stand looks out to me though
knee is down the visible evidence is on the turf lmao
his knee tapped down slightly before he was out thats a td but refs arent gonna change it knowing how they operate
they could literally call that holding every play and they wait until they see lamar hitting his head on the goalpost to
kinda fucked u dont call something that close a td and review instead of making us use a challenge
ill be shocked if the refs give this to us
first int was roughing the passer too fuck the refs
need 6 man
so close but fuck it lets score here

x200b

edit hollywoooooooodddddddddddddddddddd
that blonde female voter on the 60 minutes ad could get it damn lol
doesnt fucking matter baby
great strike there lamar love that throw
i might cry
after scoring three times finally
asshole refs
the refs really think they can take shit from us and we wont get it right back lol
suck it easy lamar hatersssss
great job by hollywood finding the soft spot in the zone
finally got in there
great drive
finally offense picks it up lets go
hollywood still gets his td
no lie i was mad worried wed fuck the pass up
i dont understand why we dont roll out more
good get brown his td
lamar gave that steelers bench a long look after that td
how about a fucking defensive score and just twist the knife
we still gonna win boys belee dat
damn refs tried so hard to stop that one too
im so sorry for doubting you lamar lets go
so does lamar get the blame of the game still
3 touchdowns there on that drive give us 21 bitches
we are just so much better anyone can tell by just watching i dont know why this is so hard and stressing
my friend is in california and i asked him if hes ever seen hollywoooooooooooooddddd
i swear the refs are tryna fuck us on every play
bonds wtf
refs want to throw a flag so bad fucking pathetic
the fuck was that 38 who even are you
who the hell is bonds and why is he playing dude just straight up stopped playing in the middle of a catch
defense is hot offense sucks offense wakes up defense falls asleep good ole ravens football
cut 38
have the steelers had a holding penalty or dpi all game
is 38 a fan who snuck in holy crap
who is number 38
im feelin a marlon punch coming
agent bonds the steelers undercover agent
flag after flag
these mf refs
this is brutal
how is it pi every time what the fuck happened to holding or illegal contact
can the steelers please move the ball with out the refs help
how the fuck is that pi why are the refs so god damn biased
i love having over 100 yards in penalties
dude the refs are literally fucking full of shit
fuck these refs
these fucking penalties holy shit
for reals come on
9 penalties and 3 turnovers what the fuck
these refs can suck my dick
we just fuck ourselves so many penalties defense looks legit one half then absent the 2nd like come on guys
time for a fruit punch
ticky tack fouls man
pathetic defense right there
these pick plays are getting out of control in the nfl
we need a good long game winning drive to chew clock and get that w but with these refs fucking us over every chance they get i doubt well get past the 50yd line
defense got cooked horrible series
its just a matter of running the clock down and scoring we got this just gotta belee
im about the rip every follicle of my hair out this game has pissed me off passed my limit
the hometown calls will start kicking in for us one day like they do for every other team in the nfl
all of these refs deserve to hit the unemployment line how is it possible to be this bad and still keep a job
cold war looks sick af pretty hard to fuck up a return to that era when bo1 is one of the most loved games in the series cod 4 bo2 was absolutely the peak of the series
jk is the real deal
browns lost to the raiders lmaooooooooo
keep running
the wheels on the bus go round and round
why ever throw the ball again
letting gus leave would be a mistake idc
dobbins is fucking nuts
that option was gorgeous
future all pro imo
honestly we should coach our wrs to commit opi on every passing play the refs consistently call them on the defense regardless
keep doing this and stun them with a pass if needed
keep running that motherfucker pitt is on their heels
dobbins going off
if greg calls a goddamn throw at this point i will march to baltimores front office and protest until hes fired
wish we would take a play out of kcs book and get andrews out in the slot like they use kelce
this is what we should have been doing all game
wheres the people who were arguing against the fact that ingram is our 3rd best rb
fake injury to give his defense a rest fuck off
even if we lose this game going forward dobbins needs more carries he is amazing
sad but ingram needs to not get many snaps anymore
this game has all but cemented ingram getting cut in the offseason
bro this option is beautiful when they go straight at lamar every play
dobbins has such a knack for staying on his feet
now theyre faking injuries thug team
lets slow it down a little use they clock dont want to give them back the ball with too much time
not only are we good at running this team loves to run look at that effort on the blocks by all 10
absolutely need a td here a fg would be futile at this point
gus and jk looking great today
man i love dobbins hes a worthy successor to ingram
heart attack time
this is the game here
i hope they have something wicked dialed up
blame of the game jackson
player of the game running backs
greg roman loves his 4 man verticals in the red zone
if we throw it i going to jump out my eindow
we got this man lets go
im ready to get hurt
terrible clock management romo was right
i say go right back to the speed option with lamar and jk
truss baby lets gooooo everyone fingers crossed we get this 4th
the penalties have ruined this game for me i really hope we can still pull this off but damn the refs have sucked the life out of this game
terrible play wow
theres the fucking game
didnt deserve this game
why the fuck was it an empty back designed run
thats the fucking game
dreadful play call
another loss on lamar
whoever the refs are for this game better never have another ravens game
he fumbled anyway smh
what a shit playcall
another fumble by lamar not that it matters
oh my god how come we didnt use dobbins
what was that
fuck you greg roman
5 wide why
yes running backs been eating lets make the qb run up the middle
wooooooow greg fucked it big time
5wide empty and who did not expect qb draw laughing at these bandwagoners fans now all of a sudden calling for romans head d ice up people ice up
qb running it should be a bail out and not a play smh
the contrast to last year is insane i wouldnt even have been worried about that fourth down last year this year im confident we wont make it
im shocked that the refs havent thrown a random flag yet
thats a difficult play to cover nice tackle by peters though
what a play defense
last chance boys

x200b

big truss
damn he got rocked
how are we still in this game
duvernay i need you
im not hopeful but im still here lamarao
if we pull this offi would be so happy
if we lost this game thats still a clutch stop from our d
honestly can we give it to duvernay so he can run it downfield fast af
lets see if lamar has it in him to put it all behind him and comeback to win with no timeouts

questionable play calling aside you cant discount stupid penalties and awful turnovers

lamar went from fearless to reckless
need chunk plays naw lets throw it middle field short
this oline wont let a comeback happen
lamar is torture lamar is life
hayward can fuck out of here
if he is injure why not stopping the clock
either time needs to be back on the clock or a penalty
oh fuck oh fuck
offside pit
wtf there should be more time
refs didnt put any time back on the clock
why didnt we get more time on the clock
woophtie fucking doo fucking ref ball
never mind
refs fucked us
lamar woulda clutched that if roman could call plays
no matter the outcome too many fucking injuries this game
refs need fired
fuck these refs to end of the game
damn that was a good throw better defense
good game boys i still loves this team we played well despite
well at least it was close as fuck not like some other games where we just lose it in the second half can continue to tweak a few things
pain
if the player doesnt get up due to an injury after the 2 minute warning the defense gets charged a timeout and i would assume that timeout would be in effect once the player doesnt get up i disnt look it up but i remember when the rule got put in place because all the players were flopping
removed
how the fuck do people like romo just stfu already you dont have to talk the entire fucking game
so some take aways from the game

fuck the steelers

fuck the refs

lamar kept the steelers in the game

snead is somehow clutch af in those long passes

we need to let dobbins eat

those rpos were fucking glorious

the oline is fucked

if anyone wants to add feel free
fuck tj and fuck the steelers
cant wait to see that fat fucking rapist walrus get barley hit roll around on the field like he just had both his legs blown off
that could have gone better
if they hit lamar after he hands it off that needs to be called
i hope phillips is ok but im ngl iv been wanting fluker to start for awhile
fuck tj watt
show us a replay of a steeler dline doing some dirty shit already
hes out for the year that was the ankle
heres your well deserved extension then he gets rolled up by who else tj watt fuck man
leading with the helmet
thats a fucking penalty
fuck off judon you stupid fuck
lamar wth lol
lamar really really needs to get it together i know its a rough game but outside of short runs and passes he has looked extremely shaky
lamar making some flacco decisions
2 ints could have been 4 possibly the worst game of lamars career its unfortunate he never has one of these terrible games in a completely meaningless matchup its always the playoffs or in big games that will impact playoff seeding
man this is a bad game from lamar were still up by 3 and lamar is playing maybe one of the worst games of his career

that doesnt mean hes terrible or he sucks etc its just a bad game today from him
lamar is great he just makes awful decisions seems that other qbs mature and dont make these mistakes im worried about him
why are we blaming greg roman for lamar throwing a 4 yard duck asking to get picked
lamar is struggling but it is one of the best defenses in the league and he isnt getting much help from his line or receivers everyone on offense needs to be better
i dont understand why people are blaming greg roman when lamar just lofted that pass for no reason unless we are just mad every time we dont call a run play
i need to stop coming into these game threads
everyone acts like the refs are out to get us i mean bad calls are bad calls but come on no one is out to get us
dobbins is a stud cant believe i was nervous when we drafted him
yeah im fully on the fire roman train now
this is a masterclass in what not to do holy shit
so hes offside
thats offside
blaming watt is stupid that was just football now mekari missed his block
harbaugh needs to put his ego aside and play powers mekuri has been as bad as hurst was powers has been much better in limited action i dont care what is going on at practice this is the shit that almost stopped bryant mckinney from playing
did you guys see tj yelling at the coach on the sidelines he said i tried diving at his legs again damnit
yall lose faith too fast we are winning this game
in comes the crowd that says any criticism is being a fair weather bandwagon fan
regardless of the outcome at least i wont see trump commercials next week
getting close to turning this game off with all these trump ads definitely no more football today for me after this game ends either way since were apparently getting one every break
great game guys see you on thanksgiving
hey romo shut the fuck up about contracts when someone is injured
attention racists from dundalk

trace mcsorely is not replacing reigning nfl mvp lamar jackson
fuck trump
this board still amazes me at how fast they flip on this team
karma coming for tj watt
this is one of the worst games ive ever seen any qb have let alone jackson
my contribution in preparation is in my pc today lights on motherboard are purple and gold video card i have rotating between them and cpu cooler i have logo fading in and out purple and gold and found a new circle options called wings set to our purple

i have done all i can

fuck the steelers
pittsburghs d is playing a bit dirty forreal
that was one of the best corner routes lamar has ever thrown
that drive was huge coming back from that pick 6 and putting the ball on the spot on 3rd and goal joe cool status
peters owed us that for the penalty lol
for real fuck tj watt
play calling in the red zone is ass today
lamar just seems to be taking 12 seconds too long this season to make decision definitely the biggest thing he needs to work on
im tired of roman calling stupid bs passing plays when the ravens have so much momentum running the football wtf
lamar is trying to play hero ball because he doesnt trust his weapons whatsoever
i am not a young man any more they need to give me a big lead
fucking tj watt
bruh fuck watt dude is so extra already had multiple questionable late hits on lamar in this game
if that is as bad as it looks stanley wont be back to full health until 2022

hell play in 2021 but wont be himself

speedy recovery ronnie
i blame roman what a dead play from before the snap put your players in position to score not get injured you fuck
is roughing the passer still a call they make ever
no way this team beats the steelers x2 or the titans playing like this with this ol
i dont understand how the steelers are top of the division they have not looked good at all today
how is that not a hit to the head
ingram should not be the starter anymore
fuck this dirty ass team bro
were better without judon change my mind
body built by fuckin idiot




oh shit hope ben is okay if nothing else we gotta get more sacks on him
i wouldnt blame lamar for that tbh he just ran it and tried to palm the ball when its wet outside
lots of trolls in the thread yall watch out
i would like to apologize the ravens paid me to cut the grass but i misheard them and dropped grease all over the field thats why everyone is slipping around
people forget lamar is young against a stout pass rush with no line and marquise brown is his best receiver you guys act like he has jerry rice and our 2012 offense line
did we learn nothing from the last drive keep it on the ground

lamar is not himself today carrying the ball with one hand cmon dude
lamar fucking sucks at throwing the ball this season just not way around it
lamar is literally costing us the game
lamar is having a lot of mistakes today

remember were still up rn and it doesnt mean hes terrible or this seasons a wash lets keep it within this game we can still win today obviously
im really disappointed coming out of the bye like this
we must belee still
whats concerning is that our 1 receiver hasnt had a single catch correct me if im wrong
ref ball
we honestly dont deserve a dub were gettingin our own way
chuckles were in danger
lamar is losing us the game gave them 14 points so far gotta get his shit together
lamars performance today is even mpre concerning considering he hasnt really played very well all year its not just 1 game for him its several games where he has looked bad
lamar is looking a lot like 2018 lamar good at running but bad awareness leading to fumbles and picks i hope he can turn it around
we got competent greg on play one and crazy greg play two it seems

lamar is a straight killer it should never even be a discussion whether we keep him or not
we have triple the penalties for more than triple the yards we are owed a nice soft defensive pi
i swear we are hated by everyone not from baltimore penalties almost always skew against us even in clean games

i do not believe we are doing anything different there are so many horrible egregious penalties that happen in other games and yet we always seem to suffer from ticky tacky bullshit calls like in the eagles game against peters just seriously pisses me off
what shit clock management
this is the game here my dudes
fire greg roman
terrible playcalling by roman at the end

the loss will be on lamar though if it happens
lamar was an absolute joke today point blank lost us this game for sure rbs and d are the only reason it was close
that was so close that my heart hurts
this was a masterpiece by the refs
seems like a penalty
pi


x200b

30 seconds in boykin was wide open lamar needs to start looking outside
cardinals fan here fuck the steelers lets go baby
idgaf about a penalty can we take some hit at tj watt hes been targeting lj8 and not getting some fouls called
jackson what the fuck was that throw that is almost a guaranteed interception just take the sack
judon did nothing wrong
lamar jackson is singlehandedly keeping pittsburgh in this game there is no one else
ok lets say it now we are 7 games in and lamar is playing like trash this season
flacco not looking good today
why the f does lamar play bad every time in the really big games is he bad and the design works to beat lesser teams or whats up
2nd year in a row weve had to play the steelers and the refs on the same sunday
stop with the fucking political comments and lets fucking talk about football god damn also who tf is jay balvin
removed
and again lamar cant lead us to a comeback in a game he single handedly created the defecit
literally all that happened so fast no added time and then blatant personal foul on that last play very confusing officiating on a side note lamar needs work he does need help yes but you could give him an all star cast and but with the way hes playing this year it wouldnt matter his accuracy is below average he has flashes but overall has been lack luster if he wants to get paid like russ or deshaun he needs to perform better imo
get an absolute fucking grip if you think thats intentional holy shit
i did not bet enough for steelers win to calm myself
for baltimore and maryland we will fight on to victory

fight fight fight
my good friend won the lottery got seats right behind the ravens bench he has promised me a victory today

go ravens
for the love of god please challenge the steelers wrs near the los and limit the short passing game
can it please be 1 pm already
listening to go to sleep by eminem ft dmx to get pumped up
im nervous af
well im gonna spend this game not sober because the stress is gonna kill me otherwise
when was the last time we got romo holy shit
i love romo
w
lets goooooooooo
drop their ass
harbaugh with the camo md flag mask
i am usually against violence but id be ok with any ravens fan that sold their tickets to a steelers fan get the shit kicked out of them and have their season tickets revoked 4k people lucky enough to get tickets and you treasonous bastards sell
up at 5am in australia like i am every week

normally i need an alarm to get me up for ravens games not this week i could barely sleep

lets go
its 5am here and i am fucking ready lets do this
lets fucking do this ravens
ass
burning a wicker man to curse big ben today fuck that bitch
hey everyone just started watching football is this a big game
time to temporarily replace my election anxiety with ravenssteelers anxiety
bruh wtf
run the ball
run the ball down their fucking throats
dumb throw lmao
jesus christ lamar worse than his rookie year
he was open for like 34 seconds he waited way too long
fuck
lamar got baited badly
ffs lamar
how is that not a late hit though
that wasreally bad
weve come back from shit starts before we can do it again well get the ball back
can we start this game over
worst possible start
they get the ball in the second half christ
roughing the passer isnt a penalty today i guess
what about roughing the passer
i miss yanda and hurst so much lol
aight lets feed gus
haha man we just saving the run for a play off run
had two weeks to prepare steelers coming off a emotional game and thats what our first 3 plays look like cool cool cool good good
gus edwards doing well so far id keep running it tbh
that boy got ice in his vein with that throw
throw minka out shoved ref
i want to see lamar run to run he was setting up to pass there and he could have made a play for a forst down if he wasnt jogging the whole way
already yall saying theres a lot of time and were 51 so we shouldnt complain eagles seriously shouldnt have had a chance last week
lamar really needs to learn how to throw the ball away when defenders have him beat
yo greg call some outside runs steelers blitz the middle every down
maybe it is
so theyre just allowed to hit lamar on every play didnt know that was a rule
wtf heyward minkah was fine actually but jeez
anyone else just see the end jump early
this offense has been mediocre all season and its not gonna change face the facts
so were starting where we left off in philly
good to see that the ravens are still messing up their formations frustrating
willie really be the goat
damn snead slow haha
needed that
great job by snead on getting open after 41 tripped
nice
wow snead got caught by a lb lol
great play but man i thought snead was faster than that
bench phillips im tired
hot mic lol
why does greg roman still have a job
touchdown ravens
boykin feelin that heat from dez
big boykin no lil boykin
lol where the boykin haters at
miles
perfect
yes

dang lamar got it out fast there just gotta stay cool under pressure
boykin stepping up thank god
great recovery drive there though kind of saved by the late hit now dont make any more mistakes for the rest of the game
yall can say whatever you want i think boykin will be good for us for a long time
what a throw babyyy
that pick 6 happened early enough we can just forget it ever happened
great response
time to see yannick
couple of nice catches by boykin this drive
did dez already teach boykin how to run routes and catch this week definitely worth the money
we aint backin down
friendship ended with not liking boykin now liking boykin is my best friend
yannick and campbell combining for 5 sacks today
gotta love rsteelers the victim hood over that drive its da refs
dez showing up seems to have awakened boykin boys pumped
now time to see how the d is going be today
if we had settled for a fg there i would have been so stressed
romo full stiffie right now
please d knock that fat piece of shit on his ass
that roughing call was legit lamar was already wrapped up with his momentum clearly taking him out of bounds and heyward laid a lick on him so stfu
that was a great drive by lamar and the offense now lets go d
rnfl is pure yinzer tears today so fuck that noise im coming back here
its a ravens trademarked drop by ebron
man ben threw that so hard he nearly knocked him over
learn to catch you fucking steeler bitches
that was uncatchable
makeup call
lets gooooooo ravens
lol now they cant stop bitching about refs
ben hasnt seen this defense since 2018 we winning this
damn just realized this is the first game against ben without suggs lewis or reed on the team
seattle bro here wtf was that call
fucking uncatchable come on call a hold of you want but thats bs
what was the pi lol
please lord
where the fuck is foul
lmao fuck you pittsburgh
bad call for bad call love to see it
i love our defense bro
ravens ball

fuck yeah mp juiceman
lfg
go marcus
football gods with the instant karma bitch
mp punchman

humphrey pick inbound
wow marlo is giving juiceman some tips and tricks
it may have been a mental error on my part to start claypool in fantasy ah well fuck the steelers
interceptions are overrated who needs them when your cbs cause fumbles
hahahaha get punched bitch
lets go petersssss
welcome to baltimore claypool
mp juiceman
rollercoaster of emotions so far another bal pit game lets do this
steelers receivers and getting stripped by a ravens cb name a better duo
mp got revenge for that pi call
fuck yes
ball dont lie fuck the refs
lmao peters said fuck the refs
juuuiiiicccceeeeee
but guys i thought the game was over
ball dont lie bitch
juice man
put a dagger in their hearts now please
during the commercials just wanna say fuck the steelers and this is the greatest rivalry in football
this is the longest quarter ever
fuck the steelers so much
jk you friccin moron
holy shit its almost like if were a runcentric offense were way more of a threat stonks
dobbins best balance in the league
mark andrews with the fat ass block
romo always sounds like he just woke up lmao
he needs more touches hes electric and the hand in the turf he looks just like rice
boyle andrews and boykin with elite downfield blocking
wtf dude
bad job by lamar should have felt dupree
i fucking hate this
fuck we really needed points there lamar has to stop trying to force shit
killed that drive with lamar run and then pass
why not keep running the ball
lamar held it too long damn what a crazy game already
its gonna be one of those games today huh
drank some more
god damn dude
common son
why would you not run
run run run
what a sloppy fucking game
beyond pissed rn
he shouldve taken off he was already past the d linemen
ive officially set fuck more times in the first quarter than i have ever before
goddammit
steelers d lineman are dirty as fuck 96 just casually tackling lamar and falling on his legs
you should know you xant hold the ball that long especially against that d wtf
we need a good ol to make lamar feel comfortable we have 0 push or pull in the right side
ahh i almost forgot what ravens steelers matchups were like what a roller coaster
o line is trash right now lamar needs to step it up and we need to just run the fucking ball when its 2nd and goal
ngakue first sack as a raven and first safety incoming
this is a classic purely better defense today wins
you gotta have better awareness lamar
i mean he literally hit his arm before he hit the ball
did lamar think bud dupree would just disappear after he juked him
i think im drunk already that george dickel hell getcha

oh yeah and this game is driving me to multiple refills
they didnt even get that off in time lol
our d is fired up man i love it
open field tackles best tackles
see how steelers take shots even if it doesnt work it keeps our defence honest snd from being overly aggressive we need to do that there is none of that
january football in november lets gooo
they can not move the ball on us
believe in our defense
looks like were playing against the refs today too
ref fucking us hard on that spot
these refs trying to hand the squeelers everything right now
i fucking love lamar lol
tj fell flat on your face you bitch
no fuck
that play fake was shit though
not like this
no stanley fuck
ah mega fuck this shit
jfc
please say sike
stanley fuck noo please
fuck
fuck no fuck fuck
well shit
steelers killing our linemen
kill me
tucking stanley are you kidding me
fuck fuck fuck
well fuck
we are fucked if we lose stanley
fuck our lives right now
fuuuuuuuuuuck thats not good
i think thats gonna be season ending
thatsextremely not good you know hes seriously hurt from his reaction

fuck thats really bad that looks season ending
oh fuck
not like this please
fuck tj watt
yup that ankle looks fucked
fuck this is bad
fuck fuck fuck
this game is just so ridiculous at this point
no
fuuuck no
fuck this looks bad
fuck that is bad
wtf happened with our line first poor play and now injury ugh
torn acl fuckkkkk
fuck tj watt
we shouldnt even be surprised at this point lmao
yup his ankle just snapped
down two linemen before the half is over i hate to be negative but damn this isnt looking good for us
un fucking believable

fuck tj watt
fuck fuck fuck
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
steelers gunna feast on that side of the line now love you ronnie get better soon
ronnie stanley is kill

no
yikes invest in oline at the draft
this isnt gonna be pretty
holy fuck what a dumb decision
he needs to be sure of himself seems hes doubting himself alot throw it quick
whats the timeline on broken ankle if thats what it is any chance at all he comes back for potential playoffs
fuck my life this is some bullshit
gonna be real hard to overcome that loss for one lamar is going to have to throw sooner
oline is about to have a very long game
trying to take it all in his shoulders truth is with this line he needs to get it out quick i wanted deep shots but that isnt happening this game need to give him a chance and get creative with quick plays hes not going to have more then 25 seconds to get that ball out
great throw ben
defense playing well at least
big ben out here seeing ghosts
at the very very least keep taking time off the clock and keep the d rested
watch for some sneaky stuff
this is gonna be like the 2018 ravens with 1 defense carrying offense
if we win without stanley that says enough about this steelers defense
our defense is playing great lets focus on that
whats the timeline for broken ankles on linemen
the ravens will and should be known for defense
man if we can get more td before half we should win d has their foot on their neck rn we just need to finish drives
and if he is out for the season he will come back stronger next year still glad we extended him
no way is losing stanley good but i think we will start running the ball more and more play action which should help lamar again losing stanley is terrible
its still 77 and we have a stacked defense this game is not over lamar needs to be better though go ravens
the bus is rolling
gus bus
gus singlehandedly gonna keep us in this game
all aboard the gus
our power oline is essentially in rn lmao
can we just keep running the ball with rbs tired of us being cute in big games
make way for the bus motherfuckers
gus bus is the fucking truth feed this man
best run defense in the nfl who

gus the bus
man im just sad about stanley now
gus bus
keep running play action to hollywood rinse repeat
just keep pounding it you make them slow down the pass rush and then open up throwing and some play action
keep runnin da ball
finally run the ball
the squeelers d is too committed to stopping lamar from running and its gonna cost them
dobbins is so electric bozeman is having a hell of a game
ravens moving down the field super easily by running the ball

roman lets throw it
keep going roman dont fuck this drive up
gus and jk are the future love it
we 2018 mode today lets go win for stanley
now that the steelers are keying in throw a nice pa over the lbs
why doesnt lamar just phase through the incoming pass rushers sure his o line is hurt and letting in a lot of the rush in the pocket but why does that affect him no excuses lamar go invisible and they have no chance of affecting your passes
they say lamar looks slow bull shit
wow the run game is workingwho woulda thunk it
our offense is playing better than their offense without the 2 turnoverswere up 37 and about to score again
even hit at the line we are getting 4 yards a rush stick with it
run game opens up short passes lets go
dont get cute here run
lol whos the guy that tried to tell me that the ravens cant run the football almost every possession cause thats essentially whats happening xd
wow a guy is super open on pa after running it like 10 times in a row its almost like our 2019 game plan was really effective
respect to this oline two guys injured and we are running the ball well against a good defense lets give these guys praise for their improvement on last game
and look how wide open he was due to the run game
offense is coming alive
looking just like 2019 run the ball to open up lamar read options and the pass game
i think we just turned into the 2018 ravens
thatd be targeting in college
damn he got rocked
season has just been weird because we are trying to change our identity when we already have what works go back to what we do best and nobody cant stop us
beep beep
were running all over this defense even without stanley pathetic
this is the offense i miss
thats dirty af straight to the head
we in this boys we gonna get this for ronnie
lamar got ducking popped on his chin
this is ravens football
get busd
lets gooooooo fuck yeah
now thats the drive we all asked roman must be on this thread lol
smash mouth
i like that keep running the fucking ball
pick 6 plz fuck big ben
so really we should be up at least 10 for all the doom and gloom
i cant believe i hated ne more for a couple years fuck this team in black and yellow fuck them to hell
we are dominating this game
eat shit pittsburgh
lets fucking go

what a drive

running the ball down their fucking throats
edwards been balling all game
back to our bread and butter lets goo
gus bus
that vintage 2019 drive went down real smooth
my son whos been involved with football most of his life thinks the steelers are overrated cant say hes wrong so far
suck it long suck it hard trebek
run the ball win games aint that hard
im just waiting to hear ben talk shit about his receivers on pittsburgh local radio tomorrow
fuck the steelers 1 run defense cant handle two backup ols bet they go for browns legs next
boys are settling in now beautiful drive
over 125 yards on the ground so far love it
next season we gonna have a backfield of dobbins and edwards ingram is gonethis game proves it
the score per quarter streak lives another quarter
i dont wanna hear anymore question about who the best defense is anymore
lt ronnie stanley has been ruled out for the rest of the game with an ankle injury ravens
run it
gus dobbins for our rb group next season
run the dang ball roman
fuck the steelers
id take watching those running play drives all day over passing thats so different compared to the rest of the league and fun to watch them weave through the holes
ronnie has been ruled out w an ankle injury
ben roethlisberger is trash hahahahhahaha
this offense is best when it dictates and not when it takes what is given
am i the only one who is loving this gritty dirty game feels like the old school slug fests and im here for it
ngakoue playing the run what i thought he didnt do that per rnfl
i fucking hate the way connor runs hes so damn slow and uptight he doesnt bend over all all lol its so dumb
oh shut he fuck up tj
damnit
steelers taking notes from ravens on run game rn
even if youre good against the run it doesnt mean youre good against baltimores runs
first time judon would get a flag for pf id support him for
ravens gotta be smarter than that cant take dumb penalties
fucking dammit judon what are you doing
prepare to get fucked by the refs
drop judon taco bell changed him
no way you can only call something on us there
tj watt is not likeable whatsoever
should be offset
screw that steelers player he pushed one of our coaches trying to split it up
the only thing about this game is that bens jersey is still white i want the defense punish that old man
judon again trying his best to negate a positive play by the team
i would like to see offsetting penalties but i think itll probably be on the ravens
just offset the flags and get this game moving jesus christ
lol peters isnt wearing socks rn
once again hurting ourselves
think hollywood will breakout in this game eventually
the fuck judon
judon
trade judons ass
wow judon wtf was that

edit judon is innocent freejudon
goodbye judon wtf
fuck you refs fuck you judon
judon you dumbfuck
judon is such a fucking idiot and i 100 blame the coaching staff for his undisciplined weekly penalties
that wasnt on purpose he was trying to wiggle free
weak ass call
lame ass call
lmao fuck judon
fuck that was dumb were not going to have enough guys left to finish this game
wowww judon what are you doing
glad the ravens picked up 91
lol judon what a dip shit
deserved see you next weekbut not next season
judson can fucking go he has zero fucking self control what a fucking dumbass act like a god damn adult you dont need to go wild and swing in every direction like a child throwing a temper tantrum
should be able to review a penalty that ejects a player
lmao you punched an official you idiot
judumb
judon is a fucking idiot

hope hes gone next year hes not worth it
dumbass absolutely uncalled for
fuck thats unlucky that wasnt on purpose but i see why they ejected him
oh no anyway
judon blame of the game
that was dumb af
judson needs to be cut maybe taco bell can sign him
judon fucking us over with penalties nothing new here
honestly fuck judon dont need him

not a good look for judon in a contract year
anyone want a trade for judon
judon is gone after this year
judon is fuckin gone after this year
judon might as well not even bother trying to negotiate a new contract with us
yo the d need to chill fk
trade judon
campbell is his own wall lmao
calais campbell probs has the most pbus on the team this season
the refs are trash
i fucking love romo as announcer
everybody notice how far back their rt lines up off the line we get called for that all the fucking time
joker
you frickin idiot just got jokered
adda boy matt earn that extension
ravens living in their heads rent free
lets put a smile on that face
lets run this bitch
sack lunch num num num num num
boonk gang
i want another td before the half since they get the ball to start the 2nd
whats up deshon
is the defense that good or is the steelers offense this shit
still not as bad as when the guy was showing the ref he got speared in the chest and got ejected refs need to be held accountable for the bullshit they get away with
big ben is straight white trash lmao pretty sure i saw him buying cigs and a pbr tall boy in a sheetz last week
ben is done he should just retire
hahaha ben has his poor wittle elbow hurt serves them right after taking out 3 of our starters
i cant wait until next week when i can watch a football game without campaign ads if youre still undecided you probably arent voting anyway lol
can you lot stop acting like judon was swinging at the ref he was trying to get out of being held yes hes dumb for trying to keep going leave it at that
if its in pain he rehurt it
ah yes bens scheduled injury scare
what in the fuck lol
lamar has to run forward to avoid tj every play
if gus keeps getting 5 yards on 1st down keep doing it dont get away from it please
holy shit lamar this game is killing my anxiety

wet ass ball
lamar going to give me a heart attack this week
seriously just dropped it what
athletic fumble recovery
lamar gotta tuck it
geez this has been a long half
run it down their throats this is a physical game
hes holdin that ball like a loaf of bread
lamar out here playing basketball
ah lamar just trying to tease watt all is good
lamar about to give me a heart attack over here
im happy to see us running the ball down peoples throats again
the one thing steelers fans were sure wasnt going to happen was that we would run all over their defense and we have like 150 in the first half that alone is making me chuckle
lamar is allergic to the football
jfc two picks and two fumbles for lamar
no catch
lamar got lucky again
any update on stanley
not pick horrible play by lamar but not a pick
lamar doing his best famous jamais impression today
yeah lets not do that lamar pls
dude didnt even have 2 hands on it no way thats a catch
horrible throw and decision lucky it hit the ground should be overturned
nah not a catch lucky for lamar
he dropped that shit
not an int
incompleteincompleteincompleteincompleteincomplete
what are these camera angles show the damn play i dont want to look at a players face
not a pick but holy shit lamar what is happening
i think llama is in his own head this year
thats getting called back
this is the most insane game ive ever seen already
surely not a pick right he used the ground to control it
andrews was wide open
its incomplete chill
bailed out lamar cant make those mistakes
thats incomplete but the decision making is horrific
they better overturn that
i cant even blame boykin for that one
im sweating bullets
lamar run this shit
no fucking way thats an int
no way thats a pick but ffs lamar
i smell a blitz
there offense hasnt done shit keep running it down their throat
lol i was right about them blitzing but i didnt think itd be an outside blitz o
protect objs legs at all costs
if tony romo was my teacher in high school all of my bs would have been a
at least we arent the rams
nice fucking run jk
what the fuck is that i thought you just couldnt have 2 people moving at the snap
that was a nice throw
interested in how ben is going to look after working his arm like that
willie eating today
snead has been great in his limited opportunities so far this year
well done there lamar lets give him props when he makes a good throw
i remember this steelers fan said we wouldnt be able to run because they stopped chubb and henry oh boy
letting watt run free at lamar is not smart
we really play so well when we commit to run our passing downs become soooo effective

but run 3 consecutive pass plays greg loln
gotta check that down
thats a first
agree with romo therewe save that timeout and we can challenge the middle of the field
i dont like this lamar down the middle stuff its efficient and gets yards but hes so open to being hit
please tucker youre the goat for a reason
money
we know hes good jim
he was good from the 50 yard line
i think our offense is playing very well
tucklove
jesus fucking christ dobbins what an effort
wtf he was out
best kicker in the league eh romo
goat
i love my kicker
hey tony give tucker some respect
meanwhile cin is up on ten
51 yards has never looked so fucking easy
i love tucker
lets gooo
miami is up 28 to 7
automatuck
i fucking love tucker man
showed some major heart there man

really proud of this team

what a roller coaster
2 scores up on one of our toughest opponents this season im happy
best kicker in the league
boswell could never
good from 65
automatuck
lol wheres the guy from 2 weeks ago saying tucker was no longer in his prime
this is a tough ass game i dont like it but that team is good good half boys
i still dont care how crappy of a win a win is its still a win and if its a crappy win that next teams not going to look for you to be this amazingly explosive team and theyre going to let you go and then youre going to whip them and show who you are
cowher can ben open it up with a crabmeat elbow
looks like a lot of good adjustments were made in the bye week
my stream is out of pittsburgh and all these commercials are making me sick
too much time
um coverage
2nd most rush yards allowed by the steelers in the first half in 25 years
cant let juju catch it if marlon isnt there to punch it out
king koopa
these steelers receivers are a lot softer than they used to be
with judon out cut yannick loose
no flag
id be fine with resigning bowser
welp we got away with some dpi there lucky glad to see a punt
pi if johnson made an effort instead of giving up i can see a flag thrown
shut up tony his palm was open on both
jimmy still got it
gimme another one of those long drives ending in a td
the ravens d played that possession great coming out of the half
lets burn some clock if the steelers keep taking shots theyre going to get one eventually gotta deny opportunities and keep a margin
why just why
what the fuck is going on
why are we not running
and if you dont like that you dont like greg roman
are you fucking shitting me

wtf
run the fucking ball
lamar stop throwing picks fuck
madden curse
wtf was that shit lamar and greg why tf are you throwing it

jesus that was awful
why the fuck arent you running
triple option offense never pass the ball again
who is it who is calling these dogshit play
ahhhhhhhh i cant drink this much guys what the fu k
hell of a play though just not worth the risk
heart attack jackson are you not entertained
thanks lamar
fuck greg roman and wtf lamar
greg roman run the fucking ball
d must be tired s
why dont we run it lol

man this has been a long ass game and its just getting longer and more difficult to watch haha makes me almost want to laugh at this point that we just cant keep this team in check keep on letting them into the game gotta tighten up
just run the ball take it out of lamars hands
do they know the half started yet
why doesnt harbaugh go over and tell lamar to calm tf down i dont get it starter or not light a fire under his ass
well thats all on you lamer stop fading away get back to the fundamentals
man this is embarrassing we had a nice lead and momentum going into this half and its all gone
thats all on lamar cmon kid lead us and get us up
lol lamar
wheres all the people defending lamaroc now playing like shit and has the nerve to dial up a throw and terrible execution
now they right back in it fuck
we havent seen the fruit punch yet its coming
im about to drive to the bank myself and scream some better playmaking into these boys
why are we doing this shit over an extra point
is lamar throwing this game
im legit pissed off
somebody tell heart attack this isnt a playoff game
lamars just playing 4d chess and making questionable mistakes so us fans can watch a more competitive ravens win
all game gus has been steadily gaining 45 yards on first downs why stop
feel like this is going to be another defensive win and lamar gets bailed out again or its all put on the d in some 4th q play and they dont make it happen because no matter how good they are its likely theyll make one mistake if theyre out there for ages

lamar needs to get his act together
here we go playing fucking like trash now ughhhhhh
i forgot hollywood and andrews suited up today boys have been nonexistent
who lol
of fucking course
now the defense is losing some steam
what a fucking joke
bs penalty refs have been shit today both ways
thats some serious bullshit
steelers are cancer and were smoking and wading into toxic bogs and shit
havent seen a pass deeper than 15 yards thrown by us today
the wr put his own arm back
who is this guy
has there been a single long pass attempt from pittsburgh that we didnt commit pass interference or should have been called
and here comes the meltdown
defense starting to loosen up
sack daddy
and here comes the touchdown
yeah this is looking bad
ok this is not funny anymore its not halloween anymore ravens you dont have to scare me
the return of the swiss peas defense lol
absolutely blowing it out there granted that was a really shitty pi call but still this is going sideways fast
i cant believe they are gonna have the lead
fucking tackle lamars bad pass aside the defense has not looked focused out of the locker room
judon doesnt make that tackle
and that is the killer unless lamar gets his shit together
fuck the steelers


fuck conner


fuck my fantasy team
these division games just never come easy
cant wait for the o line injuries to be used as a crutch by everyone in the ravens organization
weve got this that was their first score off of a drive
this is all on you lamar
soooo kickoff return td anyone
we couldnt expect the defense to hold up this entire game the amount of missed opportunities on offense is going to be the reason we end up losing the only way we win is if our offense makes some kind of adjustment offensively like cmon roman cmon lamar
steelers eat all the meat you toss into their mouths
okay time for a massive dab to deal with this bullshit
let dobbins cook
this is a season defining game just like last time last year in the first game vs pits gutted that one out need this or bye is gone and looking up to pitkc among others in the afc do i have faith in roman to adjust lol no was holding out that romanlamar to get cooking w the bye and its just not there this game was fucking free
sooo can we throw the ball deep
the ravens always fighting against themselves do what works
we cant keep laying offense eggs in big games
im scared every time he drops back to pass
lamar looks lost
here we gofreak out and throw it
what the fuck was that goofy ass run lamar
honestly i hope someone fucking lights into lamar yes hes the face of the franchise now and hes a good guy but he cant play like this and expect to win a playoff game let alone a super bowl

fundamentals decisions and throws today are all horseshit from him today truly he is playing scared and careless at the same time i get its raining and roman sucks but he is also at home and is in his 3rd year after a supposed offseason of work put in
i mean we absolutely cant have another three and out
they added diving head first to giving yourself up for running qbs why are they allowed to dive onto him after on the ground
i hate greg roman i seriously fucking hate him
how fucking lucky
can we not fucking fumble anymore
every good play something bad happens lol
andrews has been open a lot today
man the ball is slick today
another fucking fumble
i knew that was gonna be fumbled you could see it coming a mile away
i fucking cant i really cant do this to myself
another heart attack this game is going to kill me
andrews wtf
be secure with the fucking ball please
now the ol sucks
brilliant play call
3rd and 8 zone read love it
im so sick of roman so sick
that play call was absolute shit
what the fuck are these idiots doing christ
why the fuck is justice hill on the field
wtf was that play call
yknow id hoped that after last year i wouldnt have to worry so much about games getting so out of hand in the second half it appears to be happening a fair amount again fuck
roman doesnt trust lamars arm on 3r and 8
wtf are we doing man
welp
we went big and expensive on defence but we really need to work on our offence now
a picture of swiss cheese and a picture of the ravens offensive line

theyre the same thing
wide receivers have played like trash
need a pick or punch out soon
we r so lucky he fell there was a ton of room
first time all season were going a quarter without points
our d has been so good need to hold this 3rd right here lets go baby
jesus that couldve been like a 50 yard run if he didnt trip
everyone ignoring that the run game is going to stop working once the steelers just sell out for the run since the pass game isnt even remotely scaring anyone right now
the passing offense looks like theyre running plays from the yard on madden no joke
thank you defense
passing plays this season first option isnt there oline is like a sieve scramble to the outside throw it to an unexpected te or rb every damn time
our offense has to score no 3 points this is 4 down territory the whole way
has lamar thrown a deep pass all season
all my homies love the ravens defense
orlando has a choice of 2 dudes to block and picks neither
excellent field position now cant ask for anything more than that from your d and st
offense step up dammit
alejandro villanueva is huge he is actually 1 inch taller than calais campbell i just noticed it from the camera angle behind his back
heart attack likes going downhill lets go
do we have an o line
i try to stay off of the whole greg roman thing but he is absolutely terrible
great sacks to take sees pressure steps up into a collapsing line again
this oline is gonna kill us not a shock without stanley
fuck everything about being alive right now
i dont even know what our game plan should be at this point we gave up running the ball on more than one play per drive and the pass protection and general passing game is abysmal
i hate it i hate it i hate it
jesus christ

has hollywood even had the ball thrown to him
how do they draft all these fast wide receivers that some how cant get open
fucking pathetic
even our completed passes were risky completions we need better wrs or better scheme
we get to the fifty and greg roman decides were a spread team anybody else notice that
you can get away with no oline or no wide receivers but not both
look at those ravens receivers getting open

said nobody ever
willie snead mark andrews miles boykins

only those 3 have caught something
cant believe willie snead is the 2nd best wr on our team who thought that would be okay outside of andrews everybody else is a number 2 or 4 at best
lamar hit a deep throw
finally lamar hits a deep ball
im on a stream i think im behind
omg
did that really happen
holy fuck what a catch
what a throw
wheres the lamar cant throw haters now
all my homies love devin duvernay
mother
fuck the refs
skura is absolutely getting ass fucked
fuck off refs that isnt a hold
thats a hold
thats fucking bull shit
holding
given how they dont call holding much i kind of hate that call
dont you just love getting fucked over by the refs
wtf that was the shittiest hold call ever
of course it was a penalty
fucking refs forfeit the game fuck this shit
lamar you make me hate and love you all at once wtf
wow fucking bullshit
fuck the refs
yikes thats not holding
this is a fucking joke fuck this
yeah thats the one fucking hold all game ok
a jackson touchdown is called back because of a holding penalty on skura

x200b

what is this even
ive seen so many oline man get away with that
fuck these refs
bullshit penalty
fuck you refs you dont own us
if youre a ref in this game go fuck yourself
hard to beat the damn refs
need iv snead
thats not a hold wtf
these refs are heavily favoring the steelers fuck this
another bullshit call
where was the hold they didnt even mention how that was a bs call whatever
refs dont wnat to fuck us over again here fuck them
what a shit call
steeler refs
i wish jackson wouldnt be friendly to pitt players hes too damn nice lol
love snead this year
hey ref hold these
snead pro bowl omfg
that wasnt holding these refs need to be checked
that looked in
now run it down the middle omg
ive said it before snead gets some flak but he always has our ass
i swear nfl refs and calling holding makes no sense they call the smallest stuff but guys get away with obvious holds
hollywood is just out there running around
hes in
bad throw
his right knee is down
damn thats close idk if its enough to overturn tho
thats a catch in real time and in slow come on now
are they actually going to ignore that laughable ghost hold
of course biased refs call it incomplete first and now there wont be enough evidence to overturn
dont think they would overturn either way with this one
i have no clue what to think here
offense showed up
i think knee was just on the line

edit if it were called a td they wouldnt overturn it but since it was called incomplete i think they might not overturn that either
you only need the shin the shin touched first this just happened to the rams earlier today
whatever happens after this game something needs to happen with our receiving core jesus man
the knee isnt obviouswe arent gonna get that
yeah were not winning this harbs challenged because hethe team had already used so much time thinking about it and looking at the jumbotron that they wouldve had to use a timeout anyway
its already been confirmed as not a td
i hate nfl refereeing that holding call against the ravens happens every fucking play in the nfl
doesnt matter we still got it lets go
brown town population 6
x200b

touchdown ravens
that one is good
took a little longer than we hoped but we got it anyway
review that
touchdown
yessssss
they took away a beautiful run by lamar

pain
shouldve had the td on the run but ill take it
cant take that one off the board ya cunts
im surprised ref did not try to break that pass
dont matter you whiney bitches
at least we ran some time off the clock silver lining i guess
that ones in bounds
that was fearless

what a route and what a throw
touchdown
call incomplete now motherfuckers
still got it lol
where all those dinguses at that said hollywood is too small
hollywood is a beast
back to him no foul refs no penalty
lets go defense
ill be damned i wasnt expecting this im pleasantly surprised
fuck yeahhh the offense stepped up lets goooooo boysssssssss
lamar is turning it up in the fourth stunt on them last 3 quarters
great drive prob gonna come down to the last one anyways
lamar making up for at least one of the ints with that drive some good plays to get that td
omg man
heart attack jackson i praise you and doubt you sometimes on the same play you have no dramatic equal ever
thats a horrible call

edit thank you they came to their senses
i fucking hate nfl referees
refs didnt fuck us celebrate
why did bonds give up on that
what the fuck was 38 doing
38 cant just stop
38 gonna get shit for that film walked away like it wasnt a catch
take that udfa outa there
who the fuck is bonds
these penalties are killing us man
undisciplined ass defence
get bonds tf outta here
who the fuck is bonds
is this the most undisciplined ravens squad of all time holy fucking shit
uh 38
get this fucking bonds bloke off the team
it wasnt bonds
just walk away wtf
lol bonds
get that fuckin random off the field
bonds whats the first thing they teach you in any sport
get this nigga bonds outta the fuckin game
who is this bonds guy get him out of here
get bonds off the field
oh clark yeah he face masked
damn i miss averett
where tf did bonds come from and why is he still on the field
bonds has played fine for a udfa cut him some slack
some generous spots
averett got injured as soon as he started playing good smh
man oh man were giving it away
how have we not picked off captain fat fuck yet
and another dpi fml
steelers shouldnt even be in this one with how bad they looked in the first half
throw it to ref at this point
stop with the fucking penalties jesus fucking christ
come the absolute fuck on with these pi penalties we deserve to lose this shit if they cant cut it out
omg the penalties
what the fuck is with these penalties
im about to get the dcell batteries out for these fucking refs
refs calling everything
refs on steelers payroll
were getting fucked by penalties
jesus
i didnt quite catch that last dpi penalty was it at all legit or what
someone cover the ref he about to run a route
hate refs
our 9 penalties to their 3
haha 85 penalties yards
are these pick plays legal
how they gonna put the softest refs on the ravenssteelers game
mother of all things holy what the fuck is this shit
unbelievable
can the offense learn some things from these screens and pick plays
fuck the refs man
just do not fucking go 3 and out here
alright lets do it again
this is the worst officiating ive seen in my life i think what an absolute joke holy shit
clutch moment
on their 3rd down screen conversion the steelers committed blatant opi right in front of the refs

no call
this has been a physical ass game i love it not a fan of losing but this has been a great game per usual when we play the steelers we gonna be alright guys
fuck the refs man
we need a long drive to give the d a rest
you cant take that many penalties and expect to get stops come on lamar mvp for a reason
these refs better have 5 or 6 calls lined up for us
we just need a clock eating drive capped off with a td pound the fucking rock
refs handing them the game so fucking stupid
they cant stop the run keep running please
brownies lost
last year id be excited to see this team run down the field but this year i feel like im having flacco ptsd my heart cant take these games
shit like this makes me not even want to watch the nfl when the refs just give them the game
its clear dobbins and gus are our best offensive players and we still try to force to andrews and hollywood
keep pounding the rock
gus bus lets fucking go boys
i am fucking in love with gus
lets gooo run it
truly amazing that running works who would have thought
just keep running the ball
keep running the ball
can this game please be the nail in the coffin for roman stubbornly keeping ingram as the 1 back
roman will pass now
yes keep running
look what happens when we fucking run i never would have guessed
ricard blocking his ass off
we going 2018 on these bastards
this guy is awesome i hope dobbins sticks around for awhile
well that was a missed facemask
we are so gonna win the big12 this year
keep running please
i will shit myself jk or gus scores they deserve it
fuck man dobbins heres my credit card not like youll need it
jk is ray rice 20 now without poor decision making ability when off of the field
who gives a fuck run run run
dont leave them any clock
this 3rd down makes me nervous
my heart cant handle this 3rd down
lamar to andrews for a td lets go
man the outside was there i think
so annoying
dont get it and the games over
go for it
my heart cant take this anymore lol
somebody hold me
the good thing is its only week 8but fuck this is nerve racking
jesus i swear we just dont want to win this game
lets fucking go my body is ready
belee
shouldnt have ran at 2nd down and 7 shouldve thrown the ball there

now we are backed into a tough spot on 4th and 3
this place is going to explode when we score this td
give it to dobbins
we need 3 yards and have run on them all game time to call an option run
time to pray for something big
let dobbins eat
im hoping for a steelers penalty somehow
that was the play they chose
they knew that was coming
what the fuck is our coaching staff doing
fire roman yo im done with this offense
fuck skura
and he fumbles it idiot
fire greg roman
what the fuck
another horrible playcall yikes
bruh
greg roman defenders in shambles
i fucking called it they ran it up the fucking gut
why would we run the most obvious fucking play thats gonna be a qb draw every time in this situation from 5 wide and they knew it
empty backfield really
smh lamartf u doing today
2 interceptions 3 fumbles 2 lost fumbles for lamar
5 wide draw go fuck yourself whoever is making that call
that was fucking dreadful
these runs up the middle are not fooling anybody
the whole stadium knew that was coming

huuuge call there bud
maybe defense can win this one
fuck that is all
that was so a desperate play gg
he win us some and lost us some too
i need humphrey doing humphrey things right now
need a miracle here
pathetic
shitty ass play call
well at least we didnt lose to cinci
steelersravens on thanksgiving night is going to be so much fun
im really curious about our success with 5 wide i dont think we ever have anything good come out of it
is cam heyward hurt or did he fake that bs to stop our momentum
cant blame the refs when your turning the fucking ball over
5 out on the 8 yard line you mean to tell me you would rather have our back up wideout on the field and not jk or gus enjoy your next team roman youre a fucking clown
defense
it aint over yet folks
eshhhhhkeeet
holy shit good stop
penalties and turnovers fucked us
queen i love you
wish we had timeouts
defense was great this is on lamar roman and the still sputtering offense
come on lamar
lamar i love for ever if we get this td
ron stanley died for this
block that kick
still dont trust roman
if we win here would this be lamars first gamewinning drive
lamar has only gone downfield once i say call a go for hollywood and take a chance
stay onsides
mvp time
i believe come on boys
so this is whats going to happen pitts brings the blitz and shreds our line game over
ravens d gotta love it ray and quick should be proud
greg roman down by 4 need a td no timeouts lets run it they will never expect it
chuck it to andrews or hollywood outside
my heart is going to fail
fuck bens smug fucking face
flacco check down
really dumb
andrews youre killing me
that was a bad throw by lamar andrews was wide open
clock it
time back on the clock
10k comments jfc
fucking bullshit by hayward
that helps us a lot here its a pitt to and could add time to the clock
injured defender is a timeout
either more time on the clock or penalty
this game has been brutal either way
time for some crazy lamar shit we need it now
im rooting for you guys from a bills fan
fucking classic ravens steelers match up ive missed these
no pi
thats a flag on 31
damn
our play calling from beginning to end just horrible we are constantly bailed out by the talent we have and thats been for multiple weeks not just today defense is a top 5 yet again i think our oline depth isnt as a glaring need than a true no 1 wr
fuck these fucking trump ads there are 4000 fans sitting in the bank but we took on this virus and beat it fuck off
not gonna lie tj watt is getting a lot of hits in on lamar and theyre not even warning him the refs are going to get our boy killed if they dont start calling shit fairly
and this is why that challenge was stupid should have conserved the timeouts
guys watt missed the tackle and his momentum took him into stanley chill
their plan will kill jobs


trumps covid failure has killed over 300000 people and we have record high unemployment
well i know game threads are known for exaggeration but if stanley is out for the season thats our season done
jackson aint going to survive this game
helmet to helmet call that shit
im pretty sure eject every player who touches a ref isnt in the rules but the officials can override the rulebook whenever they want with no consequences certainly is
fuck the ref pull your mask up dumbshit
funny how every team we play every week turns into perfect little angles who dont commit any fouls
removed
booing an injured player is a bad look
clearly should have put more time on the clock clearly should have given us a dpi call on the final play the refs were pretty unfair to us in this game

what up my dudes fuck the steelers
just pointing out the bias and hive mind bs but if that was boykin dropping that screen this sub would be losing its shit yall wanted duvernay after blaming boykin for bad throws week in and week out

but hey we cant say anything bad about lamar as he throws the easiest pick 6 some no name scrub has had in his entire career
ok tequila is out
fire roman he has taken a system that works well and created success and has butchered it for no reason its obvious that improvement is not coming
that was all on lamar
sidearm throw with no pressure no velocity clean pocket didnt step into the throw hes getting lazy with his fundamentals
this beer is 14 abv wowzers
yo some of yall are so delayed lmao
get rid of the ball
lamar gotta be aware of your surroundings man
watt is a dirty fucking player
im pissed that stanley is hurt but how can yall actually believe watt did that intentionally are you watching the same game as me
my dad just said that tj watt has little brother syndrome so fucking true
lamar is out there playing like a rookie and then we lose 2 ol players

if he doesnt learn how to throw now were not going to the playoffs
cant wait to see judon in another teams jersey
that was a bad call against judon though
that was unintentional he shouldnt be disqualified
judon has made a lot of dumb plays in the past but that wasnt one of them totally accidental
for the love of all that is holy please stop trying to turn the ball over lamar lol
pit has hurt 3 players in one half
refs trying to fuck is again
ravens are dominating the only ones keeping pittsburgh in this game so far is baltimore themselves
pittsburgh lucky as hell theyre not down 240
couple things

how this season is going im legitimately surprised any time we complete a pass at this point i had more confidence in that 51 fg just now than ive had on any of our pass attempts today



its all good though because the d is suffocating and the run is punishing
shit wasnt even catchable
jimmy got away with a lil hold ngl
idk why but always seeing lamar laugh it off whenever he fucks up makes me more upset than the mistake itself
this is all on roman why why throw why

im not defending the pass it was awful but that call should never have been made never
this is the worst game ive seen lamar play hes not even getting pressured on his ints this is embarrassing
this team really needs 1 ring before lamars rookie deal ends i am legit worried about his lack of growth as a passer reminds me of 2013 rg3
disgraceful referees fuck the nfl
the receiver ran off the field in disappointment thats how you know it wasnt pi at all fucking disgrace
jim look at mahomes make it look so easy
lamar is two more ints away from getting benched
cant wait for all the hot takes about how lamar
sure lets run a fucking option on 3 and long
im sorry ngakoue you havent come to the contenders that you had originally thought
the whole offense is to blame cant pin it on just one person literally everyone has fucked up
in all honestly though this is a damn good defense were playing
these cuck refs are doing everything they can can typical
its a td but refs wont give it to us kinda like how the hallucinated skuras hold
thats not a td guys his knee is clearly out of bounds
claypool fake af with that pi on humphrey next time earn a td
elite qbs go take the lead right here

and then have the defense give up a game winning drive culminating in an antonio brown td on christmas
where the fuck has this gameplan been

we are adjusting on the fly and attacking sticking to what we do best where was this against lac ten and kc why dont or cant we do this every game
two wide open targets across the middle and lamar gets happy feet for 2 yards

just not very good today
fire greg roman who goes empty on 4th down with gus and jk lmao i fucking hate this teams coaching staff
play calling ruined the game
damn so many bandwagon fans in this thread wo lamar this team wouldnt be shit
snead i love you
andrews was fucking walking there run your fucking route
lol no sympathy for him after pulling that fake injury earlier to buy the steelers time
fucking gifted a win
how do you not add time bull shit
fuck these refs and these cheating steeler bastards
hit to the head shouldnt have been called but absolutely would have been against us
can the player of the blame be this crappy refereeing
we cant expect too much with turnovers and penalties
lets be honesttheir play calling seems almost wwe
stanleys out for the year
we beat ourselves today shot our own foot but the bright side is that we know what we gotta do to keep winning i aint worried just keep running the ball minimize mistakes and get revenge on thanksgiving
can yall stfu now i dont like watt but he didnt do it on purpose
lamar was robbed that rushing td
removed
but were still 51 right guys we shouldnt complain right guys itll all come together right guys
ah ew fuck its another trump ad fuck off trump i dont give a shit about this or you
can you guys stfu about roman he got a single pass and people are calling for his head acting like he called a ridiculous double end around flea flicker to nick boyle deep

if you cant trust your qb to not make these mistakes idk what you want him to do
well rebuild this nation with strength


bruh trump needs 2 hands to drink a glass of water and can barely walk down the stairs without tripping
fuck tj dude late hits all day accidentally falls into the back of the knees of one of the best tackles dirty fucker
ravens 24

refslamar 28
i fucking hate wattfeels like he plays to hurt people
people are fucking dumbasses for thinking that was a dirty play by watt
our line needs to kill tj watt
and not a word about tucker being the goat from romo that guy is such a douche
im throwing my tv out the window if i see another trump ad why is he wasting money in md he has no shot of winning here
i think fans have forgotten that roman is only good for about 2 seasons before he becomes stagnant look at the kapernick 49ers they had a hot run then fell off lamar is a talent among talents and were probably gonna be 61 after this game but the fact remains that we shouldve signed ab to give lamar an actual wr1 instead of trying to turn a slot like a hollywood into a 1 because he isnt one
we have to run the ball
our pass offense is non existent i hope you idiots that thought we were actually working on the pase game shut up from here on out we dont have a pass game period
was that a good enough pass for you fairweathers
booing an injured player not classy
the refs are slowly killing the game they dont even know their own effing rules
we gotta remember we actually looked really good for most of that game take away one of those picks mistakes happen but cant let them keep happening and some terrible calls by the refs and thats a game we dominate you cant say the season is over after watching that
fuck tj watt all my homies hate tj watt
that roll up by watt wasnt purposeful stop wishing for his injury
man all yall are acting like this isnt the rivalry game of the nfl even when the steelers are bad this game is a dog fight man quit whining and have faith in the kings of the north stanley injury is a good reason to be upset but we have a full game here
go go go go go no you moron good job
tj watt is a dirty piece of shit
fuck the steelers

all my homies hate the steelers
get tj watt off my damn screen they should show the highlight of lamar stiff arming him into the ground
wide open down the sideline and he wants to throw the spot when theres 2 defenders around nice
that 2nd down play call was beyond fucking moronic

run the goddamn ball greg you twat
lamar just wont take safe passes he forces the first option he needs to be coached into working a passing game properly it doesnt seem like the offensive staff is willing to develop him
good job on giving us the 1st maybe they stop hitting as late after that
this is gunna be dez in a few weeks bois toss it up to dez
its not the fact hes turning the ball over that happens

its the fact its happening on avoidable shit like a late throw when someone else is open or tripleclutching come on man
stop throwing the damn ball rushing outside works on them
delay of game
we can move the ball good it looks like we just have to hold onto it
done this o line is swiss cheese now
was that a dirty hit to look like an accident
thats more than likely the season for him definitely wasnt intentional on watt
lamar making terrible decisions out there i think hes just trying to make too much happen by himself but damn what a reckless throw
watt has always been a dirty player watch his college highlights always went low for the knees and ankles
this game has been super lopsided so far but the scoreline doesnt show it because of that pick 6
not asking for a flag but thats head to head contact
what dirty pieces of shit that team is actively encouraging injuries
how was that hit from fitzpatrick not a penalty he led with his helmet and hit lamar in the helmet

edit i wasnt aware of the rule that he was a runner thanks for clarifying fam
these refs are such pansys
ref fucking sold that one fuck that
i really dont enjoy the judon slander on this sub hes done everything weve asked of him plays a way more versatile role than most edge players
fuck gus bus may have a flat
are we worried about lamar yet what is going on with him lately
do not blame that on boykin
harbaugh needs to talk to roman after this game i swear were good for at least 23 illegal formations or illegal shifts a game
say something romo
got away with that one
get roman the fuck out of baltimore
why is lamar smiling after that mistake
welcome back into the game

love
lj
awesome that we are terrified for our qb to throw the ball on any play
it would help if lamars best receiver wasnt a te that everyone knows he going to go to because the others arent getting separation
this offense is so stale under roman i think we can assume last year will never happen again it was the outlier
our mental is broken that interception was fucking terrible
enough of this soft zone bullshit please you may as well just lay down and let ben squat and take a shit on all of your collective chests
whaaattsss up fellow ravens fans time to smash that self destruct button
so jealous of their wr corp

fuck
how the fuck are they losing this game why does lamar always turn to complete shit in every big game jeez man
bro wtf is our play calling we go into half gashing them up the middle and gro decides nah lets abandon the 1 thing that was working for us literally have this issue every game idk why were tryna be cute
lets take judon and roman to a farm upstate
cut dead weight roman judon justice hill all of our olb corps

its sad when snead is our best wr and our best play other than the gus bus is a 34yd pass

whens the last time weve had an absurdly long td last season
why dont we run on 2nd and 8
i dont know why we keep going empty lol its just a giant sign that were definitely throwing the ball and they can sell out
stop blaming this whole game on play calling our receivers fucking suck if they cant run a slant thats their fault not romans
love it ravens do good while in working come out on lunch to a choke fest fucking love it
no matter what happens today or the rest of this seasonwe can all take comfort in knowing theres no chance in hell roman will be the oc next year
duvernay proche and dez need to replace these bum ass receivers we have starting
bum ass fucking refs there needs to be an investigation into the refs after this game
regardless that is unnecessary the throw was so bad
there is no reason it should be this close
that play right there is the perfect example of great design by roman but shit execution on the field
steelers should lose a timeout for that injury
dont say roman doesnt call runs when were down lol
good afc news is titans might lose and browns lost
dobbins was open man
fire roman
running was the right call just not having lamar run it good game pittsburgh
that is on greg roman shit call emptied the damn backfield
what an awful game lamar and play calls
greg roman is still a hack
aint over quite yet my friends
should have kept running
please stop booing hes probably actually hurt
wtf are they booing heyward
unfathomable that time was not added
burn in hell steelers
im mad at lamar but im more angry at roman
a lot of people in here cursing watt but i didnt see any way it was intentional on his part
steelers are playing dirty as fuck
oh fuck this is a trump ad on my gamepass ew
another bonehead play from lamar dude is hesitating way too much
tj watt didnt even do anything lmao


guy was doing his job tackling lamar and unfortunately rolled into stanleys ankle i get being pissed in the heat of the moment especially with the way tj has been playing today already but this one aint on him
lamar shrinks in big games 2 turnovers in the first quarter beyond disappointing
tj watt is such a dirty fucker
get watts cock out of your ass romo
lamar has been playing poorly but it all starts with roman immediately abandoning the run after the ravens dominated the steelers by basically running it every down
pros defense got the ball back to lamar


cons lamar now has the ball
better throw had the td
its so easy to see how kc and la got sick of peters being either a hall of famer or a street free agent on any particular play
man coming off the best cod since bo1 in mw and then announcing it as a cold war game my hype for cod was through the roof but the beta sucked and everything i see about it just looks so lacklustre very disappointing
trade ingram and judon
clock mismanagement if we lose what a fuck up
lamar lost us this game and some of you cant handle that
i love lamar but today fuck him
and fuck these trump commercials
stuck overseas and gamepass wont show the game for some reason can anyone link me to a stream
my body is ready
bill cowher is a fucking hack
bro the wont get off the steelers dick at all this amazing d lost to rg triple sticks
ravens 31 steelers 17
in jedem sub wo trolle baiten

gibts leute die auch steelers haten

und ist das sub auch noch so klein

die steelers solln gehated sein
am i like the only one here that is like fucking hyped that we have romo lol i miss him so much
ngl i thought we were the underdogs today
of course theres bad weathersigh hope lamar can throw a wet ball today
fuck the stealers lets get that dub
lets goooooo
i dont think its healthy how much impact days like today have on my overall happiness in life
lets goo bitches
lamar body by banana ben body by fried nanner
lets go boys gotta play physical and disrupt their timing offense has to attack their aggressive blitz
here we go monkas
gulp here we go
lego
good to see at least a few people in the stands
all aboard the gus bus
lets fucking go
lets do this
lets gooooo
these fucking screens wtf
im glad they kept the mo in the end zone and not just one and done
that play was getting blown up regardless
awful lamar throw 1 of the day
fuck
awful throw
yikes
wtf wtf
lol this is quite trash
well fuck this is gonna get rough
lol wow when you defer that is the start you want
thats not ideal
oof
todays my bday i can care less about gifts i just want my ravens to get a dub and hand the steelers their first loss lets gooooooo
wtf just happened
bruh
dont think thats how you start an nfl game
oktime to get one of those ourselves
atrocious throws so far
watt always taking shots
oof we get 3 plays of enjoying this game it feels like lol
okay lets try this again
okay boykin more of that please
not ideal
that wasnt the greatest start
lol absolutely pathetic two weeks to prepare coming off the bye
great throw and catch by boykin
great throw
is it gonna be one of those games again
lol how long till we abandon the run
finally
late hit
watt is trying to rip his legs out
i was going to say how was not a late hit
throw the fucking ball
well thats a gift
steelers corners not even looking at the receivers outside backs are turned to them daring them to throw anything outside the numbers
oof this is rough
these penalties again
another penalty for our 100 million dollar man feels good
damn these olbs are hitting lamar in every down
wow we do not look like a team that had a bye what the fuck
2 drops already even though that second one is negated by a penalty
good lord its gonna be one of those games fml
this offense is fucked
its going to be a long day on offense
i really questioning trading hurst tbh
just because lamar gets the ball doesnt mean hes establishing himself as a runner he cant be hit every time he hands the ball off
snead so damn slow lmao
x200b

willie snead for 34yards
need for snead
snead with a nice run
great presence by lamar that play
i hope we abuse spillane the rest of the game
i am slowly beginning to regret taking lamar 3rd overall in fantasy this year
snead appears
bless you boys
please get 7 and not 3
you know theyre going to be whining about that legit roughing the passer
there we go
still a sidearm throw though wtf mechanics

i also think we need to use snead better i feel bad for him
fucking hell theyre wasting these downs
i hate that naked bootleg shit
wtf
thank you
welcome back boykin
boykin im sorry
boykin did something nice
dotttttt
boykin welcome back my man
what a throw
damnit phillips
boykin was reading reddit and he like okay im going off today
ok boykin
lamar needs to run that
jesus christ
nice fucking catch boykin

dez who
these plays fuckin suck
time to break ben
but guys were gonna lose
letsss gooo
gorgeous throw
boykins really showing up today
we got our self a game
there we go look at how we misdirect when we fucking run 2x then pass
big boy boykin
l l a m a


l a s e r
im excited to see this defense with ngakoue
shouts out boykin once again
thank you what an answer
great play for the corner td
ngakoue time
great fucking throw
yay fuck the steelers
like that we turned this into a long drive pick six meant the defense had to stay on the field almost 7 minutes to start the game start wearing them out early
boykin always just needed to learn to run routes his physical stats are good he just needs route running
our turn for a turnover
we needed that did not want to settle for 3 there and it is really good to see lamar dropping dimes again that was a great drive for our overall confidence
lamar is way cooler than me ya gotta love seeing shrug off a horrible mistake and drove right down the field
that was a great call there they brought a lot of pressure and lamar stayed calm now the defense needs to come out and do what the steelers did to start
lets foooooooo
glad the bois bounced back forget that first interception its a new game
that was a beautiful pass
flair up
youre a pussy jake from state farm
welcome back to football myles
big day yannick come on
this game is giving me angina
low key loving how tight this game is already
what is the percentage of kick returns that have an illegal block in the back called on them
bruh tua got sack stripped dont even care lets goooo ravens
that drive wouldve died out and been a 3 and out with most other qbs in the nfl
james conner too slow to turn the corner against our lbs
remember when ebron said he was the best te in the division lmao

bruh
what the fuck did he do
wtf peters you dumbass
steelers fans didnt yall just complain about flags youre wrs soft
uncatchable and he didnt really do anything
thats such bull
were even now
kind of a weak call ngl but not awful either
that wasnt catchable wtf
butwhere
i wonder if the steelers sub will recognize how bs that call wasbut probably not
what
wooooo
thats baby soft
fuck yeaaaaaaa
lets fucking goooooo
lets gi
payback bishhh
claypool is a bitch
fumbleeeee
fumble
lets go peters thats a competitive man
marlon been teaching marcus his craft over the bye
way to make up for that peters

claypool is a great player that hustle was incredible even if the call stands that we get the ball
i love this defense
we knew this was going to be one of those games its rainy kinda disgusting weather and it feels like the rivalry is back if anyone expected it to be easier for either side then i want you are smoking snorting boofing what have you
get fed claypool
mp juicemannn
i like how they bring 4 and lamar gets maybe 15 seconds meanwhile we bring 7 and ben has 2 seconds to throw that
i wanna see a deep shot
way to attack the ball peters lets goooo
most importantly ball dont lie
lets fucking go marcus peters woooooooooo
oh no
man that has got to hurt

hope tyre is ok
fuck
fuck our already weak oline is about to get weaker
love watching tj watt launch himself into the backfield taking himself out of the play
speed kills
jk
jk the man fuck yeah
steelers fan here i hope hes ok i want to beat you guys fair and square
dobbins is so good
dobbins is electric
someone on here said dobbins would finish this drive sooooo close but he set up this drive and deserves a chance
dobbins is a future top 5 rb in the league so explosive
jk
if bozeman couldve got his block jk mightve been able to stay inside and take it
jk
this man is a fucking superstar

go dobb go
jk my boy
wow jk running sideways
lol jk
big boy no little boy
jay kay all day
bro jk is so good
dobbins is nasty
theres the run game i love
yo lamar changing plays is making me wet
f f f
i cant believe we were able to draft jk dobbins
jk dobbins is absolutely a joy to watch
let jk cook
okay guys we might have drafted a legit great rb
yuck
i cant
god dammit
okok
what are you doing lamar
jesus christ this game is gonna be crazy
jesus christ man
lamar come on
lamar needs to chill with the pump fakes
at least pit is pinned back
please just keep running maybe
get a safety
we need to be running more rub plays to open guys down in the redzone too
really bad spot there
man that is a back breaker that deep
chuck took a bad angle on that run
interesting play call for them must have been miscommunication
lets go d
3rd and 10 thought that was a tackle for a loss
weve had good field position all game
lol bad spot too
get off the field
so i just read about a pie that has a berger cookie filling and now i need 7
thats like a 5 yard fuck up by the ref
the defenses have come to play lol offense not so much
awful punt but cool
come on shot to hollywood plz
lamar is so much more deer in headlights this year where the fuck is the option
there you go
theres mvp lamar
great play dont force shit use your legs
see lamar thats why you run my guy
omfg
oh no
oh shit
fuck
fuck
jesus fucking christ
are you fucking kidding me
oh god no
noooooooo ronnieeeee
nononononononononononononononononono
fuck hes in a lot of pain
no please
god no not stanley
these plays are disgusting
mother fucking mother fucking
oh my god
fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck
there goes the 100 million dollar man
our online is bad enough as it is already dangit
oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck
not stanley fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuuuuuuuuck
please god no
this is not good
fuck no no no no no no no
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
welppack in boys

fuck we really need an oline
shitty play call by roman lead to a traffic jam resulting in stanleys injury smfh
fuck that looks bad
fuck
fuuuuuuck
this is not ideal
fuuuuuuuuuckkkkkkkk
figures
fuckfuckkkkkkkkkkk fuck me bro
i need more alcohol fuck
jesus fuck no
no noooooooo

fuck
omg no
fuck
his ankle
noooooooooooo
and thats fucked
well this went as poorly as it could have
welp its over
fuck
its a wrap for our o line smh
pause forfeit
his leg im gonna be sick
damnit
holy shit fuck tj watt cut his fucking legs the rest of the game
damn his season is over
of course it was watt
that is broke no doubt
oh what do you know steelers aggressive hits are hurting players
yikes bro our oline going to be terrible now
ah thats the season lets hope the surgery goes well or the window has closed
thats an ankle his ankle is fucked
fuck 2020 no one is safe
also can we talk about how the refs blow the whistle too early so instead of lamar making a play and getting the ball out for an incompletion they get an 8 yard sack lol
2 lineman who get rolled up on in a quarter is just fucked man his knee is gone be lucky to be back by training camp
lamar with no wrs and now no line too
next man up
shit not ronnie
i cant handle this
thats broken
that stanley injury looks badi dont see how its not a serious injury
out for the season no doubt so glad dude got his money tho man this fucking sucks lose 2 players in 1 game
not like this not like this
brown to lt fluker at rt again
damn new contract too
depending on how bad this is that really might be the season
lets hope he is ready for next seasom
damn im tearing up watching him go off the field
who the ravens trading for on oline now now 2 huge holes at g lt
edc needs to get us an oline stat
still have time to make a trade
nooo
fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
nothing a shot cant fix in this league s
dang love that guy
at least get a field goal
ive been having a shit last few days so it was fucking inevitable
there is only one person on the team more important then stanley
ok greg lets see a play to get 910 yards and a fg
christ i hope hes okay guys freak injury
wouldnt some screens make sense against the steelers aggressive front 7
i really dont wanna watch this offense without ronnie
malik harrisons pre draft stuff is so weird to me now he flashes plenty of speed and quickness you would have thought he was slow as shit
thjs feels like fake punt territoy
defense playing really well think top will wear down steelers need to keep running still in a good spot
thank god we have at least some tackle depth
just a sloppy game all the way around
keep forgetting to breathe
ben looks a bit off
i think we get a bonefide guard and try all other options at lt
our offense has completely kept them in this game even before ronnie went out
that pick 6 to the scrub lb was such a killer mistake the steelers offense isnt very good in general and havent done anything today so far cant spot them points

roman needs to draw up some designed runs for lamar back the defense up and go to play action so the receivers actually have a chance to get open
need to get andrews and hollywood involved the game on this drive
the way this game is going if we can score 2 touchdowns and add a field goal we will win going to be tough due to their dline might be in line for a justin tucker game winner here
lets keep doing that
truss the buss
good run by the gusbus
we have the defense to win a championship
lol seriously can we please just keep running the ball
for all the whining their offense looks just as bad or worse
all week i thought this game would be won by our defense shutting down their offense
boys were finally running the god damn football isnt it beautiful
keep the run game you cowards
we need to tank for joe burrow
gus is gonna get payed somewhere soon
thats why we need to run
pound their bungholes with these runs
keep running it
gus and jk thats all we need today
have to score our defense is playing far too well to only be tied
this bus dont stop
just run the ball and rely on tucker
its crazy that mark ingram starts over gus and dobbins
still mad gus only got 3 carries vs the titans
didnt even make a good rush there and still got 56 yards
fucking ground pound it works
wobbins
top defense my ass run it down these stupid motherfuckers throats
just run the ball every play from here on out
gus gonna truck tj
silver lining is that our oline wasnt horrible with this tackle formation the previous game for stanley still thats about as big a loss as our season could have besides lamar
we need to keep running until they stop us
dobbins is literally ray rice hes so strong for his size
this is why you fuckin run greg thank you please keep this up
holy shit hes quick dude took off
these down hill runs are stunning their overly aggressive d line lets keep it going
i love ingram but gus and dobbins are better
dear lord where has this play been all year
this is looking like our offense last year
this drive looking like 2019
just keep running the ball with all these ol out keep it simple and just run
steelers adjusting 8 in the center of the field and win 7 of los lamar takes outside
we angry
4 yards x 3 is 1st down lets go pound that shit
literally run every sigle play
i love this dont stop running until they stop it
run angry run for ronnie
you love to see it
so theyre just running the football down the field

you dont say
vintage jackson
keep running it
steelers d line making me scared of injuries just diving their weight on our players legs
i was just about to say i want lamar to keep the ball on runs too lets get these three running
run run run
please pound it
richard is a blocking machine
run opened that up lotta center field action
crazy what happens when you establish the run roman you fucking tool
give dobby the ball
wow about fucking time roman figured out running the ball and throwing to the te is good
quick passes and run thats gotta be our offense without ronnie
lamar got popped at the line
are we going back to last years playbook with ronnie out
runnnnnn
we back
crown of the helmet to the head runner or not where is the call for that dirty fucking bastards
its simple run that damn ball and we get easy completions
fuck the steelers
fuck yeah running the ball
i fucking loved that drive hell yea baby
touchdown
that was a goddamn drive guys
they worked out that passing plays are better when you have to respect the run
that should be a td
ouch
see what happens when you run the ball roman
gus is a fucking monster
gus bus
should be 217 if we didnt fumble last time in the red zone
fuck you shittsburgh eat the fucking run
great fucking drive keep running down their throats
keep smashing it down their throat dont let off
lets go d look them up
the gus bus is fueled up and ready to roll
take that shitsburgh
lets gooo
might have gus be my first jersey
thats raven football right there
im not going to bother looking it up but i feel like this is the least ive seen ben play in a ravens game ever their offense is nonexistent you hate to see it
sticking to our guns roman making the adjustments
run
the
ball
yes back to the basics and our identityrunning the fucking ball
this is what you get when you run the ball lets go
so what if the d keeps up and we can run it like were seeing well be fine weve turned it over twice lets settle in and get back to the historic rushing attack we know we have
so grateful for gus hed be a starting rb on just about any other team
left ankle for stanley
turnovers aside were looking great on both sides of the ball right now
keep fucking running the best run offense last year ever for a reason
run the ball time of possession and we can win every game fuck the steelers
lets get the o back on the field and keep running it on their gased defense
turns out if you play to your strengths good things can happen huh
aw mcalister sizzle ray matty s

brings a tear to your eye
make these fuckers swallow the fucking ball
bens passing hasnt looked good todayi think we have a pick in us
it pains me a little that it took ronnie getting injured for roman to change up the scheme like why tf wouldnt what we are doing now work with stanley hint it would be better you twat
ingram could have a hard time getting back to a starting spot gus and jk both are both doing it all big plays grinding on 1st and falling forward to turn losses into 34
love to see conner with two hands on the ball the entire time because hes scared of marlo punching it out
haha coach and player having a little heated discussion
are they playing for pis lol
gotta love how the jets of all teams are playing the chiefs closer than we did come on harbs roman and wink this is not ok
can someone who knows more about sports injurieso lineman tell me about stanley ankle is better than knee right
its not over till the fat lady sings figth defense figth
dammit
is yannick playing today
marlon is heated
i love me some mcphee
pernell really set the edge there
anyone surprised judon was the one who gets flagged
looked like judon hit the ref
should offset
this is nothing or offsetting flags lets keep the game moving please
ok maybe we can keep judon
fuck judon
fuck
typical way the steelers get back in a game
bullshit
this is horrible
cut judon
fuck
thats fucking bullshit
little boy no big boy got punked love peters on this play
fuck the refs flopping
stupid ass
ok not supporting that one didnt realize he hit an official thats dumb as shit
that was so damn stupid
trade judon
what
i never want judon back on the field again for the ravens
judon being retarded again
ah classic ravenssteelers
judon ejected from the game im not too upset about that
wow what a half
i knew he was out of the game
judon cmon dude
wtf
i guess well see how much we need or dont need judon now
id cut him
dont let the door hit you on the way out matt
judon is fuckin dumb
wow dumb
well its not like well notice if judon is or isnt on the field
cmon judon
fuck me thats dumb there but johnson over there shoving coaches no problem
judon upgraded from roughing the passer to being thrown out of the game
judumb
judon officially in the dog house and gone
the bullshit chant came back for a few seconds there lol
i think judon just sent himself out of town after the season
big props to the fans getting a bullshit chant going
holy shit
fucking lose 3 starters in one game jesus fucking christ
mcphee judon
calais camwall
soft call but he made contact whilst swinging and it is what it is
oh no its a 3rd and long
lol 54 skipping them back on that penalty
this is one intense damn game
ive seen guys get ejected for less contact than that against refs its basically the only thing these guys ever call consistently
sure is a good thing the steelers offense is so fucking bad lol
absolute horseshit call
its ok daddy mcphee will save us
elliott baby

joker time
lets go
elliot
ofcourse the steelers playing chippy and they punish you guys
ben isnt even asking to get hit like this
gobble was the right verb to use for ben
tucker could hit it from there
4min drill time we can get some points before the half and were in good shape
defense is fucking balling
now keep on running that ball boys run that rock
notice how successful we are when we press receivers at the line strayed away from it this year and its cost us
i wanna see hollywood make an appearance
judson has more ejections than sacks in the past 3 weeks
so do the refs start calling all the dirty hits on lamar now
disaster of a game so far and still up

pick 6 redzone fumble stanleyphillips injury and judon getting ejected
this steelers offense is the most toothless ive seen led by ben in a while
the only thing thatd surprise me at this point is ben not getting hurt
ben hurting knew it called it last night
great run keep it up
need a long time killing drive that results in any amount of points to end the half they get the ball back so a 2 score buffer will be super important
theyre now doing what they did against rg3 last year

theyre gonna pretend they didnt see lamar hand the ball off just to hit him
come on llama
lol jackson got stripped by the air nice first down pickup
jackson with the boller impression unassisted fumble
plz dont scare me like that lamar
lamar stripped himself
sheesh get this man a towel
tuck that ball on a day like this lamar
yo what awareness by lamar to fall on that though
jeeesus lamar dont scare us
that dude tuitt is fuckin huge lol good lord
lamar please dont do that again
man lamar trying to give me a heart attack
yoooo wtf is this ball
gotta tuck it but that was weird as fuck not like lamar even hit it with his own body definitely some wetballitis
keep it simple

keep doing what were doing on d

up the gut on offense

let tucker kick the game out of reach
god i hope the ravens beat the steelers that would put them in such a better place
awareness its wet hold the like a rb
someone proposed to his gf first game back


i just realized that was lamars first ever pick 6
fuck me
man lamar
not an int
jesus lamarbut no catch
is that boykin late on his route again
boykin wtf man
that was so close my god
wasnt on lamar one hell of a play
lamar no
dont even throw the ball for the rest of the game idc
ball hit the ground but damn what an effort by haden
what in the hell is lamar doing throwing that
incomplete
terrible throw by lamar what was he doing there
this is exactly what a steelers ravens game should be and i cant even enjoy it because of stanley fuck
hit the ground no way thats an interception
that ball hit the ground
boykin has to come back to those
the invention of the forward pass was a mistake
shit throw

rravens lamars playing perfectly
thats coming back everyone breath
thank god that hit the ground bailed out lamar
this is a bloody long game lmao
he didnt have possession
really bad throw glad its coming back we got lucky af
categorically not a pick but i bet they give it to them anyway
no way thats standing
you didnt have your hand under it you cheating fuck
what the fuck is lamar doing today
run the ball
thats incomplete
thank fuck
why is this taking so long
i mean he made the right read your man is huge let himbox out but that throw was really really bad
just run the damn ballplease i dont care if lamar or whoever runs it just run it
refs be like call stands pittsburghs ball
were winning but aaaaa
our run game is pretty lethal so far in this game is justice hill active i know they said gus was a little hurt so do we have another active back
man if he hadnt run into zeus he couldve kept going
man penalties have been a big issue for us
sloppy
tomlin crying on the sidelines gives me energy
seriously what is up with these illegal formations
illegal shift i think andrews not set
that was a great play
weve been getting so many presnap penalties on offense this year its insane
can we figure out how to play football
been having way too many formation and shift penalties this year thats coaching
what in the ever living fuck
shift not formation
worst refs weve faced this year today or the chiefs game

at least the steelers have gotten screwed a time or two i guess
wheres all those idiots who want hayden hurst back instead of jk
great throw away tj has been an issue all day
not a bad throw away
o line not playing good gets lamar skittish and makes panicked throws its not rocket science my guys
needed a better throw there lamar woulda been near fg range
just dont get that why split dobbins wide run a jet sweep with hollywood and give it to dobbins on the fake
its so slippery passing is going to be useless
most steelers vs ravens games have ended with 1 score this will be close
play it safe we have tucker
garbage spot
lamar constantly has someone in his face
damn the refs fucked him
3 players with 50rushing yards nice
he got out of bounds but ok
tuck wink
automatic systematic
absolutely dominant half without the turnovers
that ball wouldve been good from 65 easy
goat doing goat things
tucker can have my babies
exactly down the middleman is a kicking god
horrible half and we up 10 we are ok guys
god hes so good that couldve gone fucking 60
are they fuckin serious with that whistle
fuck the steelers
and dobbins needs more carries dudes a stud pound for pound ill take him over kcs rookie
ill take it up 2 possessions defense gotta keep balling and keep running lets fucking go
that was an extra point for him
jk is a monster
tucker is the


romo didnt say shit about the kick either lmao
no best in the league from romo
to quote a certain gif from this week steelers offense ass
who gets ball after half
they get the ball i want the ravens to f them up big time
thought they said it best at halftime this is good ugly afcn football everyone sit back take a breather and say fuck the steelers
i am loving how the ravens running game looks right now the ravens really looking strong coming out of the bye injuries suck but i never thought the team would look fine after losing ronnie stanley ravens defense hasnt allowed any points i think lamars passing game is being affected by the weather but so is bens they havent got anything going in the air or on the ground im a little nervous about the steelers 2 minute offense so i just hope we can widen the gap a little more in the third quarter
dude was wide open
ngakoue scared him
rg tyre phillips has been ruled out with an ankle injury ravens
good job bowser
good d jimmy
johnson tried to torrey it
play the ball not the body idiot
lets score on these fuck bois
i feel like you dont deserve the call when you slow down immediately and dont keep trying to make the play
great coverage by bowser
captain fatfuck looks washed
surprised the ref didnt mark the ball at the 3 yard line
fuck you fat ben thats revenge for that garbage pi earlier on mp
wanting a penalty there for that weak shit
is hollywood playing
dude
well
just run
gdi lamar
lamar has been straight up bad
lamar a liability in this game
run the ball
y
big dumb
jesus lamar
what a gift
are you fucking kidding me
worst game of lamars career
lamar reverting to the mean in one game
i guess we just want to let the steelers back into the game huh
why are we throwing
thats a forced pass based on the play call but man og man i thought only linebackers in madden could do that what a play
lamar wtf man
jesus titty fucking christ
team please just grind them down
defense needs to hold them to three
no effort
ball shouldnt have been thrown play shouldnt have been called
fuck sakes
why do we help shit teams like this if we run the ball 3 times and punt they still have 0 offensive production
lamar just didnt step into that throw no reason not to
tf is this play calling
wtf is this defense doing
gonna need a juice punch there
w h y
run the ball
i still think we win but if we dont win this game that interception is the reason
probably queen smh
jackson seemed to handle that unprofessionally makes it hard to not read into the coaching situation
steelers only points have been gifted to them by lamar
gifting these bums the game
im glad at least is was over quick

still havent learned yet
ugh
sloppy ass turnovers
ok testing my liver wish me luck
past couple of weeks id call lamar a net negative come on bro
man i swear we have a bipolar oc
fucking lamar man
just get back to pounding the rock and we good
hey team can we not be dumb dumb in the 2nd half please
does it really take this long to straighten this out
empty backfield
hey um where the fuck is hollywood you know our number one receiver
i thought we agreed we arent doing that anymore
hahahahaha
i still want to see roman call an outside run or 2 i havent seen many this game but i think the few that they did worked lol
sad that pits secondary has been burnt by some fast wrs the last couple weeks but i mean us throwing 10 yards down the field lol
averett would never
that is awful
that call was bullshit
thats bullshit
here we go
why is lamar playing like hes a 60 rated qb on madden comeon man step it up

edit spelling
clark got sonned
how was that a pi
ah ok their game plan is just to have ben chuck it to draw flags got it cute
still playing against the refs too
how is that a pen
fuck this fucking game
moving the ball with ease
where did our defense go
what the fuck are queenboard doing they just sat there and watched him sit in the zone
why are we just letting them have every single catch
whyd we stop blitzing
please get a takeaway
fuck this

god fucking dammit dude
did steelers not address rb in the offseason connersamuels is a very meh tandem
smhravens
this particular game feels like the 2010 playoff game
with the way lamar is playing and how our defense cant stop them now i dont see us winning this
i cant even put it in to words whats going one feels like we have dominated
run that football
welp lamars fault for this one shitted away a potential blowout game
time for the offense to pull up their big boy pants and do something the get the momentum back
no way is this on the defense that was the only td they have given up this game is on lamar so far he has to be able to close it out and get the win if not most of the blame is on him
its a combo
we are predictable
this is on jackson but its also on roman
crunch time lets go
lamar directly responsible for 17 points two ints and missed fg attempt at least in the red zone facepalm
late hit
was planning to watch this game sober

ive uhchanged my mind for the remainder
why is pittsburgh taking late hits on their best player of the game
fuck it i blame madden
oh so were not calling run plays anymore huh
time to answer the call
roman we shouldve ran it on the first play of that drive thats wtf im talking about
qtr scoring streak on the line
i miss last year
designed runs
fuck sakes mandrews
thank god that play was crazy omg
my heart cant take this
i saw that coming a mile away we are playing so sloppy off a fucking bye
saw that coming
lucky play
running the ball is only going to get you so far
who else screamed behind you to andrews hoping he could hear us but wont lol
no no you dint bring the ball back nothing says that it should be brought back
so we run now outstanding galaxy brain fucking logic i am upset and my day is ruined
fuck me raw everyone needs to focus more on offense andrews has to feel that pressure and protect the football
fire greg roman
we had 130 rushing yards in the first half and now were dropping to throw every down
what the fuck was that roman
this is pathetic
so whats up with this sidearm throw i really dont like it looks so unnatural
no justice no block
the fuck kind of play call is that lmfao
not touching watt at all is a big nono
paper tigers
why does it seem like we always get the worst reffing of the year in steelers games
we need a turnover here
i talk shit about chris moore but hes an excellent special teamer
this second half offense is trash this second half defense is garbage

you guys blaming one and not the other arent watching the same game i am
im 1000 better lmao my ass
i swear watt isnt even touched lol
3rd and 8 alright buddy we are going to run the option
damn is this gonna be our first nonscoring quarter
lol my streams are juiced
run the fucking ball
pitt scores here the game is over
yikes that was really bad man defense is going to have to step up and win the game for us
please get a takeaway
greg roman did not run when we were up 17 7 now he is calling run plays smh
our run play design is okay pass play design needs work but i think the actual play call sequencing is hurting the most right now i would love to keep roman on as a run game coord and let someone else call the plays if possible
we need to get them off the field and fast so we can play our game dont get cute run it
the d has to win the game for us
still cant get to the qb ben has too much time
come on lamar shift the momentum here
good run proche
thank goodness our defense is more than decent
cleveland with 2 field goals lol
so so thankful for this defense
we are due for a comeback
i havent heard the name ngakoue yet this game makes me sad
good stop defense

offense dont turn the ball over plz
you would think the game is over if you only read this thread guys theres a lot more football to be played relax
on the bright side the titans are losing by 17 to the bengals and the browns are losing by 10 to the raiders
lets goooooo defense wink knew the screen was coming great fucking job
ughhh
ffs
man what happened
just sat there and ate the fucking sack
oline not even attempting to block anymore just run every play at this point
dude this shit is fucking insanity
maybe lamar just cant play without his hypeman
fuck it pull a flacco and go for a pi
christ 3rd and jackson
fuuuck
why does lamar run into sacks
so honestly when we starting dez bryant
no o line and no receivers been the story or the season cover andrews cover hollywood and collapse the inside o line
at least the chiefs will repeat as sb champs anyway im so dead inside
i knew this game would be a pivotal point for this season will we see an adjustment and improvement on the offence coming off the bye i think we saw a flash but not much else i think it sets the tone for this season and i dont think this team is where it needs to be on that side of the ball
yes
bout fucking time
there we go
thank you a vertical pass
there we fucking go
there we go
offense had all two weeks to gameplan to do fuck all outside of be a liability lamar cant throw today our wrs are abysmal at best romans a hack who draws up his pass plays with half chewed crayons and the oline is patchwork with our the lt likely out for the season fuck
duvernay
at least were not the titans
and now we see duvernay
fuck yes nice play
ill take it
playing fivewide with this line and 2nd 8 dont blame everything on greg roman
holy fucking pope shit
lets go
jesus fuck this xfinity ad with the awful cover of fleetwood macs go your own way
finally
i cant believe we are down right now just unbelievable
oh my goodness
duvernay
i belee
like i said we shouldve been passing deep all season we never throw deep
just when i feel like giving up they pull me back in is this what its like to be in an abusive relationship
vamos lets go
now thats what we needed
making spillane look like jack lambert smh
defense fighting to keep the game tight reminds me of all the flacco years
ive never heard of spleen fella before today but i swear hes the only guy playing for pitts d today
fuck these refs
thats the lamar jackson we all tuned in to see
bullshit flag
of fucking course theres a flag
im telling you duv is fucking legit
pocket didnt instantly collapse nice
lmfao we finally get a good play from lamar and the refs take it away of fucking course fuck this game
are you fucking kidding me
of course
someone please beat skura with a shoe
thats a hold
might as well kick the fg now
have they had a holding call all day
please no flag please no flag
use jk
all the uncalled shit amazing
thats absolute bs
flag sigh
fucking holding
that wasnt a fucking hold
hahahahahahaha
damn it
fuck everything
such a bs flag my god that just saved the steelers game
greg roman must have published a book this off season on how to read is play calling
thats soft
wow his hand was there but clearly letgo
snead sorry for talking shit lol
snead iv just draggin a guy
sneeeeeeeeed
steelers defense acting like lamar cant throw
snead has been having a fantastic game
questionable call
these damn refs are trying their best to screw the ravens today
another soft call by these bitch ass refs
ref ball gotta love it
gotta play against the refs too
phantom calls
sneaddddd
bullshit
that was a soft fucking hold
what what is this im not using to this feeling in the second half
let us go
lets fucking gooooooo
horrible call lol
horseshittt
prove en wrong offense
what the absolute fuck was that bullshit ass fucking call
another game another session of getting done dry in the ass by the fucking zebras

i fucking hate nfl refs they are so utterly incredibly actively useless
lmao pansy soft coverage right there good job making em pay
ravens are so much better when they play with tempo
snead getting that game ball most relatively underappreciated pickup of the last few years imo
lamar has that look in his eyes guys i think he woke up guys i think he realized hes the ducking problem too
lamar getting his confidence back here i hope dude has looked so clearly downtrodden most of this year
damn 39 buy him some dinner first
snead is playing with ferocity today
he a got a kneefuck
its the consecutive scoring that was making us not gel now we will explode and not score every odd quarter
lamar put a little too much air on that a little less and thats a td
the shin is down that counts
clear mark where the knee landed
ughhhhhh
that wont count
the knee is in created a bend in the turf
man that knee was right on the line how do they judge that in tennis
why do they not call that a td when every td is reviewed call it a td and then make sure not calling it one means you have to waste a challenge i hate that shit
dont think there is enough to overturn that if it was called the other way id say the same its too close to overturn imo
think ruling on the field will stand its super close whether the left foot comes down before the right knee
waste of a challenge
why do we have to challenge a scoring play
his kneecap literally hit the line is that in or out
call stands
im not seeing the knee touching guys
i realy really love that lamar floated that same with the duvernay throw the best way to helpnur recievers is to put air under the ball
no idea dont think theyll overturn it
1 knee2 feet
i think the knee was out
not even close at that angle
ball doesnt lie
redemption
gets it away lfg
lets gooooooooo
with the ab dance lmao
wait guys might be a flag somehow
lets gooooooo
lets go
great drive defense do your thing
lets goooooooo
hollywood still got his tittie

yknow that lamar and brown were probably talking while waiting and both knew they were gonna try to get that there
hollywooodddd
there we go
fuck em
instant justice
thats for you hollywood
hollywood baby defense youre up
ball dont fucking lie
ball doesnt lie
we always got to make it exciting
hes back lamar looks like lamar of last year
are they playing la marseillaise in the bank
side note we have a chance to break the nfl record for most consecutive games with 20 points next week against the colts
just noticed the gold mo in the endzone nice touch
oh that atmosphere is awesome
please keep this intensity lamar
r a v e n s

ravens
its gonna be roughing the passer cause refs
if they call roughing im going down there and punching a ref
peters needs to turn his head thats two picks i think he couldve had
yeah pick that fucking flag up
finally the refs decide to give us a good call
phew
thank god man that would have been crazy
they picked up a flag they can do that s
titans getting smacked by the bengals lol
if he got a roughing i am literally going to scream
how can you guys not enjoy this game its so good

i love nail biters
if its clear and yella you got juice there fella if its tangy and brown youre in cider town
i was about to throw something at the tv
that should not be a roughing
based refs not calling rtp there
queen dont give up on the play wtf
after seeing the replay im pretty surprised they didnt call that
bonds is straight trash
bonds just stopped playing wtf
who even is bonds
bonds is definitely gone after this
why the fuck did he give up on that play
theres a reason hes on the damn practice squad i guess
bonds wtf man
38 is getting cut after this game lmao
get bonds off the field bra
bonds wtf
yeah stupid tackle
release bonds now
annndddd a facemask
bonds again
can bonds never play again
was this bonds dude signed this morning
fuck 38 get him out
who the fuck is bonds
clark wtf
whoever this bonds guy is is fucking awful needs to be off the team asap for giving up on that play
not sure about terrell bonds boys
bonds is not having a great sequence of plays here
its barry bonds
who tf is bonds he is getting targeted every play
how many penalties we got today as many as philly
38 is a fucking bum who is this guy
get him off the fucking field
bonds looking like ass these last two plays
man can we get our defense back
bonds thought it was dropped lol
wow are we seriously gonna choke on this drive
when the games close we commit a ton of penalties smh
what was that bonds he walked away hopefully he walks away from the team
i dont even know who this bonds guy is but hes having a horrendous day
chuck cant be doing that
turns out preseason hero terrell bonds needs some more time
bonds is hurting us
i think the refs get bored sometimes so they just throw flags
get bonds out of there holy shit
i like how none of us have heard of bonds but hes our third cb
who is bonds
jesus even when we get to him he still makes the play
looks like bonds isnt going to last long here
get bonds out
bonds stinking it up
bro
get bonds tf outta here rn
get him off the field he gets burned and fucks up
man 38 has not looked good on those two plays
cut bonds holy shit hes like the anti melvin coming in as a no one and fucking us up
bowser is doing great in this production in the role of matthew judon
low key we are getting nice pressure off 4 today
you guys blaming averettbe careful what you wish for
fuck tomlin but he does like kinda cool
feels like we get pressure every down and ben does his bullfighter routine so annoying
can we agree that bonds needs to go back to the practice squad after this week
why are we fucking giving up on plays before theyre over
could we actually get to ben please
come on dude lets get a fucking stop
we have to get home otherwise ben will feast
we gotta stop these penalties they are killing us
humph almost punched that out
lower your shoulder marlon could have stopped him there
no fucking way
here it comes
refs definitely have money on the steelers
and again the d melts down with bad penalties
that is opi
fuck these refs
fuck off
fuck
defense has looked sloppy this half
refs are fucking us
thats opi
fuck my life dude
for fucks sake defense
me watching the steelers slowly drive down the field
what the fuck
to think the steelers fans were bitching about us being given a td earlier bet theyre real quiet about that now
getting real sick of all this soft zone shit
gave away too many yards on that possession


pretty disappointing feels like defense never shows up in big games red zone defense nonexistent
run pass run coming up
we have come back from behind twice in this game already lets do it one more time with a soul sucking run pass balance drive that chews all the clock
do we trust this offence to go down the field again
man our team has been awful with penalties last few games
i just want this game to be over tbh hope we run it a ton and then get down to knowing we have 4 downs either lamar and roman can do it or they cant
run the goddamn ball
ive got work tonight and im pretty sure im going to regret waking up for this game at this point
we college now
wishbone time
dobbins is so good
long slow drive for a score lets do this
next time he should truck fitzpatrick
unleash dobbins
feeling like this could be that drive
all aboard
gus bus
this drive is beautiful
our running game looks way better without ingram
jk all day
honk honk
god damn dobbins
dobbins has looked damn good
keep running it they cant stop it
i think pitts plan is to just let us run the ball down them in hopes of another drive
motherfucker just do what works how hard is that
jk dobbins 14111 and counting
yall reckon we can get 2 100 rushers
jk
well good news is the browns pulled a browns no disrespect to the raiders tho
holy shit i love jk
dobbins is pretty good
jk should now be the starter
oh fuck yes greg keep going im almost there
this is why we drafted dobb
that toss play getting mighty cute dont fumble it
this drive is where the time of possession pays off
its almost like when we call a run most times we do good weird isnt it
thats like 6 injuries from both teams
dude dobbins and edwards are putting in some serious work today
roman playing maddenjust spamming the same 2 plays lol
i think i see the ravens trading justice for a pick in the offseason and drafting another rb keep ingram for one more year but let dobbins carry the load
friendship ended with ingram dobbins is my new best friend
heyward flop to slow down momentum
tj still desperately trying to hit lamar
i love ingram but i swear to god if he gets the majority of the snaps next week
brown in the end zone just do it
take your time get the td
just keep running that ball baby
milk this fuckin clock bois
the story of this game is refs suck injuries suck and jk dobbins is a beast
need to kill more clock with the way the refs are playing
shouldnt snap the ball with more than 3 seconds on the play clock
so are we gonna give greg player of the game for actually running the ball when we are down
can nobody get open
go for it
damn it
is there such a thing as the offense moving the ball too well i think this might be it
game probably on the line here fingers crossed
they should have run that play before the warning what the hell are they thinking
dobbins gets the ball here
we got this
god i feel so sick rn we need this shit
truss
im calling it either we score on 4th down here or they stop us short and turn over on downs
lamar had the whole right side open why fucking cut inside
trussssz
i cant take this shit man
lamar had two guys in the middle i think and he didnt throw it he can make those throws but he needs to trust himself to
game on the line right here
this game just from a third party perspective is very good
if we kick a field goal we still have to get a defensive stop anyway of course were going for it
bad qb play bad coaching with time management we dont deserve to win
despite how much i hate this right now this is ravens steelers football and why this is such a great rivalry
my heart
of course it has to come down to the wire
awful call
that was such an obvious playcall
jfc
i havent even seen what happened yet goddamnit
lmao what was that
nice stumble
just give andrews a chance to make a play jfc
why are we still in empty fuck roman titans game all over again stop using empty on 4th
i am so angry at lamar
motherfucker
fuck to eager to run
if you cannot pass you cannot win big games
gg
lets go d gotta step up
now we need humphrey to go all hulk smash on the ball
what a stupid fucking call
why that run though far out
why the hell was the backfield empty
god dammit skura
fuck me damn it
fuck
fuuuuuuck
sigh
bad play design ravens didnt deserve to win this anyway
lol fuck that boooooooooo
time to fire roman why because we should of been running all season and now it shows
nice play calling lol
lol why not call a pass if were in empty let him decide if he wants to run after that
trash playcalling in that sequence unreal
i need my one punch marlo my punch out peters my sacksonvile 20 i want it all out
that was a shitty play call on top of it they didnt bite down on that play all day why run it now
again too many penalties and dumb play calling
missing that timeout
wish we would have given it to gus there
that was a shit play call
why why the fuck are we wasting all of our talent we had the game early and just threw it out the window i dont even look forward to the rest of the season

these games are the only thing ive had to look forward to and its like the management isnt taking it seriously
why did roman call that how about some misdirection or something they knew the ravens werent passing
there goes the division
its not healthy watching this game
now wheres the random flag
queen knocked the hell outta him
why was peters so far away from claypool like the fuck press up close in this situation
shades of ray lewis
one last time bois lets make sure

we punch it into the endzone
wow game not officially over
well looks like we got a minute to do something
well positives jk looks awesome and we ran the ball well
hey we have odds lol
holy crap were still in it

this could be the moment this team rallies lets go
block this punt please football gods
winning this game would make it go straight in the history books
here we go lamar has a chance
just dont run into the kicker going for a block please
good hands proche
block the kick
how fast can hollywood brown run and how high can he jump
these steelers games always raising my damn heart rate
take a shot
lmao this is a hail mary prayer gg boys
best throw of the day by lamar
wtf
this is where lamar can make a name for comeback kid
fuck me andrews keep running thats a catch
ruuuuun to the line
fake shit
come on fluker
lol faker
fake shit
they better add time
these fools got me stress chugging natty boh
this is it ladies and gents
wow
the forward pass was a mistake
fuck sakes
we might theres hope
no reason we lost here we shouldve had extra time at the end but that honestly is the least damning issue catching and calming down lamar tightens up and our receivers secure a little better we can run and throw ravens we got this next time be prepared
why are we blaming roman its lamar who has thrown basically three interceptions this game bringing them in it activate dez man
you guys are all fucking idiots if you think tj did that on purpose
hate to say this but lamars currently leading the blame of the game should we lose
i seriously cant stand the just run it stans in here how about make a fucking pass lamar
itd be awesome if we had a receiver like any receiver were throwing out wr 34s and expecting lamar to bail us out every week
can someone pull out the rule book for the refs
fuck tj watt
removed
fire fucking greg roman
can our goddamn o line protect lamar from behind please just because they go into the back field doesnt mean you have to stop blocking them jesus fuck
indecisive lamar is back its gonna be a near impossible game to win
running the fucking ball is killing them yet greg keeps going away from it for some fucking unknown reason

run the goddamn ball and we win its not that fucking hard roman
we should be up 140 wtf man
fuck tj watt
well good season guys
jesus fuck thats not a penalty man
judon did nothing wrong
glad this is getting overturned but damn lamar whats wrong with you today
incoming salty steelers when he was trying to sell the pass interference
lamar is fucking awful sorry has to be said
i love lamars little dats on me head tap of course it is
should be 24 to 0 period dumbass play calling that we didnt need to do has down 4 instead
this offense is legitimately broken i think roman needs to go
can these zebra cunts fuck off
get greg roman the fuck outta here man
lamar mightve given the steelers 17 but all the rest of their points came courtesy of the referees we shouldve won that game not really mad
you happy with that run on third and 8 roman haters

fuck me dead would be nice if we could trust our mvp qb to throw a football but he has not inspired much confidence today
inexcusable throw 2019 lamar looking like a flash in the pan
take watts fucking head off juju to burfict type shit
fuck the refs fuck the steelers shouldve been a blowout if not for the ints and bullshit dpi calls time for a beer
man after a crazy night of getting no typa action at the club i cant take a double l in 2 days pls ravens win
so ready for this game nice to hear atleast some fans back in the bank
buckle in boys i have a chiefs feeling
welp here goes dumbass pass plays
someone needs to deck watt hes playing like a twat
wow hell of a throw this mf so inconsistent
for everyone that freaks out after 1 sequence in a game this is what composure is try having some
uuuuggghhhh its gonna be one of those games isnt it



no faith havin good for nothin doomsdayers
bad penalties
so tired of the claypool hype man has one good game and people are getting their dicks out for him
no you have the ball
i understand the complaints about lamar but lets also do the honest thing and complement the steelers defense they arent slouches
can you guys stop bitching about tj watt jfc its football
yall watt didnt do that on purpose
of course it was watt i know that particular one wasnt on purposebut of course it was him
whelp there go our sb chances
fuck the steelers
cant watch this game there is going to be more injuries i rather lose this game than see players go out for a season
how is it only the start of the second quarter
never pass the ball again i want to see an armynavy looking box score
steelers tryna ko lamar fuck tomlin
no helmet to helmet and lfg gus bus baby
fuck imagine if lamar didnt have that pick and fumble
its not helmet to helmet if lamar runs but they seem to be looking to hit lamar at every opportunity
where are all the haters that were in this thread 5 minutes ago
steelers are dirty af
weak af ref is a pussy
dude they really want the ravens to lose this one
goodbye judon

hello yannick
these old as officials need to fuck off like absolutely trash
peters gets way too god damn emotional just play the game
like clockwork judon is good for one dumbass penalty every game

great personality awful football iq
hit that rape head
did anyone actually see the judon thing he was pulling his arm free from someone else and it caused accidental contact with the referees arm it was not intentional it was not flagrant he just caught the ejection

the skirmish itself was boneheaded but the referee incident was really shitty refereeing
ben dramatically overplaying an injury why ill be dammed
lamar dude fucking hell man
gus having a good game hope hes ok
so they flag that but not the helmet shot to lamarok
tj watt pumped to do a course of steroids at halftime
refs trying to hose us again lmao
tomlin knows adjustments hes going to make lamar pass lamar needs to play better pitts d will gas out in the fourth because of time of possession

lets win this shit
overgrown it wasnt catchable
lamar looks like shit roman needs to go its like once we find something that works we go away from it because we think we are too smart
lamar is going to single handedly throw this game no pun intended
this game should be 240 right now if not for some really fucking dumb mistakes from lamar
we need to stop being afraid of letting lamar run a lot yes its a risk but hes not a top tier qb passing at all
lamar looking like a double agent for the steelers rn
either we cant see on tv but it never seems like we have a receiver wide open like the ravens d sometimes gives up
3 and out this offense is broken right now
can we accelerate dez from the ps we need anything on offense receiver wise
turnovers everywhere 45 completion rate amazing were even in this game honestly

lamar has to be better and they have to give him some help outside im sorry but brown and boykin is not going to cut it in this league
are these refs on crack
shitted away a lead to the steelers lost stanley and im already hungover from last night oh yea today is going to suck big time
lol bro who tf is j balvin
we dont game manage anymore instead we try to go punch for punch instead of protecting leads and running the ball and here we are every fucking week it seems like

lamar isnt an elite passer i would say he is average and his decision making is poor at times

so either we reel it in and manage games or we end up living by the westbrook dying by the worstbrook
offense is sloppier than a blow job from a woman with no teeth
if you dont have the ball then block wtf hill
of course lamar is keeping that hill hasnt done shit this whole season why would anyone think he would get the ball
fuck greg roman

all my homies hate greg roman
btw our streak of scoring in consecutive quarters seems like its coming to an end
we have 190 rushing yards

our o line is down 2 starters

steelers lead the nfl in sacks

our receivers are horrible

why do we keep passing
lamar haters get fucked
that was a bad throw way too much under that should have been an easy completion
lamar doesnt throw that so high thats a td
look at that divot thats in its in by the tiniest margin but one knee equals two feet
hollywood is great but not wr1 great having a taller possession guy in that spot wouldve paid dividends
he did the ab dance
we got our own fans rooting against us fuck the steelers and the fake ravens
lamars just as much as the reason the steelers have a chance as he is the reason the ravens are winning with this line and lack of receivers not many qbs would be doing better
defense getting exposed again
fire roman right now what a fucking idiot
we win this game with a qb who can throw the ball
just run the ball
4th and 3 lets run a gimmick play with lamarinstead of pound it with gus whos perfect for the situation jesus christ roman
why did we go empty fuckin run power i and get gus in there
still cant win a big game
great lamar had another chance to lose the game for the 2nd time this week
i cant predict plays worth shit and i even knew what was going to happen with only lamar in the backfield
this is ending with a lamar turnover

i want to be wrong
fuck this offense it looks as capable as the worst flacco years
lmfao what are these calls
hail mary
holy fucking shit
hit on defenseless receiver ugh
thats defenseless
flag
oh fuck off fitzpatrick you clown
last gasp play and you throw the ball the willie fucking snead
i dont want to get political

but please dont forget to vote please
i dont want to see lamar throw another time today
our offense is so predictable run the ball for fucks sake

this team will be bounced out of the playoffs with the quickness
the lamar apologists are revving up the engine
lamar is fucking stupid this year when hes looking downfield with pressure i swear this man doesnt know how to throw a ball away or get rid of it before 3 seconds he just stands there pump faking and double clutching like a moron and he gets sacked or stripped i love the guy but jesus fucking get rid of it everyone sees it coming but him
tj watt so fucking dirty why does he need to fling himself like that what the fuck is wrong with these guys
i remember when game threads were fun memes jokes rhymes funny stuff now its just all complaining ive become old i guess
i mightve lost faith in lamar
70 with 13 minutes left in the 1st quarter

ravens fans its over
you cant tell me lamar isnt bad after this game
that loss is all on lamar period
fuck trump
gift
judon you fucking idiot one of the most common sense rules dont touch the damn ref especially dont swing at them when theyre trying to break up a fight
sheesh lamar maybe we were too harsh on boykin
any no nut november participants in here
man i cant stand roman deligate him to just making run plans
win or lose roman needs to be gone its been a trend on every team he has been apart of
fuck yall sad ass trolls
i mean we arent crazy right last year his throwing was actually not bad what happend to him that hes unable to throw a decent pass anymore
get to the fucking line lamar
usually im proud to be a ravens fan but youre all whining like a bunch of little batches today the is gonna be a frustrating loss but its not enough to abandon lamar come on
lamar is literally the reason this team has a chance with its lack of talent and you fans trash him anyway
that is a touchdown these refs can suck my dick and balls
is it worth trading our first for buck allen to supplement our running back core
not one throw the entire drive those last 4 calls were awful
if they score im sucking my own dick
faker dirty ass trick
roman needs to be gone
did alright to overcome a shit game by lamar he even rebounded which was a good sign shouldve won that but it is what it is
what makes this worse is we dominated in every phase of the game

unfortunately that includes turnovers and penalties
177 losing 2117 thanks lamar
fuck tj watt hitting lamar late every play guys a bitch
removed

tj watt fucking reckless goon
this is what happen when you let dirty players play dirty without consequence fucking hell
tj isnt dirty guys he always whips himself around while tackling a qb 10 seconds late


concerning that lamars accuracy has gotten worse this year
can someone tell me whats wrong with lamar this year
tomlin sus
tj a bum
lets stop this fuck tj watt bs it was clearly an accident
so many cold takes maybe this fanbase has some fat we dont need
pretty crappy throw
still a great game
give the ball to dobbins dont let lamar fuck up yet again
headhunt watt idc
cant beat them dive at ankles and hit them late every play what the fuck is tomlin teaching these clowns
yeah lamar keep tapping your chest its on you yeah it is on you looked good in cle and its been a downward spiral since awful bye week preparation vs an elite defense hmm rushing is working lets keep throwing
tj watt fuck you u rat bastard
can someone explain how that was a dirty play by watt
fuck the steelers
yo they talking to this steelers clown about punching the ball out bruh we got marlon humphrey
this will be a bad day for us their dline is much better than our oline we will wtruggle to run the ball and lamar will be under pressure all day combine that with the weather i think we lose 2413
bout time boykin made a play
duv scores on that 100
looks like its once again lamar vs the entire other teams defense gonna be a long game of the defense isnt lights out
lamar cant read defense
steelers sub thinks that td was gifted by the refs from that personal foulbet theyll be crying for calls when we hit ben on every play and try to roll his legs up
fuck you refs well beat both you and pitts asses dont give a fuck
jfc lamar
come on lamar
thats on lamar cmon dude cant do that shit
delay of game
season over
fuck the steelers
figures right after we pay him
what are the odds f u watt
didnt look intentional but what a dramatic ass roll that was smh
that looked like the prescott injury
full leg cast thats an acl fuck
more leg diving from steelers in 321
our defense will only keep us in games for so long i dont know if i expect us to do much anymore on offense for the rest of the season maybe edc has something up his sleeve for stanley cuz holy fuck this might have cut our season short
not to dwell on negativity but fuck man that stanley injury just deflated my energy
regardless of the outcome hard to feel like this is anything other than a disaster due to stanleys injury
watson with the foot fetish
dirty ass hit on lamar there too fucking hate this team
that was a cheek clapping drive
where are all u fake ravens fans capen for the steelers on that helmet shot to lamar
god dammit judon
the ref flopped smh
definitely not judons fault
peters is a headcase looked like he initiated that shit to me
good call refs judon playing dumb
honestly can judon get the fuck off this team any sooner
judon needs to sit for that next week idiot
these refs are so fucking soft man
judon you fucking idiot
i guess you could say he is judone


okay ill leave
my biggest fear is one of our defenders doing something stupid and getting an unsportsmanlike penalty after 3rd down
already lost what 3 players also we had that drive on lock down what a freaking way to give it to them
judon isnt even worth the comp pick we might get from him
damn we seem to be running better with the injuries
is hollywood playing in this game lol

lamar really needs a 1 receiver
really bad throw trying to force it cannot afford to give them anything lamar honestly got super lucky
lamar has been doing an elite geno smith impression today
what thats a ghost call
i feel like we get close enough for 40 yarder and fake it and let koch throw a td pass
i honestly thought mandrews was going to make his name as a top 2 te this season but man he has been disappointing
hall of fame
i didnt realize you could tackle pass rushers and not get a flag
got away with one
got away with one for sure
kinda done with lamar atm not even gonna lie
yal know what time it is

trace mc sorley



s
lj is single handily bring this team down
14 points gifted to the steelers lamar cant read a fucking defense im sorry to say it
slit my fucking throat i hate everything
and after that i have just about enough of greg im sorry boys i am now officially anti greg lamar gotta throw it away but that playcall shouldnt even have been fucking called
wtf starting to not like lamars attitude
garbage play call
why is everyone blaming roman because lamar cant complete a pass
lol flacco time
also be kind of cool if yannick could generate a bit of pressure
dude i dont even want to watch this anymore its too much to handle
this drive is all on lamar
howd we get in this position we had the game on lock run the ball and we decided to throw at every attempt disappointing
some weeks queen looks like a stud and others he looks like he is playing at the high school level
im also tired of so many people defending lamar he hasnt played well in the last 3 games something needs to give
we can lose the game but if we lose because we gave up on our run game im gonna need roman to be on the hotseat
burgerking mcdonalds
hell of a lot of time left gotta go run down their throats
really glad opening up with a throw right there great stuff smh
titans are choking vs the bungles which makes me feel a bit better
we have no throwing offetwhat so ever this year and we should have never traded away hurst
at what point does harbs get on the mic and tell roman to run the fucking ball
oh come on skura
thats clearly a touchdown wtf is romo smoking
thats a fucking touchdown
lamar you floated that a bit much my guy
his knee is down
refs owe us this
bad throw by lamar tbh
right knee was in clear and obvious
sucks that it was called incomplete no way these they overturn it nothing definitive is going to be seen in their replays
head hunt these fuckin refs
fucking refs give us a break please
cocksucking refs
cmon refs cant come up with a penalty to call that td back you bunch of bitches
ball dont lie fellas give it time
lmao bitch ass overrated titans
is that dudes last name niggs
ok for real though this game is going down in history
go with gus
heres the problem with this 4th down playgreg roman gonna call some asanine play
lmao in that case you cant put the ball in our worst offensive weapon of the days hands give it to jk and its a guarantee 3 yards
thats a great play by the dt unfortunately
no shot yall blaming lamar for that
this isnt over yetneed a stop
tbh i think we should seriously consider firing roman

lamar doesnt wear down the defense dobbinsbus did wish we didnt have 0 rb on the biggest play of the year got a chance but i am ready ot be hurt again
why did mark stop there thats on 89
stop throwing in the middle of the field
lamar has andrews open
fuck it out in rg3 at running back duvernay at qb lamar at 0l and dobbins as a receiver

confuse the fuck out of pittsburg
fuck heyward if we dont get time back for this the refs really do have it in for us
steeers fan coming in peace sorry for the injury it seems really bad id never wish anything like that to anyone sorry
its gonna be a long day boys
as much as i hate you guys i hope he is okay and atleast come back this season
fuck tj watt even if it was an accident
fuck watt
fuck tj watt nowhere close to making the play
if you guys are really this pissy just watch the defense play theres not too much for you to whine about on that front
jump off a bridge ref
judons last play as a raven
labum jackson
lamar ran nfl spread offense in college idk what the problem is he can throw so do it
cant believe we choked this
bad turnovers by the offense

but the defense cant get the steelers off the field stop blaming it all on the offense give me a break wide open receivers
i think we throw it and it goes incomplete or lamar gets sacked
refs win them the game
lamar lost this game
lamar does not make comebacks get used to it
lamar has regressed
wear the mask you piece of shit tomlin
fuck living fuck these refs
wtf is this coaching staff gonna do about this trash reffing against us what do something fuck
man we handed them that game
the playcalling was again total garbage
tj having a day dont see why you think hes dirty for doing his job
removed
steelers fan coming to say hope stanely is ok i love the physical nature of this rivalry but you never wanna see anybody go down like that

removed
we arent as good as we think
lets keep passing makes so much sense since its been working so well all day
and the hay is in the barn
bonds fucked us that drive
lamar was the best player for the steelers today

fan with their heads to far up their ass to realize lamar is part of the problem need to go away
lamar lost the game yeah he did and it sucks but he wins games for us all the time joe lost the every other game for us still a 52 team im confident well peak at the right time
bring in rg3 and run something wild
throw tj watt out of the league
its okay tj youll never be jj
jesus this sub is toxic you all seem to forget the steelers have a team too right
all you judon apologists can lick my balls
man yall complain after a game with advertsity its like yall expect things to go smoothly bounce back is coming back strong for lamar
lets get it
lets f u c k i n g gooooooo

risky pass but completed
fucking terrible throw terrible play calling
boykin sees dez up in the box
pick six already gonna be a great game
thats a good throw
shouts out boykin
the offense looks like they dont even want to be there today total lack of energy
thats two fucking rtp call that shit
strategy here is to keep the ball out of fat bens hands smart
jesus christ lamar now he hesitates and barely makes it to the los
garbage drive so far
we gotta send orlando brown some help
3 fucking guys right on top of that run
late hit city why is watt allowed to dive at his knees he handed it off
thanks minkah
jesus christ
thats not a foul at all but ill take it
cant get out of our own way

i would think after a bye week we wouldve fixed the formation issues
what the fuck is wrong with the formations
guy has best porno stache

lmao snead so slow
love seeing willie get involved hes underused as fuck in this offense imo
you gotta be kidding me more formation penalties
clowns should have declined that penalty
drop counter 2
willie

all of our runs with gus and jk have been so effective just commit to it defense is getting the job doneeeeeeee fuck the pass
lmao kick the field goal now

jk
lemme get a sack pls
theres the llama i know
came late have we been running like this all game
and run it again
they cant stop our run game
yes
run run run run
we can run like this with a broken oline hopeful
well look at that going to a heavy run game and the offense is moving right along
setting up the run game for play action
ruuuuuuun
im having trouble seeing on my crappy stream whos playing at line now in which spots
does anyone know if theyll be selling tickets for the game against the cowboys

doing what we should have done against kansas city
greg roman all of a sudden wow this whole running thing really works
like dj khalid says and another run and another run
jk is a fucking laser beam
run to set up the pass this is what we needed
apparently our only extra guard is ben powers right now
lamar should have 57 designed runs a game even if a few arent successful you have to make defenses account for it pocket lamar doesnt do that
really dont need to run up the middle like that jeez
pound it in
wow lamar lived through that stop
oline is actually still intact
fuck that hurt just watching
andrews needs to play with more intensity and stop jogging his routes
easy
lets go
right in the fucking head too
picked up gus in fantasy 5 minutes before the game started made a good decision
no helmet to helmet call okaychecks out
the balls on lamar
gus will literally hammer this shitty overrated d line into pebbles if roman lets him
the wheels on the bus go mf round
surely helmet to helmet
trash ass defense get fucked
does anyone know what the record is for consecutive quarters scoring points
the retro logo hand warmer
gus deserved that td lets gooooo
fuck the doom and gloom this team can win
so many people over reacting to a rough start by lamar
gus is having a great day today
lamar needs to protect himself
so why does pretty much every coach stand on the sideline but roman sits up somewhere else is that normal for offensive coordinators
pick 6 incoming
did you just see a duck flying lmao
they not even trying humphrey
look even if we dont win and its anyones game rn at least we are playing solid football
theres been a couple times this year if marcus looks he has a pick
did yall see judon dumbass hop inside on that run
fast boi getting past us
steelers got some bounty shit going on it seems like
judon is so bad at edge he bites on motion and screens constantly
pernell mcphee locked that run down
this aint going to be good
he literally put his hands in his facemask
cmon
did someone tell judon that his body was not built by taco bell
judon is going to get ejected
not mad at that fight
theres a definite face mask there by steelers lets not discount that please refs
welp
judon you fucking moron
bruh judon
they cant make stupid penalty to keep drives along damn
bruh why
so much for being able to rush 4 damnit judon

big money judon
judon wow
maybe hell learn
judon should be ejected for that
maybe this is god wanting us to get a preview
damn judon you idiot
how do you do that
judon last season for sure lol
just not a good day
my lord judon most be so mad seeing himself screw up his boom or bust year
let judon ass walk dodo bird
dumbass judon fucking up our whole d effort
thats horrible id rather cut him and lose games than have him on the team we have a culture
soft
fucking hell
back that ass up
weve gotta fleas someone with a judon trade
on the positive i wonder if we can get some solid ol help in exchange for judon
get them off the fucking field
calais how tf do you do this lol
joker
lets goooo
joker

mannnnn
need to score here steelers get the ball to start the third make pittsburghs incompetence hurt
steelers shitting their pants right now
fuck what happen why judon get sent out
2 minute drill lets go
lets fucking go crow boys unite
bens elbow acting up
i think you have to hand out 15 there kind of like high sticking in hockey its up to you to control where it goes that said i think a dq needs to be off the table there its clearly incidental
does yannick just take the place of judon
was that chris boards best play as a raven
one foot to the left and gus wouldve broken that open
fuck if dobbins jumped to the right on that play he might be gone
all this talk all season about the steelers elite d line love that were running it down their fucking throats
whos pittsburghs backup
our defense and run game can carry us as sad as it is to think about i cant even fathom it and its reality we might be contenders and have life after stanley
lamar tryin to kill my heart with this first down fumble thing
i just wanna ask whos at rg now cause last i checked phillips got hurt
my heart
yall remember that robot chicken fumbles joke lamars nickname this 1st half
i really want a touch down this drive but ill take a fg
tj watt cant stop being handsy with lamar cant tell if hes being a scumbag or fancies him
not again man
fuck
pain
not a catch
lamar lucky
wait
are you fucking kidding me
lamar is trying to lose this game
thank god
lamar man hes gotta be careful
no catch
hes killing me this game
ravens are still sloppy like they were before the bye week which is concerning with what has gone wrong so far im happy that were even still in it much less leading and driving
god fucking damn it
wow dude
oh good christ another pick lol that was just an awful pass too way behind boykin he never had a chance
please come back but got damn lamar stop it
no control
damn hope that gets overturned fuck
idg it

were running so well but decide to throw there
fuuuxk goddamit
dumb play by lamar but our receivers dont have a fucking clue of how to come back to the ball or to settle down in between zones
boykin had his couple plays stop throwing to him now you know youre not on the same page
thats no int but neither was devin bush last year so we will see
god damn greg why are we fucking throwing
of course
that was an in cutting route no excuse for lj there
fuck man props to the players for fighting hard despite all
set up for an fg get some more yards
is it me or is this like the third time our ball carrier has run into their own man lamar twice gus once
brown jr caught a fucking body lmaooooo
orlando crushed that pull
i think lamar is trying too hard this year not playing with the same confidence and swag he had last year at all
look how good this team is when we run the ball

its ok to be a running team roman
opi
still didnt fix the illegal shifts over the bye lol
keep pounding this chicken
lets get some points up before half boys leggo
hustle up boys come on
too much talent on the field for them to lose
pretenders the lot of them
like we never had ingram lol
see lamar throwing it away is not so bad xd
turnnnn uppp
bad throw
boswell got scared for nothing after that pass towards the sideline
just dont turn it over
andrews doesnt slip i think its a catch spot wasnt that bad
fucking wasted two downs should be 177
bad spot
go for it
sheesh
why call time
cleveland and ten both look bad today we need to win this
thats a waste of a time out 21 seconds is plenty of time to get up and run another play should have one ready to go when running the 2 minute offense anyway
dobbins is a dog
goat time
what the hell was that
holy shot wtf happened lol
i dont like not taking a shot there little conservative
dobbins is a fucking train
jesus fuck mini heart attack there lmao
harms mask moving makes himlook like a duck
easy money
tuck is to smooth it
dobbins is the goat
im all about a 177 lead at the half making the steelers offense look like chumps
get fucked romo tucker the goat
super heads up play
goat tucker doing goat things
way to fight back heart attack jackson
who gets ball at half
i just tuned in can anyone fill me in
jk dobbins is going to wally pipp ingram in the second half write it down
whew
maybe i missed it but has there been any update on gus is he injured
its very surprising to see that every time the steelers run or catch a ball they protect the ball over anything else

its nice to see that our defense instills that much fear that theyll give up yards to try to secure the ball better
is nantz from pittsburgh
lmao where was queen
whos 38
i feel like they didnt have enough guys on the line there either
nice play bowser
great play
bowser stepping tf up you say
nice throw ben
good shit
big jimmy
no flag
why was queen on juju
punt bitch
jimmy lol
jimmy wrapped that dudes arm up
refs cant seem to tell where the ball is going out on those punts
great job d we need points now
flop
lets get a long 68 minute drive with a td here good classic lean on you football
time to see how their defense has adjusted to us running down their throats
probably could have been a hold pi i dont think so bc it was unwatchable but that first grab could have been called

jimmy knows exactly how much he can get away with without a flag though
wtf man
just take the ball and put it on the ground
jesus fuck
what the fuck is he doing
fucking shit run the fucking ball
you got to be kidding
is that 3 picks and a fumble or 2
i mean thats gonna happen when every other pass has been interceptable today jeez
that is a fucking terrible play
no
are you high
why
poor defense
absolutely atrocious
holy shit galaxy brain calling and decision making is back baby
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
what are you doing
this team is going to cause my alcoholism
are you fucking kidding me
he is staring at his receiver the whole way
well fuck us i guess
jesus christ why the fuck
what the fuck
why throw that ball man
god fucking damn it
thats heartbreaking
what a qb
wow great start guys
its inevitable when you fuck up so bad on offense
fuck me
x200b

well that escalated quickly
fuck lamar get it together
why do we make everything hard we gave them everything today
g r e a t
fuck least we still have 3 pt lead we need another td now though
i think that was queen out of his zone
what the fuck
that was a careless pass
run the damn ball
what are we doing here
fucking hell
wtf is going on
well thats two defensive fuckups since we came out of the locker cant lose focus

we are still in good shape weve shown we can shake off the pick lets do it again
3 turnovers in a game wow
tomlin took so long to discuss that to give his d more rest duh
i know he dropped that screen earlybut im still fucking loving duvernay
ugh
fucking come on
finished
chris moore citing
fucking hell
offense is very fortunate that the d has shut down roethliesburger take away the short fields and the score would be 170
isnt it crazy how this game has been but ppl just chill shaking hands like brown and juju on the sidelines too
no way
phishing
gonna lose the lead here
oh no were talking about pass interference
really
about time
super holding there
nice play ferguson
we cant stop them at all now
great
holding 78
fergy
fuck this shit
fuck this
fts
d made big ben look like a hofer i mean he probably is already but still
yikes
all momentum has swung to the steelers
so what are yall drinking lol
it isnt fucking christman please stop gifting them
please wake the fuck up offense

please
all right time to set the tone like in the 1st half come on boys
great exactly what u need a mayfield ad
man i mean im not even surprised you keep giving the ball back to a semicompetent offense and theyre going to start putting points up this is on lamar
we need some better set up pass plays man this is just laughable
was fucking dean pees calling the defense
do not fuck this up come on
alright boys time to pull out a signature win
get lamar into a flow screens slants etc rocket science i know
this is getting ridiculous
we need a drive lamar no 3 and out and definitely no turnover no excuses man come on do better this is a pathetic performance
can no one get open lamar has all the time in the world but is never able to pass before he has to just run it for something
lamar is the anti mvp this year have defenses just figured him out or is it something else passes are off and he is hesitant to run
lamar completely changes his base and blocks half the field dobbins was open for 78 yards
i died for a second there
thats so lucky
stop fucking dropping back
fuckin a
ball control
this game is going to give me a heart attack
lamar with the incredible sidearm but jfc andrews hold onto the ball heart attack
that was a fine play to andrews but we literally cant execute an aerial offense on schedule
skura powned
stop holding onto the ball
wasted down we keep doing this lmao
can we fire roman
impressive
loved that run attempt
can we replay the last 7 minutes
what a read
playing like its a downpour jesus this is frustrating
our line makes me so sad skura is absolute cheeks
this was shit
hey we got a first down that drive
nobody even thought of touching him
play action on 3rd and 8 wtf are we doing
if we could have just moved it to field goal territory
feels like the 2010 divisional
wait why was hill in
defense please step up we need the offense bailed out
me this entire game
need the d to come up big here
is it a over reaction to fire the oc coming off this poorly prepared vs a defense that we should know well no accountability severe step back for lamar and play calling we go get a possession receiver in boykin hardly used in two years go get another fast play maker in duvernay have speedster hollywood and cant even give them a chance aj brown and fulgam had 300 yards total cobb 100 yards where is our passing game ah tahts right we cant throw
wtf is that playcall playing scared or something
i dont understand why we dont run short pass plays to get the offense going our wrs dont extend plays just stand there waiting for the ball lamar has apparently lost his high football iq the play calling is completely archaic and pathetic the oline is pathetic even at full health like wtf
im more concerned with the fact that when we do pass the ball on early downs which makes it easier on the offense we cant do shit if im edc im calling every team for a receiver but then again this doesnt look like our year and we need a lt now so not sure mid season trade is right
pick or strip sack common
another thing is our absent pass rush yet again
alright good stop
big
nice job d
defence really trying to win this game
keep us in it d
alright lets reset
short field we need a score
thank fuck
need a score on their drive

otherwise this could get ugly
good field position good time to run the ball but watch
great field position again lets see if lamar can do literally anything positive
we needed a drive starting at midfield we need to run hold onto the ball hopefully come away with 7 but at least get 3 no more turnovers
defense looked so dialed in today
run the ball
please offense do something
this is why you cant just run
wow the steelers really are scared of our secondary and defense
lets turn it around
again a waste
they have lj figured out steelers games are gonna be rough for our guy
i dont care who wins at this point its 340 and it isnt even the 4th quarter yet let the game move along this is ridiculous
honestly has lamar thrown the ball away under pressure this game
bring in dez bryant next week
we need to do a better job on offense whatever we have is not working
i really hope ronnie is okay or our oline will be even more messed up
duvvvvvv
we went downfield
should have been a td
oh look we are allowed to go deep
fuck yeaaaaa
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv
the protection wasnt great but can lamar not just crumble and take endless sacks he doesnt even need to fucking run just get out and throw it away or throw in the area of someone hes playing like im fucking playing quarterback and not one ofthe most athletic guys in the league
pretty much the whole year except the browns game the offense has ranged from unimpressive to downright bad this is extremely concerning
why arent we running the fucking football we overreact to the other team having a lead like pussies i simply dont understand it
okay okay
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuv
beautiful fucking throw
a dime to duv
the corners are gonna have to force a fumble at the steelers own 20 yard line for us to even have a chance to score now lovely
great throw great catch lets go
lets hope that changes the momentum of the game
signs of life
duuuuuuuuuuu
duvernayyyyy
lamar shouldnt throw
wtf was that
lets fuckin go man we needed that
duv
thats the type of big play we need
more playing time for duvernay please i fucking love this kid
duvernay yesss
coming back
oh look duvernay does something with his chances
finallly
okay yeah my stream is definitely on a lag im guessing we actually moved the chains
coming back
duvernay
a better throw and he can catch and run
that boy fast
yessssss literally been waiting since week 1 for another play like that
obviously we cant really see if anyone is open or getting any type of separation buts lamar does indeed have enough time to make quick decisions and throw but hes hesitating idk if thats because of above or hes a bit gun shy now he hasnt dropped back and confidently thrown a ball all game even the completions hes hesitated before throwing
fuuuuuck no holding
duvernay is the only offensive player im happy with this year except for stanley
whens someones open lamar can suddenly throw
dude fuck everything
of course a hold
hope that quiets some down on here for a while
holding
offf course it came back
god fucking dammit skura
whhhhyyyyy
id like some misdirection in the run game please steelers are just flowing with it
nice rob us
like even when watt is 2nd level he still makes a tfl
of course the o line fucks up again
fuck the refs
really
skura i swear to god
fuck
are you kidding me
thats like our second deep bomb this season
thats gonna be on us
nice refs
holy shit a receiver got open down field
dont you dare take that mfer out of the game ever again
ffs refs screw you
god damnit
wow
duv needs to be 1
skura is gaaaaarbagggeee
getem llama
were our own worst enemy
bullshit call
willie fucking snead
snead has been a beast this game
i wanna see us play pissed get this shit
ugh
ok now lets get some redemption and let lamar run it in
all my homies hate the refs
snead with the yac
i swear snead never does anything but when he does its big
snead just ubered minkah
good
nice fucking play willie get those yards back
willie snead was asked how does he feel

he said mmmmm im feelin dangerous
fuck man lamar needed that confidence boost of a td
ffs lamar makes a great play and skura holds
lol what a weak call
refs cant help but stay involved

announcers are cowards for not calling that shit weak
thats the tickets tackiest hold iver ever seem every play is a damn hold then
lamar finnally looking like lamar
fuck you refs well score again anyway
greg roman fucking sucks man
lord
ok now again
i could make that read
out of bounds
too small
ball dont lie
thats close but i think hes out
maybe he has possession early while that left toe is still down
knees down td
did anyone see the catch review in the dolphins game

shin was down

why doesnt that apply here
the knee
bites nails
lamar threw it too high prolly thought wtf seeing him that open lol
its in the shins
hmmm i think we scored with that right knee
so damn close
this happened with refs last year too man fuck this shit
i still like the challenge even if it changes
they should give it to us for that bogus hold
jesus this dear best buy ad is creepy af
right foot and right knee went down before he rolled out of bounds
maybe the refs give us one back for the horsehit hold and dpi earlier but probably not
knee was half in i think honestly i think half hits the purple half hits the white

funny enough im actually writing an article right now on how the review process could be made better in football
was he in control of the ball before his knee went down i say hes in but im biased
theyre not going to overturn it off but his right knee was down in the endzone
top of his shoe hit
call stands not a td
barely tapped with the tip of his shoe
the shin looks to touch before the knee but thats being generous
x200b

call stands
call stands
right call bad challenge by harbaugh
im a little pissed they didnt rule it a td on the field and let it be automatically reviewed thats the shit i would hope for
yessir
lets go
there ya go
i take back what i said fuck yeah
hate to say it but that throw wasnt good enough hollywood was open and the pass led him way too much

rodgers or mahomes drops that in the basket for an easy catch
im okay if they just try to run in it these next few downs w or l dont pull a pete carroll
we will not be denied
jesus thank fuck
hollywood be like happy now losers
ok ill give roman a pass on this drive that was some good play calling in the red zone
why oh why cant llama be this tidy on more passes
i live to see the refs try call that back
fuck around and try hell do it again anyway
letsg ooooogogogogogogooooooooooooooo
fuck em baby
lets fucking go lamar is looking more confident this drive thats what we need
yessssss
lets gooooooooo
thanks for showing up guys massive drive
wait guys im new to football the play they reviewed when he caught the ball his foot was in why dont they check the foot just the knee cuz you pleas explain
fuck the steelers
bengals defense is lowkey not that bad this yr tbh
takeaway
great drive kinda bad throw on the first td catch but he was decisive this drive looking great
of course ben gets the flag
fuck off refs holy fuck dude
late hit mcphee
i believe we can win this
im so done with these refs fr
they can not call that roughing the passer
the bank would be rocking if the stands were full
time for a big turnover
he fell into stfu romo again
good job ref for picking up the flag good job
claypool so damn good he almost got that
good shit refs pick that flag up
why would bowser come in there when ben is already tied up
bonds straight gave up lol
peters playing huge since that first penalty
what was bonds doing after that catch
why is bonds getting so much time
big relief
38 was like wot
get 38 out of the game
gotta finish the tackle
what the fuck is bonds doing
holy shit the refs got one right
thank you if lamar can keep taking shots so can he
what was bonds doing
rumor says real fan dan been camping in the bank since last season so he could avoid lockdown protocols
38 wtf
wtf bonds
38 just let go of that play wth
bonds you dick that was a catch
i recognize this crew and i feel like they hate us
why did he just give up after enron caught it
who the fuck is this bonds guy never heard of him until today and hes made a couple mistakes
these refs are going to end me pick up your flag you pricks
steelers playing the old flacco ref ball game
every player in my fantasy team is injured this game but hey at least i got 6 points from hollywood
bro whos 38
cmon
where was the facemask
bondswelcome to the league
gets bonds off the field dudes getting clowned play after play
terrell that was a bad beat
wtf was 38 doing on that play
bonds needs to not be on the field
bonds is frank walker jr
bonds omfg
why is bonds on the field the fuck
did marlon miss and punch his helmet
clark cmon
yeah thats a flag
good call here unfortunate penalty
chuck you cant do that
that wasnt a face mask
ravens are beating themselves
what the fuck are these calls
at some point we gotta stop helping the steelers
brain fart by clark
thats not a foul dude you can tackle b5 the neck wasnt a face mask at all
pressures been great all game
unbelievable
whos 38 just gave up
this pressure is getting close we need a sack
can we stop w these fuckin penalties
who the fuck is this bum 38
our dline needs to learn you need to wrap his arms
terrel bonds isnt good
he is getting targeted non stop
this defense
bad tackle around his neck wtf
damn yall you could have had that
fucking christ
come on
im losing my sanity
holy fucking fucking fuck
this game is a bitch im concerned about indy now
who is bonds and why is he in
dude this defense is so easily exploitable
marlo could have had that we got this
easy touchdown
ah fuck they took the lead d is gassed and theyre getting sloppy
ben pulling joe flacco special
someone punch this ref in the face
egg the refs house
will we ever stop playing man coverage
lets see what lamars made of
of course they dont give us the first there of course
dobbins is the goat
dobbins is the real deal
was dobbins a gymnast his balance is the best ive ever seen
i love gus but my god man just run through him
know what the afcn and the nfcw have in common playing the nfce
oh man 2019 welcome back
fitzpatrick was going in on that ankle what a piece of shit
the option pitches while gimmicky feeling still are working so i cant say shit one bit if it works it works
that lil toss by the offensive lineman at the end lol
our boys are bigger than yours type football
this game should be 2414 mental errors man
we arnt abandoning the run im gonna bust
pound the rock
pls run
4 down territory
decent run couldve called a better play
uhoh
why does google say the game is delayed
wtf man
they have to go
this game has been insane
well fuck
cmon
gus and lamar option

if we going for it anyways why not call a run play that 3rd down
high stakes drama
this isnt good for my heart
come on please
are we goin for it
ahhhhhhhhhhhhh


ahhh

ahhhhhhhhhhh
i say feed project pat
fingers crossed
i cant watch
oh man this is football
lets go boys

welp
well fuck me
fucking kill me
fuuuuuuuck
why
dafuq

youre fine youre good they got this itll be okay stop shaking dont poss yourself
that was a helmet to helmet hit
i would have rather thrown that
welp
what was that play
awful just awful
get fucked greg roman they knew terrible play calling do a better job
what the fuck was that play call youve gotta be fucking shitting me
the pass game is gone
disgusted in this team
booooooooooo
about time we get a better center
fuuuuuuuuuck
pathetic
thanks lamar and greg gg
welp there goes the division
fuck
you know it will make it even sweeter to beat them on turkey day
horse shit play call absolute horse shit
what a stupid playcall no creativity whatsoever
cant believe i woke up at 500am for this shit
welp
i need some statistics on 5 wide does it ever work for us
theyre gonna get this game over
there goes the division
queeeeeeen
so about 1 minute to go maybe 60 yards with no timeouts and we need to score a td
do they fake it here
idc about the play call but we wasted 240200 by being slow to the line we could have had given them the ball back before the two minutes warning just doing dumb shit all fucking game
well see
hope that shitsburg coach gets fined for keeping his mask under his chin the whole game
believe
come on special teams lets go big play
proche run that shit back
come on ravens
my stomach hurts lol
time to pray
lets see if we can throw it down the field and get dpi calls like they have been all fucking game
you have to go deep onceto draw a flag or grab it
8 seconds boiswtf are we doing
oh no
who caught that
lets fucking gooooooooo
what
lol
what would that have done
that was a lazer
complete luck
he didnt even try to extend the play what the actual fuck is the coaching doing
someone looked open up the left sideline maybe hollywood
we beat ourselves for sure but i do believe at the very least we exposed the steelers that winning streak is about to come to a swift end
ahhhh i know mannnn

if lamar cant make up for his mistakes and come out this game with a w we really need to start a dialogue on whos going to be the qb of the future of this team not even overreacting its the cold hard truth
removed
fees like a wrap on the season
why do yall act surprised lamar had one goof game against the browns and has looked like a regressed qb the rest of the season
totally acceptable performance by the qb keep down voting all criticism flock nation super bowl here we come
lamars playing bad but its against a great defense
blame of the game lamar jackson for two terrible interceptions that gifted the steelers 14 points
welp season is over
if stanley is out thats a wrap on the season
fuck tj watt
thats a sprain that same injury happened to nick chubb week 3
stop passing greg you dumb mother fuck you know the ol cant protect even when our starters were playing now we got 2 backups and shits all flipped around they cannot protect lamar you cant be that fucking dense you dumb shit harbs gotta pull rank
yeah we aint winning this unless the defense generates points
lamar is legit trash this year
lets keeping running plays that havent been working this year

roman
never seen a ravens team blow a game so bad as we have
lets be real itll be oh were almost there on o they threw coverages we didnt see not true and blah blah blah

lamar fucked up and roman is putting us in losing football get rid of roman
marlon has been way too quite today
now we dont have an offense or defense what do we do
hard to believe this qb was mvp
im sorry lamar looks pathetic today fucking cringe
game on the line and lamar doesnt have it in himfuck that hurts to say

lamar cant pass for shit missed andrews wide fucking open at 10 yards away
rip 2020 ravens see you all next year
you guys are soft af complaining about tj playing physical

is lamar playing through an injury hes looked off the whole season
lamar cant read a defense i hate to say it but his decisions cant make me believe otherwise
that was a legit pi cant hold the jersey that long
dude fuck our staff they put mekuri in who is a liability and players get hurt because of it
fuck tj watt
fuck tj watt this sucks so much
dirty af
should be 210
its not a penalty on the hit to lamar he was a runner its not that hard guys
judon is an idiot
judon cant set the edge cant pass rush has retarded amount of unnecessary roughness penalties idk how anyone can defend him

he is garbage
uh oh ben needs an injury excuse now
is harbs a mouth breather
how to stop our offense do nothing roman will stop calling plays that work
this d is giving it up in the second half two games in a row

little pressure and wide open receivers
stop passing lamar god damn you worked on your passing ability my ass
you lose 4 starters turnover the ball 4 times and lamar obviously had a curse cast on him because i dont know what the fuck is happening with him
lamar buckles under pressure prove me otherwise
yeah im fucking turning this off

throw the ball away dont take a sack dont take the hit dont lose yards football iq at zero right now

this honestly has to be the worst ive ever seen lamar play ever
fuck you skura
lmao at trying to blame lamar for that thats just shit body control by brown he could have brought that left foot down
thats all on fucking greg what an awful play call the run is killing them and we go 5 wide
game is over lmao
we dont deserve another chance to win but we get one i have little faith we can march up the field but i will belee
horrible decision to throw it to andrews there
ifc what ppl say that was a good ass game
no oline to help the guy no wonder he does some questionable stuff
that shouldve been a flag tbh
this game is over the steelers will win

lamar looks like a scrub rn
i get people not being thrilled about being in this position but pittsburghs 60 for a reason this was never going to be easy ravenssteelers is never easy

were down by four lets ram it down their throats delete the rest of the third quarter and most of the fourth quarter and cap it with a td to seal the win
did the mvp award get to lamars head dont understand how hes regressed like this
fuck cbs i dont give a fuck what tj lesser watt has to say
today we need to establish that we are still the 2nd best team in the afc and a top 35 team in the nfl
its fine lets stay positive boys we can do this its still very very early
why is he throwing in traffic
greg roman already calling a bad game and lamar still in his funk
was that an rpo read that shit
saved by the penalty
i mean they took a shot but he was still in bounds lucky call
pittsburgh d looks scared
he must have heard this subreddit talking trash all week
ya need my job so i can still not make enough to afford anything
peters is a fucking bonehead sometimes
call it on every single play then because thats not pi
lamar plays with no fucking poise
fuuuuck
got damn it is that not a pass
lamar will learn we got this
stanley gets injured a fuck ton
seasons over boys
fuck the steelers
hes ok
looks like broken leg tibiafibia
screw you squeelerburgh
honestly the l will hurt less knowing were basically turning into the eagles
just get a fg please
jk88 lolq 1a dpeixa0au
they gonna eject judon
i wanna know who on the ravens coaching staff told lamar to stop running dude is not a pocket passer run the fucking ball kid
holy shit that field judge is a fucking bitch
what a shit fucking call fuck this garbage ass league
moron cant wait until hes someone elses problem
judon is done man hes useless
this league is so fucking soft fuck this bullshit
just suspend judon for the season
this is such a rough and dirty game feels like 2008 with way less superstars on the field lol
judon literally good for a stupid penalty every game
glad it didnt amount to points but it helped them in the field position battle
this has been an hour long kick in the balls so far
lamar is trying to give this game away
no not gus please dont tell me hes hurt
not again
thats on boykin
throw the fucking ball overhand what the fuck
fucking jv shit
i dont even know whose jersey to get anymore u like too many of these guys xd
maybe we should resign flacco just to play against pittsburgh s
good job lamar brought them right back into the fucking game
this game should be over
one good offensive drive and all of you will change your minds

this game was a win if not for that last floated pick by lamar im legit disgusted just the fucking shittiest decisionmaking by him today

i have to let it go because its making not able to enjoy the game anymore
looking like the jets out there
simple reason this game is getting away from us veteran leadership
come on lamar btw trump is going to lose
wow that has to be justice hills first snap of the season
these refs suck cock
ah the narratives are going to be great tomorrow i would be ok to lose with lamar playing great and not losing stanley but lamar playing terrible and us losing one of the most important guys on the team is even worst games probably over with that drive i dont know if our defense can stop them anymore i mean atleast were 52 and still loads of season to go but wow man
hes cooked at least for today
why take that sack cmon lamar
no ability for lamar to throw a quick hitter and immediately sacked why cant he throw the football well
lamar is 2 blame
how many fucking tds can they take away from us
how the fuck did his left foot stay suspended in the air
why are we challenging thats not a catch
thats a td
knee was in
thats a motherfucking touchdown man
im not one to go on the internet and criticize a pro athlete butyou cant toe tap that
bad throw that punk ass bitchhhhhhhssssss
3 yard td pass to marquise brown and now we lead 2421
self inflicted gunshot wounds no team in the nfl does it more consistently than the ravens
lamar seems to be wanting to run less probably trying to prove hes a good qb even without his running ability either way hes screwing over my fantasy team
a pick 6 would be nice isnt ben contractually obligated to throw at least 2 a game
this team man
first half ravens d lights out

second half ravens d pure dogshit
nice
please dont run an rpo you gotta do some kinda pass
holy fuck lamar fucking sucks
just so disappointed in lamar
nice no running back on teh field
whatever this was refball anyways on to the next one
can lamar make the big play pittsburgh can
heres hoping for a butt fumble by the steelers or a strip rnman fuck these refs for real man
lamar lost the game at the start and at the end but we cant ignore another week of awful awful play calling something needs to be done
lets hope we can get this wild card spot
between bad calls and offense giving up points defense has balled out
greg roman is senile as shit if he thinks that was a good play call on 4th
stupid mistakes aside we have been by far the better team today
now they gotta pass
really pathetic
dammit lamar that throw was awful
wasted so much time
spike
wow what a fucking joke
bye week seems to hurt our momentum because we are young team
our own fault for losing this game
for all you fairweathers shitting on lamar relax its wet out there and somebody studied some film on lamar to see he throws low hell adjust
watt gonna be diving at lamars knees now
cant believe im saying this but

rg3 would do a better job than lamar rn lamar is playing that badly he is playing like a guy who wants to be benched

his decision making has been awful all game
tj watt is a fucking spaz
removed
if we lose this it is 100 on lamar

dumb shit all game
get your fucking foot down thats torrey smith 2011 level of terrible
lol no pi there get absolutely fucked
steelers played awful but lamar played the worst game of his career
removed
this is why we were so hesitant to extend him
our line was already shit

see you guys in april

how is jj such a nice dude but his brother is such a little shit
every time i see lamars fucking face today its just a look of absolute confusion
we need to come to the realization that we are not as good as we say we are
removed

lamar is already down and youre going to come out rolling into the best linemen when he is facing away from you everyone knows thats the riskiest play vs linemen rolling up from behind fucking cheap shit watt
another dirty tackle by watt s
pff injury analyst

ravens lt ronnie staley suffers a major injury just after signing a massive contract prediction ankle fracture dislocation but should be ready for week 1 in 2021
judon a clown
can we trade judon for tj watt
fucking pathetic display of throwing by lamar

we are not winning any fucking play off game if we have to rely on lamar throwing the ball and its not even debatable at this point he flat out blows at passing
lamar needs to find a way to get his confidence back in the passing game he seems so damn nervous sometimes this year in spots where he looked so confident last year that titans game messed with his head
i feel like people arent taking into account how ridiculous that pick was for a linebacker still a bad decision but that was a redonk play for a linebacker
its almost like pedophiles shouldnt be in the nfl hmmm
this team has no leadership
why isnt lamar playing well loudly exclaims the fan of the team with an injured line missing starters and completely covered receivers down the field

look at tony romo

season on the line here
tj watt did nothing wrong
james harrison and troy polamalu are the only steelers i like
imagine if they had waited on the extension
if lamar continues like this next year im done with him
steelers remaining undefeated meanwhile our season is pretty much over with 2 ol injuries what a great fucking sundayman im pissed its like lamar thinks its funny too
all the shit fans in this thread acting like lamar is the one giving up chunk yardage on defense

this whole team is collapsing right now

edit fairweather racist fans btfo
lets be honest with 4 turnovers by lamar we had no business winning that game
jesus guys hes playing a really tough defense yeah hes played a bad game but like cmon game aint over yet
2 runs back to back i dont like the play calling at all
god i hate lamar this season
not lamars fault nothing you can do there
if lamar throws another pick then fucking throw in rg3 lamar is playing like shit if we lose its on him and if we win he was holding us back god damn
all of you wishing bad on tj get a life it wasnt on purpose suck a chode fuckwads
just tuned in anything interesting happen
what a shit call

wr got ran down by a lb
steelers offense aint shit anyway
hollywood needs to do a fumble drill
thats a torn acl reaction
yall think that was a dirty hit
we got the ball on their side of the field and wont even get a fg out of it this offense is legit sad
lamar gonna be the next to get hurt if he keeps taking these shots
hahah wtf is this game we should honestly be down by like 2 scores
all i know is if im close to ben im gonna aim for that elbow
lamar sucks bro
were going to lose
also lamar can you please stop sidearming it when theres no need to
lamars playing so great hes definitely not part of the problem
fire greg fuxking roman
just like the beginning of the game not worried one bit
at the end of the day if you told me we could be up 1714 in the third id take it
maybe the football is to wet for lamar
im done fuck this
its all on lamar
thats a td
right kneee down
lamar that throw has to be better to a wide open receiver in the end zone
lamars passes are so wobbly lol
wow defense is shit 8 pass plays 2 penalties a wide open guy when we drop all but 3
the ravens havent beaten a good team this season
how did i know roman would run it up the guy that was a stupid play call absolutely dumb
does romo know how bad lamar is when playing from behind
look what its like having a qb who can complete a pass oo
guys i think lamar this season may not be very good qb
ravens need to finish the job on his arm

arm for a leg
gotta respect ben he will throw his arm off to come down from a deficit in the 2nd half
wild card here we come we need the underdog status to play xd

thats season over for him and honestly for us the weakest part of the team somehow just got worse
steelers fan here hate to see any player go down like that hoping for his speedy recovery

edit it seems as though this came off as disingenuous which was not my intention thanks for the downvotes i guess
i think lamar might be a little scared today hes getting popped quite a bit and nothings been called yet and he doesnt seem like normal lamar


who gets the next pick im going with fitzpatrick seems like a lock
chop block tj watt
goodbye season
removed
pittsburghs defense is elite remember that 49ers game last year we havent looked any worse today than we did against them i dont see much difference honestly
amazing play by watt

horrible call
we couldnt at least get a fg

watt is so dirty
please dont put brown at lt dudes way too slow to play that side
there is no way on gods green earth that lamar will last in the nfl if the ravens keep running him head first into the defence
removed
last year we scored 2 tds in 2 minutes now we cant even get to the 50
fire marty and pees
go fucking empty set what the fuck is this shit dobbins is averaging over 5ypc fucking retarded in everyway

how do any fans defend this shit our viewership is their b his team is not an sb team its a playoff team with glaring weaknesses including oc ol dl and wr
this team man
i understand its a rivalry but jesus make it a game
it sucks because while it should be a td the fact lamar cant touch pass these really pisses me off
sorry but this ones on lamar
removed
stanley always finds a way to get injured hope hes good
lamar big game choker time and time again
lamar can for real suck a dick
everyone who here who says we cant throw consistently or good lamar is in his 3rd year now is when we find out if he is gonna be our franchise guy if we csnt throw we need a new qb right like i dont get the argument
great play glad lamar isnt side arm throwing lol its going to be a long match their d is quickly penetrating hopefully we capitalize on that
oh nvm that was dpi
lets go boys
god i fucking love this fucking tank
that play right there shows me we need dez on the field asap so you can throw the 5050 in that situation
whelp might as well work on cap space now
ow when you cant walk off the field thats bad
you guys can beat anybody if you just play your game
i have a feeling were gonna hit ben hard this series
were all losers today if stanley is out
im sure its just my bias but it seems like romo is on overdrive kissing steelers ass this game
flag on peters
dirty ass team
fuck off judon
bye judon
bye bye judon

get the fuck off this team
release him
video replays are able to be reviewed by officials to get the plays right coaches can challenge a couple plays if they think things were called wrong to force refs to go back help ensure they get the call right why is the same not allowed for penalties why can penalties carry more consequences with less oversight no fucking sense to me
like clockwork ben is being a big babby and playing up minor injuries
lamar what are you doing
dude come the fuck on lamar
apparently lamar cant throw anymore
lucky break
yikes throw
why not try to pick it
greg the fat fuck roman strikes once again oh what a surprise yeah lamar has made terrible decisions but even romo is calling gro out why arent we running for fucks sake
id rather lamar play bad and we win this game than lamar play good and we lose he can always bounce back like last year for example
wait what did judon get ejected for
alright lamar now is the time to put the team on your back
they score here itll be hard to comeback and win
they pull pitchers dont they
that was a bad throw to a wide open receiver but ill take it
good holding call but also damn shame what a run by lamar
lamar shoulnt throw again
fuck the refs eat my dingus
he got the knee down
that looked in dang
left foot wasnt in
the knee is gonna be clooooose
this better be overtuned cant afford to blow timer outs in this type of game
beat the refs and the steelers they drive boys
but the refs are against us
alright that was a decent call
is this lamars fault too
no faith in the o for this drive feel like were gonna need a defensive stop
go raiders and bengals helped us out today
this is game
put in trace
i hate this team we csnt even throw for 3 yards
and a fumble lost to add insult to injury
run the option averaging 9 yards on either side i dont see why you dont do it again
imagine if we kicked a fg hindsight 2020
lol this is embarrassing
jesus what a shitty pass to andrews
offense as a whole should be ashamed of themselves honestly

yes

not about the injury about the catch
this is poor
fuck greg roman
room is a shill
lamar lmao
tj might be the dirtiest player ive seen all year dude is reckless
3rd and 18 youre being tackled and lamar throws a 5 yard pass that could easily get picked lamar sucks this season
how the fuck did lamar win mvp
well this season is over
yo anyone else worried jimmy is gonna tear his achilles he had that injury all of 2017 then tore it in december now hes nursing it again
i dont want to be this guy but is it time to put in rgiii lamar is still a good qb but hes our biggest liability rn
hate to say this shit but feels like 70 steels
not sure the ravens could do anything this year anyway with lamar forcing himself into becoming a passing qb but stanley gone means the season is done
so earlier you guys were blaming lamar now you all talking about the defense lmfao you guys are funny
sorry but lamar is the paul george of the nfl big game choker
its almost like all the interceptions turnovers didnt happen and its all the refs fault
this is all lamars fault

you guys are all fucking whiny babies the only that matters from this game is if we win or not and were up by 3 with the fucking ball gtfoh lamar is having a bad day but thats our mvp and we gonna beat this undefeated steelers team
hot take just forfeit to save the season its painfully obvious tomlin is coaching these players to target our best players legs just get out of the game and live to fight another day
yes cheat them
honestly pit has this in the bag just simply defend vs the run we cant throw short medium or god forbid long
the refs made lamar drop the ball fuck them
hate to say it but lamar needs to benched

so about that contract
not stanleys fault by i have had reservations about paying him hes a great tackle dont get wrong but with the exception of last season hes not made it through a full season hes injury prone
there goes your season
injuries happen get over yalls selves sheesh
removed

removed
lamar has been a liability this game and it fucking sucks
i wanna know who on the ravens coaching staff told lamar to stop running dude is not a pocket passer run the fucking ball kid
never get why returners catch the ball at the 5
another awful throw by lamar that will surely get boykin blamed
do we blame this on boykin too
all that and we only at the 35 wtf
maybe we can finally see that lamar is a horrible passer
i just dont want to pay lamar 35 million he already peaked
were not going to win
kc pit fucking got our number offense and defense

edit kc offense and pit defense
lamar fucked up saw him hit his chest he knows hell get it done ben is trash
ive just reverted back to not giving a shit this season
removed
cant even get happy
yeah thats a hold fuck
if tj did that you guys would lose your minds
lamar instead of hitting snead or dobbins at the first down marker takes 2 yards to make it 4thseriously
awful clock management
look for passes man
hollywood brown is wide open on the right there wtf he coulda picked up the 1st and got out of bounds
bread allen looks like hes 5 years old
this game is over we suck
not a playoff caliber team
lamar doesnt look like the lamar that amazed everyone last year
thats how you play after your bye
ill keep saying it but there is a reason greg roman keeps having to get new jobs and we are seeing it his playcalling has been awful
just turned it on can someone do a tldr of what ive missed
removed
what happened to lamar


he is playing like the worst qb in the league
harbs mask is ugly af
lamars feet were still inbounds when he got pushed idk the interpretation of the rule tho
yeah guys that was so dirty cant believe he tried jumped at his ankle

ravens gonna raven
snead is so slow for a small guy lmao
removed
unwatchable
ok roman call 20 straight runs
mvp
st fumble thats how today has been
boo him who gives a fuck they all get paid millions more than we ever will
removed
id give lamar another season as the qb with a new oc but if hes still playing like this dudes gotta go
stanley hurt shocker
people finally seeing that lamar is part of the problem on offense

15 downvotes lol you people really think lamar is joe fucking montana
there shouldnt have been more time everyone ran down the field then pittsburgh took a timeout due to an injury those things happened in succession
when do i get all my downvotes back
wait are yall really done with lamar or is this some in the moment frustration
still cant forgive the fact that this game should be 247
haha
no chance here

hollywood is another in the tradition of bust wrs the ravens drafted

you just saw that fumble right

you guys seriously expect us to be 142 every season no shit lamar looks like he regressed
defense being exposed now
good fucking game guys refs looked real sus buuuut 70 feelsgoodman

our defense is about as inconsistent as our offense this year

is special teams next
lmao yall choke in every big game with lamar

removed
jackson to snead ftw yuck

gotta target boykin or something
peters is a whiney bitch

refs vs steelers pathetic
the bus is in the hall of fame not some average ravens player find a new nickname
interception jackson gonna choke

3 n out lol

this is a bold move but i would not be angry if we benched lamar this game no longer matters we do not want him to get hurt

i believe your friend is a steelers fan
how did that go
dang mabye shoulda watched the game then talked shit

this is amazing you might not get the credit you deserve since everyone is in the gameday thread

but this is art
im gonna upvote the username but im too tired to figure this out
with ingram out who do you think is the better fantasy start at rb

i think gus may get more carries and would be a more likely choice at the goal line however i think dobbins could be a better choice in my ppr league
gus
probably gus he plays well against pittsburgh and with wet conditions dobbins holding the ball makes me nervous

lets get it
removed
shit we just scored
calm down lol
theres a game thread for these kinds of posts comments isnt there

fuck this game
fuck
there goes our post season
removed

same i missed part of the game but just watched the fumble and am hype rn
hardnosed ol school smashmouth football at its finest

lamar threw pick 6 we score on next drive helped by questionable personal foul call and great qb play pit gets a makeup pi call but fumbles next play
whelp
baltimores offense is literally the only guys to score so far
stanley getting carted off the field looks bad
i know shit looks bleak but the steelers are 60 against some shit teams outside of their last game and are playing thier best we are 51 playing some of the worst football when we know we can improve but i have faith it clicks this game later we are easily the best defense theyve played we got this go ravens




editnevermind
nice edit
dont say never mind have faith in your team the ravens will still fucking win

please just take my knee instead
im just happy he got his bag this week this is just unlucky as fuck love him with my whole heart
same
feel terrible for stanley hope for a quick recovery but clearly hes done for season

speaking of the season there it goes

our line is the biggest need especially with stanley down
ol is in need all over the league unless the ravens give up 1st2nd rounders they wont get anything of worth
maybe we could get ogden to come outta retirement worth a shot right should be well rested
ol hardly gets dealt unless you are bad at being a gm
wed have to get like 3 new olinemen to even have a decent line at this point we cant trade our way out of this were fucked
anyone know where i can get that md flag mask hes sporting today its slick and works with glasses
im willing to bet john just gets these things off of mall carts
this is it yeah from route one apparel

looking like the run game we had last year
gus is straight up one of the most underrated players in the league
jk is fast as fuck and has incredible balance he reminds me of another ravens rb 27
jk is a star
i love ingram but his injury and dobbins balling out probably means hes cut next year saves us 5m which we could really use to extend ngakoue especially with the cap dropping by as much as 25m
greg roman
that lamardobbins option play is unstoppable lolwho do you take

aaaand its gone
it helps that the starting rbs have some juice love ingram but hes looked slow all year
i love how it took him 6 games and a bye week to adjust but cant adjust mid game or after halftime

it was a legal hit lamar doesnt have qb protection when he runs
removed
ingram just doesnt have explosion anymore gus and especially jk are both easily better then him
i dont think hell be shipped because of his impact in the locker room but i do think hell take a lesser role

that old ref needs to stay at home
i dont think he will get a fine
that was a stupid ejection

old ass refs are power hungry and cant handle being touched on the arm when they pull and throw players around
he touched a ref
lmao based
even if not intentional he has to chill and cant act like that
i mean he is kind of at fault though
cuz hes always doing dumb shit like that fucking moron

judon shows once again his decision making is just fucking terrible
that was a stupid ejection

old ass refs are power hungry and cant handle being touched on the arm when they pull and throw players around
stupidity but it wasnt intentional he still needs to get the fuck out of baltimore
constantly negating positiv plays his teammates probably hate him
dumb move even if it wasnt intentional why are you trying to shake free and throw a coach staff member off of your back what are you going to do from there

just like when a teammate grabs you til you calm down theyre holding you back for a reason no need to flail like a mad man throwing arms
this is just a dumb take
17 million reasons why baltimore wont have anyone calling for him
honestly im glad judon stuck up for peters im not the biggest judon fan but he came through and bodied johnson he did what he had too and should have chilled out after that
he messing up his bag doing that dumb shit
wouldnt be surprised at all if this is his last game as a raven i know im reaching major but edc has been making big moves

the captain took home the win
you made a face like you were kicked in the nuts
ok im a steelers fan but this is funny
not only did he get sacked it fucked with his surgery elbow
howd that go
except capn fat fuck is walking off your field a winner
ass


thats what i keep telling people last season was exciting but it was never this teams bread and butter
say one more time for the people in the back
im not mad about the loss there was stupid errors but we put up almost 300 rushing yards against the top rushing defense and held big ben to 24 yards in the first half if lamar doesnt throw those picks we clean up those fumbles and we dont get those pass interference calls this is a totally different game im confident well fix it by the end of the year we proved today that we are the all around better team just gotta tighten up and play smarter ball was pleased we ran the ball down their throats its like greg roman just remembered thats our biggest strength after stanley went down
pain
the stupid errors are killing me
hollywood turning into twitter fingers is a bad look but yeah back to the foundation defense carries us hope to get some kinda offensive production it flat out seems all offseasons reps with wrs and tes was for nothing no chemistry
can we take a look at someone like eric berry
i have issues with this statement one of the many reasons i picked the ravens as my team is defense first mindset
have
did not age well
i can get behind this though defense wins championships and its how we got our rings
i mean they better bethat is where all the resources are going
uh you were saying

i was reading bens lips he just asked his trainer if he could have his elbow fitted for a walking boot
maybe just maybe its because the ravens are dirty and cheap shot him just a guess

the call was bs but damn dude when youre on the sidelines control your temper hope this game can prove we dont need judon
honestly thats what you get for contacting a ref whether he meant to or not its the rule and has been for awhile sucks but just cant let your anger take over like that
he really shouldnt be fighting his coachs grip like that thats bad teammate stuff there
i agree judon shouldnt be flailing but tbh if youre not allowed to touch a ref they shouldnt be allowed to touch you
imagine if judon was still in this game were getting constant pressure on fat ben

maybe we trade him by the deadline to seattle

give me a tackle

sb guaranteed
judon is a waste of a roster spot


hes drunker than usual today
barely said anything after tucks 51 yarder had his chance to say who the real goat is
hes probably hoping it will like just forget
i dont want him putting that curse on tucker maybe hes secretly hes a tucker fan is trying to jinx the competition
honestly i used to like romos commentary in his first year maybe two with nantz but after hearing him in our games against browns chiefs and steelers he is just as biased as any other announcer and not as good as i thought i cant wait for him to jerk off d henry in 2 weeks even if we have equally as good of a run game that week

nope looks like were back to normal
underrated meme

removed
im not glad hes throwing picks and fumbling but i am glad hes picking himself up and continuing to try to play well after the mistakes
i just want to say i blame that last int on you
not to sound like a lamar hater but its year 3 there really shouldnt be learning anymore at this point its mistakes

not saying its not correctable but they arent learning lessons anymore
when will we see the dividends from these lessons
who knows what happens if that pic6 never happened maybe like a butterfly effect the steelers d has been on the field more and it shows as they are tired
hasnt worked so far in his career whats going to make it different this time


wholesome i have to upvote
nice goodbye sleep
congratulations and welcome to the flock
nice fucking baby bro
as a steelers fan thats a cute baby and as he grows up i trust he will come to the right side
removed
lmao gtfo you a bum
maybe stop throwing the ball the steelers cant stop the run so lets keep throwing it great play calling by the coaching staff
that is on lamar too for throwing a damn duck into the air to be picked off

fucks sake
they have ran 30 times and thrown 16 theyre running pleanty the 716 and 2 ints and fumble are the problem
if you cant trust your qb to throw theres a problem and its not the play caller
i think lamar has as many ints as completed passes just stop it hes starting to look like sam darnold
lamar is all smiling on the sidelines too what the fuck is that ridiculous
why are they so opposed to running the ball defense is playing lights out we have a lead and the run game is working ok lets air this shit out against one of the best pass rushes in the league with our best olineman out

i think thats further proof the wrs are covered
i think he read your comment

removed
are we slandering lamar and hollywood in this sub against the top defense yall are spineless
and everyone was talking about how bulked up hollywood was
removed
roman isnt outh there throwing picks and fumbling this is not on roman
the steelers are playing off coverage yet receivers constantly go deep no fucking crossing routes fire his ass please the only thing keeping us in this one is defense and playmaking from gus and jk
that 4th down play call just confirmed that greg roman is senile as shit
removed
relax he has the worst wr core in the league and an offensive coordinator whos notorious for having a stale passing game
thats what i thought at first too but even the best wr cant do shit when the ball is a few yards away from him if it even makes it to the air
you might be asking too much of him hes just not a passer
correct me if im wrong
very tickytack if thats a hold you could call a hold on at least 50 of the plays of either team
for real
refs win another game
there were 2 on peters that were no exaggeration some of the worst ones ive ever seen

if they called that every time there wouldnt be football it would just be some guy running next to a wr

that ref crew was absolutely fucking horrendous
yep
ehh it was a hold for sure
removed
lol terrell bonds i thought his uni said bones toobut he has been a liability
removed

removed

once again running the ball works but he stops running the ball and we lose wtf come on
everyone blames every coordinator we have every time we lose

every year and every game guys need to execute too man
lol do you realize how hard adjusting and getting used to a whole new oc would be in the middle of the season any fan that agrees with this post doesnt know anything about football and is a bandwagon fan
i agree greg roman needs to go

lamar is garbage this year
im usually on the other side but today he blatantly stopped doing what worked then he brought it back our second to last drive wtf

lamar deserves all the criticism hes going to get from this game he handed pittsburgh 14 points and cost us at minimum a field goal with the fumble at the 7
we could be super bowl contenders if the offense decides to come back from the offseason
ravens lose to the ravens 2824
how did they not add time
why didnt they put time back on the clock because of the injury
steelers game mvp ravens qb lamar jackson
jackson played like shit roman with a terrible call on 4th down before the 2 min warning refs throwing all sorts of flags classic ravens v steelers game that makes me hate the steelers more and more
our offensive line

lt orlando brown filling in for injured ronnie stanley

lg bradley bozeman 3rd year 6th round pick

rg patrick mekari 2nd year udfa filling in for injured tyre philips

rt dj fluker 29 year old rg filling in for orlando brown
ok im salty but romo cracked me up at the end

nantz whats harbaugh saying there

romo hes pointing at his head saying we have to think
my takeaways

hollywood needs to grow like 3 or 4 inches

greg roman should have taken a head coaching job last year and take his playcalling with him

we need to keep mekari at the rg spot from what i saw the running game picked up immensely when he replaced tyre

lamar had one of his worst games as a pro and i pray pray pray that he uses this game as a learning experience but i fear a lot of his issues are mechanics based which can be hard to fix

we need dez to be an anquan boldin level acquisition

that was among some of the worst officiating jobs overall that ive ever seen in any professional sport
can someone explain to me how they dont add time at the end there
greg romans playcalling is fucking atrocious what the fuck is that call on 4th down
i love hollywood dont get me wrong but we missed on metcalf jesus
lamar was brutal
lamar struggled but lets look at this

called pi on ravens for something that shouldve only been a hold

phantom hold on lamars td run and couldnt show where the hold was on replay

phantom pi on humphrey that didnt even try to show a replay of

a clear opi by claypool uncalled

a dq when a 15 yarder was clearly more than enough given the circumstance

edit oh yeah i do want to say that they definitely missed a hold on jimmy too but i think that was a decision because diontae gave up if not tho then thats a bad call too

edit 2 no time added on the injury i was half expecting them to hit us with a 10 second runoff like were the lions

edit 3 we still could have won this game the 4th down qb draw sealed out fate i am not saying the refs lost it we did commit some bad penalties that cost us that were called correctly
fuck the refs
fuck that ending no added time for the steelers force time out no call on the defenseless receiver hit straight hit to the head fuck this dumb shit
youd think an injury would stop the clock when it happened not 15 seconds afterwards
we played like shit but as far as im concerned this is like the 2015 jags game we won there should have been 5 seconds added and an untimed down at the 1 after the dpi side note if anyone else get get shots of the hit much appreciate
we look like a poorly coached team another game of 100 penalty yards
this loss is 100 lamar

he was making terrible choices and really bad throws since the 2nd play to the final play
fuck the refs
ugh and we lost stanley probably for the season fuck man as if the loss wasnt bad enough
bengals fan here they shouldve added more time on the clock after that injury you guys got screwed
complete bullshit not giving extra time i guess anyone can flop and take away time
lamar awful in another big game
2 interceptions almost three three fumbles from lamar 14 points off turnovers for the steelers this loss is all on lamar
so what was romo talking about when he said coach was pointing to his head and talking about a situation that i dont even want to bring up
we gift wrapped this game for the steelers we played horribly except for the run game

lamar played bad and looks off this year although he had a great td run taken away throwing mechanics are weird decision making needs to take a step forward

refs were bad
457 yards of offence to 221 pathetic
are announcers not aloud to talk about targeting
fuck everything
fuck the refs today they have been bad across the league should have been more time on clock for injury time out and clear defenseless receiver hit by steelers there
ravens beat themselves too many pis and lamar was reckless however losing 2 olinemen against the steelers defensive front was killer for pass protection
i 100 guarantee if the situation was flipped a penalty wouldve been called on us on that last play
removed
no mistaking that lamar had a bad game but even still the refs made no mistake as to who they were favoring just bs call after bs call against the ravens and then not adding time at the end whats the justification for that ive seen bad officiating in my life but this might take the cake
fuck the refs
fuck greg roman
god damnit lamar
lamar choked
fuck
im fuming over these refs its embarrassing
i want my 5 seconds fuckheads
lamar sucked steelers arent anything special refs sucked
lamar fucked us on this game without him the steelers dont have 14 of their points and we get some more points
i hate liking a small market team every call is against us
refs were absolute trash but good teams play through that

inexcusable plays by lj that led to 14 points

im still optimistic but gonna be tough sledding to win the divsion after this and the kc game
lamar makes soo many cocky throws and bad decisions because he thinks he can outplay the defense every time problem is he is playing nfl caliber players and they will make the better play sometimes if he just stuck to the free stuff and made the plays that are in front of him we would not have given up 14 of the points we gave up the picksix and the 20 yard line int both were gaming changing

hey not bad for a rb but for a qb yeah pretty bad
greg roman logic

rb averaging 7 yards a carry

4th and 3

calls a qb run
a lot to digest lets start with the good jk looks like a freaking stud d looks legit and the wideouts got wide open multiple times today
now for the ugly lamar looked bipolar today hes still legit but definitely not a good day its hard to win football games with four turnovers shit its nearly impossible granted the injuries but the o line did not look good at the least bit a lot of missed blocking assignments and guys just standing two yards past the line of scrimmage with pitt just running past them ref ball was a true thing today but its not defining reason why we got the l

edit still dont know what the offense scheme was today
horrible game imma go punch something
any reason they didnt add any extra time on the clock after the snead first down could have had one extra play honestly
so fucking pissed
im just fucking sad 5th seed bullshit here we come
at least they didnt stop running the ball when playing from behind
4th and 2 play just run the option that had been gashing them the whole drive and we would be talking about a win
not sure if it would have mattered but i feel robbed about the clock at the end
lamar handed a w to the steelers plain and simple our rbs killed it today but lamar did more for the steelers offense than what he did for our team especially laughing off that 2nd pick which ultimately closed the gap for us to lose

i really hope lamar takes a hard look in the mirror and finds that hungry sb attitude he had last year
by the refs logic heyward should have been called offsides
i dont get how the final play isnt a foul its a hit on a defenseless receiver and dpi i dont get it refs just eat their whistle on the last play unfairly that wasmt a hail mary
get dez on the roster now
john harbaugh said the referees didnt give him an explanation for why no time was given back on the clock after the cameron heyward injury he asked and all they said was the time was fine sgellison
worst 70 team of all time
no added clock and no flag fucking bullshit
this is the first time i can honestly say that lamar singlehandedly cost us a w

2018 first chiefs loss was nearly a win that the defense couldnt hold
2018 po chargers l in the playoffs was a weird one poor predictable playcalling whole offense being dysfunctional
2019 chiefs game on the road was a greg roman disasterclass alongside lamar being inaccurate downfield
2019 browns game had an ingram fumble a ravens defense that was god awful
2019 po titans l was a game where both offense and front 7 failed to show up
2020 the kc loss this year was wild on o dropped passes poor playcalling inaccurate balls but the defense couldnt stop a nosebleed team had little shot to win due to both sides of the ball playing poorly

this game was was different the defense was fine the run game was rolling roman didnt lose his mind as a playcaller until the last couple of drives

lamar gifted them turnover after turnover 4 which included a pick6 redzone fumble and another pick which resulted in a short field td the 4th fumble was a cheap one 4th down qb draw which wouldnt have converted anyways however lamar also threw an interceptable ball to haden and fumbled w no one near him before fumbling

lamar gave them an easy 14pts while taking 37 points off the board for the ravens in what ended up being a 4pt steelers win that was the difference in the game his decision making and field vision were atrocious for most of the game this was basically a repeat of the cincy game for lamar which i called the worst game of his career at the time except pitt caught lamars interceptable throws this time

lamars errors were the difference in the game
no time added so many bullshit pi calls and no pi called on the last play okay refs good for yall
we will need to win the second time around if we are going to take the division we have a great team but itll be tough to win since itll be in pit
the refs were horrible all those nonpis not adding time every time lamar has hit after the play
we can beat them if lamar focuses up im annoyed but not deflated just get to the playoffs

first time losing when leading at halftime
we normally split our season series with steelers as 11 remembered even the best teams go 142
we lost 2 of our oline and still lose to refball
wish i could say that was a fun game between the giveaways and bullshit penalties that aged me a couple of years
im in disbelief that lamar handed our biggest rival a game like that especially with them being 60 what a fucking brutal game
that was major bullshit on the last play that was pass interference
fucking god damn shit we shouldve won
i understand that theres football analysis to be done but the thing that decided this game is that the steelers had 3 penalties for 30 yards and we had 9 for 110 thats the game right there dont try and make it complicated

edit i want to be clear this is not a bitch about the refs post idc how good or bad the calls were the boys left it in the hands of the refs
lamar is honestly playing like one of the worst qbs in the league right now he needs to pick it up and fast if we want to do anything in january
ben could have thrown the ball into the 10th row and they still would have thrown a pi flag on us

yet we get to the endzone and thats a clean play fucking bullshit
i wish i could turn off the internet and skip work for a week to live in a cabin until next sunday why do i even watch this game life is pain
look lamar has very bad turnovers today and it was a bad offensive game

we can acknowledge that and also not say hes terrible and the season is a wash it sucks on to indy
why was harbaugh pointing to his head
lamar played awful defense continued to extend drives with penalties 2 olineman got hurt judon got booted for some bs and only lost by 4 the sub is gonna freak out but well be fine well see them again on thanksgiving move on to the colts
loss aside if this game wasnt a sign that jk dobbins needs to be more involved in the rushing attack consistently going forward then idk what to say
are you allowed to be on the wrong side of the los after the snap if youre injured
these penalties and turnovers man
i am sad i will consume a lot of spaghetti
damn we beat ourselves and possibly lost two starting ol
fuck the refs fuck injuries fuck everyone we should have won this one damn it
wow dude what the actual fuck
question about the game

as a person that doesnt keep up with all of the football games what was the meaning of the ravens head coach pointing a finger at his head and the sports commentators saying that they have to think about something but theyre not saying what somebody please explain this to me
who gets the blame here sure lamar definitely shoulders some of it but lets be honest here so much shit went wrong
injuries
judon getting ejected
refs of course
patchwork offensive line


what can you do everything that could have went wrong went wrong
the only positives are the defense jk and gus the fact that the refs didnt add time is ridiculous and lamar needs to get his head out of his ass he hasnt been doing anything this year too many mistakes and roman dont even get me started
we really need that go to possession receiver andrews does a lot of great things but has drops at times the offense really needs that smith boldin mason guy to be effective with the running

no team is afraid of our receivers outside of andrews and he can be bottled up dobbins and gus should be the 12 moving forward dobbins has some of the best balance ive seen in a long time defense played well outside penalties some of which were pretty ticky tack

maybe dez helps solidify that receiving corp but im looking for a center and reworking the playbook on play calling a bit for next week colts titans steelers again over the next month can really shape the afc
when do the press conferences begin cant wait to hear what everyone has to sag
removed
honestly we lost this game to lamar and to the refs i love him but its the truth this time

crappy outcome but we battled back from the early pick 6 and the late lead change thats encouraging with the prior ways we folded when at a deficit

onto next week congrats to the steelers
confirmed stanley out for season with an ankle injury
we need to stop pretending this was just a series of oneoff mistakes and poor officiating yes the officiating stunk and yes it was raining

but offense has looked like garbage all year with no signs of improving lamar is a bottom 5 passer by every metric and the eye test backs it up greg roman is displaying cam cameron levels of game management after being brilliant last year nothing that happened today was an outlier

to look like this off a bye at home is really bad pittsburgh isnt anywhere near as good as their record and was objectively worse than the ravens for an entire half we handed them this game with their easy schedule its very hard to see baltimore catching them at this point especially with stanley out for the year
hard to win against one of the best teams in the league with 4 turnovers and a backup o line we gotta get better
there were a few costly mistakes and some really bad throws but i think the offense did look better today than they had before the bye going against a defense as stout as pitt is will always be a tough task and they didnt panic stuck with the run and saw success with it

a few suspect playcalls as well and some mistakes to be cleaned up but this team still could do damage later on running out of time to start making those adjustments though cannot get very far with these mistakes

overall im whelmed i was expecting improvement there was some but i was expecting much more
imagine running for 265 yards and having to panic in the 4th to scrap up a game winning drive
everyone missing the helmet to helmet hit that wasnt called on lamar on that awful qb draw on 4th and 3 tho
between lamar having another brutal performance in a big game and stanley likely out long term with a bad injury this was just about the worst possible scenario we could have hoped for
lamar cost us the game here sad but true
hard to beat any team giving away 14 points
ravens coach john harbaugh said officials ran off the field and didnt talk to him about the last play on which he said willie snead took a shoulder to the helmet aaronkazreports

twitter video play in question
refs were garbage this game lamar played terrible honestly im not mad at the play calling at some point we have to see if lamar can pass the ball against good teams and right now it doesnt look like he can the weapons thing is very true when a quarterback is having a tough time dropping back and making defensive coverage reads and making the right pass the way you make up for that is more weapons but that doesnt take away from the fact that im seriously questioning lamar right now i love his story he has a raven mentality but there are limitations right now that are glaring for lamar im not sure what we can do in the next couple days to get more weapons without using a 1st rounder or something of that nature im not sure what his contract situation is like but perhaps trade peters i mean hes served us well but we need more offense right now although this is definitely an overreaction i just wanna put it out there for my peace of mind but i would look at darnold right now i believe he can do a lot better in our awesome organization roman and darnold dont necessarily fit together perfectly but at the end of the day we still get another knock at the steelers lets see how this pans out last thing how awesome were our fans at the game making that much noise wow that was awesome the flock is stronger than ever
ive supported lamar from day 1 and still believe in him but im getting real tired of people letting him off the hook every time he has bad games

sure play calling could be better he probably needs more reliable weapons and its a team game but hes the focal point

we all want the same thing a mvp caliber lamar you dont get that by sweeping aside honest criticism and not holding him accountable as well
that play call on 4th and 3 was one of the worst play calls all season
this is one of the most frustrating losses in recent memory lamar needs to be better no excuses he cant be careless with the football and needs to find a way to figure things out with that being said i think greg roman is a huge issue running the football is so crucial for this team and the play calls have been so fucking inconsistent yes we ran the ball 47 times today but his situational play calling has been abysmal we ended up scoring but before the hollywood td its 2nd goal from the 3 and we ran 3 straight pass plays we seem incredibly predictable right now and we wont make it far if things dont change we need to establish the run early and use it to set up some play action our receiving corp isnt built to move down the field with short passes every play so if we want to be able to throw on early downs forcing the defense to stack the box is a must also why the fuck do we never roll lamar out every single passing play is from the pocket i think rolling him out to the right would be incredibly effective and it also gives him the opportunity to use his legs if he needs to with how bad our pass blocking looked itd also keep lamar from being pressured every damn play tbh it seems like roman is trying to outsmart the other team every single play if he thinks theyre expecting a run he calls a pass idc what the other team is expecting with how we can run the ball we should run it down their fucking throats until they stop us
first of all fuck the refs what a shit show absolutely horrendous calls out there today questionable play at the end of the game aside how do we not get time back on for that injured player crazy

okay but really lamar lost the game for us gifted the steelers 14 points and that was the difference in the game offense was a little more consistent finally running the ball but his three turnovers i guess four with that 4th down fumble killed us pick six fumble in the red zone and then the other int next play ebron scores dude has to be better he will be but dude cost us today
14 steeler points off turnovers in a 4 point game and you fools wanna blame the refs
yall need to take a step back and realize that we have the same record now as we did last year and last year the second loss was to the browns not a peakperforming steelers team we almost beat the best defense in the league even with multiple bad turnovers losing 2 offensive linemen and a starting olb we still ran the ball for 265 yards against what was supposedly the best run defense in the league the refs were godawful there were tons of issues in this game and we almost won anyway grow up take the l gracefully and support the best ravens team weve had in years or find a new fanbase this team is too good to have your fairweather bullshit stinking up the place
last year we were 52 as well we have a lot to improve on but better to lose games like this now rather than later
such an amazing game the afc north is so stacked one of the most talented young divisions burrow lamar assburger mayfeathers such good rivalry im so happy
covid can go ahead and end this season now lol
are the mods going to do anything about the insane amount of steeler fans in here theyre even getting upvoted
as a pittsburgher who hates the steelers im sorry you guys got boned by the refs at the end
entire team failure jackson threw 2 ints fumbles all over the place poor play calling defense gave up giant fucking chunk plays everywhere on penalties refs fucked us and time management was suspect
fucking last play was pi refs should have gave more time fucking lamar throwing picks

i hate the nfl sometimes
im not being salty when i say it but the steelers do not deserve to be 70 ravens were the better team out there ran all over their top defense but lamar handed those damn picks
i believe sports are fixed now before you downvote me look up tim donaghy major sports tell them what to call how can games be so lopsided when it comes to penalties i refuse to believe that one team is almost perfect and not committing penalties and the other is getting huge calls against them
hey guys it is what it is we still have a chance at the division and were still gonna make the playoffs love you all

x200b

edit whoever hit me with that downvote im going through a really tough time irl right now just be glad youre able to actually care about a single football game

why the fuck are there 4 receivers in the same spot on that last play
why the fuck didnt tony want to bring up the hit to the head on the last play of the game like that doesnt fucking matter after all the soft calls against us all day total horseshit
pittsburg was given that game
i bet heyward was fucking faking it bc he knew the refs were gonna screw us over with that he was injured earlier too
mark andrews shits the bed whenever a team over 500 is on the schedule
it takes one bad game from lamar for all the racists on this sub to pop out of the woodwork sad
this game was disgustingly riddled with ref ball blatantly favoring the steelers muiltiple times they had indeed committed delay of game yet no call

a corner barely touching a reciever on a ball that is not catchable at all pi

then at the end of the game you have 2 clearly blown reff ball calls that should have these refs at least looking at fines for ineptitude

1 7 extra seconds on the clock for the injury they are allowed to go back and review the tape for that so fthey can assertain the time

2 how in the heck is there not a personal foul on the final play the reciever is clearly defensless and you nail him in the head that should have been an extra play
the refs were dogshit but you dont win the game with 3 giveaways and 110 penalty yards just too sloppy
hoes were not stunted upon im disappointed
observations

lamar is indecisive he changes his base and only looks at the right side of the field when he looks left he lobs and underthrows hes making extremely poor decisions for a third year player we really need some ppl to step up other than snead

fuck empty sets they dont work when you have a line that cant pass protect worth shit

judon is garbage sack daddy and bowser took his role and set an edge better than him without the roughing penalties

refs were absolute trash on both sides this game shouldve been 2124 assuming the 14pt swing from lamars awful throws counted still

why throw underneath in cover 2 andrews was covered on that 2nd pick

again fuck empty sets 5 wide draw empty backfield on fourth and three are you fucking kidding me jk was averaging over 6 ypcgus over 5 they couldve gotten the fucking first

x200b

refs definitely had a hand in it but this was a complete meltdown by our offense regardless of the score so infuritiating

x200b

in short we need better playcalling greg roman has to fucking go you dont call these retarded plays with a te split outside the s against a cover 2 in the flat you throw deep or run a god damn crosser to push zones to one side of the field

i just do not understand this play calling and if there is even scheming going on we now have 25 seasons of a failure to adjust after the half really tired of it we need young people as ocs not these old turds who do stupid shit from the 2000s
steelers fan here i come in peace
just wanted to say how is your run game so good you absolutely gashed us the whole game yinz have something special with the running backs hopefully you guys can get everyone healthy for the thanksgiving rematch you have a great team down there
some of you are so fair weather it isnt even funny lamar was playing behind an eviscerated oline and basically didnt have one clean pocket the entire game it was a great game and im not upset that we lost this one
jackson isnt even close to deserving a franchise qb contract
haha that was fucking awful
horrendous play calling part 8 love to see it gro
what was harbaugh saying at the end
romo just confirmed they cant call out bad reffing

so whats the point of having them
greg roman needs to get his shit figured out or he has to go
they rushed every single play that second to last drive wasted huge amounts of clock and gave the steelers time to adjust genius
we had too many penalties during the game and that came to haunt us
please someone save this offense and get yanda on weight gain 4000
penalties continue to be a problem offense is still inconsistent but the defense looked improved since the philly game going forward we are going to have a huge problem with pass proctection but the run blocking looks like it will be fine
its sad that when were down under 2mins with no timeouts i already now the game is lost this team can not make comebacks
we couldnt have run the option again on the game deciding 4th down that they couldnt defend all game aight fam
this game is inexcusable we come off a bye week gift our biggest rival 14 points continue the lack of discipline for penalties from the eagles game and show why everyone has been calling for a more run heavy offense this is a loss that goes against lamar roman harbaugh and edc in that order lamar for continuing to make rookie mistakes roman for not playing this offense to its strengths and mitigating those lamar mistakes harbaugh for not having the team disciplined and edc for not bringing in or developing weapons for lamar harbaugh may get a slight pass for the refs since it was a shit show
what a fucking joke lamar played like shit the team showed no discipline and were playing with a backup offensive line
my main takeaway is that this loss is 100x worse given we were in it without two starting linemen
i honestly dont even find myself caring

like i just dont anymore

cant trust this team with shit
anyone else feel like they got a cardio workout after that game
i dont feel great about that win as a steelers fan a lot of tickytack calls that went in the steelers favor hopefully the next game we have better officiating
worst part is this was after our byeyou know the week we should look our bestand we looked timid
like fuck man if ur gonna call shitty calls then call if both ways at least fuck
pretty much the worst possible scenario major injuries tensions high poor lamar performance tight loss
lamar showed a lot of resilience in the midst of a below average game against a great opponent he may have made a lot of mistakes but he also kept getting us back in it it sucks but were still in a great spot overall lets get to thanksgiving
and now onto the whiskey
something that hurts is once the offense did get their shit together and take the lead the defense let them go the other way flaccoesque
lamar was brutal today he needs to be better cant diagnose qb play well enough to pinpoint what is going on outside of oline play and lack of gamechanging receiving options but man its disappointing to see him make such bad plays like todays two picks and the lack of awareness on the fumble
this is a challenge for lamar to mentally recover from an emotional loss midseason the bounceback or lack thereof will set the tone for the next halfdecade

better lose ugly here and learn from it than get blownout in the afc championship
i dont understand why gro keeps calling this shit pass plays when we know our oline is like swiss cheese with these injuries our receivers are barely getting separation and our quarterback keeps secondguessing himself jk and gus had an insane game today and the fact that they were invisible when we needed them shows yet again how fucking dogshit our playcalling is not gonna hop on the fire gro train right now but jesus christ man stick to what works for us instead of trying to prove lamars a passer fuck the noise and do what makes us win
okay i need stop posting in here but with the game on the line how do you go 5 wide with no one in the backfield we had been gashing them with the option play on that run why not at least make them potentially defend the run every single person knew it was a draw when they went 5 wide
my brother is a steelers fan i live in the uk i lost my mind today ama
if they lose next week its time to worry
how could you trust lamar with the game in his hands at this point
this offense is built around and for lamar jackson he needs to play better
just wanted to pop in here and say i appreciate the cordiality in the main gamethread obviously dicks on both sides but enjoyed it with yall

see you on thanksgiving
bad officiating and bad coaching poor execution too predictable this was a fubar
i gotta put my blame on those fucking penalties yes lamar was brutally bad today but i do think we could have won if our defense didnt screw up with over 100 yards penalties ridiculous

also am i the only one losing faith in andrews i feel like hes been majorly regressing too
can someone please explain how you cant fumble the ball forward except when you score a touchdown like the eagles did 2 weeks ago
stanley out for season
man i know he was just signed but it wouldve been the perfect time to send a big bodied dez bryant in for a sidelinecorner contested catchalbeit it wouldve meant promoting him from the practice squad and idk if we could afford to do that with all the line replacements we had

another very poor showing by the offense defense had difficulty in the 2nd half on the empty sets i will say the 4 man rush seemed a lot more effective with ngakoue than it was before
we beat ourselves today with turnovers despite the injuries we did good this loss will sharpen us for weeks to come they are the toughest team left on our schedule imo hold ya head up we were dominating and a few mistakes like 3 turnovers is a lot even for the best teams we know who we are and were on everyones radar we got this
every steelers fan is welcome to kiss the fattest part of my ass
cant even start to explain how much i hate that pos ben
statement from olb matthew judon ravens
terrible decisionmaking by lamar all game take away his two interceptions and fumble and its at least a 17point swing could have been up 200 at halftime defense played fine but tired of the pass interference on every deep ball

this is a game you have to win especially when they found a way to run the ball finally despite having zero offensive line

pittsburgh is most likely going to be 100 going into our thanksgiving game and theres a good chance that game could give them the division title


x200b

lamar has to look outside at least a little bit boykin was wide open
i am sad
the one take away i have from this game is i watched our defense generate pressure on a quarterback with a four man rush multiple times something we havent been able to do in forever

lets realign this offense to be a run first second third and maybe even fourth offense that doesnt turn the ball over and we can be tough to beat even with stanley going down we could clearly still run the ball against the second best run defense in the league not quite 2000 because this offense is better by miles no reason we cant win just need to protect that football
serious question that i ask as i sit here in my lamar jackson jersey but assuming were the 5th seed now if we dont win a playoff game do we extend lamar
activate bryant for thanksgiving
this one sucks fellas i tell my self every week not to be so invested that it makes you sad when a team loses but it happens every time we take an l but we gotta dust this one off and get back to work should be good by wednesday
both offenses were trash today i think in four weeks we will see a much better game offensively from both teams props to the d coordinators who outschemed the offenses

i think if the we limit our mistakes the next go around we will beat pittsburgh they are 70 for a reason though their offense will come to play next time and ours needs to step up to the challenge
obviously its not an exact metric cause shit happens but to have a fucking ravenssteelers game possibly the best knock downdrag out match up where 1 team has 3 penalties for 30 yards and the other team has 9 or 10 for 100 yards

somethings fucky

disclaimer i might be off on the exact penalty numbers i just remember the last graphics i saw had the steelers at 330 and the ravens at 110 penalty yards
today greg roman learned that running the ball the whole game can work stop getting cute and pound the ticking rock and i think lamar probably needs to go back to basics a bit fundamentals are falling apart
shout out to dobbins we got a real one out there
imagine if brown caught that last second pass though
i think we have to find ways to get lamar rolling out and throwing on the run need different types of play action and ways where he doesnt have to sit in the pocket and step up into it
hollywood looked open that last play
i dont know what to do to help lamar maybe hes tired or maybe its mental his throws looked very weak today both interceptions looked like ranging throws instead of honesttogoodness throws even on the incomplete pass in the corner of the end zone half the qbs in the league are turning into rb qbs and defenses are going to retool themselves to shut it down if lamar cant up his passing game we may never improve on what we did last year

we also need to work on basic errors that were making sure we had ghost penalties called against us but things like twelve men on the field illegal shifts not being set etc these are things harbaugh and co need to crack down on not sure what thats about but we really do need to work on it would be interesting to see how we compare to others on penalties
refs jobbed us but i aint that mad because we didnt play well at all lamar and roman need to get their acts together
whats wrong with lamar this season is he playing injured or something
a loss in week 8 isnt typically a big deal but when you look at the upcoming schedules were in quite a hole

heading into the rematch on thanksgiving night pittsburgh has dallas cincinnati and jacksonville which should put them at 100 we have indianapolis new england and tennessee so lets say we go 21 which puts us at 73 a loss in the rematch game would put us four games out of first place with five games to go so basically pittsburgh could clinch the division before december

had we won yesterday wed both be sitting at 61 and it would be a dogfight till the end crazy how one game not even halfway through the season has such a huge impact
day after opinions
disappointing loss we were definitely the better team but the undisciplined play and poor refing was the nail in the coffin
run game looked awesome after alualu went out for the steelers we switched up our typical power run style and started working in more zone run plays and the steelers just couldnt beat the rb reads that dobbins was making dobbins looked incredible today and i think its clear we are going to see him take that 1 rb spot with gus and ingram as the 1b and 2b going forward
offensive line was ok even after all the injuries piled up sucks we lost stanley and hope he recovers well and is good to go for the beginning of next season going forward we may run into some issues with depth on the o line so its worth keeping an eye on this group
lamar was just overall poor today and the turnovers were the topping on the shit cake he had today credit to the steelers defense because they got awesome pressure today and made some plays but the pick six was inexcusable i expect him to be better going forward and he can work to turn things around next week on the road against the colts
i cant tell if our wrs dont fit into our offense play style or if they just arent good at all the passing game just seems so uninspired and i think it hurts lamar because no one is really open on any play hes being forced to fit in passes on covered players
roman did a wonderful job using the run game on that two minute drill and i dont really know if any team in the nfl besides the titansand derrick henry can do a two minute drill of just straight up run plays problem comes down to key plays at the end of games where he gets a bit too cute lamar shouldnt have had a qb draw it should have been a gusdobbins run up the gut
defense as a whole did a pretty good job stopping their offense but they caught the short end of the stick with refing and also judon catching an ejection really unacceptable for judon to act that way and he hurt the team in a huge way overall no real complaints from this side of the ball

the offense just needs to be better all around it wont happen unless every person buys into it next week we play a very good colts team that we should be able to handle hopefully we can get back on track against a winning team i think the division is still in reach but i think we will probably end up as a wc team and to be honest i think this may benefit us
man hollywood was open on the final play
you could swear we are 25 lol by the pileon going on this morning
man we shoulda won and everybody who watched knows we fucking should of

the steelers werent good we just fucking shot ourselves in the foot
at least the ravens are still winning the games they are supposed to cant be mad that theyre losing to the big bros
soooo with the shear size of him dez makes that catch on the endzone at the buzzer right any news on activating him
shout out to lamar for gifting the steelers a net of 17 points at least unanimous mvp lmao
steelers fan here coming in peace i think the ravens performed really well today i see people shitting on the refs and jackson but from the seats on the other side i saw a couple tickytacky calls that went both ways and a ravens qb that nearly gave me a stroke he wasnt perfect but he was damn good and slipperier than a greased pig one td is overturned due to a flag but then he slings it right back to the same guy

this was a great game on both sides frankly had you won you would have easily earned it this was a game i was really nervous about may more so than any other in our lineup

fuck the bengals
refs lamar and greg roman
imagine running the football 4 times while losing by 4 with 2 minutes left
cant wait to hear the same old bullshit in the post game

this game was just complete and utter frustration stupid turnovers penalties refball i feel like if 12 things would have gone differently we could have come out on top honestly if not for lamars 2nd int this may have been a blowout we absolutely could have won this game but we wont be winning anything in the postseason if we dont get our shit together
can we just lose with dignity for christ sake we didnt execute on to next week
a true mvp performance
damnit dude this feels like a good ol fashion joe flacco loss
i said it last week and ill say it again lamar is the biggest problem right now its not that hes a bad player because he isnt the issue is that hes playing very average right now i would argue that in this game he was bad but in the season hes been average and needs to do better you cant give the ball away and you cant always look to run that 4th down play was awful should have thrown it up in the air over running into 6 defenders

lamar fucking sucks i dont care what anyone says

edit downvote all you want hes been horrible this season and this game was the icing
removed
edc trade for a wr anyone at this point and ol
loss is on lamar for me as well but can we all just stop being so fucking negative every single time he makes a bad play its like the majority of you want him to failand relish when he does play bad

maybe remember the bloke is playing behind a poor offensive line especially this game after stanleyphillips go down and has below average receivers dude did win mvp last year and maybe thats why everyone is so harsh on him because we all have high expectations just reckon we need to chill a little bit
lamar is over rated take away his run and hes not a good qb at all ravens cant beat a good team they just cant
please stop blaming the refs we should have run the ball more in the 2nd half and lamar crapped the bed today we were the better team and lost at home smh
we lost today too were joining you in mourning
i saw there was a comment on the judon ejection from head of officiating but was there anything mentioned about the injurynot adding time back situation yet

i kind of dont like lamar dude was smiling on the sideline after throwing the game i dont think we can go deep with that immaturity
removed
im starting to fear that people will compare lamar to baker mayfield i think the reason hes gotten a pass so far was because he won mvp last season

lamarwe need to hold the mvp accountable
lamar jackson 100
lamar single handedly kept the steelers in it the 1st half the interception at the start of the 3rd was killer
lamar
the guy who handed the steelers 14 easy fucking points of course its lamar hes played poorly all game this is the worst
sorry to say but lamar

with a assist from the refs
lamar jackson sprinkle some greg roman but i cant keep blaming greg if lamar is going to fucking suck like that
lamar jackson and its not even close he had the worst game of his career we rushed for hundreds of yards and yet his passing still lost us the game
lamar period

2 turnovers in the red zone one just out of it pick 6

we win this game going away without lamars coughing up the ball
if your answer is not lamar you are wrong
penalties 100 yards doesnt cut it
lamar jackson

directly responsible for 14 points for the steelers

and cost us at least 3 by the to in their redzone
lamars three turnovers were a difference of at least 17 points cant really be anyone else
if you dont blame jackson youre blind or a homer refs didnt help but at the same time the picks speak for themselves
lamar jackson awful throws poor running when he needed to make plays fumbles all around horrible play
lamar had 4 turnovers in this game both ints were rookie passes that an mvp shouldnt be making the first fumble was a horrible decision to hold on to the ball too long
its lamar greg roman made some great adjustments didnt give up on the run we dominated the top run defense lamar made a lot of mistakes that you cant put on anyone else it wasnt just the turnovers he consistently made the wrong decision on who to hand the ball to on option plays and missed receivers in bad ways took a lot of sacks didnt win 1 on 1s when it mattered the most like that 4th3 on the second to last drive

penalties didnt help some of the ref ball really pissed me off the judon ejection was weak imo the clock should have stopped for the injury but it didnt 27 getting hit with forward progress the second before running out of bounds all of that stuff is pretty hard to argue imo you dont even have to reach for the large number of exceedingly ticky tack stuff but i expect this crap in ravens steelers games had lots of chances to win despite all that
lamar
lamar jackson
lamar will always love him for 2019 and have a ton of special memories associated with him but this season has been concerning he has a long way to go
lamar cant make that many mistakes against a team like the steelers
lamar even if he cant make the throw he needs to hang on to the fucking ball
lamar jackson this loss entirely 100 on him
love the dude an unhealthy amount but lamar cost us the game off target most of the day and the turnovers absolutely killed us looked like we could go for the throat up 177 and he put them right back in the game then simply couldnt get it done at the end

i come away feeling like the better team despite the loss but now were 2 games behind and the majority of the blame is on 8 this week
it hurts to say but lamar jackson
lamar his 3 costly turnovers completely changed the game
lamar easily not even a question sub 50 completion percentage 3 count them 3 almost 4 turnovers and only 2 tds honorary mention to roman for his pants on head retarded home calling and pass plays so bland that jason garrett wouldnt clap at them
jackson
lamar jackson
im so disappointed in lamar jackson he gave the steelers 14 points inexcusable
lamar jackson even if we ignore the fact we couldve gotten 3 on two of those turnovers we still wouldve been in a much better position by literally punting the ball
lamar jackson x 100
this isnt remotely debatable lamar jackson handed pittsburgh 14 points
lamar
only one answer lamar jackson hes just not that guy this season bottom of the barrel passer so far awful decision after awful decision
lamar had a rough one
who can watch this game and actually pretend it was enjoyable lamar was shit oc kept flip flopping on what was working and the the refs completely fucked us repeatedly
lamar fucking jackson
lamar
lamar jackson

7 weeks in and he still looks astonishingly mediocre
lamar

lamar jackson
lamar
lamar
lamar jackson
this loss is 100 on lamar for the first 3 quarters he was the steelers best offenss
could go a few ways but id say lamar is the biggest reason we lost
im happy the majority of us can call lamar out when he plays like shit i remember when joe played like shit and a significant portion of the fan base excused it for years
refs they dont even try to hide it they defied the injury timeout rule at the end of the game too

dishonorable mention to lamar
lamar and coaches
lamar jackson

had 4 turnovers and 3 of them cost us 14 points because it went to pittsburgh and another 3 when we were in fg range
lamar he handed this game to the steelers
lamar jackson
its lamar his ball security looks like his rookie year dudes still shook from kc or something
lamar giving the team 14 points is just bad its one thing to turn the ball over its another to turn it when deep in your own territory
lamar jackson
osu fan here steelers too admittedly jk looked great and i hope he sees some more handle time that man can ball
clearly its lamar without those turnovers we have a 2 td lead going into half and then the turnover to start off the second half is officially what brought them back in seemed to play well under pressure late which is good as thats a part of his game that has been in question but it wasnt enough to negate everything he had done earlier
lamar all the way


look i like the guy but theres no excuse for his play today i hope this loss is the one that eats away at him the one that he takes so damn personal that his game starts to improve over the remaining games
lamar
lamar jackson
lamar
lamar inconsistent turnover prone and led this team to a loss that we easily could have won
lamar lost us this game wtf man wtf
lamar 4 turnovers jackson
lamar jackson him playing poorly against actual competition is becoming a trend
lamar jackson and to anyone who thinks otherwise then youre a stan
lamar too many turnovers and easy completions missed
lamar jackson hate to say it
lamar took at least 3 away and gave thrm 14
blame of the game

x200b

offensive line after stanley and phillips went out it just sucked fluker isnt cutting it at lt all the time


lamar he played like ass trying to do hero ball too much directly responsible for 14 enemy points

x200b

offensie coordinator at times in the game the offenisve playcalling was trash what is all this throw over the middle when they were clogging it up why never go deep to people like proche andor duvernay qb draw on 4th4 just why
lamar and its not even close
lamar
cant be anyone but lamar you cant turn the ball over three times in this matchup unacceptable
lamar
lamar blew this one badly
lamar gifted them 14 points inexcusable
lamar jackson what a putrid game
lamar jackson
lamar and penalties
ton of games were lamar gets hate but didnt deserve it this one definitely deserves cant turn the ball over that many times and still win
ive said for weeks that this offense has looked off and lamars mistakes wouldnt hold up against a solid team

well there we have it
lamar worst game hes had

close second is roman for his playcalling
easy lamar i love the fucker but it was his fault today too many turnovers refs too but we usually can battle through some of that bs
refs so many bullshit pi calls not to mention the last play of the game and not adding time back on the clock
greg roman deciding to run lamar on 4th down when the entire world knew that was coming
heres an interesting take

bonds

did some fan put on a jersey and helmet who the fuck is this guy
lamar first but roman and harbs deserve some blame

roman because he kept trying to set up the run with the pass leading to some awful ints that gave the steelers so many points

harbs because this is the second game in a row with 100 penalty yards and its far from the only game where penalties killed us

lamar as everyone is saying should get the main blame those ints were brutal and there were a few other nearints or just straight terrible throws that its a miracle werent picked but the playcalling hasnt been doing him any favors we are runfirst team all the success this season has come from running the ball why are we so committed to weird pass plays when its not needed especially on a bad weather day idk whats going on with lamar passing wise his wrs were all on today but hes gotta get it together with the turnovers

this team needs a gutcheck the season is far from over but the division crown is seemingly out of reach now there is no reason this team cant succeed on offense running the ball like last year they just keep getting in their own way at the worst times

blame lamar jackson

lamar jackson once again trying to do too much too often 4 and 3 rbs avg 65 ypc he tries to run and gets stuffed end of the game throws into triple coverage when he could use his legs scramble and buy some time for his receivers to get open this one is all on lamar

defense played exceptionally well but my god 90 yards in penalties i understand steelers rivalry is real but control your fucking tempers out there in a crucial game like this caught the l and lost stanley for the season couldnt be worse than this so only going up from here

blame lamar jackson
lamar i love you but you had a bad game its lamar
jackson

no matter what your opinion of the refs you cant perform at this level and get away with it we deserved to lose
penaltiesrefslack of discipline

i dont care if you break 450 yards if you give up over 100 in penalties you are asking for a l
id say lamar he just need to play better flat out but gro is a close second we need to start scheming our receivers open
lamar cant win big games lamar cant throw outside the numbers lamar cant win in must pass situations prove me wrong
referees

steelers offensive game plan was to throw deep and hope for pis humph and mp were disciplined did their jobs and were punished repeatedly outside of that the steelers offense couldnt get anything going aside from the short field tds

the skura phantom hold on lamars td extended a drive that shouldve been over

the refs flop on the judon altercation was fucking laughable he knew what he was doing

not gonna knock the hollywood call it was close and challenging it was a waste of a timeout that we desperately needed

and almost no penalties on the other side of the ball did they get flagged at all in the second half

i know its cliche to bitch about refs after a tough loss but the steelers probably dont score more than 14 if those horrendous phantom pis arent there was offensive playcalling bad yup was lamar great no way did the steelers ball out on defense sort of sometimes i guess but at the of the day the defense played so much better than the scoreboard says and the refs swung it with those godawful pi calls

heres hoping we never see this officiating crew again
lamar gifted the steelers points and the refs fucked us every chance they could
i hate to do this but lamar threw 2 picks that resulted in 14 points have to put it on lamar shout out to the refs for soft ass officiating and fucking us out of time at the end of the game
lamar definitely regressed this year hard to see why anyone can still be in denial some throws he makes simply makes you scratch you head he could have had at least 2 or 3 more picks today
if we cant trust lamar to throw when the game is on the line then whats the point of having him its obvious he hasnt improved at all and i dont want another big contract flacco situation they need to seriously evaluate if lamar is the future
refs steelers wrs get to commit opi constantly and they just call it on our dbs
refs were pretty crappy but lamar played pretty poorly
lamar choke in big games jackson
yall are on crack the refs def changed the game just as much as lamar probably more
lamar is making some fucking stupid ass rookie looking mistakes man every week i see him and he kind of plays with this weird lackadaisical attitude like very mellow and chill the problem is it bites him in the ass and he turns the ball over both picks were so fucking stupid same with last year when we played them its frustrating because we obviously cant replace him at quarterback but its like what do we do to fix it

roman had good playcalls for the most part u til we got into the redzone im not sure why we again abandoned the run there ugh whag a frustrating loss
lamar roman
lamar coaching we arent as good as we think we are we constantly beat ourselves
lamar and penalties thats it
me
is pains me to say lamar and dog shit officiating
penalties

greg roman like always abandons the run when its working and forces lamar to throw he is the biggest issue with every single one of our loses kick his ass to the curb we have so much skill and talent and he wastes it lamar is without fault but if we ran it way more than we did we would have won
greg fucking roman
i get super annoyed with harbaugh lately not gonna lie
refs
lamar did enough to lose the game

he also did enough to win it
lamar for turnovers

refs for stupid penalties and officiating

and greg for not running the ball
refs and lamar
obviously we needed to get that 4th and 3rd i would think that would ice the game for us but terrible calling a straight up lamar run bruh dobbins and gus were eating all game they could have easily got 3 yards roman needs to go tonight lamar having basically 4 tos is inexcusable
obviously lamar but harbaugh gets some blame for some terrible clock management on our second to last drive we made no attempt to run our third and fourth down plays before the 2 minute warning if we could have had that we would have had an extra minute on our final drive

1st down timeout
2nd down timeout
3rd down two minute warning
4th down the pint starts with the clock stopped and we get the ball back with almost two minutes left


and that injury timeout did he even fight for extra time
lamar threw some dogshit balls
skura couldnt block a blind paraplegic
the officials gave more free blowjobs today then kevin spacey
lamar mostly but these refs were complete dogshit

the pis ejecting judon hold on skura not calling defenseless receiver on snead not adding time

like that was replacement ref level of incompetence
lamar and roman
lamar


refs


flipping either one of them individually wouldve probably resulted in a win
definitely lamar but id love to see all 22 or something like that to understand what happened where hollywood only got 2 targets
refscoacheslamar
lamar with an honorable mention to the tax break of a referee that decided not to put time on the clock because he wanted to go home
lamar
lamar sadly
lamar was ass but wed be having the same conversation about ben if the game was reffed even half fairly
fair to say its lamar jackson and sprinkle in some greg roman hopefully we can chalk this up to lamar having a bad game and the momentum at the end carries over into next week id love him to make more throws like the one to snead at the end of the game that he caught we really need some better schemes for our receivers getting dez on the field will hopefully help on the plus side our rushing attack was amazing dobbins looks fantastic gus is still a bus and the rest of the team is coming along nicely just if our offense could have scored or not turned the ball over as much it would have energized our defense more those pi calls were bulls hit tho
lamar hate it
lamar jackson

refs
lamar
lamar and the ref ball

lamar is 1 but the ref ball seriously needs to be called out for its blatant favoritism today why was judon ejected he was clearly getting people off him and the ref was far too close to him you are supposed to as a ref step back when a team is handeling thier own not stirring the pot the refusal to add more time to the clock thats on the refs no penalty on a clear defenseless hit on a reciever while calling pi over normal stuff players do all the time that are standard no calls
referees
we live and die by lamar hes our guy and today we died more than we lived
lamarg3 we are now in 2013 rg3 territory last year was 2012 rg3 on steroids
lol lamar is my favorite player on pittsburgh
not related but i love patrick queen absolute stud he gives his heart and soul every single sunday look at this game all the critical run stops and whatnot he was there the ferocity and passion he plays with never gives up and that speed he hits with in my mind patrick queen is the epitome of a raven
this is the first game of the season where i felt like greg roman has worn out his welcome that 4th and 3 call was predictable and i called it in the game thread if i knew it obviously the steelers did too that was a terrible play call

lamar cost us the game too even though he pulled us back in itbut you cant overcome 2 turnovers that led to tds if that doesnt happen we win the game
lamar
lamar easy
lamar for sure hes got to get better protection in the pocket i believe that no quarterback is good wo an offensive line
greg roman
lamar jackson and its not even close if someone tries to put this on roman or anyone else theyre out of their mind
lamar was just not cutting it today our rbs were making plays it was just ass after our 2 olinemen got injured for the d those over agressive man covers often times bite us in the ass with those damn penalties lamar lost us this one though with those 2 ridiculous ints sigh
its lamar

even if its unfair to pin it totally on him its him
lamar those two interceptions cost us

also why go for a qb run on that last 4th and 3rd our running backs were averaging over 10 yards a carry on that last drive just a bad play call hand it off dont try to be a hero jackson
lamar jackson

bad decisions when they hurt us the most cant get down to the red zone only to give it away

but the whole fucking team played sloppier than a shit sandwich down a flume ride
gotta be lamar and his decision making or me cuz i posted my newborn to the sub at half then we lost
lamar
lamar
lamar

turn overs were costly but i have faith in him hes a good guy and i know he will put in extra work

dobbinsgus did great on the other hand
lamar jacksonbrad allens crew
greg roman gets my vote his scheme has run its course similar to the 49ers
lamar jackson
clearly on lamar i like lamar a lot and i hope he gets it together hes being hard headed and not playing his game keeps trying to prove something he doesnt have to prove that said its a lot more fun to watch the lamar run ravens than the flacco run ravens
refs roman and lamar
greg roman
refs can lick the shit from my asscheeks
referees for sure lamar was the best offensive player of the game
john harbaugh is soft brian billick would have this team 70
lamar jackson

nobody cares work harder and win an important game in 2020
i cant believe no one has said this yet but lamar jackson
lamar played like a fucking trash can watching justin herbert chuck it rn is deflating
every single person in here saying lamar yet we still win that game even with his horrible play if it isnt for the 100 yards of garbage one sided officiating and high school play calling
removed
matt judon
refs
honourable mention to matthew fucking judon
im honestly going with harbaugh
hear me out if we had kicked the field goal at 4th and 3 and everything else stayed the same after that we would have won we were in field goal range with 8 seconds to go at the end
we have a struggling offense a literal cheat code kicker and a very high level offense get the score within a field goal in a 4th 3 with that much time left it was bad decision making from him
greg roman
lamar is ass
refs
lamar jackson honorable mention
greg roman
greg roman then the refs
judon for hitting a ref and making them fuck us over for the rest of the game
refs
penalties

lamar didnt let his mistakes shake him which id say kept us in there
i see a lot of lamar in here and while he didnt play well the refs really ruined the game by making ridiculous calls
refs
refs most blatant collusion ive ever seen in a game
greg roman for abandoning the run then remembering we could run then choosing that ridiculous 4th and 3 call
lamar jackson deserves a mention but gregg roman with the most predictable 4th and 3 ive ever seen
lamar jackson is a hoe that struts on himself that is all
im going with turnovers penalties and losing two offensive lineman in the first quarter a few of the pis i thought were questionable a few more seconds in the clock at the end i didnt were deserved which would have given one more play

on a positive note i was happy to see the run game return with dobbins edwards and snead there was a pretty decent day for the wrs defense played great cant say anything bad there other than penalties

overall with the exception of dumb mistakes it was a very positive game a lot of good things happened today
unpopular opinion yea lamar was brutal but i think penalties in the second half did us in even more we just cannot give the steelers over 100 yards for free pathetic
refs
lamar with some assists by the refs and gro calling empty set on fourth and 3
lamar and the refs
refs
this sub ive never seen such a disgraceful display from our fans we lost by one score and probably should have been blown out yet the game thread was complete cancer

edit i miss when this sub wasnt a bunch of bandwagoners and fairweather fans this place has become so shameful rip rravens

harbaugh

that effing moron always goes for it in 4th down and blows the game with a fg you are down by 1 they got the ball back and were in fg range at the end he always does this in important games jack ass

hey man we dont do this to opponents subs show some respect
have fun with the ban
your broke your subreddits rule 10

they were awful all game but lamar cant play this terrible
nah bad decision by qb1
i thought it was tbh but its close
we get blatantly fucked by refs on a regular basis nothing new we gave the game away with too many mistakes and turnovers
can somebody smarter than me romo and nance apparently explain to me why didnt get more time on the clock at the end of the game
because these refs are jokes outstanding matchup and good game ruined by ref ball
refs were pissed about judon
im waiting on the nfl officiating twitter answer this question

maybe we should spam them
removed
bro show some respect
enjoy ban lol
smd hoe
chill out guy

removed

they dont call pi in those situations pretty much ever
bad take thats a hail mary basically and everyone is playing the ball
boykin was open
not pi lol triple coverage and minka went for it at same time as snead
bruh if you throw into triple coverage on the last play of the game and the guys bump into each other while their heads are turned for the ball you dont get to cheese a 1st and goal at the 1 out of it
wasnt pi but was helmet to helmet also was a dumb throw he was triple covered so someone was open
lamar shouldve waited for someone to get more open or scrambled around a bit that throw was just into too tight of a window there were like 4 people fighting for it
should we call the waaahmbulance
another game courtesy of referees wanting the spotlight
peters got away with plenty of shit
you simply cant turn the ball over as much as we did on offense today

i dont know what we need to do to get him to protect the ball more on offense but something needs to change
ingrams injury solved one problem for us today at least we arent rotating rbs as much
agreed first loss that can be 100 attributed to lamar however definitely not even considering jumping ship on him
i dont understand why lamar is making so many god awful decisions in regard to throwing the ball in the past three games hes had at least 5 or 6 interceptions dropped last year it felt like most of his picks were tip balls off of our receivers hands these throws are mind boggling given how he played last year
im not even angry i just dont understand how an mvp regresses so quickly manwrong reads terrible ball control what happened
honestly im not too discouraged by the loss lamar played bad for his standards and the turnovers killed us but losing two offensive lineman and judon and being in it until the very last play we shouldve had one more but i digress it sucks to lose to the steelers but i honestly dont think theyre the better team right now i think we beat ourselves
he just hasnt been very good this year turnovers today killed us you cant turn the ball over and gift them free points and expect to win
as much as i hate to say it this ones on him the fact that the interceptions were near our endzone makes it worse they decided the game
i think its a combination of scheme before talent a diminished surrounding cast and lamar getting inside his own head

first point is something pretty much everyone here has been harping on for weeks romans calling the offense based on his system not based on the talent we have looking at the adjustments we made and the runheavy diet we adapted to for most of the game i think we might finally be turning the corner on this one

second one is an offense in a transition of sorts ingram doesnt have the same juice he did last year and while dobbins is finally getting the opportunity to prove hes a lead back on top of gus excelling as rb2 its taken until now for us to move on from ingram and get this transition sorted out ol is in transition too between yanda retiring and skura working back from his acl basically the entire interior is a workinprogress with ronnie out for the year the exterior is one too tes are working on replacing hursts productionandrews was and still is the lead but a good 2 is an important piece at any position and basically all of our wrs except for snead are projects inprogress and the only reason snead isnt is because hes 28 and we know what he is at the nfl level at this point weve got a lot of growing pains right now but i think in 2021 when weve got yandas replacement more experienced and more developed ronnie and skura at full 100 and hopefully a wr or two emerging this offense will be far more dynamic

third is being blunt lamar playing hero ball hes not stupid he knows whats going on he knows hes got a patchwork line protecting him he knows hes got one maybe two guys who can make plays at wr and he knows andrews is getting smothered on every single play so just like at louisville where he had to make up for being one of only two cardinals with nfllevel talent playing against half of a firstround draft class at clemson or fsu hes putting it all on his shoulders but while you can get away with that in the acc if youre talented enough you cant get away with it in the nfl rushing a throw to the first clean purple jersey instead of spotting the linebacker sitting in coverage about to grab a pick six trying to float a ball into a nickelsized window between two defenders staying too long in the pocket instead of either bolting like he would last year or just chucking it out of bounds and living to see the next down whether thats a punt to let our defense do its magic a kick to let tucker do his magic or another shot on second or third down last year he was relaxed and taking the opportunities that came this year i think he feels a ton of pressure as the reigning mvp to be the best qb in the league be perfect on every throw and almost singlehandedly win a superbowl in year three thats not how it works though every game of football is a team effort even guys like rodgers mahomes and brady dont do it all themselves the quarterback is the most important piece but he still has to know hes only one of eleven guys and trust the other ten to do their job i think this is one hell grow out of hes 23 years old and i remember id do similar things when i was that age in any sort of team game where i felt like i was the guy who had to carry us to a win you overextend you abandon your assignment you try to make plays you cant you do things you shouldnt because you feel like its all on you to win the game and if you dont youll lose and let everyone down if i felt that in pickup games and rec leagues i dont doubt for a second lamar feels it in a pro league with millions on the line millions watching him playing in the most intense rivalry in football

moments like this are where we all get a painful reminder that lamars still a 23year old kid who hasnt even started 32 games hes still growing and learning and on the one hand that means that hes not even close to his ceiling but it also means there are going to be growing pains and mistakes you have to learn from especially with the other two problems going on
i love lamar jackson deep in my plums but he does not protect the football
jesus some fans we have he wasnt his best today but weve sat through far worse qb play and come on 10 fucking penalties the defense takes 0 of the blame for that shit game all round and still came to the last play on to the next one
seems almost taboo to blame lamar for anything on here
remember when we fired cam and joe got more control over play calling and had the single best stretch in his career

i feel like ocs sometimes dont properly feel the flow of the game and just stick to the plan no matter what i like romans run scheme but thats about it we need a better play caller imo
yes for everyone who has bitched about lamar all year this is what a bad performance actually looks like just the complete disregard for ball security was mind boggling
im so mad at him yes its probably irrational due to steelers week and a lack of sleep yes i know its only a game and i know hes our guy but come on lamar how do you regress so badly in terms of decision making and passing mechanics
i think 4th and 2 and not having a rb in the back field was a mistake bus and dobbins were hot on the drive i thought the ball should have went in one of their hands on 4th
we need to take the ball out of his hands more he threw a good amount of dimes but had a lot of dumb mistakes that hurt a lot we need to be more conservative and eat clock to let the defense get rest our offense isnt getting back to what it was last year but our defense has made another jump let the defense do the bulk of the work
hes trying to do too much this year a few times he could have dumped off to a checkdown or tucked and run but is looking for more his mechanics seem off whats up with all the side arming he lacks touch still on a lot of throws hell need to improve all these things to be the real deal

our line is not as good as last year and now also banged up so some of the lanes he had last year are not there hes still had a few dynamic run plays including one that was called back today but for the most part he has been more bottled up running

hell get it figured out hes a hard working guy
we completely lost that game we gave lamar gave them 14 points and completely changed the momentum lamar played bad but losing 2 ol men hurts i dont think pittsburgh is the better team we need to clean it up offensively and bounce back
hes one of the best in the league at protecting the ball he had a bad game yall have to chill
not just lj8 we are playing against ourselves with these penalties in key games this has been a factor since the titans playoff game
we ended the first half with a meticulous drive where we made several safe positive gains including an awesome run from dobbins we kick a field goal to get ourselves a solid lead and then we recieve in the 3rd quarter and just throw all that out the window

lamar made some serious mistakes but the playcalling was downright bizarre
thats not fair yes he made some mistakes but the o line is in trouble we lost 2 starters and he was get hurried a ton had we not lost two starters

probably would have been a win if we had judon stanley and t phillips
it was on lamar but lamars regression as a player this year is largely due to play calling terrible routes and failure to take that next step in this offense by pretty much anyone involved in the passing game boykin should be better hollywood should be better duvarney should be used more

i guarantee edc is not looking at the failures of this offense as a personnel or a lamar thing
no i admit lamar helped with that loss but that was a lot to do with the refs no doubt
aye dont forget about the refs 90 lamar 10incompetent refs who should get fired
hell of an athlete but just cant win big games
how about 100 on the whole offense lamar needs to take care of the ball but its not like anyone is ever open
a regress after an amazing year isnt unheard of it happens all the time the loss was mostly on him today but hopefully this just motivates him and the team to get better

super bowl champs never peak mid season
im heartbroken
no cap that qb draw on 4 an 3 was a horrible play call
yeah def on lamar with two picks but also on coach for calling that dumb qb draw
i stopped watching and at the end of the second and came back at the 4th i was shocked the refs not adding time after that steeler injury hurt but our ol needs work i live in steelereagle country so its gonna be rough for me tomorrow
i am in no way jumping ship though was a tough loss but we will improve and overcome i see some fans saying we should bench lamar or are no longer ravens fans sometimes you have a bad day as a team
theres a lot of factors lamar was major ass today sometimes he tries to do too much our o line was horrible losing stanley for the year hurts and losing yanda in the offseason was rough play calling was ass
teams will sell out to stop the run and pressure lamar no pass blocking and stopping the one makes us one dimensional because of lack of weapons
the only reason the game was competitive is lamar
i mean 9 penalties for 110 yards doesnt take any of the blame
jackson cant throw more than 5 yds at a time its a serious problem
we cant keep making excuses this is the nfl if you dont adjust youll lose
this one is on lamar but the play calling was terrible let lamar run more and open up the passing lanes
im going to slightly disagree and say this was 95 lamar and 5 roman when your qb isnt gaining any traction in the first half with passes and youre all of a sudden near 200 rushing yards in the first half you dont come out trying to pass the ball

both of your star rbs are averaging over 5 yards a run literally gaining a first down every two plays on average on the 4th and 4 in the red zone i have no idea why roman called a designed qb run lamar was playing terribly and you had a running game that was destroying the steelers why not trust the guys who are hot vs your qb who is having the worst game of his career

thats why i say 5 to roman lamar played terribly and should have made smarter plays but roman could have called that second half better and we could have walked away from that game 14 points over them
disagree i will say majority of it falls on his shoulders but conditions were bad and officiating was brutal not to mention the play calling in crunch time we also lost an all pro tackle against the best pass rush in the nfl i do think lamar needs to be better but he also needs help
steelers fan here lurking i think youre right you guys lost on turnovers the pick 6 alone was enough to crucify him
there were some bad penalties by our offense too
i agree he made too many bad decisions that gave up too many turn overs literally had he cut his turnovers in half wed have won
did you all not watch our o line just be swiss cheese he was forced out of the pocket on every pass attempt
i dont completely agree we have a discipline problem too 9 penalties for 110 yards and 5 1st downs terrible terrible terrible
i think the problem with last nights game was pretty much everything lamar didnt make good decisions which didnt help with a leaky o line injuries ejection play choices very little went right we put it behind us and move on
they need to coach his ass up some of the stuff you can live with like holding the ball and pumping it waiting for guys to get open but he is getting loose with the football and thats a killer
so i guess people gave up on flacco after 2 years
people finally see that lamars passing has regressed they were quick to blame the receivers for not getting open the reality is the ball continues to be thrown wildly and inconsistently by lamar that interception that joe haden couldnt pull in was thrown behind myles boykin lamar is so inaccurate
i honestly dont get this thread did everyone expect him to be mvp or best qb in the league every year hes had a very good year and they just lost by 4 pts with a 3 turnover margin against a top team

lamar is very good team will be fine lol gotta hang onto the ball
uhhdoes nobody not remember losing two ol in this game lamar got sacked whatsix times one of the fumbles he was hit by dupree as he threwthe other as he tried to reach for a first on 4th down

the interceptions werent great but lets not act like the o line did him any favors
id also say coaching has been poor theyre trying too hard to make this offense something that its not and that is really messing with lamar last years offense was simple and efficient its almost like greg roman is trying to prove something instead of trying to win games like we did last year empty backfield on 4th and goal with the game on the line why
i think lamar gets blame but the playcalling was also poor the second int didnt need to happen up by 10 and back near your own end zone with a productive run game and we force a pass 4th and short near the goal line pittsburgh was so ready for lamar to keep that ball and his running has not been as effective as it was last year
wheres the deep shots i feel like they are coaching away from his strengths
not 100 the turnovers did hurt us but he had a touchdown they called back for no real reason the loss was 5050 on lamar and the refs


x200b

he needs to look outside man boykin gets a lot of shit on this sub but damn hes an outside wr jump ball guy that never gets a chance to do what he does best
im not sure i would give him 100 the turnovers killed is and lamar certainly has some send reflection to do there remember the steelers are not 70 they are the highest ranked team in the afc and have arguably the best defense in the league personally i think the blame is shared with penalties and losing stanley and phillips
they need to set up shorter passes they left lamar in the pocket far too long and hes running for his life

you need to get that ball out quick
no the refs were real bad
lamar had a very bad game

judon shouldnt have gotten tossed out we would have eaten ben for lunch he was under constant pressure

why throw when youre running the ball so effectively against the 1 run defense

also lamar had a very bad game and just feels skittish no touch on throws unsure when to run maybe the election is getting to him

overall we do better as a wild card team see prev super bowl wins

super bowl guaranteed
sure he played like shit and we can blame today on him 100 but he also does not have enough weapons to win a sb with the first fumble in the rz is a direct result of guys not being able to get open
nearly every qb has a rough 2nd year and this is lamars second full year

he needs to work on some mechanics but im not worried when he gets in the zone hes electric hell fix his shit
youre going to get some hate for this but youre absolutely correct but have faith this game doesnt mean lamar cant still improve this season and bring us back up
eh greg roman gets 2030 of the blame here
so nothing to do with penalties trying to fight passing when we should be running nothing to do with how pitts adjusted their gameplay nothing to do with injuries

i get what your saying lj didnt light em up except that td that got pulled back

but to say its 100 on him is a bit silly
fuck the steelers
i think lamar sometimes has the mindset of trying to win the whole game on one single play and that can be a problem i love that energy of trying to make something out of nothing but i worry sometimes that he expects too much of himself and that can make any player worse certainly a problem that only a select few players are even talented enough to face but i think its a big problem for him relax play football and just be what you are instead of trying to be god on the field every play sometimes you just gotta throw the ball away and get em next time
game is on lamar he played like shit

but he did not let his mistakes define the day he responded after almost every mistake we should have blown the steelers out today

this will either be a wake up call or it wont lamar is not playing as well as he did last year but he can certainly get the job done hopefully next season we have a full offseason that will def help his rhythm

online and receiving threats that is the draft

our defense is going to continue to get better we will win games

123 as a starter at home he has only lost a few games in his rather historic career he is only 23 he will get better sky still in sky
they make a thread for blame of the game you know
i genuinely dont think lamar is our future quarterback after last season he has regressed so much i just cant see it
2 weeks to prepare while theyre playing the team that took us out the playoffs last year nd this is what we get
do people think bringing back flacco will help good gracious look at the mans record hes still a young qb people act like hes not a franchise player how we forgot what we were for 4 yrs before lamar give him time to grow
in alternative universe ravens are 70 with mahomes
it was really just bad reads its not like he made terrible throws or anything he just made very avoidable plays

those two 4th down stops i dont blame him at all he pretty much gave them 14 points and shaved off 7 points from us
nah not 100

defensive penalties helped steelers score their last td

im on board with lamar he had a shit game

also why open the second half passing when youve been running all over them

that pic jump started the squealers they were beaten until then
lamar was awful but im not worried about him as much as i am about greg roman the empty set king needs a reality check
this will get lost in the comments but the steelers defense is literally the best in the league the other team can make plays too
lets just ignore roman and the refs
no its the coaches its just like john madden football you can have all 100 rated players but if you have some dickhead who doesnt know what hes doing on the sticks calling stupid plays youre gonna throw interceptions your gonna lose

lamar was 100 why you were even in it
removed
neither has the oline and wr losing yanda has been huge with that said lamar needs to work on touch passes and ball placement its no secret that hes been significantly worse passing this year

also the scheme change from primarily 3 te to 2 te with ricard who sucks at everything but blocking doesnt help the deep shots arnt there the te up the seam isnt there today the play calling was a lot better but the ravens should consider adding a third tight end and get back to calling play schematically similar to last season
everyones been bad since week 1 except justin tucker and sam koch the defense was impressive today but damn the offense really ruined a dominant game
this is facts
cant do it
week 2
week 2
no point hes been bad and people need to stop acting like its everyone elses fault but his
i mean hes had flashes and moments where his old op self showed up so he hasnt lost it he just needs to be more consistent part of that is just having more consistency around him with the line and receiving core part of it is play calling and part of it is that lamar hasnt been able to make himself consistent

i have faith in him and i think hell figure it out but today was a big yikes
lamarg3 yall dont want to hear it but he and roman have been figured out this offense is ass
were 52
fuck
this one hurt also steeler nation aint gonna stfu about this until thanksgiving
time to to be more aggressive on the offensive approach we need a strategic offensive guru not old school roman we need to spend big on any fa wrs even like robby anderson or another 1st because literally our receivers not named hollywood never take over oh and hes not panning out either im tired of the fo disregarding the pass offense like its the 80s something has to fucking chang

editgrammatical errors im heated
alright whos job is it to make the petition to get the refs fired fucking bullshit
there is no accountability these refs can change a whole game and nothing happens to them look at this game 0 penalties for pittsburgh but many game changing penalties against the ravens complete bullshit dont want to watch football anymore
bad refs shittier lamar
of course

where were the 8 seconds from that injury timeout
romo confirmed it at the end i know what hes talking about but im not going to say it
ive never seen a worse officiated game
4 turnovers are why we lost
you not wrong but its irrelevant if lamar plays like a league average qb today
these refs have no accountability look at all the bad calls judon pass interferences and the bullshit injury its fixed tired of it
what about the call that lead to the ravens first td lamar a yard inbounds and flagged which shouldve been a 4th down
salty
removed
removed
lmao stay mad

helmet to helmet
helmet to helmet trying to get a 15 yard penalty to extend the game
i was wondering that too
imagine thinking those refs could actually do their job
a hit to the head
steelers db has his hands on the ball trying to catch it if its helmet to helmet whos it on can it only be on the defense

that was complete horseshit
why should they have added time when the ravens got setspiked the clock stopped

having the injured player behind the play did not slow down the ravens

he certainly was not the reason the ravens lost
an offensive player gets hurt inside 2 minutes and its a 10 second run off but a defensive player can do it even if it wasnt faking and nothing absolute bull call
if he was laying behind the line of scrimmage and the ball was snapped even in a spike situation it should be a pentalty they took away a time out from pittsburgh but never added time they should have added a few seconds if they were taking away a pitt time out
but the clock would go if he didnt get injured and if anything it gave them time
not a penalty because pitt gets charged a timeout the argument that the refs are going to make is they didnt notice the injured player until right before lamar snapped the ball and by rule they only have to put time back on the clock if they noticed the injured player earlier than they did with everyone sprinting away from the injury it makes sense it sucks but it was the right call
its a thomlin team of course he was
if im a mike vrabel type coach this is now in my repertoire to steal time at ends of games and increase chances of winning


utter bullshit by the refs all game
either ravens penalized 9110bad coaching bad refsnot why we lost
0018
no penalty because ball was not snapped

no added time because the timeout was applied when the play was stopped due to injury
those fucking refs were too lazy to go back and add more time to the clock when it was clear heyward was injured idiots
yeah lamar didnt play great today and a good chunk of the loss is on him but romans play calling is getting worse and worse and everyone blames the players for these loses but this game could have been so much different if we did t abandon the run

edit i cant wait for a couple of weeks from now when people start catching on that hes bad bring on the downvotes but until we drop roman were not making it to the end
last drive was looking good and then we go five wide on fourth and short
lamar was awful like awful its happened twice this season that hes been bad but gr has been calling plays all over the place for weeks doesnt stick to what works moves to what works too late and then just moves away from it cant handle tough situations either
we didnt abandon the run lol we had over 200 rushing yards 50 run attempts to 28 passing attempts you cant just keep running the ball on every play lol
he was really jekyll and hyde today bad then adjusted then unadjusted then readjusted
agreed
the amount of people who think lamar is playing fine is unbelievable 13 completions13 2 picks and 3 fumbles tell me how thats on roman they ran 48 time and threw 28 its the execution not the play calling the defense had the steelers demoralised until lamar handed them 14 pts
completely agreed
silver lining dez will start next week because even if he doesnt know playbook it appears our current receivers dont either

we thought flacco needed weapons jfc we have some festering turds out there

youre welcome refs
go back to rrelationshipadvice pussy

that judon ejection was ridiculous
hope stanley isnt too bad but dudes ankle is toast
jk future
whos the dude that has to let his mate take his girlfriend on a date he must be having a terrible afternoon

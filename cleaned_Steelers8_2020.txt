they say its lonely at the top of the mountain

thats just an excuse those who cant make it tell themselves so they feel good about sucking
how it should be we got a great team this year
not sure what i enjoy more steelers number one or patriots not in the top ten
we dont concern ourselves with power rankings and things of that nature we are focused on the rat birds its not what you are capable of its what youre willing to do
we do not care
lifelong steelers fan and i love to see them kicking ass but i can honestly give two shits about power rankings
the bucs are wayyyy too low in my opinion its steelersbucs top two either order
honestly surprised they put us 1
what an aboutface from last year

were on to baltimore
these are always bullshit and never make sense but ill give it a pass this week feels good lmao
we do not care mike tomlin
nice
im still not sure we earned it weve been kinda shit so far at not blowing a lead if we go in there and handily beat the shit out of those birds then i think well truly earn it

call me crazy but this may be just a tiny bit of overreaction
i really like sutton hope he doesnt go anywhere
did we need a third post on this in our last 8 that are up
hes a free agent next season we dont know the status of hilton and he just played a good game against the titans

i doubt anyone is looking to pick him up for the rest of the season in exchange for players or picks while also still having to pay him next year or he walks

now that im home and not distracted with radio traffic i think its pretty obvious what this pertains to

hilton is likely still injured and will be out against the ravens

stay tuned to see sutton back on the field and for what is likely gonna be our biggest game of the season peace sign or is that the v for victory

trade rumors feel ridiculous out of this we can use suttons talents right now and whoever would trade for him doesnt really get a whole lot in the long run unless they are making a run this season like we clearly are which again why get rid of a useful piece

for those thinking about a lb trade spillane is doing an excellent job thus far of filling bushs role and while not a 11 replacement the way he handled himself against the titans gives me faith hes gonna hang tough against the ravens
what are the odds they might try to trade him honestly id keep him and trade hilton sutton is better in coverage and can play outside it would be great to keep both but i think sutton has the brighter future
removed
some persons ass

thread
well cam posted some cryptic things on instagram last night im sure you are also aware of the way steeler fans see something and run with it basically they all put their detective hats on and figured out what can meant and also figured out the trade as well
why stop there i think we can flip him for aaron donald if we really try
did we need another post on this bogus rumor that cannot be made with our cap

x200b

i say no we did not need another post on this
lmao what


idk these three games after the ravens are going to be our biggest test yet
man if we can grab this w we have a pretty good chance of winning the next 3 before we face off again on thanksgiving
why aint bince up there
what would you rather

go undefeated all year until the super bowl and get carved up by tom brady now on the bucs

or

lose every game the rest of the year

i vote 2


goddamn thats beautiful
whats the actual size is it for sale
you should spray paint it
the emergence of claypool is likely hurting jujus chance to get an extension washington johnson are serviceable wr2 3s steelers have a history not resigning wrs we need to spend the money on resigning def players

juju is my favorite steeler player since polamalu and it would be heartbreaking for both fans and himself to play in another uniform but its seeming more and more likely that might be the situation i know its barely halfway through this season and that claypool needs more playing time on him to see if this is even a good decision but im betting colbert is already making plans already

it would be amazing if we can get him a superbowl if he does leave that would be incredible what do yall think will the steelers keep him
i think tj minkah and bud are all more important to sign than juju right now bud more for the chemistry and sheer motor more than anything
claypool doesnt affect juju beyond his number of touches the steelers always find a way to keep the people they really want they somehow managed to keep teams together under the salary cap since its inception in 1994 like all consistently good franchises they spend to the cap every year

if juju wants to be here which hes been pretty vocal about he will be
the desire is definitely there from both sides but its just really really tough cap wise

x200b

maybe he takes a heavily backloaded deal and we hope to figure things out after ben retires but i do not see it as likely give it 20 chance at best
i think its pretty low the steelers cap situation is pretty dire looking to next year assuming a flat cap which may be bestcase scenario a roethlisberger extension drops their 2021 cap hit down to about where the cap is now you then have to prioritize how you get your free agents av feiler conner juju hilton sutton dupree along with rfas and erfas who need pay bumps plus you have to think about who may get cut to clear space for any of these guys and a draft class

with washington claypool dj all under contract i just dont see how they bring him back even on a sweetheart deal there are other areas where they will need to spend money
i think juju takes a discount he has got a very marketable brand that is synergistic with his status as a steeler he might get big money from a low level team like washington or the jets but then he would have to leave that influenceradd revenue behind plus if he leaves and then doesnt produce with whatever substandard qb he lands with hes likely to be cut and end up being the next des bryant it might be more than we want to pay but definitely will be team friendly
i dont want to rule it out but unless ben retires id put it at less than 5050
my takeaways

the emergence of claypool has no bearing on juju

calling johnson a serviceable wr2 is disrespectful as all get out lol

i will not be purchasing a juju jersey this year thats for sure
id say less that 10 and that is only if he decides he doesnt want to take his market value or the cap goes way above 200m which is highly unlikley

with the amount of fa they have coming and the wr core they have juju is a loss they can afford


conner juju bud suttonhilton 1 of the 2 all gone after this year
very little chance

we are very deep at wide and will most likely draft another next year we are 17 mil over the cap currently and have lots of people that need extended or resigned that are more important than juju

if juju wants to take a big discount to stay maybe but even then someone will most likely pay him significantly more for name alone
depends heavily on contract demands by juju and bud

the cap situation for 2021 is not as bad as it looks mostly because the steelers have less money committed to the 2022 cap than any other team in the nfl lots of guys have deals that end in 2021 and many will be cut or extended and theres a lot of room to shift money into future years

that said it could very well be the case that bud is commanding 25m per year while juju is only asking around 1517m

im not sure how the team would feel about investing 80m per year on 4 defensive linemen tj and bud getting 25m per year would put the team at that total

if bud and juju both ask for around 20m per year it makes more sense with the other talent on the roster to keep bud
i think hell come in a lot lower than some people expect he knows hes not sniffing tier 1 wr money he just hasnt been as productive

then i do think theres an element of him taking a hometown discount theres something to be said for continuity and i think juju gets that

the other thing is that hes making a killing in the video game world so i think he doesnt feel as much of a need to squeeze every dollar out of this contract

that said hes a socal kid and i can see him chasing some better weather wouldnt be surprised to see him go to miami or something like that

regardless i see him coming in closer to a tyler boyd devante parker tyler lockett type of contract
7030 he stays the steelers cant afford to break the bank but hes also not a burnergame breaker and so dont really think other teams will blow the doors off in bidding either maybe a division foe will be willing to overpay to reap the benefits of delivering a blow to the steelers in addition to getting a very good but not great wr
i mean depends how much of a discount he is willing to take but if i have to choose between taggingextending bud or resigning juju no question bud
it depends on a lot if he wants wr1 money then no if we can get him in around 8 million or less a year it becomes more likely we got a two big contracts ending this year and i dont think will be back imo next year then a few possibilities and some good options for restructuring

player and cap space per spotrac this year

villanueva 84m

vance 65m

possible not coming back are

alualu 35 yrs next year 36m

hilton sutton emergence 32m

possible restuctures

tuitt 15m contract ends 2022

decastro 15m last year of contract 2021

pouncey 145m last year of contract 2021

vince williams 7m last year of contract 2021

in general this team is going to have massive changes in the next two years jjss could be kept at the right price and still have plenty when tj 2022 season and minkah 2023 season 100 need longterm deals in place
no one here can give you any type of realistic idea of what is going to happen alot of people think they are cap experts because they can go on overthecap and spotrac and analyze the numbers they see we have one of the best cap management guys in the entire league in omar kahn if hes a top priority for them to resign they will do whatever they can to keep him whether thats extensions cuts restructures trades whatever theyll do it he may turn whatever we offer him down but thats a different story i will never doubt this teams ability to resign guys after seeing them magically create enough cap space for the heyward extension they know what they are doing and who they want to keep with all that said i doubt hes a steeler next year
1015 just my gut
i doubt we bring him back i just dont see the utility of it we can draft another young guy and move on mapletron and dj are both as talented as juju rn

smart money is to spend elsewhere
this might get heat but i dont really care juju is still one the youngest players in the nfl he needs to be locked up a long term deal id much rather lock up juju then bud dupree
we dont know what the cap will be next year nor do we know what kind of cap wizardry colbert and khan will come up with to keep players they feel are integral to the teams success if the cap is 175m

for all we know the nfl might go capless like it did in 2010 because of the extenuating circumstances it wouldnt shock me if teams like the steelers start throwing their weight around because theyve got stars locked in at high salaries and a huge 1 year dip in the cap would totally screw up their carefully constructed teams then there is the cowboys who are over the projected cap and do not have a qb on the roster for 2021 and dak isnt resigning for peanuts my feeling is that if owners like the rooneys and jerruh want the cap raised it will be raised

so all of this is to say nobody can say for sure what is going to happen with juju he seems to want to stay in pittsburgh and i hope he does
well when ben is off the books and we have darnold on a friendly deal we can keep juju
you have major free agents this offseason in conner dupree juju villanueva and hilton i think out of that group the priorities will be hilton and juju

villanueva is as good as gone banner and okorafor will be the tackles next year highsmith is getting a lot of playing time to be ready to replace bud next year they wont spend big on conner given how runningbacks are valued in the league right now

as for juju he is the centerpiece of the offense moving forward in my mind keeping him claypool and johnson together as long as possible makes the offense deadly

hilton may have a replacement in sutton but i think with haden getting older they would like to keep hilton on the roster
i dont know i think juju is kinda important for us he is still the main threat getting the ds attention and giving our other wrs the room they need
juju looked way better when we had ab who got double teamed every time but now he is our 1 wr
i really hope we can afford to keep him
i think i trust the organization to make the right moves tj watt is a future hof hes a must sign if they can get a people to take cuts or restructure their contracts thatd be great lb and wr weve drafted nearly perfect on for 56 years im not worried ill always love juju and bud and hilton even if one or more have to walk
juju would have to take a team friendly deal but hes an unrestricted free agent next year a wr needy team will undoubtedly offer him more than we are even able to
juju the 2020 hines ward
though i love juju and hes one of my favorites in the league id say the chances are less than 25 that hes a steeler next year the same can be said for conner heck if our experience was a bit more pronounced id say trade either before next week for the right draft picks actually scratch that because this is our best chance at a ring and they should keep this team in tact the only way i see keeping either is if they take a discount but why would they players are lucky to get one big multiyear contract in their career and their value probably will never be higher than it is right now it sucks but i think both are as good as gone unless colbert can pull some wizardry
they draft wrs too well his role his pretty much been taken by johnson with the emergence of claypool they still have ebron another yeari believe him conner will be gone well be drafting ol rb wr this year
my logicalanalytical mind tells me to let juju walk plenty of talent at the position with other positions needing its starters resigned or replaced

though the steelers have been very willing to let wr talent to walk away they have latched onto guys and kept them around ie ab or hines ward for examples so the question is do they want juju to be that guy if no who will be

i give the odds for juju being brought back like 25
i think diontae is definitely more than a serviceable he is on the same level as juju as a wr
im expecting juju back at a 340 deal
well thanks for the compliment buddy i certainly dont pretend to be an expert just an armchair qbcoachgeneral manager like everyone else
i think he could be traded for value prior to him being resigned the steelers have always found value at wr id imagine they feel they can hit another home run in the draft so why spend the money

my dream would be to pickup jj for juju with a second round pick gives the texans a wr since they traded away deandre hopkins and something to draft since they are missing 1st and 2nd round picks

doubt this would happen and salary cap would be rough but that defense would be insane alualu would be gone but imagine that front line
juju is cool and all but all the energy i had towards resigning him has shifted towards finding a way to keep bud after how hes been playing this year
people saying claypool has no bearing are completely delusional touches and available cap dollars are both limited resources and a teams third most prolific receiver is not a place you allocate anything beyond the most minimal possible contract it doesnt matter at all that they play different roles on the offense all offensive skill positions beyond qb are highly replaceable

its not that claypool replaces juju its that a second talented startingcaliber receiver allows us the luxury of fielding an elite wr corps at virtually no cost and frees us to build a team with resources directed to the more important scarcer commodities that good teams build around specifically ol and defense

if the front office wanted to they could find a way to keep juju around

but a front office that did that would be an incompetent front office and ours isnt it doesnt matter if we can afford him we simply shouldnt
00 no need to pay him
removed
theres no way we can afford him
seems sus
hey the 6th post on this topic today that is going to get 

x200b

check our cap space and then realize this is beyond not possible
sounds like theyre fucking with us now
i cant verify whether he followed steelers players but he still very much follows the patriots because i just checked

is there anywhere in the burg to watch the game outdoors
any house with an extension cord

i cant see past lunch
like the rating on merit of record

usually like how brooke pryor covers the steelers but this write up is a bit wonky im trying to be nicewhat i want to say is a bit more negative

here we go
i like it more when we are underrated
we are number one

that texans game is one a steelers team almost always loses in my lifetime one of those early week 3 september games at 1pm against an inferior opponent

love that we are getting out to leads gonna need that this week ravens arent great playing from behind
against the giants lol

they were certainly still finding their footing by then
tldr defense pretty good
ravens
27th in yards per game
31st in passing yards per game
1st in rushing yards per game
8th in points per game
15th in qb rating
24th in comp
19th in sacks allowed 15

sacks allowed last week 3 vs eagles

steelers
1st in defensive yards per game
6th in passing yards allowed per game
2nd in rushing yards allowed per game
6th in points allowed per game
5th in qb rating
5th in interceptions
1st in comp allowed
1st in total sacks 26

this season
1 giants 3
2 broncos 7
3 texans 5 wrong
5 eagles 5 correct
6 browns 4 correct
7 titans 2 wrong

were 22 on the season so far as a subreddit

view poll
i dont care who were playing always 5
2 or 3 sacks
i think lamar will try to get greedy under the pressure of a division rival contesting them and make more happen than he can 5 sacks
3
56 is very achievable with a running qb i expect him to fumble on one of those sacks or panick pass into interception
ill be the cocky one 6 maybe 7 i think dupree is all over lamar this game
i think because of how often lamar tries to make things happen with his legs it will lead to more sacks
i think we see spillane hit lamar like hit he caught henry on the goal line

4 sacks
people forget we had his number last year without ben playing hoping they can build on thag
sack him twice but a lot of qb hits and pressure but thats pretty obvious
i watched a bit of the ravens opening day game and predicted to my buddies that lamar would get injured by the middle of the season by running too recklessly what week is it again
i cant take it can we just play this game friday i need it now

why do you think we would trade a promising rookie contract player for an expensive older player

hell yeah glad to see it
think hell be ready for the ravens game
fuck yeah
thats my eligible receiver
still done for the year sucks as he had been looking good this team is a super bowl contender and really has to avoid the injury bug
why was it so much fun when zach was reporting as eligible they still use that call but im not even sure who is reporting

noice i have that whole set one of the more handsome topps football sets imo
met jack lambert one time at the clear view mall absolute fucking cunt best day of my life
you dont have the classic james franco card
how come the helmets dont have the tri colored logo on the side i feel disoriented looking at the card on the right
good stuff im gonna have to bust out a few of mine
i had the 79 set but it has been lost since i moved im still holding out hope ill find it again 1 day

hope mike is okay the denver area has been seeing a spike in cases and even north of there we are feeling it and on the verge of another shut down

this shit is no joke people put on your damn mask it aint hard


i can confirm as a camsutton20 ig follower that his girlfriend kortneed used to be in a lot of his photos she has been completely erased from the profile and they no longer follow each other not sure when this happened or if this is a coincidence but offers a possible explanation for his cryptic ig stories with the peace hand signs
well thats not at all surprising

where is the dude last night saying he knows that sutton was traded for myles jack or deion jones so stupid
glad to hear it it would have been one of the most baffling trades if it were true
nor should they

tj watt

juju

cam sutton

that was a hell of a draft
didnt know it was in question
rudolph and gentry are the only players i could see us shopping that being said i dont think well be bringing anyone in
lol theres no reason to trade him hes not a cap space liability hes actually underpaid if anything
good dont fuck this defense up any more than what happens due to injuries
bob played great these last 2 weeks yada yada yada but this weekend we need to play sutton on 3rd down and play edmunds in the box this is specifically because we gotta neutralize jackson not saying were gonna shut him down cause we wont but bob spying jackson is not the game plan and he is definitely not going to run him down unless jackson trips and falls do not confuse next man up with replacing bush with bob on every opponent this weeks next man up is sutton with edmunds being the next man up taking bushs job against jackson running threat

were not trading sutton
what a roller coaster of nothing
side note kaboly has the worst headshot pics of anyone seriously he needs to fix that this one is worse than his last
if we trade cam sutton we will be trading one of the better corners in the league my hope is we extend him and make him our second corner within a couple years ive been high on him for a couple years now
whys he deleting all his steelers stuff from social media then
ha saw that all over twitter how did that noise start

across the entire nfl only the ravens dolphins and colts have allowed fewer points than the steelers by only 3 5 and 14 points
eagles putting up 29 is what really makes these numbers look worse than they could be that was a 14 or 17 point offense we played against

the good news is it seems the coaching staff is learning and adjusting more so this year than in the past
dont we have a w6 streak call me a purist
same for dvoa ravens and steelers nearly identical in both offensive and devensive dvoa
the raisins
i was in the checkout line last week and seen the new issue of sports illustrated featuring tj on the cover and a in depth article of his sackfumbles so obviously i bought itpretty good read btw just wish they included more of their talk with tj anyways couple days later we played the titans and he was so close to getting the ball out on his one sack on tannehill i know he was probably on the sideline thinking about that article and how he almost got one smh
so now almost guaranteeing he has more desire than ever to get that ff i am predicting he gets it against lamar with the magnitude of this game and the recent article and being so close last week he is gonna be hyperfocused also lamar tends to hold the ball with one hand by his side when he rolls out for a rush and if i remember correctly tj was the only player last season to force a fumble on lamar please let me know if im wrong on that either way i see us shutting down the run forcing lamar to throw the ball or make big plays on his feet collapse the pocket he finds his way outside the pocket to scramble and just when he is about clear to take off and has his eyes down field watt is gonna dive and punch that fucking ball out hopefully im right

extra credit prediction im gonna go out on a limb and say mike hilton will recover the fumble if i am correct on all of this you owe me a sweet tea because i dont drink soda take it to vegas folks
is mike even playing this week i havent heard anything since last week

obligatory its wednesday this is how the injury report looks every wednesday nobody freak out
tomlin said wormley was the only actual injury from the game


i think he also said that hilton and derek watt would be working their way back from the injury list id expect this list to shrink to a hilton limited watt limited and wormey dnp tomorrow
its wednesday my dudes
no spillane does this mean hes good to go after that hit on henry
has diontae been on there every single week
its wednesday my dudes
oh wow thats more than usual fingers crossed the majority are back by tomorrow
nice to have derek watt back
bumps and bruises
pack it up boysseasons over
man juju has missed practically every wednesday practice with that knee injury of course it hasnt taken him out completely from a game but its curious to see it every week
maybe its just my thought but perhaps that knee is keeping him from truly producing like he is capable of

whos worried most of them have us at 1
power rankings are meaningless
whos worried about power rankings i just want wins
seeding rankings
i have never looked at or have ever even cared about power rankings i couldnt care less where random experts rank any team the standings are what matter
who tf is this guy


i had that third one and i finally had to throw it awaythe snap back pegs all fell off and the brim was so dirtyit killed me
dm me your address i have one that wont fit my head and ill never wear
mine

your young self left the sticker on after you bought it because you wanted to be cool

hopefully we can bottle up jackson in the backfield rather than letting him run like an antelope down the field
the fact that two players on the same team are tied for this stat is beyond amazing
24 between them in 6 games what the actual fuck those are madden numbers lol
is it just me or has williams taken a huge step forward this year
ince
no more up votes its perfect where its at
incredible
ive only been a steelers fan for the past 6 years but this feels like the first time where this team is equally good on both sides of the ball defense might be a bit better

nonetheless im very excited for the rest of the season
against the nfc east congrats flocknation

thursday injury report
james washington
these 2 are always togetherlove it
i love ebron in the back completely unsure what the fuck to do lmao


wowwwww double the legal limit and basically walked stupid shit man
good thing he didnt have any weed on him or hed be in real trouble
it might just be me but the quality of the radio broadcast has really gone down hill half the time i dont even know whats going on might be time to get some fresh voices in there that are better at describing whats going on

crazy that its this order too youd think claypool wouldnt be last in the group having the fastest 40 time but prob bc it takes more than a second to get that big frame going
that was like the opposite order i wouldve guessed
washington never looks like he is going that fast maybe its the long legs
nice
this probably has much more to do with how much presssoft coverage they get than how fast they are
i think that means steelers run a lot of go routes against soft coverage what is not exactly ideal
thats gotta be coaching no might be one of the reasons the steelers are able to craft such good receivers

for real though lamar is a beast but we all know duck would have beat him if he was allowed in the pro bowl lol
i love seeing cam come in for the high five afterwards lol
but you can tell the confidence he has

just a reminder you get no points for confidence
i remember seeing this live and laughing out loud so loud that it woke my son up and i got yelled at because he had just went down for a nap
i am not a qb mechanics guy by any stretch but why is he standing so close to the wall give yourself a little room to step into them
its funny because two wrs did better than him in this drill
and this is why hollywood brown doesnt get me any points in fantasy


uh oh looks like we just traded vince for joe montana and a pack of crayola markers book it i have sources
removed
yes surprised we havent done it already you should be the gm

why would the packer a superbowl contenter trade their best cb
nope


did he return after the contact with henry i dont remember him coming back in the game and ive read that he did return and also that he didnt return id like to figure out what happened
he wasnt in the injury reports so hes good

people asked about this on game day and others were saying went back in then so it must have been nothing serious
he finished the game and tomlin clarified in his press conference on tuesday that he had only a minor shoulder injury he will play this week
you could have searched for this its been asked and answered numerous times
just want to say thank you for developing claypool we canadians dont have too many stars that have played in the nfl cool to see one do really good was annoyed you guys got him but happy to see him do well was bittersweet seeing him get 4 tds that one game that boy is balling out as much as it hurts to say but you are a wr factory he went to a great team to grow and develop cant wait for this sunday it should be a great game if the ravens lose ill be able able to somewhat console myself if claypool was a big factor best rivalry in football right now by a mile also whatever the outcome is should make the thanksgiving game that much better and intense
choke on your timbits ravens scum good luck sunday
may your players remain uninjured thats the best i can do
i can deal with a ravens fan canadians howeveryou make me sick s
take off eh
i liked canada until i read canadian ravens fans didnt know you guys had such poor taste up there
sorry for all the downvotes the ravens are our most respectfully hated division rival you seem like a good dude for that i also hope claypool pops off on sunday






nope cant do it

i was going to say good luck on sunday but even from the deepest part of my heart i just cant i hate the ravens but i admire you for coming in peace and saying how you care for us i actually have an uncle not really hes my moms cousins husband but the two were raised in the same house so kind of uncle whos a ravens fan so i always have a tough time with this but i thank you for coming in peace and not trash talking like most ravens fans
not sure if its a baltimore thing or a ravens thing but what the fuck does big truss mean
you canadians are so dang nice dagnabit good luck sunday hoping for a solid showing from both teams

brady is closing in on it too its more of a volume stat of playing qb for a long time than anything else ben just got a head start from some of the early bad lines he had
i mean he said he missed being sore so maybe this is a good thing for him
okay but hes no adrian peterson or frank gore playing this game for years at a much more physical position
got bored of no football so looked up the steelers past drafts what are your thoughts
this was also udfa mike hiltons rookie season
not to mention serviceable josh dobbs and brian allen who somehow has stuck around the league a bit and is with the 49rs

edit brian allen was actually released by the 49rs on october 27th rip
over 2016 artie burns jerald hawkins travis feeney woooooof

in all seriousness only rival draft year to 2017 in the 10s would be have to be 2010 pouncey sanders and brown and id def take 2017 over that you know having seen the evolution of mbc and all
man this made me look up other drafts and if bud didnt turn into what he did 2015 wouldve been a horrid one
yeah cobert is the most underrated gm maybe in sports history the guy has gone through multiple rebuilds built two sb winners with two different coaches and while several players carried over many were different and weve always been one of the best teams during his whole reign up there with ne gb and nyg these past 20 years

and just think so many poeple thought tj was a reach
crazy to think we only got tj watt a few seasons ago hes the best player on our defense this season
this latest draft might rival this one in a few years
who the fuck is james connor and why do so many steelers fans bring him up in this sub
we drafted sutton before conner til
we also got dobbs that year serviceable backup and imo could be valuable to us in the next few years whenever ben decides to hang em up
3 years 20 td and people still can get james conner name right
in the 2010s most likely

all time still 1974 no contest
the disrespect to colin hobra
and the cowboys passed on watt hell the packers could have used him too
not even close best draft in nfl history not only steelers was the 74 steelers

also a steelers fan in texas originally from california the black and gold army is strong 60 babyyy

texas steelers fans unite

this steelers fan in dallas fully approves
spookiest way possible

thats not ben in a restroom

tldr we now have 4 receivers and are confident sending claypool johnson and washington deep we now put juju on short routes which doesnt give him as many yards
we are 60 i am sure he would prefer being undefeated rather than lead the league in yards
its actually all a secret plot by the steelers to try and lower his market value a tiny bit to be able to afford an extension with juju
because we have a ball control offense juju gets the most attention and we have many other options that can win matchups as opposed to when it was really just juju and ab
because we have 4 good starting receivers a pro bowl caliber te and we heavily involve rbs in the pass game
ive said this every week but people saying juju is getting double teamed every play are literally just making things up and not watching film
its so weird watching brady and the pats now as i am defintely feeling good watching the pats get destroyed but it feels so uneventfull now lol and i also find myself rooting against brady even tho the hate is more towards the pats than brady

edit forgot that they signed ab so fuck the bucs
my illwill is still focused primarily on the pats im actually fine with brady doing well on the bucs as long as it doesnt impact the steelers

im enjoying the pats eating crow from not even offering tom a contract its like both sides said we dont need you to succeed and were finding out which one was correct
no i will always despise the pats ill cheer for the cowboys over the pats ill cheer for the raiders over the pats ill cheer for the ravens over the pats ill cheer for a team made up of alqaida isil vontaez burfict benedict arnold and jeffery dahmer over the pats

its bob kraft the owner hes slime hes a lying piece of shit everything about him deserves failure id hope for the first two year winless 032 streak for any team associated with bob kraft
i didnt really care about brady until they signed ab likefuck that ab shouldnt even be in the league with all the crazy shit he does but of course tom fucking brady gets to add ab to a receiver room with mike evans and chris godwin plus the bucs have a great defense so it immediately makes the bucs superbowl contenders if ab manages to not fly off the rails which i personally feel is inevitable but who knows fuck brady and fuck arians for welching when he said in march that ab was a diva and hed never sign him just goes to show brady runs that team right now
my hatred was always more towards belichick than brady
for me the reason i hated the patriots was because of the fans i know every fan base have their assholes but the majority of patriots fans were insufferable so its still fuck the patriots

never had a problem with brady except when he started bitching when things didnt go his way

but it fuck the bucs because they signed ab even though i have no issue with brady or bruce bruce was cool he just didnt believe in an offensive line
no i still hate both of them
brady being on the bucs gives me one other team to look for in the scores on sunday and hope for a loss
i hate brady and the patriots the same
i feel whatever my feelings are with no regard to what this sub wants me to think or feel i hate brady and the patriots i hate them even moreso now that brady is gone and everyone and their mother in new england is suddenly fans of two nfl teams
hate the patriots fuck brady and bellichunk pity for cam seems bleh since covid i still want cam to succeed in the nfl just not too much this year with the patriots but enough to get a good deal elsewhere and then do even better
depends on whether we beat them or not
por que no los dos
for me it was always about rings and lombardis i didnt want brady to get more than bradshaw but once he did it became solely that i didnt want the pats to get 7 lombardis before us i couldnt care less if brady would win another somewhere else
billichek was always the mastermind behind the cheating also the patriots are tanking for trevor and i always thought tanking was bad sportsmanship i certainly hate both but its really the whole patriots organisation ive hated the most
fuck both of them equally
i personally dislike them equally belichek and brady are both pos to me tweedle dee and tweedle dum just work at different companies now
hate both the pats and brady i also find it hilarious that people are saying brady was the sole reason for the dynasty because hes doing well on a completely overloaded team as opposed to bellichick having a worst season on a completely depleted team
in defense of the bucs i always kind of liked arians not to say the steelers were wrong to let him go but the steelers mostly had good offenses under both he and haley i think fichnter was a dropoff until this year and im wondering how much credit matt canada gets for that

also they have byron leftwich as their oc

i still hate dont like brady definitely participated in cheating but im more excited to see the pats lose than the bucs
i dislike pats more because i dislike their fans i dislike how everyone across the country claimed they have some uncle that lives in massachusetts and therefore they should be pats fans and i hate the aggressive circlejerk that the team can literally do no wrong when its now perfectly clear that without the goat they are a pretty terrible team i hope the bills and dolphins crush them for years to come

that said i like bill more than i like brady because i respect bills focus on football and the organization he can build brady is the goat for sure but hes also kinda a moron and im basing that on his tb12 pseudo science and his ab infatuation i think its really curious that he wanted ab so badly and i think it says a lot about how much he cares about team culture and what goes into building a team beyond just what he can do on offense i think thats a short sighted move that is gonna blow up in their faces and they did it for pretty much no reason

lastly i like bruce arians a lot so i cant hate the bucs more than the pats
hate the patriots forever hate brady forever hate gronk forever

just cant hate ab no matter how i try
both fuck those guys
why not hate both
fuck both at all times
the franchise was more complicit in their first major cheating scandal the star qb was more complicit in their second major cheating scandal fuck em both
thats easy i still hate the patriots and now hate the bucs
as long as kraft is the owner and they have an unwashed pile of laundry as a head coach the pats can go fuck themselves
i hate both but with less vengence like i hated the patriots soo much that i hated them more than the ravens i started watching when it was the bradybelicheck era and the ravens were always good but the pats were just better and now i hate both the pats and brady over the bengals but i hate the browns and ravens more
fuck tom brady he is overrated and i will never cheer for him at all the pats are now a neutral team to me cause i still respect billicheck but fuck tom brady
yes
i still hate both brady and the pats but belicheck has me so psychologically tormented that i almost feel like this season is going 100 according to plan for him and its all part of a much larger plan idk what that could even possibly be but i im worried lol
i hate the pats and all boston sports in general dont really care about brady either way really in fact since his success make the pats look worse im almost rooting for him to keep winning while his old team keeps losing
no itll take me at least a solid decade or two of them being complete bottomfeeders before i stop hating the pats
i hate the franchise the fans the owner even the damn stadium without a single second thought the pats are the most entitled spoiled rotten team in the nfl
no i wouldnt piss out the flames
everyone loves an underdog so the opposite of that applies when it comes to brady and belichick i respect bill hes a great coach and i enjoy his personality brady is dorky but hes a genuine hardworking guy he was a low draft and fought his way to the top the problem is that tom has been so successful for so long its satisfying to see him lose and now that hes doing great in tampa its even worse cause its like hey can you not be so fucking good good to see pats sucking ass
we absolutely do not hate the patriots and brady less now fuck brady gronk and ab fuck belichick and his sorry ass 24 record no mercy no forgiveness
i hate bellicheat and kraft as much as i hate brady
we are all learning it has always been brady
at some point you have to stand in awe at a 43 yo still playing like hes in his 20s theres nothing to stand in awe at with the patriots right now though so fuck em i think its hilarious that brady is playing at a ridiculously high level and the pats are a bunch of nobodies atm im not counting bb out yet but if he goes sub 500 this year thats going to hurt tomlin went 88 last year he had a much much better defense but our offense couldnt move the ball an inch bb should be doing better with what he has
we are learning it has always been brady
does anyone here actually hate the patriots nothing but respect for them they consistently dominated and won
the sub wouldnt be the same without fresh yinzer opinions voice your unpopular thoughts hot takes and bold predictions here about anything football related

hate an admired playercoach love a hated playercoach do you actually like roger goodell think jesse didnt catch it he did any opinion about the steelers the rest of the league or the game in general are accepted throw em all here

responding to someones comment to create civil discussion and changing opinions are encouraged dont be a damn jagoff and turn it into a toxic argument

do not downvote others because you dont like their opinion

downvotereport content that break the rules

this thread is intended to not shame others who have different ideas and thoughts that go against the grain of the metas in the sub



and as always dont be a damn jagoff
hows this for a bold prediction

steelers beat the ravens this week next week is dallas and much like gurleys td i dont think the steelers would lose if they tried the following week is a division game with the bengals who are good enough to not overlook that gets the team to 100

then there is a trip to jacksonville followed by the thursday night game against baltimore on thanksgiving i suspect the steelers will be looking at that ravens game on a short week and drop the game to the jags ending the perfect season in true steelers fashion
option 1 offense looks like shit in the first half giving away two fumbles one by conner one by ebron boswell misses a field goal we come back in the second half only to lose the game on a bullshit dpi call giving the ravens the ball in fg range where tucker kicks the game winner

option 2 steelers stop their running game forcing lamar to throw hes wildly off target leading to 2 ints one by edmunds we get the ball with the lead with 4 minutes on the clock dink and dunk for the win

i think this is another steelers game for us were gonna be up by 2 scores late in the 3rd give up a 72 yard run get burned on the signature runrunpasspunt and not get lucky this time and lose by 13 points
i predict 373 at least thats the dream i had last night
unpopular opinion ab is going to do very well in tampa and not selfdestruct if his head stays on right and he stays focused theres no telling how explosive that connect can be with brady if hes even 80 of what he was on the field at his peak its going to work out very well for tampa hes too generationally talented to have fallen off that much just because hes been out of the league for a little bit

if the steelers cant make it i dont mind rooting for bell its funny because a lot of fans dislike him a lot more than players around the league do i dont think hes a bad teammate at all hes a lot of fun to watch and i think he can still be an effective player for several more years i dont see him falling off a cliff anytime soon at all being a physical rb was never his styles so its not like his body is completely beat up hell run over you if he has to but he plays a more finesse style at his position of making you miss etc hes probably one of the smartest rbs ive seen play
bold prediction lamar repeats his 3 int performance vs the steelers just like last year but this time we win
cam gets his 2nd interception to reclaim his shared lead of int leader on the team
the absolute worst record the steelers should have at the end of the year is 142
heres a bold prediction for you bet the over dk is showing 465 right now

i think the bye week is going to be massive for the ravens as they attempt to reset on offense and look to scheme up shots against the steelers defense i think we could see the steelers defense do a good job for most of the game but they give up a couple of big plays i think the steelers offense is going to be able to do the same against the ravens blitz add in a defensive or st score not sure which direction and i see this being a higher scoring game than many expect i think both teams get 23 points
mason rudolph finishes the game on his knees
lamar has a career game bad or good is on the shoulders of our secondary
if we are destined to lose our perfect record not saying we are but i would rather the lose come last week than this one probably not unpopular
edmunds and minkah and sutton fill in for devin bushs role in the middle of the field while fans on twitter and reddit demand dc fired for not playing robert spillane
bold prediction steelers blow ravens out 3814 steelers d has 2 takeaways and one of those 2 will be returned for a td juju goes for over 150yds with one play being a 97 yard td dionte johnson goes for 2 tds again james connor rushes for a 50yd td
steelers win big
okay robert didnt do an int last game but i will say that he can get a sack this game against lamar jackson
ravens come out hot we claw back and then lose in heartbreaking fashion we come in the next week lacklustre and have to come back against the cowboys who are fighting for their playoff lives we take care of the bengals and jags and go into thanskgiving with a 91 record against the 82 ravens we win basically cementing the division
im usually pretty optimistic almost to a fault but im pretty sure well lose this one and respond week 12 ravens off a bye at home with aspirations of ending our unbeaten streak it just seems like a recipe for a loss purely from a bulletin board material perspective hoping im wrong but this is where my heads at
i dont see the ravens as that tough of a team they are one of the best teams we have to play all year no doubt but i wouldnt put them in the same tier as seattle az or kc lamar is not playing like an mvp contender these are not the baltimore ravens of 2019 the only scary part of this team is the rushing and the secondary weve shut down 3 top tier rushers this year already and ben never turns the ball over 2 weeks in a row this is the steelers game to lose
were gonna beat the ravens and still be 2 in the power rankings because bell is gonna rush for like 12 tds or some shit
for some reason and its a bad feeling i think this weeks game will be a loss 2724 ravens i do hope im wrong
i think the ravens plan will be blitz heavy as always play aggressive press coverage and try to take away the short pass game ben knows this and i think hell beat them a couple times with pump fakesdouble moves by the receivers especially on peters who is gonna try to jump the slants
bosgod from 53 yards for the win as time expires after a 7 engineered drive with 1 timeout in his pocket
jets fan here i was wondering if you guys would have any interest in darnold and what you would give up for him
107 steelers and it comes down to bens 2 minute drill
as much as i want to win this game i dont think we will beat the ravens twice and i want them to win when i go on thanksgiving
steelers d has more touchdowns than the ravens o
we go 151 with our one loss to the ravens on thanksgiving
i think bosgod is going to have to win it as time expires because it wouldnt be a classic without a last minute nailbiting score
think ray ray mccloud has a few splash plays with game ravens gonna plus press and aggressive and we unleash his speed to take advantage
unpopular opinion ab will be great in tampa and they will be in the hunt for the super bowl this year i rank them in the same category as kc and us now

hot take lamar jackson is nowhere near as talented as everyone gives him credit for he is a running back that happens to be in a qb position his real talent is the run but his passing is on par with some seriously deficient qbs that said i am not worried about the pass as much this game

bold prediction i think we get two turnovers from lamar interceptions one we convert for points and this makes the difference in the game we come out 2724 by a hair

also to everyone saying that ben had three interceptions last week and they are worried about him heres looking at you cowherd if i remember correctly two of those were crappy tips that just happened to bounce in to titan hands ben isnt making terrible throws like so many people are saying
my prediction is that tucker will kick a 50 yard field goal to give baltimore the win
3124 steelers win
cowherd might be right when he said bens our biggest weakness right now hes had a ton of boneheaded throws these past few weeks
the steelers are overrated
removed

i was there he pointed right at me ive been erect ever since
i see troy i upvote
the man was truly the most spectacular player ive ever seen play football the fact that he was so humble was always the icing purely one of the best all around humans in my estimations
joe flacco already turned around and jogging back as troy is probably like a quarter of a second after crossing the end zone makes this picture for me so defeated
heres the full game on youtube

my favorite steelers game of all time that crowd was loud
was there with my dad that was the single loudest moment ive ever heard at that stadium that game had so many great moments too

the block limas sweed laid on corey ivy i think after missing an easy grab was amazing too
number 43 takes us to sb43
we were not supposed to win that game at all iirc it was jus tthe troy show
this was the greatest sports moment ive witnessed live by a long shot
i hope so bad its pittsburgh and greenbay in the super bowl we want our revenge
this is that one time troy said no super bowl for you
first game i ever went to it was fucking freezing it was snowing in the upper section where i was sitting not enough to stick on the field wind was cranking had hand warmers on my balls felt like the stadium was going to collapse like one of those soccer videos it was so fucking loud in there
this is besides the point of the picture but cant believe players were allowed to go without knee and thigh pads as a player for me i felt so much more free without those pads in practice
i was there too other side of the field upper deck that was possibly the most electric i have felt the stadium the 2nd most electric might have been pitt vs cinch for the de facto big east championship if u werent there u cant pass judgment
i was there a kid wth my cousin a kid when he was still alive when my uncle still laughed would be special to win one again this year


they call it scranton the electric city

they call it that cause of the electricity
in case anyone is confused as to why this is here locast is a company that allows for streaming of public broadcast tv so if you happen to be out of town but have an address in these areas you can legally stream the steelers games if they are being broadcasted publicly in your home town

where did this speed go

im so glad we recovered his fumble last week it was such an awesome decision to give it right back to him on the next play and he turns a tackle for loss into a big gain with a sweeet spin move

i enjoy when james conner succeeds
amazing what having an actual quarterback can do for the run game instead of constantly trying to run the ball up through a stacked box that wont have any holes
hes had some rushing tds vultured too
conner has been fantastic this year i literally cannot say one bad thing about him and have ate my words that we should have signed an fa back
feels like hes finally healthy having ben back is opening up the ground game much more love to see conner succeed dudes been moving way smoother this season
the thing i like is that hes not seeking contact like hes a human missile like he used to theres no point banging yourself up if you can get up field and avoid big hits
thats because there are so many connor haters around and none of those sons of bitches have much to say since connor has shut them up pretty good

youll see them come out if he has a bad game or bad play however
shhhhh if it gets out we gotta pay him
if you take out the new jersey game he is averaging 884 rushing yardsgame 49 yardscarry and 208 receiving yardsgame 1092 total

assuming he plays games 2 16 at his games 2 6 averages he is on track for 1652 yards and 12 touchdowns
you can tell jc30 is playing some angry football this year i love to see him do well and hope he can continue to stay healthy
i would love for him to have a 1000 yard year


hes got a great comeback story but the injuries have been frustrating at the end of the day somebody has to produce


hes been producing ok this year so far really happy for him
were afraid that if we start crowing about jc30 he will get hurt we are all whistling past the graveyard
hey did you know james conner had cancer when he was in college

every color commentator on every network

thats definitely a pats fan thing
i feel like theres not nearly enough dallas on this map although maybe everyone just feels bad for them at this point
right or wrong i feel like the only ammo people think have against us is they think we give off the holier than thou vibe nobody realistically believes we play dirty cheat or other negative traits so thats all they have
i lived in connecticut for about a year and actually knew of 2 decently large steelers fan clubs i was a part of one for a season the patriots and giants dominated the fandom numbers but i was shocked at the amount of steelers fans a lot of people in the clubs werent even from pa most of them were older and became fans of the steelers in the 70s they thought of me as borderline royalty because i was from pittsburgh and had been to a handful of games
haters gonna hate
ct has a lot of new york fans as well which is why its not the jets
they hate us cuz they anus
connecticut resident here and i bleed black and gold were not all idiots who follow shit teams over here
i mean the only areas that dont like us are maryland and ohio rightfully so because of our division indiana kentucky tennessee colts and titans fans and connecticut for some weird reason idk how this make us the most hated nfl team more like successful against those franchises list colts for that win in 05 and tennessee because of the old afcc and because of what we just did to them on sunday
i love how missouri is still pissed at the rams for leaving
i live in ct and its a pats knob slobbing fest all over this state its awful

hell yeah love repping the steel city from the sunshine state
how long do pumpkins last in the florida heathumidity nice design btw it came out great

id never shame my dog by putting the word baltimore on hisher shirt
ive been wearing that shirt all week
that is one smart pup
do some people in this sub work in a church or something
good boy
where does one acquire such an item

not really lamar has only been in the league 2 years 1 full season and 2 partial seasons

nice to see sean davis back on the team he is a good guy and a solid player so funny how far we have come on defense few years ago he was our starting fs now he is just depth

this team is so much more likeable compared to the abbell days
if juju would throw a few more huge blocks id compare him to hines love the attitude he can do whatever on tiktok he shows up every day
anyone else get chills when juju was yelling we the best because same
that hehe i told you didnt i
completely forgot sean davis was back on the team lol
come on baltimore
cmon baltimore
here we go steelers

i love mcafee his show is literally the only one i care to listen to anymore its not just hot takes and stupid shit that and moats and deke
fuck pat mcafee he got pete dunne to attack poor kyle oreilly last night

jk love that dude
if pat gave up this just to punt for the steelers he would be the dumbest man alive
theyre talking about the steelersravens rivalry among other things
love pat but can only take him in about 30 minute segments
dan patrick was speculating that the texans should trade jj watt one of the teams he mentioned was the steelers this was all speculation and sports talk but could the steelers benefit from having jj on that d if so what type of draft capital are we willing to give up
doesnt make sense given the cap and the fact that every member of the line is playing at a higher level of ball than he is even if we could pay him it doesnt make sense for someone who would only be a rotation player
steelers need to focus on singing tj first i dont know how bringing in a 17 million dollar contract to an aging player helps that id love to see jj in a steelers uniform if he hits free agency free next year though
realistically it wouldnt cost much at all to acquire him but we would need to work some real magic with restructuring contracts
who would you play him over tuitt or heyward gonna have him play or split with tj or dupree maybe try to convert him into bushs spot

only 1 of those 5 is even a weakness and its a stretch to trade to hopefully convert him position wise

id still love all 3 watts because why the fuck not but it just doesnt make sense at this time
we have players that are better than him already in that position
if we have all three

and i use my combine card

would we get godzilla with lightning breath

total and complete wattage
never going to happen

steelers dont have the rest of his 15m 2020 salary or the 17m hes owed next year
i heard on the athletic football podcast great listen and they speculated probably a 2nd yes it would benefit the defense tremendously jjs been having a good season the only issue is the salary cap
no
id give up a conditional 5th6th round pick for him depending on the cap situation
no
it makes no sense other than it would be the beginning of some glorious terawatt memes
everyone has been taking it as a given that ug iii will be substituted for him on passing downs

is there any film breakdown of him in coverage is he actually a liability or are people only assuming that because hes a thumper
i think it is because of his speed i read from someone here he runs something like a 47 40 which wont cut it in most coverage situations he will just be a mismatch bush and others are much speedier and can keep up with the players they generally cover
if he had to play in obvious passing downs expect him to be a mismatch like jon bostic and vince williams were in 2018 his above the neck skills may hide some of it in the end of the day he will get beat

basically i think spillane is a buck ilb if they keep him next year he is a free agent we may see him become vince williams eventual replacement vince plays buck
hes not bad ug3 has the potential to be elite due to his crazy speed however if you listened to what tomlin said he took spillane out of dime mainly to give him a breather he didnt want to increase his reps suddenly to max and tire him out he wanted him to focus on being top notch wo worrying about fatigue
when i saw the all22 film for titans the times where the titans had wide open plays on play action was because spillane would bite so hard on it and it would leave the middle of the field wide open
the only things that ive seen focus on him just dropping into zones and then readingkeying on guys coming out of the backfield which he seems pretty good at though batch mentioned that him biting on the playfake took him out of the aj brown catch and run not much in terms of breakdowns in terms of him actually in coverage

hes not athletic so that probably has people inferring that hes not a great coverage guy myself included to be honest and thats also an area that ugiii had in spades in college athleticism and coverage ability theres also a tiny sample size here the man has played 82 snaps of nfl defense in his career
his handtimed 40 time was slower than kevin dotsons handtimed 40

every season theres one on mnf and i dont know why
its what the people want
because its always entertaining

in years the bengals are trash we put on an offensive clinic which people love watching
in years they suck a little less we still whoop their asses up and down the field which people love watching
because andy dalton cant


ah crap nevermind
steelers are a big draw mnf plays 2nd fiddle to snf and the regular sunday games the nfl has to throw them a cookie they get the steelers but not against a top tier opponent that goes on sundays
its quality entertainment
5 times in the last 20 years actually thats 5 times in last 10 years
the national likes watching the bungles bungle
ohio is a huge football market in general
everyone like to see a good beat down
does mnf get good ratings i almost never watch unless the steelers are playing
its a very close rivalry
any good steelers podcast that you guys recommendi use to listen to steel city underground but that one started to go downhill stopped listening to that one a few years ago
not a podcast but moats and deke is a good weekly show actually talk to deke on instagram a bit and he is a really cool dude
the drive on snr
thanks everyone
btsc steelers radio arthur moats
behind the steel curtain very good production
the terrible podcast they give amazing breakdowns of the games schematically they interview a media member every week depending on the matchup it gives you a good idea of the competition they have 3 pods a week all are at least 15 hrs so if you need to listen to stuff it deffinetly fills the time
i listen to locked on steelers podcast every morning thursdays are crossover thursdays where they do a joined show with the opposing team i use spotify
it isnt a podcast but a super underrated channel for steelers is simfballcritic

mike tomlin is only 5 years older than tom brady im so happy hes got a long way to go in pittsburgh
and the crybabys on the ravenssub still complain about tomlins mistake in 2013
x200b

the big surprise here is gilbert hed be a big loss if he cant go sunday
yeah ug3 being down would be a huge loss spillane is a bull and was a good matchup vs henry but we desperately need someone with speed and change of direction vs lamar
yep if gilbert cant play that will be a big hole in our defense
hopefully hilton keeps moving in the right direction and we get him back for sunday we can use his speed and pressure to help contain jackson
derek watt went from full yesterday back to limited

is this dude ever gonna be healthy
anyone hear news on hows spillane is he looked shaken up last game he came back but i would of thought he would of had some diagnosis by the looks of things hes doing great just wanted to know if i missed something
im optimistic that hell be out there iirc we had johnson listed w a back issue last friday and he still suited up and did extremely well

we have tyson alualu up the middle and hes one of the best in the game right now why would we need washed up dontari poe
we dont have to consider anything
no
we have the best front three in the game right now why the hell would we change something thats clearly working well for us depth sure but not a starter id rather see us look into ilb incase spillane regresses
he was absolutely horrible in dallas this year
what a fucking idiot
lmao
quote the raven nevermore
i mean if we get him for mad cheap he could be alualus backup instead of mondeaux
for the people saying no this must consider is in regards to wormley being hurt in that case yes i want just about anyone before fucking henry mondeaux possibly sees snaps there again its a backup to replace the lower snap count backup to alualu lets not get angry over that

as title says what are chances of getting face value tickets tomorrow when they go live for the thanksgiving game i originally had second fc3 row 1 but covid happened and now im trying to secure tickets again i will be coming to heinz field for the first time from california
face value for the thanksgiving game i think thatd be tough to get for face value on non covid years for the majority of seats

also they are already up on ticketmaster right now

x200b

cheapest was just under 500
sorry to hear that man but chances are 0 i had planned on going to the eagles game this year with my eagles friends i waited 8 years for that game it sucks but such is life during covid

you had me at steelers fan
i am glad you like your backsplash

converted from which team just curious
i just bought that too love it
thats a nice stove
and hes rocking a cool steelers hoodie
i mean shit that is just a really nice kitchen also as i always say we have room for everyone welcome aboard to your bud

personally i love it and think its hilarious bet ben would laugh if he saw it

we going to bring it to them this sunday best believe that
20 baltimorians live under that sign currently in a tent city doing heroin
let them get their jab in well have plenty of material to make a response when they come to pittsburgh in four weeks
need some graff guys to throw up a stop that tickles text balloon
at least it covered up the previous billboard which had a picture of ray lewis and the caption its okay to be a murderer as long as you rat out your friends to get a plea deal and stay in the nfl
living in baltimore rent free still too much
living rent free doesnt really apply here its steelersravens week
cant wait to see how fast they take it down after sunday haha
oh fuck these fuckers
no fucking class
removed


i dunno playing baltimore again after a short week will be tough we really got fucked by not having that bye last week
i cant see past lunch
who cares at this point just get to the playoffs healthy this team can beat anyone anywhere especially w minimal fan influence
i would guarantee we drop one to either the jags or cowboys


this is the way
will be a lot more confident about this if we win this week
it could be but the football gods will spite and curse us if we keep posting about it same rules as when you wish injuries onto other teams players your own get hurt
jags is a trap game ravens on thanksgiving is huge bills are going to be tough other than that should all be dubs
so is this sub going to lose its shit and start screaming for tomlins head after the first loss it seems like it might with all these people expecting an undefeated season
the bengals are way better than what their record indicates or at least the offense
the steelers could potentially go 160 if they beat baltimore on sunday but i dont want them to because i have a feeling if they do they will lose in the divisional round or conference championship

i fucking love troy
i look forward to the new constantly played vid of tj doing something spectacular this sunday
that juju fumble infuriated me once again
as a ravens fan this rivalry has provided me with some of the best memories of football these games are what makes me a fan i shudder to say this but ive met some steelers fans at ravens home games who were great your base knows football and yinz can drink some beers with the best of them

i mean i still hate you all but heres to a great game on sunday


i dont know about you but i was excited when we signed him solely for the reason that we were getting another polynesian guy on defense made me nostalgic

turned out we got a really quality player out of it
crazy to me that a player would ever not want to be a steeler
this is what a great orgcoach can do for you
and signing him was a very good decision by the steelers certainly an upgrade on mathews and cam thomas
who would have thought the defense would improve when hargrave got his big deal

plus well get a good comp pick out of it
not being on the jaguars would be a good decision for anyones career
according to the article we got him for a song too two years for 6

i met this dude his first year at the steelers great guy
he was all over german social media because he wore a german national team jersey for his signing
haden basically said the same thing imagine going from the jags or browns to the got damn steelers
i remember being little when he was on the jaguars he was legitimately my favorite player because i thought his name was cool its good seeing him do well with yall rather than waste his time on my dumpster fire of a team
hes a great story came over in free agency worked and learned in a backup role before eventually making the most of his starting opportunity

during the browns game they mentioned they will have steelersravens and steelerscowboys
bullshit not a national game of the week
colorado fan here anyone know why this wasnt flexed to sunday or monday night
hello friends
cool better then ian eagle

hey ravens fans dont know how to use the internet so thats not fair haha
they had same stats for me yesterday i think its rigged if you were ravens fan would say they would win
im not expecting a win on this one easily will be the toughest game of the entire year
this makes me uncomfortable

lifelong steelers fan here when exactly should i expect to be called a bandwagon fan im thinking itll start after we beat baltimore
life long fan here from texas i totally agree
idk been called a bandwagon fan my whole life its not my fault that my team is good every year
man i got called bandwagon by a new coworker at 30 lol
because hes about 30 years older he claims hes been a fan longer than i have well duh

it took showing him pics of me in middle and high school back in the late 2000s of wearing steeler gear to convince him

but you rarely get people calling anyone a bandwagoner here in atlanta its accepted that transplants and fans of other teams live here especially with the sorry local team not growing on most people lol
lucky enough i have us tattooed on my leg and a pic of it on social media the day i got it in 2016
screw anyone trying to gatekeep we welcome all fans as long as your love for dem stillers is genuine
i got called a bandwagon fan the other day by a 35yo ravens fan born and raised in upstate ny who started to support them 7 years agoright after their super bowl win the fact that i was draped in a terrible towel while in the nursery at greensburg hospital didnt change the fact that as an adult i moved to virginia and am now a bandwagon fan
im a lifelong fan as well even though ive never lived in pa my grandfather grew up near pittsburg so i became a fan because he was im old enough to remember watching the original steel curtain play as a kid im surprised by how many steelers fans there are in the central valley ca so i dont really expect to be called a bandwagon fan but i wouldnt be surprised

edit i guess i could pull out my hines ward jersey that i never wear because theyve lost every game that ive worn it for not normally superstitious but not going to risk it
ive never had somebody accuse me of being a bandwagon fanmaybe because in indiana at least in my experience it seems to be more common to be a fan of an out of state team even though we have our own i almost wish they would because ive definitely got plenty of evidence to counter anybody that tries
as a jersey collector i made the mistake at work of wearing just random jerseys on casual fridays because why not then toward the seasons start i started shifting to steelers mostly drew some questions
whos calling you a bandwagon fan
if youre not from pittsburgh you are a bandwagon fan unless youre one of the three or so living people who were from abroad and supported us before 1970

you want credit for being anything else wait till were eventually bad for any kind of prolonged stretch right now youre just riding fifty year long coattails

rip george

a scene from dawn of the dead was filmed at the monroeville airport more like just an airstrip than an airport that was almost literally behind my boyhood home in garden city we used to play there as kids but never ran into a zombie

this is what bad teams look like your undefeated team is not this

wow thanks
i didnt think the panthers were good but i thought they were better than than this lmao
for all the people shitting on dale here you obviously dont spend much time on this sub during gameday or on fb after a loss and for that i envy you lmao
wow what a hot take they also played in high wind and ridiculous rain
dk on pittsburgh sports with that hard hitting coverage cant wait for these insights on sunday

x200b

i hope pitt volleyball fans are watching the dolphinsrams today this my friends is what football teams look like your team is not this
thought the same thing either of these teams would have even smelled the end zone against us
we know they arent bad but we have much higher expectations steelers writers only concern is kissing the teams ass so they get coverage

steven nelson sounds like a cool ass dude

the ravens sub has some actual god tier memes honestly they always make me laugh but fuck em
i lowkey loved that the browns are at the table but still just kinda spectating lol



ass

this is god tier i love it and im laughing so fucking hard lol
i like it particularly because we list off a ton of probowlallpro candidates and the response is lalalalala not listening

im excited for sunday i hope we beat them to a pitiful purple pulp
fuck i love it just so well done
bernie america can you believe this i let these kids into my division in my conference dont say nothing when they wanna go by a different name or move cities no sir not me america i respect the individual if thats how they wanna conduct business so be it im not here to control everything they do im just here to win america like ive been doing all season see kids whine the hardest when you got something they want but cant have for most that might be annoying but me oh you know me america its music to my ears and the exact motivation i need to keep this division in line and under my thumb

in the distance the whining and crying of ravens bengals and browns fans can be heard

i miss bernie mac
honestly if you cant laugh at that you need to lighten up thats fucking clever
lol that was good im seeing some deep hatred for cleveland though lol
the schedule part of this is a bit disingenuous they say weve beaten up on nfce teams when both steelers and ravens have played 2 we beat philly and nyg and they beat philly and wft

weve both beaten houston and cleveland we beat denver and tennessee they beat cincy and lost to kc
i love that they say beating up the nfc east must have boosted your egos when 3 of their 5 wins were to the nfce and 1 other was against the bungles theyve had an easier schedule than we have lol

they had 1 tough opponent and got smashed weve had one tough opponent and we won
pretty damn funny lol
in that movie marcus and his wife end up killing bernie mac so
calling tj ass the disrespect
i chuckled it works

however saying weve havent beat anyone isnt say much since neither have they they played one good team and got a butt whoopin we played one good team and won well play each other twice so thats two more good teams
this is great
funny shit well done
how many more times is lamarr gonna choke in big games tune in sunday and see
you gotta admire their commitment to their team and disconnect from reality to put this much effort into a meme well done

that said how you gonna have the steelers and browns trash talk about their 52 start without mentioning 1 of their loses was a blowout against us
wait didnt they only beat the eagles by like 2 holding that against us is ridiculous when they had the same problem lol

regardless this is pretty hilarious lol
we beat the titans in tennessee
this is incredible
lamar jackson ass

marquise brown ass

our record ass
bernie needed to be wearing a white suit in this scene to make this perfect
good let them believe they have a chance it will only bring them more heartbreak
bernie mac looks too much like mike tomlin for this him to be the ravens fan in this scenario definitely switch the roles
2623 against a reindeer and a duck the only person that scares me on the ravens is justin tucker
aged like milk
this aged well eh lads
i think a lot of steelers fans are forgetting their team has missed the playoffs the last two years and only won three playoff games in almost a decade they look good now but lets see how it plays out
so was this supposed to be a moronic insult at us or just a disguised shot at the browns because most of the memes i see over there are delusionally stupid and incorrect
lmfaoooo are they impressed with who they have beat
go back and watch the 2019 week 5 highlights nearly won that game with mason getting knocked out and duck slinging bombs downfield our d had lamar shook three interceptions multiple sacks also had that absolute bs roughing the passer call on third and long that kept their end of game drive alive

dont get me wrong im nervous as hell but that game is a good example of how you beat these guys force him to throw and take advantage if our offense can keep him off the field for a chunk of time i feel better
i have faith that the coaching staff looked hard at the ravens v chiefs game this year and studied how the chiefs took care of them kc has a good defense but ours is better so whatever they did we should be able to emulate it
i wouldnt think wed lose this game but they are coming off a bye week which makes things interesting
earl thomas fucked him dirtier than he does his own brother
well the good thing is that baltimore team has never played against big ben we need sutton and fitzpatrick to double up on hollywood brown so i think its going to be close but we will come away with the w
i want to believe but isnt the counter argument to this that final game of last years season when we played them in their building we got our butts handed to us for a sad close to the season ben will make a difference for sure but i expect a dogfight at best
and lamar has never played ben as well
bet this game on the money line steelers will win
play like we did in the first half last week for 60 game minutes and they cant beat us
realistically if we can control the ground game and run similar pressure schemes to week 5 last year we can are lamar 1 dimensional if we do that i like our chances but we have to convert and not turn the ball over if we do what we did against tennessee we lose
we got robbed by the refs bullchit roughing call at the end period
they are one of the best teams in the league and so are we it should be a good one

tj is going to get robbed of dpoy once again
to add onto it tj watt leads the league in qbhits at 16 and tuitt is third at 14 if tj keeps this up and doesnt get dpoy i say we riot
fantastic but maybe you should put your phone in a charger buddy
did your phone die



yes 60 is not 51 501 or any permutation of any numbers except 60
most sports pundits waking up monday and having to deal with the news that were still good still havent lost and arent making the moves they said we had to in order to compete
his accent is way overly forced

24 points i wouldnt consider that as shut down
this is a really good writeup thanks for sharing
i clearly didnt watch the same game as the person who wrote the article because id honestly argue that the titans exposed our defense
great breakdown of how the front7 dominated tennessee and how the coverage disguises helped keep the titans passing game off by a hair
i really want him to win it and hes playing at a high level but something tells me hes still not getting the respect he deserves maybe the watt name but is there anything significant he needs to do to give him a better shot at this award
more splash plays and sacks i dont think the people voting care as much for stats like tfls and qb hits which he leads the league in
i think with the way our team is trending he wont be making those huge sacks required for dpoy those usually go towards players who take bigger risks this team is so balanced that just bending and not breaking will continue to win us games let garrett have dpoy tj has his mind on a ring
gotta be sack leader i think
he needs to not be hugged every play
its hard to put him above garrett or baker right now but hes still hanging around he just needs to make some big plays and rack up the sacks cause thats what gets the reward
like other people said sacks are a big one theres 2 people that are odds favorites ahead of tj to win dpoy myles and donald and they are 1 and 2 in sacks

i also wonder if bud and alualu and the rest of the front 7 hurt tjs chances somewhat part of what makes donald so terrifying as a defender is that if you want a chance you have to double team him and you kinda can because the rest of the rams d line isnt as big of an issue garrett is the same thing and his supporting cast on defense is even worse you cant double tj all the time because it means the rest of our monster defense can attack you easier and you dont want that so i wonder if the committee is going to consider that as well might be bad for tj personally but thats the kind of problem we want to have on defense
he needs to not be hugged every plau
strip sacks and turnovers he has less strips this year than last but its still very early
tackle lamar and rip his skull and spine out like predator
sack leader would do it i think and we havy cincy 2x still
its gonna be myles sadly
needs to have more splash plays like last year like the other responses have alluded too if he can put up similar numbers he should have a good chance if we werent an 88 team and in the playoffs last year he probably could have won over gilmore
gotta have 15 sacks 3 ff and like 10 tfl
hes leading in tfl gotta be top 3 in sacks probably sacks forced fumbles and picks are the flashy stats which he is lacking in right now
a few more splash plays aka plays of different stats his numbers are through the roof yes bot only in 2 areas but getting a few more strip sacks or ball swatts or interceptions will help him tremendously
play better than everyone else and make more of an impact than everyone else
hope aaron donald gets hurt but seriously he probably needs more turnoversffs or ints and to be near league lead in sacks

are you even active here
old reddit is updated and sometimes i forget to move it over to new reddit the way everything is laid out means i have to change everything twice now its super fun
i assure you the mods are active dont have to be dickish about it a reminder itself was fine
please use this thread to post anything doesnt have to be steelers or football related at all dont downvote in this thread if you see someone being a jerk report it or message the mods about it

need to vent do it here

hatelove something and want to talk about how much you hatelove it do it here
this is a whats bothering me post i guess my mom turns 74 today and has spent the past several days in the hospital for the 2nd time in 6 weeks with congestive heart failure id love more than anything to visit her if these were normal times precovid being hyped up about the upcoming game with the ravens has been a welcome distraction as well as dogsitting for my neighbors for a few days
dallas cowboys fanunfortunately here and while i doubt it will happen but if somehow we have a fucking aneurism and dont sign dak please pick him up he deserves a good team i know ben is still decent but i think dak could help you guys out more any who good luck on the rest of the season ill be blacked out for the rest of the year because dallas is complete ass
i went our drinking with a cop last night she was a huge coke head it was nuts
its been a crappy week and im glad to have football as a distraction
my work tried to get me to come in on sunday the day after halloween and steelers vs ravens game no chance in hell
my dad called me last night and asked if i wanted to fly out to dallas with him next week and go to the cowboys game i was impressed with how there was no doubt in my mind to say no
adam gase still has a head coaching job thats wild
hey fellow steelers fans its november and that means time to let the face caterpillars out of their cocoons this might not be the place to share im not sure but mens mental health is a cause thats often ignored so every sunday ill be popping in to show everyone how greasy my face will get and hope that if nothing else everyone take a second to think about mental health
we need minkah to get 3 turnovers in a game so we can call him hat trick fitzpatrick
im extremely disappointed in james washington he will make the occasional play here and there but he should be demanding the ball with his play at this point in his career he was a 2nd round pick who has been relegated to 4th on the depth chart id consider him a bust at this point

what
what
third what


its called a tea j watt
i feel like whatever the drink is isnt at an acceptable temperature by the time they do all that doodling neat though


haha troy just destroyed a player in retirement
troy polamalu on ig live just now with ed reed

dude caught a faceful of goat shoulder
jesse james caught that ball
this is great
so weve seen what spillane is capable of 11 tackles 2 tfls 1 int 1 td 1 fr a fucking monster but we are also getting williamson so my question is when devin bush is back next year will the linebackers in the game be spillane williamson and devin bush or does linebacker position really matter
williamson i believe is just for the year
at 32 years old and with a cap hit of 7mil i expect vince williams to be a cap casualty if he doesnt renegotiate next year but if spillane keeps balling out we might not be able to resign him for a reasonable price
williamson is a ufa i believe
next year is vinces last year 3 million dead cap and 4 million cap savings if we cut him assuming we can get spillane on a 3 year deal worth around 2 million per year then i think vince is gone or he extends another two years and lowers the cap hit retires at the end of the extension

spillane might play himself out of pittsburgh if he keeps it up ala bj finney last year
spillane and avery are both free agents in 2021 last year of vinces contract

itll be interesting to see what direction they move they could cut vince for cap saving and try to sign spillane or avery to play the buck ilb keep vince and sign either spillane hopefully for cheap to be an eventual replacement for vince

we shall see i dont think theyll keep more than two players who can play buck ilb if spillane isnt cheap they may let him walk its not hard to find buck ilbs in the draft
spillane id assume would be backup and subbed in when these guys need a play off tomlin usually rolls with whoever is playing best that week when it comes to these next man up situations

oh shit well good morning everyone
more depth is never a bad thing i hope he plays well


everyone on rnyjets seems sad about this so that makes me happy

welcome avery
this dudes funny as fuck
when you go from an 08 team to a 70 team
my wife tutored him at uk and is just beyond over the moon excited hes one of us now
i like this guy already
well worth a 5th round pick in 2022 despite spillanes play not much proven depth and spillane hasnt really been tested yet against a pass heavy offense
he had a packed bag waiting by the door
welcome home
this dude can play 28 years old did have an acl in 2019 and missed the entire season was in greg williams doghouse super pumped
whats with the bud dupree comment
something else if he really is a rental and walks after this season id think hell factor into the steelers 2022 comp pick equation
glad he got out of that trainwreck

08 to 70 babyyy
damn he couldnt wait to get the hell out of that dumpster fire
this guys seems hilarious but now im curious did he throw on his pads and go outside to take this photo once he got traded or did he have this prepared beforehand because he was dead set on getting the fuck out of ny
that pic is so hard
anyone have a scouting report on him strengths and weaknesses
love his attitude

hitch the first ride out of town and leave that godawful franchise hire someone else to move your stuff
i for one cannot wait for the illiams williamson dont talk to me or my son ever again memes
wow thats fucking big time huge mid season acquisition there tremendous read and react ability and a very sure tackler easily the best player left on their defense
hes gotta be super happy about this worst to first overnight lol
any chance of resigning him in the offseason seems like the perfect fit to take over for vince
such an epic picture welcome
go straight to primanti bros bro
what makes it great is that you can truly throw out the records as they mentioned in the broadcast if we played them 1000 times both probably win around 500 even last year with backup qbs we probably shouldve won the first match flip sides of the same coin

it sure is fun to beat up on the browns and bengals but its more challenging to know the ravens are always going to punch us in the mouth and vice versa
i know its pretty rare that we win in baltimore and its pretty rare that they win in pittsburgh the fact that we got the win yesterday in baltimore is pretty big

i keep waiting for this team to come out overconfident and play one of those groaner games where it seems like the mojo is missing and we cant even tackle properlyyou all know what i am talking about but it hasnt happened as of yetwhich is cool with me
ben took 5 of the last 6 phuk the ratbirds
i like the next match up with them short week prime time steelers play the jags and the ravens play the physical titans
i dont consider cincinnati or cleveland our rivals i know were their number one rivals but i really just dont think about them yeah vontaze happened and so did myles but those felt like the little brother lashing out after us giving him 30 years of noogies and swirlies

on the other hand i live for balpit some of the most exciting and heartbreaking games of my life have happened between those two teams and i wouldnt trade it for the world its somewhere between mutual respect and mutual hatred
removed
steelering is a deepseated concern that keeps me up at night
i never take any game for granted this the nflany given sunday and all that
yep this is one of those steelersplaydowntoalesseropponent type games on paper we should win 3810 but we steelers fans will be mainlining lexapro by the 4th quarter we will probably squeak out a one score win 2420 i hope im wrong
the cowboys nah its the bengals that this will happen against especially considering they just beat tennessee far easier than we did
any given sunday but im quite hopeful we have a stress free 4th quarter this week

besides its not a fun trash talking week anyway at work the cowboy fans i know have already given up on the season even if they play in a division where 5 wins gets you in the playoffs this season lol
theyll win next week but prob lose to the jaguars they always do
im expecting a bad loss at some point hopefully it wont be to the cowboys
if we lost to the cowboys it really wouldnt matter too much
removed
so it sort of hit me just now apart from having a great team hof qb great offense with young receiving core feel good story and smart rb in conner top o line front seven that im sure gives opposing teams fits of internal rage a mixed secondary of young talent and veteran savvy

can roethlisberger keep his ego in check and help groom his eventual replacement

so we know his history of drafting potential replacements but weve also seen his maturation this past decade

we are set up to compete once again for the afc representative in the superbowl for the next decade along with a hof head coach who is due his expletive respect

will he go the way of favre or brady or will he stick to his word on how this team is the reason i came back
it is up to the team to find a heir and it is not bens responsibility to help him past the usual hey im the qb1 and we need to ensure youre up to speed in case you have to be out there game planning and such

ill give a small personal example
i was promoted about 5 years ago and my boss wanted me to train my replacement

i found it irritating as it went past the heres how to be successful and where the bathrooms are to make a powerpoint of the job responsibilities and duties and expectations

basically she didnt want to train her new employee who reports to her not me

i had to move on with my new job not worry about making a copy and paste template on how to replace me

ben can take it how he wishes whoever the team drafts and selects to replace him is not his concern hell be retired when that change happens i hope not pushed out the door lol
quarterbacks dont groom quarterbacks

genetics parents extended family friends communities youth coaches high school coaches college coaches pro coaches and various kind of trainers throughout their lives groom quarterbacks

other quarterbacks occasionally tell them what they fucked up

the rest of this is just tabloid bullshit
we have large benjamin locked up for next season i could see us drafting a guy he could groom next year or not depending on how this year shakes out ben is 38 but also balling out we could extend him too who knows we are 70 baby lets eat steak
ive never thought bens ego or whatever people want to call it has been a problem they tried to make it appear it was the problem but then we all realized it was perhaps the other party
did anyone groom ben no its a feel good story but unrealistic did mahomes get groomed by alex smith no alex smith was traded my point is rarely does a starting qb get groomed in the nfl they become starters because they outplay the other qbs on the roster
so you know large benjamin personally



must be nice
wtf is this lmfao goddamn you guys love to hate ben

go back and look at masons comments on ben last year fam
okay ego was too crass of a word but lets not pretend the nfl isnt full of divas ive grown up watching the guy we dont know for sure when his time will be up he is 1 of 4 remaining starting qb from early 2000s surely hed want to retire a steeler call it fairytale or wishful thinking but maybe we draft a potential qb1 in the next three years and 7 gives more than tips or advice
so bens job is to win football games not train rookies and such being in the room with him and watching him go about his job is the only training he needs to do obviously hell answer questions when asked but these are adults dude they all have to take care of themselves and their jobs its not bens job to train his replacement its the replacements job to pay attention and learn
he definitely has an ego a la his reaction to when mason was drafted mind you masons performance last year should give any injured starter confidence in retaining their job

however i dont think it matters unless some top prospect is available i dont think qb will be considered in the next draft perhaps the proceeding one he and the team should be all in thisnext season if the team were horrendous then sure start looking for the heir

not bad for a running back
theyre lucky there werent more interceptions jackson was throwing the ball away as he was falling numerous times even the last td pass that he threw was tipped
but he protects the ball so well announcers said so like 10 times
thought that was cheese for a second
delicious
ahh now im hungry and laughing at the ratbirds a familiar feeling

in the immortal words of michael hutchence

bitter tears taste so sweet
i love how they say they had two chances to win down the stretch as if thats an indicator of how they shouldve won two chances down the stretch and you still couldnt pull it off yeah you deserved to lose
its like they dont realize two of their tds were gifted by the refs and we lost two dlinemen as well including the best player in the entire nfl against the rush super early
man i hope the colts and titans beat them lol
remind them that the ravens best win was against cleveland
definitely not the most overrated undefeated team in 2014ish the chiefs were like 80 in the early 2010s the bears were like 70 and missed the postseason or something
ah yes good the gypsy tears will help with the curse must make sure we have plenty of them for the very nice season
not many teams win with 4 turnovers tell him to shit in his own yard

he has been a nice addition i think he is due for a huge game too
outside of the fumblesdrops hes been a bright spot this year

he had one pass yesterday he couldve hauled in ben placed it at his knees and wouldve been difficult grab but he also makes some spectacular catches just got to keep staying consistent
i love his look of always having the black long sleeves i can always find him on the field quickly because of it
i call him cement hands ebron anytime he makes a great play as a shot at all the colts fans saying lmaooo enjoy him he cant catch to save his life

im so glad we got him what a great 12 punch him and vance are
he played great yesterday reminded me of heath yesterday of being the nice fail safe for ben
career resurrected
whats about dwight stone hands
we really needed another solid te and he brings a great energy to the team i was really surprised we got him as cheap as we did
i was very concerned with his lack of hands in the first half yesterday but he sure bounced back
i live in detroit so ive seen a lot of this guy drops will never go away but he is a freak who will make plays every game and he is bought in more than ever on this steelers team its that point in his career where hes proven and now he just wants to go fucking win baby
hes a huge part to our blocking as well
ebrontosaurus
i definitely like his production i just dont get his line of thinking with his on field choices too many times does he jump when he doesnt need to to make the catch that coupled with a few off balance moves thats hes fortunate didnt get him killed i think vance has improved a lot this year too id like to see them both getting targets
i love ebron some of his drops can be frustrating but the good outweighs the negative in my opinion and its nice to have a weapon like him on the team if i were to become an oc one of the first things id ask for other than a franchise qb is a tight end who can go up and get the ball but also create yac ebron fits the bill
he had that smooth ass catch where even the defender looked it off like nah he didnt catch it oh shit nvm he did
yes i agree dynamite player
i dont know about every game hes had a few duds here and there philly game but he played great yesterday
are you sure you are talking about 85
prior to yesterdays average game be stopped on routes doesnt fight for balls dropped passes and fumbled some he caught and waves his hands as if he were interfered on or missed wide open on every play

extremely disappointed in this guy
enjoy it while it lasts hell probably be a cap casualty next year


yo
discyyoto
tf am i looking at
hes made some lights out plays for us the last couple of weeks stepping up and making a td saving tackle on derrick fucking henry the pick 6 fumble recovery feels a bit like a james harrison situation where this seemingly nobody steps in and becomes a playmaker on our defense without a hitch

surely this dude has weaknesses though right what were the weaknesses in his game that caused western michigan to be his best college option why did he go undrafted in 2018 and then why did tennessee not keep him after last season
he didnt take that fumble recovery to the house and i think sometimes he is a little slow in coverage because his gigantic hose of a schlong slows him down
speed he is too slow against outside runs also he is not that good in man coverage
consistency one play hell look like an elite cover lb and the next hell look totally lost may just be communication not sure he also takes some really fucking bad angles he took several on lamar jackson that ended in big runs instead of tfl or short gains gotta imagine bush wouldve been making those plays hes only started twice though and gilbert definitely wouldve gotten some snaps if he were able to play overall we could br a lot worse off with the addition of williamson we should be able to have a decent rotation now
he is fairly average athletically not bad but average he obviously cant cover the ground bush could because no one on the team can he appears physical and i think he is at least serviceable in coverage i thought he struggled at times to shed blocks as a smaller linebacker overall i am happy with his play to this point and have faith
he did get outrun by dobbs off tackle for a pretty big run but no ones perfect
he gets burned in coverage not because hes lost just not agile enough
hes slow sideline to sideline watch highsmiths int spillane was beat badly that wasnt the only time he was beat in coverage watch some of dobbins or jacksons outside runs to the sidelines spillane often took angles too sharp for how slow he is was behind the play regardless the ravens have athletic tes are incredibly athletic fast on the run so it makes sense that this was a poor matchup for spillane further exacerbated by the lack of rest w ug3s injury yet spillane still was a positive contributor which speaks volumes of how hard he works
look at the amount rushing yds we gave up in yesterdays game and then look at how they were attacking us with zone runs

the sideline to sideline speed bush had is what none of our other lbs have and it showed up yesterday in a major way
slower than bush we need that sideline to sideline speed also lacks experience and coverage ability because hes not as athletic as rbs or slot receivers

thats not to say he hasnt far exceeded expectations filling in for bush he should be a good replacement for vince as our early down mike lb if we end up moving on from him this offseason
you werent watching the game if you didnt see his weaknesses yesterday he was directly responsible for just as many backbreaking defensive lapses as he was the pick 6 and 4th down stop the ravens were running right past him around the edge all day long when they werent turning it over to him

speed and experience slot receivers coming across can leave him behind if he doesnt get a step ahead can take bad reads on some schemes and end up behind the play

x200b

people saying hes not athletic are utterly stupid he is in the nfl you are on your computer he is athletic
pass coverawatches replay of him jumping the route and taking an interception to the house

ummmmmm
he is out of position a lot and not very athletic
he is slow our offense really depends on a fast mlb so this isnt the best scheme fit for him he is obviously a talented guy that can come up in clutch spot but getting avery williamson was a good move

we may have to go 151 just to secure the 1st seed
that bills game in buffalo in december is going to be a tough one
tbh its possible for them to go 160 they just have to not make any big stupid mistakes seems like they won the two toughest games of their year well see
i really hate the new bye rules
sometimes ill randomly open the nfl app just to look at the standings
i actually like the new rules or at least im not opposed how many times have games in december been a waste bc playoffs were already decided the push to lock up first will hopefully keep things interesting down the stretch
victory monday is the only monday i enjoy
yeah ive been a little obsessed with power rankings the last couple years and now with them consistently at 1 or 2 sometimes 3 its beautiful
a steelers and kc game for the afc championship has the potential to have a wider appeal than most super bowl matchups if both teams finish with two or fewer losses
removed
from all the highs and lows of yesterday leave your final thoughtsanalysisdiscussiontakeaways from yesterdays game

this thread is intended for levelheaded mindful discussion and less kneejerk reactions keep this in mind before commenting

as always dont be a damn jagoff follow our rules we all have different opinions and mindsets but were all here to talk steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day keep it cool
can we talk about how good highsmith has been dudes been making the most of his opportunities

also watt was incredible again 8 pressures 5 qb hits and a sack

spillane continues to step up the plan moving forward might be to have him on the field and sub in williamson on dime replacing marcus allen

the fact that we can play so shitty and still win against a very good ravens team is incredible

ravens ran more plays 7950 out rushed us 26548 had more passing yards 192173 and more top 35222438 we shouldve been blown out yet we won great teams find a way to win
very excited to be 70

also did anyone catch tj yelling at keith butler during the first half i saw them both screaming at each other wasnt sure what was going on
i am trying to be rational so bear with me

x200b

but we might be the greatest team in all of history
a complete team dline was huge claypool selling jerseys the coach with the most expressive face of all humanity still shows how he feels with a mask on

next week will show whether the play down to their competition label still sticks
butt is still clenched next day


we got absolutely shredded on the ground which really surprised me i thought we would force lamar to throw on us and wed get torched but the defense came up huge on 4th down stops


not sure whos call it was to let ben just call whatever he wanted but we watched a hofer do what he does you cant teach that its why it will be so hard to find a good replacement when ben retires


tldr


the offence fd up the defense fd up


super bowl teams will find a way to win
for someone who spends so much time working on his own brand and i have no problem with this get yours i dont ever want to hear that juju gives anything less than 100 in fact i think he may have less natural born talent comparatively of course but he makes up for it with raw determination i hope we can keep him this offseason no matter how unlikely that may be
is there any reason why we wait so long for ben to go no huddle im sure fatigue is the biggest one but even then i feel like they could do it earlier seems like they always wait until theyre in a hole
anyone have that graphic that showed how many of the pitbal matchups have been decided by 7 points or fewer
any word on cam yet
marlon humphrey said he has covid hopefully this doesnt affect our guys from the game yesterday but we are definitely winning games we would lose in the past if we play a complete game where we are at our best i dont think there is a team who can keep up and beat us
jets
hello chiefs fan here i havent watched any of your games so i was curious what are the strengths of your team im curious to how we stack up to each other
god humphrey has covid and played against us yesterday great
robert spillane makes splash plays and most of the other plays he should make

playing the best and most creative running team in the league is tough never thought we would give up 265 yards on the ground but a win is a win and that stop on the second to last drive showed who this team really is

highsmith gets the rookie of the game award even with chase grabbing 5 balls and a touchdown that fumble happens sometimes excited to see this young and talented bunch develop

jordan berry deserves a game ball imo he pulled it together after that first shank and put together a solid second outing back canaday had at least one bad snap and he was still able to pin the ravens twice all three phases need to contribute to a win against the reigning mvp and division champs

cant wait to watch our boys get after the red baron next week
honestly fuck raven fans and there piece of shit fans there sub was just hoping tj and ben got career ending injuries and they also sent tuitt death threats
like coach t said they did not play well at times i think not having bush hilton and alualu in the game hurt the run defense but what a great team effort to hold on and win

x200b

the one thing that really bugs me despite the win is the last offensive possession they really should have gotten a first down and put the game away i dont know if it was the play calling or what but it felt like they could have made a better effort there
i know we are going to drop a game eventually because winning in the nfl is tough but damn it feels good to be undefeated this late in the season
im glad lamar isnt our quarterback but damn hes fun to watch he made dupree look like the slowest guy on the field when he bit on the handoff
i will downvote any jagoff talking about damn trap games in nfl or our subreddit tomlin has a good hold of these guys and our team is full of young hungry teamplayers who are going to give every game their all we no longer have a roster full of divas who think their shit doesnt stink there is no way this team will drop one to the cowboys
like a lot of you im frustrated with play calling the metaphor i use is our offense is like an exotic sports car that can burn over 210 mph but instead of opening it up were cool to go 75 in a 70 in the middle lane damn we have so much talent i want them to let it rip
this team is making amazing half time adjustments this year coaching staff have been 1110 given the restrictions theyre facing due to covid
on the bright side if someone catches covid19 from the ravens we might get a free bye week when we need it most

on the even brighter side 70

offense needs to come alive sooner like we did against the titans the first half was brutal to watch but the halftime adjustments showed up quick in the third quarter and was ultimately enough to topple one of the best teams in the league

defense wise we had to lean on them way too much because the offense was flat and playing from behind for a good chunk of the game still seeing some small mistakes and missing plays because they are going for the sack or wanting to strip the ball its great when it works but a team like the ravens can and did burn us on some of those missed attempts

another too close for comfort game but i much prefer that sort of game than what happened with the titans where it felt like luck gave us the win compared to this coming down to skill and how both teams were coached

thankfully the next three games are gonna be easier and hopefully guys like heyward can be rested
bro leveon bell is garbage doesnt matter what team he is on but more importantly yesterday was a testament to our teams ability to stay the course and get the job done if we can beat the ravens we can beat anyone on our schedule the moment we get complacent is the moment we lose to the jags or the bills we have to keep playing hard and stick together im so proud of spillane and juju spillane really took it upon himself to step up and fill bushs shoes best he can and juju has been second fiddle but he was instrumental in our win with hustle plays so proud of him for staying with us and not getting pissy and pushing over kicker nets love this team
i know people point out that qbs get rocked standing perfectly upright in the pocket but i just cant see it being good for your long term prospects to consistently run your 212lb qb up the middle
when do we trade for hekker lmao
we were lucky to not be 287 down at ht but what a bounce back fuck yes
espn still with the disrespect or at least an article espn linked to


i want to see what we do to baltimore with mike hilton on the field
the amount of ravens fans still crying about the final play of the game is remarkable to me im not sure how you watch that play and think pass interference
is anyone else mad that the offence couldnt get a first down to ice the game forcing the defence back in the field leading to they heyward injury
you guys all realize that winning vs tennessee and baltimore means the steelers are almost definitely going to lose to the nooch and dallas right

the titans just lost by two scores to the bungles and brady almost lost to daniel jones who is a turnover in human form aint no easy games in the nfl especially not with the steelers
removed

he made a couple of splash plays in the second half but a big reason why they ran so much in the first half was because he wasnt doing the job he was supposed to after alualu went down he did figure it out and step up which is all you can ask for a back ups back up
buggs in the pass rush looked fantastic his hand usage as was phenomenal to win 1 on 1 but his ability to finish was what impressed me the most
he better have as tomlin said he played like trash in the 1st half only matters how you play in the last drive against that team though
tomlin said he needed to make those plays at the end of the game cuz he was fucking up early
that might be because we entered the game with the best run defense in the nfl we started the game holding various raven runners to tiny bits of yardage

and then alualu went down and they ran for damn near 300 yards on us

he made a play or two but he was f terrible on the day

heres the high praise tomlin lavished upon him

we had no other choice but to use him and he wasnt any good when he 1st got in so it was about time he made a play

enough love the fact that we traded for a linebacker and not a dt yesterday is probably more love than he deserved
check the flair but also his energy was what drove the defense


unpopular opinion but i still think the chiefs are the best team in the afc until theyre knocked out of the playoffs honestly mahomes is just a whole different animal than jackson or any qb we have played
psst its not real
wtf even is this
im watching espn right now and of the people in there said that the buccaneers are better than the steelers
i am of the mindset that 1 kc is really damn good and i wont discount that 2 id love to be underestimated and undefeated all the time thats the ideal scenario in my book
throwing that ball underhand was easier than throwing it overhand theres a reason why in baseball you flip it underhand to second base during a double play and not fire it overhand
slow news day the pens arent the best team in the nhl right now and the chiefs arent the best team in the nfl wl records matters besides mahomes isnt to the nfl what crosby is to the nhl not even close

this could be a real article
the nfl has been around 700 years
i for one do not mind being underestimated let them sing the praises of the chiefs we just need to keep winning
wtf is this this isnt real right the writer might as well of said he was on the kc team bush jerkin pat off while he was typing this up yes hes amazing but cmon ya goin too far saying hes best at all sports
fucking haters
they will fuckin suck mahomes off until he is a week in the grave great qb generational talent but why write an article like this and they won against the worst team in the entire nfl wow what an achievement
although i strongly dislike how much espn absolutely blows the chiefs and mahomes while vastly undermining the steelers i do agree the chiefs are the best team in football for most of the season patrick mahomes and andy reid have been dormant simply sitting behind ceh and bell whove punched every team in the mouth allowing them to keep all of their tricks in their hip pocket for the post season

can someone please convince me how this is just a broken clock being right twice a day

x200b


he is full of absolute shit he posted this yesterday morning



he picks us to lose all the time then acts like some messiah when we win
in the past few years poni has had some chances to host national shows on cbs radio nationally he has seemed articulate and intelligent during those segments and it was honestly enjoyable to listen to

but locally poni is the worst of the worst its heavily a shtick and yinzers give him the attention he craves but he is genuinely a laughably bad radio host locally the fan is taunting us by trotting out guys like him ziese cook and dunlap those guys prove that sports radio sells itself they could put anyone in those time slots and get listeners and they choose these hacks

they had a fun show with starkey and mueller 26pm but they broke that up and now mueller is starting to shamelessly copy ponis antics

rant over but its just frustrating that every weekday time slot on the fan has at least one insufferable host and i wont even name the other fm sports radio host that has a daily weekday show on a different station


imagine beating ba brady and ab in the superbowl
this is the way
wet
last time i was in tampa there were more steelers fans than bucs fans so this would probably divide the city
finally something based on science
subscribe
yeah my boss who is also a steelers fan wants a bucs v steelers bowl and it could definitely happen at this point im a big russell wilson fan so i want the hawks and steelers again personally with the steelers grabbing the 7th trophy of course
brb
from maddens mouth to gods ear
i just subscribed to this timeline
ill take it
of course somehow brady would become the first qb in history to have a homefield advantage for the super bowl
yessir
what games did we loose
we have a really nice schedule the rest of the way too four playoffs teams with the two most difficult home and five 2win or worse teams

i wont say it yet but im beginning to think it
remindme 98 days
this is my wet dream
sounds good to me
this is what dreams are made of

minkah and jj

first of all how dare you
the joe flacco part is great also how do you make these this is so awesome
lmao this was great
teach me your ways
i loved the ill move your team to indy in the middle of the night again lol
best comedy movie of all time cmv
hilarious
chiefs sub killing it with the memes
that was awesome
loving the spice
hey you go over there and punch that guy really fucking hard in the face


sorry man blam

harbaugh still crying over this and saying he was concerned for player safety we all know he just wanted a bail out from his rb throwing the ball
just want to say you guys played a hell of a game yesterday and this division race is gonna be one of the best that defense is special and its gonna be a formidable opponent for the next decade or so see you on thanksgiving and fuck you
looking forward to it seems like this might be a 3game season against the ravens again
i feel like the steelers and ravens have that ron burgundywes mantooth relationship

from deep down in my stomach with every inch of me i pure straight hate you but goddammit do i respect you
it was definitely fun

thanksgiving night should be a great sequel
see you on thanksgiving and fuck you has me cracking up over here lol
lamar seems like a true sportsman and standup guy i admire the kid and i think he has the potential to get better with age and experience if he stays healthy
fuck you too buddy see you on thanksgiving
fuck you too my good sir
great game fuck you and have a nice day 3
hahahaha i love this guys departure hats off to you fine sirand terrible person for being a ravens fan
awesome game and fuck you too see you thanksgiving
great game i honestly hope lamar learns how to not take so many hits hes a special player and i want him to have a long career
a wild ravens fan has appeared
turkey pumpkin pie and rivalry

in the spirit of the rivalry and in good fun heres a meme


well said dude as always they are some of the hardest hitting games between rivals that are playing be safe and by the way double fuck you see yall thanksgiving

fuck you too you kind bastard
i am already looking for round 3 this year
what division race
thank you and fuck you
right back at you ratbird best rivalry in football
best rivalry in the nfl by far gg and i love the baltimore areaharbor
i said gg on ur subreddit and they all hated me for it
awesome message the feeling is mutual fuck u right back but man is it fun to watch steelers and ravens play its so much fun to hate your team and players looking forward to thanksgiving
am i the only one who gets annoyed at this whole coming in peace garbage who cares say your piece hopefully everyone is civil call it a day why does everyone call attention to this every time i dont understand
fuck you and the ravens

lol fuck off dude i dont want raven fans to act all nice and shit now after seeing some of the stuff yall were saying on your sub oh and fuck you too
i hate these types of posts with a passion
the race is between you and the browns for second and frankly the browns are a bigger threat come postseason
lamar jackson and ryan tannehill are the most overrated quarterbacks in the nfl

go fuck yourself
if lamar hadnt handed the ball over this could have been a blowout i dont have much confidence in the next matchup
why do people do this
removed
probably not the best time since one of your shitheads went out and got covid right before our game
nah fuck you its funny how the worse team always thinks its going to be a close race for the division enjoy the titans in the wildcard round


aww shit here we go again
from now going back


the great one
the great one
the gold standard for the great one

fug that means our site will be closed down
ugh hope he didnt infect any of our guys
i hope that he doesnt get really sick from it and recovers quickly and that it didnt spread to anyone else on his team or our team fuck covid19 wouldnt wish that on anyone with how contagious it is

get better soon marlon
pain
this could actually be beneficial to us if they end up making us sit out a week like the titans got as a reward wtf then cam and the boys can rest a bit we deserve some sort of bye week
ravens fan here id be pretty nervous about this humphrey was sick earlier in the week but was testing negative and returned to practice theres a chance hes not the only raven that contracted it or has it
luckily for us he was nowhere near any of our receivers
all steelers tests came back negative this morning
fuck the ravens
i will be so pissed if members of our team got infected
damn dirty rat birds strike again
noooooo fuck shit noooo
sheesh this could get horrible for all of those with a vested interest in the steelers players fans front office etc
stay away from my bb claypool
huge loss for the ravens if true their corners make everything else work
stupid fucking ravens franchise lol how do you let this happen he was literally sick on wednesday
bbbbbbbooooooooooooooo

dont mind me shitbirds fans just returning the favour
well it was a nice season while it lasted

got me hyped shit
i need me a super bowl too avery lets get it
about 2 hours too late my dude

i got the rona hopefully ill be back healthy soon

incubation periods can be a week or two but always a good sign for all negatives regardless means that no one had contracted covid from the week leading up to the game at least

x200b

fuck this is gonna be another stressful week
this is entirely meaningless

it takes at least a couple days to test positive after coming in contact with it

wednesday tests are the big ones which they will get the results of on thursday i believe
dont like that last game tomlin was pacing around with his mask down i understand he wasnt at increased risk in that situation but as a leader i thought he was setting a good example by never letting it down now he does that and were also going to be on high alert for two weeks disappointing all around on the covid front
thank fuck for that


if we couldve beaten the jets last year and made the playoffs tomlin wouldve won it hope he gets it this year but may go to someone like stefanski since he will probably take the browns to the playoffs




but what about the contact to the head minkah plays dirty

i hear them whining all the way in chicago time honored harbaugh tradition
i thought about this meme when that ravens fan did a coming in peace gg but fuck you post earlier thats a good team over there we seem to have a solid game plan against them looking forward to seeing the adjustments on both sides but next time is at heinz field respect but its at our house next time and home field is huge for pitbal
the only good game on thanksgiving
larun jackson is overrated
if u took the time to look at the comments on a bunch of ravens social media u would see all ur fans saying gg ez u guys suck lmao makes u all look bad and then u see the ravens subreddit tryna have an actual conversation abt the game

everyone please bow down to the knee god
wheres the guy that was in here saying he definitely tore his acl trust me im a pt
but the lachman test was positive
boooooooo

ohh wait im not a ravens fan
good news for both him and alualu so far fortunately we have what should be easy games on the horizon but we are going to start to feel the week 4 bye
really glad this wasnt anything serious
thank god maybe rest him against the cowboys rather have a worse defense in that game than lose cam for the whole season
fantastic news what was the update on alualu
while its not an acl i can assure you quad injuries even minor ones are no joke and can linger for a while heres hoping they allow him proper time to recover so it isnt made worse
wow i really thought it was something serious at the time so happy cam is ok
sit cam against the cowboys for sure
hopefully wormley comes back this week
fucking sigh of relief
i was really betting on the mcl sprain for heyward and something even less minor and odd for alualu and quite happy having those reversed since neither got the dreaded acl tear
thank god still remember this guy in the sugar bowl gs arkansas he was a force to be reckoned with just an absolute monster a terror to ryan mallet
cam is too strong to get hurt
i was so afraid that injury timeout would give the ravens a chance to win the game with seconds left on the clock turns out that injury hurt us just as little as it hurt heyward
hopefully no time missed a week or 2 at the most
this is great would love to see a lot of rotation in the upcoming weeks
im wondering how the approach should be the schedule eases off a bit but you cant take em for granted either
defense definitely takes a hit with he and alualu likely both missing this weeks game and potentially the next three or four but this could have been much worse news i think if buggs works as the starter for the week well see him play more like he did in the second half which should be serviceable for the time being tough to replace cam both in production and leadership but at least we havent lost him for the year
relaxation
ahh so my timely rooster sacrifice paid off
wow that was the longest i ever held my breath 25ish hours

any word on tyson alualu i admittedly have not looked to hard for info
and alualu
glad hes okay what about alualu anyone know
lemme pray to the injury gods

weak quad can fuck ligaments for the love of god cam miss a couple weeks so we have you in january
he was faking it good job helping us catch our breath


take a couple weeks off
all things considered not too bad were 70 and just beat 2 of the toughest teams on our schedule we can weather the storm for a few games seems we dodged a bullet with cam and alualu buggs played well yesterday
take all the time he needs buggs did an admirable job stepping in and made some big plays i dont want alualu coming back too soon i want him healthy late in the season and in the playoffs when it counts

to date i dont think there have been any cases spread during a game lets hope that continues
ratbird tryna spread its diseases on us
rat birds ruin everything
birds of pestilence
he played every snap yesterday
to quote the article marlon humphrey star cornerback for the baltimore ravens announced monday on twitter that hes tested positive for covid19

how could he not have known i assume theyre tested prior to the game something smells funny like a ratbird coverup

everything about his body language makes me laugh
i love how he is just a huge slap in the face to the browns
poor guy had no idea it was a running play thought it was a pass in which that push by the wr would be illegal but nope it was a run play and dude got tricked with very little effort lol
he lifts more
ohwoah
ive said it before and ill say it again

ebron in the background of these vids just chuckling at our young goofy corps is one of my favorite things
sometimes youre the bug sometimes youre the windshield
man it looks like a blast to play in the nfl lol
butdo you even


this is great news
but it was a positive acl tear test

great news get better work on that
thats a huge relief i was getting really worried having cam out the rest of the season would be horrible
thank you sweet lord jesus and alualu should only miss a couple weeks with his injury so looks like our dline is still alive and kicking definitely helps we play two bottom feeders the next two weeks
steelers dl cam heyward who limped off the field yesterday afternoon is dealing with a minor quad injury source said nothing serious

i think spillane will have to play himself out of the job but at the first sign of him having some struggles they wont hesitate to make the change and try williamson

but so far spillane hasnt done anything to lose the job can he keep that level of play up for another 6 weeks well find out
i think well see all three of bince spillane and avery cycled in and out of the lineup based on situation once avery gets up to speed i dont think either spillane nor avery will simply be backing up the other

spillane may not be the sharpest player on the defense but hes shown hes a playmaker these past few weeks and deserves playing time if avery can be that solid rock that always does the little things correctly basically the inverse of spillane than i think were good to go
he needs more live game experience his speed is what it is but 3 weeks against lesser competition better get his anticipation and reads a lot stronger otherwise i think he will get replaced by avery
thats good we gave no real depth i like this move more and more

i think it turns into a rotation once williamson is up to speed on our defense spillane has been playing well and his performance doesnt warrant getting sent to the bench that said williamson is too good to be left on the bench all game having three capable of starting at ilb is a nice problem to have
spillane is getting tackles and that huge block because theyre targeting him like weakest link aim here
spillane prolly starts until the thanksgiving game avery is probably starting by then maybe the following week regardless im very thrilled with the level of play from spillane considering what bush did for us
x doubt
i think this is a good move other teams will watch film of the ravens game and likely assume we can be beat at the run yes its ridiculous but still so im guessing they bring in another lb to cycle out run stopping in case a team thinks they can body the dl again
spillanes a playmaker havent had an ilb like that since shazier
spillane is outplaying bush by a landslide i mean the mack ilb is supposed to make a bunch of plays everything is set up for you to be consistently involved in everything bush wasnt doing much at an action packed position

removed
that is more than the following teams colts giants bears cowboys chiefs packers texans chargers vikings 49ers falcons seahawks bengals jets lions patriots panthers titans raiders and jaguars
woulda been easier to list the teams its not higher than tbh
any other trio even close to them

im always good for getting more oline and dline depth maybe safety to shore that up i dont think well see anything else though
sign gilmore get darnold for depth retroactively get jameis for even more depth and maybe kenny golladay and checkdown mike for good measure
trade a 7th for dalvin cook get jj watt for free through persuasion and then scam the patriots for gilmore
no need the only reason we traded for a mlb is because bush got hurt
safety

we have minkah theres maybe 12 better safeties in the entire league and edmunds who is a capable backup

who would we go get lmao
nfl trade deadline isnt like the other leagues you dont want to be giving up all your midround picks for rentals because those turn into depth guys you count on going forward so they wont waste them trying to upgrade someone like sean davis and probably not the linemen either

if there was one additional move id make it would be bringing in a veteran qb as long as they didnt give up anything meaninful you probably arent winning a super bowl without ben but id much rather try with someone like andy dalton instead
unless it is signing a temporary fa i dont see it the williamson signing was a good value at a place we suddenly had need we didnt over pay for it and we are getting a good player at a good value

how about we save some of these future picks for our drafts we didnt get here by trading them all away as most of the core of this team were players we drafted were in a good place right now and there is no need to take a flyer when weve been doing well filling in where we needed
i would have said snacks for depth while alualu and heyward have injuries if seattle doesnt protect him id poach him

other than that i cant really think of anything
yes
dline seems like itd be nice to have but im just a random person on the internet
if alualu is going to be down for a while maybe we need ntdt help butler came out in a 4 3 in the second half to compensate for the loss of alualus run stuffing kicking camtuitt inside with budwatt playing de and highsmithspillanevince playing the lb spots before that we were getting gashed between the tackles ravens then countered by going more off tackle and straight college options to the outside

maybe calling poe isnt a crazy idea if alualu is really hurt but then again poe has dropped a lot these last few seasons
maybe sign dontari poe or some cheap dl for additional depth unless they want to elevate calvin taylor from the ps i think this team is pretty solid as is
not really a huge fan of isiah buggs being the nt in base defenses

or at idl if theres another injury to camtuitt

juju for gilmore

another hot take guy he will enjoy this because his name will get attention
dude should not have a job after this holy shit
i understand everyone was worried about ben coming back from an injury but to say the steelers would be worse than the bengals a team who had 2 wins last year is just horrible like how do you get paid to talk about sports and thats your prediction
some one in our organization fucked his wifegirlfriend and he cant let it go
brinson has always been a hack
45 have a decent iq

middle dude had a negative one
ha what a fuck
yeah what was this guy smoking i think bal or pit was a toss up at beginning of year but the browns and bengals
best exercise to lose

how relevant
aged like milk dude should be fired for that shit opinion
this sub prolly wont like this but i actually think will brinson is entertaining hes openly admitted he was way wrong about this and has openly claimed the steelers are now favorites for the division hes not kellerman who will cling to these ridiculous takes he didnt buy 7 being back healthy he was wrong and admitted it hes what sports media should be admitting when theyre wrong if theyre gonna hot take
he just guessed wrong on bens recovery he certainly wasnt alone



juju is a machine right now he catches anything in his vicinity and holds on to it like his life depends on it i know we miss 97yard td juju but hes the perfect slot wr
thats crazy considering ben had been one of the most dropped qbs in the league so far
friggin larry fitz still ballin aint he like 80 years old

respect your elders
most catches without a drop this season
1 travis kelce 48
2 davante adams 43
3 juju smithschuster 39
4 randall cobb 30
5 larry fitzgerald 29

juju has been automatic on third downs this year
despite people saying hes not producing this season is being over shadowed by claypool hes actually leading or team in targets and catches
kelce definitely had a drop last week

which primanti bros location is better
judging by body language from everybody around them it seems like a healthy argument both guys just frustrated trying to find answersside note ravens only scored 1 td after this so
i love how minkah and streetclothes mike hilton both put a hand out to calm tj down the whole team feels the frustration of getting gashed by the ratbirds but they hold each other accountable i love this team
as others have said probably the amount of focus he was told to put on lamar hes a play maker and probably felt like he could have made the right reads and gotten a few tackles in the backfield

our d made lamar uncomfortable though took him out of playmaking position where he likes to be i think thats what won us the game in the end
just trying to read body language here but it feels like butler is blamingaccusing him of something and watt is like fuck you im doing my job
mink and hilton being leaders here this is just teej getting a little fired up
was wondering that too the nfl needs its own jomboy any of you guys that want to get internet famous should jump right on that
read in another thread somewhere that tj was telling him to stop making me charge the mesh and that it was putting them at a disadvantage somewhere else i gather that means the same thing others have said in regard to focusing on lamar
lol hadens face
hot dog is not a sandwich obviously
knowing keith butler he probably said that he thought game of thrones season 8 was pretty good
tj was probably getting pissed at having to force lamar to pitch it on those rpo if that was the case im in full agreement with tj force lamar to run the ball and punish him if the ravens are willing with lamar getting smacked every down well take that but tj had to force lamar to pitch it every time and you can see the rbs were gashing us for 10 every time
minkah just trying to get a drink of gatorade
after watching this a couple times i think tj was probably getting blamed for not making a call im not gonna say im a pro lip reader or anything but looks like he literally says im the one who said it someone wasnt doing what they were designed to do for sure i think tj and bud were switching responsibilities on the option relative to the play right im probably way off

love the way minkah and mike get on him about it the way joe looks at him like bro relax well get it im sure tj and butler laughed about it since then i love that week 8 is the super bowl for tj watt the sky is the limit for this kid
somebody said similar in the game thread but watt really needs to cool his shit there at that point we were getting our asses kicked on defense and butler was trying to light a fire under the whole unit and instead of using it watt took it personal you can tell by everyone elses body language that watt is the oddman out here even minkah is like dude stop


moe shoots is on the case this guy is fucked
good on them fuck that homophobic asshole
good that guy is a piece of shit
thank you for following through with this saw the video this morning and was disgusted not by the fandom but the complete disrespect for his fellow human this behavior needs to be eradicated from society

ravens fan and season ticket holder fuck that guy thanks for following up thats actually pretty close to where my tickets are in a noncovid year the ravens typically do a great job tossing those morons and revoking psls hope that ends up the case here ive brought opposing fans as guests many times cheer for your team not against mine be respectful and we rarely have issues that garbage doesnt deserve to be at the bank
niceee
nice good work no place for that behavior at all
post this and the video to rbaltimore i bet there are some people that would love to see if they know this colossal prick
good job
hope they find out and not only does he get banned from future events but his employers sees the announcement and he gets fired as well

so fucking sick of the amount of hate in the world especially over something people have no control or say over

hate someone for the team they root for not who they love
absolute fucking idiot out of all the words to yell at full volume in a public place thats literally one of the worst hope he gets banned if nothing more than for pure stupidity keep those people out of public as much as possible
homie gotta shooter on him now
do you guys honestly think hes homophobic im pretty sure hes just talking shit cuz hes wearing a steelers jersey also i see some of you saying he should be banned for life and get fired from his job what the fuck is wrong with yall man this is that cancel culture bullshit its not that serious
removed

looking at the remaining schedule think i see a lot more dubs
lol we have 3 games against good teams left on the schedule forgot how easy it is this year
im glad the indy game is at home probably will have a lot of impact on seeding bills game too probably most difficult game left but still time to fix things if they lose that one
142 roll through baltimore at home but drop the buffalo game then week 17 the browns game doesnt matter for the standings we rest everyone and they take an empty win from us
just realized we made it out of the titansschedulefuckeryjob unscathed beat the titans on the road without bush and with all their covid players returning and beat the ravens on the road with the ravens coming off their new presteelers bye


so ratbirds are whining about cheapshots at lamar

but this is exactly what we did last year in the horrible last game of the year rg3 was running rpo and we hit the snot out of him on each video just keep watching how we hit rg3 on all these plays

if they are going to expose their qb and pretend he still has the ball then you need to punish him over and over again

i tried to make a single cut but it wouldnt let me so i posted these as separate videos heres a playlist of them link


i enjoy watching rg3 jump and dance to try to avoid the hits i didnt enjoy rewatching that game
yea when i saw them asking for roughing it just showed their lack of knowledge on what is allowed same thing with the final play calling for pi or defenseless receiver when minkah has just as much right to ball as the receiver
if only there was some sort of book of rules that could explain it something with words defining roughing the passer as

x200b

any physical acts against a player who is in a passing posture ie before during or after a pass which in the referees judgment are unwarranted by the circumstances of the play will be called as fouls

and

roughing will be called if in the referees judgment a pass rusher clearly should have known that the ball had already left the passers hand before contact was made

like if youre pretending or hiding the fact that you got rid of the ball
they should know by now that rpo is not protected by roughing the passer if they want to view it as cheap sure whatever we arent going to act like its not a free shot on a fast qb and its harbaughs fault if he keeps calling that and they cannot protect lamar

its legal bit of a dick move and that is how tough football is played
this is exactly how steeler ds have been in the vanguard of driving this cheap gimmicky style of offense out of the nfl each time its reared its ugly head for a season or two

dick lebeau showed the league the way in driving the read option into obscurity for a while in the earlier 2010s make the qb pay the price every play whether he keeps the ball or not thatll stop him from running eventually one way or another

nothing has changed its still gimmickry its still effective until teams have seen it enough to know its coming and uncle dicks plan of taking it out on the most valuable piece of the offense is still the antidote

dont want your qb hit like a runner dont make him a running threat
when defending a team that runs the option you have your players take assignments in the old days of the triple option you had a different guy assigned to the dive the qb and the pitch man that player was told to tackle their assignment every option play and trust their teammates would do their job as well

that holds true today they run any sort of option you tackle your assignment thats why the option wasnt run in the pros for years and years teams didnt want to get their qb killed ravens fans need to understand that if lamar is running option he is going to get hit blame your oc and hc for putting him in this situation while doing so he is a runner plain and simple and qb protections no longer apply
in the shot gunpistol this is the way to play it our problem yesterday is when they ran it to the outside our edge rushers forced lamar to pitch it and their rbs were gashing us for 10 our edge rushers should have taken the rb option away from lamar and forced him to run it himself punishing everytime they did that wouldve forced them to get away from it really quick

i love steeler nation but as a fan too yall piss me off when you want coach t fired tomlin has never had a losing season 8 playoff runs 6 division titles and 3 afc championship games 2 super bowl game and a title in super bowl xliii thats better than most coaches in the nfl i also think he should have been coty last year for leading pittsburgh to an 88 season with a very plagued offense and when everyone counted on us to go maybe 412 and be last in the division
tomlins only sin is being in the same conference as bill belichick for his entire tenure it made fans hold him to impossible standards and kept him from winning multiple ringswhich he may well do this year same reason ben gets so disrespected in the medias legacy conversations
can we also just appreciate how fucking cool he looks out there too with the dark rb aviators and the face mask its just a final boss look that goes well with an undefeated team
i think it took us to realize what exactly he was dealing with when the circus was in town to appreciate just how great of a coach he is ive always been a tomlin fan but these past 18 months hes easily been the best head coach in the nfl in all phases
id like to see someone try to name 3 living and active football head coaches nfl or college not named belichek or saban who are clear cut irrefutably better than tomlin
i love tomlin
should be coty this year
tomlin is the best stand up guy class act hell of a coach i cant deal with the whiney fair weather fans calling for him to be fired every game we are down at the half fire him then crickets when we win absolutely bullshit there is a reason why we are consistently above 500 at the least each season its continuity that torch being passed from noll to cowher to tomlin
i dont think a coach should get fired unless they do something morally wrong on have two losing seasons in a row mike tomlin doesnt do losing seasons and things of that nature
full disclosure after the not winning a sb in the killer bs era i wanted him gone i felt like the team lacked discipline and made constant stupid mistakes on and off the field i put that on tomlin i always thought he was a good coach but maybe we needed a change and he needed a change in scenery and it would be mutually beneficial to part ways

and heres where is gets ugly after the packers fired mccarthy i thought that his offensive mind would jumpstart the team and i was really rooting for the steelers to hire him to replace tomlin

boy was i fucking wrong that take has not aged well one bit and it just goes to show you that maybe just maybe the people in charge know what theyre doing

it turns out bell bryant and brown were complete cancers and distractions colbert adjusted and brought in high character guys like juju claypool dj and connor ben is healthy and tomlin has been incredible the team is just different this year really feels like this could be a special year and im so thankful that the steelers brass dont listen to rabid idiot fans like me

and lol at what mccarthy is doing in dallas this year
it is pretty cool that we will have had three hall of fame coaches in a row
i have no idea why people want him fired after almost making the playoffs yesterday with no ben and a plague of injuries throughout the season tomlins proved himself to be a phenominal coach
he has been a top 5 more likely a top 3 hc for years and 2019 was a master class in getting the most out of a bad situation he isnt perfect but id still take him over pretty much any hc out there
after watching how good all things considered last season turned out it solidified what an amazing coach tomlin truly is
his issues with time management and underperforming against weak teams are valid concerns but should be easily overshadowed by 0 losing seasons and going 88 with whatever the fuck we had on offense last year
always happy to see sensible posts like this the tomlin hate is absurd he has his weaknesses but hes a damn good coach and i hope he sticks around for a good while
tomlin is one of the greats not a lot of coaches in any sport can say theyve never had a losing season as a head coach hes hella underrated if anything
i feel tomlin deserves some of his criticisms especially with clock management at times and the team underperformed against subpar teams however i still think he is a good headcoach borderline elite
reason number 751 that tomlin is the best coach

ben dinucci this nfl thing its hard

meanwhile tomlin leads duck and mason to 88 record last year
his regular season record is not always what draws up the fire talk its playoffs


if we get bounced in the first round an undefeated regular season will not matter in this sub


if you think winning a super bowl automatically makes that all go away see the penguins sub where their recent back to back stanley cup winning coachthought to be impossible in the cap era is often the discussion of replacement


this is the life in pro sports where your city has had great success

its still early but it kinda seems like joe burrow is going to take over as the man in the north when ben retires
hes not an elite qb he really is a system qb if lamar throws it 40 times in a game theres a 95 chance the ravens are going to lose the game simply because they wont abandon the run game unless theyre down like 21 points in the second half

most of the throws he makes are to wide open receivers that are wide open because defenses focus on the baltimore running game

it really is a terrific system by the ravens lamar would fail on about 27 other teams but the ravens did a great job accommodating for him

lamar is a great athlete just not a great qb
yall need to calm the fuck down he is i
in no way a shit qb hes atleast better than our backups
this is stupid immature and idiot fans post crap like this and think its funny or cool lamar jackson is a really good player who had a bad game and almost still beat us

be better than this ffs
top pass rush great linebackers bush is out but spillane is feastin just like greenlaw when kwon was out great run game good passing attack damn solid run d great coaching and management ngl i had you guys as surefire wildcards to start but now i am seeing probably the most loaded team in football keep it up

ps last year likewise to you we were 70 and people were saying we didnt play any real teams just keep rolling and zone out the haters 70 is 70
i think niners had a much better run game where as steelers have a better pass game
appreciate the kind words and the parallels from the niners 19 run didnt think of that before by the way big fan of kyle i love how he calls games and his run game my favorite running scheme in the game
oh this steelers team is a different animal my friend
i live in 49er territory so i saw them plenty last year the 49ers had a better run game but outside of kittle the steelers have a much better passing game

were on a collision course with kc for the afc crown
last year i read somewhere a post predicting exactly this the steelers could be the 49ers of 2020 im just happy we are not losing to crappy teams anymore
yep i see it too if we had your running game i dont think we could be stopped your runningbacks were nasty man
big ben jimmy g any day of the week and twice on sunday
sorry but jimmy g sucks lol
and the steelers nearly beat your 2019 49ers without big ben

ross perot for president

wut
weve always seemed to do well with no huddle type offenses i dont know why we dont run it more often
that one play empty set trips right with two to the left all three on the right were completely confused to what the playcall was and ben gave zero fucks he was throwing left regardless

and this tidbit makes that play a lot more believable
it is really funny how you never post unless you have something to rip tomlin andor the coaching staff with
ben says he was literally making up playcalls on the field in their muddlehuddle thing in the 2nd half

i know everybody says i do well in playground backyard football today it was in its truest form

ben was like fuck it someone gonna be open

buds gonna get paid
im so happy to see what buds become makes me miss the resident bud hater a little bit too

gonna suck to see him leave but that man deserves every cent going his way
that isnt how you are supposed to use semicolons
the guys a problem hes a problem
that is a hell of a tweet right there
still waiting for baldy to learn how to use obs


i found this video and analysis on twitter i couldnt find the original tweet so if the person is on this subreddit i apologize

better hope his grandpa dominic taught him how to take a bump bc he is gonna be taking more than a few on sunday
this guy went to pine richland so thats kinda cool
are we playing dinucci or will dalton be back
i love your choice for tomlins face
poor guy is fucked lmao
as a kid that went to cc and watched him tear us up in the wpials i hate the guy however it is pretty sweet to see a hometown kid being the starting qb in the nfl

they call him the stripper
he should be eligible to play in dallas right

zeke has the fumble bug between watt throwing haymakers on the ball and this guy being able to rip the ball out like that zekes gonna look like that poor girl getting bounced between will ferrell and chris kattan in night at the roxbury
looks like hell fit right in thanks again jets
thats some slick work
jets fan in rnfl saying his coverage is bad will be interesting to see how the rotation works
that goal line stand holy shit
how did he go from the titans to the jets was he traded released this guy looks like a beast
what role is he gonna play spillane has been good i mean i like the move and its always good to have depth but who sits guy looks like a ball hawk easy to see why tonkin likes him
i know its a highlight reel and supposed to only show baller plays but damn it gets me hyped for this pickup watchex it multiple times already im pumped for his disruption and turnover catalyst ability
heres a thought nfl darling heisman trophy winner reigning nfl mvp lamar jackson in just two games vs the stillers 11 has committed 7 turnovers
heres another

kaepernick had one and a half good seasons under greg roman running a college offense too

gimmick offenses have a short shelf life and little playoff success in the nfl the athletes and coaches are too good for that success to continue

i am absolutely delighted to have lamar jackson in the afc north for the foreseeable future he keeps the ravens ceiling nice and low
its beautiful

also i know the general rules but i get lost with technical terminology so a easy to digest content source would be appreciated

i have watched the highlights shows or the big match ups but what makes a team good apart from a qb that can throw and dudes that can catch how does a mediocre player differ from elite those little differences are lost on me and id like to know more ive watched afl and rugby all my life so thats my frame of reference but the sports are so different from each other
i recommend the pat mcafee show its on youtube sirius satellite will get you some humorous and factual takes on most of the top nfl stories they also do their own betting and predictions for games each week and a fair amount of inappropriate humor
second the pat mcafee show and of course watch games ive been a lifelong steeler fan and to this day there are moments where i learn something new about the nfl its a very bizarre sport and after decades watching you kinda feel like a lawyer citing precedent any time something wonky happens which is often

how does a mediocre player differ from elite

this is such a hard question to answer since its very position dependent and dependent on coaches but it boils down to execution and consistency the elite player does great things more frequently than the mediocre player that might seem dumb and obvious but its the best answer i can give

some guys are capable of freakish performances but youll never hear of them doing it again and then there are guys who do it every week

i mention coaching because players need to also be put in positions to succeed the miami dolphins did not use minkah fitzpatrick well trade him to the steelers and the dude has multiple ints returned for 6 in less than a year leveon bell was great on our team sucked behind the jets putrid offensive line

which then brings me to my last point its a team sport unlike any other a deficiency in one unit will absolutely affect the rest bad ol good luck throwing deep balls when your qb is in the dirt bad wrs good luck blocking on the outside to run the ball or converting clutch third downs bad dl no sacks for you bad rbs no winning time of possession your defense is going to get tired you lose

so a good team is a balanced one one whose weakest unit is still above average its hard to even say what our weakest unit is right now and thats the sign of a great team

arthur moats experience with deke and simfballcritic are both on youtube and great for steelers talk
the terrible podcast

i know i know someone doesnt like daves voice but most knowledgeable podcast imo
pat mcafee show


locked on steelers
i think its great that you stopped by i was in sydney for 2 weeks in november 2018 and was so surprised when i was able to watch the steelers game in my hotel room i also recommend the pat mcafee show hes great
nice man im south african with a major love for rugby union and the way i got into football properly was madden 07 the best one i have ever played imo and wikipedia i am by no means an expert but really understanding the formations and their functions was instrumental in understanding how players are used for me getting the 34 vs 43 and how the body shape and style of lbs changes due to each formation was a key point and then in the later maddens understanding the hilo reads etc to get how a play is developing was pretty great

i know some people may slate me for this opinion but honestly without it i wouldnt stay up to the middle of the night to watch the sport so it may be what youre looking for

we could win the next 10 consecutive super bowls and people will move the goal post 10 times
when the season is over we can tally up the wins vs winning record teams and loosing record and see how that looks
fact is people hate when youre better than them steeler nation
steelers total record of teams is better than chiefs seahawks ravens etc

steelers are also 5th in offensive ppg and 6th in defensive ppg
i was discussing with a friend yesterday we look at seahawks record and damn they are one of the best teams but the record is not as impressive as it looks falcons patriots cowboys vikings and 49ers dolphins seems to have a promissing future though the win aged well

i believe our two last wins make the record much more solid than theirs
my favorite new one is how analysts discredit our performance against a 52 baltimore squad and say that we got lucky because lamar is now suddenly overrated but then praise brady and the bucs after nearly losing to the 16 nyg
our effectiveness in the no huddle yesterday was startling compared to our ineffectiveness in the first half let ben cook a little early in the game to give our offense a spark letbencook
tomlin and fichtner hire this man
70 burn it down change everything fire tomlin sign kaepernick
i dont think it was the huddle that was causing ben to miss every single throw
also going five wide with 35 seconds on the play clock allows ben to do what he does best find the mismatch on the best wr group in the league and audible
whats up guys fellow yinzer here been a steeler fan since the day i was born still remember the dime thrown to hines ward from randelel like it was yesterday anyway i was wondering if you guys would be interested in an analysis of the steelers so far this year not necessarily breaking down each game and going through it per say but more of a look at how we have progressed from opening on monday night to the last game against the ravens and things like noticeable halftime adjustments stand out players whos underperforming relative to our expectations and as tomlin would say things of that nature im trying to dip my feet into the waters of scouting and figures doing things like this couldnt hurt so i was just wondering if yinz would be interested in it if i started posting these videos in the subreddit any feedback helps thanks
the sub is always looking for more content just dont be surprised to get some yinzers blowing up your comments if they disagree with you
all the tv sports pundits who think because you have the most yards and time of possession that shows youre weakness i fck you the steelers has 254 yards and do you know why because thats all they needed the main stat is the steelers had four more points than the ravens when the gun went off haters and doubters would be going nuts if pittsburgh lost to any of the teams they played so far it boggles the mind how nonsensical these experts perceive being undefeated this team won eight games without a qb and never gave up to my steelers i give much love 70 and the leaders of the pack

gorram cowboys
great job with this with our history of playing down to bad teams and probably missing 2 starting dlinemen against a good running back i am concerned

perfection

ill be in my bunk
im a zeke without a win watch me soar
could be a tomlin special but might be too early
hello fellow fans

i posted this deep in another thread regarding the terrible towel but i wanted to bring it front and center to get more opinion and see if we can get any traction having watched an excellent video on the history of renegade wouldnt it be fantastic for the steelers organization to make an app for fans attending road games to have a synchronized team managed official playing of renegade over everyones phones

obviously it wouldnt likely be heard on the sideline once fans are actually allowed in stadiums but the road fans would be going crazy together at the appropriate time and would hopefully be singing together in sync loud enough to be heard by our players it would have to work almost like a push notification on a signal sent by a steelers media manager to begin playing renegade when the app is running this would have been fantastic during either the fourthdown stand or the game ending pass defence

i just think it would be amazing for every fan running the app to be synched with renegade wherever they are

cheers from canada
i did send this idea into the steelerscom email contact form but have zero expectations of any sort of reply
why arent we funding this
i love this idea

sweet find
steelers beat the titans

titans lost to the bengals



steelers beat the ravens

ravens lost to chiefs

chiefs lost to raiders also browns lost to raiders

raiders lost to the patriots

patriots lost to the broncos



what im saying is the only team we are definitely better than is the jets and there are no good teams in the nfl to beat this year
its just the giants

its just the broncos

its just the texans

its just the eagles

its just the browns

its just the titans

its just the ravens you are here
yep nobody appalachian state could probably beat the steelers right now
the only team we are definitely better than is the jets

yeah but the jets beat us in week 16 last year lol
theres always next year i guess lets just hope the nfl gives us some tougher opponents
we were overrated by everyone 5 years ago when we had no defense dont matter to me the excuse now for tn and baltimore is well if not for this that or whatever theyd have won those games
watching other games theres really no one that good this year the steelers really do look like the best team obviously the chiefs are the biggest threat but everyone looks beatable i really like out chances this year
this is a classic trap game for the steelers right big win against the ravens now they play a down and out cowboys team that they play down to ugh
fifth game in a row third straight away game after back to back games against 2 of the top teams in the afc after a huge rivalry game is a possible upset for any team not just the steelers
you people will bitch about absolutely anything i passed a half dozen people who would be good enough to start on the 2020 cowboys between here and my mailbox this afternoon
bad bot
steelers football baby
i know we play down to bad teams but dallas is beyond bad right now i could however see cincy causing us fans some anxiety
from 2015 to 1018 tomlin and belichick have the same record when it comes to losing to bad teams so that should tell you that shit just happens sometimes any given sunday is saying for a reason
right now the cowboys remind me of last years steelers team except their defense is historically bad and ours was the best in the league dalton is kinda similar to rudolph and dinucci is practically their version of duck but not as good the only thing i worry about is hangover from playing a physical baltimore squad and giving up big plays like we did against miles sanders and aj brown since elliott and the dallas receivers do have that ability as well
come on dinucci he solves a lot of worries
bengals for me is our trap game i think we will do okay against the cowboys
looking through these comments i dont understand how people dont realize that the steelers are known for playing down and its not just me being a tomlin hater all 31 other fanbases and yinzers that arent complete homers including tomlin supporters know very well of steelers tradition until we can consistently play up to our ability against shit teams its gonna keep happening

just in time for the ravens lets goooo
looks like we dodged 2 bullets
best case ontario boys
oh lucky must be a minor sprain to be 2 weeks at most and definitely should not rush him back his health going into thanksgiving is the biggest factor right now compared to the next 3 games
so back for the ravens

allllright
bullshit i saw him do the stretchy test mcl tore clean off the bone i would know i have knees
take three just to be safe please
blessed
hallealualu
but the 33 team doctors in the post game thread said that alualu and heyward both had acl tears
fantastic news avoiding a major injury to himcam is huge
perfect timing get healthy for the stretch
fucking ravens games and the injuries they cause amirite
a win in baltimore and our injuries sustained are short term and we dont have too difficult of a short term schedule this is the way
great our next two matchups should be gimme wins
bros i can not fucking tell you how happy i a with this news were going for the fucking super bowl bitches
thank god i thought it was his mcl
i havent looked ahead at our schedule but hopefully he can recuperate during our bye week im sure everyone is more than a little banged up after the slog theyve been through recently
i have a friend whos dad passed away this morning and they want to bury him in a hines ward jersey i was wondering if anyone in the gta area has a xxl ward jersey they could possibly sell to me the service is on wednesday and i know its short notice but might as well try here as well thanks guys
yoooo check your pms i have a 2xl home and away im in toronto
you have my sympathies ive got an xl watt jersey in cobourg that you could have if nothing else comes in
i have an xl or xxl hines jersey but it is at my dads in mississippi i dont think it can make it there by the time he is buried but we can definitely send it your way as some kind of memorial
i just so happen to have a home one but its in peru so getting it up there on time is unlikely looks like someone else got your back my condolences for your homie
who are the toronto steelers

this is so surprising wtf
surprised more teams havent done it this year alone with how much scoring has increased this season i would not consider us anywhere near the top offenses this year
every time i read something like this it just feels like the internet is trying to jinx us
steelers need to change their offense and go to 5 wide using a back every play like new england did in 07

no one can stop them if we play nohuddle the entire game
should be no problem to put up 30 next week knock on wood right
it kills me to say this in a way but this team feels like a bill belichick patriots team no divas tomlin is using multiple rbs each game more than he has in the past ben getting rid of the ball fast no clear number 1 wr they just ride the hot hand and take what the d gives them significant players get hurt but they get major contributions from guys who most fans barely knew anything about in training camp hang close to 30 each game even if the stats dont seem to support it always come up with that go ahead drive just when it looks like theyre beat
werent we getting shit about not being able to put up enough points like last month lol
the seahawks also did it this year the thing is they lost one game
this team is astonishing how good they could actually be if they played a full 60min in all 3 phasesthey are the best team in the league and they havent put together a perfect game yet besides cleveland every game there has been some glaring quarter where a phase is actively trying to lose the game defense letting teams get back in when they are 23 scores back offense just being a 3 in out or turnover machine etcits great to see we legit havent even come close to hitting our ceilingi hope to see us hitting that next gear when the playoffs come like many sb winning teams do
they struggle badly at times but do give off an impression that when they really want to score or move the ball they do or can theres 4 wrs on the field at any given time who are capable of a splash play
i guess the reasons are
1 we dont give up drives that eat up the clock except for the ravens game since our d is great at stopping runs
2 our d gives the offense good field position
3 i think were pretty good in red zonedont have stats to back this up though
all 32 teams have scored 26 or more points in their first 7 games i think

this tweet is worded wrong it pisses me off that nobody has said something yet

"I really appreciate those of you are who willing to civilly discuss opinions about this. 

I'm going to continue to keep threads like this open for that exact reason above and to stay in line with the earlier announcement I made this year about sensitive topics in this sub. 

Unless your comment is completely devoid of anything that adds to the discussion it likely will stick around to receive the subs up/down votes."

Stay home and watch for free. Drinks are cheaper at home as well"
"What about me? I live in New Zealand...

jk we don't have bars to watch the NFL"
"A lot of these bars are being really responsible. I wouldn't say someone should *never* patronize a bar--just don't be stupid about it. If my wife and I go out to grab a drink, we just grab a table that's at outside and at a safe distance and be careful about it."
"ITT: A whole bunch of idiots that don’t realize they can infect other people by going to these bars. 

Good reminder OP"
"Ugh, I was going to respond to some comments on this post, but it would probably be like talking to a brick wall at this point. People, just continue to wear masks, social distance, and if you have to go to a bar, make sure it's outdoors."

"So true. I wish I was with each and every one of you cheering and cheersing. It's not the end of the world if you miss the game. Please be responsible. We can overcome this virus together.

Adapt, understand, overcome, thrive."
"1. Come into this thread.

2. Scroll down to the bottom.

3. Get depressed."
But not the protests though
I've just been having a bunch of people over to watch games. That way we don't even have to half-ass pretend to wear masks.
What’s your goal? Complete elimination of virus? As a healthy 24 yo guy who lives in a studio apartment why can’t I support my local bars? Let people live their lives and make their own choices.
How about people make their own choices?
"dude, positive rates are like 2%... no deaths. Wear a mask and be respectful and you'll be fine. Most places have outside seating as well."
"So I understand your argument that by going out to bars etc. people can become carriers even if they aren't sick themselves, and infect others. But if you aren't going out to bars or these other places yourself then how are you in any danger? If someone is that worried about becoming sick or contagious then they should be staying home, full stop.

The only argument I can see is that by going out to bars, you increase your likelihood of becoming contagious and infecting people at ""essential"" businesses that people need to visit. At that point though it seems like you're splitting hairs by telling people ""Walmart is ok to go to but fuck you for enjoying a meal at a restaurant."" I think your real issue should be with your local governments for allowing non-essential businesses to operate, not at the people visiting them within the rules set out by the governors.

I'll probably get downvoted but I'd be curious to hear others' thoughts."

"Question; which scenario is more likely to give you Covid? 

1. Going to Wal Mart
2. Going to watch football at a bar 

Reminder; Wal Mart has been open this entire pandemic... “bUt wALMart iS eSSeNTIal” nope you still run the risk of spreading it to others and getting it yourself. Life really does have risks, and what if a vaccine doesn’t come out until late next year? Please don’t tell me your plan is to sit at home all day until then and preach others should do the same? Nope, sorry that isn’t going to happen m8. 

I totally get wearing a mask and distancing sure. But come on, as long as we wear masks we really oughta be able to go to a fuckin bar man.

"Look what happens when you don’t get outcoached. It’s crazy that the patriots had so
many defense players traded, leave in free agency or opt-out but the coaching still helps them contain the chiefs that we couldn’t even stop on third down smh. I even think our defensive personnel is better but our coaching isn’t."
Look what happens when you just run the ball down KC’s throat instead of selling out for the air game after you go down a few points
"Very valid, and depressing, point lol. Refs just bailed them the fuck out tho"
"It’s the pass rushing. KC’s offense gets disrupted by it. Mahomes had all day against us which allowed all those deep routes to develop. We had absolutely zero pass rush and it’s a huge Achilles heel for us. You can say we abandoned the run and we did, but it wasn’t going to matter based on how easy our defense made it for their offense."
"yea was just having this conversation with my brothers l, we played horrible agaisnt chiefs and this pats game is proof."
"Thats not pass rush, thats good coverage. 

Our DBs got lit up. Mahomes was throwing to wide open receivers as soon as he got the ball."
"Absurd. For once I agree with Belichick 😂

Edit: *or an INT. Either way, should've been a turnover"
Mahomes now a confirmed golden boy. Two hand touch rules apply.
Yeah no more friendly gif wars with these bitches. The chiefs are the new patriots. Mahommes whines and complains more than Tom Fucking Brady
"That was an interception, these refs are trash"
"Definitely an int, he was throwing it away. Ironic seeing Brady calls go against the patriots"
"When you play KC you play the refs. Next time we face them, I want the ravens prepared knowing that absolutely nothing will go our way. No use complaining about it."
That was some BS!!
That was a bull call.
That was reallllllllly bad
"I hate the Patriots but yeah, that was bad. Literally everything goes Mahomes’ way."
"If you wanna be them, beat them. This sub is soooo preoccupied with the Chiefs!"
We should have looked just like the patriots. Running it down their throats and controlling the ball for the majority of the game. It’s not that hard apparently. 😢
Someone should show wink martindale this game as well.
Most likely wouldn't help because it has happened a couple times before last week's game. Ravens tend to be up on their opponents in most games and he clearly doesn't adjust well outside the original game plan.
The patriots pass rushers actually got home
26-10 Chiefs running the ball clearly worked wonders 🤔😑🤷‍♂️
"I said this so many times in the game thread, they dropped everyone into coverage and rushed three, it was super effective too."
""
For the life of me I cannot understand how Wink let Mahomes light us up.
God this game is pissing me off. The Chiefs run D is terrible. We should have slaughtered this team but we had horrible offensive and defensive game plans. Didn’t run the ball on offense and blitzed way too much on defense.
"They're doing what you have to do to contain the Chiefs - control the ToP with a strong running game and keep Mahomes off the field. For some reason in all of our losses we get spooked early, abandon our strengths, and try to compete in a shootout which Mahomes will win 100% of the time"
Horrid refs as expected.
Bill and McDaniels doing an amazing job against the chiefs so far. If they had Cam they’d be winning this game by a lot.
Hey look what happens when you run and commit to it? 17 runs and 16 passes
Holy shit I’m now more embarrassed our game against the chiefs.
They said Butker > Tucker lmfao
"I think this is showing us just how much creativity on defense matters vs the Chiefs. Mahomes will pick apart standard defenses.  Now, he’ll still probably turn it around this game but it shows how to contain that stacked offense, at least for a half"
Bill’s a genius
Why didn’t Stidham start the fucking game lol
That NE secondary is locking shit down god damn
"These refs... I mean wtf are they seeing... The dude had his hands on Mahomes while trying not to fall himself and gets a flag. 

Then* Kelsey slips and its PI... Wow"
Butker is definitely no Justin Tucker
This is a weird game for a Belichick coached team to be making huge mistakes left and right
"Hoyer just F'd up big time. Took a sack as time expired going into the 2nd half. Score is 6-3 with the Chiefs leading, Patriots could have at least tied it."
"Butler sucks lol

Edit.  Auto correct - Butker."
Butktner stinks
if the chiefs played like they are tonight against us we win by 20 🤷‍♂️
RIP to the Patriots hopes this game
Anything you see the patriots doing that we can do for future chiefs matchups?
"The Pats have managed to keep Mahomes off of the field and drive down the field with freaking Brian Hoyer for almost the entire 3rd quarter.


Edit. And Hoyer screws the Patriots again by getting sacked and now losing the ball when they had a chance to at the least tie the game."
"I love how they keep promoting the Falcons vs. The Packers.

Nobody is watching that game except their fans. Not with this game on lol"
You guys are watching the wrong game LOL only kidding
Hoyer may have as many passing yards as Lamar did. That sucks.
"The trick to playing Mahomes is to slow down the game, and if anything, we sped it up."
Romo cursed that kicker lol
"Well, it's nice to see Patriots fans sad at least."
"I think I found the loophole to beat the Chiefs: You need to catch them off guard with a QB that has no (or next to no) NFL game tape.

So obviously, the next time the Ravens play the Chiefs, they need to unleash Trace McSorley and announce him as the starter moments before kickoff...

(Seriously, though; you've got to keep running the football, chew the clock and leave Kansas City's offense on the sideline. Easier said than done, however. Even when the Chiefs make a mistake, they seem unfazed by it and pick things right back up as if nothing happened.)"
Fuck the refs
I want the pats defense so bad
"Mahomes is not as on as he was last week, but damn. I think we may be overestimating where the Ravens are right now. They’re not what they were last year. Not yet at least."
It’s all about coaching. Harbs is the issue.
""
Im pretty sure we also just arent good at scheming our wrs into space.
Hill works the way he does because this chiefs offense has so many threats you have to worry about and respect equally to the point where gadget plays like the chiefs run with him and hardman are almost impossible to predict are coming
"Because he's almost always double covered, defenses commit a lot more attention to him because we have no other threats except Andrews"
Because the chiefs have so many weapons that can also make big plays. If we get behind and Roman forgets to run the ball defenses just have to cover MAndrews and Brown and we got nobody else to make big plays.
Andy Reid >x1000 G-Ro.
Im not even asking for anything that fancy just try to get hollywood on more drags and slants simple stuff.
"Hill reminds me more of a young Steve Smith Sr. in terms of playing style. Fights for the 50/50 ball. Contests deep balls. Fiery. 

Hollywood cringes and falls down at even a hint of contact. I'm a shameless Ravens homer but this team cannot scout, draft, and develop WRs. They just can't and I dont know why. Hollywood is not looking like a WR1 so far. He is undersized but more importantly he plays undersized. Hill is undersized too but he doesnt play like it."
Brown isn’t Hill. Lamar isn’t Mahomes
"Why don't we use ~~Brown~~ **Duvernay** the way KC uses Hill? I know Brown isn't Hill yet but his speed makes him a threat and they use him in so many different spots for distraction.

*FTFY*"
Because he’s not Hill and for that matter the Ravens aren’t the Chiefs.
Because Roman doesnt know what he has...
"Because teams can double Brown and shut down our entire offense. Assuming Andrews is also focused in on, who's gonna be the big threat? Snead? Boykin?

You double up Hill, and you leave Watkins and Hardman 1-on-1. You're gonna have a bad time."
Am I the only one who thinks hollywood isn't that fast?  Hill is on another level.
" Brown has magnet hands. Granted, some drops and plays didnt go his way but that's expected. He's money I hope he his proud of what he is and has accomplished. Rock on Marble."
""
Tucker is so consistent that he is forgotten. Lol
"I said it last week, and I'll say it again

RESPECT. THE. GOAT!"
"I remember when Greg Zurlein was the best kicker, then when Dan Bailey was, then when Chris Boswell was. All the meanwhile Tucker was better than all of them. Really says a lot when kickers peak seasons are pretty much on par with Tuckers average seasons."
Third game in a row with a missed kick! I wonder what that’s like?
"This game is pissing me off. Chiefs either crush their opponent, or play like shit and get the game handed to them. Never in between. Mahomes should have been picked off twice this game and of course the fumble."
Thinks he’s hot shit cuz he’s playing for the chiefs
Best kicker!
"If you take a shot at the GOAT, you best not miss."
He actually seems below average.
"tHe nFl'S gReAtEsT kIcKeR 😂😂😂

Justin Tucker: Is this your king?"
butt kicker
"Chiefs fans need to shut up about him being the best kicker. Also, when did Mahomes throw a TD? I thought they were both rushing TDs."
Tuck doesn't care if the talking heads see him as the best. He knows who he is and what he can do. That's all that matters. Let em talk if it makes them feel better.
"Oh and then the dumbass MNF crew was saying there is no one better than Mason Crosby kicking 40 yards (can't remember exact quote). I was like, do you not remember him missing 5 kicks in one game a couple years ago???"
#HE ISN’T ON LEGATRON’S LEVEL.
"Man fuck Tony Romo. Hes god and clarvoiant when he gets something right, he needs to be called out when he says dumb shit like this"
We don’t need a chiefs kicker running commentary ....
What’s the deal with this? And what I mean is... who cares?
Yeah I don't know what the hell you guys did to him. He was coming right off of the best game he's ever had and then the second we play you guys he turns into a Bears kicker.
chiefs won another one
""
Judon got all Suggs and ZaDarius's clean up sacks
Watching him win one on one pass rushes and get to quarterback is frustrating. I don't have confidence that anyone on our team can do that in a consistent basis right now.
"Yeah, but he was only so-so in his time in Baltimore. Either GB knows how to scheme him better, or he’s a rare case of an overpaid free agent living up to his contract. 

 But you’re not wrong. He’s become a beast."
I think he'd be one of my all time favorite Ravens if he was still on the team.
Ravens picked Judon over him essentially. Hindsight is 20/20 but would love to have Zadarius rn
Another sack
"As a WFT fan, I feel the exact same way about Preston Smith. He was decent with us, 5-8 sack a year guy, pretty good pressure rates across from Kerrigan. Goes to GB along w Za’Darius and starts balling tf out. Obviously I love our ends now, but makes you think there’s a reason why these guys were decent and both became nice after getting overpaid"
I'm glad we have zadarius smith however 🧀
""
I feel like Belichick would like Trace McSorley.
RGIII for sure would remember that you don’t get 4 timeouts in a half
Please no. I want Robert to have the chance to woo some mofos again but I just really enjoy him as a raven. Does that make me selfish?

I no longer hate Brady. I find the Bucs fascinating now. Mahomes and the chiefs are my new hate team.
"Absolutely not. Flopping is totally subjective. Knowing how incompetent these refs are, this just gives them more ways to ruin the outcome of games. 

I'll pass."
"As much as I want to say yes, subjective calls like that piss all of us off far too often.  We really don't need to add more subjective calls."
"That was literally like watching Neymar. It should definitely be a penalty and carding people for flops in soccer hasn’t been a perfect fix but it has helped.

Also, the refs will fuck up no matter what."

"Hate to say it but our loss was worse. Pats got screwed by the refs with that Mahomes interception. They also were playing with a back up QB.



That being said I really hope Wink was taking notes on how the Pats absolutely shut down KC for the first half."
This game was way closer than what ever the hell we did.
"QB play hurt the Pats. The game plan was perfect. Also, the refs blew some calls, too!"
This is wrong but ok.

"You still have time to delete this, before the morning crowd pours in."
Comment your score predictions
No predictions but Burrow is throwing 300 yards with a terrible O line. This is not an easy game on Sunday.
Lamar is gonna come in heated. 400 yards of offense from him alone. Burrow will start hot but start to fall apart in the second half. Ravens 38 bungles 24.
"We are going to be shocked that this is going to be a close game. Burrow is not flustered by blitzes and is accurate as hell. He is going to habe a career day against us. If Bengals didnt have an awfully slow and undisciplined defense I would be extremely worried.


I will be downvoted to hell saying this but Burrow will be on Mahomes level in a few years."
"Ravens 41 Bengals 20

The Bengals are building something nice. Their qb is smart and continues to improve. I just think the Bengals will be overwhelmed just like the Texans were. 

I think our offense will have a big day. I also think our DL will take over and smoke their OL."
Lamar gonna put up 50.
"Bengals fan here, it's not even going to be a competition. Lamar is going to run all over us, this defense is BAD."
AJ Green back lol. This should be fun.
[deleted]
Make burrow escape the pocket the direction you want him too...smack him with queen when he thought he was safe. I wish him best of luck but 3 picks and a fumble would be nice.
"This is gonna be a tough game Burrow is really good despite his offensive line.  Sure there defense is trash, but we still have to stop there offense.  Also even though AJ Green has disappeared this season thus far he always shows up to play vs us."
We might not like to hear this but the run game is our best defense. Our actual defense is trash. Hopefully the run game shows up on Sunday if not they're just going to screen pass us to death.

trace mcsorley better be #2
Somehow Justin Tucker is underrated... smh
"So ... I was curious, and looked up the stats:

Tucker inside 50: 234 / 245 == **95.51%**

Crosby inside 50: 301 / 347 == **86.74%**

Also, for fun --

Tucker has had an overall FG% above 90% for **5 out of 8 years**

Crosby has had an overall FG% above 90% for **1 out of 13 years** (last year)

I will admit that Crosby is apparently ""better"" than Tucker on FG under 20. He's 9/9 and Tucker has never attempted one in the NFL."
"Packer fan here, that was bogus. Everyone knows that Tucker is the GOAT."
I was waiting for the post. I will say it took longer than expected.
"I literally yelled at my husband when the announcer said that and he was like, ‘I didn’t say it!’"
"Espn has turned into straight trash.  Every time the announcer spoke, they said something dumb.  They are just another generic cable news network with commentators who say what they are told to say rather than commentate on the game."
Everyones forgotten JT... Somehow? Weird stuff.
"I guess that means Harrison Butker is the best 50+   

&#x200B;

/s"
"I feel like all commentators have to give these outrageous superlatives that are essentially meaningless. 

I also can’t stand when they say “as good as anyone else in the league” to mean they’re a highly skilled player. No, if they’re only as good as anyone else, they’re just average."
I remember Crosby missing 5 kicks in one game a few years back.
"He literally missed an extra point earlier in the game when the announcer said this.  Last I checked, an extra point is inside of 50..."
"Aw shit. Here we go again.

I remember the first field goal Tucker ever missed. Im pretty sure it was 60+ yards in the rain...and I was like “yup. Ain’t even mad.”"
Crosby gonna miss a fg and two XPs the next two games probably now.
Crosby is good but you guys have the better kicker.
"You know these guys are paid for being contrarian right? Hot takes equal clicks. No one who really follows football will say anyone other than JT is the goat. It’s the Weather Channel syndrome, every storm is the best (worst) until it isn’t. Every kicker is amazing until he is not. But who cares because we have Tucker."
Aye let them say others are better. It doesn't matter. We know. Bmore knows. Tucker knows. Talk that talk league. Tucker walks that walk. Easy claps tuck td catch division championship game...from Koch.
The hot takes on kickers this year haven't aged well. These announcers are absolutely lost.
THE DISRESPECT THIS MAN FACES!!!!!!!! WEEKLY!!!!!!!!
Big Tucc no lil Tucc
The disrespect to Tucker is real.
"I keep seeing people post this stuff, but let's be honest, the commentators are paid to comment on ""that"" game and the players playing ""that"" game.  They aren't really throwing shade at Justin Tucker, they are just trying to complement a kicker that is doing well in the game they are commenting on.

EDIT:  Also, people missed the fact that the commenters on the Chiefs - Patriots game talked about how Butker has been missing extra points.  So at least give them credit when they are critical as well."
We won but it will get tougher as the season goes on. I don’t want to brag as it’s a long season. I predict though we will see you in the Super Bowl. You guys might have to buy us tickets. We might be watching you guys LOL. We played great but offense stalled in 2nd half. Love you Raven nation.
"Good shit man, you may have gotten Dan Quinn fired too. We miss Z."
Love you bro. You’re one of the reasons I drafted Aaron Jones and Rodgers on my Fantasy teams and they put on heroic performances and carried me for the win. Looking forward to watching y’all after the bye.
Are you in the RSR board?
"Meh. You didn't even let the Falcons blow another one, where's the fun in that?

"1. Aaron Rodgers (He’s a baaaaaaaaaaaaddddddd man)

2. Russel Wilson (Mr. Unlimited)

3. Patrick Mahomes (Ravens Killer)

4. Josh Allen (Bills Mafia Messiah) 

5. Action “you can’t catch me” Jackson (Big Truzz) 

Let me know your thoughts! In case anyone is wondering, I’d probably have Dak at 6. 

***Wow I just realized this almost matches the nfl.com index. Oops. I didn’t cheat I swear 😅"
Patrick kills all.. no need to single out that charming city.
"Mahomes is the NFL killer, AJ Green is the Ravens killer."
I think all these players are right and Jackson is at 5 rn. I can see 1/2 being swapped and Josh Allen as high as 2 as well.
"I was going to quibble with you about Dak at 6 but he's got a good case. Maybe Tannehill? Minshew seems to be cooling off somewhat. Kyler hasn't taken that leap yet. 

The old guard of good-not-great QBs that you'd usually find the 6-10 range like Matt Ryan, Matt Stafford, Kirk Cousins and Philip Rivers have totally cratered and are clearing out room for new faces, which is pretty refreshing if you ask me."
Tied with Rodgers is Lamar for 1st place.
Anyone who was calling for harbaugh to be fired is reeeeaaally keeping their mouth shut now lmao
"BoB was the worst GM man.  He destroyed that franchise in 2 years as the GM. 


As a coach he was ok.  He did take that team to 4 division titles."
Rumor has it after that 4th and 12 Harbaugh was gonna get fired but Lamar saved his job the year after
"The history of this team is incredible. Highs. Lows. Miracles. Heartbreak. Resilient AF. Through it all, the ownership and leadership has never broke. Stronger than steel, tougher than tigers. More prestigious than a ups box. Every part of the ravens organization, from top to bottom, is superior to all others. Quit your bitching. Win or lose, Bmore is where I chose."
I’d have to imagine they considered firing harbs at some point
"We have always been a well ran organization, just had some bad picks combined with bad luck for a couple years. The shit organizations continuously make bad hires, overpay  signings, and draft picks."
We were never 0-4 without our first and second round pick bad though. The Texans are an embarrassment no way around it.
"Yea I thought it was ridiculous that anyone wanted to let him go. I know we had some disappointing seasons leading up to that, but the team was just not that talented from 2015-2017 and Harbaugh kept them competitive anyway. We had no difference makers on offense besides old Steve Smith and some of those defenses were weak sauce. Ozzie gave Harbaugh one last gift with our 2018 draft class and that was all he needed to get back to being a perennial playoff contender. I did not want us to end up on the Jets, Giants, Browns coaching carousel."
We almost had Garrett (the clapper). Remember that.

"Mosley ended up on IR last year after playing just two games, and this year he opted out for Covid-19 reasons. 

$85 Million dollars. 

There's no telling what would have happened if we kept him, maybe he would even be playing this year. So far it is looking like letting him get overpaid somewhere else was a good idea. Especially with Queen looking good."
"the jets could trade him after June 1 next season for minimal dead cap. Him and Queen would be an unfair LB duo.

&#x200B;

BABY COME BACK"
Well the jets are cursed tho he probably wouldn’t have gotten injured here
I think you guys will be prepared more the 2nd time around when you play KC.
"I like queen. He plays as advertised. Hes faster than mosely and hes pretty good in coverage for a rookie. He still has some time before hes great in coverage but for now, worth every bit of his draft spot."
"Jets can't even get free of that deal until 2022 at the earliest. At least his cap # is less next year when the cap drops

Afterwards though? $18M/yr is a big yikes."
"I'm loving Queen so far, I would opt out too if I were on the Jets lol"
It’s like when you join the Jets you get this virus that strips away  your health and talent.  Look at Le’veon  Bell. Now it’s happened to Mosley.  It’s a shame because I’ve always considered him a top tier Mike.
"He’s a genius took a year off to heal, knowing he’d come back with a new/better coaching staff!"
"Yeah but Queen is turning into Mosley. 

Looks exceptionally in the run and his pass protection is sus 

I get he’s a rookie and coverage is the hardest part so I’m not shitting on him yet. But we’ll see how he progresses."
I love Mosley but he would let tight ends burn him.
"Well, they arent paying him this year, so his salary is a moot point."
"Sadly, not matching the Jets’ offer was one of the best decision we made in a while, but yea, if he could come back, for the right price, that would be a smooth move!!!"
"We will treat you better, come back to Mama"
"I cant upvote this because I love Mosely lol

But God Damn DeCosta matrix dodging bullets"
"It is hard to put the injury and his decision this year as a reason it was wise not to sign him.  If we resigned him, he may never have gotten injured.  Also he might very well have decided to play this year if he was on the Ravens.  Think about it, if you get a free pass for a year not to play, no real questions asked, would you want to risk another injury to play for the Jets?  I don't really agree with that kind of decision, but I can understand it."
Not even 2 full games btw.
To be fair the jets aren’t paying him this season anyways
"Queen is looking nice, but if we still had Mosely we wouldn't be getting reamed on screens.  He was legit probably the best in the league at sniffing out screens and getting tackles for a loss or minimum gain."
I miss hearing Gerry say his name on 98 Rock’s game broadcasts. 😥
Highway robbery
"sell high, buy low"
What?  Who wouldn't want to play for the Jets?
Elite dragon bout to match %50 of CJs starts. Hope Flacco can launch a few to Perriman like the good old days........
CJ was a good Raven but he's gone now and will stay that way. We dodged a bullet not getting suckered into a bidding war with Maccagnan. He's breaking down and no guarantee he'll ever be his old self. In with the new.
"Not tagging Mosley was probably EDCs first real mistake. If we had great LB play last year then our defense would have been unfair, and maybe we could have worked out a long term deal before the Jets could make a ridiculous offer."
ok and ILB is a major problem for us right now. Did anyone predict a player who missed 3 games with Baltimore to have a season ending injury followed by opting out of a season because of a pandemic?

I would like to buy Ravens jersey and I wonder what is the difference between this one (Speed Machine) from official Ravens shop [https://shop.baltimoreravens.com/mens-nike-lamar-jackson-purple-baltimore-ravens-speed-machine-limited-jersey/p-14346212427931+z-9527-2877589711?\_ref=p-DLP%3Am-GRID%3Ai-r4c0%3Apo-12&fbclid=IwAR1eWBf-B\_YJzgY4r\_3O1uBCB7J99DAm3WsBtn2VhT7OKIs5CEmXMugPxSY](https://shop.baltimoreravens.com/mens-nike-lamar-jackson-purple-baltimore-ravens-speed-machine-limited-jersey/p-14346212427931+z-9527-2877589711?_ref=p-DLP%3Am-GRID%3Ai-r4c0%3Apo-12&fbclid=IwAR1eWBf-B_YJzgY4r_3O1uBCB7J99DAm3WsBtn2VhT7OKIs5CEmXMugPxSY) and this one (Vapor Untouchable) from Nike shop [https://www.nike.com/t/baltimore-ravens-vapor-untouchable-lamar-jackson-mens-limited-football-jersey-S5xzdb/FA2032NMBLL-BR5](https://www.nike.com/t/baltimore-ravens-vapor-untouchable-lamar-jackson-mens-limited-football-jersey-S5xzdb/FA2032NMBLL-BR5). They looks same to me. Is there any difference?
"Well, I dunno why Nike has that listed incorrectly upon their own website, but those are the exact same style of jersey cut pictured (both being 'Speed Machine'). To avoid any confusion/mix-ups, I would stick with Fanatics/NFL Shop/Fan's Edge/Baltimore Ravens Shop whenever feasible — all operate under the same Fanatics umbrella, with everything being sent from their outlet located in Jacksonville, Florida — especially since they frequently tend to run plenty of various sales!

The only time that the Ravens utilize the Nike 'Vapor Untouchable' template on-field — and therefore, also the only versions of said style available to the fans — is when they wear the 'Color Rush' uniform set. In fact, the 'Vapor Untouchable' cut was first introduced for all NFL franchises' 'Color Rush' jerseys. However, most teams have since made the switch full time to the 'Vapor Untouchable' template for all of their primary & alternate jereys.

For whatever reason, Baltimore has not made the changeover from the 'Speed Machine' style for their primary purple, road white & alternate black jerseys. An additional note from experience: If you ever do decide to purchase a 'Color Rush' jersey — which are of course only available via the 'Vapor Untouchable' template (if purchasing 'Limited' version that is) — then I definitely recommend ordering one size up if plausible, as they are cut noticeably tighter/smaller for a more snug fit than the 'Speed Machine' versions.

The 'Vapor Untouchable' fabric materials are also sewn together in a much differently constructed manner. For instance (particularly in person), one can immediately recognize the three seams down the back of the jersey, including underneath the center of the numerals. Said seams almost appear to be sort of a modified Peace sign — or rather, like an upside-down 'Y'.

&#x200B;

P.S. Just for further clarification, the above comparative information is based solely on the 'Limited' ($150) style, since that is what you linked, thus presumably where your vested interest currently lies. I own two separate 'Color Rush' versions of Lamar Jackson: 'Game' ($100) & 'Limited' ($150). The 'Game' version is actually sold solely in 'Speed Machine' style (with heat-sealed graphics), despite being a 'Color Rush' jersey, whereas the 'Limited' & 'Elite' aka authentic styles are hemmed/sewn/stitched similarly to how they are worn by the players during actual games.

In other words, when it comes to those two more expensive styles, the part about the seams on the back is as I had previously described. Admittedly, I have never bothered with the other two cheaper (below 'Game' price) versions that they deem 'Pro Line' & 'Legend', respectively. Granted, I have heard almost nothing besides negative reviews regarding 'Legend' style, such as that it is essentially an overpriced t-shirt version of a jersey, but simply presented as a not-as-pricey alternative option to the others. I hope all of this has been helpful for your considerations!"

Clearly
"People seem split on doom and gloom this team is horrible, or we're the best team ever stop trying to coach from your couch. The bottom line is we're an extremely talented team that hasn't seemed to click on all cylinders yet, and we're 3-1 with 3 blowout wins. We were embarrassed and humbled by one of the greatest offenses in NFL history. It happens. Let's go through the positions.

Quarterback- B

So far Lamar has had a great game, a good game, a pretty ok game, and a bad game. It's definitely not entirely his fault, but we'll get into the other positions later. For some reason, maybe it's Harbaugh, or GRo, or maybe Lamar himself, but it almost looks like he's containing himself to the pocket unnecessarily. I can think of two reasons for this. One, we're trying to prove that Lamar can be an amazing passer. If this is the reason, it needs to stop. We know Lamar can throw, but the more he does with his legs, the more dangerous he becomes with his arm. Two, in a season with a limited training camp, injuries are popping up like daisies, so we're playing to protect him. I don't think this is the case as Lamar is very good at avoiding bad hits, but either way, we need to unleash the beast. Also, once he starts hooking up more consistently with Hollywood on the deep balls it will open up a lot for this offense. It's just a matter of time.

Runningbacks- B

The running backs have been solid, but asides from the Houston game, not amazing. The main thing bothering me is the scheming and playcalling, which obviously isn't their fault. We have a loaded backfield, why aren't we using it to its full potential? I don't even mean the ""we need to just run the ball more"" narrative. Running back is a position you need to get hot, and we sub so much that it makes it difficult to do so. Why not run a 2 RB set with Ingram and Dobbins? The possibilities are endless, and you have two of our best players on the field. The golden rule of offense is get the ball in your playmakers' hands. We can't do that if they're on the sideline. Like seriously, think of everything we could do with that set. It's crazy.

Wide Receivers- C

Hollywood is the bright spot here. He runs good routes, finds open space, and is reliable. Him and Lamar are just a tick off, but I'm not worried about that. Boykin does not run good routes. He does not play to his size. He's an amazing run blocker, but that's a secondary concern for wide receivers. We need players to reliably get open to move the chains, and help when we're down multiple scores. I'd like to see more Duvernay out there with Hollywood. Speed kills. Just watch Kansas City. I like Snead but he doesn't get the ball too often. We desperately need a true possession WR1.

Tight End- A-

Probably a higher grade than deserved at this point, but at the end of the day, Andrews had a bad game. He's still a great tight end and Lamar's go to(though Hollywood is sneaking in there). Boyle is underrated. It's a good group. I miss the 3 TE sets but I still think it was a good trade, as long as Dobbins is actually used to his full potential.

O Line- C+

Yanda is missed, though I did see improvement last game. In their defense, KC knew we were passing most of the game, which leaves Clark to focus on blitzing every down. Once they get more playtime together and are healthy, this grade should go up.

D-Line- B

I think this is another case of just needing more playtime together to be able to generate more pressure. The starters are all also on the wrong side of 30. After Cleveland, the run defense has been top tier.

Cornerback- A+

Losing Tavon stings (especially if you look at his contract), but it doesn't matter. They still get A+. Marlon is the best in the league, change my mind. Peters has also been incredible(besides maybe that KC game). Averett has honestly been a pleasant surprise so far. One of these years Tavon will stay healthy and this secondary will be god tier.

Inside LB- B

Fort has been very strong, not much to report here. Queen is playing like a talented rookie. He makes mistakes, but he generally does more good than harm. Pass coverage will get better, he didn't have a full training camp or any preseason to work with, and NFL speed is much higher than NCAA. Harrison is also pretty much playing the par for what I expected. He bites and gets fooled easily. I'm ignoring the KC game for both of them as that's not fair at all at this point in their career. Board sucks tho.

Outside LB- C

Judon is overpaid but also the scheming has been kind of weird. I think Wink sometimes outsmarts himself. Against KC, Judon was covering wide receivers. I get being creative and trying to fool a good offense, but sometimes you just have to rush your best rusher and hope he makes plays. With that said, I'm open to a Judon trade, as he only seems to get to the QB if he's untouched. I want to see more Ferguson. Bowser seems to be getting to the pocket but can't finish. McPhee has been relatively quiet. Let Sack Daddy in.

Safety- B-

Not necessarily bad, but nothing great here either. DeShon is basically a rookie with the amount of playtime he has. Clark has been solid(the FF against the Chiefs was great), but I'd like to see more.

Wolfpack- God Tier

No words I can think of are worthy of the wolfpack.

TLDR:

I think some adjustments to scheming on both offense and defense would help a lot. But we're still 3-1. The amount of raw talent on this team is ridiculous, which gives us a chance every game, or allows us to blow opponents up even when we don't look great."
I just felt deflated after being beaten by the chiefs AGAIN
"The staff needs to realize that Edwards in the answer at RB. He runs like Zeke Elliot, and we shouldn't dump to the RB anyways. Or should I say it feels like we rarely do. If Gus can get 6 ypc, let him eat!"
Kicker - A+++++++++++++
i don’t know about Lamar and the DLine having the same grade
"I don't know anyone that is talking about doom and gloom.  I think people are rightfully critical of the overall performance and pointing out how it won't be enough to win a SB, which has been the constantly talked about goal for the Ravens, ""by"" the Ravens, for the past 2 years.

Quaterback - B+

It is the defenses that are containing Lamar in the pocket.  They have been spying the outside and trying to keep him in the pocket.  You can notice when he does get out to scramble there are almost always guys on the outside waiting for him.  When watching a number of those games and plays, he is actually better off stepping up into the pocket.  So that is an adjustment he is making.  His passing is a bit better this year, even on the passes that seem to be off.  If you watch a number of those are placed precisely so the defense can't make a play on the ball, but it also unfortunately makes it a difficult catch for the WR.  Defenses are watching the sides to contain Lamar and getting into passing lanes to prevent big plays.  The Ravens haven't done a good job of changing their scheme to take advantage more of zone defense.  Lamar also needs to do a better job of taking what the defenses are giving rather than trying to make the big play all the time.  He also had this issue last year, but at least the Ravens had a much more powerful rush attack to rely on.

Running Backs - B+

You are right on the scheme, but not necessarily the answer.  The Ravens switched up from their scheme last year of loading up with TEs and trying to go to more wide sets.  They are trying to evolve the PB to include more passing, specifically to help address the problem of falling behind in games.  They don't have the same heavy blocking personnel they had last year, so the run game has definitely taken a hit.  The point of bringing in a fresh guy like Dobbins was to try and utilize a bit more flexibility and elusiveness rather than straight raw power, mainly because they knew they weren't going to have the same blocking capability.  The running game is actually third in the league and averaging 5.4 ypc, why aren't they using them more?

Ultimately I think the Ravens just haven't been running enough.  I feel this is a consistent problem for the Ravens where they try to ""out coach"" other teams rather than just playing their own game.  I mean, why didn't they run more against the Chiefs?  It just doesn't make sense some of the decisions they try to make.  The Chiefs were soft in the middle of the dline almost all game specifically because they were on a mission to contain Lamar.  

Wide Receivers - ?

I think you are ""slightly"" too critical on Boykin.  I have actually seen him get open a number of times, but he wasn't the target on the play.  They have used him mainly for blocking and quick short throws.  He is more of a deep threat, but hasn't been used as much for that.  He is already close to his targets and receptions from last year.  It seems this year more teams are clued in on who the Ravens targets are on plays.  The Chiefs especially had their number and almost knew what the Ravens were doing before they even called the play.  I agree that a true possession receiver would be good, but that is mainly what Andrews and Snead are supposed to be in this offense.  

Also it seems the Ravens are starting to move toward quicker passes and I think they are going to be using Duvernay more to try and take a bit more pressure off of Lamar and the run game.  Part of this I believe is also Lamar's fault with consistently trying to push the ball downfield instead of taking what the defense gives.  Part of this is what we love about him when we see beautiful passes to Brown or Andrews, but is also what other teams are cluing on when they contain him in the backfield.

Overall it is hard to grade the WR group.  I am not convinced the issue is purely the receivers.  I think a lot has to do with scheme and a bit with Lamar trying to hard for big plays.

Tight End - C+

Here I think you are being generous.  I wouldn't grade the TE group that highly.  I also think this is a case where the Ravens decided to only keep 2 known solid quantities and are suffering because of it.  Their 3 TE sets last year were a huge part of the success of the offense and we are seriously missing that advantage this year.  Andrews has had a few issues this year with some drops at crucial moments.  Overall I think this also comes down to scheme and how they are using the TEs this year.  Just another note, but Andrews has very similar stats to...Hayden Hurst, who we traded away.

Oline - B

Agree pretty much with this although I would give them a slightly higher grade.  I think they are solid, but clearly not the same dominant unit as last year.  Also, we aren't using the TEs quite as much to help bolster the blocking.  Also many times Lamar is getting stopped in the backfield specifically because he is scrambling out of a mostly clean pocket.  He isn't doing his oline favors when he does that.  Last year we had more flexibility because there was more experience on the oline and more TEs to help out.  This year Team's are focusing on the outside waiting for Lamar to scramble out.

Dline - C+

I mean there is no easy way to say this, but our Dline is not playing to their potential.  We are asking far too much of Calais out there and he is playing well, but at his age, he shouldn't be asked to cover so much of the field.  While the rush defense is doing pretty well, the dline isn't getting enough pressure in the passing game.  

ILB - B-

Fort has played well situationally, and Queen has been getting a lot of tackles, but that hasn't been keeping teams off the field.  What isn't being done is making enough plays in the passing game.  There is a severe problem with LBs in their coverage this year, and that is mainly due to inexperience.  

OLB - D

I am tempted to give this an F.  There is no easy way to say this, but the OLBs have been terrible.  They aren't getting pressure fast enough, and they aren't containing the outside well enough.  They are consistently getting fooled with screens and quick passes which are gashing our defense to death.  They are telegraphing everything they do.  Its just bad...all bad.  I don't really have anything good to say about the OLBs right now.

CB - B

I mean you can't really give the CBs an A when the Ravens have one of the worst passing defense in the league.  I think you are giving them way too much credit based on reputation alone.  I don't really think the coverage problems are the fault of the CBs, but I just can't grade them higher when they are a bottom 10 passing defense.  Humphrey is really good, but Peters hasn't been as good this year.  A lot of this has to do with needing to cover up for the OLBs and the safeties.  But the CBs need to shoulder some of the blame here as well.  

Safety  - C

I don't know what can really be said about the safeties.  There was so much hype for Elliott starting and for Chuck Clark after last season.  But they just haven't been living up to the hype.  Bottom 10 pass defense.  A lot of that rests on the shoulders of the safeties.  Chuck has been solid, but Elliott has been a liability, especially in coverage.  This is the reason we are seeing more of Jimmy at the safety spot.  Elliott is just not performing up to expectations.

I mean let's be honest, the Ravens defense has not been as dominant as they were billed to be this year.  You can't call yourself a dominant defense and be bottom 10 in pass defense in this league.  The coverage and play recognition has not been good for this defense.  And it is going to be more and more evident when we play pass heavy teams."
"I'm deeply concerned concerned about our pass rush.

I'm mildly concerned about our running game."
Not excited about the team this year. We need to prove that we can win from behind and not completely fall apart in the games that matter most before I can feel good about them again.
"I think the run game grade is a little generous, it still needs a little love this season in comparison to some other teams effectively running the ball for chunk gains especially if you take Lamar out of the equation"
"Disagree about our receivers - I think they're better than you think. Guys are getting open, but Lamar was super flustered in that Chiefs game. His worst game as a pro by far. Other than that, our pass game has been very very good on a per attempt basis. Also disagree hard about one of your points about Lamar - his passing from outside the pocket has been significantly better than it was last year, which is exciting. The first TD throw to Andrews on Sunday was more impressive than any throw on the run he has made in his career to date.

I don't see a huge point in ranking our position groups. This is a great football team. I still think we're the second best team in the league, but we're inarguably top 5. Last year was always going to be impossible to replicate. The Ravens were the best team in the league in the regular season by a mile. Not necessarily one of the best in NFL history, but we were the type of dominant team that comes along 3-4 times per decade. Expecting something similar this season was not realistic.

Look at where we were after Week 4 last year. 2-2 with hints of locker room drama, coming off an absolute shellacking by a divisional rival at home. This year, we have been smoked once, but we got smoked by the super-prepared defending Super Bowl champions that played their absolute A-game.

I'm slightly concerned about the pass rush. I don't think it's solvable with a Clay Matthews or Ziggy Ansah signing because those guys aren't better than what we have, they're probably about the same (though I would be open to bringing one in if someone gets hurt). And DeCosta won't mortgage our future to trade for a Melvin Ingram. We're going to have to keep creating pressure with numbers and scheme and trusting our secondary, but it's definitely concerning that we struggled to create pressure against KC even though we kept blitzing.

I think the biggest problem is just that if the Chiefs stay healthy and play their A game, it's going to be VERY VERY difficult to beat them. We'll have to play our A game AND have a few bounces go our way to pull that one out. Might need one of those Calais tipped balls to turn into an interception, and keep up the Special Teams dominance while we're at it.

Ultimately, this team is good enough to win the Super Bowl. Am I as high on the Ravens as I was after we beat SF last year or after we laid waste to the Rams on MNF? No. But I'm higher on them than I was at the same time last year. And I have faith that this team is well-coached and high-character and will continue to get better all season. AND I have faith that DeCosta will bring in a helpful piece for cheap at the trade deadline. It's tough to get excited about games against the WFT and Cincinnati, but there's certainly a very interesting stretch after the bye. We'll know a lot more then."
"No one is saying the team is horrible. Only the **pass rush** and **pass protection** are.

Judon sucks, as does Bowser, Ferguson, and Ward (is an okay DE).

Our DL can generate interior pressure, but that just pushed them to the outside where our edge rushers can't play contain, guard the flat or defend a screen to save their lives.

It doesn't help we have a **young and inexperienced** ILB. This is a growing pain for Queen.

As for RG, Phillips is most likely a backup quality. He has no leverage or push and seems to be slow to the 2nd level. Our PP is poo poo

Idk how you can give our OLBs a C. They're a flat F.

We blitz a ton, Matt Judon never wins 1-on-1s and this has been apparent for years.

WRs would be better if they had more time for their routes. We can't keep protection before Lamar has to scramble."

""
God I hope we put investment into olineman in the draft. If were losing stanley a year after yanda... gonna hurt. Oline is already kind of hobbled.
"You mean future Jet, Ronnie Stanley?"
"Man this always worried me. I value OL and DL a lot more than most people.

That being said 24m/year for Stanley? I love the dude but we got major issues at pass rush and OL. 

It might again be 80/20 with a franchise tagged year before we say good bye"
"Cant help but think the Ravens were sending a 'subtle' message to Stanley when they had Brown play  LT on Sunday, especially when you consider how well he performed and Harbaughs comments after the game."
"I mean we can also get an absolutely insane haul for Stanley imo. Save money, get picks and pick up a FA WR or edge. All hope is not lost if he is gone."
I saw this coming and honestly I'm okay with it. Locking up that much cap in a LT is just not going to work regardless of how good they are.
Everyone is replaceable. It's not like we'll play with 4 O-Linemen if Stanley walks. And it's not like the money we would have paid him gets thrown away. We'll sign other quality players if this happens
"I don't understand the idea that having a bad oline with Lamar is okay because Lamar is so athletic he can mask a bad oline.   Any QB, even Lamar, under constant pressure is not good.  It leads to mistakes, it leads to Lamar getting tired and it leads to him getting hit more.   Sacrificing oline because Lamar is elusive is not something that should be done.  Help him as much as possible.   Last year the oline was excellent and he threw for 36 touchdowns.  This year he can't hit on long shots and it under pressure way more often and it shows."
"I mean, this is concerning, he’s one of the best LT’s in the game."
Orlando was a LT throughout college.
Would love to get a Tunsil like Haul for Stanley and look to the draft
"If Decosta and Harbs think its the right move than I will support it. Hopefully the return is sizeable since he was a 6th overall pick who has been playing like it since he entered the league, especially last year."
"He's the guy to franchise tag I think (good move for Judon this past offseason, who we now know isn't worth the money he wants), who else would be a better contender in that regard?"
Its a good idea to let Stanley walk if he is commanding 22. Reinvest the 22 in other parts of the line and draft a tackle high
Does anyone remember 2013? Does anyone want a repeat of 2013?
"If we do trade him(I’d hate that move), we better get a fuck ton of draft capital. But BoB was the one making the trade for Tunsil so idek what we’d get for him. If the dolphins were able to get 2 1sts and a 2nd for Tunsil we better get a bit more for Stanley."
Everyone complains about the offense and then wants to let a top 3 tackle walk. Just pay the man.
Fuck Bill O'Brien for overpaying Tunsil!
Draft a Tackle 1st round after he leaves and will probably be ok. Still would like to see a deal made but not for Tunsil money
"Devils advocate: Lamars escapability really made all of our olinemen better than what they really were. 

Imagine the haul we would get for Stanley. Plus the cap savings. We could get a top end defensive player with the free space and possibly multiple 1sts? Im in."
I don't know but we need to at least have him for another year by tagging him. Then let him go if we can't reach a long term deal. I say 20M a year is fair for Stanley.
I agree Jeff...
Bill O’ Brien didn’t just fuck the Texans. He fucked the league on the LT market.
Somebody we like wont get a new deal.  Jackson is the only sure thing I can see.  All other options are on the table.
Trade him than for two draft picks than
Tunsil had unique leverage cause the Texans gave away their draft future to get him (and also cause BOB was a moron)
We should definitely keep him. Depending on his injuries this year. I mean he is a staple of our whole offense. A good qb dont mean shit if the Oline is horrendous.

I'm not entirely sure what the difference is in the products or why they would be charged to so dramatically higher on the high end scale. 

I've never owned a jersey because poverty. But I really want one one day. Obviously the $79 seems like the best deal, but would it get fucked up in a washing machine while another one is better for actually cleaning. 

And info on the quality difference between jerseys, if there is one, would be nice."
"If you’re on nflshop, or fanatics or the ravens store. Click on details and bring the drop down on the specific jersey. The 149 are vapor. So they’re stitched. The cheaper you get the less stuff that will be stitched on. The cheapest level of jerseys won’t have stitched on numbers and it’ll all be just screen printed like on them. 


Also for future reference I always make sure to wear a shirt under my jerseys and rarely wash any of them, stitched or not. But if I do, I was them alone on delicate or by hand and definitely do not throw them in the dryer."

Probably not he’s not very good
""
At this point in his career he is similar to Boykin.  Probably runs better routes but age is catching up to him.   49ers are young at wr but they need the help still and the 9ers still cut him.
Nah this is a Flacco era move.
"To add my perspective, I say if he’s available on waivers or for next to nothing, then get him. Otherwise, not a big enough improvement over what we have to give anything away."
That’s his second time getting cut in 2 months. Why would we want him? He isn’t going to draw any more attention from a defense than Boykin does and Atleast Boykin knows the offense.
"Actually, he could hurt. He wasn't even that productive with Tom Brady last year, and Brady had awful receivers. 

I'd much rather continue to give Boykin or Duvernay a shot than pick up another aging veteran WR who just wastes a roster spot."
"We are the kings of drafting old receivers in the twilight of their career - Crabtree, Maclin, to some extent Steve Smith and Mike Wallace. For once I want us to have the good new blood or the ones who get a real superstar like Hopkins. (Aside from cap space and all of the logistics of it.)"
"Source: The \#49ers are releasing WR Mohamed Sanu, as SF gets healthy at the position with some of their young guys. Rare for an experienced, accomplished WR to be free in early October.

Sure but we need line help

"Nah. Not interested in sanu. I'm fully convinced we need to focus on filling in the RG position with someone suitable to be called a Yanda replacement. Our oline is what is causing problems. And it's because that area is weak. 

Our receivers are fine. We need someone who can help prevent the line from crumbling immediately."
We need a wr 1 if were going to upgrade the position not Sanu. Ik the Earl stuff happened and we dont want those kind of guys but it was clear the players didnt want him here theyve also made it clear they wouldn't mind AB so neither would I. 🙊

"For what it’s worth, PFF grades:

He gelled with our defense almost immediately and he’s putting up better numbers than Murray."

He was super close to having another one too.  He punched a ball out later in the game.  It somehow bounced around in the players hands and wound up right back in his grasp.

Why do they need an RB? Eckler is likely only out for a month and Kelley looks pretty promising. There’s not enough in this trade for them.
Probably not enough film on Edwards to demand much value. Maybe if we would have actually used him during the Titans loss.
I could see M. Ingram doing great in purple
"Gus Edwards isnt worth much in a trade. He is a 3rd string power back with 0 receiving skills and who is a RFA at the end of the season. Undrafted guys and late round guys are performing well enough in the league for teams to not value these guys much. Plus, im sure we will give him a 2/3 year contract instead of the RFA tender at the end of the season and roll with JK and him"
The Chargers aren't dumb enough to do this. Not unless BoB gets hired as a shadow GM for some fucked reason.
"I saw a comment on the chargers subreddit that said, ""All Gordon is good for is taking carries away from your other backs"""
"Fuck that. What a dumb trade suggestion. Gus is our best back.

Why is the general consensus from most fans (outside of reddit too) that Gus isn't our best back?

It's glaringly obvious how well his power run style fits our team. Hill and Ingram are out after this season.


I'd trade a 2nd, Judon and a 6th for Ingram and a 3rd."
Nope.. give me Gus and his contract over Ingrams any day. Big names are nice but we are cash poor
"I’m glad none of us armchair GMs are actual GMs. I know I’d be pretty terrible at it. Probably the worst of all-time.

With that said, I’d try hard not to go over $22 million per year, but would go up to $24 million if it was the only way. I’d rather pay a premium than deal with the headache of losing the best left tackle in the NFL (who’s only 26). It may also be beneficial to consider franchise tagging him to give him 2 more years to prove he’s the best in the league.

While I think some people have a point in saying the return would be huge if they were to trade him, I’d have to disagree and say hitting on a top draft pick like him, at LT, is too valuable to give up in his prime.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j6h6q4)"
He was the best tackle in football last year and is graded again as the top tackle currently this year you don’t get rid of franchise LT you pay the man what he wants
There’s teams that desperately need a tackle and we have one of the best. We didnt look great but it wasnt horrible without him. We could trade him for pretty much anything we want. I know this is going to be an unpopular opinion but if we can fix a couple of our weaker positions while avoiding draining our cap. Ready for the downvotes
"Spotrac who do a pretty solid job of estimating market value has him valued at

4yrs $67M (16mil per yer)"
"I think if any team comes talking multiple firsts for him he has to go, with the way we draft that is giving us gold and buying us more time to lock up other talents..

I think barring that, he doesn't get Tunsil money because Tunsil clearly got overpaid especially for what they are getting out of him now, but anything shy of that is worthy something closer to 18-20 is realistically where he should land I think."
"I hope we franchise him for a year or two to give time for another team to ""reset"" the market that BoB fucked up with the Tunsil deal. Hopefully someone can push the rate down to the $18-20m ballpark."
"Houston may have overpaid for Tunsil, but we should not overpay for Stanley. Draft one. And yes, we need 2 edge rushers. Judon gone after the season."
"Trade for 2 firsts. Draft pass rushers.

And use the money to buy a cheaper RT and switch Orlando to LT.  Cut Judon and go for a prime receiver or another pass rusher."
"I’d sit Stanley down and explain his current market value. He’s not landing anywhere for 17+ on a 75% guarantee if he keeps getting injured and he’s not an elite tier lineman alone(we’ve seen him without Skura and Yanda, he doesn’t elevate the line around him). I’d be looking for a trade but if he’d agree to 16 or less guaranteed I’d roll the dice."

"I was u/Filmstudy’s guest last night on the [offensive review of the WFT game](http://www.filmstudybaltimore.com/offense-notes-week-4-ravens-football-team/) and I wanted to continue the dialogue we had about Fluker. Do you think he’d best serve as our RG instead of a backup tackle in case of injury? Given Phillips’ rookie growing pains and what we saw from Fluker against a good defensive line, I do feel like we are handicapping ourselves a bit in the name of depth."
"I believe the Ravens will stand pat with Phillips at right guard, even if that means more growing pains throughout the season. Baltimore elected to go with the mid-round rookie over the veteran Fluker and second-year Ben Powers (who got the start in last year's season finale and performed pretty well) in a year without any preseason games and a shorter camp. That already is a pretty tall feat, all things considered.

Now, I get that D.J. Fluker is the more consistent talent right now; but I can see *why* the Ravens want to stick with Tyre Phillips. For one, he's the ""future"", whereas Fluker is only signed for a year I think; and benching Phillips all of a sudden is probably not the best thing to do in the long run in terms of his confidence. Secondly, his potential can only be realized with more experience. It may take the majority of the season to see it; but if it does happen, it will pay dividends down the stretch and postseason for the Ravens as well in the years to come.

Unless Phillips gets hurt or he doesn't show any improvement before the bye week, I just can't see the Ravens making the swap. Let's put it this way: If the Ravens didn't see the potential in Phillips, would they have gone with him over players that actually have NFL experience in a possible Super Bowl year? It just so happens that Fluker is still a pretty good player and there isn't anywhere for him to start on the line. So, he's there as great depth for whenever a guard or tackle goes down and he needs to step in, like he did this past weekend."
"Orlando Brown Jr didnt get the start over Hurst until like week 5. Harbs doesn't like playing rookies. 

Phillips got the start over a solid vet in Fluker and 2nd year Bredson, with like zero offseason and literally zero preseason games. 

That says everything about their evaluations. Imma stick with what they are seeing."
"My biggest problem right now is I see Philips drifting back into spots that are cutting off running lanes for Lamar, he can't get forward out of the pocket he's having to loop around making him susceptible to the outside pressure that's usually getting moved towards the back of the pocket by the Guards.. he is essentially getting bottled up by his own lineman and there have been multiple drives that went stale this year so far because Lamar couldn't take his first out because he ran into Philips.

Also, the whole line will benefit more from sticking to the run.. there's some big guys we are asking to pass defense for along time.. and they're not always holding up.."
"In terms of replacements for the young linemen...The process of developing a young lineman and assimilating them to NFL play is always a slow one that takes patience as a major ingredient. Literally every OL the Ravens have drafted didn't play as well as a rookie as he would eventually. Even Ogden and Stanley improved plenty during year 1 and into year 2. But the other successful OLmen who got their start in Baltimore since 2006 have all had upward trajectories which lasted 4 weeks to 3 years. Jason Brown, Chester, Yanda, Grubbs, Gaither, Hurst, Osemele, Jensen, Wagner, Skura, Stanley, Eluemunor, Bozeman, OBJr all improved during their rookie seasons and beyond. Most of them started in the C/D grading level by my system for at least part of their rookie seasons.  


The exceptions to the rule are John Urschel (mind elsewhere--regressed then gave up football), Michael Oher (ski slope career after fine rookie year at RT and I don't care whether you want to blame the Ravens for moving him), and Alex Lewis (injuries, ended up playing his best as a rookie)  


All this is to say giving up on Phillips is premature. Bozeman was in almost exactly the same point last year before he saved his job in Seattle with a good game and has been good since."
""
Hoping our AFC brothers go to 4-1 this week.
"Y'all some major simps for going in therr and harping on every area that the Ravens aren't perfect at. Of course the team has weaknesses no perfect team can exist in the salary cap era. 

We have a top 3 roster in the AFC, top 5 team at worst. Meanwhile, the Bengals are struggling to be a top 20 team and have a terrible defense and OL. 

You guys really don't want to just say that this game is another creampuff easy blowout game because of that one ""Titans are hoes"" post which means we cant recognize this game for what it is right?

Before the Texans and WFT game, everyone pretty much knew the games were going to be blowouts in the Ravens favor with a very slim chance of an upset. It's the same thing with the Bengals. They're going to lose by like 30 and any other outcome would be a shock."

Because we blitz so much otherwise we can’t generate pressure

"Humphrey lined up in a blitz against the best QB in the league, start there"
"We don't have good coverage lbs in my opinion, usually good coverage lbs are good at play recognition and are generally the captain of the defense who can change the play based on what they see from the offense. Ray Lewis, Luke Kuechly, Bobby Wagner and Patrick Willis are some good examples of this."
"Since as a franchise we have never, and I mean ever, been able to successfully execute a screen the defense gets no practice seeing what one's supposed to look like.

"OL scoring vs WFT, including:

1. A 3rd straight strong game from Matt Skura
2. Regression by Tyre Phillips
3. An outstanding fill-in job by Zeus at LT
4. Play with positive portent by DJ Fluker at RT"
They gotta consider making a switch at RG I feel. Can’t help but think Fluker or Powers could be an improvement.
So it looks like our issues are at both of the guard positions. Which makes sense that Roman is trying to do more on the outside as opposed to calling inside runs cause the Guards are weak

No he was already declining before the elevator incident due to injury.
Definitely a Ring of honor lock for us
"Probably not, but I do say Hall of Very Good."
We will find out because JK Dobbins is Ray Rice II
"I doubt he could have made the HoF, he was already on the decline when that incident happened.  If teams really thought he had a lot in him still, he would have been signed by someone.  It was an intersection of bad PR and declining play.

It really sucks because I think he is a much better person than that one incident reflects."
"No, he was washed"
"He didn't come back into the NFL because of how publicised it was and he was coming off a very bad year. What Adrian Peterson did was worse and he's still allowed back in the NFL. He's still in the league for 2 reasons:

1. He's still a good player despite his age.
2. What he did has been largely forgotten by the public eye and people still think corporal punishment is ok with kids. Despite there being a lot of evidence showing that physical discipline only really produces negative outcomes for a child."
"It sucks he never got another chance I still believe he had something left. Its just odd he gets banned for life but greg hardy, AP, Hunt, Tyrek and others still got another chance"

Stop with this shit meme already. Bunch of tryhards
McSorley is not NFL starter material
Its a divisional game so things might get wacky. Still want to use Baltimore in my Eliminator Pool though.
It feels like too much. Joe burrow has no quit in him from what I've seen. It doesn't really matter though if the bengals defense is dogshit.
"The spread against Washington was 13, and Cincy is definitely better than the Football Team. We ended up beating the Football Team by 14. Obviously no bet is guaranteed, but Cincy is the right pick against the spread."
With the way our secondary was getting cooked left and right for the past 2 weeks. Joe burrow might turn into our fucking kryptonite like Andy Dalton did. Not saying we going to lose these next 2 “gimmies” but I wouldn’t be entirely surprised if we lost 1 against the eagles or Bengals. Our defense is still top 5 but a defense can only keep you in ball games for so long. Offense better get it together In these next 2 games because November is goin to be tough
"Cincinnati’s defense is so much worse than Washington’s. The discrepancy between what our offense can do to their defense vs what their offense can do to our defense favors us pretty significantly, even if Burrow is the real deal.

Plus, Wink is excellent when it comes to confusing rookie QBs with complex schemes and looks. And Cincy simply doesn’t have the coaching to counter that.

So no, 13 points is not too many."
"Their OL and Defense is quite bad, but as long as AJ Green is on the field, you never know."
"It is definitely too many points I’d use the Chargers I think they cover the plus 8 pretty easily.  There offense while it’s inconsistent is enough with there great defense to keep them in games closely.  Even without there top weapons the Bucs offense is better then the Saints, and on top of this the Saints defense which I thought would carry them has looked like shit.  If you don’t have them I like the Chiefs minus 12.5."
I hope we run 80% of the time.

"Averett knows he’ll be targeted. This is not an insult. Our dbs include Peters, Humphrey, Smith and Clark. It is literally OC’s job to target the “weak link” or unproven variable on a defense. I guess he didn’t have to say it publicly but it’s hard to know what context this was in."
“Even Stevie Wonder could see the Chiefs were going to avoid our blitz attack” - not Wink
Would be cool to be proven wrong about Averett.
Brutal. Coach keeping it real.
well yeah because Stevie Wonder isn't blind
They are who we thought they were
They're really about to give a free fucking win to the Steelers from their stupidity...
God I hope they get throttled the rest of the season for nearly destroying it through reckless stupidity.
"How are the Titans still listed as number 1 in their division? Same question about the Steelers? If neither of these teams play another game, they just win their division? This is stupid."

Who gets an INT first this year Chuck or DeShon?
"Deshon for me. He's already a ballhawk. The more he gets comfortable, look out"
DeShon off a tip. Chuck will get one after from reading the QB.
Chuck has better positioning through the first 4 games so ill go chuck. I think deshon will get better as the season goes on but he’s just not there yet.
"Chuck. He's the swiss army knife on our defense.

Chuck gets the first INT by a over thrown route.

DeShon gets it off reading the QB."

"He was signed to a 20 year, 44 million per year extension."
He’s gonna run for pres in 2044
"They could be giving him a hard time. Seeing as it took 3 games to get his first sack, maybe they are (playfully) suggesting his next won't occur until 2044."
"I'm going with this: Judon thinks he is better than Ed Reed & Marlon Humphrey combined, has been saying so to anyone who will listen to him, and all those teammates are subsequently roasting him about it!"
"Is he expecting a kid, maybe? Another Judon who would start theoretically playing in the NFL in the year 2044?"
Do you have an example? I just looked at the handful I follow on IG and none of them had anything about Judon other than the wallpaper the team IG put out yesterday

Good! This match-up needs to keep happening so we can know where we stand. To be the best you gotta beat the best. Can't hide from them til postseason.
That's gonna be the league-wide season opener.
Good. It will be the second time we beat them after the AFC Championship Game!
Please not early in the season again. We need in-season game tape against Reid to even stand a chance... and that will give us enough time to have beaten covid enough to have a full stadium.

"Let’s face it, Lamar’s not as young as he was last year."
"I think it's gotta be precautionary. He never showed any sign of injury during the game, was out messing around with Haskins on the field after, and he seemed totally normal doing press yesterday. 

Unless he like tripped on some stairs I don't see how it could be a serious thing. I'm guessing it's just some soreness and they're being extra careful, but it does seem strange"
Let's see what happens Friday. If he misses another practice I will be worried. I do not want to see RG III on the field unless we're up by 30.
Reason for concern or just precautionary??
"Hmmm...two days in a row worries me a little. It’s still early, but any chance he sits on Sunday?"
They said yesterday was precautionary  and I bought it but today I'm a little worried we've been here before where Harbs  downplays an injury so nobody knows what's really going on and we find out it's worse than expected. Especially when all we've been hearing sense the Cheifs loss all we've heard is these issues will get worked out in practices if Lamar isn't practicing their not getting worked out and I just feel like they wouldn't hold him out of practice for no reason two days in a row.. but idk shit so I guess we'll see on Sunday
"Bengals fan here, and the sentiment in the Bengals subreddit is that we hope Lamar's injury isn't serious and he plays.  We know we're not going to the playoffs this year, but we would like to see where we match up well, and where we need to improve, and we would like the Ravens to be at full strength when they play.

If it was Big Ben, we would probably feel differently, because fuck the Steelers!"
Flashbacks to the Perriman rookie year fiasco.   Hope Lamar is truly OK
"I have to guess it wasn’t severe enough to warrant an MRI and if I did we could have conclusive info on whether or not he’s out for weeks and not be in this day to day stuff


Can someone who works in healthcare explain a little more? I believe there is a difference between a knee sprain and knee strain. Is a strain less severe and is it more likely he’s dealing with that rather than a sprain?"
I wonder why they’re being so secretive about it.
"Can someone explain to me why john harbaugh has been so secretive with injury info recently. 

It's not your fault if he's hurt, just tell us the whole truth. Otherwise it makes me assume the worst."
A minor knee injury doesn't make you unavailable for two straight practices. This is like Breshad all over again lmfao.
Precautions arent inherently 24hrs. Jeez. Lamar could show up Sunday with zero practice and beat the Bengals.
if I had to guess they are being extra cautious. because he is their baby. that sounds sus. I mean in a metaphorical sense. not an endearing one
M\*dden c\*rse ?
We can all thank Greg Roman and his glorious RPO for this

Harbs totally would put a smiley face on a note like that haha
How is an NFL head coach gonna have the penmanship of a 3rd grader? smh lol

"Just FYI r/Bengals is saying our corners are lackluster and AJ Green will have a huge day. 

But that’s cool, they have fucking confidence in their team unlike this place because we lost one fucking game to the Chiefs and we are not scoring 40 a game, only 30."
Sunday's game has me worried.  Not just because of this but because of Cincy's talent at the skill positions.
""
Do we even need Lamar?
I showed this to my 8-year old daughter as she was watching tv and she ran back to her room to finish her homework. Thanks for your help.
Idk he hasn't made any big plays but with tavon going down and wink moving jimmy around i think he'll have more chances to make plays. I haven't been a fan of his but I think he has a big game soon.
His coverage is generally good he just has horrible ball skills
"Let’s hope so... if he steps up and we have peters, humph, and a decent averette we are gonna be chillin"
"He might be even worse than Peters in run support but I've been pleasantly surprised with his coverage. I really thought we were going to see him getting targeted on every big down but that hasn't been the case. He gave up some plays against KC but so did everybody, and if anything he was targeted less than some others. 

If he keeps up this improvement he'll be a solid CB3 before you know it."
"He has not made many plays, but he has given up plenty of plays"
Averett is garbage. Bring back Carr
I have said hes not trash like some people think and I think hes got potential but I dont wanna see him playing over 80% of defensive snaps every game. Let Jimmy play more outside keep Clark and Elliott at safety and bring Co Cap in at sub lb on 3rd downs.

Wow this is really unexpected to me. Anyone have any idea why? Clearing room for someone???
""
"Wow that's wild, didn't expect that. I wonder if we're signing Brandon Carr like most think or bringing in a player via trade?

Gotta be one of the two."
Damn that's kind of a shocker. We're pretty thin at safety
"Wow, PFF is going to have a REEEEEE moment after this one"
Is this making room for a trade?
Remember when he was going to challenge to start and then be the third safety?
Did Geno have a spot on the 53? If i remember correctly he did
Any guesses why? It must be to make room for an acquisition or just that Geno Stone was dead weight. I choose the former for my own sanity.
Why? Who is replacing him
Could we be trying to move him to practice squad?
Not my Iowa boy 😭
"He’s been inactive every game so he hasn’t even managed to carve out a role on ST I can’t say they are wrong to do it, but it feels odd to see us cut a pick in the year we drafted them."
"So there's the Eric Weddle and Brandon Carr ideas, but Tony Jefferson can't have a very high price tag right now, right?"
Was rooting for him to take the starting spot when we got rid of Earl Thomas. Best of luck to stone
This just in: Ravens have signed CFL Yukon Yaks safety Bearl Bhomas.
Gilchrist getting promoted?
"Dang, I really had hopes for him. But as always, in Harbs and EDC we trust"
Im hoping its to mke room to sign Clay Matthews to help our passrush

"It’s an interesting perspective, and I agree that it contextualizes our pass rush failures as partly due to Martindale’s schemes, not completely shouldered by Judon. Still doesn’t answer why he makes EDGE money if he’s not that, or whether Judon’s versatility is worth a less effective blitz-based pressure scheme that sacrifices pieces in coverage, or why, even, when Judon does get his hands on a QB he can’t take them down. I’m all for using each player for their actual strengths—not what we wish they had, but we just have to ask what is the outcome for the team?"
It doesn’t agree with my narrative
"QB hits are a bullshit stat.

#LAMAR JACKSON COUNT: 1
"Murray -> MAndrews, name a better duo."
Murray throws a TD pass to Mark Andrews all the way from Arizona!
Queen taking this rival personally. He's been flying at 100mph all game
Lamar’s homie just died cut him some slack.
You know our kicker is the GOAT when I was disappointed with him missing a 61 yarder so badly at the Bank 🤣
I am very sad he didn't hit that
Looking at these comments you’d think the score was reversed
Boykin is SO bad. Didn't even try for it. Cuts his routes early.
"Lamar's worst ever game in a Ravens shirt. Would rather have it now than against a good team when it matters, though"
MARLO DPOY
Marlon Humphrey worth every single penny
DPOY MARLON HUMPHREY LETS GET IT TRENDING
Marlon is underpaid
I just want to say I am very happy that Harbaugh finally listened to me and decided to have Tucker kick it out of the end zone every time.
"Go Eagles, Go Raiders...Go Flacco lol"
pittsburgh giving up 29 to a team that tied with cincinnati lmfao
Dobbins has just one carry (34 yards!). Why dont' they give him a practice reps in a game like this.
[deleted]
"Can we start utilizing Hollywood on slants, cross routes etc"
"I know we’re winning, but this offense hurts my eyes"
Unpopular opinion: I am enjoying that we are winning and are not like the 2015 Ravens
Lamar missed two practices this week with a knee issue. It's very possible they told Lamar to stay in the pocket and play this out differently this week. It is the Bengals after all... Why risk it and have him go crazy on a team when he doesn't need to.
Apologizing for the Murray thing lol
"Lamar Jackson stats right now:

0 incompletions 

0 ints

0 sacks

0 fumbles

🐐"
He keeps calling him Murray. wtf
"Am I on drugs or has the commentator called Lamar ""Murray"" at least twice?"
"It was to our benefit, but that call was lame."
This team just doesn’t fuck around against bad teams
"‘Terrible decision to go for it on 4th and 6, should have just punted and trusted their defense!’  
Bitch, they did trust the D - that’s why they could go for it on 4th and 6."
Morgan “Ray Lewis” Cox
I miss Yanda
Bowser is looking way better than Judon this season
We won't win the superbowl with the 31st passing offense plain and simple
"Part of what made us successful last year was effectively running the ball which forced the defense to sell out to stop the run, allowing lamar more open looks, by not establishing the run the defense is just playing pass d all game"
Idk how anyone can watch this offense the entire season so far and be confident....it’s not just today
and we get stuffed on a 3rd and two. So much for the run game
This offense sucks today. Absolutely disgraceful. They need to buy the dinner fucking expensive dinners next week.
"If we were playing any other team, Im pretty sure we’d be losing. This is such an overwhelmingly shitty performance on offense."
Marlon should be in consideration for DPOY. He’s an absolute turnover machine.
"Friendship ended with offence, defence is my new friend"
DPOTY and its not even close u fuckin momos
Marlon Humphrey could punch the depression out me
I want this damn shutout
Is Gumbel drunk or just not even watching the game?
I know we all on Roman right now but I really believe Yanda was the glue keeping the offense together...
Take a shot every time the announcer calls Lamar “Murray”
"As good as Andrews looks...we *need* to get Lamar another certified passing threat. Other, better teams will key in on him and make Lamar uncomfortable throwing to his other options."
How is our long snapper the first one to the ball lol
This is gonna be the year that solidifies Marshal Yanda  as a FIRST BALLOT HOF. lol
Lamar's knee clearly isn't 100%
Honestly Dobbins should be starting. Ingram doesn't look as good this year and Edwards is decent but not better than either of the above two.
This defense is going to mask how poor the offensive playcalling has been
Burrow has aged 30 years in the last 2 hours
Was that another shitty route by Boykin?
"All the running success on that drive, and you pass on 3rd and three. Lmao"
Imagine how scary good this defense would be if you could magically replace Judon with an in-his-prime Sizzle?
Does Marlo have the same amount of sacks as Judon? Lol
"Everyone is so concerned about this offense and we are 4-1.   I'll be concerned in December if we look like this, but this is the fifth game of the year with no pre-season. Boykin is a bust and Snead is...Snead. I hope Duvernay comes along, but  until then we only have 2 real recieving threats.

Boykin gave up on that route that everyone is killing Lamar for."
Holy shit this offense is literally making me nauseous
This is classic Ravens football now. Offense not doing shit but somehow blowing the opponent out because of defense.
The offense better be buying the defense an expensive ass dinner after this game
Marlon Humphrey for DPOY.
Andddd *that's* why you pay the man.
"Marlon and Queen are the future, were in good hands raven fans"
"""Football is important to him.""

What kind of stupid cliched bullshit commentary is that"
"Philly is giving Pittsburgh a game right now, kinda like every game in the NFL is not a sure-fire win and it’s a little bit harder to consistently blow out bad teams than this team makes it look 🐸☕️"
"Raiders up 30-24 against the chiefs, steelers only up 2 against the eagles!"
Calais is a spectacular signing.
"Terrible spot, I dont think he made it to the line of scrimmage."
Bengals running the clock out so they can GTFO and go home.
Lol seriously a fg so you don’t get shutout??? Pussies
Like bunting in the 9th to break up a no-hitter
"We all calling Lamar Murray from here on out, right?"
Great extra point by Justin Murray
Lamar Murray throws complete to Mark Kittle inside the 5
I feel a little bit of empathy for Burrow.  If it were Baker of Ben I would feel nothing.
Not even mad at judon anymore Queen just took out his boy LMAOOO
That’s just greed by Harbaugh. There’s no reason to go for a 4th and 6 up 17 when you can just pin them back and probably end up with the same field position a few minutes later.
Joe is getting murdered.
There's literally a defender every time Lamar leaves the pocket lol. That's why we don't run the ball as much. Last year that's an easy 6-8 yards. This year it's a loss or throwaway.
"Wtf is with the right side of our line this season, feels like every single drive there’s a free rusher coming from the right"
It really speaks to how bad the Bengals are that it's 17-0 with how bad Lamar and the playcalling have been.
Announcer just said pass is complete? This dude is really bad lol
"It's ok Tuck, that's 61 yards"
Madubuike looked excellent.
Boykin was literally run blocking wtf was that
Lamar Jesus my dude
Something is off with Lamar. I’ve never seen this tier of play from Lamar . Where is the elite pocket awareness and elite decision making from last year???
Patrick Queen is now the LSU alum with the most touchdowns in this game
I really hope we're able to get Humphrey a ring.
Marlon Fucking Humphrey man. Nobody is more deserving of the bag than this guy.
FRUIT MOTHERFUCKIJHR PUNCH I swear that man forces a fumble every other game
"Man, Marlon is insane. How this man isn't front runner for DPOY I don't understand"
I love Patrick Queen! The man is everywhere!
Why tf has lamar thrown 37 times in a game we’ve been up since Q1
Marlon might be best play making corner we have ever had.
Wait until the new fans who are upset with this game realize that this was basically every Ravens game back in the day with the offense not doing anything but the defense blowing out every opponent.
LETS GO PHILLY!!!!!
Yo philly com on cuz you got this
Humphrey's right hook is underrated!
Did calais just tackle two guys at once?
Steelers blowing the game
Can we get a meme for Marlo using the super punch out picture lol
"Patrick Queen Defensive ROTY

Marlon Humphrey DPOTY

Let’s start the campaigning!"
"Sad Mahomes. 😭😭 And the announcers can't do their usual brainless slobbering.

Inject this shit straight into my veins."
"Haha get fucked KC

Sidenote: it's still scary af that they managed to put up 32 points *in a loss.*"
Unpopular Opinion: I’m so glad the ravens are using these games against lesser opponents to better their passing game. We know they can run all over teams but we need this passing in the playoffs
"Bro these newscasters get paid so much money for this job. They should know the rosters of both teams top to bottom, it's literally their job. Not being able to get the name of the fucking quarterback right is annoying. Fire these fools."
Duvernay burned his man there
"He was gonna run for that 1st, but Queen started booking it"
Queen has been amazing for us already dudes going to be a raven for life
"Stop calling Lamar ""Murray"" please holy fuck"
"Lamar frustrated, good"
Murray Counter: 7
"Balmer, Murrayland"
Queen is our new defensive king
"You guys are getting pissed at the pass play callings, but most of them aren't that bad if Lamar actually makes the throw..."
I feel bad for Burrow honestly lmao
3rd and 24 against the Bengals used to be a scoring play for them lol
Burrow deserves better lol. This is sad
"Gray, rainy day, no fans, Lamar is off, and no energy.

No offense to the Bengals or Burrow but against a lot of other teams we'd be worse off than up 17-0."
I want a fucking touchdown on this drive.
I WANTED THAT SOOOOOOO BAD
He had the distance right? Only a bit off...
He actually just caught himself saying Murray
Hollywood finally got some YAC
Hollywood is half the size of everyone on the field yall want him to get injured? Lmao
[deleted]
It should be like 35-0
That fumble was too slippery. MP put too much 🧃 on it
"Peters with the Create A Player Madden stats... an interception, a sack and a forced fumble. 😂"
Boykin is terrible what is this stupid announcer talking about “you got to give the receiver a chance”
How weird is it that Flacco and le'veon bell are on the same offense
"Instead of only focusing on the bad, there's a ton of good things to take away from this game.

Queen is clearly amazing, McPhee is winning 1v1s, Bowser and Ferguson look great, Wink's blitz schemes look a lot more creative."
Great seeing Madibuike out there. His draft video was so sincere and sweet
Tf is Lamar doing? He’s lucky he hasn’t thrown like 4 picks today because Bungles are just dropping them all
Offense has regressed so much
LMAO FUCKING HUMPHREY DID IT AGAIN
"Winning a game 27-0 despite lamar playing the worst game of his career.

This team is wild. Humphrey is lethal. Queen is fast as hell."
Marlon doing this every week actually feels unfair. How
My Queen jersey comes in next week
We have DPOY and DROY
DROY QUEEN DPOY HUMPHREY
"Yeeeesh Hump, its like he gets at least one of these every game!"
DPOTY
"Marlo is so fuckin good yo, it's unreal. Queen is a playmaker too. Once we get a good dline we're stepping into 2000 territory"
#FruitPUNCH
"Marlon ""Fucking"" Humphrey!"
The Chad defense vs the The virgin offense.
Wow marlon Humphrey deserves more money! QUEEn!!
"M A R L O N              H U M P H R E Y

Can we give this man more money?"
"Defense really saving our shit today, some classic Ravens football to educate the bandwagons"
Marlon Humphrey is the only Ste*a*ler I root for!
You got this Eagles!!!
Looks like the Bengals just want to go home. Can't wait to see Lamar attempt 7 more passes
>Marlon Humphrey needs to be in DPOY talks. Patrick Queen needs to be in DROY talks- like as soon as possible - @_tonyjefferson
False fucking start you hear chuck
Y'all got any more of them turnovers?
That's a bad spot tho for real he was like a yard short
"Although Lamar has looked bad today, a ton of QBs this season seem... off. The injury and short offseason probably isn't helping."
We are spoiled. We are going to win 27-3 and I feel like our offense was hot garbage today (and almost all of the season so far).
Please Eagles don’t choke
Raiders killing the Chiefs right now in front of their fans and I am HERE for it.
god i hate announcers during chiefs games
#MORE DUVERNAY PLEASE
Why tf do we always switch to passing bruh just keep running it
Duvernay was open
"Good grief guys, get your tackling down."
Bruh watching Patrick Queen turn on the burners and bee line for Burrow had me hyped. Can’t wait to see what he accomplishes
Queen's speed came in huge there. If that's one of our slow LB's from last year Burrow runs for a first.
The announcer has called Lamar Murray twice now
WHO THE EFF IS MURRAY ITS LAMAR YOU IDIOTS!!
HOW DOES HE KEEP CALLING HIM MURRAY HES THE FUCKING MVP
Someone tell him the Ravens qb is Lamar Jackson and not orioles great Eddie Murray
"Murray count: 6. 

This a joke at this point"
"I needed to change my flair, might as well make it something stupid at this point."
Our offense is getting it done but it still looks off.
Murray must Murray his Murray Murray for Murray to Murray his Murray.
Our first round pick from LSU > their first round pick from LSU
"Queen absolutely rocked Burrow’s shit, my god"
"Ugh, Queen is already a game changer without a regular preseason as a 21 year old. He gonna be a stud"
And now a Flacco special. 3yrd pass on 3rd and 8
Lamar playing so sloppy
Bengals O-line making our pass rush look god-tier
I want to see some more duvernay action
Burrow's 300 yard streak is way more impressive after getting a first hand look at the Bengals offensive line. So so bad
Greg roman going back to the prohibition era wit these bootlegs man
"This is a solid football team but the energy just isn't the same as last year. Not nearly as fun to watch. More bad decisions. Whats different? I wonder if its just the weirdness of the world right now with covid, empty stadiums, etc etc"
I wish Yanda played just 1 more year since this is the year we have a great shot at winning the whole thing and we really need him. I’m glad he seems to be enjoying life more now though.
This is bad film for when we play actual teams. Just give Lamar a littler pressure and we have some real head scratchers. You get the feeling they are artificially telling him to stay in the pocket and become something he’s not.
"Where is the Lamar from week 1? Regardless of the team, he was hitting receivers and makin perfect reads

This is really bad :("
61 yarder at the Bank with storm clouds rolling in...and we all almost expected him to make it anyways 😂🐐
"Most kickers don't even try that kick. Still love you, JT"
#STILL THE BEST KICKER IN THE NFL
How about our defense though guys? Its not like Burrow has been trash up to this point...
This halftime highlight show is being really generous to Lamar
Lamar is definitely not 100 %
lamar could have 3-4 interceptions this game. i have no idea what's going on with him
Roman lost his run playcall sheet
Man Elliot looks way more explosive on those FS blitzes than Earl did last year
Burrow might legit die this season at this rate he’s getting hit by teams
That was definitely not a hold
Greg just called Lamar “Patrick” after calling him “Murray” a dozen times. This is a problem.
Please fucking fire these trash ass low rate announcers
It really seems like once we went up 17-0  they said let's just use this as a scrimmage and try some of that passing stuff Mahomes does
Tucker really flirting with those goal posts 🤔
Miles needs to just sit out for a week and just run routes for two weeks straight until he gets them into his head
"This is just embarrassing. Hats off to our defense. Our offense is obviously good enough to beat the Bengals. But this performance is good for 6 points against the Steelers. 

The Raiders hung 24 on KC in the first half."
Umm false start?
We are literally blowing out a team right now and I still feel worse about the Ravens.
I am confident marlon Humphrey could get more sacks in a season than Judon
Guys it’s okay to say Lamar has not looked good today or even the past couple weeks
"Up 20-0, first down, pass. Fuck off Roman"
Greg Roman needs to lay off the drugs it’s starting to show
Marlo is DPOY
And people still don’t think Marlo is a top three CB in the league? He’s top 2 and he’s not 2
Hump for DPOY
Marlon is worth every penny.
Humphrey for DPOY? If he keeps this up.
Marlon with the reach-around ball extraction
"Bengals options since mid 3rd

1: run and basically FF

2: pass and basically kill Burrow"
Apology accepted
"""yeah that's not gonna save me""

Good on him for owning it."
I want a SHUTOUT so bad...ughh
"Anyone else here that actually enjoys when we’re up a ton and our opponents have long 4th quarter drives, because it means less opportunities for offensive injuries?"
Petition to rename this team the Cincinnati Mixons. Sign here with you doot.
Thank goodness offense didn’t need to show up 😅 need to right the ship soon though
Zac Taylor is a coward lmfao
FG of shame
Lmao this is soooo weak from Cincy. Just run it a few times and kick a FG. Taylor is a beta male.
"QB: *knee injury, missed practices*
Y’all: WTF IS HE DOING WHY IS HE SO BAD

please chill"
"> Pathetic, just absolutely pathetic. With this kind of defensive domination and our run game once again flourishing when given the chance, we should be leading this 50-0. 17-0 is just pathetic at this point.

We have some fucking unhinged fans lmaooo some of y'all need help"
"For people criticizing roman on that 3rd down...

Roman called a run. Lamar checked into a pass. Boykin didn't know lamar checked into a pass which is why he went out to run block.

Miscommunication.

Don't listen to the commentator. He doesn't even know the name of the NFL's MVP."
If only greg roman could show similar creativity with passing plays
"Lamar had a guy crossing wide open, would been an easy first."
"Lamar can be as frustrated as he wants with the offense, but if he can't see wide open WRs, he needs to start taking more responsibility."
Jesus Christ that needs to be a sack
Patrick Queen almost got him
Burrow wanted to run but Queen had him cut off easily
These are announcers are so boring God pls kill me
Will this announcer please learn the reigning unanimous MVPs name? Holy shit
Lamar does not look too happy right now
Murray Count: 5
cardinals legend Lamar Murray
"Murray hands off to Murray, slips a tackle from murray, and makes it down to the 4-Murray line."
First touchdown of the Lamar Murray era.
Lamar Mandrews is literally our only offense so far this season. No wonder we got blown out vs the Chiefs when Mandrews had the worst game of his career.
Refs trying to figure out how Murray snuck in.
Mark Andrews is our offense
Just ordered my Murray “groundhog” Jackson jersey
Let’s get Marquise Hill his first TD of the year
We gotta feed Mark Kamara more
The demise of Lamar Jackson has been greatly exaggerated.
The Ravens sure look good for a team so many are unhappy with.
Another missed sack. It’s ridiculous
"Burrows jersey is filthy
.🤣🤣😉"
Oh look judon offsides
Who else is in the DROY conversation this year? Queen is definitely near the top
This is Burrows welcome to the NFL game unfortunately for him. I can't tell if he's playing bad or his line is just worse than swiss cheese. Probably a bit of both
Queen literally made no attempt to tackle Burrow and just tried to kill him....but they're really close.
Greg Roman pumped for that false start so he can change from a run to a pass
Ball was tipped yall calm down
WHY? WHY DOES GREG CALL 3RD DOWN THROWS TO A PLAYER NOT AT THE LINE TO GAIN? FUCKING HORRIBLE
"Gross. i feel like the play was there though, LJ and Andrews just didn't execute. Probably on Lamar."
Bad throw. Love the 4th decision. Fuck the commentators. 17-0 with a defence playing well is the PERFECT time to go for it.
This D is angry today I love it
If only every team we played had the Bengals' Oline
McPhee > Judon
So just fuck JK huh?
Could this be Bowser's coming out party?
This pressure is giving me a boner
Gotta love The Wire intro going into commercial
Wow Alex Smith is in the game for Washington!
It feels like we should be up by 40
Dobbins needs more touches
"It's ok, Tucker.  We still love you!"
I’ve never seen so many complaints about a 17-point halftime lead
Derek Carr with 235 Yards & 3 TDs on the Chiefs.  We couldn't even get 100 passing yards.
"Last years offense was historic. I figured they’d be a drop off, but does Roman expect every run to go 10+ yards everytime???? Like these 3-4 yard gains are decent and we should continue chipping away with them. The play calling has been so unbalanced"
I really don't think Lamar is playing **that** bad. Making it seem like he's the Danny Green of NFL lol.
DID THE ANNOUNCER JUST SAY LEBRON JACKSON????
Lamar's not running because of his knee. I think he was told NOT to risk it today
Shouldn't we just be pounding and grounding with a 17-0 lead???
Why DO you keep on saying murray??
HE'S BECOMING SELF AWARE HE'S LEARNING
[here’s a tweet of a compilation of the “Murray’s” from the first half](https://twitter.com/mukiangelo/status/1315353185838534657?s=21)
Snead stopped running.
Man I'm so disappointed in #8 today.
Why the fuck do we keep doing a fake handoff on the opposite side of the rb?
This offense is dead
Our receivers just don't have it..
so good at ball extraction...whoa
Defense came to play. LJ just looks off. I wonder if he’s hurting more than they’re saying.
Lmao that fumble reminded me of [this amazing play](https://youtu.be/QEEDwRrHujs)
Boykin just giving up mid route.
Boykin not even trying smh
"At least flacco scored, we can be happy about that"
"Like, take Boykin out and give Duvernay reps. Seriously. Run more with Dobbins, I dunno what the fuck we think we’re doing. Such an ugly fucking game. This game should be beyond reach right now."
Judon's got more flags than a US embassy. Jfc.
Marlon is on track to be our best corner ever.
Marlon's first sack!!!!!!!!
Their O line is just there for show at this point
Somebody post the meme of Squidward looking out the window but it's Judon looking at literally the entire rest of the defense getting sacks on Burrow
Fire Roman. I'm done.
What are these throws? 😐
"Lamar looks like shit throwing since the Chiefs game

dude needs to get it together"
Lol at people calling out Roman for Lamar making horrible throws
Wow Lamar wtf. His stat line looks ok but not passing the eye test today
ugh Lamar is lucky not to have 3 picks this game :(
Feel like I’m watching a 2006 game. All good though they’ll rebound
Yeah the offense is completely hapless right now what is happening
Offense looks like ass today
Defense basically running the show on this one.
"Defense looks amazing, offense looks atrocious. Good old Ravens football"
MARLO WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DRINKING I WANT SOME
Marlon getting FFs all the time.
How does Marlon do it!?
We were due for a defensive TD
Our defense has been insane today omg. Marlon Humphrey! What is that 3 games in a row with a forced fumble?
I fucking love Marlon Humphrey
Queen and Humphrey a problem
"Defense came to play. Marlo is amazing, I'm getting a jersey"
Marlon DPOY
"Lamar looks...off?

So do you think the Ravens are downplaying Lamar’s knee injury? I haven’t seen hardly any designed runs for him this game and a lot of his throws are sailing on him. I think his knee is more hurt than they’re letting on and it’s showing. Thoughts?"
Soon 1 hours of Humphrey punching the ball out
"Didn't even know Jimmy Smith was playing today, that's how quiet their offense has been."
"lol who was that yelling ""thats a false fucking start""?"
"I’m so baffled by Roman’s play calling.  After last year, I considered him one of the top O coordinators in the league, but he’s completely lost it.  I know we’re probably seeing different looks this year, but he’s gotten so far away from the run it’s disgusting to watch.  Seems like he keeps trying to surprise teams by passing on 1st and 2nd down.  I feel like establishing the run is so important for our offense, because it also opens up the play action.  I honestly feel like they could give me the playbook and I could call a better game.  Roman NEEDS to be better if  we expect to contend this year"
Really be out here hoping we can keep the shutout..
Was kinda hoping we’d shut them out :(
Kinda salty about that
BOOOOOOOO!!! Have you no shame? Fg settling for no good jungle cats
Did Bengals really just kick a FG to say they didn’t get shutout. LMAO what a cop out.
Chiefs about to go 4-1
Amazing how pedestrian Mahomes looks when his receivers aren't wide open.
"The teams the Steelers have beaten have a total of 3 wins. Those 3 wins came against the Jets, the Jaguars and a Garopollo-less 49ers. Their record does not reflect their ability, they have a lot to prove still"
"If we were playing a playoff team like this, we’d be getting embarrassed. I don’t care that we are winning 20-0, this win doesn’t make me happy."
Lamar was god awful today
Holy fuck a new play. Buy your lotto tickets
Throwing the ball when we had a 30 yard run and are a running team.  Come on.
"The sooner Lamar learns Duvernay is a reliable receiver who catches pretty much any ball in his area the better. He was such a reliable receiver, especially on 3rd down, in college."
I’ve never seen a defense that is so bad at tackling the QB. It’s actually impressive.
Well Bengals you WERE perfect on 4th down.
Fuck off the field young man
"Did the announcer just call Lamar ""Murray?"""
I think duvernay was such a good add for our team. Incredible value in round 3
"wtf are these announcers? ""Marcus Brown""? Calling Lamar Murray? We keep getting the D team lol"
Am I tripping or does he keep calling Lamar “murray”?
who is murray
WHY IS HE CALLING LAMAR MURRAY?
That’s our QB Lamar Murray
Murray with the TD
Great patience from our guy Kyler in the pocket just then
"Holding the fuck out of him too, call that shit"
Nice field goal by Murray Butker
I love mark andrews but it’s frustrating how much our entire offensive depends on him having a good game
Murray
This murray shit is insulting
"Friendship ended with lamar, now murray is my best friend"
The Baltimore Murrays
Why the fuck does he keep saying MURRAY
Mark Kittle with the 1st down
I swear we get the most pressure without a sack in the league
Flacco is 6/9
THE SACK FORCED FUMBLE BY QUEEN!!
QUEEEEEEEEEN
Judon is so awful I can’t believe people still defend him.
YAAAAAASSS QUEEN
The worst part about having Lamar in fantasy is he is gonna get benched by the 4th q again so Bobby 3 Sticks can play
Judon with the 4D Chess move. He knew that Queen was going to force the fumble and be in a better field position so he purposely went offside 😂
"Welcome to the North. This is your life now, Joe."
Remember 3-4 years ago when Bengals fans called this a rivalry?
Now this... this puts a smile on my face.
I love Patrick Queen so much
"QUEEN


*CHECKMATE*"
Lmao surprised by the ravens going for it on 4th?? You haven’t been paying attention
Lamar Murray is having a hard time putting touch on the ball today.
"Ugh, Lamar has looked real bad on the long touch passes all year, and this is game 5. Can't beat good teams if you can't take advantage when your receivers are wide open down the field."
"Yo is it just me, or has Lamar been struggling with his passes this season compared to last? What's going on with him?"
I need to stay out of this sub man people fucking freak out if everything doesn't go *perfectly*
Pernell > Judon for 5% of the cost
I swear they pass to Boyd just to activate our collective PTSD sometimes
Burrow might die this year. Constant pressure
Our defense is better than the Steelers D
Wtf is up with them not giving Dobbins touches?
we keep letting free rushers off the edge! OBJ gotta clean that up
Lamar is off today maybe lack of practice
Lamar needs to make adjustments to the line when he sees the corner/lbs blitzing. Too many free blitzers today
We are so hilariously bad on bootlegs lol
Our run defense has looked pretty good this year
Burrow's looking like Kyle Boller.
"Greg's mind: Oh dobbins, Duv and Edwards are playing well for us! Let me not utilize them anymore and see what happens!"
"Damn it hurts me to say this because I love Ingram, but I don’t think he should be the RB1 anymore if we have Gus and Dobbins playing like this"
"Yo this dude's lost it. Get him outta here.

First the whole Murray thing, now he thinks and INT is a completion..."
Seriously Jk does fucking work and then they just throw way too many times and expect it to work??? Lamar looking very meh today too
Lamar sucks right now
"That pick was overdue, sadly. Play before the screen was almost intercepted, and Mandrews prevented the other one."
Feels like it should be 40-0
Imma need Lamar to work overtime next week on throwing and his chemistry with other receivers.
Lamar looks like he missed practice this week.
It’s clear that Ingram isn’t explosive enough to work as well behind this line because it’s weaker this year. We need to use the speed advantage JK and Gus gives to hit the outside where our better Oline men are.
"Man our offense hasn't been itself since week 2. Fortunately being ""not ourselves"" is still enough to beat most teams, but we're capable of being so much better"
We should have at least 27 right now
HE HAD ONE JOB!!! FIRE JUSTIN TUCKER!!!! TRADE HIM!!!! WHAT A FRAUD!!!!! s/
"Hollywood almost had that TD, would help the offensive stats look better. Not that they’re bad"
"A mic caught someone calling Flacco a ‘fucking idiot’ in the cardinals-jets game. Get ready to riot, Flock"
JK Dobbins needs more touches. 2nd and 8 is getting old.
I'm convinced lamar's knee is not 100%. He would have run the ball more.
Has Lamar even ran once this game?
Last year we would be winning by 50. The only difference is we don't zone read anymore.
"Patriots entire offence is built around snapping it and throwing it quickly, we seem to refuse to utilize any of that. Why not throw boykin a slant for 5 yards or an out to snead once in a while if we refuse to run it"
We need faster routes . The plays take way to long to develop . We simply don’t have the  oline for long developing plays to work or receivers
elliot!! clean sack!
"Elliott to Burrow:

#WE LIVE IN A SOCIETY

#BOTTOM TEXT"
NO SHIT DUMB BEL.  YOU DO KEEP SAYING MURRAY.
Why do I keep saying Murray? Lmao
I have a theory: GRo is calling the game this way to get us more game experience trying to score by passing while we're comfortably ahead instead of only doing that when we are losing and *need* to score by passing
“Why I’m keep saying Murray?” Lmaoo
Dude just said coverage sack. What sack?
I don’t understand why Lamar has 35 pass attempts
Wtf a coverage sack?? He threw the ball
"Fuck it, keep throwing until they get it right"
Coverage sack on and incomplete pass 🤔🤔🤔
"‘It was a coverage sack’

.... on a play that wasn’t a sack. Man these announcers are every bit as bad as this sub has been saying"
Defence is the reason we’re winning this one. Offence has looked choppy today
Mp juiceman with an int sack and FF wtf
“Why do I keep saying Murray?”
"is our pass rush fixed?

or are the bengals just very very bad"
Offense needs to put a drive together here
The optimist in me is going to say Lamar isn’t 100% healthy and this game won’t define him going forward.
">""Roman deserves a lot of credit""

Tf are the announcers smoking? Roman's sucked all season. Next to Judon and the O line, Roman's the biggest weakness"
Heaven is a Lamar Jackson/Joe Flacco double box on Redzone
Judon is a net negative
Something about our offense seems really off this season
Lol that was clearly a false start
Judon? Offsides? Never!
"LETS GO, WELCOME TO THE AFC NORTH JOE BURROW!!!!

They are terrorizing him, he looks frightened out there. What a sad excuse of an offensive line."
RUN THE BALL
Burrows gonna have nightmares where he just sees flashes of purple.
How many woulda-been picks has Lamar thrown today? 4?
Lamar must be hurt or sick or something.
Worried about our offense.
"Queen's first TD.

Also Marlon doing Marlon shit.  Not even excited about that, him not having a strip is more a disappointment at this point.  Dude has us spoiled for sure."
Marlon Humphry would pickpocket your scrotum if he thought there was a ball in there to steal.
"I fucking love Humphrey

And add Queen to that list!"
"If the offense wont do it, then the defense will do it."
Our defence is better offence than our offence
Humphrey is the best player in the league at forcing fumbles
Humphrey makes me MOIST
Fruit Punch —> Queen TD love to see it!!!
KILLA QUEEN
Man our offense has been struggling but this defense is fucking insane
Man lets keep things positive this is a blow out! Too much negativity surrounding a big win. LETS GOOO
Keys to success: Target Marlon Humphrey... ? Lol
"Marlon signed da ting and kept producing instead of taking it easy like some of these high prices guys, love to see it."
"Marlon’s deal is already looking like a steal, holy shit"
Marlon is the Best NFL CB no doubt he’s fucking insane
Where was this defense against the Chiefs?
Let's go Eagles
Ferguson / bowser / madbuike all had a really good game today.
"Damn it, I dont want them to score any points"
Can we ever have decent play by play guys or...????
I also need the eagles and raiders win their games today
"Happy don't have to see our offense come back and ""play"". Offense desperately needs to find its stride or we wont be beating elite teams."
I can’t figure out if Kyler Murray is good or not
Ravens radio announcers are saying this cowardly kick deserves to get blocked and returned for a touchdown lol
Zac Taylor would bunt in a perfect game
You have a rookie fucking QB against one of the best defenses on the league and you don't try and score? That's horrible coaching
Uhhhhh Lamar is limping....
RG-III saving Lamar from a negative yard game.
"AHAHAHAHA

Get FUCKED, Chiefs."
Man I hate this settling for field goals shit.
Lamar has just looked poorly at times this season.
"Now that Tucker missed one, the announcers can stop trying to jinx the rest of his kicks"
Never been so worried about a 4-1 team in my life
"It's not ""spoiled"" to want your MVP QB and offense to play better, not even to mention this is 3 weeks in a row of the offense not looking very good."
Lamar looks like dog shit today. He should have 3 picks thrown.
Maybe we should admit Lamar has looked bad this season
"Since Lamar Jackson became the starter in Wk 11, 2018, BAL has scored 20+ pts in 28 straight regular-season gms, tying the “Greatest Show on Turf” Rams ('99-'00) for the 2nd-longest such streak in NFL history

P. Manning's Broncos (30 straight gms '12-'14) have the longest streak - @NFLResearch"
good day. i in europe. i like america. i like the hand egg game what you call football and i like hot dog too. i like the ravens football club. i cheer and scream at my screen playing an interweb stream of ravens club football. i hope ravens win. i think ravens win. good day
"Bro I have done so much today already I lifted chest and tris, ran a 5k swept mopped and did the dishes wtf is wrong with me"
Was that a sack for Judon?
Big play.  First end around ran successfully in years.
let’s use duvernay more he’s a weapon
He should have gone under.
"I never understood hearing 49ers and Bill's fans' complaints about Roman. They always said though that his first year with them he was great, then after that fell off a cliff. 

So far this year, I see exactly what they mean."
Lamar needs to trust his other receivers Duv was open!
"Defense is not gelled, offense is off and Lamar has not stepped up in the pass game.
Edit - still a very good team. But not as good as late 2019. Gotta step up and gel."
Burrow surprisingly athletic
Gotta finish these sacks man ugggggh
I’ll never forgive Tyler Boyd...
I think Duv has a better chance of being WR1 for us than Boykin
"That was such a huge play by Queen there, I fucking love this guy"
"What the fuck is up with our play calling? Why do we never run the ball, or atleast run tradional passes (like sluggo, slants, floods)"
Our route combinations make 0 sense sometimes
Can these announcers stop calling Lamar Jackson Murray
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST HIS NAME IS NOT MURRAY
Murray Count: 4
I can tell Lamar is having less fun than last year lol
Can we actually get this announcer fired post game this is actually pathetic you wouldn’t expect a teacher to come in and teach the wrong names
#LAMAR MURRAY
That was an absolute dart by Lamar
They need to scheme plays not intended for Andrews or Hollywood more. Lol.
Fuck all football teams from Ohio
Ah the classic 10-0 ravens lead
"IDK what happened but why did this offence switch from what was working last year.  No read options, a lot less pre snap motion, and the only pass plays are unoriginal or seam routs to Mandrews.  If they shut down Mark we have no passing targets."
the baltimore murrays are my favorite team
Murray almost broke one
Omfg with this Murray bullshit
"Someone needs to tell that guy his name is Jackson, it's on the back of his damn jersey"
Kyler looks taller than I remember.
Mandrews came to FUCKING PLAY
"It’s not like Lamars a famous player, or even the one guy people would know on our team"
Lamar be launching the ball like a rocket
So yeah. Like I said earlier. Best quarter (and 10 seconds) of football this team has played this season.
All i have is redzone today and they just keep casually cutting to the Ravens absolutely destroying them lmao
Judon is so trash.
#YASSS QUEEN!!!
Queen just smashed his old qb and got the TO. 😂😂💪💪
Judon? More liek Judoff.
Queen’s such a baller
LSU on LSU action
QUUUUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Jesus we're murdering them
Queen is a statsheet hero
Queen got his sack fumble on Burrow
QUEEN JUST FUCKING KILLED JOE
Patrick Murray with the hit on Burrow
PATRICK FUCKING QUEEN!
Queen is playing like he knows the QB. Pretty interesting how much he's popping this game. Guess it makes sense.
Lightning Mc(Patrick)Queen
"Oh. My. God.

What a hit.  Poor kid didn’t even feel it coming, he’s running for his life out there."
Queen heard yall was talkin shit
"Take a swing at Queen now, Joey boi"
Scott Hanson: “ apparently queen and burrow didn’t get along at LSU”
"Lamar's gotta start looking for his other receivers man. If we're gonna pass 45 times a game, we gotta at least try to change this shit up"
"Needed a better throw, but should have punted"
Throwing a low percentage pass on 4th and 6 near midfield? Questionable to say the least.
That pass right there is the one Lamar has to hit
Take notes judon
"Holy shit, the Bengals are trash. I know that's not that surprising, but I assumed they'd improved as their results so far didn't look too bad. Nah, utter trash."
I thought our Oline needed help... Jesus
Bengals like so bad it makes our shitty pass rush look great
I know all games are not equal but this a good sign considering how close the browns played the bengals imo
If we blowing them out by mid 3rd Quarter hopefully they take Burrow out not tryna see the rook get injured lmao
FEED GUS. We need to feed him early in games!
Feed My boy gus and he will make 30 minutes disappear
"Up 17 on a bad team is the time to try out a few things and establish some touches. I want to see some Duv, Proche and Dobbins -- even Ricard."
Lamar throwing like Burrow out here
That was a meaty tackle.
Missing Yanda. But we knew he was going to retire eventually. Hopefully Tyre steps up his game or someone else does. Need better protection
You know the announcers are trash when they compliment the Bengals D for keeping them in the game when the ravens D is shutting out the other side.
proche looks good so far
Was that the theme music from The Wire
Alex smith is in. It's a ravens sub but that's still crazy
THROBBIN FOR DOBBINS!
Dobbins doesn't like to go down. Dude is a strong runner.
Why are they still passing so damn much?
Gumbel called it complete? what a terrible announcer
Queen is fucking FLYING
Can we start a GoFundMe for a cannon we can launch Roman out of? These play calls are beyond pathetic all season.
We should have more than 17 damn points
Lamar is playing awful but luckily our defense is playing lights out that we are still blowing them out
"Up by 17 and Lamar’s on pace for 50 passes, go Roman go"
God damn our defense is playing lights out though arent they
And y’all wonder why Greg Roman is always bouncing around... dudes not very good
Defense helping out offense. That's what it's about.
"Lamar’s definitely not 100% today Luckily, we don’t need him to turn Super Saiyan this week."
Madubuike has impressed me so far
These halftime guys are not watching the game lol
The only thing that made me mad about Tucker missing is that it’s going to fuck up his overall percentage
Are any of y'all from the Flacco-Cam Cameron era? We did this all the time back then. We went pass heavy against bad teams because the coaches know that in the play-offs that's what it's going to come down to. Lamar is going to have to win games with his arm. I'd rather we have trial runs and error now so we're prepared when we need it.
Can anyone tell me why Lamar has 30 pass attempts in a half in a game we're up 17-0
O-Line is fucking dogshit
Bro what is this offense lol
"We’re doing that thing where we don’t run again, huh"
"This offense is sad right now. No easy throws, no one open when Lamar is actually getting some time. Uninspired playcalling and poor execution."
"People are frustrated because these issues we've been seeing with the Ravens have been lingering issues. And those issues cost them the game vs a legit playoff contender. People are just frustrated because it feels like the Ravens haven't been playing to their full potential (I get that they're winning, but this is still a bit concerning)."
"So they're just not going to run the ball anymore, huh? I don't understand the strategy here. This team is built to run. Everything is predicated on the run. What is Roman doing?"
Lamar threw in the first half as much as he used to throw in an entire game. I'm hoping this is just a plan to get him passing reps since we are still winning games as is.
Fort should've picked that off tbh
McPhee has had a hell of a game
">.@Patrickqueen_ is the second @Ravens rookie to record a sack, FF and FR in a game, joining Terrell Suggs, who accomplished the feat three times during his 2003 Defensive Rookie of the Year campaign. - @PMGleason"
"Greg Roman got kidnapped by Marty Mornhinweg, and the Greg we see before us now is Marty disguised as Greg..."
THAT IS WHAT THEY CALL HOLDING ON????
"""why do I keep saying Murray?""

YOU FUCKING TELL ME!!"
Even Gumbel doesn't know why he's calling Lamar Murray.
THATS the Lamar Jackson I’m used to!
I think gus killed that guy
I HATE INJURY
lmao at the ref
these announcers are terrible.  coverage sack?  he threw incomplete
That’s where not having a #1 kills you
Like I get were winning.....but this is not striking a ton of confidence.
I feel bad for burrow honestly
At least the defense is balling out today
Our defense really showed up today.  And they are finally taking QBs down and just touching them lightly
"THE BENGALS ARE LITERALLY GIVING US THE GAME.

PLEASE CAPITALIZE NOW. K THX"
Greg Roman would be the worst head coach in the league. Has absolutely no poise and composure.
How does Lamar have 33ish pass attempts with the Bengals being scoreless? Is our passing game this bad?
Yall need to understand that we dont run because we know we can. We need to fix the passing plays
Elite dragon passing TD
"3rd and 3, RUN TWICE!!"
lamar bb wtf are u doing
"Sigh. It's 3rd and 3, they're averaging 3 yards per carry. Let's pass..."
Do Boykin and Lamar hate each other?
"Well on the bright side we keep the streak of scoring in every quarter this season alive, at least until the 4th quarter."
What are you doinnnnnnn boykin
Boykin is pure trash. Bench him omg
Not a overthrow or a bad route. Just obvious miscommunication
"Obvi I would still like to see a turnaround from boykin, but frankly I just don't see toughness. I don't see a competitor. You can see it in the way he holds himself even, he holds his arms kinda loose. He could be a good player for us if he just had some grit and energy. Really disappointing waste of physical potential."
"Bruh, bench Burrow before he gets killed"
Who the hell is gilchrist
I'm starting to feel bad for burrow lol
Let’s see some dobbins action this drive
24-24 KC v LV... don’t know what makes me more angry. Blowing out a team but still unsatisfied. Or watching Carr keep more composure than the entire Ravens organization.
"Ravens defence playing well, there’s that"
"Lamar, Lamar, Lamar..."
This reminds me of watching 2000 Ravens games
This is abysmal play-calling from the offense wtf man
"Lamar has been so rough today, but our defence has been phenomenal"
Our defense is having so much fun dominating
"This isn't about an injury. Lamar isn't seeing underneath defenders at all. This is a reps issue... lack of preparedness. 

Those 2 missed practices in a row are looming large rn."
Humphrey is a god at forcing fumbles.
Greg Roman owes Wink a steak dinner for carrying this game
FRUIT PUNCH!
MARLO PUNCH!
Jesus Christ Humphrey.  You're a god.
God I am glad we paid him.
Good god marlon
Patrick Queen has more TDs than former teammate Joe Burrow today
"Marlon Humphrey and forcing fumbles, name a more iconic duo

I'll wait"
MARLO FOR DPOY
Name one player in NFL history better at forcing fumbles. Im completely serious here.. is there anyone? It's fucking uncanny
Marlon is just nuts
YAS QUEEN!!! Defense really stepping up rn ahah
Wow Marlon is talented
WHAT AN ANIMAL 44
Marlo showing again why hes worth the big bucks
Best fucking player on the Ravens period.
Bengals laying down at this point
KC is tied with LV at the start of the 4th. I think this team is showing to be FAR less than last year’s team ended. The plus side is that last year the team was ALSO looking bad early - almost losing to a Duck lead Pit in OT
"Lamar needs to play this game out and a least get TD to get some confidence back, hope Harbs realizes this."
C'mon LV and PHL.  We need your help.
False fucking start hahahaha
"""False fucking start"" lol"
That’s a horrible spot
Pussy shit right there
Zach Taylor trying to polish a turd.
"RIP shutout.

1 PM - 3:58 PM"
"Ofc Philly misses the field goal, ofc"
Welp philly fucked that for us...
Glad this shitshow is over. Good job defense.
GET RG3'ED
Let's go Eagles!
Eagles fucked it
Some of ya’ll are clearly new fans forreal. Y’all really on suicide watch from that 1st half?
Harbs get Boykin off the fucking field
Lamar could lowkey lead the league in picks with all the dropped ones this season
"Im drunk, so ready for any downvotes, but fuck me Lamar. Get your shit together."
"What do people want from Roman? 55 runs today? The way I see it, this game is a locked up win. Why not to try get some LIVE PRACTICE with personnel, formations, and plays they may not be very comfortable with? This is how teams grow. Good passing offenses won’t just pop up without the reps. 

Everyone chill out and stop complaining about a 17 point lead. Spoiled ass sub."
"Lamar was out most of the week. He lost a friend. He was ill. He had a knee injury. It’s been raining and the field is wet. 

GuYS LaMar RegReSsiN

He’s younger than Joe Burrow for fucks sake and his ceiling is phenomenal. He threw dart TDs. Good lord."
Lamar again just not locked in like last year. Maybe it’s Lamar/Andrews connection. But something is not going the same.
Burrow spends more time on his back than Riley Reid
Im only worried about Lamar because this is the 3rd week he has looked bad and today is objectively his worst regular season performance. Bad decisions. 4 dropped INTs. Straight up not seeing defenders.
"Fuck the browns, fuck the steelers and fuck the bengals"
Anyone else see Lama’s story? Looks like a homie of his passed away. RIP.
Gannon just said we’ve always been good at rushing the passer...did he forget to prepare for this game?
Did Hollywood just not pick that up? Or did he make a business decision there?
We leave so many points on the board by trying to constantly force passes when the run game is working.
I think lamar is focusing too much on his main targets. Much like aaron rodgers with davante adams last year
The broadcasting crew sucks. No replay on the two incompletions.
Lamar needs to learn there are other receivers besides Andrews and Hollywood
Peters isn’t the same this year or am I just 1st quartet overreacting. Lol prob the latter
Bruh if Campbell hit burrows he would of ko him lol
Queen was not letting burrow run
They went for fucking 4th instead of kicking for 3  lmao they’re here to beat our ass.
[deleted]
Lamar throws ropes sidearm. My god
Hollywood still avoiding hits
"Someone has to teach Hollywood how to run after the catch, he always turns his body up field and looks around a bunch"
More targets for DUV!!!
"He blocc, he attacc, he flip on over to his bacc"
3rd time he's called him Murray now.
Anyone else hear Murray everytime Lamar drops back to pass?
"I love the color commentator calling him ""Lamar Jackson"" as often as possible like... Do you hear me? Lamar? JACKSON?"
I’m gonna try to keep a Murray count. We’re up to 4 and it’s the first quarter.
This announcer keeps saying Murray right?
Gumbel is drunk lmao
"Bro Lamar is like a foot taller than Murray and wears #8, cmon man"
He keeps calling Llama Murray
Lamar mURraY
It is to the point where it's going to need a face to camera apology. wtf so awkward. THIS IS NOT KYLER MURRAY
"The other commentator keeps enunciating ""Lamar Jackson"" when he says Murray lmao"
"I don’t know why this offense doesn’t look as good as last year, but Lamar is clearly not having as much fun."
Why won’t we run read option this season? We were able to freeze so many defenders last year...
I LOVE LAMAR MURRAY
#BIG BOI NO LITTLE BOI MANDREWS
Ingram just isn't getting it done guys.
Murray Count: 6
let’s go baltimore ravens quarterback kyler murray
Mandrews means Murray to Andrews
Lol now this dipshit calling him Murray is a part of the TD highlight
Kyler Jackson's team up 7-0 against the Jets.
"Oh god CBS just showed Kyler Murray on screen, Gumbel is screwed now"
Okay D lets get murray back on the field
STOP CALLING HIM MURRAY YOU IDIOT
"This is why Marcus ""Murray"" Peters plays so far off receivers."
Still calling him Murray this out out of control
"Peters has that Ed Reed style instinct. He's not quite as rangey, but he's got the same knack for knowing where the ball is going and putting himself into the perfect position, even when it's not his assignment.

Both are notorious for film study, which owes a lot of it."
I think that is the 7th time he has called him Murray
How is he still calling him Murray? Is he trolling us?
I know he’s not a safety but Marcus Peters really reminds me of Ed Reed. Don’t you dare throw a sloppy pass anywhere near him
Does Gumbel have memory issues? for real
All Murray and no Murray makes Murray a Murray Murray
Why the hell hasn’t someone told gumble yet
"Damn, I wanted to get 17 before the 2nd quarter"
A man who expressed his frustration at only being a 3rd down player. Commits a penalty on first down for 15. Maybe your coaches were right
The Bengals feeling how we did watching Kelce vs us. Literally unstoppable right now
Thank you Dunlap for that dumb RTP. Taking the heat off our bad Read Options this year.
"Mandrews getting alot of action so far this game, this season even. I think he will pass his 10 TDs from last year"
not gonna lie. That call was soft.
Lamar to Mandrews is lethal
"Murray troll aside:

Make Duvernay a starter. He already looks so much better than Boykin.

Conventional football theory says we need a tall outside receiver. Well, fuck that. Just start our play makers who also have the best hands? Makes sense to me..."
Calling Lamar Murray is starting to get a little disrespectful how do you forget the MVP's last name ...
This game will feature RG3 in mop up duty
"A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says “hey. We have a drink named after you!”

The grasshopper says, “you have a drink called Murray?”"
what a sexy throw by murray
Of course Hollywood gets a TD when I finally give up and sit him on the bench
"NGL, Baker's a pretty good actor xD"
Has Hollywood got Maryland flag gloves on?
Missed sack by Judon
Bro that's holding you cant block someone in the back wtf
Queen FF and recovery what a beast
#FUMBLE!!! RECOVERED BY PATRICK MURRAY!!!!
"Life, uh, finds a way"
Queen is a MONSTER!
Judon for JJ str8 up.
DROY.
Mental built by Taco Bell
Judon playing 8d chess with getting better field position there
Jesus. Burrow has zero protection lmao
Queen got enough to brag about on the stat sheet in just one play
Holy shit he forced and recovered the fumble
Nice job not ripping his spine out unnecessarily. I know they were teammates but that takes restraint.
Queen's speed is ridiculous
Queen has been balling recently
Welcome to the nfl
Burrow might actual get killed by the Steelers.
We threw 4 times in a row. What the fuck is Roman’s deal?
Whatever happened to fake hand offs to Ingram and then Lamar running for 10 every time
"I'm really not liking what I'm seeing from Lamar's passing recently, not sure what's up but he seems more off than usual"
These announcers are beyond annoying today
"I’m trying not to be too pessimistic but this team looks so unimpressive every week despite winning easily every week except 1. Last year they absolutely dominated every week, this year the scoreboard says they’re dominating but it doesn’t feel like it."
I feel kinda bad for burrow tbh this isnt even fair
This is the worst oline
Burrow's welcome to the AFCN.
I thought our line struggles...
"If only I wasn’t playing against Ravens d/st this week lol

/s of course, happy watching Bungles get smashed even at the cost of my fantasy team"
Joe getting abused back there and the first half isn’t even over lol
I want Duv and Hollywood to have a game against the steelers that secondary looks super suspect lmao
lamar wtf don't just lob it up like that
smh line
Wtf is going on? They’ve had a lot of free rushers the last few drives
What in the hell was that throw
Greg needs to do some soul searching
That’s the 4th or 5th time today that’s no one has even chipped the outside rusher.
Pay Bowser and let Judon walk
Burrow’s hard count hurting his team more than helping lol
#run d is back baby
Now that was a good throw Lamar
"So is Greg Roman using this game as practice to work on pass plays? 

Why do we have so many pass attempts up by 17 lol"
Wtf was that lamar? One of the worst passes i’ve ever seen from him
Good lord Jackson and accuracy do not belong together today.
Dobbins 2 10+ yard runs......then pass pass horrific pass. What the fuck is this? Ive turned on roman.
"If I’m the Bengals I’m just handing to Mixon three times and punting. Burrow’s going to
Die."
Raiders came back wtf
Tucker 69 yarder plz
That was some excellent clock management
I think we should be up by way more if Lamar was on his A-game
Score should be much higher but our offense feels so awkward
" Damn JT.

Still the best kicker tho, dw about it ❤️"
Can’t blame Tucker for a 61 yard miss. Few can manage that.
God straight up hated on Tucker’s kick because he’s jealous
I blame god for tucker missing that kick
"Lamar has never had a worse half than that one from an interceptable pass standpoint. 3 clear cut ones & another that could've been charted as interceptable. 1 was intercepted. 2 happened on b2b plays. 

Missed practice time might be a reason for this. Inaccuracy is 1 thing. Throwing the ball right to defenders? He doesn't normally do that."
There have been a LOT of interceptable passes by Lamar in this game.
Every ingram run is under 4 yard...when was his last good run?
Offense looks confused as fuck
Our route concepts are h o r r i b l e
Watson commercial is cringey.
"Game MVP is gonna be a tossup between Queen, Bowser, and McPhee."
The lack of plays under center is highly concerning.  I'm honestly tired of seeing do many plays from the Gun sigh
What happened to Roman? He lost a lot of urgency when play calling. The offense is really just lethargic and doesn’t seem to care.
Chase claypool with 3 TDs so far. Why do the steelers always nail their WR picks while we wind up with people like boykin?
Our DB have looked way better blitzing without Earl
Wink calling a really good game.
Run ball plz?? Gus Bus? Dobbins? Plz?? :D
This is the worst I've ever felt while winning 17-0. Offence looks dreadful today
WHO THE FUCK IS MURRAY
How the hell does this commentator have a job?
He's become self aware!
That might have been Lamar’s most impressive play of the season
i miss u yanda ):
Ingram looks completely cooked this year. Please have Dobbins starting moving forward.
Hollywood with 20 YAC. Love to see it.
Imagine if Marquise was a dog like his cousin and took defenders on every run. He would be so fucking good.
Baker Mayfield might have the biggest ad campaign in sports history.
Lamar really needs to start playing better if we want to make it far this season. Think he’s just in a little rut rn
"Defense playing great...but I just checked DVOA and bengals are rank #21 run defense and our main 2 backs have been trash. This definitely isn't a good sign going forward. This is deeper than ""coaches won't run the ball""."
"*throws incompletion*

""Well that's a coverage sack right there"""
Those plays are where Lamar used to just take it up the middle but he isn't doing it anymore. I don't understand.
"Okay can we legit fire GRo after this game? His game plan is dogshit even with the score the way it is our defense is playing amazing today and we should have way more than 17 on the Bungles

It’s like dobbins and Gus don’t exist"
AJ Green contemplating retirement in real time on sideline
That looked straight out of madden
People focusing so much on how our offense is playing like shit but not on how phenomenal our defense is playing against the Bengals who have had a decent offense this season.
Isn’t it a penalty to hit the ball out of bounds like the RB did?
"Lmao the punting team really be saying ""let's go"" after each punt????? We're like at the 30.....bruh"
I love Marcus Peters. Playmaker central who’s always bringing the energy and fire every game.
"Running is working too well, we must stop immediately"
It truly is incredible how efficient we are when we run. Roman’s playcalling has been so puzzling this year.
"""Well guys, I guess Ingram sucks, right?"" - Guys in this thread."
"I think this proves what many of us have been saying. 

Our offense could have gone to this dominant run game at any point today. It’s our bread and butter and we know it works. 
 
Let’s work on our passing game while we are up 17."
Fuck you boykin
The passing game is shit today
Boykin quitting on another route?
If Boykin kept running while getting held right there he probably could've got a call. Instead he gives up
Greg Roman sucks soooo much with our offense this year.
Someone tell Judon there is no franchise tag bonus for jumping off sides multiple times a game.... 🤦‍♂️
You guys are killing me on here. Appears to me Lamar isn’t close to 100%. Impacts the game a lot.
"Burrow has been sacked approximately 83 times this game alone, poor guy"
Our DBs have 4 sacks wtf
Lmao I feel like everyone on this team got a sack today except for Judon
You have to throw to the purple jerseys Lamar
Lamar...
Dude what is Lamar doing....
good thing the bengals can't catch ints lol
"Lamar, bud, you gotta do better"
Is Lamar looking before he throws pr is he just saying fuck it? Dude hasn't looked good in a minute.
"It's fucking raining and a 20-0 game in the fourth, why are you throwing on 1st down"
We've had like three near picks. Jackson needs to play sharper than this
Why are we throwing the ball so damn much?
"Lamar was walking odd at the end of that play, I really don't think he's healthy"
The fact we aren't going for it on 4th and 2 with how our defense is playing today says a lot about how bad the offense is playing
Lamar's Week 5 stats are terrible two weeks in a row lol.
MARLON STRIKES YET AGAIN
MARLOOOOO
Humph is one of the best CBs in this league and needs to be respected
FOURTY FUCKING FOUR YOU BEAUTY
FRUIT PUNCH. Scooped up by Queen!!  This D is lethal!!!
**FRUIT PUNCH**
YAAAAAAAAAASSS QUEEEEEEEEEN
"Humphrey, player of the game."
Marlon is * *chefs kiss* *
MARLON THE GOATTTTTTTT
Good ball extraction
Fruit punch
FRUIT PUNCH!
Marlon the extractor
Big brain thinking from the defense: Don’t have to hold your breath for the offense if they never even get the ball.
Marrrrrrrrlooooo
Does Marlon have a turnover in every game this season so far?
Humphrey doing some LeonardoDiCaprio inception type extraction
Marlon dpoy and queen droy
Queen for DROY
Okay let's hit burrow some more now. Still not satisfied man im still frustrated from the previous weeks
Please hand Pittsburgh a loss.
I wonder how much Corona (the beer company) has been hurt by Coronavirus lol. Like I would love to know if they've faced any challenges solely due to their name.
"MP Juiceman, Queen, Campbell, Humphrey. Defence has a bright future"
Why are so many kickers kissing extra points?? Really raiders against KC 🤦🏼
Basically Harbs wanted a very long timeout....D is prolly gassed after than fumble return
One Punch Marlon
Wow he's actually apologizing lol
Campbell got the tackle THROUGH the olineman
Damn I guess were not getting the shutout
Dont let them scooooorrre.
"Remember when we couldn't catch a break against the Bengals?
We couldn't beat them to save our lives?"
That's a generous spot
I agree with Gannon.  Give Burrow the chance to pass.
Raiders are impressive as fuck
Gave up the shutout.  Defense in shambles /s
"59 minute shutout

fugggggg"
Pussy ass FG. Pathetic
So they did get RG3d.
Go RAIDERS!!!
"The Eagles suck and are $68m over the cap next year, with 44 players under contract.  Yikes"
Nice so Judon has missed a sack and nullified our interception on this drive. He's lucky he just got bailed out by Queen.
"Judon is like a mediocre blowjob, I'm not mad that he's on the team but he sucks and doesn't get close to the sack"
"Bad pass. If the pass is on point, that's a big gain or potentially 6."
Man these threads are cringy. It’s like people expect a touchdown on every drive? We are beating a division opponent 17-0 and we are about to get the ball.
"We can be enjoying success and still be critical of players and coaches. Smd with all this ""spoiled"" shit. You think Harbaugh is satisfied with how the offense has looked? I really doubt it"
"Unpopular opinion:

Greg Roman has called a good game so far"
#CutBoykin
[deleted]
"#Fire Roman.

Tbh we all know it. Dude's made awful calls all season. Losing to Kc would be understandable, but we could've had a shot if we weren't so horrifically outcoached. Aside from the O line, Roman's the biggest liability and everyone knows it."
[deleted]
Bengals fan coming in peace. Is it normal for commentators to call lamar jackson murray?
Ok we dont have the WORST offensive line. Lmao
Judon is the new subreddit punching bag for the defense
What a crisp offensive performance all around
This is not a SB winning offense
Run run run
Here’s to a good game day with no injuries on either side friends! CAW CAW!
Hey guys Im doing a short research survey for school and would greatly appreciate it if you could complete this (only 8 questions) https://forms.gle/3PkJG79rs4FkNDgz6
I hope the offense can get it going early in this one.
Actually great play by judon
That punt sketched me out more than it needed to
Judons gonna get 4 sacks this game and use it to leverage $$$
Welp looks like ima be watching this game from the toilet had some chicken enchiladas and a bean burrito for lunch
Roman reads Ravens sub Reddit confirmed
Duvernay was open :/
I’ll take points to start the game while getting the ball to start the 2nd half
Tucker goin for a perfect season
Shit drive despite the Duvernay end around. But I'll take it. Good to get points on the first drive.
Sometimes you take the easy play. Plus that looked like Duv who would’ve had room to run. Cmon Lamar
Anyone else pay extra attention to tucker's motion after that post yesterday?
"This may not be a popular opinion, but im happy we have been a little pass happy in these games.  Come playoffs or against elite teams, it needs to be something we can do."
Feel like Snead was open but Lamar tried to force it to Hollywood in double coverage. Then Duvernay was open but Lamar tried to force it to Andrews in double coverage.
how did he possibly gain yards
Burrow looking almost Lamar-esque there...
Seeing Campbell sprinting at you 👁👄👁
Should have been a easy sack and punt. now we gotta worry about giving up the 4th down.
[deleted]
Oof. Boyd could've had that. Queen is faaaaast.
Imagine if Duv took it all the way on that 40 yard run
Nice job by Queen to make him throw
"Rookie qb + Suspect OLine = a good day for our DLine

...BUT YOU GOTTA FINISH THESE TACKLES lmao"
Ravens’ 4th down attempts > Bungholes’ 4th down attempts
thank god for queen cause that would've been an easy first
I get he’s small but you gotta actually try to get some yards..
Hollywood is soft
Lamar's really off on his throws this year.
"Duvernay, plz be our WR1"
Holy crap he actually threw it to Duv
Murray?
Who the fuck is Murray
Murray again dude??
Who is Murray??
"Not a Ravens fan, can anyone tell me when Lamar Jackson changed his last name?"
How tf you announce an NFL game and not know the name of last years unanimous MVP?
mUrRaY
Greg gumbel is getting on my nerves. How does a producer not say anything.
Gumbel is a fucking moron
Lamar’s pocket poise on that 3rd and 14 was absolutely fantastic. His patience allowed Andrews to get open.
I'm surprised we're taking our time... I'm not convinced that was clearly a first
MuRraYyy
Did this bitch say Murray again?
"Fuck it, Lamar Murray for MVP."
Murray Count: 5
"MURRAY MURRAY MURRAY MURRAY MURRAY 

How is a producer or Rich not correcting him??"
Lamar just casually telling Harbs what's up.
For fucks sake Gumbal is making me miss the Fouts/Eagle booth and thats saying something.
I can already see the Lamar “Murray” player of the game posts
Also DPI and holding like FUCK
Murray to andrews
"How is this guy still saying Murray, how has no one on the broadcast team said something..."
Murray with a TD on his second drive glad we signed the guy
That was def defensive holding.  But Andrews a beast
TOUCHDOWN BALTIMORE MURRAYS!
Who’s better? Lamar Murray or Lamar Jackson?
Idk how hard it is to say Jackson
TOUCHDOWN
That's a full grown MANdrews.
Greg Roman: let’s abandon the run now we have a 10 point lead
Guys when are we gonna pay Kyler for throwing these TDs to Mandrews all the way from Arizona?
INTERCEPTION BY MARCUS MURRAY!
Someone fire Gumbel at halftime please. Or have a producer at least correct him
Murray again wtf
How has there not been someone yelling in Gumbel’s headset about calling him Murray?
 Can this ancient fuck not hear the other commentator calling him Lamar Jackson every time?
"Marcus Peters' interception marks the 18th straight game that the Ravens have forced a turnover, the longest active streak in the NFL.  During that streak, Peters has had five interceptions and one fumble recovery."
7 MURRAYS
that call was soft as hell lmao
FLACCO IN FOR JETS
Who the fuck is Murray?????
That was a super soft call
Looks like Andrews brought his hands today.
Pretty weak call but I guess we'll take it
Been a while since I've seen a team implode before the end of the first quarter. 😂
Mandrews is just unstoppable sometimes
Having Mandrews on fantasy>>> 💪🏽
"I think Gumble has a bet with Gannon for how many times he can slip ""Murray"" into the broadcast, like that ""meow"" scene from Super Troopers"
It’s great that Andrews is balling the fuck out today but We need to target someone else man. We’re fortunate enough the bengals are still the bengals but real teams are going to play better on Andrews. We need everyone to be a weapon like mahomes makes everyone a weapon
"Okay on one hand I’m happy he said *Lamar Jackson* for once. But on the other hand, you don’t get to call him *Murray* seven times and not address it with a “my bad”"
It still blows my mind how Murray was elected the unanimous MVP in his rookie season.
Lamar Murray and Justin Kicker looking real solid there
How has nobody corrected his boomer ass yet???
Touchdown Marques Murray! Murray to Murray baby!
"Hey look, Hollywood got his first TD of the year.  Nice.

Also, fuckin rocket he caught like it was nothing."
Yo Hollywood helmet looks like he's a DJ with a ridiculous sized helmet
Yikes.   Tucker flirting with that left upright today.
"Meet the Ravens we got:
Lamar Murray,
Mark Kamara,
Aerial Andrews ,
And Justin Kicker"
"Damn that Kyler Jackson guy on the Cardinals is looking pretty good out there, they got the lead on an ELITE QB up in NY"
Tucker is flirting with the posts lol. Why did we install those damn side scoreboards?!?! 😭
Kyler Murray will be the MVP frontrunner by the end of the game.
I swear Judons been bathing in butter before every game this season
Stop showing Chiefs highlights. I still have PTSD
File that under the  ‘Judon can only get pressure against TEs’ group
Elliot dancing
Patrick Queen is such a beast
MY QUEEEEEN!!!
My god Queen that hurt me
LSU on LSU crime!!
Hahahhaaha thats his old QB 🤣🤣🤣
Burrow having a rough day
I'm getting a Queen jersey
"If queen can get better in coverage, he’ll be a beast. I can’t wait to see him develop!"
I love queen lmao
QUEEEEEEEN
"Was just about to be really mad at Judon, but we got an even better result thanks to the Queen 😍"
Queen for President 2020
"The hit AND recovery.
Burrow looks rattled. 3 turnovers already (obviously one didn’t count)"
You know deep down that's gotta feel great to wallop your old QB teammate
"He's living on Burrowed time

&#x200B;

sorry"
Haven’t seen tiger on tiger crime like that since yesterday when Mizzou beat LSU
WELCOME TO THE LEAGUE ROOKIE
The energy by the defense rn >>>>
We’re annihilating Burrow damn
Probably felt like LSU practice again for Queen
Nothing like having a pick taken away only to get a sack fumble the next play that gives a better starting position 😂
First game burrow has looked like a rookie. Let's go flock
"Glad for us but damn, Bengals really need to invest in protecting Burrow. Beef up the line, and help him learn how to protect himself. He is getting fucking wrecked rn."
It’s amazing how we always draft elite LBs
Burrow looks like me trying to grow a beard at 17
It was tipped my babies
"Sigh, another 3 pass drive. Roman..."
What's with these underneath routes? What's the point of a route that not past the first down market on 3rd down?
Why don't we run the ball more??
Wtf was that
"Come on, how can you waste that turnover?!"
"Like going for it, but not the play call"
He was open
Greg Roman is back and here to stay baby
Also Lamar needs to learn to target people not named Andrews or Brown once in a while
There's been too many times this year that I've been unimpressed with Lamar. It's like he's reverted.
He's been over shooting quite a bit. Needs to turn it down a notch.
Lamar gotta work on his accuracy. Been off all season on those throws
"Everyone calm down, these plays are on lamar when he hits them Roman looks like a genius. We are still 4/6 on 4th and up by 17."
"lol how are people mad at Roman? He called a play that should have resulted in a score or at least a huge gain, and Lamar missed a wide open Andrews."
Omg Bengals line trash af
Bengals oline is horrible because our pass rush looks fantastic lmao
The Bengals line is so trash
Pls eagles
That Honest Thief movie I just saw a trailer for looks like someone smashed together the scripts for every single Liam Neesen movie and this is what resulted from it.
2 RUNNING PLAYS IN A ROW?? MADNESS
Gus Bus has that sweet gold mouth piece haha
Mekari looks pretty decent at guard
Not a good throw Lamar. Cmon now.
What the hell is wrong with Murray
Omg just give it to gus it’s not hard
I really feel like we should trade one of our RBs. They have way more value then the amount we use them like Gus. Gus could be a solid RB1 for a lot of teams and we should take advantage of that if we use him as our RB3
What the fuck was the protection on that drive? Not good enough oline.
Have we run even one read option yet?
Why don't we use JK we spent a second round pick on this guy
Bengals O-line is trash
defense doing it's job at least
I sometimes miss the excitement and heart burn we had before 2019
Defense has been amazing so far. Really liking what I'm seeing from Queen and Bowser in particular
That wire intro song
Diggin the subtle Wire theme thrown in there
Jackson is inches from some of these throws being lights out.
Gets saved from a pick only to throw another pick...
"Even if the defender wasn’t there, that was a terrible pass that wasn’t catchable. He’ll bounce back."
"Second time today the offense ruins a great play by a rookie. First Duv, next Dobbins"
"Queen is going to be a better linebacker for us than Mosley, fight me"
"someone rushing the punter went down and grabbed his knee, who was it"
Yeah this is just sad at this point. Poor Burrow
The biggest flaw in Lamars game is his composure you can tell when he’s frustrated and it affects his play and decision making. CALM DOWN
Someone tell Roman to give it to Dobbins.
Everyone chill on Lamar a bit he's just having an average game. That ball to Hollywood was on the money the safety just made a good play
"I'm starting to really have doubts on Greg Roman as an OC. Maybe it's too early, but this playcalling is horrid..."
"This just doesn’t feel like the same offense at all. I get losing yanda was huge, and that offenses evolve over time. But honestly this just doesn’t seem right at all. I think Roman is responsible for a lot of the blame here!"
Lamar is lucky this defense is playing really good. Hes not having the best day
The raiders might beat the chiefs
Beautiful outside throw there
I wanna see us go the length of the field and score 6.
"Damn, nice try. Plenty of leg, just a bit too much hook."
What a weird half of football.
I know the Bengals have a solid DL but there have been multiple times they have absolutely dominated in pass situations. OL still suspect in the pass game
What is up with PIT finding WR gems
Comeback player of the year: Alex Smith!
Madubuike giving the d-line a nice spark today!
Ingram needs to be 2nd or 3rd RB
[deleted]
Dobbins and Gus having good game. Ravens coaching staff hold my beer. Let’s send Ingram in.
"Dude. What the fuck kind of routes are we running, where after 5 seconds NO ONE is open?"
What is up with Lamar not running at all this game
Run play followed by two plays with long developing routes. Wtf Roman can you have one of these mfers run a slant?
"So are we just never going to run he football again?

I know I’m not an NFL coach but I seriously question our play calling this year. It doesn’t make any sense."
Defence hard carrying offence right now
Idk if Lamar is 100% guys i'm scared
DESHON
Good Lord they are just letting Burrow get murdered back there
JOKER SZN
"I'm the Joker, babyyyy"
JOKER SZN
Lamar has to get something going now.  Get some more points on the board.
The D is absolutely winning the game for us
Wtf the special teams shouting bout lol yall just punted
"Idk how we rolled into this season with the same group of WRs. Clearly they were an issue last year, they had too much confidence in Boykin going into this year"
"Oh my God. You think this is bad. The Jags just derped the every loving derp on a 4th and 1. Link up Allen Robinson in the QB slot, move Minchew to the slot. Robinson tries to throw, fumbles the ball shifting it to his throwing hands, Houston recovers."
Horsecollar much?
Jesus christ self aware now about the Murray.
MURRAY. Holy shit who gave this guy a job?
HIS NAME IS NOT *MURRAY*
FINALLY Gumbel
Why do I keep saying Murray 🤦🏼
"This is a minor gripe, but they need the announcing booths to get younger. There are too many senile old dudes with rocks for brains trying to make coherent sentences"
That absolutely was not a hold
Gumbel at least finally knows he's doing it
HOLLYWOOD
ACTION JACKSON TO HOLLYWOOD
33 passes. That’s too much for this early in the 3rd man. I really don’t get it.
"I'm sorry, it's the middle of the 3rd quarter in a game we're winning 17-0 and Lamar has 35 passing attempts? What the fuck are we calling?"
Fuck it sign AB
I'm starting to wonder if they're purposely abusing the pass to run ratio to make up for missed reps. Shit just doesn't make sense otherwise to not be running the ball.
"I miss seeing this type of pressure, it’s so fun to watch"
I honestly think eventually to win a SB we gonna have to move on from Roman eventually. Every offense he coaches starts out hot in the first year then after a few seasons starts choking and being sub par.
"All things considered, it's been fun watching the defense dominate. I'll take a stinker on O every now and then if it means I get to watch us bully offenses again"
I don’t know why Ingram gets so much hate here. Dude’s still got it and brings a great energy to the locker room.
Let’s go Eagles
Wait. Running the ball works?
"Lots of complaining in here today. Anybody else feel like they’re telling Lamar to save his legs until we need ‘em? We’re not going to lose this game—might as well keep him fresh until we need all of his tools against the Chiefs, Steelers, etc. Plus he gets to develop the passing game more. Feels like a long game approach to me (hopefully)..."
Where are those dudes shitting on Ingram earlier?
"Lots of bad mouthing of Mark here. He still got legs y'all, we just need to use him, Gus and JK more."
"We need a passing OC lmao, Greg is great on the run but he is so out of his element when it comes to a complete package."
Lamar’s judgement is shit
Boykin needs to be benched until he proves that he is going to give any effort
What the fuck was that
Boykin blocking? Lmao
Boykin breaks my heart
Boykin soft as hell
Gotta start putting our fastest guys out there on 3rd down.
Harbaugh went over to see if Lamar was drunk
Was Boykin run blocking?
I love that MO is still highlighted on the field
Fuck these announcers and fuck the bengals
Judon...TRASH
Judon getting flagged again
"Our defense has been looking good, our run game is working when we use it, were just struggling in the pass game. Lamar definately seems off"
"car vending machines, what a breakthrough that was"
Why aren’t we running the read option this year? Last Yea the entire offense revolved around it. Are they trying to keep Lamar from taking the hits?
Bench Boykin
**Roman be like:** https://imgflip.com/i/4i5740
Welcome the division joe
Joe will be andrew luck v2 if this keeps up for him
20 points against the bengals is just mediocre
"Our blitzes are working in this game because burrow + their pass pro have no idea how to counter them. Burrow hasn't seen at least 5 of them.

Rookie qb. Rookie struggles. 

@ the same time, this changes nothing as far as blitz usage against teams like the chiefs. Can't do it against them."
JACKSON WTF MAN
RUN THE FUCKING BALL FOR GOD SAKE
"It is 20-0, run the damn ball"
Lamar must be playing hurt
"Lamar has 0 touch today. None. Everything is like drives. 

He can drill some awesome side arms. He needs to figure out deeper and touch passes better."
"I know Jackson may not appreciate the running back comments, but maybe just let him run a few times? Nothing else has worked."
Bowser and Ferguson are looking good.
This defense is keeping me interested lmao
God I love Patrick Queen
"I’m not too worried about Lamar, dude had a knee injury and it’s obviously affected him. Hoping it won’t be affecting him next week or after"
That Fruit Punch is lethal
Patrick Queen player of the game today in my opinion
Marlon mf Humphrey
FROOT PUNCH
First TD of the second half?
"No wonder the bills struggled with roman as a OC. Guy does not know when to run and when to pass. Up 20. Why not run the ball with JK or Gus.

And the raiders are keeping up with the chiefs. This is beyond frustrating.

Reminds me of Cameron."
Humphrey is da man!
HUMP IS SO GOOD
I'm sorry but it's no longer the Peanut Punch. Fruit Punch for life
DPOY and DROY
Why they keep targeting my boi
Why is Marlon targeted so much tho
 Best defense ever n the league
Defense can easily carry us here. But it won't be able to against a good experienced QB. This offense needs serious work this week.
Imagine Humphrey in MMA lol. Dude was made for it.
When are these Marlon jerseys going to be back in stock. I need to get one
"OUR FIRST ROUND PICKS THESE LAST 5 YEARS HAVE BEEN AMAZING! STANLEY, HUMPHREY, LAMAR, HOLLYWOOD, AND QUEEN!!!

I'm going to intentionally ignore Hurst."
"Bengals try to prevent a shutout, then Marlon goes “nah” 😂"
Magic Marlo
"Pat Queen: 1 Sack, 1 FF, 1 FR, 1 TD"
Of course this is the week I’m going against the Ravens D in fantasy. ☹️
Give Humphrey that Mahomes money
Cmon philly philly
CMON IGGLES
Fly eagles fly!
Steelers defense giving up 30 to eagles lol
Harbaugh let them have this man
Alex smith has been sacked 5 times on 18 dropbacks 😬 get him outta there
Why the fuck did that replay just take 5 minutes?
Bout time he apologized
"I'm feeling bad for the D, they been out there a long time. Some warriors man ....."
I keep hearing an annoyingly pitched OOOOOHHHHHHHh the whole game it's so fucking annoying
If they can't convert this....
Iggles making a move.
WOW raiders with a massive play
"Watching Iggles-Stillers now

Leggo Philly"
Mmm my Baltimore defense in fantasy is v v sexy
RIP shutout
Not a shutout. Give me my blame of the game thread.
So Greg Roman passing here? /s
Come on eagles 😔
"If season ended today Humphrey would have a good case for DPOTY, Queen DROTY"
Burrow missing Queen a lot lol
"People focusing on how bad our offense is which is understandable, but not on how our defense is having one of the best performances you could possibly have"
Lmfao the Steelers struggling against the Eagles 💀💀💀😂
Three straight passes. Roman you fucking idiot.
"Literally a record breaking running game last season

Roman: nah fuck that shit that was stupid let's not do that again

Fuck off greg"
Jesus Christ Lamar literally misses every single deep pass
"Alright. Lamar is way off. He never does that. 

Missed practice time, maybe?"
Damn lamar had a gaping hole on the left side for an easy first... I wonder if he is looking to pass almost too much now lol
"It's 61 yards guys, don't be too broken about missing that 😂"
"We dont need to run the ball. We are gonna beat the bengals, work on the passing game so we can actually comoete against good teams"
People are talking about Judon earning a contract? Bruh he should be competing for a roster spot at this point
Nice to see Judon making an impact on the game /s
Why does it feel like we’re losing
Bad challenge but who cares?
"What is that little patch on Calais jersey? I've noticed it before on others, looks like a caped superhero or something"
"I like it when people add an 'S' to random names.

Humphreys, Burrows, Buddens....I'm going to start new ones.  Ngatas, Flaccos, Madabuikes, Wentzs, Gostkowskis"
Ugly ass win but still a W
Brown returning a kick? Interesting since he's afraid to even look at a defender lol
"""A convincing victory for the Ravens.""

Convincing of what, exactly? Lol."
We fans were totally spoiled from last season lol. I often forget about games where we'd score like single digits the entire game
"Stop making excuses lol, this offense is awful right now."
This is the worst commentator I have ever heard 🤣
Greg Roman strikes again!!!
Idk if I’m watching a different game than some of you guys but the run game has gone nowhere today. The fact is it’s both unsustainable to have as much running success as we did last year and losing yanda means we’re just not built to do as well as last year.
"Jeez you'd think the Bengals are blowing us out this game from the comments.

No it's not Lamars best game, but chill please"
"We should sign Julio, they are losing 20-7 to fucking Carolina"
"Yeah, the Ravens are up 17-0 against the Bengals; but the offense and the play-calling were simply sluggish in the 2nd quarter. So many uninspired pass plays, the right side of the offensive line is still struggling without Yanda and Lamar Jackson has been inconsistent with his precision and touch today. It really felt like  they wasted a good 3 drives by not scoring anything, even if they are playing a young Bengals team that is at least 2 years from being competitive.

Look, there's no reason why Baltimore should be passing the football 29 times while only running it 13 times in one half. That isn't the team's forte with only two consistent targets in the passing game."
Lamar looks bad today
Boykin provides 0 to this offense....I hate how we keep trying to turn shit into diamonds
Brown has left like 15 yards on the field already
Fire Roman NOW.
How are we not absolutely running up the score against these jobbers? Is anyone else starting to get concerned about our offence?
The Bengals have a bad defense and we still look like this. I thought Roman was to blame but I'm putting equal disappointment in Lamar big time
Are the Browns actually good and we just made them look bad?
Pls colts and pls eagles
No pass rush needs to get fixed today! Time to turn it on Judon and Co
Flacco is out there 😭😭
We better get a lot of sacks on these ass tackles
"Proche was right to let that bounce, but it was still scary nonetheless."
The ol Chris moore special but done right
Fuck yes duvernay! that's what I want to see from this offense/playcalling!!!!
FREE DUVERNAY
"Bozeman with a beautiful seal on that Duv run. 

Extend that man this offseason."
Anyone else see brown wide open
"Damn, missed an opportunity with Duvernay..."
"Passing game was supposed to improve this year, so far it’s been the same or worst"
Boykin you can come in at the redzone otherwise I want Duv
Lamar locking in on andrews again
"That playcall on 3rd and 7 was actually good. Lamar just surprisingly made the wrong read. Might've made the wrong read on 1st down as well.

Gotta look to players other than andrews and hollywood. They're being keyed in on"
Lamar always gotta be going for big plays. Just get the 1st down. Had a wide open receiver underneath.
Aww Mo next to Trey
How is someone always open like that
Tyler boyd always gives me ptsd
I remember when we had a good pass rush
Pass rush doesn’t get blocked and still cant get a sack
"If you're going to run that play, you actually need, you know, blockers."
Hollywood is scared to get hit I’m over it
Dumb play. Brown is scared of contact.
Markus brown
Mediocre-to-bad playcalling and Lamar's decision-making hasn't helped matters.
RUN the ball Greg you absolute scrotum
he FLIP
WE WANT DOBBINS
Why does this announcer keep calling Jackson “Murray “
"Someone tell the announcer that this is... the ""other"" black QB I guess????? Jesus"
Marks Andrews goes “WEEEEEE!” when anybody else would be freaking out or injured in that position
Back to back pass plays. Wtf are you doing Roman?
Why the fuck is Gus Edwards lined up out wide
How is the offense this bad against the fucking bengals
Murray on the move again
Again murray
Murray Counter : #3
"Damn, 10/10 on the flip, 10/10 on the slide"
Murray counter: 5
Murray #4
How has the other announcer not covered his mic and been like “this is lamar fucking jackson get his name right”
MANDREWS!!!
MURRAY TO ANDREWS
Murray for 6!!!
Mandrews carried the whole drive lmao
Touchdown LAMAR MURRAY!
IS GREG GUMBEL A KYLER MURRAY FANATIC?
Murray to Andrews for the TD!
MAndrews coming up big wow
Mandrews is HOT!!
Idk what everyone is thinking but this might be the best quarter of football I’ve seen this team play this season. Well done boys
Mark Andrews is the only player allowed to catch TD passes this season.
Some one tell the other commentator it’s Murray not Lamar Jackson. Smh newbs
"Kyler Murray to  Mark Andrews for the TD, what a great pickup by the Ravens, definitely needed at the QB position."
"Someone needs to be on the play clock next drive, that was close again. But beautiful throw to Andrews. Also that was blatant PI"
that was a really nice play by Lamar
"Lamar Jackson and Kyler Murray did the fusion dance this weekend, you guys haven't heard? Obviously Gumble has"
"Fuck the *new Jake from State Farm*

All my homies hate the *new Jake from State Farm*"
Lamar Murray's knee probably bothering him a little too.
Happy for the TD. Not a fan of a few of Lamar's decisions.
That does make me smile
AJ GREEN JUST WATCHED
INTERCEPTION!!!!!! MARCUS MURRAY WITH THE PICK!!!!!!!
"hell yes!!!! Pressure, interception!"
MURRAY.. TURNING THE CORNER..
Wow Lamar is getting zero yards running outside
How is he STILL calling him Murray??
Someone tell him it’s Jackson!!!! Geez
Murray. Again.
So thats what having a decent blitz feels huh
"Murray drops back, passes to Murray"
"""Murray"""
MURRAY
That's #8 on the Murray counter
Wtf is all this shit about Murray in a Ravens thread?
Is Gumbel mixing up Lamar with Kyler?
We gotta push for this ass announcer to get fired and I’m dead serious
That was kinda weak. I wasn't aware of that offsetting penalty rule
"We only seem to be doing one designed run with Lamar Jackson, and it's just not really working, need to get more creative"
Dunlap is a clown
Sometimes it looks like Jackson's passes actually get lift.  Like they're on a flat trajectory and the after about midway rise up.
Think we should trade the Saints for Latavius Murray?  Maybe kick the tires on DeMarco Murray?
Marc Andrews is doing great so far!
"""How about another joke, *Murray*?""

That's all I can think of when Greg Gumbel calls Lamar Jackson, ""Murray""."
"MAndrews is about 2 years from being my all time favorite Ravens Tight End. Heap has the nostalgia, but god he’s a beast"
#TOUCHDOWN MARQUISE MURRAY!!!
"Just talking about Andrews, now our boy Hollywood getting it going."
MURRY TO HOLLYWOOD
Hollywood!!!
They must've told gumble during the commercial that it's jackson
Hollywood Fitzgerald
Nice catch by Steve Smith Jr
So much for Hollywood not having a TD
Finally hollywood gets a td
Gonna be another blowout
Credit to the Bengals they have focused on the run and have done a good job. Problem is they listened to the pundits about whether Lamar could throw or not.
Lamar Murray to Antonio Brown for his first TD of the year!
18 straight quarters with a score.
Jesus judon really does suck
Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray Murray
So many missed sacks
I was about to say Judon won his one on one....then i realized it was against a TE.....and STILL didnt finish
Ferguson is really getting better at setting the edge
Ferguson looking good today too what is going on
Quickly growing tired of Judon.
GOD DAMMIT JUDON
It kills me that we could have signed clowney if we just let judon walk
Wink feast on rookies
KILLA QUEEN
Queen fucking rocked him
PATRICK QUEEN
"Judon......

facepalm"
Yasssssss queeeeewwn
Lowkey feel bad for Burrow. Why draft a QB with a high school O-Line?
Killer Queen has no weaknesses!
You can tell that shit was personal too lmao he didn't even attempt to wrap him up. Straight up old school POP
RIP joe
The balls is ours bitch
That hit from Queen was disgusting. Sheesh.
"Damn queen with the triple crown sack, FF, and FR"
I really don't get the hype behind Judon. The only time he wins his matchups is when he's either unblocked or on a tight end. That coupled with all his stupid penalties makes him not worth the huge extension he wants.
What was that throw?? Did it get tipped?!
Is it me or is seeing other qbs in the afc north getting hit by us pretty cool
"Baltimore Ravens, world renowned passing attack"
"Ah yes, a 1-yard pass to Nick Boyle on 3rd and 7"
I HATE THIS PLAYCALLING
But why Lamar.
Damn Lamar gets too excited on those
Is there a reason we aren't running the ball?
Ahh Lamar had him easily
Was that a GRo call or a Harbaugh call? Cause wtf
"i feel like i just watched myself playing madden, going for it on 4th and 6 while up 17 is....questionable to say the least."
honestly what the fuck happened to lamar's accuracy beyond 10 yds?
"Not impressed with the passing game. It’s like we are running random plays instead for running offense. And where is the running game? We are up 17, run the ball and throw off playaction."
"Baltimore is a running based team

Greg Roman: THAT MEANS PASS IT RIGHT???"
We’re getting cute dammit
Literally any time this team gets an offensive penalty Roman refuses to run it. Every 1st and 15 so far this year had passes.
Zero complaints with the defense today. We are MURDERING their offensive line
Cincinnati's Oline is AWFUL
"Burrow is a millionaire but I do not envy him on this day

Edit: current millionaire"
burrow is getting hit left and right lmao
So Rich tell me more about field position
Another sack? This is confusing
Burrow hasn't played like a rookie all year up until this game. Feels good to see the defense finally he the ones to shut him down.
This is not a “hold the ball for 5 seconds before you throw it” kind of o-line!
Hey guess what? I still like the call to go for it.
Nice rush by Bowser
Iggles tie the Steelers! the Steelers D is definitely overrated
Burrow should have pulled a Eli
Gus is so good.
Start the bus
Lamar what the hell were you thinking with that
"Lamar, that shit has to be out of bounds.  Jesus Christ."
can we pls start giving it to Dobbins more often
Nice job Roman. Keep passing asshole
"Gus wasnt this good last year right? I remember getting frustrated at him a few games last year idk

His improvement has been crazyyy"
Look at Morgan Cox bringing returners down!
can we like run more? were we not the best run offense of all time statistically?
Wasted possession
"Our offense looks so stale, cmon guys this bengals D is bad to say the least"
"We were running good on that drive...until we stopped running. Wtf Greg, your fucking things up!"
Burrow is seeing purple ghosts out there
I love that Wink knows the blitz is a Cincy weakness and just continues to put that pressure on.
We're a little dreary in here so can we notice our run defense seems to be legit again after being pretty mediocre for a while?
I need at least 3 on this drive. Thank you
Hell of a run.
"Honestly, I'm glad they aren't running. We could be up by another 20 by running probably but that isn't going to help us come play offs. We've seen how bad the game gets when teams take away our running and that is going to happen during the play offs. We need to get our passing game going. Obviously it's not going great but we should use these games to develop it rather than just win by something we are good at. It's not good to be one dimensional, so it's good to use a game like this to develop a deficiency."
Damn Hollywood gotta hold that!
Holy fucking shit!!!! Why are we not using JK dobbins! He's so fucking good
Wtf...
Jesus christ dude
We have to seriously consider giving dobbins ACTUAL carries.
And that ball is complete😆
what a completion by lamar murray
"SIGH. Roman, Lamar, O-Line..."
Decision making Lamar... Looking rough out there at times
Just run the fucking ball
We need Lamar back idk who this Murray guy QBing is.
Is burrow going to die out there??
Holy fuck bruh can we please rush the ball god damn Roman
FUCK. YOU. GREG. ROMAN. YOU. ASSHOLE
HAND IT OFF TO DOBINS AND EDWARDS
"Just give gus the ball the rest of the game, this is sad"
"4th interceptable pass of the game for lamar. 3rd one right to the defender. He has never had a game this bad in this respect. 

He isn't seeing the field at all."
McPhee is having an awesome game
I get the whole point of passing up 17 is to build Lamar’s confidence but what the fuck.
Who the hell was lamar throwing that to
This 1st half has felt like its dragged on for ages
I'm really upset we wasted Dobbins's little mini-beastquake run.
Queen just erased Gio
Not the worst day for Lamar to have a bad day.
Apart from Andrews and Brown we have no other receiving threat and it’s showing
Can someone take these announcers to a retirement home please?
The D is carrying us right now. The offense better show up.
Our offensive line is so bad without yanda
I absolutely hate this announcer. Bengals D has down a great job apparently and Joe Burrow needs more help.... Can you give the winning team credit for anything??
"Damn, Bengals called a timeout just to give it up easily. 😂"
61 here we go
darn
Honestly our offense was pretty bad that half.
Lamars gonna let his hair out and turn this season around. You watch
4.7 yds a pass yikes
"With how dominant the defense has been, even slightly competent offense would've put the Ravens up by like, 30 points."
Roman avoids giving Dobbins more touches like its a disease
My favorite thing about that half was only 1 play call for Lamar to run the ball. It needs to be occasional elite weapon not a staple of the O imo
What kind of cheat code wizardry is Harbs using to keep his glasses from fogging up with two masks on
Lamar has been off since the chiefs game
"The other issue seems to be our route concepts always require 3+ seconds, where are the slants and crossers"
Orlando having a major slump this year
"Good to see we made halftime adjustments we obviously needed... Oh wait, no we didnt"
Man Lamar off and our line can’t seem to block even for a second
You're up 17-0. No need to play hero ball deep in your own territory Lamar.
Gotta go young with coordinators eventually.
Accuracy is off and he's hesitant.
"Boykin stepping up would fix a lot of our offensive issues. The only reason we send Hollywood on so many deep routes is because he's our only deep threat at receiver. If Boykin could actually play a deep ball, it'd open things up for Holly and Duve underneath to get some serious YAC"
That pass rush today tho
Holy fuck what a hit
I almost feel bad for Burrow. He’s getting brutalized back there.
Only 4 sacks? It feels like way more than that
Lol Bengals line is the worst I've ever seen
Let's get 6 - who says no?
Deshon Elliot is one of my favorites. He always seems to get some big hits off
I'm worried about Jackson's mobility with this knee thing
PLEASE GREG RUN THE BALL
"Lamar needs help, man. Hollywood just isn't a true separation WR"
Remember when we would run the ball for a 9 minute drive?
"Duvernay is fast AF and is reliable, why tf don't we give it to him more often"
We need to give Duvernay way more looks
"“Why do I keep saying Murray?”

I dunno cause you’re senile?"
Murray strikes again!
"Murray’s decision making since the chiefs game has been spotty , feel like he’s lacking confidence"
That holding call was sus
We dont know Gumbel we dont know
Horrible holding call
Man I don't like that holding call. Hands inside and still driving back.
There we go Lamar!!! Turn tf up
Marquise breaking off a piece.
Holy cow Gus just took out Reader?!
Someone needs to tell the announcer to lay off the booze before the game
Honestly offense looks like absolutely trash.
Out of the way ref!!!! Lol
The fact that nobody can get open is pathetic
Where is our offense?
lamar plz scramble for one one of these damn drives
I would've liked to see Lamar run to the right there I think it was open
I really dont think Lamar is the problem all 3 receivers were stacked in the same spot just 4 8 and 12 yards up field
If our receivers can’t get open scheme them open ffs
kinda looks like we’re not trying feels like practice
This is the worst announcing job I’ve seen in a long time
Shit I forgot AJ Green even existed
I hate to say it but Willie Snead should not be the 2nd best WR on any NFL team
"Lamar could have and should have taken off there. He seems to be really hesitant on running this year. That’s fine and all but....uh....we don’t exactly have a solid reliable group of WRs yet...

Use your legs a bit more Lamar . Please? I like it when you stunt on hoes with your leg"
We're in this gam bc of the D.  Our offense needs to get in synch.
12 carries by the RB and 2 by WR. Nice job Roman
I'm newbie. Can someone explain me why Lamar doesn't scramble as often as last year?
That route combo on 3rd down was trash as well. WR's stacked on top of each other.
So good at BALL EXTRACTION!
I’m liking our defense much better than our offense this year
"Roman: Hmmm, the passing game didn't work? Better call another..."
Lamar got to scramble more
Does Lamar ever take any snaps under center??
They look like a pack of wolves tryna get that ball...I love it!
Wink's play calling has given Earl Thomas and Marcus Peters the first sack in their careers. Exotic.
Look what happens when we run the ball...
Lol. LOOK AT THAT! Running the football works! xD
Hey guys ITS A RUN GAME
"Wow, maybe we should try this running thing more"
Elite dragon just ran for a first
31st in passing. That's all we needed to see folks. Roman ain't it
"For real? What is wrong with these commentators. This guy didnt run all day. They just saved this up untill he would finally run, didnt they?"
"31st ranked passing attack...

Also when did roman have hair??"
What the absolute fuck
That was 3rd down? Wow.
Lol what the fuck was that
Boykin is like Randy Moss... takes off plays....but none of GOAT stuff
Tucker missed a 61-yard FG. Are we concerned????
"How is this announcer blaming lamar for that, lamar saw a 1 on 1 with no one overtop and a big reciever. Boykin stopped running his route"
A bit disappointed with our offense right now but we’re winning who cares
"The RUN is working every single time and yet we keep passing, please stop"
Why is Judon playing Safety on that play?
So now announcers are actively cheering for a team as plays unfold? Lol
I want Judon to succeed so much. But man... every game seems worse
Judon offside again
The Browns gave up 30 to these guys at home with fans so there’s that
Man Las Vegas holding their own against KC
It feels like Burrow has been hit EVERY SNAP.
Tbh if Roman wants a HC job after this season i will do back flips with excitement get em outta here.
"Kinda feel bad for burrow, dudes getting killed"
Our DBs have more sacks than our LBs and linemen
"i swear i'm still hearing that horrible ""ooooooooooooooooo"" person from the recorded crowd noise audio"
Bengals O-Line flat out cannot handle it
My man Humphrey
Marlo energy is the best kind of energy
We should be up at least 45-0 right now with this defensive effort today
Time for Murray to hand the ball off.
Hahahaha what the fuck
"Yea we’re up 20-0 but it doesn’t look good. Offense looks horrible, passing when we should be running, receivers can’t really get open. Not gonna beat anybody with the 31st ranked passing game in the nfl. If it wasn’t for our defense, they would probably be in the game."
WHY DO WE KEEP THROWING FOR THE LOVE OF GOD STOP
Just wtf Lamar
Sigh. Another pass. WTF. CALL A RUN PLAY! >:(
Cincy has given up.  Just run the ball.
Lamar would have legit 5 interceptions in this game if the Bengals held on.
"For the people upset with our offense, think about how great the defense is playing and be happy that our offense doesn’t have to be playing good for a game like this. Hopefully this is just a fluke."
Something is wrong with Jackson for sure. Honestly looks like he's throwing to defenders on purpose sometimes
All these TV shows look like absolute pants. Jesus Christ.
Lamar been.... interesting today
What the fuck is going on
GREG ROMAN. YOU ARE A STUBBORN ASS
What the fuck is lamar doing
Feels like Koch is doing great in the punt game.
We need to keep Lamar in the game blow out or not
What kind of run call was that shit
They completely neutralizes our passing game
Bowser setting the edge real good
I’m glad we’re winning but can we just end this already?
"Bengals offense: - @greggrosenthal

7 first downs

7 punts

7 sacks of Burrow"
7 sacks lol
"There has to be something in Lamars mental this past off season that has rattled him. He looks to be less efficient passing and less elusive running. It doesn't look like the ability isnt their, looks like a mental block or something. I swear if ABs awful attifude put a curse or got in his head this summer... I won't go there yet. Just hope things start to click soon 🙏🙏"
"Lamar is having a bad game but as an OC your supposed to set him up for success. If he's injured why have him throw 40 times with a sub par O-Line? Our pass game cannot stand on its own legs, so lets throw it despite having one of the worst WR cores in the league??"
#YAAAAAAS QUEEN YAAAASSSSS
This D is FIRE today!
Defense playing lights out man
DROY Patrick Queen. Dont @ me.
Offense deserves to walk home after this game
Hump is a fucking punching machine
Defense has truly been something else today 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
Did Marlon strip that? Holy shit lol
100 million dollar man
Marlo and Queen!
Those punches are heat seeking missiles
DROTY
Marlo AGAIN with the punch!!! Holy shit!
FRUIT PUNCH
FRUIT PUNCH 🥰🥰🥰
Marlon “Peanut Tillman” Humphrey
yasss queen
"Damn love this D.  Was giving up on this game bc th O is so frustrating to watch, but man th D is making this game exciting"
Love how sizzle’s impact can be seen in our DBs forcing fumbles 247
Ok time to bring in the b team
Defense killin it in fantasy today!!!
Hell of a play by Humprehy.
HOW MANY KNOCKOUTS IS THAT THIS YEAR 4?
YASSSS
Genuinely time to begin the Marlon for DPOY campaign.
Dana white boutta gift Marlo a ufc contract with that right hook
We are witnessing marlo evolve the cb position
"If the D wasn’t playing this good, I’d have stopped watching already"
Marlon with the reach around?!
"It usually takes the offence to take longer to get on the same page, this is concerning obviously but let’s remember we had 0 preseason games and it took us time to build up momentum on offence, stop panicking and let’s just hope it improves. Missing Yanda clearly held a massive part and Romans calls haven’t been too great either."
Mixon is good.
Run defense has been solid
Humph should be a supe in the third season of The Boys. He punches people into different dimensions.
Did Gumble just say he needs to apologise to cock?
The Iron Cock Defense
Nooooo they're gonna score
Steelers fumble?
One thing I do not miss about the Flacco era is constantly getting Greg Gumbal as our play-by-play.
Grateful to the Bengals for just running this out.
Man. Announcers really trying to hype up Burrow this game like he didn’t panic at all...
Why is Hollywood returning kicks?
Uhhh can we not have our only competent receiver returning kicks?
"Nothing worse than the field goal at the end of a shutout. Why not give your offense a shot to hit the end zone. People say it’s job security, but I feel like it’s even more reason to fire the coach."
Eagles missed the FG. Ugh!
PHL is useless.
"Listen ... some of you are truly spoiled, as if the Steelers aren’t struggling against Philly right now"
"What. In the fucking world.

OK, enough. Need to call it how we see it at this point. Lamar is playing like absolute ass right now. He doesn't even look like the same guy. I'd expect that kind of 3rd down throw from, say, Darnold."
"Is... uh... anyone else getting concerned by lamars deep ball?

Please someone tell me it was just a bad throw"
Those 2 days of missed practice are looking kind of noticeable for Lamar
This offense is still great don’t get me wrong but they are just inconsistent so far. They look stale at times.
Lamar's knee must actually be injured. I notice he's actually not running today.
Our two biggest offensive plays were from Duvernay and Dobbins who have each touched the ball like twice. What in the fuck is Roman doing this season?
Bruh were up 17-0 in a division game. The fact that we blew out the browns as badly as we did was incredible. We’re fine
Hollywood could've gotten another 5 yards there. Can't be that afraid of contact.
We can admit the Flacco era was much worse than this but also admit that the offense needs to play better for when we play tougher opponents! Love being up by 17 but you can’t be content when going for a ring
Still 20-0 guys
"Lamar overthrew Boykin. That pass was not even close to catchable. Yeah, I'd like to see him make an effort, but that was 100% on Lamar."
Pull Lamar and put RgIII in
There you go guys. 3rd & 2. We ran it and got nothing.
Sign AB!!!!!
I love this team but this offense is absolutely disgraceful.
STEELERS D IS SO OVERRATED
"As much as I just want this dumb dreary game to end, can't fault Harbs for wanting to show his guys he cares and will fight for every inch. Also doesn't hurt to see who can bring it on 3rd and short."
This announcer is such a moron. How much time would Burrow have with 4 blitzing. Dumbass
"We gave up 3 points? This defense is trash.

/s"
Wtf Lamar? What an awful first half by him. Much worse than the stats.
But Lamar has me worried now. Hasn’t looked good all season. Looks like we’re trying real hard to make him a pocket passer to “prove” all the doubters that he could. Not the mans game. We need way more run option plays. That’s how we kill teams. When that end dive in on our Rb Lamar keeps it and kills them. Keeps defenses stacking the box then we kill them with play action. We’ve gotten away from our identity as an offense
Lamar used to be a better passer.
Worst rush defense in the league. Pass 75% of the time.
This was one of very few times where I disagreed with going for it on 4th. Bad coaching decision. We had an opportunity to pin them deep
Everyone here is bashing Roman constantly but he's not making these awful throws that miss open receivers.
Dobbins should be in at RB whenever possible. He’s more dynamic than Ingram/Gus Bus. Gives Lamar another safety valve with Mark Andrew’s.
Roman has to run the ball wtf is this man doing
"Blatant opinion:

Every snap that Ingram gets over Dobbins or Edwards is a lost snap."
"It feels like NO ONE is developing or improving in these games. Haven't learned anything new and Lamar isn't looking any better. Raven games are getting boring. I wanna see Dobbins get more than 2 carries a game, give Duvernay and Boykin a look.

We can beat up on bad teams all day but we need to find good players to help us beat the Titans and Chiefs."
"#PROTECT LAMAR JFC.

O line is so trash. If that knee injury is bad we can't risk him scrambling like that"
Did Snead just give up on the play before the ball was thrown....
Y'all need to chill. Look at Lamar's W/L record since he became a starter.
"That's an illegal bat penalty, not that the refs know the rules"
"terrible overthrow, what kind of route Boykin?!"
Flacco with another ELITE Td
I'm convinced andy reid or bellichick has a voodoo doll of Roman. Only way to explain Roman's moronic play calls
"Flacco scrambling for first downs and throws a TD!!!

I miss him (don’t get this twisted)"
Entire defense (except judon) are players of the game
Fire Roman clown 🤡
Roman is frankly an idiot. Lamar can't throw that. But he shouldn't be in the position to have to throw that
"This is embarrassing. It's pretty clear that Lamar's not 100% today, so WHY DO THEY KEEP CALLING PASS PLAYS xD"
AJ green need to tell Harbaugh to come get him
"these announcers giving Lamar lot of credit here, he didn't play well today"
Lamar has had a very pedestrian year so far. What’s up?
Please just trade Judon already. He's so fucking bad
Let’s gooooooo
Mekari starting at RG 👀
I just want a Hollywood TD today
Lol my stream has cincinnati commercials... But it's working well... Do I switch or suck it up...
SPOILERS: They're gonna throw screens
Look at Calais Campbell standing there a head taller than the other really large guys.
I am not liking these broadcasters they sound like they are falling asleep right now.
Was that a sack?
anyone got the live stream?
That's why you play him and not boykin
DUVARNEY GOT WHEELS BABY!
Fucking hell that kid is fast
Duvernay is fast 🔥
What a deceptive toss by Lamar
More duvernay please and thank you
Duvernay is fast.
Great play call!
Duvernay has got some wheels on him
I like that Duvernay guy
That blocking on Duv’s run was fucking perfect. He didn’t even have to make anyone miss
I wanna see more of the rookies at WR this game.  Lets see what we got!
Hopefully our line is a lot better with Stanley back
That’s the play calling I knew Roman had just never uses
It felt like Lamar threw that too late like that was an anticipation throw.
Right down middle. In Tuck We Trust
Lamar please don’t do that all game
We gotta use Duv more
Bizarre choice by Lamar there. Couldn't see who was cutting open inside but a leading throw there and that's an easy first down.
"These commentators really try to jynx Tuck. You could hear the inflection in that fucker's voice, trying to cast his gypsy spell"
Well at least we have Tucker
Fucking hate when we throw on first dammit
Lamar’s habit of tossing it up to Mark cost us there. Duvernay was open
Offense seems to have more energy than the last few weeks. Lamar seems to want it a little too much. He’ll settle in here
"Lamar makes bad throws: ""Why aren't we running!""

Because the guy is going to have to get the passing game going eventually or we are going to be one dimensional."
I'm surprised to see Mekari get the start at right guard over D.J. Fluker. Like is Fluker that bad at this point?
if we gonna throw on first dont fucking run on second and make it a hard third. Greg Roman is ass on god
Teams pick us apart with short throws over the middle. We have to throw for 20+ every time.
Does our zone defense just suck? It seems like all QBs find gaping holes to hit.
"I don't think I have ever seen the Ravens run zone successfully, lol. Dudes just wide fucking open."
"Im hoping Roman gets a head coaching offer next year, and leaves. Im sick or his shit."
Fucking ass pass rush
How do they have wide open receivers and ours continue to seem smothered?
Looked to me like they were holding Elliot on that or it would have been a sack.
Lmao. Slippery mf
This is where you bitch slap a rook
"Credit where it’s due, nice job escaping by Burrow"
At least it’s 4th down but that could’ve been a huge gain here.
"classic ""get pressure but don't sack"""
FUCK OFF THE FIELD
Marquise is so afraid of contact.
Yeah... don’t ever call that play again.
Saw that getting nothing at the start
Hollywood making too many business decisions for the level hes at
Screen to Brown what a stupid play
Roman gets too cute early in the game. We need confidence building plays early on..
As soon as I cast doubt on Hollywood lol
Hollywood's helmet looks so big on him. Bobble head
"Jesus Christ, all these deep shots haven’t been getting anything"
Hollywood needs to bulk up
This is Duvernay's game. I can feel it
We need to get Duvernay more involved in the pass game. Every time I type his name it autocorrects to being in all caps which is my reasoning
Duve king
Gus Bus sighting!
Duvernay already with more in this game than Boykin has for weeks basically
We do a lot of deep passes on 1st down which are always incomplete which leads to another passing play on 2nd and 3rd down which gets away from our strength.
Also it's starting to become apparent these bad team match ups are all about getting Lamar's arm up and ready
"Stout defense by the Bengals there. Even though we converted, I give them credit."
Gumble apparently thinks we're the Cardinals.
This offense is so sluggish
Andrews with the windmill lmao
Andrews landed the best way he could have lol
Textbook landing by Mandrews
These commentators are gonna make me fall asleep
Lamar this year hasn’t got anything running to the outside
Here comes Flip Andrews again
That flip was gnarly
3rd and 14 goddamn it
Shit commentators.
"Our offense keeps converting despite looking like shite, lol."
Seeing a 6’5 dude flip like that is something
Gumbel has a concussion
STOP CALLING HIM MURRAY YOU DUMBFUCK
Why does he keep calling lamar murray
"Something is wrong with Lamar, nothing close to a run yet for him"
Mandrews showed tf up today
omg these announcers blow fucking ass
LET GUS PUNCH ONE IN!!
Here comes Angry Llama
Wow I didn't realize we'd scored in every quarter this year so far. That's actually kinda nuts
"These announcers have no chemistry. It's not that what they're saying is particularly awful, but there's no synchronization. Those long pauses, the lack of connection between their calls, no playing off of each other whatsoever, they've got nothing. It's like listening to two people commentating from inside a box where they can't hear the other guy, they just have a light that tells them when it's their turn to talk."
What's up man where is gus
Hey GRo we do have Gus and Dobbins you realize right?  Fucking dipshit
How can we not run it in here?
We just called a timeout and they didn’t go to a commercial. Thats weird.
Boiii
Great TD pass by Murray (6 times now)
"Murray counter: 6

I think he's having a stroke"
Maybe we been throwing cause we can't run as well as last year.
Murray Andrews!
"You’d think his partner would correct him. Nah, “let him bury himself” the color guy says."
Murray with the touchdown pass
He was holding him all along too lol
Dude is gonna lead the league in touchdown receptions this year
Dawg Mandrews always freaking COMES ALIVE in the redzone haha
That was a dart of a pass.
Still f*cking got it!
"I’m about to head over to M&T and bang on the gate asking to see Gumbel.... TELL HIM
ITS MURRAY TO SEE HIM!"
Has Dobbins got any touches?
Lamar better watch out. I hear this Murray kid is pretty good
Mandrews: Mr. Reliable.
Weirdly he only says Murray when he’s passing but says his name properly otherwise.
Really clear hold on Andrews on the TD. Glad he was able to power through
Ingram looks like he fell off a cliff this offseason
"""Murray with the pass and it's Murray with the catch in the endzone! Here comes Murray on to kick the PAT. Murray with the hold. And it's good! Murray!"""
I want a few big hits on burrows. Give him a real welcome to the afc north
LET'S GOOO JUICE MAN
Peters with that pick!!
MARCUS PETERS
PETERS!!!! Peters? You good fam?
Pass rush: satisfactory
MP JUICEMAN!!!
Announcers playing the meow game from Super Troopers with Murray
the bengals are getting RG3ed at this rate
I told you Burrow would look like a rookie
STILL MURRAY
"Idk why, but Burrow doesn’t rub me the wrong way nearly as much as Mayfield does. He’s equally overconfident"
**MP**
Murray streak continues
They went to commercial and no one wanted to correct him?
Penalty is declined by rule? Is that new?
That was a light call
Why wouldnt the penalties offset?
Seeing some good flashes from Madabuike!
"Lol, it's the Lamar Andrews show today."
Where would we be without MAndrews
Lamar finding his stride again. Patience y’all
This man has said Murray so many times
You can tell Hollywood really wants a TD he usually celebrates with andrews on a TD but isn’t doing that
Lamurray
The Baltimore Murrays are looking good
That Murray to Andrews connection is fire
HOLLYWOOD!!! For his first of the year
HOLLYWOOD
HOLLYWOOOOOOOOOOD
TOUCHDOWN HOLLYWOOD
Anyone think Lamars off this year????? ANYONE????
No rock paper scissors celebration I'm sad now
I hate not having a crowd man
Kyler now has 9 TD’s to 1 pick on the year
Lamar Murray
"I’m sorry Ms. Murray, I am fo reeeeal"
That Murray guy. He's good 👀
SOONERS LEGEND
Hollywoods headband is fire
Joe Mayfield has not looked great
"Meanwhile, Flacco is 5 for 8 for 34 yards, in the 2nd quarter. 😤"
So awkward watching Flacco hand off to Bell.
Judon feast when he’s against TEs or unblocked
"Judon struggles to finish sooo much, it is unreal"
FUCKING SACK HIM.
I'm low-key glad Judon didn't get that sack lol
I can already tell Imma hate Burrow like I do Ben with this unsackableness
"Matthew ""Body Built By Taco Bell so I'm all greasy and can't get a sack"" Judon"
That's on Marlon. Also a good throw.
I despise tyler boyd
"Matthew ""I suck at getting sacks"" Judon"
Lmaooooo Deshon
Fucking judon bum ass
FUCK JUDON. ARE YOU KIDDING ME.
Judon is fucking gone
Keep 'em comming Joe
Here comes the Judon love train lol
Queennnnn
PATRICK QUEEN!! WHAT A PLAY!!!
"Judon forgiven, the fumble was better than the pick"
Queen!!!!!!
He got hammered!
Now we know who really carried LSU hahaha
I'd like to get hit from behind by Queen
God I love Patrick Queen
Burrow is going to get himself killed
Buddy got blasted lmao
Burrow might end up in concussion protocol with how his head snapped.
The Defense talking a lot of shit today
QUEEN DONT GIVE A FUCK
Better field position than the int anyway
Bowser is athletic af
FUCK YEAH BEAT HIS ASS!!!!!
Now is the time to stick the dagger into their hearts.
Tiger on tiger friendly fire 😉🥰
Guys... I feel bad for Burrows...
BURGER QUEEN
You love to see former college teammates involved in plays together. Especially in their rookie year.
bUt tHeY wErE tEamMaTes!!
The fuck kinda throw was that?
Did that get tipped? Jesus
Are you all fucking blind or dumb? It was tipped... Lmao
Do Willie Snead and Miles Boykin even exist?
I've seen a few bad snaps today
Man I think receiver had inside leverage down field.
mannnnn overthrown
"But

But why tho"
We got 4 yards after a takeaway lmao.
4 passes in row Roman. WTF are you doing? Why'd they even go for it at all?
Whyyyy
I know we’re up but of these throws are way off
???? what the fuck was that drive????
Should have been Koch
"Well, that was a sad series.

False start (typical for us whenever we try to hard count).

3rd down with no shot.

4th down bad overthrow."
It’s not a bad play call at all if Lamar hits it’s a huge play
Play calling looking sus again
"Last year was the first year I completely had confidence in a Ravens offense. Now that I expect it, it’s so much more frustrating than before"
Geez Louise you guys are so spoiled because we had one drive we didn't score on
The most obviously fucking hold
LJ needs to throw to get better at it. This is his preseason. We got to iron shit out by doing it.
Burrow looking like Dalton today.
"Wow look at that, old man McPhee got a sack while Judon is struggling against TEs"
Their O-Line must be sooo bad if our D-Line looks legit
Wow they need a new O line
I'm taking bets right now. Burros is not going to be able to walk for a week after today.
Beat his ass to destress from the previous weeks man
I wish we could face Bobby Hart every week.
I thought bengals fixed their oline this year
"I just figured it out, the announcer thinks OUR QB is Kyler Murray?"
Gus up the middle is an automatic 7 yards why are we just now seeing him?
They have the worst OL I think I've ever seen. Jesus.
"Gus should we be the starter, Ingram for passes/relief"
The fact that Burrow was able to get consecutive games with over 300 passing yards with this oline is impressive lol
"Lol, Roman's woken up. It's over for the Bengals now"
Burn the clock till the end of the half.
Gus edwards' hair looking nice this year
There’s still 5 mins left in the 2nd lmao.
Are we just not playing Dobbins?
Some more designed run for Lamar would be a change.
Burrow is going to have purple nightmares tonight
The way I see it the D has this on lockdown so they are treating this like a preseason game.
Play out music to commercial from The Wire...perfect.
This D is suffocating
Bro the Steelers and Eagles are tied
Defense came to WIN today!!
Props to Wink. He shook Burrow there so hard he couldn't hit an open guy like 2 yards away.
Lmao is that the Wire tune?
Seeing Alex Smith play is amazing
THATS WHY YOU PLAY DOBBINS BABY
Wait were actually good at running the ball when we try it? Incredible.
#JK ALL DAY
DOBBINS
What a run by Dobbins!
"J.

K.

DOBBINS!"
"I really, really like Dobbins."
DOBBY IS A FREE ELF
"Less carries for ingram, more for dobbins."
Lamar has missed a couple but also had defenders make great plays on two passes
GIVE THIS MAN THE BALL MORE
That pass is NOT complete Gumbel you fucking moron.
"What in the world Lamar, so dumb"
TERRIBLE fucking pass wow
"Love the shot to Hollywood, idk why we didn't run on 2nd"
"Sadly, he freaking earned that. Should have been his third by now."
Ah it was tipped. Watch the replay
Was that tipped ??
Who was that pass to?!!?
These announcers suck.
commentator sniffing glue
Why are we taking the ball away from the run game for no reason?
“Pass completed by Lamar Murray” who the fuck is this announcer lol
To be fair it WAS tipped
The Ravens are going full jail break on Burrow and he's shook
That was just a bad play on all parties. Surely EDC sees that we will not be next level elite as long as we have Greg Roman right?
If we would play to our strengths instead of throwing every damn play
Irrespective of the result of that play (unlucky tip) where has the run game gone in this offense? Do we not run the zone read anymore? It’s like we’re playing with an arm tied behind our backs
Fuck yeah get back out there Lamar!
"One of our special teams guys was down holding his knee.  Didnt see the number, but looked in pain."
Fucking run the ball and stop calling trash pass plays.
Proche looked slow there.
So what kind of play calling would our passing offense execute? Do we need another TE?
"Like why don’t we run more of these quick Hollywood throws, let him get some yac"
25 passes in the first half
Stanley not even blocking his man?
4 man rush is getting there INSTANTLY. Lamar has been bad but shit!
"I haven't been able to watch every Ravens game this year, but can someone explain to me why JK isn't getting more touches? He looks to be the most explosive RB they have, and he's brought in *often* on passing plays so I can't imagine it's a pass blocking issue. What am I missing?"
At least they got one thing right this game about Tucker 🐐
I'm sad now
I still love you tuck
FUCK
"Glad we can at least give him a shot. Long shot, but a shot!"
It was close
holy crap he finally missed
Damn it.  Put a little too much hook on it
Awwww. Oh well.
"aight it was from 61 yards, its ok Tucker that's understandable"
Lamar mad he will kill them in 3rd quarter then RG3 will start the 4th
Plenty of room tho. If he had centered it I think it could be good from 65 imo.
Tuck IK you will drill the next 60 yarder I believe
"Impossible, Bengals must've used a giant fan or something."
"We should be up more but overall it was a good first half just a lot of mistakes on offense. We’re throwing way to much once again and luckily it hasn’t bit us in the ass but it will against better teams. 

We need to RUN. We had the most rushing yards in nfl history last year. RUN THE BALL"
We do not need to run the ball against the bengals. This is the team to practice throwing 40 times on. When crunch time comes against Chiefs we are more prepared
"Lamar has been very poor but the man missed two practices and judging by his IG story, it looks like he just lost a friend. I have complete faith in our guy."
I think Orlando is being exposed now that Yanda has retired. Need to go OL heavy in the next draft. (Player permitting)
jesus christ that should have been picked
I am worried
We have like infinite running backs but none are getting going at all. Seems like it's hurting us to have so many.
"I'd like to see us work on some quick-developing pass plays that we can pull out, like some screens or slants."
Man we need some WRs.....
Burrow’s speed is shocking
"Holy, the defense looks good today"
Deshon elliot wrapping up better than judon
Burrow getting tossed today.
Huber is their MVP
At least we got defense when our offense is shitting the bed
burrow will die playing for cinci good god
Roman must really see something in Boykin he always on the fucking field running lazy routes
#FINALLY DUVERNAY GETS THE BALL
How is that not a horsecollar lol
Can you fucking run the ball
He said Murray AGAIN
That's a horse collar no
Why do I keep saying Murray?  Lol
"smh he keeps saying murray, this is fucked up, at some point he needs to stop"
Called him Murray again
At least Duvernay has been a positive
That's a ticky tack call..
Lol even the commentator realises he's saying Murray...
lol how many times is gumble going to call lamar “Murray”
Why didn’t Hollywood try to juke a LB??
Hollywood looking good today baby.
I love how he calls him Murray during the play then calls him Lamar Jackson 5 seconds later
Just keep saying Murray fuck it lol
Lamar is not looking healthy based on that run
"sucks that that was called back, but it's nice to see a deception run playcall"
Looks like that guy got hit by a bus
Hollywood looks like Rick Moranis Dark helmet character from spaceballs.
Finally Lamar I'm used to. Defense never know whether he's gonna run or pass.
The only new thing I've learned from this game is the announcers suck
Whats the Murray count at?
Announcers bad. Duvernay good
"GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY, BOGER"
No idea WTF Lamar was doing on that play.
Another pass play. WTF Roman. This is giving me gray hairs...
"Again, 2 receivers right next to each other, standing still."
Interference by the ref
"Run it Lamar, try and make something happen"
Or our receivers are unable to seperate...
Romans gotta go
Incompetent play calling. This game should be over by now.
That drive isn't on Lamar imo
35 attempts and we still have 20+ minutes. What is this game plan.
Looks like missing a couple days of practice has limited Lamar more than we thought it would
Marcus Peters Game MVP
I really wonder if we’re just experimenting with the play calling at this point
God bless our defense. One side of the ball is behind spectacular today.
Does burrow even know what throwing the ball away is ?
Fall on it lol
MP JUICEMAN
Wait that's illegal you cant bat the ball like that
The offense needs to wake the hell up
We need to be better about running more often but if Lamar can’t pick it up when we don’t there’s an issue
I hope we don't use this game as a reason not to add pieces to our defense
LET'S GO OFFENSE LET'S PUT UP ANOTHER 17 AND CLOSE THIS GAME
Ok put it away on this drive. Run on 1st and 2nd down please Greg.
"It's time for the 8-minute, 16 rushing attempt TD drive."
Ingram did something!
"So far, our defense is winning this game. Offense hasn't mustered much of anything since the 1st"
We’ve built plays to get Duvernay in space. Now do other wrs lol
It's as if running the ball is our strength
Anyone else see AJ green say “trade me?”
This is the way.
Hey Roman would you look at that? The run game works!
3 straight stupid passing play calls incoming.
Need a tall WR imo
Wow.  Who would have thought we could run the ball well?
"Wow, RUNNING THE BALL WORKS"
TRUZZZZZZZ
We run the ball so well I love it
u/GregRoman: see what happens when you run the ball?
It's like they didn't practice this week at all
I think Boykin may have been confused on the route there
Boykin is trash
Burrow seeing ghosts
“Make these corners compete” not sure that’s my advice against Marlo
28 consecutive games scoring 20+. 2nd most all time (most is 30)
Announcers cheer leaders for Bengals now
Lamar should really just ignore the fact that Boykins is on the field no point in even looking his way
Does Judson not like to wrap up?
Judon gifting another free down. WTF...
Judon has not been making plays.
"Yep, Judon again."
Still weird seeing someone wearing \#92 that isn't Ngata. I miss him
17 mil
Van Halen got me big sad
lol this is getting ridiculous.  their pass pro is straight garbage
Burrow just sitting down now lol
Fuck I *almost* feel sad for Burrow
Every single one of our DBs is a better pass rusher than Judon
Damn the Bengals need to get Burrow an oline to keep him alive
"At least Burrow didn't get hit that play, just went down, smart play"
Marlo our best pass rusher
Run ball eat clock.
"Cincinnati Matadors

Olé"
Eagles fucking suck come on man I want first place back lol
Use Gus Bus
Judon is really just out there running around
Burrow out here seeing ghosts
"FOR FUCK SAKES! We are up 20, RUN THE FUCKING BALL"
Jackson is straight up just not having a good game
It's a SACK PARTY! We now have 7 on the day. @ChuckC36 and @marlon_humphrey both get in on the action - @Ravens
Its raining so lets keep throwing!
This oline is not doing well. Lamar is getting tricked on easy stuff. Time to go back to the study room and practice field to figure this out
Lamar has looked sharp on some throws and totally off on others.  Inconsistent game today.
😞
Offense looks so asleep today
"Better be becuase Lamar is hurt 

&#x200B;

(and it better not be serious)"
"Good to see we had a day where defense picked up when the offense struggled. We have a lot to clean up on offense. Oline is struggling a bit, we need some faster developing plays. 

I don't get why we never ever run slants and let Hollywood catch and run away through the defense"
Roman needs to stop overthinking this game and hop on the Gus Bus
If this offense was alive today we would’ve been up by 50 or something
Fumble 6!
QUEEEEEEN ME!!
Marlon is a g
Muh Queen
#YES QUEEN
YAAAAAS QUEEN
The streak stays alive until next week!
The defense won this game.
MARLO PUNCH!
lol queen got more TDs than burrow
MARLON TOP 2 NOT 2
Humphrey punch again lol
Queen getting aallll the nice stats
#MARLON LFG YESSSS
DROY!
FRUIT PUUUUNCH
Defense is putting on a show
Patented Marlo Punch
Humphrey is Peanut Punch 2.0
Marlonnn PUNCH
"Humphrey is the G.O.A.T.




Change my mind"
Lol this game is something
Just got home. I am extremely pleased with this score and Marlon Humphrey is amazing. But I’m seeing tons of complaining posts? Is the score misleading? How had the offense looked?
"Eagles with 15 straight points against the steelers, only down by 2 now  👀"
Only Ingram has more yards on the ground than Queen. But Queen has a TD
Marlon going for the DPOY award. Move over TJ/Myles.
Honestly if the defense can just score and keep the offense off the field we might make it to the afc championship game.
And that's 20 straight quarters scoring points.
"As frustrating as this game has been at times, it felt nice to go back to the Flacco era for a game. Still need to fix our shit for next week though"
Anyone know how I can get an official black Marlon jersey?
So THAT'S how they save game balls for the players. Cool shot! The more you know.
"With how well our defense has been playing we should be up by 40, but NOOOOO.... Roman is allergic to running and Lamar is lost out there."
Philly is trying to make a game of it...
RG3 coming in on our next drive or they gonna make Lamar play it out?
Raiders up on the Chiefs
Does Lamar stay out for the last drive to try and work on some issues or are we gonna see RG3 for the rest of the game?
Marlon is a young Pat Tillman
"Philly game is gonna be interesting. Their team may be trash but their DL is lethal. They are going to see what cincy did (rolling coverage underneath, creeper blitzes) and will try to emulate it."
So what are the odds Hump wins dpoty and Queen wins Droty if they keep up their pace.
Calais Campbell is a grown ass man!
Burrow always just handing it off real quick now LOL he shook
Let’s go Raiders!
Fuck you Philly...
when did brown start returning?
Uhhhh we didn’t play the chiefs last week
Dude on the Raiders HAS to try harder to pick up that first. I get momentum and such makes it hard but he didn't even extend his arm.
Another stale passing game to start.
"On rushing - the Ravens’ lead rushers by carries are Gus and Ingram. They’re averaging less than 3.25 yards a carry. 

The Ravens are NOT a great run team this year. It’s not the same team and not the same OL. This isn’t last year."
The announcers just said groman deserves a lot of credit. I knew they were senile but that seals the deal
Who wants to start the fire Greg Roman petition?
"I think Lamar was hurt more than we were led to believe, and that makes his performance a bit easier to stomach."
"Roman, we just had a tremendous run, yet you insist on dialing up weird pass plays :("
"This is a game we need to try and get a passing game going. I want to run just as much as anyone, but at some point, we will need to fall on the pass, right now, that isn’t going to happen. Let’s use this game to try get it going."
Judon earning no contract rn
two straight takeaways lol. Glad we could cover for Judon sucking.
Lamar has overthrown receivers way too much this year. He really needs to work on these deep balls
RUN THE FUCKING BALL
Was a bad pass Andrews was opem
Can we start FUCKING BLOCKING so Lamar doesn't die jesus
Longsnapper getting a tackle nbd
"Roman's amnesia towards running is back. They run the ball with great success, but once again it gets abandoned. Why not keep running it?"
What is wrong with Lamar this year?
Lamar needs to have his memory of the titans and KC games removed. I think its fucking with him.
Oh shit 60+
We should be annihilating this team by 4 scores right now
We need a new kicker
"I never thought I'd be upset at a 3 score halftime lead but HO. LEE. FUCK. Roman is such garbage. with how the defense has played this should be at least a 4 score game. 

Ultimately it probably doesn't matter, I doubt cincy comes back here, but this is the sort of garbage you CANNOT allow against good teams. 

Greg needs to clean his shit up asap."
I honestly don't know who some of you are poo pooing a 17-0 shutout at halftime right now. Are all these people 2019 bandwagoners? I will take a comfortable halftime lead over any team in the NFL.
Terrible play calls lmao. You have all halftime and that's how you open?
"If y'all haven't already, listen to the Truss Levelz podcast with Mark Ingram and Cam Jordan. They had Hollywood on and it's a great interview about how his career started"
PLEASE SIGN ANTONIO BROWN
At this point we need to get a petition going to sign AB.
AB: yall need any wide receivers?
Ok can the dumb Ingram slander in this sub stop now?
"Running the ball effectively all drive, then you throw it deep on 3rd and 3? Eat shit come on man"
"Boykin played that like it was a run play. Lamar shotput it out of bounds so it wouldn't have mattered anyways.

Burn this tape."
I appreciate Jimmy trying to get a PI there
Nobody say anything bad about that pass or you’re just a hater!
"The thing that makes Lamar great is the fact that he is fast as fuck and illusive, but nah let’s not play to his strengths"
The run game is not good this year. It’s not a magic bullet that Roman isn’t using. They’re just not run blocking well at all.
Lamar is having his second “worst game of his career” in the last 3 weeks this is getting super concerning
We can keep the shut out if they aren't pussies and go for TDs
"Looks like 14-2 was an overachievement, not a standard"
27-0 is pretty good guys
This has to be one of the worst wins in a long time for us
"Man, Hollywood, take the fucking hit"
"Key to the game: Pressure Joe Burrow early and do not let him get into any rhythm

I don't want any rookie Mitchell Trubisky flashbacks today."
O/U on the Murray counter is 22. Any bets boys??
"Why the hell are we going for it? Up 17, put their backs to the goal line"
Is this commentator fucking cracked? Best play Andrews has made all day?!
"Looks like 2 rookie QBs today. 

Just bad decisions under pressure. Trying to make a play when the play is over. Smh. Lamar must have been reading his press clipings in between workouts."
Two minute drill let’s see some deep passes to Hollywood
"Lets call a spade a spade, the blocking isn’t good anymore. We need a speed back to take any hole we can get. Dobbins should get way more carries in this offense"
"Lamar now has more pass attempts at halftime than he should have had for the entire game. Makes zero sense. Averaging almost 8 yards per carry, but we continue to throw."
"13 total rushes and 29 pass attempts is the story of this game. They cant just transition to this. We need more runs, read options, and designed qb runs. Too much passing."
"So people are going to say/ or saying ""why is Lamar throwing so much? Just playing devil's advocate...the ravens running game is low key bad. They get a chunk of their yardage when up big, look at the stats from the previous wins. I, personality, think JK Dobbins is our best back for this current team and we should use him more (best receiving rb of the 3). Ingram looks old and our Oline just looks horrible at run blocking. I think coaches decided, if we lose its better to lose with Lamar throwing than out run game getting exposed."
"It just seems like any throwing play that's called Lamar literally doesn't have the time necessary for the pay to develop and is forced to do something with the ball or just get sacked 20 times a game. The o line has no protection for him to safely sit there and wait for these horrible calls to develop. He has 2 targets. The rest is just the actors who don't get a roll in the credits. It's easy to predict gromans play calls and to tell we just won't run the ball. Hence why it seems every defense gets deep in our backfield. Defense have become aware of what it takes to stop Lamar. And that's take away his team, and have 2 minimum linebackers watching him to step up to the line when he breaks out of the pocket. And groman has not done a thing to stop that or help."
WHY. ARE. WE. STILL. PASSING????
Stop saying Murray you fucking bum
Lol gus just destroyed that DT lolol
Pretty awful offense. It just feels so weird.
Might need a young OC next season because this is not it
FLACCO TD
"Oh look ma, another Judon special. One more for the hat trick"
This offense does not have the same magic as last year and that worries me
Queen capitalizes.
Or defense has scored more than their offence. Best D performance in a long time
These announcers racist af!
If our offense stuck to the actual game plan instead of trying to prove it’s a passing offense we could have had 50 points today.
"#TUCKER MISSED WHAT A SCRUB LMAO

/s"
People are acting like Lamar hasn't been regressing since the Texans game.
Lamar looks awful this year.
Lamar just not on point today.
Damn that was a stupid throw by Lamar
"Tin foil hat...

Lamars knee is more serious then the team is leading on and we are play calling accordingly?"
"Go figure Chase Claypool is balling out while Boykin is shitting the bed. How TF do we always miss on Wars while Pittsburgh hits?!?!


EDIT: WRs"
WAKE THE FUCK UP
"Some of the oline decisions this year have been interesting. Ravens really don’t like Fluker at guard, or do they just really want him to be their tackle depth? I get the depth point of keeping him in reserve, but if he can run block hard at Guard, it could be a better starting line potentially? Interesting to say the least"
"AJ Green has been quiet, let’s hope it stays this way.

He’s a Ravens killer!

I’d like to see Duverney get more looks today.

Should be a great game, hope the rain stays away"
Ask about the poop nate
I hope we win
*Ahem* Caw.
I’m excited. Football makes me happy.
"Found an unopened chrome cast sitting around the house that I got as a gift a while back. Decided to set it up, but it turns out you have to have iOS 12 or later to set it up and since I have an iPhone 5 I can’t even download that software. Pretty annoyed you can’t just set it up on your computer, but I guess it’s watching on the laptop for me today."
LETSSSSS GOOOOOO
2am game day lets go!
Why did we keep chris Moore just to inactive him every week
Fuck the bengals
[deleted]
"hi everyone!

have a good day!"
Wish we had on the purple jersey black pants combo. Truly one of the best ever.
Campbell towers over everyone lol
Good defense!!!
That's it right there!
Yo let’s get some sacks dline....please
Did Harbs catch Burrow’s out of bounds throw?
"Proche bailed out, lol"
OMG!!! That playcall was SWEET!!!
I am liking this playcalling.
Duve is our lord and saviour
He's fast yo
Run the ball!
K.o getting carted off in Kc
Duve got some damn wheels. I thought he was gone
I wanna see more duvernay on my screen
"Son, I am proud of you"
Goddamn it
Forgot Bynes when there lol why. Guess that’s the life of an nfl journeyman
Damn it man.
All I can see is that crazy left lean now when Tucker kicks
"trying way too hard to force the pass to work. If the run is working, do that shit until they stop it."
I see we are trying to be a pass heavy team early again.  Smh
Dev Duv was wide open there!
This offense just isn't clicking this year and they're still rolling over the teams they should roll over. Imagine what it'll be like if they get it together.
"We need to be finishing more of our drives, but I'll definitely take the points"
Feel like we're going to be using Tucker a lot more this year
We continue forcing the pass every week
"Like, is greg Roman just a big tease? Pulls out a run play for big then calls 2 throws that are just easily defended. I'm almost half expected to see a ""haha I've just been joking the first half"""
"Gus, jk, mark, Lamar, j hill, but nah let’s pass on 1st down"
Do people get the cutouts sent to them after the game?
The fuck is that big ass dude wide open?
I will never get over Tyler Boyd. Dude haunts me
Nice wheels
Proof Burrow is the Bengals
A good throw and that's an INT lol
I can't imagine what it's like running away from Calais Campbell...
So who's a realistic player we could add for consistent pressure?
Feels good to actually get consistent pass rush for once.
We better not play soft man or zone here.
good stop LFG
"Analysts have Queen as an excellent athlete that's having trouble learning his responsibilities at the position, but he flashes anyway. So i'm very excited for him"
Ew
That screen pass was so obvious lol
Lol Hollywood to scared to get yards
Really... swing pass to brown?!?! Is that the best Greg Roman has?!?!
Has passing to Marquise behind the LOS ever gotten us yards?
I am worried about Hollywood again. Avoids contact like he's hiding a rib injury or something.
That play should not go to Brown
Brown goes out of his way just so he won’t get hit...
Hollywood is eventually going to have to take contact. Like sometimes you need an extra yard or two. I've never seen him take on contact
Marquise beefed up but he still looks like a kid out there lol
That made no sense
There u go Marquise
"Hell yes, seems like forever since we've converted a third down with a pass"
Someone find Lamar's deep ball plz
RUN THE BALL
Lamar has awesome off-angle passes. GOTTA get that deep ball settled though.
Gain 6 yds on first down. Tjrow behind the line to our smallest offensive player. Come on GRo.
Duvernay has really found his place and I love it
First down runs set up 3rd and short all season last year.  Why have we abandoned this?
Pat Is 305 lbs?! What?!
Holy Fuck Andrews 😂😂😂
#AERIAL ANDREWS
Should have stuck landing -
I give it a 10/10
Jesus what a scary tackle
Lmaaaaaaao Andrews Got table topped
I 100% thought that ball was flying out on that flip lmao
That was scary looking
Run the god damn ball
Lamar gotta throw that ball away
DAMN Andrews
"We cant afford to have our TEs get hurt, we only got two lol."
I hate our passing game.
This offense just been looking out of sync the last few games
Mark Andrews with the crazy flip
We need to pipe in bullshit chants for when the refs throw flags.
He thinks he watching kyler Murray
Second and 14? Lets pass the ball. Why set up for a reasonable third?
"What the fuck, is this announcer drunk?"
Why the fuck does he keep saying Murray???
Mandrews came to play today thank god
"Damn, hell of a conversion there. Lamar had to sit in there and feel that pressure"
Wait shouldn’t that penalty call the play dead?
Lamar/Andrews!  Better combo than bacon and eggs.
Just me or has Lamar lost his touch on quite a few of these passes?
Ok u can stop calling him that now Greg
Slandrews!
MURRAY AGAIN
Slip that guy a note and tell him his name is Jackson
This offense just looks slow and hesitant
Someone get me this clown’s twitter and Im gonna tell him to put some RESPECK on Lamar’s name.
MANDREWS
Murray Ingram?  Owns a deli.
Harbaugh has been working on his mask game
Surprised he didn’t call him Kamara instead of Ingram...
I wish they would show more all 22 replays like that. Maybe people will get to see who’s actually open/not open instead of instantly blaming the QB. lol
TOUCHDOWN
#MANDREWS CAME TO FUCKING PLAY
"I love ingram, love him. But get Dobbins in here."
He did it AGAIN! It's not Murray
#MANDREWS
THE FLIPPER SCORES
MURRAY!!
Murray takes the snap
Thank God for Mark Andrews. Dude is so fucking great
ANDREWS OKAY
"A sloppy looking drive, but it paid off! :P"
Lol that's a man's catch
This drive was brought to you by MAndrews!!!!
And 1
"Actually it is Murray Andrews.  For us, though, we shorten it to ""MAndrews."""
MANDREWS
Gumble got my tired brain all confused rn
The Ravens just methodically choke the life out of opponents this year.
Mandrews with the TD!!!
Even with some intense interference Mandrews pulls it down.
That was a dot
"Steelers getting help down the field by the refs. What a joke 🙄

ALSO. MANDREWS!!"
Lamar looked so poised in the pocket
"God damn that guy was ALL OVER Andrews then, great throw and catch for the score"
"my best kicker in the league, just incase you were wondering.(;"
Yo who the bleep is Murray
Is Lamar Jackson/Murray a Dr. Jekyll/Mr. Hyde type of thing?
BIG MAN PLAYS
Is it me or is Lamar's long pass not as good as it was last season?
"Lamar looks like he's struggled a little this year I'm finding the open receiver at the right time. A lot of times he's pulled back for a throw, pump pump pump, and then throws it into traffic. This TD isn't a perfect example, but it just seems like he's doing that a lot this year and it all seems to be related to being uncertain. Huge assumption and guesses obviously, but just an observation."
"Glad that Mike Andrews, Jason Tucker, Justin Hill, and Marvin Humphries finally have their leader for the blertimore footbirds: Lamurray Jackson"
The crowd noise is way too loud on CBS. Are there actual people there?
how long till this commentator calls burrow flacco
MP JUICEMAN
Did we just blitz marlon?? Tf we say about that
Peters!!!
MP JUICEMAN
Turnover streak stays alive
The QB pressure feeds Marcus Peters!
WHAT WAS THE WIDE RECEIVER DOING?
MP GRAPE JUICE MAN
thanks burrow 😂
#THE STREAK LIVES ON
24 is both the most exciting and most frustrating DB I've seen on the Ravens.
There it is
Pass rush that works create turnovers!
Best defensive quarter we've had all season. Actual pass rush 😍
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
galaxy brain lamar
What was Green doing?
AJ green playing like a Raven
"Okay, all joking aside what the hell is with the Murray nonsense, dude the reigning MVP and you don’t know his damn name"
Ok let's go Lamurray
lmao. Looked like Peters motioned for Green to block for him
Oh I thought he was hurt
Marcus peters is definitely living up to his boom or bust reputation this year
"Ravens Twitter is on top of shit.  No sooner had Peters caught the ball, did they have a tweet on it."
Big yikes by Burrow on that decision. That's the rookiest thing I've ever seen him do so far this season.
Jeez refs.  Figure it out
"Smart to throw that away instead of taking the huge loss... wish our failed end-arounds knew how to do that

[edit] guess the blocking means ineligible man downfield"
What is the Murray count
This guy loves Murray
Murray!
They don’t offset ??? Weird
How does he not know this is Lamar jackson? He doesn't have to look at his player number list to know it's Lamar jackson. Obviously his sheet says Murray for #8. How dense does someone have to be to be not recognize that
Gumbel is like who Lamar Jackson is? I only know a Murray
Is this announcer senile?
15 yards for touching.
He said Jackson!!
"That’s a little acting there by Lamar hahaha

I’ll take it tho"
Who’s Lamar Jackson?
"Not gonna lie, Lamar was playing that shove up like a Premier League player."
Mark Andrews this game man 💯
Great play by Murray
Is there a running count on how many times Lamar gets called Murray?
"Mark Andrews is having himself a game guys, really proud of our boy so far."
HOLLYWOOD HILL
HOLLYWOOD
THERE WE GO
FINALLY A HOLLYWOOD TD
Lamar is so fucking good in the redzone man
At least we embraced the Murray into a new meme. We can thank his fuck ups for the hilarious memes upcoming
All to easy
HOLLYWOOD HOPKINS
Hollywood got one!
Murray to Hill for the TD
Flacco looking stoic in the pocket.
AYYYY 1ST TOUCHDOWN OF MANY FOR THE YEAR FOR HOLLYWOOD BROWN
Some tight throws
Short comoflauged Marquise literally impossible to see in the end zone
I’m loving Hollywood’s headband!!
hell yes!!! Get marquise brown that td!!!
Hollywood!
"I'm crap with mem making, but someone's got to do a Photoshop of a Murry's Steaks box with Lamar on it"
We’re fucking business
HollyWOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
**LETS GO MURRAYS**
All the time baker spends in the stadium and still does not have a winning season
"was hoping this would be a get right game for both our offense and defense, and I'm pretty happy so far."
"Go kyler, go!"
"Lol, we’re like 4 seconds into the 2nd quarter and they’re like “Cincinnati needs to abandon all plans! The game is over!!”"
"Do you guys remember the game last year then kept calling out boys ""Mark Jackson"" and ""Lamar Ingram?"""
Lol the bengals returner running like he shit his pants! 😂😂😂
Marquise Goodwin with the TD
"Don ""Murray"" Martindale is bringing the heat today"
Lets go Iggles beat dem stillers
time to unleash madubuike
I want another Lamarvelous run. For old times sake.
"Let's go, Iggles! Battle of Pennsylvania. Tied 7-7."
That throw for the Brown TD was beautiful. Jackson's getting pretty good at those across the body passes.
Gotta get the sack there but good play d
judon almost had him
"Another whiff by Judon, lol"
So close Matt
Sacking like Burrow is breathing Covid in their faces...
Jesus christ call a fucking hold
Judon if you could finish your have like 4 more sacks this year alone
Judon sucks
Ah the classic judon feast game
We gotta get those maaaaan
Anyone watching the Cardinals game able to tell us how many times they’ve called Kyler *Lamar*?
SIT UR ASS DOWN
False shart
Joker living up to his nickname right there lmao
Judon was definitely offsides
Pick negated by offside?
FUCKING JUDON
FUCK YOU JUDON
Damnit Judon
Judon go fuck yourself
Trade Judon right now smh....
Judon your fired
goddammit
God damn Judon is so fucking bad
damn it judon
Ferguson setting an edge? Pump that shit into my veins.
Great job Judon! Stellar
Dog house incoming
At this point I don’t even want Judon for vet min get him the fuck out
"It's a free play, dumb announcer"
Only reason Burrow threw that was cause he knew there was a penalty
Lol powned from the back
Flacco is 6/9 for 39 yards
We can not get rid of judon soon enough.
Thanks Judon
#QUEEEEEN
Back to back turnovers LOL
The Queen in the North!
"I repeat, Bengals gonna Bengal."
Judon LOL
we giving backshots out here boys
"Lol, I feel so bad for Burrow. The poor guy's just getting bullied and clobbered 😂"
OH GOOD HIT QUEEN
Queen!!!!!
QUEEN
Judon and offsides....name a more iconic duo
HIS NAME IS PATRICK MOTHERFUCKING QUEEN
Lol that o line is gonna get Joe killed
I do fucking love queen
Damn I should have said MUH QWEEEEN!!!
LFG Queen
Where’s dobbins?
MUH QUEEN
Burrow just got dominated lol
Burrow is getting whacked out there
[deleted]
Just realized Queen and Burrow used to be buddies at LSU. Must suck getting strip sacked by a friend 😂😂
Queen hitting his former teammate who is now a Bengal that hard forcing a fumble is a fucking piece of art
I hope we fuck Big Ben up like this
bengals fan coming in here w respect. y’all are good. expected this to be closer but i forgot about our horrible o line. hoping y’all win division instead of the steelers or browns.
I feel like Madubuike is making a difference as well. We finally look a bit better at pressuring. Now to keep it up against better offensive lines!!!
These announcers love Burrow. Meanwhile he's having a shitty game...and they can't get the reigning MVP name's right
"What sucks is after this game everyone will say that we only play well against bad teams, solely based off of the chiefs game. It’s like, did you not watch us beat up 6 playoff teams last year??"
"Love the Ravens but man it's hard to see Burrow have such a shit line, he's a great talent"
We need to go for it on fourth. The dagger.
That wasn't the greatest playcall.
"Mekari may just need to start at guard at this point, line is holding up a little better today"
Yeah go for it.
Let him kick it
"Burrow is definitely talented and if the Bengals can build around him they will be a threat.

However, that’s a tall task for a team who consistently sucks at drafting like Cincinnati does."
Just saw Zrebiec say Powers in at RG. I didn't notice when we switched away from Mekari?
"I didn't want to go for that. One of the few times I agree with commentators. You're up 17, and defense is paying lights out."
I have no problem going for that.  I hate punting inside the 50
You know who to put in if you’re going to throw on 4th down!
"lamar needs to be sharper, i feel like he's forcing it"
"Poor throw, he had him but not sure I like the decision to go for it."
Well that was a spirited play call...
If we know we’re going for it on 4th then why not run the ball with this record breaking RB group on 3rd?
Who tf can we rely on besides MAndrews...Hollywood? Sometimes.
"Good decision and good call, had him but just overthrew him."
we need to run the fucking ball too
That was Murray not Lamar... 👀
Lamar missing a lot of throws again.
Lamar makes awful throw to open receiver: Run the ball!!! Wtf why are we passing!!! Fuck you roman!
Looks like we need more options on offense
Offense is getting a little cheeky and sloppy after dominating so far. We have too much football left
"I don't like how lamar throws the ball on 9 routes to the right. He doesn't put air under it. He just guns it. 

I think it has something to do w/ his low release point. He needs to get the ball up & over more, especially on those types of routes. 

It's a mechanical issue. Can that be fixed at this point?"
Black jerseys look neato
Fort played that so well
Offensive holding sighting!
Mcphee looking fantastic
Just turned the game on- can someone do a TLDR of what's happened so far? How we looking today?
Lamar will be fine. But he is anticipating pressure every play and rushing every read.
Holy shit! A 4-man pass rush sighting!
Is mad boogie the pass rush difference...?
"Given the way our defense looked there, we would have likely had a safety if we punted the ball"
SACKED AGAIN I LOVE IT
"Apparently, 2014 Pernell McPhee replaced modern day McPhee right before this last drive..."
Gus gets extra yardage just falling down.
Andrews playing great D
"Lamar, you gotta learn to throw it OUT"
Love Gus. Want more
Good defense Andrews
Lamar is playing way too cocky
Eeek.  Lamar don't  do that
Idk if you can tell but Rich Gannon used to be a Quarterback. He very rarely mentions it
Lamar better buy mandrews a beer
Lamar... wtf are you doing?
Show me your ___________
We need Ben Grubbs
Lol yeah Cox!!!
"hmmmmm, can't remember the last time I saw Cox in on a tackle"
"The google stat trackers aren't working today. Kind of annoying, I like to keep an eye on what else is happening in the league"
OT. Iggles are giving the Steelers all they can handle so far.
"Let's get a stop here and get the ball to end the half and start the 3rd. Come on, Wink!"
"Bengals O really struggling out there. We're getting pressure with 4 regularly, 5 is almost too much for the line to handle. So night/day compared to the Chiefs game"
Bowser and Ferg are showing a lot more promise this season.
">When you walk through the garden  
>  
>You gotta watch your back  
>  
>Well I beg your pardon  
>  
>Walk the straight and narrow track"
How is this the first time I've heard The Wire music in a Ravens broadcast?!
Anyone know how Flacco is doing?  Stats not showing up on Google for me.  Score 7-0 tho Cards.
WTF JK
Gotta love JK
Joe burrow looks so sad lol
This is why we need to use Dobbins more often
"That was a great throw to Hollywood, but good D on it."
JK!!! Get him touches!
Good pass finally
That could've been caught.
JK DOBBINS HOLY SHIT WHAT A BEAST
Can we please start giving dobbins touches in the 1st quarter of games
I like the deep shot after the run. I know it’s taboo here to say something positive about the play calling
That was a nice pass + nice protection
Yeah give the ball to Dobbins more
Yeah stop fucking around give it to JK
Dobbins sighting!
Jesus lamar.  Threw it right to him
"Jesus, that’s two weeks in a row we’ve turned in over in that scenario"
What the fuck throw was that?
Lamar what is you doing bby?
Hollywood needs to catch that ball and our oline needs to do better
Where the fuck was that ball even going?
"Great run by Dobbins!

He'll probably only get two more carries today!"
Burrow is getting killed every play
That ball came out disgusting
Shaking My God Damn Fucking Head. Can we give Gro a shot of covid so we can find a better play caller.
Goddamn Lamar
"I want to hit Roman, the amount of incomplete, incomplete, 3rd and 10 hard blitzed is annoying as shit. Why in the fuck would you not run on 2nd and 10, dobbins just ran for 30 fucking yards, they are literally sabotaging lamar"
What game is Greg Gumbel watching
Burrow is gonna get David Carr’d
"Good God, Borrow will be lucky to walk off the field after this game"
Lamar doesn’t even look like he wants to be out there
Burrow won't survive the year with this line
Will they at some point take Burrow out to keep him whole?
Lamar havin a shitty game :/
OBJ blocking absolutely no one yet again.
"Bro who is Gilchrist, he’s getting a lot of playing time"
Gerry Sandusky is roasting opposing players' names on the audio broadcast lmao
I love hearing those pads pop!
So are we gonna throw a ball to Boykin oooorrrrrr...
"I don’t understand how we can watch from the outside and realize that Lamar succeeds when our rush offense is churning. Roman is refusing to play to his strengths. So damn frustrating. Last season was a great balance and it showed that when the run was established, Lamar could do anything through the air."
Why are we not playing out of the pistol anywhere near as much this year?
"Don't need to use timeouts when 2nd down is incomplete and 3rd down goes OOB. Thanks, Bengals!"
This team is really really reliant on momentum in the passing game you can’t have dropped passes and missed throws it takes a toll in the moral of the offense
Yes its a rookie and the Bengals but boy our D is playing well today.
David Culley is who we thought he was.
Holly wood didn't just go out wow
"They have a free rusher on every play because they're sending the house, trusting that Lamar can't make the throws."
Burrow is just being eaten alive.
Has Lamar run once yet?
Why has LJ been so hesitant to take off?
61 yarder incoming
Damn
NOOOO TUCKER WHY
RIP
No 61 yarder 😔
Still the goat
Fuck.
"Tucker missed. That tells you all you need to know about how this game is going so far. 

In all seriousness tho, shit happens, even the best in the league gets a mulligan every now and then"
"He missed one boys, time to release him"
Should've known once they started hyping him up
"Damn  hate that the first miss was from 60+. No one will blame him, but I was hoping for a perfect season from the GOAT"
"Pretty bad week for Lamar huh? Knee injury, plus the thing with his friend and all. Man that's crazy"
Damn Osemele down with a knee injury
"I knew we passed a lot in the first half, but 29 attempts already? maybe we're running all second half, so Lamar had to get a game's worth of passes in the first half"
I think these kinds of games are better for us in a long run
"hopefully they are just using this game to force the pass to iron things out, it wouldn't be the worst scheduled game to do it on. i'm still very worried about what i see"
"Has Lamar EVER had -4 yards?

Like ever?"
It's not raining at fed hills wtf
What if there’s a bigger game plan. A season long plan. Keep RBs fresh so they aren’t injured and tired at the end of the year.
“Dealing with wet balls”
That was like the 4th almost INT.
Jesus
these plays we are running lmaooooo what the fuck
Feelsbadman :(
This is awful to watch. Wheres the patience?
"Our offense would be so much better if we utilized drags, outs, slants, and screens but for some reason Roman refuses to run anything that takes less than 5 seconds to develop."
Does Burrows always look grumpy or is it just today?
Bottom text
BOOM
"WOOF, Burrow lit the fuck up!"
Nice of burrow not to make Elliott look silly with his speed
"lol, we sent both safeties"
"It certainly feels like McPhee turned his clock back to 2014, doesn't it?"
"Poor Burrow, worst division for him to be drafted to with that o-line"
I swear we just refuse to use Jackson’s athleticism
The Ravens have 14 total rush attempts lol
We are still in fucking shotgun
My Patrick Queen rookie of the year +1200 bet looking pretty nice right about now
Finally!
ITS MURRAY UP THE MIDDLE
Wtf that was such a soft hold.
LETS KEEP DOING THESE SCREENS
“Why do I keep calling him Murray?” Is this guy demented?
"Please give duv more playing time, he's outplaying Boykin by a mile"
Bryant Gumbel is DREADFUL today
Murray!
Hollywood made good on that
A GOOD PLAY???
Much better Lamar!!
I mean we are playing awful but that was just a good fucking block....
I'm making this comment so i can remember the last time the Raven's made a screen that worked.
Gumble is demented
"Yes, why???"
Must be embarrassing to be stiff armed by the smallest guy in the league.
Eagles are fucking useless
Lamar could have easily run there...
"Finally seeing the ""old"" Lamar"
The Bus broke a Bengal
Hollywood's ballin out today
That Bengal looks like he got hit by a bus!
Can't keep lamar down for long.
WTF Bozeman lol
Ben Powers replaced Patrick Mekari at right guard?
Nice 3rd down conversion through the air
You’d think you could remember the name of last years season MVP
[deleted]
"Ingram looks like an aging rb now, not cutting running into his linemans asses."
Has anyone else noticed the players are sharing a single water bottle? Aren’t they supposed to have their own? Random thought.
Lamar has drive to always clean up his mistakes we good guys!
Ref lol
Jfc just get rid of the ball.
"As frustrating as the play calling is, I agree with what several others have said. In an easily winnable game, why not take the opportunity to work on our deficiencies, as opposed to doubling down on our strength (run game)"
Lol even the official gets the stiff arm
Unrelated but I love these Mark Hamill Jon Stewart Uber eats commercials.
HOLY SHIT SOMEONE FUCKING CHIP THE EDGE ON A BOOT. How does this keep happening????
lmfao
I kinda wanted a fake punt just to see some action...
Even Lamar juking out refs
"Lamar seems as if he wants to prove that he’s a QB. He has lanes to run with, but he feels as if he needs to shake the RB narrative."
This is not the offense I fell in love with last year. I'm getting so frustrated with this playcalls and decisions
Time to throw on Redzone and watch this game on mute. These announcers are unbelievably stupid
so can like someone explain to me why romans REFUSES to run the fucking ball??
Last year lamar would have taken off for like 20 yards. What the fuck is going on? This offense went from unstoppable to looking totally lost.
35 pass attempts midway through the 3rd quarter....🤔🤔🤔
Why is Roman still passing the fucking ball I think this man is legitimately braindead
At least the defense is good
God lamar hasn’t looked sharp at all since KC
Just fall on the damn ball!
"Slick ball, damn it"
"We need better interior o-line. The Bengals are getting way too much pressure. Overall things could be worse, but with a better line Lamar has more time do the receivers can get open and he has time to make better decisions and get set to throw better passes."
Thank God for our Defense
"14-yard run, time to pass"
oh look a run!
I wish we had some damn route running receivers that can get open.
This playcallint literally has me fucking baffled.
We ran the ball and good things happened FUNNY THAT
Oh my god a first down
Wow this looks like 2019
"yes ingram! that's what we fucking need, would you look at that! running works"
Who said Ingram is done??
Mark heard y'all
Why are we not passing? /s
Vintage Ingram
Lol these announcers
Bout time. I’d rather just keep pounding the rock than rely on this o line for pass protection right now. No need to pass at all.
"If LJ's knee is bugging him, it'd explain some of his poopy throws. Shit starts from the ground up"
Shit yea Ingram
"Wow, I wonder what the score would be rn if we had run the ball more than 5 times in the last 4 drives"
our offense and defense is straight up bad statistically rn
So you saying running the ball works well too?
Now maybe from now on we can start running the ball 3 quarters sooner?
Um... What?
That shift is fresh  tho
AutomaTUCK
I play Madden a lot and this is where a db misses a tackle on a Mixon run between the tackles to ruin the shutout.
Another 3 and out pls....with a few hits on the side
3rd and 3 and been destroying them on the ground and you don't run play action? Probably would've guaranteed an open right end
Ocho Cinco
Judon missed tackle again lol
Boykin is supposed to be a jump ball receiver and he doesn't even jump. Just give Duvernay his reps. He needs them and would hardly be worse
"Man, Judon is not even good in coverage.   Is there anything this guy actually excells at?"
Ferguson has been making plays.
Sack Daddy setting the edge like a pro
"Fuck off, Judon."
Judon is so bad my lord
Judon come on man
I'm I the only one that's noticed Burrow has too much air on nearly all of his throws?
"Pass rush a bit better but not super confidence-inspiring. Offensive line seemed to have played a bit better like the first 2 drives and now back to turnstiles. Lamar is getting pressured like crazy. Boykin, I like you, but Duv >"
Welcome to the nfl burrow
HUMPHREY! Dude is so good in coverage he's been invisible all game
Up 20 to 0 in the 4th quarter. Time to pass...
Call detroit and get kenny golladay
"This D made Burrow look like the rookie that he is lol 

We’re business"
Is that 8 sacks on the day? Bengals should take 3 OL next year.
>The @Ravens have held opponents scoreless in the third quarter this season -- the only NFL team to do so. - @PMGleason
Wink's defensive play calling creates nightmares for rookie QBs.
Last years offense with this defense we would have scored 100
What?
Jesus christ Lamar what are you doing
"Okay, Jackson’s gotta chill out a little"
Anyone gonna blame someone for not running the right route on yet another near-int?
Oh man.  I have a feeling he’s having trouble seeing schemed LBs in there
"Need to practice extra hard this week, blowing out a division rival and still feeling like were struggling"
Wow...
What’s the point of the mask if you just take it off to talk
can’t keep emphasizing that division games are typically very close
Lamar not reading the field like he used to today.
I love how Orlando looks huge even standing next to other linemen
"Good route by boyd, but man I hate him."
Peters wants another TO
Roman needs to get his head out of his ass. He’s been the reason this offense is so lackluster the past 4 weeks
"Offense has some time to adjust, in the meantime I’ll take 14/20 point wins while we’re working on it lol"
YAS QUEEN
We need to sign Mr. Big Chest. He's had months of therapy now - he should be alright.
QUEEN IS THE MAN OF THE MATCH!
PQ boiiii!!!!!!
KILLA QUEEN X2
Defense is carrying this team
What a play by Marlon holy shit
Just I was about to say “damn they’re getting some momentum with all these completions”
Defensive player of the year in the running
Hump and Queen AGAIN!!!!
F R U I T P U N C H
I feel like we can add two more wins to our record because the Browns and Bengals ain’t doing shit on our defense
FRUIT PUNCH
Defense has done it all today
I would not be surprised to hear that lamar is still sick
This is exciting by Defence.
"hay is in the barn, fellas"
Come on Philly!!!
Is Harbs wearing two masks? Lol
Use #NFLRedzone and say queen is the rookie of the day. Don’t let claypool win it!
Couple times...
AFCN May only look so good cause it has played a light schedule
It isn’t a ravens game if the defense doesn’t score
No offense but that’s the first good throw by Burrow all game
Campbelllllllll
"Free release, good throw... still want this shutout though"
Defense is gonna have to make something happen to keep the shutout alive
Fake crowd noise guy has been better this week
"Roman's past his prime. He was good for his first moment in B-more, but now other teams know how to stop him. This wouldn't be much of an issue if he didn't malfunction every game and forget the Ravens are a run-first offense. Also, it seems like he can't adjust to teams that don't let the Ravens steamroll them..."
Boooooooo
BARNACLES
"Look, any game we aren't tied and going into overtime for, is a good game. We gave them a pity fg."
Why do i feel like the chiefs can still come back
"I admit I'll be shocked if the Raiders don't fuck themselves somehow, lol."
Y’all think we’re the worst 4-1 team going into next week?
Anyone else notice how Lamar never ever changes the play nor the protection. That's a big problem why dont we let him? Is he not able or what
I swear if they comeback I'm gonna break my TV
"3 and 3, lets NOT give it to edwards... fuuuuck I hate greg roman..."
Have the real Ravens been kidnapped or something today?
Greg Roman scares me
Is 2 OC’s a thing? G-Ro is a great run caller but his passing plays are straight out of Madden
Pass rush still looks non-existent
"We need Ray and Suggs to come in and teach the defense how to get pressure and execute tackles. I feel like our defense isn't scary, our secondary is good but we don't play tight coverage often based off the open man every 2 plays"
Lamar looks like ass right now and I'm sad
Judon is fucking garbage. I wasnt happy when he was tagged and I'm still not. Dude is not a fucking franchise player
"Dang, all these comments mad at Judon... I thought he had a personal foul or something... it was obvious he was offsides... I don't know Burrow would've thrown that INT otherwise."
Lamar what you doing bby
"lamar looking a little off


edit: i’m blind it was tipped"
I disagree with the announcers. I like the call to go for it.
"I’m... confused 

Fire Roman"
"Sigh, how long before Greg Roman's amnesia towards running the football leaves him and he stops calling like, 20,000 pass plays?"
"3 runs in a row? 3 positive yard plays? I think we did it guys, we fired greg Roman"
kyler jackson with a 2 yard rushing td
Hollywood gotta catch that
Our offense is garbage but I’m starting to feel bad for what we’re doing to theirs 😂😂
We lead but our offense stinks right now but we’re so good I’m happy anyways
I’m laughing just a little at the whole “welcome to the AFC north” for Joe Burrow when he’s already played the Browns
Lamar does not seem to want to run the ball anymore.
"Lamar does not look healthy, he doesn't look comfortable"
Defense gonna save our ass this year
"Take a deep breath, guys. We're up 3 scores in the second half and our defense is dominating them. Maybe this play calling is an attempt to get our passing some reps against a live defense in a low risk situation."
"He didn’t even go through his progressions on that play, could of easily picked up 3 with his legs..something is wrong for sure"
Flacco is actually playing well right now
The Bengals have been embarrassed 3 straight times by Lamar if anyone has film on him it’ should be Cincinnati
Obligatory YAS QUEEN
"If Lamar belongs in the same tier as the great QBs, then why do fans get so mad with all of the pass calls?"
Campbell is a man beast
"Darn, was hoping for a shutout."
SIGN ANTONIO BROWN
Wtf Lamar???????? Ruined a great drive by the running attack.
[deleted]
Marcus peters has been trash this year
Wtf was that lamar? Horrible
Why can’t Lamar read defenses anymore. Early last year he was really good at it
So what is everyone gonna complain about today after we win 34-3?
Might have to turn the game off. Greg Roman is soooooo bad
I'm **SO TIRED** of seeing Lamar throw
Is it just me or has lamar regressed this year lol
I find that little Joker gesture that Elliott does pretty cringey. I know its his nickname but I hope he stops doing it soon lol
Unfortunately we’re going back to what we were known for for years and years our defense. Atleast we can say that. Offense looking like it’s ran by Flacco
"People will shit on Roman and rightly so, but the reality ia Lamar is awful at throwing hot and he needs to be much better at that to stop defenses from sending 7 guys after him like the Bills and Titans did last year."
Damn Burrow gonna be legit just off his decision making
"Guess it’s time to abandon the run, good call Roman"
Joe “Lamar Jackson” Burrow
Really fucking good throw
Fucking trashdon
They might bench Burrow at this point lol
"I have a theory why we are throwing...

Roman has been instructed by DeCosta to have Lamar throw deep and into coverage in order to drop his overall value. The more incompleteness and ineffective he is, the less money he will command in the off-season in a couple years for his extension.



Or Roman is just a fucking idiot"
Lamar has regressed this year for sure.
"Cool play I'd love to see... Wildcat to Ingram, Lamar on the right, Hollywood on the left. Ingram takes snap and takes entire line and team right, pitch to Lamar and Hollywood is taking off 1 on 1 down the left sideline.

You know Hollywood would be burning whoever he's against."
"Wow look what happens when JK gets the ball, who would have thought?"
Dobbins needs more touches
That's an ugly ball tho
Our offense is pretty bad
"This has not been a well called game on offense, I like to see a bit more balance between the run and pass. Seems like we pick one or the other for a drive and focus on it"
Sacks and Flacco check downs. Give the Bengals D credit for disrupting this offensive
What a terrible kicker
Why tf aren't we playin Dobbins more?
"Anyone else think that knee injury might be affecting Lamar more than we let on? He hasn't had a run yet has he?

Edit: a word"
[deleted]
I can't watch the game.  Can one of you tell me which link in the O Line appears weakest?  Where are all the rushers getting through?
I need a word with Roman and our Wr coach: WTF are you guys doing!!!
Surprised to see Marquise do anything after the catch lol
Damn Gus killed him
Roman might need to go after this season WTF
Please. Let's run the ball. Run out the clockk.  Get rg3 in there. Let lamar rest
25th in total offense: “Greg Roman deserves a ton of credit”
Trash absolute garbage
That was bad on Boykin but why would Lamar even throw that on 3rd down? Dude was locked up man to man.
I feel like Jackson relies on the defence falling apart at the idea of him running. When they don’t he makes bad judgment calls
Judon is such a piece of shit
So Boykin overthrow maybe it was the angle but it looked to me Boykin stopped on the route and Lamar had thrown a much deeper route
I'm legit starting to think that Roman's Marty 2.0. Why does this happen with every OC on the Ravens? There has to be something deeper happening...
[Today in a nutshell](https://imgflip.com/i/4i5790)
"We had one of the most explosive offenses last year. Today has been far from perfect, but don’t hang your heads. That team didn’t just disappear, we will start to click again. I have faith in that. 

The real takeaway should be how well our defense is playing. Yes it’s the Bengals, but it’s always good to see your Defense playing dominant like they are supposed to be."
Maybe Romanvis calling pass plays to show Lamar hes not ready to be a pure pocket passer yet
That’s mah queen
Lamar is kill. Murray is new favorite player.

Who is currently putting up a worse performance: Lamar or the announcers?
"Can greg roman please stop changing the offensive identity like he has amnesia. Yes. You can pass, but if the run is working, then use it."
What is wrong with him
Lamar looking like a rookie
"Feels like Flacco is starting for us today, not the Jets...."
"I don't think Lamar has control of the offense, he needs to step up this year and take over. Mahomes and Allen have full control it seems while Lamar seems like he's just taking instructions this year"
Poll: is miles Boykin good? Leave your answer below!
yall need to relax
"God damn Lamar, stop playing like a fucking rookie. FIX YOUR DECISION MAKING."
"Please keep telling me how this isnt on Lamar.

Playing like fucking Baker Mayfield."
our offense is dog shit this year
Could this be the trace mcsorely game
Anyone have any idea if fans will be allowed back in this year?
Time to make my coffee. BIG TRUSSSSSSS LETS GOOOOOOO
Any thoughts on how the weather impacts this game?
Mekari is warming up at RG according to Jeff
Anyone not playing today?
"Bengals game plan: screen, screen, deep incompletion to Green, punt"
I actually miss Dan dierdorf he was a great color commentator
For your thread streaming comfort https://www.reddit-stream.com/r/ravens/comments/j98hes/10112020_week_5_game_thread_cincinnati_bengals_at/
LFG!!!
I’m really glad I don’t have to sit through Big Bang Theory ads during games anymore. Little victories.
Woooooo LFG!!! 😈
Lego
Big day for the D comin right up.
Lets fucking go!!!!
(●'◡'●)
Move the kickoff 10 yards forward and award a point for putting it through the uprights.
"Jesus Christ, it’s game day"
"Our pash rush actually got close to burrow, that’s how you know the Bengals have a bad o-line"
DEFENSE. PLS
LFG RAVENS 💜🖤💜🖤😈😈😈
we didn't have a Sample on him
Na jimmy Smith not judon
"Man, if you are going to let bounce get away from it!!"
Classic bengals
Thank god we’re playing Bobby Hart this week so judon can pump up those sack numbers
Jimmy Smith leading the NFL in sacks so far today 👀
Can we call them Bagels?
GO LLAMA
Bengals will be straight-up out coached today.
Let’s fucking gooo bitches
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUU!!!!!!
Holy shit
DUVERNAY
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU
Good call G-Ro!
Keep giving him playing time sirs
I love Duvernay's speed!!
Holy shit Duvernay got wheels
I got a fever and the only prescription is more Duvernay
Let’s go Duuuuuuuuuv
DUUUUUUUUUUUUV
DUV
FEED DUVERNAY IN SPACE
DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUVVVVVVVVV
Nice play
Duv needs to be our #2 target. He’s so good.
Damn
Tuck it in
Duvernay has had so few touches but made so many big plays
Wish we ran the ball at least twice after that big run but o well get points when you can
Anyone know if Lamar has knee pain?
What else is new Ravens don’t score a TD and win by FG
Duvernay is earning some more PT
"🐐

Tucker"
Why....why do we always do stupid play calls near the red zone
Why are they forcing the ball down the field so early in the game?
Duverney is pretty clearly our best weapon but Greg Roman will utilize him for 3 plays all game
2 forced passes there.
Two perfectly good throws by LJ and both Brown and Andrews too afraid to go for the ball
Sometimes it feels like Lamar is trying to force it to MAndrews and teams are double covering him now.
"Why are we so insistent on making Lamar pass when we have so much invested in the run?  We are designed to grind teams down with 8+ min drives, so DO IT!"
Cutouts lowkey creepy ngl
Mad boogies  first tackle
The guy was standing there eating lunch. Defense took a nap...
WTF with these Wide open Receivers.....
He had all day in the pocket
Didn’t know bengals have butter bean on their roster
Looked like Peters was the one that left Higgins just standing there. I just don't get it.
How
Please dont get AJ Green involved. That’s never a good thing for us
"Get this stop. Set the tone, boys!"
Ineed alink to watch the game can never watch where iam
Oh no they dont...
"Wow, good stop."
Good job D
He probably couldve run that for a first tbh
This week and last week these threads have been just the regulars where are all the bandwagoners. Been a quiet couple game threads
I say we keep throwing. We should experiment against the not so good teams
Yea i thought Judon looked banged up on that last series
"Zach Taylor kinda lost out there.  

Burrow would be a stud on any team."
Ingram still making grown ass men bounce off him
Didn't fool anyone
"Hell, I saw that coming."
"D was great there. Announcer said it was overthrown but watching the replay, that was the only spot Burrow could have placed the ball the give his guy a shot. Coverage was phenomenal there."
Wtf was that
What a stupid ass call Roman
O line looks a lot better
So teams are amazing at screens against us. But we can’t run a screen to save our lives 🤦🏻‍♂️
That was an incredibly poorly-designed play.
"Dn if he didn't hesitate, he had 10 more"
Move the chains!
"We must’ve broadcasted that. Damn, Cincy was all over that."
Whyd he stop man.
What was that throw
DUV
DUUUUV
Duvernay out here making plays!
I like seeing Dev more involved
what the hell was that
BEEP BEEP
All aboard the Gus bus!
Bus!
That was a sweet side arm pass to Duv
Lmao the reason he ran a lot in college from the pocket was that his line was garbage
Ran into a wall though!
Looks like Cincy is loading up the middle of the line.
Truss the bus
These snaps are wild. Lamar back there never knowing where the snap is going to fly
Holy shit lol
Whoa!!!!
#WINDMILL ANDREWS
Damnnn lol
Damn Andrews!! Did a full 360 there!
dat flip goddamn Mandrews
Oh my butthole puckered phew!
Mandrews with a MANLY flip
FLIP
Who knew andrews was a gymnast
Dude was on a trampoline holy shit
omg what a flip
Man Lamar is way off
Sighhhhh
oh no not boger
Why they gotta show that graphic right now. Trying to jinx Llama
Ok I like that...
James proche getting more reps!
Mandrews saves the day
Mark Andrews has really redeemed himself these past 2 weeks since the Chiefs game
Didn’t think that was a 1st...
"Dude, Lamar looks HELLA off right now. That lob was a nice idea but it was nowhere close."
someone needs to clip all the times he's called him murray
I'll never understand how you can break huddle with no time left and have no idea.
Damn what a throw
MANDREWS!
"GET IT, MANDREWS"
Murray to Andrews!!!
Let’s go!
Would like to know what Lamar was saying there
Thank you andrews you're our blanket
Why does Gumble keep calling Lamar “Murray” ?
Murray is off this year
Holy fuck what a fake out by Lamar
The Bengals defensive ends keep getting to the backfield and just stand there lmao. They had an easy sack
They can’t stop Andrews
Andrews got penetrated by the D on that TD
AND 1!
MANDREWS
There is no way the color commentator doesn’t tell him to stop calling him murray when they go to commercial. It should stop soon.
I like patience lamar
I don't know who this Lamar Murray guy is or why Jackson isn't playing but he's fucking legit.
After watching the red river shootout yesterday with the energy of Gus and Klatt. This is like watch a game in a morgue
I never knew Lamar did that lol
Why does this mans keep saying Murray everytime he drops back? I though I was going crazy the first few times
lol that was a nice dig at how cheap Mike Brown is
Keep up the pressure D!
There was that Marlon cornerblitz again...
MP
Damn MP GOT HOPS
Burrow having a poor game so far
yeah Lamar isn't humble at all. come on.
Peters!  Pressure got to the rookie.
#JUICEMAN EZ PICKINS
Lol
Let’s go! What a defensive play all around
HE GOT THAT JU ICE IN HIM
MP JUICEMAN
NOW CLEAN YOUR BUTT OFF OUR PETERS
Boom. I predicted a Peters pick before the game and there it is
MP JUICEMAAAAAAAAAN
Murray yet again!!
THAT'S HOW YOU DO ITTTTT
Yea that’s intentional grounding.
"Got some juice, man?"
Noooo!!!!!!!
And the turnover streak continues
🧃 🧃 🧃
There’s no way that’s grounding.
WTF was that play
**MURRAY PETERS**
When Burrows gave that ball back because it was good luck -> 😢 what an amazing person /s
lmao what an awful throw
CBS app delay spoilers again... Not mad though.
afc north takeaway division
MP JUICEMAN!!!
"Inject that into my veins, MP Juice man"
Bengals gonna Bengal.
"Good job Dunlap, you ass."
I'll take the yards but not the play call
The fact that the announcer isn’t correcting him just crazy
Bengals receiver gave up on the play on that interception. But nice play.
Holy shit he got his name right
MURRAY TO MANDREWS!!!
"anyone know the most consecutive scoring quarters to start a season? if they're gonna tell me we've scored in 17 (soon to be 18) straight quarters, I wanna know the record"
The pessimist in me wants Lamar to stop going to Mandrews so much
Green was literally blocking for Peters 🤣
Im confused..  why wouldn’t Baltimore take a timeout after that last play and kick a fg
Is it just me or is Lamar not hitting the holes that he used to ?
Bryant Gumball’s announcer voice makes it so much more irritating
There ya go
Onto the Eagles
Brown definitely at least a little thicker
I love Kyler
RG3 coming out after 1st drive of 3rd quarter is my bold prediction
Think our D can pitch a first half shut out?
"If you send the house like that, you got to get to the QB."
"Greg Roman: just kidding, let’s abandon the run"
Our zone D 🙄
Budget Mike Thomas lol
"There's a game starting an hour from now that I really wanna watch and I was hoping the Ravens would have the game won by then, it's looking good so far"
"OMFG

THEY SAID IT AGAIN"
Come on D. Hate leaving dudes wide open.
"Is the Baltimore courthouse ready for the influx of Ravens players legally changing their name to ""Murray"" tomorrow?"
Surprised the bengals aren’t going crazy with the screens
Good play Bowser!
27th ranked pass D 😬
Lol judon
judon is having a tough year man
Murray playing for both teams now?
Elliot has played much better than I expected.
They can’t sack him smh
"Great pressure there, no sack but still lost yards"
Great rush by Judon just gotta finish
Excellent defense of that end-around.
How does Judon miss so many sacks
Murray looks like he's playing at 75% but its still great
Poo
God I fucking hate Tyler Boyd
Judon LOVES these games against lesser teams
Love the punch on 44
"still a good play, but judon's got to finish that"
Anyone seeing how Joe is doing?
Did Queen slow down a sec when he thought Judon had Burrow wrapped up?
bruuuuuh
Queen lost again. Damn
Eagles defense is comically bad
lol mixon = ass.
Sack daddy
Peter's going off today.
ASAP Ferg with the big stop
Flag..
Fuck you Judon.
Fuck you Judon
Vintage Judon
"Fucking hell, thanks Judon"
Who are those lucky ducks
Fucking dumbass Judon
Judon at his best....
"I feel like once Mixon gets up to full speed he's really quick, but he really takes a minute to get there when hes running, at least whenever I'm watching. He just doesnt really have that burst"
It's coming back its gonna be roughing the passer
Judon better get a solo strip sack or something
Lmao Elliot dancing after the false start
FuckingnJudon you shithead
I fucking hate judon. Like seriously man. Guy is fucking garbage.
Judon again lol
Should be offsetting there was an unrelated false start as well.
QUEEN
Boom baby!!! What a hit by Queen!!
WHAT A HIT GOTDAMN
Ouch Judon...
Queen lit his ass up lmao
Lmao anyone see Campbell's big ass repeatedly jumping in the air?
FUMBLE
I truly dislike Judon
Chuck deserves that man fuck
LOL
Queeeeeen
YAAAAAAAS QUEEN
QUEEN WITH THE SACK AND FUMBLE RECOVERY
QUEEN JUST CROWNED BURROW!
Burrow is off on his deep throws this year
BOOM BITCH
SIT THE FUCK DOWN
Stung by the bee!
Feasting on the rookie qb!
"Yeah, I think it's safe to say our D is all up in Burrow's hat right now."
#YAS QUEEN
E tu Brute?
We’re relentless my boy
"Caribbean Queen! 

Now were sharing the same dream!"
Wow
"Damn, he killed him"
"
👏 seC 👏 quArteRbaCKS 👏"
Lot of flags today
Scott Hansen on RedZone saying Queen and Burrow weren't friendly at LSU. First I've heard of that...
Lmao we are playing so well I actually feel bad for the Bengals
The Judon special back at it
Anyone else watching the elite dragon at the same time?
smh
Go for it
Bruh don’t go for this
Ooof.
Dude
Wasted.
Fuck
Bad decision coach
No respect for Burrow by going for it there lol. Awful execution tho
Lamar too excited.  Another skyball.
Well that didn’t work😆
IDK what that was
Why? Fucking why my dude
"Garbage, inconsequential play calling."
Should have punted there we are up 17.
Wish we gave Tucker a shot at a huge FG tbh
Dumb 4th down call.
Great play by defense just to get a false start and throw 4 times in a row for no reason.
What the hell was that about? No reason to go for it there
I swear some of you see the buzzword of playcalling and then scream it the whole time.
Yeah THAT'S coming back
Then again Lamar did miss 2 days of practice were stomping the bengals I don’t see them scoring more than 2 TDS but we gotta clean this shit up. Next week philly will be a better team and their confidence will sky rocket if they upset the Steelers
That was the right playcall by cincy... just their o-line sucks so much and messed it up! Haha
Roman has to run the ball more
"We need like 10,000 fans back"
"lol, the entire Ravens sideline saw that"
Is that the 1st holding call for the year?
Well that helps with the old field position
17-0...ARREST GREG ROMAN
Burrow bout to need an XL ice bath after this game
Bengals might want to take Burrow out before he gets killed
This is why we went for it lol we smell blood in the water on D
"Shit, might as well pour maple syrup on Burrow, because he is getting pancaked. Yikes"
I'm so glad Bobby Hart plays for them
Did j tucker not kick a field goal? Can't watch the game.
Steelers getting help from the refs again 🙄
Who tf is JBalvin
Wait... the run works?
Wow back to back runs!
Yeah we’re monsters
Are they rotating Mekari and Powers or was Mekari hurt for the last 2 drives?
Jesus Lamar just threw that away the same way Burrow is.
Woahhh. Easy killer
So are we getting a Lamar run like last year against the Bengals?
GUS BUS
The truest 50/50 ball ever
Andrews owes it to Lamar lol
"Not huge on Lamar's decisions today, get it out of your system now it's just the Bengals"
Opportunity to put this game to bed with a TD here and again coming out of the half. Leggo
Our defense is looking phenomenal this game. Burrow has actually been playing decently this year until now.
"""If you want the hot delicious taste if pizza hut delivered THIS BAD"" dude, I promise you, *nobody* wants pizza hut ""THIS BAD"""
"Lol, case in point. Look at that run"
I was wondering where Dobbins was
Damn that ball was there
Holy fuck Dobbins.
DOBBINS!!!
finally dobbins gets a touch
God damn miles Boykin literally blocked his man off the field on that Jk run lmao
"Dobbins, another player who always produces but rarely gets a chance..."
"Damn, stayed in bounds forever, then got out of bounds"
"Bengals are fighting for their lives, something's gonna give."
Why the fuck was that
"JFC, Lamar"
Speaking of giving.....sighs
I don't know what DPI even looks like anymore.
welp
Awful throws
what the fuck
What the fuck?
Ugly throw
Lamar has gotta be hurt wtf is he doing
what is lamar doing...
Is it just me or has Lamar seemed unhappy this season?
How the heck do we start off SO HOT and then revert to this...?
That wasn’t gonna make it to Snead no matter what
"Lamar looks awful today, but him not absolutely dominating teams will hopefully be good in the long run."
Jesus christ what the fuck is that? Lamar is just not playing well right now.
It looked like that ball just slipped out of his hands
"Garbage, inconsequential playcalling."
That was a terrible ball any way you look at it.
WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK WERE YOU THROWING THAT BALL FOR?
That one highly confuses me. Imma just give him the benefit of the doubt here. Let's get the ball back
How many times are we going to allow a free rusher off the right side?? Jesus Christ
The Bengals have to be awful for us to be winning like this with Lamar playing this poorly.
Tf?
What was that throw tbh lol
"Can’t be mad at that, it was just a good defensive play"
Look at orlando bruh
"Lamar is getting frustrated he should keep his cool in these situations. 

I'd prefer a game like this then a full blown out then fail at the playoffs"
Let’s try this again shall we ladies and gents
"Lol its glaringly obvious Lamar needs to run the ball more himself, run with RPO, and throw very minimally in order to be successful 
 Idk wtf Roman is doing throwing out of the shotgun with him all game long"
both teams doing a good job putting pressure on the QB
We got the ball back already 😂😂 lets go score
Is Gilchrist the new Corey Graham??
Nice pick up for Hollywood
"Defense is playing hard-nosed Ravens d, even with the offense playing meh"
"well 1 minute left, the Ravens do score a lot of TDs in the last 2 minutes of the first half.

gotta look for some positives here"
"Kneel it, go cool off, come back out after the half

Nvm, didn’t see Cincy’s TOs"
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS PLAYCALLING
Take a shot deep
In what fucking world does stanley start that sack by shuffling inside instead of outside... what the actual fuck
Get a field goal maybe?
This is Tucker range right?
Pleaseee let tucker kick a long field goal
Anyone have a good stream?
61 for tuck
No bueno
Noooooooooooooo :(
Medstar sucks
"Trade tucker scrub!

:)"
This game should be over already
**HOW DARE U RUIN FLEETWOOD MAC LIKE THIS**
They really fucked up but not just running it to give Tucker a shot at the record there with it right in the middle of the field. Would love to see Tucker have the record for longest field goal made.
I can't believe we had 29 passing attempts in the first half of a game where we aren't playing catch up.
Ard 99yd pass TD to Hollywood PAD THOSE STATS
"Also, if teams are blitzing all the time to try and stop Lamar, give him some short throws that he can complete quickly!"
"Weird game, our D has been great, though."
Rain time.
What do the Bengals need to work on on offense? Uh.... everything?
The Eagles are literally garbage why can't we get any help..
"Teams have had a year of film and a whole offense to look at this offense.  They have to add new wrinkles.  It can be tough to find a balance between imposing your will with your bread and butter, and adjusting to taking what the defense is giving you."
Maohmes-esque
This offense is offensive
This is frustrating
Lamar's risky passing is like my childhood crush. Toying with my heart 😂
I think the problem is our receivers suck at getting open.  And he tries to keep the play alive as long as possible.
We are still just missing that big #1 WR we can try and force passes to once in a while.
Did we switch announcers or am I crazy?
Ok I'm sorry I like Watson but that commercial was fuckin dreadful.
"I see you Ferg, good game so far"
"Anyone have a link on where to watch this game? South texas here, no where available!!!! Even at a bar."
that speed
THANK YOU DEFENSE
Gilchrist playing deep safety lol
"""You're a queen!"" What?"
"I feel like at the very last moment Burrow sensed a defender coming. If not, that was a fumble."
"Yikes. Bengals look awful in pass pro. That rep was on mixon. However, a vet qb tells him where the blitz is coming from there."
How many times has our offence had the ball this game?
I hope all the extra passing attempts this season have just been Jackson trying to make up for no preseason games.
10-6
So many tipped passes
RUN THE FUCKING BALL
Murray again
MURRAY
Murray up the middle!
"HE FINALLY RECOGNIZED IT!! ""Why do I keep calling him Murray?"""
Its raining and we are still throwing?
Why do I keep saying Murray?
I’d like to know our run/pass % on 1st down today. Gotta be like 70% pass at least.
Anyone got a link to the game?
I am appalled with this offense.
"More Dobbins, more Duvernay"
This ref is high as shit
Hollywood!!
There we go
"good call lamar, if his knee's hurt i'm glad he didn't run it like he wanted to"
And Lamar is def not 100%
Hollywood!
"Beautiful play, defenders bit on the scramble"
Nice play Hollywood
Can't figure out why Hollywood's release after catch is slow. He's so quick but he catches the ball turns up field looks around then runs
"Everytime he calls lamar ""murray"", lamar makes a big play.

lol"
Get out of the way Ref!!
Well... that was something
Another free rusher...
Lamar’s leg looked fine there
That play is broken a second time. He turned to fake to Ingram but Ingram was no where near him.
"WTF is the REF DOING? Also, ANOTHER PASS PLAY. ROMAN!!! WTFF!!!! xD"
That poor ref
Official thought he was not in the play.  He thought wrong.
Keep passing the ball up 17
uh can we block?
Embarrassing
We havent scored since the 1st quarter right? Thats ridiculous
They call a running play that gets 3 yards and greg roman thinks its the end of the world.
Lamar needs to scramble more. So many times he has open lanes but ends up throwing an incompletion.
The bengals have kept tabs on that rollout all game. Bad playcall on 2nd and long.
Why.....why is offense so stalled lately....
Come man. Run out of that pocket. We needed 6yds.
Lmao
"Damn, couldn't fall on that one"
Fuck.  FUCK
"dammit we could've had that, just dive on the damn ball"
strip sack!!! omg get the football!
What was that? Hot potato?
Why wasnt Dez signed?
LMAO
Burrow fumbles more than Lamar did his rookie year good lord
Who the fuck put the ball in butter
Just fucking fall on it.
A run!
Yea BIG BOI
"Nice run! He's gonna call a pass after this, watch..."
Run good. More run.
BIG BOI
Big truss
They ran on 2nd and 7!!!! G Ro thank god
"wow, we ran it and it worked. 

Now keep doing it pls."
Finally something from ingram
I think it’s safe to say Yandas spot is still up for grabs
"Lamar has +3 yards?

I must have missed it."
These dudes trying to get a strip ball. They ain’t Marlo
Imagine that. Running the football.
"Skilled boy, no washed-up boy"
"Hmm, maybe we should run the ball more"
See what happens when you run the goddamn ball Greg?
"Marty was the OC in 2018, not Roman 🙄"
"Open up the bag now. An end-around, a play action, a screen."
Anybody got the stats on Edwards YPC?
What
"More playing time for duvernay, less for boykin"
This fake crowd noise is TRASH
[deleted]
 Washington is gonna kill Alex Smith bro
Who is this Gilchrist cat
Burrow getting killed
"Ferguson is looking nice, he fast."
Judon again...
FUCKING JUDON
How has madbukaki looked today?
Pain.
"I just want y'all to know that the German translation for ""poor sod"" is ""armer Sack"" and I think this perfectly fits for Joe Burrow today."
Chucky
"Dan Dierdorf >>> Rich Gannon as a commentator.

This sucks because we're going to have to hear this dude commentate on games for the next decade at least."
SACK SQUAD
Poor burrow
RIP burrow
What a defensive effort.
FUCK YEAH SACKED AGAIN GET HIT BOI
Defense definitely destroying today
What’s the max sacks in a game?  Just curious.
That’s not ray rice
"We should try to make a move for curtis samuel, he is so underated because carolina doesnt use him. I think he coukd be a number 1, super diggs like."
Remember this game when you think it's a good idea to trade an elite LT.
I really like to see our d line just playing mean
"Okay, granted: Bengals O sucks, but maybe this is the game that really gets our D going, ya know?"
Just get one more td so we can ice this fucking game
Big run mark
What....
WTF
5 different DB have a sack today.  Unreal.
Luckiest drop ever.
Brown and Andrew’s are doing their thing but someone’s going to have to step up every now and then
Run the damn ball
RUN THE DAMN BALL
I just hope both teams run on every play now. End this damn garbage.
Bruuuuuuuh
Love how hump always comes in with a punch
Marlon straight assaults arms out there
Whew. Nice route
Yeah because the collisions are as bad if not worse than car crashes
Anyone else really annoyed by the crowd moaning?
When he's not being driven into the ground Burrow is moving the football.
"What was this sub saying about
Lamar last year week 5 against the Steelers"
What the fuck is wrong with them LMAO
Wow.
HAHAHAHAHA
WEW
That's fun
There u go
what a weird game today.
NO 1ST WORK FOR IT
How is that not a penalty?
Nice
Nope.
The worst part is 6:23 instead of 5:55 on the game clock. 😂
"That's not gonna save me, Rich... No - it certainly isn't"
CC just tackled both of em lol
Suck it Ebron
I hope he fucking shanks this one. Just to have the shutout
Can we run up the score now that we don't get the shutout?
Why did we need RGIII to take a knee?
Who even wins the nfc east
"I mean, I'll gladly take a touchdown but that drive hardly inspired confidence"
"OMG it's nothing wrong with the call to go for it or the play call. LJ mised the throw.

And shut up about running the ball. They're not as good at running the ball as they were last year.

They're up by 17. Good grief."
Score should be much higher. To everyone saying we’re complaining roo much ; stfu this performance will not be sustainable against good teams.
"Ravens up 20-0 and everyone in this sub is having a melt down like we are the Jets... Pull it together, guys."
Mahomes went straight to the locker room like a little baby. Classless and shows what a little b*tch he really is. Classless in wins...even more in losses.
"Come on yall we scored a TD on opening drive almost every game last year, it’s unrealistic to expect it every single game we will be fine"
Are we still listening to analytics? Becuase i think analytics would've said don't go for it there
If we move on from Greg Roman we’re not gonna have a coach that can adapt the current running game to whatever system they try and Lamar would suffer because of it
3 straight passes lol
26 pass attempts is inexcusable
I wanna see Koch under center for the rest of this game lol
Something is off with Lamar.
Good thing we're playing this shitshow of a QB because this is easily our second worst game this year.
Ingram has 2 good runs and suddenly everyone thinks he’s great again lmao
Flacco TD though wooo!
Like I said before and got down voted for. The offense is garbage. Lamar refuses to scramble. Roman refuses to run on first and second down. The only reason we're winning is because the Bengals oline is as bad as ours.
I dont have a good feeling about next week
Streaming link? Anyone? Please?
He can't do that all game. Keep up the pressure 😈
I really think Hollywood is hiding an injury
"I'd this dumb asshole calls Jackson ""Murray"" again..."
Judon is pathetic.
"Stupid.  If anything, should have run it"
Smh Lamar.
What the fuck is wrong with Lamar? He is awful today throwing.
"Sigh, maybe one day the Ravens will remember that their running game is better and more crucial to their offense than their passing game..."
Nt
Lamar looking decent this drive. He just having a off day.
"Nice to see us running only 13 times in a half, maybe if we ran more it would open up some more plays through the air instead of Lamar having to look for someone to get open and forcing something"
"I want to see more of the Ravens running up-tempo going forward. Frustrating as that pick was, I thought the offense looked better running it. It keeps the defense on their heels, forces their rushers to either commit to coming downhill to rush or hanging back to contain instead of being able to take it one play at a time, wears down the DBs to let Hollywood and Duvernay put that 4.3 speed to its best use, makes the backfield motion even more confusing, and wears down the whole defense so once Lamar takes off, they've got even less of a chance of catching him.

Don't become like Chip kelly's eagles and run nothing but up-tempo, slow it down as the game dictates, but I liked how the offense looked running at a faster pace. (Plus then it won't be as uncomfortable on the rare occasions we have to play from behind because we already know how to run hurry up)"
Wtf was that? ROMAN!
We should get someone besides RG3.
"Honestly Brown needs to man the fuck up. Steve Smith wasn't big, but he laid people the fuck out on these plays."
"I really want to see Roman gone after this season. Terrible passing routes, terrible play calls. He just doesn't have it. He makes winning look hard"
"Somethings off with Burrow this year.

Jfc... /s"
I HAVE ZERO RESPECT FOR GREG ROMAN.
"3rd and 3, lets throw the ball"
"Bengals have a terrible run d, even when they have dj reader, and he's not on the field. Just run it down their throats and finish this game"
Time for Joe Boller.
Reddit is full of people with negativity bias
First shutout of the season is close.
I agree with Lamar being not 100%.
Eagles are blowing it as usual
"I kinda want us to throw it, don't kill me"
Dick sucking for getting sacked. Give me a break
That pass was awful. Haven’t seen one that bad from Lamar since his rookie year.
Lamar has been ass the past 3wks. But he is actually making bad decisions this game. Clean it up bra.
"Damn, did I wander into the Cincy sub by accident? All this negativity early toward our own guys when we’re moving the ball. Chill, kids."
Don’t agree with going for it
That was fucking stupid
"I love the Ravens and Lamar, but I believe he lost something after this latest Chiefs loss"
Lamar “Vince Young” Jackson is back
All you people saying the halftime analysts haven’t been watching the game ... have you ever thought maybe just maybe the Ravens aren’t playing nearly as badly as you think they are?????
Looks like the Bengals made their halftime adjustments.
Lol both QBs playing bad... atleast we winning right fellas hehe :/
I fucking want the bengals to score to test our offense rig now
People need to be more positive. Lots of good stuff in this game to be happy about. Lamar throwing a lot might be in response to the Bengals scheme and not Roman being a moron. Keep your head's up Ravens bros and gals!
Tucker’s not looking so hot today.
Antonio Brown
Only in r/ravens could you find fans crying about being up 17-0
"Trade for Allen Robinson, Julio, hell at this point AB not looking to bad...F\*\*\*"
Not going for it?
Convincing?
"Lamar is having a Sophomore slump. 

Bozeman is having a day."
Think it’s going to be closer than we all think burrow is legit
Marquise Brown = Mark Clayton
"r u n 

t h e 

b a l l"
Stop giving Ingram the ball
RGIII time?
We spent a third round pick on Miles Boykin \*Sigh\*
Judon is my least favorite player on this team
"Offense shouldn’t have had a free play, by rule. They should’ve blown it dead. That’s just refball, and not on any player in particular as they would’ve called something else"
Horrible call
"Wtf Roman? Punt the fucking ball. Lamar had a few shocking throws that drive but still, do not like that playcalling one bit."
"Looked like Andrews didn't get the right release there, wish they had a replay (or Sunday Ticket let me rewind)"

Ray Rice!!!
Idk if lamar can read pass defense well
"Lamar's worst game since the Chargers first half in the Wildcard. 

What is going on?"
Not enough time to get tucker close
Please run the football consistently in the second half. I'm on my knees begging you Roman :(
YEAH SACK HIS ASS
"My prediction: there will be changes in the bye week to address the lackluster run game. Until then, we will see Lamar passing 30+ times a game."
Lamar throwing the ball while we’re up by 17 bruh cmon
Wtf is Lamar doing?
That’s it Roman. Literally never pass it again. In fact let’s not put a QB in just a backfield of running backs.
Thank God we ran him for 2 yards or else you guys would be up in flames.
All ofnourboutside runs require cut backs to get any yardage. We need to move to a more conventional offense.
QUEEENNNNNNN
QUEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEN
Geez at least mark the Ravens side of the game balls...
"Pathetic, just absolutely pathetic. With this kind of defensive domination and our run game once again flourishing when given the chance, we should be leading this 50-0. 17-0 is just pathetic at this point."
Brown is a huge softie
Screw it we’re up by 20 MCSORLEY TIME
Lamar hasn't looked good since week 1.
"Lamar isn’t playing good so put in McSorely to clean everything up

People don’t understand jokes in this sub lmao"
Boys I hate to say it but the madden curse is very real... and it’s got our boy

i'm staring to feel bad for burrow. if we score this drive i hope he gets some momentum the next drive
Dude I might just turn this game off lmao. GG y'all.
I'm very much irritated right now. What's going on? What happened to the Ravens being a revolutionary run-first offense? ROMAN PLEASE! >:(
At this point I'm thinking Harbs is waiting to release JK and Gus at the forefront until later in the season to preserve them.
"If we pass before 3rd down at any point in the second half, I’m gonna be so pissed off"
Should’ve just started RG3 Lamar obviously isn’t 100%
"Jesus Christ. Someone was open enough. It's the NFL. Lamar's pass just lasered out at 100 mph and didn't even give the receiver a shot.

Literally wtf is our offense right now?"
FUCK MAN
[deleted]
Does Lamar have COVID?
Orlando Brown got beat on that pass.  He's really having a rough stretch here.
We know we can run I say keep passing
Fake?
"This game is way too close, I know it's unlikely but if the offense doesn't get it together, and the defense slips a couple times they could come back."

Lamar aint helping the narrative that he cant throw.
Lamar couldn’t hit the water if he fell out of a boat.

"Our offense is terrible. 

Lamar seems determined to be a pass only QB and its showing."

Getting it first makes sense with the “Ravens can’t win from behind” narrative. Too bad their offense sucks donkey dong.
"Am I crazy or is this old fuck calling Lamar ""Murray"" every other play"
I came here to see if anyone else was hearing Murray. Can someone @CBS on twitter and let em know we aint got Murray playing.
He definitely is.
Just did it again. My guy prepped for the wrong game.
LJ’s mom needs to get on Twitter and get them straightened out.
"Is a weird tick he has, because he only says murray during the play. Once the play is over, he says jackson. Hopefully their producers say something to him during the break."
I think this guy is drunk/high. So many mistakes today
Nah. It's every play.
Gumbel has been terrible and he usually doesn’t bother me. He also said “complete...” right after LJ’s interception. and then just went dead silent for 10 seconds before Gannon corrected him. And Gannon called one of LJ’s weird misfired passes a “coverage sack.” Just horrible announcing.
So it's not just me then. Every single drop dropback it seems.
How in the hell do you do this to the reigning mvp? This is some matt schaub shit
His producer needs to be correcting him
Inexcusable that it’s going on this long
I want a super cut of every time he said Murray
I literally only came here to check if anyone else was heading this lmao
"It was sorta funny the first time, now it’s just incredibly distracting."
Came here to complain about this lol
How have all of us noticed and none if their production? These announcers are horrible.
"“The pass is complete!”  

“...”  

“...”  

“...the pass was intercepted?”  

“Yah my b the pass was intercepted”"
Hahaha yup
Driving me crazy. He has said it 7 times
Yeah it’s nuts
"I kept hearing him called Marquise Brown, Marcus too. He has been so bad."
" A grasshopper walks into a bar and the bartender says “hey. We have a drink named after you!”

The grasshopper says, “you have a drink called Murray?” 

Sorry."
"Edit: Sorry. It is Greg Gumble.

Edit 2: I think someone finally told him. Our work here is done Reddit."
"Is greg gumble not harlan. Harlan would never, he is the GOAT"
It's because he's a gibroni
"Yeah, it's gotten pretty annoying.  He's done it like 5 times now."
Greg Gumbel is the play-by-play guy today; not Harlan.
I know. Driving me nuts. He has said it at least 8 times.
The fuck was that throw
Thanks
Update: he just did it again. I think he's high/drunk
"Why does /u/cringeemoji keep referring to Greg Gumble as ""Kevin Harlan"" on this reddit thread?"
don’t slander the great name of Kevin Harlan.
HUMPHREY IS THE GOAT
"With Dan Fouts retirement, Gumbel & Gannon inherit the dementia"
Getting old
Who cares. WHY does he keep calling Lamar Murray. It is driving me crazy.
""
Thought it was a Louisville throwback for a quick second
I chuckled
Greg Gumbel is going senile change my mind
"Arizona Cardinals --> Louisville Cardinals --> Baltimore Bird Team --> Black QB --> Lamar Murray.

That's the best I could come up with."
"Gumble is now apologizing lol. He knows he's had a bad day.

It's not his first bad day."
And Rich Gannon saying Marcus Peters was renowned for his ability to force fumbles. Next play Humph forces a fumble. Do they actual do their research?
Quality crappost. Have an upvote.
why do we always get the worst commentators
"Speaking as a football fan, a Lamar/Kyler Super Bowl would be tasty.

Speaking as a Ravens fan... pass."
I love Murray
Oof
My homies decided to make it a drinking game every time he said Murray. Ended up having to crack more than one beers.
BEST QB EVER

Just a scrimmage developing both QBs. Both are coming along well.
Good game as well. I hope burrow balls out for you guys!

MAKING HIS CASE FOR DROTY !!!! Playmaker !!!!
Thank god the packers drafted a QB
Ball don’t lie baby
He cracked Joe with so much vengeance😂
I haven’t watched anyone else except for the Seahawks. Defensively is he leading the roty race?
"At this point, I don’t see any reason to pay him long term. He needs to step up in a huge way over the last three quarters of the season if he’s trying to earn a deal - so far it looks like he’s just going through the motions knowing full well we’re planning to let him walk."
"He really needs to put up numbers to get a worthwhile landing spot. 

I don’t think Wink hasn’t been especially helpful in his schemes either."
"At this point I actively don’t like him. He’s good for a bone headed penalty each week, usually on third down, and he cannot finish his sacks. Mahomes is one thing, but Burrow? FOH dude, I wish we had someone better than him to bench his ass for, but unfortunately we do not."
Why would he go through the motions if he's trying to get paid? If anything he would try to ball out and sign a huge contract with the Jaguars or something. He's just not executing in a contract year.
"On a day we got 7 sacks, our “no. 1 pass rusher” got a grand total of 0."
Because he sucks. Why is it so hard for people to admit Judon is ass cheeks
[deleted]
"Oh no. 


He stole AJ's voodoo."
He was wide open?
"I'm happy to see Lamar getting better as a passer, but it feels like we are slowly loosing our mean pound the ball offense identity."
We need to establish a passing game and get some scary deep tape up.
"I have no clue. I think the coaches are using these games to improve Lamar as a passer, when the game is kind of already won?

But Lamar is missing passes he should make. Am I worried? Not really. But at the same time, its not really great to see."
"Lamar’s accuracy seems to have taken a step back.  I have no facts on this, just the eye test."
"I mean, the success we had last year running isn’t sustainable, especially losing Yanda. 

That being said the play calling by Roman these last few weeks has been questionable at best. 

Also don’t forget Lamar missed 2 practices this week. He’s clearly not 100%, I’m not really worried about it. 

That being said did the coaching staff forget about Dobbins?"
Idk I’m a little worried if Lamar is still making poor decisions throwing the ball...starting to loose my patience
Where are you seeing Lamar getting better as a passer?
Yanda retired.

"GG onto the next one. 

O-line needs to heal up, and our downfield passing game looks God awful/borderline non existent even against the Bungals. We will never win any meaningful games against good teams by running it."

I’ve never seen anything like it. Lamar has thrown it 28 times like we’re getting stomped out by the Chiefs again.
"Hopefully we'll add another panel at the bottom saying ""keep passing to practice for the playoffs"" or sum shit haha"
Abandoning the run after a false start and now starting the drive at 1st and 15
the playcalling and play design continues to be questionable as fuck. we’re doing well but bengals just keep giving us short fields. for fucks sake even the raiders have already put up 24 on the chiefs. y’all are gonna say i’m overreacting but roman needs to go and we need to hire someone else this shit is getting extremely annoying
I listened in on Q and Sarah Ellison post game and Q said he thought it was maybe a “get some live reps” type of situation.
"I see the ""passing as a way to help Lamar improve"" narrative, but in a run first offense, you run to set up the passing game. When we abandon the run, we never set up the pass game, have little success passing, and overall see morale decline. I can see it on Lamar's face every time he's on the sideline. He's not having fun like last year and this could actually be shattering his confidence."
I'm ready to move on
"I think this is a result of both life without Marshall and Lamar being hurt. If we're trying to limit Lamar, then we lose the read option which is our most efficient play (imo). Running without Yanda, well that doesn't need much of an explanation.

We need to chill and let Lamar really get healthy. He's not running, his throws are off. I'd be all for letting him rest for a week or 2. Groin injuries are a total bitch"
""
Herbert >joe burrow
Bengals o line is player of the game
"They’re getting to Lamar far too often and if it’s not fixed it’ll be the teams Achilles heel. Teams will be watching and far worse, it could lead to a Lamar injury."
"You lost the hall of fame glue guy in Yanda.

It doesn’t look great, but you hope it improves as the season goes on."
"Yeah, we do need to retool a bit"
Offense is playing like I do in Madden. Just trying to get good stats against a bad team and failing miserably. Though it’s kinda smart if they are trying to work on the passing game against a bad team. We can’t continue winning only one way
We need Lamar to do oline adjustments and hit the hot reads. Oline might be average but Lamar isnt helping

“Someone”
The Bengals have done a good job at stopping Murray on the ground today... 🤯
He never said Kyler so kinda dumb
I’m sorry guys but I’m not a believer in Greg romans offense any longer. He can’t scheme these receivers and I refuse to believe it’s the WR room. The offense looks so difficult. They can’t complete easy 5 and 6 yard passes consistently. They’ve invested in the RB room but aren’t making meaningful runs on downs that matter. It’s time for a new offense.
He’s a ground game master that appears to have abandoned the run
"I just don’t understand why he’s always so eager to move on from what’s been proven to work for our team. He did the same thing under the Niners offense. He’ll bust out a league-best offense one, maybe two years, and then immediately become complacent"
Imagine if we had Kubiak at OC right now..
"The WR corps is lacking. This has been an Achilles heel for the Ravens for a decade. I wish Waller hadn’t had a drug fueled breakdown after we drafted him, but he did. We really have no deep threat that teams are scared of. I’m not a fan of 15, but because of the relationship LJ has with 15 he continues to throw to him. These are wasted downs. We need a true no. 1 receiver like DJ Medcalf or Julio. We can’t go to a SB with a 5’9” wide receiver."
""
GOT EEM
It's a shame he hasn't lived up to his potential. Will be happy that he's one less player that we have to give a big boy contract too.
Terrible effort on this post

Fumble 6!
I LOVE THIS DEFENSE !!!!! GIVE PATRICK DROTY ALREADY !!!!! ALL PROOOO MONEY MAN MARLOOOOOOOOOO !!!!! THANK GOD FOR THIS DEFENSE CAUSE THE OFFENSE HAS BEEN MEDIOCRE TODAY
The defense murdered them. I can’t say I enjoyed watching Joe get handled like that tho😂
pass rush was good today. I mean it was against a piss poor oline but i’m glad they did what they were supposed to do
"Queen DROY

Marlo DPOY

Duvernay OROY

Jackson SB MVP


Real talk, cause the first two are the most likely.. have the DROY AND DPOY ever came from the same team?

I know the Saints had ORoY and DRoY with Kamara."
I feel like I’ve said enough.
"I realize I’m super biased but any chance he gets a couple votes for DPOY?

Guy hasn’t given up a touchdown all year.."
3 FFs in 5 games
Dude is unreal. His extension seems like a bargain.
"It’s Gilmore, White, and Marlon. Then everyone else"
DPOY
"yes roman deserves criticism for play calling and i get that. but another reason both the passing game and lamar have looked shoddy - lamar isn’t taking what’s in front of him. he looks for the big play too often. there have been tons of times today and over the course of the season shallow crosses and drags are open, and lamar throws into coverage instead. sometimes it works, but often times it doesn’t. they need to work with him into taking what’s readily available, as opposed to always looking for the big play."
"it’s true, but that’s like 3 or 4 plays. roman just doesn’t design good passing plays. he uses boykin as a decoy to run downfield like 70% of the time and still the only wr who even gets open is hollywood. lamar isn’t having his best game right now but roman is starting to show why he keeps getting fired from his other jobs"
Running the ball opens up the big play my friend
"Lamar looks like he’s trying to stay in the pocket and prove he is a traditional passer. Regardless of whether that’s the case or it’s playcalling or he’s hurt, he hasn’t looked good lately."
"Lamar was sick this week and missed 2 practices. He looked bad today, but I'll let it slide this one time"
"I completely agree, BUT I would like some more creativity out of Roman. More motions, different formations, or maybe let Lamar call some audibles at the line change up the play, you rarely see him do that. I do agree Lamar does throw deep a bit too much, and sometimes the deep throws aren’t near the WR. He needs to spread the ball more, throw some short routes anything. Miles Boykin I think can be such a great WR but he doesn’t get the opportunities."
"It's not all on him. This offense has been sleep walking since week 2.

1) Lamar is extremely inconsistent.


2) Right side if the line is a joke


3) we are very predictable when we pass


4) Lamar cant handle blitzes at all


5) Ingram clearly lost a step


6) WRs cant get any seperation unless its schemed (including Hollywood)"
"Man I can't buy this take even though I want too cause I like Roman.

There is zero reason why you can't put out Mandrews, Brown/Duv, Boyle/Ricard, Ingram/Gus, and Dobbins and just cram the ball down the defenses throat.

All of them catch, all of them block, all of the backs + Lamar can RUN.

Not one defense has shown signs of being able to stop our run game. So run it. Don't hide it. They know it's coming. The whole league knows it's coming for 1.5 seasons and they can't stop it unless we give it up. It doesn't matter. Run it.

And while we're at it run it and no huddle that shit so the defense can't substitute the whole first half of the game. You want to get creative, Ingram and Dobbins can both split out a la Rice, Brown/Duv can end around, even Boyle/Ricard can catch on a screen or something...

Seriously! Let our OLine eat on the run game like they are built to do. Let them lean on a D-Line for a half.. and then when the other offense has only had 7 minutes of ball time in the first half down 21.. if you want to pass and work the pass... Have at it.. but the first time you 3 & out.. you better go back to running that shit.

I get it's ""easier"" for other teams to run out of 11 and we are trying to do that more.. but we aren't feasting on being like other teams. We were the team that DIDN'T want Jackson at receiver. We were the team that put a while offense around him. We are not the team that does what everyone else does.

RUN ROMAN RUN."

Nice of an old teammate to escort him to the endzone.
"That play highlights what I love about queen. He may not be in position all the time, but damn if he isn’t at least the second ravens there to help/make a play"
Anyone else recognize another play with the bengals based on the field position?
...
Marlon is the best DB in the league.
Consider the Queen for DROY campaign started
"4-1 is still 4-1. Need to clean up some things for when we play Pittsburgh.

Edit: Whoa thanks for the gold!"
I think it's getting safe to say that Judon will not be getting a long term contract from us.
That wasn’t Lamar we saw today. That was Murray.
Lamar seems to want to show he can throw deep but keeps throwing into double coverage. It's insane
"Defense good 

Offense... Bad"
Anyone else see Lamar limping post game? Bye Week can’t come soon enough
"Very Flacco-esque victory today.

Y'know, the scariest thing about this Ravens team is how we are still crushing the other team despite how mediocre our offense is playing, albeit being two of the worst teams in football these last two weeks, it's still somewhat promising to know that we haven't peaked yet."
"I’m hoping the odd playcalls are because Roman wants the guys to get live passing reps against a weaker team since there was no preseason

Great game by the D!!!"
"Ok so I know I’m supposed to talk about how shitty our offense played and how this the “shittiest blowout win” you could have, maybe it’s because people like watching offense more than defense overall. But our defense played so phenomenal that I hope more people talk about that. This is honestly one of the best defensive performances I have ever seen (not exaggerating) and it reminded me of old school Ravens football. That is something more people should be happy about and not take for granted. There is still a reason why we blew them out even if it wasn’t the typical blowout."
I think Lamars knee is bugging him more than theyre telling us. He looked uncomfortable all day.
"FUCK U CHIEFS!

THANK YOU RAIDERS!"
Defense the REAL MVP
"Patrick queen is really gonna be a ravens legend huh?

Edit: thank you for gold! My first ever."
Why cant Roman just run the fucking ball against a porous run D. They're trying to turn Lamar into something he's not overnight instead of taking incremental steps and it's hurting our offense
I’m sure this was mentioned in the game thread but why the hell did Roman call the game like we were losing once we went up 17-0? There is no excuse for Lamar to throw the ball almost 40 times against the Bengals.
"The defense is starting to coalesce. Some of our young guys had big days. Great to see. 

The offense is going in the opposite direction. They have no identity or cohesion. Greg had a couple bad playcalls but was decent overall imo. 

Lamar on the other hand was awful. 6 interceptable passes. 3 thrown right to the defender. 2 happened on b2b plays. His decision making has never been worse than it was today. He was very sloppy with the football. He looked like he wasn't prepared for the bengals' scheme. IMO, his 2 days of missed practice factored in here. Look for him to have a bounceback game next wk (if he practices).

The offense has way too many miscues as well. The tape from this game will be horror show worthy on O.

Hopefully, the offense gets some practices in and figures it out."
Greg Roman needs to get his shit together.  There is zero fucking reason Lamar should be throwing the ball 37 times in a blowout win.
Defense
"Marlon makes plays PERIOD. Contract looking better by the week. Rest of the D not looking too shabby, but Cincy has some pass protection problems, even with Burrow holding onto the ball too long sometimes. Our OLine problems still persist and Lamar is trying to do too much. 4-1 still and with some work to do."
"That offensive performance does not give me any confidence.  This is a shitty take for a 27-3 win with a lights out defensive performance, but man...

Edit: Thanks for gold birdbro!"
"From the looks of this week's game thread, was it a blessing in disguise that I wasn't able to watch this game? lol"
"Defense was fucking scary today

Offense was disappointing but hopefully it was mainly because Lamar missed some practice."
MONEY BAG MARLOOO
"DEFENSE! 

Thank you!"
"Someone in this thread is confusing the guild button for the upvote button lol.

I'm really proud of our D today. Especially Humphrey and Queen. But we still have to figure out how to call passing plays. And Greg, please run the call more! It's our greatest strength!"
I mean... the offense can only go up from here right?
"Will receiver's ever be safe from Marlon Humphrey? Is there even a chance they figure out how to defend themselves from the dreaded Fruit Punch

Wow, my first Gold! Thanks!"
"Every team in the North is getting better on offense and we're still trying to figure it out. I know last season was kind of similar, but I don't think we have much time to waste. Gotta get it together and quick. Ay least the defense looks great outside of playing Kansas City."
"Who thinks it's time for Duvernay to start over Boykin? Yea G. Roman needs to figure something out as far as an offensive scheme. Lamar got real lucky the Bengals defenders didn't feel like catching the picks he was throwing today.  Please can we for the love of god run the ball more.

Thank god for Marlo,Queen and the rest of the defense. Good defensive win, Offense better fix it's self soon we got a bunch of tough games upcoming."
"Either our pass plays are designed horribly or Lamar is having trouble passing, hoping it’s the former"
I feel so bad for Joe Mixon
"What a fucking putrid offensive performance. That score should have been in the high 50’s. This kind of shit won’t cut it agajnst the steelers and the tits and the chiefs.

Lamar must be sick or some shit. Im worried aout him man, why the fuck did they keep him in the pocket so much?

Defense good. Offense bad.
Happy bout the win and disappointed in the offense. Way too much talent to only put up 14 on this team
"I’m convinced Roman wants a head coaching a big, so he’s trying to pad the stats, but is failing at it."

TODAY ITS A GOOD DAY RAVENS WON AND CHIEFS LOST!!! PARTY TIME
"I think it’s pretty clear that they were staying away from the option run with Lamar, and the offense suffered for it.

The dude is clearly not 100%, and why force him to run when you’re up 17 in the first half?
A little concerning, but the 2nd half playcalling by Roman was just awful..."
How are we all feeling about Hollywood Brown moving forward imo he hasn't made a huge impact so far is that his fault is it Lamars fault? Other receiver's from his draft class have started to come on lately and I'm just waiting for him to make his presence felt
Raining gold in here
Give me gold /s
Maybe we should hold off on bringing the brinks truck for Lamar

Pleasantly surprised seeing Ferguson flash at run D. Still waiting on his sack potential though
Why do we keep so many RBs on the payroll if we're not going to use them? It seems like our roster is setup for the opposite of the plays we're calling on game day..
"Before burying Lamar, keep in mind that his QBR before today was 6th in the league. His amount of TD's was 11th and his interceptions was 4th least. I can't find the updated stats, but they will still be good. If this is what Lamar looks like while being slowed down it's not bad.

The phantom knee injury is really concerning. They can take a long time for normal runners to get rid of. I don't know about Lamar, since he is made of something different, but it's still concerning."
"Is it just me or does Lamar seem not quite as quick on his feet this year in his scrambles?

edit; just saw in this thread he has an ankle issue. did not know that."
As a Chiefs fan I'm glad your fanbase is one of the few that isn't putting the chiefs on blast for their horrible game today. Congratz on the win boys! We hope to see you in the playoffs!
"I watched the Ravens game since my lions were off. Wow y’all been fun to watch before but damn, is this what it’s like to be a fan of a good team? So much fun to watch."
"Bro joe burrow just face down ass up on the turf while your d just ran train on his supple rookie bussy, massive fucking tenderloins lubed up and brined in man sweat, slow cooking in his rectum at body temperature until they became rancid and tender enough to not need chewing and then turns around and let them spoon feed the rotten fucking hogslop to him all with a smile on his face, great defensive showing."
"Hoping lamar's struggles this week can be mostly attributed to lack of practice/knee injury. But he has not been in 2019 form since week 1 this year. That said, he looked pedestrian through the first 5 weeks of last season as well."
What a pussy FG by Cincy lmfao. At least try for a TD with your rookie
Love this defense
"""Murray, present."""
"I wonder how much Lamar’s illness/knee bothered him today. He was noticeably off in multiple ways. Luckily our defense had Burrow locked down

Edit: thank you for the gold!"
"I haven’t seen anything posted yet about this but, anyone curious about Lamar not playing at 100%? He missed 2 practices this week, I’m guessing that’s why they were throwing so much and the lack of option runs"
"Defense looked very solid against a poor offensive team. The offense looked very mediocre and Lamar looked very mediocre vs one of the worst rush defenses in the league. There were flares of greatness but it wasn't consistent. Like everyone else, I think they need to run the ball a lot more and be more consistent. I don't have an answer for that, it seems like an OLine issue to me."
"If we learned anything from this game, it’s we need better receivers. Andrews can’t do everything. We need a true #1 receiver, if we want to go deep in the playoffs."
"It’s tough to tell how much of Lamar’s regression is due to a nagging injury, being worried about a worse O-line, or something else entirely, but I have faith in the team to get something figured out. There was always regression coming from an offense like last year. Remember, at this point last year we were 3-2 and one week removed from being blown out by the browns."
Queen is king
"I said it earlier, but there must be a lot of new fans here. You have to remember the days of yore. Testaverde, Banks, Redman, Grback, Boller. When we went to our first Super Bowl, our kicker, Stover, was one of our best offensive producers. Its in our DNA when one side of the team isn't doing great, the other can carry us. I know; last year our offense was so fun to watch, but we'll get there!"
"Why is Lamar throwing that sloppy sidearm bullshit? I don’t get it, he just looked uncomfortable"
Congratulations to you guys on another win! Love you all
Just got off work. That punch out for the touchdown was the single most beautiful defensive play I've seen in uesrs. Talk about the concentration and grit from Marlon. Dudes a fucking legend.
It is time to move on from Boykin
Holy shit you beat our asses. Am I surprised? No. But I was hoping to put up more than 3 points.
I know some may not agree but I think we should get rid of judon and stanley I was not impressed with neither today and some team will be dumb enough to give us a first for stanley and possibly a 3rd for judon and a player idk I could be reaching I would love for us to get two first rounders somehow for next year
"To be honest,  I love that we try different things when we are clearly winning.  It's all free practice. 

I do think Lamar looks less agile somehow.  Or that he forces himself to plant his feed and take the sack/ get hit.  I know it's ridiculous to think he does it on purpose but something looks... off.."
"OMG DEFENSES HAVE FIGURED US OUT (were 4-1 averaging 30 points a game) lol.

Everyone take a deep breath. There’s a lot of rookies on the team and well click more as the season goes on. There was no preseason and a virtual offseason and they’ll get better. Meanwhile we’re winning games by two possessions or more. It’s fine. The chiefs lost to the raiders and the 9ers got blown out by the dolphins, we are coasting along pretty well as they improve more."
Can I have gold?
I'm less upset about losing and more upset about having the Trace McSorley song in my head.
"Amazing game from the defence, way to get into Burrow’s head & dominate from start to finish. 

Also pretty bush league for Taylor to go for the FG to ruin the Ravens shut out - he’s been in the league long enough to know how bullshit that is. Wink & the defensive staff won’t forget, expect that joke of an offensive line to get dominated in the next matchup too."
"I'm thinking something's up with Lamar. First missing practice, not running today, bad reads, and the limping in the post-game. I'm smelling an RG3 spot start incoming. 

Interior line is still a problem IMO, and this game I think showed what we currently have isn't good enough. Really hope we look into a Larry Warford, but idk how we'd make the money work. 

RB's and Secondary are still disgustingly good. Receivers not named Brown or Andrews are still not good (Though Duvernay is still interesting)."
Shit performance against a shit team. Still happened to pull out a win. Love my Ravens but this makes me concerned.
"Not happy with the team. No signs of improvement over the last few weeks. 
Lamar hasn't looked good this year. Might be hurt. That frames the question of why we were passing so much. 

If Lamar is hurt why didn't we go run heavy once we were up 17-0? That's on the coaching staff. Changes need to be made if we are going to win a playoff game. 

The Steelers will reveal what kind of team we really are. We might not be able to score vs their D."
What’s happened to our RPO offense? The one that was kind of good last year.
Pittsburgh is good. Like probably better than us right now. We need to figure some shit out

Dude played like he was possessed. He smelled blood in the water against his former teammate and he balled out with that motivation to see Burrow on the ground. He's looking better and better. Rough game/benching against KC was needed and he's looking like tried and true Raven already.

Entire Defense looked amazing. Marlon gets major props, close second for player of the game for me. As well as Peters, MCPhee, Elliott all looked great and contributed as well."

I don't know how to check this but this has to be the first game in NFL history when all five starting DBs had a sack."
"Marlon Humphrey. Queen also had a great game, but his td run was set up by Marlon's punch out"
Marlon Humphrey!
"I’m gonna go out of the box here and say **Tyus Bowser**. Felt like dude was everywhere, made tons of tackles, set the edge well, and was in Burrow’s backfield constantly. Looking like a legit player"

Patrick Queen
Does our secondary have more sacks total than our line?
"Pernell McPhee, he dominated"
#Marvin Humphrey & Juiceman
"Just gonna echo everybody else and say Defense/Humphrey. Though low key I thought Jimmy Smith had a very good game. I didn’t hear his name called much, and when I saw him in coverage he was always plastered to his man. Maybe that’s because he didn’t get that many snaps and was given easier assignments, but either way, it was good to see him execute well. I’m not trying to put him out there as player of the game, more just mentioning his effort to make the point about this being a win for team defense."

I want to tell myself that they were just trying out a whole bunch of shit once we were up by a comfortable margin but I’m not super convinced of that
I think it’s safe to say he’s not going to be in Baltimore when the seasons over. Maybe even sooner if shit goes downhill for us. Idk if it’s still Super Bowl or bust if we’re being realistic. Today’s play calling was abysmal. But we’re still 4-1 only reason the Steelers are most likely going to be 4-0 is because they haven’t played anybody.. giants Broncos Texans and eagles
I feel like every game this year Roman has either abandoned the run or stuck to it way too sutbbornly.

Why would you target Marlon Humphrey?
And he’s just getting started
Sometimes I feel like he allows a bit of separation so the QB think the receiver is open and he just comes in and hits the ball out.
He's simply a beast. Even some of the best athletes at DB can't transition inside and do what he's doing. Special player.
Best CB in football!

And we refuse to incorporate Duv more when the other teams have been saying for weeks that all they have to do is follow Andrews and Hollywood
"Spread out offensive distribution against philly coming up... hopefully.

Duvernay is a real player. It's time to get him involved."
Start Duvernay over Boykin...maybe convert Boykin to TE? Snead has been absent the past couple weeks and i think its time that we start Dobbins over Ingram. We are def feeling the hurt of not having Yanda on the oline.
jessie bates is a bengals safety fyi
"When J.K. Dobbins in the slot is probably the third best receiving option in Baltimore's offense (only because we haven't really seen Devin Duvernay yet in the passing game), it's extremely difficult for the Ravens to rely heavily on the pass like they have been doing.

Competent teams know if you limit Andrews and/or Brown, Lamar is going to have trouble trying to get the football to anyone else. Boyle is never going to beat a defense, Boykin has been a disappointment/hasn't taken that next step and Snead IV has largely been invisible this year outside of the Browns game.

I know other users were saying that maybe the Ravens were ""testing"" things out against the Bengals, where they were trying to get their passing attack going instead of going to the tried-but-true rushing game. However, when Jackson is still focusing on Mark and Hollywood for the most part, I feel like the result is that there isn't enough talent on the team at the moment to force Lamar Jackson to beat teams with his arm. Like, at least try to get Duvernay and maybe James Proche more involved in the offense if you want to pass more; but even that hasn't been the case."
It'll get exploited once we play a real team again
Devin Durvernay in the slot needs a chance. He is explosive.he needs more targets
If he knew that why couldn’t he stop them then🧐
Not wrong but still fuck you
"I honestly think the offensive regress is two fold. The obvious being Yanda, but less obvious being Hurst. 

I think Lamar needs multiple reliable TEs"
This offense is so damn predictable when it comes to the passing game. If we don’t start getting everyone involved our team is basically going to do this every game. Bruh fucking Baker Mayfield looking better than our guy he’s throwing to everyone. Roman needs to go
"I don't understand it. Y'all remember that  99 yard drive vs. Cleveland week 1? Here let me remind you of the passing on that drive:

LJ to Ricard for 9 yards

LJ to Boykin for 25 yards

LJ to Hollywood for 21 yards

LJ to Hollywood for 4 yards

LJ to Snead for 16 yards

Mixed into all of that was a combined 21 yards rushing between Edwards, Ingram, and Dobbins.

Drive capped off with a 3 yard Dobbins score. Didn't even include Duv, Andrews, and Boyle. 

My point- we have so many weapons. I could be wrong, but it seems like he just keys into Andrews and Hollywood so much. 

&#x200B;

The two drives vs. the Bengals today that led to touchdowns was 93 yards combined. The offense was not able to move the ball at all against a pedestrian Bengals defense. Something needs to change with the target share.  Sharing the ball is a concept taught to second graders!"
Trade. Gallup. Do it EDC
Isn’t the problem arguably more scheme / play calling related than specific players being able to get open? When you watch other offenses that are doing well they seem to have more variety and deception which allows for big plays. We all what happens when Lamar is healthy and we have the RPO booming. Passing alone will never work unless you have the run to set up the pass or at least have some type of creative play calling.
We don’t have man beaters!
Duv and Proche need to get more reps moving forwards. Lamar has no interest in throwing to Boykin or Snead. Move Boykin to TE3 and have him run easier routes like slants and drags. He doesn’t compete well outside the numbers.
Lamar's biggest weakness. Doesn't give the others a chance. No wonder Boykin looks dejected and gives up on plays
Is AB going to prison? If not then let's just have a cup of coffee as a courtesy.
"I’ve been saying this since we played the chiefs ! Our pass game is basically Brown & Andrew’s. 


Isn’t it amazing that Andrew’s is getting doubled and he’s putting up better numbers than Boykins."
"That's why I don't see the point of a superstar receiver, even though I would love one."
He and Boykin are another planet. Snead has been invisible. Think we need more Duvernay.. or AB in week 9..
Trade Dobbins for CeeDee Lamb.
Throw to Boykin. Or at least look his way.
Just take of your own shit

I’m also a huge fan of Marlon in run support but I don’t know how White and Gilmore are in that area"

Or maybe its just me.
"1) Lamar obviously isn’t 100% 

2) missing Yanda affects the offense a LOT 

3) looks like Ingram has lost a half step. I think starting JK and Edwards and then throwing Ingram in as the fresh legs guy would be the wiser move

4) no #1 WR. Hollywood isn’t a #1 guy. Duvernay has shown a ton of potential the more he gets put in though. If he gets more involved in the passing game as time goes on we’ll be fine. 

5) Greg Roman has tried to get way too cute with play calling and his passing schemes aren’t particularly good."
No Yanda.  Lamar has been hurt all year.   No preseason.  Still no number one receiver.
"My biggest glaring difference is not having 3 TEs along with an elite guard (Yanda) to give Lamar an extra blocker and more options in the RPO.

WITH an extra TE, Lamar had more time to run through his reads, let plays develop and throw accurate darts to multiple receivers, or multiple backs, or tuck and run for 8+ yards getting ABSOLUTELY SILLY with defenders. 

Now, our playbook isn't as creative or imaginative, and Greg Roman is getting exposed every week, even when we win. 

We desperately need another blocking tight end. I mean, in the long run, getting JK Dobbins was a good trade for Hayden Hurst.... but it won't take long for defenses to get the better of Greg and Lamar. 

Our 4-1 record disguises it and makes us look better than we are... but, things need to change if we're aiming for the chip"
The fundamental problem is that our personnel have changed but our play calling and schemes have not. The plays that were explosive last year were so explosive because Lamar had more time to make reads and pick the best course of action.
Sign Antonio. This receiving Corp is terrible.
"Biggest issue is Jackson-Boykins! Lamar needs to be able to count on him here and there when Brown and Andrew’s aren’t on point and right now that’s not happening. No one had replaced the Robert’s yet and he was barely that productive except a few clutch catches (playoffs not included)

Teams are also playing the run very hard!"

Good player and good dude. Sucks to see it happen.
That was horrible. Dak is a great guy who put his heart and soul into that team.
I like Dak a lot. It’s a shame he has to play for the Cowboys because I can and will never root for them. But I think it’s extremely important what Dak is doing in terms of promoting mental health.
"Really like Dak. Classy guy and really talented, he was absolutely carrying that team and it sucks to a top 5-10 QB go down like that"
That injury was hard to watch I hope he doesn't have any long term effects from it. How he left the field was infinitely better than how Earl handled it
By all accounts dak seems to be a great human being and an awesome qb. Good vibes sent his way and hope he heals up soon. The league is better with him in it!

"I've never heard anyone say a single bad word about Dak as a person. Even the people that criticize him onfield have nothing bad to say off of it. When this stuff happens it sucks regardless of who it is, but it's the worst when it's a genuinely good guy. Here's hoping he's able to make a swift recovery."
Funny how life works. Dak's injury happens on the same day as their division rival's QB miraculously returns from a horrific leg injury. Hope he comes back as well!
"I mean, it sucks...but that can happen when you bet on yourself and turn down 105 million dollars in guaranteed money."
if the jones camp doesn't take care of this dude if he never plays again or if he plays again for them then fk the cowboys to the depths of hell and beyond.
"was watching the game as it happened, thought he'd just sprained it until they showed a close up......"
Sad year for Dak with his brother passing too. Thoughts for the dude. Heal up!
"That was stomach turning. Felt so bad for him. The slow motion replay was like something out of a horror movie. 

Andy Dalton is a good backup, though. He’s got a lot of experience as a starter."
Hope for a speedy recovery
"T’s and P’s for his hopefully quick recovery. But on the other side of the pillow, our D gets to sack the piss out of Andy Dalton again this season"
I’m not a fan of the cowboys but I feel bad anytime someone gets hurt like that. When the Steelers had that player break his neck I felt bad and I hate the Steelers
"Man, that sucks so hard. It’s the sprinkles on the shit cake the Cowboys have given him over the past year or so."
"Yea that replay was up there with the Kevin Ware injury replay. I'm surprised they even showed it. I feel for Dak though, I hate to see that happen."
Jerry Jones should be ashamed for not giving him his payday. It's not his fault the whole team underwhelmes each and every year. I hate Dallas but I want Dak to succeed at the same time
That injury looked really bad. Im honestly hoping he keeps the foot at this point.
And this is why I never fault players for holding out. Dak thought he was worth a certain price and was absolutely exceeding that this year. Jerry needs to take care of him
"I was watching that game for fantasy purposes: I have Zeke, and my opponent had Dak. 

Seeing that injury made me sick man, took all the fun out of it. 

Definitely wishing him the best. He proved himself to be way better than I ever gave him credit for personally. Hopefully nothing that will affect his career long term"
I have to say after everything I realized this means we face the Andy Dalton led Cowboys next month and i breathed a sigh of relief
"Another win for that plucky, likeable underdog Jerry Jones."
"Extra sucks in that it's kinda similar to Earl Thomas in Seattle, he's been trying to get paid for so long now and now he gets hurt and that'll be used against him"

Who cares? We already beat the Browns and we’ll see the Colts in a couple weeks and beat them too
"Or, alternatively, our defense is so good they shut them down :)"
"who gives a shit 

/r/browns is that way"
We’re going to beat them again
Have you seen some of the throws baker has given up to the colts? He throws it straight at defenders
"They beat the bungles, football team, and dem boyz. Calm down"
"What do you mean re-established? It’s always been a super competitive division (minus the browns) but it is about to get tougher. 

After how we played today, we will struggle the next time we face the Browns."
4 wins vs non competitive teams with bottom 5 defenses.
Really? I'm not scared of a team who has only beaten up on bad defenses and has a terrible secondary and run defense. 4-1 against bum teams.
"This time last year we were 3-2. We weren’t sure where we were headed or what Lamar would become. This year we’re 4-1, already beaten 2 division rivals, and haven’t even hit our stride yet. So long as we keep the ship afloat and don’t peak early (like last year), I’m fine with this. There’s a lot of season left, and we have yet to get hot. I’m looking forward to 8 weeks from now..."
Can’t disagree as it is super early. At this point we just need to keep winning and make the playoffs.
"The guy is 23 years old and we are winning right now. If he never shows improvement, or if we start losing, I’ll be worried. For now though we are getting it done and that’s all that matters."
I’m fine with the team. Just pissed Cleveland and Shitsburgh keep winning. They play next week so one of them should finally take a loss.
I’m confident we’ll make the playoffs win the division and everything what I’m worried about is if he plays like this against any good team we are screwed
I'm honestly not sure if this just wasn't a purposefully unusual game plan to get some different work in against a team we felt confident we could handle without playing our best football.
Also keep in mind that there was a shorter training camp and no preseason too.
I’d like to remind everyone that Lamar is 23 years old
Every game is something new to complain about. We can improve but we're not fucking awful
This kind of talk would get you a request to kill yourself in the game day thread today. I fucking hate some of our fans sometimes
"Production doesn't matter, only in the big games, not against the Bengals or subpar teams. Lj had his production last year and won an MVP. Now he needs to focus on his passing game fundamentals and decision making and step up his situational passing skills so we can finally throw on good teams with success when we are falling behind. 

I'm worried about Lamar's PROGRESSION. He doesn't look good throwing the ball so far this year, seems to have regressed from last year now that teams have his number, and our o-line is not as dominant. He is still very young, so maybe with more time he will continue to develop, but it's getting dangerously close to the point of something's gotta give. 

We are spoiled as Ravens fans now that our offense is the clear path to success in the LJ era.  Everytime I want to scream at LJ for throwing ducks, or making mistakes....I remember the Joe Flacco era. Outside of the run game we were always mediocre offensively and struggled in the regular season against a lot of teams good and bad ones. However despite his mediocrity, the one thing about Joe was dude was a winner in the regular season and post season, and found a way to play great during our super bowl run. It was vanilla ice cream offense, but somehow we stuck it out for a long time and became champs. And we all know some of those ""we want Tyrod Taylor"" Flacco games throughout the years lol the Jags game still gives me nightmares and a couple against Shatsburgh too.

If we could win a super bowl building around Joe Flacco, we should be able to do so building around LJ. We just have to figure out how to shy away from the run and throw it when we are falling behind against playoff teams, and just the passing game in general needs a lot of work.

We are lucky to have LJ as we we're lucky and blessed to have Flacco too as crap as he was at times, atleast now we are a respectable  primetime football team with one of the most electric and fun young QBs...and this will always be the silver lining if Lj continues to struggle against good teams or in the playoffs."

"I always love seeing this kind of stuff on the internet, still out there.

Top comment on one of the videos says it's from 8 years ago, welcoming him to Baltimore and hoping he wins the starting job. So trippy."

Meh it's all a crapshoot and for $20
"Frighteningly reminiscent of Ray Rice. 

I reeeeeeeally hope he breaks out the second half of the season. I mean, then what was the point in getting rid of Hayden Hurst who complemented Greg Roman's 3 TE sets so well and gave our offense and RPOs so many options???

We're suffering from Hayden's departure... why not at least utilize our shiny new toy we got for it?????

I just don't understand."
They really need to use him more. But I'm starting to sound like a broken record
"He is learning, I think a good deal of play calling is used to coach players this year as well...but I'm so stoked for him and Duvernay. He looks phenomenal and those ""training wheel"" hand plants are so reminiscent of RR."
"I really hope he breaks out too, he’s hungry and patiently waiting his turn. He was a top 2 RB in the draft class and for him to not be seeing the field very much it’s kind of annoying (for me personally) I love Ingram but we needs some new juice in the backfield, Dobbins is dangerous with the ball in his hands."
Jk is learning as he doesn't have the benefit of a preseason. Pass protection and general offensive scheme is still being learned. Not saying he is ignorant or dumb but lamar having to move him around pre snap is indicative of him not quite being ready
"He’s a rookie who has played 5 games, calm down. His time will come next year when Ingram walks."
"I think Dobbins would. He has been amazing for a rookie. I love Ingram but he just isn’t too good, but Edwards is doing alright.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/j9gp28)"
Either way it’s clear Ingram is the least effective of the 3 but he gets the most carries because the coaches value experience over talent to an almost detrimental degree. Same thing happened during OBJ’s rookie year when he was clearly better than hurst but coaching doesn’t give young talent opportunities easily
"Dobbins is the only one that's dynamic in the passing game and at this point I don't know what Ingram brings that Edwards doesn't do just as well if not better.

Give Ingram Gus' current role and FREE JK."
"Ingram is 4.6 ypc on 45 attempts (almost triple Dobbins attempts.)

Edwards is 5.7 on 34 (over double the snaps of Dobbins.)

Dobbins is 7.9 on 16 attempts.  

Who does he get the snaps over? You are being ridiculous if you think Dobbins maintaining 6 ypc (let alone 7.9) on Gus' carries."
"Yup I think a 1,2 punch of dobbins and Gus would be perfect."
People are forgetting that one of the main reasons why Gus is doing so well is because he is coming in after halftime pounding a tired D. I think he would still be a decent RB1 but not near the level he is doing now. I wouldn't mind trying Dobbins as RB1 for a stint though with Ingram as backup

Damn you right 😅
The Cowboys Oline is beat up enough he could get sacked as much as Burrow was

And Matthew Judon had.... Zero.

Rays facemask and bionic arm are absolutely incredible
Sure feels good having the defensive torch being carried on.
There will never be another 52-20 combo in the NFL... But if they even draw a comparison that would be just fine with me
I mean that is easily the most beautiful picture I've ever seen.
🔥🔥🔥
"Still quite a way to go, but I would love it if these two became half of what the terror 52-20 was on defense ."
"let's cool it on those takes for a minute. I mean, Patty cake is still a rookie. But, I would very much like this to be a reasonable comparison come 2023."
"We haven't had a #52 since Ray, right?"
"Ray wasnt a liability in coverage. Queen is a great thumper, but I bet we see more Fort than Queen against the Steelers and Bills."
THIS is the feeling that makes you get all tingly and smile
"Hopefully soon this is one of those ""that's the same picture"" memes"
I'll never be a fan of the actual number 48. It just looks terrible.

"I don’t get everyone shitting on him for not trying to catch the ball, unless he has a 10 foot vertical, it wasn’t gonna happen.

The effort he put in after the INT though 😂"
He doesn’t look like he wants to be a bengal anymore.
He was benched for this. AJ Green is now on the outside looking in on the Bengals. Crazy.
What the hell happened to him?
"Bengals don’t deserve AJ Green, they never have but unfortunately that on tape is going to hurt him in free agency, no pun intended"
"This dude literally was running *away* from the ball after it got intercepted

Is he good? I'm kind of concerned"
Clown franchise should have traded him for picks or OL while they had the chance
"After all the pain this dude inflicted on us this past decade, I don't feel the least bit bad lmao"

Aka we lost to a statistically mediocre football team that is well coached?
[removed]
"We can kill Roman's playcalling and gameplan all we want but those first 2 drives, the playcalling was creativity and perfect, honestly."
"It isn‚Äôt his drive to drive play calling that sucks, it is the overall coaching (pre snap penalties, alignment issue, wr communication issues, snapping issues, etc etc), and the situational play calling (our 4th down plays have been extremely questionable at times, like direct snapping in the rain to a rb with a snapper who has issues, or direct snapping it to Lamar in an empty set in the titan games). 

Like look at the Patriots, they had the highest 4th and 1 success rate of all time by just qb sneaking it with Brady. If you shotgun snap it on 4th and 1, you are probably over thinking it, qb sneaks work really well, so do power dives, yet most of our 4th down conversions are shotgun snaps, empty backfield with 0 deception. He makes some seriously questionable decisions in key moments, abandons the run when we are down in games, and seems strait adverse to up tempo, which has worked for us everytime we try it with Lamar

Roman isn‚Äôt a bad scheme guy, but he is like the Pees of offence, he shoots himself in the foot at key moments and costs you important games. We probably were better off keeping him at run game coordinator and finding a young creative coach to work those schemes into a an offence that can use wrs better, and scheme guys open"
"The thing with Roman is that's two games in a row where we've seen some new wrinkles added in. 

NOW we gotta see that throughout the entire game. Not just a drive here and there or after a half. It has to be consistent"
Last week he had horrible scripted plays and great adjustments.  This week he had great scripted plays and terrible adjustments.
"This is because those are the drives that are scripted.. they work it in practice that's how they want to attack the defense that week.

Roman falls apart when he gets punched in the mouth, he panics and loses his Identity. And he simply CANNOT put together a passing offense.. he is Cam Cameron with a running game."
Do we have to qb sneak it with Lamar? Can‚Äôt we put someone else in at qb for that so what happened to Mahomes doesn‚Äôt happen to Lamar.
""
"Lol doesn‚Äôt it suck that this asshole is the only one in the media NOT dumping on Lamar? 

But I‚Äôll take it I guess"
Also we didn‚Äôt have 3 of our best run stoppers on our defense. Who would‚Äôve figured NE would run the ball so well?
Wait he's defending him?!?!
"I thought Lamar did fine.
With a full roster that game would have been a lock.
We need to tighten up on those penalties so when Lamar works his magic it‚Äôs not immediately reversed."
"I think Colin gets a bad wrap around here. I usually find his takes interesting and well thought out. He paints with very broad strokes a lot, so tgst could be a critique, but to me, that‚Äôs what makes him interesting. He can box things in to be able to point things out."
B-b-b-b-based
I feel like the talking heads have transitioned to being on Lamars side which I‚Äôm all for. Even though I don‚Äôt take sports shoes seriously it‚Äôs still nice not to have to hear that trash our boy.
"Am i the only one that loves this show? Sure his takes are dumb and corny at times, but the show is good."
"This sub hates Cowherd but I‚Äôve always loved him since his Sports Nation days with Michelle Beadle. He may be classic ‚Äúhot take‚Äù guy for the clicks and all that, but there‚Äôs no denying he‚Äôs pretty hilarious and knows sports pretty damn well."
Lamar's getting hate for that game? I haven't seen it. I think he actually played a pretty excellent game. The rest of the team let him down.
I like Colin his analogies on stuff are usually really good and interesting. Plus Joy being there is great they work together very well
Lol it‚Äôs funny that people suddenly think Cowherd has solid takes when he happens to support their QB.

"They don‚Äôt leave, we thought they would last January, they didn‚Äôt"
It‚Äôs trolling ya got got
">I had a party this afternoon and now we're embarrassed IN FRONT OF COMPANY

I know its trolls but the thought of someone hosting a watch party and being this mortified when their team loses and ruins the party is really cracking me up."
Fucking 6-3 team is an embarrassment? Lmao Skura  and Hollywood are the only 2 that should be feeling some way today
"I've stuck with the O's all these years, why would I bail on a football team that's had only 4 losing seasons in 20 years? I get being frustrated at losing what was arguably a winnable game, but get some perspective."
Been around since 02 and 03 we're not a championship team this year but I'll still ride.
The only part of the game that made me feel like crying was when boyle got hurt and thats only because hes a great guy and a great player and I hate to see him or any player get hurt

Dudes a troll.  Let‚Äôs just get this removed.
Bitch move from a pats fan. But idk why people always downvote me when I say this dude‚Äôs a liability on the field.
"I don't know how exactly effective it is because I literally only see the Steelers do it so frequently. But they've done it a lot and it seems to get them yardage enough. 

Plus it'd be a great way to incorporate players like Brown and Duvernay with their speed. Just dump it off to them and let them zoom out of there. 

Thoughts?"
"There's a lot of route concepts we can use that would maximize our receivers potentials and help out OLine.. we just don't.. because they weren't incorporated into our offense by the OC.

Bubble screens, RB Screens, quick crossers right behind the line, naked bootlegs to the weak side, actually getting the ball to a receiver on an end around,  we can be doing a ton to get receivers in space.. the problem is our route trees are bad, they are basic, and they are easily defended.

Teams with good receivers and good passing offenses don't just rely on their receivers beating coverages. They scheme them open with rubs and crossing routes and attacking multiple levels of the defense.. creating mismatches or missed assignments.

We don't really do any of that regularly and our fan base seems to think it's normal.. but you take any top receiver in the league right now and plug them in the equivalent spot on our offense and they struggle just as badly.."
"We try those sometimes with Brown. My issue with Brown on those, or any time he catches the ball actually, is he‚Äôs always looking to juke or something dumb, he never just turns it on and breaks up field"
We don‚Äôt really get anyone open and no one aside from Snead and Andrews occasionally can seem to catch when contested.  They just have better Receivers and scheme them better
"Lamar will never do something like that, his instinct is to extend the play and extend it some more until he's dropped for a loss or gets a 15 yard gain"
""
"This made me laugh until I saw Gase and Hue. Definitely hurt your argument, but I do agree to a point. I think Harbaugh is a great motivator and leader or men, but needs a good OC and DC"
"Harbaugh will always be as good as his coordinators.  I have always said that.  Don't get me wrong, he is a SB winning head coach, he can get a team onto that track and there are a lot of great coaching minds that can't, but he has to have strong coordinators.  And right now, he just doesn't, he has uneven coordinators capable of putting the best O/D on the field or capable of looking like highschool coaches."
This might be low-key facts
"Not even funny tbh, high key facts.."
"I have always wanted Harbaugh to try calling plays tbh. If he sucks at it whatever, but if he is at all good at it, it would solve a problem that plagued us forever. Like what do we have to lose, he has been around football forever, give it a shot"
LOL.... classic Harbaugh.

It‚Äôs painfully obvious we can‚Äôt develop WRs but I just can‚Äôt understand why. Is it our WR coach or other coaches? Is it our scheme? What is it?
"Been a thing for some time now. I think part of it falls on the loyalty shown by the Ravens organization to underperforming staff. You have to really suck for a long time to be shown the door. So when we get a dud we usually get stuck with him for a long time. 

There could be something in the culture/atmosphere that is not conducive to developing WRs. I don't know what that would be but it's very common for organizations to have very distinct cultures. I've worked places that are amazing at bringing junior staff on board and I've worked places that are truly terrible at it. Failures here are often boil down to senior staff and mid level managers not being effective leaders. Senior management often overlooks this and assumes that underperforming staff all have something wrong with them."
"Tale as old as time man. 

Best WR drafted in team history was torrey smith. Who was a good wr, but it's sad hes our best, given our successful drafts across the board 

Our wr and TE coach (who is our old wr coach) suck so much ass."
I think it‚Äôs because we prioritize elite speed and/or height. Don‚Äôt ever get a prospect that has the potential to be a do it all guy. I like Duvernay and I‚Äôm not gonna give up on brown yet
"I put it mostly on coaching. If Roman leaves/gets fired, I hope the new OC is an external candidate who brings a WR coach with them."
"David Culley is the passing game coordinator and WR coach. That should tell you a lot. Also, we're just not great at drafting WRs."
My turn to ask this question tomm.
This was an issue in the Billick era as well and I feel like Harbaugh has proven himself to be able to get the most out of what he‚Äôs given which makes me think that this is an issue of drafting but that‚Äôs a helluva long time to not be able to get it right even once.
I don't think WRs last long in Baltimore. I think the guy that stayed the longest in Baltimore was Derrick Mason(2005-2010)
"I mean look at Perriman. Maybe he's an outlier but we could be suppressing development through our scheme. To me it looks like a cyclical problem - what I mean by that is we haven't had too many #1 WRs so we've learned to play like we don't have one, and since we play like we don't have one, our WRs never get chances to show their ability. I also think it has a lot to do with run-first OCs."
"Dobbins is great, but we could‚Äôve just drafted mims instead of drafting a rb we refuse to use"
Watching Jefferson on the Vikings and it looks like we missed another
I think the bigger question is why we still try.
""
"K, and then who plays center? Justice Hill?"
"I'm not trying to defend him too much, he played poorly, but his snaps started going awry the week he had his finger split open and then this game was a monsoon.

Even if those two ""excuses"" didn't exist, you can't cut ties w a guy over a couple bad games, especially when there's *no one else to go get*.

Lamar turned the ball over 4 times against PIT and single handedly cost us the game...do you want to cut him too? No, you don't. Grow up, it's a long season."
[deleted]
Who cares
"Don't get me wrong, ima watch my ravens cause truss.. But I'm not optimistic. Primarily the injuries has wrecked us for games to come, but we just don't look in sync like we did last year. 

Although i know we had alot players out and it was the raining almost as if god was against us; we just weren't it. Its confirmed the following for me: 

Our offense schemes are trash and predictable/unorthodox (plz get rid of Roman), we're undisaplined, our offense line is trash, our mary-go-round system of rbs is hurting us, Ingram has lost a step, our receivers are unreliable, and we're not a comeback team.  

Despite all that im impressed we were only 1 score from winning probs due purely due to flashes of superior athletism. Were just not in good shape to compete with front runner teams this year.  Also we lost to a team the jets stomped on.. Im embarrassed. Its gonna be a long rest of the season."
I am getting seriously worried about the amount of scary injuries we have at key players going into next year. Acl tears and other serious tissue injuries are no joke
"Yeah, the loss sort of killed any hope I had for a great year and am just trying to be pleasantly surprised if things go well"
"Agreed. Not only the injuries but I saw this as a game that we should easily win and potentially win by a lot. The Pats are not as good as before so they can‚Äôt score 20 puts a half like with Brady.
The penalties were less than in previous games but seemed to be at really inopportune times. 
The wild snap in the 4 th quarter that led to the 17 yd loss really came at a bad time. Lamar seems to be able to handle the wet and wild snaps up to that point. The ravens were down by 5 then and seemed to be advancing well with just the right amount of time left to score and eat up clock time."

"Josh Allen gets Diggs
Baker gets Odell and Landry
Murray gets Hopkins
Mahomes comes in with weapons just to get even more

Lamar gets a 5‚Äô8 midget"
"Yes he needs help BUT dont slander hollywood like that. Hes talented, just not what we need"
"Chill with the midget reference. 

Despite him being on the shorter side for a WR, he still made the NFL. That's very impressive. 

Yes, he shouldn't be the #1 WR but that's not his fault. 

Lastly, sometimes a coaches job is to scheme around the talent. Sometimes a QB has to make his WR better.

There's flaws to this team and Lamar has some of them. Let's roll with what we got and see what the team can do."
Maybe Roman should stop scheming up goddamn 50/50 balls for him
"Lamar has help, Mark Andrew, Hollywood, Ingram, Dobbins, etc aren't mysteriously bad. We have good offensive weapons. We just aren't using them properly, and part of it is on the offense, part of it is on Lamar, and part of it is on the coaching staff. Everyone has to look into the mirror and make some changes."
"Everyone trashed me and a few others for saying get Ab and was cool with our receiving core coming into the season...

I mean I don‚Äôt want to say I told you guys so but I told you guys so ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"We should try Marquise Brown in the slot. He may not be physical enough to play the outside. He can get into space better that way too. We need to do anything we can to get him in space better. Hell, let‚Äôs put him at punt return. He returned punts in college. I only had this thought because I like the way the Bears utilize Anthony Miller despite their treacherous offense."
"he has the physical characteristics of a slot receiver. I dont think they have the depth at the wr position to replace snead with him. it would be smart to start playing proche, duvernay, or dez at wr more. it sucks because the two best receivers are both slot receivers."
Who plays outside than? Snead lol? Duvernay lol?
Is he tough enough to play there and willing to take a hit?  I don't think so.
"Really wished we kept this dude he's really fulfilled his potential and added a nice skillset to match his size and strength. Would've been a huge help in NE, but glad to see he is doing well elsewhere I guess üòî"
zach sieler also just got a fat extension for the dolphins. i was super high on him but we let him go for the ‚Äúwin now‚Äù mode

Look at it this way. OBJ playing so good he got 2 positions locked down
Orlando out here starting at both tackles
Fluker got taken out late in that game as well

We honestly don‚Äôt really know how Proche and Duve will pan out. I can guarantee you if the Steelers picked up either one of those 2 they would be balling like Claypool is rn. Are we the only franchise that cannot draft and  develop receivers ? Are we cursed or something when it comes to receivers? Even the worst teams in the NFL can develop receivers better than us
We just wanna see Duvernay get more chances
"For starters, Duvernay is pretty good."
Steve Smith? Desean Jackson? TY Hilton?
You're right Julio Jones would be a good addition to this ravens team.
"Well, we seemed to have made it work from 2006-2009 when our top two receivers were both 5'10"" (Mason and Clayton)."

Belee dat. Lots of negativity going around but this man is gonna get us a ring
"Just saw the injury for the first time and it looked nasty. Never saw the injury report but hope it wasn‚Äôt as serious as it looked.
Also the hate against Lamar Jackson and that lost when he played in a monsoon last night is stupid. Even tho I‚Äôm not big on the guy no qb plays well I‚Äôm those conditions, media is just looking for a storyline.
Anyway see y‚Äôall turkey day

Edit: grammar"
"Appreciate you, that weak side just became a hell of a path for TJ to disrupt the play"
To tell you how serious it was - Harbaugh announced Boyle out for the year at the post game press conference.
GTFOH.
Makes no sense to me
"a team we beat just blew out the titans. contrary to popular belief this ravens team is still a solid team. maybe not SB favorites but we are still capable of winning most games

might be tougher with the injuries now but this titans team has shown weaknesses too"
home team. vegas still likes our chances of blowing out teams for some reason. titans really haven‚Äôt looked good either
Good question. Maybe because taylor lewan isn't playing?
"Idk, maybe Tennessee defense isn‚Äôt good."
That‚Äôs shocking.
Titans have looked terrible lately.
Bengals and colts beat the titans and their bears game was an uninspiring win. We ravens fans are focusing on the negatives but we still have a good defensive coordinator and just because 2 players are out doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre going to get torched. And our offense still has potential to pop off if they can just figure it out
"BECAUSE ODDS ARE‚ÄôT ABOUT A TEAMS LIKELIHOOD TO WIN BUT HOW MUCH THE HOUSE HAS TO PAY OUT IF THEY WIN.

Jesus Christ this gets explained so much on here and r/NFL."
""
"Coach Evans joins me to discuss the Ravens defense vs Patriots including:

* Reasons why the run defense continued to fail
* How Coach teaches a lineman to hold their ground vs a double team
* Why both teams should have game planned to stop the run (Spoiler: There was not a #1 receiver in the area code)."

"It was nice, but now we‚Äôre back to our regular scheduled programming lol. Luckily I‚Äôm used to it haha"
It was an outlier. This season is more what we're used to seeing historically from Ravens football.

"Well, good news for you. Cleveland is also 6-3 with a game left against them with a chance to also win the division,  so there are 2 horses in this race for ya"
Most of us have already accepted the reality that is the wild card.
"As a steelers fan, balitimore has to beat the titans and the steelers back to back. Two extremely psychical games, it will have an affect on their play. But if they pull it off it would be incredibly impressive.

the steelers have 3 tough games ahead of us, worst case scenario we go 12 - 4 or 13 - 3

best case is 15 - 1

the packers are great and all but i'd be more worried about the saints or bucs than us."

He's qb1 at this point
"America has decided.

Elite Sleepy Joe is replacing the Darnold."
He's so *Elite*.
PRETTY FLACCO TIME
"If he gets around 200 yards this week, he‚Äôll pass Kerry Collins for 19th all time in passing yards. Go Joe!"

ELITE DRAGONNNNNNN
he did good
"Dude almost won last week.  He puts points on the board, but their defense sucks"
I dint have to guess my phone says its 16:57
For as much as Lamar gets the injury concerns label tagged on him can we label Darnold as injury prone now?

Doesn't really matter during this time. All teams are tough for us right now. Hopefully this will pass.

"We‚Äôre starting to look like Trump supporters, just accept that we lost and move on.

Edit: found the trump supporters"
"I'm not familiar with how much blocking Hurst did when he was in here, but I'd imagine they could fill the Hurst role."
certainly. we will have Dez gain 40 pounds by Sunday and then learn an entirely new skill set. no prob.
I don‚Äôt think either are big enough or good enough blockers to be a more effective TE than someone we get on FA
Dez hasn't caught a pass in 3 years at WR let alone at TE.
no
"Not sure about that, but i feel like they got no choice but to throw Dez out there soon"
"No chance, they don‚Äôt have the weight to throw around in there while blocking. Even Mark Andrews has like 35 pounds on Dez."
If I had to guess they probably sign Wilson to a contract at some point this week and have a few more tryouts for some vets or they bring back one of the TEs they cut from preseason
transition ricard maybe
"Ok, I can sorta see doing it with Boykins, but why in the actual fuck would we try with Dez? He's 31, hasn't played in 3 years, and he's on a 1 year deal. We also have several decent prospects on the practice squad. Hell, we don't even know if he can play at all. 

With Boykins, maybe. He's have to put on a ton of mass. I'd say at least 30 pounds of muscle, which would put him roughly at Kittles size. He miiight be able to do that in the off-season, but I still think it would take a full year or two to make that transition. 

I do think he would make a great TE, I'm just wondering if it's worth the investment. Andrews is still around, we draft TE's probably better than anyone, and we still have Breeland who was projected pretty high until his injury."
No
"No.  Xavier Grimble will be the TE2 next week.  

They may split the roles though, with Grimble doing more of the blocking and dez/boykin running similar routes to Boyle, which was largely outlet passes for Lamar."
We gotta remember that this team never has won without going through adversity.  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.  We'll comeback stronger.  We just have to trust Harbs.
Never forget that we went 10-6 the last time we won the super bowl.
"Besides, we survived worse shit."
"And Lamar had like a 76 percent completion rate and a 99 qb rating in a monsoon. I think we‚Äôre ok, but the last half will be a true test"
I think our defense will be get back to form if it gets healthy.
"Saw someone comment this on a post, but even both superbowl runs we faced adversity


2000: Clear Qb controversy (pretty sure each QB played like 8 games each)


2012: Fired our OC Cam Cameron halfway through the season


While I will agree the loss was very disappointing but as much as we would like to think so, we're not a perfect team and we just have to go week by week. Not gonna win the Superbowl halfway through the season"
"I'm really not too bummed about last game, besides the injuries."
Mostly I am sad that is bringing out the worst in people on this forum. More toxic than I‚Äôve ever seen it before.
Exactly
"The injuries are piling up though. If Calais and Williams and Jimmy can get healthy I think our d will return to form. But unless the coaches change up the offensive scheme, I think the injuries on the o line are insurmountable to win a super bowl with. Also in years past the Ravens have had tremendous veteran leadership to rally around, mainly in Ray Lewis, but also in Marshall Yanda, Ed reed, and to some degree a steadying presence in flacco. This season I haven't seen the type of steady disciplined leadership and focused energy to give me hope that the Ravens can still be a Superbowl contender this season. I see more chaos than steady focus. Don't get me wrong, I'm still hopeful, but I'm just not expecting anything crazy like I was last season"
"I appreciate the optimism but we‚Äôve stalled as an offense against playoff bound opponents.  We can‚Äôt win from behind and we look downright abysmal when we give up the run game.  When we‚Äôre trailing in a game, it seems like G-Ro forgets we‚Äôre run specialists by trade and can still use it to set up a big pass (see: [here](https://www.baltimorebeatdown.com/2020/10/3/21497582/the-ravens-must-stick-to-play-action-and-pre-snap-motion-when-trailing-lamar-jackson-john-harbaugh)).

I used to get so frustrated when we had Flacco and we‚Äôd constantly run play action check downs to Ray Rice. Teams could snuff it out because defenses didn‚Äôt have to worry about Flacco taking off and going 80 yards to the house. Now we have one of the most dynamic qbs in the league and we abandon the play action when we‚Äôre down by a score or two. It‚Äôs baffling why we‚Äôd kneecap ourselves like that. 

Granted, we‚Äôre dealing with major injuries on both sides of the ball this season‚Äînot to mention the retirement of a HOF offensive lineman. Still, Harbs has got to hold the offense accountable for boneheaded illegal formation penalties and play calling.

We have a tough row to hoe until we get past Tennessee and Pittsburgh. And even then, it‚Äôs no cake walk. For now, we‚Äôre reduced to duking it out with the Browns for a wild card spot. 

TLDR: Let Lamar loose."

Good times.
A much better time. I remember this was supposed to be the game of the week and then we just steamrolled them.
Back when everybody was healthy and the offense was firing on all cylinders. I miss Yanda and Stanley ü•∫
"This was shortly after I moved to Houston, went out to a bar to watch thinking it would be somewhat close. Things got real awkward really fast üòÇ"
"Man, where gas the Lamar gone who would pass like this, run like this without regard for opposing defenders ankles, the offense that ran players to spread the field like this, that ran the double pistol.

What have you done Greg Roman?"
#
I remember this day. I watched the game and was excited we won
Unfortunately even though this game was key in us having a shot at a bye at the end of the year it can't be counted as a big or important game because Lamar played well.
"I really don‚Äôt know what to think about this...

Edit: he played 64%,66% and 43% of the snaps over the last 3 games."
He‚Äôs been getting more pressure than anyone else on the team. Just isnt showing up on stat sheet
Ben gets rid of the ball at league high speed so pressure is tough to generate there and against the Pats pass rush was largely negated by their ability to run at will so for 2/3 games I wouldn't put much stock into lack of pass rush stats.
"Again, I‚Äôve said this before. A stat sheet tells half the story. He‚Äôs been getting pressure which helps other players too. 

The Pats game will skew stats for any player as we were so week on the line. 

The ‚Äústats‚Äù would likely be much better for him if we had a fully healthy line through those 3 weeks."
"He's also done the job that Smith did for Judon, Ngakoue is bringing the heat but also drawing the focus for Judon and Mcphee on the other side"
He's in the pocket it feels like every other play so that's been a upgrade for sure. His speed move is killer. The next step is getting his hands on the QB every down
"Yeah, he's popping on film.  I'm not worried about it."
"He's been applying an enormous amount of pressure so far despite only being here for 3 games. Considering how complex our defense is, I'm not too worried about it so far."
How many pass rush situations were there in the Pats game? Not many
"And I'll say this in case anyone else reads this:


The Ravens have always known that Ngakoue isn't a run stopper. His go-to move, the chop into a jump and rip inside, is the biggest piece of evidence of this. He gives up contain to work his man and rush inside. Anybody who has watched any film on him knows this, and I guarantee the coaching staff knows.


Would some sacks be nice? Yeah. But Ben has the quickest snap to throw time in the league, Indy has a pretty great O-line, and it was shitty field conditions last week. Give him some time"
Yannick Ngakoue and this entire sub has combined for 3 tackles in 3 games and 0 sacks since Yannick has been traded from Minnesota

"1) why does it matter
2) we‚Äôre relevant"
"I mean, I don‚Äôt really care about these things. We haven‚Äôt done the best job lately at earning respect even if we have injuries. Plenty of other teams have injuries. We have to let our play do the talking. People are gonna say what they‚Äôre gonna say."
"Every post like this just shows the demographic of this fan base now. These are daily posts. 

It‚Äôs always been this way. Always. And just like years passed, we ignore it and prove people wrong."
"Bashing the ravens/ comparing Murray to Lamar is getting a lot of press right now.  There were a lot of expectations for this team.

If I see one more article that says Murray is who we thought Lamar Jackson was I'm going to go crazy.

Jackson won the MVP with Willie Snead as his #1 WR.  Murray has Hopkins...lets not pretend that doesn't matter."
Ryan Clark makes my ears bleed
I fucking hate ESPN
Its always been like this other than maybe last season.
Definitely biased. I watch them everyday and the narrative gets worse and worse
They can stay hating - Maybe roman will get some negative press ü§°
"The media has been doing this to the Ravens for years, including our 2012 super bowl run. Last year was the outlier and we had to be literally one of the best football teams in the past 30 years to earn respect.

Don't watch talking sports heads. They are clueless (mostly) and want attention, eyeballs, clicks. They are not serious people (mostly)"
"Lamar can be polarizing, more people will tune in for a hot button issue"
ESPN is literally a reaction channel.
"Crushing that Boyle went down, hopefully he can make a full recovery, football aside. We‚Äôre pretty TE reliant, do we have any other tight ends coming up the depth chart or on our radar to sign?"
They worked out LukeWilson
Delanie walker available. Don‚Äôt know why we wouldn‚Äôt sign him
"They signed Willson to the psquad. Grimble has a little bit of experience, likely they just roll with some combo of the 2."
"We have Culkin and Grimble on the practice squad, it is far likely one or both of them make the active roster before any other outcome"
I saw a rumor from Zrebiec that we were in talks with Ed Dickson
Jeremy Shockey
Maybe we go after a veteran like Dallas Clark?
Ravens have been linked to Antonio Gates. Lorenzo Neal played with the Chargers at the same time as Gates and Neal went on to play with the Ravens
""
Let's feed Gus early and often and see how it plays out.  I'd love to commit to a single RB as the workhorse guy and get him 15-20 carries.
That Titans lost gave me depression I‚Äôm not gonna lie.we have to win for our playoff place This is revenge game.
"For sure. Titans got hit at the right time. There‚Äôs certainly an advantage to that. 

But we have continuous issues week after week. It‚Äôs week 11 now and and I‚Äôm having doubts these get sorted. Even more so with the injuries piling up. If it were just a slump, I wouldn‚Äôt be worried. But it‚Äôs clear it isn‚Äôt."
Agree but we still have to win enough games to get into the playoffs üò¨
We can't get the 7th seed because that means we'll face the Chiefs and I do not have confidence facing them in the *playoffs*
Historically we have kinda limped into the playoffs when we do win. Sounds cliche but those teams were dogs. Idk if this team has that same grit. Who‚Äôs our tough guy now? McPhee? Maybe Peters on defense. Yanda last year on the offense but who this year? This ain‚Äôt it chief. Unless they change their mentality soon it feels like another one and doner to me
"Cursed image. 

I want to beat Tennessee so bad, and I think back to the documentary about the 1970 Baltimore Colts Super Bowl team who lost to the Jets in the 68 Super Bowl in the greatest upset in super bowl History, and when they played them two years later the Colts players talked about how ‚Äúwe knew and they knew we were gonna kick their ass‚Äù 

I hope the Ravens are bringing that same energy this week, because the loss to the Titans last year was the greatest upset in playoff history.

You had an MVP quarterback, a Top 4 defense, the most rushing yards in the history of football and you lose by 16 points at home. We HAVE to be out for blood this week."
I'VE BEEN SAYING THIS ALL YEAR
Unfortunately it's possible to be shit in the regular season AND in the playoffs.
"I agree. It‚Äôs better to get some problems out of the way now than have it bother us in the playoffs. Clean up the illegal formation penalties, stop over pursuing in the backfield going for big hits instead of getting the sack, play calling, etc..."
Revenge isa com'in and my god is it hungry
STUNT. ON. THESE. HOES.
We are not able to beat a 3 and 6 team what makes you think we're going to play any better in the play offs?.
Do you think GREG ROMAN is going to get hot later in the season? Dudes a clown. We go 10-6 at best
LJ is up to it.
Me too. I am hoping for the reverse of last season.
"Team needs a leader to rally the troops. Ray Lewis was the perfect leader, Ed Reed was that leader too.

Dez at TE lmaoo we‚Äôre fucking depleted
Damn we need Dez in our passing game is awful. I know he‚Äôs not proven to do anything in years but we may as well give him some snaps or it‚Äôs pointless even signing him
"Yes let us play these 4 people out of position for the rest of the season, that is certainly preferable to simply signing an actual professional TE"
Ricard already is at TE
"If we ‚Äúneed‚Äù Dez and Miles to perform, we‚Äôre totally fucked."
Why would Gus move to fallback ? How would that help?
"Most teams already have one TE they mostly use, we were in the minority with the heavy amount of snaps we gave to two TEs. We will miss out on Boyles run blocking but overall it shouldn‚Äôt effect the offense other than mandrews getting more snaps, which might honestly be a better thing for the pass game."

Stranger things has happened. I think we have a shot but may need to score a shit load of points. Henry will average close to 10 yards a carry

"They played like shit against the Colts so that gives me confidence. If they continue to suck on special teams then that might be our advantage since Harbaugh is a ST God

"is calais and b will out? if so then henry is gonna run for 150+ on us. either way, watching queen try to tackle him is gonna be rough."
We couldn't stop the run last year and will Calais and Bwill out I doubt we're stopping Derrick henry this year our only chance is to outscore them.. Which hasn't been easy for us this year. I think this is a tough game
"Injuries, offensive scheme & playcalling. Lamar wanting a big play on every series instead of taking what the defense gives him and working his way down the field. 17-16 Titans."
"We're not playing our best football but the titans squad has plenty of injuries and issues that they are working out too. We aren't the team that went 14-2 this year but they also aren't the team that came into Foxborough and Baltimore last year and manhandled 2 superbowl contenders.

Comes down to Harbaugh vs. Vrabel - who gets more out of his beat up squad"

Ever since Harbaugh hurt the official‚Äôs feelings yelling at him earlier this season we have been good for about 10 flags/100yds a game.
Have there been any offensive holding calls against our opponents?
PI calls are drawn a lot of the time.  Our receivers don‚Äôt have the ability to draw PI.
"They are trying to make sure the Ravens lose. Someone has to be last I get it, but some of the calls last game and the DPI in the Steelers game were blatant secure the win calls"
"I need to check if we have Brad Allen for anymore games this year so I know to not watch. That guy fucking sucks.

The antithesis of Brad Allen is Jerome Boger. Boger is great"
"My dad is constantly telling JUST THROW IT DEEP AND TRY FOR A DPI anytime the offense starts to stall and can't get anything going. We have such a lack of threat out side that the CB's are literally realizing it's not worth it, just let Hollywood keep tweeting and running his dog shit routes and they can relax.."
Don't need to cheat when the WRs aren't good
We don't have receivers worth interfering with.
"I would say that few PI calls favors the Ravens. Humphries plays physical as hell and is a great shutdown defender. If they call a game touchy both ways, the Ravens would have more PI calls than their opponents."

He checked it down and got 17 yards. That‚Äôs a tough throw in those conditions. Take the yards
I think you severely underestimate the closing speed of defensive backs when the ball has to travel that far in the air.
Would‚Äôve been a 50 yard pass between two DB‚Äôs in a monsoon. Probably wasn‚Äôt too confident in throwing anything more than 10-15 yards and especially not early on before he saw how the weather was effecting the ball.
You can pick many plays from every QB in the league with stuff like this every week and besides DB will just close in.
What in the ‚ÄúMadden‚Äù are you saying? If i understand correctly he got 17 yards off that check down. The DB on the bottom of your screen is also beginning to turn his hips to go back. You now have 3 DBs running within ~3 yards of Hollywood by the time a soaking wet ball gets launched 45 yards down field? I would question his decision making almost immediately.
You can‚Äôt use still images for this type or reasoning. It doesn‚Äôt show the whole story.
"Yeah I saw that when they initially showed it. Thought brown was open. It seemed like Lamar saw it, but I don‚Äôt know if we was confident enough to try it."
"He's clearly double covered with the safety inside and the corner outside, both following him step for step. That throw is a guaranteed pick"
"This was one of the first plays of the game, Lamar went through all his reads and took a checkdown. Him taking a few checkdowns this game is already a good sign and shows improvement from before where he never looked at the backs in the passing game. But he needs to work on seeing stuff like this, thats a TD if he puts the ball around where the ref is."
I mean damn it's raining so hard I can barely see it in this picture.

Play like a Raven and win the Superbowl
Make that two tight ends again with Luke Wilson.   In all honesty we just roll with what we have.  Give Lamar quick passes and maybe run more spread.  It sucks that we've lost so much but the defense is still elite and we have a reasonable schedule to end the year.  Hopefully a wr not named Snead can step up even just a little to take pressure off Lamar.
"Get healthy, sneak into the Playoffs and see what happens. Not aimed at you at all OP but the fans need to stop crying."
"We need to reenforce our Oline in the draft. I keep hearing about Creed Humphrey. He seems like a stud. Priority on offense should be Center, WR, and TE in the draft."
"I still hold that the OL last year wasn‚Äôt as good as it looked on paper. Lamar made a lot of mistakes not costly, or even turned them positive. The lack of tape on the team made the whole package more effective. Small wrinkles hid more than they do when teams have months to review and try to emulate or take bits. 

It‚Äôs catching up now, and injuries make it worse."
Blame coordinators rinse and repeat
"Draft heavily at OL, WR, and Edge. 

We've seen Ozzie attack a weak position group in the draft before. DeCosta can do the same."
Fire Greg Roman apparently.
Defense is better then last years as is Special Teams so hopefully that can compensate for the obvious drop in the offenses quality.
"Ignore the talking heads when they criticize Lamar because he's not playing with an acceptable caliber of talent on offense, hope for the best and trade for proven talent in the offseason because we still can't draft and develop WRs worth a shit."
This is the same reason why they are just activating Dez back and forth
"Ugh, so frustrating."
"Not sure it was forced so much as next man up.

They lost Dorsey and Bonds, need ST/DB help. Tramon Williams isn't the guy you want gunning on the punt team or trying to bang on a pulling guard. Stone could be."
"It‚Äôs annoying when you‚Äôre a fan with purple colored glasses on, and you ignore issues at hand and pretend that everything is fine. Pretending that we‚Äôre the exact same team as last year, the pass blocking isn‚Äôt bad and our young receiving corps is developed ect. 

With that being said, this sub has been infiltrated with loads of doomers who act like the seasons already over. Suggestions that we got no realistic shot in the playoffs, we‚Äôll almost certainly be one and done again, even fans who said we won‚Äôt make the playoffs at all! 

Where is the faith in the reigning coach of the year and unanimous MVP? We‚Äôre 6-3 with a top 5 defense, with a strong rushing attack and Lamar having another solid season as a passer. 

THAT is the kind of football that wins in January.

I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre going to the Super Bowl. There is too much that can happen between now and February that could change a teams trajectory, what I‚Äôm saying is that we‚Äôre in a position to make a run this year, a position that a lot of teams would love to be in despite all of our flaws."
"We need our people back on defense, and we need an offense modified for the loss of Stanley.

Its still early as fuck, theres no doubt in my mind we can be extremely dangerous if we get our shit together. But these gut punch, error filled losses need to stop immediately."
"Ya it's definitely too early to predict playoff outcomes. I'm confident we'll make it as a wildcard, who knows what we, and others, will look like then.

But this team is showing heart, every week it's a different issue.. turnovers, penalties (issue every week), bad snaps, bad play calling..but they still fight their asses off. Nobody has quit.

We steamrolled into the playoffs last year, even knocking the Steelers out of contention with RG3 and the 3rd stringers..look what happened to us. We played sloppy as all fuck heading into the 2012 playoffs..look what happened.

We just gotta keep winning, pray for good health and hope the team brings its A game when it really matters.

Fuck. The. Steelers."
"Yeah, Harbaugh absolutely can and will right the ship and turn this team around. The doom and gloom comes from the fact that last year, most newer Ravens fans felt like we had the championship locked up before we got absolutely BTFO'ed by Derrick Henry. The logic is that if we can't beat Damien Harris the season is basically over since we can't stop any running team.

Here's why it's wrong. We didn't have BWill or Calais Campbell, our 2 best run defenders, and we dealt with injuries all night. The Patriots always give AFC North teams specifically trouble and they probably won't make the playoffs anyway. Our schedule lightens up for the rest of the season and we should make the playoffs if we just play average. 

What we need to improve is our offense. Our defense has been great all year except for the Chiefs game (hey, it's the Chiefs) and the Patriots. Our offense has been straight up not good. We need to get back to our roots as a run first team and we need to scheme Andrews/Hollywood/Snead open instead of just running what we've been running. We also have to use Ricard more now that Boyle is hurt."
All I know is that we definitely aren't hitting our stride too early this year
I don‚Äôt want to go 14-2 and lose first round. Ravens have always done best when doubted
"Take away Harris and what did the new England offense actually produce? I've got the think that if Campbell we're in, Harris would not have broken to the edge as much as he did. We played a desperate Belichick, at home, in a monsoon... I'm surprised the game was as clean as it was. We have our challenges this year, sure, but I'm personally happy with the growth in Lamar."
"Most of the doom and gloomers tend to be fans who really know a lot about football, how it is supposed to work, and the nuts and bolts of why it isn't. And the nature of football is that there tends to be a lot of anger when it isn't working right, I think it's because there are so few games compared to other sports. It increases the intensity.

They lose sight, though that we're a little over halfway through the season (with no preseason as well). There's a lot that's gone wrong, but there's time to fix it and get together. It's better to be without Campbell and Williams now rather than at the end. An offense is a lot of moving parts, especially the line, and they need to work things out. Harbaugh teams generally get better as the season goes on, and that's what you want to see. It's not over.

"Blind faith doesn‚Äôt win games, proper analysis of your strengths & weaknesses does. 

Part of being a fan means acknowledging there‚Äôs areas that need work, no team is perfect. It‚Äôs too early to tell what‚Äôll happen, I don‚Äôt think the season is over. But acknowledging how many injuries we have doesn‚Äôt make you a ‚Äúdoomer.‚Äù It means you watch the games and aren‚Äôt clueless. There‚Äôs some fans here who tbh aren‚Äôt capable of handling anything remotely negative about the Ravens- that‚Äôs not on the fanbase, that‚Äôs on you. I‚Äôm getting sick of the loyalty police on this sub- we‚Äôre all ravens fans here. Talking about the season is literally what this sub is for."
Football is a game that is won by getting hot at the right time. We sure as shit looked terrible at times before our last playoff run then caught fire it can definitely happen again hopefully this bad loss leads to actual change in the offense but I have seen Harbaugh do it before and we got the personnel to do it
There is a reason we don't see more undefeated seasons.  Losing humbles and provides coachable moments.  Trust in our players and coaches.
"I think theres a few different types of doomers here

1. Overly invested ravens fans who hedge their bets and say""we won't even make the payoffs"" in order to curb their expectations and possible disappointment. These people invest too much into football and are extremely reactionary. 
2. Bandwagon fans. When the team isn't setting records and looking like the best team in the league, they're unhappy. 
3. New fans. Young people who have been watching football for a year or two and have been drawn to the ravens success last year. They have very little perspective."
">Lamar having another solid season as a passer

Sorry, but fucking LOL. If lamar was having a ""solid passing"" season we would be better than 6-3. Lamar's limitations as a passer is why we have 2 losses."

How much?
How much for the Lamar in a case
"6 ' 1 - 6 ' 3 height range

How hard is this lol"
"This is the type of evaluation that's lead us to such bad receivers over the years--oh you tall? Come be a Raven; oh you fast? We'll take you with a 1st round pick...

No, how about we find some real talent instead of physical attributes."
"Breshad Perriman: 6'2


I rest my case."
A WR's job on a passing play is to 1) run the right route 2) get open and 3) catch the pass or 4) block for the guy who caught the pass.  The Ravens have struggled with guys who are not good at 1 or 2 for most of the team's history.  Guys who can block have been easier to find than guys who can reliably catch
Well if it were that easy we would have a few.

This is cool as fuck. Never heard about this.
"Our defense is amazing when healthy. However, we've been spoiled on offense by Lamar. Let's not forget we are the Ravens and have built our franchise reputation with our brand of defense. We've won a title with Dilfer at QB and have won both rings as a wild card team. I'm comfortable with where we're at. Doesnt mean we can't improve internally in areas but I have faith we can. Let teams underestimate us because that's when the Raven historically shine. We just need to peak and stay disciplined at the right time because at our best we can beat any team any given Sunday. I think we peaked too early or got too cocky going into the playoffs last year. This year is different. Sorry for the rant but some fans need to be reminded of what Ravens football is.

Edit: Absolutely nothing wrong with criticizing our team and pointing out weaknesses but some fans have been complete doomers and probably bandwagoners. For example, yes Skura had a bad game but fans threatening his family is unacceptable and not the fanbase we are at our core"
"Didn‚Äôt both of the SB wins come through the wildcard route?  

I‚Äôm frustrated with some of these losses but I‚Äôll easily get over it with a sb ring.  Last year was a great run but didn‚Äôt finish like we wanted"
"This is a normal Ravens season, last year was the weird one. If this season happened last year everyone would be very optimistic and saying how good of a season it is.  We set some incredibly high standards in 2019"
"We won‚Äôt win anything until we get proper leadership. Not saying it‚Äôs 100% his fault but Harbaugh has won a grand total of 1 playoff game since that Super Bowl. We can‚Äôt play from behind and the second we face any type of adversity, the team falls apart."
"I get what you‚Äôre saying 

But both super bowl teams and defenses had 1000% more heart than this team does. 

Sorry but we seem deflated and all over place. Patriots have had their share of injuries and embarrassed us on national television after barely skating by the jets. 

The one thing we have going for is youth and this team will be in contention for years to come but I‚Äôm not holding my breath for a deep playoff run this year"
"I‚Äôve said it before, but we were spoiled last year. We aren‚Äôt used to having a team that breaks NFL records. We‚Äôre not used to having a team that doesn‚Äôt have to struggle. That‚Äôs what we had last year. Last year was special, but we‚Äôve come to expect that. And that expectation might not be realistic."
People keep forgetting we are 6-3
A lot of us have lost the Truzz we once had. And I am big enough to admit that there have been points throughout this season where I have questioned my own Truzz levels. But never will I say the season is over.. never will I say I enjoy to watch the Steelers play. One good game and all of our Truzz will come back to us.
"I think its not just that we're losing, its that we have a bunch of young talent, and fans don't want to waste it. I think it was easier to accept losing without a lot of talent and stuff but now that we have the MVP we're just impatient and don't want to waste away his career."
"Our line is decimated by injuries and Lamar has not looked very good at all really this year. Our defense is decimated by injuries. If we were just playing poorly then sure but the mounting injuries are really concerning and regardless of the cliches like ""next man up"" injuries can and do bring down a team. Theres a reason the bench guys are on the bench."
"I understand what happened last year. but the offense moved the ball most of the night. they turned it over 3 times, didn‚Äôt convert 4th downs 3 or 4 times, gave the titans great field position all night, settled for 2 FGs, etc. if big baby and calais are out, is henry gonna run through the defense again. sure. probably. but if the ravens don‚Äôt give the titans great field position damn near everytime they touch the ball, it‚Äôs an extremely winnable game. 

my dad is a titans fan, so i have watched most of the games. tennessee‚Äôs defense is a train wreck. they get no pressure, they can‚Äôt cover anything, and they have their share of injuries and guys not producing at the level they should. they do an ok job at stopping the run, but we saw what the colts did to them. and that‚Äôs with phillip rivers at QB. 

am i saying the ravens are going to win by 20 points? no. but the ravens are a team that is being written off by just about everyone, and they think just cuz that playoff game happened 8 months ago the titans are gonna waltz back into the bank and do it all over again. realistically the ravens could have scored a lot more than 12 points in that playoff game. i think the ravens are going to turn a lot of heads this week, and it‚Äôll be with the offense this time. the defense won‚Äôt be able to save anyone from henry, but they will be able to bend without breaking.

tldr - have a little faith. the ravens are better than, well, we, and everyone else thinks."
When you set your expectations low enough you can't be disappointed anymore and if you're wrong it's a happy surprise
"No Brandon Williams or Campbell. Not confident at all that D can stop them from scoring and Henry from running for 9 yards a clip. And I‚Äôd be fine with that, but that means Greg Roman is gonna call a bunch of stupid shit on 3rd and 4th down to turn the ball over and give points away.

The only way I see this game not collapsing fast is if they can score first and keep a lead and not have to worry about playing catchup. If I‚Äôm the Ravens and I win the coin toss I‚Äôm starting with the ball."
We‚Äôre missing a lot of guys
"Bwill is out and Calais probably will be too. We got calais for one reason and he happens to be out when we needed him most lol. Derrick Henry is going stomp on us. Plus the titans had 10 days to prepare for us. 

I still have faith this team can pull a surprise and beat them but the prospects don't look great."
"We are our record so tough to be confident. But no real reason to think we can‚Äôt win, unless we can‚Äôt plug up the middle of the D line."
If Queen and Harrison play the run like they did on SNF we could be in trouble. Hoping Fort is back this week.
We just lost to a 2 win team.
"I understand that January was ugly, but why is everyone acting like this dude is impossible to defend?? We played him twice before (2017: L 20-23, 2018: W, 21-0) and he didn't make much noise in either game at all.

We've played well against him twice."
Pats just dominated our defense and the tits offense is 20 times better. Also our offense was ok i guess but Roman still has some questionable playcalling and it‚Äôs getting to the point where Lamar is just dragging us along with no help from anyone else.
If Williams and Campbell are both out we will not be able to slow down Derrick Henry. So far the offense has not proven they can pick up the slack if the defense falters so it's pretty simple math. I think they should be favored in the game by a few points to be honest but that doesn't mean we can't win.
I mean yeah... but also we just lost to the Pats who are quantifiably worse than the Titans in almost every measure but kicker
It‚Äôs a different year w loads of injuries. Derrick Henry could rush for 300 yards
"‚ÄúStyles make fights‚Äù and the Titans are a bad matchup for us. Theyre a well coached power-running team with extended prep time and we‚Äôre down our two best run-stoppers.

Cluster injuries have left us thin on both sides of the trenches. 

Add in the fact that our offense has an identity crisis and our most productive WR would be ‚Äúwho? Ohhh that‚Äôs right.‚Äù WR3 in most other offenses and you can see why some people are not lining up to bet the Ravens this week.

Last weeks game isn‚Äôt indicative of what this teams capable of but the fact is we are really banged up."
"Because Williams and Campbell are the foundation of our run defense. It's true, you can contain Henry if the big guys are the ones putting hands on him instead of DBs, but I just don't see how really doing it without one of those two guys playing. Especially with how iffy the playcalling has been. I'm optimistic though, but I'm not gonna set my expectations super high"
"This is our ""mom's spaghetti"" game."
"The main reason is because theres a very high chance we could be without Big Baby and Calais, and if that is the case, Henry will run for 200+. Don't get me wrong I have confidence in Lamar, Wink, Harbs, but that 22 is a baaaaaad man. If we can't stop him the game could be a lot like the Pats game."
"Generally how it tends to go is that we trade Ws and Ls against one another. If history holds, we'll win. But yeah....I'm not feeling good about it either."
If B.Will and Campbell were at 100% or even 70% I would feel better.
"The Titans have the 30th run defense and Henry only shows up to half the games anyway.

It‚Äôs a very winnable game if you god damn negative Nancy‚Äôs fuck off."
"We will be so fixated on stopping Henry, AJ Brown is going to have a monster game."
"This is Ravens football, an anxiety filled season. Even though everyone and everything is pitted against us, I have a feeling Lamar is about to take off and show his MVP caliber self to end the season. Let‚Äôs keep the morale"
"Tbh, I hope we do get a wildcard(which probably will happen), and are back to being one of those underdog teams that ""no one wants to face in the playoffs"""
"We can make a run with a wildcard spot. These next two games are extremely important. At this point we just need to win more games than the Browns or maybe the Steelers lose to Us, the colts and bills. This season is very interesting"
"I agree, nice username by the way üòÇ"
I just hope to make the playoffs as a wild card and win one game. I'll be more than happy with that with all the big injuries we're dealing with. Also we have to beat the Steelers. Then I'll be truly satisfied.

Matt Skura has had his snapping issues along with mobility issues (still struggling to get to the second level). Tyre Phillips is on short term IR and may return within the next few weeks. DJ Fluker was pulled after getting beat like a drum. This shifted Patrick Mekari to RT and Ben Powers to RG.
I for one am excited to see Powers get a shot if this is the offensive line that rolls out on Sunday. What say you Ravens fans, who do you think the best starting 5 would be at this point?"
"Per Harbaugh today Mekari has been taking reps at center and Skura was being plugged in for where Phillips would be when he is healthy and where Fluker would be in different reps, this will continue for the week until they have a better idea of the health of the line, So there is a healthy competition for the center job this week but I feel like Skura keeps it come game day on a short leash"
"Brown Jr/Bozeman/Mekari/Powers/Phillips

Obviously the least experienced combination but I think Skuras play is still suffering from tearing up his knee and Mekari is kind of an awkward fit at RT."
I think Skura would be decent for us if he didn‚Äôt have to snap the ball... considering our Oline health. Hopefully he can fill in well for Tyree and give us some options

My favorite game of last season by far
"Was at that game. It was so amazing, by the second half it was nearly all ravens fans"
"Bro I was there too! Sat right on the fifty 6 rows from the front, monster ass game"
"Is it likely? No. Will it be easy? No.  Is it possible? Definitely.

Edit: In this thread, people don't understand what ""kinda"" means.

Second edit: Jesus Christ you guys need to fucking relax. It's just football. It was a joke. ""Haha their Thanksgiving is roo-eened.""

"Wtf is all of this rooting for the Steelers bullshit lately? 

No. Fuck that. I hope they lose every single game now and forever more. Amen."
"Heck nah.  If they lose, and lose to us next week, and we win vs Titans and them...we back in it for the division."
"The fuck is happening to Ravens fans. The Steelers winning hurts the Ravens directly. 


I get it if we were an 2-8 team and had no chance to compete, and wanted to play spoiler for an undefeated Steelers. You should hope the Steelers lose every game going forward until the division is clinched."
I‚Äôd think as ravens fans we‚Äôd root for them to go 0-16 every year
Fuck the Steelers and fuck you. Can we start voting people out who post dumb shit like this??
"I was thinking about it too and I kinda hope they go 19-0 this year to win the Super Bowl. Then they go 19-0 the following year to win another Super Bowl. Ben rides off into the sunset after the win on a motorcycle, followed by his harem of women, and he hands the keys to the Team to legendary Steeler Mason Rudolph.

While I am at it, I think I‚Äôll also marry my cousin, drown all of my food in fucking Heinz ketchup, and jam a q-tip too far in my ear to lower my intelligence a bit, so I fit in with my new Steelers friends. 

Fuck the Steelers."
No
"Do not, I repeat DO NOT vote for Ngakoue to make the probowl. There is a stipulation in his contract that gives him a bonus from the Jags and their trade with Minnesota that gives Jacksonville a higher pick from Minnesota which then in turn bumps our 5th round pick next year to a 4th round"

"Offense podcast with Clifton Brown of the Ravens, including:

* OL scoring for a reconfigured line
* Why Fluker was benched at halftime
* How may the Ravens move forward in terms of the OL by position?
* How can the Ravens offense function without Nick Boyle?"

Really what are the alternatives out here it‚Äôs fine
"Likeable personality. Is a decent blocker and catcher, but not a game changer. Solid signing given our current situation."
"He's a warm body who has played TE in the NFL before so that's ok, I guess?  At this point, it's not good when you're bringing a guy from his couch onto your roster but it is what it is."
I like that he‚Äôs mastered [the art of chill](https://twitter.com/NFL_DovKleiman/status/1328805925126352897?s=20)

EDIT: Boyle, not Boykin."
"We need someone, anyone LOL. I‚Äôm OK with it."
Is Delanie Walker healthy?
https://i.imgur.com/PppdzrD.png
"He can block and he can catch.  We need a TE that can block and catch.  Everything checks out.  

One of the biggest issues I think we are having this year is moving to 2/3 wide sets and dumping the 3 TE sets from last year.  Our offense has suffered a bit because of it.  Now we lose Boyle for the year.  This offense is just not built to run without TEs that can also block.  Options are pretty limited out there at the moment.  Outside of a trade, Wilson is the next best option."
"I never really watched him much either. But, looking at his stats and some articles from the past three or so years he seems solid. Decent hands, from what I read he's a good blocker too. He's definitely not Nick but considering the position we're in it seems like a good pickup"
I like that he‚Äôs Canadian üòÇ
"I liked him on hard knocks, other than that id have no clue who he was."
He's from my hometown so I think it'd be cool if he played for my favourite team.
WoW
He could be used for blocking along with andrews and Richard
Can he block?
Owen is going to be so jealous
"Raven's fan in Seahawk territory here

Wilson is a decent tight end and was doing fine on the Seahawks but I think they were more focused on using wide outs and trying to bolster defense so they cut him.

Frankly with our lack of depth at the tight end spot I think it's the best option available to us at the moment."
"As a Canadian Ravens fan I have to love the move, it's Canadian law."
"As a Canadian, I approve üëç"
"I feel like he could end up looking like a stud on a team that heavily relies on its TEs, so I'm looking forward to how he plays"
I think it‚Äôs embarrassing that we have to recruit washed up bums to try to fix our offense
I wish we signed Delanie Walker instead

Went to the same college as Lamar too
There's a haircut you can set your watch to.
Notice how this is posted here and not the Colts page.  What a legend.
Lucky duck!
I wonder how much that thing would go for
I have a couple pages of a notebook from the front desk at UM Hospital where I was standing one day waiting to find out what room my girlfriends mother was in and Johnny U walked in. I felt weird even asking him in that setting but I did anyway and he couldn't have been more gracious in singing something for me. So glad I got a chance to meet him and shake his hand. I'm sure those papers are worthless to anyone else but it's definitely a priceless memory for me.
GOAT!
Although Irsaten will probably say he‚Äôs an Indianapolis icon because he‚Äôs a dick
Johnny came to my elementary school a couple months before he passed for career day.  I was so happy that I signed up for sports as a career.  He was one of the nicest guys I have had the pleasure of meeting.  He was supposed to send everyone that attended an autograph but unfortunately he never got the chance to.  I definitely need to get some Johnny U memorabilia.
I jumped on the raven bandwagon when Ray Lewis came back and won us the Super Bowl in ‚Äò13. Who is this dude real quick ?
"Lol.  Before I scrolled further down, I fully expected it to be Bert Jones."
"I remember as a teenager in 1958 watching the NFL Championship game. The greatest game ever played. Johnny U drove the colts 80 yards
In overtime to defeat the New York Football Giants 23-17. In my opinion, perhaps Unitas was the GOAT quarterback."
Cool but wrong franchise
"I honestly think we are mostly okay, had a bad stretch of injuries but hopefully we can get our way out and hit our stride. However, we have some issues, and I just want to cast out into the void what I‚Äôd like to see as a fan next game!

I hope next game we see makeri at center, Ben powers/skura at rg, Bozeman at lg, Orlando at LT, and Phillips at RT until we‚Äôre all healthy again. I also hope we bring up Xavier Grimble just in case anything bad happens to another TE, he‚Äôs okay and has won a Super Bowl. Also, maybe some Boykin at TE and have devin and Hollywood switch off at the 2 with Snead in the one. Bring up dez so he can get some work in when we need big sets, him on Boykin both on the outside with Snead in the slot + mandrews and Luke Wilson in sounds dangerous inside the 10. Overall I hope JK dobbins and Gus edwards get 7+ carries each with Mark Ingram and Jackson only taking 4/5 each.

I think defensively if Brandon Williams is out, we need to bring jihad ward in and have Derek Wolfe play a bigger role, Maybe switching inside with jihad ward a little to help stop Derrick Henry. Hopefully jimmy smith can play, because he seriously is a force in stopping outside runs, especially with deshon Elliot and chuck Clark"
"I like most of what you said. Tyre at RT doesn‚Äôt sound like a good idea to me, though. He couldn‚Äôt handle the RG position so I doubt he‚Äôs be able to handle RT. 

That being said, I‚Äôm not sure what the answer is. Orlando and Bozeman on the left side is the only thing I really have confidence in for the O line. Mekari will definitely play somewhere, but I don‚Äôt know where. 

Outside of those 3, someone out of skura, powers, fluker, and Tyre really needs to step up."
Isn't Tyre on IR?
"> Also, maybe some Boykin at TE 

And while we're at it, let's put Richard in at center."
"Agree here with everything but stop henry, contain is a better word. look at last week they got blown out and he still had 100+ yard game. Keys is to obviously not let him score but you have to a.) Score points your self and limit RT from beating you (which is why we lost last year) 

Offense has to have 2-3 TD on their own and defense has to set up another one"
"I think now is time to try Boykin out at TE, he has good hands and a big body. Can't be worse than WR for him"

This post is dumb as shit

Put Gus back in the starter role.
"It‚Äôs crazy how putting Lamar in lead us to go from 4-5 - essentially season over to 10-6 considering he‚Äôs a rookie, he almost beat Mahomes in his MVP season as a rookie if it weren‚Äôt for some 4th down plays. 

Glad we made the change and have him as our QB even if things aren‚Äôt going well at the moment. He‚Äôs a QB for the future even if we don‚Äôt do much this year"
Its really surprising realizing that Gus Edwards was an UDFA
I can only afford to go to one game a year. I happened to choose this game months beforehand. It was awesome to be there for his first start and seeing the future of the franchise begin.
"This is actually a thing that makes me a little nuts when I see ‚ÄúLamar Jackson rushing per game over his first 40 games.‚Äù 

If you actually just look at his stats since he became the starter and don‚Äôt count games where he came in for two plays, his numbers go from ‚Äúbest ever‚Äù to ‚Äúwhat the actual fuck‚Äù in a lot of categories."
"I really forget that the two eras of Ravens football (IE: Flacco, Brown, Collins) overlapped with Jackson.

Watching Jackson handoff to Alex Collins, throw to Brown, but then also throw to Mandrews is weird."
Its been 2 years and I still can't tell how food Gus is.
"If you told me 2 years ago Gus would still be on our team *and* be remotely productive, i would have called you a little bitch.

But now I'm the little bitch. A very happy little bitch."
"So fun fact, this was actually my first ever ravens game after being a fan for years. I kept putting off driving down until I found someone to go with which never happened so I finally said screw it and got a ticket to go alone on the 30 yard line. That week they announced Lamar's start which had me hyped, got to see a rival game, and when I was in the stadium looking for Poe to get a picture with him I ended up meeting Jacoby Jones instead."
2 years already... shit's crazy!!
You guys think giving Gus 3/9 would be smart?  I wouldn't be opposed to it.  He works really well with Lamar.
And still looking for a playoff win

Fun fact: there is a theory that it actually comes from my hometown Leiden.

"https://www.pff.com/nfl/players/patrick-queen/57941
Meanwhile everyone is calling him potential Defensive rookie of the year"
"He sucked on Sunday but he's a rookie.

Saw him multiple times come forward to stop the run but hit the backs of the DL while the wide open hole is a spot to the side.  Those are the gaps he needs to fill."
"If you were watching any part of last week‚Äôs game you would understand why, dude hasn‚Äôt developed his coverage skills yet and he‚Äôs gettin killed for it"
"I love Queen's potential and athletic ability but people get so enticed by flash plays. Despite his athleticism he gets beat in coverage a ton. Because he's so athletic he is around the ball a ton but misses a lot of tackles.

PFF's grades aren't going to always match the eye test. That's a feature not a bug."
I will never worry about a linebackers development within this organisation. Never.
"He still has a lot to work on, but he will be fine. He didn't even start a full year of college football, and now he's the starting ILB for the Ravens. That's a huge jump."
"I don‚Äôt really get the Queen hate. He has had some rookie struggles in coverage, but he also had a shortened offseason and asking any late 1st rounder to start as a rookie without a full training camp is a big ask. Especially one who didn‚Äôt have a ton of play experience in college. He has shown tons of great flashes, his speed, blitzing, tackling is all solid. Pff only has his score low due to coverage, and pff grades are shit anyways. He will develop in coverage, he will develop at everything, we drafted him because of his insane upside, not where he is now."
"The score is mainly the result of 2-3 very bad games. And part of his bad game last week is understandable given that he didn't have Williams and Campbell in front of him. Even Ray Lewis had trouble when we had issues up front on our D-line, like in 2005."
The elite and experienced coaches seems to know how to exploit P Queen.
"PQ is best rookie LB in my opinion. Other top rated LBs (Kenneth Murray, Jordyn Brooks, Isaiah Simmons and Willie Gay Jr) have been ok, but I think PQ is the best of the bunch. He's not CJ level yet, the young man needs time to develop...he's just turned 21. 

Growing pains are inevitable, but I think he and Malik will grow and develop to be formidable in the next couple years."
"It's so weird. We knew since college that he was a bad tackler, the idea was that he'd be a coverage guy. 

But he sucks at tackling AND covering now! Like whats the point?!"
"He was impossible to watch Sunday night. It's rare to see a linebacker look that bad in real time, but man did he look hopeless. I'm not going to give up on the guy anytime soon, but I maintain that Malik Harrison is the inside stalwart that this defense will be built around over the next few years. I watch Malik and I see a player who's headier, more physical, and much stronger than Queen."
They were showing those PFF rankings and aside from Marlon they were awful for us. Yet we have the lowest points allowed total. Something doesn‚Äôt add up there.
"He's been a huge liability in coverage all season. Tackling has also been awful, and run fits generally poor.

No one with any credibility is considering him for defensive ROY.

All that said, I think the future is bright for him -- he's got raw explosiveness that \*should\* translate into improved play in all facets. But you're crazy if you think he's played ""well"" this season."
I wouldn't worry about it - PFF grades for DBs and linebackers are essentially worthless since it's impossible to properly evaluate those positions without knowing their exact responsibilities every play (which Collinsworth's boys definitely don't)
PFF weighs pass coverage very heavily
He hasn't been great this year but as a rookie he's been fine and has a ton of potential. He's super young and will be good if not great in a couple years.
"He‚Äôs young and doesn‚Äôt have much starting experience under his belt, he‚Äôs not a Mosley type player who started in national championships and was pro-ready. He‚Äôs going to be a player with coverage upside even though he‚Äôs struggled coming out of the gate and relies on his speed and instincts"
"""The PFF grading system evaluates every player on every play during a football game. We believe that #EveryPlayCounts and that attention to detail provides insights and data that cannot be found anywhere else. The grading system was founded on the principle of grading ‚Äúproduction‚Äù rather than traits or measurables, but perhaps a better way to describe it is a player‚Äôs ‚Äúcontribution to production‚Äù on a given play.¬†"""
"He's had his struggles and they shouldn't be surprising. I'm not overly worried though. He's 9 games into his rookie season and he doesn't turn 22 till next August. The way some people are talking about him here, you would think he has no chance at improving."
It‚Äôs hard to be a rookie linebacker probably the hardest defensive position to play.  Also he‚Äôs not good at all in coverage and honestly Malik Harrison has been the better rookie LB in this regard.
"He isn‚Äôt very good. Supposed to come in and be a first year starter that has a huge impact, turns out, he‚Äôs below average."
PFF is trash. No one should take them seriously.
"What‚Äôs your personal take on 
Brown, Bozeman , Fluker , Skura, Powers"
Skura was good last year the knee injury has took him back a couple steps bozeman is aight could for sure have someone worse playing guard brown is a stud fluker is a beast in the run game buns in pass pro and I dont know much about powers
"* Brown is easily the best of the bunch. He has done a pretty good job being thrown into the left tackle spot this year.
* Bozeman can be solid; but that is his peak.
* Fluker is done. He's just not good at tackle nor in pass protection. He was fine for the Seahawks at guard and in their run game. However, the Ravens just have too much of a log jam there with all their younger o-linemen.
* Skura is hard to analyze. Is he still not 100% from last year's injury? Will he ever recover to be the same guy he was in 2019? Did he benefit too much from having Yanda next to him? We don't know for sure; but he's probably better suited at guard than center moving forward, especially if that cut/hand injury is still bothering him.
* Powers is too much of a mystery, ATM. However, he has the chance to prove himself on the field if the Ravens elect to start him at guard for the remainder of the season.

The ones you didn't mention (besides Stanley and Bredeson)...

* Mekari is most likely the second best player on the current o-line. He's shown some great versatility, being able to play at guard, center and now (right) tackle. His performance on Sunday at right tackle was the lone bright spot for that unit against the Patriots.
* Phillips remains to be determined. The coaches clearly like him, giving him the starting nod at right ~~tackle~~ guard to begin the season; but he's been one of the worst graded guards according to PFF. It's never easy for a rookie, especially a non-1st or 2nd rounder, to be a starter on the o-line from day one. So, I just hope we see a big improvement from him after the off-season.

**EDIT**: Sorry, I had Mekari still on my mind when I said Phillips got the ""nod at right *tackle* to begin the season""."
"Brown - he's great

Bozeman - he's fine

Mekari - meh

Skura - I'm convinced he's still feeling the effects of last year's injury even if he says he's fine

Fluker - great run-blocker, terrible in pass-pro

Powers, Bredeson - ???"
"Love Bozeman, Brown had some early season struggles in pass pro but he‚Äôs gotten much better and will probably net a market reset, Fluker is a good run blocking tackle but he‚Äôs awful at pass protection, Skura has been awful these past two teams and average to below average before that, and Mekari looks really promising as a RG and would fit the mold of the swing guard we need pretty well."
"The line is so up and down.  I read Ken‚Äôs grading each week and you never know what your gonna get.  Brown was horrible against the pats, but Mekari and Skura (snaps aside) had their best games of the year.

My biggest problem is that we do t have any great run blockers.  Stanley and brown are much better pass blockers and seem mediocre at run blocking.  Skura, Mekari, Phillips, Bozeman are just a mixed bag.

Powers is an after thought despite never playing poorly.  No clue what‚Äôs going on there."
Everyone except Brown is doodoo
We are so fucked
Skura needs to be cut right away he fucking sucks big cock

Shiiiid  hopefully so
I hope as a player he truly thinks this. As a fan who‚Äôs opinion doesn‚Äôt effect how the team plays this is 100% a revenge game

Lmao so far the most talking I've seen is from their side. Franchise highlight for sure for one that hasn't seen too many.

I think I‚Äôm actually the only person who is optimistic on this sub. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised that the people who are upset with being 6-3 didn‚Äôt experience this team during post-superbowl years.

Seeing myself in the video üò¢
My wife swore she'd never attended a game in December after this one...the weather too brutal for her.
We did not properly gage what losing Yanda would do to the team
"This is the game I use as an example of what an actually good defensive battle is. People often conflate bad offenses playing badly as a defensive battle. No, a defensive battle is when the offense can move the ball and score but it's a massive struggle to do so. This game perfectly illustrated it."
"Can we all stop acting like our team fucking died in a plane crash? Jesus Christ! 

We're not what we were last year, but we're still a viable team with a good shot at winning. Look at our O Line, look at our wide receivers, now look at our injuries. 

Everyone quit acting like spoiled Patriots fans. 

Having a QB repeat an MVP year just doesn't happen.

It could be worse, we could be living in Cleveland."
We had a healthy line and defenses that hadn‚Äôt adjusted yet. They have and the Ravens need to adjust back.

"This must be fake, everyone knows lamar doesn't beat good teams"
"I was at that game last year and it was honestly one of the best games that I have ever been to. Watching the ravens beat the top seeded 49ers was such an incredible feeling!! They had so much talent and were flying high coming into that game, but we showed them what it means to play like a Raven, meanwhile Ice rain is coming down the entire time. Hell of a win!!"

Geez. There are lots of bad and mediocre football teams out there. This time, right here in this video and in this sub, ain't one of them. (edit: I'm not saying don't be critical. Just dial down the woe-is-me self-pity bullshit.)"
Yea and we got destroyed in the wild card....
Time to vote for our guys don't forget to show love to our st
"Outside of Humphrey I honestly don't know if I can vote in any other Raven over some other talent out there. Stanley would have been an easy one but of course the injury happened. I guess my other votes will be for Orlando Brown, Chuck Clark, and Campbell."
And don't vote Yannick in this time*
Realistically who deserves to go? No ones been that impressive this year sadly
We need to get behind an edge defender to vote into the PB over Yannick.

"Steeler fans and bengals as well
Lol. Might as well just accept it‚Äôs a 4th at this point lol"
"Does that sorry ass team even have a large enough fanbase to pull that off?

Fuck Jacksonville and fuck our spiteful division rivals."
"I think our offense needs a spark in creativity. Look around the league the teams that have offensively innovative head coaches are looking great. Chiefs, Cardinals, Rams, Packers, Tampa, Dalls(pre Dak). I‚Äôm not talking solely off record I‚Äôm talking about the offense on those teams is making the job of the defense easier. Harbaugh isn‚Äôt an offensive head coach or a defensive head coach he‚Äôs a motivator who is only as good as our coordinators. Greg Roman was great for the first 10-12 games last year and then hasn‚Äôt adjusted since. Our defense throughout the years has been above average to elite. But offensively other than with Roman last year and kubiak in 2014 it‚Äôs been very below average. Caldwell in 12-13 was nice but we also had weapons. I‚Äôm open to some friendly discussion bc watching film on this team offensively is embarrassing and it‚Äôs not as much on Lamar as it is on scheme and lack of talent at WR."
Well I definitely disagree with this take.

Can't read any of that unless you admit you meant to typs OC

"Begone with you, nephew"
If Harbaugh's gone as head coach it would be a huge blow to team morale.
"Tbh, I don't much about him, but I'd be willing to put money that some, maybe even a large part of their success, has to do with the ungodly amount of talent that offense has."
"This sounds like my ""fire Billick, hire Marty Schottenheimer"" take (said only to my friends, not posted anywhere online, sadly) back in 2007 after the playoff loss to the Colts.

It's certainly possible for a very successful head coach to grow stale with his team after a few years (like Andy Reid did in Philly), but anyone thinking we need to replace Harbaugh needs to think very carefully. We're 6-3, not 3-6. We're not Cincinnati, or Cleveland, or the Jets. We've had two truly disastrous seasons in 20 years, and Harbaugh wasn't the coach in either of those seasons. Consistency is an asset for this organization, and if you're going to throw that away it better be for a good reason. Not because the team lost 3 games, two of them really close games, and one to the best damn team in the conference (if not the NFL)."
"Were not going to get rid of harbaugh at this point. Bienemy will go to Houston and get an MVP season out of Watson. We probably need to scour the college coaching ranks for a creative, up and coming coach. Ravens OC should actually be an attractive position for a change."

I'm going around looking for every team's best player in history. Who's yours?
Ray Lewis
Gotta be Ray Lewis!
*What would you give if tomorrow wasn't promised?*
Ray Lewis
Ray Lewis
Ray Lewis is probably the most important in terms of building an identity as well as being an incredible HOFer.  I personally would choose Ed Reed though in terms of who was the best player we had.
"Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Ogden, Tucker, Yanda, Suggs"
Buck Allen
Ed.
Only two players have statues in front of our stadium. Ray Lewis and Johnny U
Ed Reed
"In order: Ray Lewis, Jonathan Ogden, Ed Reed, Marshall Yanda, Justin Tucker, Terrell Suggs"
Johnny Unitas
"There‚Äôs a lot of ravens greats, but none that stand out as much as ray lewis. Undeniably one of the best to ever play the position, but I think more importantly he was consistently for his entire career the spark to the powder keg that was the ravens identity. A leader of men on the field, a field general the coaching staff could put complete faith in, and played with an insatiable hunger and unending drive to be the best and demanded the same of his teammates on both sides of the ball. 

No player in ravens history has managed to have the impact that ray Lewis has had and to a degree continues to have on the entire organization. He defined what it means to ‚Äúplay like a raven.‚Äù Selfless, hard nosed, tough, physical football, putting the team above oneself."
"Ray Lewis, Jon Ogden, Ed reed, justin tucker, Terrell Suggs, Marshall Yanda"
Ray Lewis
"Ed, Ray, and Jonathan Ogden are among the all-time best at their positions so the separation is between them is miniscule.

That said, Ray gets the edge for his role as the General.  He was a legend on the field *and* off the field putting him at the top of the list."
"[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/)

Click on each team and they give you the top 12 players for each franchise.  For the Ravens, it's Ray Lewis, and it's not particularly close."
#The Buck Allen
Ogden
Justin tucker. Not even close
https://youtube.com/watch?v=rgspNvFqRw4
"I also like how Ogden looks out of place due to his height/weight compared to the defenders. But being 6'9"" and 350lbs will do that.

We need to stuff Ellis and Madubuike together into a #98 jersey and try to pass them off as Brandon Williams. The width would be about right anyway.
Fuck
Shit
Pain.
Imma stay sleep üò¥
"You guys should visit our sub, a bunch of our starters are down as well.

The doom and gloom in both of our subs is rather interesting, one of us is gonna finish Sunday in a very bad mood."
Henry is about to set the new rushing yards record against us tomorrow
Danger
"If MP Juiceman can take down Derrick Henry, so can everybody else."
I have a feeling that the defense will rise to the challenge and only give up 175 and 2 tds.
Goddamn it
Understatement
"So now we're on the ""hope Arthur Smith pulls a Roman and refuses to run the ball against an awful run D"" train"
Good thing I have to work today so I don‚Äôt get to see Henry break the single game rushing record against my team. üò™
As much as it sucks they need to heal up back end of the schedule is soft here soon can definitely finish 11-5
This is going to be a major asshole gaping exercise.  I highly suggest ample lube.
"Well, I will take a miracle for this front 7 to stop the run. The only way I see them mitigating this is if the offense can roll and get ahead so much it forces the titans to through more"
Henry for 178...yikes
"Offense just has to finish.  Can‚Äôt fall behind early.  Receivers mishandling passes that they had been tucking away all year is what set us up to have to play from behind last year which is what killed us.  If the O is efficient early today, we‚Äôll be fine.  If not, it will be another long day vs Titans.  Same case as last year."
Key to the game is going to be efficiency on offense imo... Titans are set up to dictate the game of given the ball. Ravens will have to make every possession count.
"Get healthy, Monstars..."
"Literally drafted and spent off-season to not get ""henry'd"" and now there's a high possibility Ravens get fucked up yet again because Injuries. Cool."
"Bright spot, Malik Harrison taking down Henry with one arm and being blocked with the other"
NOT A DARK LORD BUT A QUEEEEENNNN! TERRIBLE AS THE DAWN

How did u do this with 100 passing yards
those player stats don‚Äôt add up who was scoringüòÇ
You allowed 139 yards?  Pathetic.
Fuck the steelers
Lmaoo yo I thought I was the only one that did this üò≠
FUCK THE TITS
OOOO YEA Ready for 5 Pat Ricard TDs. 35-0 ow ow ow
Man I‚Äôm ready but the PTSD flashbacks keep haunting me üò≠
I am trying to get excited but I‚Äôm just not optimistic about this game whatsoever üò©
Caw caw!
hopefully this is where we start to turn the corner because we're better than this
Don't ya know a flock of ravens is called a conspiracy.
"Please beat the Tits, I wanna actually be happy today"
"Yea thats right, Ive watched 3 Ravens game this year we lost all 3 of them. Therefore I wont watch tomorrow"
Either you get player of the game or you break the curse and get to watch some ravens games this year
Listen on the radio. In 2011 I listened to games at work on the radio and they won them all. The ones I watched on TV when I wasn‚Äôt working ... including the AFC Championship with the dropped catch and missed kick...ugh.
Thank you for your service
"I didn't watch, almost, all of last season cause of my work schedule. I threw a, very successful, party for the Titans game....I won't be watching today either."
"I watched four total games

All of Chiefs, Pats, Steelers

And the second half of the Eagles and first half of the Colts game. I ain‚Äôt too lucky right now either."
this piece of shit got curious in OT didn't he
"I figure we are all lucky to even get a chance to see football this weekend.  I was sure the pandemic might truncate the season.  It still may, so watch the game and enjoy yourself.  You aren't a curse to the team, you're part of the flock."
you‚Äôre doing gods work
"Welp, it didn't work. You can start watching again."
you better not watch.
"Well now we know it's not you lol, we're just trash"
Same here lmao
"Must have been checking the feed on his phone, dammit."
You can watch again :(
Watch the game
"I have recently discovered a God-given gift that I have. I have the ability to make any team lose just by placing a bet on them. I have already placed a sizable bet on the steelers this week. Unfortunately this gift comes at a cost... Literally 

Might have to start a go fund me page to help us get that ring this year!"
seems like you weren‚Äôt the problem
It looks like you are allowed to watch games again.
Reminds me of the Chiefs fan who left the Divisional Round game last year when they were losing
Thank you for your service
I've noticed a correlation to prime time games and our losses...
All of us thank you for your sacrifice
Good news you aren‚Äôt cursed
It‚Äôs not you it‚Äôs us failing to win the big games. Watch tomorrow. This team needs to figure out how to win big games. It‚Äôs pathetic.
You have zero impact on the result.  Sorry. Peace.
I‚Äôve just watch all our games so idk what y‚Äôall are talking about XD
I want to like this post but it has 52 likes...I'm not touching that.
Thank you! I was wondering why we've been so off...
"SAME! As an NYC based flock member, I've only been able to see the 2 primetime games (and the tail end of one after the regularly scheduled game ended). All Ls. Feels bad man..."
Ty.....jk we just dont have that MOJO this yr
Thank you for sacrificing yourself for the greater good.  Consider yourself a great flock member and great American.
You‚Äôre better than me. I can‚Äôt go through that pain again
We only get really just a few games to watch a season. Watch the games.
"Just watch my man. I‚Äôve been to 4 Ravens games in my life (Live in NY). Went to the NY back to back games against Giants and Jets (2016) which we lost both. Then managed to make my way to Lamar‚Äôs first playoff game against the Chargers which we also lost. So I was 0-3. I decided to go to the New England game last year on SNF, and now i‚Äôm 1-3"
"I thought we were going to be undefeated when we didn't have fans this year because every game I go to,\* we lose. My theory is that I used up all my luck watching us beat the Steelers in 2015 (you know the game). 

\*my current streak -- 2016 at Giants, 2018 playoffs vs. Chargers, and 2019 vs. Browns at home. I was going to go to the Browns game in 2018 at home, last game of the season, so you're all welcome for me not going."
I thank you for your proactivity
Take my free award.
Same. Being a ravens fan in Slovenia is hard.
Gamepass is great just watch after the fact lol
"I just learned that I can't watch the upcoming Steelers game and I'm quite upset. Not upset enough to skip my nieces play (virtual) but upset!

Hopefully today soothes my pain."
"Nah bro it‚Äôs my fault. Seriously. 

Every game mirrors the prior week in my life. If I‚Äôve done well (attended to work, watched my diet, avoided drama) we win. The year we won the SB for example I got a scholarship to law school and had broken up with a toxic ex. The dark years that followed I was struggling with addiction and family problems. The year we drafted Lamar is when I made major life changes and broke that cycle. 

Past few weeks I‚Äôve been falling behind on grad school homework and been pigging out. But this past week I‚Äôve fucking buckled down and also made some good stock trades. So I‚Äôm fully confident we win this."
Because that‚Äôs what hero‚Äôs do
"Thank you for your service, Sir."
its working
This is fucking sad
I take it that you must have tuned in after all?
"We suck 
Jesus Christ"
Well this didn‚Äôt work
"I just wanted to note, that I truly didn't watch the game."
It really doesn't matter.
Thanks you sir üôè
"Listen Mr. PJExpat, keep ur eyes OFF the game. Plz and thanks"
"1. Wood floats.

2. Wood burns.

3. Witches burn.

#Watch the game and *try* to enjoy yourself!"
Browns fans went a whole season watching 16 games and they all lost yet they kept  watching Dont not watch cause you  have watched only losses.
"Don't do that to yourself. Our interior OL will play like trash whether you watch or not. If you want to watch it happen, just do it."
This did not age well.

Mekari played well last season if I‚Äôm correct? Let‚Äôs go big shot
I thought we were gonna move him to guard or something
This should‚Äôve been done 2 games ago. The snaps have been a disgrace and I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôll come back stronger but we literally lost a game last week because of it.
Feel bad for Skura but this is the right call you can‚Äôt be an NFL center missing snaps like that
"i get that everyone plays hurt. but when it affects your play enough that you can't do the bare minimum, just rest up big man"
"While moving Matt Skura out of the center position needed to be done pronto, I would much rather have Bradley Bozeman at center while keeping Patrick Mekari at right tackle (meaning Skura and Ben Powers would be the two guards). Center was Bozeman's natural position in college; and the Ravens even keep him in their discussions during the off-season to be the starting center this year had Skura not recovered by season's start. I get that Mekari has the actual NFL experience at the position; but what does that mean for right tackle, especially after Mekari held his own there last week in the second half?

Is D.J. Fluker *seriously* going to be back in the starting line up at right tackle? Oh, jeez..."
A week too late but I honestly was really concerned we would ride with him. I'm even okay with him at guard. He just has the yips he cant snap tje ball  that's the only thing that must occur on every play. If you cant snap you dont play. Its be like if I renovate bathrooms and all i do is shit in the toilet no ones gonna hire me.
"So how does the rest of the line shake out? Will it be Skura, Bredeson, Powers or Fluker at RG? And then Fluker or Holden at RT? I was expecting the line to be Brown-Skura-Bozeman-Powers-Mekari before this came out"
I thought he was still doing good at blocking just shit at snapping?
Good. It's about damn time
"Tough week for Skura. This is the best possible move, though."
So who's gonna be right tackle üò®
"Tune in this week, ""As The Oline Turns""....."
"No matter who starts today they are gonna get mauled. Simmons is a beast, also a POS who spat on Yanda supposedly in the playoff loss."
Awesome start to the game man! I mean really
"> After struggling last week to snap in key moments

Key moments = most of the game."
please dont die Llama
We can breathe easily now
Skura slander getting downvoted to hell in here lol
Move Skura to replace Mekari on the line.
"Good. If Skura is such a good blocker, we can just move him to tackle. But he has lost his right to play center for the time being."

"He‚Äôs not a bust. He‚Äôs been well worth his pick. 

That said I‚Äôm in the camp of not paying him the mega deal he‚Äôs gonna command because I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs the type that can win with a lesser overall team like a Wilson/Mahomes. Nearly every QB who gets those mega deals ends up seeing their teams regress quite a bit."
I think he is having his sophomore season a year late. He is a great QB and will continue to be one until he retires.
Stop going on r/NFL Ravens threads. Invariably you get the usual flairs posting racist shit.

"I get the feeling Romo says all the right things about Lamar, but low key he doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs very good. I feel like his praise is fake. 

Hope he balls out today and makes Romo mean it.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jyvwmw)"
"Regardless about how he personally may feel about our team, I really enjoy Romo calling games. He‚Äôs very good at articulating his thoughts on air, which mean a lot because I know he‚Äôs a former player. All other commentators sound clueless or senile IMO"
I like Romo calling any game tbh. He‚Äôs entertaining and he really knows what he‚Äôs talking about. I actually think he‚Äôs one of the most nuanced broadcasters out there.
Does he know Lamar's name? Does he call him Kyler Murray for 3 quarters? No? Then he cool.
He's the best color guy out there but he seems to root against us.  That's likely because the only games of ours he is assigned to are when we're playing a big market team.
I‚Äôm proud to have made it 69 for Fuck The Steelers
"He's no Kevin Harlan but yes, I like his commentary"
Romo is a great announcer. I don't think he dislikes Lamar. If anything the opposite.
Agreed.
"He's obviously good but I just can't seem to forget when he said something along the lines of 'I can't think of anyone besides Butker who could make that kick.'

I know it's petty but I can't get that Tucker slight out of my head."
"Lol it sounds like you‚Äôre inventing a reason to be defensive about Lamar.

Romo is the best announcer in the game right now, and we should be thankful when we get him instead of Ian Eagle for the 12th time in a row lol."
I think it‚Äôs interesting that an overwhelming majority clicked the top ‚Äòfuck the Steelers‚Äô option. I guess it‚Äôs embedded in our minds that surveys list yes before no?
I love listening to Romo call a game. Not since John Madden has there been someone as enthusiastic and familiar with the intricacies of the game.
Romo is great.  And if he doesnt think Lamar is perfect than he probably agrees with 99% of this entire sub.  Lamar is great but still has a lot of areas of improvement.

Gonna get an illegal formation penalty at least once in the game. It‚Äôs basically a certainty at this point

Oh I missed the elaborate memes in here

I'm hoping Madubuike and Broderick Washington step up
They‚Äôre also in danger missing a lot of their offensive line. May be a nasty game with a bunch of short gains for him. We just need to stop the chains from moving constantly and be ready for the quick slant to AJ or deep across the middle to the tight end.
Somehow the Ravens are still favored by 6. The only hope I have for this game is that Vegas knows something we don‚Äôt.
Heard titans are missing quite a few key players too. We'll see how it goes.
I think we sell out to stop the run which is going to put a lot of pressure on our secondary
Skybet have Henry 100+ rushing yards & Lamar 50+ rushing yards at 5/1. Seems like a no brainer to me.
Something is telling me Judon is gonna have a great game today
It‚Äôs gonna be an ugly 2 weeks
This is the game we figure out who we are and aren‚Äôt
understatement of the day.
"Halftime now - we are doing better than I expected. If we keep Henry to 3 yards or less on 1st down, we can pull this off.
Edit: final now - üò≠"
Good call
Just proved right
Not the worst still would like them though
this team is a joke
Chuck actually did good
Henry is going to set records :(
Defeatist smh
My expectations are low for sure this week. Which means the Ravens are right where they wanna be for a super bowl run
I went to work.  I‚Äôm not gonna watched it.
Wherever it is set it is still too high.. Derrick Henry for 700 yds lol
Im just happy Henry is on my fantasy team today. I hope we win by 3 and Henry breaks the single game rushing record
I‚Äôm excited about having Deshon back there to tackle this week. He hits hard and tackles well. I predict he‚Äôll have a very good game. And he‚Äôll fare much better against Henry than Earl Thomas did last year.
Earl who?
Earl was Henry‚Äôs best blocker that game lmao
I understand elliot may have more fire but earl thomas is still a better player than elliot. Hes a step or 2 behind reaction wise.
Here‚Äôs to hoping!
"He hits hard but he takes bad angles at the LOS, which is where we need to hit Henry. But we'll see"
"Cant remember what game, but elliot was getting penalties and just giving up. View of him hasn't been great since the twitter comments though."
DeShon gave it to Henry
"Good point. Hopefully Patrick Queen can step up too, but he did not look good at all last week"
"Occasionally I can‚Äôt get the Ravens games because even though I live in MD, I‚Äôm closer to DC so it defaults to the silly Washington team.

"It‚Äôll be the WFT game. When I lived in Rockville, I used a real powerful HD antenna and could get WJZ regularly."
My cbs this week has 2 options one for the Redskins and one for the ravens. I suspect this may be the same for you.
"It‚Äôs possible it‚Äôll only be WFT on your end

But, you could always stream the Ravens game online if you really want to watch it"
Same issue I am having. I live in SoMD and am wondering if CBS All Access will allow me to stream the Ravens game since I‚Äôm technically in area. Just hoping it gives me the option and not force me to watch WFT.

Haha. I bought one similar last year. No one got the joke...

NFL does not care anymore. Browns have a positive test every week only that player goes to the list. We had the same with Humphrey too.
I‚Äôll delete if this is too controversial... but this definitely caught my eye. Especially with how mum the ravens have been about Trace and the NFL‚Äôs close-contact rule
"this doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean close contact though. i believe the rule is 15 minutes or more without wearing a mask, so it is possible none of the QBs are determined close contacts or all of the QBs are considered close contacts. also, McSorely doesn‚Äôt necessarily have covid, he may have just been exposed to someone with covid. so i guess we shall see"

God damn. Aged like milk
"The funny thing is that 11/22/2009 was the date of the Ravens/Colts game, a game in which the Ravens lost 17-15. Billy Cundiff made 5 field goals that day; but he also missed a costly 30-yarder in the 3rd quarter.

So, the question is: How truly thankful were you for Cundiff at the time? (I get that this status was either posted before the game or after one of his successful attempts in the first half; but man, only if you knew what was about to happen.)

**EDIT**: I've just put two-and-two together and realized Cundiff's career in Baltimore started *and* ended with him missing a crucial 30-something yard field goal in his first and last games as a Raven. Whoa, that's kind of interesting, albeit in a not-so-pleasant-for-us way."
"Look at it this way, if we hadn't gotten Tucker we might not won the SB the next year."

"The Cardinals ran a fake zone read against the seahawks that I think would fit in nicely with the Ravens offense.

&#x200B;

[https://imgur.com/a/puHZoBx](https://imgur.com/a/puHZoBx)

&#x200B;

1. From the shot gun, the qb and running back show a zone read look until they get to the mesh point.
2. Once they get to the mesh point, instead of the running back continuing across the qbs face  and carrying out the fake, the running back pivots in the opposite direction and becomes a lead blocker for the qb.

This would probably be effective against defenses relying on the scrape exchange to defend the zone read because the playside defensive end will take themselves out of position trying to cut off the zone run (especially if they aren't one of the extremely athletic ones) and the running back can then block the scraping middle line backer."
"greg roman and innovation, two things that will never exist"
"We tried something like that, I believe it was last week, and JK Dobbins messed up the fake. The Ravens did a dummy zone read into a QB option look with JK ass the pitch man. Just didn‚Äôt work out, but also a play I‚Äôve seen the Cards run"
They need to take the whole playbook. This pro style option attack only worked with 3 tight end sets being a major factor. The loss of hurst hurt more than what the coaching staff predicted. The team has to go to a spread attack to be successful moving forward. Without Nick Boyle the OC can't keep pretending like it's possible to run the same style of offense.

Time for Queen and Harrison to put the grown man pants on and get ready to catch a rhino in the chest

Washington is my least favorite team because they take priority in local games. I hate them and wish them nothing but failure if they air on  CBS
I live in Vegas and am somehow getting the game. Super thrilled about that. Guessing it's a regional thing keeping you from getting it. If that's in MD... Welp that's some bad football to replace this game with.
Where do you live
It's such bs I'm in Nova and this shit always happens every year fuck the skins
How we streaming?
You must live in the DMV and not in the true Baltimore primary market.
Its on CBS for me.  Eastern Shore MD
Well at least in AACo CBS is the Ravens game.

"Defense hurt, no stop run good

Offense loses 2/3 tight ends, no true #1 WR still, injuries, HoF guard retired, Lamars passing isn‚Äôt as bad as everyone says but it‚Äôs definitely not as efficient as it was last year but again having no actual targets will do that lol

We‚Äôre 6-3. We‚Äôre not a bad team, we just got spoiled by last seasons electrifying performances"
"- injuries

- no Yanda

- Hollywood is a bust

- Roman is trash and his play calls consistently suck

- we don‚Äôt use our actual food players enough (jk, Gus, Snead, duvernay)

- injuries"

Fuck off Lamar has taken that hit 20 times this season
Why have Souljas who can't catch?
Dobbins has that same fire Lamar has
"I like how Lamar said this was not a revenge game, then the Titans come out and act like the Ravens have been dissing their moms all season"
All these Soulja not using their hands
Dobbins big gain...... doesnt touch ball again on the drive. Makes sense.
They've missed 2 obvious TN holds.
Re-up Bowser give him as many princesses as he wants
Gosh I'm such a slut for a good defensive series
"Friendship with Hollywood ended

Andrews is my new Soulja now"
Henry not as good without Earl Thomas lead blocking for him
"No matter what, Henry got shut the fuck down today without Calais. Martindale is a tank."
Lamar scrambles for 12 seconds and not a single WR gets any kind of seperation
"I love Ingram, but he's not RB1 material at the moment"
The Titans have 2 good seasons and think they can go back to 2000 trash talking everybody
Harbaugh needs to print out Hollywood‚Äôs dumbass tweet on 100 cards and give them to him every time he doesn‚Äôt play like a soulja

Got to give that defense big credit. They're holding it down against Henry. No room whatsoever.

"JK is averaging 8.3 yards per carry and Jackson is 2/8

"#FIX YOUR FUCKING STUPID RTP PENALTIES

#THAT WAS CLEAN AS HELL JUST A HALF SECOND LATE. FUCKING BULLSHIT"
This team gets fucked harder on penalties than anyone else
"He was a yard past the marker, wtf is that spot"
What a terrible finish. FGs don‚Äôt get it done.
"Ngl I like seeing these scuffles, it shows the ravens are actually engaged and tryna win. You can tell when they space out and aren't focused. So far that hasn't really happened.

Roman, however, continues to fuck us over"
Talk YO SHIT DOBBY
My disdain for the Titans has increased tremendously because of what they did before the game. FUCK EM!
Hollywood looking like a bust rn man
Best Power back in the league and you dont give it to him on 3rd and 2?
Good challenge harbs.
That holding penalty didn‚Äôt take long
I‚Äôd like to take this time to point out how we are the 5th most penaltied team and we have the second least amount of flags for us
I really hope Dez gets more than one target in the second half
Meanwhile Joe Burrow just got carted off. Looked like a brutal left knee injury. Prayers up
Titans taking ‚Äúplay like a raven‚Äù to heart lol
Good challenge. Bullshit call by refs.
Every game feels like Ravens vs Refs.
"lol that drive was a microcosm of all our problems on O

-Gus and JK chunkin yards then get ignored

-Hollywood the Butterhand Soulja

-Lamar floating balls

DARKNESS 

IMPRISONING ME"
"We just can't blame our offensive woes on one person or one thing. There are so many things going on:

1. Really bad injuries to key players (Stanley, Boyle, and Ingram most notably)
2. Roman is just not calling plays to this team's strengths. Tough to watch sometimes.
3. Our receivers are inconsistent.
4. Our O-Line is inexperienced.
5. Lamar isn't seeing the field like he did last year, which is probably a result of the aforementioned points.

Fortunately, none of this is impossible to overcome (except for maybe the injuries--but every team is struggling with injuries). We can improve!"
That is a horrible fucking call. Fuck the god damn refs.
I expect a penalty whenever we get a stop on defense and whenever we do something good on offense at this point
How did we lose to the pats üòî
"I watch other teams and their WRs make all these great plays. Since SSSr, playoff Boldin, and the late stage Derrick Mason, this team has spent 20 years looking for a young elite WR"
We need to draft only O-line and WR this draft
I‚Äôm just happy we held them to 3
Good challenge.
"Apparently Titans were doing their pregame speech on our center field logo and Harbaugh got into it with Malcom Butler. Seriously fuck this team, hope we kick the shit out of them."
So sick of this RB by committee. Just run dobbins and use gus on third downs and Ingram on passing plays.
We literally have to play the refs every week
Bullshit ass call man. Come tf on. That's a textbook fuckin tackle
The Titans are failing all the way down the field how is this even happening
"Titans about to score off of 2 bad calls, then again that has been happening most of the games this year"
That was a Roman call lmao. New center. Lets run a wildcat play lmao
#what a snap by Skura yesss üëèüëèüëè
Did anyone else hear tony romo say ‚Äúwell they have Skrua‚Äù and then say oops other team
Jesus Christ I‚Äôm still so hype about that kill shot from Elliot to Henry. That‚Äôs the kind of hit that makes people not be so afraid of you anymore.
"Nah man, Duvernay did a shitty job of spotting that ball. Should've been his."
Ryan ‚ÄúLamar Tannehill‚Äù Jackson
"Lamar makes a throw like that and everyone crucifies him. 

Starting WR make that catch."
Would love an 8 minute scoring drive right here.
Good challenge
Lmao refs doing everything to make sure we don't get a conversion
It‚Äôs fine Tucker 70 yard field goal incoming
"Remember when Greg Roman said he was going to change up play calling this week?

Pepperidge Farms remembers"
These Titans player talking to much man
Can romo get vrabels dick out of his mouth
What is Romo fucking talking about?
At least our Defense is playing good again
Alright guys I'm at work and my Wi-Fi is terrible so I'm going to have to live bicuriously through you guys
"DeShon Elliot is Cam Chancellor in the free safety spot

I thought we were getting a ball hawk"
[deleted]
He just head butted dez in the fucking helmet and no cal
"Wolfe is fucking balling today, damn"
This is why we need a legit number 1 WR. You think DHOP doesn‚Äôt make that catch. That‚Äôs what they are there for to bail out average throws.
Obviously a 1st down
Remember when the refs moved the Patriots ball forward past the first down even though they were short ü§î
Stop letting Tannehill get easy ass yards on every rollout
"Please Lamar, please just get it done. End the narrative. Get some revenge for last year. Show us this team actually has something about it. It‚Äôs on you"
"Chuck Clark, Marcus Peters, and Marlon Humphrey just gave up the ugliest TD a WR has had on us all year."
"I can't wait for the post about how everything is just fucking dandy and the people not happy about losing games are ""fake fans"""
"This one is unforgivable. You can‚Äôt give up an 11 point lead in the 4th quarter against a team that can‚Äôt defend on third down and just move on to next week without acknowledging something drastic needs to change with this team. 

Greg Roman needs to go. Hollywood Brown needs to make catches if he wants to run his mouth on social media. The defense needs to tackle. And when those things breakdown, which they often do. Lamar Jackson needs to step up and be a winning quarterback, the way Ryan Tannehill just did. So far, he hasn‚Äôt.

If the Ravens don‚Äôt have a sizable lead, they lose. They can‚Äôt play from behind. They can‚Äôt overcome deficits. They can‚Äôt hold mid-game marginal leads. It‚Äôs pathetic."
That was a great throw by Lamar... some Soulja lol
"Not even a second in the pocket, I'd love to see any other QB thrive in that situation..."
They don‚Äôt wanna talk about how that mf just tackled 2 people?
Dez definitely was open.
If they're gonna call that bullshit might as well tell your players to hit him as hard as possible
Dude we have caught the most bullshit fouls in the last 3 games I swear
How the fuck is that roughing the passer. In a situation after a 3rd down stop. Worst professional sport for officiating and its not even close.
"""roughing the passer"" lmfaooo"
# 89 IS OUR SOULJA
THEY LEARNED FROM GREG ROMAN THE BEST
Try that fucking wildcat again trash
REFS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO FUCK US OVER SICK OF IT
Wtf dude I hate bitching about refs but that's just fucking ridiculous
We need to start bullying refs till they quit or get better at their fucking job
They really fucked us with that spot on the last drive
"To yall saying why didn't Lamar look at Dez way for a jump ball. Why in the fuck would he risk a jump ball??? It was obvious, throw it wide open or throw it away for the FG."
"Judon with the 15 yard penalty on the coin toss, probably."
Can‚Äôt complain about a penalty that just needs to be a better throw
decent drive. Receivers still dogshit
JK has a right to be pissed.
JK is gashing them. So lets take him out and try to get cute
Yannick is HUNGRY todya
Imagine running wildcat on a crucial play and losing momentum because of a bad snap. Ravens would never
Burrow getting carted off with that gruesome injury after all of the other QB injuries should make us grateful that Lamar is healthy right now and to not take that for granted
"Time to drain the clock. Let Lamar run it, hand it to JK and Gus, eat the remainder of the fourth quarter and force them to go 80 yards in 40 seconds"
Yea that's a first
Stands?! Fuck yourself refs what???
This shouldn‚Äôt have ever come to this because Lamar got the first.
Don't worry. First round sensation Hollywood Brown will save the day. He's unstoppable!
"This is on Mekari.

Dude picked the worst fucking time for a brainfart."
Harrison has quietly been playing great football the last two weeks
Roman is ruining Lamar with shit plays.
"The fucking rookie is fuming at you, Roman, get fucked man."
Wow 3rd and 7 and no penalty to give them the first down. W.
"@Yannick haters that‚Äôs the kind of play that doesnt show up on the stat sheet, forced pressure to an incomplete on 3rd down"
DOBBY IS FINALLY A FREE ELF GOD DAMMIT YES
That was a thigh shot. Fuck this shit dude
Typical ref job
They should just rename roughing the passer to touching the quarterback
Refs have seemed really biased against us this year
"I loved romo last year, but his disdain for the ravens is ridiculous. I am fucking sick of his bullshit."
They're really trying to turn this sport into a non-contact nightmare.
Yannick first official sack for us but he‚Äôs been a force since he‚Äôs got here
Something has to be broken there. Didn't see it but damn.
Fuck the Titans but hope he‚Äôs ok
"Tits calling powers dirty is ridiculous,helmet hit him on the hip"
Skura playing for the titans?
HAHA FUCKING SUCKS DOESNT IT?
"Dropped passes, injuries, and drives ruined by bad snaps. You can tell the Titans have been watching ravens film."
"FUCK THE TITANS

FUCK MIKE VRABEL

FUCK DERRICK HENRY 

LMAOOOOO"
RAVENS POSITIVITY IS BACK ON THE MENU
The Titans franchise is such trash
Why is that not a penalty on the guy hitting Dez in the helmet after the play.  That‚Äôs a penalty on us every time
Duvernay fucking quit on that play! WTF!
Derek Wolfe has been amazing
We should not be allowed to draft anyone shorter than 6'3 this year
Elliot reminds me of Dawkins with his huge hits and how fucking juiced he is lol
We need a 10 minute scoring drive here can't put the ball back in Derrick Henry's hands
our best receiver willie snead
"Eagles are useless. Jags are useless.

We need this win. Fuck the titans"
We should simply... microchip the football and use technology to get the spot right every time
Lamar kills way too many drives with awful off target throws.
After going up 11 at the beginning of the 3rd quarter the Ravens have run TWO RB rushes...
"Damn, that FS penalty stopped us."
Lamar came back and tied the game.  Thats growth.  I want tobwin this game but even if we don't we are seeing a ravens team that is growing.
"If Greg Roman doesn't catch the game winning touchdown, I want him gone"
"They should be ashamed. Letting a team come in and dance on your midfield. Letting them talk shit and hit you in the mouth. They disrespect that shield when they play like that. The same shield Ray Lewis and Ed Reed built up. Shame on them. 

Embarrassing"
Can Marcus Peters learn to fucking tackle by the way?
It‚Äôs telling that I have way more confidence that they‚Äôll manage to lose a close game than win one. Dramatic difference from last season.
This team is so soft. The Titans come out talking shit on our logo and then drive right down the field. They have no respect for us and we aren't giving them any reason to
"FUCK THE STEELERS

FUCK THE TITANS

FUCK THE BROWNS

FUCK THE REFS

FUCK INDIANAPOLIS 

AND FUCK THE WHITE PANTS

Can we get the purple or black pants back please?"
Yo wtf was that titan punching our guy at the end there?
Dez caught it?
"DEZ CAUGHT IT

that‚Äôs how i do it right?"
The fact it looks like NOTHING is changing week to week is a seriously fucking issue. Our coaches are looking overrated af
I don‚Äôt want to hear anymore shit from #15 until he can do his job
Every Ingram handoff feels like a wasted play tbh
"Fantastic play by Harrison, making the tackle while blocked lol"
"Out of everyone this sub has turned on, Queen is the only one I won‚Äôt understand. First year and he‚Äôs been solid for like 90% of his snaps"
Dobbins has a huge run. Pass the ball twice.
Delay of game and an opi missed lmao
Honestly Dobbins is our best rb by far
"Another BS penalty, that was not a low blow at all.  All the way above the knees, what a crock of shit."
You can‚Äôt hit in the stomach anymore??
Roughing the Passer has been ruined since they modified the rules. Tampa a week ago got flagged for roughing on a sack. It's ridiculous.
Always gotta give the opponent help in an offensive league. Fucking bullshit.
Refs are biased and you can‚Äôt tell me otherwise
Yannick showing up today
Okay so we literally didn't even want to score. Literally a Titans player got injured because we decided to run plays without attempting to score rather than just take it to half. Kinda of awful actually
"imma be honest yall, im getting to a point where im getting sick and tired of our playcalls."
That Pats game was the definition of a trap game with weather injuries center fucking up and all
#Stunt on these hoes Lamar
Lamar threw him open
Classic Lamar. Finally!!!
Now that‚Äôs a Soulja
Ok. So Elliot is better than Earl in tackling Derrick Henry lol.
Deshon Elliott is killing people out here
Opponents O-lines are *immune* from holding calls
The ghost of skura strikes again
"Same play as last year, different result."
About time another team fucked up on a snap üòÇ
"Simmons needs to calm his ass down, making contact with every Raven he can"
Well pretend that‚Äôs a punt... Smh
Henry is absolutely getting stopped. Good job D. He was the concern and hes been eliminated so far.
Could have eaten the clock to make it 2 score game but no we had to throw it deep
"Ryan Clark was 100% right. Henry doesn't truck big dudes, just little DBs. He's too tall"
"looked at the thread and thought we were losing, checked the score and we're winning even with all the injuries. Why is everyone so upset"
Why dont we get any holding calls.
Big stop for real
Feed Dobby please
Why in earth did they not go for it on 4th with Henry who for this drive looks good? Got away with one there.
GRo calling red zone plays for them?
Looked like a really shitty spot
That‚Äôs first . It shouldn‚Äôt even had to have been challenged
They need to launch some sort of inquiry into this bullshit.
Yo this game is seriously fixed
Derek Wolfe is an absolute beast!!
"Why do we have to deal with this BS every fucking week?! I know we aren't the only team that gets unlucky with calls, but we are DEFINITELY up there with the amouny of bad calls we get per game."
"I‚Äôve never seen our defense play this soft and heartless. Baltimore is viewed as one of the best tackling teams every year and today our tackling, or lack there of, is killing us. Even if we squeak into the playoffs, we‚Äôre getting blown out first round playing like this."
Snead just have me a fucking heart attack
Good recovery by Snead
mekari stopped us from winning the game there.
If the center didn‚Äôt fuck up Hollywood would‚Äôve had the game winner. These penalties are killing us
Best chance is a missed fg at this point.
I hate the fact that this loss puts us BELOW THE BROWNS in the standings
"When did this sub turn on Patrick Queen all of a sudden? He's not great yet but he's been one of the best defensive rookies, he had zero preseason and is still learning"
"Literally our defence leaves a guy wide open on every play, and refs only call holds one way. Every week"
Shoutouts to Greg Roman and our new 'identity'
That was a good playcall tho
"PI only on us per usual, life as a ravens fan"
Lol titans get all the break against the ravens that lb had no clue where the ball was and it hits him on the hand
Grab Henry by the turd and throw his ass down
Better hands than the Soulja
"Pay Bowser, let Judon walk!"
Anybody who says Roman doesn‚Äôt deserve to get fired after that drive is blind
"Imagine taking out JK, what a FUCKING JOKE"
"Dobbins 2 big runs...

GRO- ok that‚Äôs enough let‚Äôs pass now. Dobbins go to the bench..."
"Defense looks good,  offense sub par?

Ravens football is back baby"
Run defense looks soooo much better this week. Luckily one of our coordinators knows how to adjust...
Tony clearly watches our games: ‚ÄúJudon did well to not hit him in the helmet‚Äù lmao
I have zero doubt about Lamar‚Äôs passing ability. Just develop those receivers and develop better playsü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
üó£START DOBBINSüó£
"that wasn't roughing, WTF refs

He was already in motion"
What a fucking joke of a penalty
Can‚Äôt go low can‚Äôt go high can‚Äôt do fucking shit
I‚Äôm sorry.  That‚Äôs a call that we don‚Äôt get when we are on offense!
"Romo sounding like an idiot on that, he hit him right in the dick. thats not low"
"I‚Äôm trained on 3rd down stops not to get excited, I always look for the flag"
"Soft ass call , we get like 2 calls in our favor a season"
Romo makes me uncomfortable.
This drive by the Titans is unbelievable in every feasible way
Ngakoue already has that Play Like a Raven mentality
Yannick is bringing pressure every single play. Major props to EDC for acquiring him.
"Yannick showing his explosiveness now, will we now start to reap the dividends?"
Yannick is killing today.
Ngakoue been reading you niggas' comments and he's very upset now üò°
Yannick hopefully keeps winning vs Sambraillo. Usually if a rusher starts to dominate it doesn't get better for the tackle the longer it goes on.
# cLiPpInG
Some of these US comedies look god awful. Do people genuinely like these shows?
this is the first ravens game where yannick has looked like a game wrecker.
For the most part a good half by the offense and defense. Defense held it down when they needed to & have contained Derrick Henry & the offense has been moving the ball
#I REFUSE TO BELIEVE GREG ROMAN IS CALLING PLAYS
I took a piss and missed the fuckin touchdown lol
That was Andrews Jackson chemistry!  Like a $20 bill
That is literally the play we ran last week that Skura botched LMAO
"lol... what kind of trickery was that?

""BAH GOD THAT'S GREG ROMAN'S MUSIC!"""
MFW the Titan's center says he has a cut on his thumb
They really tried to hit us with PTSD smh
Titans fans calling to injure Lamar haha pathetic
[Titans fans are the best ](https://i.imgur.com/reNyJ6s.jpg)
Ol' reliable Willie Snead.
Yeah he got it
Another awful spot.
This team makes me so fucking angry
"Ever since Harbaugh yelled at that ref, we are called on every soft penalty"
Watching Steelers highlights. His passes are the same or worse than Lamar's his receivers just adjust and make ridiculous plays.
Hate to be negative but this has all the makings of a classic Ravens loss
Calling him humphries triggers me
All Hollywood has done since complaining about targets is drop passes smh.
It gets clearer every week how Dobbins is the best RB on the roster
lamar seems like he‚Äôs making some decent passes. that drop by brown woulda been a great play
"I still have faith in this team, but the 2019 season made me forget how it felt to watch a ***real*** Ravens game"
I don't hate them more than the Steelers but the Titans are up there
Big play there by Harrison. Good for the rookie
And a little crow for the queen haters
Where are all of you cry babies at?
But queen sucks according to this sub cause pff said so
"Some dude said sorry Ryan, your WR is in another castle. Lmaooo"
"PUT RESPECT ON HIS NAME NOW

HE‚ÄôS ROOKIE FFS"
Dez 1 on 1 is why you brought him in for.  Hello?
"JK running at 8 yards a clip?  Back to bench, I‚Äôve got a sweep lined up for our power running back.  Gtfo with this nonsense."
"Just fire Greg Roman man.

Why don't you just run the damn ball with Dobbins?"
Wtf man at some point we have to start questioning HARBS for allowing the same shit week after week
Greg Roman took Dobbins out to make Gus Edwards look like a jackass
"Absolutely no one:


Roman: Lets take out the guys whos been running constantly and giving us yards. 


Fuck roman."
"Defense has woken up, offense can you do anything?"
I WANT A FUCKING TOUCHDOWN
"Dobbins keeps glaring at the sideline like, ‚Äúmother fucker, DO NOT pull me out.‚Äù Haha"
Dez has been open on several plays...just sayin
YO SOMEBODY CALL ROMAN AND TELL HIM TO JUST LET DOBBINS EAT
ThE pReViOuS pLaY iS uNdEr ReViEw
This game cements the Dobbins is the RB1
"Note to dobbins:

Be rice, but don‚Äôt be Rice

If you catch my drift"
Dobbins is our future and it‚Äôs not even funny. Build around him like the Vikings did with Cook
"Greg Roman is like ‚Äú#27? Never heard of him, lets give him a whirl."
DOBBY IS A FREE ELF
I would be bawling lol that looked like it hurt so much
He's diving at him while he's throwing what do they want him to do.
HOW IS HE SUPPOSED TO PULL UP FULL SPRINT GTFO
Yannick making his presence known
Ngakoue just needed some time to adjust to our D hopefully he eats from here on out
"Ravens 14, Tenesee 7, Refs 3"
"Titans, enjoy the three points from the refs!"
Oh my goodness. Shut the hell up about that damn review. It was like 15 plays ago
"Now Dobbins getting in it with the Titans defender??

Bruh I LOVE Dobbins' energy today!!"
Playing calling was trash there
1 timeout with 50 seconds to go and play it safe???? You have got to be kidding me.
71 yards in penalties in a single half lol
now THATS A MUTHAFUCKING PLAY RIGHT THERE!! Roman is living up to his comments this week!

"Where is everyone from an hour ago saying season is over we‚Äôre gonna go 8-8?

Jk, all love fam!"
DESTROY THE TITS!!!
ELLIOT JUST FUCKING KILLED A MAN
Sit down Henry. That ain‚Äôt Earl.
Holding them to a FG would be a massive W
"#71 got held so badly, call a fucking hold on them refs"
Looked like a skura snap
Let‚Äôs get a Dez TD on this drive!
Wow having center issues really hinders your ability to score points
"And this is how Dez Bryant gets snaps.   Our WRs are not very good, we can't ask for much of them."
That was on Duvernay. Gave up on the route
"Dez is having a better game then Hollywood and he hasn't played in years, lmao."
"Defense has *really* stepped up. Love the play of Fort, Queen, Wolfe today."
The hit on Henry is looking like it‚Äôs affecting him a lot. Big statement hit for the rest of the game though.
Damn I thought our injuries were bad...
That deep pass was the most idiotic thing we could have possibly done.
Henry is gouging ya and they pass? That‚Äôs some Roman level playcalling
Big stop
We **have to score a TD**
wow... surprised they went for a FG there.
We need a scoring drive now
That was a first down on replay. Worth a challenge imo
WTF?  I thought he had the 1st down too.
You have nothing to lose with this challenge.
"Man, I love the Ravens but FUCK this season."
"Let's go win a fucking game. FUCK.

"I want us to go ahead and drive for the win.

But I know we won't."
Anyone remember when it was like 21-13
Those routes were sad as fuck lol.
Wow our WRs really are that bad.
Regardless of the outcome that was a clutch drive by Lamar. Showing development...
"Bout to put Hollywood on a milk carton yo


where is this man?????"
good job peters keep getting beat all game
The offense in this game was specifically Greg Romans adjustments to be better. It looked exactly the same. Boot him.
This about to be a bad day for us.
"This team looks like it's given up. Bunch of fucking pussies since they got upset in the Divisional round.

Wish we had a suggs personality. Need some nastiness with the talent"
The most tight ends by all tight ends - Jim Nantz
Somebody needs to be Cam Cameron‚Äôd. Team playing with zero grit like wtf
Why can't we have a wide-open reciever also ü§î
"Defense is cooked until we get cambell and williams back. Greg Roman better put his money where his mouth with after his comments of fixing this offense, because they have to win it."
Dobbins is so clearly better than ingram yet doesn‚Äôt get a lot more carries
"Incompletion but I like the play concept, sliding max protection"
Defenders beat our receivers on every contested catch.
Lamar had him fire that bitch in there cmon dude
Hollywood should be named puxatney phil cause hes afraid of his own shadow
Sigh bowser to a 3 year extension RIGHT MEOWWWWWW
LETS GOO FUCK THE TITANS AND THERE DIRTY ASS TEAM
Patrick ‚ÄúLightning‚Äù Queen
Excellent blitz forcing a bad decision by QB. Time for a TD
Someone just called Queen a bust like 2 plays ago lol
Ridiculous. Dobbins converts 2 firsts and Roman sits him to call garbage ass plays that our O can‚Äôt execute
What the fuck are these calls fucks sake
1st and goal and you call some random bs play that your players don‚Äôt even know how to run right... sounds bout Roman
Greg Roman has got to go wtf
"Say what you want about our receivers, but Mark Andrews is legitimately a top 3/4 TE and even he hasn't been great this year


It's the fuckin coordinator. Get Roman the fuck out of here"
I just can‚Äôt understand why Dobbins isn‚Äôt getting most carries.  The man has burst and is our best runner by far.  Are our coaches just blind or we refuse to change the game plan? Either way is bad
"Pleasantly surprised at the Henry containment so far. Yea he's getting yards but he's not trampling us as much as expected.

Our offense NEEDS to step TF up ASAP cuz we're gonna lose this game if we can't score on these drives. Roman...just give it to Dobbins, we could've had a TD and been ahead."
Starting to feel like a classic Ravens game. Defense carries and we can only score on FGs.
OMFG if we don‚Äôt feed Dobbins all game
Mandrews is WR1
Don‚Äôt take dobbins out for the rest of the game
Friendship with ingram ended. JK is my best friend now.
# FUCK THE TITANS
all jokes aside though our offense isn‚Äôt a well oiled machine like it was last year. The running back by committee shit isn‚Äôt working. It‚Äôs time to let JK be the feature back.
The fuck is he supposed to do? Tickle the qb till he drops the ball
Bullshit call as usual. Ravens **always have** one of those
I‚Äôm disgusted with that call.
"That‚Äôs fucking soft. Hit at the waist, was falling down, happened as he was throwing.

Soft as fuck"
BULLSHIT CALLLLL
That wasn‚Äôt a stupid penalty. That was absolute garbage. This team is undisciplined at times but that wasn‚Äôt it
This year has been really frustrating with penalties
Jesus christ.  Just hold them to a FG here.  This drive is making me open the Whiskey
Thanks for giving the Titans a free first down
Only thing Titans receivers can catch is COVID
"That penalty is going to let the Titans run down the clock, score right before halftime, and then they get the ball  to start the 3rd. That penalty is going to destroy all of our momentum"
Stopped them twice on that drive too
Doing a much better job on Henry this year. Knock on wood.
GOD DAMN Yannick is beasting
"Wow wow wow. 

Yannick not only forced the throw but stopped his momentum just to be safe. Great play"
Great job D.  Holding them to 3 after all the adversity on that drive is huge.  Keep hitting Henry hard
Yannick showing up big time
Yannick may not get the sack but the pressure has been consistent. That makes a huge difference
"I hate seeing guys down writhing in pain like that, crap."
fuck dude that made me nauseous. poor guy
Listen to those cardboard cutouts booing
DAMN THAT SHIT WAS NASTY. Hope he recovers quickly. Damn that sucks
Titans sub think Powers did that on purpose lol
Not passing here is very not Harbaugh.
Lmao Judon said fuck it
Defense is looking really patient in a good way. Not being over aggressive getting into the backfield and letting short passes and screens turn into big plays.
Thank god we played the Chiefs early in the season and have since adjusted to the screen pass
Dobbins is literally ray rice and ray rice is the most explosive player we have ever had
Dobbins is lowkey the best player on our offense right now
I swear if Lamar just gets a little more consistent with his deep throwing Idk how you stop him
EARL THOMAS COULD NEVER
this might be a lil irrelevant to us but prayers up to burrow. he seems like a genuine guy and it‚Äôs a shame to see him go like this
is that how you get out of having to go into concussion protocol? just grab a different body part?
LOL SKURAED
LMAO fuck you Vrabel you fuck
lol did we trade skura
You have a new center and you put the halfback alone in the backfield? Insanity
Skura's probably on the sideline laughing rn
Woo-hoo a center mishap without skura
Everyone shitting on Skura and I get it but he was pretty good before he got the cut on his thumb wasnt he? I expect him to be back to snapping once that is 100%
Hit them with another deep shot LJ
"Mom can we have Bill Belichick

We have Bill Belichick at home

Bill Belichick at home: Mike Vrabel"
Yo fuck dean pees
Let's fucking get it Dez!!
Run defense steps up then our pass def shits the bed
Alright offense we need this rn
Offense really has to step up and put at least 3 on the board.
Defense really showing up in the red zone
Henry is having a great drive and you don‚Äôt run it on 3 and 4 and short near the goal line?! What!!!
"endless handoffs to Dobbins, then FG. At best, they get the ball back with 1 minute remaining."
The ravens are a bad football team this season and it‚Äôs  long past time to admit that.
"We look so different from last year 

No fucking swagger or heart. Where the fuck is ‚ÄúBIG TRUSSSS‚Äù and stuntin on teams 

This team looks fucking defeated and I hate it."
Let‚Äôs win that coin toss and feed Dobbins
I just can't believe these fucking play calls. It's insane.
Tucker is the only consistent thing on this team
refs swallow the whistle when it's our receivers being held
Can‚Äôt wait to see the wonderful penalties we can get next drive to ruin literally everything.
It‚Äôs okay guys wait till week 17 to complain about problems that have been here all season. If you even give a ounce of criticism I will call you a fair weather fan
"3 & Out, then let them walk in a TD. This game is going be over by halftime"
2 weeks in a row Lamar throws a 50/50 ball to our WRs. 2 times the opposing team got an interception
hate their fucking country music loving city franchise so much
Just feels like the team all of a sudden plays with zero heart
"Blitz on 3rd and long ----> First down 

Blitz on 3rd and long ----> First down 

Blitz on 3rd and long ----> First down 

Blitz on 3rd and long ----> First down 

Blitz on 3rd and long ----> First down"
sOuLjAs
He is Marquise until he can actually catch
Dobbins looking good
"Look. I love Ingram. Big truss, all that. 

Why in the sweet tender FUCK are we not using dobbins at all?!?"
"should just try pulling henry down by his dread, nothing else works."
PAY BOWSER WITH JUDON MONEY LOL
FUCK THE TITANS. FUCK ‚ÄòEM
THAT‚ÄôS Ravens D right there
Hated that playcalling
This offense is so bad and it‚Äôs because of coaching. Play calling and taking Jk out killed that drive coaching has been lackluster
"Deep in the redzone... time for a fucking field goal!

Flacco era vibes üíÄ"
Some of the shittiest sequence of plays I‚Äôve ever seen
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU TAKE JK OUT
Fire Greg Roman literally right now and let Lamar call the fucking plays.
"Running it down their throats isn't good enough for Roman. 

Dude is lost. Get him out of here."
Dobbins is doing great? LETS PASS THREE PLAYS IN A ROW!
They really tryna jinx tucker
I can‚Äôt believe this is what we gave our FRANCHISE QB this season. Only team in the NFL that routinely fails to surround their FRANCHISE QB with great weapons. Even back in the Flacco era
Dez would have had that TD
Jeez did JK fuck Roman‚Äôs wife or something? Give the hot hand the ball what the fuck
#Ravens have not had a standout wr since Steve Smith Sr
"Roman: Dobbins, 2 runs with 5+ yards. Yeah lets take him out and try some garbage passes.


W.T.F. He fucking needs to go."
Why the hell was Dobbins sent to the bench never to return when he was the only one keeping the sticks moving on that drive...
So Dobbins fucked Romans wife? Or took a shit in his cereal? Our RB rotation feels like the opposite of riding the hot hand.
Justice Hill finally found his role on the team as a ST Ace.
Henry missing Earl Thomas on lead block
Again how do you line up Dez on the outside 1 on 1 and don't tell Lamar to take that shit 100%?
"Fuck the Titans man, they're trying to be relevant by acting like tough guys"
Fucking finally man. Now score with dobbins............
How many times does dobbins have to prove himself? KEEP HIM IN
"Dobbins and Edwards need to be the RB tandem. I love you, Ingram, but your wheels aren't what they were."
This would be a blowout if Roman ran it in with dobbins.
Should be a TD. Worst case scenario its 1st and goal on the 1 inch line
Dobbins is a beast... especially considering the banged up o-line he's playing behind.
It's clearly a TD. Refs out here demanding recounts like the Titans check just cashed in
Dobbins player of the game so far
Anyone loving Dez hype the boys up?? LOVE THE ADDITION üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Queen is good. His face got rustled. We good yall.
"Me in the Spring: ""[Who needs Claypool? He's a worse version of Boykin who might have to go the Waller route. I like Boykin in a second year.](https://64.media.tumblr.com/57cb00eca4e9e46c42772a0883880afb/0567845762f90203-fe/s250x400/19d99706e24453bfa30dc26328d89ae4c62a1950.png)"""
This team gets fucked by tricks every week lol
"Wasn't that right at the waist, and right at the release?  Call seems weak to me."
WEAK call.
"We have to be leading the league in penalty yards, right??"
Soft ass call. Fuck these refs
Receivers named brown and dropping the ball name a better duo
fucking hate the titans so much
[deleted]
I feel like we stopped them 5 times on this drive alone
"I really try hard not to be a homer about bad calls, but fuck man that was a squeaky clean hit."
This drive is like what I would imagine being fucked in the ass without lube would feel like.
"As it stands there is no means for the league to hold officials accountable for bad calls. Until this changes, it's only going to get worse."
How many times were the Titans bailed out on this drive? And they still didn‚Äôt score lmao
This fucker has sucked all year and of course nails that FG
# FUCK THE TITS
Ok Hail Mary to Dobbins ez
THAT is why we got Yannick yall. Dude is just abusing the left tackle.
Why do the networks act like we care if they have a double header on their network?
"Damn, he's in some pain.   Hope he's ok"
JK is fired up today
We should be blowing the Tits out right now if our red zone offense was even a shell of last years
Romo been shit all game. How do you not know the holy roller
48 sec with a time out and we don‚Äôt even try to get into fg range?
Lamar shoving dobbins back in the huddle as HES jawin with the titans lol
Refs have a permanent residence in Baltimore‚Äôs stadium in the away team locker room
I‚Äôm not even envious about the Steelers dusty 6 Super Bowl wins. I‚Äôm envious about their constantly great WR core
"I don't usually care, but that was an especially bad halftime report right? They talked more about Roethlisberger and Deshaun than the game we're watching."
Wink is a great coach/strategist. I'll be sad when he leaves for a HC job
That was a bad ass spin Dobbins
Jackson is so good when the line plays well
Where are the people who said Lamar can‚Äôt throw deep and outside the number?? I wanna talk to them
My god what a strike Lamar!!
üëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºüëèüèºYEAAAAAAAA BOIIIIIIII
YELLING AT THE TV TIME! LETS GOOOOOOOO
No way Roman is calling these plays...
Refs pulling out the flag machine for the titans drive ü§°
Pretty sure that was outside the numbers!
"Now Mandrews got a TD, I want to see Dez catch one before this game is over"
"Shout out to that guy intentionally not watching the game, apparently thats all we needed"
Burrow's being carted off and he's clutching his knee. Damn that sucks.
DESHON PUNKED HENRY
I don't get what Peters was doing after he caught up to Davis there. Lazy.
The only thing I wanted to see today was Derrick henry get smacked I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs not hurt but that was fucking awesome
Fucking Romo doesn't know how to pronounce the names of ANYONE on our team
LMFAOOOO Roman switched teams at HT
HOW DOES IT FEEL BITCH
Why the fuck do refs not call holds for us? These should be drive killing penalties and its never called
"Titans fans: Baltimore has some snap issues

Titans center: hold my milk"
Time is a flat circle
That just felt SO GOOD
Ok boys let‚Äôs go seal the deal!
ELLIOT SMACKED THE DOG OUTTA HENRY LMAOOO
The league owes the Ravens an apology for that missed hold call on 71. I cannot get over how bad of a missed call that was. Teams we play never get called for offensive holding.
Did they not watch us botch the same play last week? Lmao
Whats Soulja today? 0/4?
We replaced Hollywood with Dez üòÇ
Awful route by duvernay
Dez ain't taking any shit I love it.
"It was a couple of plays ago; but man, I was so excited to see James Proche get involved in the offense and grab his first NFL catch!"
That one was on duvernay
That INT was on Duvernay. Not Lamar. He stopped in his route and misjudged the distance. Rookie mistake.
This offense is a complete mystery they can look top 5 one drive and then the next looks like they aren‚Äôt a NFL offense
We need a turnover right now. God I wish I was at the bank caz I know they‚Äôd be playing enter sandman right now and the crowd would be fired up
Can't let the D get worn out.
If we lose i‚Äôll never forgive them for costing us the opportunity to post that Lamar chip and pregame scuffle an entire week
Why does our bench have to wear masks but theirs doesn't?
"ive seen torrey smith and qadry ismail blame duvernay for that INT....

oh well. defense is gonna have to hold them here. damn, man..."
TD ends it cmon offense
"amazing hold by the defense, they may drag us kicking and screaming to a win"
Alright Ill take that. Offense just needs to do their job
FEED JK
"We need to just run the clock and throw intermediate routes to andrews, dez and our other WRs. We can't take deep shots. Keep on the up tempo short game."
Can we get a 2019 10 minute TD drive
Romo is digging Dobby‚Äôs juice
I‚Äôm getting the sense we hate Butler. Lol.
Give. JK. The. Ball.
Titans are bitches
I already went to the menu screen and went to challenge play
Nice challenge
Why can‚Äôt lamar make wide open throws ???
He‚Äôs wide open Lamar....
But Henry gets two yards when he was stopped at the line smh
"Bullshit spot, bullshit play standing and terrible overthrow. What a classic Ravens sequence"
How is no one actually on Tannehill on these boots every single time?
Reminder that we drafted Hollywood over Brown.
Sorry but I don‚Äôt trust this offense to go down and score. This game is over and so is the season
The Ravens are missing the playoffs
"That effort on Brown's TD epitomized this season. If this team doesn't make some major changes it won't even make the playoffs, let alone contend for a Super Bowl."
The overreactions in this thread. Fire all the coaches? Really?
This team is so incredibly infuriating to watch.
Please just win the game fuck Overtime
This game should not be going into OT
"ravens and killing momentum with dumbass penalties 

name a more iconic duo"
Gotta give props to lamar for moving it down the field like that.  Damn I wish we could‚Äôve scored
Let‚Äôs put the guy who constantly makes bad decisions on the field to make this decision lol
feels like it had been forever since we won an OT coin toss
Notice how we just forgot about Dobbins in the second half?
I can‚Äôt watch this shit anymore
going just as expected
Fire Greg Roman.
Marcus Peters STINKS today
Only chance is an interception or a punch out and I‚Äôm not optimistic
We really are pussies for letting them come in and disrespect us and blow a lead like we did.
This is what rock bottom looks like boys. They assfucked us.
Embarrassment of a team.
Pathetic to lose to this absolute bum ass team
that fucking hurt man.. fuck. they came into m&t and fucking trolled us to start then clowned us and won. god damnit
DO NOT GO TO THE TITANS SUBREDDIT AND TALK SHIT!!!
WE GONNA WIN THIS GAME FUCK YOU PUSSY BITCHES SAYING IT'S OVER
Refs fucked this drive. Fuck you
"This team is just so ... randomly inept on offense. False start, bad throw. Dumb pick when we're driving with momentum. Come on."
Call me fair weather fan IDGAF I have zero confidence in this offense completing a comeback drive
Fuck the titans man
Yet another holding call.  I hate the way that the Ravens seem to be the only team that holds.
Sweet there was our one play to Duvernay for the game.
I get Lamar is Lamar but we can‚Äôt always rely on him to convert 3rd down by taking on LBs
Nice drop soulja
"Fuck Hollywood ""Soulja"" Brown"
Ah there we go with the drops soulja
Just never take a WR in the first round again. Gets my hopes up
Soulja. Hollywood. Try Detroit.
Hollywood was already thinking about diving...hence drop the ball
Get Ingram tf outta there and get gus and Dobbins in. Let Ingram be a Cheerleader until he‚Äôs healthy
"Ctrl+f ""soulja""

41 results

lmao"
Lamar put some more heat on the ball man
How is this not a penalty?
"I think my hate for the titans is nearing steelers level. I'm still pissed about what they did pregame, too much trash talk and I hate Vrabels face. Where is this fire in the players on the field?"
Damn Malik bodies that guy AND henry
Malik just tackled two dudes
Harrison made the tackles whilst blocked üòÇ
If they don‚Äôt put in Dev the Dude Duvernayü§¨
Wow Malik what huge stop
Did he say McQueen
LETS GOOOO QUEEN LIT HIM UP!!!!!
"Ok, offense. Don‚Äôt blow this."
Every time Romo talks about the ravens you‚Äôd think we‚Äôve won the past 5 Super Bowls
**McQueen comes in!**
Queen heard us talking shit and Bowser heard us calling him a bust and just told us to fuck off
Whoever  is responsible for taking Dobbins out of the game needs to be fired AT HALFTIME.
This red zone offense is hot garbage
If we just ran JK 3 times we're in
Lmao the Titans are one of the worst red zone defenses in the league and this is what the Ravens do
What am I watching rn? This is high school level offense
"Let's take Dobbins with his momentum away, and lose yards with Gus and that stupid play"
2 weeks in a row how can you not score with Lamar in the redzone fire Greg roman fuck his ass I'm done
Our insistence on not putting dobbins in more is one of the more confounding things of any offense in the NFL. Particularly with an offensive line that‚Äôs made up of backups
Dobbins was gonna score. Greg Roman: Nah take him out and throw the ball. Fuck Roman. Fire his fatass
"This offensive line is fucking pathetic.

Feels like an L if they can't get their shit sorted and not lose on every single snap."
Fuck Greg Roman
just fucking run it up the middle two times and try a fade to dez. higher chance of success than whatever the fuck that was.
I love how Dobbins was slashing the Tit's D and then we just take him out of the game to throw three straight incomplete passes
Harbaugh deserves just as much blame as Greg Roman for allowing this farce to continue. Lamar saves his career and this is how he repays him?
"Great 3 and out, D!"
Fuck the Titans
Marlon shouldn‚Äôt be playing special teams
I wanna see Lamar throw up a 1 on 1 to Dez and see what happens
JK has Ray Rice vision and cuts with better speed
"*Dobbins runs for 10 yards a carry*


Roman: GET THIS MF ON THE BENCH STAT"
"dude I have no idea how they still think Ingram is productive

JK and Gus have looked so much better than him even going back to last season. I really dont understand"
In fairness the ball is late on lamars part
Csn you have a worse name than Holden as an o lineman
Dobbins will punch it if it's short.
"Ngl I love to see Dez in there, just wish he got more looks!"
I want Ricard to get a TD :(
Dobbins taking over as RB1 today.
"First Down: Dobbins, Second Down: Dobbins, Third Down: Dobbins."
Dobbins is a free elf!!
I wanted Ricard to get a TD but I also like Dobbins getting it too
"THE PREVIOUS REVIEW IS UNDER REVIEW

THE PREVIOUS REVIEW OF THE REVIEW, IS UNDER REVIEW"
These long ass reviews ruin watching the game live
Offense has more time to plan the 2-point conversion if they keep reviewing plays üëÜüß†
I can‚Äôt wait till Dobbins rips off a fucking 90 yarder. He‚Äôs more than capable.
[deleted]
I hope elton and bernie got a ton for that rakuten commercial cuz thats embarrassing af
Can easily be OROY. Just feed him
Dobbins > Henry
I think JK is now our lead back
Rub some dirt on it Queen.
Fuck the Titans
THAT IS A TERRIBLE CALL! THAT WAS NOT BELOW THE KNEE
What are you supposed to do then? As a defensive player jfc.
RTP is one of the dumbest penalties in the game
HE HIT HIM AROUND THE WAIST ROMO
I would love a questionable call stat because I swear it‚Äôs always us
Room fuck off- ur only famous for being a Cowboy üñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèº
"Idc what people are saying, Yannick has been disruptive af even if he's not getting all the way to the QB"
Someone needed to scoop that ball
"They called that a fumble? That actually fucks us on time, damn"
Yannick has been screaming off that edge all day
91 owned this sequence
"I LOVE Yannick. What a player. We need to lock him down, should be a priority."
Yannick is starting to get home. Exciting stuff.
Crazy there‚Äôs a team that drops more passes than us
Okay can we find a way to keep Ngakoue? we need for our future years
Gostowski never misses against us so those stats don‚Äôt matter
Can you imagine this D when Calais gets back? Can't wait.
Yikes.. hope he is okay
no more injuries :(
Why call timeouts and then run it lol
Shit that looks horrible. Hate to see it on either side
Yannick getting held or hit in the face every single play.  Still fighting through it.
"Honestly a clean block IMO

But he got hurt, so its a penalty!"
Can someone explain why we didn‚Äôt want to go for points there? Why did we take timeouts? Literally makes 0 sense man
Lamars passing is gonna go crazy once he clicks with bryant
That nfl shop commercial is getting old
We‚Äôre playing better than they are. Hope we can pull it out
Yannick is getting use to our style of play glad he is putting it together
Ready to see Justice hill bring the hammer down again
Defense has done a mostly great job on these screens today.  They've been a weakness all season.
Bruh where tf was this run defense in the playoffs
u/supersaiyansandwich you good? Haven't seen you for a while
Romo loves Dez lol. You can hear him trying not to gush but he's still doing it
Vrabel is a BITCH
Thank you insulin shots for everything
This is a underrated rivalry tbh Ravens and Titans fucking hate eachother
FUCK
"No more complaining for Hollywood, a tight end is a better deep threat than he is"
That‚Äôs a dime Lamar
Was that an actually interesting route combination? Well I never...
 But Jackson can't throw /s
Dime
"To his credit, Hollywood sucked the safety away for that TD."
EARL WHO
That ain't fucking earl thomas boi
ELLIOT THE KING SLAYER!!
What the fuck kind of tackling was that peters? Lmfao man.
I feel like Peters is good for a burn once a game
Damn my condolences for Burrow. I really like the guy even though I hate the Bengals. That looked brutal.
I guarantee Lamar meant to do that shit to Butler. Defending his coach. His did that shoulder pad taste Butler?
Karma is a bitch. Shouldn‚Äôt have talked so much before the game.
Lmaoooo Skura‚Äôs playing for the Titans now?
Matt skura the double agent
ok what was the point of that play? why was henry being snapped the ball?
Foot on the throat no mercy
"Man Burrow's injury looked awful, I'm genuinely so sad"
Duv should have kept chasing the ball. He stopped the route too early. Its ok. Let lamar take shots while we have the lead.
"You call it an interception.

I see a really solid punt that pins them deep."
I wish we would let Lamar air it out to Dez though.
Win the quarter win the game let‚Äôs go
This is all on Roman. We were up and instead of running we threw the game
"It wasn't well executed but you have to stretch the field occasionally.  INTs are always annoying, I get it.  The outcome was essentially a punt though.  Relax."
"seriously this is the most fucking retarded crowd noise in the entire league. who tf recorded that ""ooooooooooooh"" screaming dude and who's playing it for 3 fucking hours? seriously"
How is that not first
"This is a great drive after they scored points. Spell the defense and take some momentum from Henry. 

Good job O, complimentary football."
Absolute fucking bullshit
"This is fucking rigged, what the actual fuck"
Yall say the nfl isn't scripted lmao
Fuck the refs man they are such shit heads
Romo drunk today
fuck the way they spot the ball for real
"I know a lot can happen, but I think I need to turn the game off for my mental sanity"
Peters outside of getting turnovers has not been good in coverage lately.
What the fuck is this tackling
"Well, if Lamar would have made that throw to Andrews perhaps we wouldn't be relying on our beat to shit defense."
We‚Äôre pretenders
"This is honestly our season here. If we can go down and score it would give me some
hope for the season and I think the team some hope too.  If we don‚Äôt and lose, we‚Äôll maybe 2021 will be better."
Lamar needs a career highlight here. Needs to prove he can take over in these moments
Friendly Reminder we just need a FG
"Come on, guys. Save the season. Take it all the way to the house."
Lamar to Hollywood ftw
There need to be team fines for missed tackles this is ridiculous
FOR FUCKS SAKE THAT WAS A TD
I'm going to shit my pants if we get a td here
NO TURNOVER
These fucking false starts I swear to god.
This shit should not even be those close. Execution has been awful
2nd and 6 with a timeout. Run the ball
Receivers all standing still LOL
Watch us give up a TD.
MR AUTOMATUCK
Seriously no one could get open??? Jebus
It is uncanny how many dumbass penalties have screwed us this season. Our momentum never gets a chance to build
"Helluva 2 minute drive from Lamar and Co. I wouldve liked if they went and tried a Lamar run on that third down, I dont think the Titans were ready for a run"
Judon clutch on that coin flip!
"Ok boys, a TD and we win! LETS GOOO"
Go win this thing Lamar
Score a TD and send them home
This fucking team never has juice when it matters
Fans are allowed to get mad lmao this has been a messy game by everyone not named Dobbins or Tucker
We just don‚Äôt deserve this
Must be nice to have fucking receivers open once in a while fuck
And there still has not been a flag on Titans offense.
So Houston can beat New England but we can't?
Trash receivers getting wide open against this ‚Äúelite‚Äù secondary
Their receivers are wide the fuck open while our guys cant get 2 fucking inches.
"Mods, just start the blame thread already."
"So the Titans come into our turf, disrespect our logo, and then come back from a 21-13 deficit and beat us in OT. This team is a dumpster fire"
Can we get a WR next year? Instead of peeling Dez off the couch and Instagram hero Hollywood
Marlo and Peters have been cooked all day SMH
[deleted]
Why is throwing away the lead our favorite hobby. This is depressing.
Game was over when they let Brown walk into the endzone ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I at least love how Harb didn‚Äôt shake dudes hand at the end of the game.
That‚Äôs on Duvernay.
glad to see Dez giving 100% there...
FG? They don't respect our offence at all. Makes sense.
"That‚Äôs just a bad throw by Lamar

Andrews should‚Äôve had the TD"
"That was maybe the actual softest roughing the passer ever, fuck you Romo. He hit him around the waste just as he threw it"
We could be 8-3 and 1.5 game back for the division if we win today and Thanksgiving. I hope the team realizes this...
Titans only talking shit because they know that playoff win was a FLUKE. Run that game back 9 times outta 10 we win
HENRY GOT BITCHED BY ELLIOT SPAM THIS ALL WEEK LMAO
Vintage flacco arm punt
"""wE aRe 6-3 sO SpOiLEd cUz oUr tEaM pLaYS bAd""

Correction. 6-4 still not worried?"
Bold Predictions. Dez will score a TD today. We will somehow hold Henry under 100. We get a Jackson 5 today.
I'm very nervous about this game. I just don't see how we get it done without BWill and Calais.
Welp offense gone offense
Hold. Huge hold
This team ain't making the playoffs
The FB false started on that play just saying
"Fuck man, i hate the titans"
Looks like Harbs is the only one who showed up to fight today so far. They s on our crest and we don‚Äôt care.
"You know, it seems like every game, people just keep saying ‚Äúchill, we‚Äôre only _________.‚Äù

And I keep thinking to myself, what about this season has made anyone want to chill? This season is the perfect season to not chill. This season is the perfect season to worry."
I'm glad my expectations for this team are low at this point but jfc this is pretty sad so far
We get a 3 and out.....and they Ramrod us on their first drive. Where‚Äôs the fight at in this team!?
"Going to start looking at mock drafts pretty soon. How emasculating it is for a team to absolutely rip you apart when you're the #1 seed at home last year in the playoffs, then they come dance on our logo before the game, we go 3 & Out, and they have absolutely zero problem scoring a TD. It's like a big brother bullying a little brother.

I don't know what has to change but this team is pathetic"
Ingram is a waste of a down rn
What's the point of having souljas if they drop wide open?
"Brown dropped it because he was afraid of getting hit.

If you cannot make that easy catch then wtf are you doing in the league."
"And that right there is why I give Lamar so much leash. The drop the easiest fucking shit, how horrible do we think their other shit is like route running and decision making on options etc."
karma for hollywood‚Äôs tweetüò≠
Surprise surprise...Hollywood drops the ball.
Why even put Ingram out there when we have a RB that does each role better
Lamar late on the throw for an easy TD
I don‚Äôt wanna hear shit from Hollywood until he starts producing. ‚ÄúSoulja‚Äôs‚Äù don‚Äôt drop passes that High School receivers would catch
"Daaaaaamn.  

Thats what we suit Hill up for"
Hill with a sledge hammer. How the hell that guy held onto the ball I don‚Äôt know.
We just aren‚Äôt stopping Henry without Campbell or Williams
lets put hill as a 3rd safety
Great play by Harrison.
What a fucking play by Malik
Huge play by Leek
BIG MALIK!!!
Harrison is STRONG lol wow
1st quarter FLEW by
Lets fucking go tyrus!!!!!
‚ÄúSteve McQueen ran that man over.‚Äù - Antonio Romo
#YASSSS WHAT AN INTERCEPTION
YALL I SAID WE NEEDED A TURNOVER LETS GET IT HUGE PLAY BY BOWSER
I need Lightning McQueen flair
WHY YOU TAKING DOBBINS OUT
Need to stop fucking around and keep JK st #1. This is pathetic coaching.
Those last 3 plays were pathetic
"This Offense always seems to change shit up when its working. JK has momentum and all of a sudden he is taken out. Leave the man in, he's hyped af."
Roman needs to fucking go
Jfc tucker is gonna score all the points aint he? Back to Flacco days
Lamar throwing it off his backfoot squarely into the ground with pressure straight up the middle.
"Feels like GRo is pulling the same move as the Game of Thrones writers by ""subverting expectations"" and having similar results."
These routes are fucking awful Dez was running into a safety
At there 22 yard line 3 point fan fucking tastic
Bring all receivers to within 5 yards of line of scrimmage and bring in our 4th string running back. Fucking clown Roman
Bryant was open. He isn‚Äôt going through his progressions properly.
This is starting to feel like the Flacco years with a three and out or field goal on every drive.
Nothing like some greg roman magic to kill the momentum. What were those plays??
That is the exact play call we all ask for and Lamar just didnt even look
"i gotta say, if your name is greg with a last name of roman, I hope I see you nowhere near our org next year"
There's no clearer evidence to fire Greg Roman than that drive right there. Defense gives you a short field and you don't capitalize? Get out of here.
"Literally 1 good play every 5 snaps. Roman is **garbage** anyone who defends him thinking he's calling a nice game is just delusional. And yes, I include you stupid ass pundits from Baltimore beatdown and these other dumb sites."
This o line is ass
Lamar is a problem you have a slant and man playing 10 yards off you go there every single play every single time always and forever
"If only there was a player who was eating up chunks of yards that we could play. It's like they don't want to disrespect Gus/Ingram, but Dobbins has been electric on every play."
god dobbins rips off two great runs and they take him out for the rest of the drive lmao
Fuck RB by committee. JK is the only one doing shit out there.
Yo we got some points on the board could‚Äôve been worse. But fuck you Greg Roman
Greg Roman‚Äôs playcalling is trash. Thank God we can at least get into Tucker‚Äôs range
Greg Roman is the guy that selects random plays in Madden
Fuck the titans
"Front 7 is locking in, great job"
Brown runs an incredible route because he pushed Humphrey 5 yards off him.
"""Brown runs an incredible route!""

As they show a full extension push off on replay."
"Feel the momentum shifting here.  

2nd half is gonna be fun to watch."
"So I'm convinced Romo doesn't know who McPhee is, this is the second time now he has called him Judon"
"Just feed Dobbins Roman, pls you dumb mother fucker"
SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ACTUALLY PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS?
Hold up..... The dolphins 6-3????
Lamar needs to throw that sooner
Its just andrews he is our wr core
"that was a risky play call considering none of our receivers can catch reliably

Thank god Andrews caught that"
Thank god my dogs name isn‚Äôt Greg. He‚Äôd be beside me all game.
Punch it in with Dobbins let‚Äôs go
Give it to dobbins
I bet you we try to throw it....
Let‚Äôs run the wildcat to Ingram!!! /s
Feed dobbins for the rest of the game. Stop the other shit
Roman appears to have caught on to the fact that he has a good running back he hasn‚Äôt used
"I love how Dobbins after his good runs looks at the air like ""I told y'all to leave me in"""
Can we finally start feeding Dobbins as the #1? He clearly is that.
This officiating this year literally is turning me into a conspiracy theorist. Like how do we get fucked over and over again
NFL has become such a fucking slow product man.
The Baltimore Robbing Dobbins. Thanks Jim!
Dobbins got me throbbin
#JK ALL GODDAMN MOTHERFUCKING DAY INJECT IT INTO MY VEINNNNNNS
Dobbins leading the league in awkward touchdown celebrations
JK BUT HE AINT KIDDING!!!!
Bruh our kickoff unit is murdering them on special teams lmao
"Hey we already surpassed our total number of points in the divisional game 

*cries in corner*"
Humph gonna be getting clowned for that Tannehill juke
Queen sat up like the undertaker lmao
Lmao Harbs has got to be calling these kicks short on purpose. That boy is getting FUCKED up every time lol
Queen isn‚Äôt badly hurt just looked like his nose got fucked up maybe broken
Painful hit. These guys are tough. He‚Äôll be okay. Adrenaline will keep him going.
Tannahill has the longest run of the game...
I hate when I'm watching commercials and they cut in with 30 seconds of football
Of course they get an auto first down
That wasn‚Äôt low. Fuck you Romo
That was not low.  It was at the waist
FUCKING REFBALL EVERY TIME MAN
Ref ball again!
He hit him at the waist and fell down to the legs... that's not a penalty.
Horseshit call
How the fuck was that going low
Weakest fucking call. That was right in the chest
What the fuck that wasn't late or low
Yay refs fucking us again
Holy fuck this penalty shit gotta stop I feel like we get a god damn roughing every game on a 3rd down stop
"Good thing we‚Äôre the most penalised team in the league, makes it easier to win games"
"When you stop Henry this team is very different, then they have to rely on on their QB"
Yannick has been huge for us we can actually run 4 man pass rushers now
Mask goes over your nose Jackson
They gave Yannick the sack!!!
Yannick having a hell of a game
Ngakoue is ballin out
Good shit D. Good way to end that bullshit drive
Ngucci is playing possessed now! I love it
The one time Gost doesnt miss smfh
Yannic showing out!
Yannick just earned his contract
I knew that was a fumble live reminded of the 2010 pit playoff game. What were we doing
Shit hope hes ok
Wish we had performed better in the red zone
"Guys, giving to Dobbins is our best play lol."
Why we running the ball with 48 seconds left?
Last year we would‚Äôve at least attempted to go for a score
Roman showing he cant dial up passes here lmao. 50 seconds and a timeout and thats what you do? Lame af
"Man, yoy gotta feel bad if your the guy who caused the injury too."
That injury was so fucking gross
"**Primo Halftime Content (funny, i promise)**

[Dramatic Gopher Leads to Missed Field Goal (Minnesota Gophers)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01pLMqaQKzI&feature=share)"
Same hit as McPhee both legal
We need a TD on this drive here
This defense will be back to tops in the league when the D Line gets healthy
"Great Stop D, Lets get long surgical drive with a TD at the end of it!!!"
"That's some classic Ravens defense, I love it so much."
Guys I‚Äôm happy to report I‚Äôm behind the bar smoking so we‚Äôll get a touchdown
What up to all the lurking titan fans that are already rattled unnerved by injury ridden Ravens defense.
THROW UP THE MFING X
Dez looks hyped
DEZ GOT A CATCH!!
Yo if DEZ balls out fuck him and Andrew's would be lit
Lmao cry more Vrabel you fucking pussy
Romo low key reading this sub
# FREE DOBBY
I love Dobbins talking shit. Someone gotta have swagger on offense.
Man it feels so weird getting penalty calls against the other team now
Where the fuck the complainers at? Y‚Äôall loud when we have one bad series
Also Shoutout Mekari playing a solid game
What a fucjing dime god.damn
Hollywood pulled the safety to the middle and got Andrews wide open. Big play
LAMAAAARRRR
"Now lets get out there, get some revenge for last year. Time to put Tannehil on the ground"
Mandrews is cooking again boys
This is the LJ I know and support on GameDay
GO STAND ON THE SHIELD NOW YOU FUCKING PUSSYS
"Holy üí© what a play, throw and drive! Way to respond!"
ANDREWSSSSS!!!!!
"I love Edwards as a short yard to gain back but I really feel they need to keep feeding JK for the main load. Especially going against teams that are gonna stack the box and much as I loved the presence of Ingram on the team last year, he just hasn‚Äôt been the same runner this year but is still a solid blocker in the backfield"
"Glad we finally gave Jk the nod today, starting to look better. Lets go put up another one"
Joe Burrow may be seriously hurt. His left leg got bent sideways when getting hit. Guy from Washington was frantically calling trainers over.
OMFG I love Lamar for that
Lmao Lamar gave him the shoulder! He loves Harbs
Fuck Malcom Butler! Hahaha Lamar is a bad ass
Lmao Lamar is petty AF
I LOVE THAT LAMAR FUCK BUTLER
Oh yeah that‚Äôs Savage Lamar standing up for our coach!
THATS MY QB
Elliott just dethroned King Henry there
did anyone clip that Lamar thing? I want is plastered everywhere
Who was looking for that Lamar hatred? Butler just got a shoulder from him after that TD. Absolutely deserved
Earl Thomas could never
Bro elliot is a lunatic out there
Holy hold man wtf
Huge hold yet again. How do they miss these
I can see the holding on this bullshit 56k 720p bootleg stream!!!!
Genius play call with new center.  Did Roman switch sides at the half?
"#LMFAO


Leave that fancy shit to Kamara"
Henry been down BAD today
try that fuck shit and get fucked.ü§£
marlon going for the strip. Things you love to see
WE SMOKING ON TITANS PACK
We switch offensive coordinators lol
Look like Roman is calling plays for the Titans.
Side note: Burrow took a nasty hit. Probably season ending
Can someone tell Roman to keep running it?
I feel like we're seeing the start of a new rivalry here
"How is that Wendy's chicken sandwich ""new"" if it's ""classic""?"
Damn not Joey man üò≠üò≠
Oh shit.  Prayers for Burrow!
Can you really just wrestle a guy down by his head? Cuz that's what they just did to Dez Bryant.
How was that not a call?
WTF Duvernay??????? Completely stopped on tbe route
The fuck is duvernay doing
See our plays were working so Roman had to change it up
"That deep shot shoulda been for Dez. 

I dont trust our receivers except Andrews making that catch."
Why did Duvernay stop so short? Looks like he misjudged the ball completely.
You see wideouts all over the league at least make a play on the ball. We have to fight for the ball!
This is why greg roman is not a good OC. Literally why a deep pass on 1st when you need to burn clock
#Let Dez run deep you coward
Who gives a fuck who it was on get em next time. It's on both of them for all anybody should care
Almost identical numbers to Ryan Tannehill on a bad day. Bleh.
"jesus the titans are even more injured than us, damn"
I‚Äôm past the point of caring what it looks like this week. Just win the game
Pleaseeeee don't choke here
Elliott‚Äôs gonna hurt himself if he keeps hitting like that
ANOTHER DL INJURED COME ON
That interception was killer
Vrabel loves the dick nose
Wolfe is back
Designed runs please.
"Drain the clock, run the fucking ball. Dobbins"
Why the fuck are we running Lamar? These plays don't fucking work. Waste of a down.
"Dude, they are playing 10 yards off. Just keeping throwing those quick routes to dez. Lamar run why"
Clutch throw
NEED IV SNEAD
Butler screams ‚Äúbig cuck energy‚Äù
Hollywood *non existent*
Thought he got it.
You gotta love RGIII
These refs are actual morons
"""It is really close"" which is BS for this call is fucking bs"
Are these refs hungover or something?
Jesus Christ Lamar.
"wide open, shit pass"
All those cameras and no clear view
cmon lamar... goddamn it.
"We fucked up, shouldn't be there. But that spot was SHIT. THE. FIX. IS. IN."
Wolfe breaking OUT today.
Fuck doomers in this thread
Peters is struggling today
"Lamar could've easily iced this if he had executed, but nope........hang the D out to dry instead"
"no tackling, nice"
Why is a 4th string lb covering their best wr
FUCKING TACKLE HIM HOW ARE WE SO SOFT MY GOD
Fuck this team. This team is done. Stick a fork in them. That was a fucking disgrace.
Lmfao this defense is so goddamn soft
You‚Äôd think the ravens players were trying to push him into the endzone üòÇ
Repeat of steelers game. This team needs major changes to coaching staff
This defense is the softest of all time. That was the worst tackling I've ever seen
What in the fuck
this D is obsessed with stripping the ball. Fucking tackle him
That should‚Äôve been an easy stop
"100% deserve to lose this game. It's fucking laughable. We will be lucky to finish 8-8, might get wins against Jax, Dal, or NYG, but I bet we drop one of those."
Good job defense. Fuck off
Hollywood could never do that
"This is not a playoff team, if you think so, I want what you're on."
Pain I‚Äôm in pain.
we're either getting a secondary/tackling blame of the game or a mandrews/LJ player of the game
I want this offense to go down and have a clutch game winning drive. Last one was SF last year. That game showed we could grit it out.
Lamar needs to go win this game. Period.
"We're out of the playoff picture once we lose this game and then play the undefeated Steelers next week.

I'm so disappointed in this team. How humiliating to let them come here and dance all over our logo and then they just punch us in the mouth at the end too."
"I hate to say it, but this will be Lamar's defining moment. Win and it's proof he'll be able to lead. Lose, and it will always be questioned if he has what it takes to win in close games. It obviously doesn't help he's a one man army but better QBs have done more with less."
Of course Soulja would‚Äôve had a TD but there‚Äôs a flag lmao
I'd do anything for Dez to get the game winner.
"What the fuck, Mekari?

An empty stadium and you snap and surprise even the QB?"
Please let us get the ball.
Good on Lamar for not forcing a pass
"Why the fuck did we not go for the 1st and goal, holy shit this coaching staff is awful"
Why can‚Äôt we just score a TD. My blood pressure needs to go down
Our defense needs to pull their pants up because last drive was an embarrassment.
We need the coin toss or else we lose
MY HEART IS BEATING
Hollywood owes us something if we go to over time
Would love for Dez to poster Butler for a game-winning TD
"Hollywood Brown. ZERO receptions.

But hey, go off kid. Keep those tweets coming."
WE WON DAT TOSS
Lets get a fucking TD please
Here we go. First possession TD for Dez.
Go go Lamar u got this.
That play call is rolling over fucking pussy shit
Here comes Henry
PATHETIC. THESE read options are not working on first down and just kill the drive man. Fuck this
Fire. Greg. Roman.
Our D aint stopping shit lol
You throw a dump off. On your own 25. On 3&17.
Corey Davis is getting so open; how is this happening?
Fire Greg Roman
Hollywood is just John Ross tbh
That was a fucking pathetic display. Up by 11 and just got bullied
lol this team a joke
I never want to see someone call people who have complaints a fake fan ever again
Another hard to watch game. This is classic ravens.
Why do I even bother watching anymore we can‚Äôt do anything in clutch time
This looks like mental issues. Something has to happen at the top.
Season is over.
Here is the sad part. Our ‚Äúfans‚Äù will continue defense these Ravens.
Many people need to be fired starting with Greg Roman‚Äôs dumb ass
Ok marlon has not looked like himself since he came back. He has had no fire or heart. Marcus is just Marcus and is verrry overrated.
Someone needs to wake this team the fuck up.
"Everyone's hating that deep shot, but like I don't think it was a bad call. Almost had a killshot completion. Duvernay just couldn't quite get his head around. Not the end of the world."
Genuinely bad throw on that really well designed play to Andrews.
Dez was fucking open.
Buckle up guys.  Should be a fun finish
Lamar keeps missing these throws
This team is fucking soft.
Just put Dez in. He‚Äôs probably honestly our best receiver.
God damn can Romo stop deepthroating the Titans so hard?
"We're bailing them out this drive and of course a bullshit RTP. I'm gonna be heated if they get a TD on this drive.

Henry's hair is fucking ugly as fuck too."
"Damn y'all wanted to dance on a logo now a mf's arm gets broke. Speedy recovery, cuzzo üò¨"
Defence can‚Äôt make a stop and this sub blames Lamar lmao
Thanks vrabel
Skura benched? Damn
Only team that gets called oline holding.
Legit PI guys come on
get ready for penalties all day boys
Jim Nantz wants Romo money and can‚Äôt even say Marlo‚Äôs name right
This coaching staff is gonna abuse our blitzes but you know we aren‚Äôt gonna change it
Wink's blitzing on 3rd and long is so fucking annoying.
"""the most tight ends among all tight ends"""
This team just doesn‚Äôt look like the ravens anymore. Week after week. Same shit
Offense needs to ball out
"So a new book on the ravens defense.  Scheme for a speedy WR to get a bunch of jet sweep type plays.

KC, Hardman

Indy, Harris

Tenn, Batson"
IDGAF we still winning fuck the titans
This is the 8th consecutive game where the game thread is saying we are over reacting and ‚Äúits only 2 drives‚Äù. This shits been a problem for weeks. We aren‚Äôt that good.
What happened in the beginning of the game between us? Harbs was fired up.
Malcom butler a lil bitch
Lol soldier
Fuck Hollywood.
Im fucking done with Brown. Get the fuck out of here. You're trash.
What a fucking Soulja
"Yeah, tell me again how great Hollywood Brown is. Dude is a straight up bum."
When you try to use your souljas....
"Hollywood plays too scared, you could see the moment the ball touches his hands hes looking for the closest defender"
Man Hollywood ain't shit
Soulja
Hollywood butter fingers Brown
What's the point of having Soliders that drop the fucking ball
Fuck you Roman. FUCK YOU
#There goes our SOULJA dropping a catch again
Douvernay over the Soulja
Dobbins need to be #1.
Marquise Brown sucks. He FUCKING sucks.
"Yo, we need to bench Ingram, he looks washed. Love the guy but it isn‚Äôt working"
Underrated positive thing: OBJ has stepped up at LT
Hollywood perception: future all pro  -> potential star -> under utilized -> just a bust?
Damn that would‚Äôve been an awesome TD
We didnt execute but that is a great play call
The ref looks like Rich Eisen
"Heroic play there, tough"
FGs not gonna be enough if our defense stays limp
The bengals beat the Titans. What do they have that we don‚Äôt?
That was a good drive bros
Hill oh my god
THATS HOW YOU TACKLE
"Justice Hill

FUCK YEAH"
Wait that was Justice Fucking Hill? Put him in at LB idgaf
Justice Hill has the fire.
Harrison is a really promising player. He‚Äôs an absolute force taking on blockers
FUCKING HUUUUGE
Good hit by Queen.
That hit tho
Queen fucked Tannehill up too DAMN
Bowser has been one of our best players in silence
BIG PLAY LETS GOOO
##WHAT WE NEEDED
"Wow, Queen has elite speed!"
QUEEN
Wink also deserves credit on that beautiful cover blitz play
Now y‚Äôall love queen again eh? Lol
"Roman, fuck you, keep it simple stupid. Dobbins getting 6 yards a carry and you put us right back in empty, fuck empty omg"
We take Dobbins out for that bs play.. cmon Roman!
That rollout was fine but no WR made any move to get open
We NEED a change at OC
Dez was open......
Outside of Dobbins this offense is tortuous to watch. My god.
This is why Roman needs to go
The redzone offense makes me wanna fucking throw up
1st and goal used to be a guarenteed TD. This offense has fallen so fucking far from last year.
"MAN OUR RECIVERS SUCK AND GREG ROMAN CANT SCEME THEM, CANT EVEN USE DOBBINS"
FUCK YOU GREG ROMAN
Greg Roman was an inside job.
Why don't we keep passing with our God awful Oline while we're at it too. Let's just run it until we get close then get stuffed because we want to pass it in
"Dude was tackling Snead for before Lamar even threw the ball. If you‚Äôre gonna to call it, call it for both sides."
Holy shit fuck you roman
In the redzone you don't even have him LOOK at Dez in his progression? It's that shit that drives me crazy in this scheme.
Those last 3 plays sum up what's wrong with the offense this year
Roman needs to go this is inexcusable
does anybody honestly believe we shouldn't clean house after this year with the coaches and coordinators?
"Just so we are clear the RB coach decides which RB should be on the field....and he should be fired.

You don't take Dobbins out there."
Why did Greg Roman take out JK . He was feasting
"I know its a joke, but I will seriously do a better job calling the plays. Read Dives and Powers with Dobbins until they stop it, 0 empty set. No cute shit, who says no"
"This isn‚Äôt even about gameplan anymore. This is all mental now. It‚Äôs in their heads. No confidence, all panic."
We get ONE year of great offense and it's back to the normal disappointing performance.
"MAN OUR RECIVERS SUCK AND GREG ROMAN CANT SCEME THEM, CANT EVEN USE DOBBINS"
Lamar didn‚Äôt even look at the left side of the field bruh
Roman said this offense was going to change substantially? Fuck it‚Äôs changed it‚Äôs even worse!
LETS GIVE DOBBINS THE BALL MORE GREG ROMAN HE IS HOT.
Time for Greggy boy to update the ole resume. What a train-wreck.
Great play of Defense and we can't give them any scoring support.   Something has to give
"This play should've been the 1st down play. Quick pass to Dez, let him get a few yards. Then run it in. But no, we need to do some bullshit that goes nowhere first"
Dude justice hill honesty might play some defensive snaps if he keeps this shit up
"If that redzone trip wasn‚Äôt the perfect microcosm of Greg Roman, idk what is"
At least Justice Hill is playing like an animal on ST.
Maybe Justice Hill should play defense lol
Justice Hill with another great tackle put him in at LB
Honestly the caution tape for an OLine and butterfingers receivers are really a testament to how good Lamar is
Justice Hill future HOF linebacker.
"Justice Hill is awesome on special teams.

Justice Hill sucks as a running back.

Please no more Justice Hill on offense. Stick to using him where he's actually good."
I just want Harbaugh to be real with the fans. If you keep GRo it‚Äôs because you think this is Lamar‚Äôs ceiling. And it sure as hell isnt
Covert Hill to a db???üòÇ
#GetOffTheField
"Wait, Henry is the only guy in the NFL averaging over 100 yards per game for RBs right now? That seems hard to believe."
Does Derrick Henry‚Äôs hair piss anyone else off or just me
ROMAN PUT IN JK YOU FUCKING IDIOT
Please keep feeding jk please coaches be smart Ingram doesn‚Äôt have juice anymore and Gus is the power back
"Thats an 11 yard run by Dobbins. If Roman takes him out, he absolutely needs to go. No fucking excuse."
"JK is such a beast man.  Great vision, elusive, and extremely explosive."
JK is the best RB on the field today.
"Dobbins is getting four or five yards on plays Ingram would get hit in the backfield. It's black & white, Dobbins should be our starter."
Dobbins needs the ball ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
A bigger WR gets that
Unpopular opinion dobbins should be starter over Ingram
Fuck it throw it to Andrews or give it to dobbins all game
Has dobbins had a single rush under 3-4 yds this game?
Lol @ you guys bitching about a play call that worked.
Great drive but why do all our route concepts have to be right on top of each other. There were 3 receivers in frame when Andrews caught that ball.
I just *love* that I can‚Äôt watch the game because bitch ass Washington is on cbs :/
"Yall ready for Roman to call some complicated bullshit on first down for a loss, incompletion/drop second down, Throw away third down, Lamar stopped on obvious keep 4th down.

Quote me."
What he definitely had the first down or am I all wrong?
That‚Äôs not a TD but it is a fucking 1st down
Great drive called by Greg Roman.
Dobbins. Imagine that. Looking at you Roman
THAT WAS A 1ST
Is dobbins officially the starter yet?
I‚Äôm blue Dobbins dee Dobbins Die!
WOW AMAZING YOUR CLEAR RB1 SCORES A TD AMAZING AMAZING WHO WOULDA THUNK IT
Dobbins you are ray rice 2.0 thank you
Dobbins is our #1 RB
JK is our RB. Full stop.
Give the man 50 carries a game I think he‚Äôd still want more üòÇ
Titans with the late hits.......ok
KING DOBBINS. FUCK A D. HENRY
Just rush it in with Dobbins again for the 2-point conversion lol
Anyone else feel like 49 came in just a tad late there or am I nitpicking?
My cat will only watch Ravens games and I seriously think it‚Äôs because he thinks Lamar is a spider
Let‚Äôs fucking go. All day dobbins
We might have officially just seen the changing of the guard.
THROBBIN FOR DOBBINS
Lamar and JK are going to be nightmare fuel for defenses.
I think Harbaugh is starting to get on the Dobbins train now
That poor titans returner is going to be so sore tomorrow
Yo we be trynna kill these returnersüòÇ
Dobbins has us throbbin
Looks like Dobbins is the x factor and him not being in every play will be big dumb
I know Dez hasn‚Äôt had a catch. But have seen him hyping up and congratulating teammates multiple times. Nice to see a great attitude out of him
Did queen bang tracy?
Ouch that ones gotta hurt.
Damn romo really not holding back on that one
Please god save the Queen
"Ngakoue gets pressure man, may not have the sacks rn but Im glad we have him."
"If that were the Ravens, it would have been spotted a yard off."
"Fuck Brown, how about calling a great play by Fort?"
Fuck that rule man
yeah i get protect the qb but fuck no is that a foul
"Fuck that, not low"
SOFT
That's shit man
Fucking bullshit call by the refs jesus
Refball
"So the titans also have a receiver named Brown who drops passes?

Nice"
injuries and refs taking their toll
WEAK AF ROUGHING
Titans look a little flustered
If belly is low and head is high. Do you hit him in the diaphragm?
Let‚Äôs get a pick. Fuck the refs
I understand changing Roughing the Passer to help the safety of QBs but like the extent to where you cant touch a QB is ridiculous now
"**LJ Fort** gets my ""Unsung Hero"" vote this year"
PLAY TO THE WHISTLE why are we not sprinting at that ball
"Yannick is starting to show up after a couple quiet games. When this team get's healthy again, it going to be scary."
NGAKOUEEEEEE
BIG time props to our defense so far they‚Äôve been ballin
Okay let‚Äôs do our 48 second drill
The refs gave Tennessee a FG and robbed us of a possession.
YANNICK! He's fired up today.
Lmao so we're not even trying to score after calling 2 timeouts?
[deleted]
Hope hes alright
Looks painful. Hope it‚Äôs nothing too serious!
does anyone know why injuries are happening so frequently this year??
"I understand playing is safe, but c'mon, perfect time to take a couple shots down field"
That‚Äôs nasty
Dobbins jawing lol
Oh jesus that was awful
"After all these years, you'd think Harbaugh would know how to manage the clock and have a hurry up offense. Why run it? Just take a damn knee at this point"
I thought clipping was a low block from behind?
Who gets ball to start the 2nd half? Titans?
Ravens good Titans bad
Lamar needs to come out and make some more of these throws to really put this one away. Show them that this Vrabel defense doesn't work against him anymore.
No offense but eagles games are so boring bro lmao
What a read by Elliot there.
Please don't lay an egg here on offense
Wolfe Bowser and Ellis have played so surprisingly well
Now eat some damn clock!
update: this mexican food got spicy af
"Dez catches- 1
Hollywood catches- 0
Dez > Hollywood"
WOOOO DEZ TALKING TRASH BRO!
DOBBINS IS OUR LORD AND SAVIOR
Vrabel crying on the sideline
Holy shit so this is how it feels to have penalties go our way!!!
I would absolutely love for Dez to score a TD on Butler.
Sticking it up their ass and thrusting!
Andrews is a soldier
Yes Jackson that is what the fuck i'm talking about
LET'S GOOOOO. FUCK YEAH
Mandrews is top 3 Te's fight me
This is what happens when Lamar has time to throw. Let's go boys!
I'm loving this OL combo they have out here.
FUCK THESE OLD SAGGY TITS
That's a FUCKING throw my GOD let's go
Eat a chode Malcolm Butler
The salt in Titans gamethread is making me sooooo happy right now!
LAMAR LMFAOOOOOO
lol @ Lamar bonking Butler
"&#x200B;

Malcolm Butler is a punk"
Get him Lamar lol
Love that from Lamar!
The shoulder check to Butler from LJ...I see it
Lmfao Lamar throwing heavy shade. Fuck outta my way
Hate the Titans but the league is worse when franchise guys like Henry go down
"Last year he made are Free safety his lead blocker, not this year"
Hope Henry is okay but holy fuck Deshon i love you
SUCK IT YOU FUCK
Way to step up Elliot
"Earl Thomas tackling Henry: nope nope nope nope

DeShon Elliott tackling Henry: I will destroy you"
EARL THOMAS WOULD NEVER
Big ass baby. Deshaun is what ET3 promised.
Deshon >>>>>>> Earl
Elliot out here destroying these dudes wtf lol
Refs refuse to call holding omg
 Did we trade skura to the titans?
Dude held so hard he hurt himself
Nice when the other team fucks a snap hahaha
lmaoooooooooooo
Been a while since I‚Äôve been fired up but the Titans are a bunch of bitches
Skura playing for the Titans now
HA HAAAAAAAAAAA GOD YOU HATE TO SEE IT
That snap was launched into the stratosphere
Hahaha suck our collective ass Tennessee
Titian‚Äôs sub people are hoping they take some dirty shot at Lamar. What a piece of shit group of fans.
Butler is so fake hard LMFAOO
DEZ IS MAKING ME HORNY
Very hostile indeed
I‚Äôm definitely done with the Hollywood experiment dudes a literal Chihuahua this seasonüíÄ
"Lamar has the first down and then just moves laterally for no reason, come on man"
Did Simmons just shoulder shrug Dez? Asswipe
#DAMMIT ROMAN WHY
Dez reminds me of Derrick Mason
Lamar with the arm punt
Just run the damn ball
"That‚Äôs not a great throw, but that‚Äôs on Duvernay IMO, he got turned around 2x"
only good thing is that was basically a punt
"Lamar playing gutsy, don't mind the arm punt too much. Would really have liked us to widen the lead though"
What is actually supposed to happen on that play? Because I saw two people just standing there waiting for the ball to come to them.
Should have be running the ball more at this point to eat clock.
idk if that was on Lamar or Duv but someone was way off
No reason for a 50-50 there but what the flying fuck is Duvernay doing just stopping?
"Everyone talking shit on the play call, honestly taking a deep shot on first down isn‚Äôt a bad idea, we just need to execute it. Maybe throw it to someone over 5‚Äô10 too."
Joe Flacco would be very proud of that throw.
Lamar with the arm punt
Front 7 shows up and our DBs take the day off
man fuck cbs for putting on the trash football team instead
Come on man do not let then back in this
"Lol elliott no need for the big hit, just get him down."
It's sad when you just straight give them momentum man
There goes our d line
Turnover would be nice but the offense needs to finish this game
"""You cant have a D-line this year""

- God"
Come on boys. Great to keep them to 3.
Milk the clock with dobbins and win this please greg
"It's not so much the concept. The play-action bomb was fine. We need to use the play action still.

It's just how shittily executed it was at the worst possible time."
Please for the love of god. Please score
"Handoff to Dobbins, screen to Dobbins, repeat."
Can‚Äôt run Lamar to the outside. Use Dobbins
Missed block. Looked like Skura
Snead didn‚Äôt run the route 1 yard short! Surprised.
Lmaoooo Snead teasing em
That speed option is the worst play in our book. It literally never works.
Fuck the titans
I really want to see Dez get something that's not a screen pass
"For some reason, the Jackson run plays feel very predictable. They were always so sneaky with them last year."
Bad spot
lost the challenge somehow
LOL the refs are fucking bias dudd
So sick of these FUCKING penalties holy SHIT
Oh god please don‚Äôt blow this game
"* BULL SHIT
* BULL SHIT
* BULL SHIT
* BULL SHIT"
"The refs are against us that‚Äôs it, ever since harbs went off. I‚Äôm convinced, I was mostly joking before but now no way."
"Typical of this team, shoot themselves in the foot with penalties exactly when they can't afford to do so..."
"terrible spot, soft false start, oooh a makeup call after a punt that is worthless"
Imagine having receivers who could catch
We could really use a Fruit Punch here
The reffing this year has honestly made every game hard to enjoy
Someone needs to make a big play. Yannick almost got one there
They have like one starting linemen left and we stop blitzing
Everyone ready for Henry to go in with 20s left?
CAN WE PLEASE STOP THEM. FFS
This defense is absolutely crumbling
How cool would it be to be able to move the ball like that in crunch time
Ravens playing two hand touch
This is so hilariously familiar. It's like watching a replay.
Our secondary level tackling is fucking unbelievable.
Let's finish this game how we started: shit defense that can't stop anything with an offense that goes nowehere.
What the fuck was that
"WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO STRIP IT ON 3RD AND LONG WHEN YOU HAD HIM WRAPPED UP. 

FINISH THE FUCKING TACKLE"
"Wow, bunch of arm tackling pussies"
FUCKING PATHETIC
"Bro, literally the worst tackling I've ever seen. Soft ass defense."
"Embarrassing. All day long we have been weak on our tackles. 

Peters has been absolutely low effort all day."
"That was seriously the worst defensive play I have seen this season, pathetic"
IT WAS 3rd and long just tackle him why are you trying to strip
"Nah don't tackle him, don't worry about it."
"That was easily the worst defensive drive we've had all year. They just bullied us. No luck involved, no foul play, we got beat bad"
"As someone who used to play rugby, i will die on the hill that NFL players are dog shit at tackling"
"We've contained Henry pretty well, even with injuries they're still winning 

Can we PLEASE fire Roman now, i'm so sick of his shit"
We need a Lamar game winning drive. We NEED it.
yea this team ain‚Äôt winning a Super Bowl
"Want some redemption, mr jackson? Please take it."
3 uninspired Roman passes incoming.
Lamar has had to lead potential game winning drives in like 3 of the last 4
That fumble by Snead had my heart in my throat
Refs woulda let tanner have that snap. He's been at zero plenty today
Just a reminder your supposed to playing your best ball in November/December yet every week we look slightly worse
This team post bye week has been fuckin brutal to watch man lmao
Defense has been outplayed in the second half
come on lamar reigning mvp for a reason
I just want to prove the haters wrong for ONCE
Don‚Äôt want to go to OT against this team. Touchdown let‚Äôs go
"Weird. We let Lamar do Lamar things, we get production on offense. Who knew."
Romo loves Dezz die hard
That was a TD
Dez ‚ÄúAnquan‚Äù Bryant
I want a Dez TD so bad
Dez looked open in the end zone
Andrews was open tho... smh
illegal contact on brown in endzone of course it is missed
I swear Snead was wide open on the slant
I hope we get the ball first I don‚Äôt trust that defense at all right now
False starts come down to coaching. We had a TD right there.
Had Mark Andrews wide open on that 3rd down
Thought you couldn‚Äôt touch the snapper on a kick üôÑ
"We have played so much better than the titans, can‚Äôt believe we are in ot"
"an OT game with the Steelers waiting for us on Thursday, lol"
"I can‚Äôt think of a team with worse starting wideouts, and one of ours is a first round pick"
WIN THE TOSS
LETS GO END THIS LAMAR
Goal line fade to Dez for the dub üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
JUDON WITH HIS BIGGEST PLAY OF THE YEAR
Judon with the best Ravens play on a contested toss all game
Diarrhea
Fucking quitter mentality. Roman can get fucked
"Nice we won the toss!

Immediate sack and three and out

Why do I expect different"
Our DBs have been quite horrible today.
I don‚Äôt know why I waste my Sunday afternoons on this team
Marlon was soooo far off his man that mp was closer
Imagine getting to the highest football league in the world as a defensive player without knowing how to tackle
"Fire Roman man, idc anymore this team needs a fire under its ass"
If we stopped choking games away we‚Äôd be 8-1 right now
"queen failed on that play. if he breaks, that's a pick6"
"Just not a playoff team, no O line and not enough talent on offense, defense injured and cant get a stop when needed"
Yep keep blitzing they‚Äôve been throwing quick all day smh
"Fuck me, tits fans def seem like the type to bombard our sub to"
"At this point I don‚Äôt even wanna make the playoffs, we aren‚Äôt doing shit if we make it and we need the better picks"
Genuinely hurts watching us go down like this. Tough year gets tougher.
These dudes moms raised some bitches straight up.
we fucking suck. I don't even want to make the playoffs to watch us put this heartless team on the field
Unfucking believeable. What a soft team.
They seem to have our number. I hate the Titans.
Very disappointed in our coverage team today. Oh well. On to the next...
Somebody needs to be fired. A change has to be made. This is too fuckin unacceptable
Defense is straight dogshit
What a fitting way for this utterly gutless team to lose it.
"We are frauds. But wait, we're not proper fans if we think that!"
Only 4 days until we get shit on for the world to see again
3 Ls in a row is absolutely unacceptable. So frustrated with this fucking team. I sat through worse stretches and wasn't this frustrated. Get it to fucking together.
Why can‚Äôt ravens get a 6‚Äô4 225lb WR like every fucking team in the nfl
Our defense is a complete fucking embarrassment
Yeah Marquise Brown needs to produce or we trade him in offseason
"Ingram YPC: 1.7

Dobbins YPC: like 6

Let's feed Ingram - Roman probably"
"This drive was 100% on Greg fucking Roman, what a fucking retard!!!! üò§üò§üò§üò§"
"Somebody who is good at math/stats needs to crunch the numbers with these penalty calls, there has to be a statistically significant slew against the Ravens"
Duvernay looks lost.  That was not on Lamar.
That was just the worst fucking time to turn it over man
[deleted]
"Has the ""soulja"" even had a catch this game?"
Fuck any team hosting fans while the pandemic is blowing up
"Mark Clayton, Travis Taylor, Torrey Smith, Perriman, Hollywood. What a mediocre history at drafted WRs."
I'll be honest we are being kind of bailed out by Tennessee play calling too. We have not covered well on play action they've just had some drops.
"My dog got into the cat food the other day,  when I took her outside,  her shit looked exactly like Derek Henrys hair."
"No calais campbell, no Brandon Williams.....

expected result tbh


EDIT: No interior pressure due to those guys missing means they can adjust to our blitz."
If we recovered it it would have been incomplete
His hand hit the QB isn‚Äôt that rushing the passer?
I want to see Malcolm Butler get fuck sticked.
Why does Henry's hair look like that old lady in the wheelchair from SpongeBob
The passing game has zero flow at all. Zero
"Yeah I don't care if I get downvoted for this, this team is a bunch of fucking chokers with no heart or grit."
"People will call you a doomer for being realistic, this team is not doing shit this year"
"MARCUS PETERS 4 INTS, 3 TDS, 6 SACKS

MARLON HUMPHREY 6 FF, 3 SACKS,"
"Fuck the Titans for that, as well as Vrabel. Good for Harbaugh telling them to fuck right off."
Fuck The Titans
Titans are officially scumbags in my eyes.. up there with the steelers and browns now.
BLACK JERSEYS BABY
FUCK THE TITANS
Dez on the field
DEZ caught it
Great start! This week will be different for sure
3 and out and a penalty? Nothing new here!
Thats a good call. Marlon had his hands all over him
Dez catch not going to be shown or reviewed? Cool.
this pass rush is dogshit
"His name is Humphrey not ""Humphries"""
Stop calling him Humphries...
Romo gives no respect to our team. Always mispronounces names
We have taken horrible angles to ball carriers all year.
"""Jonnu Smith who has the most tight ends among all tight ends"""
I honestly don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making the playoffs this year
yeah I don't see us winning this.  Our defense is dead. Our offensive line is mediocre.
There's so much wrong with this team.
That's the same exact play Jonnu scored on in the playoffs
"This game is going to be a tough watch. We cannot match up with them physically without Williams and Campbell. It is a damn shame, especially how much we‚Äôve been anticipating this matchup and how much they disrespected us in the pregame."
Once again penalties are fucking us
Can we please just play man coverage
It looks like the Titans are running the EXACT same Defense as last time
Lamar doesn‚Äôt run downhill anymore. Roman is ruining this guy
Not gonna lie I've seen absolutely enough of Ingram for the rest of the season.
Hollywood sucks
There‚Äôs our ‚Äúsoulja‚Äù
Brown talks shit about us not using him and then does that
I'm so tired of Hollywood brown dropping passes.
Soulja gets called to fight and drops the ball
Hollywood is a bust for a 1st rounder
If it wasn't for that evil Miles Boykin I bet Hollywood would've caught that.
SOLDIER
Getting tired of Brown.
Soulja Soulja Soulja Soulja
Imagine tweeting about your targets and dropping that ball lol
These souljas need to catch
"Wtf is Hollywood ""Soulja"" Brown doing there?"
UsE tHe SoUlJaS fuck you hollywood
Ingrams stats in this game gonna be like 20 carries for 45 yards aren‚Äôt they?
JK touches ball and first down happens. Can‚Äôt explain that!
How can the coaches see that type of explosion from Dobbins and continue wasting snaps with Ingram?
If jk could pass block he'd be a 3 down back
OH WOW CRAZY DOBBINS FOR 10+?!? We‚Äôll give it to Ingram this play
at least an answer
Roman watched how Fluker played last week and still let him start at RT this week...
Fluker is such ass
Don‚Äôt forget those 2 misses were over 60 yarders
"Seriously, how was that not PI on Byard?"
No RB is ever allowed to get into a rhythm because we bench them every other snap...
Jesus Christ Hill..
DAMN Justice Hill for Defense?
I pray our defense can hold...
Whoever runs our fake crowd noise is terrible. This sounds like a Titans home game most of the time.
Let hope the LBs play better this week.  Last week they were hitting the wrong gaps just about every long run play.
Nice Harrison
Malik is going to be a key on this D in the coming years
Love me some Queen but with our DL being what it is right now I greatly appreciate powerful LBs like Harrison.
That's your ILB!
Marlon stuck between the man and the ball but with a great recovery
#BOWSER
Need a TD!! No settling!
FUCK YEAH LETS GO
Now that's what I call a BIG TRUZZ
BOWSER LETS GO YOU STUD
There we go Queen and Bowser! LFG!
Bowser deserves more money than Judon lol
BOWSER!!!!!
I'm so so happy bowser is finally blooming! Please re-sign for cheap!!
McQueen üòÇ.
Finally we do something right!!
McQueen üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Good shit Bowser.
We smokin that tannehill pack üòà
Queen is an inconsistent guy because he's a rookie that has played the position for 2 years total. Love when he flashes like that though.
#Lightning McQueen!
Drop count at 3
Give dobbins ingram's snaps.
"ITS NOT JACKSON, ITS OUR RECIVING CORE"
"Feed JK touches, 20 carries"
The fuck kind of play call is that?
WHY. JUST LEAVE JK IN FUCK
Here comes Roman with overdoing it
with dobbins‚Äô production i don‚Äôt see how we could ever give ingram the ball. love him on the sideline but please
See what happens when Greg gets to cute? Takes out Dobbins and fucks up our drive with a shitty play
This is hard to comprehend. Honestly.
JFC what was that play calling
LET DEZ CATCH IT
DEZ. WUZ. OPEN
Whole drive fucked by horrible 1st and 2nd down execution.
How the fuck do you have justice hill on instead of jk
Good move taking Dobbins out Roman - Absolutely Nobody
Greg Roman has Justin Tucker in his fanasty team
Find the largest cannon we can find and fire Greg Romans obese ass out of it
Roman needs to go. Plain and simple. Those last three play calls were pathetic
how is it possible to make lamar Jackson look like Joe flacco
JK needs to be fed this game. Period.
I think it‚Äôs clear Lamar does not trust the oline. And he shouldn‚Äôt
Who is making the decision to pull RBs when they have the hot hand? Dobbins had no business on the sideline that drive
Fire. Greg. Roman.
Dez had a chance...bruh fuck this offense
We're not going to win kicking FGs. Not liking our Redzone offense so far. Plus...fucking KEEP DOBBINS IN.
Our playbook is full of dust and Lamar didn‚Äôt help either in this drive. Throw the ball
How does the other team know our plays when we don't?
That sequence after Dobbins taken out. Just wow!
Dobbins should not have come out. That was a wasted down and Roman needs to be smacked
Jk should not be taken off the field in the red zone holy shit
"Any coach would see the good player doing well and use them.

Our coaches: nah lol. Fucking change it up, that'll confuse em' for sure"
So justice hill is the new Chris Moore?
"Fuck it, switch Hill to safety at this point. Dude can HIT."
Justice Hill the new Chris Moore
"Give ball to Lamar
Give ball to Andrews
Give ball to Dobbins
Fuck everybody else

Ez win"
Do we pull the plug on Roman after this game or highly unlikely?
"Come on guys.  We made great plays, stop fighting out there damn..."
if he caught and they didn‚Äôt call OPI...
Love Proche man.
Can we get a 50 50 shot to Dez ?
Starting to develop a Patriots hatred with the Titans
Dobbins is such a beast
Dobbins 10 yard quick bench him roman
IT'S ALMOST LIKE DOBBINS IS GOOD ü§î
RAY K DOBBINS
this teams reluctance to using rookies needs to fucking GO AWAY get duvernay in there jk is fuckin shit up
ALL ABOARD THE DOBBINS TRAIN!!!
Dobbins gonna be our Henry for this game
FEED DOBBINS
Soulja
"I usually hate when people say this, and they‚Äôre obviously a very good team, but the Steelers are legit the worst 9-0 team I‚Äôve ever seen."
Much better Lamar - big time throw.
Lamar with DHop would be unstoppable. We waste so much fucking potential.
89 IS OUR SOULJA
Lamar just needs to do that...more consistently
LAMAR JACKONS IS MY QUARTERBACK FUCK YALL HATERS!!!!!!
Down at the 1 but amazing effort
Our nr 1 WR is a TE. Change my mind
3rd and Long - Call Four Verticals just like in Madden
At least we got the first down
"‚ÄúRicard just finished at the end of that play‚Äù
Oh my"
I wanna see DEZ go up for a ball dammit
Dobbins is getting 4-5 a clip. He's our starter going forward
THIRD??? THATS RIDICULOUS
What the fuck that's a terrible spot!  He definitely had the first down.
Feed fuckin JK
Dobbins deserved that one. He made this drive.
THATS A SOULJA
Fuck uhhhh the Titans?
That's a first down you fucks.
FUCK THE TITANS
bullshit thats clearly a first down
Refs keep reviewing and it‚Äôs just giving our D more rest
That block by Ricard though üëå
RUN THAT SCORE THE FUCK UP
Man Ricard made a huge block there
49 of Tennessee should have been flagged
I hope these refs have a very inconvenient day. Stub a toe. Sneeze inside their masks. Maybe shart a little.
JK is having his coming out!
That's right!! Feed him!!!
JK is the shit..fuck you Roman for realizing that sooner
The last 10 minutes has featured 2 plays and 100 commercials
"Love Ingram, but don't see how we keep him after this year sadly. Just doesn't have it anymore."
Good to see that Jimmy Kimmel is out there trying new things as a Ref
"All hail our lord and savior JK Dobbins, Buck Allen is smiling down on you"
Sweet 2 point play
thats 14 the hard way
"the 2 point conversion is no good....

#JK"
Go in JK!!!!!
Roman just discovered Dobbins
Turns out JK is the real soulja all along
"Okay, this is Dobbins' team now

FEED MY MAN"
"Good. They‚Äôve realized Dobbins is the man, keep using him like that"
I like Hollywood but this is how you prove you should be used more. Dobbins is playing with FIRE and taking advantage of the opportunities
That coulda been flagged we lucky
Marlon gonna get roasted for getting juked by Tannehill lol
Holy shit. One of these titan returners is going to die out there today
God hates the Ravens
That‚Äôs a painful play but not enough to keep him out of the game.
All these commercials...
Oh hes fine
"Damn Queen, we can not afford to lose anymore players. Hopefully its just some cuts and scrapes. Be back for next half."
"Ouch, hope he's good to keep playing."
Yannick with the instant pressure!! There we go!
Titans receivers a bunch of Souljas!
Weak ass call
That seemed neither low nor late
God roughing the passer has changed so much than what Im used to
That is a bullshit call
"eating mexican food rn, its so good"
That horseshit call is going to give the Titans 7 and prevent us from getting the ball back with any real shot before half.
I fucking hate Tony Romo
YANNICK SIGHTING
Why did no one run for that fumble? I swear they always run for it when its actually incomplete
If youve been paying attention to Yannick this game hes been incredible like every play
Yannick got off again
Yannick is destroying their LT
That‚Äôs it Ngakoue lad
Yannick not getting the sack but really really good at disrupting
Titans having all kinds of problems with Ngakoue
91‚Äôs starting to take over
Lets get a big return here Duv
Yannick looks so good today
The Browns only scored off a Wentz pick 6 wtf?
Yannick having a huge game.
We not going go for the field goal? Wow
Weird ass play call with 40 secs..take a shot or take a knee
"kinda feel bad that they got another injury

But i also want revenge for last year so i'm not that mad. Hope he gets better tho"
what kind of fucking play call
Dobbins making friends
Annoying way to end the half
Yeah that arm is broken fuck
everybody mad we ran out the half but this shit ain‚Äôt madden
Seeing that guys elbow turn inside out was almost as bad as watching Boyles knee do the same
"All we had to do was get it to the 50 and tucker can attempt a 68 yard-ish fg. We had nothing to lose, and it‚Äôs not unrealistic that he would make it."
These nfl shop commercials are never not annoying. Every now and then ‚ÄúTHE CHAMP IS HERE‚Äù will pop into my head.
"So today we‚Äôre rooting the Jags, Eagles, Broncos, and Chiefs, right?"
I‚Äôm thinking another turnover and we‚Äôll have this one in the bag
wow nice work judon
Anyone else notice that on the ravens apparel they have RAV B but on the Titans gear it‚Äôs TEN T? I guess they didn‚Äôt want TIT T on theirs
"Every single time Tannehill is touched now, I look for a flag."
"aye we stopped the screen, that‚Äôs fresh"
Stomping on the shield at the beginning of the game was a rookie mistake
"2 good hits on tann, need more"
I love Proches hands wish we would give him a route sometime...
"What flags we gonna get this drive, holding, OPI?"
Cary Williams with dreads is now named Hairy Williams
DEZ
HE EXISTS
DEZ THROWIN STIFF ARMS ALREADY
Damn Dez looks nice in the black uni
Dez Bryant spotted!
A Dez Bryant screen pass is a good indication that they will use him more
There's the fire. Pass it to him again
X
"Tony gets on my nerves. But I also love his knowledge, lol."
When dez gets a td we will lose it
Lamar has carried it 8 tines?  Doesn't even seem that much
‚ùå
ROMO CALLS HIM DOBBY THE HOUSE ELF
god i am just so happy we are finally letting dobbins work
Quit bitching vrabel
Dobby is here to stay
Dobby strong. Dobby fast.
Glad to see Lamar finally throw it away on one of those scrambles instead of running OOB for a loss of 2
Romo has low key dropped 2 r/ravens memes lmaoooo
"Romo isn't lying though, they're sagging off Dez like crazy. Give him a screen"
JACKSON TO ANDREWS!!
Nice fucking throw
I love it. His timing is perfect to Andrews
I would like to see a deep contested pass thrown to Dez by the end of this game.
What a fucking beauty
"really shocked the refs didn't call a flag on us for that play, they hate when we score"
What a throw
LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO!!!!!!
LJ to MA boooooooom
MANdrews
"LAMAR ""ACTION"" JACKSON"
Wow that was a great route combo (Hollywood post outside to take away the corner and safety)
That throw would've been money even if andrews was covered.
#THROW IT ON A DIME
#Yannick is about to E-A-T
Can‚Äôt struggle in the red zone if we through a TD outside it üòà
LOL at Lamar after the touchdown there
Hahahahaha punk‚Äôd his bitch ass
FUCK BUTLER
"Lamar bumpin Butler, bless that man"
Butler got fuckin punked lol
lmaooooo talk that shit Lamar!!!
"Oh Jeez, hope Henry is okay. You never wanna see that"
Seriously someone get this man his fucking Xbox!!!
"Elliot instantaneously becomes my favorite player of all times.

Hope Henry is ok though"
Fuck Butler
hahhahaha Malcom butler is a clown
Henry man I hope you‚Äôre okay but pay back is a bitch.
Henry just learned that that‚Äôs not Earl üòà
Eat a dick Butler.
Elliot doesn‚Äôt want to hear anyone say nobody can tackle Henry ever again
Ever since someone posted the stat on the NFL sub about how close to the middle all of Tucker's kicks are it's all I can see
Elliot is a DOG
This is a satisfying revenge game
Hope Henry is ok but it felt good seeing him get smoked not going to lie
"Oh man, hope Henry is alright."
THE JOKER!
sit down king henry
STOMPED. OUT.
Elliot: Ill fuckn do it again
Come on peters
What kind of tackle was that from Peters?
aaaaand now the secondary is getting soft
we cant defend play action to save our lives
That was an obvious fucking hold holy shit.
Bro don‚Äôt even compare Stanley and Lewan
We all have shitty snappers!
They have their own Skura
Did Greg Roman call that play? üòÇ
"LMAOOOOOO I AM ROLLING

FUCK YOU TENNESSEE"
LOL they really tried that
Deja-vu but for the Titans
The irony of that bad snap looool
I upvote everything in this thread
Bengals are jinxed boys Burrows after having his leg jacked
DEZ
YES LAMAR FEED EVERYONE
Butler is such a bitch lol
Didn't realize we're allowed to tackle the head now?
Lamar... Come on
Simmons is such a bitch
"I like the call, but ugh"
That arm strength though
"That sucked, but I don't have a problem with the thought behind it."
Duvernay need to keep running
Whyd he stop??
Don‚Äôt understand why we aren‚Äôt just pounding the defense with dobbins
Looked like a 5th grader trying to field a fly ball
First down punt hell yeah
Really not even mad at Lamar there. Duvernay looked like he was dancing ballet out there.
Nice punt
"Why are people mad that we are showing some aggressiveness and trying to make big plays? His team 100% lacks those big plays. You‚Äôre got to take a chance sometimes. Not always going to work, but you‚Äôve got to try or you‚Äôll never improve."
I dont understand our deep shots. Our WRs rarely get behind the defense.
Henry running like ingram today.
"That pass was not on Lamar, it was where his receiver should‚Äôve been if he had located the ball on time."
Could just ran the ball and went up 2 scores heading into the fourth. Instead we launch a hailmary. Stupid
Ohh look another int
"Contested catches, I wish"
Not gonna be easy! Cmon we can step em!!!
Defense needs to play strong this last quarter
I know we got a lot of people out on both lines but I gotta feel a bit bad for titans too you hate to see so many injuries with any team
The D is tired
We choke on the most import drives then fuck up on O all the time. Smdh
"This is what I was worried about, Henry excels against worn down defenses"
Momentum be gone
We going to let them back in aren‚Äôt we?
Oh god we are so fucked on the dline
Here we fucking go üôÑ
Stupid decision to even call that play that resulted in the pick. Ridiculous honestly
The fact that we lost to the Tits THIS JANUARY officially makes it the longest year ever
maybe we can throw a stupid ass deep pass on first down WHEN WERE UP AND DRIVING AND LET THE OTHER TEAM BACK INTO THE GAME ON A SILVER GOD DAMN PLATTER
Tannehill just stares down his receivers. Need to get an INT.
"This is what the mistake of taking a shot downfield and losing the ball without any points.  It allows Titans to stick with their power run/PA game which is their strength.  If we make it a two score game in the 4th, they can‚Äôt do that.  There is a time and a place, and that ebb and flow of the game was not it.  Fire Roman."
Good stop. Really needed that
Great job D.  Way to hang in there.
Big stop
A TD probably wins the game
A lot of our sub‚Äôs coaching mentality is to play not to lose instead of playing to win. If we have a deep shot let‚Äôs take it we need to start allowing this offense to take lumps to get Lamar used to launching it more comfortably.
Our QB run plays have been ass this year
SNEADDDD
Keep grinding O
Lamar you beauty
Ayyyy Harbs good shit!
That better be a first
It looks like he had it and it was a bad spot
"After that Marcus Peters INT challenge, Harbs has a bit more leeway with these challenges lol"
His arm is clearly reaching over wtf
FUCK THE REFS
Holy shit the refs are screwing us over here
Refs are paid to fuck the Ravens i swear smh
Come the fuck on.
JFC this is bullshit
Bad throw
seems like every game for the past few weeks the refs have some sort of vendetta against us
Don't give those fuckers anything
"This is the most frustrating team in the NFL, right?  I mean, come on.  If it's not receivers dropping passes, it's Lamar being inaccurate, or it's the offensive line being a total joke and stupid-ass penalties, etc.  It's like at any one time, somebody important is at a high chance of being terrible at the wrong time.  We should better than this."
fuck the eagles
What was queen doing there
Peters playing shitty
We had them at their 10 yard line and it took them like 3 plays to get to our side of the field this team is embarrassing
Why the fuck do guys have all the cushion in the world against our defense?
Infinitely envious of all these contested catches the titans players are making.
Chooooke
I‚Äôm ready for pain
WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT TACKLING
Nice fucking tackling.
Made a 5 yard play into a 25 yard play lmao
Fellas pls my weekend has been shit enough already
The team's a bunch of fucking chokers.
If we fucking lose this...
Embarrassing. My god
WHAAAAAAAAAATTTTTTTTT
Peters is soft as fuck
I love Peters but he‚Äôs been ass this game
Nice one peters
Are you fucking kidding me? Is he covered in fucking crisco or something?
Nice tackling boys
Professional choke artists
What the actual fuck is this tackling
Peters can‚Äôt tackle.... shocker
Gotta miss ray lewis
"Everyone's running miles all week after that garbage

Holy fucking fuck fuck fuck"
"Humphrey missed tackles on both of Brown's plays, that's disappointing"
I can't wait to hear the shit that Harbs will be feeding us after this lol.
I knew we should've taken AJ Brown over Hollywood on draft day and that proved it right there
I wish this season was over.
"Disgusting, doomers you say? Have you been watching? Denial I say to you."
"Chuck Clark is having a horrible game, 2 missed tackles, 4 1st down passes given up"
Goddamn Humphrey you had a chance just pop the motherfucker. Fuck that strip right now
"This team is a fucking joke, can we stop comparing them to Mahomes and Kc last year now, un fucking believable. What awful tackling"
What an embarrassment.
That was just pathetic defense
MVPs come back and win this game.
This game is the difference between us being in a fairly secure wildcard or having to crap ourselves watching Week 17 to get a playoff spot.
Ph my god so close to fumbling the game away
At least there‚Äôs no hurricane this time
"I don‚Äôt want OT, we can‚Äôt stop shit on defense"
Fucking pussies better figure it out
Feed DEZ!! HE WANTS IT
Penalty is pathetic but we‚Äôre in FG range so slow it down and take some shots
That may have been a TD if not for Mekari.
That was a TD fuck
Win this shit
Let's go win a fucjing game fuck
We did not lose that challenge earlier. Fuck that
"Why don‚Äôt you run it, what the fuck, a first down gives us 4 more chances"
Fucking ot
Now we have to rely on the football gods for a coin toss....ravens woke up today and aimed to make sure I don't wake up tomorrow
I hate overtime rules man
#dude landed on the center throw a flag you cowards
"‚ÄúBuT IaM a SoUljaAaH!‚Äù Waaaa. Learn to catch soldier, and maybe get on a a testosterone cycle"
Let's go win the game boys. Big truzz
Huge resume building opportunity for Lamar.
#BELEE
Fucking pathetic. Of course we just shit the bed.
Nice job offense
yep......guess we let them kick a FG for the W.
Well this is concerning.
Whelp defense is trash rn and all they need is a fg
I don‚Äôt understand 2 minutes ago they literally drove down the field. Now they couldn‚Äôt even pick up a first down?
That Brown play is just so lol. Jesus that's rough.
Fire Greg Roman
"That's weird, I thought the run-sack-checkdown-punt offense left with Joe and Marty?"
I‚Äôm mentally resigned to being 6-4 and having the Browns ahead of us in the division.
We have no fucking heart rn.
"That false start messed up the entire flow, we was gonna score smh"
Queen should've had a fucking pick right there
shut the fuck up nantz and tell us who's hurt
I miss 2019
"We are a mediocre team at best. A 2-7 team just beat the Patriots. We couldn't get more than 3 yards in overtime and the Titans are just lazily tossing first downs. We suck when it matters, and look good against garbage teams when the wins don't matter at all."
Humphrey is getting whipped today. By far his worse game this season.
Pretenders this year. Tons of talent but regression and injuries hit hard. Looking forward to next season.
and there you go. Henry is not stoppable.
Fitting end
Every catch is OPEN
We are fucking AWFUL
I actually don't even know what our defense is doing. They are not contesting anything and they aren't tackling. They've given up. I miss Ray Lewis.
Bisciotti needs to step in and can Roman since Harbs is too much of a chickenshit to do it himself.
See y‚Äôall in the post. Fuck man
No identity of mental toughness this year.
"Time to make coaching changes. No bullshit. If we wont, thats the season."
"Now on to Pittsburgh, let‚Äôs lose another one and end this season.

üëèüëèüëè"
our defense was so bad that drive it‚Äôs insane
Perfect frustrating Ravens season for this shit year.
"Tell them to get big, talented receivers, not these midgets that we have. 

Dez was our best receiver today, and that‚Äôs saying something."
Titans walked in here and really disrespected us. We deserved every bit of that too
How come the titans can use playaction to get wide open players without a running qb?
"This team was just three kids stacked in a trench coat, it was all a farce"
This team literally makes me sick.
"I never would've thought we'd be in 3rd place behind the Browns this late in the season. Our offense showed some signs of life, yet was still flat overall. I'm honestly more concerned with a patty-cake-playing defense. Big Ray would be ashamed..."
"Such a two faced team this year. Either we look terrible in the first half of a game and figure it out towards the end, or start out hot and lose momentum. There has been zero consistency from every player and coach on this team. Sometimes Lamar looks great but just as often he‚Äôs making dumb plays. Same goes for everyone on defense and all the coaches making play calls. Except for Justin Tucker, love that guy."
Please just run the ball roman you fucking absolute and total imbecile.
Greg Roman is a fat fat fatty douche cockboy dick fart assssssshole
A fucking fake punt and then a roughing the passer on a 3rd down? Let's just hand them points on a silver platter!
That ball was live and our guys didn‚Äôt go for it sad
damn. hope that ain‚Äôt a season ender :(
"i have a goddamn interview in 15 minutes, can we just get a quick TD so i can feel a LITTLE better"
"We don't need a fucking home run ball right now, fuck"
Duvernay had a really poor read on the ball there. Lamar threw it a little long but Duvernay made a bad adjustment and then didn‚Äôt move.
Tbh our d is looking really good even sans Campbell And Williams.
Alright if we can pull this win out of our ass I‚Äôm hopeful for Thursday
That turnover just depleted all the momentum
That deep throw was actually such a dumb call
Why the fuck do so many fans of this team hate Lamar fuckin Jackson man.  Nearly every other fan base would kill for our guy
"Of Course they kick it, they have 0 respect for our offense."
"Roman is still having some suspect play calls, but the offense is clicking more"
I believe in Lamar. I don't believe in the other 10.
"How does this end?

Hollywood drop?

Roman dumbassery?

Lamar turnover? (Bonus points if the Lamar turnover happens because the line fails him!)"
Harbaugh needs to earn his salary cause this team is sleepwalking into mediocrity.
"I thought lamar played good again, defense just couldn't stop much of anything again"
Ahhh good old tucker only scoring for us type of game. Fuck Roman is garbage and so is Brown.
r/ravens will blame Andrews for that lmao
Lamar's performance this season does not inspire hope in me...
"EVERYONE SPAM ""WIN THE TOSS"""
"Three weeks ago after losing to Pittsburgh I said this was a good, but not great team.  I'm not even sure we are a good team anymore."
Andrews and Lamar need to fight the refs for those penalties.
Outstanding o line play guys üëèüôÑ
Suck a dick Tannehill
SO LONG GAY BOWSER
"#WTF Roman, you just gave up a touchdown.

Can we pls get rid of Roman already, dude sucks"
"Lamars stats do not reflect the eye test, hes been throwing some good balls just a half second off on a couple"
Goddamnit ANOTHER stupid penalty extending a drive
"Tbh the way lamar plays at the end of the half, im ok with running it out"
"I hate Greg Roman so much.

In so sick of these dinosaurs, poach a good College OC PLEASE"
#RAVENS SCORE THE SPORTSBALL!!!!
Uh hit to the head there? He grabbed him by the head
Surprised they didn't go for it. Gotta have a long drive here.
Get ready for the taysom>lamar takes
this team has 0 clutch factor. none. cant close anyone good
Teams aren't scar d of our O.  They rather give the ball up or get three and hope we have a meltdown.  It's embarrassing.
Tannehill just drove down the field with relative ease when he had to do it. Lets see what Lamar does
Thank god it‚Äôs Tony Romo commentating
I want the Titans to send us a picture of their Superbowl Trophy. If not they can shut the fuck up
who‚Äôs ready to over react and jump off a cliff when we inevitably start slow?? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Bro Harbaugh is SUCH A G hahahahaha
"Fuck these guys, lets beat em down. No scrub ass player is gonna yell at harbs like that."
Fuck Tennessee
LETS GO HARBAUGH
Malcolm Butler is a bitch
Dez gon fight somebody today. Bet on it.
"I don‚Äôt remember his name, but especially fuck that one  Titans Player That decided  to slap some M and T Bank Stadium employees on the ass after the game."
Dez üòäüòäüòä
"This ref crew leads the nfl in holding calls, and pi calls

Today‚Äôs gonna be so fun"
That was PI. Humphrey was riding him.
Rush 7 can't get any pressure.
Lmao marlo held the whole way
"3rd and 11, they throw it behind the LOS and get the first üòÇ"
Lol gonna let a screen get us on 3rd and 11? What is this fucking madden shit
Lamar will have to win this game for us
Fire Roman i'm over his shitty offense
"no excuses for this d......fuck injuries, next man up."
So many tight ends
"Welp, that was good play calling looks like.  Unfortunately it was the Titans."
We get fooled on every playaction I swear
How many TDs are we going to give up to that exact play??
Team isn‚Äôt well coached whatsoever. Every tricky play works as executed against us and we have no tricks or misdirection.
We‚Äôre just blitzing and getting no pressure whilst leaving everyone open. This happens in all of our losses. If wink doesn‚Äôt stop blitzing we gonna lose. That‚Äôs the trend in all of our losses: opposing offense lite up the blitz with PA and then we have to play behind
Back to being the underdogs baby üòé
Where‚Äôs the leadership on this team? You lose a very winnable game last week and that‚Äôs the first two drives of the game?
DoNt OvErEaCt GuYs youre right lets be happy our team cant stop ryan tannehil and cant stop anything
We have looked terrible for multiple weeks. It's time to stop pretending.
im not going to read this thread and im not going to pay that much attention today
"We need to figure out how to get pressure without blitzing. KC tore us apart on our blitzes, and Tenn went right to a screen on 3rd and long."
Not an ideal start. Still lots of game. Lets not hit the panic button yet
As they say in soccer this game isnt finishing with 11 men. People will be ejected
Ingram's done.
Get Hollywood off the field.
#SoUlJaS
Ingram stopped at a yard. Sit him.
Hollywood has sucked since that tweet
Soulja my ass. He sucks.
Wow.
SOULJA
Mad frustrating. How you drop that pass Hollywood...
Brown is trash and you can't change my mind
Souljaaaa ü§£
Man.. I do not wanna see Ingram out there anymore
"Extra lineman and can't get one yard? FUCK THIS TEAM. Seriously so sick of shit coordinators for over a decade.

Get some good fucking creative schemes in"
89 is our Soulja
Sorry hollywood but that's bum status shit
"You want to complain about touches? You better catch every damn ball, Hollywood."
"Trade Brown. Cut Ingram. And most importantly, fire Roman"
JK sighting THANK YOU JFC
Thank god we have one NFL quality pass catcher
Reason #27 why Dobbins and Edwards should the starters and not Ingram
Why have souljas that don‚Äôt have guns if you can‚Äôt use them?
Would you look at that dobbins carry but let‚Äôs run ingram
Can we trade Hollywood for terry mclaurin pls
How can the coaching staff not seeing that Ingram is a problem?
Fluker is a fucking bum. Sign some dude off the street. Fluker is garbage.
Let‚Äôs get a turnover here Defense
"Our offence needs to run through Jackson and Dobbins, everybody else is 50/50 at best"
This team doesn't have it. I'm not even putting the blame on one person or thing.
justice *gunner* hill
Can we put Justice Hill on defense
Daaamm Hill. Nice hit.
Brown is so annoying...he is so afraid of being out there on the field that is just sad
I hate henry
Special teams is better than offense and defense. Change my mind.
Harrison is strong
DAYUM
Fuck yes bitch
LETS GO
Queen just blasted Tannehill.
That was all Steve Mcqueen!
"Please do something with this, O"
D LETS FUCKING GO
PUT JUSTICE ON DEFENSE AND BOWSER ON OFFENSE
Bowser making up for the dropped pick in the playoffs last year
BOWSER!
Where's the queen slander now?
Beautiful play. Tannehill gets SMACKED and a pick. LETS GO
Y‚Äôall were complaining about Queen but he just destroyed Tannehill and forced that pick
RESIGN BOWSER
Jake from State Farm is shredded. He‚Äôs got an 8 pack.
Patrick Mcqueen lol
Incoming TD-killing holding call
Can we try Bowser out at WR?
I hope bowser pans out for us
RUN THE BALL HOLY SHIT
# WE NEED 7 HERE
Jk is starting to finally get more snaps maybe the coaching staff got its head outa it‚Äôs ass
Lets go guys gotta respond with a TD here!!
Will Holden is a bad name for an OL lol
Look at Dobbins go!! FEED HIM
"Dobbins is the #1 now. Neeeeeeds to be, and use Gus to pound it in the second half."
"""Holden"" is an extremely unfortunate name for an offensive lineman"
Yeah Dobbins should stay in. WTF is Roman doing taking him out after 2 5+ runs? Jfc
Getting way too cute in the red zone
Let's take Dobbins out after he gets us ANOTHER first. Who needs touchdowns anyway. We can just keep getting FGs and let them win.....
seriously need to keep feeding Dobbins
Offence is pathetic.
Our o line is not good enough to do those fancy plays
Assuming that was a new play from Roman.
I hate our coaches
I hate our OC I hate our OC I hate our OC I hate our OC I hate our OC I hate our OC I hate our OC I hate our OC
"Ravens you dumb sobs, don‚Äôt take out Dobbins. We would of scored"
LMAO GIRE GREG ROMAN WTF
fgs all day
That series was atrocious
Dobbins had every right to be pissed about being pulled wtf was that
Honestly this is the first time in a while where I‚Äôm livid at our opponents
Good fucking footwork Lamar.
Tucker‚Äôs our only hope in this game
Hate how every time Lamar rolls out the receivers are all outside bunched up
Man this offense has completely died out there this season. It feels like a completely different team from last season.
DRAFT LINEMEN
Jim nantz trying to jinx tucker
This offense is so trash
Our offense is so fucking bad sometimes. WAKE UP
Great playcalling! amazing stuff!!!
Could have been a Dez td! We are ASS! Point blank
Jfc Dez would have powered that in.
Fuck. Greg. Roman.
I am getting frustrated that we don't feed Dobbins when he is hot.  Let him open up the field to other plays.  He wants to run it and we pull him.
WHY IS JUSTICE HILL IN THE GAME ON BIG PLAYS
"Also I stg if we don‚Äôt keep giving the ball the Dobbins, he‚Äôs tearing them up"
This might be some of the worst offensive coaching I‚Äôve ever seen. No cap
Dez was open
Fuck this I'm tweeting the ravens right now to fire Greg that's all I can do yall should too
"Between Ingram still getting carries and after being yanked after efficiently moving the chains, Dobbins is about to request a trade lmao"
FUCK GREG ROMAN
i cant wait till we fire this trash ass offensive coordinator.
Fuck Greg Roman megathread.
JK deserves better man
Hill is the new Chris Moore on ST
Hill has been great on ST today
Our kick coverage has been real good so far this game
"Two red zone trips and six points.  We can‚Äôt put winning this game on D, but that‚Äôs where we seem to be going."
Honestly I'm starting to think Roman doesn't wanna give it to JK cuz he's 1 of our only reliably good players
You guys realize 1st and Goal and 0 runs?
"We need to draft our next stud on the interior O-Line, until we shore that up this offense ain‚Äôt doing shit with or w/o Roman"
Hill again making the plays on ST.
Ok Justice Hill is a monster on special teams and we need to keep him
"Henry getting ran down boys.

Wink is on point."
Hill = Chris Moore 2.0
OUr oFFenSe WiLL Form A NeW iDeNtITy
I need to see Malik lay the Hammer on Henry PLEASE
Justice Hill (RB) - DPOY
"Clock was at 0 for literally 2 seconds, how was that not delay of game"
Judon for once peeled off
Nice missed OPI. Love how they call tacky shit on Marlo and then ignore the obvious push off
Good field position.  Need to do something with this.
"Let's go, offense."
"Marlon hasn't been pressing as much this season, and I wish he would. He's a great press DB"
"JK runs like 5 years on his knees lol

Edit. Yards."
Dobbins is so much better than any other RB on this team. It‚Äôs not even funny.
FEED JK
Feed the ball to Dobbins!!
ROMAN YOU BETTER NOT MESS THIS UP
dobins is running so well
Does anyone think Dobbins might be good? Asking for my friend who is an OC
GODDAMN IT YOU GOTTA MAKE THAT PLAY
Lamar was late there. Same throw but earlier is a TD
2 for 9 for Lamar. Jesus Christ.
Dez was wide open there but I‚Äôll take the shot
"Check it down to Dez and let him make a play, the chance that Hollywood makes that catch is so low"
Look I clown on Hollywood more than most but that one was on Lamar
"Just a little late on that throw, but I like the attempt"
Love the deep shots though. Keep throwing them.
Mandrews with the big play
GREAT throw!
Bench brown and run Dez as WR1
KEEP FEEDING DOBBINS!
That‚Äôs my Fullback/DT hybrid!
That's for Ricard's Door Dash!
That one is for all the Lamar deep ball skeptics
BEAUTIFUL THROW LAMAR THATS WHAT WE NEED
"NICE TRUCK, LET'S G!!!!"
Gotta wait 8 minutes for the call now
That's ok tho.  We got a 1st down at the 1.
Let Dobbins get it in
He‚Äôs down
"FUCK 
THE
TITANS"
"NGL Roman called good plays on this drive, but execution was just bad....Hollywood/LJ not in sync, OL being kinda bad as always...."
No fucking flags please
dobbins can make a case for OROTY if roman lets him go off the rest of the season
So much anxiety watching this game üòÇ
Damn I thought it was a first
That should have been a first down
Hes very clearly at the one wtf
That‚Äôs a fucking crazy call
Just milking commercials here
Ffs give us the damn TD
"Regardless if he got in or not, it is a first down. Looks like he broke the plane though"
"Jc, give us the TD ffs."
Are they going to fuck us again?
I‚Äôm not even a Ravens fan but GD Dobbins runs hard.
"Yall thought we would kick a FG 
JK"
Man that's a fucking td
"PROPS TO ROMAN FOR ADJUSTING. Great play calling, but definitely props to the players for the execution. Great drive."
This review better be a payback for that fucked up first down call
Anyone else feels like our newly forged identity is very much our old identity?
Dobbins Edwards and Lamar are the future of the run. Ingrams gas is in empty.
definitely a 1st down if not a touchdown
"I feel like the refs saw the orange ground marker knocked to the side and thought that was the first marker when they called it 3rd and 1...

Also that last play was obviously a TD and they better call it that way."
Can‚Äôt wait for another commercial after this 2 pt conversion
Trying to rob Dob of a TD
Dobbins show
JK coming out party
"&#x200B;

2-Pt Conversion is *GOOD!!*"
Mike Vrable has a punchable face and rubs me the wrong way. Maybe because he‚Äôs an Ex Patriot
Dobbins easy player of the game so far. Dude's killing the game
I hope this drive has moved up JK's playing time
Damn we're actually showing some resilience
Okay that was awesome
Best thing about that drive is that our D is rested
FEED MR DOBBINS GODDAMNIT
Dez is a great hype man
Dobbins taking over this game
JK is balling
"Hawks fan here, fuc the titans! They‚Äôre trashy af. Hope you guys run it up on them."
Jaylon setting the edge like ray charles smdh
Bro our special teams is fucking nasty. If I'm the returner for Tennessee I'm fsir catching fuck those hits lol
How you gonna get juked by Ryan T
Ingram the ultimate teammate out there celebrating
NOOOO QUEEN
Cleat to the nose is no fun.
Queen got cleated in the nose
Ouch. Effort ay there though damnit.
Just a shot to the face he should be fine
Damn 7 tackles in the 1st half?
No more injures man üòî
Anyone else annoyed Tony and Jim are just cracking jokes with our 1st round pick injured on the field?
Oh look... ANOTHER COMMERCIAL. The real America's pastime.
Yannick putting the work
Yannick is having his best game so far.
We using 4 man rush and Ngakoue is getting pressure and our zones are limiting em this is a good no blitzing D
Of course there is a flag lol
Bs ass flag
That‚Äôs soft as fuck
I honestly hate the Titans more than the Steelers. I at least respect Pittsburgh as a franchise
Are you fucking kidding me??
The discipline this year does not exist.
Mcphee and Judon are always good for one dumb roughing the passer penalty
We always get roughing the passer at the worst times
IF Ten scores. Itll be because of flags.
Every fucking week
That's an awful penalty.
Gotta say we been containing Henry decently so far
Bullshit
What the hell are you supposed to do?
I just hate that it's always the same stupid shit. Those penalties happen on the most crucial downs
These mfs got so bailed out this drive.
Every nfl game 1 or 2 calls decide the game man fuck this
We can‚Äôt go into half tied with them getting the ball
Titans gotta know that refs are keeping them in this gane
Romo stfu
Gotta hold em to a FG
"Can we please talk about how Queen and Harrison give absolutely no fucks when it comes to tackling Henry?

Just be clear I mean they‚Äôre playing well against him."
Fuck this was a fumble
Romo go date another blonde bimbo and talk like you did anything in the league but blow Divisional leads.
Why is the clock running ?????
Yannick dominating
Fuck you Nance
Yannick lets go
Finally that horseshit drive that never should've happened comes to a merciful end
Yannick is schooling their LT today
A pass rush with only rushing four? what is this?
Holy shit tannehil is so awful without Henry going insane
Yannick is eating LFG
Yannick is a world beater
"That play call doesn't scream ""we want to try and score before halftime"""
[Me when the Ravens score a TD](https://i.redd.it/8jhbqcblwjj31.png)
Fuck that looked painful
That‚Äôs weak football. 45 seconds and a TO? Not even gonna try to drive down the field?
At the 20 with a middling offense and 1 time out. Yes get the clock chewed and get the half. Run it annnnnnd maybe get a chunk play then shift into gear. I'm glad none of you are calling plays.
Imagine having the best kicker of all time and just taking a knee.
I hope we give the Steelers first loss of the season I‚Äôm getting drunk on Thanksgiving if we do.
Come in defense keep up the good shit and no penalties
Browns offence scored 0 in the first half against the Eagles...
They said Brown would be better this year because he wasn‚Äôt dealing with nagging injuries. They were wrong
Wow whatever glitch we had in the first quarter is completely gone.
I don‚Äôt get the shield stomping thing. Especially before the game.
LET'S GOOOOOO
Welcome back officially
‚ùå
Dez for 5 and a savage stiff arm? Fucking keep him in and feed him!
"Dez is back baby

Game over NFL"
Romo makes a good point. Dez has sooo much space. Get that ball out quick.
yesss feed JK
"Wait, we haven't stopped using Dobbins because he was doing good? Do I even know this offense?"
Shut the fuck up Vrabel
"Just joining the chat now

Tannehill is fucking rattled homies and Dobby is going NUTS"
What are you arguing you fucking barbarian.
Screw u Romo we called him Dobby first!
Look at what they did to our boy! Andrews didn‚Äôt deserve it lol
Jesus at some point buy Andrews dinner if you're going to be on him that long.
It feels so good to have all of the penalties be on the other team for once
"Vebrel loosing control of his team.

They were undisciplined as fuck before the game even started."
"Dobbins is over sitting on the sidelines this season, I'm starting to see the excitement from the Ohio fans"
A DEEP THROW??
LAMAR DID A THING
WOW that was a GREAT play call.
#ANDREWSSSS FUCK YEA
YES FUCKING LETS GO
LAMAR WITH A DIME!!!!
"I TOLD YALL

BEHIND THE BAR IS THE TICKET 

I GUESS I LIVE HERE NOW"
THATS WHAT WE FUCKING NEED
MANDREWS FUCKING MANDREWS

YES
Lets fucking go llama
Run games opened up that beautiful pass
The Nick Boyle dance! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Suck my fucking dick ESPN
*He‚Äôs baaAaaAaaaaaaAAaaack*
"This is what I'm talking about people who were here in the first quarter.

Like some of y'all call for Lamar's head way too fast just truss."
"Man if we pull this off, and find a way to beat Pittsburgh next week

We're fucking back bitch"
Great TD pass on an amazing route!
5G CONNECTION. TELEPHATIC
Awesome TD! But fuck....Burrow just got hurt real bad
Holden is .....hold-ing up at RT.  I will see myself out lol
Ok LJ showin some emotion
Love Lamar bumping into Butler
DAMN ELLIOT

Henry got fucking sent to the shadow realm!
And that‚Äôs why Elliott> Thomas
that was a nasty hit
Elliott is a BIG BOI NO LIL BOI
BIG HITTAS HERE
32 AINT YOUR LEAD BLOCKER ANYMORE
I know we hate Henry but I really do hope he's ok
BOOM
That TD was to shut the mouths of all the bandwagon Ravens and plastic ass fans on this subreddit. Fuck all y'all soft ass bitches
Aint no Earl Thomas here.
That‚Äôs my QB
"WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO


IN THE MOUTH"
Joker > the King
Hit stick!
TURN THAT MAN INTO A BOY
Elliot laying the wood on Henry and then ripping the ball out while he‚Äôs falling goddamn
Elliot >>>>> Thomas
Hit him again
RIP Joe Burrow 2020-2020
"Greg Roman -  ""I recently found out that establishing the run with Dobbins means we can open up the passing game!""

""We will now forge a new offensive identity"""
Peters got roasted
We are going to need to score at least another td looks lkme
"Who woulda thought we are too physical for the Titans lol, they belong to De‚Äôshon Elliot"
Lmfaooooo I swear to God this defense at times
Whenever the offense starts clicking the defense shits the bed...
Someone outsmarted themselves
This is how the Playoff game should‚Äôve went.
THEY SKURA'D IT
"Eye poke, that shit is unacceptable if on purpose"
KARMA IS A BITCH HAHAHA FUCK YOU TITANS
Karma
I love how physical this game is. Feels like an old Pittsburgh game.
LOL SERVES YOU RIGHT
When did we trade Skura to the Titans?
Sometimes trying to be the smartest dude on the field costs you bigly
Haha fuck you
hahahaha
"About time these things go our way. After the last Henry wildcat burn, things go full circle."
DONT PLAY THOSE GAMES
AHHHH just had vietnam flashbacks
HA!!! FUCKS
REVENGE HAHAHAHA
"nice. we got saved by their C

a nice, long offensive drive would be nice here."
Run. The. Ball.
"Going wildcat on 4th and 1 with a monsoon. Going wildcat with a backup centers first snap of the day. 

What‚Äôs the difference üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
"So Soulja is now what, 0 catches on 3 targets? 4 targets?"
"KAMAR AIKEN!!

Wait..."
People who wear masks below their nose are dumber than bricks
"Fuck you Butler, your soft af. Dez run right through you"
Butler has to be the biggest fucking bitch in the league
RAVENS LEGEND DEZ BRYANT
Dez is doing well
Dez and Proche baby!
That was um what?
Fucking hell
What the fuck was that. Jesus christ.
"Lamar wanted to go to the sideline to not take the hit but Snead got pushed back. 

That's a smart decision even if it was close."
Ravens legend Dez Bryant
That was on Duverney.
MORE DEZ DAMMIT!
Duvernay got lost.
Our WR‚Äôs suck.
Damnnnn why now
Terrible. Duverney you gotta break that up
Honestly I'm ok with that pick. At least he's looking down the field
Duvernay not helping out
Was that on duvernay ?
"What the fucking fuck is that playcall? JK has been ripping them up all game and we have control of the score, WHY WHY"
Blew a good ass drive.
"That's exactely what NOT to do, as a Wide Receiver."
That was on Duvernay
Pulled the old Flacco arm punt
lmao the pass punt. Throwback to the Flacco Days
Defense is gonna have to stop them somewhere. Idk where but we got a lot of space to do it.
Man I wish we could have contained Henry this well back in January
With all the injuries I didn't expect our D line to perform this well.
Can we get one sack please?
As a small business owner I appreciate these visa commercials
We reaaaaally need to hold them. We can't let them get points and then not score next drive. We have to score at least two more FGs or a TD and FG.
"we need a stop, they're getting hot and we can't afford this"
Elliot is gonna put himself in a wheelchair
# NOOOOOOOOO
The linebackers are getting caught up in the middle they need to get wide to their assignments
We better hold them to a FG
Just like the Steelers game that int took all our momentum away. If we lose it‚Äôs on that turnover.
Why can‚Äôt we set the edge
4 down territory methinks.
Good hold Defense
Watch the faaaake
"Gotta go score now, got to."
Now we need a score to keep this lead going and close out the game
need a long time consuming drive right here. gotta get at least a FG
Lol Elliot was wagging his finger to an empty stadium
Dobbins pls
The option is just not working this year.
Another dumb ass play
Lamar use Dobby?
SNEAD WITH THE CLUTCH CATCH
Snead has put in the work
SNEAD #1 RECEIVER
Vintage Jackson
Number one WR Willie Snead
"Nice drive so far, a 3 and out would have been a calamity"
Terrible spot
Harbs has stepped up his challenge game this year for sure
Very smart challenge
Wtf???
should have won that
Fuck these refs
 Lamar fucking missed him wide open.
Refball!
Annd another over throw.
Classic penalties to kill a drive
We‚Äôre determined to let them win this game
Fucking pathetic.
Our offense is so ass
Fucking open man come on
That's definitely not on Roman
Bad throw. FUCK
We seriously are about to fucking throw away this game.
Jesus the Titans have no one left
Queen hello?
What is Peter's doing?
Here we go
get peters off of him
Imagine having defenders who could tackle
Oh so now it's the defense's turn to let us down?
Just give them the touchdown already fuck me
"Woah woah woah, was that a little person?"
Just let him in
Tannehill dribbled it!
why is Chris board even near Aj brown
wow Judon's actually playing well today
üòÇüòÇ lmao embarrassing
That‚Äôs horrific defense.
LOL
That one missed throw to Andrews is going to lose this game
Atrocious tackling
Fucking pathetic. Unreal
Simply embarrassing
Who the fuck just carried him into the endzone
That was one of the worst defensive plays of our season. How the holy shit did he just keep going.
Our tackling is atrocious. AJB is a monster but he should NOT be allowed to tank through like that.
fucking trash ass secondary. wrap up you fucking eggs
how can you blame the offense for this tackling???
Unacceptable.
"Lol, our entire defense can't hold onto anyone to make a tackle.  Another problem we've had all season."
Can we acknowledge this is on players not making plays and leave our coaches alone?
Pathetic
Can‚Äôt wait to miss the playoffs
I'm so fucking done with this defense
Defense just got bullied.
Defense is trash
Bunch of choke artists
Just let him walk right in guys it‚Äôs cool
Titans just embrassed us at home
well here‚Äôs the season
I mean Peters whiffing the tackle makes sense but Jesus wtf is everyone else doing
Fuck this horseshit.
"Well, time for Lamar to throw the ball. *fuck*"
"I know we have issues with offense, but a drive like that really I gotta be pissed at the defense"
I like Chuck but you can't be getting shed by a WR if you're gonna play SS
"I mean if we lose, it sucks but I can get over it. But losing like THIS.....that's totally different"
I have zero confidence in the offense to get past midfield as well
Blame of the game peters
Cant wait to lose off dumb penalties on this last drive
Gonna be yet another close game the ravens lose because of their own incompetence. I keep waiting for it to even out but this team finds a way to fail every week
I have absolutely no confidence in this offense the way they've looked
Terrible tackling
"That was embarrassing,  we need to be able to make stops"
D forgot how to tackle around the ankles
"So we hold the Tits to 24, no excuse"
I'm in Spain without the S
Watching football hurts now
The thing is I know we aren't bad record wise but this team gives me such 2017 feels right now it keeps me up at night.  Wasn't asking for 14-2 again but for the love of Christ can we lose without all the bs?
Work'em Lammie!
Lamar needs to prove himself. No one cares what you did last season at this point.
Peters is pplaying like he's scared of contact
Non believers can STFU fake ass fans.
truss levels building
COME ON GUYS GO GO GO
Dez!
DEZ
Let's play to win not overtime.
THAT WAS A TD
#BELEE
We absolutely do NOT want overtime.
Y‚Äôall got any more of them false starts?
üôÖüèΩüôÖüèΩüôÖüèΩüôÖüèΩüôÖüèΩ
THERE WILL BE NO BLAME OF THE GAME
"They need to address these panalties man, it's killing us"
I really hope we don't fuck this up. I don't like snatching defeat rom the jaws of victory
Good decision by Lamar
no one can get open jfc
Damnit I wanted a TD so we didn‚Äôt have to play OT since we literally play Thursday....
Why not run we had a timeout what is that call there man wtf
so disappointing. They give us the win and we decline it. Fuck this
Thank god for tucker
Awful. Where's Dobbins?
OVERTIME IM HERE FOR IT!!!! BIG BOY FOOTBALL LITTLE BOYS GO HOME
"good drive on O, give us the ball take us home"
All the receivers standing still....
That should have been  a flag
The glory days of having a heart attack every game and letting Tucker carry the team
The Tucker Jersey is on boys
Why do our centers fucking hate us?
Andrews was right in front of the goal line.
Lamar‚Äôs only has only had one OT in his career right?
#RALLY CAPS
Stunt on these hoes
LETS GO LAMAR. BUILD THAT LEGACY BABY
THANK FUCKING GOD
I want to see a fuck tonne of Dobbins here
It's the BELEE quarter boys and girls. Lets get it.
The biggest issue seems to be the red zone offense.  They‚Äôve been there plenty of times in several games and come up with FG. 3 times in this game they couldn‚Äôt get a TD. just one game time is the game.
Dobbins until it stops working please
Pathetic
I swear man the rollercoaster of emotions
Our O-line performances and penalties are costing us the game.
Ah. The ravens.
Greg Roman runs EVERY time on 1st down at least change it up
"Yeah, that's how you lose games. ggs yall"
lol they just need a FG
GG
I guess they were trying to create the Ray Rice play?
o-line getting cooked
"Ballgame.

This loss is worth it if Roman gets fired"
I fucking hate this team
Knew Greg would fuck this up
C A N C E R
what does Lamar's contract look like?
Dumbass play by not throwing that away.
We would need a miracle from this defense.
FIRE GREG FUCKING ROMAN PLEASE
I'm ok with missing the playoffs for better draft pick
wtf was that
Marcus Peter's is trash today.
These tiny little plays. They make bobble catches. Turn losses into net gains.
I‚Äôm fucking pissed
god dammit ANOTHER INJURY????
Fuck 2020
Can we fucking tackle?
The difference between us and the Titans is they have receivers that can get fucking open
"They literally only throw it to David or Brown, how hard is it to cover that"
I can't wait until this team ruins my Thanksgiving as well
Team looking at 4 straight losses with a shit offense.
i went into this week already full-on expecting to be 6-5 come friday and they still manage to let me down
"Steelers, Titans, both games we should've won but didn't. The locker room is slipping away..."
fuck man our D has no life left
Someone better be fucking fired
"Our front office has managed to avoid criticism, but this roster is the problem.   Not very good at lots of spots"
GG boys people need to be fired
"See ya next season, guys"
This team is an embarrassment.
#GOD DAMMIT CAN WE PLEASE TACKLE HENRY???
I really need to stop waiting until after these games to do my homework lol. Win or loss I'm mentally exhausted after
GG. This team fuckin sucks
"Welp, that's the game. Derrick Henry is literally the Terminator. He's a machine that just can't be stopped."
"3rd place in the AFC North, here we come."
We don‚Äôt deserve the playoffs
Our defense is actually bad
We beat ourselves...again!
God I hate the Titans.
Fire the whole coaching staff at this point.
Our secondary is overrated as fuck
We had this game.
Embarrassing way to end the game. We officially suck.
"no D-line, no O-line, no comprehension of coverage to the flats= no winning team."
BIG TRUSS
Time to fire the offensive staff
All this money on the defense & they fold this easily
nice way to defend home field boys
I hate watching this team.
This team is spineless it showed before the game and in key moments
This is exactly how we lost the playoff game. Trading FGs while they score TDs
"Call bullshit clipping just because a guy gets hurt, but no flag for lowering the helmet on the very next play. These refs are as fair and balanced as every major news channel."
This sub is soooo toxic
"I don‚Äôt want to hear anybody complaining anymore about fairweather fans. Those have long gone... the people complaining about this team right now are real fans, and they have a real reason to complain. This team sucks. We have absolutely no business of being in the play offs.

And yes, maybe, the fanbase is more toxic than the horrible horrible Flacco days because we actually expect something from this team... Shouldn‚Äôt have done that"
Idk how people expect us to be the same team with all of the injuries we‚Äôve had
Unfucking real. This should‚Äôve been a 7pt drive
Say what you want about lamar but guys are making mistakes all around the lineup that werent made last season.
Lamar ain‚Äôt having enough time to do anything with these passes
We are not gonna win this game.  Can't execute when we need to against a pretty good Tennessee team.
"pretty impressed at how well we're doing so far, i was expecting to lose by a lot cuz henry is huge"
Peters is kind of a bitch sometimes. Love the guy but also kinda don't like him at times.
They gonna try to hurt lamar this drive. Hand the ball off....
GODDAMNIT LAMAR YOU HAD ALL DAY
"Dude we were marching, why"
Why are we NOT RUNNING IT EVERY PLAY AT THIS POINT
"Bad pass, bad call, and Duv messed up a bit not fighting for it. Could have just been an incompletion."
Thats why Duv isnt allowed to run more than jet sweeps and screens lol
Maybe look at the other angle you dumb fucks
Lamar man that throw was dog shit bro
Doomers out to play
This team fucking sucks we don‚Äôt deserve playoffs
That was a delay of game but whatever
Don't forget JK with that block tho
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD JUST DON'T TURN IT OVER
If they turn it over ima kms
Another drive that just fucking ends pathetically
This is a battle between 2 teams trying their best to lose. Who comes out on top?
Lmao this offense is so fucking pathetic
Truss levels are currently in the negative
Vrabelichick
Fire Greg Roman right now that motherfucker is so retarded
Harrison showing more awareness  than Queen rn
Refs has it out for us guys plain and simple we gotta overcome it.
"Offense costing us big rn, Lamar missed 3-4 throws that could have been big, and of course dumb penalties"
Steelers gonna push this teams shit in next week. Anyone talking bout truss is a fucking idiot at this point.
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you have to at least look at the ball before making contact as a defender?"
romo hates the ravens
Hey guys just a heads up. There have only been two drives so far.
He doesn't even deserve the Hollywood nickname. Call him dumpster brown cuz he's TRASH
Wasn‚Äôt too bad but I thought there was a PI based on not playing the ball?
Field goal ain‚Äôt getting it down with our D.
Lamar was on the move that‚Äôs not some cake walk throw to make it was just good coverage tf y‚Äôall on üòÇ
You really can't blame Roman when someone is schemed open and Lamar doesn't make the throw.
Offense is garbage.
Commentators need to stop trying to jinx Tucker
[deleted]
"Dude wtf is the reffing this year? That was clearly a 1st, and clearly a td"
If Mahomes got the ball back with 50 seconds they would try to score that‚Äôs all Ima say.
"I love the complaints about running out the clock. It was 1st and 20, and this is not Madden."
LETS FUCKING GOOOOO
"That wasn't even such a bad snap, Henry just failed there"
And that's why Duvernay doesn't see much use downfield.
"that‚Äôs both on Lamar and Duvernay, a bad route and a bad decision"
And y'all still blame the receiver right there. I don't get it
we let tannehill run for 13? cmon
This game feel really familiar to anyone else?
they're gonna go up 23-21 and we'll lose because of Lamar and Roman
"Receivers open on every single play, pressure not getting anywhere. They gonna march easily"
Honestly we should just let them score the TD
"Call me a fake fan or whatever, but I have zero confidence in this offense getting down the field for even a field goal in a pressure situation."
"Lamar has a chance to prove he can come from behind and win a game late, this is a very good opportunity to do it."
"man.... i know we're all about ""big truss"" but i have no truss in our offense coming up big here."
This may hurt worse than the divisional game..I thought that was an aberration. But it was just the beginning
This secondary couldn't eat shit out the shoes of Lewis/Suggs/Reed
Snead is the fucking man. Only bright spot on this team lately. What a fucking boss.
24 points to a playoff team when were down 2 key defenders isnt bad.
"Pathetic, we just needed a first down and none of the WRs or TEs even bothered to come back. No game awareness"
I hate this team so much this year. Since 2014 we've imploded culturally.
someone needs to be fired - this team is sorry
Absolutely fucking pathetic. See you next year guys
Fuck this team
"Honestly, from top to bottom. The 2020 ravens might be the most overrated I have seen."
This offense simply isn't very good anymore
Colbert is so unfunny
WHY cant we give Dez some big passes fuck man I really hate this offense. Very incompetent coaches.
It looks like Roman missed another throw.
Reminder the titans are 1-3 the past month and are shredded with injuries on defense.
"Hopefully the ""everything is fine, people who complain are bandwagoners"" people go away after this."
Ravens just cant beat the good teams.
This sub is so toxic
This week was the first time Lamar and Hollywood didn‚Äôt walk in together. That seems troubling üíî
"Alright, Jim Rome. I'm pretty sure no one was even thinking about comparing this year's Seattle defense to those *Legion of Boom*^TM squads; but it's okay, you be you."
"Two Ravens games this week my dudes

Let‚Äôs feast"
"Nantz/Romo twice in three weeks, we're big time now"
"No matter what our guys say, they know this is a revenge game"
All of you guys are annoying me. Have some faith. We've been in worse positions against worst ropes against worse odds and somehow Harba makes the team play well. Chill out I'm seeing negative posts after negative post and we haven't even kicked off. Last I checked we haven't been the browns since 1996.
Harbs ready to square up lmfaooo
Malcolm butler is one to talk
"Ok, fuck this team into oblivion please."
FUCK THOSE SCUMBAGS
"Fuck the titans for trying to disrespect our team, good for Harbaugh not taking it"
Fuck the Titans
Why does 3rd down always come so God damn fast.
DEZ IS IN!
Super close!!! Love that we have Dez to go for that
Can they show a replay why that was incomplete?
Dez XXX
Dez caught it
Why do we always hold? It‚Äôs unbelievable
Offense is a tragedy to watch.
Apparently we are the only team that holds and commits DPI.
Learn the names. Humphries üòí
Another day full of penalties
Holy shit I just realized this is Romos first game commenting on his former best receiver (or at least in a while)
I wanna know how many 3 and outs we‚Äôve had this year
Shit play by Marlon
We about to have 18 penalties and the Titans will have 1 false start and that'll be how this game goes.
Ohhhh yes bby gimme one more penalty i‚Äôm almost there
This O-line already falling apart \*sigh\*
I swear throwing a fucking deep ball in this league ends up being a PI 90% of the time.. fucking stupid.
Does this team even do anything in practice? We already have two fucking penalties?
His name is Humphrey not Humphries
Fucking blitz
"""Humphries"" 

lots of effort there"
Come on d
Humphrey showing Earl how to tackle Henry
"Does our O-line practice for like 5 mins and go home, why are we so undisciplined"
This new identity has looked great. 3 and out
"Go 3-out. Defense letting them drive on their first possession. 

Going to be a long day"
"I hate this fake crowd noise, it‚Äôs really distracting"
I want this team to go OL and DL heavy and trade future picks for a WR.
Deciding if I really wanna do this to myself today. Might be time to watch red zone instead
We have zero defensive line basically. This game is pretty much where the offense MUST put up or shut up.
Ah yes the most tight ends by tight ends
Wow I did not realize our red zone D was that bad. That's what no 4 man rush will get you.
dickless cowards
This is going to be discouraging
We‚Äôre so scared of Henry that it opens up their passing game
What is defense?
Pathetic display of Ravens D. Our new logo should just be a block of Swiss cheese.
If this is the team - we‚Äôre headed to 8-8 with wins over Bengals and Jags
( Õ°‡≤†  ñÃØ Õ°‡≤†)
What the actual fuck was that
I literally hold my breath every time this offense takes the field........
why do we blitz on 3rd and long?
Like you almost fight a team before the game even starts and that‚Äôs how we come out looking? Lol
Please lord give me strength
"Who's ready for run, Incomplete pass x2 lol"
"Wink blitzes on 3rd and long against a battered OL guess who gets the first down? the check down.

We come out running on 1st down on offense for a limited gain, leaving lamar in 2nd & long to caretake. 

w/e, man."
"We need our playmakers on defense to play insane today. Humphrey, Peters and queen get yo fumble game on"
the 3rd and 11 conversion was the killer. unacceptable can‚Äôt happen. clean it up and move on. 53 and 1/2 minutes left
Brandon Williams and Calais Campbell are pretty damn important to this team. Hopefully the offense can get it together.
"Time to disprove the lazy ""can't play from behind"" meme once again."
Do we have a playbook at all? Looks like no one knows what to do...
Its sad how obvious it is that nobody fears Lamar like they did last season.
No dobbins yet tf going on??
Get Ingram out wtf
"Im telling y‚Äôall our blitzing tendencies are gonna get us killed if we keep it up, teams are coming better and better prepared for it and it‚Äôs annoying see all the open zones"
Why the fuck is Ingram still RB1??
Wow Soulja WOW
Nice hands soulja
Hollywood garbage
lmao thats my soulja
I don't wanna hear a fucking word from Marquise Brown ever again
I so badly wish we had the Chiefs' playbook
Hollywood has been terrible every since he made those remarks
Soulja dropping balls
Butterfingers Brown better not say a fucking word after this game if we lose
Ingram couldn‚Äôt get 1 yard with 7 offensive linemen crashing the right.... why is he getting any work over gus and dobbins?
SOULJA
Soulja!
Sit Ingram down please
Lamar deserves a better team than this
SOULJA!!!
Fuck I'm behind I'm about to watch what brown did lol
Catch the ball Hollywood.  He's too scared of being hit.
Lamar and Andrews are literally our only offense
Cause hes afraid of getting hit.
"Damn, that drop by Brown.  This team has been plagued with dropped passes, bad snaps, OL penalties (and just all-around poor performance), it's been a brutal stretch of ineptitude lately hasn't it?"
You gotta use your soldiers
Ingram can not get shit.
Soulja sighting
Hollywood Bust
Hollywon't
More Duvernay/Proche/Dez.....less hollywood
Lmao fucking hollywood
LET DOBBINS AND DUVERNAY EAT GOD DAMNIT
"Take notes on that catch, Soulja"
How are any of you blaming Ingram when they get to the line immediately
Mark andrews might be our most reliable player lmao
Soulja can't catch
Feed Dobby
In one play Dez has done more than Boykin has in weeks and he even dropped it.
I‚Äôm sorry but we need dobbins and Gus this game
Stop running Ingram :( I love the guy but he ain't it
What‚Äôs the point of having Souljas if they can‚Äôt catch the ball?
See what happens when we give it to jk
"Get ingram out man, 3 snaps and 2 yards to show for it."
FCKING BENCH INGRAM
Wow the other team got a penalty!!
Hey ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù how about you catch the fucking ball
A penalty against the other team?  Are we in alternate universe now?
Godbins
Shocked that penalty wasn't against us lol
Finally a penalty not against the Ravens
"Mark Andrews simply goes in motion out of the backfield to lineup just off the line. 

""They're really asking Andrews to do so much more now."""
All I heard was a money hooker
I get people are being critical of Lamar but his O-line gives him little to no time
Dobbins gets a run = first down. Ravens: Okay buddy now go sit on the sideline
Hey guys! Pick up your spirit! Game isn‚Äôt over!!
"Idk about his fitness level, but Dez should  in every play. Brown is basically invisible."
Damn what a hit
Fuck I missed the hit
no one can get hot the way we switch in and out rb's
Let‚Äôs get a turnover pls
Good shit Justice.
Queen is in for a long day... dudes playing on his heels already
Haha queen and not being gap disciplined. Name a better duo
Wow we stopped a screen!
D Line is Swiss cheese
Feels like our best chance this game is going to be the Titans getting too cute and wasting downs like that.
Fuck injuries
"I think we‚Äôve held Henry for about 22 yards so far do that 3 more times and he won‚Äôt even go for 100, although it doesn‚Äôt really feel like we are stopping him atm"
Harrison is a real one...guys gotta step up and make plays
Them Ohio State boys üí™üí™üí™
YOOOOOO
LETS GOOO
LETS GOOOO
FUCK YEAA
We need those
We need to resign bowser ASAP
LETS FUCKING GOOOO
Damn Hump thought he had a pick
One of yall said queen is a bust here gtfo
That's that shit I do like.
That was beautifully read.
GOOD SHIT BOYS
see that right there is why we can‚Äôt give up on queen just yet... I‚Äôm at fault too
Oh boy what a pick
BROOOOO!!! QUEEEN!!!!!
Dont hate on King Queen üëë
LETS FUCKING GO
I love defense
Oooh yeah!
Huge
THERE WE GO D! LIGHT THAT FIRE!!
Lets go get a touchdown boys!!!
Get in there
"Sorry guys my bad, I didn‚Äôt have my Lamar jersey on. I put it on and we got the pick"
when did jake from state farm get fuckin yoked
I took all next week off.  FUCK YEA!!!
Wink still working the D with holes in it but Roman cant get a TD to save his job. Smh
God save the Queen
"Finish, O"
Another drop.
The offense is so painful to watch week in and week out
Isn't Dez Bryant active today
Good Fluker benched finally
His name JK but he ain‚Äôt kidding
I said it before and I‚Äôll keep saying it: I really love Dobbins.
This nigga Dobbins is different
"I love Ingram but it‚Äôs clear last years heavy workload had its toll 

Dobbins is much more productive"
Dobbins been a beast anytime he's on the field
Don‚Äôt take dobbins out!!
START DOBBINS . I am no longer asking
Why tf does Dobbins come off the field
I would not mind seeing Dobbins get 12-15 carries today at min
Dobbins will become a great for us.
What the fuck was that bruh
First down? Fuck it let‚Äôs run this stupid ass play
That was one of the ugliest plays I‚Äôve ever seen
Wtf kinda shit was that
Jaguars with a shutout üëÄ
Dobbins is so fuckin good please make him the #1 back
"Ok, Greg, new game plan. Hand the ball to Dobbins, throw the ball to Duvernay. Win games."
Dobbins needs 20 carries a game. He is a difference maker
Even the announcers are question why Dobbins came out of the game lmao
First play inside the 10 and you pull that bullshit ass play out of your hat?
Let JK cook üò§
Red zone offense is pure trash
Bruh please play jk
Smh Dobbins needs to get the load of touches
Every run play has been positive yards.   So let's pass it
"Roman, having Hollywood run to a spot and not keep moving around is not a red zone play
 Please stop"
This offense is an absolute fucking joke
Can we get a TD pass please
Fucking three and out
Seems like a slant or 2 would help things
Only getting a FG is embarrassing
dumb fucking calls jesus fuck
We have to give that to Dez!!!!!! Hes a grown man he coulda plowed that in easy.
This feels like a Tucker game tbh
"You really need 7 there, need another big play for the D here"
Run the fucking ball
Nantz is such a dick
Those plays are embarrassing..throw the ball already
"Our offensive line will be why we lose. Lamar has 0 time, couldn‚Äôt even throw that quick slant because of how quickly Lamar got pushed back"
"I don‚Äôt get the reads, he is always looking for Andrews first who is taken away like in the Pats game. Oh well keep fighting!"
what a fucking joke
This Offense is just impossible to watch.
Our OL has to be the worst in the league
Let's abandon the run at goal line
Is it possible to win this game with FGs only?
"Roman needs percentages to call the plays for him. His ""whims"" are so off. Dude needs to work off of data. I think his schemes are decent but his calls are wrong so often. Just not a good gametime guy."
Not getting TDS here is going to come back and bite us
We can‚Äôt be the only ones with enough brain cells to know you stay with the guy playing on fire. Harbs needs to tell Roman to stop being cute and do what he was hired to do
JKs reaction to coming off is all of us rn
"Lamar has -1 targets to throw to every play, has a second before he's destroyed, and GRoman fucks up calling plays. And we somehow have a 6 in the win column."
Why did they bench Dobbins for rest of that series. I am so confused.
Why are we putting justice hill in the redzone lately?
Why wouldn‚Äôt you throw it to Dez if they‚Äôre gonna give that much separation? Bad start for the offense all around other than Dobbins
"Greg Roman gets super angry when our running backs don‚Äôt just get stuffed at the line.


(This is the only logical conclusion to why you wouldn‚Äôt keep using the only running back not shitting the bed.)"
God damn Roman is actual shit
"Fucking pathetic. Garbage play calling, garbage execution. Yo let's send out Ingram for 1 or 0 yards, or call that Gus Sweep for -2 yards. Or a scramble for 1 yard. Like seriously save time and kick the FG, garbage offense/scheme. Imagine not running 3 times w/ Dobbins there."
"Damn, Fluker already got benched... Dude is speed running uselessness on the line at this point"
That first play wasn‚Äôt a pass. They just botched the run so badly it looked like a pass
Hill is a stud on special teams this week and last
Justice Hill has shown up on ST holy cow
Our kick coverage is killing it at least
Justice Hill special teams tearin it up!
Justice hill LFG üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hill is a BEAST on special teams
We really need to give Dobbins more carries. I don‚Äôt understand it. Just gashed their defense on two straight carries and then you pull him.
Well the special teams is doing well
Stream is hella behind today
Defense is in shambles and still doing their job. Lamar needs to come out and make these throws.
Yannick was in on that pressure!
Clearly an offensive pass interference
That‚Äôs how our defense works. Force 3rd and long. Entire premise of wink‚Äôs scheme.
Way to flip the field with solid defence. Love the grit they‚Äôre showing now. Need our offence to help them out now
we got a stop but will we do something with it
Edge LB‚Äôs did a nice job containing there
"If the offense can get goin we can start turning the tides here.


Defense looks like it‚Äôs gettin it together."
"Amazon has enough money to get any NFL player for their commercials, so why do they go with Deshaun Watson? üòÇüòÇ"
"Man Titans are playing fucking dirty this game. 

Punches earlier, then pushing McPhee into Tannehill to draw a flag, then this shit after the fair catch...."
Hi remember the last time we fired our OC in the middle of the season and won the Super Bowl?
"Lamar needs some fucking hatred in his life bro. Dude out here with the least ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù swagger I‚Äôve ever seen and while it‚Äôs probably good in some situations, sometimes you need to be able to tap into some aggro"
FEED DOBBINS LOOK AT HIM GO
JK DOBBINS EVERY DOWN!
"Dobbins 11 yard rip, bench him pls."
Dobbins is electric. Coaching is abhorrent to take him out the game so often
Keep my nigga Dobbins IN. He literally eatsüòÇ
Dobbins with another first. And oh yeah. Take him out agai . Fucking shit
Dob is the starter and that's that
Wowwwwww. Dobbins can run? Lets take him out now.
Dobbins is such a beast
MAKE DOBBINS RB1
Dobbins looking sharp and fresh when many rookies traditionally run out of gas.
Dobbins is tearing this defense up!!
"Wow Romo said something positive about us, we did have the Steelers beat"
Dobby is a good elf
These next 2 weeks might be the most import stretch of the season. Playing the Titans and Steelers back to back is huge
GAME MVP - JK Dobbins
"yes keep feeding Dobbins, how dumb can we be if we keep giving carries to Ingram"
Fuck Henry. We‚Äôve got Dobbins!
"Dobbins is really good.  Reminds me a lot of Ray Rice with how low he gets running, and his change of direction."
Keep giving it to jk til they stop it.  This ain‚Äôt rocket science
DOBBINS IS OUR DALVIN COOK
DOBBINS THE REAL DEAL YALL
LETS GOOOOOOOOO
Look at that. We keep dobbins in and we get 2 first downs on 3 plays. What are the odds
Roman is so incompetent Feed Dobbins man
"We get way too cute when we get into the RZ. Dobbins was running really well and then we switched to 3 other packages for 2 blown plays across 3 different backs and a field goal.

FEED THE HOT HAND UNTIL HE TAPS OUT"
Dobbins will get us to the redzone and we will take him out again
If our offence was in any way competent we‚Äôd have this game sewn up. Same as the Steelers game fucking killing me
Bryant open for another easy first down lol
Lamar needs to get that out fucking quicker man. Jesus Christ.
Ah damn great throw by Lamar just a little late
"Hollywood won that route, the ball took too long"
Soulja
Dez was wide open at the marker
He was open late throw
Boy How many more excuses can we make for Jackson.
Nice so we don't plan on scoring touchdowns today
Dez was wide open at the First down
Dobbins is a dog has been all year it‚Äôs a blast watching him run imagine him with us last year üò©
Just a tad bit late
"That's on Lamar, bad timing"
Great name for an OL Holden
BRUH WE NEED A TRUE NUMBER 1 RECIVER
The duality of Lamar
Thought that was INT lowkey lol
"Nice throw, great catch Andrews!  Hell yeah!"
Please give Dez a chance in the end zone.
DEZ WAS. WIDEEEE OPEN. BUT LAMAR LOVES TARGETING HOLLYWOOD
#GIVE DOBBINS THE BALL NOW!!!!
Andrews. Water receiver than Hollywood.
What a perfect throw!
Roman running 4 verts like a madden game
"Great throw and catch, but why are two other receivers within three yards of Andrew‚Äôs?"
Just give it to dobbins 3 times
"If we had a boldin, deandre hopkins style receiver we'd be golden"
There we go üò§
#PROJECT PAT
Great shit by G-ro starting Dobbins the whole drive
Damn he‚Äôs down
Give it to Dobbins 3 times
Oof that‚Äôs not a score
Damn his knee was down early
Might be at the 1
Missed a facemask
We playing confident now baby let‚Äôs get it
Dobbins is a GOD
"not a TD but lets hand it off to ricard, let him finish it"
Hes down short. But just run the ball in and score
Now that‚Äôs the Ravens we know and love!!!!
Even though it was short. Let's get hyped!
WHAT'S UP PAT!!!
"Lol PRic you're 300 pounds, run that mf over!!!"
Now put Dobbins in and run it in from the 1
"I really want them to pass to Dez, get this guy going. He's running sharp routes, get him involved. Let's see that fire"
The Dez connection will come in due time. Let Dobbins eat.
If we can pull out this win and get either B-Will and/or Campbell back for thanksgiving we‚Äôd be a good shape
"Still should be a 1st down. Good shit, Pat"
Give Dez a td
I think Lamar isn‚Äôt used to a physical receiver and that‚Äôs why he doesn‚Äôt look to dez a lot.
We FUCKING HUNGRY!!!
I ain‚Äôt gonna complain about how we get points but I‚Äôd love to see a Dez TD here
Harbs talking shit back to players will always be funny
Feed the S L I P P E R Y B O I
"Damn, thought he had the first down at least"
DOBBINSSSSS
The ball was past the sticks?
Keep feeding Dobbins!!
Dobbins is HUNGRY!!! Keep feeding the man!
Give Dobby the ball
Bruh JK is tough as hell.  Look at him fight for those extra few inches after being stopped.
"No way you can overturn that, can't see his knee clearly and where the ball is."
It's weird seeing a big long haired white metalhead looking dude wearing number 82.
# FREE DOBBY
J K ALL DAY
Get ready for 4th and inches
"If it's 1st down.




We'll just fucking do it again."
"Thank you, Wilson. We finally have a replacement for Hayden's hair"
Inconclusive
How is that not a flag for ten49?
New blood new Truzz
All of my Woadies and coyotes coming together like SHOTTASüòàüî•üòà
Feed the elf!! He is a beast!
Bruh Dobbins is a fucking MONSTER.
Is Dobbins szn üòàüòàüî•üî•
Dude is taking the job by the horns
Hell yeah!!!
Everyone hop on Dobbins back straight to the super bowl
Feed dobbins
Fucking Nice play
Best decision EDC made!
Dobbins is doing work today. Keep feeding him
Love seeing how hype dez is about everything
DOBBINS MUST BE FED
[deleted]
Damn we beating that returner up poor guy
SPECIAL TEAMS POPPIN OFF TOO
Roman was checking the game thread during the game and realized how good Dobbins is
FEED JK
I think Ingram‚Äôs gone after this year but MAN I love having him on our team
You‚Äôre going to get juked by fucking Ryan Tannehill? My god
How do you get juked by him lmao
I want another pick
Blowing them up on every kick return. They're going to need to start calling fair catches.
Nose got fucked
Damn took a cleat to the face
Damn that was an ugly looking cleat across the face
"Having not watched Dobbins all season I‚Äôd say this was a career game, but honestly he‚Äôs just getting the snaps he always deserved"
He‚Äôll be fine.
"That's gonna be a broken nose, yikes"
Wtf was Ferguson doing on that play
damn his nose is def broke
We just got sooo lucky
Wicked shot. That‚Äôs a tough kid though
So hard he's trying to break Henry's foot with his face
That hurt my face looking at that
We doing the game plan we should have executed in the playoffs. Force Tannehill to beat us.
Damn Yannick deserved that sack
Yannick caused that incompletion.
Omg did yall see how fast yannick got there?
Defense is doing a damn good job at getting pressure without Campbell or Big Brandon.
Another statless play by Yannick.
Pass rush has been crazy today
Yannick with the pressure. Nice
Lmao i literally called that fake punt
Great pressure by Ngakoue
Is there a team less able to handle unexpected shit?
I hate how Tennesee makes terrible decisions yet doesn‚Äôt get punished for it
That was just a great fucking throw wtf
Fuck the titans man
Yannick is half a second slow to making a big play
Oh come on now
OMG here we go
Fuck the Titans
2 free conversions
Soft call
Ngakoue seems to bring the real pressure
Of fucking course of fucking course
Thats a dumb rule
thats a weak ass call
I almost forgot I was watching a Ravens game
"Okay, the fix is fucking in"
Every week
Henry looks worked.
Penalties are killing us again
Let's get another hundo penalty yards
Defense gotta hold them to a FG since they‚Äôve gotten sloppy
Might as wrap QBs in bubble wrap and put them in enclosed cases the way they ref.
We need a stop here.
Can someone actually cover a TE
Did anybody see Henry's head snap back just now?
Football gods owe us a turnover here
Yannick!
Ngakoue!
They get 5 yards on that?
Can't give this up man
"loving this pressure on tannehill, titans line looking weaker than expected"
Huge drop though! Got the TO
Thanks for the free timeout Tits
Yannick is going off
Ngakoue bringing it today
"pretty impressed with our D so far, esp given all the injuries"
Why not call our third timeout at 3rd down? Waste of 40 seconds. They throw incomplete on this down and we'd have had the ball with 1:30 on the clock
After the way we started I‚Äôll take 14-10 at half... pts here would be big
"The little jump Yannick does is so beautiful to watch, he's so smooth."
"At this point, Tannehill can smell Yannick on every play. Expecting Vrabel and Smith adjust and put a TE there more often in the second half."
istg if they call another penalty on us...
Poor dude
That looked nasty as hell
Maculate conception? :O
Did his arm bend backwards????
Since when is that an illegal block..? I thought it‚Äôs only a penalty to go low when they‚Äôre engaged up high.
Going for another touchdown to end the half. Opposing good player gets hurt. Let‚Äôs just take a knee boys.
I always hear ‚Äú100% have sex with the mandalorian‚Äù am I the only one?
Dobbins needs to be on the field all the time
We got this bb
They should swap out the bengals and put the titans in the AFC north just so we can say fuck the titans twice a year
"Henry only at 37 yds so far, well done ravens D lets keep it up"
Blatant hold on Yannick there
"POW 

free shots are the best shots"
"Can Romo try not to be so bored at the ""old-school"" football?"
TIME FOR OFFENSE TO MATCH THE DEFENSES ENERGY LFG LFG LFG
Defense has made some solid adjustments since that first drive
DEZ
DEZZZZZZ
DEZ CAUGHT IT
DEZ BRYANT OUR DOG ON THE OFFENSE!!!!
DEZ BRYANT
"turned no gain into a few, not bad"
If we're gonna call weak ass RTP then that's clear helmet to helmet
JK is raw dogging these defenders
Dobbins making something out of nothing...love him.
#DOBBY
Offense is allowed to open palm facemask. How does no commentator seem to know this
"Tony Romo ""I'm going to call him Dobby"""
Dobby
ROMO READING THE GAME THREAD YALL
Keep crying Vrabel
Penalties on them?!?
Can ‚Äúyo wtf‚Äù be an official penalty? Cause that was it
LETS GO DOBBY
Titans are playing so dirty right now and acting surprised they're getting called for 10% of it. Go fuck yourselves.
#MANDREWS
Beautiful
MANDREWS
"Underrated play: The throwaway shows the growth, albeit small, in IQ from Jackson."
Hoo boy
LETS FUCKING GO
Nice throw
UHHHHHH FUCK DEM TITANS AMIRITE?
That fucking throw lol
"""Regressed as a passer"""
Great play call and great execution.
Butler thought it was going to Hollywood LMAO
Fucking finally. There‚Äôs the Ravens!
It‚Äôs amazing what happens when you scheme plays for your playmakers
YALL NEED TO TRUZZ THIS MAN
MANDREEEEWWWWSSSS!!!!!!!
LJ DIMES
Does anyone else say money when tucker kicks or am i alone
why is butler going to double cover brown instead of staying in his zone? not complaining just weird
Now let‚Äôs route their ass
That overhead shot was beautiful to see Lamar sky it and Mark break it off to the end zone
Hollywood drew a double team thats why Andrews is wide open
Brinks truck about to pull up to Mark's house
lmao the titans r so ass. i know a lot of us had low expectations about this game but me personally I did not. The titans went from being 5-0 to now 6-3. That should tell u guys something.
That was a fucking dot. I hope we Open up the vertical passing game more especially during our easy stretch of game to prepare for playoffs
"When Brown said he Souljas comment, he wasn't just talking about himself. Y'all loved Snead getting targets last week, y'all love when Duvernay gets more targets, y'all love when Dobbins gets all these carries but y'all still think he was ""talking shit"". Like this is exactly what he was talking about FEED THE PLAYERS THAT MAKE PLAYS."
Lamar lol
LAMAR üíúüíúüíú
Lamar lol
I'm buying a Jackson jersey now
"I shouted out of excitement, then automatically looked at the bottom waiting for the flag marker. It seems like every big play or momentum play we had this year is called back. The relief when I saw the kicking unit out man. Geez."
Deshon crushed him!!!!
Hahaha I love that no-look bodycheck
Our boys becoming a man love to see it LJ
Henry got walloped
POP
It's amazing what spreading out the receiving routes will do for this offense.
THATS PHYSICAL RAVENS FOOTBALL BABY GET FUCKED TITANS
I love Lamar for bumping Butler like that
"Atta boy Elliot, get rocked"
"Damn LJ, I love that"
Atta boy LJ
"You think Lamar did that on purpose? Idk, personally."
That looked rough.
THATS ELLIOT PUSSY
HENRY SOFT
LlamaJax: you don‚Äôt talk to my coach like that
THAT'S A RAVENS HIT.
Damn that 3rd down was big. Really could have started to stamp down on this game
Doing almost everything i wish we did in the playoffs against these pricks
Henry got lit up üÉèüÉèüÉè
Peters owned
Deshon Elliot is one hell of an athlete man
Eddie George vs Ray Lewis memories there.
What the fuck was that from Peters? Terrible coverage and then doesn't even try to tackle him with any force.
These throws are KILLING US
WHY THE HELL WAS HE SO OPEN??!!
Just burned him
Field goal
cmon peters
"BIG hold on Ellis, they gotta call that"
Lol skura‚Äôd
"Lol, get cute and get fucked"
How is Henry even back out there? No way he  wasn't concussed.
Wow that looks like fucking matt skura üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fuck The Titans!
That's on Henry
skura flashback intensifies
Lmao
well that is going to take them out of red zone I guess
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sick play dude
WHAT HAPPENED I WASNT WATCHING
Not this time bitches. Get fucked
Romo with the Freudian slip and changes it up to Skurra'd
Go down and get another TD and twist the knife.
Time to get it O! FEED DOBBINS!
What happened I wasn‚Äôt watching
I think this game goes to show just how main coin flips went in Titans favour last year and when it evens out or leans Ravens how big of a difference it makes.
Run it down their fucking throats!! JK send the killlllll
"I really hope we win, for obvious reasons but also because that shit they pulled before the game will make the look so stupid"
Has Brown caught anything today?
"Jesus, our only receiver today is basically Mark Andrews."
Brown sucks
Proche out there
PROCHE SIGHTING
Bench Hollywood please
Romo was about to run downstairs and tell Roman to throw the ball to Dez.
Imagine your defense struggling so much you want Dean Pees back
PROCHE IS HERE. MASON 2.0
"Guys I‚Äôm not gonna lie, I find it so cringe when people say ‚Äúfoot on the throat‚Äù or ‚Äútwist the knife‚Äù"
Goddamit
Butler mad as hell lmao
Wtf why did we call that?!??
What in the hell was that
Little too much sauce on that one
Wtf was that wobbler?
what the actual fuck.
98 tryna act tough lol okay
F
That‚Äôs on Duv.
Like why. Someone tell me why
We have no one that will win 1 on 1 battles. Duvernay practically fell on his ass
Wait was that on Lamar or did duvernay just give up on the route
The offense is back to using arm punts
Bruh why we throwing 50/50 balls to 5‚Äô11 guys so much come on lamar
What the fuck man. Its never easy with this offense.
Ah the fucking arm punt.
Nice punt Lamar learned from the best
Jesus just run the fucking ball
Fucking bare minimum help for lamar man
honestly that‚Äôs not even a terrible pass to me. duvernay didn‚Äôt find it or make a play on it
Dez has outsnapped Hollywood this game I think the FO and coaching staff agrees with us
WE ARE NOT THE CHIEFS STOP THROWING UNNECESSARY ASS DEEP THROWS. FUCK
If that was a top tier wide out it‚Äôs a huge play.  One on one coverage and the placement wasn‚Äôt even bad.  Dev was lost down the field.
All the great QBs have a guy then can sling it to downfield sometimes and just have them make a play
"that was a good throw im not mad at those calls, duv had to do better there"
"We were doing well, we could have just kept running it, but damn"
Derek Wolfe says no sir
Why do we always kill our own momentum!?
Not much you can do against that. Good throw good catch
"Offense just looks off. One play it‚Äôs a bad pass, another it‚Äôs a bad drop, another it‚Äôs a bad play call. A lot of inconsistency making drives very choppy."
That stat line is creepy
Ferguson getting owned on these play action plays
Henry fears Elliott
Judon's being held.
If Elliot played over Earl we might have won in the playoffs
Looks like the defense has decided to go home early
Not Wolfe
Please hold them here
Need some pass rush here
Thank whatever god y‚Äôall worship
Odd call imho
Offense has to step up right here. Make a statement dammit!!! Have some pride!
Feed JK
We need a vintage 8 minute td drive right here
I need the name and number of everybody in the nfl thread who was talking about Lamar being a backup in three years and how his MVP season was a fluke
"I don't hate the long pass call in itself, I hate that it was used on 1st down. I mean, at worst run twice before you throw that and then if you want to use it on 3rd down"
I didn't like that play call at all...
Feed dobbins
Big willie
SNEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD
WR1
"Snead, bester Mann."
"Pitch it and let the rb take the hit man, we can't afford to lose you"
Lol Holden was holdin
What the absolute fuck
LETS GO BOYS. WE GOT THIS. KEEP FIGHTING!
Refs once again fucking us over
DAMMIT ENOUGH WITH THE FLAGS
We‚Äôre going to get fucked by a shitty spot.... wow
Fucking false start. We have no discipline on those.
That was BS.  It should be 3rd and inches.
Jesus christ.
we cant even get a better spot?? Eat a dick
For fucks sake
He was WIDE OPEN.
Fucking overthrow
How the fuck does this shit keep happening?
Let‚Äôs fucking go
This passing game is fucking GARBAGE
This fucking team
we got screwed on that spot
DuH tHe SpOt Of ThE bAlL wAs ShOrT oF tHe LiNe tO gAiN
Peters beat again.
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING PETERS
Wide open. Peters got burned again
Just hold them to FG JFC
Peter's again just blowing coverage
Need a stop here wtf
What the hell is happening in the secondary
Peters getting spanked this half
Lol. Defense checked out
lmao what‚Äôs a tackle
WHAT THE HELL ARE Y'ALL DOING
Well this took a turn
MJ YES
Judon!?!?!??!!?
Okay Judon!! There‚Äôs that big play! 2 more.
Has Peters had any defended pass all game? Seems like whenever he's on screen it's a 20+ completion
Most fake tough team in the league it‚Äôs crazy
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE DEFENSE DOING???
JUDON DID A THING???
Cmon d
WTF WAS THAT
"Judon with a sack, almost forgot he was on the team other than when he commits a dumbass penalty"
ARE YOU FRIGGIN KIDDING ME!????
wow can‚Äôt even make a tackle
Literally just let him walk it in
#GOD DAMMIT NOOOO WE CAN'T LOSE TO THEM AGAIN
Fucking trash fucking tackling holy fucking shit
this is fucking sad bro
That was comically horrible..
"That‚Äôs all, folks

That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt talk shit"
"We don't want to win, plain and simple."
Spineless fucking team
Can‚Äôt wait till we blow this game then fuckers on this sub say we don‚Äôt have a right to be disappointed or we are still an elite team.
Fucking tackle!!!
SOFT
Queen is way too inconsistent
Ok lamar perfect opportunity to prove the haters wrong.
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!!!!!
This defense is fucking soft
The defense just quit.
We just got BITCH SLAPPED WTF
Trash ass soft defense wtf
You have got to be FUCKING kidding
"No Romo, it means the play clock hit 0."
Gonna go 4 and out
4 people can‚Äôt bring him down are you fucking kidding me
That's fucking embarrassing
Make a tackle 4 players couldnt stop HOW!!!!
Absolute trash. They had him dead to rights.
Catch me killing myself tonight boys
WHERE THE HELL IS THE HEART THAT WE HAD EARLIER
Pathetic
MAKE A GOD DAMN TACKLE YOU SOFT FUCKS
well... cant blame judon. he didnt blow 4 straight tackles
Lmao this shits just funny at this point. Like a dark comedy
Got to play harder than this... Anybody thought Judon should've hit Tannehill much harder than this? It could've been at least been a fumble.
Snuggly soft smh
PcPhee took the bait so hard jesus
That was embarrassing and we should be ashamed.
Fucking meltdown
The only explanation I can come up with for the TD play is that the Ravens were trying to lose.
[deleted]
Judon was in another universe in that play
Bruh Patrick Queen making bad decisions ALL DAY
Finding new ways to lose. So disappointed in this team.
My joke about both browns dropping everything is now no longer funny :(
"Unfuckingreal. But also, not unreal. What the fuck is this year??"
So typical man shouldn't even come to this
Fucking so disgusted
Yo snead dont scare me
"The tackling in this defense is so beyond atrocious. It‚Äôs unfathomable. That was the easiest drive the Titans will see all season, and it was with the game on the line. Pathetic."
This season should be a fucking wake up call for next year.  These guys thought it was going to be easy after last year
14 unanswered points. We haven‚Äôt even gotten into FG range since our last score
Lol we got that off too
Time to see what this team is made of
That bobble üò≥
Can't say I'm very optimistic but we'll see
GAME WINNING TWO MINUTE DRILL
"Can we just get the FG here? I mean, that really shouldn't be that difficult of a thing to do. If we don't, then we REALLY need to ramp up construction of the heliocentric orbit insertion device."
This drive is going to define Lamar. I believe he‚Äôs going to lead us for the win
The thing that's been killing us is penalties on both sides of the ball. That is coaching.
Play for a td not fg please
Andrews strong af. Way to get OOB
We should just run it here and get into fg range
GO LAMAR
Mandrews on display
"Use the fucking plays we had last year. Be smart. 

But knowing roman he'll do something stupid"
LJ looking nice this drive
DEZ
"Ok, just don't give it away."
False start lol love to see it
Forget the FG I want that W
Marquise was finally about to do something
DEZ
gimme a dez game winner
These false starts man.
DEZ XXXXXX
Mekari snaps it when nobody expects it fucking hell.
Another 100 yards in penalties week
That would have been a td
name a better combo: our center and trying to throw drives
How did we ever start Fluker over Holden at right tackle
Center messing us up again? Seems familiar :|
"That would've been a TD, fuck."
Fuck the refs
Touchdown to Hollywood LFG
Don't give them the ball back
Draw to jk then spike
Why is he snapping it?
Please just win it
Let's get this dub boys
OT smdh
run it to dobbins please
He had a chance with Dez and Snead.
All that time and NOBODY can get open SMFH
I kinda wish they had a surprise run play in there with a timeout still remaining but oh well
"I didn't want to go to OT... but guess that's where we're headed.

Finish this one out the right way guys."
Can the Ravens please get some fucking weapons. Goddamn
"Overtime baby

Anyone else having chest pains?"
"Tucker is so good, I wasnt even worried aubout that kick"
Pleaaaaase don't fuck up this drive
Was that not a penalty for the guy who jumped over the center
Beautiful drive too bad tho
Let‚Äôs get this win in OT
"We have done better than I thought, least there‚Äôs that."
"""I'm punting on first down""  LOL Romo is hilarious"
"&#x200B;

Overtime!!!"
Romo with his Tucker love showing
Please give us the ball.
"WE GOT THE BALLLLLLLL,"
"It‚Äôs your time, Lamar."
"""we want the ball."""
BIG TRUZZZZZ
"I BELEE GOD DAMMIT LAMAR LETS GO MAN, FUCK"
"All the crazy games vs the Titans and this is really the first OT game, huh? Wow."
"Come guys, let's bring it home"
Give us a solid drive for 6 lamar come on bro
TAILS NEVER FAILS
I just hope our boys are having fun :(
HERE COMES THE 90 YARD DOBBINS RUN TD
Let‚Äôs go Lamar they can‚Äôt stop your shine.
Pls lamar
DOBBINS. Use the man
Just what we need before a short week...
RUN THE FUCKING BALL WHY ARE YOU TRYING THIS FANCY NONSENSE
I HATE THIS OFFENSE LOL
The fuck was that?
"needed to bounce out to the right, slipped and sacked lmao"
OMG
"A... screen?

Am I in real life?"
Oline play collapses with a chance to win the game and in OT. Baaaaaaad timing.
Fuck man. Thats a fucking joke. Throw the fucking ball away man
They really don‚Äôt trust Lamar man fuck
Well what did we expect? 3 and out
hmm guess 6-4 doesn't sound so bad
That was a quick OT.
Fire Greg Roman
"It‚Äôs OK, I didn‚Äôt really wanna win anyway"
reminder that we would have won if the refs didn't invent a RTP on Pernell
Roman what the fuck
That was depressing
Love when they talk about the nervousness around how far we can punt it and Koch is like beeeach
Why didn't we use that screen on 2nd üò°
Well that was uninspiring
"Feels like a lack of heart. Win or lose, we got mentally beat"
Went out with a fart
I have absolutely zero faith in this team except for Justin Tucker.
"lol going to lose to gostowski of all kickers. Great drive their, defense is tired from last drive, we run for 2, slip/sack and checkdown. Dont worry Henry wasnt killing us in the 4th"
Haha imagine that they get a first down easily
Our secondary has been absolute shit for who we have out there.
Peters or Humph show the fuck up please
"""gg people"", just leave the thread, enjoy your sunday"
"Short run

Sack

Screen

Punt
 
I don't know what I expected"
Small Truss
Corners have been terrible last 1.5 quarters
This team just doesn't have it this year for whatever reason.
Man just imagine if we had an o-line and could tackle
Had him five fucking yards deep
"Get these kinds on the practice field doing OKH drills till they learn to tackle, my god"
Long FG range already.
Wide fucking open. Its over
We going into 3rd. 3rd!!!! That‚Äôs what this team is
"No coverage, no tackling..."
Oh wow Marcus Peters can tackle?
We had this game too man. We fucking had it.
The titans have a banged up line and are slicing up our all pro corners. No reason the Ravens coudnt have done this against their weak ass defense playing 10 yards off
"Another injury? May as well.

Fuck this year."
We peaked this time last year.
We‚Äôre not winning anything this season. Don‚Äôt get your hopes up. The defense is injured and soft and the offense is hit or miss with crappy o-line play. Rebuild this offseason
This team is defeated
that‚Äôs it
Yup that's game
Brown is open every fucking time
We are fucking frauds
Thats game. What a bullshit team.
Why are the DBs playing so soft?!
Really do love the taste of swiss cheese.
"Well, bye"
Shit ass  team
I can probably tackle better than this team
Lmao
Defense let them walk all over them
In come the fucking memes. Jesus that hurts
"Pathetic. Just pathetic. Not Ravens football. 

Gotta be some changes after this loss. The WAY we lost, plus 2 in a row... something has to change. We have zero killer instinct and discipline"
#FUCK GREG ROMAN
Football sucks. Goodnight.
Pain.
Time something happens with this team. Change needs to be made. Because this team is an embarrassment.
"All Romo said since the second half started is ‚Äúthey‚Äôre selling out on the run to stop Henry‚Äù

What the fuck was that then? How did the defense get absolutely mauled since the 4th Q?

And the penalties holy shit I can‚Äôt take the penalties"
The crowd is still more lively than madden 21
PI not even looking at the ball
Romo is terrible I‚Äôve been saying this
I think no preseason is really hurting Lamar and his throwing ability
Time for Lamar to prove he has the stones to complete a 2 minute drill comeback against a good team. Put up or shut up time
"Byard never gets his head around, how is that not dpi?"
The fact there is a chance the Browns could take second place today makes me feel yikes.
Nice starting the game with a 3-and-out and a penalty -_-
Without the turnovers this D really is garbage
"Thats PI, thats screening"
This is what Queen should have done in the endzone
It is so infuriating watching is play teams with defenses that actually defend passes. Meanwhile we allow 60YAC
I was harsh on roman but our players really cant execute and theirs can
"This team was built based on fan reception and it shows. We went for flashy bullshit and have 0 depth or players than can make a statement, and the ones we do we don't use."
Queen jumping the wrong gaps every time
Because dancing will make me want to buy GAP clothes
#This is gonna be another long day if we dont score during this drive
I have officially turned on Hollywood Brown. Not worth a 1st round pick. Wack.
"Run, Run, Run, Run, Run, overthrow WR by 15 yards, Run, run, run, Pass completion to Mark Andrews. Man this playbook is sick."
One of our players needs to spit in Simmons face before the game ends
Friendly reminder that the Titans were hoes and almost sank the entire NFL by not following covid protocols earlier in the season
why take the timeouts if you‚Äôre just gonna run it out?
Wait a minute... is this some sort of offense? Sorry but those aren‚Äôt allowed!
Elliot laid the WOOD
This motherfucker missed everything against the steelers
Let‚Äôs trade Hollywood.
Arm punt on first down. Interesting play call.
If Lamar could throw the deep ball before the WR is at the top of their route that'd be greeeeaaattt
Awful play call. Absolutely no reason to make such a risky play.
"Just run the ball, control the clock, grind out 1st downs.

NAH I'm gonna throw a fucking bomb to my undersized 4th round WR WOOPS"
Humphrey is having some trouble today..
Time for pass plays here since Roman is an idiot
Holy shit we're going to blow this game I can't believe it
"Ryan ""Lamar Jackson"" Tannehil"
Defense is crumbling but this is on the offense. They've mostly contained Henry for the majority of the game. Offense has squandered away their opportunities to put it away.
we lost. I am a Lamar stan but I have no faith in him + Roman bringing us back.
"Choked the Steelers game away, choked this game away. Team full of chokers."
Lamar prove what you can do. This fucking drive. Right here.
They (the Titans and their fans) are going to clown us hard after this one and we deserve it.
Would've liked a to see a 50/50 ball to Dez there.
it would be awesome if we could draft some defenders that had arms next year!
GG
Why did we give Marlon 100 mil to be mediocre hes been picked on all game
Fuck this team. No consistency whatsoever.
lamar had a pretty good game
"how can you people with optimism STILL look at this team as good bruh

it's ridiculous"
This team is a fucking joke. This was supposed to be our biggest statement game of the year and we fucking blew it.
I‚Äôm not watching on Thanksgiving. I‚Äôm not trying to have my holiday ruined.
Not inference on Byard? Can you run into a guy like that?
Anyone else think Romo is actually kind of a garbage announcer?
Fg ain't getting done unless we can get some stops.
Prayin for Henry nonetheless
"Anyone who thinks that INT was Lamar's fault should go seek out the replay on [NFL.com](https://NFL.com) or ESPN, Duvernay fucked up badly, he didn't locate the ball in the air and jumped for it way too early.  He looked like Raheem Moore out there.  Inexcusable.  Good receivers catch that ball with that exact positioning of themselves, the defender, and the ball, 9 out of 10 times, and break up any chance of an INT the other 1 time.  That was a complete disaster from the receiver that that somehow wound up an INT instead."
"At some point, doesn‚Äôt have to be today, or even this season, but Lamar needs to be able to take a game over with his Arm"
Just let them score here
We deserve the loss now. This team needs to sit and rethink what they are doing this season.
#The Browns will make the playoffs but not us. 2020 is a trip man
Ready to fucking die inside ü•∞
Here come the soulja posts...
That's one of those plays where we give up but can't connect on
I hope they give that will Holden guy a shot next series... fluker can‚Äôt block anyone
Hollywood Brown is a #2 at best. We know this. Put Dez in.
Please don‚Äôt get blown out boys do it for Yanda
Are we going to have a Hayden Hurst-Mark Andrews situation with Queen-Harrison now?
defense is the only reason we are 6-3
"Fucking trash vision by Lamar and even worse red zone  play calling scheme. 

This is a god damn waste."
Is this a battle of who sucks the least today? I mean not a whole lot of excitement lol. You can blame that on our play calling though
CUTE PLAY CALL BUT WE'LL TAKE IT
I can literally feel the Harbs fury from the suburbs of Baltimore
yeah titans offense not doing shit  but we keep bailing them out wtf
Failing to stop that fourth down play fucked us here
We could be throwing the ball downfield..... Greg Roman Wtf
I wish they wouldn't show injury replays tbh
I‚Äôm actually surprised that we‚Äôre winning....Need offense to put this game away
The fact that Cam probably really picked out that guys outfit for that commercial is disturbing lol
Shotout to all the people in this sub last week saying this team was done and was going to get steamrolled by the Titans üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
SIT YOUR BITCH ASS DOWN HENRY
What was Peters doing?
Peters has never been a good cover guy.  He gives a couple of those plays up every game.
Man Titans looking like the ravens. Dropped passes and injuries. I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs not us.
Jesus that was a gross pass
Bad call but Duv didn‚Äôt really fight very hard for it
"Listen, even if Greg Roman called that, it's upto Lamar to either make that throw or don't do it. Greg is controlling his arm."
If it isn‚Äôt there don‚Äôt throw it
Why did duvernay tackle better than peters tho
4th quarter? Time to choke the game away!
Why we're not going to Snead more is beyond me
Cmon Lamar you have to make that throw man
I had a feeling we‚Äôd lose this game coming in. Then I see this team showing some life but then the they just choke it away.
just let them score...need to score again to win  anyway
"So. Mentally. Weak.

We're obviously still in it but this effort sucks."
Haha we're garbage defense
Even if it goes 24-24 I don‚Äôt trust this defense in OT rn
#The Browns will have a better record than us lmao
expect 3 overthrows in a row and done.
How can we be this bad
refs missed the delay of game
"Zero chance our O takes it, even for the tie. Zero hope in Roman."
What a play call by Tennessee.
I am pretty much done this year. This team is going nowhere fast
How am I going to make it thru 2020 if I can‚Äôt even enjoy my football anymore?!
"This team has got a reputation for being mental midgets and after defending them for so long, I'm done after today if they lose."
I thought the no call on what should have been delay of game was bad; the tackling on the play was even worse
This defense literally imploded. Holy fuck lol. What a meltdown.
Come on Lamar I have faith
"Blame of the game my ass, we got this"
My life just flashed in front of me
JESUS CHRIST WHY CANT WE FUCKING RUN THE BALL
How do you not throw it to dez there
our passing plays are bad man
I fucking hate roman
There‚Äôs the tuck tail bitch made shit I‚Äôve come to expect from these pussies
We have already lost
This team has earned that 3rd place in the division. No fucking heart top to bottom
"Honestly... if we even MAKE to the playoffs, which isn‚Äôt looking good, we‚Äôre going to get creamed in the first round #UnpopularOpinion"
Welp. Time to go back to tuning football out of my life. At least I‚Äôll be more productive.
Our offense and defense are both complete trash right now
This team is soft as baby shit.
titans won't do jack in the playoffs as usual anyway
Defense literally quit
"Can't wait for the loyalty police to slam me as a ""doomer"" for acknowledging we're not making the super bowl this year

You idiots know who you are."
Maybe we can be bad enough to draft ja‚Äômarr chase.
Upvote for all those who believe in our Ravens.
That should be PI. Defender wasnt playing the ball
1st and 22 let's run it.
"This is all coaching. Don't do a dumb ass challenge with little to gain. Run it up the middle with gus on third and 1. What was there to gain on the challenge? You lost a time out in a close game. 

Look how their offense kills us with a banged up line. 
They run it well and playaction to wide open players.  No excuse for our offense.  We have the advantage of teams devoting resources to lamar"
3 yards of endzone behind him. Throw was short and could've been the difference between a TD and giving a beaten DB seconds to recover with the ball mid air.
Good drive. Oline still an issue. Receiving still an issue.
WHAT ARE THESE RETARDED MOTIONS
I‚Äôm good with the Powers hit.  At least he‚Äôs busting his as to make a block at the next level
"Clipping definition: In gridiron football, clipping is the act of a ""throwing the body across the back of the leg of an eligible receiver or charging or falling into the back of an opponent below the waist after approaching him from behind, provided the opponent is not a runner.""....i dont think that was clipping at all"
Lamar‚Äôs regression as a passer is so fucking disappointing
Marcus peters looks like a bum 50 percent of plays haha
"I am done with Greg Roman!  We need to protect the ball, move the chains and eat clock.  WTF!"
How do you fucking let them convert. I wish our safeties knew how to fucking break passes up
Fuck this team
Fucking sorry ass team
This Thanksgiving game might be the first Ravens Steelers game I ever pass on. I'm not letting this shit ruin my Thanksgiving. Fuck whoever scheduled this shit on Thanksgiving. We aren't winning.
Idk what to expect today
Okay this cbs who's in whos out is the dumbest shit I've ever seen
Do we start with a spread run n shoot offense?
On these hoes thy shall stunt
Let‚Äôs get it y‚Äôall. I don‚Äôt like our odds with the injuries but if Jackson plays well and we keep the ball away from Henry I think we got a chance. Gonna come down to time possession.
First im hearing Skura got replaced.
Holy shit the AFC is competitive. I‚Äôm actually happy 1 more team gets a shot in the playoffs from a neutral standpoint.
The game isn‚Äôt even on in MoCo it‚Äôs Washington and Eagles/Browns WTF
Willie Snead vs AJ Brown what a matchup
I‚Äôm struggling to see how this game goes well. Any given Sunday. We stand as much chance of winning as they do. But it‚Äôs going to be a frustrating game.
"Got a lot of key people out and a new center.  Let's see if this team can spin gold out of straw.  Between Harbaugh and Jackson, I think they're going to Rumpelstiltskin this mofo."
Thank God they showed that overdose commercial back to back I was able to get some and save my neighbor in 30 seconds
"If Justin Ellis plays as lazy as he played last week, Derrick Henry is setting a record or something."
LETS GOOOOO
Big truss
Bold prediction: we hold Henry to under 200 yards rushing today
Truss UP BOYS!
Oh fuck the titans.
Time to put up or shut up. New O-Line and Lamar led the pregame hype huddle. Lets GO
Washed all of my lucky ravens gear after last week so we should be set
What happened at midfield? The Titans just took over our logo?
Your place is at the one yard line bitches
They disrespected the shield.. it's fucking on.
Come on Ravens!
gus is starting at RB today
Ironic coming from the most nondescript team in the NFL
Lol I love Harbaugh
Butler talks too much :(
Fucking flag
Dez Bryant!!!!    **üòçüòç**
Smh
I don't have stats to back me up but the Ravens never do well when they get the opening kickoff.
Lol we started fluker
Weird but i think thats the first time i‚Äôve ever seen a ref with facial hair
Solid 3 yards
Good start....
Here we go with the bs
One of those games haha
Are you fucking kidding me.
here we go with the fucking penalties. Tired of this mess
Yay!   More penalties.   Again
I am already crabby
I almost can‚Äôt be bothered. Already I just can‚Äôt deal with this again.
Pass rush is atrocious
Refball AGAIN. God damn fuck the nfl
Imagine having more than 2 seconds to pass in the pocket lol
That alone is a reason to take more deep shots.
Look at Marlon man
i hate penalties
An aggressive call on first down?!?? What sport are the Titans playing?
Great job!  Wink is going to blitz to stop the run.  Pretty good idea
Humphrey looked big mad
"When you can't get sacks, this happens."
Humphery tackling Henry like that is actually really fucking difficult
No hold on 49? ü§î
trash D right there
"Nice takle Elliot, fucking jesus"
"So many holds on us and they aren‚Äôt being called. Fuck it, we got to sell the holds more"
Get that Xbox Elliott
"Once again it seems like some teams are allowed to have the receivera engage in blocks before the ball is in the air, and for other teams that's called OPI"
I. I just don't. I don't understand how this defense is also as predictable as our offensive play calling.
Last in red zone TD%. Yikes
"Going after Queen, what's new."
Really not feeling good about this game.
This team isn't even fucking competitive right now. Everything on this team besides Tucker and the secondary is not good enough right now.
Did anyone else watch the highlights of the playoff game in 2001 where Ray Lewis stripped Eddie George? I miss that kind of defense
Ya‚Äôll act like we aren‚Äôt missing half our defense and playing probably the best RB in the league.
Jonnu Smith has the most TEs out of all TEs
teams drive down the field so casually on our defense all the time
Offense has to carry today.
They flexed on us
"We don't run bend but dont break defense anymore, we run break but don't bend. 

Seriously it seems like every drive is either a 3 and out or TD"
LJ Fort is not so great in coverage is he?
Defense getting picked apart again
Alright offense it‚Äôs your time
Massive Yikes
That was a very soft defensive series
Why do we always fall for the late releases
fucking pathetic
That was a clinic. Fuck man
I‚Äôd pay money to mute Romo
Not ideal
So far we have a drop to go 3 and out and a huge penalty to let them cruise down the field for 6. I k ow we are hurt but man can we just wake up a little
Is it January again?
Pain
Another one of those days...this team is soo disappointing.
God damn the defense is bad
I remember being super happy for the Yannick trade and thinking it was gonna make our pass rush elite. Boy was I wrong and wish we had those draft picks back. I cant say I've heard his name called one single time since the trade. Swing and a miss there.
"Look at that nice TE rollout. I wish Greg Roman could scheme this shit.

The mix of runs with bootleg and intermediate out routes to TEs and Slot WRs are so nice to see. Titans do what the ravens should so but roman is incapable of it"
Crazy how much the defense is dependent on Calais playing
I‚Äôd like to see a turnover for us
so what did I miss so far?
Get Duvernay out there and spread TEN out. Change something up fuck
"What a play, wow. Ugh."
Lamar needs to run the flying fuck out of the ball.
Can we get the refs to start tossing players assaulting players out of the game?
Coaching needs to tighten up lets go!
"Pacing. Let‚Äôs turn it on, Roman.. ya quack. You saw it in the second half of the Colts game and it worked!"
Ingram doesnt have it anymore. I love him but please feed gus and Dobbbins.
Come on soldier
Terrible
Hollywood gets no more fucking targets.  Fuck him
Fuck marquise
Soulja...
Oh look souljah dropping another first down catch
Souljas don't drop balls
Jesus Hollywood
lol
"Wow Brown, really? Omfg????"
Fucking middle school sized hands
2 drops already wtf
Lol these 2 lines are getting punked I understand there‚Äôs a lot of injuries but I‚Äôve never seen 300 pounders go backwards as far in my life.
Holy shit trade some crab cakes for Julio Jones pls
‚ÄúSoulja‚Äù
Our o line is so ass we had to start our benched center lmao
What the hell brown
YEAH SOULJA FOR SURE!!!!!
Mark Andrews makes it happen every time  üëç
Soulja down
Hollywood lmao
GET INGRAM OUT OF THE GAME
STOP. RUNNING. INGRAM
Ingram sucks coaching has been so ass keeping his snap count up
Get brown off the fucking field.
Ingram sucks this year
Take ingram out. Feed Gus and Dobbins wtf
Where the fuck you at Brown? What a dumb fucking drop.
Mark > Marq
hollywood rlly dropped that
Hollywood should've kept his mouth shut smh
Maybe spend less time tweeting and more time working on your game
Look at that burst by Dobbins  ingram is done no point in using him
Andrews and Lamar the only ballers on this offense. We need to draft a receiver because Brown is suspect.
When was the last time Ingram had a 10 yard run?
stop giving the ball to fucking ingram and hollywood jesus christ
"To whoever It was I said I thought brown was a better receiver than Snead, I think I might have been wrong on that one."
Dobbins time
"Take Ingram out, it needs to be the Dobbins and Edwards show now."
Omg we actually got a call in our favor
Dobbins fast
Flucker is god awful. Is Bredson or anyone else that bad???
smh
Good offensive drive. We need the D to step up
Fluker is too slow
The Titans Center missed every practice this week yet still played? I don't think I've seen that before.
Frustrating af
i understand he wasnt the RT but i miss yanda
why cant long snappers be centers? like would morgan cox suck at being a center
Ok d we gotta come through
much better drive than the first. still not what we need
We need more than 3 next time
"I can‚Äôt believe a 5‚Äô9, 170 pounder is struggling in the NFL!! shocking!!"
Hill might have to beef up and play some slot
WRAP UP PETERS. FUCK
Are they gonna mention the playoff game after every goddamn commercial break?
Lmao this defense ain‚Äôt stopping this run game
It begins
God damn what a hit
The Titans are going to use Henry so much his career is going to be real short lol
Please ravens. Let's get the win
Middle of this defense needs some beef
Queen buddy....
"I know it‚Äôs early, but we really need the D to find a way to keep them out of the end zone on this series"
Cmon D
"Every offensive position on our team rn is hot garbage except those with ""back"" in the name"
I like to see it!
Perfect defensive play
"I'm sorry ~~Mario~~ Ryan, but your first down is in another castle."
Thats what I‚Äôm fucking talking bout
LFG LFG LFG!
FUCK YEAH!
we needed that so badly!
Fucking beautiful
who said bowser was assü•±
So is Harrison are staring Lb now
LETS GOOOOOOOO
Absolutely beautiful
ROCK HIS ASS
LITTLE BOY TANNEHILL
Great pressure from Queen!!!!
Bowser has been plying well
[deleted]
LETS GOOO DEFENSE
that's game
"Did anyone else hear Tony Romo call Patrick Queen ""McQueen"""
DONT SLANDER MY QUEEN
You just got Queened!!
OFFENSE HAS TO CAPITALIZE CMON NEED A TD
Yall need to chill tf out. We are still the fucking Ravens. Since when did we get uncomfortable being the underdogs?
I expect to see a lot of Patrick McQueen memes tomorrow if we win this game!
KILLA QUEEN
"Bowser with the INT, cuz that hit was from Queen, not a Princess."
"I don‚Äôt think Queen sucks by any means.  But, one play doesn‚Äôt suddenly make him great either.  He‚Äôs a rookie just needs a little work in some areas."
NOT A DARK LORD BUT A QUEEEEENNNN! TERRIBLE AS THE DAWN
LET'S GET THE SCORE. LETS GOOOOO
Now if only Bowser or Ferguson could keep that high level of play for a whole game and be consistent....
Can we make a difficult catch please
Hollywood needs to make catches like those
LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!
why was that subway commercial funny
Dobbins OP
Keep Dobbins in. Ingram can get minimal touches.
"Seriously keep JK in

Ingram should be his relief and Gus the pounder in quarters 3-4"
Feed Dobby
This is why ingram sits
It's dobbins day don't take him out
Feed JK!!!
Why why why why is Boykin in there? Give Dez his chance man.
Feed Dobbins
Dobbins a beast. Keep him in
Our receivers are bottom 10 in the league at getting open
"I feel like we‚Äôre coming down and linemen. You suck, you get pulled."
FEED DOBBINS
Dobbins is objectively far better than Ingram at this point in his career. There‚Äôs no reason he shouldn‚Äôt be getting at least 50+% of the carries. He‚Äôs phenomenal.
Why are they taking dobbins out?
Why TF does Bowser look like a better receiver than our actual receivers...lol
No hate but if thats Ingram thats a 2 yard loss
Dobbins is money.
Jesus fucking Christ
What the fuck was that?
Why we do start Fluker and than take him out lol
Well... At least that was first down
I'm ready for Dobbins to take half the carries and then when they're tired from chasing him you put in Gus to destroy them and Ingram for a spell or goalline.
Dobbins >>>>> Ingram and Edwards
That‚Äôs actually pathetic on Roman
"dammit Gus, you gotta focus"
That's the fire we need jk thank you
What was Edwards thinking there?
"Dobbins is so good, Ingram should not be on the field much today"
KEEP DOBBINS IN HOLY SHIT
Might be the worst play call all day.
I swear to god I am seeing Ray Rice in that uniform
Greg Roman. That‚Äôs it. Sheesh
Holden gonna be the new starter
If I ever see Ingram in for Dobbins again I might have a stroke. Feed that man!!
"1 step forward, 2 steps back. This offence. And why take out dobbins? That‚Äôs the coaching decisions I can‚Äôt stand."
Can NOBODY get open? Every throw is into tight ass windows
Gus Edwards never needs to run a. Jet sweep but wtf
WHAT THE FUCK ROMAN
Simple shit working so it‚Äôs time to complicate things to the point where we beat ourselves
"Ngl Ravens lack discipline, we gotta know these plays instead of relying solely on innate talent. They lack the edge that made them good last year"
So much unnecessary motion
Edwards blew that play
Offensive line lol
I really never want to see an empty backfield in the redzone again.
How the fuck is this happening this shit needs to be ironed out in practice wtf
We‚Äôre so pathetic
"This committee is fucking idiotic, among many other things with this offense"
I‚Äôm done.
What a poor 1st and goal drive. What are these guys thinking?
So many miscommunications on offense this year. Fuck Greg Roman
How about just running the ball more.
This is hard to watch
All it takes is 1 out of 11 to make a mistake on a given play...
It‚Äôs so stunning the hot trash our O has turned into in 1 year.
Bad
this is so bad. so fucking bad. it's all coaching
[https://i.redd.it/djhykqgs6u061.png](https://i.redd.it/djhykqgs6u061.png)
Wtf is this red zone play holy shit
Every single offensive lineman was immediately stepping backwards after the snap
lmao fucking jackson shitting the bed again
Yikes guys. We just aren‚Äôt moving the ball.
Can't these announcers shut up? Stop trying to jinx Tucker.
First round pick is definitely going to a lineman next year
How many times have we been disappointed with the offense in the Harbaugh era?
Too many points left on the board. Hopefully doesn‚Äôt come back to hurt them like it did against Pats
Just a brutal waste of a turnover there. Come on
Why do we always abandon what's working once we hit the red zone?
That jet sweep fuckup killed all of our momentum. I love this offense but when 1st down doesn‚Äôt go for positive yardage our line/receivers arent good enough for drop back passing
Put Justice Hill on Defense I wanna see something
This offence is painful to watch.
Hill is having a nice day on specials
Justice Hill is fucking killing it on ST
This O Line breaks down withing .2 seconds man.
Justice Hill MVP
who do we have to sacrifice to the football gods to be able to develop and use wr's right
If Lamar can't through outside why even line up a receiver out there? Just throw in an extra tackle a be done with it
Lamar missing open WRs because he knows they just gonna drop the ball lol
Hill making some great tackles on kickoffs out there today
Defense has been decent offense keeps missing opprotunitys left and right
Our creative blitzing is confusing the hell out of there OL.  The coverage just needs to hold up better.
Man the Titans act like they hate us
We need a td and take advantage of these opportunities
Tucker game
please lord give Dobbins the ball
Lol @ all these scuffles.
Let‚Äôs get Dobbins going and maybe call play action or some passing concept more than +10 yards so these DBs don‚Äôt all play 3yds off the line of scrimmage.
For those calling for Romans head if he were to be fired it‚Äôd be after the thanksgiving game. I think the 4 day turnaround is too short for a new OC
Give me a TD or give me death
JKs vision is ridiculous
Okay we definitely need to be playing Dobbins more. I don't think there's any doubt.
Dobbins kinda having a breakout game in a crucial match up.
#Stick with DOBBINS you coward
"Jk getting too hype, greg needs to take him off the field"
If we come up empty in the fucking endzone again. Especially with dobbins running like he is.
YES DO THE FEED ME DOBBINS. FUCKING TELL ROMAN
Dobbins is a fucking monster
KING DOBBINS.
EAT DOBBINS EAT
Dude this mans is a fucking tank and a cheetah. Jesus Christ
Dobbins is like Ingram was last year holy crap lol
Feed JK! Let that man eat!
Jk!!!
"How the fuck you pull Dobbins in the redzone, has he had a run for less than 5 yet?"
Did Lamar just get titty slapped?
We have 19 pass yards good lord
Good play by Peters too
Dobbins is hype AF. Feed him that ball.
Keep feeding Dobbins
Clean pocket finally.
Lamar gotta hit that he was open
Needed to be a second earlier
Just one deep pass. Just one. Jesus.
Lamar having a bad game.
Good pass. Great pass actually. Brown is fucking tiny though. Hes not getting that regardless of whos throwing it
Dez would catch that TD...
That was a good playcall by Roman.
And offense is stalling again
Ok everyone wanted Lamar to throw deep and he did.
"Trying to catch that on the chest again, Idk man"
Our O-line is literal cancer. Complete drive killers
[deleted]
Our O line is an absolute joke.
If brown wasn‚Äôt 5‚Äô9 man
Brown looks like my 15yr  old brother
Dez wide fucking open on first
"How the fuck do they jump up without looking and manage to hit the ball that's 2 for 2. 

/#1 WR make that catch 9/10 times."
MARK ANDREWS HOLY SHIT YESSSSSS
Need to put Dez in Brown's place. IMO.
Andrews catching the ball today
I‚Äôve totally forgotten about Andrews. Glad he‚Äôs actually showing up today.
Thats the ravens offense I want!
Was it holden or false start?
Mark Andrews is the only reliable receiver we have today
"You gotta throw that sooner, he smoked his ass"
Mark Andrews is so clutch in third down!
These are 2 TDs Lamar missed.
Why don't we use Dez ever
At this rate Dobbins will have 100 before halftime
JK Henry!
Our next Agent 89
I think Lamar may have the most extreme strengths and weaknesses I‚Äôve ever seen. He‚Äôs like the nfl version of Dennis Rodman.
TD here will change this game.
Hey thanks for the push idiot lol
üó£ PUT DUVERNAY AND DEZ IN MOREüó£
Lol they pushed him in
The tackle gave us the TD on that play lol
Project Pat
holy shit we might actually win this
Down at the 1
Lol not even close
Ricard got his food that time.
BIG PAT!!
Thanos meme: Dobbins and mark on Thanos face ‚Äúfine I‚Äôll do it myself‚Äù
"I ALWAYS GET HYPED FOR FB TDS FOR SOME REASON

Edit: Shit"
That's coming back but hey it'll be 1st and goal at the 1
Seems as if we‚Äôve woken up
GUS ME
Throw it to Andrews.
Just put lamar up the middle under center
Lamar playing well today and we're moving the ball. Give the rock to DOBBINS!!
Vrabel isn‚Äôt scared to cut his dick off cause he doesn‚Äôt have anything to lose
I like Dobbins too but this play is for Gus Edwards. Just a run straight down the middle
Pat hit that man like he stole his DoorDash
This game more than any shows that we need to give the rock majority to DOBBINS
"Don't fucking throw! Put Ricard or extra OL in and run it up the gut.

Of you do anything do a PA out to a TE and run everyone else up the gut"
Run it in! Don't get cute Roman
Andrews is so dependable!
"&#x200B;

S'Okay...We still got the Touchdown"
I agree with the call
Let‚Äôs go JK
feed JK
Nice.
Lets fucking go
Nice keeping Dobbins in the redzone this time.
How tf is that not a first
Why do I think that roman is surprised this worked?
DOBBINS!!!!
Luke Willson getting juiced for both the Pat TD call and JK's TD makes me so happy
Get in there bitch
Another review smh
JK deserves that one anyway
RAY RICE BABY
I literally love dobbins
What's under review? Can't y'all just give us out damn TD and let's move on?
So talented.
GOT THE 2!!
That was a nasty play
Yeah baby
"Fuck it, just put Dobbins at every offensive position 

11 dobbins playing on the field is what we need"
And love seeing Ingram dancing with Dobbins on the sidelines
RAY.K. DOBBINS EATIN FUCK OUT THE WAY
Anyone got a link?
"Well, that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not Habs"
This is what it must've felt like to watch michael jordan...
This will go down as the ‚ÄúDobbins‚Äù game
Damn Greg Roman is killing it with Dobbins.
Fuck yesssss
JK ALL DAY
Hayden Who?
Yeah we have a RB1 now
Can someone make a Big Boi Little Boi meme with Dobbins and Henry?
Calling it now. Player of the Game is Dobby!
He does it all!!!! WR #1!!!
Give dobbins an actual oline and he's gonna be putting up dalvin cook type numbers in a few years
Well that was a legitimately great 2pt playcall!
Props to Roman for that play call. Feed Dobbins!
A Titans player musta dissed Dobbins mother
Fucking LOVE seeing dez getting so hype and being so supportive so far
That looked like a train wreck at high collision wow!
Anyone else notice how Tucker purposely pooches all his kickoffs to the sideline and lands them at about the 5? This time they got to the 25 but it seems to work out more than it doesn‚Äôt
Dobbins might have the best balance in the league
Titans Kick returner trying to commit suicide today
Horrible play by ferguson
"Won't be able to watch the game cause I'm cramming some shit for uni, but it's good to see the ravens leading! 

Also Tuck still automatic I see."
"Man this sub has really changed it‚Äôs tune. I also don‚Äôt like Roman but man we gotta stay optimistic. We have LAMAR JACKON, we always are in the game. Big truss"
That returner gonna be hurting tomorrow.
Bruh helmet is off fml
Fuuuuuuck not Queen
Our defense needs to not get cocky now and still go for blood with Henry.
Fuck that looked like it hurt
Damn Queen got straight kicked in the face
Okay it's just a bloody nose hell be okay
Force them into mistakes.  Right on
Wouldn‚Äôt be a big Ravens game unless one of our key players got injured (this one seems ok though)
 Not been a great game for Marlon ‚Äúdrop the s‚Äù Humphrys so far.
Tanny has missed two key throws for us already.
Pressure is getting to Tanny. Good. Keep him out of rhythm.
rYaN TaNneHil iS a WR
"Hump getting lucky a lot today, seems to be out of position a lot"
"Any Curb Your Enthusiasm fans here? ‚ÄúTracy had something to do with the neck injury?‚Äù made me think of, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs only two ways you can injure your neck.‚Äù"
Yo FUCK Derrick Henry. He just straight up cleated my boy Pat Queen in the fucking face dawg. Let's knock this clown around.
Ngaukoue pressure there
No one gonna talk about how that man has 7 tackles and it isn‚Äôt halftime?
Dude was wide open
Fuck
Still no sack but Yannick made him throw it
I just called that to my gf
Is queen ok
Man we got lucky there
YOOOO WTF
Why are they so open every time
Outcoached badly
Romo is so good at explaining things that I would‚Äôve never understood. Makes me respect how good our players are too.
Yannick disruptive
Fuck us
Doo doo throw by RT
That stings
Good pressure Yannick
I just want to see Henry get stripped of the ball
Fucking jacksonville sucking ass
I smell a Fruit Punch coming üëäüèª
Killer after great stop by D
on a fucking fake
That was a perfect throw though lmao
LJ FORT IS THAT GUY
LJ Fort with the big play! Pass coverage has been tight
"After all the fake punts we had, I can live with the taste of our own medicine"
"they should just put woodside in, seems to pass better than ryan"
Fort is such a good football player
I feel like any time a team runs a trick play against us it works. Except the Browns of course but they‚Äôre the Browns
ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS
HOW
Fuck these refs
BULLSHIT
Penalty is fucking ridiculous
Seriously every game
Fuck these refs
Above the knee. Right as he threw it. RTP???
I don‚Äôt think he realized that he got the ball out.
How the hell was he supposed to stop in mid air?
THATS BS
I genuinely forgot Ngakoue was on our team
He was already in motion ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Were we always this bad with penalties? Yikes man
Thats a joke
How sick would a Fort jersey be?
Need to stop them here. They get the ball to start the half right?
"Unrelated note, I made Chesapeake fries, I've never missed going to games so much"
Can't wait for a PA to Jonnu Smith or corey davis we leave uncovered..
Put the mask over your nose Lamar
Yannick again
Harrison is gonna be an absolute baller for us in a couple years
Fuck off nantz
How is the clock moving??
Why the fuck is the clock running
Ngakoue finally getting pressure
You are all stupid if you thought that wasn‚Äôt sarcasm.
Yannick is a monster.
big stop!
Get fulker tf outta here
Yannick is eating the depth tackles alive today
So we're not even going to try to get down the field?
Good morning my neighbors!
Oh a d a flag cool
Yeah after the clipping call best to just head into the locker room
The fucking LB jumped back which resulted in the hit not hitting him at the hip. Come on.
Dobbins üî•üî•üî•
How are we feeling about this game?
Missed the first half. How did we look?
Lamar could have been more accurate in the first half hopefully he cleans it up.
Guac and Dobs are showing up big time.
Ok guys don‚Äôt blow it
Need a quick stop and a quick score. Time to start putting nails in the coffin
Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but ain‚Äôt we 0-3 when we start with the ball on offense and 6-0 when we start on defense
How about a Derrick Henry fumble recovered by Queen
would really like to see more of Duvernay on offense. Offers alot more than Boykin
this defense is impressing me so far
Really surprised and impressed with the defense there! Great job
Get off the field!
Excellent defense.
Wink is coming in fucking clutch!
Oof bad checkdown
I feel like it‚Äôs been ages since we‚Äôve seen the offense
Hell yeah defense
Let‚Äôs keep stuntin on these hoes boys
That commercial was funny af
Anyone got a stream?
Beautiful call by wink there
#DEZ
Dez getting targets hell yea
DEZ
DEZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
Dez finally gets a catch!
Anyone not nb happy for dez. Imagine hollywood had have run 7 yards backwards
Hes still out there!!!
THROW IT UP TO DEZ
I think we aren‚Äôt using Dez a lot so we can blast him at the Cowboys
JK really doing that number 27 justice
Dez caught it
Got damn JK
Hell yeah Dobbins
They can not stop Dobbins lol
Dobbie McDabbie
dobbins is a beast
KEEP FEEDING DOBBINS!!!
GET OFF ME
JK BEEN STUNTING ON THOSE HOES ALL GAME
"Hey look at that, someone else got called!"
That concentration on JK
Lmao house elf Dobbins
Lmaoo Romo calling him Dobby
This Dobbins mf literally does not go down
Waahah waaaah waaaah
Stfu lol
I think it‚Äôs cool that Romo is announcing Dez‚Äôs first reception in 3 years
"yes give the fucking ball to Dobbins, look what happens"
Penalties on the opposition? On two consecutive plays? What world are we living in???
What are they talking about dobbins didnt grab the mask he pushed it its different
JK all day man. He's playing outstanding today
That‚Äôs what it takes for a call to go in the ravens favor
"Sorry guys, ‚ÄúDobby‚Äù is canceled."
BLESS UP REFS!
"Wait, a defense is making stupid penalties allowing the offense to march straight down the field and it isn‚Äôt ours?"
I really like seeing Dez on the field.
"wait, is that how teams feel against us?"
"‚ÄúJK to command tower Baltimore, permission to take off‚Äù"
Lol that throw
I just looked up the stat line to see what our receivers are doing: combined 2 catches for 9 yards...
MARK
Throw a flag on Vrabel
DAYUM
Ok finally we don't suck
BEAUTIFUL PASS TD ANDREWSSSS
What a pass!!! There‚Äôs our MVP!!
YEAH BOIIII just like them good old days
WOOOOOOOOOO nice call nice execution
Roman REALLY wants to keep his job
[JK Dobby](https://imgur.com/ZEHLgcW)
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT ALL FUCKING YEAR
"&#x200B;

Touchdown Ravens!!!

&#x200B;

Jackson to Andrews"
Yesssss finally
What a fucking play.
Great throw
#LETS GOOOOOOOOOIOOOO
#FUCK YEAH!!!!!
LFG BOYS
LETS FUCKING GO
TOUCHDOWN!!!! FINALLY
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about!
"Perfect throw, clean catch"
Thats a big play love to see it!
"Taking Boyle away forced them to shake things up.  Losing a good player is never a plus, but maybe some small positive can come from it."
Defense will come out bangin'
JACKSON getting comfortable! Ooooh CANT wait for the others to start stepping up
"I'm no professional, but I have been saying all along that getting the run game going would open up the passing game."
"Now we just one of those for Dez, maybe one for Brown too."
This is more than I could have bargained for
Ugh I have to go to work in an hour... someone call out for me!!
Oof Burrow got killed.
Not bad for a running back...
"LAMAR üòÇüòÇüòÇ

FUCK YOU BUTLER"
Chipped by Demetrius Jr!  lol
Lamar is a dog lol
HAHAHAHHA I LOVE IT
Oh shit boys no handshakes today
Burrow is probably out for the year. Nasty hit to the knee.
Let‚Äôs fucking GO!!!!!!!!!
I love it
DESHON OMFGGGGP
God damnnnn
#BRICK WALL SON
damn that was a huge hit on henry i'm impressed
thats a big boy play
Henry got tuned the fuck up!
Even big boii Henry felt that
Derek Henry with the Bernard Pollard hit!
Fucked him up!!!
"Well Henry, if your goal coming into the game was to kick every Ravens player in the head, what goes around comes around"
Henry just got bulldozed
Great tackle by Elliot
oOoOOoOoF
BRO He brought Henry down to his Knees. Literally
Hope Henry‚Äôs alright
clean
ELLIOT BABY. He isn‚Äôt Norman you ain‚Äôt throwing him Henry lol
"Whoever made that thread saying Elliot was gonna punish Henry, GREAT CALL lol"
That‚Äôs a big boy hit right there!  Deshon made Henry his bitch
Pressure needs to get there!!
Wtf are we doing
It's simply not possible for this team to play well on both sides at once lmao. Fuck this
why blitz there? 3rd & 4 against a poor OL... cmon
Peters went for the run
Peters looks deflated
Wow good job peters..
Regardless who wins both teams gonna be sore tomorrow
"we blitzed on 3rd and 4 instead of dropping underneath coverage for out routes...

wink martindale... idk about him. let yannick hunt while you keep the back end covered."
Wait is Burrow hurt?
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAA
lol wut
Now eat shit!!!!!
Fuck that trickery!!! Lol
HA!
Now that's what I call good karma
Lmao they did what we did last week
Titans are nervous LOL!!!!
HAHAH FUCK YOU!
that was so satisfying after last year
Damn had his whole hand in his helmet
Soon as I say cant let em respond with a drive here they get a 50yd busted coverage bs completion. But before I can finish my comment.... ty titans backup center.
Did that count as a sack for Yannick?
I wonder if that little camera buzzing an inch above their heads all the time gets annoying
Proche for the first down!!
More proche
Proche sighting at WR
Lol Vrabel looking like he has a migraine
"Look at you Duvernay, catching the ball and not immediately falling down like Hollywood does."
A proche sighting!
SOULJAAAAAAA
SOULJA
Looks like LJ and Brown want to have a great chemistry but just don't have it.
Vabrel‚Äôs looking very stressed out lmao
Take that 5 every time
We need to out the screws back in browns foot
Feed the rookies
Running the exact same play with dez again
Dez
Brown isn‚Äôt being very Soulja.
I wanna see Lamar stiff arm the shit outta Butler
"Hollywood sucks man, trade him and get us a real WR."
proche!
Soulja down bad rn ngl
Hollywood is a complete non factor. He‚Äôs not out there anymore on run plays with 1 WR.
Dez with more catches than the Soulja
"Easy, normal play. And Lamar and Brown can't connect on a simple 5-yard out route.

I'm glad we got the 1st regardless but man, what is the problem."
PROCHE THE FUTURE I BEEN WAITING SO LONG TO HYPE HIM UP
Is dez picking on butler as well?!
I‚Äôm glad dez is getting looks
Come on lamar
Bad throw
Bruh why
Not ideal
Fuck
God dammit
Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Fuck that sucks. We got this though. Keep the energy!!
I disagree
Whyyyy
I don‚Äôt get it. I really don‚Äôt.
Fuck Simmons
I hate everything
Not a great decision by lamar but the play calling has been bad.
Ravens need to run bruh
That's 100% on Duvernay
Not a great pass but Duvernay gotta play the ball a bit better too
Too hight Lamar but you still got it we have to take deep shots
THOSE ARE THE KIND OF THROWS THEY NEED TO GIVE DEZ HOLY FUCK
Had a good drive going and that play call was horrible. Why throw deep when you're trying to run out the clock. At least it was an arm punt.
Kyle boller throwback
The ole punt interception. Flacco was the master of it
"Cbs shows look God awful.

I want you to love me? Yeah you can want that all you want. Good luck with that"
"Honestly tho,  a lot of Lamar's deep throws today have been wounded ducks. Lots of floaters."
solid tackle by Duvernay tho
That was an absolute shit show of Duv. You can‚Äôt even call that a play on the ball haha
Is Greg Roman listening to the broadcast for play calls? Those two throws back to back out to Dez were sus
Wolfe unblocked.
üê∫
RG yeeted out of there lmao
No pressure and a conversion
how dare they butcher a Fleetwood Mac classic
Why rush 6 with 2 of them rushing way late? That's essentially 4 rushing with 2 out of the play in the backfield
Lmao we couldn‚Äôt just kill clock and kick the fg earlier?
Visa is my favorite small business
Ferguson biting on that bootleg again
They are getting on a roll here
Ugh this sucks
"Why do we ALWAYS bite on bootlegs, rollouts and screens. **DO WE TEACH EDGE AT ALL**"
Elliot plays with absolutely nothing to lose and I love it
So we concuss Henry and now he's running all over us? Oook
"Come on, stop letting Henry cook..."
cmon we can't lose to henry again
Elliot saving a lot of plays out there
Williams looking clean
Oh fuck hope I wasn't to early to compliment the D line...
Back to biting nails
"Regardless of the outcome of this drive, we need offense to come back and play cool. We were never gonna end the game on this defensive drive. Need to keep working the clock, and ideally get points."
"Why would you kick it there and not go for it?

Struggling to understand Vrabel here."
Need at least a field go on this next drive. Just win time of possession and we win the game
I think they're going to send all they've got at Lamar on this drive.
Don't worry guys if theyre just gonna keep relying on field goals they wont be able to beat us.
Just give me a goddamn field goal here at least
Break off a massive run pleeeeease
"Hop on the Gus Bus, Roman"
Dobbin and weavin
We cannot go 3 and out or a turnover this drive absolutely cannot
Wait till the clock hits 2 every play
NEED FOR SNEAD
When you have the need we have the Snead!
That is the reason right there why Skura isn‚Äôt a tackle
We‚Äôre getting so fucked right here lmao fuck off
These calls are unbelievably bad.
That spot was so bs
Of course....
I hate our oline man lmfaooo
What the hell?!
SMDH
Bad throw
Huge stop incoming. COME ON.
How many fucking penalties
We need to just switch to mainly screen and yac plays this shit is infuriating to watch
This has a recipe for disaster... yikes
Give us one more stand on defense.
They keep talking about Andrews but 66 fired even earlier.
"-5.5, nnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo"
jesus these injuries
Stinks
"backed up near their endzone, cmon defense carry us yet again!"
We have big boys but damn they slow.
We never play QB spy plays
"Tannehill has way too much time. Ngakoue, we need you here, buddy."
they can complete things where each of our passes are painful to see. not going to get the ball back this game
Peters got beat so hard on that one
How are the Titans still in this
This defense looks done
Peters wya
Just give me LJ Fort and Malik Harrison out there. I don't understand how Queen always seems to be in the wrong spot.
Sorry but we can‚Äôt play the refs and the opposing team and hope to win when our team is performing subpar.
Marcus Peters is well done today. Cooked all day
Need a big defensive stop here
Board fucking whiffed
Defense is shitting themselves lol
"Fucking garbage ass defenders, what the fuck is that"
So glad we have Marcus Peters
Here we fucking go again can't wait
So we can‚Äôt tackle anymore huh
Holy fucking shit this team...
I see we got burnt toast Peters today
Why the fuck is Board guarding AJ Brown
Wow. That was awful tackling.
I see we've forgotten how to tackle
My god what are ya'll doing
Tackle plz
Lol if only he could hit that easy ass pass
That was a total joke
LOW EFFORT LAZY TACKLING. FUCKING WOW.
This defense is trash.
Lmao were so fucked
We better not snatch defeat from the jaws of victory
cmon
I think they‚Äôve gotten at least five yards on every play this drive
stiffen the fuck up
I can‚Äôt with this defense anymore.
Gonna need one more scoring drive from Lamar.
The word they forgot was tackle.
"Dobbins carried the offense, and made him sitout nearly all the second half. Got a bad pass/bad route on a first down throw leading to int, then that last joke of a drive. Not looking forward to see the offense to try and win a game lmao"
Gonna come down to automatuck
OKAY JUDON
We just aren't very good. Few bright spots today but last 20 mins has been pitiful
LETS GO D!!!
Dennis Pitta has too much praise for the other team when their offense is clicking.  He's Ravens radio.  Shut up!
I‚Äôve seen this story before they will score go up here and we will come up short
STOP THE COUNT!!!
BAD SNAP! YES! I LOVE BAD SNAPS!
LETS GO JUDON
Fucking pathetic tackling
OMG pathetic
What in the absolute fuck was that
Zero fucking tackling. WTF
Learn to fucking tackle.
Fuck me. Make a fucking tackle. Fucking fuck.
"moments like this are judon frustrates me, he has moments where he's good but then does dumb stuff the rest of the year"
What the fuck ever man
Zero heart.
Embarrassing
Unbelievable.  Defense lets us down this time.
what the hell was that
What a surprise.
What the actual fuck
Unfucking Real.
Clark is having the best day...
I'm sorry guys but this is funny. Like this is we're a joke kind of funny.
Ouch
Pussy team
What a fucking joke
WTF
Wtf was that
wow.
What. The. Fuck.
we fucking deserve to lose with this soft ass defense on this drive
Where was the tackling there.
So thats what YAC looks like.
These guys aren‚Äôt Ravens
"I‚Äôm sorry guys, everything went to shit once i turned i started watching, i‚Äôm gonna change the channel now"
Hahaha
that's embarrassing
PATHETIC
we're fucked.
Stop going for the strip and lay the wood.
God we need to gang tackle way better
This defense can't stop a nosebleed with the game of the line. Pathetic
Jfc we need to work on defense
Fuck me in the ass
We need a clutch td drive
Who saw this coming?
Marlo with an ALL TIME horrible tackling attempt
We need a clutch td drive
Wow
"&#x200B;

Okay Lamar.....It's time to put on your big boy pants and win this game üèà"
Who is ready for justice hill
Absolutely outcoached.
I 100% knew this would happen. INT and FG next drive killed this game.
our offense and tackling have been poor today.
"I give the defense some slack because of injuries, but Marcus Peters is routinely beat on long routes."
those 3rd and long conversions ouch. oh well another blow out
"Injuries got us this year. Good team, but we lost too many heroes."
Useless
I am in disbelief
Weather is clear we can do this
Fuck everything
"Time to make up for the choke on the last drive, offense"
"That felt deliberate on Queen‚Äôs part, we‚Äôll see if that saved time pays off"
Snead!
3 and out is what I‚Äôm feeling but I hope not
"This week, on Days of Our ~~Steelers~~ Ravens"
This is an embarrassment
#BELEE
I had my hopes up
"What an inspiring defense...

Go get some big receivers who can catch please. 
We‚Äôre talking making deep run when we‚Äôre still fighting for our playoff lives here."
"Honestly it‚Äôs good that the O have this chance. 

Defense played excellent until the fourth after the offense turned the ball over and sucked ass. 

Redemption time"
"THE DAY AFTER MY BIRTHDAY, ALL I WANTED WAS A WIN AGAINST THESE ARROGANT BUMS, AND Y'ALL PLAY LIKE THIS??"
Time to crank this shit up another level
Is it that hard to grab a players leg and hold on? Holy shit
Lets go offense!!
Lamar prove me wrong PLEASE
Just no turnovers
DEZZZZZZ
Deeeeezzz
Good shit. Dez
XX
Yeah we need 7 here.
XXX
so far so good
Love it but go out of bounds dez lol
Holy shot we can win it here
What a fucking block by Dobbins!
There you go Lamar. Get in the zone.
oh yea were in range
Butler with the hard head and the soft ass
"here's where it happens. Backed up by 2 penalties, and a bad throw on 4th and goal."
LETS GO DEZZZZ
If they‚Äôre on the field they‚Äôre in field goal range for Tucker.
DEZ
This whole drive shows why GRo has to go. If you can pull this drive out of your ass then you shouldn‚Äôt look like shit most of the game.
Tucker Time baby!
At least we have two TOs
WHERE Y'ALL DOUBTERS AT NOW
Fuck the refs
Damn that LlamaJax of old
Ok this lack of discipline falls on the coach to be honest. Harbaugh is to blame here
"2 timeouts left, you can run anything you want here"
THROW THE X!!!
WHAT THE FUCK THESE PENALTIES ARE KILLER
Omfg that was a touchdown
Refs are out of breath
Omfg that was the game winner god damnr
let's go lamar prove everyone wrong
"DRAW PLAY TO JK, OR QUICK SLANTS"
An their DBs have been playing really well today
Should hit andrews man
Damn I would go Dez 1 on 1.
That was a great drive
So much fucking cushion and we can‚Äôt do shit with it
Sus redzone plays again
WIN THE TOSS
Incoming 80 yd rush
Lamar go own it.
"Half expected judon to say ""we're kicking it"" at the coin toss ngl"
CHUCK IT TO DEZ YOU COWARDS
Score a TD here and end this shit. Prove the doubters wrong LJ
Let's do it cmoooooooon
STUNT ON THESE HOES
Lamar game-winning TD run Im calling it
SCORE A TD
Dez is has our second most receiving yards today üëÄ
Ok so this drive will define Lamar! Lol but I believe we get the win! Hopefully Hollywood gets us some big plays here
I belee in a thing called Dub!!!!
*fuck*
Sigh
That's the problem with Dobbins.
And that‚Äôs a great start...
Tuck the ball my man
Alright brush it off and get ready to convert
Bruh
Was that Lamar shouting?
Wow
They only need a field goal to win
Shades of Flacco *sigh*
Fucking unbeleivable.
This team is just so fucking annoying man.
L.
We are holding them all over the place and still can‚Äôt block for Lamar...
"Perfect, meeting my expectations"
Aaaaaaaand that's ball game
Limp fucking dick bullshit.
"We have not executed on offense well enough at all today, outside of Dobbins."
o line really didn‚Äôt do their job here that‚Äôs brutal
Good Game.
"That was rough man, this defense has not been able to do it"
Okay defense. You have struggled making the absolute must stop plays we needed this year. Now is the time. Let's get that turnover.
Someone make a fucking play pls
"Bullshit, OL completely gave up on 2nd down and that cost us the game most likely."
3rd in the North!
I must be a glutton for punishment watching this team every week.
"run on 1st down for no reason? check

sack on 2nd down w/ snead being decleated in his route? check

3rd down checkdown going nowhere? check.

LOL"
Cmon D
lmao wtf was that
The Titans are too good to not score here.
It‚Äôs okay we‚Äôll be 8-8 soon
"Andrews blows this game for us, blame one single play, it is absolutely the false start. Idc what else he did this game, that is the play that blew it. Yet again he shits the bed in an important game, just found a new way to shit it this time."
That‚Äôs so (2020) Ravens
Does anyone know the heimlich maneuver? Someone needs to save Baltimore from CHOKING!
Coaching usually wins in OT.
This team just leaves you so empty.
get peters out of the fucking game holy shit
Any receivers coming out of college you guys like this year? Lol seriously though
Terrible tackling.
And of course we can‚Äôt tackle
"This is fucking depressing 

Our offense is the same story every week. Defense is banged up and can only do so much. Fuck this season"
just learn to tackle
Look at all these bootlegs we don't EVER DO.
God I'm jealous of the WRs the Titans have
Pretty sure defense is cooked.
I‚Äôm killing our defensive backs bro they are such ass today.
Why are we playing so far back
C A N N O T T A C K L E
Time to fake the injuries to avoid the embarrassment
Welp we should get better next year
Great contain and then he cuts inside lol. What the fuck
I just don't see it right now
2 fucking games in a row the OLine cost us man. What the fuck
games over
This game is done man. D is gassed.
I can‚Äôt believe we are gonna choke this game away. So many chances. So mentally weak.
Cmon D
Welp
It always feels like we struggle to throw the ball up the field yet every team we play always has guys wide open and they move the ball with ease
This is just so easy for them. We fucking suck so much.
I'm over this season man
So hurt right now.... can‚Äôt do this
Field Goal range for Gost now. Up by 11 and ran the fucking ball twice
Our DBs are just there to tackle after the receivers caught the ball.
Unless Gostowski misses this game is over. This team does not deserve to make the playoffs
Yeah GGs
We are trash
How tf do you get no pressure with that many people rushing
"Well, this is shitty."
It‚Äôs literally pitch and catch. Too fuckin easy
Everyone we absolutely need a stop from the defense this year we just have not got it.
Goodbye
Making AJ brown look like fucking Julio
Lol we suck.
Wow
Lol fuck me
Well that sucks.
Embarrassing. Make changes.
we are pathetic- out toughed- outlasted
"Game is probably over at this point. 

If the ravens lose, i'm calling their season tbh."
That‚Äôs so Raven
"lol oline holds falling down, nothing"
FUCK THE TITANS
My god we need Campbell and Williams back ASAP and we need to draft exclusively WR and Oline fuck this man
Winnable game left out on the field yet again.
What really pisses me off is that they get our hopes up like we're going to win and then they pull this.....
Fuck everything
Fuck this
Pain
Rip
"When Tony Romo, the announcer, knows all your def plays. How can you not lose?"
Sucks that our schedule is so easy to end we might luck into playoffs
draft 3 wrs and 4 o linemen i don‚Äôt give a fuck
And Pittsburgh is next. How fun
The browns are better than us right now.. what a fucking joke
[deleted]
Gotta go after Corey Davis in the off season.
Fuck tony romo. Idk how anyone likes him as a ravens fan. Five games with him now and he's such a fucking prick.
Lamar has to win this or else his reputation is etched in stone
Popped into this thread two possessions into this game and see people are saying we‚Äôre gonna miss the playoffs and go 8-8 and remembered why I don‚Äôt come in here during games my god
This is becoming a coaching problem. I love harbs but holy shit man.
Out-coached and out-played once again üòÇ
I don‚Äôt wish injury on no one but fuck the titans üòÇ. they want to dance on our logo that‚Äôs karma
Our d carried us to 6-1 our offense is so shit
"Idk what is happening. Hollywood never dropped passes in college or last year. What did this team do to him, like wtf actually happened. Why does it seem like we shatter every wr‚Äôs confidence. Same shit happened with perriman"
Fire fucking Greg Roman he‚Äôs ruining the team
Duv has to fight for that
More points off of a LJ turnover...
"Lamar has been so, so bad this game. Play calling suspect per usual but he‚Äôs way off"
This season has been nothing short of a disaster
Patrick Queen has not played that well this season
Judon‚Äôs biggest play of the game
3rd place coming up
Tear it all down. This team is nothing
Coaching has been abysmal today Harbaugh is having a really bad year coaching wise fuck anyone who downvotes this it‚Äôs true he‚Äôs been bad this year
"Oh look, an offensive line penalty. Fuck this offensive line. These backup guys can all go next season. Absolutely zero discipline."
Why do refs call us different than every other team. Top of the league in every penalty category in a year where refs aren‚Äôt calling other teams for holding
I for one am not surprised at all. We‚Äôve sucked in every single game except one.
Overreactions in 3..2..1
The butthole is gaping
Derrick Henry has some doodoo on his back
It‚Äôs like we have no pride anymore. You would think that trash talk at the beginning of the game would have us fired up.
"We bout to get spanked, boys."
Our LB's are trash
"Next time Ingram breaks one for a 35 yard TD, I better not see any of you cheering for him."
We have some pretty mediocre souljas
Ingrams tank is on empty. Hes not producing anymore
"I made the mistake of saying Queen can't cover well to a know it all. 
15 messages later, I guess I'm in the wrong."
We just have zero attitude
Bro that's a pick six if thats MP and not Marlo
Good fucking shit
Yes a good play
Lamar is completely panicked out there.
"Everyone is saying Roman but that right there was Lamar, Dez was WIDE open."
"I understand the play calling has been no good. But Lamar is panicking in the pocket, getting faked by phantom pressure, and making poor decisions every game. There is plenty of blame to go around and let‚Äôs make sure it goes all the way around."
"Blah blah blah, blame Roman for everything, blah blah blah."
Ricard making my D hard with that effort!
Bailing Tennessee out with stupid penalties. We can beat them and should beat them
The titans really talked all that trash just to drop these passes lmao
I'd love to pair yannick with a real Edge Rusher and not some fat fuck who argued with fans on twitter (Judon)
"Not even trying to pass here, sad."
I was really hoping this would be a shootout
We need points points points
Damn bro I hope Henry‚Äôs ok
"Henry just got his bell rung. He's going concussion protocol. out at least this quarter, probably the game."
Awful throw
"lamar come on, we don't need to take deep shots"
Greg Roman thinks this is Madden.
Lamar's mechanics were shit in that throw and the pass suffered
"Roman literally can‚Äôt just call a strait forward game, he always gets too cute"
why is a deep pass even an option why our run game is so strong and were up one possession
this sub kept saying involve duvernay.....
Fuck how is our 3rd down defence so bad
Feeling bad about all the injuries
Lmfao this shit is so scripted. I knew it. Most important drive we choke.
that 3rd down call was so bad by the Titans I‚Äôm starting to think about this being scripted
I start Hollywood in fantasy every week just waiting for a breakout game üòÇ
God damnit Lamar!
I swear if we choke this away....
buckle up boys. They score a TD and we'll get to showcase our incompetent never able to come from being offense
Marcus peters getting burned ‚úÖ
Embarrassing defense üòÇ
That's what a receiver looks like hollywood
"Peters, Queen, Lamar blame of the game. Holy fucking shit."
No playoffs this year.
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL
This wouldn‚Äôt have happened if lamar was accurate on 3rd down
1st quarter bandwagon fans checking in to give again.
"Live by the punchout, die by the punchout"
Mental fortitude of this year‚Äôs team is lacking.
I counted at least 2 holdings but ok
Woah! We won the toss! Let‚Äôs just call it there
Fucking judon finally doing something positive.
I don‚Äôt trust this soft ass defense in OT at all
WHAT WAS THAT GREG ROMAN PLAYCALL
Oh well.
gg
I can‚Äôt believe we drafted marquise brown (will never call him Hollywood) over AJ Brown Dk Metcaf....
Lol Marcus peters is such a little bitch
This is by far the most overrated secondary in the fucking league. Yes they can get picks occasionally. You know what‚Äôs more important? Consistently tackling and not getting burnt like a motherfucker once a drive
"Sure why not

Blow it up. This team is garbage."
THIS SEASON IS AT BEST A WILDCARD 7# SEED LOSS
looking like its time to take off the jersey
"Fuck this sorry ass team. This season is over and anyone who thinks otherwise is a delusional fan boy, 

We are not making the playoffs and we don‚Äôt deserve to either"
That's game. Fuck this. Why do I get up at 5am every week? Can someone remind me not to do this again. I hate how weak we are.
Well that‚Äôs the season.
Season over.
THATS OUR RAVENS YALL!!!!
"Any single player or coach who says ""we like where we are"" after this game should be cut/fired"
I‚Äôm so sick of this team this season
4 and out incoming
Bad throw by lamar
Someone here mentioned Romo always saying good things about Lamar... I haven't heard him say one thing this game without taking the Titans' wang out of his mouth
That throw was awful. Lamar getting more excuses.
we really gotta get another TD cuz they could still win this. Never forget how dumb Roman is
I've never found Colbert funny. I don't really see his appeal.
"Lamar could hand the ball to the other team for a turnover, and this sub would still find a way to give him an excuse."
We might actually miss the playoffs. Very real possibility we are 6-5 after next week.
Remember when this offense was fun to watch?
"Guys, everyone is hurt. They can't do anything they did last year. Face it. This defense is average at best right now. Not surprising that the titans are driving down the field."
Sooo Lamar gonna have to win this game with his arm? On to Pittsburgh I guess
"Oh well, guess we'll try again next year..."
How can you be mad at the defense when a ticky tacky PI call gives the Titans 30 yards? Fucking bullshit.
Lol I would certainly hope our 1st round selection could put pressure on a QB when he's called to blitz and goes unblocked
You guys are hilarious blaming Roman for that one. Dez was open.
Tony Romo isn‚Äôt on his A game today
Anyone know the context on that black dude losing his shit in the interview on this CBS ad?
How was that a penalty
All on Lamar. He had all of the time in the world right there
"We're up by 8...Drive is going our way... Let's just heave the ball up, instead of giving it to Dobbins and run some clock.  But no, fuck it we like to screw our momentum."
"This is an attempt at a flag. They're not kicking.

edit: bad coaching. Henry gets that 1st down."
"I'm getting pretty concerned about Lamar's ability to throw. For every good throw, there's 5 like that."
So sick of this team. I can't seriously enjoy any player since 2012. Every one is a hype douche even the ones that are good like humph. All fucking talk and no bite in big games
Tucker is once again the only good thing about this sorry ass team. Been one hell of a super bowl hang over.
Grats its over
"Gg, hope we miss the playoffs for a higher draft pick"
Lamar isn't accurate
This thread is so full of ü§°s
How does Mark not make that catch for fucks sake make a difficult catch for once in your life man.
We are also dealing with major injuries on both sides of the ball so I‚Äôm not really sure what some of you all expect?  It sure as hell was never going to be easy
Lamar needs to get out of his own fucking head. Get the ball out to the open receiver and let them do their work.
Why the shit are we throwing the ball!?
We had momentum and Lamar threw a fucking deep ball on first down.
"Chill, we r 2 possesions into the game."
We'll be lucky to make it in as a wildcard.
Malik>Queen I will tolerate no slander
Where the fuck are the Queens a bust jackasses right now? Fucking clowns
"Fuck Andrews for not catching that, making Lamar look bad and shit 




Am I doing this right, r/Ravens?"
"welp, overtime is a loss. Everyone knows this. Henry is a late game monster."
"Big game for us today. We are better then what our record shows. 

Also this is for any Steeler fans lurking. You‚Äôve played 3 winning teams all year. And another tough matchup today for you all.."
"I'm not feeling too confident today, guys, but I'm with this team until the end"
Refs are fucking us since Harbaugh took off mask.  Fuck all refs.
Letting them easily convert 3rd and 11 smdh...
"No pursuit, no tackling, no hustle, no awareness, and no physicality. You really do get the total package with queen."
Easy peasy
"Just relax and set your expectations low. However low your expectations might currently be, lower them a bit further. This game is probably going to be awful to watch for us."
Turrible
Football is chess and we are Marion Tinsley
"Can we just call the season, get our guys back healthy and give it another shot next year?"
Ight imma head out
Lol please correct this. Are you really about to get beat down by this team again?
"Holy fuck, the outside was completely open."
"Lamar dropping too deep again, gives a better angle to the DE"
"I swear, in this thread drive-to-drive we either should give it to gus more, or Dobbins more, we‚Äôre either gonna miss the playoffs on one drive then we‚Äôll be fine the next. This thread is exhausting"
"This just in, banged up o-line and d-line are playing poorly!


More at 11, we discuss how scientists have discovered that water is in fact WET"
Play Dez you cowards!!
"Justice Hill? More like Justice HIT.

I'll see myself out"
Thats gap commercial is pretty dumb
no flag..thought for sure late qb hit flag was coming
Romo is garbage ever since he got his new deal
"Was it Harrison or Queen that hit him, I thought it was Harrison but everyone is saying queen"
"Offence is done. We don‚Äôt deserve the playoffs. They deserve to sit home , pissed off. GR got to go. What is he thinking. Put the fucking ball in the end zone !!!"
Dez wide open on that slant and Lamar pumps while looking at him. You have to make that throw brother!
We have to score a damn TD. Marlon is getting torched by AJ Brown and it‚Äôs going to lead to more points
"Fucking hell, Lamar."
"I really hope we get Boldin out of Dez we need it so bad, idk if there‚Äôs just 0 trust there or no plays being called his way :("
Let JT kick it don't get cute imo
Outcoached
Just throw screens on us all game. Can‚Äôt defend them for shit.
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU RUNNING IT?? My fucking God might as well just send Lamar out there with training wheels
Damn. I hope he‚Äôs ok
Looks like something could be broke. I Hope jayon is fine
I wish I could mute Tony Romo
Please god please get a touchdown here....I know it won‚Äôt happen but holy shit that would be huge
Where are the people who thought the refs were apart of a conspiracy against the Ravens lol
Fuck Butler
Hope Henry is ok! He‚Äôs a beast. I like the intensity though
GOST YOU BETTER MISS YOU CUNT
People are calling us dirty wtf
Why are we not running ahead????
hubris.
Lamar wtf was that shit
No need for the deep shots. Just win time of possession
"Can McDonalds bring their fucking all day breakfast back?

I mean shit."
This team. üòÇ That drive could've essentially been game.
"And just as I started to praise Lama's second half self......

Edit: I actually did pin that one on Duvernay. Can't give up on a pass like that when you're in front of a defender."
God why couldn‚Äôt it be like this last year? When we were even better too.
Great catch. Damn
Nobody goes to a car dealership wanting to buy an Acura
"Queen just be running around. Not doing shit, not tackling, not communicating. Just out there running around getting paid millions."
Terrible fucking throw
Every drive a gift of points for the Titans. I‚Äôm fucking tired.
I think we need to accept that our offense is not going to turn the corner this season.
"I think when it comes to deep passes, Lamar i just a lil too late releasing the ball,"
Boy you can just feel it
This team looks done.
"Good news! After they score the TD on this drive, we have enough time to watch Greg and Lamar not drive back for the win!"
CAN WE PLEASE STOP BLITZING ??
So was Lamar just a flash in the pan or something ?
Spend all this money on defense just for this bullshit to happen
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
Did I just see a shorter person?  Or was that regular height but in comparison to these beast players?
OH WHAT A FUCKING JOKE THIS TEAM IS
Lol they had every right to dance on our logo we're a fucking embarrassment
GG zero faith in this team. No mental toughness and it doesn‚Äôt help with us playing the refs too.
We deserve to lose this game. Holy shit wtf
I don‚Äôt care if it‚Äôs unpopular fire all the coaches. We can‚Äôt close out big games and it‚Äôs been an issue for years.
Losing today puts us at 3rd in the Division. This is the season
ISTG if Roman insists on more deep passing...im gonna lose it
"Question: how many 4th quarter comeback victories does lamar have?
Can't think of any... Maybe at pitt last year."
I hate our clock management skills lol
Fucking sad
WIN THE TOSS
Think we lose the game if we don‚Äôt win the toss in OT. Defence is gassed and Titans have the momentum. Hope I am wrong.
"Cheers to everyone who said we lost after the titans scored and to the dude who said 4 and out when we got the ball.

OT WIN COMING UP"
That fucking INT is the only reason we're going to OT. Fuck Roman
That last play was a pathetic play call. Design better pass plays.
"The comments in here are so negative right now, it makes me sad. The ravens obviously have their issues but get it together people. Belee!!"
damn. surprised we took the ball there. Offense hasn't been good & is coming off of a tiring 2 min drive.
A fucking screen really
What is Gary Kubiak doing nowadays?
What was that.....? We deserve the loss after that series.
Being a Ravens fan isn't as much fun this year as I thought it'd be.
D playing like the game is already over
Fucking pathetic. This team sucks dick.
Fucking choke
11-5 record. 1st round exit
"Everyone was right, we were wrong, this team is a fraud, blow it up."
This is gonna open up serious discussions about Lamar‚Äôs contract.
This sub needs to chill y'all so reactional.
What the hell happened to this team? It‚Äôs like we completely imploded.
Why are we looked at as such a good team? I haven‚Äôt seen anything redeeming this season except our ability to force turnovers.
Bandwagon fans jumping ship already.
FIRE ROMAN AFTER THIS GAME THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY AFTER THIS GAME
That's a penalty wtf lol
That was a nice play call. Great defence tbf.
So we're turning on our rookie linebacker today?
One thing I've noticed about Lamar is he tries to do too much. Look how much energy he's wasted already running around scrambling and throwing incomplete passes.
No discipline on this team. It‚Äôs astonishing.
That might be game smh
Lamars being outplayed by Tannehil.
Lmaoo this team deserves to get fucked ‚úåüèº
Sadly I just have no hope. :/ This game was a real bummer.
We are so lucky that wasn't picked
I‚Äôve always wondered why coaches hang onto players when contracts aren‚Äôt guaranteed in the nfl. Especially when those players are playing at below replacement level. All this to say **Cut.Marquise.Brown**
This sub is SO TOXICüôÑ
"Bunch of cry baby fucking pansies in these comments. Remember the last time we got a sb, we came through the wild card round."
lol Henry gonna break the single game rushing record
Some basketball ball players have the nerve to say football is soft smh.....
"#WTF KIND OF PENALTY DID WE JUST GET?? THIS IS BS

So are we not allowed to tackle now??"
Lamar both 1- is incapable of throwing deep and 2- is incapable of throwing outside the numbers
"The O-line sucks, Ingram sucks, Lamar is having a sophomore slump I guess, Roman sucks, Hollywood is disappointing smh"
"Was this team really just a flash in the pan? We still have a slim chance at the end here, but moving forward I don't see much in store for this team"
"Anyone who was a fan before last year knows this is more par for the course, calm down we ain‚Äôt going 14-2 every season. Have we looked good recently? No but that‚Äôs how it was during the Flacco era we will be fine."
"A lot of sus fans in here, time to eject lmao"
Here come the fake fans.
This team is so undisciplined it‚Äôs ridiculous
Lamar‚Äôs fault 6 people couldnt tackle
"I‚Äôll say it again, Fuck Marcus Peters"
I wouldn‚Äôt even be surprised if we miss the playoffs this team is such a joke this year
That fucking INT killed our game.  Change my mind
Henry gets stopped TODAY!!!
Do we trade up to get Pitts from Florida in the draft next year?
Stunt on these hoes lol
Ward must be in the doghouse to still be inactive
"NFL 360 about Mo this week. 

I'm not tryna cry on a Tuesday night NFL Network."
"Can somebody tell me a radio station to listen to the game on? I am not from Baltimore so I don‚Äôt know the local stations, and am using a radio app to listen while I travel today"
Thinking we get a win today still think Henry will go off on us
I wanna see alot of gus today
Demeatrice Jr wants retribution.
Romo has more confidence in Greg Roman than I do lol
Hulu live has the Steelers and Eagles games on. Is there anywhere online I can watch?
No instant start today?
OK I need a stream and apparently r/nflstreams is no more. Can someone help me out?
Feeling hopeful today. Let's eat this dub
fuck. live in montgomery county and they're showing the fucking skins game on cbs and eagles on fox
I'm watching a stream Cuz fuck Nova can someone say when the kick off happens so I know how far behind I am
"Wtf, why?"
thank god we got jim nantz as the commentator lol
Is this commercial part of the cbs intro because I see it every time.
I‚Äôm kinda of glad that this game isn‚Äôt on in my area and I can only watch it through redzone.
Here we go...
Lmao fuck malcolm butler. Dude is only relevant because of one play
What was that skirmish?
Nice fucking return
"Great return, let's gooooo!! Set the tone"
THATS MY BOY
"Got away with one, again."
Nice Duv
Dammit
Wait he didn't catch it?
Of course Dez gets a catch then that happens
Well at least they actually threw it to Dez can‚Äôt complain about that
"Fluker unfortunately has to be our best option at RT, but I can‚Äôt see why... dudes been ROUGH"
Awful punt lmao
That‚Äôs a great start
Shit
"LETS GO, 1 DRIVE 1 PENALTY"
Greeeeaaaatttt
Christ
LMAOOO
Already with the penalties
Hump was holding the fuck out of him
[deleted]
Lets put in Ben powers over Fluker
"First game of the season not on TV in my local market, so I am only catching plays here and there on red zone channel when they show us.  I know it would've been called back for a hold anyway, but it looked like Dez caught that 3rd down pass to me, why did they rule it incomplete?"
Fingertips man
Lol we getting fucked
Again awful playcalling by Roman and bad oline play
Hump is such a fucking idiot on this play
Awesome!
That is gonna happen all game I feel
Let us pray
"And of course, followed by a DPI"
They‚Äôre scared of Henry. And Titans called a perfect play for ut
Nice back-to-back penalties. Team really understood that message.
Funny the day after Humphrey says PI should be a 15 yard penalty he gets a 50 yard one
"Welp gonna be this type of game, was a a good PI call but God damnit I hate the Titans"
"That was holding, not PI"
Bullshit
Fuck sake Marlo
Fuck man
Sigh..  Washington vs. Bengals here in NoVa üëé
When will dez jerseys be available? Black dez jersey would be ü•∂ü•∂ü•∂
ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How am I already so mad after 3 minutes of game time
You can see his jersey right? HUMPHREY
Elliot has been getting exposed lately smh
Got it right that time
Deshon. Tackle please.
"Henry is sweet when he doesn't build up speed, he's not built to truck people"
I was so excited to watch the game but they‚Äôre showing the Washington game instead
Number 71 is HUGE
THIS TEAM MAN
This is fucking retarded
"Fill in the blank:

Fire __________"
Maybe they need to be embarrassed to wake up.
They're converting too easily.
This defense is so fucking soft
Quick screens and out routes jeep blowing us up
Queen already blowing coverages lol
Get Queen off the field
"""The most tight ends among all tight ends with 6"" - jim nantz"
Why do we refuse to cover in man
That fort‚Äôs man
I‚Äôm tired of our blitzing D getting picked apart by good coaches like when can we stop blitzing it‚Äôs both of our COs
we are not very good
"Welp, this is going to be a long day"
Oh well
Well that was easy
Right down our throats
Yeah this is going to be rough lol
Fuck
Already started drinking. Got long island iced teas and jameson on deck.
"Offense was just too hype because of the pregame bullshit, we'll get a tub here"
so can we take a deep shot now? seems every deep shot gets a pi call
Let them dance on your logo at midfield and then come out and play like a bunch of bitches... LOL
How many times are we going to give up critical yards on a chip block/leak???  Twice on that drive they got an open receiver off a chip block.  Not good!
"Well the one good thing about the opening drive was the Dez appearance, and that‚Äôs about it so far..."
Even with all that‚Äôs wrong we got 3 and a half quarters to go. I have faith that we will turn it around.
"Sadly, we all know if the offense can‚Äôt score 7 here, it may be a long day"
that was too easy
Let‚Äôs go Lamar!!!
Cowboys fan here. Can someone link me the Dez target by chance? Thankssss
How can I watch this if it isn't in my coverage zone?
Strong right and couldn‚Äôt get a yard..
Give the fucking ball to Edwards and stop fucking around.
DRAFT LINEMEN
Oh my fucking God man
"Mmm Ricard at TE instead of Andrews, I wonder what we will do..."
So. Fucking. Predictable.
We csnt get a yard with 6 linemen? Spread it out yo.
Hollywood can‚Äôt catch now
Ravens and 1st round WRs
Hollywood...
Soulja spotting!!!
Just attempt to chuck it down the field one time please!! Even if its incomplete you gotta take a fucking shot
At least Andrews knows how to be a soulja
Old faithful
Why the fuck are we going to let the best RB on the team just ride the bench
Ingram and Hollywood need to be off the field.
That run on first down
lol hollywood
Yeah just throw it to Dez at this point
IN MANDREWS WE TRUST
JFC play Dobbins the whole game...
Stop giving the ball to Ingram you fat fuck
"I like using the extra OL, especially if teams are lining up light and fast against us.  Fuckin run em over."
"When you give the ball to Dobb, good things tends to happen"
If we can‚Äôt get movement on the line with 6 lineman than spread out and let it go
Hollywood is a Fucking bum.
Dobbins is so much better than Ingram this year
Just use dobbins and Gus!
Andrews‚Äô blocking has been #nice
A flag against our opponent? Has Hell frozen over?
A penalty.. that‚Äôs good for us? ü•∫üëâüèªüëàüèª
Dobbins should clearly at least be playing more than Ingram maybe even Gus
"I hate saying this because he's an amazing teammate, but we need to see Ingram less. He's still not 100%, idk if it's age or a nagging injury, but Gus and Dobbins are so much more dynamic right now"
Dammit
Disgusted
Well that was unfortunate
almost
Defense holds them to 3 on the next drive.
Can‚Äôt let them go up 11. Gotta hold to a FG
Bench dj fluke bro fuck
"Offensive Efficiency and finishing in the red zone is the key to beating the Titans, just like it was last year."
Great play justice
Fuck that bitch up omg!
Henry fucking movingly grown as fatties lol
God damn Henry is scary..
Come'on wink dial it up.
7 YPC type beat
nice play 40
Forced to listen to the game on the radio.  Nice to hear Gerry
Has the defense ever been this inconsistent when Ray and Ed were here or was it consistent?
#BowserPower
Needed that big time
"Sorry Ryan, your receiver is in another castle"
"That a way, D!  Way to unload on tannehill!"
Hump didnt even attempt to intercept that.....
PATRICK QUEEN IN THE CLUTCH
Good shit Defense
FUCK YEAHHHH!
Beautiful LB play right there
"Cmon offense, take advantage"
Lightning McQueen!
Kachow
"Great design right there, even better execution. LETTTSSS GOOOOO"
The guys name is freaking bowser!üò≥üò≥
Where are the Queen haters at now???
Bowsers got some wheels
Bigtime fucking play let‚Äôs go
"I love Mark but, JK and Gus are the ones"
Okay actually great read by Lamar! He‚Äôs been keeping those way too often this year
"Let's put it to rest: Queen is a solid player with tons of potential, and also has plenty to improve upon.  He's a rookie playing LB, tobbe expected"
Dobbins looking slick
"Enough of Ingram, give Jk the ball"
"Marquise has got to go. Bitching about targets and he never fights for balls, never gets open, and drops easy passes. All mouth and no skill."
O line is on a short leash. Do your job or you‚Äôre out. Love it
"Dobbins is mad he keeps getting taken out, and he has more than a right to be"
"&#x200B;

Are we really going to settle for a Field Goal again?  üòí"
Dobbins is the future.
Romo exposed
Why is Ingram seeing the field if Jk is running like this?
Wtf
More JK & Edwards. Less Ingram.
Dude JK is a beast
Dobbins been that dude
Feed dobbins
Stop wasting these downs man this is so dumb
Feed Dobby more!
"Dobbins is amazing, that vision + agility is crazy"
Lol good thing drafted him
Dobbins RB1 from now on.
dobbins a baller
Dobbins is good.
Dobbins is special
Fluker has got to be expendable at this pint. This guy can't hold water anywhere on the line
This is the best we got?
Wtf was that
Wtf was that
Another FG HAHAHAHA
"Dear Baltimore, please win this game. 

Love, Indy."
C'mon man. This is just ridiculous
Man if we get stuffed in the red zone again...
Where is dez?
Beating ourselves again
I love Ingram's fire and personality but this team is objectively better with Gus & JK
Don‚Äôt
Back to back bad play calls
Dobbins been running for 10 yards a carry better pull him when we are 1st and goal.
So glad we took JK out to complete waste that down. FUCK OFF ROMAN
Embarrassing
When Simmons isn't spitting in people's faces he's twisting ankles. Scumbag
Why the fuck do we have 3 players on the right sideline of the endzone lmao
"Why do shoot ourselves in the foot every drive, stop the cute shit"
Fucking need 7. Please for the love of god
How does Greg Roman let this shit happen every fucking week and keep his job?
WHAT A DUMB PLAY
god our o line is trash
"Come on, man."
Dear lord that's pathetic
Fucking waste.
What a joke
This is so fucking frustrating
FUCK. THIS.
Disaster.
RUN ____ ______
lol we suck
"We need serious help at O line, and Greg Roman's playcalling has been... I'll say ""not impressive"" to me this year."
Jesus fuck
what does Lamar's contract look like?
Awful. Awful. Awful
"Defense got us in position, offense moved the ball 1 yard. New identity looks great"
We can‚Äôt even execute a run properly
Those first 2 plays killed us
Opdivo sounds good except for the 437 side effects
Special teams showing up today.
Big boy no little boy
Let's go HILL
Justice! Nice!
Are special teams is an absolute unit.  Designed short kicks off and great gunning down field to hold them on the 20 every time
This team is done until the coaches leave
Our defense is our only hope this season.
good stout run defense
"Great job, D!  Cmon, O.  Pull your head out, Roman"
Let's go O
What active raven would be the best MMA fighter assuming they trained that growing up instead of football
So with Dez elevated I'm pretty sure we gotta sign him to active roster now? Can we confirm that
Defense stepping up big time offense needs to follow suit
Now it's time for Lamar to lock in.
FEED JK
Dobbins playing with fire
Woah lamar just went under center
"Two good runs by Dobbins, time to put Ingram back in"
Let JK cook
Only let Dobbins run
 I FUCKING LOVE DOBBINS START THIS MF
JK üò§
Give JK the fucking ball
Feed JK
It's the Dobbin show!
YES DOBBINS AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN
Who the fuck is Holden?
Strap a rocket to Dobbins plz
Dobbins is a fucking beast. Roman better keep him in.
Plz for the love of god let dobbins run stop taking him out
Dobbins gonna be a choncccy boi cuz all he does is eats.
No ingram fuck
That was a good throw just good coverage
I don't expect anything with deep shots.
#DEZ AGAIN
Had too much air on it
Someone give Dobbins an article of clothing so he can be a free elf
Ball got to get out quicker LJ
Bad throw by lamar
Lamar really struggling with deep ball
Will Falsestarten
He has to slow down so much.
Holden wtf
"Again, Dez was open and in position to at least get a 1st down."
need more timing pass plays.  Lamar seems to be better at those throws.
WHO THE FUCK IS HOLDEN?
Good throw
We didn't have enough field space to get that. If we were a bit further back that could've been a td
Dez was open again!
THERE WE GO
Not Soulja‚Äôs fault there Lamar needs to stop hesitating
DUDE FUCK BROWN FOR BEING A BITCH DEZ WAS WIDE OPEN AGAIN!
Hollywood is too short
Thank god
Brown saving the effort for....?
There's our soulja again
Hollywood got to come back and try compete for that. Why can‚Äôt he beat anyone
"3 receivers next to eachother
Very poor pass concept."
Bruh wow
If Hollywood attacks that ball it‚Äôs a TD instead he tried to let it come to him
Why was Snead right next to Andrews?! What shit planning by Roman
"Wow, a taller receiver catches a ball in traffic. Who would've thought?"
Damn Lamar throws that sooner that‚Äôs a TD
Hell of a throw hell of a defensive play
lamar with no fucking touch or accuracy on his deep passes again
That was va crazy catch
Dobbins is ass pounding them
Lmao at the people shitting on Hollywood for not catching an under thrown pass
TD boyss
Go go go
Fuck it just chuck it to Andrew's and DEZ the entire game EZ win
Ricard might be short but Idk
Touchdown Ravens!!!!
Fuck yeah Ricard
He makes those throws and it‚Äôs just so sweet let the kid do his thing and stop being cute you feckless fuck Roman
4 handoffs to dobbins... let see it
Hell yea Pat!
Let‚Äôs fucking go!!!!!!!!
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
He was down
Ah he‚Äôs down
ugh god dammit I thought we had that
Lol phrasing Tony phrasing
"THERE YOU GO GUYS, FINALLY"
his knee is down at like the one
He‚Äôs down guys sorry
I called this play needed to happen more. My buddy said it wouldn't. He can suck on it.
He was down at the 1 sadly.
Down at the 1
Give it to dobby
GOING FOR TWO
Oh goddammit
Finally some creativity.
Bro the ref xD
Throw to Dez
This is 4 down territory anyway
"Dobbins, fuck yes"
ALL DAY MFUCKING JK
There you go JK
<3 JK
Defense please keep up the good work
That's Ravens football.
I guess I know which jersey im getting next
Come on boys
"You love to see it. You did it Greg, good job"
Ayyy fuck da titans
Dobbins is a goddamn beast!
Did they overturn it????
Wanted Ricard to get that carry so bad but good shit regardless!
Let‚Äôs Review the Review
Has Luke Willson always had long hair? I don't remember seeing that when he was on the Seahawks
How do we feel about going for 2?
What play to we call for the 2 point?
JK MUTHAFUCKING DOBBINS!!!
IT‚ÄôS DOBBINS SZN MY DUDES
Good play call. Roman really wants to keep his job
No Robby the Dobby
Did Harbs says tell GRo it's Dobbins time? Or do we think he came up with that on his own?
Dobbins should be getting OROY hype.
I love me some JK.
FEED DOBBINS
DOBBINS OCTOPUS LETS GO
Loving Dobbins today.
We‚Äôre home
D O B B I N S coming out party
Step up D! Dobbins did his part.
JK in his name stands for MVP! You cant tell me any different!!
Aight defense let's stop them here cause they get the ball back after the half.
Time for the D to step up again. Let‚Äôs start putting them behind then run away all their comeback time
Lmao we keep blowing up this kick returner
LAMAR tha big WODIE and JK tha COYOTE üòàüî• üíØ
and they want to take him out the game...
Lets go d get us the ball back
Lol juke
JK Dobbins is my new father
"Jesus, get Ferguson a fucking map"
Holy shit what an embarrassment by Ferguson on that play LMAO
Aaaaaaand here we go again
come on ffs don't let fucking guy rip off a run
Lamar Tannehill
Some say that Ferguson is still chasing Henry
This man Chris Board makes doing absolutely nothing all game look so hard.
That misdirect was painfully effective
Lightning McDobbins in the race
OUCH
Wonder if Queen plays with his helmet loose? I know that‚Äôs how I always liked to wear my helmet even though I knew it was dangerous it was comfortable that way.
I'm really glad the NFL doesn't watch people to watch their games without having to jump through hoops and give up credit card information.
These play actions are going to hurt us real soon
"Horrible throw, dude was completely open"
Tannehill missed that play but why was that wideout so open....
A stop would be huge here
Can we start running man when they have 2 routes downfield we can double up and play better defense
Lucky break there.
Patrick Queen ‚ÄúFuck‚Äù
Is it time to end the RB by committee and just name Dobbins the starter?
Good shit good pressure
Let's fucking go!!!
Didnt they just pay Tannehil a bunch?
Defense playing well
Ravens been bailed out twice by bad throws.
"The longest rush of the game didn't come from Henry, Lamar, dobbins, the bus, or Ingram. It came from Tannehill... After he juked a defender...

I'll let you read that again."
D STEPPING TF UP
Um I think marlon was out of position there
Wow
Come on man
Bro Levine you‚Äôre a DB come on
Well...
Could have called us for NZI on that one. lucky
\*sigh
Bad.
Damn so close to a pick
Fuck
That's why Levine doesn't play defense
Get a sack here for me
I thought it was funny that they were walking off in no man's land. Should have knew better
Stopppp
So so costly
We will dk anything to let them score won't we
That‚Äôs literally a hit on his stomach wtf?
Fucking bullshit. That's a garbage call. I get it's the rules but it's pussy as fuck to call that roughing the passer.
"Bbbbbut tannehil is really good and he would be insane without a good run game dude, for real he‚Äôs a great QB we could win throwing the ball if we had to but we just don‚Äôt have to"
That is a crap call.  Thigh level.
Where can you hit a QB???
That‚Äôs so Ravens
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST
This feels like the Steelers game. We're really trying hard to give it away.
Why is nobody ever there on these stupid little screen plays. Linebacker on the flats????
Anyone else watching this game on mute?
I‚Äôm happy we‚Äôre being aggressive with the TOs here
Boom
"Wow, Wolfe hit Henry pretty good there"
I can‚Äôt remember more extended drives by our opponents. Maybe 2014?
A Special Teams coordinator needs to recognize these things. That‚Äôs literally like their only job.
Okay. Let's see if Lamar can push it down the field without an INT if we get the ball back.
Huge! Get this stop and we have time for a drive
Can‚Äôt believe no one tried to recover the ball
Incomplete pass???
Big fucking stop by the squad.
Harbaugh should tell the refs they look nice in two weeks. Maybe that‚Äôll change their attitude towards us. It won‚Äôt matter if he does it or not next week...üôÑ
No roughing the kicker call there? We got off lucky
"Ngakoue, I heard that name like 3 weeks ago in the trade window"
Yannic is a beast
Damn I wanna see Yannick get a sack badly every time he‚Äôs literally right there
This feels good
Let‚Äôs drive and get that 3 points back
Uh oh
Too bad the masters wasnt this week so we would be spared nantz drivel
Who gets ball at half
That guy is writhing in pain.
poor dude
Our passing game has been non existent again
Omg that looked bad
God damn ben
I can‚Äôt stop cringing at the slowmo of that guy‚Äôs arm going backwards
Both QBs have terrible stat lines right now
Lmao Baker
"This is my first time watching the James Harrison commercial from Fanduel, not gonna lie it got a laugh out of me"
Tennessee has another 14 points in them at least. Need a strong showing from the offense this half
I‚Äôm glad to see some noticeable pressure from the d line itself. It almost seemed nonexistent lately.
Tracy looks beat up.
Low-key nervous Henry going to go off.
No I‚Äôm not gonna talk shit anymore. This is the team we have and I‚Äôm gonna root for them no matter what. I‚Äôm gonna accept the mistakes and weaknesses and cheer for the success. Let‚Äôs go boys it‚Äôs time for some fucking football!
Judon rocked this dude
[deleted]
Let's go
Good shit defense
Nice opening drive stop!
That's how we come out of half! Here we go
Why do teams always run screens over us? Like it isn‚Äôt even always effective. Look at Washington and Indianapolis games for example
Great job D.  Let‚Äôs go O
Ayeeee
I agree with romo they are completely disrespecting dez
That‚Äôs cool for Dez. Guys don‚Äôt make comebacks with that big a lay-off
Look at this dude
"Hit him right in the head, no call? Hes a defensless receiver there"
Powned haha
Why is Orlando's nickname not Apollo or Ares???
Dobbins all day!
Titians are loosing composure.
JK TAKE OVER
Huehuehuehue
Oh shit defense
he fucking launched that thing
Dammn getting some calls today.   Ok ok
Both hands on the helmet lmao cmon
That penalty looking like a prom picture pose
A very slow tackle
"Romo just stop. 

Dobby? Really?"
About fucking time we got flags
New York called down during half time and said the fix is too obvious even it out
Gimme those holding calllllsssss
Unrelated but did anyone see Orlando wearing the fucking Uggs earlier today
Romo needs to fuck off
Who the fuck is 82
Feels nice to get some free yards.
The Titans forget we won our first SB in part thanks to them LOL
Need 7 here
Booya
They‚Äôre playing 10-12yds off of Dez! Throw it to him. Quick slant
King is fucking trash. He can‚Äôt cover Andrews so he tackles him. Keep him in there!!!
Let‚Äôs fucking go!
LET‚ÄôS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOO
LETS GO
THANK YOU!!!!
What a fucking dot
Floated that ball in. I was nervous as hell lmao
Boom
Lets gooooooo
Big balls hahahaha MANDREWS!!!
Ayeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
Where the fuck would we be right now without Mark Andrews.
Absolute dime!
11-point lead let‚Äôs fucking go!!! 2 score game!
Wooooo
I said earlier this week. To beat this team we have to hit them over the top. Mix that with some great runs and the ravens get back on track!
"Throw him open, baby"
"Wow, what a throw and play. Need more of that this season!!!"
FUCK YEQH
Truss
Need us to keep building on this week üôèüèª
"Burrow down, Burrow down."
Thats my qb
Fumble
HOLY FUCK DESHON
Get him some milk
JOKER SZn
"Wink Martindale has done an excellent job at adjusting to all the injuries, all the bullshit the defense went through, seriously sign this guy to be the highest paid DC in the league. He deserves it"
My god that man has a family
"Hopefully he's okay :/ we hate the guy, but I'd hate to see him injured even more"
omg dude.
"Fuck that, that's a fumble.  What a hit!"
Congrats to AJ Brown for actually catching a pass
Fuuuuuuuck
Wtf was our defense there!?
cmon man
Shit
Goddamnit
lest keep rushing 4/5 until it doesnt work
Pulled a Greg roman!!!
LMAO üòÇ
Lol awkward times
Oof that snap
RUN IT AGAIN
"Wide. Open. We need to draft linemen for both sides, and corners. Unfortunately we have to rely on free agents for wrs"
The shoe is on the other foot lol
lmao sucks to suck
Jajajajjjajjajja
LMFAO
Hahahaha WTF was that
Douglas = Skura
Oof
"that Henry hit was savage and exactly what we needed 

hope he's ok tho"
that would‚Äôve been ideal back in fucking january
lol
Hahahhaha
"Great job, D!!!"
Let's keep growing this lead
GET THAT SCORE GUYS. LET'S GO
Him and brown just can't connect
Does marquise even have a catch today?
Feed dobbins
I think we need to trade Hollywood
Lamar getting to the 4th read nice
Proche Szn
Procheeeeeeee
YES USE PROCHE GOOD JOB
"Nooo, Burrow"
"DUVVVVVV

Edit: PROCHEEEE"
THROW IT UP
James is a Pro-che
Fuck dean pees
Feed Dez!
Brown needs to catch these
Hollywood about to throw a fit like his cousin
Dez would have caught that
Yes get our rookie WRs involved more please
Run the same play with dez a THIRD time
"Damn, there‚Äôs guys on Tennessee that look like they don‚Äôt want to play anymore... in their careers, let alone this game."
Imagine that you get receivers who arent afraid of contact and good shit happens
X
He got it anyway
I think he got it
Clearly a first down
God fucking dammit
üôÑ
The Titans need to be reminded all this trash talk brought them within 1 yard of the Super Bowl win.... never works out in the end
Yikes
Oh boy here we go
Quack quack
Pees PTSD
Jesus
Fuck man
UGH
BRUH
But why.
Solid toss
God damn it
I wish lamar used his legs on that one..
Dude in this commercial with the orange beanie looks like Trevor Wallace‚Äôs parody of Soundcloud rappers
We need to take shots it clears out the box to all the naysayers in this thread
Oof
WWHHHHYYYYYYY
That end of the first half not going for 3 really sucks now
Brainless shit. Just run the fucking ball. Jesus christ
"Went away from the run, Duv wasn't even open."
Fuck Malcolm Butler
"Turning it over with the lead, same shit that cost us against Pittsburgh we need to stop outthinking ourselves"
Feelsbadman
Come on defense. Bail us out üôèüèª
On FIRST down
Can someone please tell Roman the phrase ‚ÄúIf it aint broke dont fix it‚Äù. He always changed his playcalling mid game for no fucking reason.
That was a duck and Duv didn't help either. Bad effort all around
Lamar taketh. Lamar giveth away.
We need to hold them. This is an extremely important drive. If we force a punt and take it into 4Q we can control clock and play for FGs.
"overslept, how's the game is look"
Really worried about this drive. It's the most important in this game. We **have to hold them**. They can't get any poits here
I think they got the wrong Michael Thomas
Pain.
Here we go
Fucking come on
Is that a joker or a fuckin dog out there?
Pain.
Pain.
Defense getting tired I feel bad for Wink sometimes
looking like we're going for the tie score rn
"damn, man."
Couple dudes just out there runnin around
queen and harrison w/ b2b poor fits
is Derek Wolfe OKAY
We jinxed ourselves saying Henry hasn‚Äôt gotten free lol
Do we have a sack today?
We desperately need a TD
Run the ball
Run down that clock JK!!
USE THE DOBBY
Dumb
Lamar please don‚Äôt twist your legs like that. Thanks
Cmon O.  Gotta grind it out
Big boy
Well at least that run went forward lol
"I‚Äôm getting a shower, see y‚Äôall on the other side"
Fucking ridiculous like Jesus fucking christ
GODDAMN
Smh bro really
Horrible
What in the fuck
Gross
Meltdown
Fucking refs
Fuck me man
Well fuck us I guess. What a terrible sequence
"Wow, just a hair overthrown"
No fucking way. I don‚Äôt believe it.
Ughhhh
Well...
Wtf man
Fuuuuuuuuck so close. Any chance that was meant for Willson?
"Well, 90 yards for paydirt. HOLD, DEFENSE!!"
lol this is insane bro come on
Could cost us big time.
Fuck me man.
"Well, the O isputting it on the D.  Cmon D!"
How the fuck is he that open
That same fucking play.
I‚Äôm sweating
Defense. PLEASE. step up here far out
"This is what the Titans do to you late in a one score game.  Find a way, D"
Marcus getting caught looking at the qb too much
WHAT WAS THAT PLAY
Lol our tackling is pathetic
Jesus come on
We needed to fucking tackle
Secondary looks toast
Can someone explain why are coverage is garbage today?
Holy fuck those are bad tackling angles
It‚Äôs actually depressing
This is bs
WTF WAS THAT
üò°
"How does board end up on Browns, wtf Wink"
is this defense fucking serious?
Three stooges
DAFUQ is this bullshit
I still have faith
Steelers part 2
"Whole team needs to prove it, now would be a great time."
I don‚Äôt trust our offence to go down and score
So lucky for us
"Wow, these corners couldn't guard high schoolers..."
Was anyone covering Aj brown on the outside?
Don't care what happens on this drive if we lose the offense continues to be the problem
Judon sighting
here comes the classic ravens experience
I'm dreaming of fruitpunch right now
They move the ball so easily
This is beyond funny
WOW
Oh god no
Absolute garbage effort there wtf
What the hell is that tackling
LOOOOOOL
Haha who didn't see that coming
Wow
#FUCK THIS LILY ASS DEFENSE HOLY SHIT
Fire those guys for those whiffs. Absolute embarrassment.
Hahahah I fucking hate this team
Soft ass defense
Pathetic
We‚Äôre fucking garbage in the clutch
Romo really hates this team
Bad. Bad. Bad.
"What. The. Fuck.

Fuck these coaches."
Lmfaooooo I can‚Äôt believe this shit
Guess the D wearing their She-ra panties today........bunch of sackless pussies
That's what a real receiver looks like
"Sometimes the fruit punch helps you, and sometimes it bites you."
Fuck me
Wow. Fucking weak.
Are you fucking kidding me?
No fucking way
Whelp. It's all on Lamar now.
God bless judon
lmfao
Gg
Welp.
I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs a disgrace
Scoring 21 against this terrible defense is still abysmal. Overall game is on the offense
smfh.
LMFAOOOO
Four shitass tackles...unreal.
Pathetic. What a swing from last year to this team.
Can‚Äôt let him score from that
Truzzzz
Queen pulled an earl thomas there
You‚Äôve gotta be kidding me
Pathetic
Time to KDA
Can you even call those tackle attempts?
No heart
Lmao wtf
Oh. My. Fucking. God.
Trashhhg
Ugh
Piss off üôÑ
I don't know if it's the no off-season or what but our tackling and our angles to ball carriers have been suspect on a lot of plays this year.
Of course...just when I thought it might be a good day
Game
This is embarrassing.
Of course.....
Watch the offense punt two times like with Patriots and Steelers
Fucking kill me
What the fuck happened
The only thing we needed to do was hold them.  We have up the lead and we won't be able to answer. This is pitiful
Huge moment for Lamar
How many leads are we going to blow because of stupid ass decisions. Damn
Did someone poke lamar?
My heart is pounding yall
At the least we‚Äôre going to OT.
"I dont give up hope that easily. We are ravens mother tucker! Get out of here with yall weak ass ""seasons over shit"" clocks still running we got this"
Oh shhhhhhhhit
Ugh
Okay holy fuck
How does GRO fuck this one up?
Come on with these dumb fucking penalties. Seriously
good blocks by wr/dobb
THESE PENALTIES!!!
Mekari snapped it early there.
"Guys, We drafted Hollywood over the man that just dragged the entire defense into the endzone"
KEEP TALKING SHIT YOU NAYSAYERS ITS WORKING
Tony ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is Dez‚Äôs fault‚Äù Romo
Killed the momentum.
things heatin up!!!
Why can‚Äôt we do hurry up more often
OKAY SNEAD
No way let the 10 seconds run off
Good drive
mekari's been solid today though
INHALES SCREEAAAAMSSS INTERNALLY
DONT THROW!!!
Dobbins has the touchdown there.
smh mekari
"Great drive so far, keep it going."
Tuck plz
Fuck if he could've got it to Snead I think he had him but very little separation.
Can we trade for king? He's what we sorely need on defense
My heart rate is through the roof.
Our Centers have been trash this season
Dez was in single coverage and db was not close.  Lamar never looked his way
Still pissed this went to OT. We got dobbins and we can't push for a 3rd and one?? We had two timeouts..
"get the ball first in OT, can‚Äôt have that tackling again"
WE NEED THE BALL
Unless they including the browns there is no way this is the 25th meeting
This game man
We gotta get the ball first
Please. Just get the ball in OT. PLEASE
WE GOT THE BALL
The Coin lets go!
We got ball SCORE A TD AND END IT PLEASE
Thank God.
Let‚Äôs go
S T R E S S
LETS WIN THIS
PLEASE. GO WIN THIS. LET'S GO
MY EMOTIONS!
"WE

WANT

THE

BALL"
"Nice, we needed the ball first the way our defense is getting worked"
THIS is where LJ tests his mettle
We needed the ball. Thank god.
Run the fucking ball.
\# WHY DOESNT THIS WORK FOR ME
THROW UP THAT FUCKING X DEZ LETS FUCKING SEE IT!
Game winning drive let‚Äôs go!!!
TRUZZzz BOYS
First play dez TD
"Just fucking march this shit straight down the field and cover and pick up the W, lets FUCKING GO!"
Do we trust to offense to go down and score a TD or do we put the defense out there and trust them to get a stop and let justin Tucker win the game
Well st least DC fans get it on tv now
I'm feeling the energy
"Lamar needs to put this game on the Offense and win this, play like a real leader"
Here we fucking go man
Fucking
"first sack, wack"
and now this
Big brain move
"Look, I'm sorry. But Roman should be chewed out for our last two plays in regulation alone. We have exactly ZERO money plays that can pick up, like, 5 yards, when we have the reigning MVP who is super fucking dynamic?"
Our OL has been pretty good so far expect for that play
ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Run the ball man fuck
"they finally run when it's 3 and 17.

dumb."
Pathetic
Fucking ball game
gg
Gg guys
That was bad
"gg, im gonna go sulk now"
Fucking pathetic
Marlo plz
Lol
Fire Roman
anyone got a stream link?
not looking good
"Greg Roman back to him old self I see, fucking crook"
"what a pussy ass call, that was never going to work"
We need a Fruit punch here
Good punt
Pray for a turnover
Fuck my life
Goddammit
Need to summon the turnover gods
Go after him Pernell! Don‚Äôt just shadow him
Getting stuffed like that by a scrub defense that runs their mouths is painful.
Secondary is non existent
tackle please
Judson just watching
FUCKING COME ON.
Turnover or game
OMG
we're not getting far in the playoffs with this offensive line. It was already a problem but the Stanley and Phillips injuries sunk us.
"Wide, fucking, open."
"Honestly blame of the game today is everyone but Dobbins, everyone has had at least one moment they could have done more and changed this outcome"
STOP BLITZING HOLY SHIT
Gotskowski‚Äôs gotta choke here
Let's go defense üôèüèøüôèüèø
Gameover
our offense fucking blows.
Humphrey also having his worst game of the season now.
Gg boys. See y‚Äôall next week
Pathetic
HOW MANY OUT ROUTES ARE YOU GONNA GIVE THEM. HOLY SHIT
 Thats likely the game
Game.
"Thought we had good corners, WTH"
How has our secondary looked good at times this season? This is insanity
How are they still leaving them so open.
Playing so fucking far off. Team is a joke.
FUCK
OMG
Lol
Lol.
Fuck this team to pieces
Fucking hell.
Lol
Fuck
"holy cow, what a way to collapse"
And that's game
Cool.
Game over
Unbelieveable
Fitting
I really  hate overtime
How much money is invested in this defense?
[deleted]
God I hope this team doesn't enter no mans land. 2013-2017 were fucking brutal (save for the 2014 season).
"I wish the ravens knew what it meant to be clutch. We lose these games 9 out of 10 times, it‚Äôs maddening to not be the clutch team. Been that way for a while, probably since 2014. SMH"
"J.k. all day long. 
Number not called on any
Critical plays. Lose."
Behind the Browns in the division now lmao
fire harb
Thats blatant fucking Pi wtf
"This game is still not the end of the world. My god, we‚Äôre still so spoiled here."
All good boys. We can drop these next two. Just need a little help. LETS GO RAVENS. Good game.
[removed]
"Meanwhile, Golden Joe in Cincinnati just got pulled out on the cart with a knee injury"
"Lamar ends a solid drive with a deep INT

*checks off the box*"
"This whole fanbase needs to demand real change. Enough of these shit players and coordinators.

This shit is a fucking disgrace to our franchise."
Marcus Peters is looking like a bad extension
Patrick Queen has regressed horribly..hopefully it's just the rookie wall or something
Why is Lamar so scared everytime he throws the ball. Stop hesitating just fucking throw it
Honestly I‚Äôd rather lose to the Steelers than the titans fuck them
"I‚Äôm by no means a pro, but I will personally give Humphrey and Peters tackling lessons"
Our receivers are a fucking joke.  Duvernay was 100% at fault for that INT.   I haven't seen that bad of an effort playing the ball since Raheem fucking Moore in 2012.
"Lamar has all day to throw and he chucks it to a well covered Duvernay. Doesn't matter if DD ran a bad route or the playcall was shit, it was on Lamar. This sub needs to realize a lot of our passing game issues fall on him."
The offense is pure cancer and Lamar is seeing ghosts now
"Man I like seeing them lose like this must be so damaging to their spirit. If your gonna have this much talent and just stink up the place all year I‚Äôm glad thier not getting bailed out by bullshit wins. I‚Äôm glad they talked shit and got their ass beat twice in their home building by an inferior team. I want them humiliated humbled and ultimately, gone."
Where are the Patrick queen apologists now? I want to hear a actual excuse besides ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a rookie‚Äù.
"Would've liked a lob to Dez but I suppose I understand not wanting to chance a pick. But damn if you got him out there to do that, take a chance."
Put a fork in us. Seasons over. We never recovered to the collapse vs Pitt and are now toasti
"Time for some coaching changes. Even harbs, he's obviously lost the room"
The Lamar INT's are getting old
"What in world makes the coaches confident they can pull out an OT win? 

No matter the outcome this game is a loss in my book. Disappointing all around."
This fan base every loss ‚Äúwe can come bAaacckkkk bIg truSss‚Äù
"You can call that holding, but that was not pass interference"
Astros cheated
LMAOOOOOO
"Were just going to let them intimidate us and we cower, sounds about right"
This is why the offense has to score TDs. Because soon Henry gonna start getting 10 yards a carry. If we‚Äôre down the whole game all they gotta do is the same shit in the playoff game
I just don‚Äôt see the defense making enough stops
When we everybody realize that Harrison is a better mlb than queen
how come i can only comment once every 10 mins? thats no fun
We're going to lose this game because we lost all momentum with that penalty.
Both teams have equally been shitty on Offense.
Roman is a clown. Your an OC with the BEST KICKER IN THE LEAGUE. Your up 4 points not 10 just go for it
Oh Lamar that was fucking awful.
"> can someone tell Roman to keep running it?

> me: ""Roman: deep passing it is""

CALLED IT. Jfc Roman is such a predictable moron"
Take this defense out back and fucking shoot them. That's embarrassing.
"Outside of turnovers, we have the worst defense in the league. Change my mind."
\*sigh this team always finds a way to lose
Yeah that's season probably
I‚Äôm done on this team.
"Defense is atrocious, our only good receiver is Andrews, we are missing the best LT in the league, and you are all putting the game on Lamar. Fuck you."
WIN THE TOSS
Here come the bullshit OT rules.
Unbelievable
lol
Ball game
Absolutely ZERO faith in Lamar and Roman. We've lost this one because of those two. I don't want to hear Lamar post-game saying he needs to be better because its getting old now.
"GG guys, it's the same thing every week with this team. Unfortunately, the reality is that even if we make the playoffs, it will be another one and done"
Thats game. Put the thread up. D better be blamed and no one else.
Fucking blow the team up
Once again all week long it will be ‚Äúwhat happened to Lamar?‚Äù On every sports show
I remember when Flacco was drafted.. I remember the years before that (I was a kid but I remember) but I swear to god if one of you MFs bring up Kyle Boller like this team isn‚Äôt bitchmade üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
This sub acting like queen should win DROY because he made a hit on the QB after being unblocked
No ones gonna say it but lamars had another bad game.
"I'm watching illegal streams (European Raven subspecies decided to cancel the mf $200 GamePass subscription, fuck NFL) and noticed that these analysts have the best work in the world. They look up weekly/seasonal stats and put sentences together according to them. Like ""TJ Watt is something! He hit QBs 28 times this year"". And that's it. That's their job, that's what they get their paycheck for. wtf"
"When do the Steelers and Browns play a competent team besides us, jeeze"
Guys... Derrick Henry scares the shit out of me....
Dez gets 3 TDs today!!
wait i missed something. How were the titans trying to disrespect?
I forgot every time we do something a fuck shit o-lineman needs to get a flag
Yeah! Ref ball! my favorite
Fucking Patrick queens dumbass better show tf up today.
Looked like good coverage to me.
Why do we suck such ass on 3rd and long everygame
"my stream is so far behind, like a solid play behind"
"Man, gonna be a long day at this rate"
We come out looking exactly the same as last week lmfao
Fort blew his coverage
What a joke.
No fight no passion this team just lays down and dies
Lmao we‚Äôre in trouble
"At this point, they might as well let me try out for the defense"
"This defense had Suggs, Lewis, and Reed (among others). And now we're stuck with a bunch of shitheads outside a few players."
yikes
"Their scripted plays looked good, let's see how they do as the game progresses. Our offense needs to score a lot today it looks like."
"Well, I had a bad feeling about this game, we‚Äôll have to see how it goes."
"This analysis of ""put more DBs to stop baltimore"" is so lazy. That would not work if our OL would be healthy...."
lol love how the corner gets stiff armed in the chest by Duv but doesn't fail to collect high fives from all his teammates
Here y'all go with the dickeating shit again. He's our player
i think gus edwards smashed harbaugh's wife...dude needs to get way more touches
Too much air
I‚Äôm liking the playcalling from Roman here. He‚Äôs mixing up a lot of things. Only issue is execution and lack of talent imo
Orlando brown Jr has to be the most unathletic looking lineman in the league
This defense is so fucking weak
This game's gonna get ugly soon if things dont change.
So is Harrison are staring Lb now
"Harrison > Queen so far, but Queen is a good blitzer!"
Kil1 Greg Roman
legit believe roman is trying his hardest to lose every game
People blaming Roman when that's two tds taken off because Lamar missed an open receiver.
Adam gase could do better
"This is going to sound like a weird critique, but I'd like to see Lamar work on his scrambling. It feels like whenever he breaks out of the pocket, he does the same thing: gradually close in on the line of scrimmage, try and bait the defense into playing run, then throw.

If you want to pass first second and third, watch what mobile athletic guys who pass first second and third like Wilson and Watson do. Change direction, run around, buy your receivers as much time as possible. Don't make a beeline for the line of scrimmage, draw it out, force them to chase you."
"Beyond greg roman being a turd, i must say that lamar isn't playing well either."
"Don't worry r/ravens, I got you on this next possession. *Lamar misses an open wide receiver*, IT'S ALL ROMAN'S FAULT!!!"

Soulja strikes again
SOULJA!!!!!!
Catch it Soulja
"Late throw, but Brown needs to make a play on that ball."
"Damn Tits you stopped us 

JK LOL"
"Do we NEED to review everything? These are pretty clear could you at least speed it up??

Oh right... Money"
Big yikes on powers
We have speedsters but cant have a deep route there.
Offensive momentum is all but gone now.. going to be over an hour since the last time they had the ball
Getting it to 21-10 here would be HUGE. We usually play way better when comfortably up
Love the Elliott hits but at some point he's gonna be hurt (again)
Peters fucking sucks on those man. Dude just never plays outside and overtop routes well
Dez making 5 out of nothing. What year is it?!
Wtf? That was a really bad throw
Wow. That was stupid
I want more Duvernay targets but not like that Lamar...
RUN THE FUCKING BALL AND MILK THE CLOCK WTF
This is why I get so nervous every time Lamar throws the ball.
"I guess this thread is so toxic that oeopke woukd automatically think i said fuck joe burrow, its was ‚Äúfuuuuck‚Äù that he was injured"
Whens the last time one of our receivers dived for a ball?
Queen can‚Äôt run fit to save his life
Watch the fake ..
Being a pussy doesn't win football games. Thank God Vrabel has his tail between his legs.
"Fuck the refs, he was 3 yards past the fucking line"
Come on defence
Ravens. We just can‚Äôt play 4 quarters.
"Come on guys, your embarrassing me üò£"
Another game the D is hung out to dry and made to look like shit in the 4th. Story of the season
We got lucky not good
Yeaaaaah fuck this game
I FUCKING HATE THIS SHIT WTF IS WRONG WITH YALL
LMAO HOLY FUCK OUR DEFENSE IS SHIT
"So like, no forward progress calls I guess?"
Learn to wrap up. Clark sucks
EMBARRASSING
"Wink has been the most overrated Dc from this team ever, dudes defenses get figured out every 4th Q"
It's funny some think we have a good D
That‚Äôs twice now the Titans have gotten away with delay of game today
Y'all best fucking believe I'm taking names of everyone saying our season is over
we win the toss. do over for the final drive.
"##BELEE

#DAT"
Annnnnd that‚Äôs game
"Pathetic fucking call. Fuck this year dude, our superbowl window is closing by the year"
"Game over, trash."
Fuck this shit. Call me a fairweather fan if you want. We‚Äôre better than this
We‚Äôre playing for field position dumbasses. Fucking low iq idiots
"GREG GO FUCK YOURSELF, A SCREEN ON 3RD AND 17? REALLY????"
Tbh it's likely tucker could have done more there. 80 yd fg ez
"Outstanding play calls, Roman. Wouldn't want you to get Dobbins more touches. No, please... don't do that. Keep throwing to our elite corps of receivers! How's that first round streaker Hollywood doing today? Hey, how's Boykin! Defenses must shiver in fear when they see those two."
FUCKING TACKLE JUDON HE WAS RIGHT THERE
Game over
Harbs is in the Hot for sure now this no excuse
Blame of the game: secondary defense
Its over
AJ Brown would look so good in purple
well that it's
"Bummer loss.. I was expecting worse with Campbell and Williams out however. This is still a playoff team, maybe only by merit of the window being 7 teams now. 

The o-lines inexperience and the lack of a game changing WR will be the biggest thing working against them. 

This game could have EASILY been a W if not for the false starts. Razor thin margins. If these teams meet again in the playoffs the Ravens will win lock it in. 

Oh well on to the next one, see you guys next week for another dose of punishment."
we blow games all the fucking time.. Yet I get down voted to hell for saying Harbaugh has to go
Patrick Queen might be the softest player I‚Äôve ever seen on defense.
I guess you can use the ground to catch the ball
"The flacco days were less toxic than this... chill out guys. We are getting the ball back, it‚Äôs 7-0"
What a dick move by powers
"Can we stop sucking off Romo whenever he gets announced for our games, his ravens commentary is shit"
Fake ass over reacting fans.
This team is going to get blown out. We are absolute fucking trash.
[deleted]
Chill everyone we‚Äôre two possessions into the game. Our guys are playing with plenty of fire. Titans had a great series of playcalling versus what we had schemed. Let Wink adjust and we‚Äôll see
We should be going for it on every single 4th down if our defense is going to allow TDs every drive
"Blame Greg.

Blame Lamar.

That was fucking needless. A downright shitty throw. Just an immature decision and even worse execution. At least UNDERthrow it so the defender can't pick it and has to go through the WR."
That ball didn‚Äôt look caught
Almost unfathomable than an offense can go from league record status to incompetent in the span of a year without any major losses or coordinator changes. It‚Äôs truly impossible to comprehend.
They're gonna drive down and score a TD.
Guarantee we lose. This team has shown no ability to move the ball.
I‚Äôm done w this year
"Picking on Marcus peters. Smart, dude is a for real bum. Everyone loves him because he gets a pick every other game but he gets burned so often."
Can't wait for people to turn this against Lamar. Love it!
And there‚Äôs the weekly 15 yard ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a dumbass player‚Äù penalty
Ball hit ground
"*Greg Roman calls a pass play* 

‚ÄúGoddammit Roman, run the ball!‚Äù

*Greg Roman calls a run play*

‚ÄúGoddammit Roman, so predictable‚Äù"
I knew they would lose when Lamar threw that deep int. Then a mod bans my account. Even mods are laughable here
#If this is a loss there is no excuse for HARBS to not be on the hot seat. You let Roman do the same shit so you are at fault
BiG tRuSs WoOt WoOt
this is it! the test! is lamar a true qb or a gimmick?
We suck again
Boring way to end the drive. All bark and no bite with this O.
Our defense is so fucking soft
I don‚Äôt know about going for two here.
"Welp

Fire Greg Roman"
I‚Äôve been a hardcore Harbaugh apologist forever but I‚Äôm really starting to think it might be time. We‚Äôre so undisciplined I don‚Äôt think changing coordinators will do anything
Told y‚Äôall wink was overatated good coaches expose his shitty blitz reliant defense
Good. Let‚Äôs have a game-winning drive by Lamar.
Here come a couple shitty playcalls and a pick.
Maybe this will end in a tie
At least Houston beat New England! üòÇ

You guys are complaining about team discipline but yet Harbaugh gets no blame? Come on.
Welp that‚Äôs the season. It‚Äôs been fun.
Season over. Fuck 2020
Always stupid ass decisions by coaching and Lamar that fuck us over. Fuck man
We gonna lose.
"This sub is so fucking miserable, think the jets thread is less toxic. So what if we aren‚Äôt blowing everyone out like last year; you‚Äôre gonna lose hope because we aren‚Äôt up 21-3 in the first quarter? This is classic Ravens always in a close game, last year was an anomaly."
Lamar had two open wide receivers and couldn‚Äôt find either. Good drive but we could‚Äôve had the win right there with better QB play
"We have possibly the worst offense in the league, no questions about it."
I don't usually wish ill on anybody but I literally want the defense to chop Henry's legs off and hit him so hard he's seeing starts and can't play. Fuck that fucking asshole.
are there no streams left...links...???
Hahahahaha gg
Who tf is Board and wtf is he doing
C'mon offense we still in it

Lamar's unwillingness to run and us having no WRs isn't the best combo.

Okay that is absolutely unacceptable the booth didn't review that. 40 seconds of time for us burnt
4/11 in 1 half is pathetic
"Brown out, left elbow"
Why'd we do that?
Why?!?!?!
Ugggh here we go
Can't wait to lose the lead
all the offense needs to do is get into fg range.

Would it be crazy to let them score here? We‚Äôre not stopping them and I‚Äôd like to have a few minutes to try and score.

It has been years since we've had a qb who can throw the deep ball consistently. Flacco in 2012? I think that was the last time.

Feel so bad for Burrow. Extremely pissed at the Bengals shitty franchise for completely ignoring their OL
Hate this for him. That franchise is a black hole.
Season ending bad looking?
Oh this poor kid he works so hard for such a crappy franchise
"I feel so bad for him. Getting drafted by that dumpster fire and playing his heart out, just to take a shot to the knee like he did. I hope he recovers fully and plays well 14 games out of the year."
Hope he's back on track next season. Kid looks like he'll be a good competitor in the division for a long time. I really hope the Bengals don't ruin him before he gets a chance.
"Really hope he's able to bounce back. Kid looks like the real deal, he just needs an offensive line to speak of. Looking forward to him rejoining the AFCN's QB roster next season."
"Feel bad for him, good kid."
He got carsoned on his first year. V sad
i hope he gets better :(
What pisses me off about it is it was so obviously going to happen because of Taylor being incompetent. What a shame.

"I just want to say how proud I am of Dez man.

The dude was open on a good amount of plays that weren't to him but should've been.

Seeing that fire from him talking trash to the other team.

Always seeing this dude cheering up our teammates and congratulating them whenever they make a play. Fucking love that and his fire. Congrats on him pushing himself back into the league and I hope to see more of him in the coming weeks. Maybe he's the real ""Soulja"" we need this season."
I‚Äôd much rather see him get the jump balls then Hollywood brown.
My friend is a Dallas fan and told me if he plays as hard as he worked to come back we have ourselves a hidden gem going down the stretch that can really make a push for WR1
Only wide receiver who decided to show up today except for maybe Snead.
One of the rare bright factors today
"I know they‚Äôre bringing him along slowly but I‚Äôd be enthusiastic if I were y‚Äôall. He played a lot but very limited on his routes (he‚Äôs not a great route runner anyway, but doesn‚Äôt need to be in this offense). 

Once Lamar starts hitting him on slants, some drag routes and some sideline passes it‚Äôs going to open the offense up.  If Lamar learns that Dez is open when one on one with a shorter player it‚Äôs going to be deadly.  

I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm saying this because I love my Cowboys, but I hope Dez has a nice homecoming in a few weeks."
"As a cowboys fan I tuned in to see Dez, looked good out there... definitely going to be a factor."
He needs to be targeted more.
Great plays today Dez!
Dez definitely needs more targets and playtime. He is a real one for sure.
I think dez making plays will lead to a bigger role. Here‚Äôs to hoping!
"Cowboys fan here, and he‚Äôs my favorite player of all time. You got a great one with him for however long you keep him around. Not only will he go to bat for his teammates and raise the energy levels on/off the field, he will absolutely make crucial catches for you guys (that catch and run before OT had me jumping). I was honestly a little misty eyed watching him out there :( but I‚Äôm gonna have your games on every week from now on 

TAKE CARE OF MY MAN üò´ü•∫"
Give the ball to Dez!
"Love Dez‚Äôs attitude and I hope he can progress and help this team but if we don‚Äôt draft a high quality big bodied WR in the first round of next years draft, I‚Äôll lose my mind."
"beast, anyone that doesnt think so should be fired"
"The drop by Hollywood, at first down yardage, near the sideline in the 3rd (?) Q, was just totally unacceptable. If you‚Äôre gonna piss and moan about opportunity, you absolutely cannot drop the easy ones. 

Can‚Äôt wait for Dez to get more involved."
Put him in over Brown.
"Dez showed more promise today than any of our guys, except for maybe Snead. That should speak volumes of our WRs."
"I'm skeptical but I was favorably impressed today. It's unrealistic to think he will be the savior of this stinking offense. Not for lack of wanna, but depending on whether he is used right. It looked like he's still got gas in the tank."
"I've always thought Dez would be a great fit for us and I was super excited when we picked him up. I thought we should have years ago. He's the type of physical receiver that absolutely compliments our style of offense. 

If Greg Roman had any sense he'd have Dez and Snead lining up outside and use Hollywood in the slot to spread opposing defenses out a little, especially with a banged up O line and no more great blocking TEs."
"Ravens Fan since 2015 from Europe here - If dez stays with after this year my first jersey is gonna be that sweet black 88

Just wanna see a TD this year and him throwing up that X

X"
He plays a great game on and off the field.
"did anyone else yell ""Dez caught it"" when he made his first reception lmao"
"Literally making history! Couldnt be happier for him. Hes earned this, and his gratitude makes it feel even better. A silver lining at minimum."
I didn't watch the game (for superstitious reasons) and we lost anyway but all follow up reports emphasized how open Dez was throughout. They have to feed the beast! Let him get hot. Lemar has to scan the field or begin to trust more of his receivers.
"His biggest play was a totally improvised route. That‚Äôs what this team needs, a veteran who can read and react to the defense"
"you can tell Dez is hungry. At this point, I want to see him get more starting reps. Maybe even in LIL MARQUISE‚Äôs spot (bc seriously,  The production at that position couldn‚Äôt get worse than it‚Äôs been)."
Most of the plays I saw was him getting the ball behind line of scrimmage and he plows through one or two defenders to get the extra 5 yards.  The yard after catch is a big importance. Dez will save our season.
"Joe Burrow got injured and it doesn't look pretty. Basically on the same level of Boyle's injury. 

Couldn't even protect your franchise QB for 1 season. I stg if he becomes the next Andrew Luck..."
"i know i hate us too, our season is over, it's been over


edit: I really just feel dead inside"
I feel for him... There has been an explosion of elite dual threat / hybrid QBs but he‚Äôs by far the best pocket-style/playmaker I‚Äôve seen at quarterback in a long time... Wish he was in another organization for sure.
There was also a season when Baltimore couldn‚Äôt protect our franchise QB. It‚Äôs the NFL.  Injury rate is 100%.  This shit happens.
"Injuries are part of football. Look at 49ers, half their starters are in IR or out because of injuries. Including their QB. And nobody feels bad for them"

?
Lol whut.
Wtf
Yes
It‚Äôs so frustrating to watch the ravens wrs all they do is if their route is done they don‚Äôt curl back to the qb or even gives him a chance. Lamar literally creates 5-6 seconds by himself but the weapons don‚Äôt give him anything to work with. This is really mind boggling how can anyone say they‚Äôre not getting targets when they don‚Äôt put the effort to get the ball thrown to them.
Dez Bryant looked good. Excited for him to be gameplanned out of the equation by Roman like he does with all our weapons.
"Dez looks good. 

The rest of the WR coup at this point performs like they usually do a couple of drops, bad routes , not making a play on the ball when it‚Äôs in your face, not fighting for extra yardage. It‚Äôs expected from them at this point"
Im not even sure if boykin has had a target in three weeks.
""
Praying for him. I really like him.
Scary injury man hope hes okay. This is what happens when dont protect your franchise qb. Andrew luck vibes
This poor kid. He‚Äôs got a lot of heart. He plays like they‚Äôre going to the Super Bowl every game even if they get stomped. I hope it‚Äôs not career-changing.
I'm honestly sorry to hear. The human body is just not made for that.
I made an exception of not taking anyone from the division other than Ravens for my fantasy team just because I really like this kid. Sucks he was put behind that trash line and hope he comes back better than ever
Nobody cares

"Thanks for all the love. Can‚Äôt get rid of me that easy. See ya next year‚úä

""
For the sake of this goddamn team
"Imagine waiting until Week 11 to realize J.K. Dobbins is a fucking workhorse back

And then not using him in the 2nd half"
"DO YOU LIKE RUNNING THE BALL ON FIRST DOWN EVERY FUCKING DRIVE? 
DO YOU LIKE SENDING 5 GUYS ON VERTICALS BECAUSE YOU CAN'T DRAW UP ANY OTHER ROUTE COMBINATIONS? 
DO YOU LIKE HAVING NOBODY OPEN ON DEEP ROUTES BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A FUCKING CROSSING ROUTE IS?

WELL BOY DO I HAVE A COORDINATOR FOR YOU!"
Harbaugh has done it before and won a Super Bowl. Seems like a lot of talent is not being used the way it could.  Maybe a jolt like this could give them a boost.
Honestly the defense was far far more shameful.  They literally melted down.
You mean you wanted a run play 2nd and 7 at the 11? Or 3rd and 7 at the 11?
All you Roman apologist please explain the first two red zone drives. Or how after 10 weeks he still choose to start Ingram
3rd and 17 in OT in our own end and he dials up a screen. God damn it.
Harbs letting this all happen with no heat whatsoever....
"Where can we see what we can't see on TV?  I mean there are so many times where Lamar is sitting back there with time and he doesn't throw the ball. Are guys just not open or is Lamar just not seeing it?   You rarely hear Brown's name.  Willie Snead seems to be the only wide out who is ever open.  

That said if that is the truth, you need to do what the Steelers did.  Picks (rubs) get the guy open over the middle. etc.  And please, play Dobbins more."
"was bad on the 49ers, bad on the bills, and now bad on the ravens"
"Cam Cameron getting fired is what sparked our run in 2012/2013 so fuck it why not. Staring at 6-5 so might as well. No creativity on first down and his unit seems to fail at the biggest times. False starts, botched snaps, poor execution in general. It doesn‚Äôt all fall on him but someone has to fall on the sword."
"I was on the fence about this before, but now I'm definitely leaning toward this side. He's not the root of all of our problems but he's not really doing us any favors either. A lot of people are saying Lamar should be playing better and thats not Roman's fault, but I do think that Roman is not playing to Lamar's strengths like we did last year."
"3rd and goal before kicking the FG to make it 24-24, Lamar was sitting in the pocket and no one could get open. I don‚Äôt understand why we can‚Äôt scheme guys open. Maybe Lamar should have rolled left or right to maybe open up some space w a roving LBer but I just feel that when other QBs on other teams sit like that all day in the pocket, someone gets open eventually."
"Teams have to respect the passing game in order for us to set up the run, but Roman is trash at developing passing plays. Combine that with terrible situational awareness (not trying to get ANY points going into the half???) and we end up with an OC who is good at calling run plays when the run is needed but can‚Äôt call plays that will lead to a comeback to save his life."
"What happened to the up-tempo offense?!

Like...we were completely flat against the Colts, then came out of the locker room in the second half running faster paced, it worked fantastically against a top-five defense, and then we just...have never gone back to it since?

I can give some leeway in the Pats game because of the weather, but I can't think of anywhere I saw it today, and I don't understand how you don't put that to use in this game.

What kind of offensive coordinator finds something that works great, even against a great defense, and just never does it again?!"
Honest question: who is both a better OC and available for a scheme that fits Lamar?
I don't get why we refuse to run the football. The Titans run the ball and they don't care if you know.  We have a stud in Dobbins and he barely gets a sniff in the 2nd half? Unacceptable.
"And replace him with who?

Roman called a good game today. I know people don‚Äôt want to hear that, but it‚Äôs true. The ravens lost because they couldn‚Äôt execute on simple open plays. Sure he calls a few bonehead plays a game but that‚Äôs no different than last year. The difference is the team executed last year and isn‚Äôt this year."
"As a Niners fan, I knew it was only a matter of time before I would see this."
"Yes. This.

The Defense was bad today, sure, it's been bad for a few weeks and with no one to win on the LOS due to injuries, and rookie LBs who are struggling in coverage, it's gonna put a huge strain on the secondary in crucial moments.

The Offense has been a joke for weeks now, and anyone who has All-22 can tell you that it's absolutely lacking creativity in formations, routes, and key concepts in key moments. Lamar looks frazzled to the point where I feel awful for him after breaking out in a huge way last season. The OL is a disaster(even without Ronnie it should not be as bad as it's been), the WRs haven't developed at all. Roman is a one trick pony. He's gotta go. Who would replace him in-season though? Might not be until the offseason."
Please
"Not just for the team, but for my own sanity."
"This is what it is, always has been, and always will be with Harbaugh. Roman is just another failed retread coordinator. Whoever replaces him will be the same thing."
I rly want it to happen but idk when it would happen no way they do It this week cuz there‚Äôs only gonna be 4 days till the Steelers game possibly after the game but we prolly gonna be 6-5 by then
"Damn, beat me to it."
"Once again, Greg Roman is not the best OC but he is not the worst.

You Ravens fans don't get it.

I am pretty sure it was not Roman's idea to trade away the second best pass catching TE on an offense that depends on 3-TEs set for passing the football.

And then REFUSE to upgrade the WRs corps while harming the TEs Corp.

That is on the Front Office and how they choose to dump resources after resources after precious resources into the defense while the offense (especially passing game) suffers."
Hes a clown
We ran the ball on 16 of 22 first downs when you take out the two minute drives in each half. We finished at 3.9 YPC. That's the extent of the problem today.
"At this point fire everyone except DeCosta and Harbaugh and if Harbaugh fucks up picking his coordinators again, fire him too."
At least you don‚Äôt have Matt Nagy.
This guy gets it..lol!  I‚Äôm a ravens fan true and true but where is the adjustment on offense.  I really don‚Äôt wanna see Lamar hurt fucking with our offensive woes.
I agree at this point with switching something up at OC but lets be real would it even matter that much since we are getting deep in the season. Lamar for sure has to develop more in the passing game but we really have no receiving threats. Other than Andrews/bombing it to butterfinger Brown or an occasional Snead it looks like Lamar just notices no one is open and then panic scrambles. I highly doubt there is going to be some random magic on offense with what we are working with. I completely agree on feeding Dobbins though as most people are mentioning.
"Watching the Cheifs Raiders right now...after the Chiefs TD drive, I think Hill caught 4 passes....all within 10 yds of the LOS...DIDNT HAVE A DEFENDER WITHIN 10 FEET OF HIM ON ANY OF THEM! Why cant we get Duv or Hollywood in those spots?!?! Just boots and little flat passes and hill is always schemed WIDE open. So frusterating watching a real offense work their skill players."
The mans strangling this team with the leather belt known as his play calling
"The Titans needed a touchdown and a two point conversion, and the defense gave it up."
"Roman has not been the problem these last 2 weeks. He didn't drop balls, he didn't overthrow or underthrow receivers. These 2 losses fall on team execution"
"I don't disagree- but he called just a good enough game today for his seat to not get hotter. 

It wasn't his decision to force Lamar to throw downfield (INT). It wasn't his decisions that made Marquise Brown have bricks for hands. It wasn't his decisions that led the Ravens defense to forget how to tackle on multiple occasions. It wasn't his decisions that led a backup center to false start. 

He didn't call a perfect game, but he called a good enough one that we should have been able to win if we just played fundamentally sound football all the way around."
Yes please
Like....does he have money on the ravens not making the playoffs? Because he's calling plays like he has money on the ravens not making the playoffs.
Bring back Matt Cavanaugh so you bandwagon fans can see what real ravens offense looks like.
Agreed. This was sad
Roman didn‚Äôt lose that game. Shitty tackling and stupid mistakes did.
"Firing Roman isn't gonna help that's against 2 bottom DVOA defenses, Lamar keeps making horrendous throws and hand punts (aka deep ball picks). Agreed Roman is the most replaceable and he should be replaced, but this is more on Lamar for sure."
Is he the coach responsible for teaching tackling?
I‚Äôll never understand bringing in Skura and lining up Ricard next to him on 1st and 10 and expecting to get anything on that play. It‚Äôs an obvious run and it‚Äôs 1st and 10 w a jumbo package.
I think some of this has to fall on EDC as well. They didn‚Äôt make the moves up front to replace Yanda and they still haven‚Äôt given Lamar enough threats
"Already knew Greg Roman was going to be a problem in long run. Just like the 49ers, he was great for one season and sucked the rest. Also he doesn‚Äôt like passing."
"Anybody remember when I said I was thinking about putting a stack on JK for ROY right after the draft? 

Edit: I only put a $100 down.. I didn‚Äôt get enough reassurance. It‚Äôs gonna come down to JK and Carlos of KC"
i been saying this since he was hired... e‚Äôs gonna get harbaugh fired... if they don‚Äôt win the super bowl this year harbaugh will be on the hot seat
I would want Kubiak back but I don't know how he stands with the organization after he left
I‚Äôd like to see him work on his passing schemes. Dude only ever uses like 3 routes from the damn tree in his pass plays.
Remember when folks were shocked Roman didn't get offered a HC gig in the offseason? How many franchises are feeling like they dodged a bullet right now?
"anyone else hear Romo the whole game basically making fun of Roman when they were ignoring Dobbins and Dez all gameüòÇ
Maybe we‚Äôd be better off with Romo at OC"
"I agree our play calling is shit at times, way too many crap red zone options, but fuck me gently with the rough end of a pineapple, how many fucking mistakes do we keep repeating? Should have won the game with Hollywood over the line but an early snap - really? After last week!? - drew a penalty flag. Illegal formations have plagued us, as have false starts and a couple of holding calls in recent weeks have cost us. That‚Äôs on the players. Our discipline is appalling. We‚Äôre dumb. Really dumb. We don‚Äôt learn. Must be frustrating as hell for everyone. I know I‚Äôm frustrated. The dog is sick of getting booted during Ravens games this year."
"Just when you thought Roman realized J.K was the solution at the run game, he was like, ""hahahaha JK motha fuckas!"""
Y'all got any more of that Gary Kubiak?
Greg Roman has one too few Gs in his first name for a coordinator. On that alone he should be fired
"Y‚Äôall mfs over react after every loss. Yes, things aren‚Äôt clicking right now but we had the best offense last year. Please let‚Äôs just give it some time"
We're 6-4 and this is an extreme overreaction. Offense looked better today. Give it some more time. It would hurt the psyche of the team to get rid of him when we're 6-4 and still very much in playoff contention.
Fire Roman. And please get rid of his ugly mullet haircut.
Easy to blame everything on Roman but that‚Äôs far from the case. Patrick Queen NEEDS to step up he‚Äôs been getting steamrolled lately.
"Missed the game. Just saw the score. I didn't miss much based on these comments. Would have left him as ""run game coordinator"""
LOL You can‚Äôt be serious.
"Our season isn‚Äôt over till it‚Äôs over say what you want I‚Äôm going to continue to Believe in us till it‚Äôs all said and done 
Other thing is it‚Äôs surprising that some ‚Äúfans‚Äù get so mad they say fuck the ravens"
"Stop it Jesus Christ. Greg roman didn't miss the throw to andrews, or false start twice, or throw the deep interception, or give up 90 yard td drive. The players failed"
[deleted]
"The OT drive was terrible, but this game is on Lamar, he wasn‚Äôt supposed to throw deep which led to the INT, and he over threw Andrews on that easy 3rd down conversion."
"Buddy, this loss is not on Roman. It‚Äôs on the D. With the exception of the deep INT lamar threw, I had no issue with his play-calling today."
"Fire Roman, cut Hollywood, cut Skura, cut Judon, fire our WR coach. And if Harbaugh can‚Äôt win a playoff game this year fire him too, it will be time to move on. Il love harbaugh, but this isnt a well disciplined team anymore. The special teams fake, the Offensive false starts these are on the coaching staff. We have been making too many mistakes and it‚Äôs costing us dearly.


I really do believe Lamar has the talent to win a SB but we have to be careful about his development. Get the right people in here who can help him out."
"So soon after priasing him last year? seriously?

C'mon man it's not just the coachng that's an issue here?"
"Doesn‚Äôt matter who‚Äôs calling plays, your running back playing QB is the issue. Fucking noodle arm that can‚Äôt throw outside the numbers. Hilarious. Season over, you need you next year."

"The title says it's all, from week to week feel like everything about this year is weak. One week, the offense chokes, the next the defense, then the center can't snap. Other than the eagles dream team, I have not seen a more overrated team in years."
We're one and done IF we make the playoffs.  This is my least favorite Ravens team in years.  So frustrating.
"There were people who looked at our schedule and were wondering where and if we would even lose a game this season. Coming off last season expectations were extremely high for this roster to take the next step. Unfortunately, it's increasingly looking like the Ravens ran a gimmick offense last year that was figured out in the post season.   


This team will be lucky to make it into the playoffs. It's a pretty dramatic drop off from being many peoples favorite to win the Superbowl."
I been saying that the roster is overrated but we have had tremendous injuries at the worst time so idk
They fall to 8 in the power rankings my bet
We aren‚Äôt contenders I‚Äôm sorry but we aren‚Äôt.  Anyone who thinks we are is overrating the team.
Extremely overrated
Atleast we will get a pick in the late teens to draft another 5 for receiver
"Teams found better ways to stop Lamar/rbs running, Lamar didnt get any better as a passer when theres not much runs. We are a mediocre team. We cant beat a good team now. Hear people say we did last year, and we did, but dont see how we do that this year."
Very overrated.  We surely had some injuries but there is a lot more wrong here than just injuries.
"Less now, but they were very. They‚Äôre not a top ten team. They‚Äôre barely a top ten team healthy, and that‚Äôs with half the league being horrid."
""
Dez has been a Raven for 2 weeks and he‚Äôs already got more fire and desire to win than anyone else on the team
Lmao what the fuck are the ravens even doing anymore
[deleted]
Team has no heart this year and marlon was right at the end of last year.  This team's identity is to choke.
Fuck this season
"This team is so fucking soft. No energy or charisma, just a shell of last years team."
"Well, at least Dez did good I think"
"Dropped passes, poor routes, false starts, injuries, Lamar is clearly starting to not trust any of the looks he's seeing, not feeding the hot hand consistently, and just overall piss poor offense.

Really, really fucking tiring."
Horrible defense at the most important times.
Fucking offense needs to move the ball
6-4 is a mediocre record and even that is a very generous record given how this sorry ass team has played all year.
That third down at the end of regulation was so fucking frustrating. Lamar had about ten minutes to throw and no one could get open. I don‚Äôt know what more you could ask for in a potential game-winning play
Thinking that‚Äôs a back breaker on the season. We likely lose on Thursday
Secondary blew this one
We are not good. We are above average. But 6-4 is not good
"I cant pick a single player to blame. The team as a whole failed.

Other than Dobbins, our RBs were horrible.
Hollywood missed catches like he was playing with his eyes closed.
Until the very end, all of Lamar's run plays had him literally running into our own offensive linemen.
On amazingly long pass plays, with lamar scrambling for 20 seconds, no one could get open.

take your pick."
"It's really depressing watching other games and seeing teams with WRs that make contested catches consistently.

Anytime I see Lamar throwing to someone, unless there's no one within 2 yards, I just expect an incompletion. And even then we have souljas that will drop them."
"This entire team is just bad

Edit: Ok ok, you're all right, Tucker is still the goat."
"Ravens before the bye: Fun to watch contender

Ravens since the bye: Has felt like sticking my dick in a beehive for 3 hours every Sunday"
"On a positive note, it was refreshing to see Dez getting the ball. I haven't seen a Ravens receiver look so fired up since Steve Smith."
"I‚Äôm not mad they lost. I don‚Äôt care about their record. What pisses me off is a consistent lack of fight this team shows week in and out. I said it in the game thread and I‚Äôll say it again. They disrespect the shield when they play like pansies like that. 

Another team (the team that disrespected you and knocked you out of the playoffs last year by the way) comes into your stadium disrespects the logo and talks shit to your coach and you‚Äôre going to let them punch you the fuck in the mouth like that? 

You think a Ray Lewis led team would let that happen? The difference between the Titans and Ravens is fight. They had more fight in their dogs and it was obvious. Ravens just laid down and took it. Marcus Peters has always been a flag football player so whatever, but the other dudes on that AJ Brown touchdown. Embarrassing. Just embarrassing. 

Titans are playing like the Ravens of 2000-2012."
What a waste of a season
Fire Greg Roman upvote party
draft 3 wrs and 4 o linemen i don‚Äôt give a fuck
"Up 21-10 and the offense turns to shit with bad turnovers, horrible penalties and sloppy plays. The defense turns to shit and can't tackle anybody and gives every receiver 3 yards of cushion to let them catch every ball. 

Hilarious."
Every game I‚Äôve watched we lost. I‚Äôm done watching games for the rest of the season
Fuck Greg Roman
"You let a team come into your house and whooping your ass in the playoffs, stand on your logo, talk shit to your head coach, and then pull off a comeback overtime victory? These mofos are soft. Period. Straight up spineless and heartless."
Blew a 21-10 lead. Fuck this team
You know who didn‚Äôt do shit this game marcus peters
PATHETIC
Fuck the Titans. Just fuck them
"Look at JK Dobbins and Derrick Henry's stats.

Comparable in every way today except:

Henry got the ball 11 more times, because they understand that he's great and that they win with him.

Stop forcing the ball to these ass receivers. Since Hollywood bitched on twitter he has been TERRIBLE. 

Andrews, Snead, and Dez were the only receivers showing some effort on the field tonight.

The defense was, as expected, completely trash without Calais and Brandon Williams.

I don't have any interest in being pessimistic, but I'll say it again: if those two players don't get back on the field soon, then we're going to get ran all over by every remaining team this season.

Zeke, Chubb, James Robinson, Mixon(if he's back), even Wayne Gallman is about to cut us up."
"I got hate for this last year, but it‚Äôs very clear that taking Hollywood over DK Metcalf was a big mistake. People said dumb shit like ‚Äúoh we can‚Äôt develop wideouts anyways‚Äù well so then why do you take one that‚Äôs fucking tiny"
"Y'all, call me fair weather, but I've been here since '96. 

We are pure trash right now. Absolutely trash. 
Take your pick for who is on the hot seat;

Harbs?
Roman? 

Either Lamar has no help with personnel or Lamar isn't being coached the best way."
This team is a disgrace. They let the titans disrespect the field and did nothing
"This is the angriest I have been at a loss in forever, because it is so unbelievable yet SO PREDICTABLE"
People are shitting on all things offense but the defense is what really lost this game.
Bro I am straight up not having a good time right now
This team is soft as Charmin. Its fucking pathetic.
MAN FUCK THEM CORNER MISSING TACKLES LIKE MOFOS COMON GUYS FFS
Fuck it. This team ain‚Äôt ready. Im just going to accept there‚Äôs no signing/adjustment that will get them ready for January. They‚Äôre wildcard upsetters at best.
"I implore people to go watch other teams WR play. There's a good chance at least one of Lamar's balls to the endzone is a TD and Duvernay pick would've been an incompletion at best. 

This doesn't excuse the bad plays Lamar made. But he gets ZERO help on the other end. Other than the Mark Andrews catch week 1 I can't remember one of our receivers making a five star play."
"Let the entire opposing team essentially tell you ""fuck you, you fucking posers."" before the game and then watch them prove how right they were."
Pain
Faded
I'm over this season. This ain't it.
Greg Roman is fucking worthless
Fuck this soft ass team
"After what happened the last time these two went at it, no excuses whatsoever for losing this game"
"Is it just me or is this team just devoid of heart and personality this year? No Ingram hyping up the sidelines, no Truzz, just seems so heartless this year"
In come the Titan trolls
"What makes me the most sad is just seeing how soft this team plays. Win or lose the Ravens have always been a gritty fight until the end team, and now they're just incredibly lazy in crunch situations on both sides of the ball. It's like they don't care, and if the team doesn't care then why the fuck should we as fans?"
"Has Hollywood just checked out?  I feel like after that tweet, his heads just not in it.  Drop balls, poor route running, etc.  just incredibly unprofessional"
"2013: 8-6 in a playoff spot, drop last 2 games and miss

2014: blow 2 14 point leads to the Pats in Divisional round 

2015: 8-8

2016: eliminated from playoffs in week 16 game against Steelers 

2017: eliminated from playoffs week 17 against bengals 

2018: loss in wildcard 

2019: loss in divisional 


Harbaugh‚Äôs seat better be red hot"
"So unbelievably soft. 

They came in, talked shit, and we rolled over. Absolute joke of a team."
"Old ravens defensive players are rolling in their graves after seeing that effort of tackling.

Holy shit, that was beyond atrocious."
penalties have fucked this team. on the final drive we were cruisin. marquise had a wide open touchdown on that screen pass but the false start set us back. then two plays later mark andrews was wide open for the first and lamar missed him. this was easily winnable
"I just feel like every break goes in favor of our opponent. Looks like the Ravens have to work 2x as hard for every one if their yards. Then as soon as something is going well some stupid shit like an early snap/fluke false start happens and instead of it just being a ""bump"" it torpedoes our drive. We were about to win that game in the 4th."
10-6 at best this year. Literally 14 teams in this league that are better than us. Lucky to sneak into the playoffs at this point when there are six teams fighting for three spots.
"I'm so livid I don't even know what to say right now.

Happy (belated) birthday to me lmao"
FUCK
GG this season
I love how the titans shit on the emblem before the game and we responded by coming out and playing like a pop Warner team. Fuckin bums
Now we‚Äôre 3rd in the afcn lmao. Fucking awful. This was our window too. It‚Äôll only get worse.
2 run plays after going up by 11 and you wonder why the defense got worn out?
"It‚Äôs infuriating because there‚Äôs just so much unmet potential and last season set a really high bar as far as expectations. 

I do think they need to go in a new direction for Offensive coordinator, but no clue if there are better replacements for Roman."
"Call me crazy, but I'm still optimistic for this season.

Get some key players back who are currently injured or hobbled, simplify the offensive gameplan, and teach the defenders how to tackle.

Schedule eases up quite a bit after next week.

Just gotta make the dance, then who know what happens...

Although, some of these losses are ridiculous but maybe...just maybe things will start going the ravens way here.

Lots of games left. Don't give up yet. Ravens always seem to do better as underdogs as well for some odd reason.

Can't go 14-2 every year breaking all kinds of records as nice as that sounds."
I feel like the performance of the 2019 and 2020 Ravens teams should be reversed
"Lamar Jackson left way too many points on the board today by missing guys wide open. Its becoming a problem. I actually think Greg Roman called a good game, guys were schemed open a lot.  

Marquise Brown is also looking like a bust. He could be a decent WR2 maybe but I have no hope of him ever being a WR1."
Whatever. Just... whatever.
I'm sad I can't even enjoy dez balling out today
Our #1 WR today was a guy who hadn't caught a pass since 12/31/17 lol
Patrick Queen is reaching historic levels of flying under the radar. He has been the worst defender on the field by far all season. But a few sacks and fumble recoveries are saving him from scrutiny. He is out of position 95% of the time. He gets eaten alive in the run game and is leaning forward and gets caught by the play action EVERY time.
Classic Ravens
"I‚Äôm starting to think missing the playoffs might actually not be that bad if it makes the front office aware of the problems on the team. 


I‚Äôm so fucking pissed!"
"Remember after Thursday we play Cowboys, Browns, Giants, Jags, and Bengals. We can still easily hit 11 wins this year without winning Thursday. But I wouldn't expect much in postseason"
They‚Äôre just not very good this year. I‚Äôm going to continue cheering them on and hope for improvement as the season goes on though.
"Getting fumbles is cool but tackling is probably more important, secondary spent way too much time digging at the football instead of taking people to the ground. Thats what cost us in the end. Dline was stopping Henry but then the secondary would give up RAC on 3rd down trying to strip the ball. That forced the big dlinemen back on the field and they got tired. If we had Williams and Campbell in we might have done better because we had depth. 

Aside from Lamar's INT in the first half he played really well. He needs to go back to scrambling like he did on the last drive of reg. We would have had the TD there if it wasn't for little mistakes like Mekari's early snap or Andrews false start."
"No offensive line- Skura is hurt, Phillips and Stanley are hurt, Fluker is an athletic liability, therfore  can't protect the QB. Center is mediocre. Too many penalties that kill drives

Wide receivers are useless other than Snead.  Marquise is too small, can't separate, and drops the ball at any hint of contact. as of now, he's a waste of a pick.  Boykin can't do anything I guess. Duvernay is ok. They should use him and Proche more.  We have Andrews and Duvernay and Snead and that's it. Otherwise passing to the back our some fullback or something. that's not a legitimate passing game.

&#x200B;

No defensive line- can't stop the run, can't rush the pasher, so Wink has to blitz and now people are wide ass open.

Linebackers can't keep outside contain for shit.  Nobody cna cover the flats for shit. It's as if they just assume no players will go there. Hence we keep giving up a fuckload of yards on the outside.  


all this combines to a mediocre team like we see- beat up on trash teams and lose or get whipped by good teams."
Does anyone else feel like that game was dominated by the ravens for all but like 2 defense drives?
"I feel we played better than against NE. Took less penalties, and some of the dumb mental mistakes were cleaned up. Edwards f\*ed up a simple run play inside the 10 yard line, Harbs pulls him the next play.

OTOH, Lama is still floating deep passes, and his run game was figured out on several plays, but the rest of the team needs to show fight. Not talking about the barking at the opponent, but contesting throws, even taking an OPI to prevent a pick, etc... Our ""No. 1"" receiver was invisible (was he a scratch?).

This team's being held together by ~~duct~~ scotch tape, and it really shows."
"I shit on Judon constantly (cuz he deserves it), but he played well today and seems to be minimizing his dumb plays.

Hope he keeps it up"
So the Browns are ahead of us now; yet another feather in the cap of 2020.
"The lack of good receivers is really costing us. Lamar has a tendency to overthrow, but having bigger receivers who can compete for jump balls would go a LONG way. We need to be able to get big yard gains quickly, but we have to rely on the run to get up field.

5'8 Hollywood is a bust, he just can't compete as a WR."
This is team remarkably mediocre.
"If you say we lost because of Lamar, you‚Äôre an idiot. Plain and simple"
"this was a ""what did you say about my mamma"" type game on account of what happened last year. i can't believe they fucked it up. i know it's committing suicide saying anything about lamar but they need to get that kid some help asap. fire roman idk get your shit together cause your wasting a once in a life time type talent. 

this one hurts man. this was a personal type game to me i'm sure for a lot of other people too and we dropped the ball. smh."
"I can't wait for the post about how everything is just fucking dandy and the people not happy about losing games are ""fake fans"". Yall know it's coming"
"When I die, I want the Ravens to lower me into my grave, so they can let me down one last time"
"**I'm fucking done.**

All you shit fake fans saying Truss and this gay ass hype shit.

Weve had glaring issues at OL, DL, OLB and WR for fucking years. We can't stop anything because **ONE** NT and DE go down? 

**that's bad depth**.

Why do we break apart because ONE RG retires?? This is just a monumental collapse in every way.

We need to clean fucking house. Judon, Roman, Hollywood, Skura, Ingram, Peters.

Just cut this dead weight.


Why do we not run bootlegs? Why do we only do play action 6 times in the entire game? Why do we go RBBC when Dobbins is crushing it? Why do we go 3 pass plays on 1st and goal to win the game? How do you run a screen on third downand 17?

Lamar blocks entire left side every 7 step drop and never sees open WRs. This is a failure of coaching and then putting players in bad positions with shit play calls.

Fuck anyone who supports or wants to defend these decisions, these are millionaires making $$ off your viewership and NFL gear purchases. You expect a good product not this sad Cleveland Browns bullshit.


Reed, Ogden, Suggs, Ray, Ngata would be fucking ashamed of this team."
Seasons Over.
"Got outscored 20-3 in the last 25 minutes of a game that has massive playoff implications, and are now 1-3 since the bye. Are the people who have been all sunshine and rainbows about this team for the last two months now ready to admit there are some serious issues?"
Anyone know what Lamar is saying in the post-game press conference? If its anything about him needing to play better he can get fucked. Sick of hearing that shit and he doesn't play better the next game.
"I‚Äôve succumbed. We‚Äôre average. We look exactly the same as the late Flacco years, even with Lamar Jackson at QB. This is Harbaugh football"
Don‚Äôt want to hear any excuses the run defense played good but the pass coverage was absolutely dogshit.  Humphrey isn‚Äôt an elite corner and won‚Äôt be until he can actually not get destroyed by AJ Brown.
Selling out to stop the run and you do that
Wow another blown lead. And yet nothing will be done c
Hate to admit it but last season is increasingly looking like a fluke. This roster isn't competing with the top teams in the league this year barring a drastic change somewhere.
Every year I get so excited to watch this team play and every year they find a way to disappoint me in a spectacular fashion
Who‚Äôs ready to get real toxic?? Lol
"Yeah, I‚Äôm good on this year. Try again next year. Get healthy. This team simply is not contending for anything this year."
"Team needs big, talented receivers to make plays. Notice Titans‚Äô receivers stepped up and made plays. Dez was our best receiver today, and that‚Äôs an indictment on the talent at disposal. 

Defensively we are frauds. Guys dropping like flies here and can‚Äôt even tackle or stop guys. 

It‚Äôs great having the Browns, and perhaps a group of other teams (MIA, OAK) ahead of us in the playoff race /s

EDIT: 6-5 after Thanksgiving guys. Book it."
"Why is everyone focusing on the tackling by our D etc. 30 seconds left, 2 and 6 at the Titans 10 or 15, game on the line.. Cant do shit"
We aren‚Äôt making the playoffs lol
Firmly believe that there should be a change in snaps for Dez at this point. Showed more heart and plays than players who have been on the team longer.
DRAFT OFFENSIVE LINEMAN. DRAFT THEM HIGH. DRAFT THEM OFTEN. I like DeCosta and I like Harrison and Queen but this line problem has been growing and spending a 1st and a 3rd in the same draft on a position (ILB) which we have effectively platooned and which usually only has one player on the field is no way to fix the problem.
Roman saying that we have a new revamped offense is about as truthful as Mike McCarthy saying that he embraces analytics now.
"I hope the Ravens get their shit together after Thanksgiving. My gf is a ravens fan, I hate to see her upset about this team."
M & T Junkyard
We took TWO swings in the first 100 picks of the draft & struck out both times. Unbelievable. God himself would struggle as a WR on this team.
"I knew we‚Äôd lose today, but the way we loss is beyond infuriating"
What‚Äôs up with Hollywood? He has 57% catch rate and that‚Äôs not counting this game..
we need this Pittsburgh game bro
"- Think it‚Äôs time to fire Greg Roman. Now or as soon as the season is over. The chances of making the playoffs are slim with the last wildcard spot being such a tight race.

- The poor use of the RB‚Äôs and the play calling has been puzzling. Dobbins clearly can play in this league and gets hot fast. I believe Gus Edwards is a proper bruiser to put in there to chip away at the defense. Feed Dobbins, tire them out with Edwards. 

- I have no faith in the deep throws. None of the receivers can get separation and Mark Andrews is the clear no.1 option so he‚Äôs covered. Hollywood is teetering on bust territory. The receiving core is a clear problem. Would like to see Dobbins, Hill and Duvernay involved in the passing game more.

-"
"Also, up 8 and fucking Roman is letting Lamar launch it 60 yards downfield. We could ran it and played some situational football and been up two scores."
"I‚Äôve been saying it since we drafted him... Hollywood is not an NFL caliber receiver. 

Lamar doesn‚Äôt have his head in the game this season. They need to focus on making him comfortable again. 

Play calling is still terrible. Driving the ball down the field to put the game out of reach and you decide to throw deep with your QB who hasn‚Äôt connected all season? Yeah ok. 

Mark Ingram is still hurt. 

Dez should be in all of our offensive packages."
I regret watching today. I knew I should‚Äôve tuned football out.
Well at least we have our WR1 and WR2 in Dez and Snead
I‚Äôm getting less and less confident every day that Lamar can lead us to a comeback. He‚Äôs young and the Oline sucks but still disheartening
Excited to see the Lamar sucks hottakes which wouldn't exist if the Center didn't snap the ball early. Love reactionary football speak.
pain
RIP
Embarrassing
"Our offense is so bad. So, so bad."
"Fucking team loss. 

Offence choked away two drives, then defence was like ""I'll do it too"""
Remember when people were claiming that Roman was using the first half of the season to improve Jackson's arm. Lol
Not surprising without Stanley and Campbell.
"Wasn't expecting this win, but I'm disappointed we gave up that lead. We had a chance on this one and blew it, and we blew it twice already this year. If we make playoffs, we won't do much in them. Hopefully Thursday isn't a nightmare"
I hate this fucking season
Defense was shit and deserves blame but the fact that we can‚Äôt score more than 24 points every week is the reason we lose. FIRE GREG ROMAN
We'll go 9-7 miss the playoffs and draft ugly.
"It utterly baffles me how the offense can drive downfield guns a blazin then completely flop when they get to the redzone. I've been supporting Greg Roman for a long time, because I think he was instrumental in Lamar's develolment last year, but enough is enough. Stop the empty sets, please. They just arent working."
We kinda suck tbh
We stink
Injuries and shit playcalling are killing us
Penalties. Penalties in key situations all over since last season.
Madden curse.
There goes our playoff spot.
We should have tried to punch it in on that last drive in regulation. No one thought they were going to take this game in OT the way Henry was starting to open things up.
It's cold outside. We lost. I'm sad. Everything sucks.
Dez Bryant showed more effort than any of our other damn receivers! Sad....
There are really ppl in this thread wanting to trade Lamar..... I‚Äôm concerned
"Man I knew when we gave it back up 21-13 it was going to be bad. I remember clearly thinking we just want a FG here. Don‚Äôt be greedy, just 3 points and I‚Äôll be happy."
"I'll preface this by saying that going 1-3 in the past 4 is definitely concerning, no matter the context.

However, here's some perspective as to why its not *completely* time to panic. All 3 losses came down to the last possession. They came against teams that have an average record of 7-3."
worse than the browns lmfao
"As a positive note: Dobbins and Bryant when used were fantastic. The line also played surprisingly well considering the shuffle. 

But man, Roman is just so fucking bad. We can't throw the ball at all, and defenses are just openly challenging us to do it. Roman has done nothing to get Duvernay or Hollywood open in the intermediate/short routes, and I just don't know how much more of it I can take. 

Miles Boykin is also a waste of a roster spot at this point. Please just give all his snaps to Dez, and give Dez's old snaps to Proche."
I'm so tired of seeing bad offenses.
Can someone explain to me why we cant scheme any of our WR open at any time? Why are we putting our fourth string RB out wide on multiple plays instead of actual WRs?
"I live in Nashville, now I have to listen to how the Titans are better for another whole year. Let's beat the Steelers flock. If we don't do that, might as well lose out for a draft pick."
This looked like a game from 2017 Flacco. The offense somehow getting a couple first downs and then relying on field goals.
At least we‚Äôre getting disappointed in the regular season rather than the post season (so far)p
The pass game is nonexistent on this team. Even the crappy teams are making passes look effortless. With us it‚Äôs like trying to squeeze water out of a rock.
"Cmon!  This is not about the D ‚Äúchoking‚Äù.  As depleted.as the Dline was, the only way to match up was to take Titans strength away.  That strength is the power run/Henry and Tannehill PA off that run threat.  The only way to take that strength away is to get up on them by two scores either early or late.  The D had just held them to a FG to make it 21-13 early in the 4th.  This was time to protect the ball, move the chains, eat some clock ad get ‚Äúsome points, any points‚Äù to make it a two score game with probably single digit minutes left to go when the drive was complete 1qqaand that would be the point where Tannehill would have to beat us without the power run/PA threat.  He is barely average at best when forced to play that way.  So, while we‚Äôre grinding the ball, moving the chains and eating clock, Roman decides to take a shot on a deep ball.  The one thing that this offense may be the poorest at.  there are those who say they liked the call.  There are times and places to take that chance but that point in the game was not it.  Three points at that part of the game would have made it much harder for the Titans to get back in the game.  Instead, they have the ball plenty of time and can still stick with what their strength is with their Power/PA which our depleted D can not keep contained for ever.  Trying to fool an NFL team by trying to surprise them with what you aren‚Äôt good at doing is stupid coaching and unforgivable at the NFL level.  Roman has to go now, not tomorrow, now.  I‚Äôm tired of hearing that the WRs are the problem.I get it, they can‚Äôt get open, but they are what we got.  But a Lamar led offense can still overcome that, even with our depleted Oline, if we stick with what we do best, but we never do.  This will only get worse as long as Roman is here.  This is exactly what happened to the 49ers after 2014.  The rest of the league just sat back and waited for Roman to do stuff that his offense wasn‚Äôt good at/what kapernick wasn‚Äôt good at.  He‚Äôs doing the same thing now and wasting the talent that we have in Lamar.  Fire him immediately.  This will not get better as long as he is running this offense."
What are the chances we can get someone like Bieniemy in? 0.001%?
You guys do realize we play 5 trash teams and the Steelers. We aren‚Äôt great rn but if we figure it out and go at least 4-2 5-1 we‚Äôre a wildcard team
Guys I‚Äôm really sad
Welp. It‚Äôs a short week too. Doubt anyone gets fired or we see any meaningful changes
On a positive dobbins is a fucking beast
So JK and Lamar are pretty much saying that the Titans showed more effort than them. This team is so soft from a mental standpoint.
Patrick Queen has got to get it together. He‚Äôs a liability
"This game sucked, but did anyone else see the Titans tackle coming down on the back of Wolfe‚Äôs knee? That was some Cobra Kai bullshit."
"Can I just say that the Titans are legit the most classless fanbase in the NFL? Not even AFC North divisional rivals act like absolute clowns the way they do.

Even with the Steelers there‚Äôs some form of mutual respect there. We talk our trash before the game, but we have some level of respect afterwards because it‚Äôs always hard fought. The Titans have absolutely no respect for anyone, including themselves."
Probably doesn‚Äôt get said enough that we were remarkably healthy last season. This year we‚Äôre probably around the NFL average in terms of injuries. That‚Äôs been the biggest difference so far IMO.
"Titans fan here. I looked through both subreddits throughout the week (even commented on a few posts here) and neither fan base felt confident. We came out with the win, but that doesn‚Äôt always mean as much later as it does in the moment.

This next statement is not me trash talking but just making a statement: even the bottom seed can make it far. We did it last year, your team has done it before, hell, the freaking giants beat the undefeated Pats in a Super Bowl. 

Season is far from over, gents."
Greg Roman fucking sucks and should be fired NOW. Marcus Peters played like trash all game
I want off this ride
"This is most likely the season, Cleveland takes second place, the titans take our playoff spot, we literally cannot lose another game."
Aaaaannnddd just like that I‚Äôm checked out of this season.
"So fucking sick and tired of watching this team collapse and get embarrassed week after week.

Bisciotti and DeCosta need to step in and make some changes now to try and save the season. Roman needs to go, Harbs needs to fear for his job, and these players need discipline."
"Looking at the schedule, I think we are still a 10 win team. The question is gonna be if 10 wins is gonna be enough for a wildcard the way the AFC is shaping up."
"Why did this defense give up 11 point lead...including a 90 yard drive, with a two point conversion, and an OT TD?

The Ravens front office moronically spent all their damn resources on the defensive side of the ball...to only allow one dimensional teams that can barely pass beat them."
"They call him hollywood because he ""acts"" like a #1 receiver but he's just pretending."
Awful lot of fake bandwagon fans in this thread. Probably only started rooting for the Ravens last season.
"This team sucks and nothings gonna change. Decosta had 1 terrible draft and one mediocre one, the coaches suck and Lamar is not helping us."
"We have to stop blaming Greg Roman for everything this offense does wrong. The single biggest difference between last season and this one is execution. Lamar is missing wide open throws. It‚Äôs really that simple. This isn‚Äôt scheme. It‚Äôs execution. 

Roman isn‚Äôt perfect. But he wasn‚Äôt perfect last year, and the difference was it didn‚Äôt matter because we were always way up."
"And I‚Äôll add if significant changes aren‚Äôt made at coordinator positions, Roman or deeper, I want Harbaugh out. Thankful for him but his system just doesn‚Äôt work anymore."
Done with this team this season. Bunch of bums.
"It‚Äôs painful watching rookies like Herbert and Burrow, or other young QB‚Äôs like Mahomes or Josh Allen, and then watching the supposed MVP this year"
"IDK man, Lamar has to come big at the last drive, he just misses. I hate Roman as much as the next fan, but this game had fine play calling.

Also our cornerbacks need a tackle session ASAP. This season its probably fucked. I dont see us winning against Pittsburgh and Cleveland. Sadge."
#FaKe FaNs
Bunch of fair weather mofos in here I swear. Y‚Äôall are more embarrassing than this loss.
defense dead
LOL fuck me im done
This feels like 2012 but worse
Who we taking in the draft?
This is the worst winning ravens team in my life fuck
LEARN HOW TO FUCKING TACKLE.
Best thing to happens to this team would be to miss the playoffs.
Offense is shit butt.  Nothing more to say
"This is a bad football team. Nothing else to say. Overrated defense, incompetent offense, and a league MVP with unprecedented regression."
Wink is bad guys time for y‚Äôall idiots to realize blitzing all the time is absolutely shit
Well we are about to be 3rd in the afc north
"I've been optimistic long enough, this team is just bad. The only thing we have is a run game in which we abandon often for whatever reason"
We don‚Äôt deserve a playoff due to poor wr play this season  and injuries to defense and that putrid o line
I don't think we make the play offs at this rate... We're too banged up for a deep play off run
"This is the game I stop revolving my Sundays around the ravens. If I‚Äôm free, great. If not, I‚Äôll catch the highlights"
Another double digit lead that we choke away. WE FUCKING SUCK
See y'all next year!
"Fuck this season, fuck the nfl and its rigged reffing, and fuck this coaching staff"
Both defense and offense sucked today
Unfuckingbelievable
There‚Äôs no dog in this team. Just whimper.
Couldn't even protect the shield
"That one hurt. Right in the heart, feels sick to lose that one. Defence gave it their all but the offence didn‚Äôt put the damn game away when they should have. I hate this season and 2020 for the Ravens."
Sad.
Blame: Team‚Äôs Attitude/Approach
Baha can't tackle shit
Will Roman be fired?
Patheticcccc!
Well........here we are again......
"whole team is trash, especially fuck marcus peters"
This was a big game and a huge loss.  But there were some good things too.  This team can still go 10-6.
"Fucking sorry ass performance, we had that game too and just kneeled over and took it."
Season is cooked. This offense is absolute trash and our defense can‚Äôt maintain their high level of play while watching the offense squander it away.
and the Browns are about to overtake the Ravens in the Wildcard race.
Fucking pathetic play from everyone we're lucky if we even go to a playoff game
It‚Äôs not just Lamar. This whole team isn‚Äôt clutch.
[deleted]
"I literally don‚Äôt have positive takeaways any more. Roman was suspect as fuck again too many wasted opportunities. Receivers were bad, defense was ok initially but got gashed. Line was mediocre as fuck too and tons of dumbass pre snap penalties. Hate to say it but this ain‚Äôt a playoff team"
how disappointing
Secondary played their worst game of the season. Unreal
That final defensive play with the running td was a perfect synopsis of the entire game
"We haven't always matched up talent wise against other teams past years, but at least we would come out and played like we wanted to win and smash their noses in. Can we say the same thing about this team?"
You have to believe with campbell and williams the Ravens win that game. There's just too many injuries.
Fuck the defense and fuck the refs
"Somebody has to answer for this, surely."
Defense have not been able to get a stop once this year when it has been absolutely crucial this year. Add that to the worst redzone defense stat....we need to toughen up.
This has not been a fun season
I expected to lose that game and here I am still disappointed. The last quarter was embarrassing for everyone.
"Our secondary is supposed to be the backbone of this team. The past two weeks, they‚Äôve looked like fucking ass. 

Can‚Äôt cover shit. 
Can‚Äôt tackle."
"If Harbaugh comes out with ‚Äúwell just need to refocus, we‚Äôre almost there‚Äù bullshit I‚Äôm going to lose a lot of faith in him"
At least we might have a chance of getting rid of Roman
After we lose to Pittsburgh and inevitably cleveland we will finish 10 and 6 and miss playoffs.
Four drives having to settle for a field goal in the red zone just isn‚Äôt acceptable.
"Self inflicted wounds today, just like all season. These aren‚Äôt the types of things that magically change halfway through the year. I‚Äôve never seen so many Illegal Shift penalties. Just dumb."
No heart
Not even that mad üòÇ I expected a loss.
"‚ÄúHell no, they don‚Äôt know. Greg Roman has got to go‚Äù upvote party"
"How is that not a hold on Jonnu - we were losing anyway but like can we draw 1 fucking oline hold this year?
https://streamable.com/8u3e8b"
[This is fine. ](https://i.imgur.com/VCfbnog.png)
This season is over to be honest not negative
Bruh I‚Äôm gonna throw my remote through the tv next fucking dumbass penalty we take. Such a terribly disciplined team
"Guys we arent missing the playoffs lol calm down. Last year taught us very well regular season dont mean shit and its very hard to beat a team twice so if we see these mfs again we winning, we were close asf injuries fucked us wouldve won with stanley in and campbell. Head up flock, our season is far from over"
I knew we lost when Lamar threw that deep interception on 1st with over 7 point game lead. Fuck Roman.
How many times in the second half did we blitz and Tannehil threw dinky out routs for 10-20 yards? What the fuck is scheming any more.
I‚Äôm getting worried that this team is going to start imploding in the locker room and behind the scenes. This is definitely going to be a test for Harbaugh.
"Stupid Lamar INT, missing Andrews on the first RZ trip & missing him on the 3rd down. I'll give him credit for getting us into OT tho. Also the 2nd loss after leading at the half.....so maybe we'll trail at halftime against PIT & win?!?!?! Doubt it but whatever."
#No one other than DOBBINS came to play. Pathetic all around
"The ravens have just made me a sad boi the last couple weeks.

I was looking forward to beating Pittsburg but Idek anymore"
One player who can be commended - Will Holden. Played his ass off after getting called up today.
"Pre-season: Damn, our secondary is gonna be the best in the league. Nobody can run or pass on us.

This week: Secondary not only refuses to tackle or cover shit, they just watch the plays have the fucking time. JESUS CHRIST somebody needs to get fucking fired this week to send a message, how tf do we lose these fucking games"
Welp time to just watch College Football now at least Alabama is undefeated
Well hey at least the NBA is back in a month
Fire.Greg.Roman. Also fuck Hollywood he can‚Äôt catch a ball with his fragile ass hands. Play Dez more. JK needs to start. Lamar deserves better from us...
"This loss really hurts man. They came back, made the adjustments. The play by AJ brown was absoluty heart breaking. Nothing has been addressed. Nothing has been fixed. We‚Äôre probably going to be embarassed by the steelers on National tv.

Anyone who‚Äôs like ‚Äúyou have no truss‚Äù

Shut the fuck up. We are literally doing pretty much everything wrong."
After this performance someone needs to get fired! This team is soo damn lazy and I think our last season dominance made us wayy to cocky. Pathetic performance I am so pissed at this years team
Just infuriating to watch so much potential being squandered. We're pretty far from a lock to even make the post season rn.
We are behind the browns now
Team is soft
So many penalties. So little effort. The fuck is going on. I've seen bad ravens teams but one without spirit is rare...
This team genuinely makes me disappointed. All the Flacco check down years you still felt like they gave a shit. This team is weak mentally and physically and it shows.
"I feel like if you end up behind the Browns in the division, someone needs to be fired."
Hello darkness my old friend...
"Lose out, and draft a receiver. But not the receiver we want, choose the guy we definitely don‚Äôt want like when we didn‚Äôt want metcalf or aj brown"
Awful
Greg Roman needs to fucking con
"Allowing the TD prior to the end of regulation, when they could have at least forced a 4th down attempt? The fuck man"
Another game where opponents just arent penalized
Blowing that lead was absolutely soul crushing. I need a break from ravens football
All that trash talk and bumping look so hollow now that we got handled in the 4th and OT. I hate the Titans though.
FUCKING DONKEYS
We suck
"Hollywood having 0 catches(including one terrible drop) while Diontate Johnson is on a recent tear the past two weeks & AJ Brown giving TEN that TD at the end of regulation is just awful. 

Same with Claypool having 10 TDs this season but Boykin probably not even having 10 catches. What did we do to the football Gods? Did we talk to much shit last year?!??!?!?!"
LOL @ the comments in here
Tank for Trevor?
I didn‚Äôt expect us to win this game due to injuries. But it still sucks to have it be close and lose. If we make a couple plays we win this game. But that‚Äôs been the story the last couple weeks and it started with the Steelers game.
"Did Ingram even play? Mark Andrews, Dez Bryant, Willie ""midget"" snead, and JK dobbins are your entire offense."
We had an opportunity to get revenge and we blew it. We deserve all the shit we get after this one.
Thanks for the weekly reminder how trash the sub is.
"The Titans are actually shit, I can‚Äôt believe we handed them a win"
You know Im actually happy Henry scored on that last play because it was a lot less painful than watching them inch closer then hit a field goal.
They come to our stadium and dance on our logos and beat us by 7 in OT lol. What a pathetic excuse of a football team we are. Like someone coming to your house and telling you they‚Äôre going to fuck your wife and you do nothing to stop it
Last couple of games we have looked like the 20-25th best team in the league. Is Flacco back under center?
This is 2016 season levels of frustration
We cant even say at least we arent the browns anymore sad times.
"At least we were good last year lol, felt nice to actually be that dominant team for once. Now we‚Äôre back to the scheduled 8-8 team we have always been"
We are overrated af
We deserve every ounce of shit we get after this one.
Embarrassing defeat. This team just loves to choke. Playoffs are gonna be rough.
Ravens cheeks bro
Not making playoffs
"Defense shit the bed second half. Plain and simple. A few key penalties based off mental errors killed some key points of offense. But the tackling was nonexistent in the second half. I get it, they‚Äôre gassed, but they can‚Äôt let up. And they did. 

Call me crazy but I thought our patchwork O-line didn‚Äôt do a terrible job. Lamar had a bunch of plays where he was able to take some time and try to find someone (even if he didn‚Äôt actually find someone) and not be pressured. He was able to get some key yardage. I am mad we lost but realistically I‚Äôm surprised it was that close of a game."
This is painful. But this is also expectations. My buddy is a dolphins fan and was happy to be 6-3 where as I was disappointed. Now after today even moreso
4 games behind fat fuck. soon to be 5!
"Well as a Liberty Flames and a Ravens fan, I would like to go back in time and just sleep through this weekend."
"Instead of the Ravens raiding the Vikings for some WR talent, the Ravens raided them for DL help.

Unbelievable. Pure incompetence."
"man fuck this bs our d played like a bunch of little pussies that couldn't tackle minus Elliot, o boy it's gonna be an angry podcast tomorrow"
Lamar. Sub 200 passing again. This is the fucking nfl dude no one wins games with sub 200 passing
Wasn‚Äôt able to watch the game... my last missed game was around 2017 so I‚Äôve watched every single game since.. can somebody sum it up? Of course the game I miss we lose
I'm suprised you guys didn't target Will Compton at all whenever Brown when out of the game. Probably could have completed a pass every time.
"Not many people are bringing him up, but other than the forced fumble yesterday, I haven't heard Ngakoue's name at all since we got him.  One sack and five total tackles in four games with us."
"Really confused by all the comments, both from players and fans, saying the team had ""No fire"" or ""no heart"". If anything that's what they do have. What they don't have is competence or discipline."
Jackson is just not that good. sad to see.
Watching other teams just pisses me off. Why can't we have good receivers?
Lamar has to take some blame for this one. Didnt play well enough.
Yeah I'm somewhat out on Lamar. You can't be this inaccurate and win a super bowl. He's young be he absolutely HAS TO improve on accuracy or else he will be the next kapernick
Lamar did not play like he deserves big QB Money
Fuck Roman. Fuck injuries. Fuck everything
Fuck greg roman been saying this since literally week like 5 and last years playoff game but he fuckinf sucks
"Holy shit, we are now facing 3 strait losses, and the Titans and Pats aren‚Äôt even good, fuck this season. Don‚Äôt even control our own destiny anymore"
"Gotta look forward to 2021.  Need major changes, just really no heart anywhere on this team and it makes watching almost like a chore. Idk. Defense isn‚Äôt good unless garbage teams and offense gives the same mediocrity for like the tenth week in a row."
Once again the center position has fucked us
"This team has been sorry since the 2014 season but they were coached up. Then the talent deficit really showed right before Lamar took over. He dragged the team to the playoffs twice (no way in hell we sniff the playoffs without him last year let alone 14-2) and now injuries and a stale scheme and frankly some dudes drinking their own kool aid is rearing its ugly head. This team has raw talent but fuck this they need to take their lumps, miss these playoffs (won't do shit there anyways) and get back to the drawing board. the higher we pick the fucking better. This isn't like 2012."
"Y'all shitty fans. We were winning most of the game and lost in overtime. It was a close game with a good team and we lost. It happens. 

We're a winning team. We will be back. Love y'all."
We played hard and we are still 6-4. Can‚Äôt wait for Thursday! It‚Äôll be a tough game but we will get the win! üíØ
[deleted]
"Y‚Äôall calling for us to tank are wack. Yes, we are playing horribly. But after next week, we have the easiest schedule in the NFL and we are at 6-4.

I will always prefer a playoff game over a mediocre draft pick. Always."

Roman sucks but Lamar isn't doing much better. He absolutely is not becoming the QB we hoped he'd be. I'm sick to death of hearing him say that he needs to be better and then play like a mediocre QB the next game.
Eric Bieniemy for head coach
Same shit different week coulda shoulda woulda blah blah blah. Bunch of pussies today. No clutch gene at all no one has confidence on the team
 The Titans are hoes. On them we shall stunt.

"You could put this loss on a number of things, but for me it was 2nd and 6 on the 10 with a timeout and absolutely refusing to run the football. Kind of sums up the entire season right there."
i‚Äôm checked out on this season. this team has no heart and we can‚Äôt close out games. i love them to death but i don‚Äôt need to watch the last 6 games to know what happens.
"Still gonna make the playoffs, after thanksgiving the schedule is super easy. Jags, Giants, Cowboys and Bengals (without Burrow) is 10 wins and then the Browns who we already beat 38-6.  Hopefully all the bandwagon fans are gone now lets beat Pittsburgh next week"
Has Lamar ever had a game winning drive? Like when we are down by 2-6 points and he drives to score to win?
Makes you appreciate just how special a season like last year was. Still love most of the team but need to go back to the drawing board in almost every phase
Harbough's a baby
3rd place!!!
"Not going to be pessimistic since I‚Äôm at work still and only saw the Andrews TD, but very disappointing. This defense by itself, don‚Äôt even mention Lamar, will never compete with Chiefs or Steelers so gg 2020."
Lamar kept the ball too many times on read options imo
"What really sucks is how little help we‚Äôre getting from the NFC. other than the Cardinals pulling out that miracle play last week the NFC has shit the bed against all the AFC contenders. Maybe GB can hold on today but man, we could use some luck."
F
"The rest of the AFC North looking at the ravens self destructing ""Da Frick they doin over there"""
"I'm as disappointed an demoralized as everyone else but there's some shady fans around here talking about you're checked out for the season and you're not watching any more Ravens gams this year, why? Cause we're not 9-1 were not 8-2 scoring 40 a game? every season ain't smooth sailing but you don't just give up. Fake fans."

"Jackson is exposed now. Just like rg3, Kap, and other running qbs of the past. Only way he can regain his mvp form is if he learns to throw in the pocket."
"Hanging up my jersey. This team was on its heels before this big switch up and now we are out of the playoffs before thanksgiving.. we are a joke and to wear this shit around is embarrassing. We don‚Äôt play defense. We don‚Äôt block. We don‚Äôt do anything productive and this is our coaches fault. Get rid of Harbaugh. The name is shot. Everyone knows how to win against us and we are lame ducks. The refs couldn‚Äôt be unfair and we just straight lost. Three kicks and Justin tucker knew that third kick he didn‚Äôt want to be out there. His talents are wasted in Baltimore when he is kicking under 45 yds. He looked at the goal posted and said real?!?!  Rolled his eyes and put it where no one could take a point away. Not tripping. Our coaches... tripping, our qb, tripping, wide outs and dbs, tripping... beside dez Byran running out the backfield... WTF TROW THE BALL!!! Meanwhile marquise is tripping hard... trade alertzz.  This just in the defense without Campbell is nothing. Us hyping up those thick headed corners and safteys that punch instead of tackling and that‚Äôs why every team talks shit to us and backs it up. They get touchdowns.. we don‚Äôt simple shit.. we should‚Äôve invested in o-line ... nope we go with more defensive help and they don‚Äôt work in general we need more than just a d line maybe a fast safety like Budda.. just saying they get those.. peters used to but they stopped throwing and he‚Äôs been figured out be the other wideouts. Just no good. Can I be a coach. Can I be lamars personal everything man. Sure if I could tell these things to the front office because they obviously don‚Äôt see it and these steeler reporters that don‚Äôt know football keep hiding the real issues with why we get sacked and why we have bad pass attempts or fumbles because pressure. Last week in practice they went outside and couldn‚Äôt preform a simple ladder drill and it was sloppy asf. I say stop buying the player merch and stop following  them  because all it does it make them feel like they are good and obviously we aren‚Äôt. The pats have a better chance at the playoffs rn and I never thought that. Hats off to belicheck"
Half this team deserves to be cut. Do work Eric. Start with Marquise and Peters
Atleast you guys have a good kicker.
Big Trusss
Was never a fan of the Lamar pick but with the success of last year he got me liking that play style. This year however he is loosing us games. If we had Daniel Jones out there we would be 7-3 maybe even 8-2. Our front office has to see this we can‚Äôt give Lamar a 40 million dollar contract.

Marquise Brown didn't catch anything. What's worse than literally 0
Idek. The whole team played really bad when it counted
Whoever is teaching the Ravens how to tackle
Peters. They just fed the ball to whatever receiver he was covering.
[deleted]
Secondary couldn‚Äôt tackle shit
The wr group just sliding under the radar for being non existent the past 5 weeks.
Marlon and Peters. They got beat like fucking drums all game.
There's a LOT of blame but Marcus Peters. He got burned so many freaking times this game it wasn't even funny. Dude got exposed and didn't make a big play to make it worth it.
"**Team loss except Dobbins**

Offense choked on two critical drives and only got 3 points off a turnover. 

Defense forgot how to tackle in the fourth quarter. 

You can blame the coaches, you can blame the secondary, you can blame the QB for two horrid throws, you can blame our stupid WRs for not being able to catch covid at a Trump rally and you can blame the running game for being worthless (except Dobbins, he is cool)"
I am once again asking the Ravens to fire Greg Roman.
"Unbelievable play calls by ***Greg Roman*** once again. 



You have JK Dobbins running like a damn freight train and in the second half its like he was fired. Why is it so hard to figure out how  to remain consistent? When something works we stop doing it."
Greg Roman
"**The entire team, from offense to defense to coaching**"
"Greg Roman. This was an offense that supposedly made adjustments to be better and it was exactly the same. It‚Äôs time for someone new, because we have enough tape to justify ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt beat the good teams‚Äù."
Secondary.
Whole team.
"**Marcus Peters & the entire offense** \- bar JK Dobbins.

&#x200B;

Edit: New offensive identity my fucking ass."
"Marcus Peters 

Patrick Queen

Lamar Jackson

Greg Roman

Don Martindale

John Harbaugh

Take your pick, they've all been fucking horrendous."
"I'm over all of the Greg Roman apologists. He's doing the same thing he did in San Francisco and if he doesn't get out he's going to destroy Lamar's career.
If I'm Gus Edwards, I'm not working on getting a contract to come back to Baltimore next year. Three touches today, is all he got? I'd make it through the season and be looking elsewhere, where I'm going to be used to the best of my ability.
I saw Dobbins get frustrated when he was doing his job and then they pulled him for Ingram. Baltimore is dysfunctional right now and losing today, is time to worry. Because as it stands right now they're going to get bulldozed on Thanksgiving night."
peters. tackling was atrocious and got torched by corey fucking davis
Felt like Romo was calling better plays than Roman
"We are the most unclutch team in the league right now. Whenever we are in a position where we need to score you can guarantee that we won‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not just Lamar, it‚Äôs not just the receivers, it‚Äôs not just the coaching, it‚Äôs not just the secondary, it‚Äôs not just the o line, it‚Äôs not just the linebackers, everyone turns into the fucking falcons."
Sergio Kindle
Secondary. They‚Äôre all more interested in trying to create turnovers instead of tackling.
The entire secondary besides Elliot.
"Look at JK Dobbins and Derrick Henry's stats.

Comparable in every way today except:

Henry got the ball 11 more times, because they understand that he's great and that they win with him.

Stop forcing the ball to these ass receivers. Since Hollywood bitched on twitter he has been TERRIBLE. 

Andrews, Snead, and Dez were the only receivers showing some effort on the field tonight.

The defense was, as expected, completely trash without Calais and Brandon Williams.

I don't have any interest in being pessimistic, but I'll say it again: if those two players don't get back on the field soon, then we're going to get ran all over by every remaining team this season.

Zeke, Chubb, James Robinson, Mixon(if he's back), even Wayne Gallman is about to cut us up."
The answer is heart. We have none. We have no heart
The coaching team
Red zone offense
GREG FUCKING ROMAN
THE SECONDARY had some of the worst tackling I've seen in a long time. Holy shit.
"Mental Errors

These penalties are fucking killing us. Kill any drive we get started. Been ALL season."
Marcus Peters. Dude didn't even try to tackle
"Coaching overall,  complete shit"
Coaching. There was no fucking effort in our tackling all day. It was embarrasing. I will take a fucking loss if you at least okay your best.
The organisation. Top to bottom. Out-coached.
"Coaching & Secondary. Only two RB rushes in the second half & not doing anything to adjust to TEN just moving the ball with ease. If that TEN replacement Center did not fuck up that snap to Henry, we wouldn't even have had a chance to win in OT."
MARCUS PETERS.
"It has to be coaching at this point unfortunately. The team looks completely defeated anytime they face adversity. Play calling and effort are just abysmal on both sides of the ball. A lack of discipline shows up in penalties but also botched plays, players out of position. I'm honestly amazed the team is doing as well as they are playing so poorly at times. The team is missing a heart, that's so very clear now."
"Why did we pay Marcus Peters? He‚Äôs good for turnovers against mediocre receivers, once he‚Äôs lined up with anyone decent he‚Äôs absolute garbage."
Also the refs continue to just be fucking horrendous
Harbaugh. This team had ZERO fire all game. They got manhandled and out coached AGAIN
Coaches. How you even call that deep pass when a field goal realistically WINS YOU THE GAME is beyond comprehension. Roman is an idiot but is Harbaugh really that much better for allowing this shit to happen
"Ravens in the clutch.
It's not as if nobody played bad, secondary couldn't tackle aj brown, offensive play calling stalled out a lot, jackson randomly threw an arm punt for some reason, O-line gave up a big sack late. However despite all of those, the Ravens had this game in their hands, from when they were up 2 scores, to the last drive where they settled, to the overtime drive where they went 3 and out. Fact is great teams win this game and Baltimore didn't. On to Pittsburgh but this one stings like KC loss, a prove it game where the Ravens just didn't."
"Roman!  At the most crucial point of the game, where we needed to protect the ball, move the chains, eat some clock and guarantee at least three points to make it a two score game with less than 10 minutes left, he dials up a deep pass, which is probably the biggest weakness of this offense.  You win in the NFL by playing to your strength and taking the opponents strength away.  Not being able to put the titans down by two scores there was th killer.  The D had already done the best they could to hold the Titans to 13 points in the 4th.  To expect them to keep that up without Campell and BW out was unrealistic.  The O needed to take charge keep the D off the field and find a way to score while eating the clock.  To do otherwise killed us.  This is not on theD and ‚Äúbad Tackling‚Äù. Bad talking is going to happen when you are trying to punch the ball out and cant.  Fire Roman Now!"
"I really don't know who to solely pin blame on this game. There's shit to go around everywhere:

Lamar was not good today by any stretch, and left multiple plays on the field. There were numerous occasions when Dez had a CB 15 yards off of him and Lamar didn't fucking throw him the ball on a quick slant. He also missed several easy throws. However, he had the drive to tie the game where he was masterful.

The defense contained Henry all day long and even gave the offense a turnover with favorable field position, but the defense also allowed 17 4th quarter and OT points to lose us the game and choked SO FUCKING hard. Moreover, Marcus Peters had a fucking awful day in coverage and Patrick Queen is just completely lost on the field in every way.

Hollywood Brown again disappeared today on a day where the Titans' secondary was playing without basically any starters.

I just don't know where to put the blame, so I'll default it to **Greg Roman**. So many times today, I saw the offense have favorable situations just to run a STUPID fucking play and squander it. I also can't blame anyone else for our guys not getting open deep. If you don't have the WR's to separate, SCHEME. THEM. OPEN."
Harbs. This team is flat game after game and always undisciplined. That falls on the coach
Cornerbacks and lamar. Corners gave up too many plays and missed too many tackles. Lamar missed too many passes in big moments.
Refs and Coaching. Same shit every week
Secondary was atrocious.  Tackling was just as bad.  Greg Romans hot and cold play calling.  Lamar Jacksons mental mistakes and picks.   Dline played reasonable for being down its best two interior players but Marlo and Peters played like undrafted players.
lol
"Lamar - can't fucking throw

Coaches (all of them) - not sure what the fuck that defense scheme was.

Marcus - can't fucking tackle and he fell for the same play action like 4 fucking times. No variation. SAME. EXACT. FUCKING. ROUTE."
We can‚Äôt tackle
The entire secondary
Red zone offense
Two huge false starts
**A SOFT TEAM**
defense letting them walk all over them 2nd half
"There isn‚Äôt one person to blame. The offense was bad; the defense was bad, and for the 4th straight time we lost a coin flip game. That‚Äôs the mark of a bad football team."
"Coaching- too many damn penalties. This game was going to be iced essentially, but false starts fucked it up lol"
Marlon and Peters have looked mediocre last 3 games.
"Id say Greg Roman if I wasn't already blaming him every other fucking week

The secondary got beat like a drum today. I get you had to sell out to stop Henry, but the poor tackling and not being anywhere close to assignments was awful. You could sum up our season just off the Brown TD."
Interception late in the third.  We were killing that drive.  Could've walked into 4th quarter with ball and keep milking it.
"I am gonna say John Harbaugh and I will take it a step further...this is what keeps him from being a top tier coach. His teams are always good, but always lack mental toughness since the ray lewis/ed left. I always feel like the team chokes when it matters the most (remember AJ green moments)."
"Secondary. Only one thumper back there, and that's Joker! We try to strip the ball instead of tackling, and it shows week after week."
"Entire team failure minus Derek Wolfe, Snead, Dobbins and Dez Bryant.

Lamar, Queen, Judon, Humphrey, Peters, 5'2"" Hollywood Brown, DJ Fluker, entire team was trash"
"Harbaugh. The team chokes in the big games and has no heart. This comes from the top. 

I think it‚Äôs time to look at a full coaching staff replace."
Either Marcus Peters or Greg Roman but imma go with Peters. Motherfucker getting dusted on some of these plays and had the tackling ability of a JV highschool player
The entire fucking defense
Harbaugh. This doesn't look like a team that believes in themselves. No heart. That's coaching.
"Phone the rest of this season in (if they weren‚Äôt already doing that) spam interior OL in the draft, and go try to sign a WR who is a fucking adult because 25 years of history shows you CLEARLY just can‚Äôt draft or develop them."
Everyone but Wolfe and Dobbins
*peters*
"Eric Decosta. Lamar and the receivers were horrible for sure but at the end of the day this is a team that's spending $125 million on defense and $56 million on offense. And that dogshit defense at the end of the game is the result. I don't care how many players are injured, it's just unacceptable for the defense to be THIS bad when it counts, and if it is, you might as well throw together a defense full of cheap veterans and rookies and actually give your franchise QB a half decent supporting cast."
"Whoever decided a long pass was ideal in a 1st and 10 situation. I'm pretty sure there's something in the ""Football 101"" book about basic play calling. That pick doesn't happen, Tucker's FG is a game winning FG at worst."
I blame that post on the Steelers sub. This is definitely a cosmic punishment worthy of the crime.
"Everyone. The team feels like it has no heart.

I feel like we sold out gameplan for flashy moves. Corners refuse to play press coverage because they are trying to be 10 yds off to read and jump routes. The O-line gets beat weekly like they get a bonus for losing inches. Coaches abandon the run when it is working to try to give LBJ throwing yards.

Everything needs reworked from the ground up."
Everyone but Dobbins
"Coaches.

  Penalties have cost us 3 games this season.  Poor. Poor. Coaching. üí©"
The Yannick Ngakoue curse is real
Lamar Jackson. Greg Roman isn‚Äôt the one missing easy throws. Stop making excuses for him
Fucking secondary and Lamar. Front 7 and Dobbins did enough to win this game in regulation.
Harbaugh has had the same problems for years I really don‚Äôt give two shits about our record without him gone we‚Äôre gonna get out coached plain and simple
Lamar Jackson. At some point you have to stop making excuses and start making plays to win games. He isn't right now.
"I'm just upvoting everyones suggestions tbh, complete team failure"
Lamar Jackson.  Missed too many throws.
Lamar. Everyone blaming Roman but he‚Äôs not under center.
Lamar looks like a college player
If you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs Patrick Queen you have something wrong with your head.
Lamar
This is on the offense... namely Lamar.... d bottled up Henry as long as they could..... had a chance in overtime and did nothing... again
Whole team except special teams
Penalties
Defense
PAIN
"Defensive backs

Can't tackle, can't cover to save their fucking lives

Also Greg Roman needs to be fired yesterday"
Whole org members not named Dobbins or Tucker
Entire defense
I'm going to say this in every thread until he's gone. FIRE GREG ROMAN. WE DONT NEED TO RUN IT UP THE MIDDLE EVERY 1ST FUCKING DOWN.
Marcus Peters
Coaching.
"Secondary

Spent the whole game trying to strip the ball and instead gave up play after play."
Every. Fucking. Body.
"**The whole defense**.   Can't pay them this much, trade for players and still can't win the game when you are on the field"
Whole Secondary. This one not on lamar
"Secondary. Literally just the secondary. Chuck Clark couldn't cover fucking shit, Marcus Peters decided to play like a fucking amateur, AJ Brown cut through them like a wet towel. Jesus fucking christ, best practice of the season my ass, this team doesn't deserve shit right now."
"where to start? im gonna say tackling, secondary, play calls, LJ, hollywood, and queen"
The whole team
Coaching staff was abysmal today
"The Defense. Let the Titans drive 80+ yards at the end of the 4th, couldn‚Äôt tackle Brown, gave up the game winner to Henry in OT"
Marcus Peters. He was in coverage on so many chunk plays in the 4th quarter.
Whole team
Receivers and defense.
The entire fucking team
Shits embarrassing
"Everyone but JK Dobbins

Complete ass out on that field today.

Fire Greg Roman, tell Harbs his fucking job is on the line, and get these players disciplined.

So tired of wasting my time on a team that doesn't even fucking TRY to win games."
me for believing that we could be competent
Tackling
What is tackling? Is that a new thing?
My fault. I wore this lamar mvp shirt I got from my uncle. Last time I wore it was when I was at the playoff game in January.
The Baltimore Ravens
"OFFENSIVE LINE is my vote every game we lose. It wasn't good at the start of the year and the Stanley and Phillips injuries have sunk the season.

That being said we win if the REFS don't invent a RTP on McPhee to put the Titans back in the game.

The defense did a good job on Henry through 3 quarters but the INJURIES to Campbell and B-Willy came back to bite us at the end."
every single aspect of the team
Everybody
 Marcus peters & Greg
Greg Roman
Secondary that cant tackle for shit. It will be DEFCON 5 if we lose 3 in a row to the fucking Steelers on Thanksgiving
The entire team and coaching staff shit the bed at various points today.
The bad 3rd and 1 spot that was an obvious first down.
"Greg Roman, the Secondary, Mekari, Queen, Lamar, Harbaugh.

This team has a worse record than the Browns. LMAO"
The Ravens
"*The Secondary*

We held Henry to a not terrible amount and we got burned by Tannehill.

Honorable mention: *Hollywood* (what's the point of having Souljas if they can't fucking catch?)"
"The fucking defense. Just a refusal to tackle, and the secondary was letting everything get caught. Unbelievable"
"Team blame.

Welcome to third place.  

Tucker was good."
"It‚Äôs hard to put it on the D when they are missing Campbell and Williams, but the secondary looked like hell on the coverage and downfield tackling. So them."
The front office. I can‚Äôt imagine investing high draft picks and free agent signing into a defense that allows 90-yard TD drives.
Peters
"Who were the players who failed to tackle Brown on 3rd and 10? Clark, Peters and Queen? All of those guys."
"**Everyone but special teams**

Tackles are not a skill this defense has even heard of, play calling has gone from uninspired to non-existent, our secondary refuses to even attempt to break up passes, the same receivers are making the same catches back to back, Lamar is dropping back 10 yards before throwing 10 yard checkdowns, receivers still forgetting how to play football, and worst of all, dumb fuck penalties always popping up at literally the worst possible moments every single game. No lessons are being learned; we are still making the *exact* same mistakes we were making in September. Everyone is adjusting to our gameplay except us."
Did hollywood even have a catch today?
"Seriously what the fuck do you say to this game, you were up 11 points. Had them on the ropes, making it look like that they had overcome the last playoff game, only to shit the bed like that in the end. Just disgusting, someone gotta be talking in the locker room after this. It's just no acceptable, you can't perform like this."
"Front office.  This roster has more weaknesses than strengths.   Many position groups have a weak link, and not every position group has a strong link.   The plan to replace Yanda is failing.   Tavon Young was clearly an IR hero type guy before we extended him.  Today we learned that our WR group is more disappointments than secret weapons"
Secondary. Game should have been over but four guys missed tackles on AJ Brown and let him score a TD the Titans had no business scoring.
"Gentlemen it's time to accept the fact that this is a very mediocre football team as it stands.  As far as the blame, I would say at this point there are simply too many to list."
"Whole team

Too many penalties - again
Secondary couldn't tackle against the Titans - again
Defensive failures in a clutch moment - again
Roman taking Dobbins in and out..."
Secondary
The center for snapping the ball before dez was in spot marquise could have gotten a td or at least the first down
Entire Team coaches on down
"Patrick Queen got pushed around on every single play, you could grab a street FA to fill gaps better"
"Love me Lamar, but he‚Äôs been making some bad decisions and forcing to Hollywood."
"# Defense.

Tackling, or lack there of, specifically. I get that Derrick Henry is near-impossible to tackle and take it with a grain of salt when it's against him, but holy shit, they couldn't even tackle receivers."
"Honestly there's no one o blame. We aren't that good. It's that simple. If we don't make he playoffs this year I won't we mad. Lets get a good draft pick and tighten this up. Shed bad vet contracts and build a solid team. I still love the team but lets adjust our expectations.

We have no fight in us and we aren't very discipline,."
The whole organization at this point. Wtf.
Everyone except Dobbins and of course Tucker
"Everybody, specially the coaching staff."
"The Baltimore Ravens. The whole organization. From drafting another bust at WR, to messing with the oline line up in the game. Defense not tackling. Offensive game execution. Everyone associated with the Ravens except the wolf pack."
I gotta say secondary and patrick Queen.
"Literally the entire team but dobbins. Defense? Ate shit when it mattered most. WR‚Äôs? Non existent as usual. O line? Hella sus at times but not as bad as the D. Lamar? Another ‚Äúmeh‚Äù game but missing on some of those throws really fucking hurt.

Don‚Äôt get me started on the coaches."
Whole team and whole staff. Special shout-out to our well paid secondary
interception to start the second half change the entire momentum.  A strong drive there up 21-10 would of made it harder for the Titans.
Derrick Henry
The Ravens Organization
Tackling and offensive playcalling
"It was inexcusable how awful the defense tackled today, but the offense was especially terrible with an 11 point lead. The amount of unforced errors/penalties they continue to make is not a good reflection on the coaching."
"Defense, mainly DBs, and Roman (crappy playcalls and taking Dobbins out while he‚Äôs hot)

Anyone saying Lamar is full of it this week.  He had a couple bad throws but he has no one able to really contest catches."
Who even cares anymore
Everyone to be honest.
"It has to be Greg Roman. Lamar had a number of excellent throws today including a TD. The pass to Duvernay was questionable but he made a bum effort imo.

That screen pass on 3rd and 16 in OT after winning the toss was mind blowing. You can‚Äôt stop Henry and you know it - so you basically give up in your own territory in OT. Unbelievable. And this is after dialing up stupid bombs all game, but don‚Äôt do it when you actually have to.

Second after Roman has to be Peters/Humphrey. They got burnt by Brown all fucking game."
Bro they made Lamar run a screen play on 3 and 17 like wtf
"The whole team:

CBs: Couldn't cover at all.  On Brown's OT catch Humphrey was 5 yards behind him.

Roman/RB coach: ran twice in the second half with a two score lead.  Took a deep shot with an 11 point lead.  Took out Dobbins as he was owning the game.

Lamar: Missed some big throws, made some big ones too.

Wink:  Sold out on blitzes far too much to cover for an injured DL.

LBs: some pretty terrible coverage of the TEs, second half tackling.

Special teams:  fake punt...

Harbaugh:  This team can't win close games if your players are going to be that undisciplined with penalties.

When you lose a close game you probably did a lot right, and they did, but they also didn't do anything exceptionally well.  The big thing I noticed is the Ravens could never get momentum."
"Greg Roman, I just can‚Äôt. I want a big 6‚Äô4 receiver. JK is taking over as RB1 and they ditched the run in the second half. Duvernay stopped running a route that Led to a pick"
Everyone lmao
"Peters, Queen, and Hollywood."
"Team loss = John Harbaugh. We're finding new ways to lose now and I'm not seeing what coach is doing to fix it. Penalties, bad play calling, boneheaded mistakes are all on the HC."
"Offence turned it over on the arm punt and then could only score 3 again. It was a total momentum killer and then the defence could not stop them. Defence played a good game but were too gassed to keep stopping them. It was just a sad performance all around and we probably win that game if we had one of Campbell or Williams - like the KC and PIT games, just needed one or two more plays to go our way."
"Defense - no sacks, terrible DB coverage. Felt like we were playing behind in Q4 even when we led."
Team loss
secondary
"Secondary

Wink‚Äôs scheming

Roman‚Äôs scheming

Brown

But overall - another 100+ yards in penalties including another batch of illegal formation and false starts that killed drives, potentially to win at the end. This is now squarely on Harbs‚Äô shoulders. We are top-3 in penalties in the league and are lucky we didn‚Äôt lose a few other games due to penalties."
Hard to say... o-line? D-line? No idea
Defense
John Harbaugh. We stunk today.
"Execution when it matters. 

Whether it's tackling, getting lined up, knowing the plays, the Ravens have simply just been sloppy when they can't afford to be. False start on a 3rd and 1 QB sneak. Early snap on a screen that would have been an easy go ahead touchdown. 3 defenders unable to tackle on a 3rd and 10. A sack on 2nd down in overtime, just a to name a few instances throughout this game alone. It can be seen in the past few games too.

People like to blame the coaches/coordinators, and rightfully so. The second half adjustments were not there this game. But honestly I think it's more of the players simply not executing when it matters. I don't know whether it's inexperience, or jitters or whatever. 

And to pile it on, we're having an injury bug at the worse possible point in the season, and it's showing. Hopefully we can get healthy after this Steelers game. I have no hope for that game, but if we can string together a nice streak after that, we could be looking at sneaking into the playoffs. But that's being optimistic."
Wink Martindale. He had 10 months to figure out how to not lose like we just did.
Is there a tackling coach? That guy.
Peters for sure
"Coaches. Whoever in charge of developing WR‚Äôs suck. Or maybe it‚Äôs the scouts idk. 

Lamar has been a little off but he‚Äôs the franchise QB and EDC should invest in some weapons."
"John Harbaugh. If you can‚Äôt figure out a way to make this talented-ass team win, then you deserve a 9-7, just-missed-the-playoffs type outcome."
Greg Roman needs to hit bricks
Patrick Queen
Can we give Harbs some blame. How many roughing the passers have we had like wtf it‚Äôs a guarantee every week we extend drives like that. Not to mention the many stupid ass penalties.
Greg Roman
On a good note. We know we can give Hollywood Browns snaps to Dez Bryant. He has produced way more in 1 game today than Hollywood has produced in a few this season
Marcus Peters. He can barely cover and was bitched out on any of his tackle attempts. The front 7 did a relatively good job at stopping Henry. How the hell does Peters claim to be a all pro corner when Corey Davis breaks a 100 yards on you.
**whoever tf tried to tackle AJ brown and didn't stick it**
Reminder that this marks the 4th distinct time that Matt Skura has absolutely choked in a critical moment. Honestly bench him for somebody who doesn‚Äôt directly fuck at least one drive per game.
"The secondary. I love me Fruitpunch and JU-iceman, but seemed like they were not present."
Roman get him the fuck out of baltimore
"The entire god dang secondary. If you had told me before the game with no Brandon Williams and Calais Campbell that Derick Henry would only (hah) rush for 133 yards I would be like sign me up!! Secondary was absolutely horrendous. Peters, Humphrey, Clark, Elliot. Every Titans receiver was always wide open. Think Jimmy Smith had an okay game but man - ‚Äúbest secondary‚Äù in the league had an awful game"
I blame covid and the lack of fans. And of course Roman. And peters and Humphrey. And injuries
"Can we go with everybody but special teams again? Tucker didn‚Äôt miss, Koch and Cox were their usual selves, and our coverage was good with a few great hits from Justice Hill"
"I love Lamar and want to see him with better WRs, but let‚Äôs be honest...he struggles to make passes that other QBs make look easy. It‚Äôs why he struggles to pass for over 200 yards consistently when guys like Justin Herbert are doing it every week. Lamar‚Äôs passes often sail over the WRs head when they‚Äôre open. I don‚Äôt wanna attack dude too hard because he‚Äôs not being given a ton of help. I blame this on the FO that refuses to spend money on the WR core and dumps cash into a defense that looks overrated every week with players that get beat more often than not. It‚Äôs a coaching issue as much as it is a player execution issue. It‚Äôs not JUST the players and it‚Äôs not JUST the coaches. It‚Äôs a team collapse."
"Offense: Lamar - horrendous throws to wide open players. Mark Andrews in particular. 
WRs - miscommunication on routes (Duvernay but the boy is a stud and will learn. Chalked up to rookie mistake) and dropped passes (Soulja Brown) 
Greg Roman: Just when you think he committed to J.K. he was like hahahaha JK motha fuckas! 

Defense: Entire Defense that thought they were playing flag football 

Blame: Entire Team"
"The entire team gets the blame for lack of heart. We are missing that, ""hell ya coach let's go for it!"" on both sides of the ball this year. The fact the Titans came in to our house and disrespected our shield and Harbaugh was the only one to get in their face about it shows everything about this team right now."
"And the nominees for the blamey are...

1. The Secondary for obvious reasons
2. Hollywood Brown for doing nothing
3. Greg Roman/ Wink Martindale for the weekly crap on coordinators
4. The team's spirit not being there (My Vote)"
The defense but I'd say **Marcus Peters and Marlon Humphrey** in particular.
"is it me or do a lot of the defensive players not try to tackle anymore they just try to strip the ball, even if it means giving up an extra 5 yards in the process"
Peters and Hollywood are the only ones I can say for sure did not do their job. Nobody had a great game but I feel everyone else played well enough to get us a W
Lamar Jackson. He is leaving too many points on the board by missing wide open receivers and he will not last long in the NFL if he can't correct it.
Everyone. They all fucking suck except Tucker.
Every fucking one except Dobbins and Tucker
Lamar and coaching once again. Bad decisions and bad throws at the worst times. When it feels like we have the game in the bag we always pull out the red carpet for them with stupid ass shit. Defense too but it didnt have to come to that in the first place
"In torn between Lamar, Andrews (might not have made that many mistakes but the few he made did hurt a fuck ton) and our secondary..."
"Roman - The offensive play calling is way too predictable. The option plays aren't tricking anyone, and were designing passes for deep open receivers. Give the ball to your players and run the fucking ball more!"
Greg Roman needs to be gone. You can‚Äôt look at a 21-10 lead as something you can sit on the ball for 25 minutes and still win.
"Marcus peters is a joke player.  Should nicknamed 50 Percent.  Seriously, dude doesn't try.  Play 15 yards off, let them catch it, and then let them run by because he doesn't like tackling."
"Can we fire Roman and cut (or bench) Ingram, Hill, & Hollywood?"
"Greg Roman. 

How do you not grind away a 4th quarter lead on the ground with your RB that has been extremely effective all game."
"I have been a lifelong fan ( the team is a year younger than me lol), but this year is even more frustrating than post '12 and even kyle boller years. Injuries are absolutely no excuse and I hate that excuse. The steelers are consistently a good team even with injuries, i.e., last year. The raiders have tons of injuries and are getting better as the season progresses!. Injuries are no excuse, and I hate to say it, but I think it is finally time to look at harbaugh. Maybe Ed Reed and some past players were right about Harbaugh after all, that he is just a players coach. Harbaughs only good teams, when he did not have 3 HOF defenders on his team, were last season and maybe 2015. Just think for a second, picture this young ravens team with a coach like Reid, Tomlin, MCvay, Gruden, shit I would even say vrabel. I think you would see the appropriate changes being made. Most coaches dream of a talented team like the ravens have. Sorry for the long post, but as a life long fan of this team, It's just frustrating to see the fucking legendary talent we have had in this franchise, but we can never do anything with it. Harbaugh, bellichick, tomlin, carroll, payton, are all longest tenured Head coaches, now you cannot honestly tell me Harbaugh deserves that more than any of those other coaches, besides maybe payton."
"Lamar. Huge interception and some overthrows, just not getting it done when he needed to"
Hands down Lamar Jackson is the reason we lost. Had four drives in a row he could have ended the game with a td and didn‚Äôt. Hopefully ravens FO is realizing we can‚Äôt sign this guy to a 40 million dollar deal. He is loosing games for us.
Greg roman
"We were leading until our defense got drained. I blame Roman and offense play calling. We keep the offense on the field longer, we win this."
"Roman, Hollywood and Lamar in that order"
I‚Äôm sick of Harbaughs stale ass messages already...get him tf out already we literally choke in every big game
It‚Äôs time...John needs to go. I‚Äôm sick of this choir boy bullshit
John Harbaugh - this is on him
Greg Roman.
Greg mother fucking Roman
"Greg Roman, predictable and terrible play calling in big spots. Missing Calais and B Will did not help"
**Greg Roman**
Greg Roman and Marcus Peters
How about mark Andrews‚Äô stupid 1-hand attempt at a catch
"I made a post right after the loss to Titans last year saying Lamar has been figured out and our OC sucks and we rely on Hollywood and Andrews too much and all you cry babies got mad. Well, looks like I'm still right. Bench Lamar and get better receivers cause we suck right now. We are 6-4 with Dolphins and Cardinals. I mean, we went from 14,2 to 6-4 already? I love the team but horrible choices and overrated players."

"What else is new? I‚Äôve given up emotionally this year and it‚Äôs more enjoyable. They‚Äôre still a great team to watch but man oh man, don‚Äôt get invested. 

Big changes need to come this off season. Terrible showing this season."
"Just goes to show, we really blew it last January.

I think of everything that went right last year: no major injuries, tons of momentum, the SWAGGER.

Let‚Äôs pack it in, get a high 1st round pick WR off the board, draft some o-line help, and shake up the coaching staff for next year. It‚Äôs up to Bisciotti and EDC now."
We gon cry this one out together fam!
playoffs are seriously doubtful this year. I'm not expecting them to win enough games to get wild card.
Not even angry... Just sad.
I'm gonna need a whole lot of liquor on Thanksgiving if we play like this again.

This team is going nowhere this season. Just another disappointment for 2020.

[deleted]
"Fairweather fans don't come on to forums to talk about the team. We deserve criticism because we aren't winning. While we did well to stop Henry today (until the last play), the cost of that was their WRs feasting. Right now we have too many injuries and generally bad players on the O-line to be a good team. We are headed for 10-6 or 9-7."
Is this sarcastic or are you stupid? Lol because there is nothing wrong with criticizing our team we have holes we need to fill but the people saying out season is doomed are the bandwagons.
Is this sarcasm
Is this sarcastic? Everyone can see there is room for improvement.
Ive been a fan for 15 years and always will no matter what but this was embarrassing today we gave the game away dumb penalties on 3rd and long flase start on qb sneak 3 and out in OT we did everything possible to lose
"This is a trash take.  My god can we stop acting like someone is fair weather for watching their team struggle and being disappointed?  Should we bury our head and act like it isn‚Äôt happening?  

We are not playing well.  I have been watching since 1996, and have seen worse, but that doesn‚Äôt seem excuse poor play now"
You also can say people are dumb for not seeing the sarcasm as it was not at all clear nor did you use the /s/ flag.  It is often impossible to determine tone from written language
Are you on crack?
"Nobody needs this sarcastic bullshit rn.

Shut. The. Fuck. Up."
I'm pretty disappointed in Marquise Brown. He had 0 Yards this game and is our number one receiver...
Tweeting takes a lot of energy out of your hands.
"Reminder: Hollywood Brown was drafted *before* AJ Brown. I don't think Hollywood is bad, but Tweeting about his lack of usage while completely fucking disappearing really pisses me the fuck off. Fuck you, soulja."
What's the point of having souljas if they never catch (never!)
I hope we don't pick up his 5th year option. This dude bulked up in the offseason and somehow got worse
Andrews is our #1 receiver by far what are you talking about? Then probably Snead.
To this day I will keep saying the ravens should‚Äôve taken AJ Brown or DK with their pick. Or at least used a later pick for DK
What‚Äôs the point of having Souljas if they can‚Äôt catch
Crazy. He tweets about not being used and drops wide open passes. I hate to say it. But we may have drafted another bust
He better not cry about getting passes anymore. I wish we had drafted AJ Brown or DK Metcalf. This dude Hollywood isn't a #1 receiver.
Apparently posting Instagrams playing catch in your back yard is a lot easier than actually catching a ball in an NFL game
He sucks hes a number 2 at best
"Decosta deserves way  more heat than he is getting, specifically for this pick. He thought hollywood was tyreek hill but he definitely is not even close. Cant fathom looking at hollywood and then at metcalf and taking hollywood. I know metcalf had injury history but so did hollywood. Monumental wiff as of right now."
BUST
"Hollywood is a good player, he just isn't a fit for how this offense is being run"
Sunday.. trade him for a 5th
"He‚Äôs just not a WR 1 and that‚Äôs okay. We need an alpha on the outside. Luckily, this 2021 draft is loaded with WR talent. It love to see Seth Williams out of Auburn come in."
"He shouldn‚Äôt even be a #1, the man wasn‚Äôt even #1 at Oklahoma but yet we took him off the board as if we had a #1 to pair him with. Our problem at drafting WRs should be pretty clear at this point, we‚Äôll want one of if not the fastest guy in the draft regardless of actual intangibles to go along with it"
"I think Greg is partially at fault also. Hollywood is a 4.3 reciever, and he didn‚Äôt magically get slower. I‚Äôm sure some plays could be drawn up that utilize his speed."
Think he needs to stick to being a twitch streamer
He fucking sucks. I mean...I don‚Äôt really have takes besides that. you watch him and you just get the sense that he is no feel for the game.
"When Brown said the Souljas comment, he wasn't just talking about himself. Y'all loved Snead getting targets last week, y'all love when Duvernay gets more targets, y'all love when Dobbins gets all these carries but y'all still think he was ""talking shit"". Like this is exactly what he was talking about FEED THE PLAYERS THAT MAKE PLAYS. He was telling the coaches EXACTLY what we've  been saying and y'all niggas hate him for it because he had a couple rough games. Tell me how that makes sense?"
Cut him fr
He should be inactive on Thursday
Everytime we lose its dont over react this dont overreact that. Can we now 6-4 outside the playoffs 3rd in the division blew a 21-10 lead. I think its time to panic. Someone please tell me why i should overreact i beg you because this fucking sucks
"It's almost like we need /u/baltimoreravens to tell Greg Roman to fuck off, or tell Harbaugh/Bisciotti he needs to fire him"
"Hey, kids, listen for a sec. The second most important player on our entire team, after Lamar, is Ronnie Stanley. When Brown has to slide across and we start activating scrapheap guys, \*that will cost us games.\* When Boyle goes down, leaving us with one professional TE, we and our TE-heavy system will \*struggle on offense\*.

The offense will look bad with the OL so badly disrupted and without Boyle. It just will.

On defense, without BWill and Campbell - the anchors, and the best two players on the line - our defensive front is weak, meaning LB's will be more in the box, which means the CBs will be more exposed.

Go ahead and panic, if you want, but if you thought we wouldn't feel the pain of all the injuries today, you were wrong."
"We aren‚Äôt a fucking playoff team man were mediocre as hell. Defense gets absolutely shredded when it matters and gives up an 11 point lead, and offense can‚Äôt do shit when it really counts ever. The offense just looks ridiculously uncreative nobody‚Äôs ever open. The only completions come off ridiculous lamar throws, we don‚Äôt ever have easy shit like the tits had for tannehill. Jk was good but fuck this run for 1 yard on 1st down shit. Ik people are gonna say ‚Äúbe positive you‚Äôre not a true fan‚Äù but we‚Äôre literally going nowhere until we fire roman. These losses don‚Äôt even hurt me anymore the second we went 3 and out up 5 I knew we were losing cuz the offense fucking sucks ass"
No it‚Äôs well past time to overreact. These issues are on film every week. Those motherfuckers who were so happy that we were 6-2 failed to see the forest here. We are not great at any positional group outside of qb and even that is looking iffy. It‚Äôs time for wholesale changes.
"Changes need to be made ASAP, not sure if it‚Äôs Roman or harbaugh at this point... season was over when Stanley went on IR but that effort level in the second half from the defense was an absolute joke"
"This one stung, hate to see the blown lead and I really can‚Äôt stand the Titans.

But if you‚Äôre really looking for a bright side, our last 5 games are all ‚Äúshould-win‚Äù games. So we could even potentially drop one Thursday to the Steelers and finish 11-5.  

WE ALL WANT BETTER THAN THAT AND WE SHOULD‚ÄôVE WON TODAY, just so I‚Äôm clear. But we finish off with: Cowboys, Browns, Jags, Giants, Bengals"
You've got some mad recency bias.  Overreact if you must but as a long-time Ravens fan I'm in my natural habitat
"Anyone that says you can't react art any point is being dumb. This sub is hyper sensitive to Lamar criticism so it boils over to any criticism. 

The reality is that we aren't a good team at this point. To many injuries and too little imagination from coaching staff."
Lamar doesn't look good enough honestly.
"Dudes danced on our logo then beat us in our house because we couldn't finish. This ain't the year lmao. Take this L of a season and grow from it. Also I don't wanna hear SHIT about our winning record! Got dick slapped by the Chiefs, couldn't close vs the Steelers or the Titans, lost to the worst patriots team I've seen since I had a cognitive memory, then beat a bunch of bums."
ball so soft university smh
"I don't understand why we don't just run the damn ball.

We stacked the team with rushing threats for a reason. We have 3 bona fide stud running backs in Ingram, Dobbins, and Bradley. Justice Hill is no slouch either. We have a WR in Duvernay that kills it in sweep runs. And our QB is ridiculously dangerous running the ball. Yet today we call 50/50 toss ups to a 5'9"" WR that should be running slants and crossing routes and dialing up long pass plays that don't have time to develop behind a banged up O-line when we're ""protecting a lead"" in the second half. We do the same thing when we go down early in a game. I love Lamar but he isn't Peyton Manning and Hollywood isn't Randy Moss and that's not how the Baltimore Ravens win football games.

Run. The. Damn. Ball."
"It's literally roman's fault. And out defense needs an on field leader bc 44/24 clearly aren't cutting it in the secondary. 


Aaaah so desperately frustrating"
"This is just Baltimore getting back to what they do best, letting us down every week and continuing to find new ways to be an embarrassment. Really thought we turned a corner last season. Nope."
I‚Äôd rather be hopeful and look forward to ravens games then just fucking hate my life every Sunday so I‚Äôm not gunna overreact. Plus anything can happen if you make it to the playoffs just look at 2012. We were shit then too and we still pulled it off.
"Logical fans have known for two months that this team is not good. It's the ones who have the purple glasses on who thought we'd be 13-3 this year. Every time someone would try to say how bad the team was, they would be destroyed on here for ""not being a fan."""
"I may be in the minority here, but I have always thought harbaugh has sucked at clock management, and in particular, managing timeouts. He wastes challenges on plays we won't win all the time. Today was the most amazing installment though: challenge a play, lose a timeout, false start, incomplete pass, punt.  That shows me a lot about how he approaches the game as a coach and how unprepared the team is mentally. 

Overall though, it's not a one person problem. Getting rid of harbaugh, or Roman, or any other one person won't fix what has become a systemic problem of a lack of discipline and focus. Maybe that starts and ends with the head coach, maybe not."
I think that the team we saw today would be lucky to finish .500 on the season. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs an overreaction or not but I genuinely don‚Äôt know if they will win more than two more.
FIRE GREG ROMAN NOW!  We get in a deficit and can't ever come back. I know we don't have Williams or Campbell but we're better then this. Plus the stupid penalties kill us every game
Fire Roman. Get rid of Soulja Boy. Attempt to get some better WR‚Äôs.
The NFL schedule give you plenty of chances to redeem yourself.  It's even more so this year with 7 playoff spots per conference.
Because now it's not overreacting it's reacting over reacting would be staying we have no chance reacting is knowing it's a long shot but still putting your trust in the team it's a longshot for us to make the playoffs but I believe this team can win if some major changes are made
"Seeing multiple plays where, even with a decimated line, Lamar has upwards of 3 seconds to throw, and NOBODY is open is indicative of how atrocious the play calling is. 

If your receivers can‚Äôt create space on their own, it‚Äôs your job as offensive coordinator to call plays to get them open. Time and time again, Roman fails to do this. It‚Äôs ridiculous"
"No because it isn‚Äôt a overreaction. It wasn‚Äôt an overreaction last week either. We‚Äôre dropping easily winnable games and it has affected our playoff chances drastically. We‚Äôve got a few tough games coming up and tbh we‚Äôll be lucky if we win any of them.

Our playoff chances are fading fast and have been for a couple weeks now."
"I don't know but it seems week after week we are getting out coached. Both sides of the ball, that's a head coach problem."
Yes you can.  Just know that you were still annoying when you overreacted three weeks ago
"In 2006 the New Orleans Saints finished 10-6, got the 2 seed in the NFC playoffs, and got all the way to the conference title game (where they promptly got blown out). They then failed to make the postseason for the next two years (didn't even have a winning season either year). They then went on to win the Super Bowl in 2009. Eleven years later, I think things turned out ok for them. 

The point is, we don't know how these things will unfold. I'm sure there were people panicking in 2005 or 2007 when we had down years, but we made it out just fine. Best to take a zen-like approach to these thing and accept them for what they are. Yes, we're all disappointed that they didn't win today, and yes, things are looking grim for a playoff spot if we don't start taking care of business, but the story of this year, and this franchise isn't over. Let's see how things play out."
"with the jags,giants,cowboys, and Bengals on our schedule i still see us making 10-11 wins on the season and i had us at 11-5 or 12-4 for the season at the start, that being said we don't look like a good football team and i can't see us doing much of anything if we manage the playoffs"
I'm kinda new to football but does this now mean we cant go to the playoffs no matter what?
That's what happens when your WR core is full of midgets and your oline sucks .
Just wrecked by injuries but some changes need to be made on offense like accepting that Hollywood might be the fourth of fifth best receiving option on the team and get more snaps to Dez Snead and duvernay
I think so
"Even if we luck out, fire Roman and get a good Offensive coordinator, he'll just be stolen by another team looking for a head coach. This will happen as long as Harbaugh is here. With a coach that doesn't have a system we will ALWAYS need to get lucky with both the offensive coordinator AND defensive coordinator."
"We can react or we can just take it one day at a time. I'm not happy about this game, either. Dobbins is the only one who showed up with actual desire to play. Let's see what happens on Thursday, seasons can change very quickly"
"After the steelers the ravens play five games.  The opponents include:

The worst defense in the league (Dallas)

The second worst defense in the league (Jax)

The 24th worst defense in the league (Bengals)

The 20th worst defense in the league (Cle)"
If that‚Äôs what makes you happy then go for it
Once we lose this Thursday the season will be over because making the wild card will be almost impossible without significant help from other teams.
i think it's fair to say it's ok to panic
"It‚Äôs not overreacting any more, we‚Äôre outside looking in to the playoffs right now after 11 weeks and playing undefeated Steelers on short rest. This team is in trouble."
I'm not overreacting. We lost to some really good teams and by just one score.
"I‚Äôm pretty sick of the people saying we‚Äôre over reacting and bringing up the 2012 season as if our team is anything like the 2012 team lol. Idk, I love this team but we just aren‚Äôt cutting it this year and we have major problems that CONTINUE to make themselves known. I don‚Äôt get the people who basically say that it doesn‚Äôt matter and to just be glad we‚Äôre still going positive"
I think the time to start worrying is coming. I don't know if I believe in the Ravens making the playoffs or not but I do know I am open to the idea of starting to worry.
"Honestly I‚Äôm just really glad that no matter how bad my mentality can be, it won‚Äôt really affect the team. I can say ‚Äúravens bad‚Äù all I want, but I‚Äôm not in the drivers seat"
"Let me understand your rant,
The same offense that had Jackson an MVP is now trash because Jackson can‚Äôt read a defense? Because Jackson isn‚Äôt accurate?

Perhaps there is a long view by the coaching staff to work Jackson through bumps in his game?
After all the online has not done a good job blocking all season, losing two pro bowl linemen has been tough. Defenses don‚Äôt need to blitz to be all over Jackson this year."
Don‚Äôt overreact ever because it‚Äôs a damn game
"6-4 through 10 games is miles better than 4-6. 
6 more games left..let the season finish. Never forget the giants beating the pats in 2008/2012 ...

Reg season records for giants in both of those years?

10-6 and 9-7

LFG.

It takes failure to find the path of a champion."
There shouln't be an overreaction if you adjust expectations accordingly. This didn't look like a Super Bowl team after Week 3 and subsequent performances and injuries have only confirmed that. Performances need to improve and coaching will be addressed in the off-season but I'm just going to enjoy the ride at this point.
"Yes and no.

Yes bc the offense still hasn't formed a consistent identity. Andrews with 7 targets, Brown with 3, Dez with 5, Snead with 7. Dobbins had 17 touches while Gus and Ingram had 5 carries.

Yes bc it's clear that Andrews is our only respectable skill player. Brown has been so disappointing this year. Boykins didn't see a target yesterday.

No bc we finally saw Lamar take a few more deep shots. This needs to keep happening!

No bc we're missing Campbell and Williams against the worst possible team to miss them. Even then, the run defense did well despite this.

No bc the oline wasn't that bad despite all the changes and injuries.

This offense is still a mess and the defense was missing its two most important players. The good news is that this the type of team that can get hot for 4 games in the playoffs."
"Giants fan with minimal bias here:

Lamar is not a big-time qb.  He's good enough to get you wins against bad teams but he will always choke in high pressure situations, and he relies on his athleticism rather than his brain and arm to get yards.  He is RG3 if RG3 hadn't exploded his knee."
The reason you shouldn't panic is because we have a slim chance to make it to the play offs and zero chance to win once we get there. It's pointless to panic. This is what we will be as long as Harbaugh is the head coach...a little better than average.
"No, because it's a game"
[deleted]
I don‚Äôt feel like he was bad this game or last game tbh
"I swear it‚Äôs like we find a new way to lose these past few weeks. Something is off with this year‚Äôs group. Last year we were so efficient in the red zone and our offense could be counted on to finish games. Idk if it‚Äôs confidence, scheme or what but this team needs a lot to change. And as much as I love Lamar he‚Äôs gotta stop with the bad turnovers."
Haven't had good play calling since Kubiak.
"We had an identity on offense last year: Smashmouth football, and then hit em with playaction.  This year we tried to turn LJ into a pocket passer! Not working! If it wasn't broke, why mess with it?
On defense, too many injuries, and a bunch of 1st yr starters and players in their 1st year with this defensive scheme!
But the main reason for all this: Retirement of Yanda. Plain and simple"
Romans red zone playcalling is buttcheeks this dude gotta be fired
The efforts of the ravens is embarrassing. Everyone is looking like burnt toast and no one finishes tackles. The offender is boring and predictable why even use a first round pick on guys who‚Äôs never going to be used as a guy with YAC when he‚Äôs undersized. Harbaughs a great coach but the effort by everyone is disgusting. Don‚Äôt tell me that the ravens played well. The offensive play calling is embarrassing. Lamar is playing great. He‚Äôs the only one that wants to win.
There is so little heart on this team on either offense or defense.  You don't have players like Ray or SSR to light some fires.  These dudes simply go through the motions when things go against them.
Looks like guys have given up. I saw bad effort and guys getting complacent with a lead
The Browns officially have a better record than us. Never thought I‚Äôd see a season where the Browns can make the playoffs and we can‚Äôt. I went from being excited about thanksgiving night to now dreading it.
Thursday will make or break our season. I have zero confidence we will win.
"If we blow through the Steelers on Thursday, we‚Äôll win the fucking super bowl."
What a story it would be to go from 3rd in the division to making it to the Super Bowl. Call me delusional but I believe.
THAT WOULD BE A TERRIBLE IDEA LOL. FUCK!!!!!
""
And now we are going to have to try hard to barely make wildcard.
"It‚Äôs not even him. The effort of any players this game besides Lamar has been garbage. Stopping halfway through routes. Peter‚Äôs giving Davis 8 yards of space every play. Everyone just played like garbage and their effort was garbage. Play calling is predictable even as a viewer and our former first round pick doesn‚Äôt even get used. Harbaughs a great coach I don‚Äôt expect the ravens to change coaching, I just expect them to look at this game and tell themselves that they deserved to lose because they clearly have no shit at the end of the game. The whole defense started pointing fingers at the end of the game. The tackling on the lead changing td by brown was the epitome of how the ravens wanted to lose the game"

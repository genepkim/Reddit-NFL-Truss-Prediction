through 10 games the steelers have scored 298 points and allowed 174 points for a differential of 124

the only other teams in the same galaxy as the steelers are the chiefs and saints through 11 games the chiefs have scored 348 points and allowed 238 points for a differential of 110 and the saints have scored 326 points and allowed 225 points for a differential of 101

after that the closest team is the dolphins who through 11 games have scored 284 points and allowed 205 points for a differential of 79
yeah our defense is pretty good after all we also havent had a game where weve been outscored
this is one of those facts that just doesnt feel true no matter how true it is
its a good flex for us as fans but differential really means nothing in nfl


best example is dolphins having a decent differential but bills lead their division


i can imagine ravens had a huge differential last year and look how far they got
i dont want to be the team that stomped all the crap teams but didnt step up in the playoffs
nah the browns by far the best point dif 21 83 record
obviously the chiefs are special again this year but how can everyone ride their jocks and shit on the steelers when the steelers have a better point differential and the chiefs have a worse opponent record the main knock on pitt
have the steelers d and tj watt on my fantasy team

everytime i hear the name tim tebow i instantly have flashbacks pain
im still not over it and i never will be
that loss will fucking never not hurt
that pushed us out of a potential superbowl thanks for opening old wounds
fortunate son intensifies
we dont mention that name around these parts
he was successful in leading his team to the quickest overtime victory in the playoffs
such a bad arrogant defensive game plan that day bleh
thanks for the flashbacks thats just what i needed this afternoon
never speak this name ever again please and thank you

imagine if you posted this and someone was like hey thats me in the troy jersey that would be pretty cool

im in that picture just on the complete opposite side section 510 great shot
i love it but the ocd me would perseverate on the steelers logo on the field being slightly right of center

great photo
did you have a company do this if so where can i get one
i love that a polamalu jersey is smack dab in the center of it entirely fitting for an awesome canvas
canvasses canvi
the logo not being centered bothers me just as much as the lines from the different canvas boards
just dont hang it up like this
i like how the troy jersey ended up centered in the bottom
genius i love it
awesome canvas shame well never see fans in the stadium again im afraid weve all seen our last live steeler game
i want one
i asked the opposite in chiefs sub and theya re not

view poll
they should be afraid of our defense
for the steelers to win they need to rush 4 and hit mahomes often
we dont live in our fears
im afraid of them in the sense that id expect to be 68 point dogs to the chiefs on a neutral field 35 point dogs in pittsburgh

the chiefs offense is just a completely different beast mahomess numbers against the blitz are absolutely stellar so you cant just blitz him out of the stadium but you also cant spotdrop zones either because hell pick you apart there too you look at what theyve been able to do to the ravens and the bucs who probably got lucky that the chiefs seemed to go vanilla to not give anything away once the game was in hand and you can see why a great day from the steelers defense may need the offense to put up 30 to win

i think the steelers would definitely have a chance to win but that chance is below 50
my biggest fear is not the chiefs themselves but chiefs on a one score game with little time left we continue seeing that mahomes can go from the 20 yard line to the end zonefield goal range in a matter of seconds im certain our defense will give him fits throughout the game theyre too good not to but if theyre down one scored or tied at the end of a game its likely game over no matte what defense
the more i see of the chiefs the less concerned i am about them with our offense going up against their defense feels like theyve got a serviceable defense that isnt capable of playing a full game where the game rests on their shoulders

twice now ive watched teams battle back against them like their defense wasnt even on the field and the games should have been handily tied up and this isnt steelers football of take your foot off the gas cause youre up by two scores with half the game left either

our defense taking on their offense is when things get very interesting and potentially concerning not that our defense isnt up to the task but we are a team that starts slower and needs to feel things out live before we dial in to really start doing some damage our halftime adjustments this season have been incredible but i worry that our offense might not be able to dig us out of such a hole if mahomes has a day where throws for over 400 yards 3 touchdowns and rushes by himself for another 50 yards because fuck it why not when youre that good

they come out fast and burn us over the middle which has been our weak spot for quarterbacks this season and that might be the game however if our offense doesnt take two or three quarters to get moving i think we can keep pace and eventually bury them in the 4th quarter to win the game late

the chiefs defense will be their downfall in the post season
the real issue will be do they get behind if the offense does the typical slow start and kc gets out to a 21 point lead its probably over
no

i want all the smoke to be the best you gotta beat the best
im not because even though our defense cant completely shut down mahomes i like their chances better than kcs defense shutting down ben to be sure the last time ben played in a playoff game he hung 469 yards and 5 tds on the best defense in the league seems like people forget that cause we lost but if we score 35 against them i dont really see any way that we lose
im afraid of the ticky tack roughing calls we will inevitably get called for when we breathe on mahomes but i think we are as well equipped as any team to take them down we have a stout defense and have enough weapons for a shootout
i havent watched a whole lot of chiefs games but am i wrong to believe that most of their offense is the unstoppable combo of kelce hill and mahones their run game is nothing to write home about although still good if we could maybe double hill and shut down those 1015 yard gains from kelce while our pass rush does its thing and not let mahones escape to the sides although i could be making this way to simple as hardman and watkins could still be reliable if we devote to much to hill and kelce
no i think their defense is lousy i also think they cant put teams away not just last night but a few times this year they start very hot and then regress to nothing i have so much confidence in our defense
am i scared of them no do i think they have the best shot to beat us out of anyone yes theyre an exploitable team constant pressure needs to be put on mahomes and the offense just has to keep pace which is much easier said than done but possible
offenses are overrated defenses are underrated i think that speaks for itself if we sweep our division which is something they havent been able to do i wouldnt be afraid of them
we dont live in our fears

but fr if you wanna win you gotta be ready to beat anyone anywhere that and if we were to play them and win which is a possibility their defense is lacking imo people can shut up about us being overrated

but like i said their defense leaves something to be desired and so far thats being masked by having patrick fucking mahomes but that leaves you plenty at risk also i was watching the end of the game yesterday and when the chiefs were trying to run out clock some of that play calling to pass was pretty ballsy for only being up 3 its gonna be praised because it worked but it couldve looked like a much different story of even one of those doesnt get completed that could be big going forward if the chiefs keep playing these close games
why would i be afraid of grown men playing a ball game
yes im concerned about their passing game but weve got to scheme it so that mahomes cant get comfortable tall task but i think we can do it
id say weve put on a performance that would have beat the chiefs in about 3 of our 10 games fortunately we still have more regular season to improve i dont really see the chiefs getting better as the season goes on
no
we all bleed
i dont care about the chiefs right now im more focused on us getting the game against the ravens played
we do not care who the opponent is we will take to the field and take care of our business
the chiefs are the costs thing in the nfl to an b1g team playing a mac team in college the game is all offense and that what the chiefs are and similar to if you were playing clemson or osu you have to play a nearly perfect game against them i still believe that the steelers havent played their best football yet but i just hope our secondary can stand the test
afraid might not be the best word i would be excited and nervous to watch us take them on i think we can beat them but we would have to win the turnover battle put a lot of points on the board manage to get a lot of pressure on mahomes while only rushing 4 and just overall play our best game with virtually no mistakes the chiefs are an excellent team and by far the biggest threat to us
itt 369 honest people and 363 confusednaive ones
if you said no your a dumbass
they werent like they were last year imo
im going to assume that the people voting no havent watched a single chiefs game theyre the best team in the league until they arent
a little yeah our offense is wildly inconsistent and struggles to sustain drives the chiefs can score fast and from anywhere on the field yes we have a good defense but the offense is going to need to be able to complete drives and put up points on the board and eat clock our run game is non existent at this point
on third down yes

we need to pressure mahomes but we also need to be very careful when not to
ill be honest i havent watched the chiefs too closely this season so i dont know how well their o line is but they have a massive passing game around mahomes couple that around our secondary being the weaker still by no means weak part of our defense and yeah im scared that they could pull off something more than most other teams

i still think itd be a close game and im looking forward to the matchup if it happens in the playoffs
we do not live in our fears
i wouldnt say afraid

i recognize that they are a hell of a team and would be a tough game
but i can see us beating them

of course i could see them beating us as well
i worry simply because our defense hasnt faced a high caliber quarterback this season yes we beat lamar jackson but i wouldnt consider him to be a high quality passer just yet time and time again has shown if you take away his ability to run the ravens entire game plan cannot adjust weve faced tons of rookie quaterbacks this year as well and the only quality quarterback weve faced has been deshaun watson and he has absolutely no help like mahomes does

if we beat them itll have to be in a shootout as many have pointed out simply blitzing him isnt going to shut him down theyre going to put up thirty points our offense is good enough to keep the score competitive but i really worry about our running game which has been nonexistent for most of this season were not going to win if roethlisberger is having to throw 50 passes
if they let ben run the o and can match mahomes then its an easy dub but if we hand benny snell the ball 3 times in a row we gonna be in trouble
afraid of no team the chiefs are playing great football and have been for over a season or two theyre still the favorites to win it all but i like our team and i like our chances against them if the teams meet in the playoffs
it is what is is we are not afraid
must not fear fear is the mind killer
no their defense is not good
anybody saying no is a clown tbh i understand were 100 but we have definitely had a lot of games where if we were playing vs the cheifs we wouldve lost their offence is scary and if anybody beats us in the playoffs it would most likely be them
afraid is a weird word at this point im not afraid of any team in the nfl however i would say the chiefs would be the favorites to beat us in a head to head matchup
we do not care
if our offense could get going from the get go instead of warming up then i think we could match the chiefs we havent shown that yet and mahomes is just on another level right now so i would definitely want to avoid them for as long as necessary until things get sorted out offensively
i bleed black and gold and always will my husband of 20 years is the biggest chief fan this will be interesting go steelers
for those who say no youre either lying or stupid
why not
yep theres really no advantage hope his ankle is hurt or he his receivers drop balls lol hes a beast
if kelce falls down a hole like he did in moonbase 8 then i totally see us having a shot
just wanted to throw up my ts and ps for all of your players on the covid list and hope that they are good to go and get healthy asapalso fuck the ravens

on a side note i have to ask what is it with steelers having so many players with luscious beards they are glorious lol must be something in the water

good luck tomorrow night yall
appreciate it ts and ps up for anyone with it especially high risk people like conner or andrews also it takes one to know one since keisel retired fitzmagic has taken up the mantle for best nfl beard and hes done it wonderfully
who has a luscious beard on the steelers right now im blanking
thank you for the ts and ps others have addressed the current beards i think the best beard weve ever had belonged to brett keisel

lastly fuck the ravens
thank you good luck with the rest of your season i am sure you guys can stomp the bungles but it looks like your schedule is about to get tough ill be rooting for the dolphins to take down the chiefs

all the hype for this game has been killed already
denver san francisco combined what the fuck is this bullshit
sois this a precursor to them cancelling the game the only winner in a rescheduled game is the ravens im sure they are waiting for this to happen
travel problems youd think the nine players that they have left that are eligible to play could pack into a mini van at this point and drive to pittsburgh

the steelers should not be punished for their negligence
also from this tweet

ravens travel plans in flux with snow forecasted in pitt on tuesday am

is the storm theyre calling for in pittsburgh that bad
is it possible this is just a precaution like just shut down the facility for this last day to ensure no spread is occurring
lurking browns fan here

steelers are the best team in football right now if this ends in a forfeit the ravens organization should be forced to pay the steelers salaries for the game totally ridiculous no way one staffer caused an outbreak of 30 players and staff seems pretty clear they werent adhering to protocols
i am still not confident this game happens this week
bend over here comes another assfucking
playing this game makes almost no sense at all but i guess still better than forefeitweek 18
werent the ravens in their facility yesterday what the fuck is going on
for the sake of players safety this game should be called off ravens have to travel today on a plane if tests dont come back quickly one or more of the team could have the virus and give it to us tomorrowfuck that
they couldnt have practiced anyway right the nfl told teams to close all facilities today and tomorrow so them trying to practice is just a violation of that im not 100 certain its just something im confused about
this game needs to be shit canned
didnt the nfl already shut down all team facilities league wide for today and tomorrow how were the ravens planning on practicing

theres no way they actually play tomorrow right
if the steelers have a walkthrough today then the game is on
lol gonna make a team play a game with one day of practice

goodell showing why he steals a paycheque every year
how tf is this game happening

ben is a big dude and claypool does not look small beside him what a crazy combo we have aside from that i love how much our wrs respect ben it seems like they all trust him as a leader and want to learn from him this team man
cool pic weird title
we essentially have the young versions of ward juju brownjohnson plexclaypool and james washington who is criminally underrated doesnt drop balls will play slot or deep and i am not quite sure which player he fits swann with ben playing his best football ever i think ebron is turning into heath
creepy af my dude
i thought it would be a picture of big ben and the entire state of ohio

welpyouve done did it
our best madden player vs their best
they just did
fuck the ravens
i genuinely dont want our guys endangering themselves like that i really want the game canceled force a forfeit on the ravens
he just did lmao
ravens just called their practice for now until this evening they were supposed to be flying to pitt tonight
we must have game
looks like the nfl accepted your challenge
not sure how to tell you this but
lol ravens got like 19 players out there is no way they can even play they dont even have the recommended number to players if injuries are involved
game get moved again you gotta make that club put some people on the field or forfeit at this point as the ravens id just say fuck it and forfeit and focus more on getting my players and team healthy than causing all this commotion for a janky ass game they probably werent gonna win anyways
edit typos
fuck the goddamn ravens
i dont care about the not enough players on the roster theory if thats the case then they should forfeit its stated in the covid bullshit statement release by goodellnfl
removed


isnt this a repost
yeah like i havent seen this like seventy times

context is we was going to the mothafucking super bowl
rashard mending bens hall
afc championship game 2011
so if both the steelers and chiefs have 1 loss going into the playoffs can anyone explain to me how they would decide who gets the number 1 seed

also after the game last night the chiefs are pretty spooky how do we beat them seems like mahomes does so well with pressure if he can escape to the outside maybe the key to victory is forcing him to stay in the pocket while we collapse with tj and bud containing him

have a good day steelers nation here we go
ive thought the buccaneers were over rated all year i really dont think theyre that great they didnt adjust to tyreek hill

the key to beating mahomes is to keep him off the field as much as possible if hes clicking like he was yesterday theres no stopping that you just try to limit the damage and try force field goals
whoever has the better conference record will be the 1 seed
if i am not mistaken the first tie breaker is head to head doesnt apply here the second is conference record and the third is strength of schedule
i was trying to figure this out myself it depends on the loss you can work through the scenarios on the nyt playoff picture
depends who the steelers lose to if the one loss is outside the division then we would own the number 1 seed since the chiefs lost to a divisional opponent however if our one loss is within our division then points per game and other types of stats are considered which i believe would give the edge to the chiefs
the first tie breaker will be division record so if we dont lose to any afcn opponents we would have the first round bye if by some chance our only loss goes to an afcn opponent the chiefs get the 1 seed as their strength of schedule is technically more difficult 500 457


fun fact if every previous tie breaker results in a tie or is na they measure strength of victory wlt vs common opponents wlt vs conference opponents wlt vs all opponents best net points in common games best net points in all games best touchdowns in all games coin toss


no playoff spot has ever been decided by the coin toss









tldr keep winning and it doesnt matter
tie breaking procedure is givin here

basically it depends who the loss is to first and foremost
chiefs win almost every tiebreaker scenario and this question is asked near daily

tomlin said this year he was a bit of a project but had all the tools glad to see him develop into a great player
i was always one of his biggest haters on this sub he had zero coverage skills and his only use was being the last guy available to make the tackle and even then he was bottom 5 on the team at it tremendous improvement and a reminder to give raw players like edmunds time to learn and improve
a couple weeks ago someone made a post about our most underrated defender and i said it 100 has to be edmunds hes been fantastic
makes sense i only yelled edmunds sucks a couple times this year

one of his missed tackles was one hellofa move by saquon barkley and steelers nation was still bitching about cutting him because of it
ryan clark 20
hes also been asked to make substantially fewer tackles
you can say solid feces is an improvement over diarrhea but shit is still shit
missed tackles drops pressures three of the biggest fake objective stats the guy scoring the plays grades these subjectively just like any other eye test

might be a good night for bennysnellfootball fans lets just trash the ravens scrub line get the w and come out of the game safe and ready to get back into sync with a normal schedule
does the cold weather affect covid19 transfer at all
im so exhausted from all the changes and bullshit that i honestly am losing interest in this game looking forward to the wft game more since i now live in the dc area
if they even play
if and i mean if we lose tomorrow will we retain the no1 spot in the afc the way i see it we have to lose by less than 14 it keep no1 in point difference
essentially from what ive seen if both kc and us finish 151 our loss would have to be from an nfc team to keep the 1 seed if its an afc loss wed drop to 2
third tiebreaker common opponents


there isnt going to be a game tomorrow

2 things worry me in this game

1 our guys getting infected

2 this being a trap game and having to listed to the ravens fans gloat that we lost our unbeaten status to their practice squad

im not really that worried about 2 though
people really out here acting like rg3 isnt a legit af backup
he knows his steelers football
amateur i need 120 from diontae claypool steelers dst and tucker
we either win by 1 td or lose and the commentators call it the upset of the season fucking prove me wrong and obliterate the ravens i beg
yeah i think im more worried about playing backups tbh
if you dont like that then you dont like steelers football
truth speaker
they are a true steelers fan
im in the same boat i really need these defensive points if the league cancels this game because more keep testing positive my fantasy is completely screwed yahoo should acknowledge it or something and give me the points from my backup defense i dont see how it would be fair at all

so its getting postponed
f o r f e i t
follow up tweet

if there is an additional positive tests the decision on whether the game can proceed tuesday will depend in part on who it is was it someone the nfl medical experts anticipated might test positive part of the outbreak or unrelated community spread all that will factor in
tier 1 personnel what the actual fuck

please someone tell me im completely reading too much into this please
with so much working in our favor we are taking this l right
i mean i know the steelers and we fans should be mad about this but honestly i feel like the broncos should be really mad

tier 1 players like wtf is that shit they had to start a freaking wide receiver as qb
the steelers are so lucky to have to face both of the biggest covid19 fuck up teams on the weeks they their idiocy comes to head

harbaugh is probably having his infected players coughing mucus in a cup to so that some sacrificial player can snort it up his nose and test positive to get the ravens to a week 18 game
so denver doesnt have a qb and have to play ravens have a qb and dont have to
and the horses had no qb but they played

i call shenanigans cuz we are 100
just make them forfeit already

i have completed confidence that our team would beat them in any videogame
can we make this an offseason thing for real like someone from our team use our team in madden and go against the other north teams stream that on twitch id watch the hell out of it
at this point id be fine with this
every player has a controller and controls only himself all at the same time even the guys on the sideline
lmao im pretty sure our best player is juju
i commented on an earlier post that exact same thing juju lurkin on rsteelers
id break the rules and come in with techmos bo jackson
let me do it i know all the spam blitzes and 1 play touchdowns
madden pro bowl game needs this to happen

side question from a nongamer is juju a skilled gamer or just a famous gamer
juju for team mvp singlehandedly beating the ravens
not a great idea hollywood is legit at madden lmao
i think wed be lucky to get them to even show up for that i just saw online that the nfl suspended the ratbirds practice today what the hell happened to the statement by the nfl that teams would get no special consideration if it was determined they werent following reasonable safety guidelines that many players at once that was a party and there is video of their coach with his mask on his chin or neck getting in a refs face screaming poor leadership and rolemodeling they should forfeit wtf ps4l herewego bigben ratbirdsarescared ravenssuck
no thanks they already killed the pro bowl for this
didnt hollywood win the last madden tournament between nfl players
wednesday night now
now its wednesday
man this could be a weekly thing where juju plays against a current player of the opposing team in madden
the broncos literally almost had one of their coaches play qb they better have the game i dont care what the nfls rules on covid are as long as theyre consistent

ive honestly been curious to this all year super annoying to see the positive cases reported on monday knowing damn well the guys positive on monday were more than likely positive on gameday
none of this is cut and dried vance felt sick and tested negative then tested positive days later tests arent 100 accurate and the conditions for which the test is checking on takes time to develop if a few virus molecules enter your system you arent going to test positive 5 minutes later

testing on game day does not make the situation any better especially with all the false positives
a lot of the rapid tests are only somewhat effective from experience having known people that have been tested the rapid tests come back the quickest these are roughly 6080 percent effective from what ive been told and they recommend you remain quarantined until the culture test comes back the culture takes roughly five days and is more effective so you can be negative on a rapid but come positive on the culture is the nfl using something that we the public doesnt get possibly but may explain why
there should be accurate rapid testing but the ravens have no right to be upset about this its been the same protocol for every team with every game including the teams who dont have outbreaks if memory serves correct it was the pregame test before the cowboys game where vance mcdonald tested positive he took the test played 24 total snaps in the game 20 on offense and 4 on st according to pfr let alone all the time on the sideline he apparently sat next to roethlisberger on the plane ride back to pittsburgh if someone knows how to confirm that but im pretty sure i read that somewhereand there wasnt an outbreak because unlike harbaugh and the ravens tomlin runs a tight ship and doesnt allow a conspiracy theorist on his staff to flout safety protocols
because they test for the entire week before the damn game and if thats not what before the damn game is i dont know what is
tampa bay is good enough to be another legitimate test for our team and it would likely have been a prime time game not to mention the fact that we get a shot at a weakened tb12 and gronk oh and playing against ab would be cool too
do you wish the nfl would have moved them to the nfc east
tampas over rated as hell
ive looked and looked but cant get a solid answer are the 3 eligible to play tuesday if they continue to test negative i initially read yes now im reading they are out just want to clarify thank you
im pretty sure they are all considered out for tomorrow i know tuitt wont play because tomlin already had to answer questions on how to replace him

update looks like buggs and dotson have been activated from covid list no tuitt tho
5 days doesnt matter if they have 3 consecutive tests 5 days minimum doesnt matter what any random twitter or user user says
ben was put on the list 1110 and came off 1114 which is the same timeframe as this group from 1127 to 121
ben had to have 5 days of negatives to play that sunday hope that helps
now reports have bugs coming off the list y not the other 2 any word


tomlin is such a g
dont love this clip as they ended up unleashing smell in december that year
we will not go gently gave me goosebumps holy shit
i loved this line i was at the game that preceded this in baltimore when dennis dixon almost managed to pull out a w

unfortunately they followed it up with ls to a 5win raiders team and a 5win browns team
was this the first time mike used and things of that nature
i wish i could get my hands on that vest now a days that thing is sick af
unleash hell

idk how many people have to explain this until people like you actually read it pay attention and actually understand it the ravens outbreak is not the same as the broncos

the broncos had a small handful of players test positive from the same position and then it stopped the ravens entire team and office is affected and they have no idea who else may still test positive

how the hell are you guys so oblivious to something thats so easy to comprehend
you idiots dont understand its for the safety of the steelers players that this game has been postponed jesus this is getting ridiculous i want to see my favorite team play football as much as the next person but not if it means next week we will have 20 players out with covid and fuck our entire season not to mention the healthy risks involved

the broncos had close contacts that caused their team to sit out their qbs not legitimate positive tests the broncos played it safe the ravens have a mass outbreak these arent even related

edit i typically avoid harsh words like that but im keeping it in its been fucking mind numbing seeing the anger over keeping the steelers safe and healthy down the stretch fuck
would we rather the nfl made this game happen while ravens players were still testing positive

that would mean our guys would be catching the virus too we can all see that right

not saying the nfl is handling this season well but id rather our guys stayed healthy if at all possible

mods pls delete this trash post

im so tired of this exact same post every 30 mins for 4 days straight despite being obvious misinformation
we do not care

youre a great dad happy birthday to your son

edit this was sexist of me to assume you were a dad my apologies
well this made me feel even worse about the game getting pushed to wednesday we better win to break that jersey in after this ridiculous wait

wednesdays game

i like how we only got 4 yards on 1st down

ngl i was really looking forward to this blizzard game
might as well have a black screen cause the games never gonna happen
tomorrow lol
but its heinz field baby we got this shit
ben under center not this year

if buggs was covid positive or a close contact he cannot be permitted in the facility this soon

the only way this would be allowed would have been the covid like symptoms and needing 3 negative tests which as he was placed on the covid list 3 days ago could work out i thought there were separate lists for this but who the fuck knows anymore
so does this mean hes cleared or that he was breaking the rules never can tell with dulac whether hes relaying good news or snitching


temper tantrum john is due a nap soon
if we dont play this game tomorrow night im going to lose my fucking shit
i feel the same bro

i mean he got downvoted to hell and ridiculedjust like we do with the dumbasses here who are like but the broncos played hurr durrr
he thinks that the steelers should forfeit





also why are ravens fans so angry all the time something about that dirty miserable city must just make them into giant babies or something




edit also asterisk of a season what the fuck is this guy talking about bro if the ravens get into the playoffs because of a week 18 then that is literally an asterisk
damn their head must hurt from carrying around that big brain all the time
reddit is a bastion of stupidity but the mental gymnastics that led to those unbelievably dumb comments would make even the worst troll seem levelheaded
mans is bathing in the downvotes
pad their season

this made me wtf harbor full of knuckleheads
i do remember some jerks on the ravens sub reddit saying something similar to that they also said on that subreddit that we were complaining too much about the being game rescheduled like wtf we have a right to mad

god dammit
from what i understand the week 18 thing is only to be used if there are a number of games that cant be played if they force a week 18 for one game ill be amazed not really amazed at this point ill just dislike goodell even more
we do not care

ok maybe we care a little bit
then the ravens forfeiting is the only fair outcome

we get fucked over again if theres a week 18 and were playing in that
this is jsut schefter getting clicks lol literally no new info in this tweet they waiting on test results just like this morning
the ravens must know theyre gonna be getting back a positive test result today

god dammit
im hoping the nfl does the right thing and makes baltimore forfeit i dont want our season getting ruined because they played with the plague rats
if we lose a playoff bye because of this i may be deceased
this is pretty stupid
if the playoffs are expanded to 16 teams the ravens should be disqualified from getting the 8th spot it would be weird but all of this is unprecedented
wow ravens just placed 4 more on the list
this is nuts
mark andrews matthew judon willie snead iv and terrell bonds

edit i guess its not 4 more they just finally added them maybe after another positive
fuck this person and his baseless conjecture
now seeing reports that they have been offered the option to fly to pitt tomorrow
i just watched the winston dance video how are they preventing spread from normal activities even if their not dancing without a masks im going to assume the virus is still going to spread in a tight locker room

same thing with weight room unless their limiting weight room time to like 60 min a day and having a capacity of like 10 it can still spread

and they do practice right and practice plays for secondary guys it might not be a big deal but if you are practicing plays with a qb and a center and a couple guards and dline their too close to limit spread

im having trouble believing these outbreaks are do to protocol breaks versus things that need to be done

testing every day is the thing that should work keeping a guy away when he has enough viral load to spread
adam schefter nfl still is waiting on the results from todays round of covid tests per sources ravens cannot go until they are cleared if they are cleared there will be uneasy uncomfortable people if trip goes on but two organizations and a network awaiting word

ive exhausted all energy towards this onto washington i guess

dont buy itstill have the bills and the suddenly shocking browns to play
yeah we nearly lost games against garrett gilbert and jeff driskel assuming we even get to play this game a victory is far from a given
i dont think this game will be played

usavevideo
i dont give a shit who we played if anyone describes the hoops were jumping through right now as the easiest schedule in history then theyre out of their damn mind
i put 10 on the ravens beating us by 14 its paying 1550
i wish that fraud could play against us

lets goooo
dotson baby lets gooo
woohoo love getting big dotson back hoping he takes the lg spot by season end think hed help in the run game a lot
thats good hoping tuitt was a close contact well see
activating them does no good if the game never gets played
dotson needs the peoples champ title
dotson dotson weve got dotson here see everyone cares

so a winwin for us they can elect to not play and forfeit or play with a lessthanstellar roster if im reading that correctly
so they get to pick if the game is played even if they have no new positives
that makes it seem like its he ravens choice when it comes to playing the game as long as the choices are play or take the loss i guess im ok with it but wait till week 18 should not be option c
is that implying the nfl would rather make the ravens forfeit then have a week 18

x200b

really dumb decision on the nfls part its not exactly a low chance this level of an outbreak wont occur again before the regular season ends
if they refuse to play thats a forfeit
schefter said it might get postponed again
per source todays round of ravens test results produced no new positives that would impact tuesdays game there was 1 new positive but its an ir player who hasnt been in close contact with others nfl has given ravens the option to fly to pitt tomorrow following more tests


wth
why not fly out today

to me this means the game is on


lets not forget that this entire shitshow could have been avoided if the ravens had simply told that one coach to wear his fucking mask
as a ravens fan just make us forfeit the game or cancel it and move on no need to risk hurting the steelers anymore and ravens shouldnt be rewarded with a week 18 game and pushing the game back to wednesday or thursday only further hurts the steelers
were gonna end up spending 2 weeks preparing for a game that wont happen
bro just forfeit the game why is goodell dick riding the plague rats
move again the broncos would like to have a word
if there are players refusing to play they should be given their l and this charade should be over
dude how can they push the game any later than tomorrow that would obviously be significantly less time than the sundry thursday this is fucking bull crap
i remember a time when games would be schedule for a day at the start of the season and when those days came the teams would play how i miss the simple things in life

maybe they are trying to get a grip on the news about ravens players refusing to play
this is getting crazy


let me off mr bones wild ride
per source there are new fears of ravens players refusing to play tomorrow night which technically would be a wildcat strike it could create major issues between nfl and nflpa if it happens potentially it could jeopardize the balance of the season

wtf

a wildcat strike is strike that is started by a group of workers without the approval of their union
this is some crap
pondering yeah it sure seems like pinky and the brain are making these idiotic decisions
gonna go to wednesday huh
it blows my mind that the nfl is bending over backwards for the ravens
the nfl does not want to push this game my assumption is that their number one priority is containment if they have information putting other players at risk then thats probably why and ill take healthy steelers over a delay every day of every week
sigh

nfl changing the game time like some ppl their underwear
player safety is priority 1 if it gets moved again its shitty for us but it is what it is lets stop whining about it
i dont understand why no new positives if the refuse to play its forfeit
i never thought the nfl could cause me blue balls but this feeling im experiencing is all too familiar

ravens are a bunch of babies
ha haha so what the fuck is going to be our game after this as well as the ravens two games next tuesday and then try to make things normal
the nfl needs to make an example of the ravens at this point just like they did to the broncos
at what point do we get to say the nfl is rigged
lol at ravens fans wanting the players to strike because the nfl fucked up this season those dudes are mad their team sucks and now want everything cancelled
the nfl will push this until thier main rb can play

fuck lamar

now the steelers will play 3 games in 12 days f u ravens
someone gets an award if they photoshop not low effort harbaugh in there with goddell for the top pic
breaking news ravens want first half played at 340 then 2nd half begin at 8 pm so they can eat dinner wouldnt doubt it
ravens fan checking in

i say we forfeit
to add to it the ravens next game is pushed to tuesday while the steelers is pushed to monday
this is getting ridiculous at this point the broncos situation was much different just a handful of guys in an isolated incident that was directly and undeniably the fault of members of the organization the ratbirds are in the midst of a legitimate outbreak which sucks for them and i honestly hope they can get it under control for the health and safety of everyone involved at this point though our schedule has been massively disrupted through no fault of our own and the league cares less about maintaining competition than they do playing games

its not like we werent some competitive imbalances this year due to covid but it seems like the steelers have bared the brunt of them without doing anything wrong if mike tomlin doesnt win coach of the year im going to go ape shit
denver donkeysi like the alliteration
they want to force a week 18 game so we dont push their shit in by 50 its all about ratings
tebow was likely on speed dial

him or brian griese
to be fair the nfl wasnt relying on generating ratings from the donkey game having said that the nfl gives zero fucks about whats fair
the word gorgeous has nothing to do with the name george etymologically
they better bump their next game so unfair
i mean theyre not far off
kinda odd how the ravens got the favourable reschedule
its not even the fact that they rescheduled again its the fact that its on at a time when everybody is at work the nfl cant even make any money if nobody is watching the game on tv because they also wont have fans at the game wtf is the play nfl
is not the ravens its the game they know this game will pull viewers so more money nobody would have watched that broncos game one could even argue that no quarterbacks means more viewers since more fans are interested to see how it plays out ravens vs steelers are always great games especially this year lets stop being so ignorant and look at this objectively
i thought in baltimore they say it like sheeeeeeeiiit
to be fair broncos were dumb enough to not have a covid quarterback who practices separately from the others which the nfl recommended to avoid issues like this
i listen to dve every morning through iheartcan you listen to the steelers through that ive never tried

im working until 5 and just might take my old school radio in with me
some double standard bs
x200b

ravens players recently conducted a playersonly meeting in which they expressed concerns regarding playing on tuesday as theyve been adamant about wanting a day to practice nfl networks ian rapoport reported rapoport added that other notes to come from the meeting were that the ravens want to play but health and safety must come first one source said cant we have at least two days of negative tests after this outbreak before we are expected to get back on the field

sauce
sigh the situations are not even comparable
delete this man it makes us look dumb
this post proves why america is full of selfish humans without postponing this you guys will risk big ben and other elderly to corona xd sheeeshhhh guys surely you some brain cells
ok not trolling here but do steeler fans really think ravens are some kind of nfl teachers pets lol never heard this before the nfl hates baltimore

edit my lack of steelers karma limits my ability to respond ubinjimenvictor no thanks because i actually want to know the answer as i said not trolling ill take some downvotes if i can have a civil conversation about how my team is seen by others



talk about a soup sandwich this entire situation is fucked
sounds like a forfeit if you ask me they can def say they dont want to play but no new positives today or tomorrow means show up or forfeit imo
this is a choice

more than enough reason for them to be a no show forfeit
sigh

waiting all day for thursday night

waiting all day for sunday night

waiting all day for tuesday night

waiting all day for wednesday night

waiting all day for a wednesday afternoon we are here
this is fucking exhausting

i hope they get punished
holy fuck youre quick with these posts

not really surprised though guess i gotta go get a different outfit ready for work tomorrow aint gonna be jersey and towel day now
they can keep postponing the game but still havent investigated enough to punish the ravens

also we play football team on sunday so they cant keep pushing this game back
lol

wft comes to town sunday we shall see

lord have mercy

also fuck baltimore this is their own doing and they cried to the league for this to happen we demand a day of practice foh with your soft asses you dumb fucks are the one that caused all this softest crybaby team with an absolute bitch as a hc how many guys you think come off their covid list tomorrow such fucking pussies lol
bro just cancel this shit already
nothing like playing your week 12 game in the middle of week 13

and an even shorter turn around time to face washington

get fucked ravens you dont deserve to field a team after the shitshow you unleashed on the league by allowing antimask dumb fucks into the coaching staff who disregarded covid19 protocols ranted about it on social media and took half the afc north down with his stupidity

if they cant fire him yet cause he wouldnt cooperate and could lawyer up get better fucking contracts for the personnel you are hiring so someone doesnt sit on the payroll after fucking up this badly
they better change the game against washington to monday as well cause this is bullshit otherwise
snip snap snip snap
im over it at this point the league should be embarrassed
jesus fucking christ i cannot believe how badly the nfl is pissing down their own pant legs because of this situation

its not hard their coach violated protocols that directly caused this outbreak they should have to forfeit not play six days later after throwing a wildcat temper tantrum and cause a cascade of moves to other teams as well

the disparity between how the league treats teams in regards to covid is insane to me

ravens fans can talk about conner all they want but it wasnt directly traced back to a coach just fucking refusing to follow guidelines folks who cant see the substantive difference between the two are blinded by their homerism

i want this game to be played but at this point the nfl and their indecisiveness have portrayed them yet again to be a bunch of buffoons

fuck harbaugh
fuck goodell
fuck covid
i just wanna say fuck u roger goodell just let us forfeit we dont care about ur television money
if there was no positives today why did they wait to postpone till now if the reason is the ravens need to practice fine whatever but why wait until 24 hours before kickoff to make that call quit jerking us around for fucks sake
is the next week game still on sunday no way
this fucking whole thing is some major bullshit if i was your team i would be raising all sorts of bloody hell right now like how at this point just playing the ravens is a risk in itself they should forfeit and stop playing around
must be nice to have the nfl bend over backwards for your neanderthal team
bro this is ridiculous at this point almost laughable
are the ravens getting players off their covid list before wednesday
broncos forced to play with no qb ravens going to get half of their covid list back in time
wwwwhhhhhyyyyyyy

whats the excuse this time

dont want to travel in the snow
just fucking reschedule itthis is so dumb at this point
washington fan here so fuck the ravens either way and steelers are cool in my book but im really hoping you guys stomp baltimore 700

this is ridiculous the broncos have no qbs but we cant give some fairly athletic guys purple jerseys and a paycheck for a day

also please overlook us next week and give us a win
which ravens players are eligible to return based off the extended date
goodell you spineless fuck forefit it and make the ravens reimburse the ad revenue
crazy curious to see what happens with steelers next two games now at least need to push redskins to monday
lost our bye week lost thanksgiving practiced through the weekend game rescheduled again following weeks game moved short week of practice for our toughest game remaining almost assuredly there will be a week 18 which means no first round bye for top seed

weve been fucked at every single turn
so the broncos had to play but the nfl will bend over backwards for baltimore
can tuitt play on wednesday he was added to the close contact list on friday but i was never clear on if it was 5 days total or 5 days between
they should forfeit or give us a 1st round pick fuck this
guess ill have to leave work early wednesday for a doctors appointment
fuck the ravens
i dont see how delaying the game 24 hours when 4 more ravens have made the covid19 list is ensuring player safety forfeit or move it to dec 18 am i missing something
the boohoo birds get their way
this is the most ridiculous fucking shit ive ever heard

i hate the ravens more than i ever have

what a tucking shambles this whole situation is completely undermines the validity of the league how the fuck are the steelers putting up with this harbaugh bullshit hope we smack them
the only thing being played with this game is our emotions
hahahahahahahaha

sorry if i dont laugh ill cry
2 things

offensive quality control coach

and f o r f e i t should be the new encroachment
so who all for the ravens is still going to be out i would assume all of them that tested positive of course regardless fuck them this is horse shit id almost guarantee if this was the jags or jets instead of the ravens they would have just cancelled the game but because its the ravens and a high octane division rivalry they dont give a shit
fuck the rat birds
fuck the ravens
bud brings a buddy and beats the shit out of roger goodell
from primetime to primetime to 340 pm on a wednesday
at this point this is getting embarrassing for the nfl
mercury morris and chiefs dancing once they realize steelers will play 3 games in 11 days if any team can ruin their dances this team can did the rooney tick off the nfl lately
the game is happening at 340 et because nbc had the primetime slot saved for the rockefeller tree lighting
well be ready for tuesday

jon hardbaw
great cant see it now during a work day put a game on in the middle of the day during the week on the west coast whos bright idea was that the greatest fan base in the country and change it to a time no one can see it
i guess i picked a good time to get quarantined
cant wait to watch this game on a friday in february
come on enough is enough already
soredskins game getting moved too

some total bs
ravens are a bunch of babies
fuck the plague rats
goodell doing as much as he can to make sure lamar jackson is in the playoffs
tfw you have to dvr aew to watch a game that was postponed because the rat birds cant get their shit together
if this game does in fact happen well be playing 3 games within 11 days
fucking ratbirds
this is a complete shit show the ravens need to be severely punished its gross negligence at this point
fuck that make the ravens forfeit the game
sigh
throw the damn towel
they cant delay to thursday and then still expect the steelers to play the redskins on sunday i dont think this game happens this week
we dont care about the game getting moved and things of that nature
this sucks

is our washington game getting pushed back i havent heard anything about that

edit nevermind didnt browse by new ignore it
washington is getting way too much time to prepare to play us
we play 4 straight night games now
total freaking bs we went from 10 days to prepare for washington to 4 because the ravens cant wear goddamn masks
was hype it was thanksgiving then they moved it to sunday and i had to work so i was pissed then they moved it to tuesday and i was off so i was hype now they moved it to wednesday and i have to work so im fucking pissed
nfl first waged war on impact and now aewand nxt but you dont have to watch that

whats next poor roh
after a week delay time to cancel this is not getting better dont the ravens play thursday
literally 6 days after they were supposed to play what a fucking joke should have just played it at the end of the season
and now i cant watch the game what a great idea for a 340 start on a workday
its ok nfl this gives the steelers more fire they already have to feel like the most disrespected 100 team it should be about time for us the pound the ravens into the dirt instead of the game being close
ive seen every game for the last two years ever since i stopped working weekends which forced me to miss most of our games from 2015 to 2018 and now youre telling me that theyre playing a game while im still at work on a weekday on the east coast fuck you baltimore
are you fucking kidding time for them to forfeit for reals
they scared
full on maction now

downvote

lol

how the fuck are we turning around from wednesday night now they have to move the wft right


so is our game against wft still gonna be on sunday or
hump night football
what the fuck is this
what a shitshow

they will move our washington game to monday night right
how many players will they get to come off the list now i know theres a difference from those that have been exposed vs those that tested positive my question



apparently theres talks that the game might be moved to wednesday because the ravens now demand a day of practice
at this point the league just looks so obviously to be bending over backwards to give the ravens more time to get players back no such consideration for steelers niners and broncos they can all get fucked apparently
well another primetime game isnt a bad thingyou knew it was coming
so thats good

edit not good we play buffalo on short rest now
all this shit because the ravens are irresponsible
as it should be
stop fucking toying with me nfl
if the steelers threatened to strike this game for more rest after already getting fucked by the league multiple times would the league kowtow or would they punish the team
im assuming we play at the same 5pm slot as ravenscowboys as to not mess with espns monday night football contract
so now the nfl has ruined my thanksgiving and two consecutive sundays by depriving me of steeler football fuckin a man if we werent 100 id be furious rn
ravens get back dobbins and ingram as well now
just move one of these games to week 18 the nfl has already made this a total shit show that theres no fixing now

and its not even our fault again
100 and all you know is pain get fucking real
youre ten and 0 whatever reason youre not having fun is your fault
removed
having a coach who is active member of the competition committee makes me think this gets some traction

its nuts what is being awarded by pure negligence first and now defiance and whining of ravens players and staff
if only you had the internet and could look that up

im not boujie enough to know what this but im sure i cant afford it anyways so whatever
week 18 and no playoff bye here we come
if it keeps going like this roger the great might make the steelers forfeit
classic jimmys
that looks almost nothing like a pair of harbaughs testicles
whats the crab cake reference
crab cakes

must be nice to have the nfl cater to your fuckups over and over
make the ravens forfeit

fuck the ravens
the nfl catering to the ravens yet makes the broncos play with no qb sad

take my upvote great find of a recent picture of john harbaugh there
the ravens are playing chess right now while goodell is playing checkers the games gonna be pushed back to week 18 which will expand the playoffs to 8 teams ravens will slide right into that 8th spot if the steelers are able to stay in first they lose their first round bye thus leading to 1 steelers vs 8 ravens for the first round of playoffs with the steelers essentially not having a bye week the entire season
doubleheader sunday we play the ravens at 9am and the football team at 425pm
ratbirds will get the 2 rbs and a couple of lineman off the covid list by a wednesday game time i dont believe in coincidence
what the hell time to award the game to steelers and take a game off the ratbirds for not complying with protocols come on nfl do the right thing weve been screwed around enough
steelers are the only team getting jerked around other teams are being forced to play but not the steelers opponent

rooneys need to put their foot down and stop being a doormat
it already is next week
come on baltimore get your shit together
i am really tired of crybaugh and his shinnanigins they should not benefit from a problem of their own doing the steelers need to take their frustrations out on them
the nfl needs to find a way to force the ravens to forfeit and force the steelers to pay their players despite the rules
they need to change there name to the virus monkeys
wednesday at 320 pm because nbc commited to the rockerfellar xmas tree lighting
okay this is getting ridiculous its time they tell the ravens sorry boys its a forfeit
this is complete and utter bird shit
nationally televised
we do not care come on guys get the fuck over it
removed
im convinced that i died of covid19 and that i am in hell and my punishment is that no game will never be played again but they will keep giving me hope and then squash it

just let us forfeit goddammit its not that hard
i heard theyre practicing tonight and tomorrow if theyre so concerned they shouldnt be able to do that
just keep moving the finish line
soaccording to the above these players will not practice tomorrow since they are worried about the outbreak

right
it is reasonable health is most important but there should be harsh punishment put on them for causing this we should get their first round pick next year that sounds fair to me ha
cute coming from the team who actively broke protocols lol

also didnt harbaugh get fined for not wearing his mask consistently during games earlier this season get outta here with this nonsense
lmfaoooo bitch made

how many guys you think come off their covid list tomorrow

the nfl gave them what they wanted the biggest crybaby hc pleaded his way into this well be ready for tuesday stfu player safety stfu

goodells ravens what else can you say
honestly thats fair but if it gets rescheduled again its gotta be a forfeit steelers have been ready to play all three times
can we at least get any players back by any i mean tuitt
i actually agree with the ravens reasoning on this i can understand wanting to make very sure that its contained but fuck man steelers getting shafted
feels reasonable players want to know the outbreak is contained before getting on a planebus together

id rather see this get pushed to week 18 than be played midweek though this throws everything out of wack for the rest of our season
i seriously hate that team i had respect for the rivalry at a time but after this all the whining all the league bending over backward to help them get players back totally messing up our schedule i want to see them crushed mercilessly
answer should be no

well thats an interesting twist to this debacle
a forfeited game counts as a game played and a 20 win so it would not be a cancelled game and the players should be paid
maybe this is one of the reasons the nfl seems so intent on playing the game because teams might end up being on the hook for player payments regardless
hen i guess they just dont want to pay the players for not playing the game also nbc has millions tied up in purchasing the rights to the thanksgiving night rivalry game that would have likely had the highest ratings of the season
imagine if the game were to be forfeit what that would mean to future contracts if only players with guaranteed money get paid interesting

this year the steelers lost their bye week lost their mini bye week and now have to play wft on am entire weeks less rest and then have another short week against the bills the steelers have gotten massively screwed this year and we have followed protocol the best in the league it is fair to assume we will play the whole season on about 5 days rest which i imagine is the lowest ever or at least close to it absolutely asinine whats happening to us
tuitt went on the reservecovid list along with hawkins and buggs on the 27th does that mean they are eligible to play on wednesday with 5 days of negative testing
so well have 3 days to recover and prep for washington

sounds fair
in the words of coach tomlin

we do not care

steelers will play thu sat sun mon tue wed and will be prepared

im tired of the whining outside and inside i enjoy the adversity lets just line up and hit

here we go
but dont forget they have one of the weakest schedules
and this latest ppd is the worst because the ravens had no new cases the prior ones were at least understandable and needed to happen for health reasons but the ravens literally just asked the nfl to move the game and they did just a day after making the broncos play with a practice squad wr at qb the rest of the delays were just unlucky but this one feels like a product of clear favoritism
i actually think the seahawks have been handling it better than us they havent had a single positive test
you had a bye week in week 4 though some of what youre saying is accurate but man there are some revisionist fans in here

this is the funniest thing ive read since last week
leave it to zb to make me laugh despite my fucking r a g e
zach with some great perspective
this guy needs to spend his entire career with the black and gold make it happen tomlin and colbert
this guy is a fucking legend lol
ben jrs gonna start this fucking game at this rate
give this man a contract and a cookie
this guy cant miss lmao
but will he be reporting as an eligible receiver
eligible funny man
i wish he could have never gotten hurt in the first game
that was the hardest i have laughed in a while
this mfer always bringing the truth
i know that this is an overused cliche but i genuinely think zb is worth keeping on the team just because of his attitude the dude is just funny and a great teammate
thats some funny shit


were getting just as much of a run around as we had when bell kept saying he will report to the team next week every week

we dont care about lamar we are pissed that weve spent nearly a week dealing with the ravens that its now eating into next weeks game
dont let them find this out the game will be pushed back even further haha
legit question can someone explain why the broncos had to play with a practice squad wr at qb but the nfl is more than willing to push this game until baltimore is healthy
okay but how many of the close contacts can play
just take your ass whupping and move on baltimore

geez
lamar jackson is the least of the issue the real issue is that the nfl is continually fucking with an undefeated teamfrom the titans game on out the one team that keeps getting fuckedthrough no fault of their own

is the pittsburgh fucking steelers
unpopular opinion lamar jackson is probably the most replaceable player on baltimores roster their backup is literally the exact same player anyway hes just called rg3 instead

meanwhile the nfl let baltimore get half their fucking offense back including offensive linemen for whom the 2 guys on the depth chart are not genetic clones of the guys who are 1 on the depth chart
we all want to play but at the same time we dont want them to infect us and derail our season for sure

alternate headline

pretty much everyone except roger fucking goodell unhappy about handling of steelers game
oh youre unhappy
we are not happy with the way the nfl is handling the situation we created
shouldve been unhappy when the coach decided not to wear a mask and showed up to work with symptoms and didnt tell anyone
join the fucking club lol
these knuckleheads out here threatening to strike if made to play tues gawd

bird strike
maybe they should be unhappy with how their ownership handled someone obviously breaking protocols by not wearing his mask or his tracking gear at all times
so if im getting my facts straight the ravens strength coach broke protocol got basically the whole team infected then the game gets moved from thursday to sunday more ravens test positive meaning the game gets moved again from sunday to tuesday while denver who did exactly as theyre supposed to do had 1 positive and 3 close contacts in the qb room get absolutely hosed sunday now the ravens are saying they must get practices in and would prefer to play thursday so the nfl compromised with wednesday and they are the ones who are unhappy

crazy double standard by the league with how theyre handling this compared to denver and absolute incompetence by the ravens also why is baltimore basically calling the shots here its our home game and the leagues call they should have 0 say
j zucker sounds familiar

justin tucker burner account confirmed
fuck the nfl
talks about a wildcat strike never heard of it
maybe those fucking morons shouldve quarantined themselves fuck them
let them play

its what their leadercoach saunders would have wanted a shame they cant support him s
oh the poor ravens boo hoo s

fuck the ravens they didnt follow protocol and now we get fucked
the league should have gone to them and said forfeit or surrender a mid low draft pick to the steelers period
cool were unhappy about your teams negligence stfu
fuck these ratbird fucks

there is too much money involved in this game they will move it to week 18 before making them forfeit the nfl cares more about money than anything else
this is not nam this is bowling there are rules
we do not care
as an eagles fan i hope you guys just smash everyone from here on out and get that lombardi undefeated fuck the nfl
broncos have to play without a single qb but the ravens get to reschedule the game at their leisure makes sense
seriously what the hell this is the third reschedule
one of my favorite scenes ever
funny i keep wanting to picture the steelers as jesus later in that movie except hes a pederast in purple but the we were going to fuck you up on thursday now were gonna fuck you up on wednesday type line is what i want dias mios man nobody fucks with the steelers except hes wearing purple and you know 8 year olds
funny that you use that meme because walter is the one that rescheduled a game to wednesday because of shabbat


thats my wr1
dude was a stud then and still is now my favorite steeler of all time
and that was the last time bens weight started with a 1
so ben walks into a bar and the bartender asks why the long face

jk love my quarterback
he was a handsome fella back then
removed
i dont want it to happen for several reasons but at this point the game seriously needs to be forfeited
theyll move the game to week 18 long before they force them to forfeit should they be forced to forfeit after everything came out about their coach yes they should but the nfl has too much at stake and money in the game to make them forfeit the nfl cares more about money than their players its a sad truth
nothing a forfeit isnt happening

depends on when they actually play the game
ferguson phillips washington flukermarshall too but hes out with a knee regardless


edit 3 mins after posting this it was tweeted that dobbins and ingram could play
removed

the clicks in between are plain torture
this is the greatest thing i have ever seen
i wish i could upvote this twice
removed

removed
because the nfl is trying to coddle the mvp who can generate them a lot of money go to broncos and see what they are saying we are allies
ravens keep having positive tests they dont want people positive playing in the game and need to stop getting positive tests in order to play
positive tests or elon musk positives

so now were playing december 7th
thats better than on sunday
after their lost last week they got out out of the playoff picture but the league has been saying they will add an 8th seed depending on how the season goes so if im the ravens and im already out of the playoff picture why would i go and play the only undefeated team in the nfl and go another game back when i could get get it postponed mess up the nfl schedule and steal the 8th seed

the only way to prevent this is make them forfeit if we cant get wednesdays night game played

edit definitely meant ravens have everything to gain sorry
hows that our gain

thats the ravens gain fam
the 8th seed would only be added if a whole bunch of games got cancelled and they couldnt be played by adding a week 18
so its good that they screwed protocol skipped a game they should lose get a playoff spot and we dont get a bye for being a one seed

theres a shortage of perfect records in this league it would be a pity to damage yours

the pirates do it all the time whats the problem oh wait another team fucked up so we have to pay the price and this is football
i know im being repetitive but

fuck

the

rat

birds
wow did we get rawdogged this year
how did goodell get this job in 2006
we do not care mike tomlin as long seed 1 gets a bye week for the playoffs i wont complain about the short sticks weve gotten
130 out of this will they finally be taken seriously
lucky for us we have such an easy schedule this year s


fucktheratbirds
espn commentators if steelers win all 3 be likethey didnt do it under 10 daysstill need to prove it
good times huh why isnt the rooney family raising holy hell about this
fucking absurd
but were all whiny bitches this is absurd
meanwhile the ravens get and extra day to get ready for their game against the cowboys that was supposed to be the day after their perpetually rescheduled game against the steelers
this isnt that big a deal considering normally 3 sunday games in a row is 14 days
and 3 wins in 12 days

340pm because everyone is done working by then on a wednesday
so they want the ratings for one of their biggest rivalry games to absolutely suck lmao this is so stupid
340 est
what a bizarre kick off time for an east coast game

curious how the tv network feels about this
just to help out the steelers will play monday night versus washington it will be a triple header as the ravens will also play the cowboys monday as well as the regular monday night game what a clusterfck
never thought id be watching the steelers play at noon on a wednesday but here we are
ah yes lets take the biggest rivalry in the nfl and make it a time where everyone in the country is still fucking working

edit oh and im sure those few extra hours will reaaaallly give the steelers time to rest for the next game on monday
yeah im in central 240 is fucking dumb lmao
this is bull shit
working from home and just put a tv in my office guess ill have to plug in my roku and throw on a jersey go steelers
what the fuck how is anyone supposed to watch
nfl just got cucked by the fucking christmas in rockefeller center and the radio city christmas spectacular special well done
that is 140 my time lmfao wtf man
then play on sunday this is insane
thats terrible lol
what in the unholy hell is this nonsense its half wedshalf thursdayall terrible
lol the nfl is just fucking with us at this point
rb jk dobbins and mark ingram will now be eligible for wednesdays game against the steelers per me and
rapsheet
theirday isolation period after positive covid19 tests will be over

baltimore still will be down a dozen players including qb lamar jackson



did goodell forget its not the weekend
hell yeah 340 est is probably prime time somewhere im pumped
gotta get that game in before the positives start rolling in wed
the nfl is a freaking joke the way they have pandered to the ravens is ridiculous 340 is a bullshit time to play a game during a weekday when everyone will be working honestly at this point the ravens should have been forced to forfeit for violating protocols
literally eat my ass
wow now i cant watch it this is unfuckingreal
breaking news the ravens vs steelers game is postponed to thursday because the ravens didnt get a practice in on tuesday
340 really i understood the 115 time slot for sunday to not mess with the primetime game then but there is no other game on wednesday its no different than if people were just watching thursday night football like they do every week except its a day earlier and while it probably wont affect when my family and i will be able to watch it it just is so confusing i dont understand why they would choose such on odd time
i read 8pm is this confirmed

i reiterate

wtf

with the game moved back to wednesday would tuitt have a chance to play
that wasnt part of the plan
i think he actually has covid so no

repost

technically we were still the pirates when we last played a wednesday football game we are 46 all time on wednesdays but on a two game win streak

why was the giants opener a wednesday

not only are the ravens frauds they are fucking jokes
so the ravens get another day off for fucking up this bad solid logic fuck off nfl
steelers should get the tuesday game and make the ravens play on monday still
heres the real news ravenscowboys got pushed to tuesday
this is some bullshit
how did the ravens game get pushed to tuesday and we get stuck at 5pm on monday how more blatant does this league need to be
does anyone know what network will carry this game

who cares we gonna whoop dat ass regardless
ah so this is just a ploy from harbaugh to get as many players of his back and the nfl is all too eager to acquiesce

oh can we provide you with anything else sir need a few more days off how about some extra draft picks maybe suspend tj watt for a half of the game
shouldnt be allowed to play and yes id say the same thing for steelers players
if they werent eligible to play in any of the prior games then they shouldnt be eligible now
so this is why they moved it again
oh go fucking figure jesus christ the nfl is a joke yeah i know we do not care but they shouldnt be aloud to get away with this

the nfl really let this happen doesnt matter though steelers by 30
they gonna keep pushing it back til lamar can play again lol
cant wait to hear the hits vince williams gives them
you cant make any of this up lol
you guys know damn well that crybaby harbaugh didnt just have this be a coincidence
not really a big deal if im being honest with you if the ravens are going to have a good run game they could do it with gus edwards just fine
340 kickoff what in the actual fuck
health and safety lol ya ok
how convenient
we should get tuitt back tho i would assume so thats a plus
this is such bullshit
i want this game to be over with
im so fucking pissed bro
fuck baltimore i hope roger drops the hammer on their ass
fuck the ravens
man the recovery time for these players is pretty incredible granted they were probably asymptomatic but i didnt think the virus could stop being contagious so fast im jealous i had a brutal two weeks when i caught covid
ravens rb jk dobbins and mark ingram will now be eligible for wednesdays game against the steelers per me and rapsheet theirday isolation period after positive covid19 tests will be over

baltimore still will be down a dozen players including qb lamar jackson

ingram being back is a bonus for us hes the worst of their 4 starting rbs
how could these guys come back so early from testing positive ncaa was 14 day quarantine periodtrevor lawrence before playing again like every american is told to stay out of work for 2 weeks if you test positive but i guess these guys are superhuman and get rid of the virus much sooner than science tells us
yes yes they got their rushers back steelers lost one of their best run defenders doesnt matter in the end they gotta win this

and its certainly more entertaining
i dont understand the quarantine times then


im gonna boycott the tree lighting
yinz remember when the nfl tried to cover up ray rice

yinz do know goodell is a baltimore guy

not a conspiracy theorist by any means but
weird flex by nbc but aight

another ultimate 2020 note the ravenssteelers game is kicking off wednesday at 340 pm because nbc wanted and was committed to broadcasting the 88th rockefeller center christmas tree lighting ceremony on wednesday night per sources tree lighting trumped football

what do you guys think the chances of this game actually happening are
way to get the short end of the stick
what the fuck 340 pm do they not want people to watch
great so now after a week of dragging steeler players and steeler fans along nobody will even be able to watch the game
340 pm on a fucking wednesday how are people supposed to pregame for this
never though id see the day when my weekly 330 pm wednesday client meeting would conflict with a friggin steelers game but here we are
lmao this game is so shit even the networks dont want it on prime time haha
wait what is this game really at 340
odd decision by nbc i know like the tree is important to someone im sure and nbc is all about holiday traditions but likeits football like football is a ratings behemoth
goddamned motherfucking trees trees go fuck yourself and your fucking taylor swift bullshit
so which steeler fan lives near nyc and to burn down that goddamned charlie brown tree
look at what the liberals have done now s

as far as i cam concerned those two dates should be flipped the ravens were the team that broke protocol and had an outbreak the steelers had a couple isolated incidents why should the steelers have to take the earlier dateespecially against a team that is hot right now

but the ravens are playing a team on the fucking ropescowboys and get the extra day wtf
ah cool i get to miss two games now thanks a lot baltimore
why do they get the extra day tho weve done nothing wrong
fucking hell nfl so two straight weekday games during the middle of the day ya no one works during the day nfl

"I know the Steelers are known for having well-designating WR positions. This is not only for receiving but also blocking in the run game. 

What roles should we expect for the Steelers' top 4 WR (James Washington, JuJu, Diontae Johnson, and Chase Claypool.) What roles are they best fit for?

Thanks"
The opposite except it’s gonna be Johnson and Washington outside most likely this year until claypool proves himself a bit more
"DJ = AB but less looks in the slot

JuJu = rookie JuJu still in the slot primarily

Washington/Claypool = Martavis Bryant role, stretch the top off the defense

I could be wrong but I feel like this is how it will play out.

I’m excited to see if Fitchner will use CC and JW to run an opposing teams DB down the field repeatedly and then try to get that DB in a matchup against DJ going across the field"
"in 2 WR sets: diontae is the X, juju the Z.

in 3 WR sets, james washington plays the Z and julu slides into the slot. 

claypool will mainly get playing time in the redzone (not clear where exactly he'll line up). later  in the season if he's playing well he might see time in the Z and possibly some slot."
"Juju - Slot, Flanker in 2 WR sets 

Diontae - X or Slot

Claypool - profiles more like a Z or Split End. Will see RZ snaps.

Washington - Z"
"In between the 20s:

Juju is the 'big slot' receiver on the team.  They took Chase Claypool specifically so he could be that strong X receiver on the outside.  Diontae John is our Z in most formations, James Washington is a dedicated deep threat.

Though earlier in the season we'll probably see Johnson and Washington on the field more until Claypool gets up to speed.

In the red zone:

Claypool will probably play in the slot and we'll move Juju outside.  Juju has a little more speed and is a better route runner while Claypool is more physical and can run slot fades without being bullied off the line."
"Steelers are known for making every receiver learn every receiver role. Like, it's something Todd Haley demanded, and it's stuck"
"I think Juju will play in the X spot more than people are expecting, but a lot in the slot as well. But they'll all switch around I bet."
"X= DJ and Cain
Z= Wash and Chase
Slot= Juju and Switz"
"Juju will 100% move inside. Hes like Keenan Allen. Hes a #1 that operates best in the slot. 
Claypool and Washington will most likely split reps. If juju moves on after this season I see dj move to the slot and claplypool/Washington take the outside"
Everyone should shhhh.... This is valuable intel
We move our receivers around. I don’t expect anything different this year
"Diontae Johnson is going to be the primary X-receiver for this coming year. This capitalizes on his ability to beat press coverage.

I would expect to see Juju primarily as the Z-receiver, which allows them to put him in motion to free him up and also keeps him clear of press-coverage - I think they'll play a lot of 12 personnel this year. He'll definitely play in the slot too.

Washington will play in the Z-receiver in three WR sets with Juju shifting into the slot. This is Claypool's best chance to steal snaps.

4 WR sets are pretty infrequent for the Steelers."
Juju is definitely not gonna play the X. That’s DJs
"dj = x, juju = y, z = washington, claypool

probably gonna see a lot of 4 wide this season once claypool is up and running."
"I think you're wrong to put them in roles instead of letting them play to their strengths. We're going deep? 13, 18, 11, and 19 underneath. Need a first down? 11, 19, and 2 TEs. 2 minute drill? 13, 18, 19. They can all play slot. They can all run outside routes, and they've all got weaknesses that can be accounted for by the others. If the WRs continue to develop from last year, and Ben brings the leadership and decision making, the attack will be strong, regardless of who's 1 on the depth chart."
Chase isn't going to be a major part of the offense (unless there's injuries) until JuJu is gone.

1976 Steelers with no injuries.  They could've had 5 rings in 6 years.

Hard to argue against the claypool pick. I'm intrigued to see if Highsmith can steal some snaps as the season progresses
"Hopefully Dotson. Claypool, Highsmith and McFarland can take their time. We need o line depth. 

If you think back to 2010 we started rebuilding the line with an already talented D and solid young skill players...we make the super bowl."
"It's hard to argue against Claypool given all the positive talk there has been, but I'm gonna go with McFarland. I don't think he'll have an opportunity for the first part of the season, but he has an explosive ability and skillset that is just different than the other RBs on the team. If Conner has another ""meh"" year and/or battles with injuries again, I think he could end up stealing the lead role. And he has the potential to be a fantastic pass catcher as well, it comes very naturally for him."
Alex Highsmith; he's on a star studded defense where he will be able to learn at his own speed without too much pressure to start the year and is being coached up by one of the best LB coaches that the league has seen.
Minkah is my answer. He counts as this draft class in my head so I expect rookie of the year type stuff out of him.
"if I can say Minkah then Minkah but seriously it will prob be mcfarland since Claypool likely won't truly get much playtime throughout the season since he's a first choice we while I bet Mcfarland gets rb2 touches, or at the very least get a lot of rotational touches."
"This Big Ben kid I keep hearing so much about that we picked up in the offseason sounds like he's got a lot of potential.

In all seriousness though Kevin Dotson and Alex Highsmith are the ones who really need to make an impact with providing depth. 

Haven't heard much about Carlos Davis or Antoine Brooks Jr. from camp so my expectations aren't high for the 7th and 6th round picks. 

Claypool will likely be eased into the system given the nature of the offseason and lack of a relationship with Big Ben compared to the other receivers he's worked with before. 

McFarland also likely be eased considering the depth we've got at RB and this is a prove it year for Conner. He'll see his snaps in the rotation but I don't think there will be enough for him to truly make an impact.

If Dotson can provide another body at guard providing depth and helping to keep guys fresh on the Offensive Line that should be plenty to make a significant difference for the team offensively. And same thing for Highsmith at linebacker plus helping to fill the hole that Barron just sort of sat in front of and called it a day before being dismissed in the offseason."
"Its cheating to say claypool so I won't. I think its gonna be a battle to see who csn carve oit more reps between McFarland and highsmith. Highsmith making plays during his time when either tj/bud rests (or God forbid gets hurt) can go a long way to carving him out more pt. McFarland has a tougher road as behind connor you have benny snell. But if connor gets hurt and he gets a shot (like jaylen Samuel's did against new england) then its impossible not to give him reps.
I think overall this rookie class may stack up almost as favorably as tj/juju/connor did but for entirely different reasons. Our later round picks will determine that"
"I think Dotson might be in line to actually get the most snaps, depending on DeCastro's injury situation. Claypool has three guys with starting experience ahead of him."
""
"Don’t know much about him but since his name is that similar to Nuk’s, I assume he’s a HOF shoe in."
Let's trade him to BoB for 3 first round picks JJ Watt and Deshaun
"i genuinely read it as DHop and was panicking.
""Did I miss something?"""
"Loved watching him at Penn State, he'll be good for us!"
"“If you’re brothers, why do you have different last names?”

*Shut up Kyle*"
The XFL is proud of you DeAndre.
I nearly peed my pants somehow and had to really think about how close we are to April 1st.
Does he have a goatee by any chance?
"He went to my high school in NC. Its cool to see him make it on my favorite team. He played at Penn State which was the high school coach's favorite team. I hope he does well, should at least be good for special teams."
"If he’s anything like Hopkins, he’s a stud (kidding)"
Who?  Exactly..
"

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/ik1b2o)"
We’re going to throw the entire bank at Watt. He’s not going anywhere.
"Both, imho, are safe bets to remain. The difference is tj got drafted by us so he gets the slight nod for me."
"Tj,  I hope. I still need advice on my last great decision. 
   What do I do with my Antonio Brown Jersey? 
  Im seriously asking."
We've only seen 1 season of Minkah and yeah hes already the greatest safety of all time next to Polamalu (clearly no bias) but we will never let Watt go and he will retire a Steeler and a good chance being a HOFer depending on he stays consistent. Go with Watt
Watt. I think he'll end up being the best of the Watt brothers over time since JJ can't seem stay on the field for more than 8 games a season.
"Minkah had just 1 season so I think we need more data, Watt was good his first year and improved over the next 2 seasons."
#90
They’re both extremely safe bets. They’ve invested too much capital in Minkah to not re-sign him. And TJ is a star that they drafted and the Steelers don’t let those guys go.
Get both!
Watt but i highly doubt we let minkah walk. He would have to seriously drop the ball. Minkah changed everything for our defense last year. They're both gonna be here awhile
"Watt, but I went ahead and got Minkah jersey last year.  I did so specifically because I figured Watt was going to be THE jersey that steelers fans picked up for the next few years and wanted to be a bit different after rocking #7 for the past 15 years."
"TJ because he got drafted by the Steelers. But you might as well get a Minkah jersey too. They gave up a first to get him

BTW I got both"
"Both really but between the two, Watt."
Just got a TJ Jersey last week but both will be the safest bets for the defense.
I went through this same dilemma last year. I ended up going with Watt from a Chinese wholesaler. Fingers crossed they both stay for a long time but it was only a $40ish investment.

Convinced he would be a top 10 receiver if not for the suspensions.
So much wasted talent. :-(
"Maaaan he was tall, athletic, fast, and had good hands such a shame he couldn’t just smoke in the off-season like everyone else."
"This was the most pyrrhic victory I've ever witnessed by the Steelers. Brown hurt, Ben hurt, (DeAngelo Williams hurt?) walk into the stadium of the eventual Superbowl champs (Denver Broncos) and nearly beat them anyways."
Shame it didn’t work out for him. He had skills.
"If he made this play against the Pats, review would have showed the ball shifting and no catch."
I think there's a catch another number 10 wore I liked even more.
If only he liked playing football just a little more than he liked weed.  Rarely do you get a guy with the talent and all those physical attributes.
"I love so much how Bryant, Bell, Brown, and Ben shit all over the Bengals every. Single. Game. That fanbase must really fucking hate them. 

Dre Kirkpatrick’s dad is literally the Steelers offense."
"Hey guys, we still sayin Fuck Burfict?"
Most stressful game of my life
The greatest meme man of all time without even intending to become a meme.
...and the way he absolutely wrecked the broncos defense one game later without Antonio Brown. He was capable of dominance.
"I know it's a long shot, but I can't believe how career is truly over - he's only in the weed protocol, which has supposedly been relaxed, and he's still under 30.  Why couldn't he have a second chance on a minimum deal?"
"It could be my inner diehard fan coming out, but this should be considered a top 10 catch of the last decade easily. I feel like I rarely see it mentioned"
Such a wasted talent
Man I miss that guy!  Wish he could have stayed off the weeeeeeeduh.
"I’ll prepare myself for the downvotes....but this is the play I always look at to confirm that he wasn’t a good player. It’s a spectacular catch....completely driven by luck. Ben places a fantastic ball right in his hands that should have been caught the first time and he needed to do the behind his knee thing to actually complete it. 

Great talent. Poor receiver. Woulda been an absolutely killer #2 next to AB until he reached his post rookie contract.

Such a bummer to hear about how he never trained until his suspension. So many dudes hang around the league with 1/8th of his wake up talent."
That night was an emotional rollercoaster.
My dad has stories about insane plays by the 70’s receiver group...this catch will no doubt be one of the stories I tell my kids.
"I know everybody thinks “what if” because of the suspensions, but the most overlooked part of Bryant was his hands. He just couldn’t catch, and this play was his whole career in a nutshell; awesome result and the ridiculousness just overshadows the most basic aspect of it: he couldn’t catch it even though it hit him square in the hands. This really should’ve been overruled, and as a Steelers fan I’m glad it wasn’t. 

People love to remember the big plays, and they were awesome to watch. But most folks just forget Bryant had like a 50/50 shot at catching a pass, and he dropped a ton of easy passes. 

At the end of the day, though, that’s an easily solved issue. He definitely could’ve fixed his hands and become a great WR. It’s just too bad we’ll never know."

Figured as ND fan I'd shoot you guys of Claypool working out. Not too much here but he does show some nice mid air body control
I don’t think I’ve ever been as excited for a non 1st round rookie.
[Here’s the catch we all want to see from this...](https://imgur.com/gallery/DpI94XY)
Why does his foot work look so good
GO IRISH!!!

He knew he was going to have to move on with his career after his contract was up. Sad to see him go.
:(
"Transitional changes. Aka, coming to grips with never playing professional football again. I wish him well in whatever he chooses to do in the next stage of his life."
"His injury cost us #7 in 2017 and I’ll never be convinced otherwise.

I hope they bring him back in a coaching or scouting role."
Put him in with the coaching staff
[deleted]
Could you imagine this defense with Shazier? Would be insane
Retire the number 50. Even if it’s not normally done he deserves it
Would love to see him return in a coaching or mentoring role one day. I still get upset thinking about his last play. That man couldve been a HoF I have no doubt
This man should be on the sideline for the rest of his life
The class the Steelers organization showed around Shazier makes me proud af to be a Steelers fan!
F
Sad but understandable
I was at his last game. It felt like the longest 15 mins I've ever witnessed. I hope he finds success in his future.
A lot of people in this thread saying we should bring him back as a linebacker coach or scout or something... There's an assumption being made that Shazier *wants* to do that. My guess is he has much higher aspirations for himself
He gave us everything...he will always be a Steeler!
 Bullshit. He will never not be with the Steelers!!
Bummer man
❤
Loved watching this dude play. Wish him nothing but the best going forward.
"😢

Can they bring him in as an assistant coach?"
"I knew this would come. They kept him on the team so that he could rehab, and in the hope maybe her could return someday. With that being out of the picture, it makes sense to move on. 

If he wants to, I bet the team would bring him on as a coaching assistant or something in the future. Right now, just from a logistics standpoint, idk if he could because he was technically a player at the start of the season. Whatever he chooses to do, i wish him the best"
Sad to see him go. Really hope he can come back as an assistant LB coach.
Its because of covid and the limited number of people that can be at camp
So he can do Dancing With the Stars...

"Ben is probably right where he should be.

Until we see him in a live game, he is one giant question mark.

I, like many others, have faith he will be good this year. But he has to show that for others to give him that kind of ranking."
"Honestly pretty solid ranking all things considered and probably an indication of where our expectations should lie.

Considering Duck and Mason were about the 32nd ranked QBs last year this should be a humongous improvement"

Hopefully he gets picked up by someone who will appreciate him.
"Hear me out here guys... let's bring back the Full House backfield.

I will always love him for that absurd TD catch he made against the Ravens in 2017.
Great run for an undrafted player.  Good luck on your next ventures big guy.
Fuck it come back home for the low and play special teams and block some more punts

"The Steelers run game suffered a lot from not having a healthy FB last year, I know Watt is a little banged up currently if anything else happens to him it’s nice to know Roosevelt is out there and already knows the system"
"Can we bring him in to tryout LB? Dude was special teams captain a year ago (or 5, time doesn't exist anymore). He can shed blocks and tackle."
""
Or when any decent player expresses a little bit of displeasure with their team
Roosevelt Nix got released should we pick him up?
"So true. Just saw a tweet not too long ago, “Wal-Mart could fire one of their employees and Steelers Twitter would want us to sign them”."
"Yeah, but he was a 1st round pick! A 1st round pick must mean he's talented, right???"
I remember someone made a post titled Trubisky and I thought not another one and the caption was literally “nope don’t even think about it” and I laughed so hard.
We should sign Fournette
Is it not always worth consideration? Regardless of the probability.
"I mean, it's not exclusively a Steelers fan thing  (not by a longshot)."
Missed Harry Potter meme opportunity.
"If it can make the team better, then sign them."
"I still say if we had Arnaz Battle, Tuzar Skipper, Diontae Spencer and Eli Rogers on the roster this year we go all. the. way."
To be fair I’ve seen this is a common trend on other teams subs too.

"I will be driving to visit Pittsburgh from Philadelphia for the weekend of the Steelers-Eagles game (10/11).  Worst case, we'll watch the game in our AirBnb, but since we can't attend the game, I'd still like to try to get the experience with Steelers fans in their home city. I'm looking for recommendations for locations where we might be able to watch it outside with food/drink service, ideally with a reservation option. I know things are fluid, any advice or other must see/eat/drink suggestions are welcome!"
"Real talk here - I don't know if you have been to Pittsburgh before but I hope you enjoy your stay. In regards to the bars, as it stands right now, I believe you must have food with you at all times while you are drinking and aren't allowed to be there for a long time. I am not sure if you were looking to just grab a bite to eat and watch while you ate and then leave. I figured you might want to stay for the entire game but again, I am not 100% sure that is permissible under the current PA guidelines. Again, I am not sure if this has changed or will change in the next few months but I am pretty sure this mandate was put into affect so people do not gather for long periods of time. Additionally, I think there won't be much indoor seating if any at all as the mandate suggests outdoor, spacious seating.   


If you are just popping a squat for a few, I'd say maybe your best bet around Heinz is Bettis' Bar and Grille. I don't know if they will have TVs outside to watch the game (I'd imagine they would for their business' sake). Another one with nice outdoor seating is Souther Tier. I have never been there myself. Photos look awesome and I know several people who have been there and love it. Tons of spacious outdoor seating too.   


Where is your Air BnB located? I may have more options for you."
Just stay home and watch the games. Going out to a sports bar is not the best idea right now. Just saying.
"man, just stay home and watch the game.  It is not worth it right now."
"You can look into what Stage AE is doing this year. It's literally right next to Heinz Field. You can see the stadium from the outside section of the concert venue. In normal years they open up before every home game, free admission, and you can get some beers and watch the game either inside or out. It's a concert venue so it's huge, including outside. What I can't tell you is how it goes once the game is on. I've gone there a few times before games I've gone to but I don't live in Pittsburgh so I've never gone there with the intent to watch the whole game, so I couldn't tell you about seating or how they broadcast the game. I just know they advertise that you can watch the game inside or outside. No idea how they're adapting to the current situation, though, but it was the first place I thought of when you asked."
"Has anyone been following Steelers beat writers for a while? I saw Kaboly saying he's sold on Ebron - which I'm very excited to hear, but at the same time I've never read any of his stuff because it's usually behind paywalls. 

What's his track record like? Are his takes usually pretty accurate and are there any Steeler specific reporters you like more than him?"
When do we get to talk about Kaboly’s Twitter photos?
"He's an unspectacular beat writer - he's fine. I wouldn't say that you can just take everything as gospel without looking for verification, but he's not going to steer you completely wrong too often, either. Most of the Pittsburgh media fits into this group.

Ed Bouchette is good as long as you remind yourself that he is essentially a mouthpiece for the team.

Dale Lolley is great, but it requires you to support DK, which fuck that."
"I used to belong to Jim Wexell’s site a long time ago. I was even a Mod for a short period of time(my Father in Law had a major stroke and needed to dedicate my time away from the Computer for a long time, so I asked to be removed as a Mod.

I enjoyed Wexell’s writing, he was active on the message boards and willing to answer questions from even on paying members, and was generally a good experience. I really haven’t visited there in over a year...so I don’t know the current environment. I like Reddit just fine for talking Steelers, politics, whatever."
"I’m always hesitant to put too much stock on beat writers/local sports media as a whole. It is a field (no pun intended) of journalism that relies entirely on access. And unlike national media, where there are contracts with entire leagues, teams are able to walk all over their local outlets. That often means, to preserve access, a local reporter must be shameless homer who focuses on kissing the ass of his team and front office rather than holding them to scrutiny through unbiased reporting. 

I mean, hell, Mark Madden was literally fired  (from The Fan, if I’m not mistaken) because the team threatened to cut off access because of him. Don’t get me wrong, Madden is an ass, but the fact that a team can get an opinion columnist/broadcaster fired for having an opinion tells you everything you need to know. 

Local sports media has its role to play. But it isn’t serious evaluation, scouting or journalism. Local sports reporters are a mix of hype men and propaganda machines for the team. Take anything said with a grain of salt."

"Seems like users are nit-picking in search of the most perfectest Steelers coverage, but yes Kaboly is good and reliable. However, that doesn't mean that if he's ""sold"" on Ebron, that Ebron will be good. It should go without saying that literally no one can see into the future, no one knows if Ebron will be great or not. Don't take Kaboly's comment to mean that Ebron is guaranteed to have a great season or anything like that. It just means he's doing well in practice, and it's likely that that will continue on the field in games. But I don't think it's a literal thing, like ""Kaboly says he's 'sold' so that means we can finally be 'sold' on Ebron because Kaboly says so.""

As for Kaboly in general, he and the local Pittsburgh media kept me sane during 2019 offseason. Following the AB/Roethlisberger saga as it was happening last year, it was very black and white what was happening: The national media was pushing the narrative of ""Ben is a bad leader! Tomlin has lost control of the locker room!"" while the Pittsburgh media was standing solid the whole time with ""This is just AB being a crazy person."" It took until AB got himself kicked off the Raiders, then Patriots, then a slew of other public issues unrelated to the Steelers, for the rest of the public to finally catch up to what Kaboly and other Pittsburgh writers were saying from day 1. Kaboly, and those of us who followed local Pittsburgh media the entire time, have had every right to say ""Told you so"" given AB's behavior since leaving the Steelers.

So it's less about ""Kaboly's takes,"" and more about his access. Breaking news, interpreting events, he and other beat reporters are good like that. Predicting a good year from a player because a beat writer is ""sold"" on him is different, and I don't think Kaboly himself would suggest that either."
"I would honestly love some good Steelers follows...I can’t stand a lot of what we have. I had Lolly dead to rights in a comment he made on one of my tweets and he never responded (it’s petty, but I mean...), I really hate Bouchettes attitude towards fans asking him questions, Steelers Depot guys drive me nuts with their “no, Danny Smith is elite and so is Tyler Matakevich and we won’t hear arguments against”. 

I’m sure the answer is that I’m so invested in the Steelers that I find fault with all the reporting...but I don’t feel like we have many good ones. Would love to hear about dudes I should throw a follow."
"They are all basically mouth pieces for the team. Look at the reporting thus far this summer, has any of them voiced an unbiased concern of any kind?
Kaboly's twitter looks like the PR department.

To be fair they have good reason, the last guy that was overly critcal Wexell ""taught a lesson"" (physically assaulted) in the Steelers locker room in front of the entire team."

"It really is annoying how clueless some of our fans are. This isn’t Madden, we’re not able to sign/trade for every star out there."
"I don't think we really need/can afford someone like this. Don't count out conner this season, he will put up numbers when he's healthy. Snell dropped weight and is more agile, which will render him more reps this year and maybe even start if/when conner gets hurt. Plus samuels/whyte/and mcfarland all will have shots to prove themselves. Rb by committee is the smart way, save money and bodies with lower individual reps."

He made bad decisions or got bad advice from someone last offseason.  Let's hope he set it right."

We have some cap space but we have some big contracts that need to be done next year like watt."
"I think hes in our group of 3 b+ recievers moving forward. 

Dont think well have a true number 1 rather a pick your poison type of offense."
"I think we’re gonna move him to the slot, where he can get better production. Diontae will take WR1 duties and James/Claypool will compete for WR2"
"He will be our WR1 for as long as he is a Steeler. 

Is he gone next year? My gut tells me yes, but I also know Mr. Rooney does not want to see him go based on the comments he made after last season ended. 

I love Juju and would probably vomit seeing him on another team."
"Well, I’d cast my vote but I didn’t see Switz on there.."
"Assuming he’s re-signed the answer is hell yes. If they let him go, that would be a big mistake."
No.
I think he will be here as long as Ben is here. Switzer has a job because of Ben and I can't imagine Ben won't ask the FO to do whatever it takes to keep the receiver he has a great rapport with.
"Hopefully he balls out this year.  And prices him out of this market.  Then he either decides to take a discount since I think we have better spots to spend money or balls out enough we can franchise him and trade him for a first round pick.

Then with 2 first we can fill a ton of depth or go get a qb.  Or trade for picks in the future when we need a rookie qb."
Juju isn't going anywhere. He and Dionte are the future. Washington is probably gone next year.
Nah we'll trade him to the Raiders and he will do something dumb.

Ray Ray McCloud is not a viable return man. He fumbled more kicks then he caught in college.

Why not let the guy who made 2nd team All Pro last year be our PR again?
"Nobody is even mentioning Kerrith Whyte. I thought he was a fantastic upgrade from Switzer when he went down last season. 

Granted, I don't expect Whyte to make the final roster, but I'm surprised he's not in the KR practice rotation, or that nobody else has brought him up."
"Should have kept Diontae Spencer.  ""Made"" the pro bowl as a retuner alternate last year with the Broncos after we cut him even though all he did in preseason was make splash play after splash play.  Cutting him was a real head-scratcher."
the non stop hate fest of switzer for the last three years is disgusting. people need to grow the fuck up.
One of those has the dropsies and the other is a unproven rookie. Considering most kickoffs are touchbacks I'd prefer the safe option. The risk reward isn't there for kickoffs
"I mean... It's a practice. The more people who can do it, the better

Hopefully the duties go to someone more explosive but it's not bad to have options"
"Why isn't Dionte Johnson on that list?  Didn't they switch him to PR last year, at which point he ran one back?  Could he not be KR as well?"
Tomlin has always preferred a safe pair of mitts back there but I was really hoping McFarland would be the guy.
"Kick Returns don’t really matter anymore.  You’ll break a long one now if you’re lucky.  Last return was Juju in 2017 and it’s because the Browns were the Browns on it.  Other than that the kicker is kicking out of the end zone.

Punt return is where we have to make our money at this year.  We give our offense 50-60 yards to work with it makes our chances of scoring significantly higher regardless of who’s at QB."
I hope Deon Cain doesnt lose a spot because we kept Switzer
Switz is the luckiest player in the NFL...

"Tyson Alualu may make the roster? Who the hell is Jaron Jones? Curtis Riley listed at CB?   


This isn't a very good list."
"Yes his name is in the rumor mill currently. I truly believe this could be the move that keeps us at the top of the AFC North to come, he could sit behind Ben for two years. With our coaching staff that would be plenty of time to groom a past top ten pick into a solid starting quarterback.We would not have to waste a high round pick on a qb and continue to build our team around him to succeed. Yes we have Mason but for a cheap late round pick, Rosen could provide us with great value with low risk. Thoughts?"
"Well lets think this through. Rosen gets drafted and the next year is replaced by Kyler Murray. Rosen gets traded, and the next year is replaced by Tua. Therefore if we connect our data points if the Steelers trade for Rosen then they'd draft Lawrence or Fields. So trade a late round pick and get a top QB prospect."
Man it really is football season
"Name | Completion % | Passer Rating | TD% | INT % | ANY/A  
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--  
Josh Rosen | 53.8 | 63.5 | 2.4 | 3.8 | 3.23  
Mason Rudolph | 62.2 | 82.0 | 4.6 | 3.2 | 5.02  
Duck Hodges | 62.5 | 71.4 | 3.1 | 5.0 | 4.01

I'm fine with signing Rosen, but I'm fine with not signing him too."
Will he take a prove it deal?  That’s what really matters
That’s a no from me dawg...
"As soon as I saw this news on /r/NFL that the Dolphins were pursuing trade offers I knew if I looked here there would be a post wondering if we should do it. 

After the whole Bush and Fitzpatrick moves I've learned not to speculate on this kind of stuff and just be amazed when it happens."
"I’d much rather roll with what we got this year and see if Minshew or Carr are available in the offseason. I’m almost certain Ben will still be playing next year but if Minshew has as bad of a season as his team’s roster indicates, he’ll be able to come in as a backup who is being groomed to start. Dirt cheap contract and a maybe a 3rd and 5th round draft picks and what do we get? A whole lot of moxey!"
"Lol how many more chances does Rosen need to get before we decide that he's just not that good?

We already have the exact same story in Paxton Lynch. Do we really need another one?"
the only florida qb i want as a backup is fitzmagic.
"It's his 3rd year in the league. That top 10 pick pedigree is meaningless now. His stats and film are awful. That pedigree is the only argument anyone ever has with him. Plus if he sits for 2 years through the end of his rookie contract there's no guarantee he re-signs here and you're most likely not even going to see him in game action with Rudolph on the roster.

>We would not have to waste a high round pick on a qb and continue to build our team around him to succeed. 

It's not wasting a high round pick on a QB if you get a franchise QB. Especially when you factor in the rookie contract/5th year option. If it was that easy to just trade peanuts for a franchise QB everyone would take a chance on it. The entire league knows he's garbage."
"I honestly can’t think of a reason not to other than “he’s not good.”

With that, I think the Steelers should figure out how to get it done. The difference between Paxton and Rosen is that Lynch was drafted by the Super Bowl winner and wasn’t thrown to the wolves right of the bat."
"Breakdown of his film

https://youtu.be/ho2E4ihqlrU

It's a no for me dawg"
"I dont mind Rosen as a project backup. Liked his talent coming out and he has absolutely been put in awful positions to grow in the NFL. Did I see something that he is on like his 7th OC already? Yikes.

That said, I really have no interest in investing any sort of asset into acquiring him other than a lower dollar amount. So trade for him? No. But offer him the low paying backup gig and a team that only has consistency? Yeah I could see that being attractive to both him and us."
Terrible is right.
"Of course he's a bust.

That's why he'd be free for the taking.

Rudolph and Duck are also busts.  Rosen would be the only one of the three who can throw, however.  Which at least gives him a slim chance of one day not sucking, which is more than can be said for last year's group.

I wouldn't trade anything for him.  But like Lynch, he'd be worth kicking the tires on if we found him lying by the curb. It's worth giving literally anyone a shot, if you can get them for free, and if your current guys have zero value or upside."

"He's soft, tho.  Steeler Country doesn't usually do soft well."
Rosen is a bust. He’s had 2 teams fuck him and do you really expect Fichtner to Un-fuck him?
lol. no.
Dude is trash. So is this take
"Why? The dude is ass. I'd take duck over him just because he knows the offense. Rosen sucks. It's time for people to accept that

Let me remind you people that we have Paxton Lynch on the team who is another failed first round pick and likely won't make the 53. Some guys just aren't good. Rosen is one of those cases."

No. Because most of them are gigantic idiots and its like arguing with a brick wall.
"Depends on what the reason is honestly.

Like if someone doesn't want to watch because of the refs, bullshit rules, and stuff like that I totally get it. I feel it myself and I've only been back to watching regularly during the seasons for the last few years now. 

When it is stuff like players kneeling or anything like that I'm more than willing to have a conversation with those folks and clear the air some shit they've got totally wrong. For example the whole disrespecting the military thing. That's total horse shit. I know because I'm a veteran who was told I was going to Iraq to fight a war that was all about protecting American freedoms and ideals. 

Freedoms like the right to peacefully protest and assemble. 

No self respecting military member who is serving their country (not their government, president, or an actual person) will never hold it against another American or think less of them for exercising their rights. That's like telling your kid to be a free thinker then flipping shit because they don't agree with you.

> Old Man Waterfall: I don't condone what Dr. Zoidberg did but I'll fight tooth and nail for his freedom to do it. Or I would if I hadn't lost my teeth and nails on Mars and Saturn respectively.

It's sad to me when a joke in Futurama better represents what a true patriot is than what some think it is in reality. 

Those kinds of conversations I love to have with people who say they aren't supporting the NFL because what it boils down to is that the NFL isn't supporting their bigoted views and this upsets them. Players kneeling during the anthem reminds them of this, seeing the names of victims reminds them of this, seeing BLM imagery and more reminds them of this."
I rarely respond to anything negative or trolling. Not worth my energy and I try to keep my life light-hearted and positive.
"They don't just want to walk away, they want the team/league/sport to fail without them. 

It's an irrationally inflated sense of importance or a crippling insecurity that they'll take a stand and end up being all alone."

No Facebook and I don't look at insta comments unless it's some real specific shit. Done and done.
Never listen to casual fans in any sport about anything and prosper.
"Social media isn’t the biggest issue. It’s when somebody you know starts ranting about the shit to your face that you really have to bite your tongue not to call them an idiot and leave. I’m not trying to get into any political arguments with people I know, but some people just can’t help themselves."
"Nope. I honestly don’t even believe most of them are fans. They are just saying it because they are upset the NFL is allowing it and want to have some input.

That being said I have no problem with supporting the Steelers.  The Steelers as a team seem to have a nuanced view on it.  Many of them like pouncey support the cops.  Tuitt outright opposes blm which is my opinion."

Interesting to not have Brooks as a lot of fans were crowning him the dime backer role after he was drafted. On the other hand the reports of  Marcus Allen having a good camp are encouraging to see.

I’m concerned for bens arm. If it holds up.... I don’t think it’s a stretch to say this is truly the greatest opportunity they’ve had for a super bowl victory since 2008.

Honestly I think the Steelers have set themselves up for a dynasty. The roster is set on both sides for future success I don’t think many realize how great this draft was. It wasn’t about filling needed spots it was all about filling future spots. We have some incredible steals in this draft that will help fill hole for next year that’s how well Colbert drafts. Steelers have been drafting for a year in advanced to account for players lost while they solidify a core roster. Claypool for juju ( I hate it but juju is not going to take a team friendly deal) highsmith for bud (people are sleeping on this dude he’s the steal of the draft veteran arsenal of pass rush moves as a rookie I’m so happy there’s no preseason because this dude is going to make some surprise plays when he gets subbed in for Bud or TJ) and then they got McFarland to replace Conner (this dude will be the new feature back with Snell as the goal line bruiser. He’s quick shifty and has explosive power. I put him down as an easy RB steal in this draft that will make Kamara waves once he sees playing time)

"Depending on how he plays this season. I don't see why not. I know he's been through way more punishment than Brees and Brady but they're still playing well in their 40s. Especially if this defense continues to be elite, this offense looks like they have enough playmakers to compete. Well all know what happened last year. 8-8 with Rudolph and a Duck. Left handed Big Ben could have made the playoffs last year ."
If Ashleys says she’s okay with an extension then I would believe it.
"Considering his cap hit next season and the rumored $175M cap, extending him might be our only choice."
Better be a team friendly deal
There will at least be a 1 year extension to free up cap for 2021
"I'd be open to extending depending on this years performance.....**BUT** we need to find someone he can mentor in the next draft.

^^^^I've ^^^^been ^^^^saying ^^^^this ^^^^for ^^^^years ^^^^and ^^^^was ^^^^wrong ^^^^until ^^^^last ^^^^year"
I’m not ready for life without Ben. Extend him till he’s 90
"That's definitely one way to say Rudolph is not the heir apparent. 

Extend Big Ben past 2021 and that's the last year of Rudolph's contract.

Trade up in 2022 to take a great rookie quarterback who spends a season behind Big Ben who retires at the end of 2022 (likely extended to help ease that cap space issues we'll be up against next season) leaving it to the first round rookie who will be coming into their second season with the team."
"While a life without Ben will be terrible, his cap hit is and will be even worse.  Gonna be some lean times when he’s gone."
It needs to be team friendly and at least two years because our cap situation is kinda fucked at the moment
They almost have to. No way they can operate with him having a 40 mil cap hit next season.
"This is fine, but they still need to be drafting the real QB of the future in one of these next few drafts (and I mean a first rounder not a fourth rounder taken in the third)."
"Unless Roethlisberger shits the bed this year, they're basically going to have to extend him if they want to be able to compete beyond this year."

"They signed Curtis Riley to back up at safety, and from Kaboly's accounts it sounds like the plan is to shift Marcus Allen into the dimebacker role.

Of anyone on the market now, I think Haha Clinton-Dix is actually not a horrible idea. He was just let off a 1 year, 3.5 deal and we have enough cap space to pick that up. We might even get him cheaper since he just got cut. Pick him up on a 1 year deal and use  Edmunds as more of a Dime backer."

"Bought my son's first Steelers jersey the other day and it came in the mail today, one of those dad moments I really couldn't wait for lol."
"Hey Steelers fans, Jets fan coming in peace but also an FAU alum and was excited to see James Pierre made your 53! Hows he been for yall? He was definitely our(FAU) best CB last year, especially in man. I hope he balls out for yall."
"So I was looking around on the NFL app, and reading the player news for Tuitt, it says Pittsburgh just placed him on IR and singed a DE. This really happen?"
"9/7, it's been 2 years Pitt. RIP to the great Mac Miller."
"I’m the campaign manager for a state senate race in Rhode Island and we’re down in the primary by 95 votes with 1,657 mail ballots to be counted. Need all the positive energy we can muster for this last haul and if you live in Senate District 37 in Rhode Island then tell Sue Sosnowski to drop out."
"It’s Friday. I’m bored working from home, as I’m sure many are. Here’s something to think about: Who ends up with the most snaps/production in our “position battles” this year? By position battles, I mean both players battling for first team reps, and just two or more really good players playing the same position. With that being said:

RB: Conner/Snell/Samuels/McFarland

WR: Juju/Diontae/Washington/darkhorse Claypool?

TE: Vance/Ebron

RT: Chuks/Banner/Feiler(?) (legit battle for snaps)

DT: Alualu/Wormley (legit battle for snaps)

DE: Cam/Tuitt

ILB: Bush/Bince

CB: Haden/Nelson

Slot CB: Hilton/Sutton (just throwing in a dark-horse battle)

Drop your predictions/ideas/thoughts. Let me know if I’m missing anything as well."
"RB- Connor

WR- JuJu/Johnson, 3rd? Washington until Claypool develops...then I think he drops to #4

TE - Ebron 

RT- Banner

DT - Alualu

DE- ? They are both starters...I don’t get this one

ILB - same...however...Bince will come off the field in passing situations...so...Bush

CB - same(again) with CB’s...perhaps opportunities are defined as passes thrown their way(opportunity to make a play). In that case? Haden. I think a QB would be more prone to take a chance on an older CB..but that’s all up in the air as the season progresses.

Slot CB - Hilton...but I think Sutton has a real chance to beat him out."
"Conner is the lead back and gets the most reps by a mile, pending health. Snell is the next man up.

You've got the receivers listed in the correct order.

Ebron will outsnap Vance, but they'll be close. Lots of 12 personnel coming.

Chuks gets the start at RT, Feiler kicks inside to LG, Banner is your swing tackle and only sees a handful of snaps per game.

Alualu outsnaps Wornley comfortably.

Cam/Tuitt will be pretty close but I'll give the edge to Cam because you know Tuitt is going to get nicked up.

Bush will get a few more snaps in sub package, but they'll both play a ton.

Haden and Nelson will both play 90+%

Hilton will outpace Sutton but not by a ton."
"Feiler is playing left guard.

Alualu starts at NT.

Haden and Nelson are the same.

Cam and Tuitt are too."
Bush and Bince play different positions
Like the title says. What do we think the realistic expectations are for Claypool? I know there has been a lot of hype around this kid and I think for good reason considering his measurables. But what kind of stat predictions can we come up with for him (realistically)? What type of impact can he have on this team that won't show up on the stat sheets. I'd love to hear all of your opinions!
"122 catches 1940 yds receiving 13 TDs

OROTY and MVP runner up"
"32 catches, 400 yards, 4 TDs.

You won't see a lot of him in the first 4-6 games - probably mostly in the red zone - but he'll get more snaps as the year goes on. Easiest pathway to success is taking snaps from James Washington at the Z-receiver position."
"Realistic expectations should be around 350 yards, like any other #4 receiver in the league."
Megatron
Probably something like Martavis Bryant’s 2014 season.
"Juju had an outstanding rookie year, Washington’s rookie year was subpar and Dionte’s rookie year was good. Going off of the recent history, I expect that Chase will have a good year, but until we see him in a live NFL game vs a NFL defense, it’s tough for me to form an opinion."
I feel like 700 yards and 8 TDs sounds realistic
"Honestly, I'm expecting 400 yard and 2 TDs for him. I think anymore is starting to get unrealistic. He's the 4th WR behind 3 good WRs, a rookie, and also behind Ebron imo.

I'm also trying to go very low on my expectations because I'm madly in love with him already looool"
1998 Randy Moss
"My realistic expectation: Around 300-450 yards, 2-3 TDs, on roughly 30-40 catches.

Realistic possibility: He has some big plays and catches in the first half of the season, and gets more play time in the 2nd half either by simply earning it or an injury, finishes the year strong and ends with around 60 catches for 700-800 yards and 5-8 TDs.

Possible but very unlikely: He ends up the WR3 by week 3, but goes off and ends the year around 80 catches for 1000-1100 yards, 8-11 TDs.

Fuck it I'm a homer and this'll happen: 110 catches, 1500 yards, 12-15 TDs, Mapletron SZN in full swing, Superbowl winning catch."
"They're going to gradually work him in. Can't see it being like a Juju situation where we drafted him out of need. Recall how bad it was in the AFCC when NE was able to bottle up AB since no one else was a big threat at WR.

We don't have that problem since Ben will reunite with Juju, and has two established rising stars in Diontae and JW. This is a move to see if Juju can eventually be phased out, and keep a wealth of weaponry for however long Ben plays.

In the ballpark of 500 yards, 4 or 5 TDs. Imagine he makes his balls on some big burner plays, but the realistic expectation is less encouraging based on him alone since the WR room is stacked. Then again, his raw talent isn't exactly in realistic territory."
"700-800 yards, 60 catches, 5-6 TDs."
"I have the (perhaps unrealistic) hope that he turns into a real goal-to-go threat. At 6'4"", 240 with a (collegiate) rep for coming down with contested catches I see him getting less than 400 yards but more than 6 TDs. Go ahead. Double JuJu."
"Maybe not a ton of yards, but I think he'll catch 5-8 red zone TDs as a sort of specialist. He's too big not to throw a couple up each game."
"Realistic expectations would be like 25 catches, 300 yards, 5 TDs"
"Similar to Martavis Bryant would be great, but Claypool ain’t starting over Juju, Washington, or Diontae."
58 / 730 / 7
"Idk, but i wouldnt be suprised if by the end the year, they consider our recieving core as one of the best......*too soon* but maybe the best"
655 yards
"I think he’ll eventually earn a starting spot around the mid-point of the season, kinda like Martavis Bryant. He’ll be either the 1 or the 2 by the end of the year."
I’d say probably somewhere between James Washington’s rookie year on the low side and Martavis Bryant’s rookie year on the high side.
"Huge Notre Dame fan.  It’s hard to tell because we didn’t have the best QB throwing him the ball until his senior year, but there’s potential there for him and Juju to be the next Boldin and Fitzgerald"
"Total stats I have no clue, but I don't think he'll play much early on barring injury. He'll get some redzone work and maybe some snaps on run plays where he can utilize his blocking ability."
It depends on the opportunities he’s given and what he does with them when he gets them.

Translation: Mason gets to wear a headset this year
This is meaningless unless we see him play. They used to talk about Landry Jones looking good too
"Please, don’t even fucking mention either of those guy’s names for the rest of the season. I have serious PTSD from last season. Goddamn what a nightmare that was."
Press X
And let's hope none of them get any snaps all season.  Well maybe if we're up by 40 points....😁
">”Mason, he looks like a veteran”, he told Pat Kirwan and Jim Miller on SiriusXM Radio on Thursday. “He’s still developing. He’s making some good decisions, he’s getting the ball out. He’s continuing to grow, much like Devin Bush is at the linebacker spot. So you feel a little more comfort level there.”

That is not what a GM says about a franchise’s ’heir apparent.’ Mason better be happy with being a backup QB or he should start looking for another team."
Wait who is our QB2?
A veteran journeyman QB maybe
Losing his sight like an old vet...? So he still can’t see further than 10 yards for passes? 😂

"Conner, Snell, Samuels, and AntMac are all players that this sub and the coaches seem pretty high on. Conner needs a bounce back season, Snell is the beast that we all want to see prove himself, Samuels has received praise from coaches for his receiving ability, and AntMac looks SO incredibly talented.

How do you think the depth chart will look, and how do you think the snaps will be spread amongst them?"
[deleted]
"Conner 

Snell

Mac

Samuels

I would imagine it's a psuedo split between Snell/Mac if Conner goes down."
"Conner will still be the starter, he’s obviously the best when healthy. However if he does get injured again, I don’t see him getting another chance to have meaningful playing time."
"Samuels really has no place on this team, not sure why we would keep him"
"I was planning to really push a ""cut Samuels for Whyte"" narrative this off-season but seems unlikely now with the shortened schedule"
"I think we only keep 3 RBs since we're keeping a FB, and Samuels gets cut."
I sense we are not deep on the rb situation?
Macfarland will be the starter by week 6

Lmao at people thinking that the Lions won’t disappoint just like every other year. Patricia is a bad coach and that organization is garbage.

"There’s no reason not to take a look at him, he’s no where near as bad as Paxton Lynch at least"
"If they sign him, he’ll be QB3 by default. Rudolph and him have similar track records, but Mason knows the playbook. Rosen would only become QB2 if Ben goes down and Mason royally fucks up his return to the field. Like, REALLY fucks it up."
Pens may be releasing Matt Murray. Any interest in the Steelers picking him up?
Why not improve the competition....either Lynch or whats left of Rosen's upside.  Go for it!!
"He's worse than Mason Rudolph.

NO."
"I mean hes a former 10th overall pick whos been on some bad teams, why not take a flyer atleast?"
"Being released from Dolphins.

Rudolph and Hodges are unlikely to cut it, would you take a low risk punt on him?"
"As much as people want to shit on Rudolph and Hodges, let's look at Rosen's statistics in comparison (from PFF):

Rudolph: 82 Rating, 5.51 Net Yards /Attempt, 5.02 Average NY/A

Hodges: 71.4 Rating, 5.49 NY/A, 4.01 Average NY/A

Rosen: 63.5 Rating, 4.32 NY/A, 3.23 Average NY/A.

Let's look at some other factors as well: Rudolph also suffered a traumatic brain inury, which obviously rattled him and you could see a difference for the rest of the season. With a full offseason to reset his head and get any jitters out, and with another full camp with the team, he has the best upside of the three to go in for a game to replace Ben. Rosen is worse than Duck, and even if you want to focus on the fact he was thrown into rather unfortunate situations his first two years, two teams did have the chance to evaluate him in camps/practice and have decided he does not cut it. If we were to bring him in, he wouldn't have the experience the other QBs have, recently going through training camp and building rapport with the team. Additionally, we have to look at cuts to make the roster limits by 4pm tomorrow, so adding one more unknown person to the list, while cutting guys that have been with the team all summer doesn't really work well. Rosen's just not good enough (right now) to be safe enough to bring in."
They aren't gonna do it so I don't think it's even worth discussing.
Why not
Fuck yes! Pick him up for real. Kid has nothing but upside. Needs a shot with a real organization.
"Six of Lynch, half a dozen Rosen."
Exactly.....why not!!!
No.
"nooooooooooooooooo

also i don't like either mason or duck as players, but this dude stinks and people need to let it go

The people who keep believing in Rosen are the same people believing in Mason"
Vet minimum sure
"I'd swap Duck for Rosen if I were the front office. Rosen was considered by some in the league to be a truly elite prospect coming out of college, while Duck's ceiling is as a backup, and not a great one at that."
"I'd rather take Rosen than Rudolph, Hodges, or Lynch."
no.
"People aren't mentioning Matt Canada so I'm going to mention this. He's been known to groom QB's and help them with the mental aspect of the game, and be better so this is the perfect time to get Rosen. We have ben for like 2 years this year and one more year I believe, so Rosen can learn from that Canada and he has really great upside it's a low-risk high reward type of situation."
"No way on Josh Rosen, he couldn’t cut it on 2 low level franchises.  What makes you think he can do it in an elite organization.  The guy needs to move on with his life.  NFL is not for everyone."
"Why? 

He could barely beat Sam Bradford and Mike Glennon in AZ. Then he was cut by MIA in favor of Fitz and Tua, who by all reports hasn’t done too much because he’s limited by his hip still.

What’s next? Y’all want Nick Foles too? 

Edit: we also already basically have Josh Rosen in Paxton Lynch who had a similar initiation to the NFL"
Shut
"I think he will take a one year prove it deal at vet min, we have all the leverage here"
Shut the fuck up
Can we stop making these posts any time a player is released from a team? Peterson is 35 and who knows if he'll even last through another season. It's just an unnecessary hit to our cap.
Call the Steelers main office line and ask to speak to Kevin Colbert
Lol we don’t need AP. This sub sometimes smh
"I don’t want a serial child abuser on my favorite team. And besides that, he’s 35. He doesn’t have much left in the tank."
"No thanks, an old child beater isn’t what we need at RB."
Let me ask the Cap Room Tree if there are funds available....hmmm....this stump with two leaves say no.
"He's not versatile enough to be a great fit for our scheme, and he's not good enough at this point in his career where he's worth changing our scheme to accommodate."
no.
""
Y’all wanna sign anyone and everyone
No.
"Lol, okay"
"He doesn’t really seem that good. If two teams (including the team who used a 1st rounder on him) have dumped him before he’s even 24, that’s not a good sign.

I mean, 22.4qbr? Five picks and one touchdown? Mason did way better and even duck outperformed him from the practice squad."
I don’t mean to sound facetious but my honest opinion is that if they sign him it’s a good move and if they don’t sign him it’s also a good move. I trust Tomlin and Colbert if they think he’s worth a flier then I’m all for it if not then I think they’re probably right to not waste their time.
Lol
"Yes, another shit QB for our collection of backups. Seriously though Mason is better. Anyone who thinks otherwise is just looking at where he was drafted and assuming skill that was never there."
no.

"I’m drafting Steelers D before I draft a second QB, no doubt. Then hopefully can snag Boz with my last pick. Roster doesn’t feel right without one or both"

TJ will be hugging guys all night

"Got Steelers d, JuJu and mapletron(16th round) had our d last year and they crushed it every week, expecting more of the same especially with better offense"
"If by hug you mean TJ’s lunch, then yes."
"I get the Steelers defense in every league, no doubt"
We will hug you a little before we fuck you.

"Only?   In 54 Super Bowls, 16 of them have been part of a back to back.  That’s nearly 30%.   Seems like a lot."

Wanna see me win back to back ... wanna see me do it again
Steelers: 2 back to backs. Pens: 2 back to backs. Bucs: Derp.

Yeah ...
Steelers are just a different breed
[removed]
Why dont you check the other 3 threads about it?
"Bro you’re gonna get ripped for this one lol

Honestly I get why people would want Rosen but I think it’s a bad omen that he’s now been let go by 2 different teams. Arizona I kinda get, once they signed Kliff he made it very clear that he wanted Kyler and Rosen just had a bad rookie season and wasn’t coached up well. But Miami is kinda different, they had the coach that would’ve supported Rosen and given him the opportunity to run the offense, but Rosen kinda flopped. Fitzpatrick did pretty ok with the offense some games, and I think Tua is gonna be ok, so it’s just very WEIRD to me that Josh didn’t. I get the desire for Pittsburgh to sign him but i wouldn’t have high hopes about him being the heir to Ben or anything like that"
this sub is panicking about the end of Ben haha

Screwing up our comp pick formula again this year
I’d happily take him back as long as he doesn’t hit joe Haden again lol
Ron Rivera doesn't like a guy who constantly makes mental errors.  Go figure.
I’m very confused... we went out and got Ebron and Vance has been great for us. Why are we all caught up about vannett? He’s like the third or fourth TE on Denver too???
I hear there’s a former second-round-pick safety available.  The Steelers should go get him. /s
Put him next to Minkah and do you really think he'd look much different than Edmunds?

"Incoming signing of Clowney and Adrian Peterson.

I am sure we are going to sign 1 or 2 guys today or tomorrow for depth."
This would be a great chance to pick up Josh Rosen CHEAP!
what does that put us to in total cap space?
"that's a good bit

cam extension coming?"
Does anybody in the world feel good about the Steelers O-line right now???
Josh Rosen says hello.
"I tossed up a video on YT a bit ago detailing the restructure. Even though the team needed to make cap space, I am not a fan of pushing more money into 2021 and bloating that already bloated cap. 

What do others think?"
Seems like they are really pushing “win now”. I’m okay with any signing as long as we manage to sign TJ Watt when the time comes
"I mean regardless of next year we still need money to sign players for the practice squad this year. Not to mention have a little money in cause of injuries later in the season.

For teams that are close to the cap and still have a good team, like the Steelers and Saints, it's better to make sure to go all in if needed instead of relying on 2021 when you start cutting players."
"Any cap space that's free this year rolls over to next year, so it's possible they're trying to save some space next year? I don't quite remember how restructures spread the cap hit though."
This has gotta be to make some room for Vannett. Let’s go baby! #HereWeGo

Based on standard deviation, the players whose results were the most consistent were also the exact players whose results were the highest (Pouncey, Heyward, Fitzpatrick, etc).

Feel bad for Dobbs. Hope someone picks him up. (Not saying we should) but I will always remember him stepping in when Ben got the air knocked out of him and he made an insane 2nd and 20 backed up to our 4yd line to Juju in the Ravens game to seal the deal.
I can see the Steelers wanting Dobbs over Hodges. They did last season.
"Sounds like their rolling with Minshewmania and nothing else. If he goes down, they just won’t have a QB. 4D tanking."

"I like these older player takes, like they would of been off social media if they played today."
"Weird, seems like you posted this on Social Media, Rod."
Shit like this makes me appreciate Troy that much more.
Why do people act like JuJu being more involved with his social media makes him less focused on football? Like all these NFL guys do the same things JuJu does he just shows it more
Thats some oldhead football player mentality.
"The old player takes are so weird to me. The same thing happens with old NBA players too, except most older NBA players realize the current game/players have changed. Older NFL players can’t seem to realize that it’s a new league, with a completely new generation of young players (who are into completely different things off the field)."
"Honestly not really. He doesn’t have a point with social media, Jujus a hard worker, but for sure name recognition and social media fame has boosted his value. Lets be real, even with another 1k season, the money situation is going to be difficult, and we have Claypool, maybe James Washington, Diontae and picks next year."
Rod's showing his age.
Juju creating a brand on social is showing that he's smart. It doesn't mean you don't care about football if you also want to use football to further your life goals. No one says this shit about Aaron Rodgers or Clay Mathews appearing in commercials left and right.
"This is Ravens Rod coming out, not Steeler Rod."
"I wanna see juju redemption as much as everyone else he was just bad last year though even out if injury he tipped some balls for ints.

I feel like he will shine again with Ben but damn last year he looked WR3 on our team even when healthy."
Juju won’t be extended.  Rod is 100% right.

If he puts up stats on the  level of his sophomore season how much are you comfortable paying him?

Oh boy
oh no
Juju don’t...
Love juju but cmon man... there’s a damn good reason you haven’t been extended at this point
JuJu is worth about half of that Allen deal right now.
"Good teams run with their dudes on rookie deals and draft well, keeping their main pieces around. Idk how much we can pay the guy. I'd love for him to stay around, but we have a nasty cap situation."
"JJSS will not see a Steelers dime next season. We just moved $27M over the $175M projected cap with DDs restructure today. 

Sad that Rod Woodwon went after him today. Guess he forgot about the time he tried was involved with stealing a tip jar full of chump change or the numerous drunken issues at 2:30 AM he went through in his day. Love me some 26 but he should not toss stones."
"Why tf do y’all hate on Juju?

Y’all would’ve hated Hines too. Man has one bad season with bad QBs are you’re ready to let him leave."

I know a lot of you wanted Switzer gone. But this likely means McCloud made the team and he has had major ball security issues his entire career. Could wind up being a disaster.
Whoa
"Wish him the absolute best and hope he has a good career ahead of him.

Maybe now this sub can calm down a little and stop crying about him."
I know lots of ppl hate him but hopefully a team signs him and if not - he can stay on our practice squad and get some money

I wish he stayed, I thought this year could be a big year for him"
He’ll attempt to sign with another team but get stopped 3 yards short of his goal.
"Ray ray szn!!!!!!

Edit:

Damn you guys downvoted me for being right smh"
"I am shocked, but not shocked at the same time... Someone else must be tearing it up at WR for this to happen."
"Good luck to the man in the future, but I'm happy I won't have to see him return kicks again."
"I think this is about trying to protect young players from being claimed off waivers.  

There is almost no chance they go with only 5 receivers - one being a rookie and another being a special teams guy.  

They are going to add another once waiver moves are made, imo"
"As resident Switzer apologist, this makes me sad

Think we could drop Jaylen Samuels for Cain or Switz"
I will miss him catching the ball and falling down.
Wow

"After DJ outshines him in special teams last year, im pretty sure everyone saw this coming sooner or later."
"I liked Switzer but one less player for the drunk teenagers who sit behind me to yell HEATH at, the better."
"I know we'll probably end up resigning him when he's healthy, but I'm celebrating for now."
"Dumb move. Who are they going to force screens for -2 yards to now, hmmm? Haven’t thought this through, have ya Mikey?"
"Great person, bad player"
Ugh.. i really liked switz.
Met him at a hospital. Stand up good guy who got too much hate. I'll always root for him.
Hallelujah he's gone!
WHAT
WERE FUCKING FREE LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO. WAY PAST DUE FOR THIS MOVE
Surprised this doesn’t have more upvotes
"Switzer has somethings he does well, but there is not enough there to be worth a roster spot on a competitive team. Just too limited."
I got downvoted to hell a couple months ago in a comment section on this sub for dogging on Switz a little bit. Seems like a good dude but I didn’t understand the love affair lol and I got swarmed for it
I thought this might happen but it's still tragic. I thought he could have had a big season this year with Big Ben back.
"Good, he got every opportunity to prove himself. Not good enough to see the field as a WR, did nothing I’m the return game. You can have anyone else back there fair catching everything. Plus, he will be available if we want him back.l or put him on the adjusted PS. He’s done nothing to warrant a look from anyone else."
Deon Cain incoming??
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
"Bout time. Preaching to the choir here, but he’s awful. Can’t believe he lasted this long."
Well I’m glad the useless returns may finally end.
Wow
Mccloud over Switzer? Disappointed.
Good
LOL
This is about as wise a move as if the Pirates cut their entire roster.
I wasn’t out of Switzer jokes yet..
"Yes, way too much hype - but to be honest I've never been more excited to see our offense.  Juju needs another threat to help him out.  Chase, Diontae, James W., Ebron. . . .this offense has a ridiculous amount of weapons alongside Juju.  Combine his being the big man last year and no Ben. . .I think we're in for a fun offensive year, with top tier defense to support.

My dream scenario would be Chase and Diontae on the outsides, Washington becomes the 4th WR.  Chase just seems too big, fast, and coordinated to not have out there.  He reminds me of a Brandon Marshall, Julio Jones style player.  Just heave it and let the big guy do his thing."
I know this sub has given up on Vance Mcdonald but don't forget he played very well with Ben in 2018.
"Ya Claypool aint winning OROTY when there is Helaire, Tua and Burrow and Claypool will likely be our #4 receiver."
"It will be hard to beat out Burrow and Tua (assuming he plays at least 3/4 of the year) being a WR. Especially since he is down in the depth chart, he probably won’t see starting time for a while, providing everyone stays healthy. Ben is probably the favorite for comeback player of the year. There isn’t too much competition. Off the top of my head AJ Green is probably the 2nd best candidate."
His odds were at +300 yesterday so I threw 20 bucks on it. I have faith!
""
Wow they cut Switzer. Even being Ben’s friend won’t help him anymore
"Switzer is gone. Everyone got their wish. 

He just had a baby and bought a house in Pittsburgh. I feel terrible for him."
"Notable cuts:


- WR Ryan Switzer
- NT Daniel McCullers
- S Antoine Brooks
- RB Kerrith Whyte Jr

So McLoud beats switz and Carlos Davis beats big dan. I can dig it."
"McCullers is finally gone. Surprised by this as well. 

Brooks doesn’t really surprise me, he’s a lock for the PS. I guess they really like Allen"
"Carlos Davis makes the team, Ray-Ray, and James Pierre. Cool"
Who’s the OLB we signed as UDFA? Pierre something? Guess he really showed up if both Skipper and Elliot are cut in favor of him
Ray- Ray is one of the biggest surprises for me
Switzer and Big Dan Mcullers are the two most surprising cuts. I assume Switzer will be back though once his injury is healed.
"Big dan being cut is sad. He lasted for years as a sixth round pick and has progressed every year and is down nearly fifty pounds since then. Carlos davis better be worth it.

Cutting Antoine brooks jr, this years sixth round is disappointing. 

Cutting switzer in favor of fuckin McCloud is a joke."

Thanks.
"Really surprised we cut Brooks, Jr. I thought he was gonna compete for that 3rd safety spot with Dangerfield"
Didn’t Carlos Davis make the roster?
Only suprises here for me was JC given Wisnewski can play center and Cain getting cut over ray-ray. Inside linebacker depth scares the shit out of me but I'm hoping they use Allen as depth there.
get ready for a run heavy team perhaps? heard matt canada was bringing something interesting in that regard. there's a lot of people in that rb room.
More or less what I expected.  Given the potential talent of the new guys in the WR corps I'm not that surprised Switzer was cut.  I never thought he was bad but definitely never considered him amazing either.
We've released Dan McCullers ?
This actually looks like a pretty fuckin good team.

"My biggest headscratcher is Marcus Allen still being here, I thought he looked awful last preseason. They really want this guy to work out for some reason."

Maybe we can snag a reliable back up at some point. Call me a hater but I’m not sold on this team if Ben doesn’t return to form. Rosen is low risk high reward since he isn’t much worse than the two backups we currently have. If the Jags tank and get Lawrence I also wouldn’t mind seeing if we could snag minshew next year

Then again a little competition can never be a bad thing.  And who knows, maybe Colquitt might give a few pointers?

Also, Dustin Colquitt has a brother, a cousin and a father who were all NFL punters.  Legs certainly run in that family."
His dad won superbowls with us!
"We may not have another Bradshaw, Lambert, or Ham on the field with us again but looks like there’s a good chance we’ll see a Colquitt again! 

It’d be cool if he took his dad’s old number too."
AYE! I called this. Nice very excited to see another Colquitt in Pittsburgh. Hope he makes the cut. Need a change in punting

"either way we'll punt from the 45 and it will end up on the 20 yard line for a net punt of 25, happens al the time"
I made several post about him no one commented on them I wanted to bring him in as soon as chiefs cut him. He's the son of a steelers legend punter he's had nothing under 44.4 yards since 14 years. He was on chiefs for 20 years finnally got a ring. His brother got a ring with the broncos. There all great punters.

"The move saved the Steelers $890K. Davis was not good at NU (I am a Nebraska fan) and even though Big Dan was not even average, he was nowhere near the talent level of Davis. 

So is this the end of Big Dan and the Steelers? Maybe not. Shadetree could come back on the veteran's minimum benefit (VMB). What is it? In a nutshell, it is a way for teams to hold onto veterans and to pay them their salary but the full salary does not count against the salary cap. 

Riley is an example. (We did it for years with Gradkowski and LS Warren) Riley earns $910K this year but only counts $750K against the cap. 

Do not bury him too fast."
I’m not so sure. The cap savings are minimal with roster displacement. The real cap money came from Decastros restructure and a potential Cam extension.

this just makes me wonder how the steelers would have done with him last year
"Great pickup. Ben/Mason/Duck are all 3-to-5 step, stand-in-the-pocket QBs. Ben won't be scrambling as much as he used to. Dobbs gives us a different look. Could even see him doing some wildcat, Taysom Hill-style stuff. Way better option for that than some of the trick crap Fichtner has tried recently. Can likely also emulate Lamar's style in practice. 

Duck will have a great story for his kids/grandkids about his time as a Steeler QB in the 2019 season."
RIP Duck

"For what I did not like about Sean Davis as a starter, I really did like the idea of him back as the number 3. Can fill both safety roles, has some history of playing in the slot, and would be a very good option in some sub packages. 

Doesn’t have much by the way of special teams snaps, but if he is willing to be a participant there to stick around the league for a while...he is about as good a backup as you can get."
The improper use of whom makes me want to die
Super happy about this honestly. Davis was never a great starter but he's fantastic depth that can play basically every role in the secondary if need be.
Glad to have him back. If he could just work on his hands he could really succeed in this league.
All we need to do now is get Colquitt

"I was thinking about why the Steelers haven't signed Heyward, could it be that they plan to extend Bud Dupree and let Cam walk? If so, which situation has better upside at this moment (I understand a lot can change once the season starts)?

&#x200B;

I admit I am not someone who completely get's the nuances of the salary cap, so this may be irrelevant.

&#x200B;

EDIT: WE SIGNED HEYWARD LETS RIDE!!!!"
"Probably not, unless Cam is dead set on playing somewhere else. Heyward is a, if not the leader of the defense and has much more value outside of on field performance compared to Bud. I think it’s more likely that Cam takes a pay cut more than Bud does, seeing as he’s already played for 10 years, but it’s also possible he wants to cash out once more. 

Personally I’d rather see Heyward re-signed over Dupree."
Not one I want to live in
It's not like they don't want to sign Heyward but more of getting that sweet spot with his demands. He isn't cheap and with the uncertainty of the cap space for next year there's some doubt. They'd like to keep Dupree but why would they want to pay a whole lot of money for Dupree who has been great for 1 year and average to above average the rest with Highsmith who's right behind him vs Cam who has shown multiple years that he can ball out and be a force on that line.
"If you accept the notion that there are an infinite number of dimensions, then yes, there is a world out there where Dupree stays and Cam Heyward leaves.  

But also consider there is a world where Artie Burns is a perennial pro bowler, and even a world where Mason gets suspended for beating Myles Garrett over the head with Myles's helmet claiming Myles called him ""Cracker."""

So we gained a 5th that we ended up using in the minkah deal that also netted us a 4th and that became McFarland 👍🏼
if we still had Dobbs last year we make the playoffs

"Might have been a tactical decision but that was Duck, man. He was there for us during some of our worst. :( Like taking a small piece of the Steelers' soul and waiving it. F"
"THiS iS a CaSe Of DuCk pRiViLeGe -Stephen A. Smith, 2020"
Honestly he has one of the best personalities but I understand.
Y’all took that Duck meme way too far
We are trying to win games ya know
"What did we expect, he was a third string and dobbs was our #2 not long ago. Sucks that the memes are gonna die, but this is an overall great move"
u/vredditdownloader
The only one to ever do it. Hopefully he comes back soon.
Why was Stephen A having such a bad day?
"I’m wearing the Hodges jersey I got for Christmas during every game. Granted I got it because my mother thought he was a legit super star QB who I was a fan of, but still, I’ll honor his name proudly"
""
"oh yeah, its all coming together"
"He is great as safety depth, and really wasn’t that bad. Had some blunders, but also our defense wasn’t great at the time he played there, so he was often forced to make tackles he shouldn’t have had to make. 

I am betting in a reduced role, on a much better defense, he is going to look like a different player."
"I’ve been unnecessarily hard on Sean Davis, but in all honesty, I could see this working in certain sub-packages. Davis can play both safety positions, and he is FAST as fuck. Maybe having him work with Minkah can help him. 

Now just go get MBC back and we can have the band back together."
I like him much better than Riley...this is an upgrade to the fringes of the roster and special teams
We’d probably see Sutton at safety before Davis if one of the two starters goes down. Sutton is a much better asset in pass coverage.

"The bills game was kinda ugly, but he gave us a spark when we needed it most. Goodbye, Duck. I hope you fly and land somewhere."
Duck out-dueled Baker Mayfield and for that I will always be grateful
Fly high Duck. Thanks for everything!
He'll be back on the PS
"He was here for a good time, not a long time"
Duck won against 2 first overall picks two weeks in a row.
"I’ll never forget his game against the Chargers. My family and I were there that day and it is one of my favorite memories. Thank you, Duck"
Super fucking surprised over this. I really liked Duck and was super impressed by his ability to steam roll Kitchens and Wilks.

Sad quack quack
I'm off to the Strip to buy up all the 90% off inflatable rubber ducks. Gonna make a 'duck' pontoon boat in his honor.
Duck Hodges and Herb Waters.  Two of the greatest legends to ever don the black and gold.
It was a short love affair but... it's me not you!
That chargers game was my favorite last season. Quack
Cut the wrong QB
QUACK QUACK QUACK
Quack
It was a fun time.
Ducks fly together
Wait... what
Resigned to the practice squad...as per KDKA TV
Seems like a lateral move
I still got My Hodges flair
I saw my first Steelers game in years last season (vs. Chargers) and the duck pulled out a win.  He stepped up and has all the grit we would expect of a Steeler.  I hope he lands a job somewhere as a backup/bodyguard.
🦆🦆🦆
I will miss him as well. Go Browns! 🤕
I’m pissed as hell. Dude bails us out last season and we just toss em for Dobbs who has no clutch capability?
"Who cares, Duck and Mason are not the future. They both suck."
"Yeah like when he sucked ass and couldn’t complete a 3rd and long for his life, I’ll sure remember that"

"He’s the hero Pittsburgh deserves, but not the one it needs right now. Quack on to greener pastures, Duck. Your heart will be missed"
Always a fighter
God tier shitpost
He's not washed like the other 2. He could definitely be a Gardner Minshew elsewhere. Someone else will love their new Duck.
"I'm not saying KC is a time traveler astrophysicist...but...
1) trade dobbs knowing that big Ben had a long standing elbow issue needing surgery.
2) Ben's injury makes steelers 1st pick a lot more valuable. Dolphins bite, thinking they are getting a top 8 pick. Plus the fifth rounder for dobbs.  Now we have franchise safety Minkah Fitzpatrick.
3) Dobbs could have easily got 1 or 2 wins over Rudolph and Duck, steelers would have made the playoffs resulting in much lower draft picks. Instead we have mid round picks. 
4) KC gets Mapletron and Highsmith, protecting against losses of Juju and Bud.
5) Dobbs returns to the team (trust the plan). Now with Minkah, Mapletron, and Highsmith and a surgically repaired Big Ben.

[Cue x-files music]

What if KC knew Ben needed surgery before the season and orchestrated this mini tank to restock the franchise? It would have gone better if it wasn't for that plucky UDFA qb who won games he wasn't supposed to."
">Dobbs could have easily got 1 or 2 wins over Rudolph and Duck

Ahem: https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/mike-tomlin-after-loss-to-raiders-we-probably-couldve-put-ben-roethlisberger-back-on-the-field-sooner/"
"Bill Belichick: trades a 2nd round pick for a guy that had 20 catches in his time with the team.

KC/Tomlin: trades a backup QB for a draft pick that’s used in the trade for Minkah and then still gets that QB back the next season for less than he was paying him.

Tell me which franchise is run better."
"Dobbs better emulates a mobile qb like Jackson which is important to have right now. No one wants him now so why not? We’re talking the third qb here. It makes sense right now, it doesn’t have to be 4d chess"
[deleted]
Before we throw our shoulders out jerking ourselves off let’s take into account that if Dobbs was still on the team there is a good chance we were a playoff team. Can’t tell me he is worse than Duck. Can’t be much worse than Rudolph either.
Repost
"That’s all fine and good I guess, but Dobbs sucks and will never be anything more than a mediocre backup"
With the recent moves I believe RB is our only weakness due to JC injury issues. I wasn’t sold on Snell last year and don’t get all the hype for him. Tell me why I’m wrong.
"You're wrong because our RB's are just fine.

Conner has proven he's more than good enough when healthy, which even injury prone, is more than half the time.

Benny Snell projects to be the latest in a long line of underwhelming rookie Steeler RB's who were drafted into a system that the coaches believe they'll excel in, then gets trained up between years one and two and returns to be surprisingly beast-like.

Derek Watt brings all-situational ability to produce in every phase of the game that Rosie Nix never could have dreamed of possessing, and will surprise with the amount of touches he sees this year, in addition to the obvious value he brings to other phases of the game.

And the other two guys are nice and versatile.

It's a good, solid, grade B running back corps in a league where a C or a C- is good enough."
Three words: Benny Snell Football
I thought Snell showed a lot of promise running against stacked defenses and no passing game.  With him reportedly losing weight and adding some burst I think he’s very much worthy of some hype.  I’m excited to see him play.
"Remember when Le'Veon Bell was extremely underwhelming as a rookie? Same with James Conner. Both lost weight, and were completely different players. Well, Benny Snell cut weight too"
"If you ever watched him destroy Penn State you understand Benny Snell football, and that’s coming from a Penn State fan"
I agree with not being hype for snell tbh. I actually have more hope for Connor and McFarland as #2
O line is probably the weakest link in the team
"Even if you aren’t sold on Snell (I think he’s good depth, don’t see him as a bell cow yet tho), Ant Mac was highly regarded entering this draft, and has only impressed in camp. That three-heading attack is going to be amazing if we go to RBBC. Add Watt who is the best all around FB we’ve had in years (sorry Rosie) and Samuels who is maybe my least favorite player on the entire roster is still okay and very versatile"
"Snell seemed better as a feature back as opposed to RBBC. When Conner gets hurt again, Snell should get full time reps as opposed to splitting time with other randos. If we don’t give Snell the reps he needs to thrive, we should trade him and focus on AMJ"
""
LAC Duck game was my favorite
"He was there for us when we needed him.

I hope he remembers he was a starting quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers. No one could ever take that away from him.

Fly duck fly"
"Here’s looking at you, kid.


We’ll always have Cleveland."
""
""
"There's still 2 spots left and vets get opened tomorro. I'd have to double check, but I think Duck is considered a vet because he was active for more than 9 games last year, or maybe he still has to clear waivers. He could be one of the options, Switz could be the other. 

Or maybe two people we don't expect. We shall see"

"He should still qualify as he was not cut by the Steelers before signing with the Football Team, and if he does that’s a 5head move by Colbert"

"He was alright as a SS as a young buck.  At least better than as a FS.  Edmonds must be a little nervous. ""That's Minkah's replacement not mind"""

[deleted]
Do you guys think dean Davis will get significant playing time this year. I know we have Edmonds and Minkah. But in the short amount of time we had Davis in the defense was significantly better than when he was injured in the patriots game last year. I think we could possibly play him back with minkah while putting Edmonds in the box in certain packages to do what mark Barron did last year.
It depends how much we use 3 safety sets. We’ve wanted to do this for years but never had the talent/health. I could see us going 3 safeties as much as 20-25% of the time. Otherwise he is just the top backup at both spots and won’t play unless Minkah or Edmunds is injured.
Yeah I think he'll get a decent amount of play time. The team loves 3 safety looks and used them a good bit with Kam Kelly. I can only imagine they're gonna use it even more with a competent safety in Sean Davis.
"I think it depends on how you define ""Significant.""  I think he'll get more playing time than Kam Kelly did last year.

I also realize that the Steelers still seem to have not quite figured out the dimebacker position.  Ulysses Gilbert is an option.  They've apparently been looking at Marcus Allen as an option in that role too.  Antoine Brooks, with more development, might be able to handle the job in the future.  I think this signing gives them another option as they can play Davis at SS and then move Terrell Edmunds to the Dimebacker role if they need to.

If the Steelers find that last option is best, Davis could see fairly significant playing time."
Drop Edmunds to ILB and keep davis at the safety role is our best move.
"Sutton proved to be everything we expected of Davis. Minkah even more so. If hes used, itll be because of injuries."
I’ll be honest. I hope this guy never sees the field.
I still can't get over how he bulldozed Joe jaden costing him the interception. The play  Joe jaden played keenan allen perfect. He was in front of him played him perfect and  perfect position easy interception. Then as he's catching the easing interception he gets bulldozed by sean davis ball goes flying keenan catches it easily touchdown. Since they were in the end zone. Can never get over that play.

"I will expand more on this in a live podcast tonight so will just gloss over my three points. 

Matt Feiler still being at left guard is such a bad move. Some people repeat the false narrative that he is a natural guard. This is just plain false information. He spent his sophomore season in college roaming the interior and then spent the next two seasons and most of his NFL career as a right tackle. Now the depth chart has the dreaded ""or"". Has Chuks not started growing into that raw potential we kept hearing about when he was drafted? I just do not have any faith in Banner and his 10 pass pro snaps last year. We have a 38-year-old QB coming off majority elbow surgery with a llllooooonnnnnnggggg history of injuries who will now be protected by one of the two question marks? Was Feiler that good at LG last year? In the Rams game, he was not. It was not Donald that was beating him up, it was Brockers and another guy. Against Donald, he never took him on successfully without a double team help. 

&#x200B;

The next baffling listing is Carlos Davis at DE and Buggs at NT. I believe Davis is a huge mistake to make the roster in the first place but to have him at DE when he has 25 pounds on Buggs is just baffling. The Steelers will see a lot of stud running backs in 2020 and have two undersized NTs is worrisome. 

&#x200B;

I sat down yesterday and dug through the roster trying to figure out who our kickoff returner would be. Anthony McFarland never really crossed my mind because of his one lone kickoff return in college. Sure Tomlin likes to have running backs be kickoff returners but McFarland has no experience. No punt returns and a limited number of receptions is concerning. In 208 touches in college, he did have four fumbles, not a large amount but something to keep in the back of your mind with a player with virtually no kickoff experience. 

&#x200B;

I hope these three concerns are just my mind nitpicking and not actual worrisome things. I guess come Monday night, we shall see."
"Kick returner is Johnson and/or Ray-Ray.

Aaron Donald beats double teams every single game. Don’t use the best pass-rusher in the NFL as a knock on a lineman.

NT is not a critical position to stop the run for this group, it’s more to eat up blockers. The ILBs and hybrid safeties are crucial in that area. Edmunds strength has been run defense and tackling, as well."
"With the way players move around to multiple positions, the depth chart spots are relatively useless"
If this was an attempt to get people to listen to your podcast and hit double digits finally... you failed
Sorry I stopped reading once you all but said feiler isn’t a good G. Did you miss the rams game?
"Size isn't really all that useful for stopping modern run schemes anymore - that's why you see the NFL as a whole shying away from the massive, 2-down space eaters. NFL teams have gotten wise to the fact that you can disrupt both the run and pass with interior pressure and explosiveness. That coupled with the fact that we're talking about guys who are arguably in the #48-#53 range of the roster doesn't have me too worried there."
"Do you have some alternatives?

Dustin Colquitt's next phase of his professional career will take place in a familiar location.

Colquitt has signed with the Pittsburgh Steelers, the team announced Monday. NFL Network's Tom Pelissero reported it's a one-year deal.

Colquitt's 15-year run with the Kansas City Chiefs ended after he helped them win a Super Bowl when the team released him in late April, and he was without employment until Monday. He's returning to football with a franchise near and dear to his family's lineage.

Colquitt's father, Craig, punted for the Steelers from 1978-1984, winning two Super Bowls in that span of time. Colquitt's brother, Britton, played for the Steelers' AFC North rival Cleveland Browns from 2016-2018 before moving on to the Minnesota Vikings in 2019.

Now, there will again be a Colquitt in the division, this time punting for a team that hopes to do what Colquitt's father and his teammates achieved in the 1970s. They'll hope Colquitt can bring some of the magic he's used to send 462 punts inside the opposing 20-yard line to the Steel City in 2020"
"Yes finnally I been making posts about him in this subreddit since he got cut, no one commented not one. People don't realize his dad won 2 Superbowl with us, has two sons one former chief who we singed who play for chiefs 14 years never less then 44 yard. 14 years to be a sb champ. His birth with the broncos also a Superbowl champ. There a dynasty of hall of fame punters. Their grandpa was a really good kicker at alabama but and fro the military his cousin a kicking or pining legend at tennessee. We have the best punter of all time LETS GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"After this week it seems like people are either on the side of Greg Roman is the reason for success and we should keep him and consider moving on from Jackson or people are saying Jackson is fine, but needs a new OC. Things are gonna get ugly if we don't start winning again"
"It‚Äôs both Lamar isn‚Äôt fully a pro passer yet, and Romans passing concepts are uninventive, and at the same time he abandons the bread and butter too soon.  Oh also don‚Äôt fully blame Roman for the passing game that‚Äôs on David Culley."
I see it more as a Flacco v. Cameron
"""Start winning again"" you make it sound like we're on a 5 game losing streak!"
I don‚Äôt understand how you can watch the Ravens play and not realize the team is riding on Lamar Jackson.
"I think there's a little of both. I dont think you can reasonably deny theres been some poor decision making in lamars part in the last couple games, as well as some less than accurate throws. And there's also been some questionable situational play calling happening. The problem here is that everyone is panicking. Were a 5-2 team, and we would be 6-1 if we had limited penalties and turnovers in that game without question. Were just fine. R E L A X"
"The issue is that when you look at the play style of Lamar and how Roman guides his offenses, the two on paper should be a match. Lamar is a versatile type of QB who is average in terms of accuracy and above average at reading defenses (He has had his fair share of mistakes though). Roman consistently holds the top running offenses and has coached a QB similar to Lamar (kaepernick).

The issue is that Roman is trying schemes that don't fit Lamar's play style. This year Lamar has looked uncomfortable passing and our O-line hasn't helped with giving him time. 

My take is that Roman is the issue here. He has never been able to be the OC for a passing team and lacks the ability to create schemes that help out mobile QB's that have average accuracy. Either stick with what works or get rid of him. Roman has the ability to be amazing, but can't seem to figure out how to coordinate a pass offense."
"I‚Äôm not in the anti-Lamar Jackson camp outside of thinking he‚Äôs on a downturn currently, but I don‚Äôt think most people in that grouping actually want to move on from LJ. I could be wrong."
we all know damn well with Flacco still as QB this team would be the most boring average team ever. Probably sitting at 5-3 and only because most of our competition this season is mediocre. Roman needs to go I think most of us can agree

Bruh can we not talk about politics in here this is supposed to be our escape from stuff that actually matters
Who cares? Go to r/conservative and blow your wad there. No one wants to talk politics here.
In many ways Joe Biden represents everything that is wrong with the NFL. Just as many ways as both represent the worst of the US.
Keep America great!

"These are well done.  Just one comment though it says 2nd in AFC north and 4th in afc.

It should be 5th in afc. The tits get the 4th seed with the tiebreaker.  Then the Ravens win the tiebreaker with the Colts so Ravens get 5th, Colts get 6th and Browns get 7th"

Harbs is a little cagey with the media. That's what's up.
"But, a rear-view mirror would've helped his grandfather."
He's the same Lamar at the end of the day. If he has a great next two games is he back? And if he has a bad game after that has he regressed again?
"I think after watching this video, Harbaugh has officially become an ""old guy"" in my eyes lol. The way he tells the story by giving the most pointless details about who else was there and who they were related to and getting kinda tripped up with the names along the way üòÇ"
What is the time stamp?
"They should have followed up with, ""so where are you going?"""
"Seriously, there‚Äôs so many people who seem to practically creaming themselves over how Lamar played, saying that they‚Äôve never understood why people think he‚Äôs good, his MVP award was wrong, and that we should just trade him. I don‚Äôt get all the hate, it‚Äôs really disheartening."
It happens every time lamar has a bad game
Let me know who the fuck said we should trade Lamar so I can throw chicken tenders at their stupid ass
"Two factors.

First, Lamar set the bar real high last year. Hard to measure up to historic greatness every single game.

Second, there are a lot of fucking hateful idiots out there."
"He had a bad game, with 4 turnovers, we still lost by one score and ran it for 300 yards against the best run defense in the league and a teamthat hasn'tbeen figured out yet by anyone. Without 4 starters in the second half. And still 5-2, What exactly do we have to complain about"
"Those fans can go kick rocks, they would have jumped on the Steelers bandwagon if we were still in the Boller era with Boller throwing to 'Clank hands' Taylor."
"I‚Äôm not defending it, but the last game Lamar played before this one was against the eagles, he played some good plays, but not great."
"At this point its whatever to me. People can call Lamar whatever. People called Joe shit forever, and rightfully so sometimes, that I dont care. Hes my quarterback. I am confident in his abilities as a leader and as a player. Im tired of tryna defend him in whatever thread. He will win us a superbowl. He fucks up sometimes. It was a steelers game. Multiple turnovers are expected. Shitty reffing is mandatory. This happens almost every time we play them yet this time people are shocked? Feel like we got a lot of bandwagons."
Fake fans
Like yes he had a bad game (against a great defense) but we still almost won. Take away a few penalties and turnovers and it wouldn't of even been close. Were going to be fine and im looking forward to Thanksgiving!
See... racism in America
"You need to look past those who are suddenly hating on Lamar and those who are highlight issues with this offence (and rightly so). Those that say Lamar isn‚Äôt our future and he‚Äôs trash blah blah - don‚Äôt give them the time of day. 

There‚Äôs a lot to be optimistic about. We show sparks of the team we were last year, and the defence is playing really well. But you can‚Äôt ignore we have issues. Issues that seem to keep haunting us. Lack of consistency. Unable to make big plays when it‚Äôs really needed. I saw some positive signs this game, but we still have these reoccurring issues week after week."
Fuck r/nfl and everybody in it
I‚Äôd still rather have him over like 20 other QBs based off of just skill. If you include his personality I‚Äôd rather have no one else.
"Don't go to r/nfl or watch any of the sports shows, the disrespect is making my blood boil"
I‚Äôve never seen such a polarizing QB in my life bro.
"As a Brady fan, I fucking love Lamar and I will definitely root for him when all is said and done. I'm annoyed he's underperforming. I really want him to succed.

As an Australian fan, I don't really have loyalty to a team. I'm definitely more interested in following players and the Ravens have been my AFC team of the year."
"This is just a side effect of getting a super popular player in his prime. You get a lot of ‚Äúbad fans‚Äù


I‚Äôm mostly just ignoring the stupidity of this sub until the fallout of Steelers game is over because it‚Äôs just a bunch of nonsense.

‚ÄúGreg Roman should be fired and the offense should be scrapped for a traditional offense!‚Äù

Yes because this offense went 14-2 and led the league in scoring last year.
This year it is 5-2 with one of the leagues toughest early schedules, with losses over the defending champions and an undefeated Steelers team that came down to a final possession. This same game the offense moved the ball and scored a lot and basically lost due to giving away so many points on turnovers.

‚ÄúLamar needs to become a traditional passer or we need to consider moving on!‚Äù

Yes, clearly, it would be in this franchises best interest to move on from a reigning MVP who probably had one of the most value added seasons in the history of football because he lost a single elimination playoff series and a home game against the Steelers.


It‚Äôs not like this franchise didn‚Äôt just give record deals to a mediocre journeyman  QB and held the franchise hostage for close to a half dozen years to never even come close to being a top 5 offense in his entire tenure.

B-but that one year he got hot for 4 games in a year the Ravens still had one of the leagues best running games and a pretty good veteran defense!



Yes so it would be a good idea to go back many years of middle of the pack or bottom half offenses to drag out boring defensive minded games, it‚Äôs not like the league has evolved and offensive teams are the ones winning Super Bowls or anything.

Clearly it‚Äôs just so easy to get number one offenses every year especially with almost entirely inexperienced wide receivers who are completely overmatched"
"The guy was unanimous MVP. He made some people look extremely stupid. Some people suck you just have to accept it. 


People overlook it but I think you can‚Äôt ignore the racial aspect as well. Lamar is an unapologetically black QB in the US."
"I imagine Tom Brady got the same treatment, I didn't pay attention because I was too busy hating on him too haha. Seriously though it comes with the territory of being great. Lamar knows this and I'm sure he's itching to get back on the field."
"Obviously people overreact but theres nothing wrong with criticizing poor play from your team. Being unhappy with the way your teams players played in sunday doesn't make you a fake fan or an idiot. It means you have eyes and you know that your team isn't perfect.

People love to hate on lamar because he's an unconventional qb. But that doesn't mean there's not valid criticism about his game when he plays poorly, and he has played poorly this year, especially when compared to last. Theres lots of factors going into it, but he doesn't get a total pass. He hasn't been very good. Hes made some horrible decisions and has missed some wide open passes."
"It‚Äôs going to click for him, and i‚Äôll bet it‚Äôs sooner rather than later, but the o line is going to have to find a way to get him more time. And we weren‚Äôt doing that even before Stanley went down."
"Sadly, I think we have become like the one thing we hate the most, the one thing we swore we would never be, the worst of the worst

Patriots fans"

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/jn01sj)"
"Who fills the role, it sways my vote"
"Our offense has looked a little off but it is NOTHING like it was during the dark days of Cam Cameron's decline, or Marty, or Marc Trestman

Nothing like that

I'm still super surprised any time we have a 3-and-out. It used to be like 25% of our drivers were 3-and-outs

The team isn't as dominant as last year, at least not right now, but god damn please stop bitching"
I still fucking hate cam Cameron
"Make these post stop.

Roman didn't lose us the game against Pittsburgh, that was Lamar."
And the pass game coordinator too
What if Jim Harbaugh came to be OC?
"They just went pretty in depth on AB. He can still be suspended again, he's still facing charges for court in December. If found guilty he makes zero dollars from anyone and he's out of the league. Pretty satisfied after hearing that about him not making it to Baltimore"
"Yeah plus all of those former Steelers people on the buccaneers staff now should make for an environment in which if it's possible for him to succeed again, then it'll be there and nowhere else"
"I feel like we still have a top 3 team in the league. I believe we are better than the Steelers, I believe we can beat the Chiefs and the Seahawks. 

Our issue isn‚Äôt match ups, our issue is 90% coaching. 

Yesterday we played a hell of a game on both sides of the ball, we played Ravens football. We ran for over 250 yards.. we should have ran for 300+ in my opinion. Why did we come out of halftime passing (even if it were play action)? I have no idea.

Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I think the game yesterday vs the Steelers was our most complete game. Outside of 4 turnovers and 9 penalties for over 100 yards we looked really good. We looked like a powerhouse. We looked like the team from last season even losing 3 starters. 

We looked like the better team and had the game handled. Lamar had some very costly turnovers but I love how we fight til the end. Snead played very well, maybe his second best game as a Raven, JK and Gus are beasts and our defense showed up as usual. 

Honestly, I want my team to look how they looked this Steelers game every week. It lets me know that we are still that dominate force from last year but we HAVE to stop committing so many penalties, and we HAVE TO RUN THE BALL. In my opinion we could have broken our rushing record from last year but that‚Äôs neither here nor there.... 

All in all, run the ball, move the chains, force turnovers, win the game. That‚Äôs Raven football.. 

Thoughts?"
"Thoughts?  I disagree that we are better than the Chiefs right now, and I'd point to our recent loss to them as Exhibit A.  And, the way things seem to be going, any other game against them this year would be Arrowhead."
"Yea I agree, and penalties killed us, even if I do think some of them were super soft. Regardless the way we should do things is run heavy, it clearly works even against a defense like the steelers. Also adding a good receiver can do wonders, I trust mark andrews catching the ball 10 times out of 10 but actual WRs we don‚Äôt have much and what we do have they‚Äôre a dime a dozen in this league. Younger guys like duvernay Porche and Hollywood could really thrive with a good veteran wide receiver, I know we just signed Dez but who knows what he‚Äôll look like. Dez 5 years ago give me that all day but now ya never know"
"The problem is we expected the team to take a major step forward versus last year. They are not as good as last year and the identity is still missing on the offensive side of the ball. 

We fire Roman. It's Super Bowl guaranteed."
"You can't be the better team if you lose the game. And even if you wanted to argue that point, who cares? You don't get to the playoffs by being ""the better team"" you get there by winning games. 

In the Division round of the 2000 playoffs, the Titans dominated time of possession and total yards by over 2-1, yet lost the game by two scores. Would you consider them ""the better team"" that game, or even that year? 

I'm not saying we can't win the Super Bowl this year. We certainly can. But until we win the rematch (potentially plural) we can't really say we're the better team right now."
[deleted]
This is the same stuff we were using Paul Kruger for to stop Kaep in the Super Bowl. Hit the QB regardless. Just to let them know you‚Äôre there.
This what teams are going to start doing to us. It‚Äôs part of the game unfortunately
"I mean, he's respecting Lamars ability to keep it and take off which he does a lot, and it wasn't even a rough grab"
""
‚ÄúBut he‚Äôs a disruptive force‚Äù
Great player but has never lived up to the hype his draft performance made for him.
I‚Äôll say it again. If we were going to pay an edge who hasn‚Äôt had a single 10+ sack season we would‚Äôve paid Judon.
There's a Steven Ruiz articles saying the reason Clowney can't finish sack is that he doesn't have the ability to bend in order to get the sack.
"Reminds me of Ziggy last year, dude was available until week 4 this season he was so bad"
"The offseason was brutal cause I kept telling people pressures is a shit stat. A pressure can be anything it can be an incompletion, it can be a completed pass, it can be a pick 6, just a pick, or a td. A sack is definitive there‚Äôs no if‚Äôs or buts it‚Äôs a loss of yards and a lost down."
Everyone knows Clowney isn't a sack machine. Go look at his stats.
Still rather would have had him over Judon...
Thanks captain hindsight. Who knows what we may have done without you

"Nothing new but the pass game in general has been a problem.  

Offensive line hasn't and will not be able to adequately pass block, especially against quality fronts.  Receivers can't get open consistently and the lack of rubs and motion in the offensive game plan is of prehistoric proportions. Add all that up to an unwillingness to push the ball down field and all adds to a pass game that didn't need any help to not go backwards with a limited pre season for a QB that needs all the reps he can get.

Run game is brilliant but the coaching staff refuses to rely on the run game and Lamar is clearly not having a very good season as a passer. 

Long story short, offense needs to focus on their strengths (running the ball) and use the passing game as nothing more than a compliment to their strength."
Every throw on the run tho
""
There‚Äôs a thing called consistently mediocre.
"Its the Giants, they have to give them *something*"
"Let them sleep, all the way to the superbowl"
"I mean, I know they need to glorify things, but I'd rather here the actual truth about players and their ranks. And not some bs stat about how they are the first of x, y, and z with brown hair, born on Thursday, who touched Obama left shoe. That shit needs to stop."

I like Dez and it's cool and all but that name belongs to Brian Dawkins in this league.
He's a little more humble here so far lol
"As a Ravens Fan, **Weapon X** will always be Dawkins."
Dez Bryant could have a very large impact on our seasons success
He doesn't move like that anymore lol

I fucking love Dez Bryant

* Low down from Aaron on intensive protocol after Humphrey's positive COVID test"
[deleted]
I feel like people are just waiting for any excuse to absolutely shit on the guy or he‚Äôs the greatest to ever do it. Like why can‚Äôt we all agree he is a good QB with room to grow and he can make you look stupid if he scrambles ?
"Media hung him out to dry before he even got into the league, he's black and a QB and he plays for us. That's why."
"I posted something in r/nfl about Snead accounting for half of Lamar's yards in that game and someone came along and was like ""oh lol so like 13??"" (Never mind that, bad performance aside, he threw for more yards than Ben.)

There's being critical and then there's living in a different reality."
"Lamar Jackson can't just lose a football game. Every time its the end of his career because he's been ""solved"" or ""blueprinted"". I can't think of any other player who gets that treatment."
"I think a lot of people love him to death. 

You have to admit, he looked like crap in the playoffs. Looked like crap against the chiefs on Monday night and turned the ball over 4 times against the Steelers."
"He has an exciting style, but he also makes mistakes.  There's things for people who love him and people who hate him to use to support their arguments.  And a lot of people are just so unreasonable about it.  There are folks that couldn't give Lamar credit last year when he was destroying, and there are people who want to shift the blame for his terrible performances since January onto everyone else."
"The comment I saw after last game that seemed to ring true:

He's the only QB that has to prove himself in every game."
"He is a great QB and such an exciting player. 

He draws a lot of attention because of how exciting he is. With that said I really don't think he gets any more criticism than any other QB does. 

QBS always oscillate between the greatest thing since sliced bread to a POS. It comes with the job."
"Last year it was probably the fact that he became MVP as a QB playing an unconventional style that made a lot of media heads/folks look silly. This year I think its leftovers from that as well as the fact that the expectations bar is raised for him now coming off the MVP. I doubt anyone was really expecting back to back MVPs, but compared to last year he just looks less confident and is making uncharacteristic mistakes.  When you reach a certain level of success, expectations do go up."
"Several reasons: 

1. He is black and a lot of racists just cannot handle that. Nothing he can do about that. 


2. The media narrative has always been that he is a good athlete who cannot throw. While I personally don't believe that is true and he has IMO made a lot of good passes in the past, he also has had his share of really bad throws. 


3. He has not looked good in playoff games in past seasons and in games against teams with a good record this season. This is a somewhat fair criticism, though the Titans game was not on him IMO. 


4. Until a QB wins it all, he will always get unfairly criticized in the media for not being able to win it all. Remember how Payton Manning was called a choker cause he could not win a playoff game in his first years in the league? Remember the constant Flacco discussions? This will - if Flacco is any indication - never go completely away sadly. I mean even among our fanbase there are still those who claim that Flacco never was a good QB etc. so those will always be there. 

5. Some of our fans got super cocky and brigaded other subs / the main NFL subreddit. This will always generate hate and lets not act as if we are immune to it ourselves. I bet we all hate Patriots fans more than we hate Bellichick for example."
You could right an entire dissertation on it tbh. So much goes in it from confirmation bias to racial considerations to the resistance to change. It's honestly a fascinating topic.
"He's had the highest highs and the lowest lows of just about any QB in the league. He's been unanimous MVP. He also had the worst playoff performance you could imagine vs. the chargers. Even this season, he dominated the Browns, then looked horrible in our losses to KC and Pittsburgh."
"He hasn‚Äôt looked good this season, but I don‚Äôt blame that all on him. I think some is the play calling and some is the offensive line. But the PIT loss was mostly on Lamar. I agree with others that people are looking for reasons to trash him that‚Äôs why he has to over-perform. It‚Äôs not fair but that‚Äôs the reality. He has to win big games"
Because he‚Äôs a black quarterback.  That simple
He's black. He talks how white people think black people sound like. His name is Lamar and not John or Kyle.
"I hate it. I really fucking hate it. Like let him be him, which is a good QB."
"It is because he is black and unapologetically lives his culture.  He wears chains, he hangs out with Kodak, he is the coolest QB I have ever seen but people don't like it.  It is so shitty."
[deleted]
It obviously was an accident you meat head
Were we watching the same game? He rolled backwards into Stanley‚Äôs leg. How in the world can you call that dirty?
Watt is dirty af. But that was clean. He essentially got thrown into Stanley.
Dave from Salisbury... is that you?!
wtf happened to this sub lmao
I didn't see anything dirty in this game. Last year in week 17 was a different story. Pretty sure there was a hit out on RG3's head.
"Ravens didn't lose to the steelers, and the steelers didn't beat the Ravens. The Ravens lost to themselves. That game should've been our game. All we can do is learn from it and drive on to next week."
">All we can do is learn from it and drive on to next week.

Yet here you are, on Tuesday, still posting about it."
[deleted]
"It's Tuesday, man. Let it go haha. In similar words of a coach up north, ""We're on to Indianapolis"""
Ok but we lost
"Come off it, man."
"We all know he didn't play his best ball, but the more I think about it the more I get excited about one aspect in particular. 

Lamar gets a lot of flak for not showing up in big games, tilting easily, getting panicky, and not being able to overcome a deficit. Our first pass of the game was a pick 6. We essentially started the game down 7.  I think in days past, that would have resulted in a quick spiral of 3 and outs until the game was out of hand. We have seen it before especially in our losses to the Titans and Chiefs.

Instead, Lamar responded on the very next drive with poise bringing us right back down the field for a score. That is a massive step in his mental game. Yes, other mistakes were made like holding onto the ball too long but I feel those were disconnected from the game script and can easily be coached up."
What about that TD run that was called back?  He didn't flinch.  Shook it off and called his team back to the huddle.  I love his competitiveness.
"The game showed some of our best football this season. When we had that period of dominating runs, then hit Andrews in a nice gain with a play action, THAT‚ÄôS the type of football we need to play. But then, just like all other weeks, we decided ‚Äúnah, let‚Äôs try something else‚Äù and we saw the same problems crop up again just like previous weeks. I genuinely don‚Äôt know why this is happening. But it‚Äôs holding us back and we will pay the price for it down the line."
There is NOTHING wrong with Jackson that experience won‚Äôt cure.  He is a top level quarterback and he will keep the Ravens in the hunt for the next ten years.
"If we start out with a pick six, come back and take the lead, and have the game come down to the last few seconds of the 4th quarter against an undefeated team with the top ranked defense in the league....

I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs not the worst day."
Had our best and worst in a single game. Lamar is fierce and young. I‚Äôm very excited about the future of the team.
"He came back twice in that game.  

The TD pass to Boykin was next level, not all QBs can do that.

The pass down the middle to Duvarney, while high, was a strong pass to an area of the field he is statistically bad at passing.

His option reads were great.  Each time pitching it to Dobbins and getting the most out of the yardage.

He needed more touch on the screen pass (2nd play of the game) and the pass to Hollywood in the corner of the endzone (not an easy pass).

One thing I have noticed is with the presnap movement (which the ravens do more than anyone), Lamar is often worrying that the players are getting to where they need to be and not necessarily takin in the defense, for instance motioning them with his hand.  Now I realize that the movement often helps determine zone/man defense, but I would like to see Lamar ""Truzz"" his players will get to the right place and take that time to better recognize the defense in front of him.

Also, not every pass has to be a highlight.  He needs to trust the short pass.  If you get 4 yards every down you are doing alright."
Also when his td got called back on a holding and he just waved it off and scored right quick. He didn't let that tilt him either.
"> Yes, other mistakes were made like holding onto the ball too long but I feel those were disconnected from the game script and can easily be coached up.

This has been one of the weird things of this year that I don't understand after last years MVP performance. Everything we did was based off the threat of the run. Passing lanes opened up because every play could be a run and no one knew who it would come from. 

Our offense this year stepped away from that identity and instead seems to be trying too hard to show that we can pass with the big boys. Lamar seems to always be looking for the big plays, which isn't a bad thing (especially after YEARS of check downs), but we dominated last year because we held the ball forever. And the reality is that our o-line, our receivers, and our scheme just aren't good enough to rely on passing.

Our best drives against the Steelers supposed number 1 rush defense were when we ran it down their throats every play. Force their defense to come up, force someone to spy Lamar, our guys will get open for big plays in due time. The added benefit is we keep their O off the field and let our defense rest. If we're always going for a big pass play we lose that key part of our game. 

Lamar is young and hungry and he has games like this one where he makes some big mistakes. But he's also the reason our offense is successful at all and it just seems GRo forgets that at times."
"I think this game showed that we are capable of playing from behind, and we would've won if it wasn't for key mistakes"
"This is definitely a good point, and shows some progress from bad games we've had in the past. 

Another positive is that the second pick and the fumble were both careless, but easily coachable moments. I feel they'll stick in Lamar's head as a reminder and those turnovers don't happen in the future."
My guy scored 3 td‚Äôs in 3 plays on a drive 1 called back for the ‚Äúhold‚Äù 2 Hollywood was in for sure. And then came right back to him for a score.
I will always upvote some positive vibes in the flock
This game was some of the best football he played all season long but also the worst football he played all season long.  He made the lost tight window throws he‚Äôs ever made but at the same time had at least 7 turnover worthy passes.
Exactly what I've been saying! A lot of good things to be excited about.
"> We all know he didn't play his best ball 

He played his worst game of his career. You can't play any worse than that game. That is the compliment and positive note in my opinion. Valuable tape and lessons learned. His poise and response to the deficit etc. are what any good quarterback SHOULD always do. 

I am Lamar fan and supporter, but there isn't really any sugar coating this one...Onto the Colts in what should be a bounce back game and a real test against a top defense once again. Should be a good one...

We will also get to see our secondary without Humphrey...Makes me happy knowing we have Jimmy and Peters out there"
"Yup, he's still young and needs more experience. But, imo, he's at a good place for the level he's at now."
For sure man. For me it clearly showed were the best in the division. They only won that game because we gave it to them.
"Another thing I‚Äôm seeing that gives me hope is when he gets flushed from the pocket he‚Äôs not immediately taking off, he‚Äôs looking to throw first.  Now, that has led to some terrible looking throws and some bad decisions, but he seems to realize that his future lies in being a pass-first QB.  If he continues to work like this in-game and in the offseason like we‚Äôve seen, I feel good about him leading this team for years to come."
Lamar Cool
except we did almost go 3 and out but the steelers got called for a questionable late hit which let the drive stay alive
"It's not how you start; it's how you finish. In this case, if Lamar's first three years of his career can start this way, I'm very optimistic about how it will finish. After last year's MVP campaign, there was literally nowhere to go but down. In a way, it's nice to be able to pinpoint areas in need of improvement. And we already know he will improve."
"Fire Roman. He's holding this offense back from evolving. It happened in SF. It happened in Buffalo. It must happen again in Baltimore. 

Fire Roman... **Super Bowl guaranteed.**"
"This year guys are missing blocks that were made last year as well as dropping passes they caught and so on...including that throws that were on the money last year but are now a foot or two off the mark...the downside to having an almost perfect year is that there is only one way to go. He cares and works hard, he will work it out. Just gotta play within himself and not try to win the superbowl on every play."
What about the fumble in the red zone and then the disgusting interception to start the second half.
"I know very little about the game, so humor me. My impression is that Lamar is like a gifted Jazzman trying to play along with a classical conductor."
[removed]
I‚Äôm hoping we trade for Marvin Jones jr
"Everyone‚Äôs going to say a new WR and an Olineman. Issue is, there‚Äôs nothing good on OLine remotely available and we don‚Äôt need receivers, we need Greg Roman to be able to draw a play that‚Äôs not a simple post route."
"I doubt Jones gets traded, now that Golladay has a hip injury and is already out for Sundays game."
That would be great but it won't happen because everyone in Detroit is going to lose their job if they miss the playoffs so they can't gut the team and build for the future.
"Alex Mack or Kevin Zeitler plz. 

The interior line gives me headaches."
A bunch of 5th round picks
Evan Engram prolly unrealistic
"Don't make any trades because I have doubts about the ceiling of this team with our injuries and holes.

Just get better and develop our guys ffs. Why does nobody on offense seem like they've gotten better from last year?"
"after saying that if he was building a team, he'd take Burrow over Lamar.  Hot take bs, I hope his inlaws shun him."
"Oh no. He has a differing opinion. Bring out the pitch forks. I like Pete. He always brings love to the Ravens, but he‚Äôs not wrong. Lamar is a unique talent and needs to be used a certain way. Most coaches just want a prototype QB and that‚Äôs okay."
"I think Shannon Sharpe hit the nail on the head with Lamar. He‚Äôs stressing under the pressure of his own press. Once he lets go and be himself & focus on winning, he‚Äôll be elite."
"I don't know, what kind of team is he building? I can imagine a scenario in which a team would benefit more from a player like Burrow over a player like Lamar. I can also imagine the opposite. We're not going to be able to evaluate these guys for at least another 5 years. I personally like Lamar's style of play, but it's not for everyone nor every team."
"It‚Äôs just the normal cycle of lamar. He played well, people hyped him while his haters waited in the shadows. Now that he‚Äôs doing badly, they‚Äôre all coming out along with the hot take artists to make stupid claims for clicks and views. I think we all know burrow isn‚Äôt better than lamar"
I don‚Äôt agree but it‚Äôs a defensible position to take. Stop whining like a bunch of protective girlfriends.
"Which nickname sounds stickier: Big Game Burrow or Big Game Lamar? Yeah, that‚Äôs my worry too. Anyway, fuck it. Go Ravens."
Lamar‚Äôs not a very good passer. Plain and simple. Don‚Äôt hate on facts.
"Year over year we lost our two best offensive lineman for the season(in Yanda's case forever) and we lost our starting LG to a high ankle injury. Through 7 games in 2020 we are ranked 23 by [football outsiders](https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/offensive-line/2020) we were ranked 3 last year. Our offensive line is the biggest change year over year. Rank has plummeted even with Stanley expect it drop further without him.

Have you changed your expectations for Lamar?

What would you help your O-line if your Greg Roman?

What are your expectations for the offense?

We have 3.7 million in cap space if you are Eric Decosta do* you make a move?

edit*(to-->do)"
"We do a terrible job of running screens. It's almost non-existent in our play calling. Watching other teams run RB screens, TE screens , WR bubble screens, etc is so frustrating. I don't know if it's due to Lamar or his comfort level. You could certainly take a lot of pressure off him by running plays that get the ball out his hands quickly.  Our offense is so bland and predictable."
"We have $3M in space, and apparently that doesn't count the mysterious $4M grievance from Earl (Wherever that is rn). In terms of Money, we have no money. We probably already have to restructure just to stay below the cap, and I think they're looking into who's available to determine how much they need to restructure.

Unless you can get a fantastic deal for an OL, you're running OBJ-Bozeman-Skura-???-Fluker. 

For the ???, Phillips probably goes IR for 3 weeks, and you use these weeks to see how good your depth is. Mehkari is going to get first crack, and he's the best option rn. It wouldn't surprise me to see him taking Phillips' job once both are healthy. After that, I'd get Bredson/Powers some snaps to see what they can do. They aren't going to get a better opportunity than this. 

I still think the best option is to find a receiving TE in FA so you can dedicate Boyle to blocking. Why would you have the best blocking TE in the league running routes? Let him do his job and give Lamar extra time."
"Workaccount1800? Is that you, Greg? Is that you Eric? Is that you John? We're watching you üëÄ

But seriously LOL - my expectations haven't changed for Lamar. If you can predict what we're going to do, we can make at least the good teams defense look like they can read us and look like the Ed Reed when he was on our side. 

We need creativity. There are so many things that other teams do that we don't do.

Anyways, I look forward to see the other comments in here."
"No moves. You have to ride out the injuries and adapt. 

The run game was still amazing, despite being down two starters on the O-line. Whatever happens, Roman needs to stop giving up on the run. 5.5 ypc average. 

As for the pass game, you need to get the ball out quicker, whether that be a quick slant or set up screens. We don't need to show the world Lamar can pass from the pocket. I feel that's been a statement that we've been trying to prove ever since his debut. I feel Lamar is an amazing QB, but I'm also under the opinion that his regression is due to Roman not knowing how to develop the passing game for a mobile QB."
"Second play of the game Lamar missed a wr screen to Duverney, we need to practice that until he can hit that 99/100 times. 

Not sure if you guys watched the Giants game but in the third Jones hit a throw back screen to Shepherd I think, where JPP made a td saving tackle. Would love to see that play to Hollywood or Duverney.

We need quick passing to alleviate pressure on the o line. Run blocking looked fine despite injuries."
"You're not going to get an impact lineman on the market at this point, unless you give up very serious talent. I think go with what we've got and build the offense around what they can do: run blocking and quick hitting passes, get the ball to our speedy guys in space. Run blocking is easier and more fun, Fluker in particular is much better at that than pass protection."

"My cousin is a huge pats fan who has clowned Lamar since day one

this was a top 5 cathartic win ever lmao"
LOL I know this isn‚Äôt true because media tells me he‚Äôs not good in big games! /s
lamaR CaN‚ÄôT WIN biG gamES
"I‚Äôm a dynasty player who owns him, curious on actual Ravens fans perspective on him. Does he look decent or like he‚Äôs progressing at all, just not getting opportunity? Or is he someone who the Ravens are probably looking to replace? 

And what about Duvernay? Is he primed to take over Boykin‚Äôs spot? Is no one looking like a guy worth keeping?

Thanks"
Drop him
"I think he's just a replacement-level guy as a pass catcher. A WR4 with maybe WR3 upside someday if everything goes right. He sees a lot of snaps because he seems to block well downfield in our unique offense, but I think he's safe to drop in fantasy. My opinion."
"Boykin has issues actually catching the ball. 

Duvernay is going to be a solid WR in about a year or two. He shows infinite potential."
"Duvernay has more yards than Boykin im pretty sure all purpose, and Boykin is out snapping him by a lot, Boykin has issues catching the ball 

Duvernay is definitely going to become a good WR for us he‚Äôs already decent just depends on when he gets more snaps and plays more

I‚Äôd drop Boykin"
This is not a pass friendly offense. Wouldn‚Äôt count on either of them.
"He seems to just have a problem getting open down field. Plus he greatly lacks chemistry with lamar. He needs to use his size better too. The hard part about evaluating our wrs is that it‚Äôs difficult to tell if lamar is making them look bad, romans pass schemes and playcalling are making them look bad, or if they‚Äôre just bad. It‚Äôs some combo of those 3 but idk what has the biggest impact"
No Ravens receiver does well
"It's the offense.

Even our best WR Hollywood Brown hasn't had nearly as big of an impact as I expected so far this season. As strong and improved as he looked coming off an impressive off-season training regiment...I thought Hollywood would be a beast but unfortunately he hasn't hit his ceiling yet  due to our run heavy system. He has infinite potential though, he caught 5 passes for 100 yards in the first half alone against the Browns week 1, but has been up and down since than and even last week against the tough Steelers he managed a TD with only 2 total targets, and since voiced displeasure for the minimal usage of guys like him and Boykin. 

I like Boykin and think he has a lot of potential, but you can't learn and improve unless you get the chances to do so, and the Ravens #1 receiver is Mark Andrews...Boykin is the 4th or 5th option with Duvernay making plays, and in a run first offense, it's not a great platform for WRs to flourish. 

Brown, and Duvernay have more upside fantasy wise."
"The offense in the air is completely reliant on Andrews as a 1st and 2nd read, Hollywood 3rd and then Boykin for the scramble drill crosser.

He is a typical outside jump ball WR who is in a offense that doesnt do that at all. He will get 30 targets in the year at most. Drop him. Only player that is worth getting in the offense fantasy wise is Andrews in the air game. He will get 100 targets."
"He is a 3rd round pick in his second year... I think people have unrealistic expectations. Typically it takes 2-4 years before 3rd round picks + really become starters. Some examples, Kruger, Bwill, Zadarius Smith, Nick Boyle, Kyle Juice, Rick Wagner, John Simon, on and on and on. Most of them didn‚Äôt have a serious impact until year 3 at the earliest. It is part of the draft and player development. People always have unrealistic expectations of 3-5th round picks. Only 1st rounders really play in their first year, any one beyond that is a huge win. That isn‚Äôt even mentioning all the 3rd round picks that amount to nothing, about 65% league wide are out of the league after their first contract. Andrews and OBj are the exception, not the rule"

""
"If they had any intention of running 3 TE sets this year they would‚Äôve gotten one by now or at least given one of the younger guys from camp at least a few reps in it, sadly. Hope they bring it back next year.

In the case that it does happen, then to answer your question: yes and no. Yes, they‚Äôd likely be grabbing a TE for use simultaneously with Boyle and Andrews and not for depth, but no, the offense doesn‚Äôt magically look as good as last year. Not sure which type of question you were asking."
Hayden Hurst was not the cog that made it all work. It would appear Marshall Yanda was.
No
"I had even realized we haven‚Äôt run the 3-TE formula. 
Definitely think it helps tbh. because then you have to worry about one more person and it opens up everything else"
Bruh TE is the least of our problems we have a top 3 guy in Andrews and another top 15 guy in Boyle... our main focus this off season is beefing up the o line because our o line looks like one of the worst o lines in the league. We got Lamar running for his life like Deshaun Watson has been for the past 4 years. And we need to find a GUY who‚Äôs going to be a number 1 guy for Lamar to go to. I love Hollywood he‚Äôs been great for us but dudes to small and cant beat a guy over the top and he avoids contact. I‚Äôm not sure if he can be our true number 1 guy. TE is the least of our problems
"No.  I don't know how you do that with 40% of your offensive line banged up, a Hall of Fame O'lineman retired and a quarterback who can throw but only sometimes.

Maybe the Ravens should talk Yanda into coming back for the last 8 games and playoff run."

"With the steelers up 2 games on us I highly doubt we‚Äôll catch up to them. I don‚Äôt really care about seeding tho we were #1 last year and look where that took us. Unless we literally go 8-8 we‚Äôre probably gonna make the playoffs, we‚Äôre clearly the best afc team who currently doesn‚Äôt lead their division by a mile. Who knows maybe playing in the wild card and coming in as a disrespected 5th seed nobody expects to do anything will be what we need. It‚Äôs much easier to do well when nobody expects anything good from you"
I think we could run the table if we run the ball and stop playing like fucking morons. Maybe drop anothrr 2-3 games tho if we keep playing like shit.
"I don‚Äôt want to look ahead too much, I‚Äôve already changed my expectations to a high wild card, so hopefully we get a game against a division winner that we can beat (even though we can beat all of them) with ease."

That rushing defense ranking about to go down
Geeez the Colts have 11 INT?!?!?
Surprised to see their rushing defense so high.
"I was wondering why our defensive stats look so weird, then I realized this only includes INTs and not total turnovers. We only have 3 int but our turnover rate has to be pretty high with all the fumbles"
"This is gonna be a rough one. No Marlon, their OLine is one of the best in the league, and their defense is actually not bad"
"31st in sack%. That's the scariest stat here considering we have the most mobile QB in the league. Probably the main reason our passing game has been off this year. Now with Stanley out, I'm terrified"
"Colts offensive line is the best in football, but there weapons are bad outside of there number one receiver.  This game will boil down to the ravens offense vs there great defense.  It should be interesting because the Colts are a zone heavy team.  Oh also forgot by the Colts AY/A (Air yards per attempt) is abysmally low because of Rivers arm so we don‚Äôt have to really fear the big splash plays that change momentum from there offense.  On top of this they turn it over a lot because Rivers still plays like prime Rivers so we should be able to capitalize."
Not gonna lie this game makes me nervous. We are missing some key players and they are solid. I‚Äôm hoping we get the ugly Philip rivers this week
"Looking at their passing defense, should we be worried"
[deleted]
Trade what though? Our 5 draft picks? Our decreasing depth at most positions?
"Nothing, we need to start using the wr‚Äôs we have. We can‚Äôt trade all our future draft picks and expect to maintain success. Stop, why do we need 50 posts asking about trading for a wr. Can we get a megathread or something mods?"
nothing
A receiver won‚Äôt help us unfortunately. We need to look to FA for that.

"This. Harbs needs to tell these guys that they haven‚Äôt done anything and that they need to earn what they want. Biggest example is Harbs sitting Lamar out that last game of the season. For a raw QB like Lamar, he needs all of the reps he can get and again he hadn‚Äôt done anything at that point. What was earned was a first round bye. He‚Äôs not a polished vet with a laundry list of credentials. Lamar himself said that they overlooked the Titans which means that he and others on the team think they are better than they were and then they got buzz-sawed."

Marlon has to self isolate for at least 10 days. he isn‚Äôt playing sunday.

First let's see if there's a game. :(
Who's our starting secondary lineup?? We're gonna get toasted
"Eh, just run 60 times and hold the ball for 45 minutes.

A bit of an exaggeration, but that's how to defend good passing attacks when you're light at DB."
"I just really wish we had our full lineup. Resllyyyy would have loved watching the guys tee off on old man Rivers as he tries his lame ass trash talk lying on his back. Then again, they don't really have any competent receivers so maybe there's still a chance of this.

Real prediction: lots of running against 2 strong run defenses. Probably not the most exciting game, but I'm not too concerned

Wishful thinking: tucker and blank have the ultimate kicker showdown with 10+ 50-yarders scored with only one miss to lose the game. Goggles shatter, tucker laughs, we win. Not like there was any doubt"
"The ‚Äú‚ÄùColts‚Äù‚Äù are not a good team. Stop this negative Nancy shit, the fucking Browns blew them out."
I‚Äôd be shocked with a win after last weeks brutal loss
"Hey flock. Being a fan from Australia means early Monday wake ups and a zombie workday. I work in a trade and my hours (7-3:30) prevent me from watching the games live.

Former PSL owner here and Having to pay for all those preseason games during the boller era stung.
I remember starting to watch the ravens when cundiff has THAT kick. Watching this team is so much more fun than it was then lol
"I will NEVER forget when he was trying to tuck the ball to run and fumbled... by himself... in the open field.


Kyle Boller had a rocket for an arm, but acted as I feel we all would being an NFL QB. Terrified lol"
"Joe was rough a few years before the superbowl as well, absolutely gift wrapped Pittsburgh 2 superbowl appearances"
This pain is nothing. Still a lot of hope from the OG camp
"Or worse, the years before that with a new This One's Gonna Be The Guy, I Can Feel It at QB every year. Only worked with Air McNair."
Kyle Boller shaved at least five years off Todd Heap‚Äôs career.  Heap was *constantly* getting lit up because Boller was leading him directly into defenders.
It‚Äôs so easy to forget how spoiled we are lol. I‚Äôm having a meltdown 5-2. We endured some pretty god awful years in our days
I wish I had more upvotes.
My first year as a football fan was Flacco‚Äôs and Harbaugh‚Äôs rookie seasons. I‚Äôve been spoiled from the beginning =\
Jamal Lewis and the defense helped me cope with the Boller days.
"Gotta say, with a reputation as a offensive mastermind.  Billick‚Äôs quarterback choices were pretty meh."
Lemme tell you tho even thought Kyle Boller made me want to pull my teeth out our defense was so stacked I  still loved watching the Ravens play even when we would win 6-3 or some low scoring game
"I‚Äôm still very salty he wasted, arguably, our best defense of all time."
"It's more that there's an expectancy for us to play well atm tho, it'd feel alot better to lose these games if I felt we were a massive underdog.
But yeah, people who abandon teams through rough periods can gtfo"
I remember as a kid having an Elvis Gerbac jersey. THAT was pain.
If only we would‚Äôve pulled a Josh Rosen while we were drafting with Aaron Rogers on the board.....fucking Mark Clayton
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the truth in this post...
Facts
Love it
I'll never forget MNF in '05 against the Broncos in Mile High. Boller threw a horrendous INT to Champ Bailey on a fade to Randy Hymes. I think it was going into half-time and you could just see the look of disgust on Billick's face. I think he was done with Kyle at that point.
Does anybody remember the famous video of Kyle boller throwing like 60 yards on one knee?
They should have never started him over Chris Redman. Smh
"I remember watching the ravens play the Steelers in the playoffs I believe with Flacco and Willis Mcgahee getting freaking destroyed on our last drive to try to come back and win the game. I remember feeling as if I got destroyed. Other than the Lee evans drop and condiff miss, probably the worst I‚Äôve felt after a loss. 

By the way, did that Gronk catch count as a TD? I didn‚Äôt check but reminded me of Lee Evans which was called a drop. Probably completely diff as I refuse to relive that play lol."
"Kyle Boller is the only quarterback I‚Äôve seen consistently trip over his own feet. Anybody else remember that? Every second or third game, he would have a game where they would snap the ball, he would try to step backwards and just trip over his own feet! He did have those two games against the Vikings and the Green Bay Packers back to back during the holiday season, though."
Preach!
I felt this post too much
Truth
This is absolutely facts
Don't forget Elvis Grbac and the shadow of Randall Cunningham in 2001. Followed by the Chris Redman and Jeff Blake show in 2002.
Or the Redmond phase or the heart break of Steve McNair not returning and then getting killed that summer by his mistress.
Those were the first games I remember.
Yup
Madden Kyle Boller was a nightmare. He'd out run Vick and out throw Farve.
I made Kyle Boller 99 in Madden during that era.
"I'm a younger Ravens fan. Being a huge Eddie George fan i followed the Titans for abit.  When Air McNair and a few other titans(Mason, Rolle) went to the Ravens i followed them. Been a fan ever since. Love our team and the fans as a Canadian its on my bucket list to attend a home game and cheer on our boys. RIP #9 üíú"
I WAS HIS NEIGHBOR WHEN I WAS A KID! I got his autographed rookie card and gave it to a friend after they shipped him to the Raiders
We don't speak of those times. The things I would have done to help us get anyone else.
Touche!
K. Boller should've faced criminal premeditated murder charges the way he use get the WRs and TEs killed.
Don‚Äôt forget the short Anthony Wright stint.
I started watching the NFL the year he left
Sitting in that stadium for years watching him and just drinking heavily because the shit on the field was horrible.
Or the Elvis Grbac ~~era~~ error.
"Why do we call them the Joe years? Joe wasn‚Äôt the problem with the team Ozzie was. As great as Ozzie was his last years were truly bad. Backloaded contracts for players who never lived up to the contract, bad free agent pick ups like maclin, bad offensive drafting."
S/o to Air McNair for being our first real offensive spark at QB. This was the first time in our history where scoring on the first drive was a possibility.
This is so dumb seen this all day kyle boller is the reason I can be so critical of the QB position now
Defending Lamar Jackson is so much easier than defending Joe Flacco ever was.
"We had a dope Defense that could win games because the rules didn't favor offense so heavily though.

We had pass rush, an elite MLB and secondary. This post is bullshit"
"I was wasting my time as a Philly fan back then. In retrospect, though it pissed me off at the time, McNabb‚Äôs unceremonious firing was the best thing that could have happened to this football fan‚Äîwas able to follow Harbs to Baltimore."

"Man, I hate when one of my favorite players says something dumb and indefensible."
Hump needs to just stop man
I love you Humphrey but Jeff is part of the Flock you need to treat him with respect!
"Whether you think the virus is overhyped or not, just wear a mask and be smart when you‚Äôre going out to respect the people that are fearful or are high risk. I‚Äôm an overweight person and I absolutely hate wearing a mask, but I do it because I want to stay safe and respect other people."
Did he delete his tweets? I can‚Äôt find their exchange
"Twitter is hard to link to, Marlon's [reply](https://twitter.com/marlon_humphrey/status/1323725057861046273?s=19)."
What did he say?
"If Jeff is implying that they were careless when they weren't then I'm fully on board with Hump here.

Staying that our guys weren't wearing masks then they should have been is a very bad look and shouldn't be tolerated if false."

Reminder that since the trade deadline is over people have to clear waivers now.

I think if our entire starting defense can't dress we won't play.. if they clear everyone but marlo we go and make a game of it.. as long as we run like we did against pitt I think we win
The fuck wrong with his face?
We have a shot as long as it‚Äôs only Marlon on the Covid list but goddamn our offense needs to show up and beat the Colts  properly.
Lamar is the X factor for the rest of the year.
"this is NOT a ""the team's great, everything's fine, go ravens"" post, just to get out in front of those people

but

I've seen a lot of comments about how the team looks different from and worse than last year (which, yes), but I think people don't quite realize how historically good the 2019 ravens were and how rare it is to win 14 games

in tom brady's 18 years as the patriots' starting QB, they won 14 or more games four times, which is a little over once every five years for the greatest dynasty in NFL history

peyton manning started for 16 full seasons and won 14 games twice, which is once every eight years for unquestionably a top 5 QB of all time

winning games in the NFL is *incredibly* difficult, and the league is designed for teams to cycle through periods of being on top

are there problems with the team? yes, absolutely, but if we're comparing this season to a historic 2019 where everything went right then we're going to be disappointed every time"
"at this point I‚Äôm just gonna put my head down until the playoffs. let be people doubt us and write us off, I hate the hype anyway. we‚Äôre pretty much guaranteed a spot in the playoffs so I say just wait until then and hopefully handle business."
"I think the majority of the fans understand that last year‚Äôs was historical, from a winning standpoint and perspective. What the fans were complaining was more about the team abandoning the run. You read lots of ‚Äúyeah, we won but something doesn‚Äôt feels right‚Äù. For me, fuck the Steelers, but this loss felt ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than KC‚Äôs for example. IMO the Ravens recovered their identity and it felt good even tho‚Äô we lost."
"Lamar is in a position where every game he has to prove he's the best in the league because we've lost 2 playoff games when it counts on top of a historic MVP season.

We have the opportunity to perform better entering the playoffs as an underdog, like we have plenty of times in the past upsetting teams. Especially with the whole media finding a way to criticise everything we do.

As a fan we just have to hope the team does some damage in the playoffs. I don't care if we can't win it all thats just the way it is- but I hope we can knock out Shittsburg.

We're not the Cleveland browns, we have a good front office so will remain at least interesting to watch as a fan for the near future.

[Reminder that the Steelers literally cheered for the Browns in 2018.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLOJ2DFVQYk)

Lower your expectations, stay humble and fuck the Steelers and Browns."
Our team is always at it's best when we go through adversity. Last year the 14-2 gave us no adversity and we hardly played from behind which screwed us in the playoffs against TN.
"Also, our prior Super Bowl teams were not the best regular season teams either."
"I think its better to be a low-key/underdog team. Theres much less pressure on Lamar and i think he will perform better without people on his tail all the time. Unlike Mahomes and Wilson, Lamar seems like he can't deal with all the attention on him which is fine. I think getting criticized too much discourages Lamar a bit and if the media can just forget about him, he will play much better"
"This isn't about reason, it's purely about emotion. In the grand sense, this is one of the best teams in the league. But emotionally it's night and day. We got used to feeling like we had the best team in the league, anything that didn't fit the narrative could be written off as a fluke or coincidence.

This year there is no denying we are just a good team. Personally it's been hard to go back to being happy with a good chance to win when I good used to good chance of 30 point win. It's human nature.

My expectation is that the invested long term fan will recalibrate back to football reality and be happy with what we have. The bandwagon or shallow fan will continue to be upset.

We are clashing amongst ourselves because one side is arguing facts and one side is arguing feelings. We are talking past each other. Even if the Ravens win every game left it won't feel the same as last year, and once people realize that we can get back to a relatively healthy normal."
The team can improve by the playoffs.  Hopefully they will.  Without Stanley I'm not sure we're contenders anymore. There's a certain level of Greatness to be a champion and I'm not sure we have that right now.
"I agree and get how last year was incredible. What I really want from this year is a game where they lay the hammer down and really destroy a team, like they did multiple times last year (Patriots, Rams, Texans). If they can do it just once, I will be satisfied in knowing they have the potential to do it in the playoffs. Until then, I am just worried."
"The frustration comes from the fact that they seem to be playing at a similar level to last year, except without the consistency, and by losing to themselves with penalties, poor pay choices, ect..."
"We had our 2 losses by week 4 last year so technically we are off to an identical start. Fans this year are expecting perfection and it‚Äôs kinda annoying... both losses we‚Äôve had were close games to good teams. So much complaining about the play calling but I think it has been pretty good

It is Still possible to end with the same record.. if Lamar gets hot he is pretty unstoppable"
"This years team is still a 12-4 maybe even a 13-3 team, which both records are still *ridiculously* respectable. I agree w what you‚Äôre saying though."
"Lamar Jackson and the ravens were setting franchise and nfl records, left and right, last season. Lamar won the mvp, unanimously.  The only time in history this has happened.  

I knew people would knee jerk with stupid takes because, realistically,  there was no way this team could repeat those feats back to back. 

People love to point to Mahomes as a example. Yet this sub can't even support Lamar a full season.  Mahomes wasn't even in the MVP chat for most of last season. But to see this sub, you would like Lamar is a bust and needs to walk along with Roman."
"Last season was a special season that we squandered to be completely frank. Similar to 2006 when we went 13-3. 

You're right that we can't expect to have the repeat of such a season. But that makes it even more irrelevant to the *current* team's problems."
"Also to be fair our two losses are literally the top two power-ranked teams in the entire NFL right now.

Yeah we want to beat them, but the Steelers game was 100% winnable with just a little cleaner ball security.

KC was a rough game, but I don't believe that we're unable to beat them on the right day."

There's no TD pass or INT in that highlight video lol.
"I think it‚Äôs going to be a close game. They‚Äôre a solid team with a good defensive and offensive line. 

I hope Lamar balls out, finally, and hits some deep shots and that JK continues his emergence on our offense. 

Scared about starting a backup filled defense if things go bad on the tests but no way to change that now."
"If we play like the team we were built to be, and we saw flashes of that against the steelers, I think we will be okay. 

Need to keep an eye on that COVID list. 

Regarding colts offence - lockdown TY Hilton and pressure Rivers. He is so up and down, much like his tenure at the chargers. I think we can take care of business here."
"Im more worried about our Covid list impacting that game than the Colts themselves. That defense is good dont get me wrong, and Phillip Rivers is heating up, but look at their schedule.

I know everyone said this leading up to Pittsburgh but Indy really has only beaten one solid team in the Bears, which was a defensive slugfest ending 19-11. Their other wins are against awful teams. Id consider them pretenders but considering the state of our roster I'm not the most optimistic"
"Well I'll tell you this: TY Hilton won't do shit.

Sincerely, a fantasy owner who started him way too long into the season."
"If all those COVID players are out, not good."
If we can bottle their running game we will win.
"If we get the majority of our guys back I feel very confident. Indiana has a solid defense, Felipe always can play good football, but we just stomped rolled Steelers‚Äô defense. Take Lamar‚Äôs 2 INT and we talking about a rout."

"This is a little bit for fun, but my coworker and I made a bet due to a disagreement where he thinks James Robinson is a better Running back than J.K Dobbins. Ability wise not statistics. And then he doubled down by betting me $20 that there will not be ONE stat that Dobbins has better than Robinson after the colts game and after the Jags Houston game. Whose the better RB? What stat will Dobbins beat him at?"
JK has a much higher Yards per Carry (6.7 ypc vs 4.5 ypc) so that is a pretty telling stat
Yards after first contact Dobbins has dominated in all season. And that‚Äôs a stat that heavily favors backup RBs or the less popular RB in a RBBC due to their more rest later in games. So that‚Äôs much in Dobbins favor and against Robinson‚Äôs
"Dobbins has looked great in the touches he's gotten, but I don't think we've seen enough of Dobbins to say anything definitively. 

I also love Robinson, he has looked great in the trashbag that is the Jags offense"
Yards/attempt is the easy one.. J.K is 6.7 Y/A vs Robinson's 4.5 Y/A
That doesn‚Äôt make any sense if he claims it‚Äôs based on ability but then bases the bet on stats. Robinson gets way more opportunity which leads to better counting stats.
"You may have been scammed, my friend. Indy's defense is significantly better than the Texans and also Robinson gets pretty much every carry on that team. Odds are, better player or not, Robinson ends the game with better stats this week"

"No one in particular, it is a generic statement that means they will always be monitoring players who become available, or guys to bring in for depth if injuries happen. It never meant we were going to trade for someone with cap we don‚Äôt have"

"Football is a team sport, no one player wins or loses a game. Yes a kicker may hit a game winning FG, but the offense or defense got him to that point.

Had a bunch of tackles last year
"From PFF:

Solid veteran secondary mercenary for hire, Antoine Bethea has reached the rolling short-stop stage of his career. Since he left the Colts, he has had stops in San Francisco, Arizona and New York with the Giants, and in each location has had at least a solid year to begin before things started to decline. The Giants didn‚Äôt let him get to year two to see that downturn in fortunes, but Bethea has shown he can ‚Äì at the very least ‚Äì still be a solid starting presence. His first year with every team in his NFL career has seen him earn an overall PFF grade of at least 69.4, and in three of the four stops that grade was north of 84. He‚Äôs worth a short-term gamble for a team that has a problem spot at safety, but don‚Äôt expect it to be a long-term fix."

The Colts have some absurd win record going into this game against Baltimore all time at home that people made a big deal about and we still dont know who is actually going to play this weekend yet
"we lost 2 of our starting O linemen, which were already having trouble, so that is going to hurt our ground game. The Indy Defense is no slouch, so we likely are going to struggle to put up points like we have been.

Then we have the majority of the Defensive backfield out with Covid protocol, so that is going to again limit how much preparation they can do for scheming purposes. My take is that if we win, it is going to be on the backs of our stars' skill levels, and not anything planned."
I wouldn‚Äôt be shocked if we lost unfortunately
"Pick'em sounds about right to me, Colts are a great team and match up well. That's not even taking into consideration all the LBs have been sitting all week and might get only one practice in."

This is why I thought we had to win the SB last season. This happens to every Greg Roman offense and Harbaugh has a bad track record of getting rid of coaches when it's obvious it's not working.

We win you lose by a lot
A must win for us after the last week and if we want to catch up to the Steelers. 34-20 Ravens.
"You can't change the title, but a lot of the old school fans (if there are any, i know reddit is kinda young lol) are cringing that you called them the colts. Around here, they're called Indianapolis. (Sorry, I am contractually obligated by my upbringing to say that lol.)  

If we had won last week, I actually think we would have lost this game. It just seems like we're pretty evenly matched and (if we had beaten the Steelers) ripe for an overlook/trap game (minor) upset. 

However, between Harbaugh and Lamar, I don't expect a back-to-back loss. I expect Lamar to be on a mission this week. Harbaugh doesn't do too many consecutive losses, especially after bye week, and **especially** since Lamar arrived. I think Hollywood and Dez (to a lesser extent) will be involved. I think it will be close, but I think we pull it out. 

Good luck! No injuries allowed."
We may have an X factor...
"It‚Äôs going to be closer than we want but we pull it out 23-20.

Lamar will get 100 yard rushing and 2 tds in the air and 3 Tucker kicks."

"1. A Louisville QB has never been to Indianapolis.
2. Ravens have never won in Indianapolis.
3. Odds are made by watching how which degenerate gamblers bet and extrapolating a line where the casino will always win.

That said, the Ravens are in a great position to destroy the IPFT:

1. Steelers had the first overall run defense(now a boast by the Indy crowd) until the Ravens and their Rookie RB went to work dismantling it. The Steelers are way better than Indy.
2. The Browns blew them out while still putting respectable rush yards on the board despite having an inferior run game to the Ravens.
3. The Ghost of Johnny Unitas will possess every Baltimore player cranking them up to 11 and providing a supernatural ability to read plays.
4. Best cornerback duo in the league, cleared to play and hungry for some punch outs and ballhawk interceptions.
5. Dez Bryant will be playing, a veteran big body receiver who will, at a minimum provide a bit of run and pass blocking. But who will also be an X factor for the ‚Äúnumber one run defense‚Äù to contend with.
6. Indy can‚Äôt do Man coverage for shit but that‚Äôs the only type of coverage that stops our pass game. Can‚Äôt zone Mandrews, Hollywood, and Big Dick Nick together effectively. Not while accounting for any of  the other three (Snead Boykin and Dez)."

I‚Äôd bet he has one catch. Maybe three targets

U smoking that k2 if u think this
3 targets 2 catches for 15 yards
I'll take that bet
I just feel if lamar throws a bad pass and dez catches it lamar is gonna target the fuck outta him I don't think it's that crazy
10 touchdowns
I'll bet you that Lamar throws a pass today

He was pretty damn decent last season. There must be a reason why he‚Äôs inactive. I really hope there‚Äôs a reason why. Have to trust the coaches.
"I mean he‚Äôs gotten passed over by Ferguson who‚Äôs becoming a beast at setting the edge. We have Ferguson signed for the next 2 years and Ward is a FA in a few months. Plus McPhee still sets the edge incredibly well on those run downs. 

On third down you‚Äôre not going to use him over Yannick, Judon, Bowser, or McPhee.

He won‚Äôt slide inside ever and certainly not over Calais. Unless you‚Äôre Aaron Donald you won‚Äôt slide inside over Calais on third down. 

So I get that he‚Äôs frustrated but it‚Äôs not like he‚Äôs getting benched because he‚Äôs not talented, he‚Äôs just not as talented as some of literally the most talented players in the NFL"

Greg Roman has killed the career of mobile QBs. Its fucking happening again. Im sick of this predictable mf.
"‚ÄúWe have a serious injury here‚Äù

*guy gets up and does jumping jacks and jogs away*"
"Wow colts you stopped us...


JK"
"First half vs. Steelers: **Good**

Second half vs. Steelers: **Bad**



First half vs. Colts: **Bad**

Second half vs. Colts: **Good**"
"Game wasn't going good, I got up and made a peanut butter and apple sandwhich. Sat down in front of the tv just in time to see that fumble TD. Conclusion: I must now eat peanut butter and apple every game"
fire fucking greg roman. this guy took at shit this year on our offense.
"Roman Needs to be fired or Lamar will be Kaepernicked. Lamar isn't playing well today but it is more obvious due to bad o-line, no weapons, and BAD play calling. At the very least Haurbaugh needs to be calling important plays"
My god the offensive line was so trash that last drive
"Well im on board the fire Roman wagon, this is absolutely pathetc."
"Can't wait for the postgame pressers.

""We need to get better""

""We aren't making excuses""

""We're looking at things we need to fix""

""We still like where we are"""
I can tell our play calling is better because the camera man is getting confused
Jackson smiling after a play. I feel like we haven't seen that all season
wow we made halftime adjustments. first game in a decade.
I love how sassy our sub gets when we're about to win a game lmao. We were all melting down an hour ago üòÇ
"Can't believe we kept that offense scoreless in the whole 2nd half. Defense showed up today. No Marlon, no Calais. Really dialed the fuck in."
That green fuck is wasting popcorn
whatever they said to the team at halftime needs to be said every game
"Philip Rivers, like a turtle on his back, flailing in the hot sun, realizing his time is over."
Watching Phillip Rivers be angry is like the most pure pleasure
Bomb to hollywood here
Defense is stepping up rn really playing well considering all the losses
We get at least 3 illegal formation a game someone needs to fucking go
IM LOOKING AT HARBS WITH ALL THESE FUCKING PENALTIES OVER 200+ YARDS IN PENALTIES FROM LAST 3 GAMES WTF
"judon not  coming back, and im fine with that"
This offense is like my 90 year old grandpa. I love him but he moves very slowly and constantly shits himself
Roman has literally spooked Lamar from taking deep shots. Have we given Dez the ball at all today? Hollywood talking on twitter about not getting involved. Roman is literally killing the chemistry of this team on the offensive side of the ball
How is this team never good in both sides of the ball at the same time lmao
Too conservative on that drive. Theres 5 minutes left not 2.
"Do we have to give player of the game to Greg Roman? I mean, he adjusted and set them up to succeed in the second half."
You know Colts miss Luck üíØ...should have actually protected him when you had him.
He was walking. Looks like a cramp. Hopefully that‚Äôs all it is
this team has 0 identity
this team seams to have lost all their charisma and energy from last year
"Ravens Defense:  This ones for you Marlon

Marlon:  IM NOT DEAD

Ravens defense:  You can still hear his voice on the wind."
I woke up super early to get everything done around the house I had to do before kick off.
"Theres gonna be some tough conversations to be had in the coming months on what to do after next season. Buckle up, Flock."
"This team is done until Roman is gone. Fucking Trestman, Mornhinweg, and Cameron all over again."
Greg Roman would have Harbaugh activate Dez without a single plan on how to use him.
MP Juiceman MVP so far
So bryant has been so far activated as a cheerleader...
Offensive pass interference is a real penalty that should sometimes be called.
Red zone = DEZ time
"Koch gotta go in the ring of honor, dude has been so consistently great for years."
Tucker is a God
[I would love to face the Colts in the playoffs if they make it.](https://i.imgur.com/lVce3PG.jpg)
"This is a huge win. We get Marlon back next week, all the injuries and we still get the win."
Yeah nice job padding your stats Rivers you crybaby old bitch
Always sus of dpi calls they don‚Äôt show the replay of...
Greg romans is wondering how the hell they did that
WhY hAVe sOuLJAs
Lmaoooo Rivers
We have fast players too but never do shit like that
All of our edge defenders not named McPhee need to be taught this thing called setting the edge.
I'M READY TO THROW UP THE X GIVE IT TO DEZ
Lamar if Greg calls a bs play just call a fucking audible
Colts actually play offense. TAKE NOTES GREG ROMAN
Most deflating 10-7 deficit ever?
What is this dude talking about. They ran ALL OVER the Steelers last week. It has absolutely nothing to do with Mark Ingram.
Even without the injuries this team has major flaws. Anyone that wants to argue that they don't is crazy. I'm not a fair weather fan and I know this team isn't a playoff team right now.
Lol who tf is watching replay to tell him to challenge? Fire them asap
"Come on, boys!!!!! My husband said if the Ravens win I can put up my Christmas Tree. üéÑ"
"Can we cut the first half ravens and sign all the 3rd quarter ravens, except maybe Chuck Clark, first half Chuck Clark can stay"
Why do they keep showing Rivers on the sideline walking around spitting on his fingers? what is he doing lol
HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
If we could eat up like 5 minutes and score a TD that‚Äôd be perfect
It‚Äôs a Lamar keeper...JK YOU FRICCIN MORONS
Gus has been our best RB2 since Willis McGahee. I will stand by that all day . Absolutely deserves a 2-3 year deal
STOP THE COUNT.
You guys whining about not going for a TD there are dumb. You just take the points in this situation every time.
FUCK BOB IRSAY
First half was our worst of the season. 2nd was the best. Sports and mentality are weird.
Hell of a fucking win
That second half was so comforting
#Whats the point of having souljas if they cant catch the ball?!?!
"Why is it that when trolls come to this sub to troll Lamar, their active subs are always r/conservative and r/donaldtrump?"
"Dobbins didn‚Äôt understand the call for sure , was likely an rpo"
This is gonna get ugly. We have no depth. Our D is practice squad D
"Hey Hollywood, if you are going to bitch about not getting catches: catch the ball."
Bonds in position to get that INT because he wasn't near the receiver.
"YANNICK IS A BEAST!

They brought him in on 3rd down, and lined him up to do what they brought him in to do, rush the passer and disrupt the play. Didn‚Äôt get a sack, barely got a QB hit but totally disrupted Rivers."
Can we get a young OC that will play to Lamar strengths not avoid them!!!!
Lamar doesn‚Äôt trust his O line and for good reason. That‚Äôs what this boils down to.
Fire Roman immediately
From a historically great offense to a potentially historically horrible offense in one offseason lol
"This reminds of post super bowl Ray rice cut,  pre Steve smith era ravens run for 2 yards run for 2 yards check down for 3 punt and repeat"
Watching 3 votes per hour come in from PA over the course of 5 days was more fun than this game.
Put Dez in üò†
Colts really would be SB contenders with Luck...
"yo, who we hire as OC at half??"
"NICE !!

Love the urgency that Dobbins ran with there"
"‚ÄúWhen this is over, Lamar should get a gold glove‚Äù lmao announcer throwing huge shade on Skura (rightly so)"
We have just set the NFL record for most consecutive games with 20+ points with 31!
Andrews blocked that man into the shadow realm
"On the plus side, Dobbins looks great this game"
I have not said one negative thing about this team ever no need to fact check it‚Äôs all good
that DB is mandrews son now
"Ok, looks like he might have just gotten popped on that tackle. Hopefully nothing serious"
Best rivalry renewed? Undefeated Steelers vs the 2-6 cowboys? Lol get out of here
You literally can't kick a FG more down the middle than that
PUT TUCKER AT MIKE LB YOU COWARDS!
Get the fuck out of here Colt‚Äôs fans....we did absolutely nothing the first half and we still clapping yo cheeks!
amazing win today meh first half but a very promising 2nd half
Don‚Äôt worry guys you can also be an NFL player like Rivers. All you have to do is throw constant screens and cry a lot
A Ravens Team that can adjust??? I‚Äôm not used to this...
RIP Alex Trebek
"Lol, Boyle was hurdling people while Andrews was still at Oklahoma"
Time for another 3 and out with shitty play calling
Literally getting held the whole way down. Fucking terrible
The amount of times we cause fumbles - everyone on the defense - is one of the most astonishing things I‚Äôve ever seen a defense do lol
"HIT ME WITH THAT DOPAMINE BALTIMORE

LETS GOOOOOO"
"They know exactly what plays kill our defense, screens and sweeps."
Harbs declining delay of game like a beast
man i‚Äôm just hoping for a jackson to dez 50 yard bomb
There's that dumb fucking QB run straight up the middle.
"Real fucking clever, Roman. Jfc."
That was a nice spin move by Yannick
"I FUCKING HATE YOU GREG ROMAN.


SERIOUSLY"
"If we don't get a new OC this season or offseason, so help me"
But we were the fake fans and the bandwagons for calling out the shitty offense for weeks
Dez Bryant is not going to fix this offense
Offensive line is a huge problem right now
I hope Roman is fired after this
Might be a good idea to block Yannick ü§îü§îü§î
Flag on Baltimore for sucking fucking ass
GREG MAN BAD
"The Ravens have as many penalty yards (55) as total offensive yards (55) in the first half.

Just four first downs. Averaging just more than 2 yards per play. - @ryanmink"
Remember when every game was a highlight reel last season? Good times.
"We got the beautiful trifecta, a poor pass-blocking line, WRs who can't get separated or catch, and an OC who has zero ingenuity in the pass game. Recipe for another early exit in the playoffs IF we make it."
I wanna see the fourth down Seattle game fire in Lamar again.
Guess Harbough doesn‚Äôt want timeouts
Harbs is good for one useless challenge per game
"""We have a serious injury here""

Player jogs off the field."
I hope the halftime adjustment was telling Roman he was fired if we lost and we‚Äôll see this level of play every time now
STOP THE COUNT
A Ngakoue strip sack would be real nice right now
I hope we re-sign Bowser. Can't really afford to lose both our SAMs this off-season. He's better in coverage than Judon and doesn't get the stupid penalties.
You hate to see these Colts injuries
Did anyone at Amazon do research on how DeShaun Watson talks before they created that commercial?
Greg Roman just told us all to stfu
Step on their necks now. Lamar haters in shambles in other threads. He looks to have is confidence back.
How can we not sack Philip fucking Rivers
"DADGUMMNIT. - Rivers, probably"
#Come from behind narrative is dead. COLTS #2 defense got smacked in the face
Judon got a dump truck tbh
Rivers has gotta be the most overrated average QB ever
CERN uses JT kick down the middle to align their supercollider accuracy
J. Tucker = TACKLE: 99
I'm shocked by the outcome of the game considering how we did 1st half lol
"We got so spoiled by last year and weren‚Äôt very good for years before that that. We forgot how it feels to win dirty, grind it out games. That used to be our specialty."
This game was huge for Lamar's confidence. Struggled in first half came back in the second and showed why he is the reigning MVP great game from our guys.
Its a shame they Brought in Rivers instead of developing Brissett.
These crazy high expectations I have for this team hurt my enjoyment of Ravens games week to week
This is the worst Ravens offensive performance since last week
"Downvote me all you want, but we aren't going to go far in the playoffs looking like this. If we even make it there at all!"
#Lamar looking as flat as Flacco did from 2015-2018
20 GAME LOSING STREAK WITH A HALFTIME DEFICIT ENDED. LAMAR COMEBACK KING CONFIRMED
I swear to fucking god if we lose another pro bowler
Please be cramps please be cramps please be cramps
That was a completely broken play right off the bat.
Remember when first downs were consistent? Pepridge farm remembers.
Someone (likely Dobbins) messed up the call. Looked like RPO Lamar tried to salvage
swear we are the only team that draws 0 oline holding
This is the game everyone else is going to realize how many problems the Ravens have
Love how they never show PI on replay anymore because they know it's almost always bullshit.
"Ah yes, great. Hollywood takes to Twitter to complain about targets, then bobbles a catch for an incompletion on third down. Neat, man. Neat."
Penalties will be the death of this team
Let's chill with Hollywood lol we're gonna bully him till he actually sucks
Clark hurdling Rivers is good shit
CHUCK CLARK IS THE GREATEST 6TH ROUND PICK EVER FUCK TOM BRADY
Bonds = Averett = Canady
You guys hating on Bonds obviously don't remember my man Chykie Brown.
I'm thinking of starting a change.org petition to fire Roman who will sign
"3rd & short and no rb's on the field = lamar qb draw, who would've guessed"
I'm convinced the Ravens are the only team that gets called for holding
WHAT IS OUR FUCKING OFFENSE IT PISSES MR OFF EVERY WEEK IT GETS WORSE
Why y‚Äôall roasting Judon? Penalty was on McPhee wasnt it?
"I know everyone is emotional, but people saying Lamar regressed to cause this ENTIRE offence to be this poor is crazy. Lamar needs an OC and OLine that can help him grow now that defenses have figured out his skillset.

Y'all are acting like last year was a fluke"
Judon in coverage why...
I'm not going to eat until an opposing OL gets called for holding
Our offense has done nothing in this game and its tied.
"Dude fire our OC , like you know our O line is banged up so why keep Lamar trying to throw in the pocket have him move out and throw like fucking A. Or Run the ball like seriously run the fucking ball."
Leave.Roman.In.INDY!!!
"Ok. I've been reading the thread and something occurred to me.

Fire GR. And bring in Lamar's Louisville OC as his replacement.

He surely knows how to use Lamar both as a passer and a rusher."
"Something something Lamar

Something something Greg Roman"
Its sad that the best part of this game is lamar not having a turnover
Wow way to kill literally all the momentum
That's 3 lost fumbles inside the 10 yard line in 2 weeks. What the fucking fuck
Bruh Harbaugh mega earth brain
"Glad they gave it back to Gus for the TD, should def help his confidence after than fumble earlier"
While yannick still hasn‚Äôt had a sack he‚Äôs applied pressure a good amount today
"Close this shit out , don‚Äôt let the colts find more ballots"
"No way GRO is calling plays.

He calls a QB Draw there."
Uh Oh you just got dobbed!
"Holy shit, that has got to be the first time I've ever seen a Ravens QB pull a Manning/Rodgers and run to the line hoping to make the defense jump as time expires.

I don't even care that it didn't 'work.' I'm just glad Lamar can/will do that."
That‚Äôs the 20+ points in consecutive games streak!
NFL record of scoring 20+ for 31 consecutive games.
Lamar didn't do a backflip into the endzone he might not be our guy idk
"It‚Äôs pretty amazing that even philip rivers, the 100 year old statue, is able to escape sacks from our pass rushers."
Judon looked at Rivers like he was a Big Mac
To those of you confused about Dez not seeing many snaps: the guy is playing in his first game on a new team after not seeing the field in 3 years. Don't act so surprised.
At least they burned all 3 timeouts.
Game over bitch
Lamar really brought us our first wins in Philly and Indy(projected). Next up is Chicago next year hopefully
"Imagine holding the Ravens offense to 55 yards in the first half, having the lead, and blaming the refs for your loss."
"I wasn't very optimistic at 1:00 today.  
I was downright pessimistic at 2:00.

I am pleasantly surprised."
"huge shout out to Chuck Clark, he saved us today"
That ball was so straight it makes me look gay
Russell Wilson got like 2 fumbles 3 picks wtf lol
# That was a Tuckle
Man this game was huge
"So Buffalo figured Russ out, now every teams figured him out. The league has film on him

/s"
"I wonder if a win against a 5-2 AFC team is a ""big game."" If we lost, it for sure would count against Lamar's ""big game"" record."
I guess it‚Äôs time for me to be a Cowboys fan for the next 3 hours
Is indy really trying this hard for a meaningless td
This sub is fucking embarrassing lmao
"This may be unpopular but when the ravens play like they did in the first half I am unhappy. 

However, when they play like they have so far in the second half, I am happy."
"This game is significant.


This is 31 straight games scoring 20+, best in NFL history.


This is the first game in 20 opportunities where we won when trailing at halftime.


This half is the best our offense has looked since week 1.


Our defense has looked great despite missing multiple starter talents.


This game bodes well for our future. We are now trending up"
I hate watching games that take place in a half-dome. That huge bright spot on the left side of the field is gonna be annoying all day today
I think taking the sack there was the right thing to do.
Can we agree we‚Äôve seen enough of Roman
Greg Roman is a fucking clown. He's play calling the instinct out of Lamar. I'm convinced now it's not Lamar. It's Roman.
Lamar would have pitched it if he could. Bozeman got rolled on that play. Nothing Lamar could have really done.
This team is pretty hard to watch
"There‚Äôs literally nobody out there better than Bonds we could‚Äôve gotten? Carr, Desmond King, literally anyone?"
The utter refusal to show the PI on replay is baffling.
"It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôre bad. I just don‚Äôt see fire. 

Give it to Dobbins. he‚Äôs the spark right now. Do it three times then throw to Andrew‚Äôs. We moved like 98 yards on 11 run plays last week. Just do it."
Harbaugh gonna tweet bout his receivers after the game
Weren't they both at each other's facemasks?
I can't remember the last time I had fun watching this team play. Week 1 I guess
So much has gone wrong for us this year lol wtf
LMAO HE STEPPED OVER RIVERS LIKE AI
"gonna reiterate because that little stat they showed isnt getting enough attention-

21 straight games w a takeaway is honestly fucking **bonkers**"
"Rivers falling the way he did had me dead bruh, that was hysterical"
Right back to bad tackling
Bonds could have made this entire sub love him...
Lmao bonds is a clown
A lot of hate for Bonds. Y'all know he's only playing because we have an injury crisis?
"Oh Jesus, Kyle Allen hurt BAD. Lower part of his leg was completely in the wrong direction. Almost similar to Alex Smith."
Greg Roman is a clown for running the same play 20 times a game. Please fire him
Oh fuck you Greg Roman
These Lamar runs on third down are shit.
Fire Greg Roman
A pass rush? a 3 and out? Refreshing
These illegal formation penalties every week are so frustrating
"These penalties are on Harbaugh, how many damn illegal formations this year already!"
Somebody needs to be benched or fired. An NFL offense playing and calling like this is pathetic.
Lol we get the free 15 and still find a way to fuck it up. Honestly this offense is shambolic
did they not just fucking knock over our kicker?
"Lamar and other players every week: We need to get better and figure it out

The whole offense, every week: *gets worse and figures nothing out*"
at least yannick did something i guess
Alie-cox is just a step behind clinton-dix in terms of name quality
lamar looking sad is so different from the happy shades man
"That should of been a flag, just like it should of been a flag last week on Pitt."
"Lamar doesn't have enough time back there, that was literally 1 second before he had to scramble, along with a bad snap, it's just terrible on the offensive line this year"
"Gus and JK have four carries between them.

FOUR.

What the fuck is Greg smoking"
Fire Roman at half please
Greg Roman bad
"There are two starters left on the OL, one playing out of position and the other coming off a literally destroyed knee playing months before anyone expected him too but its all roman and lamar?"
Watching those other teams highlights just makes me feel worse. Teams throwing to their receivers for plays down field. I can‚Äôt remember the last time we saw that. You need to look around the league to just see how bad we are.
RIP Alex Trebek
Lamar the last 5 weeks is worse than 2018 Lamar. His mechanics in his legs are still bettter now but he plays with no confidence and worse decision making
Roman figured out he can dial up quick passes instead of passes that take 20 seconds to develop
RG3 lookin like Rey from Star Wars with that haircut
Harbaugh clearly cussed everybody out at half lol
Peters is a hero
Everyone switching from calling our hc stupid to a genius after the int
Let Lamar be Lamar. Thats all I ask.
lAmAr CaNt CoMe FrOm BeHiNd
I am so baffled by the offense. Two drives and they made moving the ball look easy as fuck.
I want to throw that X up!!!
"I must confess, I am calling the plays"
Rivers is looking very stressed out haha
Absolutely must get points off this drive
We look hungry again and that‚Äôs all I ask for.
"Evan Washburn said Skura has a cut on his hand, hence the bad snaps."
Bruh this Lamar right now lmao
THATS MY MVP üèÜüèÜüèÜ
What if Roman is no longer calling plays in the second half but in fact Dez Bryant is? Perhaps Dez is just a decoy and has spent the lats 2 years studying and building the ultimate llama playbook?
maybe wind knocked out of him?
Patrick! We need you healthy to win DROY!
"On Thanksgiving, when asked what I'm thankful for, I will say ""11/8/2020 - Queen just had the wind knocked out of him."""
‚ÄúBaltimore had a lot of excuses not to play well this week.‚Äù And we used every one of them in the first half.
I really need Harbuagh to tell me what happened at half time.
"Aboslutely outclassing them defensively even without Gnarly Marly

Take a bow, defense."
Tucker: ‚Äúfuck you I want my damn points‚Äù
Tuckers out here splitting atoms down the center of the uprights
Tucker right down the middle. Like that ball aligned with the fucking hand rail. My god I love him.
I want a popcorn bong
Lamar and O decided to take their quarter off in the first half
"ugly win, but we got the dub. go cowboys"
Game. Blouses.
"Why are colts fans coming into this sub like we ever think about their team

Nobody cares fuck you for calais"
"LET'S GO!
PS. FUCK THE STEELERS"
"Us:  No more injuries

Boyle:  HURDLE HURDLE HURDLE"
Levine been eating on special teams
I mean Rivers should just target Bonds all day. Dude is complete ass.
Ah yes a big block in the back right at the point of attack.
This defense is Swiss cheese today. Gonna be a long day
I'm jealous of the Colts play calling
Our secondary looking more like 2014 every week
We're literally missing half the starters now lol gonna be a miracle if the Ravens play well on defense. Just not enough experience and bodies to fill in the gaps.
What a soldier! Good job Hollywood!
This team has a severe lack of FUN
Catch the fucking ball Hollywood
Apparently the Soulja can‚Äôt catch
Fuck it just let Dez play every snap on offense can't be worse than this can it?
Lol Rivers
Love that hurdle over Rivers!!!üòÜ
This is some 2006 Ravens shit every week now lol
the spirit of marlon lives on
They are going to run 30 screens today and wink won‚Äôt ever stop blitzing
Gettin spicy on defense.   I like it.  Bonds should had that one tho.
"We‚Äôre in a good position. Turned the moment, stopped the Colts, getting the ball to start the 2nd half and a chance to take the lead here."
Our offensive line is legit painful to watch
I miss last year‚Äôs offense
Fire Roman please
Roman needs to seriously fuck off with this awful 3rd down playcalling
Don‚Äôt some plays seem like Roman drew them up 5 minutes ago and we‚Äôve never even practice them
Can we implement more west coast concepts? slants/quick throws. every short play is a sweep or run smh. or super crap screen play.
Our offense needs something right here atleast a long drive our defense must be gassed
Most of this thread is fun and normal but I swear there are legit some people in here that are either trolls or are insane. People seriously talking about ‚Äúwell RGII may get this offense going‚Äù or ‚Äúman I miss Flacco‚Äù absolutely absurd.
My god this offense is pathetic to watch recently
We are such undisciplined sacks of shit today. I hate watching this team at 5am every week when this is the effort they give on offense.
The one time Lamar had more than 1 second he made a good pass. These troubles stem to the Oline. Plus all these formation errors. This is a problem from top down with the O.
Roman is play calling the instinct right out Lamar just like he did with Kaepernick
This team is just playing terrible right now.
"By my count we have called 3 (!!!) plays where Lamar stands in the pocket to throw down beyond the LOS. Hollywood drop, Andrew conversion, and dump off for 5 years to Gus Bus."
# I AM SO SICK OF PENALTIES
"We need our defense to basically do everything, they need to defend and score points 

man we can‚Äôt even get in Justin tucker range that‚Äôs how bad our offense is"
OLINE is horrible. Lamar‚Äôs regression looks 10x worst because of the oline
can we throw the ball to dez one time next half? why the hell did we activate him if we arent going to throw balls to the one contested catch receiver we fucking have? FIRE GREG ROMAN.
"This is the worst offensive performance since Lamar became the starter. Just... Wow, so fucking bad"
ayo fuck greg roman
Two WRs that run a 4.3 and O-line still cant block long enough for them to make a play.
"Roman in the box rn: ""I got a taste for some Five guys later anyone wanna join me?"""
alex trebek died? wtf
Somehow r/nfl is more toxic than ever
Fire ~~Cameron~~ ~~Trestman~~ ~~Marty~~ Roman
"BTW -- Josh Allen could not throw for 300 yards prior to this year. Josh Allen was regularly throwing under 200 yards all of his rookie and 2nd year in the NFL...

All of a sudden Josh Allen has either 3 or 4 games this year ALONE throwing for over 300 yards...

Oh, I wonder what happened? Did Josh Allen SUDDENLY learn how to throw? Possibly. He could have gotten better from year 2 to 3. HOWEVER, I bet...I bet it has something to do with he Bills GOING OUT AND GETTING JOSH ALLEN A No. 1 WR.

I bet you Josh Allen didn't just suddenly start throwing for 300 yards with the same WRs Corps. 

HE GOT A BETTER WRs CORP."
LOL. Fucking sums up this season doesnt it.
"Fucking use Dobbins, what is this shit"
"This a bad challenge, but if we win it, i never said that"
Lmao Harbuagh with the weekly meme challenge.
"""what a dumb challenge""

r/Ravens are idiots"
"Hahahahah F all you for shitting on Harbs, get back on the couch"
2011 Jags MNF or 2017 Jags London are still my votes for worst offense I've ever watched that wasn't Kyler Boller.
What a 100000 IQ play by Harbs tho guys.
Why is the O Line suddenly giving Lamar a clean pocket
#YOU PUNY REFS CANNOT STOP THE GUS BUS FROM ROLLING ON THROUGH
Roman is finally just calling a vanilla passing offense and it‚Äôs fucking working Jesus we get too cute sometimes
WE HAVE THE LEAD. Amazing halftime adjustments. Literally all they did was pick up the pace and didn't allow the defense time to think. Major props to the coaches.
"Lamar is finally in a rhythm passing the football.

Enjoying this adjustment we've made to play up-tempo football."
"i wonder who would win in a 40 yard race, brady or rivers"
We‚Äôre playing with some BDE rn
I'd like to see Dez get involved. I'm surprised they're not giving him some snaps to see if he can do anything
Boyle putting together a nice little game 4/46
"I know we‚Äôve missed Hurst, but Boyle has stepped up his receiving game a ton"
We need to draft a new Iowa lineman for our offense next season
Fuck yeah Dobbins
Someone in this thread asked where 4th quarter Lamar Jackson in the Seattle game went. HE'S BACK BABY!!
Every time Dobbins touches the ball it looks like he's one move away from taking it to the house
We've been waiting for this half... The entire season
That play was so satisfying
"Wtf happened to Roman, he coulda been doing this all year"
Damn Lamar has looked like a different player this half. Good for him.
Harrison butker missed a Pat and a field goal
How was that a TD with TWO OL knocked literally on their asses ON THE PLAY SIDE?!?
andrews moved his ass to another state damn
Did Harbaugh take over offensive play calling?
The Ravens play so much better when I have totally given up...
Concussion or wind knocked out of him
looks like he got his bell rung
We‚Äôre literally dropping like the eagles and 49ers
Stop these history stealing bastards
GET IT JUDON AHHHHHHHHHHHH
So fucking annoying how we can't make game-deciding plays like that 3rd and 1
Gus will run through a man then help him up lol. I hope we re-sign him.
"Every single time Rivers doesn't convert, he's walking around with his hands up confused he didn't get a flag. Gosh..."
Imagine your kicker not being Justin Tucker
Justin Tucker might have to play corner for us soon
What is happening there
Colts fans were oddly obnoxious today
"Rivers: ""Go ram go ram""... reciever: ""I dont even know what that means"""
What the hell was that popcorn thing
FUCK any colts fans who claim our history
just delete the first half
I still can't believe we could win while trailing at half time
"I‚Äôm just really happy that we got stronger in the second half rather than imploding like we have been in several games this season.

Good bounce back win after a heartbreaking loss and a ton of injuries last week."
Comeback kings. Truzz
What‚Äôs the point of having souljas that can‚Äôt catch the ball (Never!)
"Pro tip: if you're going to go on Twitter to bitch about your usage in-game, don't go out the next game and drop balls"
Call me old fashioned or ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù but I really hate that Popeyes commercial. No black person should be singing for fuckin chicken lol. Same shit that people got mad at MC Hammer a long time ago for making a KFC commercial dancing and shit for chicken.
This offense is unwatchable. Shocking transition from last year.
Putting Matt Judon in coverage. Wink is so fucking silly
"Harbaugh needs to understand that when your OC is setting your QB up for failure it‚Äôs time to go. Idc if he won OC of the year or whatever, he‚Äôs lost his touch just like every other team he went to."
ITS 230AM MONDAY HERE IN TOKYO BUT IM FUCKING LIT FOR THIS GAME LETS GOOOOO
"busted play, it was fucked up from the beginning"
Bozeman got fucking dominated on that play
"Losing Campbell really hurts us, hope he can come back. Calf injuries are brutal, really hope it‚Äôs not Achilles."
"It really sucks Bonds has to play. We‚Äôve been killed with those injuries. Also Campbel with his helmet off, doubt he returns."
"Rivers should just throw to whichever receiver is guarded by Bonds. Idk what Harbaugh was saying last week when he said he played well. Hes terrible.

I remember before the season talking about how great our secondary was. Then Thomas punched a teammate, Young suffered yet another season ending injury, Marlon has Covid, Averett broke a collarbone or something, Dorsey is now out. Weve got an old as shit Jimmy, Marcus, and Bonds."
"Riddle: If a ball is thrown into the end zone and no flag appears, was it even thrown...?"
"Not looking good boys. Calais out, Humphrey out. Rivers is gonna pick on Bonds all day. If our offense can‚Äôt get going, this is gonna be ugly af."
Alright soldier.
Why don't you tweet about that dropped pass Hollywood
Can we just have a fucking #1 WR for once in our franchise history?!
How can an offense featuring Lamar Jackson at QB produce such a boring product on the field? Something ain't right.
Grandpa Rivers tripped on grass
I loved that hurdle over Rivers SO MUCH
"For anyone who wants to know why Rivers needed to be hurdled.

Philip Rivers is a notorious shit talker!"
Rivers ate shit lol
Rivers sitting on the ground pouting looked like he wants to kill Taylor
If he doesn‚Äôt make that play I think we were very likely on the path to an L. That completely swung the momentum!!
That jump over Rivers is the funniest shit I've seen all week
Rivers just sitting there sad is the perfect fucking image. So good I might nut to it.
I love how we all agree bonds sucks and shouldn't be playing
15 minute break at work. Turn on the game long enough to see a fumble for a td. Good shit.
Safe to say Bonds will not be making the hands team going forward
I despise Rivers.
How is carolina up 14-3 on KC
They don't teach you how to catch on the practice squad?
Levine > Bonds ya or nah
Why do our jet sweeps always look like shit
We have the worst 3rd down play caller in the league. Every time QB Draw FUCK
LJ that run up the middle ain‚Äôt working this season
all year these stupid up the middle lamar qb draws for 0 yards. HOW MANY TIMES DO WE NEED TO SEE THIS NOT WORK
"Lamar Jackson and Ravens' first three drives at Indy:

First downs: 2

Plays: 14

Net yards: 37

Punts: 3


Is there anyone that is still arguing that this Offense isn‚Äôt bad?"
"Note to Roman and Lamar.  If its third and short:

The Defense knows Lamar is going to keep it.

The announcers know Lamar is going to keep it.

My dog knows Lamar is going to keep it.

The crazy lady down the street who asks me if the futtyball is on today know Lamar is going to keep it.

Maybe try something different?"
 Ravens with 37 total yards so far. There's no excuse for that.
Unfortunately it doesn't even matter if Roman improves the playcalls with a 2nd string offensive line
We need to start being aggressive with the passing game. Lamar needs to prove himself today.
That's a bad replay. That bitch should've been ejected
Our OL is hot dogshit Jesus Christ we are missing Stanley and Yanda
"Throw the FUCKING BALL AWAY LAMAR. 

You don‚Äôt need to try to Houdini your way out of every pocket collapse. Jesus Christ"
MARSHAL YANDA IS MISSED
Greg Roman cant even coach legal formations.
"Our team went from being the most fun in the league to watch to just painful to watch, we look afraid of everything"
My 10000000th reminder to everyone: **THIS IS WHY I SAY DRAFT OL AND NOT THESE STUPID FUCKING WRs you all want**
Sam Koch really out here carrying us
"Every time there's an illegal formation, the TV coverage was showing some other random shit right before the snap and I can't see what happened"
How is it even possible to go from record setting offense to utter dogshit with most of the same personnel? It was this bad before Ronnie went out too...
We need a major revamp this off-season on offense. Get a new coordinator who can actually draw up a pass game.
"I never thought I‚Äôd be saying this after last season, but...this team is boring as hell to watch right now."
I only notice Judon when he gets penalties  so not worth all that money
It was just a shitty throw? Like what are these commentators talking about
I want nothing more at this point than for Ray Lewis to materialize and drive Rivers through the turf
All credit to the defense they've been so good this year but the same thing happened last game. When we absolutely needed the stop we couldn't get it unfortunately. If no roughing the passer was likely at least a field goal for us.
That was an ubsurdly shit angle that Elliot took.
Our offense is doodoo only way we win is with turnovers
Ferguson just saved a TD
I'm surprised they didn't flag Joker.
Anyone defending this team right now how it stands and playing is fucking delusional
New strategy. 3rd down we just throw up 50/50 balls and treat it as a punt. Fuck it.
We‚Äôre very lucky to be only down 3.
I seriously believe our D can score a TD more than our offense. This is just tragic and we absolutely don‚Äôt deserve a playoff spot.
Lamar has not attempted a single pass over 15 air yards today ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Can we please look into hiring a young and innovative OC.
"With his track record, Greg Roman will be lucky to find another job in this league."
What a dumb fucking challenge. This is 2017 all over again.
JOHN IS PLAYING 4D UNDERWATER BASKETWEAVING AND WE PLAYING CHECKERS
Y‚Äôall can apologize to harbs now
How long do we have Peters signed for?  I might need a jersey.
Using the souljas
Peters really is a goat
Marcus Peters is that deal.
Oh shit sub about to hit 100k. Pretty cool.
Im holding my breath. Please get 6 here
"/r/nfl banned me for calling myself 'retarded'. 

Insane."
Lamar looked like the MVP QB we saw last year on those last two drives
The quick pass adjustment really seems to do it.
"We have second half adjustments that is making our offense better

Only took us to literally week 9 to figure out that‚Äôs a good idea"
That‚Äôs the first time since week 1 we look like the 2019 ravens. PLS KEEP THIS UP OFFENSE
"Lamar's gonna be so fucking good when he's a seasoned veteran and can adjust plays to things he keys in on.

No idea why people thinks is gonna work the other way around and he'll get worse."
Lets break the record for 20+ points in consecutive games!!!
Shoutout Proche... it wasn‚Äôt long ago that punt returns used to be an absolute adventure for us
Jackson is looking good!
Good 2nd half adjustments with the offensive scheme and it's noticeable since the Ravens are actually doing something on offense.
There's been quite a few slips today.
"When it‚Äôs working and Lamar is getting something going, they look a different team. I just don‚Äôt trust to maintain."
That was our hell ya coach let‚Äôs go for it
Ray Rice
11/8/2020 I learned that indy fans are whiny little pricks
This is the offense we all know and love
MVP MVP MVP
"Are,are the 2019 Ravens coming out to play?"
THATS MY FUCKING QB
Holy fuck that was a nice fake.
Lamar has his swagger back. Patriots are shaking in their boots right now knowing that
Greg Roman is stunting on these hoes (we are the hoes)
Roman snorting lines at halftime
"That third and inches playcall was awesome!

Anyone else feel like that 4th and 3 conversion Dobbins made was this year's ""hell yeah let's go for it coach"" moment?"
STOP THE COUNTING
I was all doom and gloom for the first half I'll admit. Roman's playcalling fucking has me so baffled.
Wish we couldve woken up last week but better late than never
If Burger King comes wake me up at 6 AM they are catching these hands
Mandrews straight up manhandled him
I really want to know either what was said or done in half time to have such an amazing change of pace
"you know Harbaugh brought out the hairdryer treatment in the locker room, Alex Ferguson would be proud"
I want to hear who stood up in the locker room at half. We think it was Harbs or Lamar or someone else?
Rivers is a lil bitch
"20+ points streak up to 31 games, that's an NFL record!!"
Let‚Äôs punch PQ while he lays on the ground in pain lol
"For whatever reason, our guys are having a hard time wrapping up."
"At this point just put Lamar in bubble wrap 

The madden curse is looming and everyone else on the team is injured"
"PUT 


DEZ


IN


YOU


COWARDS"
Judon hate way too out of control... makes plays every game
Gus almost injuring Orlando Brown for an extra yard lol wtf
Ok Queen‚Äôs back out there
man Dez was absolutely VIBING on the sideline
"We look back to normal now. Thank God for this second half. What's even better, we look normal with all these injuries!!!"
"It's amazing how we're about to go 6-2 despite the flaws this team has. Just shows that if we can get things really clicking, the sky is the limit. We are essentially winning games with no deep passing game. That's crazy."
"Put the whole damn Wolf Pack in the Hall of Fame. 3 speeches, 1 induction."
24-10...unbeilevable during that first half!!!
"Not only can Tucker kick and sing opera, he can tackle too"
Tucker you beautiful bastard
Fuckin JT on the tackle!
Tucker bb pls dont
"Rivers arm is garbage these days. He keeps screaming at his receivers, but he's trash"
What a turnaround. Amazing
Oh just kneel it you fucks. No one needs to get injured this late in the game
Sack the living shit out of Rivers for extending the game
"Ol' man Rivers  
That ol' man Rivers  
He don't say nothing  
But he must know something"
Excellent second half! That's how we play!
This offense is a joke jesus christ man wtf happened. Greg roman sucks.
Cant even sack a 40 year old
"Humphrey is an idiot for going out everywhere and getting covid, sorry."
This team is so far from contending for a super bowl it‚Äôs staggering. Blowing it last season with every possible advantage will haunt this team for a decade.
Lamar regressing is much cooler with every other facet of our team falling apart at the same time üëå
WHY HAVE HANDS IF YOU NOT GON USE EM? (NEVER)
"I'm gonna go beat off, hopefully it'll give them the power they need."
I would pay $5 for Justin Tucker to kick me in the nuts
This thread is gonna lose their minds if Dez catches a TD lmao
This team will only be as good as the line performs
This gimmicky offense has to end. Just throw the ball or run it.
Block in the back on yannick?
We are going to miss marlo so much this game
Rivers is taunting Bonds at the LOS every play.
This team is never going anywhere until the offensive play calling improves. Roman is awful.
The sun is shining. The birds are chirping. It‚Äôs a beautiful day to fire Greg Roman ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
This is some fucking Jets shit
3rd & 7 feels like 3rd & 1000 for this offense.
I'm convinced our o-line is shit. No Stanley or Yanda really shows
I know hollywood should have caught that but our fucking play calling is complete ass and does nothing to try and help our injured oline.
Is there anything in the playbook that targets the intermediate section of the field? Feel like all our receivers run are short and go routes.
Our offense has been so ass that it even fucks up on defense üòÇ
Refball. They should‚Äôve called the facemasks on the guy grabbing Hills mask too.
THEY HAVE A HAND IN HIS MASK TOO WAHT
We look fucking horrible already
"Colt holding his facemask too?! Wtf is this bullshit man, every week"
Another 100 yard penalty day coming up
LMAOOOO WHY DID HE CHOOSE TO HURDLE HIM
LOL Philip Rivers with the reverse Jones
"Sorry Zoomers, were going back to the early 2000s ravens"
"&#x200B;

Nice fumble recovery Touchdown by  **Chuck Clark**"
Hold my dick hurdle over Rivers
Ravens defense hype as fuck
Holy fuck that was awesome TD. Rivers trying to tackle him was hilarious
Lol @ Rivers
Did Rivers get knocked down by manti teos girlfriend?
Was that Rivers that got hurdled? Lmao
Rivers saw all that purple and said hell na I'm too old for this shit ü§£ü§£
I think Marcus Peters knocked it out. He may be a so so tackler but he loves to try and take the ball.
Did Rivers try to slap him in the dick
"Rivers, ""I'm gonna die like this."""
When is the meme coming
I can‚Äôt get over rivers just eating shit bro üòÇüòÇ
Gotta make that tackle ferguson
i'm sick of these behind the scrimmage plays they are making to get 10-20 yards every time
They're repeatedly attacking the outside.
Apparently the outside run is unstoppable
"Damn, Bonds *almost* made himself famous with that pick!"
I understand we have to play him. But this bonds guy isn‚Äôt even close to being ready.
We managed to get the D goin again so that‚Äôs a great sign
I‚Äôm sorry skura:( you‚Äôre still a good center
Why do we always run with Lamar on 3rd?
The play calling has been abysmal. Jeezus.
The ravens need to get their fucking head out of their ass when it comes to offense. Actually try and innovate with a you g offensive mind instead of old guard has beens. We need to be more aggressive in our approach to WRs too
Roman has to go. I'm not opposed to a mid season OC change. Harbaugh has done it before.
"Our deep passing game is 100% non existent. Nothing happens at all downfield for us, it's all at the line."
Greg Roman calls a slant once maybe twice a year if we're lucky
I get being upset with the play calling but it‚Äôs not like the team is executing the plays either. We love that QB draw when Lamar has the blockers and takes it to the house.
"It would be nice to attack down field a little bit, couple plays of 10 + yards"
How long has it been since our last punt block? Seems like a real long time.
God this feels like late Flacco era as the offense comes on the field now. That excitement is lacking.
Love Marcus Peters but he needs to chill
Peters coming on the field is dumb but I love it.
Lamar taking an unnecessary sack ‚úÖ
LAMAR JUST THROW THE BALL AWAY WTF. THIS HERO SHIT IS KILLING US
I can't remember the last time we tried a deep pass/overthrow
"Guys, this isn't fun to watch."
How the actual fuck is that not running into the kicker lol
The defense is the only reason we are 5-2
play calling is as dogshit as this line is
Judon needs to be fired out of a cannon after this season holy shit why did we tag him
"Judon: oops, I fucked up again

McPhee: I got you, fam"
EVEN HARBS IS FUCKING QUEIT WE HAVE NO FIRE ON THIS TEAM
Judon got an extra second to rush and still got stuffed
Exposed already and its not even half time. Fucking embarrassing
Remember week 1!? That was fun...
Chuck Clark is Rivers nemesis today
That dude took his picture with his glasses on
Fuck Earl Thomas
This team is so fucking undisciplined
"Seriously people defending this team right now, Im a ravens fan until I die, but what exactly are you seeing that gives you any sort of confidence?"
"Remember when we'd score twice in a minute versus the Browns?

Good times"
How are we so bad at penalties? Do the refs hate us that much or are we that much worse at it than every other team?
Colts are gonna get the ball back...
This rn is the worst offensive showing I‚Äôve seen. Even Flacco‚Äôs later years we got some first downs
Throw this whole offense away!!! ü§Æ
Cant even snap the fucking ball correctly. 4 man rush getting home.
"this offense really is just terrible

anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional"
"This fucking offensive line isn't starting caliber, like they aren't good enough to get it done and I don't think thats gonna be fixable inside of a game."
Roman needs to be fired I hope this piss poor game is enough evidence
"Make Bienemy the highest paid coordinator ever


Pipe dream :("
I seriously miss Yanda. He did such a good job on the O-Line
Ravens offense is ass
They have 11 yard rushing. The line is getting killed.
Greg I-Murder-Mobile-QB-Careers Roman. Man fuck this guy
"If we are going to sign lamar to a big contract we NEED to fire roman. We need to see how he does in another system before we sign him to a massive deal cuz how he is playing right now right now is not good. And until we can see if it's a system thing - by putting in a new system - it's very risky to give him a massive deal. I'm just putting it how it is, which breaks my heart cuz I love lamar. I want him to really be a beast and hope its just a system issue!"
Greg 'Adam Gase' Roman
"Goddamn it 2020, RIP Alex a true g"
Watching the highlights... this line is swiss cheese... I'm shocked we even had time for some of those out routes.
Is Ben Powers really so bad that he can‚Äôt see the field? Our line is so dogshit and he still can‚Äôt break into the starting lineup.
Is it too late to bring Kubiak back?
THIS is the offense I remember from last year. PACE. PUSH.
REDZONE = DEZ?!?!
Lamar can‚Äôt play better than that
"Drafted Dobbins in the 2nd round for him to ride the bench every game, nice"
Peters should've picked that too. I hate this game.
He made like 5 steps without jiggling the ball
might as well lose a timeout in a close game for no reason
"Why can't we see the relay again, exactly? Fuck your commercials"
Apologize to harbaugh now
Y'all shut the fuck up from your couches about challenging that fucking play now
What a seriously strange call by the refs. Honestly would never have expected that in a million years. Wild
"Love the fucking adjustement, multiple recieving options on every play. I wanna see us hit outside the numbers more still, but plz let this be a sign that we know what to do"
"Gene you fucked up that call back then, shut the hell up with your revisionist bs"
James urban gotta be calling these plays
give dez a 50/50 ball for the memes
"[https://imgur.com/ZbMZhb8](https://imgur.com/ZbMZhb8)

u/banjoeyo"
Holy shit.  3rd and short and Roman didn't call a QB dive.  Still a dive though.
"""Please God let me bitch at the refs to the fullest of my ability""

- Phillip Rivers"
He just scored 2 TDs in like 10 seconds wow
"Offense has looked really good so far this half, keep it up"
Should be 21-10 now but whatever
"\*Ravens score a rushing TD\*  
Greg Roman: ""Well, how about we just thro...""  
Everyone in this sub: ""Don't you f-cking dare!!!"""
Guys. Can we all agree that the playcalling we great on that goal line series. Don‚Äôt get cute just run fucking forward.
I agree with the announcers. I love the pace as well as trusting Gus
HELL YEAH GRO. THAT I FORM IN THE REDZONE GETS ME ERECT.
Another Rivers pick incoming
I just said ‚ÄúTucker‚Äôs balls look extra crisp today‚Äù out loud and I don‚Äôt regret it at all
Big stop here
We have some major momentum üëç
lamar just threw up the big truzz hands. Sign of a strong drive???
Colts have one call go against them and their fans lose their minds
This offense looks 100% different. This legit can't be GRoman
Who knew we had another TE besides Andrews that can catch a ball
Dobbin's was wide open
JK ALL DAY
Aggressive offense good
yes dobbins!
See what happens when you use dobbins?
what the hell are these shitty snaps
"Gutsy call 

Love Harbs"
1 yard for the Colts in the 2nd half. 1.
DOBBINS IS OUR RB1 OF THE FUTURE!!!!!!! WE GOT A DIAMOND BOYS
I'll bet you 100 bucks Ingram gave a half time speech
"Time of possession in the third quarter: - @BaltimoreLuke

Ravens 13:41

Indianapolis 1:19"
This is a completely different team. Why does it take a half to see these flashes?
Are we in 2019?
I'd put money Lamar was 100% behind that audible.  That's what you want from your QB.
Lamar Jackson playing like 2019
"We‚Äôre taking the colts,,, and we‚Äôre FUCKIN EM UP THE ASS"
Lamar! And finish that block Mark lol!
MVP LAMAR BACK ON THE MENU BOYSS. ORDER UP AND FEAST ON THE BEAUTY
Roman/Harbs put in Dez next series to build chemistry with Lamar during live play!
who got chewed into at halftime for this turn around
he said Free Kodak lmfao
We‚Äôre good again!!!
"Gotta gove credit, the play selection has gotten a lot better this half. I like seeing the swag out there"
Andrew‚Äôs blocked 30 into the shadow zone
THAT WAS NOT A FUCKING FIRST DOWN
Win or lose this has been a gritty performance by a badly mangled Ravens squad.
How did rivers outrun our pass rushers lol
not queen...
Please God. Not Queen...
It doesn‚Äôt seem like we‚Äôre blitzing. We‚Äôre sending 4 guys most of the time
The dudes superbowl ring hat lmao
queen back in
DEFENSE STANDS!!
Holy shit Judon blew that the fuck up
\#getdezacatch
"That played seemed weird, handing it off 5 yards behind the line on 3rd and 1"
"Gus has gotten 80% of carries in this game and is clearly out of gas to some degree. Lets get J.K, who (As much as I like Gus Bus)is our real future at RB, some touches. Also I have him in FF SHOOSH"
Why did the Colts go with Rivers? The Colts are a talented team and they went with a below average QB. I feel like Cam would flourish there.
Thays such a nice streak to break
Go back to the fucking bench Rivers you whiny annoying old fuck.
What kinda garbage team loses to the Ravens when leading at halftime
lamar is way more animated right now on the sidelines
[deleted]
Rivers is discount Brady with the call begging
so we should look to draft high for O-linemen and Wr and TE for next year?
LMAO Rivers quit begging for a flag
Rivers needs to retire
Running behind Bozeman is a recipe for disaster.
I don't know if I've ever seen a 48 yarder that dead center lol.
Elite tackler Justin Tucker
DAMN TUCK ON THE TACKLE
Even tucker goes for the ball lol
Tucker going for the strip
"It's nice to be completely calm when the field goal kicker comes on the field. I'd imagine three, maybe four other teams have that kind of luxury -- but none of them have the automatic three that is Justin Tucker."
"Phillip Rivers is somehow a bigger crybaby than Tom Brady, holy shit."
Tucker better not hurt that golden leg on some bullshit tackle
This will be the first time we ever win in Indy holy shit
"Can we, like, not give them a garbage time TD though?"
"This game showed that good Lamar still exists, it‚Äôs just a matter of figuring out how to keep him consistent."
Hyped for some Sunday Night Football next week! LFG!
huge confidence boost in this team after that
Man I miss last year. Last years team was unstoppable and always looked like they were having fun. This year's team reminds me too much if those bad Flacco years
What's the point of using soliders if they drop fucking passes
"Fuck me. We are losing contain on whichever side McPhee isnt on.

Please god. Take my legs to heal Campbell's."
This game is all Roman if he‚Äôs not gone Monday this organization needs to explain themselves. The illegal formation penalties alone.
We can‚Äôt block. Everything has to be quicker. I‚Äôd hoped Lamar would know this but the fact that it seems greg Roman doesn‚Äôt know this is a serious fucking problem.
Lamar needs to stop looking like a sad ass puppy and get hyped
Halftime adjustment: fire offensive coordinator.
This offense is abysmal rn *sigh*
Lamar doesn‚Äôt trust his O Line. He doesn‚Äôt trust his OC. He doesn‚Äôt trust his receivers. And thus he isn‚Äôt playing with the same fire. It is really sad to watch.
"Fuck Greg Roman, all my homies hate Greg Roman."
Man this team is turning into a dumpster fire at rapid speed
"you better stop fucking tweeting if you cant even hold on to a five yard pass, Hollywood."
defense has done more than their job. we need the offense to step up here
Yeah I think I‚Äôm officially done thinking we‚Äôre contenders... in what fucking world are we contenders. If we lose today Greg Roman needs to be gone by this week. No way in hell is this acceptable after last years success
Damn they got the Geek Squad dude from Best Buy to kick
"people who wanna say we're 5-2 to defend anything need to look at the schedule 

team hasnt been playing like a 5-2 team whatsoever"
Ty Hilton is out for the Colts
fuck Phillip Rivers
"he's up walking, please please please be ok"
"Injuries are coming for us this year, damn man"
BURGER BURGER BURGER
Please god no we need Campbell
Less than 60% completion rate in 4 of 5 games üò¨
Bozeman got pushed way back
Was Bozemen supposed to pull but he got blown up?
"So ready to move on from Roman, his shit has gone stale..."
"pitching it was not the move, their linebacker was right there"
"Roman this is the first drive, what the fuck"
Greg Roman has had one good game this year and the rest have been absolutely awful.
Fuck you Greg Roman. Seriously
this playing call has got to stop
nice on track to get another 10+ flags
Roman has to do something this week man that dude is so bad
Its going to be a long day
Trash call and miss the blatant hold in the backfield. Its last week all over again.
*Ralph Wiggum* haha we‚Äôre in danger
Losing our 2 best defenders hurts a lot
We have to have the most pass interference calls against our D in the NFL.
I wanna question that PI call. Looked like Clark was on the ground when the ball was thrown? But of course we can't get a replay.
Were good.  Just one score.  Let's go get it back
Let‚Äôs watch offence come out throwing for an incomplete. Run for 3 yards and then out on a 3rd and long.
Sigh. Nice to see Lamar audible tho
Cmon hollywood
starting early with ref bullshit.
Here we go with the penalties
Oh my god are you serious. He was holding Hills facemask for a couple seconds before he grabbed back
"Harbaugh please, do something."
If you wanna be a soulja you HAVE to catch the damn ball
It seems like teams took away Mark Andrew‚Äôs and put a spy or two on Lamar and we just can‚Äôt make plays anymore.
Our defence is better at offence than our offence is
"FLY CHUCKIE FLY

FALL PHIL FALL"
Hurdling over rivers.
Did Rivers just fall down on his own?
‚ÄúLook at me. I‚Äôm the offense now.‚Äù
MP JUICEMAN PICKING UP WHERE HUMP WOULDVE BEEN
Chuck making up for the PI!!!
Oh man that picture ove rivers being hurdled ü§£ü§£ü§£
Good time to mention phiLLLLip rivers was 0-4 against maryland in college
Why does Wink think he can leave these 3rd string DBs on an island?
Defense is and always will be the Raven way.
Chuck jumping Rivers made me laugh so hard
"Did Rivers seriously just straight up fall down unassisted?!  If so, that‚Äôs amazing lol"
seriously can they call oline holding once against our opponent?
Feels like the Washington game but with a better team. Screens and bad tackling.
We may as well make Wink the OC
Defense is really good. But almost every single misdirection play fucks us
"Oh God, I can't wait for the meme of Rivers on that play"
It sucks seeing how creative the Colts offense is.
Seriously tho why didnt Clark just run around Rivers why go over him.lol
Bonds you dumbass
Good stand by the defense. Hopefully offense now has had a chance to breathe and can set their own tempo.
Baby you had that
Throw the ball down the field please
Why did they not punt  into the sideline? Easily make the distance. Punt and pin it at the 5 surely?
Skura has a boo boo
What the hell was that fake reverse to Duvernay? I hate this play calling. Let Lamar get passing reps. Pound the ball.
I think we should move to a no huddle offense with lamar being able to run teams would be fucked
CALL A FUCKING SLANT AND LAMAR WILL RUN IF IT'S NOT THERE
"FUCK YOU. GREG ROMAN.

STOP BEING PREDICTABLE"
Bozeman getting beat inside and just watching LJ get tackled.
Its getting to the point where I'm concerned this offense is going to ruin the confidence of Lamar permanently.
The thing that I'm honestly refreshed about is that I now know the offensive regression isn't Lamar
insane how week after week of dogshit playcalling we still score 20+
Pathetic joke of a fucking play call wtf man
Can Jackson not run it every 3rd down pls?
[deleted]
Done with Greg Roman
"So yeah, Yanda was a HOF caliber player and he wasnt adequately replaced and it matters a lot..."
alright im over romans play calling
"So looks like Yanda was the only reason we were good last year...

Just kidding but wtf is going on"
Roman gotta go
We dont have the line to run like last year anymore
Leonard is so good and our playcalling is so limp dicked
Maybe our defense can score 3 touchdowns today
Are there more than five plays in the playbook? Seriously doesn‚Äôt seem like it sometimes.
Greg romans playcalling has been so one dimensional these last few weeks
"All I can say is if we're about hundreds of millions of dollars on Lamar's next contract, he better show up in games like this. Let's be aggressive and let Lamar throw it."
WE HAVE THE SECOND WORST PASSING ATTACK IN THE NFL. WE ARE BARELY BETTER THAN ADAM GASE‚ÄôS JETS
I don‚Äôt understand how our play calling continues to be this bad
I am sorry yall can downvote me all you want but Lamar looks scarily similar to RG3 in 2013... at least Robert had the excuse of coming back from a shredded knee
Juice man please don‚Äôt do that
Peters is such a fucking dog
LEAVE ROMAN IN INDY AFTER THIS GAME THANKS
I‚Äôll take that every day from Mekari. MP a real one too.
Peters defending Lamar is the kind of fire this team needs y‚Äôall crazy for yellin at him flock up boyz
Lamar doesn't even think to throw the ball away
Jackson does not look calm at all
Lamar really likes to run backwards
Fire Greg Roman for allowing that sack and then holding on 3rd and long. Im tired of this terrible offensive coordinator!
3&35. Cool
3rd and 35 üòÇ this offense is shit
Team is playing so fucking garbage right. Do we hold the record for flag thrown? It feels like we do. Zero teamwork zero everything. This beyond fucking embarrassing. Team is collapsing every game and its showing today
"Well, at least the special teams unit is still top notch."
This is good old mid 2010‚Äôs Ravens football...
This is the first year I have seen where I feel like our fundamentals are incredibly lacklustre. I think we had one year where we didn't tackle but at least we could line up appropriately
52 yards in the half yikes
Can't believe that didn't get flagged
"This would be the perfect time to get a 2 minute drill rolling, get the offense and Lamar some confidence and at least go in with 3 at the half."
How are we even still in this game
Gene Steratore changing stories on the same hit week by week
"Not sure theres enough time to move down the field, just hoping Lamar doesn't throw an interception."
Last week Lamar lost his first game where he was leading at half. Let's see if he can get his first win after trailing at halftime.
MORE FLAGS YA DONT SAY
Aaaaaaand more flags. This team is lost.
can't wait for the offense to do nothing again
We need 21 to return to being our hype man. I want to see him on the sidelines pumping the guys up and bringing the swagger back. Everytime I see Lamar sitting there looking sad it just brings back too many Flacco memories
These penalties by us are out of control this year
This doesn't even look like a fringe playoff team today
FUCK YOU GREG ROMAN
Guess Roman looking at Popeyes menu instead of calling logical plays
Embarrassing. Very close to incompetence.
Offensive line is getting spanked
Play calling is awful
Holy shit this o line is tragic
Skura has made more bad snaps than good. Yanda made Skura look good
"Shit playcalling, shit offensive line, undisciplined penalties. Really is looking grim for us mid-season :("
#1 run offense in the league and they ran it 10 times in the entire 1st half
"That was an unbearable first half, jfc"
If we can't get tucker attempting a field goal something is wayyyyyy wrong
The Oline is just a wet kleenex today
watching Rivers get cucked on the fumble recovery was worth the price of us being very boring for 29:55 seconds
So when do we fire Greg Roman?
Can yall stop with Harbaugh he has fired multiple OCs before he knows when to move on
Such a weird time for a game to start.  Are we ready flock?
Can we fire Roman now?
"Hosts: *all having a somber conversation about the death of Alex Trebek* 

CBS: THE NFL ON CBS IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY VERIZON!!!!!!!!!"
"Since we all want him fired, who do we replace as OC? Who do we promote or is there even anyone available?"
Can we hire Lamar's College OC. He knows how to use Lamar in the perfect situations also in college the teams' o-line wasn't good at all but still found ways to make plays with him.
I‚Äôm not even mad anymore just disappointed
"Well, good tackle, Hollywood"
"This team is ridiculously snake bitten, everytime we get something going on offence we have a fumble"
Cant believe Lamar caused Edwards to fumble
"LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

somehow this team this year finds a way."
Guess Lamar should have done it all the drive and kept it there
This game is literally torture.
Lmao this is such a different team than last year. Its fucking shocking.
"Good: We were finally moving the ball

Bad: We fumbled"
Fuck he took 3 steps could that be a fumble?
What kind of fucking challenge is that?!?
Who needs timeouts anyways. Jesus christ
There‚Äôs zero chance this gets overturned.
That drive was pretty great until the fumble though. If we can come back and do that again on the next drive it will be amazing
#Galaxy Brain Harbs!!!
I think the refs just cheated for us
I WANT EVERYONE WHO SAID IT'S A STUPID CHALLENGE TO GO FUCK THEMSELVES. FUCK YOU.
I‚Äôd like to point out that Dez Bryant is to thank for that being ruled an interception. Already contributing!
LMAO NO FUCKING WAY
Someone on this sub called a pick and forced fumble for peters. Didn‚Äôt think it would happen tho
"As a Colts fan, I would be fucking livid with the score and the way this game goes in every aspect."
The Ravens changed something at the half. The offense is clicking (outside that damn fumble)
"Say what you want about Hollywood, he spoke his mind and it worked. Can‚Äôt knock him for it, especially when he‚Äôs backing it up"
Fuck y'all for doubting btw
Look guys way too many of us calling the other half fucked up for saying it was a bad challenge.  This sub is get to me toxic when we are not performing.  Eat your words and move on.
Is it just me that prefers Ian Eagle or Kevin Harlan over the Tony Romo crew?
hope Leonard is okay
"alex collins just got a carry and went nowhere

flashbacks"
"It‚Äôs interesting to see the half time adjustments so far, we are pressing our linemen forward on every play, so even in pass protection we‚Äôre having them use a run blocking technique. It‚Äôs creating space and allowing them to play aggressive."
Lmao i‚Äôd be pissed if i were a colts fan
#GUS BUS REDEMPTION
"Let's goooooo, great adjustments."
Anyone see what Mark Andrews was upset about? We get 42 replays on shit we don‚Äôt want to see and 0 replays on anything we do
Let Lamar cook?
Forgot Yannick was on the fucking team
Let‚Äôs dominate now.
Lamar got his zip back? üëÄ
"Oh look, a Miles Boykin sighting!"
Seriously where TF has this been all year?
Let. Lamar. Cook.
"Damn it, I new the Panthers were gonna cock that up"
Colts field is terrible today.
Go for it. Just not a draw plz.
"I know a lot of people have been making this comparison, but damn. Dobbins looking like a carbon copy of Ray Rice. Just a tick quicker imo."
Vintage Llama
Did Greg Roman randomly remember which team he coordinates for? This is actually an enjoyable drive for once!
"I seriously want to know what happened at half. 

This is a completely different offense"
looks like we woke up
TOUCHDOWN LAMAR LETS' FUCKING GO!!!
Jackson is good at running
What a tale of two halves here.  Jackson found whatever he was lacking.
#LFG
Great play call
Look at this dude doing spins and shit
"Okay we see you now, Reigning MVP üëÄ"
"**LAMAR JACKSON, ALL ALONE, FAKES THE DEFENSE WITH THE BOOTLEG AND TAKES THE FOOTBALL INTO THE ENDZONE FOR SIX!!!!!**"
"Yeah, Lamar is back. It‚Äôs just good to see him having fun out there again."
Andrews had a monster block on Lamar‚Äôs touchdown run. You love to see it.
"Wtf, where is this coming from?"
I‚Äôm so happy rn I really hope this our offenses bounce back game
"This is what frustrates me about our offense. Everybody knows that they can do better, like they're doing right now, and that's what makes it worse when they play like dog crap"
Rumour has it GR is stuck on the shitter and some random dude is calling plays in his absence.
>Really good play call by Greg Roman. Colts get sucked inside and Lamar Jackson takes it outside on 3rd-and-inches and Jackson scores from 9 yards out. Ravens lead 21-10 and **they've now scored 20-plus for an NFL record 31 consecutive games** - @jeffzrebiec)
"Fucking great drive. But Darius Leonhard is a fucking beast. I feel it's harder now to stick out at LB since teams run less and you have to be versatile rather than just a big hitter, but he's all over the field this game."
Madabuike is going to be our secret weapon
U let Rivers do that to you D?
Jesus christ how do you let that conversion happen
"Oh no.. not Queen. Come RotY, you got this."
The reason I‚Äôm critical of Roman is because he is so reluctant to evolve with Lamar. That first half he was calling the game like it was 2018 first start ever and not the reigning MVP.
Queen ate that hope he‚Äôs good
Oh just fade me fam
Go ahead and keep that clock running. That is fine with me
Y'all should know the Queen never dies
Close it out with the run game. I will say this game has given me hope because of the way we rallied. We also came back from being behind.
bring Dez in you cowards
I'm actually kinda confused how we just turned it around. Was pacing that big of a deal?
Grover moves well for a guy born in the 1840's.
What the hell was Mekari doing on that play
Still cant get over that challenge. Amazing call by Coach Harbaugh
"Steelers Cowboys hasn't been an actual rivalry since the 70s, 80s at the latest. Get the fuck outta here. Steelers are gonna cream the Cowboys anyways and everyone knows that"
"I know it's not going to happen, but if the Cowboys beat the Steelers..... Man that'd be sweet"
Cry me a rivers
"More points

More points"
Every excuse in the book to lose this game and if they win I will be blown away by what Harbaugh is able to get out of his squads year after year.
"Barring a Minnesota event, we should pull this off"
Tucker is so much better than any other kicker. It constantly amazes me how straight his kicks travel
That was so straight it could've hit the hand rail if there wasn't a net.
Omg that scream Tucker let out when he kicked it
Good to see Lamar enjoying himself on the sideline
JT with the tackle lmao
Tucker wrapping up lol
Tucker with the tackle! He does it all!
Justin Tucker out there making tackles!
Tucker with the tackle üí™
YEAH JT MAKE THAT FUCKIN TACKLE
What is going on there
"Greg Roman must have gotten bitched at during halftime cuz that play calling was much, much better"
Our offense is more boring to watch than the Flacco days right now. Just so plain and nothing exciting at all. Something has to change
Didn't that guy demand to get the ball more?
The Colts got a 3 and out they should fire their offensive coordinator.
And some of y‚Äôall still think everything is fine and dandy lmao
It doesn't seem like the Ravens staff are coaching Lamar at all. He's regressing from week to week.
..... we have 55 total yards on offense.
Ill start it here.  Blame of the Game: Greg Roman
"Colts fans: go to your own sub, nerds"
Defense playing really good considering half of them couldn‚Äôt even practice
idc about the down votes. I love this team but they are not as good as we all think they are..
"It would be 10-0 if not for our defense. 


Remember that."
Damn. That water girl had a phat ass!
80 year old Phillip Rivers is going to walk all over us while our MVP lead offense can't do jack shit.
Ok Lamar let‚Äôs not suck ass here
‚ÄúUse yo souljas ‚Äú precedes to drop the fucking pass
Lol @ you guys saying cut Bonds. We have 3 active CBs. Good luck with that.
dropping judon into coverage?????????????????????????????????????????
Stop putting Judon in fucking coverage.
Currently it‚Äôs looking like 7 straight games of Lamar not having over 250 passing yards. Something needs to change fast
"I love that Marquise Brown made a big deal about not getting enough targets, then drops the fucking ball when passed to. We definitely need to look into more options in the passing game."
Ready to lose NNN with a 40 point win today
Is this a short movie about the Colts' move away from Baltimore?
"When I hear this guy pronounce his name ""eye-in"" instead of Ian I always think of the Key & Peele substitute teacher skits"
Fuck Robert Irsay
Lotta banners not a lot of hardware ü§£
Campbell? FUCK
NOOOo campbell please no
Not campbell
Walking off on his own so hopefully not too serious
He looks fine
We're starting down the 49ers path...
The injury plague our old friend üò≠
Hell yeah we sniffed out 2 screens on the first drive already.
Well that was terrible
I know the D is tired as hell with how often with how our Offense goes 3 and out.
FUCK YOUNG SHELDON
"Oh nice, just got here and we‚Äôre already losin it? 

I‚Äôll have another drink"
If they start spreading it out It could get ugly.
"Wow a simple crossing route, we should get an OC who knows that one"
Bonds is the new Kyle Arrington
God bonds sucks
Covid week hit the team hard.
These are the plays we should be running on offense dude...
Just throw it to Dez every play screw it
Clear PI.
"Alright, time for atrocious play calling."
"Bonds just walked alongside with their lineman, at least pretend you‚Äôre trying man"
Fuck it.  Unleash Dez!
"Alright Lamar. Time to wake up from your four week slumber, son."
Can‚Äôt wait to see our coaching staff get spooked cause we are behind by 7
Whatever bro we need to be down some games so Lamar can at least try to play from behind
I feel bad for Harbaugh. He is an excellent coach but his coordinators fail him too often specifically on Offense & Dean Pees era defense
Well we‚Äôre behind so Roman is going to go ahead and call deep bombs for incompletions the rest of the game
"Uggg, our defense is wrecked with injuries man. Losing humph and campbell is a death sentence."
Can Lamar hit that mute button on Greg?
"Humphrey, LJ Fort and Campbell all out not to mention the lack of practice this week. People need to stop acting like this is gonna be a normal defensive game."
Whelp guess I‚Äôll take 9-7 and a SB over 14-2 and one and done
"can't even snap it right, this is going bad"
Elite play design
Now throw it to Dez lol
How did we run on the Steelers?
Come on Hollywood
What an awful drop
What the fuck play was that he held his mask the entire way
If you're gonna ask for the ball you gotta catch it when it comes to you...
It will be malpractice if this organization does not do whatever it takes to find some weapons at the receiver position this offseason.
Soulja boi with the fucking drop
"This sub: You‚Äôre not a REAL FAN if you even THINK about criticizing Lamar!!!


Also this sub after Hollywood drops a pass: WORST RECEIVER ON THIS TEAM GET HIM OUT OF HERE I HOPE HE NEVER PLAYS AGAIN"
I take back my words immediately! üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
OLD MAN RIVERS DOWN
yes Chuck Clark!!!!
The ghost that tripped Daniel Jones strikes again!
Stunt on these hoes Chuck
Our defense will make up for our sorry offense at least!
Damn Marlon is rubbing off on Peters.
Gimme dat CHUCK FUCK!
Ravens defense baby! I was getting a little concerned
My boi Chuck Clark
Our defense is our offense! Let's go!!!
How nice of Phil to just get out of the way like that
There we go! Momentum shift?!?
I love Chuck Clark so fucking much.  What an amazing leader and damn good player.
GOOD LUCK CHUCK
How'd them balls look Phil üòÇ
I love Rivers on his back like a helpless fat kid and Chuck hurdling over him.  Lol
Wow did we ever need that
Isn‚Äôt it crazy how every time we force a fumble the ball just bounces right into one of our players hands
Lol. That hurdle over the Limp Rivers
I went to pee at the wrong time and completely missed it üò≠
The defence is just getting completely shredded on the edge.
"Can we just try and stop an outside run, maybe?"
[deleted]
Nice hands feet
of course cant even take a free pick
Bonds you could have redeemed yourself.
Bonds letting opportunity slip through his fingers
This is the last time I pick any players from my fav team on draftkings. I have too high expectations for these guys smfh..
I like the dump off there actually. He sometimes doesn‚Äôt take those.
4 dudes unblocked sprinting at Duv
Lol running the flacco to rice dumpoff offense
Who would have thought that short passes and end arounds wouldn't work if people don't respect your intermediate/deep passing game.
Just quit with the shitty QB draw
Why is this man keep calling running plays on 3rd downs like wtf ??!!!
that fucking play lmao
Jokes on Charles Davis  we dont even have our WRs running routes
I don‚Äôt understand how our offense is this bad
These fucking QB draws oh my god
If this team has any sense of pride. Greg Roman gets fired.
"This is atrocious, how the fuck are we playing like it's the early 2000's???

Our defense is the only reason this isn't embarrassing us"
I'm applying for the Ravens offensive coordinator job today.
What happened to Lamar throwing the ball down the middle for 20 yards?? Haven‚Äôt seen it in a while üò©
y'all blaming Roman 100% when the line should get like 70-80% of the blame
They need to start calling the blocks in the back on those screens
now that we‚Äôve made the stop **CAN THIS OFFENSE PLEASE FUCKING DO SOMETHING**
Rivers is such a bitch. All the whine of Brady without being the GOAT.
"Yay, Ngakoue disrupted Rivers' throw on 3rd down!"
When‚Äôs the last time Lamar took a deep shot downfield this year? I can‚Äôt remember.
Well I‚Äôm curious (maybe you guys would know) more about that stat of Ravens vs. Colts. How many of those wins (at Indy) are because of Peyton Manning?
play calling on offense is god awful
Boyle wide open in flat but Lamar wont get off the first read
Remember the first game against the browns when Lamar actually had a pocket to work with? What happened
Dude was in hella traffic and he still threw it there
They throw the exact same spots every play.
Lamar doing his best Flacco impression last few weeks
"At least our team sticks up for our QB

Poor Andy Dalton lmao"
Pussy ass play by 32
Hell yah love Peters getting involved there at least there‚Äôs someone on this team with fire
Marcus Peters wants all the smoke
That was dirty af
Here is our weekly illegal formation.
We went from offensive powerhouse to offensive garden shed really quickly
Romans offense is toast. It‚Äôs been figured out. It doesn‚Äôt help that our oline is really bad too but everything is at play to make this offense just bad
"OL predictably shakey...for all those bitching about this or that, if you cant block anyone you are going to struggle"
Check it down to Ray Rice
How was that 2nd hit not a defenseless receiver?
"The way this offense looks does not give me hope for our success down the road, mainly the playoffs"
And where tf is Dez? We have nothing to lose from an offensive standpoint
HARBAUGH DECOSTA YOUR OC IS RUINING YOUR GENERATIONAL FRANCHISE QB...
This offensive line is killing us. Lamar seems... less shifty this season? Madden curse is real
"Ravens Offense letting down the Ravens Defense, tale as old as time."
"Starting to think last year was a fluke. Playcalling is horrendous, receivers suck, O-line is terrible and Lamar has looked exceptionally bad."
absolute BULLSHIT roughing the passer
judon is gone next year
All the hate for Roman should be directed as love to Martindale. He‚Äôs so good and has been under appreciated so far this season.
I will never understand why the live video gets the smaller view when they do the picture in picture replay
Dejected Lamar looks like dejected Flacco circa 2017
Our mistakes are entirely our own. Aggravating.
Why are we so undisciplined? I swear we have 10 penalties against us a game
What can judon do?
Judon 20 yds downfield what
I'm being honest this looking like a 9-7 team boys with the way this offense plays
Thats a penalty
"We got lucky on that play, should have definitely been a penalty."
Almost at the point where I hope Colts blow us out just so this is a wake up call
I can‚Äôt wait for Ryan and mink to be like don‚Äôt worry probowl Mark Ingram is gonna turn this into a number 1 offense fuck those clowns
"So, we're gonna make halftime adjus... lol I can't even finish that joke of a sentence."
cut down the penalties man holy shit. every phase of the game we‚Äôre doing stupid things
Think we'll see a 10yd pass???
How many penalties does it take for the Ravens to start actually start fixing it
It's crazy we're only down by 3. Feels like we're losing by a lot more
This offense is abysmal...
I think i just seen 1 wr run a route on 3rd üòÇ
This is fucking pathetic
Shoutout to Drake and the Madden Cover
Better chance of scoring on defense than offense
Should we move mekari to center?
"This game is not as close as the score indicates. We are complete dogshit and are not winning this with the way the offense is playing right now. Lamar looks pathetic , his body language is awful. GRo is trash as usual. 

We are not shooting our selves in the foot. We flat out are not a good team and we are regressing, not getting better."
"Run , Run , Pass to give the colts the ball back.

Leave Greg Roman in Indy."
"This team went from on fire to fizzled out. 
Something is killing this team chemistry. It needs to be fixed. 

I'm over my buddy saying that the Indy Defense is some force making this team look this bad."
Greg Roman as HC the team would go 0-16
Lamar needs to be much better and Roman is fucking trash
"Dez enthusiast here, has he seen the field or any targets yet today? I'm out shopping."
Indy defense is playing fast
Fuck Greg Roman on god. Not another week with him as OC. Making Lamar look so bad when u can take us all they way. Fucking Roman calling horrible plays at crucial moments
A first down ü§Ø
2 first downs am I dreaming LFG
Now THIS is pod racing
"Hey, look everybody! Offense!"
DONT FUCKING JINX IT NOBODY SAY ANYTHING
We have more yards in this opening drive than the entire first half!  They serve some Red Bull at halftIme?
You gotta be fucking kidding me......
edwards can‚Äôt do that man. first drive and a chance to gain momentum and we do that.
The Gus bus ran out of gas
Nice tackle by brown at least :/
Ah there it is
"COME ON GUYS, WE HAVE A PULSE, LET'S GO"
Rare peters drop
"Basic. Fucking. Shit.

Do the Basic.Fucking.Shit"
"Brown may be afraid to take a hit, but he'll make one himself"
A challenge? Bruh
Just coming to the thread to see how that turnover was Lamars fault.
It‚Äôs like we got the car started finally to crash into a fucking wall
Bold call Harbs but I ain't mad at you for it
Awful challenge. We might need this timeout later.
Ok Harbaugh lol. Guess he didn‚Äôt learn from last week
I wouldn't even challenge that in Madden.
HARBAUGH IM SORRY LMAOO
HOLY SHIT THAT WAS REVERSED????
Holy shit how did we win that challenge
Harbaugh you fucking genius
Dude I didn't think there was any chance that was a pick omg!
I was ready to shit on Harbaugh for blowing a timeout but he showed me.
That was a GIFT
That would get me mad as a colts fan. I don‚Äôt see that at all tbh.
I‚Äôve been watching football for 15 years and I still have no idea what constitutes a catch.
I tip my cap to Coach Harbaugh. I'd never thought that was going to be reversed.
Put Peters in at WR
"Hollywood, my guy. Not so bad getting hit. Keep it going."
Our passing game of all things is suddenly carrying
"and thats why harbaugh is one of the best coaches in the league, belee dat!"
Remember the Heisman package.
I hope he‚Äôs good but sit out the rest of the game please
"Say what you want about Lamar‚Äôs play, I still love seeing him help other players up and checking on them."
I NEED A MP JUICEMAN WALLPAPER THIS WEEK PLEASE
"I'd love to see us throw in Dez in the redzone, even if just as a decoy. Dude was always so lethal there."
How many of you think we should double dip on OL in the draft this year with 2 of our top  3 picks?
Lamar looking POISE
Damn I hope Leonard is ok. Hate seeing guys get hurt.
"James urban to Roman: ""Let me call some plays big dawg"""
I think roman read the sub and decided to try the last 2 drives because he knows we would actually call for his job 100% serious
Looking back we'd be fucked if we only had Gus and Justice Hill
Something big time changed at half time. Finally we find ourselves in a game where we‚Äôre capable of making half time adjustments
Championship teams make adjustments at the half so this bodes well I guess
He was very clearly in
ILL TAKE IT GUS
I remember someone named Jackson giving his team some of his Sekrit Stuff during halftime to make them improve...
"Im telling yall, urban calling these plays. Not 1 qb run on the goaline aint possible for Roman"
HONK HONK HONK
now do it again
Okay offense do that for the rest of the season I‚Äôll forgive you
Points off of a turnover. Magical
Offense is clicking a bit more this half...not sure if they saw something or what but I won‚Äôt complain.
Looks like we found some offense at halftime... hope we have more where that came from!
Damn did we actually make halftime adjustments for once?
It's so nice to see Tucker on the field again.
"That was agonizing no lie 3 quarters for 1 TD. Coaches need to be held accountable for these terrible performances. Tired of the after game,  ""on to the next one"" speech."
"Now that we‚Äôre in a good mood, I‚Äôd like to point out that after Dobbins [edit: it was Gus] fumbled, he punched it out on the guy who recovered. That was pretty dope."
colts fans dropping by to instigate: peyton is a bronco and considers himself a bronco
Now watch as Greg Roman never uses an up tempo offense ever again
I hate the archaic nature of playcalling still prevalent in the league. Like omg what a surprise the offense finds a rhythm playing with some pace and the QB gaining some confidence.
What's the latest with Calais?
"Thanks for adding to our meme catalogue, Lamar ü§ôü§ôü§ô"
If they show the sideline be on the lookout for James Urban with a playsheet calling plays.
How the fuck has Chark gotten me nearly 25 fantasy points with a 3rd stringer QB
This second half might be one of the first halfs of this year that the offense feels like last year's offense.
rare boykin sighting
Anybody else is just waiting to see Dez on the field for one play at least? lol
This is so much like 2019... KEEP IT UP
I really hope we see Dez more. Seems like a waste of an activation if not.
Jackson accidentally faked himself into the sixth dimension
Fuck injuries
Dobbins was open.
DOBBINS WAS WIDE FUCKING OPEN LAMAR
Midseason offensive MVP is Bozeman
"Take the easy fucking completion, dude."
Lamar needs to take the easy completion there. He had Dobbins and Snead wide open. Get it to them and let them get the 1st.
What is up with skura today?
I think I can snap better and possibly block better and I‚Äôm a 5‚Äô3 woman
"I‚Äôll lowkey take a field goal as long as we don‚Äôt turn it over. 

Rivers is beyond washed"
Defences are so clued in on the qb draw that we can expose outside runs on those plays
"Geez, Dobbins is good."
You take that Unitas jersey off right fuckin' now.
"First Half offense: bad 

Second half offense: good"
Did they find 2019 Lamar in the locker room?üòÇ This is fun to watch now
We have 174x more yards than them in this half
Lamar Jackson is 18/22 today (81%)
GRo lowkey calling some heat rn and you guys real fuckin quiet
Im loving the bewildered look on Rivers' face everytime the camera pans to him.
Credit to Lamar for handling these shit snaps
LFGGGG
Beautiful
"Welcome back last year's offense. Greg, did you learn anything on this drive?"
ACTION JACKSON
That‚Äôs the one
BEAUTIFUL LET'S FUCKING GO
LLAMA
you would think a lamar bootleg is the most obvious play of all time but it worked
Inject that drive into my veins
Lamar got his mojo back
Is this this years version of last years seahawks game?
Way to snap out of the coma guys!
LLAMA
Fun Lamar is soooo fucking dangerous and sooo much better than angry Lamar. Just keep having fun man
Who knew calling balanced and 60/40 run heavy series makes the Ravens score..
Andrews obliterated his defender on that TD run lol
Lamar has awoken
Time to get mom a nintendo switch
Glad to see we went back to last years offense. Someone told Greg to cop on at half time.
This is what happens when we start calling throws downfield that develop quickly
Wouldn‚Äôt it be fuckin crazy if we found out Harbaugh took play calling away from Roman at the half
I think we're finally gonna end that horrible losing at halftime streak
 Colts defense fighting over who‚Äôs turn is it to destroy Bozeman
"I'm hard, hard as rock, once you make that coochie pop! 

POP THAT COOCHIE..  POP POP THAT COOCHIE BABY!"
The colts have awoken a beast...and he's HUNGRY!!!!!
We gotta have a different playcaller. I don't see otherwise how this offense just became so different than the rest of the year
Throw the first half team to the trash and please keep the second half team. We look so competent dammit
Rivers is so bitch made
Andrews blocked that guy into a completely different sport.
"I just want to see Lamar run this ""new"" offense. Our lama has an edge this second half."
Not our Queen.
Damn if they didnt get that i think that was game
Looks like a stinger
Can 2020 stop exerting its influence on this team?
I can't believe Rivers is extending plays on us...
That Ravens fan in the stand th0
"All good it looks like, may just had the wind knocked out of him"
Ferguson has made some really nice tackles today
they are killing the clock themselves
QUEEN IS IMMORTAL JUST LIKE ELIZABETH
Indy's burning a lot of clock for not a lot of gain on this drive
Let's go D force a turnover
JUDON lol
Judon made a play like you want from a franchise tag guy.
That's a terrible situational play calling kick it lol
"RAN OVER THE RB TO HIT THE ARM, BODY BUILT BY TACO BELL"
I just wanna know what the halftime speech in the lockeroom was. I need that
"Run the clock, add a fg, go home."
Man I would've liked a little more misdirection on that play. Had a chance to basically seal the game.
Looked like OPI to me
No flag?  I'm impressed
I hate rivers.
Shocked there was no flag lol
Rivers is a whiny bitch
Shut up Rivers
"THERES ANOTHER HIT, TERRY BONDS!"
Rivers is such a bitch
Wow Bonds didn't get burnt on that 3rd down holy shit
4:20 left. Time to spark up.
Dobbins plays a lot of Madden
Legit right down the middle. Love me some tucker!!!!
"Tucker just wants to remind people that he's the best there is, best there was, best there ever will be."
"As a straight guy, I have no problem admitting that I would totally have Justin Tucker‚Äôs babies!"
TUCKER THE FUCKER with the tackle
Tucker the fucker bro chill lmao
Tucker tackle
Tucker really can do it all!
Go ahead Tuck! Saved a TD return
That popcorn machine leaves so many questions
Finally call the block in the back on the Colts. Been getting away with it on screens all day.
Why was there no 10 second run off for the block in the back?
Guys we actually came back at the half!
"Bonds hasn't been spectacular, but he has been way better than expected this game"
Good to see a game that wasn‚Äôt clusterfucked w penalties on our end
"Big win, felt good after the adjustments made at the half"
"I went to work after the half, so I wasn't watching. I think I'm bad luck when I watch.

For proof, I point to the time walked into the room right as Cundiff fucked up.

So uh... yall are welcome."
If Greg Roman is still our OC for next season idk what I would do...
[deleted]
What a stupid fucking play on 3rd and 3.
"Have a bad feeling about this game, especially if our offense stays stagnant"
I'm sure the defense is really going to appreciate this 3-and-out coming up
We fucking suck
Bitches on twitter but can‚Äôt catch the ball. Nice.
Can‚Äôt whine on social media about not getting the ball and then not make that catch.
This offence is just boring. It‚Äôs just not it. Week after week they just look lost.
"Nothing but screens and jet sweeps, and it's working"
Some of you guys defending Roman on here he is ruining our franchise QB that‚Äôs the reason he needs to get the fuck outta here
How are we not 2-5 instead?
It should be noted that the last two weeks we‚Äôve played two top 5 defenses
This game makes me wanna drink
WHY IS JUDON COVERING A RECEIVER
We have to be the most undisciplined team in football. Just a flag every 3-5 plays on us
Offensive line: bad. Receivers: bad. Lamar: bad. Greg Roman: bad.
Any realistic chance we fire Roman this week?
Why didn't a raven fall down and fake injury
Colts DBs are literally laughing at our Offense rn smh.....
Let lamar throw deep cant be worse than this
"Imagine if we had the best kicker in the league, like that Butker dude"
Let's get healthy and maul the Pats
I swear I think half this sub actually hates the Ravens sometimes.
"I have a really bad feeling that it doesnt matter how anemic our offense looks, Harbaugh is gonna keep him around for at least another year or two. I love Harb but he's stubborn af with his coordinators."
"STOP THE COUNT

STOP THE COUNT

STOP THE COUNT

CAN‚ÄôT LET BLUE WIN"
I forgot how depressing this sub can be when it‚Äôs tied in the start of the 2nd
go tweet that one hollywood ffs
Are...are we bad?
catch the ball soulja
Hollywood showing again he ain‚Äôt a #1
"I can't stand Rivers, watching him get run over there was amazing lmao"
"One of our biggest weaknesses defensively is misdirection, that was exposed in the chiefs game"
We literally shit our pants every time there is an end around or a WR screen. It‚Äôs almost impressive how bad we are at covering them
Roman isn‚Äôt trusting Lamar to go through his reads.
This offense is an embarrassment this season
Need 35 yards and still won't chuck it down field. Pathetic.
Indy is a dirty ass franchise.
"This is fucking embarrassing. Undisciplined, zero creativity or jump. Ravens not even looking like an NFL team right now. This is becoming a sickening theme."
"Gettin a tad bit worried now boys lmao
This offense today"
"If we keep this up we could miss the playoffs, even with the extra spot."
" Just want to go back 2019 and all the fun we had. Is that too much to ask? 

üò≠üò≠"
"Colts fans bitching about the pick, and I can't even blame them"
So..... where are all of yall talking all this shit about how the season is doomed in the first half?
Rudy Giuliani needs to stop this game right now.
Holy shit THAT playcall! LMAO
I miss Ronnie boys :(
"Vegas just changed us underdogs, what the fuck happened?!"
Do I start Dez over Darius Slayton???
I hope to see Lamar pissed and going off with his arm and legs.
I really hope Dez pops off and Boykin can learn how to use his size from him
My take - Rivers cries 5 times.
ITS GAMETIME BITCHES
LET'S GO DEFENSE
LET'S GOOOO D
My fav thing to do on Sunday is this chat. Let's gooo guys
Rivers thinking about his lunch LOL
Jesus christ Campbell down and rubbing his hamstring.
Wtf man not like this
I think he‚Äôs ok.
Not Campbell no
The injuries are starting to get ridiculous
This can't be real.
"Guys he got up on his own and he wasn‚Äôt down for long, I think he‚Äôll be ok"
please be a calf cramp.
"Colts must've really liked something in film, every play is to the outside."
Bruh lol
Wtf was that play call?
Yikes Bozeman got shit on.
Excellent tackle by the oline there.
Lmao that play was broken as soon as the ball was snapped
Bozeman got shit on lol
Holy shit bozeman
Wtf was that play call?
Back at it again with the awful 3rd down playcalling. Gonna be a long game.
It's like Roman has just given up completely. We ran the option pitch the whole 2nd half last week. It's on tape
GET GREG ROMAN THE FUCK OUTTA BALTIMORE MAN
McPhee with a nice stick
Mcphee was such a good pick up
So who we putting at CB once Jimmy inevitably gets hurt and Dorsey being out? Can Dez play CB? Hollywood? Probably has better chance touching the ball as a CB in our offense lol.
Nice no call on the blatant block from the back on Yannick
Zero pressure. 100% clean pocket. No one in the frame!
Bonds is back... tuck that guy sucks
"This is definitely a game we are gonna have to win on offense, they have a really good line, and the secondary is thin"
should have got Desmond King
Jfc that red zone TD% was awful. 31st in the league.
Refs eat da poopoo
Here we go....
Cmon' atleast make it competitive.
We cannot pass the ball vertically this year. You have to be able to line up and pass the ball at will to be great in this league. We are never recreating the BEST rushing team of ALL TIME. Have to evolve.
"How is it possible that we have the most CB depth in football besides the Patriots and yet are almost completely drained on CBs.  No Marlon, Tavon, Marshall, Averett or Bonds.  We only have Peters, Smith and Dorsey left so 2 CBs and a guy pretending to play corner."
The worst thing about this is we know Roman is more inclined to give up on the run
Greg Roman panicking. Probably won‚Äôt see another rush attempt the whole game
Too many injuries man season is long we have time
Shitty playcalls here we come
And we can‚Äôt even snap now. This is a joke
The amount of real fans that have stopped tuning into this chat. The ones that don‚Äôt panic the moment we‚Äôre down a score
Skura bro what the hell was that snap?
Good job skura
Thanks Madden
How was that snap Lamar's fault
We cant even snap the ball
Skura fucked up the snap again
So many bad snaps
See I like when they use hollywood like that. He's quick enough to get to the sideline in time
DEZ IS IN THE FIELD!
"Is Matt Skura okay? What's going out there with his snaps?

**EDIT**: Apparently, his thumb(?) suffered a cut early in the game and that was the issue on that drive. His right hand is now wrapped up."
Skura is losing his mind. THAT snap sucked too.
We‚Äôre gonna have to throw the ball this game man.
"2nd and 12, yeah let's throw it 5 yards behind the sticks. Great gameplan Roman!"
Did the colts just friendly fire on that tackle?
Even though that was a stupid face mask Hill has looked more physical and better as a blocker today.
Cant Levine play in the slot? Rather see him then Bonds
This is going to be a long day
Strap in boys here we go again
Hollywood bitches and moans about targets and then pulls that shit.
Penalize ur souljias
"&#x200B;

So, where is Dez Bryant?  ü§î"
I think it might actually be impossible to have penalties against our opponents
Hey guess who?! Bonds
Another throw to the guy Bonds is ‚Äúcovering‚Äù
CHUCK
Rivers got his eyes on Bonds üòÇ this gonn be a looooooong game
Lmao Rivers
"**WOO-HOO, CHUCK CLARK TO THE HOUSE FOR 6!!!!!**"
THATS A FUMBLE
Our Defense scores more points than offense good ole Ravens football
"God damn, Metcalf could‚Äôve started from Baltimore and caught Chuck."
LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!l
FUMBLEROOSKI!
DEFENSE
Jesus Christ chuck clark is slow as shit lol. That‚Äôs my boy though.
38 does not appear to be an NFL Caliber player
We needed that. Thank goodness
## I ALWAYS TRUSTED THIS TEAM /s
Marlo's spirit is the 12th man!!!
Thats what we needed!!!!!
That‚Äôs a blessing. A true blessing
Fuck yeah!!! Defense is the only thing keeping us relevant this year.
LETS GOO
Fuck yea!! Just what we needes
Defense bailing the abysmal offense out again.
Did Rivers get tackled by the turf?
what even happened with rivers? did he just fall
LOL. Sometimes you need some sort of random play like that to swing the game
Jesus H. Clark
Holy shit chuck Clark
Let‚Äôs f*****n gooooooo
Rivers slipping away on his tears.
Chuck Clark looks different.
He got CHUCKED
We're gonna have to rely on D and Tucker arent we? :flaccofeels:
Old man rivers saw Clark coming and took a seat haha
"God damn I'm happy, but still nervous because depending on the defense to score like this feels unsustainable"
Can this spark our offense to play better too?
"Oh man, that image of Rivers watching the Ravens D score. Priceless."
Jesus christ every time I go out back behind the bar to smoke we score a touchdown
Felipe Rios what is you doing baby?
the way Rivers just randomly fell lmaoooo
That Rivers flop is prime gif material
I don't even care that I started taylor in fantasy I'm just glad we got a fumble td lol
Was that Peters that caused the fumble?
Gotta love ~~Harlan~~ Ian talking about the 'Fruit Punch'
Frank Reich watched the tape of the game vs Washington. Screens are killing us.
Zero run D :(
where‚Äôs our run d
That replay of rivers on the ground trying to grab clark is hilarious üòÇ
Bonds nooooo!!!
Hold the ball Bonds
FUCK that would‚Äôve been amazing
GODDAMNIT BONDS CAN'T YOU DO ANYTHING RIGHT?
Not very 007 of you Bonds
I knew rivers was to pussy to go for it üòÇ
The hell going on in KC?
Damn Bonds could have extended his life on this roster lol
"screens and sweeps are working because Humphrey isnt in. You guys shouldnt be surprised. Add that up w Queen being susceptible to misdirections and u got a stew goin

think of him as a DE containing on the boundary. None of the guys in there are as strong or as physical at the point of attack, not even our LBs tbh"
Not gonna lie I can't wait for the Ravens wired this week with Philip rivers in it
Philip Rivers throws like a vagina.
Shoutout to frank reich for telling rivers to take the delay of game once he saw the colts were 6/9 on the year on 4th down
What the fuck even is our offensive play calling
2.5 yards per play oh yea
"That was a nicely designed play, would have helped of the blocks were better"
This offense is so ass
Jees what happened to this offense
This doesnt feel like our year. Our playcalling is an absolute joke. Im fully on the firing roman train.
MARSHAL YANDA RETIRED. STOP TRYING TO MAKE THE RUN UP THE MIDDLE HAPPEN
I prefer flacco check downs. /s
Bozeman is getting destroyed today.
"Lamar is frustrated, call the game to his fucking strengths"
Roman gotta go
Bozeman just standing around
Bozeman with the 1/10th of a block on the play.
"Again wth is Lamar suppose to do there with Leonard right in front of him, its the garbage playcalling"
This offense looks worse than the 2018 offense when all we did was run the ball. What is Greg Roman calling?
Roman needs to go
"I remember last week we really needed a third down conversion against Steelers inn the red zone.  We ran the same play we just did and failed.  At this point, I'm watching because of defense.  Our offensive drives have no cohesion what so ever, so blah"
"The fact that the offense looks so bad, on so may different levels, while we have the most exciting player in ravens history is incredibly frustrating"
This team isn‚Äôt going anywhere with this offense
If harbs still backs Roman after these series of play calling I.........
I feel like the refs are constantly gaslighting me and I don‚Äôt even know what holding is anymore.
Shoutout Madibuike. That was hustle
Nice stop by Madubuike
I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing another drive where we do absolutely nothing
Did Lamar just throw to a guy who was fucking blocking?
"This situation has Cam Cameron written all over it. The play calling is stale and predictable, so the offense is falling flat on it's face. Harbaugh may have a tough decision in front of him coming up soon. This team's SB window is closing and can't wait for Roman to figure it out."
Trash fucking offense right now smh
a fucking screen for a TE who is about 3 yards behind the LOS
We fired our offensive coordinator in week 14 in 2012 and went on to win it all... just saying
Jackson isn‚Äôt going through his reads at all.
GET THE FUCK OFF THE FIELD MARCUS
Peters is great lmao
tfw Greg abandons the run in a tied game
bitch ass 32
What the hell are these window throw calls now? Greg Roman seriously needs to be fired. I'm staying the petition.
"Stay not-ejected, MP..."
Peters baby wtf are you doing out there
Cheap shot
Marcus Peters seems fun as fuck to chill with
That was a lot worse than I thought it was at first
This o line is infuriating
How many yards you wanna lose Lamar?
"Lamar Jackson is not as fast, elusive, or explosive as last year."
WHY IS THIS PLAYCALLING SUCH ASS
Love how even the ravens defense players come to stand up for Jackson. Shows you how much the team rides for him
To be fair... Who knows how Jackson's head is right now
had fg shot w/ tucker but not anymore
"One step forward, two steps back"
"So people defending this absolutely pathetic show of offensive play, I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts."
Fuck it just chuck up a deep ball
3rd and 35 LOL
3rd & 35! Pog
This is embarrassing
Can we get another bye week?
Just punt on 3rd
RAY RICE TIME
Fire. Greg. Roman.
Zero NFL teams would‚Äôve tried to get the first down on 3rd and 35 right there.
"Biscotti has got to be pissed! Right?!

This can't be acceptable to him..."
What the hell is going on!? Offensive play calls are a joke.
Does Roman need to get fired into the sun? This offense is anemic
"Offense looks horrible right now. Whether its the oline, greg roman, the receivers, or lamar. They gotta straighten this out"
Trading away Hurst and not investing big in OL in the draft has cost us. Greg's playcalling isn't working as a result and Lamar had no chance.
I've started opening this thread on my phone and resting my beer on it. The amount of cold takes in this thread keeps my beer ice cold.
Why dont we ever take a deep shot just to keep the defense on their toes a bit
"Classic Judon, get him the fuck off the field"
Wouldn't be third down without Judon commiting a penalty
Fire Roman after this game this is inexcusable. I‚Äôm getting tired of this team‚Äôs excuses from coaches and players
Just shooting ourselves in the foot non-stop this year.
Dumb hit by McPhee
Greg Roman needs to be fired if they lose this game and they need to immediately start working on rebuilding Lamar's confidence and evaluating where he's at.
"Every 3rd, we get a penaltyü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
Pittman's going to be catching all day because Bonds is on him. Obvious.
O-line help desperately needed
Why do our corners give so much cushion?
"not a single deep pass yet, yet we're playing off them"
The good news is that we're probably going to get a lot of practice at playing from behind
We cant win this game without our offense
The Ravens can never have too much cornerback depth. It‚Äôs really hurting us this year.
No matter what defense scored 7 and kept them in check so far our offense either wins or loses the game
We probably kneel the clock out.
Why take that out
Are we leading the NFL in penalties yet?
We‚Äôve been playing so undisciplined lately and it‚Äôs getting old ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Let's just kneel it out til half I dont think I can watch a Lamar 2 min warning turnover right now.
WHY DO WE KEEP DOING STUPID SHIT?
Wtf are these play calls????????? Jesus christ its like a dying animal just shoot it
"Wow, we are literally giving up."
Penalties has to equal poor coaching right?
One teams playing to win
im actaully scared of jackson's dropbacks now. he goes back AT LEAST 10 yards.
56 yrds lol
This year is a wash
"For all the ""wouldn't have survived the boller days"" this offense looks as bad as those days"
So....we going to fire Roman yet?
Somethings definitely wrong with the psyche of this team. Like is Lamar saying fuck it cuz he knows the plays being called are ass?
Hail Mary pick-6 incoming
Good thing they have those big receivers!!
Aight this is the game where we break the streak of losing games when trailing at halftime. I belee. We couldn't possibly do worse that this first half
"Cant wait for the team to come out and show off the great adjustments they made at halftime lol. Seriously though, the coaching is killng us"
"I love Lamar and I really really hope this is just Roman being dumb. Lamar hasn‚Äôt looked good, but throws well still. Like he just is in the wrong system"
"So when are we gonna see changes?!

We have a lot invested in this year..."
Harbs better have the speech of the century for the guys in the locker room.
we havent had any game w/ good halftime adjustments. not expecting much here
"We sat up here in the off season and saw that this Front Office refused to get any help on offensive side. In fact, the offense got worse with the retirement and then trading of Hurst.

The Front Office did nothing...except draft a raw 3rd round WR.

This season offense production was PREDICTABLE.

So now, the Ravens hope (as it should be) rest ENTIRELY on the defense. They are the ones that got all the limited resources."
At least Lamar has no turnovers. Proud of my boy
"Back to the days of defense playing both ways to win games, would be more than happy to drop Roman this season has shown he ain‚Äôt it"
Seriously concerned how we never run Lamar from under center? I think the PA game would work far better and we could run some bootleg/more misdirection
"If the OLine could give us enough time to throw deep passes, that‚Äôd be cool."
Mekari needs to be replaced. He‚Äôs been horrible
Asses got chewed out in the locker room at halftime
That's a horrendous stat... 20 straight losses when trailing at half? How many years does that go back?
"yo, this offense is what I want"
20 straight losses when losing at halftime lol WTF??? This isn't even a Lamar problem apparently
Well there goes that
You've got to be fucking kidding me
Good feeling gone
Because of course
And there we go
Jesus fuck man how does this keep happening
"Pack it up fellas, we‚Äôre done :("
"NNOOOOOOOOO

I just started to feel good about the offense"
What the fuck Gus eat my ass dude
"Yo I came in from fishing to watch this and saw the very end of the half, 54 total yards... Maybe I should have stayed, eh could get better in the 2nd! Nope, should have fucking stayed out..."
We're still good. Get a stop and we're back like we never left
Hollywood wont get tackled but can make one lol
Not our year. Just laughable.
dude its a curse. something is going on.
I think he secured it and went down to the ground and then lost it.
That's... deflating. Can't put that one on Roman. All execution on that one.
No way they reversing this
Literally can‚Äôt blame Lamar or even Roman. O line is fucked with a capital F
Good play calling on the drive don't sweat yet boys
Bad challenge
What a fucking waste
No way that was a catch. What the fuck is our coaching staff doing? Just grasping at straws
I mean why the fuck not.
Another wasted challenge this week... who is talking to him from the booth?
"Possibly the weirdest challenge in the history of professional football. But alright, who needs 3 timeouts"
"He took multiple steps and had control and wasn't initially going down on the play, this is going to be very interesting. It doesn't pass the smell test to me but seems to check all required boxes?"
 Wait that looks like Ravens ball!!
Someone explain how that isn‚Äôt a catch please. Shit was glued to both hands
"We're running a north south player on a delayed handoff at the goal line...and we wonder why we fumble at the goal line. Just stupid shit all around.

Roman seriously has this team in a point where they have no idea what to be."
ALRIGHT WHO FUCKING JINXED IT
I wanna roll up in the curtain and the carpet and roll the fuck away from this game feeling safe
Color me FUCKING SHOCKED
No way LOL
Lol @ everyone saying it was a dumb challenge
the mad lad actually did it
Everyone thought the challenge was dumb but harbaugh playing 4D chess
Wtf?! I think thats a bad call
See? It was a good challenge! Peters held onto the football long enough for it to count as an interception.
Harbaugh you fucking genius
TIL Idk what a catch is...what year is this
Holy fuck they reversed it?!
I'll eat crow. I'm insanely surprised they gave us that
Dez definitely caught that lol
Lamar has looked really good this half so far
y'all were saying lmao
dez caught it
"That was a~~n unintentional~~ *coincidental* perfect finger point at the camera by Dez Bryant after CBS cut back from the catch/not catch highlight during that Cowboys/Packers playoff game all those years ago. ""You damn well know I caught that pass."""
hopefully leonard is ok
That‚Äôs my soulja boi
Anyone feels like these commentators complain every time we have a favorable call? Literally every time
I want to see a Dez completion
"Good luck to Darius Leonard, that dude is an unbelievable player"
"Hope Leonard is okay because I never want injuries, but he's been destroying us today. It'll definitely make our lives a lot easier."
Bro how is Pizza Hut gonna do my boy Gus like that
My anxiety is too high!
Wow Roman didn't fuck that one up for once
Hell of a drive. Once again though this should be 21-10. These turnovers are killing us.
HE'S IN
We should get both of those fucking TDs
We just made what should've been back to back TD drives. Nice halftime adjustments
Yeah good luck dropping Gus three times in a row
"There you go Gus, you got your revenge right away"
That down judge is fucking blind
Gus Redeemed himself
knee didn't touch
LETS GO BOYS OFFENSE IS OILED UP NOW
"Once again, the ref announces a lineman as eligible for us, but I remember back against the Chiefs when they scored with a lineman, they didn't announce it like that. Am I wrong on that? Or do they not have to announce it over the speakers just to the defensive captain or something?"
The offense is looking so fluid in this 2nd half
I love how hype we are compared to halftime. LETS KEEP THIS THREAD HYPE! KEEP THE MOMENTUM! KEEP THE TRUSS!
"Steve to Roman on the phone during halftime: ""Get your shit together, or you can stay put at indy after the game"""
I'm happy but how did he escape lol
"Good job defense, now let‚Äôs increase the lead"
Haven't got to Rivers once today.  Is Indys line really that good?  Or Campbell being out really standing out?
Now all my fantasy team needs is an andrews td and the defence to get more turnovers then maybe I have a chance lol
"I know it didn't amount to much, but that Proche Stiff arm was nice"
"Holy shit, Boykin made a catch. This really is 2020"
Boykin sighting!
Nick Boyle is clutch today
Looks so much better in the 2nd half
Here‚Äôs the offense that I have missed so much!
"Can someone confirm that Roman is not calling the plays since the half?

This offense looks totally different"
O-Line actually looking better
All of that for 1 yard
this OL looks so much better now
Go for it
Go for it
Go for it
Go for it or nah? I say go
Horrible spot.
[deleted]
"IT WASN'T A QB DRAW.

THATS A WIN TO ME!"
I hope we get this. If we don't that could be a momentum changer
Noice
Skura is so trash today at snapping
That was huge
Something's up with Matt Skura other than his cut up hand he has looked off for a few games now
Did we rly hold them to 1 yard all quarter lol
Anyone else think it‚Äôs weird the NFL started this game at the second half
Skura is missing a whole off-season coming off an MCL/ACL tear but still really concerned. we need good OL
Love we still trust Gus after the caugh up.
Just let Lamar be Lamar...needs to be the game plan moving forward
Jackson.... Looks GOOD for once this season???? He seems confident again and doesn't seem like he's trying to do too much or make every play. We look more dominant than 2019 in this last quarter Probably the best Football we've played against a good team all year.
SKURA man
Damn 12 straight completions
Ricard lead blocking Dobbins is a thing of beauty I want to see for multiple seasons to come.
>The Ravens are now 6-for-9 on fourth-down conversions this year. - @bsmolka
19/23 Lamar is actually doing good imo
this 2nd half has been amazing besides the fumble so far
madden spin op
Damn that faked me
There‚Äôs my QB!!
Beautiful
He's back baby.
Andrews just murdered some poor SOB
NOW I WANNA SEE STEPHEN A SMITH TALK ABOUT HOW LAMAR LACKS PASSING SKILLS AGAINST GOOD DEFENSES!!!!
The offense is back lesssss gooooooo
Completely fooled them :)
Now THAT‚ÄôS MVP LAMAR
Gonna need a gif of Lamar's dance after the TD.
"This is the right playcalling, u/GregRoman! Great playcalling all second half...!"
Okay that was actually a good play call..
If it‚Äôs true. Fire Greg Roman and Promote Urban! Now!
"Someone else must be making the calls now. This isnt romans plays. If anything was adjusted at half, it was that. Im more than certain."
WHAT A FAKE
Oh what‚Äôs that? The Colts overcommitted on a run play because we‚Äôve actually been running it?  Who would‚Äôve thought!!
They need to do something about this line. Skura and Bozeman fell straight backwards on that play wtf
Rivers looking like hes in his feelings rn üòÇ
"Fantastic play calling adjustment by Roman at the half, absolutely brilliant stuff. Offense looks more confident"
Is this our seasons turnaround??
OL is literally falling over themselves as Lamar escorts himself to the endzone.
Convinced that someone else is calling plays.
Download complete
Can‚Äôt commend our guys enough for turning it around on offence and for Roman to adjusting. Hope they can close it out.
Record consecutive 20+ points. Wooooot.
"Our offense SUCKS !!!!
Fire Greg Roman !!!!





Oh wait,  we aren't doing that anymore?"
Darius Leonard is a beast. Wish he were wearing purple
Mark Andrews going to be on GMFB for that block
"I have this theory (untested) that when the Baltimore Ravens offensive unit calls running plays consistently (and does not abandon the run), that Lamar Jackson is able to achieve peak performance."
"Defense needs to hold now, can‚Äôt get soft."
"Props to Roman. When he does bad, we shit on him. He has turned it around this half so give credit where it's due. Oline has been a lot better second half as well."
"Oh no, not Queen please."
We can‚Äôt keep losing people fuck
NOOOOOOOO
"Once Lamar gets going and confident, the whole team seems to pick up that same energy. I just wish it didn't take this long for them to get going"
Concussion looks like
not queen cmon
I think its a concussion and not a body injury but im not a doctor
Took it on the chin...hopefully not a concussion
Is the Madden curse still a thing?! Ravens can't catch break with injuries this year it seems like.
He's just shaken up a bit. Lets chill guys
That super bowl ring hat is awesome
"i think i was right, wind knocked out him"
Keep running the clock for us
#JUDON!!!!
Big time stop!!!
#BITCH ASS COLTS GET THE FUCK OFF THE FIELD
Judon musta shat out that $17 mil of Taco Bell he ate finally.
LETS GO JUDON
The Colts D isn't the only one that came to play today.
A team has Philip Rivers at quarterback in 2020 and expected to actually be good offensively...don‚Äôt know who thought that would happen
JUDON!
JUDON MADE A PLAY BOIS
Judon finally has an impact this year
Fuck you Rivers
A couple first downs here and that's the game
Omg.. I held my breath that last play.  Please... no more injuries.
Offense turned it up this half and defense kept their shot together despite Calais and Marlon out and a bunch of players out of practice for COVID. Fuck yes fuck yes
Give Dez a carry!
Being conservative
"""The Ravens are absolutely vibing bro""

- The announcers"
Almost got blocked
This game feels like a football movie came out super flat the first half team got a inspirational talk got back out their in the second half and is handling business!!
"Man, we are absolutely crushing the Indy returners this game"
Steelers V Cowboys are rivals since when?
Merkari is below average at best but when he has a bad game holy fuck it‚Äôs bad
Hopefully 44 will be back next week
EDC is on the phone with Deion Sanders right now
Pray for the Red Rifle to come through.
Tight coverage from Bonds
Rivers trying to pull a Brady
rivers: what the gosh darn heck? son of a gun
Last gasp literally? Like Indy is gonna die?
Go Cowboys!
JTuck is magical
Man adjustments aside the Oline is still an issue. Too many hits behind the line.
Tuck is everything
"This team played great today despite all the struggles we came from behind and will most likely come away with the win.  Lamar looked damn good other then one pass where it should‚Äôve been picked.  The pass catchers got open a decent amount, and the defense played incredible despite the practice situation and missing so many pieces."
Shades of Truzz there on the sidelines.
Tuck making the tackle! Ok big boi!
If we fix our line this team wins the superbowl. Between injuries and the OL I'm scared af
Lol Tuck getting his nose a lil dirty
J TUCK WITH THE TACKLE
Tuck chill bra we need your leg not your tackles
lol damn Tucker can tackle too. he had to get his ass
Defense for player of the game first half lamar for second half
Nice to see an offensive comeback in the second half
Wtf was that???
We gotta keep them out of the end zone.  Because onside kicks make me nervous af.
Rivers wasn't moving in front of Marino today.  Not a chance in hell
Dub
U complain not getting the ball and u can't catch shit
Who would've thought that losing a generational guard and a top tackle would make the offensive line into a sieve.
Lmaoo y‚Äôall are all fake as FUCK lol the offensive line is playing like shit. Lamar has been pretty accurate had the one bad triple coverage decision to Hollywood but Jesus y‚Äôall are disappointing
"Lamar Jackson was BEGGING all off season for the Front Office to go get Antonio Brown. Instead, the Front Office and much of the Ravens fanbase laughed claiming we do need Brown.

PREDICTBLY, we now have one of the worst passing offenses because we have one of the worst weapons on offense.

Seasons are often won and lost in the OFF SEASON...when you have the most opportunity to improve your team."
wtf was that? Better play calling PLEASE
Play calling is going to be our weakness all season long SMH
Come in soulja
I think we all forget what it feels like to have every game be competitive after last year. We‚Äôre all so used to destroying every team in our way. This is football though and we have to accept its not 2019 anymore.
Ugh yeah we‚Äôre done this year. Prolly 10-6 and get bounced in the wildcard
Defense giving up 10 yards per play is no bueno
Love that TD but holy crap they‚Äôre moving the ball on us like it‚Äôs nothing.
I miss Campbell
"Wait, so they didn‚Äôt call timeout, but they also didn‚Äôt call a delay? What?"
Tf is this playcalling
Y'all bitched all week about abandoning the run because Roman called a single pass to start the half now and are upset because we run too much...
Fun Fact: Rivers is 0-13 or some shit against Brady üòÇ
"Even if we win this game...

We are not super bowl caliber"
We have 55 yards of offense and are only down by 3. We should be getting blown out. Lets see what adjustments they'll make.
Didnt we upgrade or offense from last year or is a 3rd TE really that important
"it‚Äôs funny to me that people try to find a way to blame Lamar when the play calling is atrocious, our OL can‚Äôt stop a 4 man rush, and our ‚ÄúWR1‚Äù drops passes"
This same exact thing happened to the 49ers in 2015 with Greg Roman. He has to go immediately
Wait I thought Lamar was bad according to this sub?
"""I have remembered how to play football.""

- Ravens Offense (Second Half, 11/8/2020)"
LOL the Colts sub is crying about the refs.....lmfao
Lots of ravens fans eating...crow
Lamar had a pocket there. He ran into the sack. Showing no poise lately
I hope this is just cramps
Down 7-0 in the 1st means we won‚Äôt run at all today. Get ready for an ugly one boys
Ugh Brown gotta get that one Soulja
Brown isn't as good as he thinks he is and Lamar isn't as good as we need him to be right now.
"Besides the equalizing turnover, The Ravens 'defense is looking toothless"
"We look so goddamn bad on defense thus far.

4 starters down and it's painfully obvious."
TO BE FAIR TO BONDS: theres a reason hes on defense
>It's been a frustrating ~~day~~ year for the Ravens and Lamar Jackson
"Serious question:  Does anyone else think Lamar has been playing hurt this season? A couple weeks ago he was on the injury report with a knee injury. 

Feel like there's something just a bit off, that's affected his overall game. Last season, his escapabilty & cuts were so sharp. Defenders are locked onto him right now."
lmao so much hate for Judon and then it wasn‚Äôt even his fault
Lol at yall calling judon stupid and it wasnt even him....
Fucking Elliot played that so bad he almost took out Jimmy Smith lol
We look lost. What happened to the swagger we had. We just look so flat
That's the same hit that the Steeler's didn't get flagged for last game
Every game we've played has been getting worse and worse and worse. Team is on a hard decline and nowhere near SB contenders
Do we stink?
"Our offense is complete trash and when things work Roman just abandons it , like this is insanely bad"
Ravens defense is carrying so hard.  Watch us win it but our offense doesn‚Äôt score a point.
"56 yards of offense 0 on the ground. This team was up 20 at half last season every game, im sick"
20 points streak ends today.
"Why did we get to the redzone and immediately stop passing? Lamar finally gets some rhythm and we just yank it away. It's okay to pass a lot if it's working, it's 2020."
#dezcaughtit
Fuck man why are so many big name players getting hurt.
figure it out Skura
#Tucker KPW: 99 KAC: 99 BALLS: 100
yeah everyone lets roast the UDFA corner for being bad when he really shouldn‚Äôt even be playing but forget about marlo deciding to splurge his contract money outside every week
"Way to bobble a crucial third down, ""soulja."""
This team would be insanely good if we had an NFL offense. Damn shame
Fire Roman after this game I‚Äôm begging you. These players look like they have checked out because they know he‚Äôs ass
Can‚Äôt believe how Lamar breathed on Edwards there . Smh look at the regression.
"If it were 2019, RG3 would be going in."
Dont ask me how I know but Dez is gonna catch a 35ish yard catch and run TD where he breaks 2 tackles
THROW THAT üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è UP!!!!
White on Purple is so fire
"Alright boys, I placed a whole four dollars on us at +100. Let‚Äôs get it."
I am about to throw up
TIME TO GO BOYS
Let‚Äôs do this shit!! I want a huge game from the passing attack
Rivers ya friggin crybaby
Do you guys think Judon will grt his boneheaded penalty before or after the half?
You have to be fucking kidding me
Welp
Fuck this season so hard right now man.
Oh sweet Jesus.
I'm about to panic
The season that just keeps on giving
"Fuck injuries, it makes games so hard to enjoy"
I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre wearing the purple pants. White on black is my least favorite combination and we wear it basically every game on the road
"Burger, 40's the Mike!"
Don't want to jinx it but it doesnt look crazy bad or anything.
I'm sick of these guys jumping. It works 1/10 times and almost injured you all of the rest of the times.
What the living fuck was that
What in the fuck kind of play was that? Pathetic.
What the hell?..
Roman wtf is this
Wtf was that..
Bozeman got beat like a drum
31 looked injured after the play he was holding his hand
Great job utilizing our WRs
#Let Lamar throw it bruh
Well Dorsey lasted a whole 10 seconds
Campbell questionable to return
"i wish mcphee got the money judon did, hes playing better"
Reich too smart for Wink.  He's going to throw screens all over the place.
Block in the back
Who the fuck is Tyrell bonds
"Man, I hope I‚Äôm wrong, but with all the outstanding stuff going on (no practice time for a half the defense and injuries) I don‚Äôt know if we can keep up right now. Still early, hope I‚Äôm wrong"
We got someone named Terrell Bonds out there covering receivers
Offense better show up today
Patrick Queen FF let's go
This might be an ass whooping
"So they attack the edges all the way down the field then run the decoy and come the other way. Nice gameplanning.  

That's the thing that I don't like about Roman - it's not necessarily the plays themselves (tho need work) it's the sequencing and setup of the other team when we are on offense."
Not a good 2nd drive for the D... Let's see if they can adjust.
Playing from behind already man wtf
This may come as a complete shocker for a lot of people in here. It‚Äôs just the 1st quarter.
"And this start shows you can‚Äôt just look at a teams record and make conclusions. I know we have a lot going against us this week, but we were bullied that drive and looked half asleep. Not acceptable."
"Greg Roman about to send the offense out to: run up the middle on first down for a gain of 2 , lamar RPO on second down for a gain of 3., incomplete pass to a doubled mark Andrew‚Äôs  on 3rd down."
We waste a down **every** single drive.
Lol this offense is a joke
We literally can‚Äôt even snap the ball
Cursed
Great start offense üëç
That snap perfectly describes the offense recently...
Great awareness by Boyle to snatch the ball of the ground
"Huh, who knew throwing to Dobbins was a good idea?

Wait...."
Skura‚Äôs snaps have been shaky all year. It finally bit him
Skura is playing like shit rn wtf
What in the fuck is Skura doing?
I wanna go back to the 19‚Äô Ravens üòû
Fire Roman man the madden cpu calls better plays
What‚Äôs wrong skura
Da fuq is with these snaps
Wtf is with Skura?
Mekari start warming up
Look at that run. Everyone is crashing down on the LOS. Zero respect for our passing.
Probably thinking about the next hit. Drops it. Sick.
Hit both hands
Nice fucking coverage on that kick
Rashad Melvin sends his regards
Looking a lot like those late Flacco years
Who is our WR coach? Whoever he is get him the fuck outta here man
Get bonds out of here
Bonds fucking sucks
Man. Watching redzone. Mahomes has 15 feet of room in every direction around him on every drop back AND receivers that get separation. Me jelly
Thank you GOD. MP JUICEMAN!!!!!
#THERE WE FUCKING GO
Omg lol
EAT SHIT IRSAY
#Chuck Clark TD!!!!!
"To everyone saying its a wrap, no it‚Äôs not. But yes we are playing like shit."
I feel for Bonds. He‚Äôs going to get picked on all game.
Bonds is not an NFL player.
LMAOOOO HE LEAPED OVER RIVERS
Rivers gameplan: Find Bonds and exploit the hell out of him. Dont even look at Peters or Smith
Rivers flopping in front of Clark as a 'tackle'.  lol.
CHUCK CLARK I LOVE YOU
Lmaoooooo Rivers wtf was that
Chuck Clark just posterized that Colts player.
OH LORT!
Lmfaooo rivers
I‚Äôm so glad the refs let the play run out. I wasn‚Äôt sure it was a fumble at first
Marlon is here in spirit
What the hell just happened
LETS FUCKING GO
YOOOO
lol grabbing whatever he could get
Damn Ravens D is RUTHLESS
"LMAO

Thanks, Colts!"
Yeeessss leggo baybeeeeeee
LMFAOOOO
don't we need one more 20 point game to break the record?
we needed that so bad good shit
Who stripped it/ punched it out?
So proud of this defense dammit
"Does anyone want to argue that Lamar doesn't need better WRs again? Brown asks for more balls then drops the 3rd down pass. Brown is a great No. 2 WR, he is not a No. 1 WR in ANY good passing offense. 

Given the way this team is constructed and how much resources is devoted to defense -- the Ravens better score on defense for this team to have an shot in the playoffs."
This Dell add making me feel nauseous AF
2 big plays in a row on jaylon ferguson
Sack daddy isn‚Äôt even a tackle daddy
Aight we gotta meme the fuck out rivers üòÇüòÇ
Do the colts know how to throw anything else other than screens?
Bonds had a chance
Fucking Bonds lmao
fucking bonds i stg
Defense stepping up big time
That's a pick if it was Humphrey
BOnds that should‚Äôve been a TD
Buffalo beating the brakes off Executive Chef Russ and his merry band of line cooks.
How do we not even ATTEMPT to throw a deep ball to Hollywood. Even if we were obligated to tell the Colts D before doing so we still fucking should!!
i cant remember the last time we completed any pass down like 15 yards
I have an unnatural amount of hatred for the fact that those WR sweeps are passing TDs
More designed runs please.
I‚Äôm liking the quick plays at least
Why cant we pull off the plays that other teams can?
Offense looks like doo doo
Why is Lamar‚Äôs drop back so deep????
Horrible call
Welps... Time for our D to get us another td
Might as well punt on 3rd and short with these play calls
Fuck Greg Roman. What are these play calls?
Player of the game is gonna be Sam Koch ain't it :(
Our offence looks so shit
Greg Roman - Why?
QB draw. How fucking predictable.
Fuck Greg Roman
This is pathetic we literally can‚Äôt throw anything other than screens
Our offense has suck but holy fuck today we haven‚Äôt even moved to their territory yet
Our O Line is sad...
Only positive I‚Äôve seen is more misdirection by the offense. Too bad the line is absolute dog shit and can‚Äôt execute.
"Pass the fucking ball on a slant. Literally every team. Even the Jets know to do that. 

Greg Roman: QB Draw???"
"Am I the only one who feels like we're having Lamar do way more inside runs this year?

If you want to use that athleticism then go for it, but on designed runs you have to scheme him as an elusive RB. Stretch plays, off tackle, get him more space to make people miss and make a play instead of sending him down inside the trenches"
"Ya'l are so weird lol. All year you have been complaining  that we aren't running more screens, end-arounds, fakes, etc. The line actually has to block in order to be successful at any of these. the OL getting mauled right now."
So are we finally done with Greg Roman or is harbaugh too attached to him
"Our offense is legitimately terrible. You can't keep calling QB dives up the middle when it's 3 and 4 yards to gain.

If you can't scheme something easy -- a rub, a slant, a drag, an in-break, a curl with a known speedster like Hollywood after sending him go a bunch of times -- then what the fuck are we doing here."
There are two options: Lamar is absolute ass in passing and last year was a complete mirage OR GRo needs to be fired yesterday. I‚Äôm going with 2.
I hope we get some new age college coach to replace Roman
offensive line play is killing us
How do the fucking browns absolutely dismantle this colts team and we can‚Äôt even get it past our own 50... holy fuck this is turning into a Flacco Offense so quickly
So is this our thing now? Empty backfield on 3rd and 4? We run Lamar every time there is an empty backfield? This is us now? This is the way it is? I played baseball for 17 years and I play Madden on my Xbox. If I am able to call that play every single time I see it that's a problem. Shitty Ass play calls are making me look like Tony Romo from my fuckin couch
Real nice tackle there
I had no clue we were on SNF next week
Promote James Urban to OC. He seems like he has an idea of a 2020 offense
Is there any way to get Yanda to start packing pounds on again and come back
Defense still looking good as fuck
Please offence - show something! Just something.
Lets go deep!!
"To the eye test, the offense has had more and more trouble moving the ball with each week."
What in the name of fuck am I watching here
"This is like, ya know, embarrassing"
Our first round pick needs to be spent on Oline next year. Not even close.
"Fucking come on. 

Lamar isn't showing spunk because greg roman is an idiot"
this offense is dogshit
HEY THAT COLTS LINEMEN JUST TOUCHED AN OFFICIAL!
Lamar is awful at making decisions. I'm sorry. But you can not throw that ball. There is no excuse.
"LaMar got lucky on that one, that was an INt"
Remember last season when Lamar throw the ball and you just knew it would be money? Now I feel sick every time I see it come out of his hands.
I'm not sure there's a single positive thing about this offense lol
Yo he ain't open Lamar
Yet another atrocious pass
How is every reciever we throw to literally in triple coverage üò≠
"Oh look, Peters running his mouth. Dude, you can not fucking get ejected."
Rivers has such a stupid whiny face
Burn the offense down and start over
"hahahaha Lamar getting Mekari I love
Lamar"
God this thread has some insufferable homers in it.
I like Mekari there
wow a questionable referee decision goes our way
Ah that‚Äôs a good call actually. Dipped the head
Bro he‚Äôd be tossed in college
FUCK BLACMON
Get angry! Show some fucking fire. Show some energy they you want to win.
Juiceman ready to go.
"Lamar looks baaaaad, it‚Äôs like he can‚Äôt read defenses at all when he drops back"
Cowboys take notes on how to defend your QB
This line is not blocking anyone
thats an ejection
Dirty af
Is it me or does the play calling look horrid?
Surely he should be kicked.
This is the first late hit we‚Äôve ever had? In what 2 years ?
JUICEMAN DONT LIKE YALL FUCKING WITH OUR QB (whispers: but don‚Äôt get ejected Marcus goddamnit)
Take notes cowboys players. That‚Äôs how you defend your QB
Lamar has to win throwing today we cant get anything going on the ground
colt fans booing like dumbass babies
Bruh
Throw the fucking ball away
"Needs to get rid of that ball, also we literally have 0 protection"
We have no line at all
Seems like every pass play Lamar is so far back from the line. OL needs help big time.
That's hard to watch
Jackson  what the hell
"Wtf, pushed is way out of FG range"
Line is rough today
STEP UP IN THE FUCKING POCKET LAMAR
Offensive line is just awful
had hollywood wide open if plants fast and takes a hit.
This offense looks so bad on so many levels it‚Äôs sad
This is hard to watch
Our offensive line is in tatters
Lamar stop the hero ball plz
we need stanley
I seriously want to see more of Duvernay
yeah we need to draft a line
Just take a knee.
We make one good play and then follow with 3-4 bad ones.
I sure would love an interception right there. üëÄüëÄüëÄ
Imagine being an NFL lineman and not lining up properly
Flustered Lamar usually doesn‚Äôt bode well for his decision making. He needs to get back to the fundamentals
It‚Äôs time for Roman to yeet
"Why can‚Äôt we throw downfield dammit WTF 

At least take a chance...."
Lamar basically sacks himself when he starts running the wrong way to avoid a defender
Here come the trolls
"let's take a deep breath folks, it's going to be a long season, i know it's rough but we are the fucking ravens, we aren't incompetent"
No magic pill for this offense. Can only expect marginal improvements at this point in the year. Hopefully defense can get and stay healthy to carry the team.
Jackson is in his own head. He needs a sports shrink.
"I know some of y'all don't want to believe, but it just gets worse with Roman."
There's the Judon that we know.
Thanks Judon
What a fucking bullshit call
45 penalty yards already
More bullshit calls. That was not roughing the passer. The fuckkk
"No wayyyy, Judon is straight up trash"
I mean it looks bad but he clearly wasnt hesd hunting.
I'm manifesting a turnover on this drive
Undisciplined penalties are this team's own worst enemy.
man i miss yanda
"Is yannick a situational player? I was under the impression he plays every down, even though he isnt the best agaknst the run."
How are we so bad at both preventing and getting separation?
Colts about to go 95 yards on us
Jimmy smith giving up 15yds of cushion
I hate that I have to think about the state of Indiana for this long.
Surprised refs didn‚Äôt throw flag for DPI. Been fuckin us all season for playing good D.
Great coverage on that play
commentators talking about fucking luggage right now instead of our pass coverage
Doyle's beared looks likes it's glued on
The talent drop up front has really hurt our offense.  Hopefully the team develops our depth quickly
"This half could‚Äôve been way worse. Hope they make adjustments at half time. Half to credit our defence for hanging in there despite not having Humphrey and Campbell, they‚Äôre playing as well as you can really ask for. As for the offence, they‚Äôre playing against a strong group but you have to ask for more than what they put up in the first half - you can tell they‚Äôre adjusting to life without Stanley (and Yanda) and still missing Ingram but man, this is a tough watch. They‚Äôre playing scared, timid, I hate the Roman play calling."
Blankenship kicks with his glasses on
Can Harbaugh tell the bois it‚Äôs ok to not commit penalties
So many flags what‚Äôs wrong with this team
Check downs are our new thing apparently
6 plays for negative yards
Returning kicks from the endzone would be a lot cooler if we didn't commit a penalty every time
Oh NOW you run the ball
"Look I know this team is undisciplined, but the amount of times we get called for holding while the other teams never do is kind of suspect."
JK gotta get out of bounds there. Free Colts timeout
this game is nauseating
Another botched snapüòë
Hahahaha my god
"It's like we're not able to do anything positive. It's either a negative play, or we struggle to do some pedestrian shit that any other team can do with no issue"
"Wtf Roman. If you‚Äôre going to run on 2nd down when the opponent has 2 timeouts, you also run on 1st down"
Thank you JK Dobbins for running out of bounds on 1st.
Hard to watch. This is Kyle Boller Era bad
Can we also stop calling these horrible 5 wide passing plays with a weak O line with crappy route concepts. I‚Äôm so tired of Lamar dancing for a few seconds then getting dragged down
Jesus this is just sad. We can't do anything offensively.
This offensive line is bottom 5
Lamar should've gone left there but man. Guy has no room and noone getting open.
WTF WTF WTF WTF
This is almost as bad as last year was good
What is this offense? How has it declined this badly?
Lamar needs to take fucking charge of his team.
WOAH You can throw a route to a WR turning in close to the line of scrimmage? Like what type of direction is that? Sort of like a ... Slant or something?
oh nice refs got us a flag so helpful
Consecutive 20 pt game record is in danger lol
I was saying we were good all throughout these last couple of weeks but this is sad. Heads need to roll after we lose this and it's gotta be Roman. He's holding us back now.
Let me tell you why the offensive line playing poorly is obviously Lamar's fault...
Just NFC East things
Does our defense have more yards than our offense right now?
Like we cant even get to tucker's range
I want some Dez today
WOAH WAHT IS DIS
"Snead is a glue guy.  He aint flashy, but I cant say I wouldnt want a guy like him always on my offense."
Slants and Seams. As far as the eye can see. Keep digging
Did we fire Roman at halftime
LET LAMAR COOK!
Why are they showing 2019 highlights?
We should hire roman
Leonard is a freak
"Not the same offense, but I like this uptempo pressure offense."
Whatever they did in the locker room . . . they should remember that.
"I think someone snapped Roman's neck in the locker room and took over his job, where tf was this all day. Quick passes that dont take 10 minutes to develop? Slant routes? Mixing up the play calls? 

I don't get why Roman can't do this all the time"
LMAO OMFG
Anyone else notice Lamar has a limp when he shows up had it all year. Think its his groin
Jesus Fucking Christ
 Shoot me
COME ON
.............. smfh.
That's just damn good defense there.
Ball. Security.  Is. Key.
I wanna die
DogHouse time!
Fucking judon and roman!
"Only Lamar was on the madden cover, not the entire team"
"I love turning the ball over in the redzone, my favorite"
Peters was so close
Thats about what I expected from this team
Fuck that would have been amazing if he caught it
wow ok
why would anything nice ever happen?
Nothing going our way
How is that not PI the receiver held Peters arm on the catch
What a horrible challenge
We are fucking cursed. Shoulda been a pick
How to waste an important timeout when we might need them later 101
"Now protecting the pall seems to be a issue, Add that to the laundry list of problems we gotta fix \*sigh\*"
"Imagine being Greg Roman and using Duvernay on a god damn running play from 4 yards away. This moron needs to go I'm tired of watching week after week as he ""outsmarts"" himself trying to be cute. Dude cares about nothing more than ""making his mark"" and getting a shot at a head coaching job. Fuck off Greg."
"Don't like this challenge, don't see any way this gets overturned."
The challenge won‚Äôt even be in question when we return from commercial break.
Marcus Peters is a star
We moving like the cowboys now
I don't think this is going to be reversed
Ooph I don‚Äôt think I like this challenge. We may need the TO later...
it is kinda close
not our year fellas
"As infuriating as that was to end it, that drive has me genuinely excited. This team has a lot of deficiencies on offense, but one thing they don't lack: speed. I've been preaching to mix up tempos, speed up, slow down, use rhythm and pacing to keep the defense off balance and put that speed in position to kill. Here's hoping a fluke fumble doesn't make us abandon what was working."
Wow. I actually disagree with the refs lmfao
Holy fucking shit lmao
LMAO THE CHALLENGE WORKED? WTF
Hey something went our way!
Told you fucking sour pusses.
apparently i know nothing about football
Harbs you sexy smart mf
Who thinks it's a stupid challenge now?
WHAT THE FUCK IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW
I called it! Checked the boxes.
"Lmao, I'd be happy if I didn't expect Greg to turn around and botch this drive up too .."
JUICEMAN!
FUCK YESSSSSS
man i love mp juiceman
Not going to lie if it was flipped I‚Äôd be losing shit rn but I‚Äôll take it
I didn't see that coming
Pulled an uno reverse card on turnovers I see
Colts just got robbed lol I‚Äôll take it
"All of y'all shouting ""BAD CHALLENGE"" can take it back now"
Give the man who decided to challenge this a RAISE!!!!
People who posted DUMB CHALLENGE deleting their comments and acting like they knew it all along lol
Look at that. He had time and threads the needle in between 3 defenders.
LET THE MAN THROW FUCK YALL
HARBAUGH 200% IQ
Marcus Peters caught it
SOULJA BOY
"I‚Äôm confident that shouldn‚Äôt have been a catch but I won‚Äôt complain, MP Juice Man does it again"
I think Hollywood is actually 90 lbs.
That's my soulja
Let Lamar play his game and we'll succeed
Lmfao everyone calling for Harbs to get fired but he big brains the mfing system
Fucking hell this second half **is** getting me hyped
I'll sit on the coach then lmao. Harbs a SB winning coach for a reason
Damn hope Darius Leonard is good
MOMENTUM
"Alright, let‚Äôs make something happen!"
Oh look we throw the ball and we actually get in the red zone? Jeez who figured? Did someone tell Roman?
We are actually getting yards holy shit
C'mon just punch it in
Wow no QB draw
HONK HONK
Ricard just destroyed that mf
Something we have done consistently is get the ball right back to someone that has fumbled and I really appreciate that as a coaching mentality.
Nobody denies Gus Edwards for three straight downs!! Nobody!!
Now let‚Äôs step up the D
THATS MY BOY GUS
Bullshit that's a TD
nearly the same play again lol
future 2 bright w Gus n JK as our backs
"I can‚Äôt watch this game cause of local market restrictions, but that peters interception my god we got lucky."
"Damn, wanted Dobbins to get one there

Gus Bus chugging along though which is still great"
"Alright defense, let‚Äôs get another stop!"
RUN IT DOWN THEIR THROATS
Can't stop the BUS!
Gus. Bus.
FUCK YEESSSSS
Lamar slinging it
I like this new offense
Great change of pace! We have some actual hot routes and check down options and are hitting the middle of the field well. Also running misdirection before the snap very effectively
That was a great drive but still plenty of time to screw ourselves
Look at these quick reads mixed with runs and deep passes. Wow Roman can call a balanced game he just chooses not to
"""Don't you want to call a play that gains more than half a yard?"" ""Nah, we have 4 downs for 2 yards. Run it again."""
There we go Lamar! Looking happier
Is roman not calling plays? Someone else with a playsheet on sideline looked to be calling shit. Roman always is in the booth
"Interesting the second we start actually doing passes downfield, we start moving the ball"
Who tf was right next to Rivers and let him go???
lmao rivers looking slippery asf
If the Defense threw down a receiver there‚Äôs be a flag.
The amount of time that ball was in the air felt like it was a guaranteed pick. If we still had Ed...
"We have a SB defense, too stacked"
Watching him trundle along the field really made me wonder how he got away from that.
Momentum swing??
Nick Boyle upgraded to WR1
I‚Äôm just so frustrated that the second they call pass plays getting vertical everything clicks. Do that all the time!
Crazy what happens when Lamar has a few seconds to throw. Glad the o-line got their heads right
"Nice to see Lamar looking sharp, need this all the time"
i have calmed down a bit
It‚Äôs like we were playing at half speed on offense in the first half and hit the accelerator
I missed what happened after the TD. Three and out?
have we gotten it together
"I knew Carolina wasnt going to hold their lead. But, man I was hoping they'd beat them"
We drank the secret stuff during half cause we‚Äôve definitely picked it up offensively
colts getting decimated on defense by injury
Sneed wide open wtf
Go for it
GO FOR IT RN
Go for it
Snead was open the whole time tou even looked at him Lamar
Fuck yea!!! 1st down bitches
LBs stayed home on Lamar on that 4th.
"Lamar needs to pick what the defense gives him, there were two open players for just a couple of yards, but enough for the 1st down"
Should we try out Dez or nah?
FUCK YEA DOBBINS
JK is good man
"great Lamar, getting that 1st down"
Damn what happened in the locker room?  It‚Äôs like a different offense
Bruh what if we took a shot down field to Bryant on first down
1 yard lmaooo
Lol that Rivers face is a meme waiting to happen
YO Rivers is HOF of facial expressions lol
169... Nice
Dobbins holding on so tight to that ball
Is this the same ravens team as the first half ?
Literally night and day between the first half and the second half
I love dobbins
This is a very different Ravens team offensively. We are back to doing what we do best. Control the clock.
Willie Snead is so good recently. I'm so sorry for slandering him earlier.
Haters happy as Lamar is finally playing WR today
Bruh Dobbins and Queen holy fuck EDC knew he was doing in the draft
Offense looking a million times better right now
"WE BACK, BABY!!!!! WE'RE FUCKIN BACK"
"I do that shit in Madden all the time, lmao."
Lmao Lamar
Beautiful
Powers needs to start seeing some time. Bozeman gets his ass whooped a lot. lol
This second half has been Lamazing!
Bozeman getting punked by MLB is not ideal
Oooooooooh BABEY!!!!!
Where was this in the first half? Glad they turned it around but the ups and downs are scary.
LETS GO BABY
love you lamar
My man Lamar! What a stud!
Nice play. Nice.  Play.
"I‚Äôm not being this guy, but the entire IOL ended up in the ground on that play. Designed?"
Every play I just see the corpse of Matt Skura ragdolling into the backfield. Not cool
And we got the points record
I think Lamar is over that groin injury now his speed looks next level this game
I‚Äôd be pissed as a colts fan but we‚Äôve had plenty of shit calls this year so whatever
fuck yeah this offense is rolling this half! running it all over. Throwing intermediate. Lamar doing it on the ground!
20 points. record broken.
Lamar Jackson has put his foot down in the second half.
If you left the game day thread in the first half we don‚Äôt need that energy #truzzzzzz
Lamar Thanos Purple Jacksonnnnn
Angory bird team is back
NGl I labeled this a loss at half. I love when this team proves me wrong
"We give Roman a lot of shit, but that a masterful play call. Everyone on that defense got absolutely fooled."
Bad call but whatever
"Did he call Lamar, mr Odom??!"
Nice one secondary!! /s
Getting tired of the arm tackles
nooooooooo queen
Peters tries to get the strip so much he gives up RAC a lot
NO NO NO NO NO
Def concussed
Not like this... Not like this
I think he bit his tongue. He kept sticking it out while he was on the ground
Did COVID lockdown/lack of practice hurt these players‚Äô ability to tackle? I was too distracted by the election to tune in on Ravens‚Äô preparation.
River's jersey is way too clean
This game has a similar feel to that Seahawks game last year where it was tight early on the road but then we came out strong in the second half and eventually wore them down
I think he shit himself a bit just a theory
Starting to think this is turning into  a 'let's level up all our depth for next year' kinda year
Queen is back in thank god
wait are we allowed to make second half adjustments?
Good fucking stop!
Dumb dumb call by Indy
let allen cook
"Well timed blitz, right there, to stop Indy on 4th down! Wink drew that up perfectly!"
Fuck off the field Rivers!!!
We must have switched offensive coordinators at the half
That's the noodle-arm Rivers I know and love
Colts thread in shambles lmao cant believe they didnt try to make it a one score game
"Despite the lack of Calais, Marlon, and Fort the defense has played well"
Rivers maaaaaaad.
Can‚Äôt fucking wait to get our man back next week! #44
OK JUDON
"Wtf, Judon can help?"
what‚Äôs up with the red white and blue line? what is that for? and why does it only show up in some games?
"For those of you youngins that became fans because of Lamar, watching the colts offense is what the flacco era was like."
"Great second half man, with the amount of starters out, we should be happy with how we played against this colts team."
What other streaks do we have left to keep today? Got the turnover one. Got the 20+ pt one. Just got 100 yards rushing.
flex on a tackle when you know its gonna be a run and youre down by 11?
Mekaris really struggled today
Harrison did his best impression of Ralph Wiggum torpedo'ing through a window.
I thought Dorsey was already out with an injury...
Lucas Oil turf sucks
Lol they could‚Äôve kicked a field goal but went for it
Great job D!!
"Rivers is just so, so whiny"
I just expect a flag every time we force an incompletion tbh
Kill the clock
3 x 4 is 12. First down every time. Keep running it.
tuck man does it again
Best win of the year. Love how this team came out after all that noise. Colts is a top 2 D.
WHAT A BOUNCE BACK MAN HELL YES
Tucker was like... Not on my watch lol
$J$Money$
Tucker tackles better than half our defence does lmao
"2nd half shutout, let's go. Send a message."
"Do you all not try to get a tackle with Tucker on every kickoff on madden? Usually just end up taking a block, but I have gotten some tackles, one being a low hit forced fumble."
"Big time win today, boys"
what are these weirdos doing
GG Indy
Scoring won't help gamblers one way or the other so what's the point in this last play?
Thank god they ain‚Äôt score a TD that would‚Äôve been bs tbh lol
They kicking a fg.
Dont forget that we already wasted our Bye week.
Total overreaction by this fan base. We‚Äôre playing two top 5 defenses back to back
Has a league MVP ever regressed this bad in 1 season to the next? I know our line sucks right now but he just looks lost. Can't even run right anymore
"Colts fans in here, you're losing while we're missing 3/4 of our best players"
Harbaugh needs to pull the plug on GRo. We need to run Seattle or Arizona‚Äôs offense.
Lamar has been really poor. Arguably worse than the play-calling. He is lucky he doesn't have an interception.
In before someone blames Roman for the fumble
Why not pitch it there
That was impressively pathetic
Our Special Teams and Defense coaches are trying to win a SB. Roman is not it seems like
I will say it every single week. If we cannot consistently throw the ball down the field this offensive experiment is done
Get bonds off the field man
"Nothing new, this is who this team is this year"
"Come on brown, you wanted the ball!"
Cmon hollywood
Hollywood dropping a perfect pass.
Started Dez in fantasy this week because fuck it my other option was Crowder and I'm projected to win by 60 anyway lmao
every week it gets harder to have faith in this team
Barry bonds would of had that
This team is gunna make me start drinking again been sober for 10 years
Imagine having the league‚Äôs MVP on your team and then playing like this the next year.
Rodrigo gotta be the coolest lookin kicker in the league
Wow. We are really seeing the effect of not having an O-Line leader like Yanda.
"i'll tell the offense to run the ball, can i be the new OC"
Is this year Lamar's 2015???
I keep seeing ‚ÄúQBs have bad days‚Äù. Great QBs NEVER have bad 5 game stretches and never bad seasons.
"Offense finally starts to get their shit together and Gus just gives it away come on man. I like Gus but we can't let that slide, bench his ass rest of this game"
Everyone apologize!! LOL
DUMB CHALLENGE HUH
"I think the most frustrating part of this season is how bad we've looked with  good enough personnel. We aren't world beaters, but we're better than we were last year talent-wise. We should be able to play like this every week"
"Greg Roman is the booth during the game right?

Because there was someone who looked like James Urban on the sideline with a playsheet. The coach on the sideline was holding the sheet up block his mouth and talking into a headset.

I honestly think James Urban is calling plays now."
Rivers cannot throw downfield anymore.
Damn that was some vintage Lamar right there. Pretty.
"That block from Andrews though, half a TD right there, love to see"
Roman/Jackson 2024
"You couldn't pay me to watch those late night shows. So painfully unfunny even their laugh tracks need a 3 drink minimum, let alone the live audiences"
"Chuck Clark, DeShon Elliott, Ferguson, Queen and Peter's played so we'll.

Honestly entire D but Judon. Woooo"
Someone other than Roman please call 3rd down plays FFS!
"How the fuck does Roman have Harbaugh bring up Dez, yet have not a single fuckin plan on how to use him in the passing game? Absolute clown shit. Fucking use Dez already"
#JK YOU FRICCIN MORON
The Ravens are borderline Jets level right now
"That ain‚Äôt it Roman. Didn‚Äôt work the first time, didn‚Äôt work the second."
Lets make one thing clear. We are NOT superbowl contenders. Not even close.
"THE HIT ON SNEAD WASN'T FLAGGED. THIS IS LEGAL, RIGHT NFL?!"
"it's like a kick in the balls man i took lamar super early in fantasy this year, absolutely gross"
"Y'all really dickriding Hollywood rn. Y'all was just waiting for him to mess up, hating ass weirdos"
"Time for my favorite Raven, Terrell ""Owens, Barry"" Bonds, to step up to the plate (and hopefully deliver) today!"
Early game tweak. Wrap him up he‚Äôll be okay.
O line is trash now
Hollywood I don‚Äôt want to see shit about not getting looks. What a terrible drop.
And that‚Äôs why we don‚Äôt throw to hollywood
This offense is dogshit
Need a turnover or something to get us pumped up.  This just feels like its going the wrong way
Wow we‚Äôre bad
"Okay now everyone except Lamar and the TEs need to get it together

Edit: Or we just kick it old school and defense scores all the points"
All we need is for Dobbins to be possessed by the spirit of Buck Allen and we will be sitting pretty
I do believe that might be some momentum boys
"Popeyes spicy chicken sandwich > Chick fil a 

It‚Äôs not even close"
If the offense was half as good as last year can y‚Äôall imagine how dangerous this team would be? Smh
I mean... not sure what the Ravens can really do. They can't set the edge without Campell. Hard to blitz because we only have really 3 healthy corners. Pass rush can't really do much because of the amount of running they are doing.
Chris Board laying the Boards today
This thread lol. Just because the play didn't work doesn't mean the play call was bad
Lamar is not getting an extension this offseason. Barring a complete 180 turnaround soon
3rd & 35 lmao thanks Lamar
Lamar needs to learn how to step up in the pocket.
This offense is just hideous
Roman needs to get fired this fucking week!! The offense looks pathetic today!
We legit haven‚Äôt looked good since we got shellshocked by the Chiefs. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a mental block or a coaching problem but it‚Äôs not looking good for us
"Number of times Lamar has been sacked thru 8 games this year: 20

Number of times sacked all of last year: 23"
Hate to say it but that was a good call
Why do we give a 7 yard cushion every fucking play
Fucked that boy up
We're ass right now and it sucks
Why does Lamar never throw the ball away?
"I know Lamar hasn't looked great today, but for fucks sake GIVE THE MAN A POCKET."
"We need to Kubiak GRo Monday morning Edit- Cam Cameron, my bad"
So how are we going to blame this fumble on on Greg?
Roman spread butter all over gus‚Äô uniform at halftime fucking POS
Why are the colts allowed to slow this pace down over and over without a timeout being taken?
"‚ÄúAnd the Colts are looking around wondering, what happened?‚Äù

LAMAR MUTHER FUCKING JACKSON happened bitch."
#Judon did something!!!
Oline blocking has been to me the most frustrating this year
I honestly still can‚Äôt believe the Colts opted for Rivers for Brissett I don‚Äôt understand that move
Lamar can‚Äôt come from behind ü§´ü§´ü§´ü§´
This is the turning point in our season
It‚Äôs like you guys aren‚Äôt even fans how u gon shit on ur own players
"That should've been a penalty, he's a defenseless player."
"Jesus christ. Down vote me for this all you want, but this entire coaching staff needs reevaluation."
"After that overturn, I never wanna hear /r/ravens bitch about how the refs are conspiring to destroy us again lol"
This team is pathetic
Elliot if you looked for the ball u can catch it instead you do some bitch shit.
I love that their kicker wears glasses
"I love watching college football, because I can watch Qbs who throw more than 100 yards in a half. Seriously wtf is up with Lamar this year? He‚Äôs been awful. I‚Äôm gonna drink ü§ï"
that was incomplete as fuck lmao but HELL YEAH
"Y'all relax. Gd. Its 7 points in the 1st quarter, wtf is wrong with u guys"
"How are we feelin' ladies and gents? Gotta bounce back, right? Right?!"
Maaaan I hate white jerseys lol unless they're over black pants like the 2012 SB.
hoping jk gets more snaps this week he looked great against pitt
No live comments? Fuck u/Spez you need to get this app right
that tucker commercial tho lmao
LET'S GO RAVENS!!!!
Lego Pt. 8
Justice Hill first TD of his career today! I‚Äôm calling it
I love when we defer
BURGER
Ah fuck
Wow
That little strip of light must be so annoying to QBs lol
FUCK
Jesus Christ
Are you fucking kidding me...
Campbell nooooooo
Oh fuck me man
"Im hoping and thinking cramp.  Massaging calf and they looked to push on the top of his foot.  When he got up, the face he made looked similar to a cramp face."
Hes walking at least
Please be ok please be ok please be ok please be ok
"Jc, I hope hes ok.  We can't afford to lose him too"
We‚Äôre turning into the Eagles
Where were u when Calais ded
"The good news is at least Calais and Marlon haven't been out best defensive players. 

Wait. What's that? Ruh roh."
Our te‚Äôs love to hurdle
Sweet flying knee.
Can our TE‚Äôs not hurdle???
"Fucking awful offense, again, surprise."
Wat in the fuck was that
That was absolute shit
anyone know where i could get harb's mask?
Did Dorsey hurt his arm there? It cut to commercial too quickly.
We definitely need better oline to compete
"Rivers is so trash, but the team around him is stacked"
Looks like we haven't shown up
Random bum 38 still getting killed
"Rivers literally saying ""38"" on the Line of Scrimmage. Then they ran it at him."
Gonna be a 50 PA game isn't it...
Marlon needs to be back yesterday holy shit
Yikes.
Look like trash right now. Sheesh.
"More DPI penalties, jfc"
ugh fuck
Can‚Äôt ask for everything but really wish we could have gotten Desmond king
"Aside from last year, I always feel like we have the absolute worst offensive play calling in the NFL. It's not even something you need to see during the play, you feel it when you see our formations. It doesn't feel like NFL caliber at all."
These injuries man it's getting scary.
"Well, lets see what the O can do."
Okay everyone we were down 7-0 last game too and ran it for quite a while let's just chill
"Down by 7 now, time to pass too much and lose this game"
I‚Äôm literally praying every time this offense is on the field
If I don‚Äôt see some fucking development in the passing game this week I‚Äôm going to be despondent
"Just tuned in, what did I miss?"
That was certainly something
Offense is going to have to carry today. I still believe it can happen.
#SKURA GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
Jesus christ skura
Skura needs to get them snaps up man
"The chiefs game was the peak of the rollercoaster. One where the climb doesn‚Äôt look that steep, but the decline is dug into the ground, so you drop much further than expected."
nice play + throw
FUCKING HELL SKURA.
Skura wtf are you doing
The fuck is with these snaps?
What a play by Lamar.
Looked like Flacco to Rice.
thank god for the first down but Skura needs to ... learn how to snap the ball??????
Snaps were shitty last week too
"ha, that defender popped his own guy"
Indy likes leading with their helmets
cmon hollywood
Cmon guys!!! We‚Äôve got this!
Damn he gotta catch that
"This is so painful. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm even finishing this, boys."
Last year's offense ran like a well-tuned formula 1 car. This year it feels like we put 87 in the tank
"I wanna see a yannick sack, lets get it done"
How you gonna have souljas and they never make tough catches?(never)
Hollywood could have just pulled the ball to his chest.  Smh
Bonds about to have 200 yards on him alone
Gonna just keep throwing to whoever Bonds is covering lmao
When Terrell Bonds blows a coverage üòë
right at bonds
There we go!
LETS FUCKING GO
Letsss goooo
CLARK LETS GO
Please get tramon
Yes Clark!
Making Rivers look like he's only 34 with 5 kids
YESSSS THE FUMBLE RECOVERY FOR THE TD!! LETS' GO DEFENSE
Ok can someone make that gif of rivers falling
Oh fuck yea!!!!
Chuck that makes up for the PI!!!!
Rivers falling down was beautiful ü§£
That was a clean strip.  This is good.
Fucking huuuuuuuge! Let‚Äôs fucking go!
FUCKING PLEASE
"Fumble Indianapolis. Ravens recover

  Touchdown!!!!"
Man what a return
FUCK YES!
Thank the lawd
Thank fuckkk
"No Marlo, no problem!"
They gang-banged that ball carrier üòÇüòÇ
Also CHUCK CLARK holy shit
That out  that's a TD
Chiseled Adonis better have a neat sound effect for that strip for this week's episode.
I don't care if defense scores all day long.
Who stripped it
Fuck yeahhhh
YESSSSSSSS
Defense saves the day again
Love to see it
Now can we just capitalize on this and shift the momentum please?
Haha Rivers defeat as he realized he was getting hurdled is definitely one for the photobook
"Fuck the MP haters. (Yes, my stream is mad behind."
I was just thinking we would need the defense to score!
Malik headhunting out here üëÄüëÄ
i'm hoping chuck just lit a fire under everyone's asses
Can't give up 10 yards every play
That wasn't holding?
Wow Jaylon. I'm surprised by that he's been playing better
did malik force the fumble?
getting hammered on these zone runs and end arounds
This is a terrible start but damn it‚Äôs still 7-7
Ed Reed in shambles rn
omggg almost picked
Holy shit Bonds you gotta catch that
"Just got here. I heard Campbell is hurt. Does it appear to be bad?    

And has Dez been on the field yet?"
We gotta lucky there. Guy was wide open for a first down
[deleted]
"We need a drive here, and we literally have 0 yards on the ground"
Not gonna throw again.
Somewhere the Surrender Index twitter guy shakes his fist in disgust at this display of cowardice
Where‚Äôs the Gus bus?
Why do our receivers struggle with separation so much
Alright we tried to throw down the field. Idk if no one was open or Lamar didn‚Äôt want to.
Thought edwards was hurt but he just fixed his shoe lol
"Man, I forgot we don‚Äôt have Hump today. Sad, but still glad to see the defense keeping us in it even with out him and Campbell. 

We have to accept that this is a season where we will have to rely on the defense while our offense struggles with its identity crisis. I have faith it will work itself out eventually, but it feels worse just because how electric last year was. Have faith flock."
Are we purposefully injuring our own players? What the fuck is our luck this year?
Why we can't ever make this work man
That‚Äôs why skura has been fucking up
Looked slow AF
Ugh that screen should have been so much better
At least we are seeing more screens now.
Hey that was a screen that wasn‚Äôt completely blown up!
Trash ass offense.
So predictable every play
I‚Äôm actually digging the dump offs. It makes it easier for him to rip off big scramble runs when it isn‚Äôt always expected
Can we just get Dez on the field can‚Äôt be worse then this
Bozeman completely lost on that play
This offence is nearly as decrepit as it was during the Flacco era......
Trash. Absolute trash
Thats a great play by Leonard jeez man.
Bozeman what are you doing?!
bozeman is getting punked
We need to sit Bozeman. He isn't blocking anyone and then Lamar would have more room to run.
Greg Roman has to be fired or we‚Äôre wasting this season
Bozeman is playing like absolute garbage
"Another 3rd down

Another idiotic QB draw play!"
WTF R THESE PLAYS
Not a good punt
Fire Roman man our offense is actually so bad the play calling is so stale
Someone wake up Bozeman! He's getting shit on every play.
Our O is t moving at all dammit
Roman WHY are you calling these DUMBASS QB Keeper plays???
This is tough to watch
You cant call plays like we still have Yanda and Stanley on the line man.
"That isn't a terrible play call if Bozeman picks up Leonard, but he didn't, so it was terrible."
Can we at least attempt a pass that isn't five yards or less?
How are they practicing against our dline and think these plays would work like do they work at the practice????
Greg Roman isn't getting fired anytime soon. Let's just hope we grind out a few defence led wins. InLamarwetrust
Roman going for that ‚ÄúPittsburgh Model‚Äù to win a game. Don‚Äôt play offense until the opposing QB gives you amazing field position.
This offense has zero flow. Quick screens working? QB draw on 3rd & 10. Rushing for 10 yards every play? Deep bomb on 3rd & 1. JFC
Who the fuck is bonds
Had Bozeman made the block that would've been either a first or 4th & inches. Bozeman is to blame there
"Please give Ben powers a chance, he CANT be worse than what we have going right now"
If we plan on running on 3rd and shmedium why don't we give it to a back?
Let‚Äôs call the same plays we have been calling with no success for the last 7 games. They‚Äôll never see it coming!
"Said this last week and ill say it again, get rid of greg roman"
is that rivers still tryna target bonds
Do we have a sack?
MOOOOM dad is jerking it to sports cars again
Yeah that‚Äôs the smart pass. Between three defenders...
Double Andrews. Do everything else straight up. Ravens offense done.
That‚Äôs like the 4th screen. Shows you that coaching has zero confidence in Lamar right now.
Wtf is going on with this offense?  Its beyond frustrating
Was that a screen lmao? That was so bad
Run the ball. It‚Äôs 7-7 in the second quarter!
"The playcalling, the execution, holy shit"
Roman loves the empty formation despite the fact that it never seems to work
Love when lamar throws fucking dots
"There was some actual venom on that pass, happily surprised"
Finally a nice fucking play!
That was beautiful
Third time's the charm! Jackson and Andrews finally connect for the 1st down!
"Laser, let's go"
The offense looking like some shit. They need to get it together before the half
A normal fucking pass play gets the first fuck Romans shitty calling
Philip crybaby Rivers
Can Lamar make any other throw than 10 yards over the middle?
Was that a throw for more than 10 yards??? OMG ITS A MIRACLE!
Lamar is getting picked if he keeps this shit up.  Windows too tight
WHY ARE WE RUNNING ONE READ THROWS
Jesus Lamar should play the lottery 2 dropped picks
throwing into quadruple coverage????????????????????????????????????????
"Garbage throws, garbage run, garbage offense"
Good god terrible throw
What the fuck does he see on these passes!
I love Juiceman lol
Chill out marcus
MP WTF
"I really hate to say it I do, Lamar is this offense's problems this season"
Here comes the penalties
And just as I congratulate Lamar on making a good pass this almost interception happens
Why TF is peters out there!
Why tf are all these passes targeted *at* the offensive line
Looked like Brown stopped for a step. Did that make Lamar throw behind where he should have for a little bit?
Wow did we actually get a penalty in our favor?
Thank god man. Peters plz don't do that again
EJECT STALLWORTH
Love the fire out of Mekari
"Our opponents have had a ridiculously high number of dropped INTs this year, probably because they're being caught off guard by the ball being thrown right at them"
Peters what the hell are you doing
Defenses always look like their one step ahead of this GRo offense.
This year just ain't it chief ...
#32 is the new Kiko Alonso
Can't wait to see r/nfl complain about us getting a late hit/unnecessary roughness again.
"Shouldnt that be the penalty that gets auto-ejection, or am I thinking of another one?"
"Lololol suck my balls, Indy"
Our interior oline is getting eaten alive can we hit the outsides on just some simple stretches??
Yeah he should be ejected
"In a season in which I drafted Kenny Galloday, Chris Godwin, AJ Brown, Christian McCaffrey, Laveon Bell, Dallas Goedart, and Julian Edelman, it‚Äôs looking like I may finally win my first game!"
fuck blackmon
What a terrible fucking sack to take
Lol all I can do is laugh
bruh
o line needs to step up man. we can‚Äôt run or pass with them playing like this
JFC JUST THROW IT AWAY
Wtf is wrong with Lamar this year wow
Seriously RB is getting hit 3 yards behind the line UP THE MIDDLE. That is absurd.
This field is trash
hero mode activated
Really....really....what the hell was that.  lol
Just throw the damn ball away
Lamar needs to stop running back. I don‚Äôt know why he thinks that‚Äôs ok.
"Thought he could outrun him, can't blame him"
Are you kidding me Lamar
How does Jackson get caught there???
lamar could save a lot of yards per game by just throwing the fucking ball away
Does he not realize that continuing to go backwards only makes it more difficult for the offensive line?
Who even needs a field goal lol!
Lmao another illegal formation
Pathetic
of course they wont miss an oline hold on us
How many fucking illegal formations can we get this year
3rd and 25 call a QB sneak.
3rd & 35...
How many illegal formations do we get a game?
Holy fuck our o-line is dogshit
LMAO
"This line is so bad, gonna be a rough second half of the year"
We need to shore up oline in the draft
God damn it
We've had more 3rd and 20+ this year than the last couple combined.
This offense is fucking dog shit
Yikes I thought that punt was blocked at first
We‚Äôre probably stuck with Roman until the end of the season fellas.
"cant draw up any plays 10 yards down the field, cant get any yards rushing. idk what we keep expecting from this offense."
Trolls incoming
This is no bueno
You know things are bad when the official Ravens twitter is celebrating [fucking first downs](https://imgur.com/hIufu4W)
Nice to see the 4 man rush. That is what we went out to get Yannick for.
"dont need to be 6'8 to stuff a pass, lets go"
Can we just have one game without one illegal formation penalty please?
Oline lets 2 free rushers go through and Lamar has to try to run out of the pocket and somehow its all on him... ok
"Did anyone think our luck would settle a little bit after the Marlon news? I was like, ‚ÄúOK ... NOW our luck can‚Äôt get any worse... right?‚Äù"
This defense is too good for our offense to play like this.
"maybe the oline injuries are doing it, but it really just looks like the defense knows what the hell plays were running"
IM GONNA STUFF MY FACE WITH PIZZA
I‚Äôve never seen a defensive player catch a ball in the end zone and not have to move to score
"SHOW THE JUDON CATCH ATTEMPT.

Jesus, how is replay so bad?"
Dude I'm so over Judon.
"Judon again, no surprise there....."
Is Judon serious
Judon is killing us
Of course it‚Äôs a foul. Nothing good can happen for us.
What the fuck is this team
Why are we paying judon 16 million to do nothing
Low football IQ. Nothing else to say really
Judson is a bonehead.
Dammit Judon
That might have been a fumble
Pernell with the daily double....rip alex trebek
"Why can't Lamar phase through the incoming pass rushers? Everyone knows MVP means most (in)visible player. He could easily teleport past these rushers, I think RG3 would be able to. Trade him for nightcrawler smh trash."
Can we fire judon as well?
That was a soft call
"EDIT- Was McPhee, sry Judon"
Cut judon. He fucks them over and over
I‚Äôm pretty much over this version of this team
HE WAS  GETTING HIT WHAT THE FU K
Yeah that was probably the right call
I'm so fucking dumb with these stupid RTPs
Why can‚Äôt Hollywood make that type of catch and play.
Is that what's supposed to happen whenever Hollywood comes back after a catch?
Somebody really needs to call holding there.
Wow a team on the field is throwing the ball
2nd big play with Judon in coverage lol wth
So this is what moving the ball looks like?
"we were physical and stuffing each receiver that play, thats what we need"
"Nice play by Ferguson,  saved a TD"
chuck da mvp
That should have been a penalty
Pls football gods save our Offense
Fucking hold
We on track for our 3rd straight 10 penalty game?
Kneel the ball till half.
"Here's the thing. While the team hasn't looked great, the score is still 10-7 Colts.  The Ravens are still in this."
Just kneel it omg
Kneel it don‚Äôt even try
cringe ass screens
going out of bounds and not throwing safe is dumb. watch this offense give it back to indy in 30s lmao
ravens football has been frustrating to watch these past weeks.
Lamar looks awful
Andrews just beat his man. O-Line is shit.
We look like a bunch of little bitches out there right now. Where‚Äôs the attitude? The fight?
We need to figure out this OL for reals.....
Practically just gave em 3. Terrible play calling
We won‚Äôt see Dez play since we can‚Äôt even drive it past the 50
Yall wanna be we so garbage that Philips scores again?
"if they score here, im turning this game off"
"Make adjustments , play good D. Game still within reach"
What an absolute pile of hot garbage
I almost can‚Äôt even watch the offense
Quick slant for 10. Why don‚Äôt we do that??
yeah if they score im crying
"Good news, it's all up from here! lol"
Who knew Ingram was so important
What in the actual fuck is this playcalling though?
This game has been so frustrating. Our offense just looks horrific. We‚Äôre lucky we‚Äôre only down by 3
"We look bad, oof..."
The line is trash and the playcalling is worse
We need some bunch formations or something to help out receivers get open.
"The O line is a huge weakness for us this year, Yanda retiring hurt us but I was hopeful that the line would hold strong but with Stanley out it's obvious they are struggling. It also doesn't help that Greg Roman wants the Ravens to be the Chiefs so badly but it's just not working and Lamar is regressing because of it. Also why would you sign Dez and not do anything with him, at least make it look like you want him to be a part of the game."
I can‚Äôt believe the offense gets worse every week. Without being good in the 1st place
Here we go!!
Hollywood Brown on a slant!
They PA confusion lol
Things are... happening.. ????
omfg a first down on first down... did I teleport back to 2019?!
I don‚Äôt see what other people have seen this season on why there is so much hope for this offense to turn it around? It‚Äôs really bad
More of this wtf
"LOL they really have eye-level plexiglass between the announcers?

It's like a non-smoking section at a restaurant.  All for show."
Look you let him throw beyond the LOS and good shit happens.
"finally we're doing something, love these quick passes that gain 7-10 yards"
"Oh hey, Willie Snead is still on the team"
LAMAR???
OUR OFFENSE HAS A PULSE
am i watching a different game??
YES DO THESE THINGS.
Nice fucking play. I‚Äôm liking what i‚Äôm seeing right now
We‚Äôre playing.... well?
"2nd and 1, isn‚Äôt that when you should try a pass down field?"
We got more yards this drive than the whole 1st half wtf
"See this is the offense that works, quick passing, keeping the defense guessing and constantly moving."
2019 lamar type beat
thats MY QB BABY
"20 straight losses when trailing at half?  Coaching, right?"
More yards in these 3 minutes than in the whole 1st half
This is the best drive of the game.
"Wait, who's calling plays??"
You have to be shitting me
And there‚Äôs me eating crow
KMS
Fuck my fucking life
Of course
FFS
Lol
FUCK
Sigh
I was not aware of the losing while trailing at half stat.
Wtf
Fuck
That‚Äôs about right
Not that. Less of that.
Sadness
Jesus lol. Come on Gusss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why?
go fuck yourself
Lol of course that drive ended with a turnover üòÇ
Lol
pain
That's just unlucky
did roman get the news he's being fired??
YOU HAVE TO BE FUCKING ME
Roman caused that fumble tbh
"There's nothing we can do, it's like we're fucking destined to be shit this year"
turning this shit off
So much momentum pissed away
This fucking team
Fuck my ass
preparing the bleach
Pain
Fade me
Nothing can go our way
"They score off this turnover, idk bout the rest of the game"
"Can‚Äôt have those mistakes, don‚Äôt wanna see Gus the rest of the quarter"
PETERS WHY
Damn peters almost
FUCK ME I THIUGHT HE HAD IT
And a dropped int lol good play by peters almost had it
fucking jesus christ guys COME ON
Kill me
*screams into the abyss*
"not a good ending, but need this change to continue"
FUCK! so close
This fucking team
WHAT IN THE ABSOLUTE FUCKING SHIT
Wtf he had it
This game is like a long series of cockblocks for us
so close MP <3
This team just hasn‚Äôt got what it takes. Mixture of bad play and bad luck. The most promising the teams looked and then that.
PAIN. Luckily our defense knows how to run a game plan :( unlike Mr eat more McDoubles
Was that a pick and a fumble? Worth a challenge at least...
I am about to die
This ain't gonna work
Fuck me in the ass
Bad challenge
Awful challenge
I think it holds. He took a couple steps
This seems like a.bad challenge
What the fuck.....waste of a challenge
That‚Äôs not a catch harbs ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Don't like that one
Fuck yeah lets randomly waste a challenge in a 1 score game in the 2nd half
"Terrible challenge, WTF."
Harbaugh is so fucking stubborn
I cant even with this game man
What a dumb challenge
The whole team wasnt out of practice this week. Holy shit the sloppiness continues. Get your team John
Holy sheet
okay Thank you let‚Äôs fucking goooo
I was not expecting that! I‚Äôll gladly eat the crow on that one!!!
Ayyy the refs like us for once
I never said it
Wtf!!! Okay!!
HOLY CRAP YES
WHAT THE FUCK?????
LOL how the fuck is that possible
Based Harb God
If the day ends in Y we take those
Alright how can we fuck up now? lol
I'm shocked as all hell on that call to overturn
Wow we got it
WTFFFF WE WON A CHALLENGE 2020 IS FUCKING CRAZY
eating my words
LETS GOOOOO
Wow
"I‚Äôm surprised it succeeded, but I‚Äôll take it!"
I was horribly wrong
"I still have my doubts on that, but it is what it is and its a positive."
Wtf?
Lol what the fuck????
GREAT CHALLENGE JOHN
Lol
Lol @ everyone calling it a bad challenge. He took multiple steps
"Blind squirrel finds nut, more news at 11..."
Gladly eat my words but how tf is that a catch lol
"##DOUBTERS BEGONE

##BELEE DAT"
Fuck great challenge might of just saved the game for us
I like the call but idk if I agree
Okay I was wrong lol
did not expect that
I'm sorry what?
THAT WAS FOR YOU MARLON
LMFAOOOOOOO
SOULJA
Let this be a turning point
That is a bailout call I think
Please get some fucking points offense
"Everyone in here ‚Äúomg Harbaugh is stupid other teams aren‚Äôt dumb‚Äù but he playing 4D chess 

(Note I also said it was dumb but let‚Äôs move past that lol)"
"Dez prolly like ""then how tf was my catch against GB not a catch?"""
Charles they just said he wasn't going down til after the 3rd step.
Marquise still just looks like a child out there to me
"Uhhhhh we take those 

Eye test says that was not a catch in my opinion"
That was a gift being called a catch
Okok yayyy wooho- fucking score.
Look at that strike by Lamar. Stop limiting him in the passing game.
THATS MY SOULJA
LMAOOOO HOW TF DID WE GET THAT
Lol at the people in the thread who said that was an awful challenge
Put Dez on the field you fucking cowards
Well I'll be dammed John
MARCUS PETERS FOR WR1
Lol were just playing for a fg now
Hollywood clutch today.
RGIII‚Äôs hair looking kinda funny
Can we start charging time outs for these flops?
Boyle having an ok game
Feed the Boyle!!!
Boyle getting touches today
I give Jackson credit for looking a lot better so far.
What weird voodoo ritual shit do we have to do to go back to last year :(
I‚Äôd say I hope Roman keeps an eye on this offensive pacing because it has been highly effective but you know how he gets when things are working
Mekari didnt block anyone there.
"Alright, what did you guys do to Greg Roman ?"
Let‚Äôs go!!!!!
#BEEP BEEP MOTHERFUCKING REDEMPTION
TOUCHDOWN BITCHES
THATS MY FUCKIN MVP
No way that wasnt in
He was in previous play
"Touchdown Gus, in the lead, now we just gotta keep it up"
LETS GOOOOO
this is some big boy no lil boy time
TOUCHDOWN
That non challenge as good as the MP challenge.
Justin Tucker is a mule!
Has a choice to start the bus or JK. Should have chose the Bus.
"I know we got the TD, but Lamar had nothing but green if he keeps that ball and rolls out to the right"
I am now enjoying this again
Defense is looking rested and energized
Good job Defense
Holy shit rivers is bad
How did Felipe get away from that lmao
Idk if Bowser blew his coverage at first or not but he just saved us that play he made up so much ground
I'm ready for a bomb of a TD pass
This can‚Äôt be Roman calling the plays haha
Lamar has got his mojo back!
Llama so fast when turns on the jets
Lamar juked himself
Damn llama got 5 yards outta that
GO FOR IT
I wanna go for it but I'm just glad the offense has a pulse
Damn that was an excellent job by their DTs to close
We‚Äôre gonna go for it
Pretty sure Lamar had the crosser route that would've had the first down.
Go for it!
Fucking go for it. Pound them up the middle.
"IF WE GO FOR IT, WE GOT IT"
Go for it!
had the easy first down to andrew
HELL YEA COACH LETS GO FOR IT
This is way too close to their endzone to not go for it. It is statistically a bad play to not go for this
im just waiting for a slant
JK
Got it baby
Gutsy call
THATS MY FUCKING SLIME
Good. Let‚Äôs get the pace going again after the break
What's with these snaps?
lets gooooooooooo jk
Willie Snead was wide TF open and Lamar decides to take off. I don‚Äôt get him sometimes man.
"We need to put mekuri at center, skura is going to cost us a possession"
Announcer was right. Energy is completely different
We look so good üò≠üò≠
Move the chains!
These snaps though
The snaps today have been awful
yes keep it running!
NeedIVSnead
If Skuras thumb isn't healing by next week do we have anyone else we trust at centre?
It‚Äôs the inconsistencies that have bothered me. When he‚Äôs on his game Lamar looks unstoppable as what‚Äôs been shown this half. Frustrating knowing what he‚Äôs capable of while watching him NOT do that all year
Fade to Dez
I love how Edwards is such a chill and quiet dude
Bozeman just got blown tf up
Great blocking on that run
"Even though that wasn‚Äôt a first, that spin was clean af"
"Love this second half offense. Run, run, run, set up the play action and it will lead to passes"
"Bozeman got pancaked on that play, Jesus"
Colts defender Bozeman
Leonards is a monster
LFG!!!!!!!!
What's with these loud ass whistles
How do we look like this in the second half and complete shit in the first?
Get in bitch
Vintage Jackson
Our 2 o linemen got knocked down. Also where has this O been all year
# WOOOOOOOOOOOO
LAMARKABLE
like a fast Peyton Manning
Night and day.
play calling on this drive was amazing
There we go baybeeeee. Just need him to get comfy throwing shots downfield now
That was legit a beautiful play design and call
LETS GODDAMN GO BABY FUCKING TWO OF OUR BEST DEFENSIVE PLAYERS GONE O-LINE SHAMBLES WE FIGHT LEZGOOO
What a play call
HELL YA COACH LETS GO FOR ITüòàüòàüòàüòà
I love you and I love everything
Pretty sure this was on in the locker room at half. https://youtu.be/cwfWSX0FYlI
Glad they showed a replay focusing on Andrews.  Now I see what you all were talking about!
This second half adjustment is just what we needed. We've looked SO much better
"This feels like the Seahawks game in 2019, on the road against a good team, defence scores to keep us in it, Lamar wills us to victory."
Need that first tackle sir
Wrap up that tackle Queen!!!
Needs me a sack
Mad dog was so aggressive pulling Jimmy up
Damn coulda been a stop
Jfc
NO
Patrick no
0 sacks smh
I wouldn't have imagined this after that fumble
Fuck not Queen
Im guessing a concussion.
Wrap the fuck up.
Unreal
"Jc,  I can't take it."
and right on cue
Please no more injuries
they need to learn to wrap up then go for the ball. stop bouncing off
 Damn queen is still in the game
OK JUDON
LET'S FUCKING GO DEFENSE!!!!
Omg I was expecting a flag
Way to go you BIG VEINY D!!
Is that the game?
Judon clutch af
LETS GOOOOOOOO
FUCK YES
YES D
"I am live finally. First I want to say Lamar hit a LB so hard, he made him cry. And props to Skura for playing dad and tried to whoop some ass when Lamar got speared."
Judon did a thing
Judon holy shit!
Judon nearly unblocked made a play!
FUCK YES!!!! PENE-FUCKING-TRATION!!!
Great stop
LETS GO D
Wow colts had been getting 4 or 5 a run. I think they over thought that one.
"Brown was standing in the danger zone there, that was close"
Judon playin soccer
PotG will be the second half adjustments on this one if we hold on
ABSOLUTELY SEXY!!!! NICE DEFENSE BOYS!!!!
Fg and we win
We had 10 ppl on the field as well lol
"Stupid play call from Indy. 
I am fine with that."
"Lol the Colts have 16 plays 47 yards in the 2nd half 0 points

Domination"
This is where we are our best.
"well, they get the ball right back"
Did I just hear that guys name is Grover Stewart?
What the shit I thought it was still the 3rd quarter! Haha
Boy that's disappointing
Hines gotta fair catch
Colts dealing with a lot of injuries this game too.
Another injury?!? wtf man
Save Dorsey! No more punts!
Here comes Rivers with his cry baby bullshit
Lmao wtf kind of 4th down play was that
Cry baby Rivers.
Solid coverage by Bonds
Lots of Rivers throws to the Middle of the field where Ed Reed 100% could've hustled and gotten there
LOL. They tried to run a bullshit pick play but ended up fucking themselves over
I mean I'd go for it but I might be insane
Automa-Tuck
"Still so little protection from the line, hopefully our starting 5 can mesh a little bit down the line"
Dagger. We win.
"Good, getting some practice time in for Justin Tucker to show that he's still the best in the league."
Need a mandrews td or antonio brown to fuck shit up to win my fantasy game
Automatuck
"Damn last miss 2015, gotta love Tucker!"
Bonds got hurdled... ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
kicker tackle!
what is going on üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Good guys win today boys
Watch them kick a field goal here
How can an offense this retarded be a professional NFL offense?
Lamar‚Äôs been decent this game Greg Roman isnt giving him anything to work with
"Greg Roman: Wow Lamar's doing good, Let's give the ball to someone else

#FUCKYOU"
lol that was not a catch
A player makes one tweet about being frustrated with our terrible offense and y'all wait to talk shit on our own player lol. Weird as fuck
If Lamar isn't even going to attempt to look down field then yea I guess he is just a RB playing QB at this point.
Refs have a huge hate boner for the ravens this year. Thats split second. Bullshit.
hey a bad call went our way for once. I guess I'll take it?
Pitch it Lamar like wtf
Judon drops into coverage a lot... And is pretty decent at it for an LB. Do you guys know anything or just like to complain?
"This sub makes it sound like we the jets, we doing something right we 5-2"
Holy fuck our offense is dogshit bruh I might have to stop watching this shit
This makes me more nervous than I already was. Ugh
Dobbins missed call?
eh it's still early we got time to adjust
Classic Ravens Secondary
Who do I feel like this will be our yearly blowout game
Go get em soldier
They need to stop running the ball on first down. Straight up. We can‚Äôt block well enough to get one yard on a QB sneak let alone 5 on first down.
The penalties don't stop man
If we go 14 down. We will be forced to pass. We can‚Äôt pass. This team can‚Äôt win unless it has a nice lead.
Rivers looked just like Brady bitch ass sitting in the grass like a scolded child
Dude fuck all of these trick plays
We just plainly don‚Äôt have the speed on the edge to stop screens. It hurts to watch.
Any word on Campbell?
Oh bonds even when you do something good you f it up
Fuck this stupid ass playcalling man. Wtf is this
"The Ravens forced & recovered a Jonathan Taylor fumble &  proceeded to return it 65 yds for a TD

This marks their 21st straight game w/ a takeaway (extending back to Wk 4, 2019), the longest active streak in the NFL & longest streak by any team since the '13-'14 Eagles (also 21) - @NFLResearch"
I couldn‚Äôt watch another week of our offense and judging off the comments I was right to do so.
Love Peters getting into that. That is a guy we want on our team.
We gotta trade judon in the offseason man
Judon is trash
"I‚Äôm glad we look as bad as we do right now, if we were up I have no doubt half of y‚Äôall would be defending the bad offensive play just like last week and Eagles week"
Yeahhh how about the souljas get open so we can use them? Damn that might be too much to ask these days.
That should have been a flag on Elliot. Useless hit too.
This team is so pathetic with penalties.
We‚Äôre playing a team that shuts the run down and we have top level speed at receiver. The game plan? Check downs and runs up the middle. We‚Äôre going to get blown out if we don‚Äôt start throwing the ball past 5 yards.
 I thing but pain right now
I know I'm just a random dude in the sub but this sub gets way too doomer during game threads.
"GODDAMN IT GREG ROMAN!

&#x200B;

WHY WOULD YOU RUN IT WITH A RUNNING BACK HE FUMBLED!   


FIRE GREG ROMAN!"
"This offense sucks absolute balls, basically 0 redeeming qualities, coordinators are bad and the players havent been any better."
"John, don't waste the challenge here please."
What is that challenge
Another terrible challenge.  At least that's one thing that we've been consistent with.
That was such a bad call but it went our way so I'm not complaining lmao
Well the rules are 3 steps and like it or not peters did that. I still don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a catch but it followed the new rules
Oh my God we have an offense again
Be ok baby
I fucking hate that we can't make 10 yards to put this thing to bed.
"We're so afraid of Lamar's passing abilities. As each game passes, I'm starting to wonder more and more whether or not Lamar is the future."
Man Lamar has regressed so far....this is sad.
We fucking stink
yo holy shit this sub is so fucking over reactive
You guys shitting on Hollywood are some scum.. Fuck you.
"Two streaks end today:

0-6 in Indy  
20 straight losses when trailing at halftime"
Stop this College bullshit! Become a real offense or we won‚Äôt ever win shit. Fuck Roman rn
[deleted]
All season y'all have been begging for more running plays and now y'all are mad that we're not passing.
Legal hit
"We need throw it downfield in the second half. If Lamar can't do it, it's time to move on."
"Hey guys, let's play RG3, fire all our coaches, and draft a qb next year"
"Welp folks guess the seasons over. No point in watching any more of the games we all know what‚Äôs gonna happen. Might as well trade Lamar and Hollywood for Flacco. 

JFC some of you doomers are insufferable. Yes we were a dominant offense last year and while the offense hasn‚Äôt played to that level this year it is still a good offense. 

We‚Äôre down 3 points on the road against another 5-2 team with a great defense. 

We‚Äôre down two all pros on defense, we‚Äôre facing a very good defense and we get the ball to start the 2nd half. Have some fucking faith."
fucking dumpoff on 3rd and 35
This team fucking sucks
[removed]
lol do people really think Lamar is completely absolved of all blame? he‚Äôs been awful lately
Haven‚Äôt kept up with the team this week... are our guys back that we‚Äôre on the covid list ? Or are we gonna have to try to win with 2nd and 3rd stringers?
"I think we‚Äôre going to be a wild card team
This year but I actually think that benefits us because there won‚Äôt be a true home field advantage this year."
Anyone have a link to the game? Or know where I can get one? I have HULU live but it doesn‚Äôt get the Chanel
"I'm starting Hollywood over Mike Evans this week, the truzz is high today"
Well thats trash.
awesome play call
nice play call
Terrible
Was that Proche injured on the coverage?
Luckily I'm still riding the good day that was yesterday.... so far looks like it's going to be a long game
7-0 already
im gonna have a stroke
"This defense really isn't a good as the stats show. Turnovers is all it can rely on and why the numbers look good. If they don't get TO's though it looks mediocre. We can't cover, YAC is probably 10+ yrds average this year. We can't get past a paper bag to put pressure on the QB even when we blitz 6 or 7. We lose 2 players and it too is borderline ready to collapse."
r we this bad
Hollywood needs to make that play.
Bitch what?
0 rush yards in the quarter. Perfect start for colts
Wolfe doing work
Chris Board flying around today
"Two top players on D are out. Two OL out. Offense in distress to start with. 

Penalties, bad snaps, drops, missed throws.  

Not a great start"
"Just gonna be one of those games, nothing you can do about it"
"We scored 2 TDs with Lamar running down the middle, let's not lose our mind."
Should we trade Lamar for buck Allen?
This team doesn‚Äôt deserve the playoffs.
Lamar bad
These play calls are ass man
"Something has to be going on in the locker room. The way this team is playing with shows a lack of being mentally prepared and their execution I showing it. Lack of effort on plays. Always throwing their hands to the sides after ""it doesn't go their way"". All these sloppy penalties. Hollywood going on twitter etc. Theres something going on...  Bc week 1 they looked bang on from last year. This year they look like we are lucky to slide by into the playoffs..."
Idk why I keep checking this thread y‚Äôall some sour pusses
Fuvking weak ass penalty
Getting shutout in a half? How grand
That kinda looked like a hit to a head
My god our defense needs to tighten up. Elliot could have really fucked Doyle up there. Were lucky he didnt get ejected
Ok wtf is going on
ROMAN YOU PUSSY ALREADY GIVING UP
Two fucking runs in a row when the colts have timeouts. Harbaugh you absolute coward
"We have to be the worst offence in the league. Take away the numbers and just watch this team play. The Giants look better than we do. 

Time to say goodbye to GR"
Skura is having a nightmare game Jesus Christ
Can we do anything on offense?
"Anyone actually think our offense was going to do something there? 


Me neither."
They are taking rivers out so he doesn't fuck jt up with an int lol
Punt punt punt punt punt punt
Oh no we suck
I want Marty Mornhingweg back right now
The only person not being called out here is EDC and its the makeup and depth of the OL that has this team in its current predicament...
"Peters why the fuck are you celebrating you need to catch that, dumb shit."
John H is drunk as shit again
"so now we lose a timeout with this challenge, great (yes i will eat my words if im wrong but thats not a catch)"
This is what desperation looks like. Its turned into one of those seasons real quick.
"We are doing fine, guys. Just chill out, still in it"
"Harbaugh, what are you smoking, cuz it must be some strong shit."
"You've got to be shitting me with this challenge. Why are we so fucking stupid this year?

Other teams don't do this. Other teams are smart."
"Oh no, we suck again!"
THat is a terrible call
"This was a terrible challenge, I bet Greg Roman told Harbaugh to do this"
"Fuck off all u haters with the ""dumb challenge "" shit"
Fuck. You.  Worst call in NFL HISTORY.   EAT SHIT.
Steelers and colts fans are losers. Two straight weeks of whining
I wanna see a Dez catch or TD!
Boy that closeup looked like he was convulsing wtf
Looks like time for a new conditioning coach
No dez :(
Bonds is worthless.
gimmick bullshit offense.
Everything they‚Äôve said about Lamar‚Äôs throwing is ending up being right. This dude can‚Äôt throw for shit this year
What a fucking joke. That is proof Lamar just isn't what he was last season and these guys don't fear him at all.
I'm fucking done
This is not our year
Boy we got real bad this year :(
Wtf is this challenge
Harbaugh has had a lot of dumb challenges in his career but that might be the dumbest.
I hate to see people hurt. But Leonard has been killing us the whole game.
"This second announcer is annoying as fuck

such a goober, who put this dude on tv"
"Half of y‚Äôall would not have made it through the Boller era had u been here , calm down"
Bad throw but gotta catch it
Where the fuck are the 15+ yard passes?!?!
"Greg Roman is a fucking moron and we have no OL. We're looking at 2nd or 3ed in the division if we can't get shit going. 

Lamar has seriously regressed. He doesn't set his feet, he has no quick reads and to make matters worse we have God awful leverage in the interior OL.

Skura is terrible, and we never bothered to find heir apparent for RG (which I mentioned in 2017/2018 discussions about the draft. This game is won in trenches, if you give a QB time they make plays. We give opposing QBs time that our QB needs. Damn shame"
Team bailing out Lamar.
i am really getting sick of watching our defense give up consecutive 3rd down plays week in and week out. they need to fix that or bring in people that will actually fucking play.
What a dirty fucking hit wow
Today is the day Hollywood Brown finally goes off
"White jerseys, purple pants today"
Does Dez see the field today?
What kind of drop off can we expect with Fort out?
This can either be a breakout game for dez and he can establish himself in the offense or he‚Äôs going to leave us scratching our head thinking what we‚Äôre we thinking signing a old WR...
I got in on y'all at -110. Am I missing something bc that seems like easy money
Khalil Dorsey yay
"Who will take the FRUIT PUNCH today with Marlon out?

Elliot?"
Come on boys we need this to bounce back
Hollywood will get the first TD of the game.
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
"**""BURGER!""**

**EDIT**: Ah, no! Campbell is down."
Welp.   Time to start drinking again
At least he‚Äôs walking
This is definitely not our year.
"If he‚Äôs out, we‚Äôre fucked"
Walk it off Calais
"Fuck man, we're cursed these last couple of weeks."
Oh no
NO WHAT THE FUCK
God dammit
Calais plz get upüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Hoping it‚Äôs just a cramp
Calais looks like he‚Äôs talking about the way his leg moved to the trainers.  Like he twisted something.
Is cambell ok??
goddamnit...
nice stop good shit
ah fuck
Good job
Great stop D! Hell yeah
I like how Chris board has been playing
Jackson to Bryant for a 20 yard gain plz
I seriously thought Proche was going to try to pick that up.
"Lets go Lamar, show them who you are."
Good decision making Proche
Those hurdles rarely work
Boyle was hurdling when andrews was still in college nice try tho charles
Snead looked open no
Let‚Äôs go offence
üòë
Oy vey
Dorsey is hurt now too..
Bleh was hoping we'd actually come out with some type of a decent drive.
This offense better not waste a good defensive performance again.
We have 3 healthy corners thank god for the swiss army knife levine.
Are Frank Reich and harbs related?
"Screen tears us up, what a surprise"
McStuffed
Thats textbook edge setting goddamn
This front is doing good against that Colts OL
Looks like Wilkins struck McPhee‚Äôs helmet. That should‚Äôve been a penalty.
Missin that fruit punch
"Ugh, we need a turnover here"
This was less than ideal
üéµHow could this happen to me üéµ
Were gonna live in die by our pass rush today
1 possession game let‚Äôs go match that then it‚Äôs 0-0 again
I said it two weeks ago - this is not a top 5 team with the Offense the way it is. Now we‚Äôre facing good teams while in transition. It‚Äôs not a good situation.
Maybe bonds will improve But right now he is dog shit. Three of our top corners are out. We‚Äôre going to get fucked
"Alright boys, go light these mofos up"
Let‚Äôs go Dez
Wellp we're down 7 better not run the ball for the next 8 drives in a row
I got a real bad feeling about this...
Well defense is getting gashed as expected let‚Äôs hope the offense can do something. That 3rd down option was god awful so I‚Äôm hoping roman can actually call something good
"I knew that even if the guys on the COVID list played they‚Äôd struggle, and the guys who were in practice like Campbell, Ngakoue and Peters were going to have to dominate for us to win. If Campbell doesn‚Äôt come back this game is over"
"just tuning in now, did I miss anything?"
Lol this is just sad
Yoooo this is a joke right??
:(
Disaster waiting to happen
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
God bless JK
Man o man
double pa screen?
Fuck with that much misdirection I would like to go downfield
Dobbins is incredible
There's our weekly screen play
Tight end wildcat trick play
"DEZ 
Edit: nvrmnd"
Okay let's be honest a quick out is awesome even if its basic for the rest of the NFL
#Put Dez in
Dez on the field
Damn they saw right through that Dez decoy
keep the quick passes coming
This center is going to give me a heart attack
Holy fuck we saw the same thing against Pitt last week they are just living in the backfield
How good is Hollywood at run-blocking?
DEZ SIGHTING
LFG
Great throw and route. Lets see more of that.
Just woke up... what did I miss?
At least it wasn't a 3 and out!
"The Laker fans bullied their bench players into playing good, maybe we can do the same? Idk"
Zero offense zero defense....... sigh.
D not helping either
"streams are extremely shitty today, but it's ok if the team's playing this bad again"
OH SHIT
Ok how about we double whoever Bonds is on with a safety?
Caught by whoever is being guarded by Bonds.
Rivers throwing at bonds every time
They got so lucky
CHUCK SIIUUUUUUU
"week in, week out, i love our defense so much"
Fuck you Phillip
Danger danger
Bonds is getting ripped to shreds today
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOO
"Ok, we take those."
Please be a fumble
Now that was a good hurdle!!
WOOOOOOOOO
BAILED OUT.
Spoke too soon
Get burns outta there
TD LETS GO
#THE STREAK CONTINUES
WHAT JUST HAPPENED
Literally just tuned in TOUCHDOWN BALTIMORE üòàüòàüòàüòàüòà
That‚Äôs my Hokie!!
"Pittman is a good receiver, that's the matchup they're gonna target all game. Dude was arguably a first round wideout"
should stand!
NEW BALL GAME
We're back in this game! Bless u ChuckClark
Wow!   Nice run back on the fumble!
Chuck
LMFAO üòÇüòÇ rivers
NICE
Huge
HELL YES!!!
"Rivers got into his wife's defensive position, and it was just as effective..."
Taylor focused too much on trying to put a hit on Peters and coughed it up. Lol
hell yeah baby. Lets gooo
Let‚Äôs go defence hit em in the mouth
"Fruit Punch Juice, kings of the punch out..."
good angles by defense..ugh
that commercial got me
Can‚Äôt contain the left side of the field. McPhee playing Right and Peters on Left make it an easy choice
Ughhhh that would have been nice
Terrible pass coverage.
I see why bonds plays DB and not receiver
Rivers mad he couldn‚Äôt get the penalty yards. Need to put some pads into him.
Damn that would have been such a cool looking INT
Bonds is a ducking spaz lmao
"Fucking catch that, Barry Bonds!"
UGHHHHHH
BONDS COME ON BRO
If that‚Äôs not enough evidence to cut bonds idk what is
Lol
Extra men on the field again???? Why do we do this so often.
Uuuuuuuuuuuuugh
The disrespect
WR smacked it on his way out
0 rush yards lol
Nice play Lamar
Play our game and run the ball. Get something going and we can set up the pass
Did he say Kenny moore made the tackle
Zone-read <3
Feeling this offense now.
I‚Äôm loving how we are attacking the flats.
[removed]
What in the world
Flucker got pancaked
Fluker gets blown up and causes that failed play
Frauds
See what happens when we run the ball more.
Man getting one first down seems to be our offensive ceiling so far
"Why do we run lamar up the middle. We lost one of the best tackles in the league, let him race them to the sideline or something if you must run him"
Zero fucking offense... Tucker isnt going to get us a SB let alone wins. This is embarrassing
We might need to try something else on 3rd.
Blow the offense up
That option shit needs to be over.
I like running different type of plays just not getting the blocking
Offense just looks uninspired
never thought this thread would look like this last season
"It‚Äôs like Greg Roman has personal beef with Lamar and wants him to look bad, this is embarrassing. Run formations that have a running back in the backfield!!"
At this point why not let Lamar and the offense call plays?
I just see no desire in Jackson's eyes lately. That sideline shit just reminded. It's like there is no competitive drive like he's had in the past
We need to revamp the IOL and the WR position ASAP
There's NO WAY that the players aren't souring on Greg Roman. They used their voice to get Earl Thomas out. Do it again.
Lol We need to pick a guard in 1st round but we‚Äôll end drafting Etienne
How are we boys? I had to go to Whataburger real quick. Left right after fumble 6.
I think defenses have just figured out we've ripped every page out of the playback w a pass 10yds plus in the air.
I trust this defense to win this game for us than the offense...
Offense can‚Äôt maintain blocks. Defense can‚Äôt get off of them. Awesome.
another hold so tired of nfl reffing
Ngakoue!!
Anybody else thinking Lamar has been dealing with some nagging injury since he took that nasty hit in Week 2?
Is Judon playing?
I could literally play wr for the ravens no talent needed
I like the screens and dump offs. I do not like the lack of our downhill run game. Maybe I have a short memory but we have not ran up tue gut but twice. Maybe our oline is getting beat up and GRo unwilling.
Lol they're using screens like Reid and KC.
"god if we don't draft Rashod Bateman with our first this year, imma be fuming"
Has Dez played yet? Just remembered he was back for this game
"Souljas, plz"
Anyone else feel it‚Äôs still too early for all the holidays stuff?  My neighbors are putting their decorations up as we speak and now they‚Äôve had commercials for holiday stuff
We need to rip them now and get an offensive score before the half
these weird plays where they run 4 yard routes are killing me
Screen passes all day huh?
This awful
We suck
Fucking brutal
First good throw I‚Äôve seen.
fucking finally a shot down field
More throws like that...please
Can we all agree at least that the camera work by cbs is absolute shit today?
Have we crossed midfield yet this game?
There you go llama
Finally!
Lets go
Needs to get his head in the game. Looks uninterested lol
this is difficult to watch to say the least
3 WR just went straight vertical lol these play designs are amazing
Threading the needle
I want to see other plays besides seam route or curl to Andrews. We need WRs involved beyond the sticks. Nice throw though
He's ALIVE!
"Oh, we are the pretenders"
"We did something.

AND LAMAR CAN MAKE THESE THROWS AND HAS MADE THESE THROWS PRETTY WELL, SO WHY THE FUCK DOES ROMAN NOT WANT TO CALL THEM?"
"Are they scared of our o-line or what? End-around, screens, makes me think they are"
"There you go, throw on the money...of the issues are execution related"
Miscue on the snap??? Shocking
Really nice throw by Lamar there
clock will start on the SNACK
"I was hoping they would go to Andrews there - credit to Lamar for putting it in there, Mark needs to get more involved and they need to draw up more plays like that."
I was CERTAIN this drive was over the moment Lamar threw incomplete on 1st down. Glad to be proven wrong.
Great goddamn throw Lamar
Every read is triple covered
We‚Äôre horrible
And come crashing back down to earth
shoulda been picked
How df do u throw that
Lucky as fuck that wasn't an INT
And then a should-be INT
What's that explanation
This is not a relaxing way to spend my afternoon
Man...this couldn't be more different from last year
Why are we abandoning the run already
What kind of sorry ass route was that
Lamar bro you gotta slide feet first
NO!!!!! COME TF ON
"Lamar is missing reads and I don't know why. He's missed some wide open receivers this game,  but he's not as rushed as last week.  O-line doing better in pass protection than last week."
We‚Äôve now reached the ‚Äúforce it to Hollywood‚Äù stage of Ravens play
Forcing the throw. Stop throwing forced throws.
Oh my... dude.
Man the offense manages to somehow look worse. Just wild.
Marcus Peters needs to take a chill pill
WTF lamar get your head in the game man.  This isn't going to help.  The defense can't bail you out for all these misreads.  I swear he gets in his head sometimes and loses focus.
We literally give away first down every time.
Steelers did the same shit against Lamar last week
He lowered the helmet crazy
This play calling is dog shit
This looks worse then the 2014 offense.
That's the Clowney tackle right there.
At least the refs are trying their best guys
lol the line getting destroyed immediately after the snap
"Penalties extending drive. We playing Pittsburgh ball now, boys!"
Blackmon been watching game footage of Minkah Fitzpatrick.
Oh that's a greasy hit - we can't be having too many of those or it'll be RG3 time.
God I love JuiceMan
"can we stop running up the middle, its just not working."
"MP gotta chill, though I love that he loves his guys.

This offense should not look this bad"
"Who cares if Dobbins goes down there holy shit, 0 holes"
God I love Peters. Perfect Raven.
Hope that penalty gets us mad and wakes us up.
Lol. RB gets the handoff and the oline is like 2 inches in front of him
That dude wasn‚Äôt even blocked. Wtf
Lamar wtf
WTF
"Holy

Fucking

Shit"
damn
Let‚Äôs run backwards now
Trace McSorely wya /s
We are fucking double teaming and STILL can't stop the rushers
Jesus fuck
Offensive line is getting pantsed today. That wasn't even a a blitz.
Nice job getting us out of FG range bruh. Real heads up play
Dobbins just giving the block up
Nice protection form Offensive Line
FUCK
Madden curse
How tf is Lamar putting himself into contact you if he doesn‚Äôt duck he‚Äôs taking a full on head shot. Shut the fuck up
"What is it, 3rd and 40?"
"lmfao 2 penalties on us, at least the defense gets to rest while they watch this debacle"
Throw. It. Away.
Jesus fucking Christ.
We take holding penalties and still can‚Äôt pass protect
This Offense is just an empty husk of last year's offense.
That was another screen. #5? They don‚Äôt believe Lamar can do anything with his arm
Smart to get it out quick so we can have a better position to punt the ball from.
"Biscotti please, step in and do something."
This is so painful.
this Oline is so atrocious right now. jesus fuck.
Have we run yet
Fire Greg Roman immediately!
Need short throw plays. Please Roman. Our offensive line sucks and Hollywood doesnt need to run a go route every play.
And now we give up running the ball
So I guess our offense is busy taking instagram pics and playing warzone when they should be practicing
That would have been so clutch
Who‚Äôs the interim OC if Roman goes? Culley?
At least last week the whole offense other than 1 player looked really good. This week it all looks like shit.
That made me jump off my seat lol
Flag
our offensive line is getting so little push idk how anyone expects us to run or pass. we need tempo or something to mix it up
whyyy Judon !
Are you kidding me
Guess we lean on the defense like ol' times.
Judon again..
Judon a meme
Sure I guess
Two penalties in one play! Awesome job team!
Lmfao
Omfg....
OH COME ON.
Awesome. Have the pinned and he jumps offside. Can‚Äôt wait to wave goodbye to him.
Fuck man.  Can't catch a break.
"That fucking hurts, both Rivers and the Ravens"
I want to cry
And now we collapse and watch them march 90 yds for a TD... sigh
Both those penalties were on McPhee not Judon?
On track for another record setting penalty day.
Somehow these coaches have made this team worse than the sum of its parts.
Such bad discipline why are we getting these stupid ass defensive penalties every week
soft
The lack of discipline is disgusting
"He was so wide open, smh"
Corners playing way to softly
Hold them to a FG here.  Go to the locker room only down by 3 and re group
Someone needs to make that face that Rivers made into a meme
Wish they'd show the replay on some of these tackles. That one by Ferguson and the one by Wolfe earlier looked like they just reached out and grabbed the player and that was enough to stop them
Remember to keep the compliments coming as fast as you do the insults...
Their LT has consistently put his hands in the rushers face
Oh we lucky if Elliot isn't ejected. And that was a DPI
Idk I've ever seen a guy out there with glasses on
Weren‚Äôt like 3 colts players not set and moving before the snap on the 3rd down play?
Elliot needs to go for the ball. He didn't lower his shoulder until well after tip.
Who's the blame of the game so far?
ANOTHER screen. The fuck is this
Kinda deep now to make anything happen before half.
We're inside our own 10 to start... wtf
on track for another 10+ penalties vs 2-3 for us
Sigh...
Standard. Take a knee.
This offenseüò¥üò¥üò¥ and brain dead penalties
Seriously.... This has to be coaching. We can't be losing or almost losing games because of penalties.
There kicker has been damn good for them so far making 16/18.  He was the top Kicker prospect coming out for the 2020 draft and I was honestly so surprised a team didn‚Äôt take a late round flier.  I get why though because there hasn‚Äôt been a kicker that didn‚Äôt bust since Seabass.
Just kneel the fucking ball. Why even try?
KNEEL IT OUT.
The colts marched from their 10 can we do the same?
wtf is wrong with this team.
O-line is baaaaaaad.
We just do not look like a well coached team.
Im so fucking sad dammit
Slant for a first down look at that
That was loud how'd he stay up
Let's get another fumble for a TD here
I would like our offense that could march down the field at will and go on 10 minute drives back please
INT return TD please
Lol
Shitty first half
Another fucking flag. Jfc
Lol
"Oh no, we suck again..."
And it wasn't a fucking sack tho
Hope we have some damn good halftime adjustments.
"Hat forward, he learned"
Is RussellStreetReport down for anyone else??
Feels bad man
Did dez play yet late watching so happy for him
"Lamar has 2 seconds, first down."
Holy Shit a completed pass
#P A S S I N G
Okay let‚Äôs keep this damn pace up
"Ok, whatever adjustments got made at the half look good on this drive."
Finally
We‚Äôre the only Franchise in the NFL that never gets their QB a true number 1 WR lol
Setting up their spies with slants??
BOOM BOOM LAMAR IS IN THE ROOM
That's more fucking like it
That was weird
We back from the dead like Chief Keef!!!
Looks like they gave quite the pep talk at half
Why not go deep it's 2nd and 1
"Remember the 2012 playoffgame against Pats when Harbs said at half they decided to put the ball in Lamar's hands? I feel like this could be a similar watershed type moment

Edit whoops of course I mean Joseph Vincent Flacco"
Lamar can throw to receivers?
We made yards
"Lamar isn‚Äôt the type of QB that‚Äôs gonna launch one downfield , wish we would use this intermediate game more"
Wow offense looks awake now
THATS MY MVP
Look guys we're doing something!
Where was this 1st half?!??
"Running the ball?

Roman : FUCK YOU PASS IT"
And you keep letting him throw downfield! Nice catch Mark. Fucking GRo.
FOUR RUSHES WITH RUNNING BACKS??????????? WHAT THE FUCK????
Here we fucking go
That's not lamar on the field
"Let‚Äôs go boys, we‚Äôre moving that ball"
See what happens when you call normal ass pass plays with no pa
Nice catch!
Someone entered a cheat code during halftime (aka they all got reamed the fuck out lol)
"I still don't like Roman, but he made adjustments. It's a step."
Has the offense just officially woken up?
ITS HAPPENING
"Oh hey look, Lamar is faster than most people on the field. It works when he races them to the sideline. 

G-Ro: Qb sneak up the middle"
"We have the personnel, this is what we needed"
Pa pass to dez td coming up
Holy shit they had Jackson run on the outside?
THROW IT TO DEZ
You can‚Äôt spell red zone without Dez
">Lift up the **receiver**, I'll make you a believer

*Depeche Mode: Personal Jesus*"
"Lol, we were hustling Indy the entire first half"
NOOI
"Uh... wtf is happening? I'm NOT complaining because our offense is looking lively now. 

But we deadass look like a completely different team from the 1st half."
Ravens have more first downs in 3 minutes than the entire first half
For fucks sake.
Wow.
Kill me
Lmao dawg come tf on
No words
Jesus shit
sigh...
Gus needs to sell that fake better.
... *sigh*...
Bus üò•
Thanks Mecari for nothing
Judt what we needed
Wow that was the post painful play of the season
imagine not holding onto the ball on the goal line
When it rains it pours
Oh my god
Crushing.
dobbins should get every rb touch from now on
And just like that hopes are dashed
lmao this shit is brutal man...
What a tease lmfao
Just stomp on my dick while you're at it. Fuck
Props to hollywood saving the td
MP come on
JFC MP
Wow
oh
Big Truzz. I have hope
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDIGNKSAMFV DK
Juiceman almost took it right back
That‚Äôs fucking OPI
FADE ME
Fucking kill me
Lol. Just. Lol.
"..........

WHYYYYYY"
Why did you not let him come down with that Deshon
OMG
This game is such a cocktease
are you actually kidding me?
Bro why are we challenging this
Fucking embarassment
Borderline fumble
Catch n fumble lol
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
what is this challenge
[deleted]
wtf
Why do this
guess we are in fuck it why not mode
No replay cbs????
Marcus ... :(
Fuckkkkkk
Pls reverse it
That‚Äôs a stupid challenge
no way they change this
I don't think they are going to reverse that. He did t make a football move IMO
That would be a challenge of an int right?
What a dumb challenge
Who made this call to challenge? Whoever it was needs to be demoted.
Why does Harbaugh sometimes just challenge when he doesn't like what happened even when it's obvious?
"One step forward, three steps back"
Ik the fumble sucked the air out of the room but at least the offense didn‚Äôt look totally inept
OH SHIT
*Has vietnam flashbacks to the infamous 5-11 season in 2015*
WOW
Wow I was wrong LFG
Brilliant
YES
YOOOOOO
Let‚Äôs go
LETS GO
WOW
FINALLY THE REFS DONT FUCK US OVER
Does harbaugh ctually expect that to get overturned? I don‚Äôt understand the thought process. Timeouts are very valuable in close games and he is giving them away
Oh shit
Let's get y'all started again. Lamar Jackson is terrible. Reminds me of a hyped of Geno Smith or Josh Freeman. I'm glad we have a real passer like Dak. Poor Dez.
OMG WE GOT IT BACK
No fucking way
üò±üò±üò±
bAD ChAlLENge HArBAugh
#OH SHIT
Called it.
LETS GOOOOOOOO
LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO. Harbaugh you wizard!
What? Lol
Well that‚Äôs lucky lol
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA
Wow... üëç
Hahahahahahhahah
HOLY FUCK THATS MY COACH
WHAAAAAAAT
What
Does Peters get credit for an interception there?
#LFG
"Damn, okay Harbs."
sure?
Holy fuck
Hell yeah
Each and every one of you can eat your words
Wow wow wow
lmao
Eating more crow I guess belly full
"Hell of a challenge. Love Harbaugh‚Äôs guts there, Peters definitely had the ball long enough. Refs should‚Äôve blown the whistle."
Learn football guys lmao
Well that's a complete horseshit call üòÇüòÇ
Lol idk man that's not a good call
I dont understand that what so ever
HOLY FUCKING HARBALLS
This dude has no idea what the catch rule is. Going to the ground isn't a part of the rules anymore. Hasn't been for 3 seasons
Big Brain Harbs!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Jackson is looking a little more into it this half it seems
Peculiar call üßê
???
Harbaugh playing 4D chess rn
Soulja
LMAO I‚Äôll take it
LOOK AT THAT PROTECTION LINE IS BACK BABY
Hollywood taking a hit there.
"We‚Äôre fine. We got momentum in that last drive, and we‚Äôre moving the ball. The fumble was unfortunate but it‚Äôs not indicative of the offense"
Let's go Hollywood!! BIG DAWG WOO WOO
If I was an indy fan I would be livid right now
Does no one else see that limp when Lamar is going slow or am I crazy
I guess the passing game is alive now! Let‚Äôs go
Has Dez got a reception yet? Just now tuning in.
that was a strike
Wow Darius Leonard their best player defensively
Charles Davis is suck deez with that no catch nonsense......
"M V P

V

P"
Andrews rey fight lmaoo
Finally! 3rd and 1 just pound it nothing stupid
We already have twice as many yards and first downs this half than we did in the first half.
EJECT THAT FUCKER
Glad to see some fight in this team. It helps to actually have some structure
No no no we need 3 if we get to 4th
Gus Edwards is a Mack truck!
"I'm waiting for those three magic words

ANDREWS... REDZONE.... TOUCHDOWN!!!"
Lamar draw and get stuffed here watch
lets go gus!
PUT DEZ IN
Let's get my boy Ricard a TD here in the flat
leave the ball in lamars
I think we would take our 3 right?
He def got in.
Colts are a bunch of cry babies
Wow no qb sneak and it works
Does Harbaugh just know the rules so well that he knew to challenge that questionable INT?
Umm what???
Lol
TD
He‚Äôs in
Thank god
Gus Bus!
FINALLY!
Why tf don‚Äôt they just count it since scoring is reviewable
Mekaro just prevented a td there he was way out past where he should and forced the bus outside
That‚Äôs an example. Refs gave a TD to them earlier in the same fucking situation.
"Glad we didn't challenge, good initiative to go for it. Still worried but at least we're seeing something on offense, I may have been a bit too defeatist after the last turnover"
LETS GO!
It‚Äôs pretty sad that Gus Edwards has been our offensive MVP of the year so far lmao fucking love that guy
GUS BUS!
Boom!
Ricard is a grown ass man
Our curse will extend into the second half... unless...
Wtf was that throw by Rivers
bears with a screen 7 yards behind LOS
HELL YEA D
I‚Äôm actually feeling confident about this game now
Our number one rushing offense forgot that running the football is an option
"Credit to Lamar, his spidey sense is good."
He juked himself out
Pass pro looking pretty solid right now
If the OL were like last year a 4 man rush doesn‚Äôt stop Lamar.
Go for it
Feel like that spot sucks
Prayers to Indy they had a fuck ton of injuries this game
what kind of spot is that?
Go for it
Why does Lamar always look miserable lol
ANALYTICS
Gotta love how we‚Äôre just casually trotting subs in with 12 left on the play clock
Why even hesitate...
Please don‚Äôt do a qb run up the middle
If he had hit the drag route that would've been a first down
"That was horrible. You get lined up at least you can try to get them to jump. 

I want a play action pass."
Should‚Äôve had someone flop. Get the free break.
"Love the commercial, hate the new coffee machines.   Its like the coffee comes out too foamy or something idk"
I still the last few weeks and the first half here shows GRo needs to go.
I will never get used to a RTJ song being used to sell cars
I wanna see Dez throw up the X so bad
Hollywood got open after Lamar was running to the opposite sideline
So like... Our offense is competent again?
Can we please get a new center next year?
Tale of two halves. We look like a different team and Llama looks confident
Honestly think Colts defense blew their load in the first half. They were running with such speed and intensity now they are tuckered out
bozeman gets absolutely destroyed
Let's get 6 mannnnnn
The Boot!! Love it
Love that shit bitches
YAAAAASS QUEEN
Touchdown!!
"That second half swing, finally we are doing it"
Hes back baby!
LAMAR IS SNEAKY AGAIN!
The streak continues!
This is so much more like it
It feels good it feels real good seeing this offense work
Harbs must have told Lamar to just be himself and have fun. He looks like the mvp right now
That was a really great block by Mark Andrews on Lamar Jackson's TD run. He absolutely mauled his assignment all the way into the endzone!
"What a classic bootleg, amazing"
PQ trying to turn into a thumper
How did we leave him so open?
Fumbles happen Reich not using your best offensive weapon is just helping us you idiot
Fuck
Great
Bruh c‚Äômon
Right on the chin
Just hold them to 3
Is that a shoulder injury?
"Why, what have we done to deserve this üòñ"
"We‚Äôre now leading 9th team overall with most
injuries this season."
Pick Defense
[deleted]
What happened with Queen? (Had to step away for a bit)
Ain't get it
Nice
"Fucked his ass up, let's go"
Thank you Judon
Hand to the face ü§≠
What's up with Calais
Did they say what happened to Queen?
Woooow that was a touchdown if judon missed a half step.
"Ok, 5 minute drive and let's go home."
Love this defense
Wind that clock down
IN YOUR FACE RIVERS!!!
i want harb's mask
Wtf was that
Time to grind their souls into the ground with the Gus Bus
Ew
Sam Koch fake in coming
We shouldve let lamar play his game and get us that first down
How is Indy out of TOs??
What‚Äôs old man Rivers crying about. Get yo sorry ass back there and throw a pick
This was a quick one imo
Is it against the rules to throw a pass when the games in the bag?
HE DONT MISS
Would like to do at least 1 or 2 playaction to change it up
Fuck it lets get the ball back and run up the score even more!!!!!
Tuuuuck
16 forced fumbles?? that can't be right
Anyone know how good Colts' rush D is?  I'm curious.
" 
 

 My"
[deleted]
Imagine being comftorable with giving Lamar an extension of any kind at this rate.
[deleted]
Colts look like what we used to
[deleted]
"Somehow this is all Greg Romans fault. I blame every blown coverage, every penalty on him, & my broken spirit on him."
Lamar's been playing kinda bad ever since I bought my Lamar Jackson Funko Pop last Sunday morning lol
"Yeah, I'm switching to Redzone.

This offense is just miserable to watch."
That is 100% a catch and fumble
#Rivers going for 300 and 3 tds today
All because marlon Humphrey had to go out and eat with friends ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Get Hill off this team. No purpose for him anymore.
"Josh Allen is a better QB right now because their team is letting him get better and throw the ball continuously. 

We shit on Flacco by getting him no weapons and we‚Äôre shitting on Lamar by not letting him grow. Lamar can be a top 10 passer every season if we let him"
So we just not going to adjust today
Just woke up but nothing looks good so far dammit
Fuck this shit man. Lamar just isn't the gamechanger he was last season. We are so screwed.
What happened to Lamar
We might as well have Kyle Boller rn
"We basically have an elusive, faster Joe Flacco making boneheaded decisions under pressure."
Lamar really likes running into sacks when things don't go perfectly this season :(
Can anyone put a finger on what‚Äôs wrong with Lamar this season?
When do we start the 'Harbuagh has lost this team' threads?
Oh shut up the hit on Sneed was way worse
"Indy‚Äôs D been headhunting our offense and hitting Lamar every play. They gotta expect the same.

The refs need to start calling these penalties or it‚Äôll only get worse."
Boring team LMAO
This offense is broken
STOP RUNNING THE FUCKING BALL
After that atrocious first half we kinda look good I guess
Never seen Lamar look so average there.
"‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå

‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå‚ùå"
"I don't have the highest hopes. 

I think we CAN win, but it is going to take a lot of things to go right for us and some things to go wrong for Indy."
This is going to get ugly soon
Hollywood really didn‚Äôt complete that pass smh. Easy shit man
this is a wrap
Can they sprinkle some deer antler stuff on calais‚Äô calf?
God of War 4 prequel
"Hey wink they keep attacking us on the outside how about we adjust? 
Wink: Naw buddy we good"
9 first downs already
Bonds fucking sucks
"Damn man, where all these souljas at?"
Unbelievable. Throw something other than a dump off you bum
Holy shit this offense sucks. I can't believe the team is ok with this play calling
What happened to our offense and what has happened to Lamar?
Awful pass
Jackson has regressed to first year college QB this year
THESE PENALTIES ARE RIDICULOUS HARBAUGH GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER
Roman calling short passes because of the oline
"Honestly, at what point is this on Harbaugh as well for not realizing Greg is ruining Lamar? And looking to actually get this offense to do something?"
Lamar staring off into the abyss. Sigh
Who do you all propose we replace Roman with? Not gonna find anyone decent midseason
Damn they folded him like a cheap suit
Lamar is going to end this game with negative yards at this rate lmao
This offense stinks and it starts with Lamar and Roman
S/pain
"Some thoughts so far:

- this has been a fucking awful game
- the announcers talking about their luggage for 5 minutes almost gave me a fucking aneurysm 

-Gus is maybe the least elusive RB ive ever seen in my life

really not ideal so far"
That‚Äôs the game. You don‚Äôt come back from that
That was a fumble by Peters but alright
How could Lamar let that happen?
This challenge feels like a desperation attempt to switch momentum
Not a catch but okay
"Harbaugh betting on the low IQ of the refs, good shit"
"This has been a historically pathetic offensive stretch for the Ravens... and thats really, really saying something."
Colts fans are big mad in their sub right now ü§≠
We need more shots down the field
Run game is back boys!
This ain‚Äôt a knock on my guy Fort but what sort of finger injury keeps you out for a game? Is the club hand not a thing anymore?
give me a break
The fact that we can't even sack old man rivers is so unreal
The one time judon does something
"Dumb call when you need 1 yard to salt the game. Roman will RPO every down, every situation EXCEPT that, I guess. C'mon, man."
#TBF none of you 300lb couch potatoes could have even got in position to sniff that INT.
Lamar is absolutely figured out this year boys
Get rid of the fucking ball you idiot mother fucker you are costing us points and games.
LAMARG3
Its one thing to suck but I thought this team would at least look pretty good and play fun games doing so. This is closer to Jets football than Chiefs.
We could end up 3rd in the division.
LamaRG3
Why is this team so fucking retarded.
"This team sucks, 5 inflated wins against bad competition"
"lol at this board complaining about the offense.

If you want a better offense...GO GET BETTER OFFENSIVE TALENT.

You guys sit up here and cheer as the Front Office goes defense, defense, defense in the Draft, off season trades, and in season trades...

All while the offense CLEARLY has signs of weaknesses (desperately needs a No. 1 WR and needs OL help) and the complain about the offense not putting up elite numbers against the NFL best defenses.

No, your defense BETTER play lights out or this team is going nowhere...BECAUSE THE OFFENSE IS SO LIMITED WITH TALENT.

The offense is an afterthought."
Nothing is going right today. Lamar couldn‚Äôt even unstrap his helmet coming off on the first try? Anyone else see that shit?
Refs gave them that drive it wasn‚Äôt a roughing the passer.  QBs get too much protection.
thats a terrible hit
[deleted]
turnover or we can pretty much call it
Bad throw tbh
Lamar already peak?
God damb DJ Fluker is ugly as fuck
Rivers had zero pressure that entire drive. This is not a playoff defense. I know it's early but it's not a good start at all
This interior line needs out skura and Bozeman specifically
We aren‚Äôt even looking like a team that should make the wild card rn
Good call
This game should be easy
Why the hell is Judons trash ass covering a TE? Wink has some explaining to do.
When's the last time we saw a WR make a catch that good for the Ravens? Smitty?
Yeah this game over
[deleted]
It turns out there sometimes *are* good calls by NFL refs.
Another fucking game ender that can't be gotten. Just awful
Lamar needs to fucking humble himself Dobbins had that first down just give it to him
"What do you think the chances are this team gets hot the last 3,4 weeks before playoffs?"
Could‚Äôve had DK
This MVP plays like absolute garbage!  I'm piss!
HOW COULD LAMAR DO THIS?!?!?? Loudly exclaims the fan of an already offensively unimpressive team that's missing 3 pro bowl players and 2 starters that it had the year before.
That injury to me looks really fucking concerning.b
[deleted]
We can't just keep hiding Lamar's deficiencies  at throwing the ball downfield. Let's find out right now whether or not we should be looking for a new quarterback in 2021 by making our passing offense more aggressive.
Lamar seriously went from an MVP caliber playing to the worst starting QB in the division
Thats the frustration from McPhee. Has Harbaugh lost the locker room? There is zero discipline game after game after game.
"I‚Äôve seen enough, can‚Äôt watch this team on live TV die a slow death. Literally crumbling before my eyes."
"FUCKIN GREG ROMAN CALLING THE SAME PLAY 3 TIMES IN A ROW!

HE WAS JUST LUCKY OUR GUYS ACTUALLY BLOCKED!

HE SHOULDVE CALLED A BOOTLEG AND TRIED TO TRICK THEM! IDIOT!"
FIRE GUS RHE BUA EDWARDS! DO IT NOW! JUSTIN TUCKER SHOULD HAVE GOT THE TOUCHDOWN BECAUSE GUS FUMBLED! Y'all doo doo comments after Gus made a bad play. Fire Greg Roman not Gus lol.
Already lost
"If this is the level of play the offense takes the rest of the season, there‚Äôs a legitimate case for Lamar MVP-Repeat"
Too many injuries. Not winning this game. Regroup and beat the pats next week.
That is a gut punch to end this game and honestly put a big impact for the rest of the season.
Its Averett time
What. The. Fuck....was that?
"No sir, I don't like it"
Take it easy boys we got this
If hollywood starts to go off by the end of the game y‚Äôall better keep that same energy

HOLY SHIT LETS GO
Fucking killing us on the edge. They're not gonna let our rush get home with these quick plays out there. Gotta try to dare them to throw downfield

Bet money this doesn't pass the qst down marker
finally a good pass
I don‚Äôt think that should‚Äôve a flag. He didn‚Äôt slide feet first
"Lamar doesn know what ""step up in the pocket"" means. This sack is on him"
"Hit Rivers on every fucking play. Their defense it out here headhunting, we need parity at this point."
All afc teams are winning against nfc too

Of fucking course it‚Äôs Judon
Fucking ridiculous.
Jalen Ferguson is a turd for real. Looks lost all the time.
HAHAHAHAHAHA
....... smh
LMAO. This offense is fucking terrible.
Fucking terrible
"Funny enough, there is a persistent coaching decision issue which is running Edwards as our number  1, which is clearly on Harbaugh"
I don't want to see Edwards get another snap.
Depending on the result of the next drive im just gonna turn off the game
I mean he takes 4 steps
Dez caught it.
Hey our plays work better when the blocking execution is good! Neat!
Hollywood was open..
Hollywood was open...
That should do it
Gus fucking earned those last 3 yards there.
Roughing the kicker there???
Can‚Äôt get these first downs.
Why not try to score another td?
Fuck you EA for placing this Madden Curse on us.

A coach with balls would put in RG3 for the second half. This is high school level QB play.
See lamar look at Jacoby he knows how to throw the ball away
#notouryear
RIP to Alex Trepek
"LMFAO.

Is it the playcalling or the execution? Either way -- pathetic. Done with this game for now. Nauseating."
McPhee Mcsucks
Harbs is literally the worse challenge coach. wtf is he doing. Why do they always challenge the worst calls.
This is one of the most embarrassing challenges I've ever seen. I'm speechless.
"Take this tired team. Well deserved, don‚Äôt get me wrong, and we still beat those sorry ass cowboys. FUCK THE STEELERS"
PUT RG3 IN
"Jesus Christ Lamar , just play a clean game and stop being so reckless"
This games gonna be a blowout
Trace McSorely 2nd half leggooo! üòÇ /s
This is not a super bowl caliber team.
Oh look! A straight up pass play and it worked. Dipshit Roman. PASS THE BALL. Let Lamar grow!
Do we have ANY plays from under center?
Lamar needs to make that throw easier and Marquise needs to catch it regardless. Went both ways there.
I'm not looking forward to bootlickers saying that everything is fine and that we're on the right path. This team has no identity or swagger. Especially Hollywood.
This bitch is wearing glasses lol
Harbaugh wtf
Someone explain why you‚Äôd celebrate after you fucking drop an interception you had two hands on
Awful throw.
"Colts fan here, chill out guys, it‚Äôs early."
When is Ngakoue making his debut?
[deleted]
Soooooooo has Yannick done anything yet?
That was the worst call of the season and you know it
Achilles?
This game is not close to over
If this continues the rest of the year a QB is getting taken 2nd round minimum. Too much talent in everything except the WRs to let waste.
[deleted]
Harbs in the hot seat at all?
Trace McSorley time.
Yannick has done... nothing
Will Jackson get a first down this drive?  damn - he sucks now. Would rather have Flacco.
That was an awful play by lamar
"Can‚Äôt wait until I get to see all the ‚Äúwell...Lamar just had his worst game of his career‚Äù for the 5th time this season. I‚Äôm not saying RG3 is a better option but fuck, Lamar just isn‚Äôt in it this year. How many more times are we gonna say ‚Äúworst game of his career‚Äù before we just call it was it is - he‚Äôs having a dreadful season."
"Can we just fire Roman and play RG3

I'm sick of this shit"
"Defense is good, offense is garbage."
"Fuck bad throw well more of a late one

Edit: it should have been caught still late and a little low"
It is probably blasphemy to say this but maybe its time to move on from Harbaugh. Bisciotti nearly fired him two years ago.

He‚Äôs fine.
"Lamar‚Äôs decision making still isn‚Äôt the best, but it‚Äôs not horrible. I also think Gregg Roman is probably putting a lot of pressure on him to play a certain way and Lamar is more of an instinctual kind of player."
The big one for me is the offensive line. Lamar's accuracy has typically been exactly as good as his throwing mechanics/footwork. He's been rushing his mechanics/footwork because the OL has been worse and he's had less time to work with.
"He‚Äôs under more pressure; WRs aren‚Äôt good enough; he isn‚Äôt as effective as a runner, and as a result he‚Äôs trying to do too much and making poor decisions."
"Bad oline, bad wrs, one less quality TE, romans offense has been figured out. It‚Äôs not really all on lamar he‚Äôs definitely played worse but it‚Äôs not exactly a good environmental and supporting cast for a young qb"
"He‚Äôs played as a top 10 QB, not a top 5 QB. He wins games, he doesn‚Äôt turn the ball over that much, and he is just trying to improve his passing. We are 5-2, one of the best Ds in the league, but with a patchwork offensive line and a shaky WR core. We‚Äôre fine."
"It‚Äôs a combination of things. o line isn‚Äôt a good. Play calling isn‚Äôt as good. They are forcing him to become more of a passer, which in theory, this makes sense. In reality, it‚Äôs taking away his game and what made him good. He‚Äôs a better passer when the opportunities to pass develop naturally. Everything feels forced right now which is why nothing is clicking. 

We always say it. Run the damn ball and let the passing game develop organically."
"I think he‚Äôs hurt.  It was reported in training camp a groin injury.  That type of injury doesn‚Äôt heal without weeks of inactivity.  I don‚Äôt think he looks nearly as explosive as last year.  Colts D-lineman just cased him down, that wouldn‚Äôt happen last year."
Not great O-line and bland play calling. G-Ro is driving his Ferrari in 1st gear so far this season
The Colts moving to Indy happened way before I was born so this was more funny than sad. It was a really creative headline though ngl
They are doing a story on it now.
"Continued on Super Bowl Sunday? Geez. Let me guess, they will show how glorious it was for Irsay to move the Colts to Indy and so good for the NFL in the Midwest."

"Alternatively, target someone more than 4 yards downfield"
0 rushing yards in tge first quarter you need to throw the ball.

Why does this offense feel so underwhelming when I went through the Kyle Boller and Flacoo years. Why
Higher expectations
"Ha Flacco always gave you 1 good quarter.  The Flacco model was 1 good quarter, get some points, barely hold on/ lose in last seconds.

Edit:  for this struggling to see, I was clearly making fun of Joe here, not making fun of Lamar.  I never even mentioned Lamar‚Äôs name."

"This is the Ravens offensive output from 2014-2017. It‚Äôs hard to watch and offers nothing. 

Welcome new fans. 

Shit is garbage."
"It‚Äôs a bit of A LOT lmao the o line is getting beat, Lamar isn‚Äôt playing well, the play calling is shit. The plays that worry me are the QBs runs, we got two (3 with justice hill) capable RBs let them run the ball, don‚Äôt risk Lamar getting hurt he‚Äôs been getting hit a lot. The interior of the o line has been struggling all game"
"Is it possible Greg Roman is a master play DESIGNER but an absolute shit show of a play CALLER? That, or is Lamar trying too hard to prove he's a passer? 

I love Lamar and I think he has the goods to beat the Chiefs. But I have serious doubts about Roman and Harbaugh's reluctance to run a 4-down running offense."
"They gotta open up the playbook. I‚Äôm a huge Lamar fan but if Lamar is going to fail , let him fail and vice versa. We don‚Äôt know what we have in him if we just let him throw 5 yard passes every drive like come on, we‚Äôre not beating anybody with this offense lol."
They were waiting until the half guys
The sky is blue. These are things we know.
Play calling is a lot easier when you have actual talent on the offensive line

I really hate throwing blame on a single person... But then I watch kyler running all over the field to the point where Romo claims he might be the biggest running qb threat in the league right now (and even calls out Lamar). Then I get a little sad

"Teams have no fear of an outside game this season. Especially since we are light at TE, seems like having a big bodied guy opposite Hollywood would help create some space for our short-game.

I know he isn't who has was, but he wouldn't be here if he hasn't shown he can run a go/slant.

We don't have a ton of weapons, but it seems like we could be a bit more creative in forcing matchups."

"If I understood this right, I think you‚Äôre saying that JK is work horse RB instead of Gus? (I may have misinterpreted, my bad)

If so I disagree. I don‚Äôt really see JK being like that. I think we shouldn‚Äôt use JK so often as he‚Äôs just a rookie and we shouldn‚Äôt create too much wear and tear on him. 

Gus has proven why he‚Äôs called ‚Äúthe Bus‚Äù, he barrels through defenders and is always reliable in getting those crucial few yards. 

That‚Äôs just my opinion tho"

What a challenge flag by Harbs!
I knew wearing my Peters jersey today was a good move
"The more I watch his int, the more I buy it. He may have great control of the ball, but he's the only one on it before it gets knocked out. Calling it a fumble makes sense, and then we recover. I didn't agree at first, but seeing it more, I think it was the right call."
"Meanwhile if Marlo, for the rest of his career, creates forced fumbles at HALF the pace he has this season, he has a credible chance of cracking the top ten all time for FF... as a fucking cornerback. Everyone else on that list is LB,DL,Edge."
Would be cool but I‚Äôm going to trust the coaching staff on deciding what kind of role he‚Äôs ready to play today.
Just confused as to why we didn‚Äôt have him in the two times we were in the red-zone.
How do y‚Äôall feel about Willie Snead‚Äôs performance these past two games ??
"Mr. Reliable. When everything goes to shit, Willie's still out there making plays."
He‚Äôs playing like he has finally realized his job is on the line.
Plays hard and does what is asked of him. Glad to have him on the team.
He‚Äôs a solid guy but 3rd option at best.
Textbook WR3.
"A lot more positively than earlier in the season. I think he's really figuring out what he needs to do to be successful in the offense this year, and is showing some nice YAC moves.

He's still a WR3, but hes really doing some shit the past few weeks."
Dudes a dawg these past few games when the ball comes his way dude makes plays. Miss his ramen hair doe
"He does his job, not much to say about him. He isn‚Äôt fantastic or anything. Neither Is he bad, he‚Äôs just mediocre."
"I really loved him in 2018, was my favorite player that year. seems like he always fought for every yard especially on 3rd down. last year he kinda dissapeared but the last 2 games he seems to be getting back to that mentality this year"
"When he‚Äôs schemed up, he always comes through. I love that guy."
"I like Snead as a reliable #3 or 4. But when he got caught last week in the open field by a linebacker last week (I believe it was #41), i lost all faith lol."

He's growing and they makes me happy. After the heartbreaking fumble after the drive starting the 3rd, they came out and put another one together. I might be wrong, but this might be there first time Lamar has won a game while trailing at the half. That's growth."

A hard fought win. We need a big win next week to boost our confidence for the Titans game
Give me more offense like the second half
Hats off to Wink and the defense. After a week with little prep and key starters out they still played an amazing game
Anyone else cheering for the best rivalry in the NFL renewed? The undefeated Steelers vs the legendary 2-6 cowboys?
"Credit where credit is due, the coaching staff came out at halftime and had a PERFECT gameplan. Shoutout to Harbaugh and Roman (and Wink was great all day)"
This is a big win MENTALLY. The talk is always about how the Ravens cant come back after being down and they did it and they did it in a dominating fashion. Gus doesnt fumble in the RZ and the score looks even worse.
Now Roman if you can call every game like you called that 2nd half we're going to go far. Please keep that up
WE WON A GAME WE WERE LOSING AT HALFTIME!!!!
1-9 when trailing at the half bitches!!!
"For the past few weeks I've silently been thinking that all this adversity the team's had, between the Chiefs game, the Steelers game, and Lamar's subpar play even in our losses, has been to expose us to adversity that we didn't really face last year. When we won we won by a shit ton last year, and so when we were down we didn't know what to do. 

But this year we've gotten a lot of reps in close games or games where we're down early. and I feel like this game was the first time where we handled that adversity with a ton of poise and prowess. Lamar threw us out of a deficit! That's been his achilles heel since he was drafted and he came out and hung dong in the second half today. Against an elite defense no less. I think that bodes really really well for us. The team that wins the super bowl is never the one that dominates the most, it's the one who knows how to win tough games the most."
Bugs Bunny must‚Äôve gave the halftime speech
"Lamar is back, baby. Ravens in 4."
I hope this Lamar never leaves us again
We came from behind after halftime!
Any word on Campbell?
Colts fan coming in peace. GG. Y‚Äôall played great and we just couldn‚Äôt do anything on offense. Huge fan of Lamar and hope he gets better as the season goes on. Rooting for y‚Äôall if the colts can‚Äôt make it to the playoffs. GG and fuck the Steelers
First time not being in a game thread during the game and I feel so much better than most Sundays
"Everybody turn on the Steelers game!  Steelers getting fucked
Edit:  Actually never mind. They woke up"
What a big win against an AFC opponent
"Gutsy win, I love it. Great bounce back from last week. The defence put their stamp on this win - kept us in the game with two of their best starters out, allowing the offence to get in their rhythm. They stuck in there and made some great plays. Held the Colts to 0 pts in the second half. Our offence, and Lamar specifically, do deserve credit for bringing us back and making second half adjustments. Lamar played better this week, which was encouraging to see, especially against a great defence. They got into a rhythm and tightened things up, proud to see them bring us back. 

Also credit to Harbaugh for having the gall to challenge the potential Peters INT, and to Roman for changing things up in the second half. Big challenge in NE on Sunday night next week."
"Offense had 2019 vibes, awesome adjustments after the half."
"Even if they win, Pitt is getting exposed rn. We should've won that game"
"The Ravens have scored 21 points against the Colts, marking their 31st straight game with 20+ points

That streak is a new NFL record, one more game than the 2012-2014 Broncos - @NFLResearch"
"Another cool stat from this game:

Lamar Jackson has tied former Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino for the best start, 25-5, by a quarterback to begin his career."
Steelers are one of the worst 8-0 teams in recent history. Change my mind. That shit is fucking true.
Was Phillip Rivers really just stat padding? Pathetic.

We beat indy at home for the first time and broke our no comeback from half streak. Today was a good day
That‚Äôs a good defense and Lamar seemed to gain some confidence in the 2nd. Looks looked good passing and when to run

The injuries were killers though. Nothing can be done about them but damn hope Cambell and Queen are ok."

Was just wondering why Dez Bryant wasn‚Äôt in at all while we were in the red-zone which is why I assume we brought him in for?
THE STEELERS ARE LOSING TO THE COWBOYS HAHAHA!!
The offense looked so much better in the 2nd half. It gives me some hope going forward that we could be getting better.
I think we're back. Dominant second half performance after being down against a decent defense.
Can we get more plays like in the 3rd Quarter? Our receivers running slants and drags instead of the usual hooks and out routes every play.
"The fact that I wasn't predicting plays before the snap in the second half is probably a good sign, and they should keep doing that."
"Really thought Rivers was gonna pick apart Bonds, like he did Jimmy Smith in his rookie year but Wink made some adjustments, and the defense played lights out. No Marlon, no Calais, no problem. Let‚Äôs get them back though. Big win, y‚Äôall!"
Phillip Rivers is an even bigger sore loser than Trump
Great win but seriously need to clean up the penalties

Ravens came back better than Biden did with the mail-in ballots! Lmao
"I‚Äôm very happy with this win. Idk if we could go beat the Chiefs or the Steelers but we‚Äôre definitely building back up to that point, and this game is a huge step in that direction."
"So is this a ‚Äúbig game‚Äù? 

I have to admit I was shitting all over this team at the half (rightfully so) but the way we came back honestly means more to me than how we would just steamroll other teams. 

We stopped the streak of being losing 20 straight when being down at the half. For me that makes me excited.

I will still say that Roman needs to go after this year, but WTF happened with the play calling. It‚Äôs like we literally moved the ball at will and looked like the same team we were last year (despite being down our franchise LT)"
22 straight losses when losing by halftime that is absolutely ridiculous.. I‚Äôm hoping our franchise takes from this game and never gives up when we‚Äôre behind and and learns to make halftime adjustments. I‚Äôm not saying we‚Äôre now back in the mix to be contenders because it‚Äôs just 1 game but it sure as hell will if we keep playing like this on both sides of the ball.
I think this was a very important win ‚Äî especially defeating the can‚Äôt come back from behind if down after halftime curse ‚Äî i am excited for next week!
Ben hurt
Such a bail out call for pit against Dallas on that roughing the passer
Looks like the Cowboys are getting a dose of ref ball to hand the Sqealers another win.
It's remarkable how teams trip over themselves when trying to play the Steelers. Including us.
"That 4th and 3 Dobbins conversion felt like a turning point for the season, just like the Lamar 4th down TD vs Seattle last season."
"Lamar Jackson hit a LB so hard, he ended up crying like a bitch. I love it. Also Lamar hit two defenders at the same time. Dude is a beast."
"Mmmmmm 6-2 baby. Colts have a great defense, great second half to turn it up."
Don‚Äôt know what they eat a half but please keep feeding them. What an atrocious first half.
"Glad to see the coaching staff adjust at halftime and come out strong. If not for the Gus fumble the score could‚Äôve been more. The defense did a great job too and didn‚Äôt really let up much after that first quarter. I‚Äôm still shaky on the offense cuz it is a 60 minute game and you can‚Äôt beat the chiefs or steelers in the playoffs when your offense sucks half the game, but I definitely saw steps in the right direction"
"That game reminded me of the second Browns game of last season. What a turnaround.

Hell yes"
"Tale of 2 halves, first half we played like garbage, second half offense woke up and the defense limited them to 1 yard in the 3rd quarter. Still a lot of room for improvement but I see us as a 10-12 win team this year"
"Didn‚Äôt see the game today, how‚Äôd Lamar look? Based on the stat line, looks like mostly short passes?"
"Top 3 Game in the Lamar Jackson-Era.

Staying elite vs. being an outsider to make the playoffs in an extremely strong AFC."
Maybe a start of a trend where we can come back when trailingü§î Lamar played well after halftime
">The Ravens narrowly extended their streak of 100+ yard rushing games, finishing with 110 yards. - @ravens4dummies"
Can we just start playing at a high pace and tempo from the start. Lamar obviously does not play well at a slow pace.
I think the colts like screen passes
Can we stop looking like crap in the first half? This team has so much damn talent but every week it seems like they come out flat.
"i really don't know what changed at half, but we looked like last years team out there."
WTF happened at halftime?
"I couldn‚Äôt watch today because I was working, how did Dez look?"
Kinda sad Dez didn‚Äôt get a catch ngl
Only complaint is we didn‚Äôt get to see Dez.
MVP: 2nd half adjustments
Did Yannick even play today? I dont see his name in the box score.
We did not play that well but the Colts have a good defence and sometimes you just gotta win.
Hopefully this is the game that break the training curse.
"The colts post game thread is hilarious, they complain that the refs gave us the game because of the Peter‚Äôs int which admittedly is a questionable call at best , and the hit on Boyle (which was 100% clean there was no helmet to helmet contact) , as if the refs didn‚Äôt miss a dozen block in back calls on all their screen plays."
"I felt today when we were behind, we played like we were behind by the score we were behind. Before this, it feels like if we go behind by 3, the team (and the play calling) acts like we‚Äôre down by 30. I hope this is the turning point we need for this."
Man I wasn't able to watch the game yesterday but I checked in on the game thread a couple of times and by the way this sub was melting down you would think we were down 60 points.
That second half performance had flashes of last seasons dominance. I would like to see more of that.
This is how good we could've been previous weeks if refs didn't penalise us every 2 seconds. Finally managed to play a clean game and shows what we can really do.
wtf adjustment got made at half for real? did they just full on have somebody else call plays? did lamar just ask to do his thing?
I hate myself for not having and Truss sorry guys
"Guys I feel good.

The defense looked pretty hot all game. The offense really came alive in the second half. Most importantly, we played from behind and won. This could mark some big growth for this team. Feels real good."
Lamar doing what he does best in the second half really helped
"Honest discussion, what did you guys think about the Peters INT?"
What a fun second half! The Ravens are back!
"Great Defensive and offensive game. The 1st half was messy but the adjustments made won us this game. Huge congrats to Lamar on his completion rate, 19/23. The Oline stepped up in the 2nd half and let Lamar be shifty and extend the defense. Pass game looked... Good in the second half, oddly. Dont be put off by JKs statistically dismal game, as he made a few drives. Remember this Colts team is the number 2 rushing defense in the NFL. Thats about it. Mostly covering the bright spots."
"Thank the heavens Roman & Harbaugh made a halftime adjustment for our offense. If we continue to evolve/adjust and LET LAMAR COOK, my heart will be so much less stressed."
How to fix the Ravens offense: Four no-huddle snaps?
I'm most impressed with the way our team bounced back in the second half. Hallmark of a good team fr
I wonder if this will count as a big game lol.
the defense definitely needed a bounce back effort like that. Jackson also coming out of the game clean on turnovers is also good
"Quick question; PFF has Patrick Queen with a 32.2 grade this season, has he actually been that bad?"
"This is the exact win that this team needed but hasn‚Äôt gotten in the Lamar era. After watching this team deflate when they couldn‚Äôt get their game going, it‚Äôs really great to see them adjust, rise to the challenge and ultimately win. Granted the colts have a Philip rivers problem, but this is still the signature win of the season right now against an excellent defense."
"Our OL really needs help. 

Embarrassing seeing the Cowbos running over the steelers even with backup linemen and we struggle so much."
"Still have a lot of concerns about this team

1. The OL isn‚Äôt consistently good enough, which is understandable given Stanley and Yanda being gone. 

2. Lamar has dramatically regressed as a passer, particularly on deep balls (which they don‚Äôt even attempt anymore)

3. Teams have had a year to study film and that, coupled with the ineffective passing game, makes it harder to run. 

Not sure any of this is fixable, but they can probably scheme around it for a while."
We need to use Boykin more. I'm not convinced claypool is any better than Boykin but he draws a flag on what feels like 50% of his targets. Boykin could command the same treatment if he's vocal enough with the refs
Raven games aren't very fun to watch nowadays
"This game felt like a litmus test for both teams -- which one is in the 2nd tier of AFC teams (along with Buffalo, Tennessee) and which is in the third tier (Oakland, Cleveland).  

Ravens, despite a terrible start, were clearly the better team. I think we're firmly a wildcard team, and should probably be the 5th seed. Just need to hope to get hot come that time."
"GG Boys, this win was hard earned especially with all the injuries and lack of Humphrey"
"Fuck the colts, fuck the Irsays. Baltimore forever"
"The Indianapolis professional football franchise 

The only colts I know are the Baltimore Colts"
FUCK BOB IRSAY
"IDPFT

FUCK THE IRSAYS"
"The Colts' true home is in Baltimore.

The franchise that plays in Indianapolis is a cruel mockery of the Baltimore Colts that Johnny Unitas and Raymond Berry played for.

I have nothing against the city of Indianapolis, or football fans who live in that area, but they should have adopted their own names and colors, and built their own history.  It might have been different if no one seemed to care in Baltimore, and the retention of the name and colors was an attempt to preserve history rather than steal it, but Baltimore always cared.  Baltimore still cares.

I still remember the loud standing ovations the Baltimore Colts Marching Band would get at CFL games in Baltimore in 1994 and 1995, more than a decade after the Irsays stole our team.  That CFL team tried to use the name ""Colts"" the first year and predictably got sued, but every time the PA announcer said ""Baltimore CFL"" (Which was technically the team name the first year because of the legal injunction- they were renamed the Stallions in their second year) when announcing the yardage gained on a play or something, 40,000 people (At a CFL game, mind you) would shout ""Colts!"".  Those were the second loudest cheers of the night."
Was pleasantly surprised they called out indy for stealing our history in the pre game show.
"1-6 in indy with losses to Andrew luck, Peyton Manning and Jim Harbaugh. Harbaugh was actually Ray Lewis' first career sack"
That's actually pretty fuckjng crazy
"And a the 1st of 20 games, winning when down from half."
"After all these years, their ownership *still* sucks."
"I always peep the other team's sub (never post) on gameday, it was seriously fucking gross to see how many people have ""Baltimore Colts"" flairs over there. Fuck them forever"

In the first half, I wore a gray Ravens shirt under my customary Willis McGahee jersey.

"**Marcus Peters** for the forced fumble, interception, and being the only corner keeping Rivers from eviscerating this secondary like the Doom Slayer tears through demons."
"Defense

Not only did the defense hold the colts to 10 points against an offense averaging over 30 points a game, but they allowed Lamar to get back to his comfort zone and completely flip the second half. 

Also, fumble recovery for a touchdown and a huge interception."
"Wink Martindale. To hold the Colts down with so many players rotating in and out with injuries, the COVID stuff this week, and a poor offensive showing in the first half is very impressive."

Feel like before he got here would hear bad things about his character, or how he is undisciplined but he's stepped up to be a true leader.

"# Coaching Staff

No idea who in particular, but just the coaches in general. Biggest problem with this team and this staff is far and away lack of adjustments. When we lose, we continue to lose in the same fashion. It's the reason we had 20 straight losses when losing at halftime. We haven't seen the adjustments we saw today. We got the that first win after being down at half. This team can do it now. It's a possibility. Defense was getting used up and they kept the Colts to 1 yard in the 3rd quarter. Offense was getting absolutely nothing done and they started the 3rd quarter with 2 extremely efficient drives. One of which led to a TD and the other should have been a TD if not for Gus' fumble. The changes were seen immediately and they were successful immediately. This is what a good team is supposed to do when they're up against the ropes. 

I'm hoping this is a turning point in the season. I was hoping the losses against KC and Steelers would be turning points. But I think this could be it. This is where we could realize what needs to be done to win."

"**Dez Bryant**

For using his weird catch rule voodoo magic to give us the game turning pick"
I don't think Lamar was necessarily the player of the game but he def deserves some credit
Marcus Peters: gave us key turnovers
Juice
Peters
"Going with John Harbaugh, I would also second the team. There were some change ups and some unexpected injuries we had to deal with come game time. The Defense held tight while our offense got in rhythm and our coaching made adjustments from what Indy was throwing at us.

Indy is a good team and they clearly did their homework against us."
Week 9: JK Dobbins.  He had a monstrous game and showed up Gus by comparison.  So extremely explosive.
"Marcus Peters no doubt, dude forced a key fumble when our O was drunk and he had an INT"

First 2nd half comeback win for lamar!!!
"I‚Äôm honestly pretty hopeful coming out of this game. Coaching staff on both sides made significant changes and adjustments which led to us just rolling 2nd half. Rivers is shit but that recovery by the defense was just amazing. Let‚Äôs hope this can carry on and we can improve tho cuz we can afford to play like shit for a half vs a team like the colts but it‚Äôs not really an option vs a better team, or in the playoffs. We just gotta start putting together more complete games"
"I really get like we just needed to survive this week, and we not only survived but we strung together a dominant half of football against a 5-2 team"

We won.... but at what cost?

"Then again still not all positive, these fucking injuries gonna give me heart attack"
Second half offense was looking like last year. First real sustained offense since probably week 1 this year. Plus it was against a good defense.

Somewhere Dan Marino is posing razor blades over this.
you would never think that if you looked at our sub the last week and a half you ungrateful sons of bitches
"Damn, that Steelers-loss last week hurts. Could have been 26-4, but we had to throw that one away."
And he's also tied Dan Marino for SB wins. Hopefully that'll change
"Today, @Lj_era8 tied Hall of Famer Dan Marino for the most victories (25) in a QB‚Äôs first 30 regular season starts.

Did you not see his last Sportsball video? He made it pretty damn clear he's in yinzer mode going forward...
"Meh he still makes good weekly recap vids and has some decent insights 

At least he isn‚Äôt like that annoying sperglord Eagles fan that yells and wipes his ass with jerseys constantly"
I dont go on Twitter because its cancer but He does have a few yikes takes on there.
"This offense is not the explosive force that it was last year, even though expectations were high to repeat. Why is it wrong to point this out?"
"I prefer chiseled Adonis,  though he's also a squealer..."
"I don‚Äôt get this, did he not watch the game?

"It was about this time last year that Lamar started looking like an MVP candidate and he looked that way in today‚Äôs second half. Last year, Lamar had a great season opener against the dolphins then was pretty lackluster until mid season where a ‚Äúswitch‚Äù seemed to be flipped. This is looking awfully familiar. Hopefully history repeats itself (until the playoffs that is)"
"I‚Äôve said it before and I‚Äôll say it again...this offense will only go as far as roman lets it. Lamar showed us he‚Äôs capable of leading a downfield attack from the pocket, along with doing some scrambling and running. If roman has better designed pass plays that get the ball out to guys in space and gets people open, that frees up the rbs and Lamar to run. If roman decides to revert to first half roman, we are fucked."
"We‚Äôre gonna play some bad defenses over the final 8 games, too. Tenn, Dallas, NYG, Jacksonville, Bengals and Browns"
"2019 games 1-7:

136/213 Passing 63.26% 1650 yards, 11 TDs 5 INTs Rate of 94.1

576 rushing yards, 3 TDs, 4 F, 0 FL

&#x200B;

He's playing worse this year. There's no way around it. He has 7 turnovers to 5 through 7 games, and almost 500 less all purpose yards, and 2 of his INTs in the PIT game last season should have been overturned (one was bc of blatant PI, the other was not a catch). 

&#x200B;

That being said, the playcalling and offensive line are the biggest problems on offense. Roman needs to stick to the basics, and our line needs to step up."

We looked solid without him. Excited about the depth on D

He seemed in decent spirits. Didn‚Äôt look like he thought his season just ended or anything.

Madbuike looked good I thought in his place although definitely not nearly as good.
"He said the same thing about Ingram, but I could see the staff being generally cautious about injuries since we're genuinely playing for January."
We‚Äôll be needing him for Henry next week
Honestly I never trust Harbaugh when talking about injuries. He always down plays them. He said Ingram's injury was serious and he didn't play. he always down plays it.
I don't trust Harbaugh at all when it comes to injury stuff.

So awful yet a masterpiece
Rivers tackling style is very Elam-esque
üòÇüòÇüòÇ I love it
Just looked comfortable and in command the entire half. Made all the throws and was poised. He ran it when he needed to. I can‚Äôt stress this enough... I was REALLY impressed. Especially against a rock solid defense. Hope this can continue in the back half of the year
"Very true. No pass TDs but he was looking accurate af and was handling those botched snaps like a fucking champ 

I‚Äôve only seen Tom Brady handle botched snaps so well"
"The second half looked like all of last season. Downhill running, clutch passes mixed in and a very very tired defense looking defeated."
"His throws outside the numbers were the most impressive to me. He was zipping them out there and hitting guys in stride, and I really believe part of the reason things opened up so much for us was because Darius Leonard began dropping into coverage more to respect that threat."
We leaned pass heavy and it looked great
The first half I was full of dread on every play. The second half I was actually confident. It was a whole other mood on that field.
"This is why I get so annoyed with people saying he regressed. Obviously he‚Äôs not been playing well, but he did not regress. 

Hope he can keep it up from here on out."
Really took a step forward. But I‚Äôm not convinced. How many times this season have we seen flashes of good play then back to the usual bullshit. This was a much more sustained dose of good play. It‚Äôs a start and I hope it carries through.
"Lamar seems to get distracted when the play calls are bad, he gets antsy and tends to panic a bit. Switch the calls to running and short passes and he does much better"
"We looked like ourselves in the 2nd half, the boys were having fun and clicking it was good to see that again. We‚Äôve got the talent and the heart we just need to starting playing the confidence we had in the second half of this game. Also how did we lose to the Steelers when the cowboys nearly beat them today?"
"it helps that play calls were adjusted too, i want Lamar to run less so that the hits don't pile up on him, he shouldn't run more than 10 times a game"

"Ironically, we traded with the Cardinals to draft him lol"
He was on my madden mobile team when I was in 7th grade
Hes still a solid TE. Shouldn't be suprised that hes in the league.
Oh the hype when we drafted him... I remember this sub trying to come up with a nickname for him all off-season long hahaha.
2015 is only 5 years ago.
"I know he did practically nothing today, I saw him block for a single snap, but I couldn't tell if he played any other snaps."
I think it was just that 1 snap
"Saw the whole game, played one snap on a run play, wanted to see more but think they are trying to get him up to speed and maybe just a back up incase someone goes down."

"Sure looks like the \#Ravens took another snap with 10 men on the field (Q1, 4:56)...

They had 2 in ~1200 snaps last year. This would be their 2nd in
~520. Definitely seemed to have trouble with substitutions on both sides this week (I'll blame the Zoom meetings).

Bro why
On a scale of 1 to 10.. how much of an emotional rollercoaster did I miss?
Take a guess
All our game threads are a 10 unless we win 49-0 or something
"It was ridiculous. The 1st half was just people calling for Roman's head. The second half was the complete opposite.

On a scale of 1-10, it was a 9."
"You're not missing out, those game threads aren't healthy at all sometimes"
GRo got fired and hired multiple times.
Yes
"The normal fire GRo, but had some sprinkles of ""not sure lamar is the guy."""
Deep dive followed by a slow but increasing rise up.
"Smart guy. After living in the Steelers game thread last week, I‚Äôve come to realize game threads actually worsen the game day experience for me"
"Exhibit A) the ravens play like absolute shit and come *this close* to winning. 

Exhibit B ) their performance against the Cowboys so far

Change my mind"
How the hell did we lose to this team
Steelers are crafty and figure out a way and always capitalize. Like rats. Got to rise above the rats.
"It‚Äôs obvious the steelers are not the best team, they‚Äôre not even close. They have a good defense but their offense is honestly not good. They needed short fields and turnovers to score on us and they‚Äôre struggling vs the cowgirls who have a putrid defense. I‚Äôm seriously looking forward to this thanksgiving rematch"
"Wouldn‚Äôt say they are garbage, but not remotely close to as good as their record says. They are a 10-6 caliber team taking advantage of an easy schedule. 12-4 is my prediction for them this season."
The worst part is that the Steelers have an incredibly easy schedule now and the only difficult game for them other than us on Thanksgiving is gonna be the bills. Unfortunately (if they don't play down to competition) it's not likely that we win the division this time around unless we win out from this point and the Steelers lose to us and the bills.
Shouldn‚Äôt there have been a 10 sec run off at the end of the half bc the false start?
"I turned the game on for one play, just now, and they scored a TD. So off I go back to not watching football."

"These kinds of posts are dumb.

And it was an interception.  You want simpler catch rules?  Well, there you go."
I have no idea how that was called an interception. The rest of it probably could have gone either way and isn't going to make us think twice because we got screwed on some of those judgement calls last week.
"Interception was dumb, apparently that's the rule but logically it didn't make sense. 

I don't think the hit on Doyle was targeting, there was no lowering of the helmet and the point of contact was across the shoulder. 

Andrews wasn't holding at all lol, that was a textbook block."
"I‚Äôm going to be as honest as possible. The interception was something Ive never seen before. Was it a heads up play to recover the ball after Peters lost it, yes. Was it an interception, I really don‚Äôt think so. The helmet to helmet is bang bang, refs could throw a flag or not. Lastly, holding can be called on EVERY SINGLE play, I think it‚Äôs a bullsh*t call 99% of the time."
"That block was beautiful, he drove him to the endzone, pick coulda gone either way, marcus peters was holding that ball for a while, the doyle play is just football, kinda similar play happened to snead last week, no call. Also what a dumb post, we r ravens fans, what do u think we r gonna say"
"1. It doesn't matter what anyone thinks subjectively about the catch rule in regards to the Peters interception. By rule it was definitely a pick.
2. It was definitely not a flag. A shoulder-to-shoulder hit isn't unnecessary roughness.
3. No Andrews definitely didn't deserve a flag. Some amount of grabbing is present on every single block in the NFL, it's only holding if there's obvious change in direction."
Worst 7-0 team of all time. Don‚Äôt @ me.
No one should be surprised to see the Steelers Underperforming against a bad team
Ben is limping into halftime
""
BruhüíÄ
Dez Bryant has a 100% win record as an active player since injury
Lmaoo
Big facts
Sam Koch is also the most efficient passer in NFL history.
This do be facts
This is exaclty why you have to actually read the articles and not just headlines lol
"I was pretty drunk during the game, did he get many targets or yards?"
"You know, they've never lost a game with me on the active roster either!"
Look at the deeetail.
I‚Äôm throwing it up üôÖüôÖüôÖüôÖüôÖ
It's not not true
"treat him right.  great person.  not sure how much he has left.

good luck to you all."
Love it! So happy for dez. Rooting for you guys the rest of the way!
"Well... yeah, but neither have 30 other teams."
"As a cowboys fan, just...don‚Äôt"

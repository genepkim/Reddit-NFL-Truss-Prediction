i do not fear juju whatsoever hes overrated
wow he stiff armed a former undrafted free agent thats 37 years old lol
imagine grabbing a face mask and calling it a stiff arm
hes becoming more and more annoying
didnt marlon punch one out on him again
remember when marlon humphrey made juju his bitch with that forced fumble recovery to win in ot
i used to like juju at one point i guess the steelers diva culture rubbed off him
lmfao the picture is as clear as day to be a face mask derek henry legit throws grown men outta the way and grabs them by the chest juju straight up grabbed his mask and pulled him down in what way is this a stiff arm
willie better
imagine committing a penalty on the play that benefits you and the refs dont call it then pretending you achieved something without breaking the rules
need some stats to back up this hubris
i mean he cant bring up marlon after he was career highlightreel embarrassed last season
love willie fr

just tell him we will see them in two weeks
because drinking those sweet sweet yinzer tears when patrick mahomes tears their soft defense apart and tyrann matthieu shuts down their gimmick offense will be all the more delicious

obviously id rather us beat them but a steelers meltdown is glorious none the less absolute frauds
exactly the way feel get to the playoffs 160 and get bent over and absolutely ass fucked by mahomes my god im already imagining how great itll be
its gonna be a bloodbath honestly unless of course they dont meet because the steelers get bounced in the divisional
i think we actually matchup really well with the steelers the one thing that really killed the ravens in the chiefs game was having to rely on the blitz mahomes is really good against that due to his postsnap processing and the playmakers especially kelce whos great at adjusting routes to find space

tampa is another blitz reliant team they started out aggressive and we were demolishing them until they started to easy off

what team blitzes the 2nd most in the league pittsburgh all these guys are top 5 in blitzing

what team did we have the most trouble with this year the chargers theyre dead last in blitz rate
i hope the browns beat them in the last game of the season and still miss the playoffs lol
soft defense
nah

thatd feel good in the short term but in the long term itd suck having the steelers go down in the history books with an undefeated regular season before we do
if the team that played us yesterday shows up they dont make it passed the first round which would be actually more satisfying to me
i really dont get this logic im sorry and i love all ravens fans but its so fucking stupid to think this way
sounds like this dusty post needs a sweeping



hyped about beating a jv squad that didnt practice in 2 weeks by 5 points hyped about stiff arming someone which is a clear face mask penalty hyped about stiff arming tramon williams who is almost 40 years old
imagine getting away with an obvious penalty
ive never understood how juju can be so physical against everyone but humphrey marlon takes him to daycare when they matchup
imagine having the lowest yards per catch in the league
juju a douche im glad antonio brown hurt his feelings and made him sad chase claypool too i watched one of his youtube videos and he reminds me of zan from atlanta

diontae johnson and james washington are cool tho
juju wishes he was dk metcalf when hes actually a slightly worse snead
remember pre season when this sub was saying juju was the only steelers player they liked
youre saying that like you did something to a fucking cb from the practice squad you fucking clown
good job juju but tramon is not a real raven hes only been here 2 weeks


if theres no index card it isnt accurate
its to the end of the chain
i went on the steelers sub for a couple minutes just to see what ppl were posting and not to write anything in there

there were at least a half a dozen posts that were literally just screenshots of our sub mocking our posts i dont think ive seen that on this sub at all which is awesome obviously fuck the steelers but come on man were all grown ups here and im happy were able to stay classy and respectful
what are they even mocking about they barely beat us at home with refs help

its like us making fun of them because of that second game that we beat them with rg3
there were at least a half a dozen posts that were literally just screenshots of our sub mocking our posts


what are you talking about theres literally zero posts overs there from our subreddit theres one post called rravens telling everyone to stay away

you dont need to make a false narrative

i guess thats not a face mask anymore
i guess captain insano shows no mercy
seriously i was shouting at the tv during this
funny how he posted this with the caption imagine getting stiff armed 10 yards by a tiktok influencer

sorry juju but youre a mediocre 2 receiver and soon to be free agent stiff arming a 38 year old newlysigned backup corner is nothing to brag about
this was right in front of the ref too that shit was ass the announcer some time im the first quarter circled a holding call thats when we all knew what time it was
refball so sick of this
juju is strong as fuck it always surprises me that one person can not bring him down but fuck him anyways

trace mcsorley throw it on a dime like i aint even tryin just a kid from bryerwood to wearin number 9 met coach franklin down at vandy flipped to happy valley now im coming back and got the natty on my mind they cant touch my deep ball every game im scorin
ben sucks

i make ornaments for others but never for myself for the first time ever i made one for me this one we all love mo and this is my nod to him i normally charge 15 per ornament but im donating 15 to a childrens hospital since its for me in his name just want to make sure he shines for us at christmas every year wont ever forget him nor will most of you better for having him in our corner of the universe
2000

ravens dick down the cowboys 270 at psi net stadium in week 12 won super bowl link

2008

ravens close down texas stadium with back to back long distance runs fell short in the afc championship but won two playoff games with a rookie joe flacco and john harbaugh link

2012

ravens squeak out a 3129 pants shitting finish when dan baileys 51 yard field goal goes wide right after the cowboys recover an onside kick we would lose ladarius webb for the year and ray for the remainder of the regular season but ultimately it turned into his last ride and our 2nd ring in 17 years of existence link
also 2012
itll be interesting to see what headlines pop up surrounding dez bryant playing against the cowboys
no hostility towards the cowboys or anything but i hope we fucking crush them how nice would it be to have a really convincing win right now regardless of who the opponent is

and i hope andy dalton throws like three picks
2004 would like to have a word with you

right or wrong i dont think we have the moral high ground to talk about other peoples real or perceived police records
it really does kinda piss me off when you look at how easy theyve had it only thing id give them some credit for is beating the titans
this post lost all credibility when it said the browns are shit also the steelers and ravens have identical opponents for the most part
proven and those fucks support a rapist as thier qb support him

fuck i hate the steelers so damn much once again
rent free
they are still 110 though
you realize the ravens and steelers have practically the same schedule right
you guys also play the nfc east lmao not to mention the best team you guys have beaten is the colts lmao destroyed by the chiefs again and lost to new england and the titans again at least you guys might finish better than the browns tho
who is 110 tho

and let me tell you a word that steelers will be in and not ravens

playoffs
stay classy ravens fans

you said dream scenario so i can be what ever you want
if we find a way to make the playoffs i dont care about the titans i want another shot at the steelers with a full team of everyone not on ir if we gotta go through the titans to get there than so be it but i want another shot at pittsburgh
we all hoping for that although i wouldnt mind facing the bills in the wildcard too remind bills fans why lamar is better than josh allen
definitely want another shot at the steelers cheifs if we talking dream run but i just want a playoff win
this is a real possibility thought its more likely imo that wed play the bills in the first round if we go 115


lmaoooo
lmao roasting em

he aint wrong lol
probably a fine coming but the truth is the truth i like it time to start the go fund me page im in to help pay the fine
loool legend now we have to extend him when the time comes
i see no lies
but isnt it the bullies in highschool who graduate and cant be bullies in the realworld anymore the ones who typically become cops
lmaooo
jamison hensley snitching with the retweet lol
jaylon
hes not wrong
lol
lmaoooooo
so theyre growing up to have good jobs
haha yes racism is totally ok and funny as long as its against white dudes

edit yall can pretend you didnt know what he meant we all know what he meant and why he  it
hey saints here

mad respect yall got screwed rg3 and the other guy put his heart on the line sitting in awe

the game against the broncos should have gotten moved and yalls should have also been moved

nothing else great game mad respect
from one backup qb team to another backup qb team

ps i miss mark ingram ii
flock up
crawling on all fours

send help plz
the other guy

you mean the mcsorley tiktok legend and youtube rap star 1 in passer rating with a minimum of 6 attempts only qb who hasnt thrown an int in a wednesday night afternoon game

thats my qb3
well trade you ingram judon for mt or ak if you miss them that bad


hope brees gets back to 100 soon
appreciate it mark ingram is a stud
respect for you guys too hopefully you have a big run in the playoffs and brees gets healthy soon

dont tell my friend i said this hes a panthers fan
pffft other guy you give the leader in passer rating in the nfl his credit
im pretty sure hill would have broken the plane of the goal if luke wilsons leg doesnt stop him
removed
no
no stop the mcsorley hype like buck hes nothing more than a meme his td pass was more do to hollywood than him this is ridiculous
removed
first i just wanna say im incredibly proud of this team for keeping it competitive

marquise no longer soulja boy but still not hollywood again yet had a good game and that td appears to have gotten him back on track at least hopefully that was the first time ive seen him get real yac all year

this team is nothing without lamar granted we had a ton of other players out but god the offense just looked lost not that it was helped by roman calling like 4 hb dives on 3rd down lol

trace looked very good better than rgiii at that point but i feel bad for rgiii bc he was dealing with a hamstring injury since like early second quarter

our cb depth was very good despite the loss of jimmy other than a few missed tackles and one 10 yard stiff arm they looked very good especially mp who played his heart out despite mild injury

how the fuck did the d line look that good we were missing all but 3 players wolfe was insane and yannick got some good pressure considering how quick ben gets ig out and that he was being blocked by villanueva

extend tyus bowser right motherfucking now he is one int and sack away from pricing himself off this team and if we dont i have a feeling were gonna regret it big time like we did with zadarius

our 3 week old practice squad tes are very bad but i really dont blame them theyve had virtually no practice and no reps with the 1s but luke wilson has to catch that td

roman needs to go asap i dont blame harbs but his loyalty to coordinators can be infuriating

why the fuck did we run justice more than gus like what in the hell why why run rb4 more than rb2

overall proud of this team for fighting so hard i feel like we can catch fire in those last 3 games go 115 and keep it rolling into the playoffs and peak at the right time this year
i had the same thought as you about gus and justice justice looked pretty good compared to gus but i think its only because they were trying to run gus outside when his strength is ground and pound up the middle when they ran him up the middle he had some good runs but then they try and run justice on short yardage up the middle smh too smart for their own good maybe like maybe they thought well gus already had a good game against them last time so theyll be ready for him so lets run justice instead well catch em off hard he he he
colon castillo could actually be the solution at center
tomorrow im still going to wake up with a bad taste in my mouth knowing we got swept by our arch rival knowing the circumstances of the game and how we were basically a practice squad eases the pain a little but it still hurts if you dont think lamar would have made a difference today you dumb as hell lamar jackson is this team period after today all the casuals better realize how bad we are without him and we would probably be 37 or something yes lamar isnt the best thrower of the football and leaves us scratching our heads sometimes but this guy always gives us a shot at winning i hope this game is a real eye opener to our fo to get jackson some help
offensive line was surprisingly decent after we took out fluker who was awful and has been all year coloncastillo was excellent compared to skura and mekari the past few weeks bozeman played better too with coloncastillo holding up his end of the bargain coloncastillo has a really low center of gravity and what seems like a really strong push if he can get the mental aspects right he could be really good

orlando brown jr basically carried the offense on his back as much as he could this game he balled out and it started to look a lot like last year at times when orlando made it to the second level and blocked downfield

tyre phillips was back and he played okay though he did give up a sack on a stupid mistake that collinsworth called him out on still i feel much more comfortable with him in there than i do fluker who had multiple holding penalties because he has no clue what hes doing on the outside

i was also really impressed with our new cbs tramon williams and davontae harris both stepped up and harris gunner play was excellent
gros biggest mistake in this game was calling multiple runs on first down especially in the second half that put the ravens behind the mark on down and distance which has happened all yr it allowed the steelers to hunt on 2nd 3rd and long

mcsorely was helped by being down a lot and having to run 2 minute effectively removing the first down run from the game plan it also helped that the steelers were playing prevent rushing to contain but hey that pass to hollywood was nice that pass has also been there for the offense all year lamar just needs to take advantage

wink everyone is saying that wink called a brilliant game but i see it a bit differently yes he called a great game however he did so because he was forced to no practiceno installs combined with the fact that over half of our starting dl was missing wink had to call a more vanilla game they didnt blitz as much as they normally do which actually helped

our defense put up one of its best performances of the season despite having a bunch of key guys out because of vanilla play calling making everything simple maybe the ravens should continue to do that when they get their big guns back

its just funny to me both sides of the ball looked way better when the coordinators were forced to coach outside of their tendencies limited blitzing on d 2 minute offense on o
they ran justice bc he had the hot hand and was more effective gus had 9 carries for 10 yards bc the line couldnt block anything inside the tackles the only good runs were midline inverted veer type options w rg3 or justice going outside it was just what was working and in a game w a backup qb you have to take advantage of what they give you
i still dont get the calls to fire roman like if we call 40 passes for rg3 we would win the game or something

dude had a functional run game going against arguably the best d in the league with 2nd or 3rd stringers at basically every position

i guess people just assume the run game will stay the same and the passing game will improve if we fire roman

i feel like hey asshole its me your boss call more first down passes would do us a lot of good but im not ready to fire our oc who helped lamar win mvp based on his performance with this roster i just dont trust james urban or whoever to be an upgrade
i dont agree that we are nothing without lamar

we are les dynamic sure the announcers put it well rg3 is the same player as lamar but lamar is faster he adds an element that can take off and gain yards when he shouldnt be able to but even look at rg3s ability to get first downs at times

lamars biggest problem is playing from behind and no its not a team thing if the exact same game happened i dont think he hits that td to brown and puts us within a score lamar really needs to find himself

i was so confused they measure it its short yet they still give a first down and then they review it as if to give the appearance that they are trying to ensure the integrity of the game shouldnt they have gotten out an index card like the other year
its not so much bad calls that get me riled up its the gross inconsistencies of the referees regarding holding pi clock management personal fouls and ball spotting as big as the nfl is all referees should be full time its their job to enforce the rules then they should know the rules up down forward and backward and have consistent interpretations of the rules for every game
i really fucking hate pulling the ref card after losses cause it happens to literally every single team in sports but like man come on fuck me
so no one going to talk about that one play where claypool caught the ball and dude fell clearly both knees hit the floor one of our guys touched him and he got up and ran for an extra 5 yards or something and the refs called it a first down
wr1 allen robinson easily worth 14m

wr2 hollywood

slwr willie snead 5m

slwr devin doofernay

wr 5 proche ii


ok check this out

wr1 kenny golladay

wr2 hollywood

wr3 snead

wr3 gallup

wr4 duvernay

wr5 proche

trade boykin
yeah i stopped reading when you said doofernay and said were paying a wr 3 10m
doofernay
mike williams would be a much better option than robinson or gallup
willie snead and hollywood on the field at the same time is not good hollywood is a slot receiver he should honestly just be the 3 receiver truth is all our wrs are slot receivers we dont have a 2 caliber wr
its going to be the exact same group minus dez plus a mid round rookie or other late career possession guy we wont have money and even if we didnt we dont spend it on wrs
id rather look at devonte smith or rashod bateman in the draft and use the money to re sign yannick as much as i would love allen robinson i think the texans go super hard after him they have no 1st and 2nd round draft picks have lost hopkins and now fuller is a fa

x200b

if we do go after a wr in fa i think it will be someone slightly cheaper like corey davis
ravens have only 40 players sign through next year and not enough money to sign even one of these free agent wr

why would they want to come here anyway the scheme we use sucks for wrs
nah were gonna overpay juju instead
dude i see your name attached to crazy posts every day now gallup as a receiver 3 at 10 mil and we sign him and robinson youre just seeing fa names on wiki and grabbing at them like candy

doofernay out of the young guys hes one of the most promising

get outta here man

edit i didnt even see the trade boykin lol trade a guy who would sit on 80 of the leagues ps
the defensive game plan with a depleted dl almost won us a game that we had no business winning on paper plus props to ellis and washington who held their own in the trenches
im proud of the team no exceptions really liked coloncastillo who adds some solid depth at c decent snaps and made some good blocks too
i never thought the day would come that id say this but it made me so happy to see him rush 3

blitzing the steelers is suicide ben throws the ball so fast i thought our defensive approach was exactly how you defend them
wink was a mastermind out there some of our blitz plays worked so so well our dbs were in a position to make plays every time we bought into the bend dont break defence which weve always been known to do when our backs are against the walls and for the most part it worked wasnt until jimmy smith peters were off the field that they got a passing td

wink is amazing i hope were able to keep him for years to come
wink killed it hes done a great job and deserves the recognition

also new players stepped up big time soooo proud honestly we should rethink the starting lineup cuz tbh that squad played with more heart than ive seen in a lot of this season they were playing with real focus and grit and it showed

honestly nfl needs a ref who watches from the tv camera sometimes you wonder if the officials even have their eyes open or if they just got lazy and didnt feel like throwing a flag but the integrity of the game starts to deteriorate when you have multiple instances like this where something egregious gets missed just because the officials dont see it im a soccer ref so i get it that officials just miss things sometimes because you cant have your eyes everywhere at once but for the sake of the fans allow a tv ref to radio in to the field guys for things like this that all of america can see but the zebras on the field cant because their view is blocked or because the game is moving too fast
duh
seems like another relevant noncall by the officials to miss this clear false start on the critical thirddown conversion by the steelers on their final drive

countless people genuinely believe we will not be making the playoffs this year

cmon man four of our final five games are against teams with losing records plus i believe we can honestly beat cleveland that puts us at 115 and at worst 106 surely that will be good enough

a lot of these other contenders have to play each other raiders play the dolphins for example so somebody is losing there indy probably ends the year at 106 and we have tiebreaker plus the stretch gets hard for teams like the dolphins and patriots

i guess what im asking is is this just more antibaltimore narrative and hate or is there something alarming that im not seeing please let me know if im blind to something
i know since that tweet a lot of us have hated him and he deserves most of it but at the end of the day hes a raven and i obviously wont him to do well the fact that he got a touchdown and a quite difficult one at that really does make me happy and reassures that he isnt a complete bust i honestly think its mostly the system that has fucked him i hope things get better for us next season most notably our passing game
i hope we use him more going forward with lamar it seems like we only put hollywood on go routes which just doesnt work i gasped when he ran a slant yesterday
hollywood is the best route runner we have its kind of sad hes stuck in a run first offense with romans passing schemes
that move to put minkah on skates was amazing we need to get him some passes in the open field
hes definitely not a bust there are a lot of things that have contributed to his lack of production

the scheme his size bad throws from lamar dropped balls the fact that were generally a run first team bad oline play and not having more receiving threats to take some of the attention away

i think most of this will improve as our offense is very young including the oline browns size has to come up the dude is just tiny his routes get fucked up way too much by contact which has hurt timing quite a bit i think this is his number one issue if he puts on another 20 pounds of muscle in the offseason year 3 will be his breakout year theres just too many things off with out offense this year to place so much blame on him

im honestly not worried about him im more worried that well give up on him prematurely and hell go light it up for another team
hollywood will only do well if there is a strong 1 on the other side at this point he cannot be the 1 receiver on this team he either gets jammed at the line or muscled off the route too easily

i really hope the guy does well and i still have faith in him but he wont reach the level of expectations unless we bring someone else in
that shifty juke he used on minkah was awesome thats what i want to see more of from him
honestly that was just terrible defending should have been a 1015 yard gain max but the steelers dbs completely whiffed on tackles hes not out of the doghouse for me
hollywood is fast but romans routes suck his small size is an issue that prevents him from competing for jump passes but hes not a terrible player its not that hes awful hes just not being used properly lamar also has a tendency to overthrow deep passes

lack of talent isnt really our issue its not using what we have efficiently we do need better receivers tho
yesterday this team had every reason to throw in the towel ten days of no practice missing 10 starters including the reigning league mvp calling up ten practice squad players and traveling the day of the game to an undefeated division rival they could have given up and focused on the cowboys

they didnt

they played their asses off and almost came away with a win harbaugh may be frustrating at times but if theres one thing thats obvious after this game its that he certainly hasnt lost his locker room they came to win yesterday they came up short but man what an effort

if brandon williams doesnt get hurt against new england they probably win that game wink made the right adjustments at halftime but unfortunately belichick is too good a coach to let an injury like that go unexploited immediately pats took a decent lead early and theres no coming back in a torrential downpour a tough break

they should have beaten the steelers the first time around thats the game that really hurts because they had a good lead and they shot themselves in the foot with turnovers and penalties that said i feel very confident in saying at this point that the steelers are a very beatable team in fact they might lose to the bills and the colts down the stretch and kc might take the 1 seed away from them

as always the titans are a tough matchup for them the titans are good but even in that game they were still missing williams and campbell and it took overtime for tennessee to beat them and kc i still think was the result of poor game planning on the part of wink though its the only game all year in which the ravens were clearly overmatched so whats my point in all this

the ravens are better than their 65 record and the rest of the league doesnt see it theyll be playing every game here on out like its a playoff game and they have the easiest remaining schedule in football last season they peaked at the wrong time this year is about meeting the challenges handed to them and they will answer see yall in the playoffs

tldr fuck the steelers
tldr fuck the steelers

here here

that said while we could win out i dont feel great right now the defense played well yesterday and yes the offense showed signs of life but i just dont have a lot of confidence right now we simply have to many issues given the various injuries plus who knows how the folks coming back from covid will be i simply think its to early to know what we might do we could win out but if we miss the playoffs i wont be shocked

the noncall on that delay of game had me yelling at my tv like a degenerate gambling father
run dont walk to the sports book to take wft 95 over steelers this week or 370
meh 50 seconds and no timeouts 4th and inches im pretty sure they could seal the game right then and there anyways the real bullshit call was the first half missed delay of game that right there wouldve easily won us the game
at the same time as the steelers are consistently just eeking out wins it feels that most of our losses are by by thin margins andor we collapse late in the game its so frustrating because we are pretty closely matched but our records make it seem other wise
theres no doubt that theyre the worst 110 team ever they still have to play the chiefs which could very well allow the chiefs to leapfrog them in the standings give us this team again in the playoffs when were at full strength and well see how it plays out
so what youre saying is the steelers are overrated trash and will lose in the first round i couldnt agree more
you guys seriously need to let that go we played almost the same schedule and by the end of the regular itll be the same except 2 teams and youre including the ravens in that cake walk talk too so disrespectful
jeff driskel led broncos
holy shit their schedule is beyond easy
steelers only have 1 quality win and thats against tennessee
this is just cringe they are 110 and beat us twice if they are so terrible wtf does that make our team dont be sore losers
ill say they dont really pass the eye test in terms of do they really scare me but they did win all their games so far they dont make their schedule i think a couple teams look better than they are but lets not pretend they arent a top 5 team regardless of recordschedule
do people really hate the steelers so much that they cant accept the fact that theyre a good team i dont care who they played or how they did it theyre fucking 110 get over it
this is really petty i could do this for literally anyones schedule and come out with the same result l
rgiii and mcsorley deserve a lot of credit for stepping to the plate yesterday and i know we were playing with a bunch of backups but i really feel luckier than ever that we have lamar under center theres such a glaring difference in decision making and pressure awareness he really is able to create something from nothing and i always feel like a lamarled offense is able to move the chains albeit not as well as last year

in llama we trust
man im sorry to dogpile on rg3 but he aint it

i think we can let him go after this season and go with trace as our backup
i dont know why anyone would take the reigning mvp for granted the team is literally built around the guy
nah they still will

if anything the people who unironically want mcsorely to start have been empowered
people that understand the sport and this team do not take him for granted those who do just dont understand the sport or just dont like the ravens its simple as that
i hate to be that guy but the td mcsorley threw wasnt really a byproduct of a play he made the throw wasnt particularly great the corner was overly aggressive and hollywood did most of the heavy lifting

he even threw a pass that should have been picked

i dont know why so many people other than backup qb novelty think he looked good
trace does a good job and i believe he will start somewhere at some point just not us as long as we have a healthy lamar
that qb trap that rgiii ran might have gone for at least 50maybe even a td with lamar same with that bootleg on 2nd 1
do we know if he will be back by the cowboys game
so your saying a starter is better than the backups riveting
is this ever going to end multiple special teams penalties on levine illegal formations corners playing too handsy etc this is getting disgusting at this point
this is probably the only time all season i can kind of understand that we got flagged still not acceptable but at least it was off the back of no practice for like 2 weeks we need to be more disciplined
illegal formation is unreal like we have to be on pace for an nfl record 11games in mind blowing
a lot is honestly referee bias no coincidence that ravens opponents have the least amount of penalties this season ravens are 32 in the league with their opponents only being flagged a little over 4 times a game when is the last time youve seen our opponent flagged for a hold last night was another prime example
doesnt help that the refs throw the flag as soon as the ball leaves the qbs hand everytime anyone takes a deep shot against marlon
fluker holds every single game
while i agree that pi call was stupid so was that roughing the passer the steelers got refs need to be paid full time by the nfl so they can take all year to practice and master their craft the delay of game non call was worse then the pi call imo

the illegal formation shit is all on us either greg roman is missing something or the offense is not understanding where they are supposed to be needs to be fixed
friendly bills fan here

i was doing some research after cheering for you guys last night and found the interesting thing that separates you guys from us on offence given our penalty issues 1 and 2 at 65 and 66 yards per game its the fact that your ground and pound scheme means that your plays are at a far higher likely hood of being unable to regain the yards lost on for example a holding call on first down assuming a call back on 1st down resulting in 1st20 you guys average 54 yds a play meaning on average in three plays you can claw back to a 4th4 the bills passing attack gains 86 yds per play meaning we can still on average convert from a first down holding penalty

i cant tell you whether its discipline or biased officiating or just straight up bad officiating with you guys where i can pretty easily say its mostly discipline with some horrible officiating mixed in for us

i for one hope to see you guys in the playoffs and hope yalls coaching staff can figure out a solution to the penalties over the next few weeks
the bogus deep ball pi penalties are the worst
we have the second most penalty yards commited and we have the least amount of penalties committed against us
yeah but 36 of that was the bs call against marlon
everyone blaming the refs but no one wants to blame harbs most of these penalties are really happening and they are happening week after week after week eventually a coach needs to step up and fix the damn issue or discipline the players that are repeat offenders harbs is trash and needs to go
they really should have a hard look at pi calls this is just getting ridiculous just throw the ball in the general area your wr might end up release so fast that routes arent even established and then watch the flag fly in so guys that release the ball quickly are just playing the rules instead of the game brady and now ben are apparently masters of this clever use of game mechanics

just put yardage on it 10 yards or just 5 even without automatic first down none of this spot of the foul shit

bernard pollard still had to get a jab in he hates us so much its comical


and yes i know what he said about hollywood many people on this sub feel the same way but yeah pollard still is an asshole
theyll just say that we saw what lamar will be in 5 years in rg3
it wasnt the steelersravens game we wanted anyone still saying lamar isnt legit needs to be forcibly removed from their platform
facts lol
stephen a had nothing good to say about the steelers though
i love lamar has basically been in the league 3 years already and ppl still be saying this
problem is a lot of ravens fans are already calling for mcsorley to take over lamar after seeing him throw 1 td to brown i am excited for mcsorley too but come on
sas
morning flock hate losing to the squeelers but that loss had a different feel for sure id ask that you keep in mind how crazy the conditions we played are as you read my analysis sorry for typos

offense
1 qbing wasnt great if not for the long score with marquise we wouldnt of topped 100 yards passing it could be argued that we game planned to simply run the ball and fall back on the defense but that doesnt make up for the lack of passing production rg3 royally screwed up with the pick 6 trace looked okay as much as a 3rd string tiktok sensation can his long score was more marquise taking it than him trace could be come a decent backup but rg3 isnt its clear we only keep him for his running prowess

2 the wrs were largely in effective its been thoroughly discussed how this group has issues though in this instance the game plan really wasnt to utilize them scheming receivers continues to be a real problem what kills me here is that we have young talent who i truly believe have great upside but per tradition we fell to develop it we need a better wr coach and we need someone to help develop passing schemes within our offense whether that means getting rid of gro or getting him better help will be something to watch

3 the te group did a good job blocking overall wilsons drop was critical in the loss fitzpatrick did make a good play on the ball but wilson has to hold onto that it was a great play call and decently place ball

4 the oline is just a revolving door this year we all know its flawed but given the circumstances i thought they did ok pass blocking wasnt good constant pressures forced quick passes all game run blocking was up and down they werent getting a push against a strong dline special shout out to castillo dude played great almost all the way around skura as much as i like the guy is honestly our third best center at this point

5 our rbs were inconsistent but played well imo gus struggled to find lanes i saw a lot of people saying this is proof gus is likely done with us i have to disagree i seriously doubt he was being evaluated playing behind the line he was against a good dline gus and dobbins will likely be our backs next year also the squeelers subbed heavy personnel every time gus came in because he is a mauler hill was nice he has similar play to dobbins

6 overall the offense was whats its been we still struggle with the presnap penalties and fluker is a liability at any position at this point his holding calls killed good drives i believe if we werent thin on the line hed be cut the problems that have plagued us since the eagles are still there no doubt but given the circumstance they came out with a fairly safe game plan that relied on running the ball and playing good defense ill be damned if it didnt almost work

7 one more note here turnovers have killed us against pitt as of late we have turned the ball over every time weve played them the last 4 games 3 of which were multiple turnover games we have to clean that up

defense
8 the pass rush didnt register a sack ben had a lot of time frequently but his quick release that collinsworth may very well whack it to made it hard for anyone to get home they generated some hits and pressures but were overall underwhelming

9 the lbs were up and down queen and fort rally to the ball quickly but queen still struggles with play recognition i think hell be okay but not until the game at this level slows down for him with that being said i know that pff has him as a terrible player and while i love pff for analytics i wouldnt take it that far queen frequently rallies to the ball even when he messes up his tackling needs to improve hes a rookie in an unprecedented season cut him some slack for now though he is a liability in the middle fergusonbowser have really made the most of their time lately good to see them developing

10 cb play was mostly great we needed the secondary to prevent the big play and they did however i dont understand why we refuse to disrupt the timing of their wideouts we know the plays yet continually give them a ton of cushion we all know peter is largely boom or bust but marlo has the tools to be physical at the line we saw it a little in the first half but it faded throughout the game that offense relies on the timing if we want to beat them we have to disrupt it

11 the dline is hard to evaluate because the squeelers dont really have a run game they missed tackles and failed to open up pass rush lanes they werent bad per se but they didnt really do a ton either

12 the safeties mostly played well clark had 13 tackles a career high sadly they failed to make a play that could of changed the game on the final third down conversion elliot and him have been under a lot of fire this is a position i think we need to add competition to this offseason

13 overall the defense was our saving grace can we really fault them given the circumstances tackling was poor and has been for awhile now we absolutely have to clean that up i believe that generally falls to the lb coach or dline coach tackling in this game was bad but when you havent hit in how long was it its bound to be bad red zone d was beautiful almost
all game they got gassed but thats to be expected with how much they were on the field without subs largely

coaching

14 roman called a safe game he clearly didnt trust the passing game with rg3 we still cant scheme receivers open its frustrating watching all the picksquick slants pitt runs and wondering why we dont even attempt those roman isnt going anywhere before the season ends but his time may very well come to an end if we dont make the playoffs or go one and done

15 wink did great imo thats really all i have to say about that

16 harbs deserves credit for having the team ready this week despite checks news feed the apocalypse they played with guts and heart im personally proud of them on harbs once again im seeing the fire harbs stuff start to trickle in i wont lie i see some valid points he holds onto coordinators so long and he doesnt have the offensive mind to correct and offense however he is a super bowl winning coach you can say it was ray or ed or whatever but that doesnt change the facts extremely well respected and beloved by this team he isnt a bad coach by any stretch of the imagination furthermore who you gonna replace him with reids arent sitting around looking for jobs replacing a head coach is a huge gamble i cant believe the organization has seen anything out of him that theyd be willing to take that gamble

notes

17 the play call to run the ball at the end of the half imo doesnt bother me terribly however the clock management was terrible this is an area where harbs has to get it together the play call following the blatant hold by the steelers was great just didnt work out

18 the end of the game was some of most blatant ref ball ive ever seen i dont understand how that happens the nfl should be ashamed

19 given what i was expecting i was super proud of our guys yesterday i saw a fire in their eyes lets hope we keep that fire going forward we still have a good shot at the playoffs but i really think we may need to win out its doable but lets also not think its a guarantee dallas is going to be tougher than we think they have lots of weapons depending on who we get back it could be a challenge we must beat cleveland the rest arent overly concerning but nothing is guaranteed

20 expectations were high this season and we failed to meet them we are at worse and average team and at best a top 10 team when we play our best ball were a force but we just havent

21 one final note related to us as fans more than the game itself first it was nice to be in a game day thread that wasnt just we suck or this team is butt cheeks i enjoy game day threads because i get to actually talk ball with fellow fans this sub was super positive following a division loss which was nice but it went over the top a little we still loss moral victories dont change our record i get why people felt like that though again proud of my boys with that being said theres always a few post whining that people are being positive i get that you want to be a realist and im down for that but calling out your fellow fans for feeling good comes off patronizing and like you just want to be edgy or whatever its all in how you frame the conversation this isnt us vs them its us discussing with us

i know that was a long one and i look forward to discussing keep your heads high flock none of us should feel shame about that game as always fuck the steelers
do you expect the run game to stay as is if we fire roman

i agree his passing concepts suck but im still not sure its worth losing his run scheme which is effective against strong defenses even with the current roster

maybe we just need a passing game coordinator

it just feels like nobody is worried about our run game getting worse post roman when that is a very real possibility
i will just say sometimes there are losses and moments that feel like catalyst or inflection points in a season that game was one of them to me something about it felt like we were gonna be okay even with the loss

in a way it helps us down the stretch to manage personnel too with no preseason we had no game tape to evaluate some of this fringe talent today we did and they played their tails off

i feel optimistic not often after a loss we tried the one seed thing didnt work im ready to run the gauntlet in tennessee in pitt in kc to get to the superbowl to beat the giants

lets fucking go
who among you can do a deep dive into the ravens wr coaches honestly has it been the guy or crew for the last 12 years that was just cloned from the early 2000s why has this team been cursed with bad wr play
not in as much detail as most posts in this thread and im aware too many cooks spoil the broth you might have an american alternative but id like to see hill get more carries going forward
i have found an error in your post

play that couldve changed

i suggest that wvuravens use play that couldve changed instead of is not a verb like have is

this is an automated bot i do not intend to shame your mistakes if you think the errors which i found are incorrect please contact me through dms or contact my owner elitedamyth
if we want to meet the 2 steelers in the playoffs as the 7 seed

we need to go 106 the colts to not go above 106 and the raiders to go 97 max

the chiefs must win out and go 151

the steelers need to lose 2 games preferably to the bills and browns

it seems unlikely but in 2020 who knows the playoff picture would look like this
arent the bills the only real team that remain on their schedule theyd have to lose 2 of their remaining and dont we need them to beat brownies
i hate doing this there is to many variables this early in the game to be worrying about it lets make the post season and see what happens it is likely they will get a bye and games will work out however they workout
steelers titans chiefs would be the ultimate redemption arc playoff run
man its been a hot minute since i had to scoreboard watch
the afc north gonna get blasted in the playoffs the entire conference is being propped up by a truly garbage schedule the ravens by virtue of when they played their toughest games are probably the most properly rated team

cleveland played 4 teams with a winning record all year and lost three by a combined 71 points if you take out wins over each other the entire afc north has three victories over 500 teams
it would be really funny to watch the steelers get throttled at home in the playoffs by the browns
as a steelers fan i would love this scenario the three game sweep is so funny to see i almost want us to lose so i can watch it happen
a coviddecimated team held their own but ultimately fell to the steelers the cowboys loom on the horizon can the good guys return to winning

this got a chuckle out of me
my head snapped up from my half asleep lounging when i saw this i bit so hard well played well played sir
i came too close to almost eating the onion on this one lol
this season is so stupid i almost believed it
you finally made me buy coins you bastard and on a ravens sub no less im a steelers fan here and i was really looking forward to this match up
love the onion
i laughed
thatll teach em
lmao gotta love the onion
good game guys i wish both of us had all of our players looking forward to next years games steelers fan
ravens fan for life here in all seriousness i hope the only thing the steelers took home was a win game should have been canceled the risk was not worth it people dying from this shit
haha
oof i was so close to eating the onion
you get a hug

in other news the football team manages to become the first team to lose a game against a team with no players
they got off easy should have been a first and a second
65
fake news much
time to pay the man guys stepped up hugged last few games and really looks like hes developing this year
hes improved but throwing out pay the man is a little too much if he continues the way he is and finishes the season out well we shall see
give him the decosta special 3 years at 6 mil or so a year
time to pay the man

pay him as in extend him sure but i wouldnt pay him much he played well last night but id like to see a little more and for more than just one season

i think we try and keep him over judon but i certainly wouldnt be breaking the bank we still need to extend yannick
has bowser notably improved as a pass rusher this season genuine question

i remember seeing earlier in the season hes made strides in run support but was curious about his pass rushing numbers
bowser has always done pretty well imo we have other locks we need to concern ourself with first but im sure this offseason he will get a good offering
theres definitely a role for him on the defense going forward even if its not as an edge rusher his versatility is an asset
my question would be what role does he have early downs and on 3rd down i dont think he is a great pass rusher so on 3rd down hed have to cover tes and rbs is that a valuable position on our defense or can fortqueen do that

i think he would be a very good 43 will but that position doesnt really translate great to our d
king koopa szn
depends on what he wants not sure he is playing like a second rounder right now and this is the best he has been certainly would like to see him stay but if youre talking big contract im not there
he should get a 1 year deal with a 2nd year option
330 would be perfect
every year i swear to god its a new x linebacker has balled out for a few games we should pay them and it barely ever works out for us we still dont have an x factor edge thats worth paying big money
im all for him becoming great because im not sure there will ever be a better name to have on a jersey
i love me some king koopa and id be all for bringing him back on a midtier vet contract but im pretty sure ferguson is gonna take over the sam lb spot next year while we resign ngakoue as the rush lb
pay him for what how many sacks does he have
yeah no hes not good

why for gro to never use them
show it to marquis he can learn a lot about reaching for a ball not worrying about the ground and having some heart
decosta is doing his job right its gro who still uses the three tight end package instead of coming up with wr plays
we were historically terrible in november of this year that is usually our best month before this season we had owned this month during the john harbaugh era going 3613 in november since 2008 including leaguebest 224 mark at homesource this year we only won one gamekeep in mind yesterdays game was supposed to be played in november but still whats even more crazy is that we went undefeated in octoberwhich is our historically worse month

from 20082018 we were 1725 in october last year we went 30and we did so again this year and just when you think we were going to round the corner and start playing wellnovember happens and boomshit hits the fansecond source
yea that is odd probably the greg roman effect

3 of our 5 losses realistically should have been wins this is the one major reason i am holding hope in this team if we clean up some of these ridiculous penalties and other mental miscues we could be very good
they didnt allow harbaugh close enough to observe the spotting of the ball during the 4th down play ravens are entitled to have the game replayed at a neutral site with all of our players
one thing for damn sure is the ravens are the last fucking team the steelers want to meet in the playoffs
if you counted the points we scored and ignored the others youll see it was a shutout
stop the stealers
this is fucking hilarious
isnt it odd how when they keep counting the points they all come largely in their favor
this sub is way more fun than the steelers just like your qb
so true
lmao wow

didnt break my heart the refs did that

sorry if this has already been posted but my friend at penn state made me aware of this songs existence after his touchdown yesterday
i was curious if we actually have been getting hosed by the refs as badly as it seems this year so i went to nflpenaltiescom to look at the numbers

the ravens are

5th in penalties against with 72 behind kc car az and buf

2nd in penalty yards against with 715 buf 1 with 726

sucks right clearly there are some discipline issues and the illegal formation penalties on offense can be attributed exclusively to coaching but this is where it gets absolutely infuriating

in beneficial penalties penalties against opponents the ravens are

tied for dead last with hou with only 47 beneficial calls none of the other 4 teams above us in penalties against are even in the top half for least beneficial calls with the next closest being buffalo with 63 beneficial calls

dead last in benficiary yards with 382 the saints with 396 are the only other team below 400 yards of beneficial penalties

put it all together and our penalty differential is a league worst 25 the next closest team is no and buf at 14 and then no one else is below 11 the difference between us and 2nd place is the same as the difference between bufno in 2nd and the browns at 14th

in addition we are dead last in net penalty yards with 333 with only the saints anywhere near us at 316 the next lowest team is 176 there is no logical explanation for why us and no are so much worse off than everyone else in that category

tldr the refs fucking suck and we are by far the most affected team this year save for maybe no but we all know the refs hate sean peyton go to the site above nflpenaltiescom and sort by net count as well as net yards to see what im getting at

this post wasnt made to sound whiny or bitchy but its kind of hard not to after looking at the stats lol
it anyone is wondering the steelers are first in the nfl in net penalty yards compared to our dead last
i remember seeing someone speculating on twitter a few weeks back that the endless string of bad callsnoncalls against us was the refs way of getting back at harbaugh for yelling at that guy in the kc game dont think its actually happening but it would certainly explain a lot
one of the worst things in the officiating community is how refs will get together before the game to go over what each team is known for or has a reputation for for example in soccer if you know a team is known for being a little too aggressive then you can try and get it under control by calling smaller fouls early on to send the players the message that it wont be tolerated
however this leads to a bias you are essentially looking for opportunities to call fouls which will lead to more fouls being called ones that in other games you would either choose to not call or you just wouldnt see because youre not micro managing the players
in football and for the ravens this could mean the officials saying this team likes to use weird formations so make sure you are looking extra close at their formations or their corners like to play physical so if it looks like pi then it probably is things like that where you have a preconceived notion going into it and then you see something that reminds you of it and it confirms your bias could lead to lots of extra penalties
i think the most damning is the lack of still zero dpi and offensive holding against our opponents sure we dont take a lot of prayer shots that lead to dpi but theres been so many cases of at a minimum illegal contact that are getting intentionally ignored watt shoving hollywood 10 yds downfield no problem humphrey hand fighting with crypool downfield dpi

the amount of absurdly obvious holds our opponents get away with specifically in high leverage plays that have serious impact on the outcome of the game is just maddening

steelers holding in the end zone no safety just a first down pats with 2 blatant holds on the burkhead run that got them off their own goaline and jump started a back breaking drive no problem fuck you baltimore

fluker exists on the field holding baltimore although fluker does suck and he definitely does hold tf out of people but if were not getting away with it then neither should our opponents
cnn cant say these are baseless claims we have the data
ill buy that were the worst in penalties against without a conspiracy why not we play aggressive on defense in an offenseoriented league make some formation mistakes on offense constantly etc

as for penalties in favor if it smells like a pig dresses like a pig sounds like a pig its a pig there is literally no way on earth other teams when they play us all magically play the most fundamentally sound game of their lives

throw it on a dime

this is dark af


i love it
i was casually talking trash on the nfl thread last night and steelers fans quickly started angrily responding and downvoting me lol this is what i imagine them to look like
i like this one
its kinda depressing that an undefeated team almost lost to the ben denucci lead cowboys and the ravens practice squad
haha oh geez thats great
i like how at the time of this comment this post has 64 comments and most of them are this permacleaned dork from the steelers sub trying to convince everyone that hes totally not bothered by this at all
thank you i enjoyed this
jesus christ this is dark
removed

every day i find myself loving ravens fans more
fuck the steelers
i subbed here because my father fought in the meme wars last year i was stuck on a sand planet helping my uncle with his moisture farm but felt like i could do more so here i am my only other football sub is the lions sub as theyre my nfc team anyway fuck the steelers fuck the raiders thanks for coming to my ted talk
chiefs bros are the best bros the real reason we need to make the afc championship is for another meme war
fuck steelers unity
fuck the steelers
ill go one further i think lamar and mahomes are both very good at football and cool as hell
please fucking destroy them do us this service you got this
browns fan clocking in fuck the steelers clocking out
if the ravens unfortunately do not make the playoffs this year can we at least have an chiefs themed endgame portals meme with big ben as thanos and lamar gus ingram and the ravens subreddit explode out of the rubble like antman does with hulk rocket and war machine
i must say i also appreciated how kc and dolphins fans were very vocal against the steelers on the game day thread
hey rkansascitychiefs
just wanna say that if somehow we dont make the playoffs then i hope you absolutely obliterate the steelers and win it all
great post
everyone hates the steelers fucking clowns
fuck the steelers and the raiders
i try to be friendly can i stay
appreciate it chief bro you guys have an insane amount of talent on your team and its fun to watch
fuck the steelers
been subbed here since the great meme wars of 19 yall are a great group of people i was pulling for yall yesterday
im a chiefs fan and im thinking of moving to baltimore for work glad to know we can have some common ground fuck the steelers
just curious what reason does a chiefs fan have to hate the steelers on a similar level to a ravens fan
i say this with as much hatred as possiblethe steelers are a bunch of poopyheads
texted my buddy who lives in kc after they played the bucs and made brady cry we got a good laugh out of that fuck the steelers and the patriots and tom brady
i didnt know chiefs fans hate steelers like that
chiefs fans are being so petty because the steelers have the 1 seed going forward and theyre too insecure to hear posed questions like are the steelers better than the chiefs without getting triggered
brothers
come on man we gave that boi his first td an it was 70 yards
im out of the loop why do the chiefs hate them now apart from the obvious statement that the steelers deserve to be hated
i really like this team and the fans fuck the steelers
united by the hatred of the team thats clearly got the better record than both of us this year
is baltimore the handicapped little brother crying for his big brother chiefs to protect him
nah fuck them too lmao
hate them bc u cant be them

i dont know about anyone else but i always breathe a sigh of relief whenever we beat them reality is both organizations are wellrun usually play very close games against each other and play each other twice each year no sense in anyone dunking on anyone since were gonna be back here in less than a year
did we really only dress 36 players or was it that we only had 36 of our typical players
the fact is that were 65 and have very real issues that need to be addressed and looked at

i dont care if the steelers are a fraud 110 this team needs to get its ass in gear
who cares i dont see them getting anywhere in the playoffs so they can have their great regular season
we play down to their level

yes fantastic job
very very proud
throw it on a dime

let them brag they gotta play the colts and bills itll be over soon
the refs didnt win them the first game lamar let them off the hook with 4 turnovers
theyll go one and one in the playoffs and then theyll sorta know how we feel except we had a tough schedule last year and were actually good not really worried about them going on a playoff run
if they bring that sorry ass defense against the bills its gonna be a blowout
at this point i hope they go undefeated then get knocked out of their first playoff game so we can brag about how their loss was worse than ours last year
and soon to be first round exit
why are there always steelers fans lurking on this sub do they really have nothing better to do
played three teams in four games with a record over 0500

i still think they get smacked around in the playoffs
this year is a wash it would be great to see them eliminated during the playoffs though
tbf the browns look solid this year havent watched them much tho thats just going off their record still point stands
who cares theyre 110 just because were 65 and have sucked for the last two months we need to keep harping on this do you really think wed be any different if we were in that position
do the ravens not also play the full nfc east and the browns bengals twice
made me chuckle
okay i hate the steelers just as much as the rest of usbut we also play the nfc east and the bengles and browns twice and the shitty jags
its a fond wish of mine that they should get eliminated in their first playoff game that would really hit the spot wouldnt it
first thing that sticks out is the 2 teams above 500

well they have beaten the browns ravens 2x andtitans so wouldnt that be 4 teamsgames where the opponent was above 500
110



steelers opponents 49792
chiefs opponents 5370

but youre right the steelers arent for real because of a cupcakestuffed schedule
rent free
you left out are 110
lmao ravens coping as usual i remember when you guys barely beat us by 3 pts with mason fucking rudolph and not only that you guys had to knock him out too lol
lol salty ravens hahahahah
bit of a long story but a nice one

so i recently took a milestone in sobriety at the meeting my friend whos a steelers fan spoke about how when he first met me at the time i had around 2 years in and he had 6 he stops and goes interesting what else have i celebrated 6 of that youve only celebrated 2 of as were in canada this reference to super bowl wins went over the heads of everyone else but got quite the colorful response from me it was a great dig and even though its the squeelers i have to respect such a good super specific burn
hahaha well played and congrats on your milestone thats amazing
fellow canadian here living in an area with wayy too many steelers fans some americans may have trouble understanding but youll go crazy around here if you arent able to differentiate the person from the fan id love to be a part of a community where the vast majority of people heavily cheer for the same team everything is a pissing contest up here from standard sports to the olympics everyone would rather argue about how their teamcountry is better than just celebrate an event

congrats on the milestone though hope your friends took you for a drink to celebrate
i call bullshit the steelers have been an nfl team for 87 years with 6 championships baltimore between the colts and the ravens have had an nfl team for 54 years and we have 6 championships weve won the same in 33 less years fuck the steelers
hilarious
congratulations
congrats on the awesome milestone also a big fan of your username
no
stuff like this makes me think marlon is the unstated team leader keeping the guys motivated

humprhey
shoutout mike campanaro still supporting to the day speaks volumes about the organization
my favorite raven is still lamar but i would say marlon makes it a hard choice
i dont fuck with the ravens but he really jumps off the screen he makes the league better
i live have elite cbs thought this was for sure a td

i think what i like most about fruit punch is like the whole team is getting in on it now and its basically just stand the guy up and beat the shit out of the ball until the whistle blows
if we played the steelers 3 times a year in the regular season he would probably have 9 by now cause marlon always fucks juju with the punch outs and not to mention the ones that went out of bounds against the steelers and eagles
surely you mean most in a season not all time
shouldve put in a single season in the title hes still 45 shy of robert mathis for career total
man his legs in that pic are making me very uncomfortable
i could see it happening especially if the cowboys stick with zeke as the starter he should get one or two there and then against the bengals itll happen once
only problem is when they all focus on trying to punch the ball out instead of tackling meanwhile the ball carrier rumbles forward for another 6 yards
peanut tillman was the master at that
do the ones that the d doesnt recover count
im pretty sure tillman has way more ff than marlon are you saying most in a season
too bad we dont play juju anymore
he made some great punches yesterday
so 5 away from having the all time record for himself
correction i meant tied most all time in a single season thank you to the users who corrected me
dpoy of the year in my book
wait are you serious this is fucking insane

edit nvm its most in a season which makes sense imo
looking at most of our receivers hollywood snead duv proche and dez all but one of them are dudes meant to be in the slot very strange team building

i honestly think we need to get at least 2 new wrs who can handle the outside

the amount of fixing this is gonna take
boykin is not an outside receiver he never uses his size to his advantage
try to get an outside wr in ar in fa would be best scenario but this team time and time again rather get an aging wr im convinced this coaching group will never develop a star wr we either draft a rookie wr who is already at an elite level or attack free agency devin duvernay is great he has speed hes physical unlike hollywood but they just cant develop nor utilize wrs even when joe was qb there wasnt a wr who was drafted and turned out to be a star with the exception of torrey smith he wasnt a star but he was good
unless i missed it did dez do anything at pitt
its going to be hard to change our wr misfortunes until we get better at evaluating and developing them you cant just keep putting bandaids on the issue by signing well known free agents although that does help

we need to hit on the wr position i think we did better this year with duv and proche but its not enough
dez can play outside
hollywood is not a slot receiver i get that his speed and the fact that he is smaller makes him a fit for slot but hes just too small he would get fucking destroyed duvernay and snead should be our slot guys if hollywood can put on 20 more pounds of muscle put him in the slot
which i thought would work well with what we were building we were adding a bunch of speedy and shifty receivers who we could spread out and kill it in the short passing game playing to lamars strength or weakness in throwing outside the numbers it would be a great compliment to the run game we had in theory it seemed like it would work kind of like the patriots old offense a bunch of those type of wrs paired with receiving tes

the problem was we just didnt run that offense this year it seems like were just running plays with no sequencing we dont set anything up we dont work our pass game off our run game nothing
duv could play on the outside if he just improves his route running progressions and variety of routes duv has the size and speed to do it
stretch zone offense is the next step up for lamar im going to guess thats the next direction turns out hollywood brown is just another travon austin
ive noticed weve got a lot of international fans here and i was wondering what folks thought
why do new accounts post absolute rubbish in this sub
thought about what
so i keep seeing people calling hollywood a blazing speedster still waiting for that speed to show up

edit looks like people are getting a little defensive of hollywood a couple points

1 im rooting for the guy to be a great player but he wont get any faster and will have to do it as a route running specialist

2 hes not that fast get over it thats not a hot take just the objective truth he lost speed after his foot injury and hasnt regained it to draft a desean jackson type with a 1st rnd pick without top end speed isnt a great pick as someone else said on the thread daniel jones had reached a higher top speed than hollywood lol last week he couldnt seperate from tj watt
he didnt exactly look slow on tuesday when he scored a 70yd td but i get it its fashionable to shit on hollywood

edit a word
ahh never change baltimore
i agree that he didnt look super fast on that play but i think we need to give him the benefit of the drought on this play because he scored he may have been able to run faster but it would have been harder to make that double move he did to escape minkah he may have seen that minkah had a advantageous angle on him and so slowed down a bit to be able to put minkah in a bad position but yeah i would also like to see a play in which he just burns everyone else on the field
people forget the norm is for wrs to take a few years to fully develop in the league

freaks like dk aj and terry mc are not the norm

i would bet if you put brown in another offense with more passing weapons he would look better

it is just easy to shit on him now which is kinda bs
you forgot the s
hes not that fast no he is he isnt used properly
didnt he hit like 19mph last game
that extra weight he put on has made him look a bit slower
looks like he lost it dude didnt look fast on the steeler td
was taking to another fan on twitter jasonnyboy and made a point that i hadnt thought about but what if we move brown to the slot put dez boykin out wide
im not worried about the speed but i dont see any elusiveness he was programmed to fall down last year during his lisfranc recovery and he hasnt kicked that habit this year
hollywood would be an amazing receiver if they used a nerf football
he is fast though you are watching the nfl right
it really wouldve been nice to see him open it up and beat all the angles down the sideline on that long td instead of having to make a move back into the field to score apparently he didnt even crack 20mph according to the next gen stats there are plenty of guys that would break 2223mph with that much open space so not sure if he felt he didnt need to or if he is actually lacking the next gear that hes had in the past im hoping he just went as fast as he needed to and has more in the tank
why do they call hollywood cause hes from florida

titans jersey look hideous but the saints looks like a good jersey
shade of purple is off a bit looks closer to pink
thanks i hate it dont stop
what about ravens jersey with other colour schemes ive always been a big fan of the blues like the panthers or the chargers

i dont think it has to be said that even so much as a thought of creating some ravens steelers mix would get you excommunicated
these kind of remind me of the hockey fights cancer jerseys which id be all for with the nfl or even that dope color stripe pattern

plus if the game had been played on thanksgiving as originally scheduled that would have been their 3rd game in 12 days since they played the on sunday the last two weeks they were literally scheduled to play 3 games in 12 days on the original schedule
imagine being 110 and still complaining actually i could probably see that from people in this sub too
teams that have played 3 games in 12 days or less this year

miami dolphins

jacksonville jaguars

denver broncos

new york jets

tampa bay buccaneers

chicago bears

tennessee titans x2

buffalo bills

new york giants

philadelphia eagles

atlanta falcons

carolina panthers

green bay packers

san francisco 49ers

indianapolis colts

arizona cardinals

seattle seahawks

pittsburgh fuck the steelers

baltimore ravens


the nfl is clearly against all of them
people in the original thread already mentioned it but this steelers writer is saying this as if this is something that only happens to the steelers implying theyre getting screwed when it literally happens every week theres a thursday night game
removed
why is this on the ravens sub
cant believe the steelers are playing 3 games in 12 days the last time they did that you have to go all the way back to 2019 before that 2018 before that 2016 before that 2015

fuck the steelers
kaboly is a dumb dumb and i refuse to believe otherwise

the guy always has really bad takes
right now this team is living in our head rentfree
ok theres some important context missing from this title which id like to explain here

during a normal nfl season every team gets at least one stretch of their schedule where they play 3 games in 12 days this plays out as a sunday sundaythursday stint however its important to note that this 3 game stretch is always followed by a 10 day layoff before the next game usually referred to as the minibye so while its true that every team faces this situation at least once per season some twice they always get a mini bye afterward to recuperate teams also know about it in advance which helps with planning

in the steelers situation things ended up happening in reverse if the game had been played on thanksgiving as originally scheduled that would have been their 3rd game in 12 days and followed by the expected 10 day layoff however with the game being postponed that changed how this played out had the game been played on sunday it would have just been like a typical game week and you wouldnt be seeing these complaints when the game was postponed to wednesday it created a scenario where the team would play 3 games in 12 days except they would not get the 10 day layoff afterward that typically comes with it now this would not have been a problem if the steelers had known about the delay in advance as they could have used the extra days on the front end as a mini bye unfortunately due to the game being pushed back to sunday first instead of immediately to tuesday or wednesday pittsburgh had to assume they were playing and practice as normal rather than rest

this may not seem like a big deal but these periods of rest are extremely important for professional football players due to the abuse their bodies endure in games pittsburgh was not only not afforded that rest in this scenario they were also not afforded it when the titans game was moved since it happened so late in the week

i know this is long winded i just felt it was important to explain that this is not the same as what normally happens with 3 game stretches and implying they are equal is deliberately misleading

tldr kaboly is an idiot

like 90 of the posts you make get removed lol
nice try troll
do you think its appropriate to have lamar jackson to continue to play quarterback or to switch to halfback completely

oh man another surface level person who thinks theyve figured it all out just because were not going 142 this year

how quickly people turn on a player that we want to develop if this is a real take you need to study everything that made last year a success and compare it to this year its not even close to theyve figured lamar out bandwagon fans man
i think youre onto something here lets put lamar at hb and see how he gets on i reckon we swap him with ingram and he can play qb hes had two direct snaps this year but that should be okay he fumbled one but we all make mistakes
guys im turning 11 tomorrow can you at least say happy birthday

serious question if the starter and backup qb go down during a game is sam next in line to play qb

edit he is espn has a nice article on the likely emergency qb for each team
trace can pass 70 yards with his hands but sam can pass 70 yards with his feet
im all in on mcsorley getting the dal start if lamar cant go id like to get more of a look to get a feel if he can be the backup next year and allow us to move on from rg3
this photo looks like hes doing a no look pass koch did it before mahomes
i mean hes got a ring
the nfls goat passer
the ravens record go brrrr
so is lamar gonna play tuesday
not only does koch have a perfect completion percentage hes also posted two seasons with a perfect qbr insane
who is that
i miss jaleel scott
i meanyou might not actually be wrong at this point
if anything like most of our young receivers we have failed boykin the guy went to school with claypool and had similar if not better stats than he did when they played together something doesnt add up
he rarely gets passes thrown his way yet somehow weve given up on the guy as a receiver smh

if things go our way and roman is fired who would yall like to see hired as oc personally i like the idea of promoting rb coach matt weiss since we usually go with an in house hiring
ive not been on the fire roman train until that interception against the steelers why

it was the same fucking play as the last pick 6 against the steelers not only that it was proches only snap of the game in fact his only snap against pittsburgh last time was again the same fucking play oh and guess what proches only snap against the titans same play roman wtf stop running the same play with the same receiver in the same situation 3rd and 5 ish you fucking predictable cunt

but i digress roman needs to go his scheme is that of a 5 year old his play calling is even worse honestly im not opposed of firing him right now

i dont really know who we should hire but i wouldnt hire a rb coach to be offensive coordinator when our issues are in the passing game
in the nfl

mike mcdaniels niners run game cooordinator
darrell bevell former seahawks offensive coordinatorcurrent lions interim hc
tom clements former packers offensive coordinator current cardinals passing coordinator
mike lafleurniners passing game coordinator
jeff stoutland eagles run game coordinatoroffensive line coach
luke getsy packers passing game coordinatorqb coach former
rick dennison current vikings run game coordinator offensive line coach former ravens qb coach
dave canales seahawks passing game coordinatorqb coach



x200b

in college

kevin wilson current ohio st offensive coordinatorte coach former indiana hc
i dont know enough about current college coaches to suggest any reasonable options there no lincoln riley will not leave oklahoma to be our oc but from the ranks of nfl offensive assistants some options could be

mike mcdaniel 49ers run game coordinator

mike lafleur 49ers pass game coordinator

harold goodwin buccaneers ol coachrun game coordinator

mike kafka chiefs passing game coordinator

dave canales seahawks passing game coordinator
not necessarily who i want but

if doug pederson gets fired by the eagles i could see him coming here he and harbaugh have that andy reid connection from their days with the eagles even if theres a degree of separation between the two i know they did joint practices in training camp before so theres definitely a connection there and we love to bring in retreads at oc seems like a harbaugh move similar to when he brought in former eagles oc mornhinweg
find me a 39 year old coach at a d3 college whose rbs average like 18 yards a rush

we all know theres this tendency for coaches to get coaching jobs because theyre coaches so they must know how to coach the nfl is the ultimate meritocracy but coaching is an old boys club

my sense is that the kyle shanahans and sean mcvays arent that uncommon theyre smart creative guys who understand the game and innovate on it because theyre not attached to how things have always been done but theyre not the only ones theyre just the only ones who managed to get into a position to prove that to us i think the barriers to entry for nfl coaching are so tremendous for someone who doesnt have connections that there must be an absolute goldmine out there if only you can find it

id love to keep roman on and launch a gigantic search to find one of those guys i have no idea how but im convinced its possible we have a guy with a proven track record whos struggling to take the next step lets leave him in place and bring up a pass game assistant to help him develop the pass game until we find the guy once we do and were sure weve got it right lets pay him so much money that his family wont let him leave for a hc job
ryan day osu

cutcliffe duke

mike leach miss st apparently lol

scott frost nebraska

can i get kubiak back
to the people saying we need a passing game coordinator we have one his name is david culley

if roman goes my money is on him getting promoted no idea if hes good or not but thats what id bet on
no idea who would be available that would be perfect for lamar roman had that back ground in working with qbs with ability to use their legs not so sure there is another nfl oc with that kind of background i would almost want them go the college route potentially
pep hamilton from la would be an interesting look experience as an oc and hes doing great things with herbert and the la passing offense
none of harbaughs choices should even be considered
i pray to god harbaugh is smart enough to see the writing on the wall romans track record is well established at this point we got what we wanted out of him and he is not a coach that can adapt


plus his face is so fucking punchable
id like to look for a college run heavy coach with experience in mobile qbs like lamar and please this time make sure he can actually adjust instead of just doing whatever it is roman does
this entire thread is incredibly dumb

where was all the roman hate last year he ran the same plays

the fact that there is a thread about firing the 2019 assistant coach of the year because he couldnt win a wednesday afternoon football in december with 2nd and 3rd stringers without practice against an undefeated rival at their place is laughable

you all are what have you done for me lately guess what were not playing up to our preseason expectations in the craziest season in memory if it werent for a couple plays on both sides of the ball and calls by the referees the ravens are a 101 football team and none of you have anything to say about this play calling we have a winning record with the easiest remaining schedule in the league for crying out loud

if being an offensive coordinator is so easy why dont some of you start coaching according to this thread we have a bunch of high quality coaches here im willing to bet all you reddit couch qbs have never coached competitive football in your life let alone have sat down with college and nfl coaches and watched film with them as they describe how detailed their thought process is play calling is a process and an art that is so difficult to truly master sometimes shit doesnt work out and there are off days after reading this thread it appears you all have been perfect day in and day out at your jobs its not nearly easy as it looks even in high school

moving on to these suggestions
1 mcdaniels has lived in shannahans shadow and has yet to call an nfl play
2 bevel the lions offense has been trash this year and if hes so good why did he leave seattle
3 clements working under kliff who ran all the same stuff at texas tech
4 lafleur well play the same game as we did with mcdaniels but wait hes got an older brother
5 stoutland eagles run game coordinator lol cmon man that offense is atrocious
6 getsy best option so far but tough to look bad with aaron rogers
7 dennison if he was so good whyd we let him go
8 canales that offense is just as up and down and russell has a completely different skill set
9 wilson cmon now this is the nfl were not playing purdue and illinois im sure hes a fine coach but not offensive coordinator at this stage

roman is a proven play caller that is built to run the offense that was given to him mobile quarterback decent line good rbs and subpar receivers doesnt take much to look at the kaepernick led 49ers andor tyrod led bills
and qb coach james urban was michael vicks guru in philly to earn him comeback player of the year in 2020

we all agree the passing game is lacking thats not gregs fault why not get on decosta and the scouting department for continually drafting poor receiving talent the steelers seem to be doing just fine in that department yet year in and year out we miss the run game is great but when you lose yanda stanley and ingram things are going to be a little different

people hate ravens fans across the country because of threads like this we need to appreciate what we have good lord we could be the team 45 minutes south of us relax lamar is in his 3rd year for crying out loud

go ahead and down vote this comment away but this is ridiculous if you genuinely want him gone

tldr roman is not to blame and wed be dumb to fire him

i mean this is literally exactly what i be saying verbatim
fuck are you me
i mean i think the lot of us agree

honestly if you didnt put elite dragon in the title id have sworn that was an ornament of ryan mink or garrett downing
he looks like dudley doright
im pretty sure thats the ultra elite dragon sam koch perfect completion percentage

best news of the day i was definitely worried about andrews the most
mandrews not having severe symptoms is the best case scenario covid and diabetes are a fucked up combo
orlando brown jr said hes been talking with both lamar jackson and mark andrews said both are doing well and looking forward to getting back in the building

really relieved to hear andrews is doing well its not as bad as type 2 diabetes but covid can still have a lot of complications for type 1 diabetics iirc

anyone heard about calais he has asthma so hes higher risk too
it feels like an entire new season defense got a fire lit under them hopefully a bunch of players coming back need to turn it up these last 5 games against the easier section of our schedule and anything can happen if we get into the playoffs

im not trying to sound arrogant or like i know were going to dominant or anything like that but were going to see what this team is truly made of when it really really matters
im just excited for a turnaround been a tough month with injuries covid and 4 close losses in 5 games
well im only excited because were back to the easy part of the schedule and frankly losing at this point isnt an option if anything was going to kick this team in gear that should be it

but with so many players with covid im still not super optimistic that we will be full strength come tuesday

we really need lamar to come back ready and the run game to be on point dallas has a week defense and its time the offense find its stride and help our defense out im hoping dez is ready for his breakout game against his former team

peanut and fumble
obj and landry
bark andrews and jk dogbins
edgar and allen
fruit and punch
hector and achilles dude would get clowned for naming his dogs after teammates ok for us normies though
lamar and jackson
browns and receivers
obj landry juju
decosta and goose tony g



view poll
after the steelers game i gained some back before i thought all hope was lost
i do in the players but not in the offensive scheme and coordinator
objectively speaking most of our lives will remain unaffected whether they trend down or up given this id rather invest the energy i put into being a fan in a positive way

tldr

bigtruzz
i have confidence that well make the playoffs any and all games played in january will have me extremely anxious
i believe they ravens should really start doing what some teams do in the nfl and that is quick passing its painful watching our wrs run plain routes and of course not getting open as a result we need to take advantage of db playing zone on guys and quickly give them the ball the titans game 2 weeks ago for example dez was always open as butler was playing him out and it took us to the end of the game to figure out we can get yards giving him the ball even the announcers made a comment on it

lamar holding on the ball with these garbage screen plays need to go its no surprise lamar is getting sacked when we have him running plays where he holds on the ball for 5 seconds he should only have that ball for 2 seconds

end of the story look at mahomes no im not trying to compare lamar to mahomes but the success mahomes is having with quick passing is intriguing i just dont see why we cant run these plays it seems so fitting for a guy like lamar jackson
mahomes goes down the field ben is the quick passer but harbaugh also doesnt believe in things like rub routes
ive been pounding the table for a deebo samuel aj brown laviska shenault type player just throw screens and slants throw some bunch formations and picks in the mix and boom a short passing game that can result in big chunk plays

we need someone besides lamar that can turn nothing into something we might have it in dobbins now lets get another at wr
do quick passes

you misspelled run the fucking ball
they dont do that at all because lamar is still in the sit in the pocket until the seem opens for him to run or take the sack mentality if they ran a hurry up or a quick pass offense they would absolutely get guys are hard counts with the threat of the run game or the quick pass coming but they dont
id probably improve our offensive output and ill take that however i can get it but i find those kind of plays so boring if theres no yac its just snap throw catch and tacklefall theyre over so quick with nothing cool happening
somethings gotta change in our wr department we need some outside hires from the chiefs or others steelers but doubt any of them would comesteelers would let them join us

on the flip side they have been amazing at drafting dl like us
we also just rarely spend high picks on wrs
its not the scouting its the coaching that makes our wrs so bad
yeah its been 25 years of sucking at drafting receivers lol torrey smith is the most successful wr they drafted
its the coaching look at perriman now he is a better receiver now then he ever was with us in fact there were people in this sub saying they would take him over brown

we cant develop these guys hollywood would be a killer on another team in fact i would even say that hollywood has regressed since being coached by the ravens he had better technique last year and coming out of college we need to address this issue first before anything changes
we werent particularly good before they took them the best we drafted were stokley and torrey
i mean im not sure the eagles have been much better at drafting wrs
i feel like we dont talk enough about the culture

i think the defense has always been good because of the longevity of the positional coaching staff and the culturework ethic that comes from the players if you are a linebacker or dlineman its very much a meritocracy your draft position doesnt matter just give it your all every day because weve had starters come in from all sources i think the stars weve had in ray and suggs helped create that environment

on the wr front weve never had a home grown talent to make that culture and currently have a bunch of journeymen or young guys our wr core has gotten better in the past when we had a vet join like anquan i dont think torrey does what he did for us without q if you look at our wr room now who are these guys following no one is setting the tone and has proven what it takes to be a regular starcontributor in the league im hoping dezs work ethic can translate to that even if he lost a step that to me is more valuable than anything
no team has ran the ball in the last 1015 years more than us doesnt really matter who we put at wr harbs and co seem insistent on being a run 1st team which will naturally make it harder to break out as a receiver
we were always ass at it

dont call it a comeback
ingram is on a hard decline he should be mentoring dobbins

edit he hasnt cleared covid list as well

lot of info there rgiii to ir is the one that sticks out or was that known
averett season is in full efffffect
a few thoughts

if wednesday was the last time robert griffin iii suits up in a ravens uniform hats off to this organization for rekindling rgiiis love and passion for football and major props to rgiii for helping and mentoring lamar jackson ever since he was a rookie

getting anthony averett back is huge especially now that jimmy smith will probably miss a few weeks a combo of averett tramon williams and even davontae harris is a solid trio behind humphrey and peters and is definitely much better than when khalil dorsey and terrell owens barry bonds were the only other active corners for a few weeks when smith returns the ravens will be close to the level of depth they had in the secondary before the season started

i wonder how the oline will look this week you have to imagine the ravens were very impressed with trystan coloncastillo against the steelers that they would like to roll with him at center that said and with any changes to the left side of the line being extremely unlikely who gets the nod at right guard and tackle i can see it being ben powers and patrick mekari respectively i feel thats the best its going to get with the offensive line at this point a line consisting of brownbozemancoloncastillopowersmekari from left to right
holy shit chris moore is finally on the field this year
so luke wilson is part of the 53 man permanently ugh hopefully after really getting some practice time in hell be more effective but based off wednesday im not excited about it
thank god we have averett back im sorry buddy ill appreciate you for now on

throw it on a dime
isnt there a chance lamar is ready for tuesday i thought i read that he might be through covid protocol in time but i dont know if im remembering that correctly or if its accurate
lamar will dominate and destroy dallas
dont disrespect the franchise qb like that he throws it on a dime like he aint even trying
lauren with another banger
rg3 had maybe 2 good plays he shouldnt be playing we been knowing hes not a good player just a good mentor trace should of gotten the start it was an l from the start give the rookie a chance to develop a bit
im seeing things where he hasnt been activated can he be activated by tuesday and mccarthy said hes ready for lamar
he can be if he doesnt test positive again he should be ready just in time
i think it probably depends on how hes feeling physically
if hes not we are fucked our backups are terrible that includes mcsworley one lucky play doesnt change that fact
i havent heard anything but i doubt it covid19 lasts a lot longer than the flu

thats what mine looks like but i have it properly colored

followup tweet of course as baltimore showed with its running backs last week being eligible doesnt necessarily mean youll play robert griffin iii landed on injured reserve today so if jackson cant go itd be trace mcsorley against dallas
i have a hard time seeing us not playing lamar its not quite the same as not playing ingram or dobbins because we also didnt have lamar or a full oline and the rest of the team was decimated unless lamar is physically ill he has to be ready to go right
honestly with our defense and run game i would feel pretty good about our chances with trace against the cowboys if need be
honestly i just hope lamar is ok cuz i dont wanna have him get sick or injured
ravens qb lamar jackson is eligible to be activated from the reservecovid19 list with medical clearance on sunday im told baltimore faces the cowboys on tuesday

please i need some hope

honestly dont know how much of a better passer lamar is than trace

damn is that the end of the road for him i went to training camp before last season rgiii had just broken his hand he stood off to the side and shadowed every single qb drill and even the full team scrimmages working on his drops footwork and throwing motion you could see his desire to get better i really respected that
man is cursed i feel so bad for him
you know i always liked this guy as a qb if i were him i would have flat out murdered shanahan for ending my career
well there is rg3s career as a raven or even the last for the nfl had its up and downs but sure as hell had us all excited trace mcsorley welcome to qb2 kid

added note
crazy how in 1 week your future in the nfl can change completely man i love this game
lovely s
i thought ir is only 3 weeks
rob played his fucking ass off for us sacrificed his body because of it
yeah if he isnt on the active roster next year id love to see them try to get him on the staff somehow i know rgiii wants to play but hes a phenomenal leader id love to see stay involved somehow
ravens qb robert griffin iii thigh is out for the season as the ravens get more players off the reservecovid19 list

lol jesus
rg3 was a complete shithead those first couple years dude came down to earth hard and did all the right things to get back in the league and has been a role model since the dude did things the right way instead of guys like manziel or jamarcus who just wanted shit handed back to them kudos rg3 youre a raven in my book
least surprising news ever sign kaepernick

not if you subscribe to pff
queen has been disappointing so far in his early career lackluster read and react speed constant misreading of run fits gets washed out of plays and rarely sheds blocks

easily confused in coverage by crossers and picks this isnt to say he cant improve but from watching the film on him he has a long way to go i personally think malik harrison has outplayed him by far
i see a lot of great stuff in this guys future he is learning but he does have a lot of heart
if you think queen has been the best lb out of the draft you need to rewatch some games and you will see hes still very much a rookie hes missing his reads not filling gaps and his coverage hasnt been great he has the raw talent just need the game to slow down for him and he will be able to be a difference maker


this sentiment might not play well here but for as hard as the ravens played the steelers made it easy for them tomlins right they sucked
this made me like him ever so slightly more
tomlins a good coach thats the problem
with his move to the ir and the limited success of trace mcsorely i assume that was the last time we will see rg3 in a ravens uniform big respect to a great teammate and raven he may not have been spectacular on the field but hes been an amazing presence on the team and has done a lot for the baltimore community as well

thank you rob youll always be a true raven
if rg3 doesnt play next year or beyond i think hes got a future in coaching esp at the college level or announcinganalysis in some ways i think hes been a spiritual leader of the team even if he wasnt really leading on the field ive never heard an awkward press conference from him he always speaks with authority and poise and a lot of what he says is genuinely insightful people talk about ingram being a potential announcer but i dont think he has the analytical mind for it rg3 does i could see him playing a similar role to what michael vick has been doing lately
he seems like a good guy and im glad he got a chance rg3 is an example of why sports can be a bitch he has the heart but not the body id say it has been a big plus to have him on the team and i wish him well elsewhere
i hope hes not done as a raven and gets a chance next year but hey theres always the jets former raven squad hes the perfect mentor for lamar and he seems like a really stand up guy now really matured since his younger days glad he got a 2nd wind for his career here and that we got to rg3 so many teams in the 4th quarter last year wishing him well
ive never seen a player so excited to get kn the field even when it was just a play here and there back when we ran that heisman package and lamar had no business pitching the ball but did anyways just because he knew how badly rg3 wanted it i feel bad for the guy but hopefully what he showed in the last game was enough for a team to take a chance on him doubt it but i think he still really wants to play
i love the man and wish him nothing but the best but im not sure that rg3 keeps the backup roll greg roman and the lack of starters didnt do him any favors but i think the spark that trace had in the 4th pretty much iced rg3s backup roll i am excited to see where his career takes him but i dont think itll be quarter backing a greg roman offense i do think he has talent and more to offer but it just wasnt connecting even when he would step in last year to finish out games there wasnt much granted they didnt want him slinging the ball around im the 4th while having giant leads
its the least we can do lol we ruined his career
bad timing for me buying that rg3 jersey
i would love to have rg3 back he is an awesome guy to have around just like ingram id honestly be sad to see either guy go just bc there such great teammates
part 12

i think griffin will get an opportunity to compete for a spot somewhere next year if he wants to im not saying hed necessarily make that team but i dont see why he couldnt come into training camp with a team

however if he has money in the bank and a future career or a calling of some sort in art charity or activism beyond football or as a coach or an analyst in mind this might not be a bad opportunity to go out on his own terms after having come back and shown that he could be a good team player and at least hang in the league as a backup despite losing his legs figuratively speaking

injuries and poor performance cut his career short in washington and cleveland and then he seemed done after no one would sign him to play anywhere on an nfl roster in 2017 to tack 3 years on to that moving up from third string to backup for a quality franchise like the ravens with no rumors of backstage intrigue or of him trying to undermine joe flacco for the one year they played together or lamar jackson but from what we know being a supportive teammate in the film room and helping jackson adjust to life in the nfl and be a better player instead of undermining him or keeping his own counsel hoping to win jacksons job is impressive

in a way i think this has been a bigger accomplishment for him as a football player and a man than his early success

he came into the league a very hyped player with a ton of endorsements who i think struck some people as arrogant although it wasnt necessarily true and as succeeding based on pure talent rather than football iq also not necessarily true theres a long history of people often unfairly stereotyping young africanamerican quarterbacks in that way frankly as a ravens fan i wasnt following what was going on with a middlingatbest nfc team closely enough to judge for myself whether the description some had of him was accurate or people falling back on a stereotype

he came back in a role a lot of people who came up the way he did would have been too humble to take a tryout to be a third stringer behind a former super bowl mvp and a new first round draft pick making him not only the 3rd stringer but a guy who neither the current starter or the future starter on a team that had people slated for both roles already and he never complained about it or gave any sign he was doing anything other than his best to keep himself and his teammates prepared he showed that even though he couldnt run the way he used to he could hang enough for the front office and the coaching to be comfortable with him in the second and third years of his ravens tenure as the backup on a team that looked at itself as a super bowl contended the last couple years at a key position where a lot of injuries occur around the league behind a running quarterback who no matter how careful is always going to be just a little more at risk of injury than a pocket passer the more you run the more you can get hit

i remember talking with a relative who was and is a fan of washington theres no accounting for taste and when i mentioned griffin lining up at receiver and faking a sweep like he meant it my relative was shocked being willing to do stuff like that and play it all through was not the reputation he had in washington apparently but he did it in baltimore not everyone would

i remember another quarterback who when split out wide stuck his hands in his fanny pack looking disgusted and not even halfway running a route hed just stand there sullenly at the line of scrimmage for the entire play then hed complain about it in press conferences after games arguing that there was no play where the team wasnt better off without him up under center and that you didnt see tom brady being asked to split out wide long after it was apparent that while perhaps he was better than the statistics showed he was no tom brady to be fair thats a good thing in some ways no cheating with deflated footballs no sliding and then kicking a safety in the shins after the whistle

im not trying to start an argument about that quarterback thats why im ommitting his name who i have some fond memories of but im just mentioning that guys bad moment to show what griffin could have been like all the time and maybe some would claim was like early in his career and was the polar opposite of in baltimore

i think when rg3 came to baltimore he in a lowkey way was reported to be going by rob it wasnt i think a way of drawing attention for him but rather a way to come back as a normal guy and politely deflect attention so he could do his job and be a good teammate i think rob griffin may well have been a better more mature person that rg3

he didnt complain that we didnt work him into the offense in a slash role he didnt complain about anything at least not publicly

this is who he built himself into when arguably his biggest strengths that led him to his early success were gone and a lot of guys would have given up on football

i agree that the ravens may well move on to mcsorely who is younger probably better at this point probably cheaper and who was brought in and kept around with the idea of being ljs backup probably with this percise timing in mind the ravens traditionally havent carried a third qb that trace has been there tells me they have always had a plan for him probably as ljs longterm backup as long as his play in practice justified it

i think the idea may have been in part that griffin might have worked himself in competing for a starting job with another team or being a backup for a team with a starter who seems more likely to get benched or else would maybe be in the situation he seems to be in now but either way that this coming off season would likely be his transition point
dude showed a lot of heart trying to play through that hammy pullseemingly biggerbetter layers have sidelined themselves for way less
really feel bad because i wanted him to be able to showcase himself
part 22 this starts getting a bit nonrg3 related but it was originally typed right as the second part of my rg3 comment in the thread i ran into some space limits and had to split it up

the ravens also may want to start carrying a third string qb again of a different sort lj is the reigning nfl mvp his job is not in danger in 2020 or 2021 even though his play has been a bit disappointing at times this season mcsorelys potential promotion to backup this offseason is likely going to be in part specifically because hed make a good backup to jackson

however knowing that running qbs only rarely have success past the first 510 years and sometimes burn out even earlier drafting a third stringer with a big arm who rolls our a bit might not be a bad idea as a cheap longterm insurance policy if a time comes where we are looking that way remember the idea of a last day of the draft rookie as a third string qb next year is not likely done with the idea of him playing next year its a longterm maneuver one lesson of rg3 is that a qb who relies on his legs who loses even the smallest fraction of that speed due to injury which can come at any time will not always be able to beat nfl defenses anymore which are extremely fast covid19 has been shown to in some people cause some permanent heart and lungs damage equivalent to an average first heart attack he needs those lungs and thats what lj is out with and if he gets past it with no changes hes always a play away from that big acl injury or whatever

if a strong armed third string qb is good and good under pressure he could even conceivably be brought into games where the ravens are down big late to try to move the team way down field fast with his arm hed still not be the guy to come in if lj gets hurt during the week or in the middle of a tight game but there could be some value to this hypothetical guy as sort of a comeback specialist

i dont think the nfl has any restrictions on third string qbs anymore it used to be that youd get an extra gameday active if you made it a third string emergency qb but that if that emergency qb ever entered the game the starter and the backup could not reenter the game now there is i think just an extra gameday active for whomever a team wants at whatever position they want instead no such thing as a designated emergency qb with special restrictions if you want to make him active you can bring him in for anything you want special plays at qb designed for him in special situations where he comes in and then comes out when the situation changes lining him up at halfback and doing a halfback toss lining him up at wr whatever that doesnt keep you from bringing the starter back in or from using your top backup if your starter gets hurt or is ineffective you can put three qbs on one play these days if you want to

itll also be interesting to see where they go with the offense next year in terms of the playbook whether its greg roman still handling it or someone else the league has clearly again adjusted to lj in some respects and well need to make the next move to break their system and see if they can crack the next one or maybe its a personnel thing i could see a big bruising oldtime first round pick rb who can barrel over the safeties teams are lining up as part of their defensive front sevens forcing opposing teams to choose between either using a more traditional defense lj can run wild on or the stop lj scheme with all the defensive backs playing linebackers who would struggle to bring down a world class power running back who could eek out at least 5 yards on that formation almost every time as he drags several dbs playing linebacker most of those yards before they can bring him down

obviously jackson also still has some work to do in the passing game but hes only a 3rd year guy and seemed to have it mostly figured out in 2019 we can keep working with him on that and maybe give him a nice solid possession receiver who specializes in fighting for contested balls and a strong healthy offensive line

not saying lj needs it but i could see a sort of offseason coach wed recommend or a good passing qb whos retired working with him on throwing mechanics and just passing and reading defenses all offseason

i also wonder if we might consider more iformation and proset with or without the fullback and less pistol formation and shotgun formation
hes been a great guy to have around for lamar to learn from and hes been really surprisingly comfortable in this role with the ravens hes still got it thats clear he just got a tough break out there i hope he gets a shot somewhere a real shot his whole career hes been denied the opportunity to really show what he can do it helps that he no longer has a head coach determined to watch his quarterback die out there
uuhmmmm no

delete this nephew

nobody had to see it
anakin vs vader transformation
i have been a ravens fan for life but only recently really watched and followed the team i wasnt there for the lewisreed vs polamaluharrison days so i understood the rivalry but didnt really feel it myself but now this season i fucking hate the steelers
why he look so chubby lol
it makes sense they already had the gameplan from vick being there
removed
swept yall last year but different between us and yall is we arent insecure enough to go on your shitty ass sub enjoy the toothless women in shitsburg
okay
lol u better hope u dont link up with us in the playoffs even if u avoid us the chiefs will sodomize yall bills gonna merc u in 2 week as well have fun while it last bro

controversial tweets gets people riled and then gets tractions thats why you never like or retweet this bullshit
any person who slightly has a brain that watched the game on wednesday can clearly see how bad this team is without jackson yes jackson has mistakes in games but after that shit show of an offense no one should question him
everyone hates on lamar but he was severely missed last week
id say 90 percent of the people rt are doing it for the memes the other 10 percent are just dumb af
749 idiots exist
i never understood why people on twitter do this people are always going to like something more than they will retweet it
its ridiculous trace made one good throw hollywood added 60 yards of yac we might win 2 more games this season with trace at the helm
hes thrown 6 passes and were seeing this
what the fuck
whoever believes this garbage deserves fan duel to steal their money from them
the amount of people here not realizing that most of the retweets are most likely a joke is kind of sad
lmao the smooth brains getting mad at this youre being trolled welcome to the internet
kyle boller
im not saying trace mcsorley isnt a good qb but lamar is better trace throwing one td is nice but lamar has thrown quite a few tds and many more if trace mcsorley gets to start which he wont i would be soooooo mad and sad for lamar
shouldnt fanduel be out there convincing children that gambling is safe and fun

how do they have time for this
this is insane trace throws incompletions get koch in there now
ah yes lets start a 7th rounder project qb over a generational athlete with a proven record of winning trace has value since we dont need to modify the playbook for him but this is chalk and cheese and i say that as a penn state fan
in the comments they said this was an obvious joke so take with grain of salt
if it was for the dallas game hed have an argument but going forward yall tripping
what if we used them both and mcsorely becomes our taysom hill but better the leagues head would explode
i mean we all know its a joke right lets not be steelers fans and get butthurt about jokes now guys lol
trace is a dope ass back upback up he could start somewhere but not here

nope harbaugh is being hush hush about it
dobbins was already off the list but he was just activated today
campbell skura and mekari should be back

lamar ricard cox and madubuike have a very small chance of playing

andewssnead and judon wont be back
everyone but sneed andrews and judon can be back and i expect them to all be back
why has this never been brought up
rig the coin toss and we win the super bowl simple
cause when we receive we often go 3 and out and then it puts us behind if the other team scores cause they get it at half
i said this 2 months ago on twitter lol also it happened in the playoffs the past 2 years and the chiefs and browns game last year
back in the flacco days it always felt like the team came alive during the second half both the defense and the offense i feel like this isnt exactly whats happening here but it might be related
every single week i text my buddies this i have predicted that we win or lose based off this obviously thats not the case but i get an absolutely terrible feeling when we get the ball first
what a fucking stat
this is actually really fucking interesting


lamar jacksonville wtf
hes so fetch
i like lj
lamar lamar jackson jackson

his only nickname is action jackson
its not going to happen
l freaky is the only acceptable l nickname
what is lamar jackson
my favorite is lamatrix


cuz hes a glitch
ljack
this person needs to stop lmao
if he loses to the jaguars im going to call him ljax too bad that wont happen

favorite game last season
take me back
that felt like years ago
this game really solidified that lj was the mvp frontrunner right here
goddamn i hate the waiver system absolutely broken but i hope he falls to bmore
who lol
he has 36 catches in a 4 year career i think were already chock full of aaaa players on the backend of the roster
for someone who had a lion in fantasy marvin hall was frustrating for seemingly constantly coming out of nowhere with long touchdowns taking points from me at this point any receiver good enough to see the field for another team should be on our radar
sorry if any of these questions have been addressed usually keep up with the forum and didnt see any of these answered also i think harbaugh is keeping these things on the dl

x200b

is big babbycampbell returning in time to play the browns this is huge considering the browns are ahead of us chubb hunt are admittingly some dawwwwgs

x200b

does powers continue to start at rg or does tyre come back start against dallas also does fluker return in time for the browns game i know hes not the best rt but he is the best we have dont mean to look passed dallas but we should beat them


moving forward do we see dobbins as the main back hopefully so plain and simple

x200b

lastly i really hope elliot yucky chucky are good to go next tuesday both were limping by the end of the game chuck was on zrebiecs injury report we will see
1 yes they will both be back
2 philips was activated off ir already
3 dobbins will most likely see more carries down the stretch the benefit of having ingram still in rotation is now we have 4 fresh backs that can all take a lead role going down the back of the season to playoffs hopefully one of them gets hot in the process
like my gran papi always said caw caw
1 both williams are campbell are older and very big im hoping they will be back for the browns but there is no guarantee wolfe has stepped up in a big way in their absence

2 tyre phillips and fluker both stink i wouldnt be surprised to see a line of brown boze colon mekari holden

3 i think dobbins will be the guy

its because people cant be responsible adults
yea it sucks

i mean i dont get the statement just mcsorleywe have tyler huntley as well ready to be called up from the practice squad
we also have huntley who will get pulled up but will be inactive most likely unless lamar isnt back
i think tyler huntley could be legit kid has a big arm and is mobile af
we got plently of depth in the qb

if lamar cant play thats fine trace goes up with tyler as his back up
shouldve started last game then maybe we couldve won
i always thought is on ir was rgiii last name
kinda latebut gotta give props to practice squad player nick moore on his nfl debut and for smoothly filling in for morgan cox long snapping is actually much tougher than people realize and he excited flawlessly especially impressive given no real practice time for the last two weeks
he didnt send it over koch so hes a winner in my book
honorary wolfpack
saw him practicing 2 days prior to the game and dude was killing it was snapping the ball at a goal post and damn was he consistently getting loud pings it was an oddly beautiful symphony
what about tremon that 37 year old mfer played like an absolute beast
wolfling
i always thought it was weird the ravens kept protecting him and used up a spot for him on the practice squad but i remember the titans lost their ls to covid and it really threw them in a panic and zrebec used that as an example why we kept moore it proved to be a smart call in the end
nick moores burner on here posting fire content
i know this will be received poorly but at what point do we stop using steve saunders as a scapegoat he was absolutely the most egregious violator of covid protocols but i dont think he is alone harbs had some boneheaded comments earlier this year and now is under scrutiny for lack of oversight and then we see little blips of insight into players personal lives marlon got covid earlier this year and perhaps coincidentally always had instagram stories from bars and restaurants tonight he has more stories from bars and restaurants i dont know what its like to be an nfl player but i know what its like to be a professional during covid and these guys seem to take risks that i and my coworkers dont take which baffles me because their income is orders of magnitude above my own does anyone else feel frustrated with the entire team and how theyve managed the covid crisis
yeah its not just saunders its a really bad look for the whole team of course disappointed
you arent out of line at all

i think you are asking a lot of these kids to give them what is likely the biggest paycheck they have ever seen and then tell them to stay home every night
even more so when you considered they are in the prime of their live stronger and healthier than 90 of the population

marlon has cosigned the stupid shit trump says about covid on twitter so its not surprising from him also i agree the team is to blame just as much as that guy if he wasnt wearing a mask then that should have been addressed earlier not when nearly the entire team contracted covid honestly we should be disciplined for this
how about were in a fucking pandemic without a bubble in place you have better odds than ever of contracting it no matter who you are right now
you have a pointthe team has to be held responsible for letting saunders violate protocol so blatantly i wouldnt worry though i have no doubt that the league will take this opportunity to punish art modell posthumously im guessing that well have to give all of our 2021 draft picks to the steelers for daring to inconvenience them slightly oh and everyone will have to run 500 laps around the hall of fame while browns and bengals fans throw things at them this will backfire when some confused eaglesfan visitors to the hall decide to lend their extensive throwingthings experience to the crowd and wind up launching a tractortrailer into the building

im exaggerating of coursebut its gonna be harsh
not out of line just really late to the conversation people have been saying this over and over for 2 weeks
the surprising part is how he got access to the facility dont teams do temp checks at the door reports were that saunders was symptomatic which means a fever chances are the ravens had a total failure in basic protocols gonna guess the ravens get docked a 5th rd pick by the league

removed

he will hold the record by the end of next season
yeah snowflake the goat on defense
marlooooo
batman i think id expect batman to destroy me on a football field
username checks out
im thinking

titans vs browns ill be rooting for the titans cause if the browns lose that makes it that much more likely we get into the play offs
seahawks vs ny giants cause i love seahawks football

then of course primetime games
i gotta watch young justin herbert with unfortunately a handicap anthony lynn against the greatest coaching mind in football history
rooting for the raiders for jets fans sake also rooting for lac hou and got a weird feeling phillys gonna upset gb
browns vs titans should be good
falcons saints
dolphins and bengals im a dolphins fan as well

rooting for wtf to win the division i like their name lol
browns vs titans is definitely the matchup of the week

chubb vs henry is gonna be hella interesting

i mean that does look pretty damn good
ive always wanted to see a ravens player in the wild
disappointing but not surprising that a 24yearold with 100 million would be out of touch like this
fuck me we cant blame steve saunders anymore our team is obviously full of complete dipshits they deserve their football struggles for their irresponsibility towards society as a whole
serious question here and im sure ill get all the down votes but how is this much different than all the players they showed during commercials handing out turkeys to the public
dammit why

doctor robotnik sums up my feelings on this
bar vasquez is worth the risk
i understand the want to go out and live some sort of normality he also isnt breaking any current rules for eating out but if he cares about football and his team and the season for the love of god just stay in stay safe and give up going to a restaurant which lets be honest isnt that hard to do it really isnt he has enough money to hire a guy to cook him a 5 star meal and drop it off at his
jfc yall are actually insane as fuck stop trying to control peoples lives
honestly we gotta start penalizing and fining them

saunders for sure was the main culprit but when its multiple people doing this it gives the team a bad reputation more importantly people are literally dying from this
he already had it
you guys have never gone out once to eat

washingtonfootball de montez sweat runs off heinz field yelling i knew it i knew it i knew it when i ask chase young he says we all did baltimore exposed some things steelers

we didnt let them off the hook
we were understaffed our entire practice squad was activated and we still could not make a full game day roster
we still got swept though

all we exposed is that anyone who can outlast the refs can beat those scumbags
our defense will always make us proud theyre still one of the best defenses its just the offensive struggles that out weighs their performances
removed

a big concern of mine was that the steelers would pull their starters against the browns if they were 150 going into that game now if theyre 141 going into that game or 132 or whatever theyre not going to sit starters because they dont have the 1 seed locked and we need the steelers to beat the browns
do we need the browns to lose cant we get the second wild card anyway if we win out with expanded playoffs this year
but if the if they lose next week they can rest their starters because they could be locked into the 2 seed

doesnt matter anyways dolphins colts and raiders are the bigger threats
just win the next 5 everything else falls into place its very very unlikely we are shut out of the playoffs at 115
why the hell is everyone looking 4 games ahead lol we gotta win stop plz


lets do the thing throw 5 at the alex smith foundation alex smith shut up every steeler fan for at least a couple days we owe it to the wft to support a cause important to them

the alex smith foundation provides foster teens with the tools and resources needed to transition to successful adulthood by developing and promoting mentoring education housing internship job and advocacy programs
as a chiefs fan ravens chiefs bros i donated 11 remember something is better than nothing but bless this man for being amazing another reason chiefs and ravens fans can build a friendship love you all
my mother works closely with kids in foster care they come from some awful situations and are usually really good people this is a good cause
done
done we should start this trend with any qb that beats the steelers
awesome thanks for posting this
done

you guys are awesome for this i have never felt there was a rivalry between our teams despite what media says i have no problem rooting for ravens as my afc team fuck the steelers
done what a great cause

i wanna see what we do with marlon now that he doesnt have to babysit obj the whole game lockdown landry
ok guys they gotta win the next 5 games and those game are definitely 50 that gon be good if they end the season and going into the playoff with something to prove
remember when darren waller was addicted to that crack and now hes the best te in the league

just reaching for anything to convince them its a fluke and their team isnt just mediocre and coasting on refball and lucky bounces
have you even been on our sub most of us are memeing ourselves and talking about the loss realistically maybe the feed shows differently
funny how when anyone mentioned how our team has been riddled with injuries for weeks its been excuses but all im seeing from steelers fans is how injuries played such a big part in their loss

to be clear i would never wish injuries or sickness on anyone but its pretty interesting how they also have to keep eating their own words you guys have covid cases you should have to forfeit injuries are excuses and i have a feeling theyre gonna have to eat all the lol 1st seed 1 and done overrated bla bla bla from last year as well come playoffs
my favorite part is that my biggest steeler fan friend used to bitch and moan constantly that we would just dink n dunk and then have torrey draw dpis that is basically the whole steelers offense this year
i loved seeing them have meltdowns over the end of half shenanigans last week it was its just a smart play it happens all the time to this week when it happened to them fuck washington they shouldnt have 3 points theyre cheap
i liked the knuckle dragger that was crying about how they only have half of their offensive line when theyre really only missing a mediocre pouncey

imagine having to play a game when

your starting guard foster not hofer yanda retired last year

a starting banner career backup getting first shot not even in the same league as all pro stanley tackle is on ir

a starting center one not 2 is on the covid list

i cant think of any not even a single team that could possibly be going thru a situation like that those poor pittsburgh victims
i heard they lost and watched the highlights when i saw them go on a 4th and goal i was just like oh no shit these guys are morons the washington offense isnt legendary it isnt threatening they did the same shit against the rg3 ravens and ben threw an int just kick a fucking field goal bad start to a game and wft got heated after that stop
they always fall apart down the stretch and ive been saying it all year

their team is always built to be gassed by week 16 i would be surprised to see them lose 2 more games over the next 4
saw some guy post on twitter yesterday we dont have a quarter of a starters its amazing it was that close the steelers are missing like 3 starters

i literally just subbed this morning great to see you on reddit too
subscribed

bad
is irsay coming cause fuck no

wed go from the penthouse to the outhouse as far as ownership is concerned or more appropriately the penthouse to the penitentiary

seriously that pill popper has ruined two generational qbs on his watch and has one less championship than we do with arguably the greatest qb of all time

ask bart scott about that

we literally just got a generational talent at qb and if we stopped calling the same plays and had a strength coach who wore a mask would probably be sitting at 83 right now

and this is a down year

meanwhile indy has no prospective qb past next week has a few solid players nelson leonard buckner and an ok coaching staff but wont be considered anything more than an 88 team at best

so if that were to happen id feel pretty terrible
im not from baltimore not even american so locationcity doesnt mean much of anything to be but stillno assuming this change also means a change of ownership coaching management uniforms and roster then this is a massive downgrade in literally every faucet id either follow wherever the ravens went because of everything listed above or id jump to one of my second teams full time seahawks or packers literally only because of rodgers
very odd question you dont rip the heart out of a fan base in the early 80s only to come back later doesnt work that way i dont expect most on reddit to understand what happened
i dont think any fan would really be happy with this either fans are old enough to remember the colts in which case they already hate the colts too much to ever root for them again or theyre too young to remember the colts in which case theyd be losing their lifelong team in the ravens for a team theyd have no reason to welcome back
as much as the nostalgia of the colts would be nice no the ravens are baltimores team now we have the memories of unitas donovan ameche moore etc older fans have never forgotten them we are making new memories with lewis ogden flacco jackson etc

embrace the past but the ravens are our future
id be fuckin pissed wym

the ravens just make sense due to edgar allan poe and the connection there

also i bleed purple and black baby purple is my favorite color i have purple bedsheets and black pillow cases aint no damn way id be as happy with another team as i am the ravens


are those snowboard goggles

you know they made this post because they wanted the steelers to win right

that said fts

well theyre about to fail in both these endeavors

we scratched your backs last night please scratch ours by whooping the cowboys tonight

fuck dallas get that dub boys
fuck the cowboys
fuck the steelers
fuck the penguins
dmv
thanks for beating the steelers they need to stfu
fuck the cowbitches
same here
i like this trade hopefully we get the win for our part
whos up for a quid pro quo ladies and gentlemen in the dmv area and beyond
i was watching the wftsteelers game last night with an eagles and giants fan and all 3 of us were rooting for the wft pretty funny to see that the steelers can make division rivals root for one another
fuck dan snyder but it was majestic to see alex smith take down the steelers
we got u neighbors
dmv unite
i have a good feeling about this one i think were about to witness a spanking
hell yea ive been wanting an all maryland super bowl since i was a kid way to beat the steelers
whereas i want to win either way the win for wft yesterday only helped kc and the wft at this point the steelers record means nothing to baltimore as we cant possible catch them but all that aside hopefully we can still help you because again i want to win
ive been looking for an nfc team in the hunt to root for leading up to the post season and how convenient that a local team happened to beat fuck the steelers last night also its easy to root for alex smith lets go football team
say less we got you neighbor
this is the law of equivalent exchange we shall beat the cowboys for what you did for us yesterday
wtf i love the wft now
we will pay you back with a win tonight
lets fucking go weve got your back wft
appreciate the post but after two nfc east teams pulled off huge upsets im a little worried about dallas now

every week this season i will be doing a crappy photoshop for our matchup here are the past weeks submissions

week 1 don lamar

week 2 the texans chainsaw massacre

week 3 over the top

week 4 he got game

week 5 gladiator

week 6 eagle eye

week 7 byecentennial man

week 8 no country for old ben

week 9 a rivers runs through it

week 10 patriot games

week 11 clash of the titans

week 12 the replacements
its time to get drunk oh shit its tuesday its time to get stuck in traffic but the traffic ride home will more chill lamar is back the stars are truly aligned im more confident in a win than i have been in a while also there is a disturbing lack of ravens related posts on the front page cant get to 11 and 5 without getting to 7 and 5
anybody know what uniforms were wearing
five more minutessike

the majority of teams play 3 games in 12 days every single year
this happens multiple times a year

anytime a team goes from 2 sundays to a thursday game its 12 days in between all of them

god what a bunch of babies
ebron is about as smart as he is good at catching the football

or blocking for that matter check out chase young abusing him like adrian peterson would to his kid on that fourth and goal

im sure if they had more rest then they wouldnt have thought a single block on young with a journeyman te would be a good idea

or passing to a rb who has caught five catches in his career on a gotta have it fourth down was the way to go

fuck this garbage ass team and their garbage excuses
this happens every time a team has a tnf game the steelers fans are just salty and stupid
our three game stretch other than nyj was quite tough they played the 1 win jags our reserves and the nfc leasts second place team
steelers are pure trash there team is an anomaly they will be one and done
theyre so mad they finally got exposed as an overrated team
lmao their original schedule had 3 games in 12 days nov 15 nov 22 and nov 26 then it was changed to 3 games in 12 days hahaha
right but they all wanna bitch and cry and make excuses the steelers fans some straight bitches
the sun rising in the east setting in the west and pittsburgh and their sycophants from rnfl whining about scheduling inconvenience a tradition as old as time
this has nothing to do with volume of games that team has been squeeking by all season they barely beat the broncos 48 they barely beat the texans 48 they barely beat the cowboys 38 they have played a very easy schedule for the most part giants 57 eagles 381 bengals 291 jags 111 they played the browns before they got their shit together and started winning some games the titans was probably the first above average team they played all year and it was a very close game hell even moving forward they get another free win from the bengals in a couple weeks and really only have 2 or 3 above average teams left to play are they a good team this year i mean sure you have to at least be decent to win that many games but they had a lot of help with a very very very soft schedule
i feel like there was a weird situation where we ended up with 3 games in 11 days at one point as well

i would say the more accurate comparison would be when we practised all week then lost our bye in week 3 or 3 of 2008 due to ike because we had to play houston on our bye week so we has like 14 or 15 games straight and made to the afc championship with a rookie hc and qb
its also ridiculous because they had 9 days to prepare for the game on the 2nd against the ravens so over that same stretch of 3 games in 12 days they also only played those 3 games in 21 days quit whining
steelers also played 3 in 12 last year it happens all the time to everyone
the steelers have played 3 games in 12 days in 4 of the last five years theyre the most whiny fans on all of reddit i swear
i forget where i saw it but someone tweeted out last week steelers have to play three games in twelve days last time the steelers had to play three games in twelve days 2019 before that 2018
the bills and 49ers were also playing their third game in 12 days and they werent complaining
you shouldnt need three days to plan for the football team
i think steelers fans are less upset about being 111 its the fact that they lost to fucking washington

goddamn last night was a fun watch
as a steeler fan i dont think that i think the amount of fans stating this is very small i think there are more nonsteeler fans saying that they are saying it than actual steeler fans that are actually saying it my wife us grumbling about it i just tell her to chill

the steelers lost because their run game was crap wrs could not catch and they refused to kick field goals and went for first downs when it made absolutely no sense dumb
every team that plays sunday sunday thursday plays 3 games in 12 days dont most teams do that every year did the steelers do that twice or something what am i missing
fuck the steelers
we lost because we dropped passes again
happy gilmore accomplished that feat no more then an hour ago

its not the amount of time thats the problem they played like crap against the ravens and kept that up against wft they apparently cant run without connor so that kills their short passing game if they arent worried about the run

people always like to point out how team x or y figured out the ravens its nice that the ravens practice squad essentially exposed the steelers
im pretty sure the ravens have gone monday sunday thursday in the past as well
poor steelers man they lost after playing their 3rd game in 17 days they even had to play our practice squad last week they really have it rough
whats worse is the random fans from other teams that have been rimjobbing the steelers since thanksgiving
that december 12 game was the shit i was working out of town corpus christi tx so i wore my black lamar jersey to my favorite restaurant after work chuys and went all out with my meal while i wished i was with my family at least if i was working out of town by myself i had a good game to watch with some good food and drink
they are such crybabies jfc

i love this but in all fairness every fan base has em have you seen the game thread when were losing we dont get a first down and people clamor for us to fire someone
youre from ohio stop acting like youre cold damn thats hilarious
and another thing bring back terry bradshaw
for a fanbase that likes to gloat about the number of rings they have they sure think their organization is the worst
imagine feeling that the biggest problem with the human being named ben roethlisberger is that he wears gloves when he plays football
tomlin is the most overrated game day coach in the history of the league he may be good the rest of the week but he makes head scratching calls every single game its bizarre
i drink the tears of shittsburg fans

this is absolute gold
jesus christ that was funny the extended vid makes it all lmao
this is hilarious


that poor kid tho

not gonna lie first read that as lose and was triggered
hope you guys kick butt tonight
how about we give the bulk of the carries to dobbins with gus backing up
lamar needs to let himself go i know he wants to prove the critics and haters wrong by hanging in the pocket and looking to pass but were out here to win football games if you can pick up a first down with your feet just do it you shouldnt bank on boykin or brown getting open and catching a pass if you can just get a first down yourself not saying to be a runfirst qb but if the defense is giving you the opportunity to get a decent gain just take it everyone knows our receiving corps sucks and our passing plays are horribly designed anyway

baldy pointed this out on one of his breakdowns a few weeks ago patriots
just imagine if we win out

then our redemption tour begins
at titans
at kc
at pittsburgh

win sb over tampa bay
as a giants fan and the ravens being my favourite team in the afc i hope he absolutely roasts the cowboys tonight

stunt on these hoes
this man does not cook he flambayes
even the best chef cant do much without ingredients ravens gotta restock this offseason
if he cant get something going in the air tonight against a historically bad defense were in trouble for a long time

you know what i dont wanna jinx it so imma just say big truzzzzzzzz
i hope you guys do run the table love you

personally would love to see color rush tonight since i got my color rush lamar jersey and hes gone off when wearing it but black on black is so good too
color rush will be next week against the browns this week we are wearing black jerseys and i think purple pants
zeke has fumbled the most out of any rb and is going against the team with the most forced fumbles marlon 9 peters 3 ginkel 3 yannick some on vikinngs 3 and deshon elliott 2 also the two best oline are out dak is out ranked 32 run defense
who is ginkel lol
lets hope zeke only gets garbage junk yards due to us having a huge lead the entire game
you know this means he has no fumbles right this is baltimore thats how these stats work most fumbles vs most forced no fumbles 1 run defense vs worst run offense field day in the ground

its like these stats exist just to jinx the team

a lot of you need to get some fresh air
if theres only 25 mods then there isnt a mod for every team
browns have the softest fanbase any kind of slight and they get triggered
this isnt it
why are you like this
who cares lol
does it really bother people that there some in the rnfl who hate the ravens
whenever someone brings up the disrespect theme i always think of old man potters quote from its a wonderful life george i am an old man and most people hate me but i dont like them either so that makes it all even
32x264

there have to be at least 9 teams with only one mod if thats the case this argument you are making is not very strong

would be better if it was real
washington now my second team lets gooooo hahaha
the washington savages wait shit nvm
i just checked the wft twitter page i dont see this post i cant believe this was a real post by the team fyi while i live in bmore im from dc and lifelong wft fan ravens kick dallas butt tonight
this is something their twitter would post too
we should win tonight dobbins should get at least 20 carries for now on
tell me this is fucking real please
hooray
our maryland brethren is impressing me more and more with the blatant trolling of the steelers

fuck them and fuck stephen truitt
doittuittwhat an ass
shittsburgh steelers

you know 10 years ago i hated hines ward james harrison troy polamalu and all their crew but the steelers over the last few years have some players who are for want of a better term whiny bitches that make me hate them in a completely different way
howd his stats do last night he was supposed to come back and catch up
ever since their older vets have retired their locker room has descended into hell tomlin has no control over the team you saw it with bens radio shows abs antics bells holdout juju twerking on tiktok and now their defensive players comments on ig this fluke of a season for them will end in a crash and burn and no one will be shocked except yinzers
haha i never realized that their abbreviation is wtf and yes this is completely true
jdrf donation page

their offense is gimmicky stop the run tackle their receivers after the catch and force them to go down the field 15 plays of short passes they are bound to drop some balls and have incompletions due to bad timing good defenses will continue to expose them for the frauds they are the ravens held them to 13 offensive points and the wft held them to 17 the steelers are in trouble when it comes to the playoffs they will get smoked by the upper tier teams in the afc

if we got a good oc we would be undefeated with the talent on both sides of the ball

where did you hear he isnt playing do you have an official link

edit according to it has been reported that lamar will play
this sub kills me with all the fucking reposts and posts that take 2 seconds to google our mods suck tbh
hes playing
yes


whoever runs that account deserves a raise
wish it was us instead of washington but ill take it
nice
brings us all joy my friend
well done wft
i love it but i dont want to give anyone the impression any steelers fans have a desk job
the name plate on the desk is a nice touch
isnt this from wfts sub

i dont think i could ever bet an under on receptions to a rb seems like it could hit on a single drive because dump offs are so weird
highs and lows on and off the field a global pandemic a wednesday 340pm game with our practice squad

just wanna say im glad we get to turn off the outside world once a week and all come together to root for our guys and coming here with excitement of despair

now starts a sort of new season with a must win game now lets fuxking go out there and hope they turn it up a gear

as always big truzzzz and fuck the steelers
truzz l freaky gon be in his bag tonight
im expecting fireworks tonight most of the league giving the squad shit for the schedule shake up and i really hope they take it out on the cowboys

ask him what is what like playing with ed reed and ray lewis how did playing with them influence or effect his game
whats it like to have an elite dragon as the quarterback
heading into the match did you expect to win easily
the fact that his only good year came in a contract year is pretty scaryrisky but the fact remains that he has really balled out this year and would still be in his prime entering free agency assuming the titans dont retain him since declining his 5th year option

do people think he can be the franchise big bodied wr that we need here assuming hell demand a bit less than allen robinson in fa
ill take almost any receiver in fa at this point lol
titans fans were ready to call him a bust until late last year when he realized he was about to be in a contract year and remembered how to catch the ball for me hes low on the list of receivers i want us to go after hes definitely behind robinson and dj chark

our best wr is willy sneed id davis any day
i think one thing people are leaving out and underrating

dude is a monstrous blocker in the run game
arob is way better
i wanted him bad in the 2017 draft i wouldnt be mad if we got him
hes a cheaper option and i would not be mad at all if we went after him however if oc arthur smith gets a hc position for some team ie texans lions i fully expect corey to follow him to whatever team he takes over
hed be a good addition though our front office might us us picking up a wr in free agency as an excuse to not draft another wr

we need to add at least 2 more dudes
id welcome it
injured all the time

yes
nope hes out


jk hes gonna roll over the cowboys tonight
none of yall know how to use google huh
yes but if harbaugh gets his way ingram will get the bulk of the snaps

bus on a bus interesting
okay those are solid pez on dez likely my fave but love the mr bean
i love the crown on a clown one is that lee evans

lol why shrek though
i love it

he looks like he could be gros more belligerent brother the rob ryan of brothers if you will
fitchner is basically bens sock puppet
actually we hate randy fichtner probably more than we hated todd haley









buck allen being resigned to the ravens confirmed
id say you opened it a couple years late
uh oh
100 for a meme jersey

we need to make the subs search functionality 5x larger

edit i read back jerseys purple pants cant confirm this just what ive read from others
normally they will only announce the uppers on twitter and such but tbh i havent seen anything about it this week

they dont announce the bottoms though

i hope its black on black and color rush on monday though
imma take a guess and say black jerseys purple pants the same we wore in week 17 of 2018 against the browns
im pretty confident i heard back on black was what they were wearing but that was a few weeks ago so could be incorrect

i think my favorite part of that tweet is the fact that the saying should go

loser never heard of her


like bruh you even lost at writing a tweet


view poll
were gonna destroy
win but andy raven killer dalton will make it a sweat
i say it depends on how our offense plays without snead and andrews
6 of you are crazy
this is the game the game we need to set the tone for the rest of the season buckle up boys and girls lets eat
will all 21 ppl who said lose please come forward
if the ravens dont run the ball 40 times at least please greg let us win


and what does that make us
i think that given lamar hasnt had a lot of practice and two of our safe receivers ones with good hands are out we should run read options a lot i know lamar said he doesnt want to run as much this season but i think its a good idea
not to mention they have the worst rush defense in the league
maybe this game unleashes what we saw a lot of last year and we kinda roll from there

knowing roman he will think thats what the cowboys think we will do and come out passing on the first play

was close contact and can still play monday if he continues to test negative
that sucks
rather beat them at their best so their fans wont have excuses
browns placed g wyatt teller on reservecovid19

im ootl please help
its warsh
yes but alsohave you been to dundalk
can we please use this fucking guy more
gr no
roman sucks but we cant act like harbaugh isnt allowing this
tell greg roman that
after the 1st drive against the chiefs 1 carry 6 yards

at the end of the game 1 carry 6 yards
removed
yup you lost to a team thats worse
wrong sub man
rent freee hahahahahaha

op is a bagger at dairy queen and a trumpee that should tell you everything about him lmfao

all the simping in that thread jfc
fair waring her actual page is nsfw
titties
why are we posting shit from the steelers sub here
anyone else really hoping they target dez a lot today to stick it to the cowboys organization you know he wants to go off i hope they let him show them what he still has
you know we have shit receivers when were waiting for old man dez bryant to break out
i really want to see dez do to the cowboys what steve smith did to the panthers especially the postgame shittalking
i completely forgot this is going to be dez first game vs the cowboys god i hope he goes off more importantly i hope roman calls plays to give it to him effectively
i definitely am how many times over the years have we seen a player go off on their former team if its ever going to happen for dez tonight would be the time
little did you know it was a breakout game for dez
it would make great headlines but unlikely to happen just because its roman calling the shots

be good to rest dez early on and see

ive been down on this team throughout the season but goddamn this sub is depressing today

our guys were fired up last week and this could be a statement game tonight

save the disappoint for after the game if its necessary
its insane how many elite runners we have our rb4 is really justice hill lmao that man could start on quite a few nfl teams
guaranteed he will
god damn how tall is justice hill his torso is so long
penalties and turnovers incoming
the easy answer we are a running team lets run the ball but truth is our oline took a step back

we have hollywood proche and duvarney we are a play action team who wins with the deep ball this sounds good but there is no time in the pocket to make a deep pass

we have mandrews dez and willie we are a short middle of the field passing team who can make contested catches i havent seen this come to fruition

we are a gadget team as lamar goes we go fake reverses misdirection and lamar does the rest worked last year isnt working this year

so what do you think our identity isshould be
our identity right now is greg roman regardless of who where and what we do on the field its his identity and everyone has figured it out
i dont think we have one anymore lol
should be run heavy with nicely timed play action and every now and then to prevent the defense from subbing we should go hurry upno huddle like the colts game lets see if gro figures it out
to physically be there but mentally not
running the exact same plays every game like this is madden
its a little bit late in the season for us to try to be finding an identity as a team this is one of the main reasons we are at risk of missing the playoffs this year
i remain in the minority thinking that this team should become a spread majority passing team however i do recognize the current wr talentgro arent conducive to this i want to see the bills cardinals or cowboys w dak offense just copy pasted with lamar let lamars high iq dissect the defense then use the insane running game to close it out
you are proving his point nicely not sure what youre arguing about
boredom



cant believe this game is for our season hope the team plays with heart and stomps the fuck outta the cowboys absolutely no reason we should lose this game this game shouldnt even be close but as all games have gone this season this game will be close
truzz it up and simply belee
nice

holy shit is your microphone inside you
love that hes back right after jimmy tweaks his groin i know he was below average last year and average this year but i am really hoping he steps up and can take over for jimmy when he calls it quits

source
he actually was starting to play really well right before he got injured happy to have him back we getting healthy at the right time
average is damn good for a backup corner ill gladly take it
i agree hes been much better this year and hope he continues to develop a big splash play wouldnt hurt either
hes cocap right who am i thinking of

edit im a dumbass anthony levine is co cap
he is still a far cry from jimmy smith
since then we are 02 when wearing black jerseyswhite pants im praying we arent wearing them tonight
i said in another thread but i want all purple to channel rams game last year
i fucking love the black pants we dont see them enough
black on purple is my call
black on black confirmed

i hope dez goes off
yay good luck my eagles need the win too
lol i remember this feeling the year flacco went down it does suck
welp dez wont get that chance
dez went off all right
dez went offthe field


truzz
in truss we trust

x200b












i think this only works on pc

if they had him covering on islands like they did with lamar jackson and henry ruggs last week i think hell do way better with us
lets fuckin go asquared as he is known around my apartment was looking pretty promising earlier this year
players only please we all know greg roman would be the answer otherwise
tbh mark and rg3 have done there jobs to mentor gus and jk and lamar and trace
unless he comes at or near the minimum contract skura hes just not the same player after his injury and this is a strong draft for interior linemen
maybe judon if we can get someone better he has his moments and hes honestly not terrible the issue is really whether hes worth as much as were paying him my frustration with him is that hes inconsistent hell have streaks where he constantly gets flags and does dumb shit but then will make a good play so you like him again hes done better in the later half of the season but the first 5ish weeks seemed kinda rough for him glad hes worked on not getting so many flags tho
for me its rg3 great guy buy i dont think he should be in the league anymore with his injuries the role for lamars backup is more important than it would normally be given the offenses propensity for running the qb position

rg3 was great as a mentor and as an team leader but as a player he might be done i wont be mad if they keep him but if they keep him they should also be keeping mcsorley or the guy on the practice squad i think hundley
dammit op i was gonna say greg roman
judon he is not worth what we are paying him beyond that skura rg3 and mark all seem to be in their last year as ravens i will miss all 3 but cap is gonna be tight
luke wilson
no one i really want to see gone but im pretty sure guys like ingram rg3 levine and mcphee are all going to be replaced to save money next year

id be surprised if jimmy smith wants another one year cheap contract too
judon is an easy answer but really its not fair hes a decent player but overpaid and likely to be overpaid the penalties are killer but i cant help but feel might be less of an issue if he didnt have to try to superman everything to get pressure because the rest of the front 7 cant win an one on one hes played better in games with better performances around him as all players do

ingram hes too expensive and unfortunately has hit the over 30 wall for rbs hes just not the same and dobbins is looking like the real deal plus he saves 5m on the cap

boyle not because hes bad at all but because for a 55m cap space cut i think you can either restructureextend or get a cheaper replacement 8020 rule


i think it has to be judon but im 99 sure that rg3 will be gone
judon unless he lowers his asking price by a lot
chris fucking moore
ingram

gus and jk are significantly better
tavon ir hero young
miles boykin
judon and only because hes going to be expensive
after the first 10m of the game marquise brown hes soft he cant catch and hes already developing an attitude

get rid of him while hes worth something
roman


yea i know u said dont say him but honestly im so done with roman he needs to go
hollywood judon ingram young averett in that order
john harbaugh
will the ravens lose again this season nevermore nevermore
beautiful

funeral game the perfect uniform to turn the season around
finally
fuck yeah
time to put the cowboys season to rest
we got big baby and campbell back tonight too oooohhhh weeeeee
goravens
this is the 3rd time weve worn black this season have they lifted the restriction on twice a year for the alternate jersey
lfg

the best unis in the league

murdered out less goooooo
also wearing black tees underneath theyve been white in the past and looked a bit janky this uni combo is so fucking cool just need black socks and towels all round
our record with all black jerseys hasnt been the best

i love how they look tho im probably being superstitious


forgot to mention dez gets his first td back against his former team
my guy it isnt gonna be a crucial recovery because itll be a blowout

yes if you notice almost all of the other players rotate in and out except marlon peters and elliott
i think so
yes they gave queen some reps with it during training camp but clark will have it when hes on the field

hope he balls the fuck out tonight
just another game water over the bridge my ass give him red zone jump balls
he tested positive not playing tonight
so did they do the covid testing right before the game when exactly did we find out dez has covid
removed

dont they always

hoping they have a huge 5 games to finish the season
im like 90 sure that they walk in together for every game
hollywood drives lamar around its on snapchat all the time lol
dang those shoes are
aged like milk


thats dope
fuck thats fire i want it
this is amazing is this a hobby of yours
i actually really like the noncustom side of the helmet as a fulltime thing id be really excited with that helmetuni update even though our current setup is pretty lit too obviously the custom part wouldnt be there if that was fulltime

i wonder if any team has ever experimented with having two different logos on a helmet starting to wonder what it would look like if we replaced backwards bird with the shield but left forwards bird alone i know pitt only puts their logo on one side
damn that looks nice af
thats clean
beautiful
the shield fogged up on him during the game and he went back to the other helmet

i remember those days
please i just need a flash of the 2019 offense
ive been going to bed at like 845 the past few nights because my toddlers 430am wake up calls are rough id really like to not have to stay up until 11pm tonight
jackson 5 yes sir
youre 25 as it stands
ah yes rg3mcsorly time

i fuckin love it
p365


no
thats a tall order maybe if lamar throws 3 td passes all to dobbins and runs for 2 more himself lol
nah youre probably boned unless lamar chucks a shitload of tds to dobbins

im probably screwed this week as well if it helps im relying on lamar and the ravens defense to carry me to the promised land and into the playoffs
no
nope even if they both ball out they probably get benched for backups before they got that many points
im in same boat as you but i also have tucker
youre mixing streams dude aint kosher


just read the rules then
we dont know if athletes are exactly the same when coming back from covid remember cam newton what if lamar dobbins and cambell arent 100 im nervous af after what happened to the steelers hawks and green bay
remember cam newton

no whos that
ive thought of this some come back fine some like ryquell armstead dont come back at all if lamar tested negative and was asymptomatic he should be fine but some of these players will be more tired than usual
well we will see in a hour wont we
i think we kinda know the short term effects of it but long term is the unknown so he should be fine if he went through proper screening
for what its worth from what ive heard lamar reported having no symptoms which means nothing in terms of possible long term effects i know and thus was working out on his own the whole time he was on the list so he should at least still be in good shape
i thought i was on rnfl and this was going to be a kelvin benjamin setup
no one is overlooking this uncertainty fox led its coverage with it and jay glazer talked about campbell specifically
i am always nervous af
i think this rule of thinking can be taken to anyone in general but athletes are asked to do a hell of a lot more than the average person
good thing were playing the cowboys
the big guys worry me lamar i feel wouldnt be as big a worry as a 300 lbs dude
lamar wasnt great pre covid this year it can only go up

firegregroman
hopefully they ice up tonight

tells punt team to stay on the sideline

scores td on 4th down

thats my quarterback
ah man a healthy ravens team would have 100 beat the steelers last week
lj fort is so solid cant believe he was just on his couch
lamar said no

lamar calls his own number

lamar scores

absolute legend
jump for it you fucking lawn gnome

brown has no catch radius thats a ball any other receiver catches its not even like it was particularly high or out front
aikmen shut ur bitch mouth
lamar just carried the team down the field and all you all will remember is that throw on third down
lamar waving off the punt team and scoring a td is
how can you have an illegal formation penalty on offense week after week for the past 5 weeks

how

someone please im losing my mind how can you still not fix this error
props to dalton that ball was fucking chucked
its so nice and refreshing to see lamar taking lanes and running when the defense has given it to him tonight felt like hes been a bit hesitant to do so earlier in the year
lmao seeing queen actually try to get to dalton through 6 blockers all by himself was hilarious
lamar should attend the peyton manning passing academy over the offseason
we are so lucky we are playing an awful team tonight
rolling out right on a short field to a side with 1 receiver makes absolutely no sense
troy aikman sounds depressed talking about the cowboys defense
jk easy money dobbins
listen im still not sold on greg roman but tonight he ran the football and for that im thankful
games that have felt like 2019

the ravens nearly put up 300 rushing with a chunk of the oline injured id say dallas is pretty damn bad defensively lmao
harbs we probably shouldnt handshake on national tv

omg im ded
i feel like pulling dez bryant was a conspiracy
so weve got snead dez and mandrews out marquise is shit and duvernay gets one pass per game ingram averages 17 ypc and he starts what the fuck are we doing
this game is drunk
for real lamars mechanics have dropped he fixed last year
tucker boots past the endzone

fuck if im doing any more tackling tonight
next monday is the season pretty much dont see 106 being good enough this year
i get that we live and die by the turnover but sometimes we should focus on tackling first
really sucks that even with a spotty lamar we woulda beat the steelers last week
dobbins sent me to the playoffs i love you
i swear this sub breaks down any time the opposing offense gets a first down lmaooo yall some goons
is there any player in recent memory who exemplifies play like a raven less than hollywood brown soft selfish stupid
queen held that with his middle fingers that man is greatness in the making
whats with the illegal formation penalties every fucking game
okay 4 sad cowboys with tuesdays gone playing in the background was my favorite shot of this game lol
gus is hands down the most underrated rb in the league shit aint even close
dalton and 4th long is somehow automatic vs the ravens
inject lamar into my veins
tucker misses boykin scores and dez quits football all in 1 night what a weird time
we got robbed of an int
lets start this next drive with dobbinshow about that
tucker missing was just his 500 iq knowing that it would put us in better position to score a td absolute goat
yall can shit on campbell all you want ill praise him for being the only one to actually get through dline is pathetic right now
dallas has one of the worst lines in the nfl and dalton has 7 seconds to throw a pass
ingram up the middle for 2 and other phrases heard several times a week
if we can get a true 1 receiver then i believe hollywood can be a dangerous 2
the cycle repeats zuerline miss
two former osu running backs though the first half of ravenscowboys sgellison


jk dobbins

5 rushes
51 yards
102 average

ezekiel elliott

10 rushes
53 yards
53 average
1 catch 4 yards
get ingram the fuck out hfc
with how dominate wolfe has been keep calais off the field until hes more healthy
omg peters
i will never not be annoyed by buckaikman calling a game like theyre on dallas radio
dalton and long ptsd
ive said it since lamar took over

we need big wrs with large a catch radius lamar has always been inconsistent with his accuracy and we will continue to live with it

so ill never understand why we went with the smallest of the speedsters in the 2019 draft
joe buck is apparently the antichrist
we have been called for illegal formation more times than greg roman has called a screen pass
anyone else notice how well bowser was timing the snap count on that last drive
i love wink but it feels like the defense has been struggling with wide open receivers quite a bit
this man is still crying about that missed call
that wasnt a good team drive but it was a very good lamar jackson drive
i think that lamar will be able to turn the passing around he just is not comfortable with no offseason
marcus peters got cleared out on that play
marcus peters been bbq chicken the last couple of months
hensley baltimore cracks 30 points for first time since oct 18
that was definitely not opi guys lol marlon just got beat
no more ingram snaps please
not the worst half of football weve played
for a team who blitzs so fucking much you would think we would get some sacks out of it
we need ricard im not even joking
hollywood slowing down realizing the situation to turn up field track the ball and make the catch


the announcers are so far up the cowboys asses
secondary so soft wth
the defense has three total sacks since week 9
honestly did anyone really expect lamar to look sharp coming off of covid and not playing in over two weeks i think hes played great considering the circumstances
this is the lamar paradox

boykin was wide open and he missed what turned out to be an easy throw after he did really well to buy time

yet hell do stuff like that hollywood td throw where he was throwing into a tight window while running left

hes our qb and our mvp but im dying for some passing consistency from him
game hasnt even started and its going bad shouldnt be played if covid is back

i cant even drink because i work in the morning but fuck it i might
yea im going to go ahead and call it a quit for the rest of the season i cant deal with this dezbryant
marquise brown is now back to being known as wr 15
smh 9 missing the tackle that bum
if this was 2019 we score that touchdown special teams pins them inside the 15 defense forces a punt and offense drives down the field again for another touchdown rinse and repeat
illegal formation
how in the fuck do we have illegal formations every fucking game
its very concerning we dont have a sack against the cowboys oline
yall are horny as hell
calais needs to stay out get healthy
can we please use dobbins please
andy dalton continuing to chuck to wide open wideouts standing still without a ravens anywhere close to them its a joke
patrick ricard is a fucking concrete wall
yall realize lamar practiced 1 time in 2 weeks right
that is a ridiculously bad spot are you fucking kidding me
of fucking course a no call and then they get the td on 4th down fuck off
dobbins is in for a 5yard td to put this game away ravens 294 yards rushing is a season high jeffzrebiec
32nd ranked rushing defense is right

ez money
this is where i would super sim to avoid injuries
4th and 19 most teams stops them

ravens lol nah
harbs
we cant shake hands on national tv
i love how the first thing i see in this game thread is someone commenting how our defense sucks because we gave up one first down sums up these threads
love that lamar was like keep the fucking kicking squad off the field then scores a td lol
its becoming really obvious that the ravens are winning in spite of greg roman rather than because of him
fuck these commentators
joe buck u cocksucker
that has to be in the running for the worst announcer jinx of all time
justin tucker intentional miss very cool
holy shit did we just scheme a receiver open
everyone talking about the illegal formation but no ones mentioning how brown couldnt catch that inbounds 0 field awareness
difference between the obviously noticeable burst on dobbins vs ingram is the difference between the burst of dobbins vs me

i dont have much burst fellas
just dont tip it to aj green ihedigbo
the whole fucking defense really didnt even jump to contest are you srs
not one raven jumped lmao
we may as well approach this game as if the cowboys were the old bengals
i sure hope we win this game by more than 3 points that was a horrible nocall
come on lamar that was an awful throw why are you dropping your elbow there
160 yards rushing in the first half run it once and then pass twice on your opening possession to start the half causing a three and out
ew that release was ew
calais walking menacingly towards dalton
this reffing is ass missing calls on both us and dallas
why are we not running dobbins i specifically requested it
why is ingram still playing roman why
greg must be allergic to dobbins i fucking swear
im going to say it i think dobbins will be better than rice
what a fucking throw and what a catch thats what souljas do more of that please
where is the pass rush can we get a sack please
dez just retweeting people with their glasses of wine lol
can we make the bus a raven lifer hes so consistent in playing hard
wide open boykin and he bounces it in front of him goddammit doesnt matter in this game but that will lose games against real teams
that is a generous first down
aikman sounds so sad
the secondary is sleeping on 3rd4th down alot this year
team looks like half the players had a respiratory virus recently
im so pissed off its just unfortunate he warmed up he was around everyone dez heal up you seem like a smart man soni imagine you wore your mask and it didnt spread but football gods give us a fucking break
steelers blown 10 point lead

patriots monsoon when we get the ball in the 4th quarter

top run defenders getting injured before facing derick henry

titans blown lead

entire team getting covid

luke wilson dropped go ahead td against the 110 steelers

every wild card potential team winning two at the last second on lucky plays

you are here

dez bryant gets covid triggering a second team outbreak

ravens miss the playoffs
i guess were going for herd immunity at this point
why are they using a test notorious for false positives 30 minutes before a game fuck this i wanted dez tonight
why cant we fucking enjoy one game dammit

were fucking cursed
oh my god i forgot holding could be called on the team playing us
fuck me dez out with covid i hope its a false positive so he doesnt have it if it is im gonna be choked he isnt in the game
im a straight dude and i never missed a man in my life the way i missed lamar demeatrice jackson
bad throw but also bad effort there by brown
can we remember that dobbins exists now
this season has been wasted by greg roman enjoy
look at that hold on chris board clear as day
no offense to my short kings out there but i sincerely hope we draft a wr next year thats the size of an adult human
good thing they have dalton who literally only plays well against the ravens
the architect dude couldnt design a shed
fuck you joe buck
madden cursed our whole damn season
was all part of tuckers huge brain play

truly playing chess while other kickers playing checkers
boykinduvernaysneadhollywood
just realised if saunders wasnt a fucking idiot dez wouldve played tonight fuck saunders
boykin looked like he was actually attacking the defense there for once
not so funny when it happens to the cowboys is it troy
jesus christ roman that play hasnt gotten positive yards all year stop calling it
we do run the same plays too much
how many goddamn illegal formation penalties have we had this year fuck
im so sick of illegal formation penalties
no raven jumped for it
lmao that hail mary defense was shit

jk dobbins and gus edwards are both averaging over ten yards a carry not sure how dallas has a chance if that stays the case in the 2nd half
lmao look at this tweet that ryan mink 
ugh knock it off with that sidearmed bullshit
lamars gotta make that throw
man our pass rush blows
why is ingram getting carries legitimately do not get it
lamar my man you are a bi polar passer
that is a fucking sight for sore eyes mvp shit those past 2 plays
one of the main problems i have had with our wr core is that they really struggle on the scramble drill lamar has trouble finding them after the play breaks down but that td to hollywood was exactly what we need
throws like that make it obvious that lamar can make great throws and anyone who actually watches him knows that he just needs to keep working on the mechanics to make the easier throws more consistently
im so glad he caught that yall been trashing him cause hes our wr1 but isnt a wr1 isnt that more on gm coaching and management he can still be a stud while not being wr1 talent
the talent is there just needs more time to develop a conventional offseason would definitely helpfucking covid
man ive missed this energy from lamar all year it feels like hes at his best when hes having fun out there
why the fuck you gonna call a rollout to the right with only one receiver going to the right
theyre hot i like em
joe buck confirmed for foot guy
absolutely no chance he had that first down what
this teams not doing shit against a playoff team with this pass rush
fort caught it
this sub has the memory of a goldfish peters had a great game last game he was the best player in one of our games earlier this season i would like to know who we could replace him with
he was down for like 5 seconds wtf are they smoking lmao
im greedy and want another touchdown

fuck the refs and fuck the cowboys
mark ingram seems like the perfect mentor for dobbins
so nice finally seeing lamar and the offence having fun on the sidelines for once this season
wolfe is our unsung hero
the ravens 294 rushing yards are more than they had in any game last season they ran for 285 when they blew out the rams jonasshaffer
lol andy dalton on fourth down
fort holding down thefort
i thought we learned jk was out best rb already
can we please just fucking use dobbins
why have souljas when they cant even run forward
what the point of having souljas if they cant catch
well we are who we thought we were
at leat held em to a fg
fans use jk dobbins hes a 100 yrd per game back
roman no i dont think i will
did yall see bozeman just kneeling with the td signal up


he already knew once lamar was gone
tucker literally saved a td man
why does this always happen to us lmao


defence makes a clutch stop and the offence chokes


offence starts cooking and defence chokes
how was there no holding there
why is brown our wr1
troy is trying to jinx tucker so bad
fuck joe buck
lol im out like dez
we really fucking iced ourselves
tipped interception

big kick return

rare tucker miss

all the bs coming against us
this is kind of a shit show
dude how does brown not get his feet in bounds is this a joke
dead honest whats the fucking record for illegal formations in a single season
can someone send roman a chart of legal formations
whats the point of trading for yannick if hes going to be this quiet
cowboys fans have the right to be pissed on that one
troy so quick to start whining when the cowboys dont get a call
anyone else just get fucking dalton 4th down hail mary flashbacks or was or just me
i feel like we shouldve rushed some more there like only rushing one is kinda useless
dalton on 4th down to a big wr with everyone in coverage is what ravens nightmares are made of
pretty weird half all around tbh
pass rush has to start gettin home he has all the time in the world
were playing with less heart than when 60 of our team was out
thoughts

1 omg how is it not even 6m into the 3rd quarter

2 lamar has got to get his mechanics back on point his side arm all the time shit is hurting the team

3 the lack of pass rush is really something even with calais still clearly not 100 this is awful how is no one able to get pressure even on a blitz
holy fuck lamar learn to throw
m v fucking p suck my fucking dick
thats all on hollywood great play by him credit where credit is due
that was beautiful great throw great catch everything perfect
its crazy how lj can misthrow the the easy passes but drops a dime like that
so he sometimes struggles with pocket throwing but running to the left and throwing on the run to a tight corner is perfect got it
can we get the practice squad defense back from last week
lamar had that 1st poor spot
dobbins and gus need to be here for a while lol
lamar is having fun and smiling this is a good sign people
petition to change jk dobbins nickname to easy money
101 yds for the bus 144 ypc
aikman is about to cry lol
keep in mind lamar hasnt played in two weeks and is without mandrews and snead rust was expected in the passing game and we still up 17
ptsd
this league is a shambles how do they randomly identify dez for testing 30mins prior to kickoff hes been around the team who else may have it and now theyre still gonna play the game could it be a falsepositive just baffling
this is so fucking stupid the nfl is so fucking delusional i cant believe they are going to play this game after pulling a positive player off the field during warmups
i already know how this is gonna go the offense is gonna be flat give the ball up constantly and in bad positions the defense is still gonna play well tho and keep us in it then the offense will wake up and well make a comeback but once we need a stop from the d theyll break bc theyve been out there all night
the only time he ever misses is when announcers have to run their mouths

shut the fuck up
im glad that fox does the little 6 graphic i always forget how much touchdowns are worth
we should trade for yannick so we can get some pass rush
hey steelers this is how you beat a shitty nfce team
i would thanossnap half this sub just to get erin andrews to kiss me on the cheek
literally just saw a tweet about dez hugging all the cowboys coaches
not to sounds so negative but if our team catches another case of covid we may lose a game down the stretch and things may be over for us this is fucked on all types of levels
fort dawged him bruh
the way fort just tossed zeke and walked away was so badass
fort might be the most underrated pickup weve had in years
lets hope this is the turning point where lamar goes from decent back to legend for 2020
i love ingram but i dont want him taking any snaps really
god damn so sick of these inside draws with ingram for 1 yard waste of a down

roman needs to go right now he has coached the skill out of the offense i literally cant believe the shit im seeing week after week
i hate greg roman
holding on yannick
no longer the madden curse its the roman curse
can we just have lamar call the offense
how tf was that not holding
tucker with some tackling highlight reel material
i feel bad for wink the other parts of the team constantly putting him in bad situations
so lamar gets on the board and st shit the bed fuck cmon man
okay tucker no more freebees put the next on in the end zone
marlon is guarding for 4 seconds with no pressure with no safety help with gallup having half a field to work with that rarely goes well for the db
this is the vaunted ravens defense cries
a smart oc would mix play action in there but what do i know
im not a superstitious person but that wasnt tuckers fault it was joe buck
relationship ended with soulja boykin is my new king
big boykin no lil boykin
tucker with the big brain play missing a fg for the sake he knew wed get a to resulting in a td
the announcers sound so unimpressed and bored when the cowboys arent scoring
we need a team of all 70 receivers
when dalton throws deep against us thats some ptsd type shit
bro both teams icing their own kickers lol
joe buck is a field goal killer
yeah dallas fans we know how that feels
holy shit hahah both qbs throw a pick both kickers miss a fg does that mean were due for a big kickoff return
deion sanders the legendary baltimore raven
tbh i think roman is gone after this season
yall notice yannick has done nothing like at all
andy is not a crybaby he got right back up repstec
and that is why gregg williams sends pressure
andy throwing a hail mary against us im getting ptsd
we know daltons superpower is throwing hail marys against the ravens he almost did it again
dezs twitter right now shits wild
dez confirmed hes coming back
go ravens

giants fan
i wish some of our missed calls were focused on as much as theyre hanging on to that miscall
i keep making excuses for why the team is doing bad like the poor o line play or our weapons being bottom of the league tier then lamar makes a throw like that
seriously these mechanics should be better by now
anyone else unreasonably annoyed by that red spot on daltons nose
lamar just hasnt thrown with confidence with proper arm action most of the season when he does you see flashes of his very good arm strength and ziplocation
holding
campbell blocked in the back right at the refs feet
that was a blind side block on campbell towards the line of scrimage
dallas bailing us out more than us playing well tbh
its almost like tucker says this place is a tough place to kick or something
were kinda fucked for next year cuz we shouldnt really pay judon or ngakoue but also our pass rush would be terrifyingly worse without them
get ingram out of the fucking game we need to end this
why are we still rushing ingramjust stop
ingram looks fucking fried please get him off the field
if there is ever an injury on the field in a ravens game there is a 95 chance it is a raven
wow an actual excellent throw and catch
wr 15 will now go back to being known as hollywood brown
holy shit what a throw and catch
bollywood a couple good games away from getting his nickname back
soulja boy up in that ho
watch me crank it watch me roll
so did brown improvise there cuz if so i like it and fuck greg roman
lamar channeling his inner flacco this season making the easy passes look hard and the hard passes look easy
remember this is 4th quarter ravens defence no lead is safe
justin tucker put a hex on zurlein im convinced
historic ljera8 becomes the first player in nfl history with 5000 pass yards and 2500 rush yards in his first 3 seasons ravensflock snfonnbc
what the fuck that was absolutely not a first down
that was not a first down
that was a stupid generous spot for zekes catch
lj fort is a top 3 importance on our defense
harbaughs arm broken or something call a fucking challenge dude
lj fort should have an int
this team is legit all over the place if we could just clean up the dumb shit wed be close to scary good but we been saying this since week 5 so i doubt it
the dallas cowboys kickoff fielding team is a collection of very stupid individuals
stunt on them hoes
that drive was purely run right
the greatest sadness well end the game on 294 rushing yards probably and not crack 300
ez
wolfe has been fantastic
gus edwards now over 100 yards for the game jeffzrebiec
that shot was dirty from the start but they didnt need to gaze at those sad men for so long lol
im so confident that we can send the steelers home if we make it there

but im not confident we can get there
that hug with lamar and jefferson was adorable
erin andrews makes football cleats for cervical cancer and the announcers response is theyre hot dude theyre football cleats for cancer
lmao talking about tucker being automatic now hes gonna miss

edit fucking called it
the monsters are all fully back and the cowboys have 1 starting offensive lineman
the game is not going to be canceled stop acting like the league cares about player or coach safety the owners are in the box they dont give a fuck
dez has to be a rapid test false positive right
never discount dalton in ruining our playoffs chances
its the first drive guys holy smokes our defense always adjusts and comes back stronger
good play lj
fuck fox news
cowboys receivers can catch even behind tmy back

brown ill tip the ball right in front of my fucking face

fucking bum
rewatching the play that ball wasnt catchable and theres obvious dpi once the interception happens brown gets blindsided in a hit that wouldve been called had our defense made it
how often does roman call a passing play where the receivers run more than 5 yards
can steve do us a favor and just dump roman already
lamar td everything is right again
boy i love scoring tds on 4th down
that was a fucking mvp play right there
lamar is my dad
goddamn tucker tried to tackle
tucker just saved a touchdown
can we just appreciate tuckers effort on this busted coverage
lol live shot of board being held by two guys right there
you see how other teams can just get receivers open

why cant a harbaugh team do that
at least if we lose we can just watch football for fun
how do you dpi and give up the td
the players may like wink but he constantly leaves the secondary out to dry only for the blitz to get zero pressure
their average start is on our side of the 50 we got the cobwebs off 3017 final ravens incoming
our wr1 looks like hes 12
stares down the rb come on man how about a passing play with some progressions
fuck aikman and buck and the lineman
fumble interception false start
fuck joe buck im muting rest of the game
anyone else just see dalton screaming into the void
thats crazy queen was able to keep that from hitting the ground
hollywood would have ran backwards before diving forward for a few more yards when the defender got close to him
i really hate that my initial reaction to daltons reaction was fuck you andy

he doesnt deserve that hostility he really is a lovely person
justin tucker the goat once again turning 3 into 7
big brain play by tucker to let us get an extra 4 points very thoughtful
balance has been restored
mm its so sexy to think of my various cardboard cutouts watching that shanked fg attempt
how tf do we keep getting illegal formation penalties such a dumb penalty we get all the time
oh boy another illegal formation call on us thats what like number 50 on us
joe buck tried his best for the double jinx there fucking scumbag
can anyone fucking explain how we get at least 1 illegal formation penalty a game it blows my mind
good job killing another drive with an option toss roman
how do they not know what the fuck the formations are supposed to be

x200b

i dont think any other team has had that particular penalty called so many god damn times on them in one season
remember how we were hyped about hollywood gaining weight this offseason serious question did he shrink
dude this is the week hollywoods finally lost me

its gotten to the point where his lack of effort is killing drives
lmao poor queen down there getting his ass whooped
how is lamb the only guy going up for that ball
i hate andy dalton always plays us tough
were making too many mistakes that we will not get away with next week
i mean they almost had that
we gotta ground and pound from the start and put this game away
averaging 10 yards per run

3rd and 4 pass
wheres the fucking hold
looked like a first down to me
how is our defense ranked 8th
justin tucker has said a few times that mt bank stadium is the hardest place to kick in the league ever since they put in the new scoreboard

it changed the wind patterns and now it swirls more instead of being a static directional wind makes it tough on kickers brettkollmann
why is ingram still getting touches
gotta be honest lamar has looked awful throwing the ball but god damn do i love that man
soulja spotted
that guy wiping lamars visor was gettin after it
lamar cant pass cant he
hollywood gets to keep his name anotha week
jackson haters in shambles
but real talkwe talk shit about brown but that catch remarkable
isnt it crazy how you can see a few kicks before tucker misses one that he is going to miss one soon his kicks will stop being exactly down the middle then he misses one then it resets and he goes back to right down the middle again
marquise has to hit the soulja boi next time he scores
that was the most lamar drive ive ever seen
youd think troy aikman was a porn star with how much hes sucking off the cowboys
that throw what the fuck
cringe at troy calling those cleats hot
i miss sizzle
sounds like a cramp from twitter reports
the refs just completely fucked us on 3 straight plays
bullshit wtf refs
int robbed from us and then a bullshit pi flag
dont worry about the pi yall no one will remember it just that one hold we got away with earlier
how are receivers on other teams consistently wide open but ravens receivers are typically smothered
marcus peters and getting roasted in clutch situations name a better duo
lj fort is one of the hardest players on our d easily
thats a pick we shouldve challenged but i have 0 faith that it wouldve been overturned
lol troy aikman is in shambles right now
no fumbles for zeke i said that shit was coming most fumbles meets most forced fumbles means no fumbles that shit is just so ravens
we definitely got some shit to work on glad we got the w tho
why do we insist on giving them 10 damn yards of cushion every play
lets never play andy dalton ever again
not perfect but we got the dub and lamar is smiling thats enough for this week
i really thought that hail mary was going to happen because its andy dalton and were the ravens lol
obviously props to lamar but that was a good route by hollywood thats the difference a solid receiver corps would make for lamar
the nfl has the money to end homelessness and pretending to care is more disgraceful than acting like your better than it
lets see a peters pick six and a hump punch out for a turnover we score on
as an wft fan pls beat dallass ass
uuuuh dez has covid
lmao this is just so 2020 its fucked
thats fucked glazier says that his test was inconclusive this morning i wonder what protocol is for inconclusive tests around the league there must be a clearly set rule to assume that its negative since they let him get all the way to the field crazy
harbs looks so sad
ok i just tuned into this shit so like why is this game happening if someone just tested positive
our black jerseys are sexy
first time all year our dline has had mcphee campbell judon yannick and bwill on the field at the same time
why is ingram in
i fucking hate greg roman get ingram out of there you fucking idiot
why he run backwards lmao
soulja
get rid of brown and ingram please
nobody wanted to hear anything about it last year but we passed on dk metcalf to take marquise brown
marquise is so bad
when we throw 23 yards passes i seriously dont understand why we dont run the ball
so its 3rd and 5 and were passing it for two yards what
with no mandrews expect lj to force it to marquise like that all game
someone find michael campenaro and offer his hollywoods job
and of course zeke having a terrible year but hes gonna go off on us
i just want to see in my lifetime a stud ravens wr that we draft
if we dont see dobbins this game just fire roman at half time
hes so fast he makes fast people look not fast
lamar is an expert at scoring tds on fourth down
lamar is back babyyyyyy
fine ill do it myself thanos lamar jackson

although brown jr and bozeman were really the ones who made that run possible when they picked up their assignments on the pull
dallas gives up that nice hole and lamar punishes that nice hole
big hold on chris board
thanks for showing the blatant hold
obvious hold on 49
kick the fucking ball through the end zone and be done with it this high kick shit that may allow you to get a stop at the 20 isnt it
ceedee with a 18 year cushion

edit yard cushion
tucker tried
tucker really needs to wrap up there s
wouldnt it be dope if we were just somewhat consistent
ngakoue got pushed down from behind man come the fuck on
yea well this architect had been using an engineering scale on accident
buck and aikman are saying that roman is going to stick with the run because its working so well i thought announcers were supposed to research the teams they are going to call
what the fuck


who jinx tucker
tucker has missed hell has taken over
fuck you joe buck
announcers have some voodoo shit when they say something good about our players
twenty twenty needs to end
diddid justin tucker just miss
fuck you buck and aikman

seriously fuck you
yea im ready to call it quit for the season too dez
that false start is literally our season in a nutshell drive ending penalties taking points off the board
blame the announcers all you want for bullshit make believe hexes

that miss is on the lineman who jumped on a fucking fg attempt

the penalties this year are unreal
queen is trash

lmao shut the fuck up
huge big brain plays by tucker

4 points
fuck yeah

you jinx the goat we take that personally
boykin is better than brown dont me
any of yall bashing lamars throw its clear he was trying to lead boykins forward boykins slowed up a little early
how about a zeke fumble
in a span of 49 seconds

justin tucker misses 36yard fg ending streak of 70 straight inside 40

patrick queen makes first career interception

lamar jackson hits miles boykin for 38yard td

ravens ahead 1410 midway through second quarter jamisonhensley
peters is so scared of getting burnt hes giving up a lot of cushion adjust
gonna say it again we can never have our offense and defense show up at the same time this year
this is some voodoo shit joe buck is actually cursed
there must be a nasty wind there or something
2 minute drill i expect 3 pts minimum
anyone know why the clock started up again after the delay of game seems weird to me
see if tucker misses a field goal you know the is wind is fucking bad
these car commercials crack me up yes honey im surprising you with a 70 thousand dollar truck enjoy the payments
lol this team is going to set a singleseason record for illegal formation penalties
its gotta be a record for most illegal formations in a row
greg roman do you know what a fucking formation is jesus
yes yes every week like clockwork coaches should be ashamed of those illegal formation penalties
joe buck shut the fuck up about tuckers kicks already
the penalty makes it irrelevant but that was such a bad play by hollywood no fundamentals at all
ravens and illegal formation calls name a more iconic duo
illegalformationilldothatagaingoofymemejpg
lol got away with one there
jesus i got some aj green vibes
we got lucky
none of our defenders felt like jumping there lol
i hate prevent defense
if you are curious about how the coaches views queens coverage ability he was the only one rushing in a hail mary situation
dallas has the worst rated everything why isnt this 500
about 9 players were in the vicinity of the ball and lamb was the only one that jumped to catch it
lets be honest even if he does catch that he would be dead before he secured it
the score may say otherwise but the defense hasnt been that great today
dez pulling some mental gymnastics on twitter to confuse everyone
troy aikman looks like he doesnt give crack any breaks
ughhhhh what happened to lamars mechanics
wtf lamar come on dude
lamar looks closer to his 2018 form than his 2019 form
yannick getting held by guy off the street
we are not gonna have a single sack against a horrible o line wow
can we just subin the dlineman we used last week its obvious calais isnt healthy yet
zuerlein small boy tucker big boy
fuck these medical dramas they all look so corny
ingram for 2 is such a sad standard
ingram for 2 yards heard that one before
i love ingram but dude cant hit the hole or do down hill running anymore please stop using him as the rb1
take a shot every time ingram carries for 1 yard on first down
dobbins and gus are cooking lets send out ingram
waiting for the seasonending greg roman injury
every fucking first down run by ingram he hits the middle of the pile 1 yard past the line of scrimmage and goes down can we please please please fucking stop with this play call dobbins and gus have carries of 30 yards ingram couldnt get to 30 yards with 30 carries
steve smith showed how roman runs the exact same plays on every team he went to with zero adjustments if that aint reason enough to move tf on
dobbins for a big gain time to bench him
one of his best throws of the season great job
we can call him hollywood again
alright greg lets have a chat if they can fucking do that why arent you calling it more
i still believe in hollywood brown
rnfl thread has now been silenced
weird how all our best passing plays are from receiver improv and not romans play calling
peters got submarined
wink really does a great job of masking how awful our pass rush is
dezs twitter feed is great i feel bad for him
pat ricard really bitched that guy holy shit lmaoo
rare run of negative yards for dobbins
also the spanish announcers are better if the regular fox sports announcers are their usual dogshit
stop fucking rolling you shits
lamar looks like he is enjoying the game at least
feelin a little bad for boykin tonight thats 2 on lamar that he coulda had
this game has been great

lamar sacked 0 times

boykin and hollywood looking good

250 rushing yards
generous spot
looks like theyre picking on averett
guys lamar just had walkthrough for this game lets chill for a minute
lj is the unsung hero of this defense
keep trashing the d but thats the first td on a full length drive this game for the cowboys
no pass rush overrated pass defense and shit tackling better clean this shit up or browns might hang a 40 piece next week
dallas you are embarrassing yourself

proche is 1000 down lol
clearest onside recovery of all time

fuck off dallas
we need to re sign gus asap
jk rb1 is a hill imma die on for the rest of the season good win tonight boys get better dez
its so nice when lamar plays i seriously dont remember us scoring under 20 anymore normally around 27 mark its not always pretty but god damn this offense consistently puts up big points
all this sad yeehaw music makes me giggle
just panning in on the shame at the end lmao
i hope we can do this next week cle wont be a cake walk
huge win lamar knocked some of the rust off lfg on to cleveland
4h and long lets blitz our best cb
happy lamar makes me happy
this offense is broken

even if that pass had been caught it had zero chance of getting a first

this is after using ingram over dobbins which is indefensible and after 2 or 3 motions for a 4yard pass

wut
harbaugh was a special teams coach
i dont wanna play another game on fox with joe buck again

devil type shit going on
second half bingo
greg roman taking dobbins out of the game
pass pass pass punt 3 out
awful 4th down call
andy dalton 4th long
dropped int
fuck you joe buck
tell me why they pull me from warming up so i can go get tested my shit come back positive i tested positive for covid wtf dezbryant

interesting bryant was not on the field for the team warmups jeffzrebiec
lmao what kinda protocols do they have that someone tests positive like 30 mins before the game starts
damn bro i wanted to see the x tonight
tired of this bullshit season
foxs whole broadcast plan just went in the trash because dez isnt out there man its like he and the team are cursed
okay they got a first down fire harbaugh jackson roman and decosta
yall see dezs tweet from a few minutes ago he basically said he quits
get ingram off the fucking field
marquise doing the usual run back towards where the ball was throw from lol its like an instinct
why did brown run backwards fight for yardage and dont be soft
dobbins having a year but all we see is ingram we really need a young oc
too much ingram already
damn good job soulja
im so fucking sick of brown hes a fucking bust just admit it and moveon stop tanking games for him
man we would have had a run like thatif dobbins got the start
brown just shows no effort never seen him try to catch a ball that wasnt placed perfectly
hey look a pass slightly behind but the receiver still brings it in does brown know thats a possibility
greg who the fuck is jk dobbins roman
the ball wasnt catchable because hollywood is tiny if that was dez it would be a catch which leads back to the point how did we field an offense in the offseason adding no weapons
hey gr i like ingram as a person but jk is better rn use him
on this weeks episode of

lets see how quickly the defense fatigues due to the offenses bullshit
ravens receivers tonight

marquise brown 59 1st round pick

miles boykin 3rd round pick with 351 career yards

devin duvernay 3rd round rookie with 199 yards

james proche 6th round rookie

luke wilson practice squad rookie te

eric tomlinson practice squad rookie te
look at that we give it to someone besides ingram and we get yards
black on black looking
theres that 2019 ravens play call
this game better be a huge confidence boost for everyone
so basically if its 4th and 2 you always run it with lamar td every time
lmao bradley bozeman
lol was that bozeman signaling td 3 steps into that run
the best part of that is bozeman at the line the entire way lmao
here i am saying to my tv screen dont go for it on 4th and 2 just kick the 54 yard field goal or whatever it is tucker can tie this up the offense who the hell knows shows what i know
we can thank tucker for that no td
special teams what the fuck
that sums up the 2020 ravens right there
okay its not opi but thats a horrible pi call
marlon choking as announcers are singing his praises smh
how come when we play a team that struggles in certain areas they become gods at it against us
hollywood is a very solid 2 or 3 option but we need to get a real wr 1 to let him shine
again any one being a doomer we were down 14 last night remember that
high af in my abode in downtown dallas and thinking about going to 711 to flex my lamar jersey
honestly these past few weeks our oline has been very good great news considering stanley is out for the year
theyve proven they can run it up the middle i dont know why the ravens would do anything else

greg roman
he fucking jinxed it dickhead
fuck
its ok tucker we still love u
knew he was gonna miss lmao
roman has the be the most brain dead oc i ever saw
fucking announcer jinx my god
are we really about to beat ourselves again
dude this madden curse is fucking next level this year hoooooooly shit
i dont believe in jinxes but thats some voodoo bullshit if ive ever seen it
im not mad at tucker bozeman fucked up that first perfect one
justin tucker is so good that he purposely missed the fg so that we could get 7

big brain goat
bah gawd thats boykins music
alright weve toyed with them enough time to pour it on
the fact that this abysmal ass cowboys team gets to have prime time games for half of their season every year is criminal
wheres the guy who was in here calling queen trash game day thread gotta be the most reactionary shit ever lol
i just want to single out the fox music supervisor i am loving the grateful dead widespread panic playlist

throw some greensky bluegrass trampled by turtles and make fun of phish while youre at it
please for the love of all that is holy lets keep some momentum here tired of this swing shit
offense is sleep defense is awake offense is awake defense falls asleep lol
wolfe is definitely one of the most underrated ravens
offense starts doing well

defense lol wut do
winks pass defense is sucking ass tonight

dudes just wide open
these fucking announcers jinxed both kickers lol
jesus two missed fgs after a penalty whos at b dubs
tuesday games are cursed
why did the clock still run after the delay of game
11 point lead at half get ball back and score again to start the second half make it happen
hopefully lamar trusts boykin more
roman please use dobbins as rb1
uh that kind of penalty is what the fuck

does 25 on the cowboys even know how to play football that ball wasnt catchable probably but the refs called that because willson was mauled
god damnit our weekly illegal formation foul fucking shambolic and amateur every week
our weekly illegal formation penalty
how are we always drawing illegal formations
illegal formation

drink
how do the coaches not see illegal formation calls every game as a problem
joe buck trying so hard for the threepeat
boykin brown
how many illegal formations are we going to see until harbaugh realizes the offense is fucking broken with roman
i cant stand how much of a bum brown is
give dobbins the ball this is not hard
so sick of the illegal formations every week
my girlfriend always jokingly asks if hollywood is marques brownlee and im pretty sure hed be an upgrade
roman brain transplant petition
harris has been solid these past couple weeks
why does wink leave lamb open every fucking play
that we mostly stonewalled pittsburgh offense 6 days ago and are now getting shredded by the dallas cowboys makes no sense
dalton is smart hes getting the ball out super quick no time for the ravens to get a good rush without blitzing
false start hello
rush 1 lol
lamb only one who jumped wtf
at least queen was actually trying couldve very easily just half assed it like the passion there
wish we had cd instead of soulja
why is marlo getting so wrecked
our secondary playing like booty tonight
need to score on the drive to start the half and start putting this game out of reach
lamar has zero touch on the ball this year no pressure receiver is open overthrows it
jesus lamar sailed it again
that was a horrendous throw man
3rd and 4 with this defense should have run the ball
why is hill on the field every 3rd down
fuck his arm mechanics have regressed at least his legs mechanic improvements are still intact
terrible pass
this drive was exactly like that 1 guy described right as the half ended roman the predictable lol
troy is so fucking biased lmao its pathetic
how is that allowed their linemen just literally tackled our pass rusher as soon as he started to have an angle at dalton number 78 of the cowboys just pushed him in the back knocking him down when he otherwise had a free shot at dalton thats 100 a penalty and yet again no flag
wheres the block on the back they did on campbell
at the rate our dline is playing the only chance we have of touching dalton is at the post game handshake
cmon lamar redeem yourself
i really dont get how the refs arent calling holding on the cowboys oline the right tackle especially
bro lamar is out here fixing the oline because they are gonna get a goddamn illegal formation
another rush to ingram up the middle for 2 to fuck us for the next 2 plays
this offense has deep issues its an empty stadium so its no communication issues they just dont know the plays
lettssss fucking gooo hell of a catch
dobbins is the best player on our roster yet roman doesnt even fucking know it
i was just kidding about what i said earlier hollywood and lamar are perfect in every way
td hollywood
they finally succeeded with that play yessss
where you clowns talking shit about him 3 seconds ago you either stick with our guy or you go watch patrick mahomes or something
hows he make that throw but will overthrow a guy 10 years down field
wheres that throw been all season damn what a throw what a catch
lamar can absolutely throw outside the numbers he needs a receiver
lmao just as i say something about lamars passing he throws a dime sorry for doubting you
this offense is so deadly when lamar is accurate on his throws good instincts by hollywood and great pass man i cant get over how pretty that was
wtf was that by chuck soft push lets him get an extra 8 yards
do we have a sack yet this game
i feel like our secondary looks the same against every team they play off and allow 10 yard catches over and over its like deja vu
obligatory lj fort batdown per game
damn lj fort is having a good game
lets put this away i dont feel like being tired tomorrow because the andy dalton led dallas cowboys made it close and i had to stay up until the last 30 seconds
our pass rush sucks we should trade for yannick ngakoue
if we win ravens player of the week greg zurlein
f to their kicker hes getting fired
thank god ricard is okay
how about that jinx troy you fucking cunt
tucker shocking miss

zuerlein hold my beer
i really hope we keep gus and dobbins for their careers
lets fucking gooo lamar there are children watching this game probably idk
best part about this game i think is that lamar is finally taking what the defense is giving him on pass plays hes not trying to force a pass when he can scramble
at least we made the field goal
lamar def needs work on his passes but his footwork and running has been good this game
i think lamar needs a good week of practice maddeningly inconsistent tonight
troy aikman cleat fetish confirmed
i am sorry but those cleats are ugly as fuck
that was not a first these fucking refs
lol what he was at least a half yard short
there was a holding a couple plays back that prevented a sack
i will be dejected if roman is the oc in 2021 completely tear down and rebuild the offense lamarthe o is so close to consistent greatness
jamison hensley tweeted hes walking around and fine
i get the realists i do we have issues we arent a sb contender but this sub is so absurdly negative all the time its honestly draining
kind of hard to stop them on the goaline for like 8 plays straight
peters is having an awful year
can we just have one fucking game where the refs are consistent
f u c k t h e r e f s
silver lining is bwill looks great blew up three straight runs at the goal line wish we had him against henry
we miss jimmy smith badly the secondary is atrocious when hes out
get another td fuck the refs
refs trying to f us on the onside kick but then they remember the game is on camera
proche has great hands needs more opportunities in the passing game
who else heard gus hee hee ing
we havent abandoned the run and its the 4th what is this sorcery
wonder if they are doing lamar runs to get his confidence back up
we need need this confidence next week is gonna be a battle
they are feeling sorry for the cowboys
i kinda feel bad for the cowboys

edit jk you morons
this was needed onto cleveland thinking we basically need to win out one step of the way there lj still has many issues he needs to fix same with the rest of the team but if we are gonna go somewhere its gonna be on his back and of course the defense
its been a month

but we finally got a win
dalton completing a 4th down in the bank lol
elliot with the hammer damn
i know some of this was garbage time but really not thrilled about andy dalton going for damn near 300 on this defense
this shit was messy we have 5 days to clean up fuck the browns fuck the steelers fuck covid mnf we running the table
this defense definitely doesnt resemble the ravens defense of old we dont wrap when we tackle and we dont lay the wood consistently enough to make the offense think twice about testing us
im so fucking done with fox announcers
aikman literally crying in the booth
lamars fundamentals have gotten so wonky i swear he didnt throw lazy ass passes like that last year
keep in mind lamar had one practice before this game after covid
we get back to our roots and look at that our team actually looks like theyre having fun for like the second time all year let these souljas run the ball and then it opens up the passing game its not rocket scienece lets go
lamar needs to fix the bad throws or else we wont be able to beat cleveland
i think its time to be honest this team is mediocre as fuck were not bad but were not good either
hollywood brown actually sucks upvote party
jesus fuck they jinxed the fuck out of that one there
this sub in classic fashion but why are we passing


because sometimes you have to do that especially when the wrs are getting open like they did on that one

lamar needs to be more accurate
nice job escaping not so nice job throwing the ball
130 am but my ravens are playing

lets get this flock
dez tested positive for covid 40 minutes before the game
saw ravens gm eric decosta hustle onto the field to talk to ravens coach john harbaugh during warmups i imagine this was the topic jeffzrebiec
im not very smart but it would seem that if someone tests positive who was already warming up on the field they have to cancel the game am i thinking about this wrong
dez hasnt quit shit hes emotional he said he has done everything right follows a routine and is confused how he got it this was a huge game for him he is emotional i promise you he will be back no dez slander hes been a mature fiery leader for a team who should already have leaders hes emotional i remember when my work caught it and i worked with 2 people who had it and i was sure i had it i was emotional worried he will calm down
what a shit show wow
jerry rigged the test
fucking dalton
lj fort making a tackle that i want put these fuckers into the grass
need a 3 td team galvanizing win
i dont understand why ingram is still a feature back when its so blindlingly clear that hes not even the second best back on the roster rn

most frustrating thing about the team rn for me
someone tell soulja hes supposed to run the other way
brown is a fucking bum
lol told yall nothing was changing
this passing attack is just pathetic not timing no accuracy no playmaking no intellegence
fire greg
where the fuck is dobbins bro why arent we pounding the rock
boykin caught alot more shit for less bad plays

and he didnt go tweeting stuff he couldnt back up either
wow look at that the no name cowboys te can catch a ball that he has to reach for a lil bit watcg and learn hollywood
see bad throw but it was caught
marquise brown a bust
i hate this fucking red head so much
holy shit looks like we havent learned any lessons lol shitty playcalling on offense and no dobbins jfc
if this season has proven anything its that if this game comes down to the offense winning for us weve already lost
it hit brown square in his hand not like it was finger tips
what a fucking shame we have to count on hollywood tonight
someone tell roman that receivers can run other routes than 3yard inroutes
there ya go souljia hell yeah brother fantastic play you just got 4 yards
welcome back 8 weve missed you
that was a fuck you td
4th and 2 long td where have i seen that before

lets go lamar
fuck a first down
shades of 2019 lets do more of that
god he is so fun to watch
thats my freaking qb lets go
see what happens when you put in jk and gus and commit to the run it opens up the qb run
that was a big fuck you to greg and john
fucking awesome run but for the love of god please get ingram and brown the fuck out of this game


he back
ive tried to limit myself commenting in these threads because i always overreact but did yall see lamar telling the special teams to stay on the sideline for that 4th and 2 thats the shit i love about him need that confident spark back badly
lol well we hadnt seen special teams totally shit itself for a bit so i guess it was time they joined the offense and defense
harbaugh has some experience as a special teams coach
nice double hold on one guy jesus christ lmao
cut tucker mfer cant even make a simple tackle s
well there should be a horse collar flag
super obvious holding on 49 during return
the cowboys literally never turn over the ballthey already have a turnover

the cowboys special teams is the worst in the nfl
huge hold on 59
aight lets just boot it out the endzone now
kick it out the back of the fucking endzone every time
i have not missed the heartattack games
all we need is the defense to make a terrible play and weve completed the trifecta in the first half
offense wakes up and everything else shuts down nice
thats just bad defense by humphrey
im about to drink some wine and cope dezbryant
gus bussss
its clear that ingram should be the 3 and it hurts for me to say because i fucking love that dude
gus bus
38 toss a 3 yard pass to the sidelines

the architect of the baltimore ravens offense
i blame that miss on the commentator
you can fuck off joe
gonna be one of those games boys what can go wrong will go wrong
absolutely cursed season the fuck
fuck the announcers
fuck you troy
tucker has made 70 straight
lol fuck you joe
stfu commentators you always jinx it
joe buck is the worst bro jinxed marlo now tuck fuck
literally speechless fuck the announcer curse
why does our middle line backer have better hands than our 1 wr
i like how boykin used both arms to catch that td
he finally did it
tucker missed on purpose to set that up
tucker obviously missed on purpose because he knew that would happen goat
im sorry did boykin actually use his size to secure a catch
how many of yall had to start deleting your comment you had typed up about us throwing on first down
wheres that penguin meme

miss out on 3 points due to missed fg

immediately intercept and get 7 points instead
for a second i thought they were going to show me some ptsd inducing footage that andy dalton caused our team once
limited practice time may be whats getting to our defense
just weird watching every other team throw to wide open receivers 5060 percent of the time for all the shit we give our d its one of the better units in the league if that can happen against our d why the hell cant our offense make that happen with the most mobile qb in nfl history
defense is soft
this is some dean pees shit
a reminder that cowboys top 3 wrs are legit 1s these guys are great dbs are still very good
have we gotten a single qb pressure
can this game please not be close
please sir some ass rush

may i get to the qb please
holy cow mccarthy is angry
yikes our pass rush is actually still horrendous even after yannicks signing
lmao i love the facial expressions of players when someone misses a kick
i watch those two lady announcers on amazon prime theyre better than buck and aikman to me they dont slob on teams knob they just talk about the game and go
hsjdjdodkowowosis jdjdjdodksi go boys troy aikman
dobbins gotta be rb1 moving forward
hey greg maybe we should uh maybe me should give dobbins a shot there bud
lol aikman dude got mauled before the ball got to him how would you know its not catchable
soulja sighting
the slot soulja
its a good thing roman can bench dobbins at half time like usual prick
another illegal formation the ravens remain so frustratingly stupid
it is unfathomably unacceptable for us to be getting this many illegal formation penalties this season
that was absolutely horrendous by hollywood
that effort to toe drag was awful marquise is shit
absolutely fucking embarrassing the number of illegal formation penalties this year

and they just keep happening every single week
watching ceedee lamb out there really makes me jealous we desperately need separation and playmaking from our receivers
this offense literally could not be more cursed

an illegal formation penalty again for the 12th game in a row

rushing to snap the ball when you have 3 timeouts and when a score with possession to start the 3rd could be game

rolling lamar out to one half of the field so taking away 50 of the grass which has not worked all year

and the throw is not good enough anyway to keep hollywood inbounds

i love this team i swear i do but our offense is barely functional
wr coaches are to blame at this point theyre training these dudes to stay off the line one way or another
im more upset with how we waste our first and 2nd down gaining 3 yards once we get in the redzone
we cant let this team hang around man this cannot be another titans game we need to put them away by the fourth
i hope harbaugh chews these guys out the cowboys are atrocious
damn we got lucky they didnt throw that flag
but that wasnt catchable
ravens get screwed by the refs every week and no announcers ever stick up for us lol
wow the refs gave us that is this what it feels like to be pittsburgh minus being complete fucks
honestly was catchable dodged a couple bullets there
this defense does not have the same energy man idk whats going on
my fucking heart

i was prepared for it cause dalton voodoo
glad we are up at half but if this is the team we are bringing to cleveland next week we will be in for a rude awakeningfuck the browns fuck the steelers
i think im going to make tucker as my first cyberpunk character
that was way too close for comfort lamb almost had that one
the cowboys are awful in the second half put this away
pls just put this game away theres no reason we should only be up by 7 next week is going to be insane
who wants a bet the first play is an incompletion to hollywood to start the half

edit well ill be damned
161 rush yards my god
shut the fuck up about the pi refs suck what else is new no constant mention when it happens to us
why the fuck does he sidearm shit man when he doesnt need to
bad pass
why he throw short

because every throw that is 5 yards downfield is ridiculously high
he was open dude
come on lamar fuck
where tf was the holding call wtf who else saw that shit
was that fort getting literally held to the ground
cant say the refs arent giving us calls
im not gonna be a bitcj thats a bad spot
what is even considered a hold anymore
the kicker for the cowboys looks like the main character from la noire
i think they should place a random cut out of waldo randomly in the bleachers so we can try to find him during the game
where the hell is dobbins he hasnt been on the field for any snaps in this half yet i dont think
someone please go explain to greg that you can pass on first down

while youre at it make sure he knows what play action is
3rd and 8

time for a 3 yard pass to hollywood that is 4 feet over his head
lamar cant pass
another horrible throw
hollywood actually got open and it was a trash throw
we have the worst pass offense in the nfl we arent moving on from lamar so its time to change ocs
thats on lamar shit needs to get fixed
if lamar can just be a league average passer hes an mvp candidate again just be average king love that throw
now that was a beaut
holy fuck was that pretty
ok hollywood i wont shit talk you anymore for now
soulja
good catch by brown there ive been critical but that was 100 great play and a real dime throw
that was a fantastic job by hollywood and lamar holy shit
perfect goddamned throw
thats vintage 2019 hollywood
thats exactly why marquis brown would be very dangerous if there was a big physical wr1 on the team too hed be that second guy who could maybe improvise or burn somebody
this team baffles me its does some great things and then so many questionable things just remain consistent
call god
is this what its like to have s o u l j a s
hollywood soulja brown called god and he answered
what a throw
where has that connection been all year
yooooo that was a sexy pass and catch
brown talking shit to the db he got his confidence back
that is what is so frustrating about lamar we know he can make the throws his mechanics seem so simple to point out and fix it makes it frustrating when he drops his arm on throws for no reason
thats the point of having souljahs and using them i guess
that was beautiful
maybe the most impressive play yet for this duo lets go
damn lamar looks like a college qb on a bunch of throws and then makes an amazing throw while on the run wild
we should make lamar throw that pass 50 times each practice
say it with me roman abandon the run
lmao peters
i wish jimmy smith werent constantly slightly injured
4th quarter ravens defense starting a few minutes early i see
blitzing marlo should be an automatic jail sentence
zero pash rush against the worst o line in the league
i may be wrong but ive noticed this season past few weeks especially the d seems to be playing prevent maybe the opportunistic approach just looks that way but teams have just been marching down field and then fizzling out in the red zone
mt has ended this mans career
feel bad for zuerlein
gus would be a star on another team we are so lucky we have him as a number 2 option
looked like lamar got that 1st down to me not sure about that spot
lol lamar rude af
i like seeing good sportsmanship
my god 70 yards on 5 rushes edwards is insane
i love seeing lamar playing excited like this
fuck troy aikman
i feel like this is the first time this season lamar has had fun
its good to see lamar smiling again thats the vibe we need
can harbaugh see need some defroster glasses
ffs get 7 let me sleep its 3am
this is the first game that felt like 2019

take me back
with mandrews out there wed look even better in the red zone
what a shit fucking spot wow
look how fast bowsers first step is jesus
classic averett
lets hope marlon isnt hurt
ill give avereet a pass he had 1 practice as well straight off of ir he was playing well before injury i think hell be okay
honestly averret has played pretty well tonight having just come off an injury he plays hard and fast
jesus christ these referees
pussy pi call on that
yo fort picked that
why did harbs not throw the fucking challenge flag
that was an int
get after that ref chuck
refs fuck us again
brandon williams is so valuable
how do they not even review that pick smh
bout had enough of aikman sucking off the boys for the year
tf are the cowboys cheering about we clearly recovered it


god texans are dumb lol
big boi no little boi
tell us how you really feel troy
is that lamar laughing
lamar

i love the enthusaism and desire to run

but pleeease get down earlier rn my dude youre too important to this team
dobbins walking right in
eazy money
objs soundbites are gold
easy money
theres my extra td

easy money
lets go dobbins taking us to the dub and me to the 1 seed
easy money
the blocking there literally made me coomb in my pants
havent heard lawrence called once tonight

orlando might actually play better at lt than the right side
i want one more ravens td call me greedy
lol fox wrong for that
man dropping both the pats and titans games really sucks win just one of those and wed have breathing room to drop a game down the stretch oh well hope we beat the brakes off the browns
harbs gonna get in trouble for that lol
funny as hell seeing a bunch of grown men act like commentators curse is a real thing
ngakue still missing
i love how butthurt aikman and troy are over the no call pi and failed hail mary
fuck the cowboys lets go ravens

giants fan
erin andrews is a 10
lamar putting this organization on his back once again
jesus please show that replay of peters
fort deserves a fat bag with the heart he brings every week
man dont yall miss the ravens defense thatd get at least 3 sacks and a couple turnovers a game
lamar is covering up this awful playcalling
btw jk dobbins banged my girlfriends cousin during his time at osu
marlo

what are you standing around dumbfounded for

you deadass just let him score bro
vibes in these game threads
so sick of the nfl with these commerical breaks a fucking commerical 2 seconds before the 2 minute warning
did you know dez tested positive and isnt playing
yeah im not paying yannick let him walk
fuck these refs man

3 straight blown calls
dobbins ran through their d like he did my girlfriends cousin
i just wish dez could have taken part in this he has a big chip on his shoulder with the cowboys i dont think he would have gone to a team that wasnt going to play the cowboys this year
lamar had 1 day of practice and has 3tds and 200 plus total yards and a 70 percent completion percentage
campbell and williams are back jimmy is out
weird playing dalton lol
its been two years since i was this nervous before a game
anyone else want to see skip have a melt down tomorrow
for those who cant see the game because of local reasons its available on amazon prime
ive been drinking bloody marys for the past few games and weve lost tonight im breaking out the baileys lets go boys
no dez
wtf is up with this team and covid

regardless must win game here to keep pace in afc
really sucks any chance dezs test is a false positive not talking about him playing at this point obviously
that andy dalton artwork was fucking horrifying
fuck andy dalton
forts visor gives me ray lewis vibes
ingram lost all of his explosiveness
the fact ingram continues to get work over dobbins is astonishing
wrong way hollywood
hollywood just gives up 2 yards for no reason after the catch he needs to stop running backwards
what a garbage ass first drive fuck roman
utter dogshit from brown get your fucking hands up or please just cut yourself from this team
3rd and 8 lets throw a 5 yard pass to the 57 guy whos covered
ah yes love gifting the worst defense in the nfl an easy interception on our first drive of the game
use both hands maybe
lmao souljas
marquise catch ball run backwards drop ball cause interception
bollywood brown
marquise was drafted off hype and name value alone this dude is such a dud im almost embarrassed by how much i was hyping him up to all my football buddies that summer guy is going to be cfl bound in no time
i swear if andy dalton ruins another fucking day for me
marquise brown is a waste of fucking time
we gotta get lamar a different car pool man stop forcing it to this bum because hes your ride home hell ill call the uber myself
hollywood is not meant to be catching passes in trafficmiddle of the field
good stop in a bad situation now keep ingram the fuck off the field
lets get jamarr chase
i once again ask that when we pass we call multiple routes more than 3 yards down the field
lamar is not above criticism but roman does this shit every where he goes he is the constant source in offenses regression when hes the coordinator
might need to part ways with ingram
hollywood is putting in 0 effort since his tweet

im over it

with the few targets that dez has gotten this season hes shown 2x as much effort
what is this bullshit give carries to dobbins
use gus gets 7 yards

gro duhh ingram right
i swear we waste first downs every single game
go for it
theres lamars fire
m v p
thats my qb
stunt on them
fucking hell yeah beutifull
oh how i missed lamar
oh lamar is back telling john to keep him on the field and scoring out of it
thank you lamar for calling the shot on that 4th we need more of that
thats what i want to see from this team lamar taking control showing passion and making great plays
it isnt lamars speed thats impressive its his acceleration he goes 0100 just like that damn
see

its not hard

stop giving the ball to the broken tires
lamar looks back to normal he was never as fast this year when he had that groin injury preseason
tucker prolly calls that a miss wasnt right down the middle
lamar said stop being a pussy im gonna score real quick harbs
finally keep running lamar thats what makes him special
you see ravens fan stop being down and have some faith in your team
our offense is literally lamar we gotta help the man out
lamar mvp jackson thats six
god bless lamar jackson
that clip of lamar telling the sideline that hes got this and then running that td in is all time gonna be on his career highlight video
fuck passing we can just run our way into the playoffs ala 2018 ravens
you guys remember how we threw to a te for like 14 yards lets fucking do that more christ gro takes years off my heart
lamar is ready to have some fun again
why not just kick it out like normal teams do
i hope they mention john coming up on special teams
well that didnt take long
tucker for defensive player of the week
wow lmao chris board held too no call
wide fucking open
dont tell me were gonna lose to the cowboys
very unlike our st unit i bet harbs is pissed but i guarantee there was a missed call in there hes more pissed at
this also happened against the patriotslet me remind you

the offense gets on the board with a td in the second drive

and the defense let a limited offense drive the field for a td

now this time it is the special teams
thats that shit i dont like
i love when commentators compliment someone and they immediately give up a play
opi and cowboys oline holding like crazy but na its all on marlon
so does offensive line holding not exist
jesus we struggle to play disciplined football man wtf
feed jk
run game is working well time for roman to stop running it like we did against the titans
oh you think g ro will stay with the run do you troy care to make a wager
fucking greg stupid roman
hill is growing on me
fuck you aikman dont try to jinx the goat
lol this is so 2020
dr pepper jail
jesus they did jinx him wtf
how tf do you false start on a field goal cmon bruh
he actually jinxed it
fuck these announcers they always try to jinx stuff like this
joe fuck
ayyy fuck these announcers lmao
joe buck you son of a bitch
fucking aikman still playing for the cowboys
on the one hand if we lose maybe were one step closer to firing gro
one gus bus run and a bunch of garbage play calls roman special
fuck you troy aikmen and tony romo fuck the cowboys why do you all hate tucker
fuck the announcers
fuck joe buck with a 10 foot spiked rod
cool cool cool cool cool cool cool
all my homies hate joe buck
kneel for the queen
thank you for missing tucker 4d chess
boykin
boykin making plays baby hes a soulja
somebody in my neighborhood is shooting off fireworks cuz they just scored pasadena
tuckers sacrifice wasnt in vein
miles boykin soulja
we called a different route concept
awesome play by jackson and boykin good to see boykin play his size and just run through arm tackles
jackson 5 incoming tn
tucker ill just miss this field goal right here so we can get 7 in two plays
people have gone from shitting on boykin to shitting on hollywood
that chick in the mirror ad has a great ass
i know tucker missed but how do you get a false start on a field goal
this pass rush just isnt getting there
d is playing way too soft too much cushion
i would love of we could get a sack
all the money we invest in this defence cant even get a sack against the worst o line
lmao its poetry
so penalty before the kick equals missed kick is that the new rule
something is in the air
at least the announcers are jinxing equally
can we get a td i want to be comfy
finally changed my flair from ingram to dobbins lets go
td here would calm my nerves defense needs to tighten up offense needs to keep pounding the ball
chance to double on points here and after the half lets get it
points here and to start the second half
troy aikman has a permanent cowboy penis in and around his mouth
gro irl rn after that run take him out of the goddamn game
troy aikman and joe buck is just fucking miserable man lmao
hate that play call
why do they question an obvious penalty against the ravens but when an obvious holding call was shown on the replay for the cowboys big kick return they dont say anything but just compliment the returner bs
hey announcerswe are in baltimorenot dallas
almost 200 rushing yards in the first half holy
every game illegal formation
every fucking week how
oh look an illegal formation penalty im shocked
seriously bench marquise
how the hell do we have 1 illegal formations a game when no other teams ever have them
the illegal formation flag is the greatest meme of all time
another illegal formation coaches do your job and teach the players what that means
this might be the most undisciplined ravens team ive seen in 10 years because wtf
new streak begins
i swear just dont run that pitch anymore
yall remember hollywood last year how was he better with a screw in his foot
just let the man kick in peace
if i was decosta i would be standing over romans shoulder in the booth every game
no reason for ingram to see the field in the 2nd half
if we play like this cleveland gonna run for 500 yards
our defense is allergic to stops tonight
how have we not gotten to dalton their oline is swiss chesse
yo bowser exploded off the line
just imagine if we had these wrsomg
dline struggling against dudes off the street
seriously surprised dalton signed with the cowboys he should have walked into the bears starting spot
that boykin touchdown would have been dezpoor fella
def got away with one but shut the fuck up troy you fucking cuck
buck and aikman are actually like horrendous
ten cents says a makeup call is coming
that was just terrible officiating
they refs are going to give one backnto the cowboys for that missed call and its going to hurt later
got away with that one but holy troy i know you played for the cowboys but you dont have to sound so dejected they didnt call it
troy is thinking 65 yard field goal attempt is the smart move
i hate andy dalton hail marys
holy shit lamb was super close to bringing that down
lol none of our guys even jumped
makes me sick knowing we took hollywood the pick before montez sweat
real talk can we do tuesday night football from now on instead of thursday

1 more day of rest for players 3 straight days of prime time football
people complaining about the defense are insane the two scoring drives were for ten points on 49 yards total and dalton has been getting the ball out quickly which prevents the pass rush from getting home
prepare to say goodbye to dobbins again
god erin andrews is so fucking hot
lamar needs to get his arm situation settled
lamar really needs to throw lower
who is surprised we went run pass pass after half time
poor fucking throw
thats on lamar bad throw
counting the pi to wilson lamar has overthrown 2 deep balls so far

if boykin catches that in stride he might still be running
wtf was that throw
what happened to that qb guru that lamar worked with
just geez these are easy passes that every nfl quarterback should make
lmfao wtf ngakoue gets pinned to the ground and no holding but theres a phantom holding call on that fair catch punt
we have no pass rush what else is new to the oblivious people not understanding how were getting fucked on
this pass rush is pathetic
whats a pass rush
bro where are the holds refs
isnt the cowboys oline severely depleted im shocked we havent sacked dalton yet
are the kickers not accounting for the speed at which the earth is spinning
pass rush needs to wake tf up
campbell did not look happy moving around in that replay still hurt thoughts
we better win this cowboys are gifting this to us
capitalize fellas
does greg understand play action
ozzie goat sighting
put dobbins in the fucking game gro what the absolute fuck is your problem
lol all that work presnap for a 1 yard gain
ingram with the explosive two yards
jk still has 5 rushing attempt why these coaches dont wanna win
ingram just took the wrong hole there
see this is why reason 746336273737 why roman is an idiot ingram just doesnt have it so in a close game youre gonna put him in instead of your backs that are averaging over 10 ypc give me a fucking break i hate greg roman so much
dobbins average 10 ypc again please fucking use him
ingram is washed probably gone in the offseason
we should have been seeing mostly gus and jk by like week 4 the fact that theyre still giving ingram significant carries this deep into the season is absolutely nuts like its not just a small drop off its a fucking cliff
these plays fucking suck and when we do throw its a checkdown or its inaccurate
yeah troy its almost like lamar is hard to tackle or something
dobbins finally in and gets 6

shocking
dude dobbins has been tonight
i love hearing how disappointed troy is every time we make a play lol
dobbins is electric
wow greg its almost as if we do better when that dobbins guy is in
dobbins hits the line of scrimmage at such a high speed every time
the only time ingrahm should get a snap is when dobbins wants to eat a donut on the sideline
all this running is great but my man cant be missing these passes
that was fucking beautiful
soulja boy up in that ohhhhh
hollywood
where are the hollywood haters lets go
soulja he did things
hell of a throw hell of a catch
soulja boy tell em
a fucking dime
are we giving him back is hollywood nickname or are we waiting a week
that brown illustration is gonna give me nightmares
that shit was beautiful by both lamar and hollywood

goddamn

more pls
that was an amazing td nice throw by lamar and nice catch by brown im a proud ravens fan right now
peters got lit up
were missing our big man in jimmy
grounding
that is ridiculously fucking obvious how are refs so consistently incompetent
stop fucking blitzing
aj brown level of tackling
i think i forgot what a sack is and how it occurs
unsung hero must be between derek wolfe lj fort and maybe tyus bowser this year
holy shit we got a sack
hollywood thats mean great throw action jackson dezbryant
what is this sack concept you refer to
only took 53637583 blitzs
wait youre allowed to tackle the qb
foot on the throat now
quick shoutout to jimmy smith it shows when we dont have him out there miles better than averett
yo tuck might have missed but lets all be thankful our kicker is not complete ass
didnt know patrick had a son lol
ricard just bounced that bitch
so pat ricard is back thats good to see
ooof thats alot of guy falling on jackson
ljax slide dammit
was lurking the cowgirls subreddit and saw this

i think we are owed some of baltimores draft picks if any of our players end up with covid in the next 5 days

yeah because its our fault the nfl decided to continue the game what an idiot lmfao
thats the only play ive ever seen dobbins make a bad decision
back to highlight jackson
lets fucking go
lamar having fun ive missed this
lol all love between lamar and cowboys defense
that ypc for gus and dobbins is stupid good
say what you want about lamar but hes special just needs more time
why tf was that a rollout that was stupid
bad throw but wtf was that playcall
you gotta hit that pass lamar
man lamar has looked like old lamar tonight while running but these passes are rough
lamar shouldve had that but also jesus christ end zone rollouts are awful

the only reason he had a chance for that throw was extending the play after nobody was open
anyone see greg romans tin of copenhagen lmao
lamar throwing so many shitty throws and you can still see how much better our offense is with him
lets go ravens going up 3110 would be awesome
bro if our defense doesnt get it together this week the browns are gonna smash us but also fuck the browns
hump please be ok
i still cant believe they gave elliott the first down on that catch he was without a doubt short it wasnt even really close
should have challenged that fort catch
lol but that is a flag
man that was a pick dude
shouldve challenged wtf man
fuck the fuckin refs fuck them all
big baby is the heart of this defense and no one can tell me different
peters totally lost
marcus peters gets burnt too often
fuckin peters
peters wasted the goal line stand fuck man
mp juice man likes to give up a lot
two all pro cb just watched cooper catch that
if the big play happens on 3rd d will 100 give one up on 4th
how come chuck and aikman are not crying about forts pick like the cried about the blown call in the first half
wtf cowboys are idiots
the announcers actually thinking that was debatable
did yall hear lamar screaming
gus is so god damn good dobbins gus has to be our 12 next year
easy

money
why in the absolute fuck are you making lamar run in this situation
ez money
ingram laughs like a little girl and im here for it
easy money
easy money
easy

money
the dagger
easy money
dobbins single handedly win my fantasy game with that td lol
energy is back in the team
easy money
dobbins
man that actually makes me sad to look at lol
we can outrun the clowns if we only use dobbins and gus bus except for rest of course
dalton outmanuvering our rushers would be funnier if this wasnt a longterm problem and we have to basically win out to make the playoffs
peters almost had that
good to get a win now lets bake some brownies
if we cant dominate the cowboys we dont deserve to win any more games
we legit gonna make the cowboys look like a good team huh
i just fucking hate the commentators every fucking week i wonder when he is going to miss again will it be this kick
hi my name is greg roman

i dont know how to run an offense
why are people blaming gro for passing there the call was great boykin scores a td if that ball is accurate

stop blaming gro when he actually does a good job
lamar gets flack for a bad pass but its like we all forget that for about 27 other qbs thats a sack
body slam
lamar just handing out that post game covid
mofo comes off covid 1 practice misses 2 throws and ppl wanted his head most criticized qb pass to pass
lamar can throw but has inconsistency issues due to mechanics

always has been
sightly high slightly outside but thats a catchable ball

hollywood wasnt ready for the ball
these fuckers out the massive jinx on it
marquise brown is a bum not only that he is a below replacementlevel player im tired of apologists on this thread saying its his utilization he cant get separation and he has zero ball skills besides running backwards to avoid contact its time to cut ties no sunk cost fallacy bullshit this has to end
can we appreciate how deeply joe buck wanted to jinx tucker
lamars accuracy is really an issue now
lamar is throwing very poorly this year very concerning
atrocious throwing technique
cant even blame boykin he came to play today he was open
fuck all you haters that say he cant throw
should frame a picture of that brown touchdown and hang it up until next year when he gets his next one
did the nfl remove the rule on wearing alternate jerseys twice a year we already wore ours twice
ravens inactives c trystan coloncastillo dt justin madubuike dt broderick washington concussion cb jimmy smith groin and cb tramon williams thigh jeffzrebiec
i hate fox coverage
the all black unis are so ridiculously hard and every time we wear them im baffled at why we dont wear them more often just a beautiful beautiful kit
we cant have shit
no dez tonight guys covid
welp i was really excited for a dez revenge game

dez announced hes quitting the season man i really hope hes just reacting in the heat of the moment and isnt actually calling it quits
did anyone else think this game was at 5 lol ive been waiting here for 3 hours
damn patrick queen struggling in coverage
fort
wow defense doing it
thank god lj can use tackling fundementals
gotta love these play calls right now
now who tf is lamar gonna throw to
my wish is for no three and outs today fingers crossed
time to show everyone why you won the mvp lamar
dez tweeted hes done with the season hope its just spur of the moment frustration hes worked so hard to come back
sigh i feel so bad for dez
not gonna lie dez being out really damaged my excitement for this game was talking all day about wanting to see him breakout

oh well shake it off lets fucking go lamar
1st down runs still pain
where is jk
holy shit it feels so good to have lamar back
ingram is just so slow since he came back from injury im ready for the jk dobbins train
i am retroactively pissed we traded hurst and added no replacement
please stop forcing ingram into the lineup man
i love ingram but he has no business starting at this point
the soulja with the 1 yac
hollywood running backwards lol thanks champ
why the fuck is ingram still starting
fucking bollywood
fkin hollywood
soulja
im sorry we should never have an empty backfield tbh
i miss snead
of fucking course
hollywood is literally the worst
marquis time for the next man up
alright we have to start holding lamar accountable
season was over the second we had a covid outbreak dont know why yall got so optimistic for some reason
im ready to bench hollywood not even bc that was his fault it wasnt entirely his fault but i feel like we force him the ball wayyy too much
bad things happen when marquise brown is targeted
empty 5 yard pass 3rd down havent seen that before
duvernay and proche at least act like they give a shit when they run routes
this offense genuinely reminds me of 2017 flacco days
he literally ran backwards to avoid contact on the first throw and made no effort on the second hes nate robinson soft
if it was peyton throwing he would point hollywood to the sideline every huddle until he learns he has 2 hands
i dont wanna lose to andy dalton
not fully his fault on that one but honestly dumbfounded i ever thought brown would be a good wr hes like 54 80lbs he sucks
ah well we got one holding call this game cant get greedy
least we held them to 3 stop the stupid pass plays and run the ball till they show they can stop it
im expecting lamar to be a little rusty on the first few drives lets run the damn ball
lol these route trees are trash
whos 33 and why has he been in the practice squad for all but 2 games hes pretty solid
there goes our soldiers
guys have some fucking faith god damn its the 1st qtr plenty of time
well fun first 5 min sub but yall are already too toxic
please for the love of god put jk in this drive
jk should be 1 in depth chart and it aint even close
spotted them 3 well heat up tho
gus bus
i think 95of nfl wide receivers make that catch im saying that literally our wr1 is about the size of a 7th grader and doesnt give the effort to make up for it at all
so dez is quite frustrated with a virus
gus is so much better than ingram at this point
announcers i dont think cowboys can stop the run

roman watch me
dobbins should be the 1 back
yeah keep ingram though greg roman
dobbins gets a big run

greg roman pikachu face
crazy what the run game looks like when literally anyone besides ingram gets the ball
the ravens are their own toughest opponent
that snap was on lamar not mekari
go for it
lamar trying to get some of his 4th down mojo back
i love it
lamar is finally like alright guys stop being pussies on fourth down love that gesture
why are we throwing behind the line to holywood when he likes to avoid contact ya lets force him to run headon into the defense
holy shit lamar welcome back legend
my bb
damn he fooled the fuck out of them
vintage jackson
love that lamar has his confidence back
he still got it
unbelievable he hit top speed soooooo quick
lamaarrrr
lamar is an actual souljia he does his jobs and knows when to shut up and play
lol they had to dump the audio cus lamar was spitting some shit
td thanks to luke wilson
love bozeman calling the td
can we please just run and never throw we have no receivers we can rely on jackson dobbins gus thats it
that was the most predictable play call and it worked lol
we should have a total of 5 passes tonight
that was the fuck covid run
he said fuck greg romans shit playcalling boiii
hollywood honestly doesnt look fast idk what the hype was about
hopefully this drive is all you need to see the difference between lamar and mcsorley its not even a conversation lol
look at bozeman putting up the td signal before lamar even got there
now lets get lamar a true 1 receiver
daddy lamar is the only reason we are competitive
as much as im sick of roman using lamar to run through the middle it was the right call on that play


now lets mix it up so they dont figure roman out like every other team feed dobbins pls
please yall keep talking shit about lamar it feeds him
hey number 8 is pretty good we should play him at quarterback every week
honestly fuck our receivers keep snead and duvernay the rest can go
37 yard td run on 4th 2 not bad for a running back that just recovered from covid
ive noticed its actually usually the same people screaming the end of our season when we do something moderately bad


most of us realize not every play can be perfect
can you all fucking tackle him jesus christ
as soon as one group of our team plays well another part immediately falls apart it never fails lol
welp the short kick off giveth and the short kick taketh away
come on special teams
damn thought tucker had him
i knew this would eventually happen letting teams run on the kickoff
queen was getting held like a mother fucker really opened that run
i thought you couldnt block 2 on 1 during kickoffs
one great thing happens and then something bad happens
so were using this game to scout gallup right
hump is ripping one out at some point in this game
block in the back something
i much rather have the cowboys drive down the field on a special teams mistake than our defense playing poorly
the most surprising is the qb pressure how are the ravens not blowing their line up
we were far too happy after our touchdown were not allowed to do that in 2020
dj fluker now in at rt so looks like phillips and fluker are rotating every two series jeffzrebiec
holy shit he actually fucking caught it
i am genuinely surprised he didnt drop that
this has been the most disheartening season since 2015 our players do not make clutch plays theyre irresponsible with their social media and partying marlon and others and generally just have no heart or strength

honestly so disappointed in harbaugh and eric decosta this isnt ravens football
beep beep motherfuckers
gus is so underrated
if we let gus leave that is a massive issue
did they just call greg roman a architect i must be a rocket scientist then
id like to see greg romans playbook
dude fucking why

pointless
the dumb ass penalties every week are killing me
its all fucking checkdowns
one yard check down on third down this offense is so so broken
oof self destruction that feels like home
announcer jinx
fuck these announcers
3rd and 8 and we go for a check down


tucker missed its like were actively trying to lose this game
bruh
what the fuck
no fucking wag
youve got to be fucking kidding me
what even is this season
its really one thing after another with this team
jfc guys
every facet of this team is broken
what the fuck
the announcer wtf
this is the darkest timeline
were actually a cursed team rn
trash playcalling led to that fuck man
thats it only running the ball and thats it from now on 4th and 10 from the red zone run it
pain
i cant even a game that shouldnt be close we are losing
fucking greg roman man made tucker miss that
this is just comedy at this point
joe shut the fuck uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuupuh
fuck you joe buck
do you asshats want to bitch about tucker now too
this is what they get for trying to shuffle running backs like a deck of cards

can we please revisit that 3rd and 8 play call i mean wtf and why to justice hill

this offense this year is so frustrating
2020 has gone too far now leave tucker alone
can you lamar go up to harbaugh and tell him that we aint winning a sb with this offense a la joe to cam cameron top 10 qb in the league and we regularly have 50 yards passing near the half
at least we got the ball back quick good job b will
hes mah queen jsnow
my queeeen
holy shit myles boykin actually did something this really is 2020
miles fuxkong boykin
deep passes and good stuff happens fuck you roman
anyone else getting emotional whiplash
opposite day guys queen is best coverage
im on a rollercoaster of emotions boys
an open wr well i never
tucker missed field goal and then boykin gets a td wtf is going on
high iq missed field goal by tucker even when he misses he scores
a boykin td batten down the hatches its going to be a blizzard tonight
all the things that can go wrong do and then a rare boykin td gonna be a weird one
now kick the ball out of the endzone
patrick queennnn
miles boykin comeback player of the year



change my mind
8d chess from the ravens to give themselves a 4point boost with the missed field goal
boykin with a hell of an effort on that catch
what a team response for tucker

misses his first fg aiming 5 years fuck 2020
defense picks off next play
jackson td to boykin
which gives the ball to tucker to chip in the xp to rebuild his confidence

at least thats how i imagine it
im learning in real time that dez might quit football after testing positive for covid19

this ravens season is wild
why is lamb always wide open
is it bad that im genuinely higher on boykin going forward than marquise

browns speedy as hell but thats it boykin has every physical tool and the only thing in his way is focusing up and getting help n the same page with lamar that seems way more fixable than browns refusal to do anything physical
what a hit by queen in the hole
i dont think dez will actually quit the season i think it was just a heat of the moment tweet and i dont blame him
ferguson always gets rinsed on play action and reverses its actually so bad
marcus oh my lord
peters giving 8 yards again cmon man youre fast enough to keep up
marcus off peters
ima fucking smack peters why the fuck is he still not playing up
what is with this team man if its not the secondary its another area failing we cant play sound football in all three phases ever
the total lack of pressure is an issue
the secondary is bafflingly bad tonight
our run dline gets so much penetration but when it comes to a pass rush theyre non existent
lmao love gallup just stopping and standing there watching the ball fly outta the stadium
yannick getting dominated just watch him
im just going to go ahead and call a calais pick six in this game right now
hahahaha
we gotta spend a lot more than like 30 of our cap on our offense spend too much on players on defense that barely do anything
joe buck will never compliment a kicker again
who is the dicksmack that signed baker to a multi year commercial deal
damn tonight is not the night for kickers
why was the clock still running after the penalty thought they got rid of that loophole the pats titans exploited it
the ghost of edgar poe in the building or some shit
grittys body was modeled after mike m
a td would be awesome but a fg would be okay too
first dpi of the season lfg
announcers are a joke

it wasnt catchable cus wilson wasnt able to go up and try to catch it lmao
literally tackles the fucking dude and he wants to question it
idk if that ball was catchable yeah no shit he cant catch a ball while being tackled
ravens got a flag it must be christmas
dobbins is faster than all of these other dudes
zero excuse for jk not being the feature back so good
damarquise brown joe buck
fuck this retarded timeshare give dobbins the rock
really ugly calls in the redzone today
every fucking game
another illegal formation foul what
get your fucking feet down man
fucking how does thay keep happening
this is every single game 100 coaching
lots of those penalties this year
so fucking tired of these ol penalties
gr crumbles under pressure he has no composure
illegal formation 400
you kidding me how do we get an illegal formation penalty every fucking game
i know were passing for clock management but hell we got timeouts keep running it

real tired of the formation penalties feels like we get one every game
lmao fucker tried to jinx him again
how the fuck do we have errand snaps and multiple pre snap penalties every game greg needs to be demoted
how are we still lining up illegal in every fucking game
the coaching for this team is clearly fucked what was that penalty
tucker revenge szn 11
yeah brown is starting to really seem pathetic out there
lol zrebiec is fed up on twitter
roman should be fired just from the crazy amount of illegal formation penalties we get its insane
even if the play didnt count how does hollywood not make a better effort to get 2 feet in bounds there

he might actually stink at football
buck and aikman calling the ravens or most any afc team is just garbage they clearly dont know the team
thought that little bitch was gonna return it again
they call holding in your guys games holy shit wow they only ever calm it on us almsot
andy dalton is doing better against our defense then ben roethlisberger and we have more people back lmao
has andy dalton been hit this game
yo if yannik doesnt take over in the second half hes not worth it the cowboys have practice squad tackles on the field
after all thats been invested in this dline how do we still lack a pass rush its really mind boggling
everyone remember you can watch the second half en espaol to counter the joe buck curse voodoo bastard
could troy aikman be more of a cowboy cheerleader than he is right now he sounds like a desperate fan
this field is a fucking slippery mess
wowwwww we got away with one there
they mauled our dlineman

wow we got lucky as hell that the ref didnt catch that
holy shit that was so obvious too what happened with shit like this in the steelers game
lmao cry more troy
the only thing you can hope for is a defensive penalty

did you see what just happened
is this what it feels like to have the refs on your side its a first
cover zero
pretty fun game
i wouldve been pissed if he caught that haha
aj green flashbacks
dalton to green flashbacks
wow lamb shouldve caught that which is wild

special talent
yikes he yucked the fuck outta that ball
i hate playing dalton he either has 4 tds and a game winner against us or throws 4 ints no in between
wink got bailed out by the refs and the cowboys there

that said im not complaining i cant remember the last time this season luck was on our side
it looked like weve never practiced a hail mary before
ravens past few weeks have been testing my mental health lmao everyday its some new crazy shit happening
can we start the next half with a score
defense not looking great so far tbh seems like their wrs are constantly open
lmao greggg williams getting shit on during a ravenscowboys game love to see it
stared the receiver down the entire route
keeps throwing this stupid floaters
love lamar but he usually throws too high
bad pass
and again terrible throw
mandrews seems like a distant memory right now come back soon bby
i hate that sidearm
man lamar would be a top 3 qb in the league if hed improve his throwing
d needs to strap up tired of these easy conversions
its good that we are using dobbins
two throws no jk dobbins winning formula
so are the refs just not going call the hold
pass rush mia against a terrible oline nonetheless
that right tackle just held so bad lmao
obvious hold missed fucking wonderful
our pass rush gets held all the time and never gets the benefit of the flag hard to get pressure when the refs let the o line hold at will and often just straightup tackle our pass rushers
youre probably asking yourself whys a browns fan here

id rather talk with the afc north fam than bend a knee for americas team fuck the cowboys fuck the steelers
block in the back i front of the ref wtfffffff
calais obviously still isnt 100
they actually got a touch of pressure there influenced the pass a miracle
damn daltons yeeting these mfers
weve gotten lucky quite a few times in this game
when tucker misses from close other kickers on the same field get stiff legs just a rule
youre not tucker bitch
not pat i had him do a cameo for my grandmother and he was super sweet
this ingram bullshit has to stop i feel like hes trolling us
ah another ingram wasted down for 15 yards
til afc north starting quarterbacks have the numbers 6 7 8 and 9 pretty neat still fuck porky the pig ben roethlisberger
bro ride dobbins hes gashing them i love ingram but come on now
ingram with 4 ypc every other rb is over 10 get your shit together gro
if this is the best we can do against the cowboys we may as well pack it up and get a better draft pick
dobbins averages more yards per rush than ingram has total yards in a game and you still give it to ingram to waste every other 1st down
greg roman seriously has 3 fuckin plays
roman is a lost cause playing ingram fire that fucker
im so sick of injurys
absolutely horrible play calling

ingram misses the gap to the right of ricard rciard gets injured and we get 1 yard then a qb draw awful
go figure dobbins for 6
because if he tries to slam jackson and misses its a td what does aikman not get
keep feeding dobbins
what more proof do you need roman was the titans last postseason game not enough for you to prove that ingram just isnt the same guy anymore
keep feeding jk you fool
we dont have a receiver in the top 50 for yards wild
i cant wait for this thread to tell me how brown missed that pass
lamar needs to stop holding the ball
ive been a lamar defender all year but this game is troubling its not just the playcalling and receiving hes not passing well
make lj pass all off season
why is justice hill in the ducking game
hey roman


please give the ball to dobbins more


sincerely

fans everywhere
thank god for lamar jackson
its nice that lamar can make those runs but i hate the fact that he has to rely on them
look at that block by dobbins man
thats it lamar fuck yeah
what a fucking play
toe drag swag
nice fucking catch
im not trying to hear shit from you niggas that keep talking down on this kid touucchddoowwnnn hollywooodd
3tds for the boy
holy fuck that was a fucking great throw

and damn good footwork by marquis
that is how you throw the fucking rock lamar good shit lets go
great first down but wow not a single player is open no separation
lol how the fuck does lamar just throw a dime after throwing shit a little more consistency will help my heart out
what a fucking drive from lamar
dobbins dont even gotta touch the ball for the play to go well
holy shit hollywood cooked that guy
everyone here including me was like lamar what the hell with that throw to hollywood and they go and immediately make us eat crow
what boykin and hollywood in same game
soulja boy tell em
that was a perfect pass
also really love hollywood seeing he needs an option and knowing theres nor safety to stop that over the top
theres the speed hollywood made that defender look silly
lamar working on floating the deep balls apparently great throw
that td was clutch we got this as long as we dont let them score an easy td off our fuckups just need the d to stay solid and cover the receivers
thats what happens when you use your souljas
finally a dime pass
thats where its frustrating is we know he can make that throw its getting playcalls to do that and him to consistently make that play
no more visor for lamar
lol zeke
hollywood needs to move both arms to the ball alot happoer with him this second half
aw man now we have to watch the defense again
he just grabbed a defender by the ankles or am i hallucinating tf was thst im confused what i jsut saw
why is the secondary playing so off man they get 7 yds before we touch them
how is it possible to have a wide open reciever on every play yet also get 0 sacks
how is that not grounding
theres that makeup call
intentional grounding i guess isnt a penalty anymore
we finally get pressure he intentionally grounds it and they still dont throw a flag hahahaha these refs
thats grounding but whatever
averette is a cb4 and amari cooper is one of the best route runners in the game shit happens lol dallas has a lot of firepower out there relax
blitzing hump on 3rd down jfc
stop fucking blitzing it isnt working
dalton hocks up a duck to nobody within the tackle box and gets no flag wtf
lmao the refs are fucking atrocious this game
wasnt board the one crying about playing time he has been god awful today
can we get like 1 sack pls
and in the 4th quarter when baltimore needed them most the defense vanished
two possession lead heading into the 4th with the defense reelingwhere have i seen this before
i wonder what wed get in a trade for ngakoue i was super hyped for the trade to get him but now i wish we looked elsewhere
remember when we had that 13 or so sack game a few years ago sigh
wait we get sacks now
huge sack timing makes the fg much more difficult
jihad ward for the first sack of the game just like we all guessed
allah akbar
right when this thread is complaining about lack of sacks the ravens get one moral of the story lets keep doing it
ahahahahahhahahhaahhahahahahahhaha
holy shit legatron
holy shit lmaooooooooo
zuerlein fucking sucks
you may beat our first 64 blitz attempts but well be dammed if you beat our 65th
yo ricard is 310 lbs and runs like that jesus get out of the way
lbtededtminotaur pat ricard
plz lamar dont look for contact u mean too much to the team
how about that jinx aikman look who suffered in the end fuck troy aikman
gus edwards got a madden stat line
lets go lets fucking go lamar
old man ingram

now this is the elusive lamar were used to after some ground and pound
this rushing attack finally looks like last year
backtoback good ingram runs
what happened to the first down and los visuals
were still not really giving lamar much chance here with the play calling
eh i aint worried about lamar the dude hasnt practiced in weeks if hes missing throws like this next week then ill be concerned
lol rollout to left for 57 hollywood with 3 dbs on him wtf are you thinking roman
hes in between now sailed a couple and is pulling back and driving them into the dirt

a full week of practise should help dial that in i think
gonna have to clean up his mechanics cle
i love the sky cam on the kick offs
can we get those vaccines in before the offseason

gotta get working on the throwing mechanics without the bullshit looming
obviously us winning is most important but i need 5 points total between lamar dobbins and hump to when my matchup
he was short right
they are just attacking anthony averette
averett is a liability in coverage hes getting worked
why cant our defense play well when the offense is clicking and vice versa
that clearly wasnt no fucking first
averrett has got wrecked all game what happened to tramon
how is bowser so much ahead of everyone on the d thats 3 times he knew and timed the snap count
are these refs looking through a fucking kaleidoscope
these refs are drunk tonight
wait why is that not a turnover
bro fort had that
throw the flag
fucking garbage
these refs are so fucking bad it isnt funny
that was a pick
thats a pick

hello
that was a pick
zeke more like weak
someone give lj fort a game ball please
peters got bitched
peters got juked out of his fucking jockstrap
lj fort is a beast
peters getting toasted a ton this year
i guess our opponents just can hold all day fucking pathetic
peters is so hot and cold man
peters gets turned around so much
secondary is at its best when we dont need peters to cover a wr1 or wr2 and instead have him do his thing
how is amari cooper only 26 i swear hes been playing for like a decade
as soon as they showed pass on 3rd down i knew we were fucked
i should have never bragged before the year our secondary is our strength oops
were just good enough to best dallas but lets be real were average at best right now
juiceman giveth and taketh away
come on harbs why not challenge that
hes clearly down lol
cowboys on drugs lol
what was that even controversial
these refs have been awful for both sides
run these fucks over
mans was down for like five seconds dallas is so blind lmao
hopefully shit baker comes back to play next week
run with gus ffs
just give the ball to the runningbacks
everytime edwards touches the ball he gets 610 yards minimum but we still putting in ingram for some reason
i love u gus
ez money
easy money
gonna be fun to hear skip bayless whine about this tomorrow
officiating has been absolutely abysmal beyond belief cowboys probably deserve 3 off of the missed pi to end the half though he very well may have missed it and certainly didnt deserve that td on the last drive
jk dobbins
good fuck the cowboys
i just saw danny devito in that weird white wig from always sunny in the crowd
you guys feeling better about our chances against cleveland
its gonna be a long flight back to texas
dgaf the cowboys aikman most of america doesnt care either
easy money
jk all day
they did them so dirty playing tuesdays gone after that
yannick wtf was that shit
lmao mccarthy and harbs repeatedly accidentally walking in the same direction
ngl that td pass was a bad throw glad boykin secured it
nfl better hope this is an amazing game because the amount of shit thats about to come down the pipeline for still playing this game with the dez positive test is going to be crazy pr nightmare if ive ever seen one
as someone who is a neural viewer of this game has lamar been getting cucked like this all year by drops and stuff
running ingram on first down for 2 yards max and then throwing some short ass pass 2nd down every single drive gonna do that time and time again
marlon got dpi and gave up a touchdown
fuck the pi they held and then blocked in the back man how are the refs even worse with no crowd
whats up with the special teams play this year harbaugh must be livid
fck joe buck
i just knew that was going to happen felt it even
erin andrews still a dime damn
lamar is 78 right now

the one incompletion is the tipped interception
i wonder why yannick has been absolutely silent since he came to baltimore im certainly not giving up on him but what gives
buck sucks buck sucks buck sucks
run lamar jesus you had a whole field we are we trying to contain him
lamar has literally just recovered from covid and hadnt practiced in weeks fuck all you saying he cant throw
theres one of those wasted timeouts due to slow substitutions we see once every single game for the past 10 years
this team and lamar are playing with a new fire a new hope something is clicking now i hope im right and this doesnt blow up in my face but i feel our season is about to change for the better
why does this defense always get such bad ball spots
idc that was a great goaline series by the defense 5 straight stops
this is the softest fucking secondary ive ever seen out of baltimore what happened
petition to cut hollywood and pay lamar every penny sign here
that was literally gallups first td since week 3 lmao what a joke
just thought of this can u imagine brown even trying to catch a hail marry in between all the defenders lol
is lamars arm fixable it wasnt this bad last year how has he regressed so much
i see a lot of toxicity in this thread i know im a browns fan but i think yall should give lamar some time to me hes still a
that throw was shit nobody defend it
why the fuck is roman calling pass plays hes legit a dumbass right i mean what kind of idiot stop doing what is currently winning the game fuck you roman you pos
marquise has lost hollywood any more mistakes and hes just marq
okay now that were down 3 no more of this running the ball business greg roman
things wouldnt be going well if dak was playing
matt judon just posted a video of him at a gun range what the actual fuck if hes on the covid list shouldnt he be home
satan really picked the ravens since january to brutally ass rape but not any other fucking team joke
i dont even need to refresh rravens thinks its just hollywoods fault and lamar didnt just airmail an easy ass pass
andy dalton led cowboys with worst defense in the nfl are currently shredding us yep
fuck every commentator
reminder tucker wouldnt be in that position if greg roman called a semi competent play on 3rd down
boykin tries his best to fuck that up lmaooo
justin tucker always says that mt is the toughest field goal kicking stadium in the league and i am starting to believe him
runs straight out of bound instead of getting a few more
probably going to draft a safety in one of the 1st 3 rounds come april
lamars mechanics are shot
shit right there is why hollywood is so frustrating he can do stuff like that while doing nothing for quarters beforehand he has the talent to be great
good thing about lamar is that even when the passing isnt happening he can run

and then would you look at that the passing is happening
ok guys i need to sleep for work gl
wtf was that tackling chuck
i like that weve started using that jet sweep motion shows some innovation and teams like the rams have some pretty successful plays with that motion
another shitty throw to boykin
hey ngakoue finally almost made a play when he was unblocked with a minute and a half left in the game
had the ravens just managed to win one of the coin flip games both steelers games titans pats this season would look so different
if we dont get dez some red zone looks bruh
so excited love watching this team play
please lets not underestimate the nfc east team

but we got this bb
cant wait for the shit show hopefully the 3 straight losses motivate this team to stop sucking
as a ravens fan living on the west coast im loving these national games plus with lockdown todays the perfect evening for some football
lets go ravens we need some ws today lets get it

ravens 37 cowboys 14
930am here and i got the day off cant wait to see the squad back in action
based on warmups the ravens offensive line looks like this

lt orlando brown
lg bradley bozeman
c patrick mekari
rg ben powers
rt tyre phillips

by my count this would be the seventh different starting offensive line combination this season for the ravens jamisonhensley
dez aint quitting dude has always been super emotional he really wanted to play badly id be bummed to
nfl really fuckin us over man
2020 everybody what a fuckin year its been
dez just tweeted hes done for the season this cant be true
this doesnt make any sense
cowboys fan here i feel so bad for dez hes been shafted so many times should have been in league last few years and i know how much he wanted to ball out against the boys brutal i hope someone close with him takes his phone so he doesnt have anymore rage tweets
troy and buck luck so punchable
we got calais and bwill
stunt on these hoes
we need to defer were 60 when deferring
comcast is required by law to black out the programming currently airing on this station

uhhhh ok
the dez shit just completely took the wind out of me
i swear to god if we have another outbreak and miss the fucking playoffs because of it
get them off the field defense lol
they fuckin micd up the one dude whos gonna grunt the entire game
lj
cool guys dont look at tossed zekes
ik the game just started but the defense looks like theyre missing tackles early
im expecting dalton to throw to aj green
score on the opening drive with a relentless ground and pound set the tone early
a broncos fan here to root for you guys against the cowboys best of luck and zeke cant get 14 points in fansty or there kicker can you please help me with that and thank you
of course we have to get some fox bullshit mixed in here
ok i get it ingram is the starter but where my boy jk
why in gods name is ingram still starting
lamar got the good legs
does ingram have romans nudes
if roman finds a way to not feed jk the ball in this game i will riot
these play calls are dead
it marquise goes backwards one more time
hollywood ran the wrong way
did he really run backwards
run the other way souljia you fucking moron
ok idc if we win or lose use the fucking younger guys that have looked better i dont get why they keep forcing shit and expecting it to work
why are you running backwards lmao
lmao great
goddamn it marquise
marquise was so turned around for that catch the i thought it was an interception for a second
nice tip soulja
i cant even watch were so fucking bad
fucking worthless receivers typical
bench hollywood
fuck i just want this season to end
marquise needs to start putting in more effort man oh man
i dont understand why he even threw that to hollywood no chance of a first down
brown is ass
im tired of how we use marquise
greg roman you have jk dobbins weekly reminder dont be a idiot sandwich you donut
get that useless fucking piece of shit out of the game what a fucking bust receiver
whos drinking tonight
cut brown dude im over his shit
this team still just doesnt have it cant click just not there people surely can open their eyes now
i feel like that ball was extremely catchable
and now his mindset is gonna be fucked
thats why hollywood cant be any kind of possession or lead receiver the slightest bit of contact in no way a penalty of any kind and he doesnt even try to make the catch the ball was there for him and he didnt even put 2 hands up that was some perriman bullshit
practice squad guys playing better than the starters
this fucking bum is our first round draft pick
hollywood dude cmon
whenever i participate in the game thread during the game we end up sucking so ill see you guys later lol
ive seen brown have the ball hit his hands and not catch it more than ive seen him catch it
lol cant fucking wait until we fire roman
first possession and any onlooker would think we are already down by two scores
its not his fault that he is short not strong not that quick to get separation
why are we still starting ingrim i really dont understand what they are seeing that im not
i am honestly shocked that we had such a good offense last year is it really all the oline most of the offense is the same except for the oline but we just look so awful this year
so much for the cowboys having a bad offensive line lol the ravens are getting nowhere near dalton
this is germane but did anyone notice the redhead erasure on daltons headshot graphic on fox
they have one of the worst lines yet i dont think we even have a pressure
even with a prime time home game all the announcers can talk about is the shitty ass cowboys
i blame greg roman more than any individual offensive player with his old stale scheme
time to go take the lead and never look back leggo boys
can we please use dobbins hes our best rb
marquise is a huge bust and no one will realize it but the fans the team will just cover up his flaws and say we see no problem because of his stats but in reality my guy is a bum and aj brown metcalf or samuel would of been hella better picks
donald trumps hands are bigger than hollywoods hands
how did ingram drop off so much in a year 1200 yards to this
got the pick out the way lets get it together
maybe use our best running back this drive idk
why tf are we not giving dobbins the ball
wheres dobbins
its almost as if gus is better than ingram
we are like the inversesteelers instead of playing down to inferior competition our weak opponents play up against us
we need a true 1 wr desperately
keep dobbins in
jk looks to be 100
jesus christ dobbins is so good
i thought we benched skura
dobbins is literally 3x better than ingram yet that was his first snap
lol cant even snap
would you look at that dobbins is good use him greg
thats the last well see of dobbins tonight lol
thats the drive
the ghost of skura
even when hollywood doesnt fuck up he still pisses me off
this is why u hand the ball off to dobbins
why did we trade hurst
soulja sighting
let dobbins cook
maybe we could try sending our fastest wr more than 2 yards down field
the kid gets picked up and thrown like a middle schooler with one arm from a struggling linebacker smh
truss
theres the mvp
lamarrrrrrr
just run the entire game no need to throw
look greg even fox has a dobbins graphic
i need some passing tds though for real
oh

lort
lamaaaaaaaaa
let this be the rebirth of the ravens 2020 season
yes that is what i like to see
lets fucking go
lets fucking gooooo
the mvp is fucking back
think hes covid free
greg roman time to pass 80 times ingram is staying in dobbins youre benched
we 2019 ravens boi
lets fuckin gooooo

thats the llama i know telling the special team to stay on the sideline and let him go for it and then score lets go baby
did they show dez with no mask playing with his phone after testing positive for covid
mmmmm fuck yeah i would die for lamar
the red sea just fucking parted
thats my llama
cowboys practicing physical distancing
are we navy now
thats my mvp
heeeeeeeesssss baaaaaaaaack
lol 77 pulling the steph curry and celebrating because he knows lamar gone aka klay has an open 3
wheres the guy who says danny dimes is faster than lamar when lamar hits the gas it is over
lol
god damn our tackling has been really bad for weeks now seeping into special teams now too
i am once against asking to be drunk
this is why we cant have nice things
tucker just saved us from a td return
cmon son
wide open defense playin gross rn
can we uhhhhh make a tackle
whats with the short kicks
one of our players gus was held on that huge return

refs didnt call it interesting
fyi the cowboys are playing ps ol and we cant get to dalton
weve gifted them everything so far im not worried but they gotta clean up the poop
nothing is easy with this team damn
wow and they just talked up marlo
how the fuck we cant get no pressure on this ginger
everything troy aikmen says the opposite happens
cant even stop them even while holding them so the d will be horrible this game jfc can we have some consistency
such an obvious hold on 49 on the kickoff need to bounce back this drive
everytime theres a flag im like whatd we do now smh
i think yannick is cursed vikings are dogshit with him and then great without him we are good without him and then shit with him

no excuses marlo got worked on that
lmao this defense getting worked by a bunch of scrubs
i guess if its gonna be called dpi then at least save the td still love you marlo
you cant really blame the defense when you keep putting them in tough spots
im so tired of 12 yards on every first down play
keep running the goddamn ball
gus bussssss
it may be a home game but the team still chartered the gus bus
gus busssss
thank god were finally just running and minimal passing
its time to bench ingram and feed gus and jk
im sorry i love mark but unless the other two need a breather i dont want him running anymore
poweri hb dive call it 3040 times
pretty simple we run until they stop us
keep dobbins in
joe buck saying what were all thinking about dobbins over ingram
omg take ingram out hes washed
glad that hollywood is getting involved at least
i hope ingram wants to coach with us hes obviously losing his spot but i love that man
good job by ricard to avoid block in the back
thats it roman abandon the run
1 bad play call from roman prevents a potential td drive
the check down was his first read lol
we should try throwing past the first down line
why are we coming out of the huddle with 10 seconds on the play clock speed the fuck up
jinx
yeah knew that would happen
this game is cursed
omg false start on a field goal we suck end the season thisnsub

i jinxed it sorry
lol
literally nothing can go right for us
we must be in a parallel universe
ok for real that should be a bad omen if there was one
cursed season
these are actually the worst announcers holy fuck dogshit analysis over and over
pain
this simply isnt our season
jinx fucker announcers
im going to chug the tequila idgaf whats happening
its the madden curse
fucking joe buck keep your whore mouth shut until after it goes through
fuck buck
special teams kicking offense and defense are all shitting the bed today
well fuck even the goat messed up
lets jinx the kicker for about 8 minutes straight
lmao people who believe in jinxes
fucking announcers always just keep your mouth shut about kickers fucking aye
my head is going to explode from frustration seriously
defense please go off
lol this feels like a game we feel like we are winning but lose because of these moments good teams dont make these mistakes we are average
announcers jinxing the goat get fucked buck
hahah we even get announcer jinxed this shit is too funny d

x200b

also another penalty this team is so organized and well coached
the washington teams dethroned the steelers and justin tucker misses a field goal kick

2021 cant come soon enough also i would like to go back my own reality this alternate universe sucks
joe buck showers with his socks on
yo people are making posts out of comments haha
i wonder if the guy controlling the crowd noise at the stadium tonight has our bullshit chant from years back on his soundboard
we just iced our own kicker huh
he never misses he has made so many in a row he is perfect obviously the announcers have nothing to do with the kick but its so annoying how often they seem like theyre deliberately leaning into the announcers jinx thing
this commentary team needs to shut the fuck up
yea im going to go ahead and call it a quit for the rest of the season i cant deal with this
patrick queennnnnnn
muh queen
queen
yaaaaaaaas queen
so happy to have b wil back dude is a massive presence
holy shit boykin was naked
killer queen has already touched the football
there you go boykin
boykin sighting omg
aight lets get it baby
what is this game lol
this first half has been a fucking roller coaster
td lets fucking go boys
well that was quick
well that was fucking easy
thats my boykin
pqueen is a better ball catcher than most of our ball catchers
ok ill take a doover lol
thats how you bounce back with a boink
boykin
wtf boykin did something
boykin is involved holy shit the cowboys are fucked now eat shit troy and bucky boy
nice catch by queen and then a nice catch by boykin both great catches honestly lamar really floated that ball almost left that play on the field boykin did a great job on that play
justin tucker playing 4d chess out there miss the field goal to set up the touchdown
wait boykin is our wr1

always has been
tucker was planning for the long term with that miss
lets go boykin
boykin is our best receiver rn
what a fucking catch
what a catch by queen using the pinky to keep it from the ground
so happy for boykin
yall see how boykin didnt celebrate with brown
cant believe a ravens receiver was that open
boykin did something
such a rare sight to see our wrs catch the ball and get some yac
where the boykin haters at
dez definitely stole boykins jersey
my stream is super behind but let it be known that i always believed in 80
and queen just gets caught off in coverage needs to fix that up still
you know im convinced that ball to boykin would have been dez if he was playing and that makes me kinda sad for dez
that reverse is on jaylon ferguson
queen my dude you gotta learn to cover those intermediate zones its an mlbs bread and butter
queen out of position
this line is stuffing zeke impressive stuff
i smell a zeke fumble very soon
come on d
take in the cowboys had 12 days to prepare for us
uhhhhh pass d you gonna show up
peters god damn
secondary cmon man
wolfe is such an underrated run stuffer
weird peters doing jack shit against a scrub wideout on third down
wolfe is lowkey one of the best fa decisions we made
dline needs to step up if they can get past the backups in for dallas oline pass d isnt an issue
wolfe has come to life these last 4 or so games feel like he wasnt doing much before
middle of the field been open all day
this defense is a shadow of its former self damn
may i please get a crumb of pass rush
derek wolfe is putting up a good season quietly he was great last week as well
absolutely have no answer for the passing game
peters is so confusing he recognizes plays before the ball is snapped but still gets burned on every route
lets make it 2813 after the first drive of the 3rd
lol
yo refs i know its hard to do an easy job but he went out of bounds the clock should stop
alright boys we need a methodical drive downfield now and we get the ball at half
you miss a field goal and you miss a field goal everybodys missing field goals
wind must be ripping across the 10 yard line typical mt bank crosswind that doesnt show on the post
so dis the rules for the clock running change he ran out of bounds then they had a penalty and the clock never stopped
wwe
fuck off fox commentators
i would argue that that ball wasnt catchable

shut the fuck up uncatchable pis are obviously a thing this year
the most obvious pass interference ever
jesus christ aikman it went over his head because he was hauled down while jumping for it
thats the first pi called for the ravens all year
like i said last time he played this nigga jk dobbins is different
definitely an uncatchable ball but officials never ever call that anymore
holy shit its like dallas doesnt have a run defense
greg roman is going to use that play as an excuse to not use dobbins next half
dobbins is the future
after long run start dobbins
very next play bench dobbins
soulja
is it just me or do these pitches to the rb on the outside never work
do troy and buck know that theres another team not named the dallas cowboys playing tonight
i want us to call some of those power runs we did with rg3 and trace last week where we pull the whole line almost i havent seen us do that with lamar
so has brown regressed i feel like he would have had that toedrag last year but not this year
we gotta fix these illegal formations
is that decosta on the sideline
even my stupid ass could see that was illegal formation like clockwork
every single mother fucking game
oh my god buck can you please stop talking about it now
holy shit that is so sloppy and unforgivable too many illegal formations week in and week out
how have we not fixed these presnap penalties
how do we have that same penalty every game
how many formation fouls are we going to get this year we get 1 or 2 a game its so dumb
im gonna pluck my pubes if i hear another illegal formation penalty this year
cumberland blues outro
lol grateful dead before every commercial
how is there another illegal formation penalty how
dude at this point i dont blame the players greg fix this scheme so we have less illegal formations whatever youre doing now is not working for the guys ffs
isnt it actually better that tucker missed the kick the interception and td wouldnt have happened if he didnt miss
fucker cant jinx tucker again
well if there was a time to get the weekly illegal formation might as well get it here where we were just gonna get 3 anyway instead of negating a big play
i cant stand the illegal formation penalties this has to be on roman how do you call a play thats illegal before its even snapped
hollywood lost his speed from muscle gainz i rather have him be fragile and be fast
cant have a ravens game without illegal formation
baffling how undisciplined and error prone the team is this year so many unforced errors
our offense could be the same juggernaut as last year and i would still be cool with firing gro just for the illegal formations
greg roman got a 0 on the wonderlic score
they called that a first down
play tight for 20 more seconds
our pass rush cant get past a practice squad line btw
0 pressure and sitting in soft man zone thats the only way dallas is gonna gain yards so why are we playing like that
please dont let them score
come on wink
cant generate an ouce of pass rush man smh
pick 6 incoming
andy dalton standing in the pocket with hours of time every snap rush is so bad
how is andy dalton driving down the field at will
i just realized this is a buckeye back battle
thats a great openfield tackle by averett
i didnt know averrett was back hes not great but once you get beyond him our cb depth is not so good
averett nice tackle too many people let cooper go in a situation like that
sweet baby jehoshaphat can you fucking sack the ginger please


dont just feel up his linemen i know theyre beefy but good damn sack his ass
for such an amazing defensive lineup they just cant get stops when it matters
has campbell or williams played a single snap yet this game
have we touched dalton at least once this game why are we not getting to the qb
watch them get first down anyway
really questionable series from wink
am i the only one that thinks humphrey couldve picked that
lol we def just got away with one
seeing dalton get clocked felt good
hey the officials helped us for once still fuck aikman though
thats a blown call ngl
us benefitting from bad officiating against the cowboys thats absolutely wild
aikman should never call a cowboys game ever again its like listening to bill simmons talk about the celtics
so this is how the steelers feel
whoa that was a terrible call

oh well
we got bailed out by the refs right there
refs might be wearing their masks over their face
not a bad dpi there given the play take the yards not the td but still a bad miss by the refs
this is galaxy brain shit from mccarthy
if tuck gets a shot at a 60 yarder i guarantee he makes it to make up for the miss earlier
honestly that was a spectacular throw by dalton we lucked out that lamb couldnt haul it in
why the fuck do you not rush anyone
after that first half i can say this game is certainly being played like its a tuesday
glad we didnt have gregg williams
i assumed that was going to be deflected to aj green even though aj green does not play for the cowboys
wow our d attempt at this hail mary was pathetic
terrible end of half defense ngl bad hold that shouldve been a flag and then almost gave up the hail mary
float like a butterfly catch like a lamb
wow ive never seen a commercial shot exclusively with a samsung galaxy justin very cool
we have a lot of issues that need to be addressed this offseason hard to try and put together an order
iol
wr
edgepass rush
te depth
corner slot depth tavon is just too injury prone
kind of worried that the covid outbreaks plus injury bug will allow this organization to think weve just had bad luck this season granted weve had horrible luck but theres also a lot that were not doing well
lamar really needs to stop sailing these passes
is being a ravens fan enough to get a medical marijuana card asking for a friend
won a game of online chess during halftime gotta love it
classic

either a terrible play call receiver dropno effort or lamar overthrow

all year
lamar is making a habit of switching his throw angle when he doesnt even need to qb coach should be all over that but nah
its looks like roman airmailed another one
holding wtf
our defense is making andy dalton look like 2019 lamar
holy shit was that not a hold
dalton has all day unbelievable
defense is playing with bo fucking heart man wtf also refs are blind not see 2 holds on that dalton pass
calais is extremely rusty i think hell be fine next week
i wish i could suck at my job and still get a fat paycheck
wink with the 1 handed catch
hook it again
miss
theres only one zeke in this townand his last name is cohen
so can this team just not play defense until the opponent is in field goal range
we could run the ball here to close out the game but i sense more side arm shenanigans from roman and lamar
ok here we go lets put this away
refs are terrible
i love how there are giants and wft fans joining in the game thread this week
noooooooooooooooooooooooo ricard
why cant ingrahm get 2 yards per rush different plays hes in on or just not able to find holes
2 yard ingram
im really disappointed that harbaugh doesnt tell roman to put dobbins in jfc
ingram you either give the ball to dobbins or gus get the goddam memo greg
its mind blowing that gus and dobbins only have 9 carries combined they are clearly our 2 best runningbacks our passing game sucks and the cowboys run defense sucks give them the ball and we win easily
i dont know how dobbins doesnt get at bare minimum 15 touches a game i just dont understand
roman with the 1000 iq move to not play our backs that are averaging 10 yards per carry cowboys will never expect it
why in the hell are we not playactioning

and when we do why does it always look like the exact same play

we are gashing them on the ground g ro
harbaughs pose is a mood
dobbins is just so much more explosive than ingram
some absolute trash throws by lamar
awful throws all night
this is embarrassing
why is he in on every third down
i wish lamars passes were as good as his legs
jackson like disgusted he had to run there lol or that he didnt pick up more yards
td hollywood
getting 13 yards there is something no other qb could do
hell yeah brown
fast boi
we need a young oc that will help lamar succeed not being senile fails to make adjustments
soulja boi
soulja
okay that td to hollywood was hella impressive
hollywood is now a pfc no longer a private
great block by dobbins there
today he is a legit soulja what a throw
what a fucking pass
thats exactly the sort of thing that brown is supposed to be doing
soulja
redemption arc
this has been your onceagame cool marquise highlight
how he hits those and misses dudes 5 yards out
lj dimes
dime
yo hollywood you made a legit play there
thats a good throw
anyone get flashbacks to that arizona game last year same thing dropped the mother fucker right where it needed to be
feed hollywood my god
awesome throw awesome catch love to see it
rip that cornerback holy shit he did everything he could
jerry diet coke jones in shambles
are the browns going to nuke us with this defense
how was that not grounding bs refs
oculus commercial honestly just had disclaimers say

not actual gameplay do not attempt and then the commercial shows the girl letting go of a building falling

x200b

next the disclaimer says do not play near obstacles or pets and it literally shows her playing by a couch coffee table mirror and doglmao
how that not grounding tho
ill let that missed intentional ground call slide after the missed dpi on us in the first half
i dont think anyone saw how big wolfe would be for us
make up call for the dpi non call in first half
lol this defense fucking sucks
oh look we didnt tackle again on 3rd down
maybe we leave our best corner in coverage
lmao a check down goes for a first on third and 8 because of a missed tackle my god this defense stinks
we need to stop blitzing and force dalton to beat our coverage
no excuse for that conversion
good shit lj
i feel bad for dez but someone take this dudes phone
blitzing humphrey on 3rd is fucking stupid stop doing it
dez is hilarious right now on twitter hes had to much wine
defense has been ass tonight straight up
fort jumps it sooner thats a pick
ezekiel elliot is averaging 52 yards a carry and theyre still having dalton throw is 30 times
heard mcphee call out that chris board went the wrong way on that 3rd down conv
tbf cowboys are loaded on offense if prescott was out there it probably be tied
some of these calls feels like wink is high on his own press clippings

its 3rd and 7 you dont always need an exotic blitz man up humphrey and peters and let them play playing 7 yards off and sending the house is not working
fort actually wraps up when tackles and i love it
14
14 lmao fucking wow
oh

lort
another missed field goal are there air spirits tending the goal posts or something what is going on out there tonight
ricard is daddy af
when tucker fails everyone fails
imagine not having justin tucker
yasss ricard is back
i love pat ricard dudes great
we used to dump off play action to rickard every game last year nice to see that back
man i really feel for zuerlein they really gotta stop trying with him
project pat yeeted that db
i love ingram but this should be his last game unless someone gets hurt
love seeing lamar come hype up whoever after a big play such a great leader
this is the kind of offensive play calling i like to see
id feel so bad for zurlein if he did this against a different team but since its my team im overjoyed
lamar please slide
i honestly love how the opposing d aint even mad when lamar scrambles on them they pat him on the helmet every time
lamars playing his game right now i love it
those look like 2019 rushing numbers love to see it
ingram with big boy carries now
good couple runs by ingram
ingram looks good on this drive
is mark andrews still out havent been able to keep track of the situation due to finals
come on jk td
where are the visuals
i want to see more of that right there from lamar minus the incompletion obviously lol but his athleticism could make him a russel wilson level magician in the pocket
lamar been balling today hope we see this lamar all season
man a better throw wouldve been a td its okay though hay is basically already in the barn at this point
i like that lamar is giving boykin a some looks at least we need him to show up for us
wonder if aikman ever got over that nocall dpi before the half
that play was only made possible because of lamar 1 day of practice and dude is balling making the throws he needs and has extended drives when needed
we still trying to trade for gallup very down
why we no sack bad qb
averret sucks
and bowser is still mastering the snap count
bad spot
what a spot
how the absolute hell was that a first
averett getting lit up like a christmas tree
our dbs are good at tackling today too bad not a single play on the ball
bruh averett is getting cooked as per usual
humphrey plz
regardless of the awful spot there was no reason dalton should have gotten a throw off with the entire line swarmed around
look at like fort most players would let that go he goes full speed deserves a big payday
that is not pi
bro thats just fucking perfect coverage
that was an int too
he caught that in bounds
that was an interception are these the same refs as our game tf
ticky tack penalty
fuckint refs are beyond incompetent
zeke aint gettin shit
this goal line stand must be huge for morale
nice having williams back
oh fuck off all that hard work and you just leave cooper wide open
sweet coverage peters
fucking refs man
peters is so frustrating
great pass and catch and blown coverage our d line has me hype as hell for that almost goal line stand though
peters is so confusing
refs gifted that wtf
run the clock down
phish freeeee played for the commercial transition
this cowboy team sure is stupid
sticky hands porche
just pound out some runs here
that was a very bad play
jesus fucking christ roman is gonna get lamar fucking killed
lord these refs are clowns i cant believe this man stared an interception down from 3 meters away and couldnt call it
really wish wed stop running with lamar when theres 4 mins left and up 10 bless the knees
give the football a bus pass
run it with ingram on third down he got it but man greg roman is stupid
gus daddddddy affffffff
gus is pulling madden averages
cowboys got thrown under the bus
edwards is a monster stays in bounds on a 24 yard carry when were trying to close out this game amazing
ingrahm look at those yards i got

gus lmao no
running w lamar is just idiotic right now just give it to gus or jk jesus
gus edwards with the downfield running
gus 1
dobbins 2
ingram 3
imagine having your qb run right now
its a nice win but this cowboys defense good god they really suck its embarrassing for them
999 chance of victory

gg no re
290 rushing is madden level shit
dobbins td
let them have fun yall
easy money
troy aikman didnt like that
i think jk has made more than enough of a case to be the starter from here on out
hay is in the barn
eat dobbins eat
ingram really clicked with that kid
troy is depressed lmao
honestly if we dont use ingram we could out run the browns
easy money
this was a great gameplan for playing the cowboys i hope we realize it probably isnt a good one for most of the other games
somber bench cowboys
im just happy we crushed andy dalton
just straight up abusing averett with these curls
aight boys onto the cleveland clowns
are you fuckin kidding me
lol at ward flopping on the field for the to
how many masks is lamar going to put on lol
dalton 4th and long except this time its meaningless
the bois are back in town
i remember a couple years in the mid 2010s where the nfc was tough but mostly the afc is where the big boys play football my pack might not beat any of those good teams coming out of the afc and we have a lot of work to do to get there
can we play the cowboys every week
were down by a field goal youd think we just gave up 3 touchdowns in a row unanswered based on these comments jfc
whats with all the sudden hate for lamar not antagonizing im genuinely curious
yannick aint getting paid based on this game
wolfe gives it everything hes got cant say the same about some of our players on d
this is an abysmal performance from the secondary extremely disappointing
man rams and chiefs fans really tried warning us about marcus peters
really the best run team in the nfl and john harbaugh is among the best in the league

troy aikman on the ravens tuesday night football
if we make the playoffs our team will have vaccinated themselves while other teams are catching it we willbe fullyhealthy
i know that if i were in dezs shoes id be fuming and probably not be thinking straight i bet he calms down and uses this as further motivation to come back strong
that was an awful throw
wr 15 strikes again
that was both on lamar and hollywood that play had no chance and who tips the ball like that
this is a pattern now whenever we force the ball to hollywood bad things happen
no lamar slander ever none he is not the problem
justice hill on third down is probably the lowest iq play i could imagine
fuck you aikman fuck you
this team is so sad right now you immediately check down to nothing on 3rd and long then false start in a dead quiet stadium then miss a gimme fg

zero focus
fuck joe buck
marquise hollywood fouryard pickup twohand touch brown
we deserve one of those calls after all the bullshit weve gotten thrown at us
am i the only sports fan that thinks talking about announcer jinxes is fucking stupid
ive always found erin andrews sexy
crazy thing is lamar has an offseason trainer like what the fuck was he doing
theyre making fun of calais but at least he made it through our dlines pressure is non existent too often
lamar just silenced everyone in here shhhhhhhhh shhhhhhhhh
if lamar can ever make those passes consistently its seriously our league for at least 3 years if we continue to build around him
thats on lamar shits gotta get fixed still taking the 3
i just cant with greg fucking roman mans a run game genius but he is utter garbage with his passing plays fffs
lamar put the mask over his nose
a win is a win but i was definitely hoping tonights was of the this team appears to be back on track and theres confidence going forward variety and not we were lucky to have played such a shitty team who tried their best to give the game away and still put up a fight
if the nfl takes covid seriously they have to cancel the game if the game gets played it means the nfl cares nothing about player safety
scoring 17 against one of the worst defenses in nfl history is just not going to work this team is round one cooked thats assuming we make the playoffs
awful throw again
i mean that play was all lamar lmao put it right in the bread basket and he still almost dropped it
lamar should have had that but that was an inexcusably bad playcall you line up everybody left and leave lamar with one route to hollywood on a rollout right like how does greg roman draw that play up and think its a good idea
guys we need to keep in mind lamar is coming back from covid we have no idea how its still affecting his body
bruh chill we the ravens man we aint even playing bad we got spoiled last year now lets not act like spoiled brats
yall need to chill its the first quarter shake some rust off and lets see how we are by halftime
how can we rationalize playing this game when someone who was just on the field with all of them tested positivejust sayin this is sketchy
are we about to make elliot look good again fuck me
shit throw shit call and shit effort on catch
thats a bad pass and bad route
why the hell didnt we tak dk metcalf or aj brown
look at these concepts they run gallup from the inside and break off on a corners route while the rest all run opposite to spread the d

i just do not get why we cant look at other concepts from other teams and use them lmao we barely even let lamar take a snap from center its so infuriating

this is the type of shit that causes player to stagnate in development i want to get rid of our first if we dont have a high pick and trade for a good wr at least improve in one fucking area since our dl is constantly decimated
yall keep talking shit about lamar lol
feels like were trying to keep this a gamecome on guys tighten up
did anyone expect a rusty team with no practice to be spot on we just have to escape with a win the gloom and doom here is fucking cleveland status and i wont accept it
our defense isnt bad but they arent as good as advertised if youve watched the games all year its obvious they can be picked apart
how is that not a hold pushing our player down
yall cant really blame the defense here the drive started on our 30
were down to the fucking andy dalton led cowboys lmao
i will remind you again that this exact same thing happened vs the patriots

there is too much resources and effort dumped into this defense for them to give up tds

and that is my problem with dumping all your resources into the defensebecause if you are depending on the unit you neglected in the off season to help your defense out

yeah good luck
i cant believe weve already given up 10 points to a team that hasnt been relevant since kurt cobain wrote a nirvana album
oh come on lamar he was looking at hill the whole play
fuck troy aikman dirty cowboys scumbag piece of shit

we need tall recievers because jackson airmails everything
ngl this game is kinda wild
ive been watching football for a majority of my life butlikewhat is this game
yes baker it does stink in your stadium it hosts the browns and its in cleveland
was that even catachable seemed way too for from lamb
queen actually believed he was getting to dalton and sadly thats about the best look weve had
is it just me or do we never have athletic wrs i mean it seems like dallas always has some guys with significant physicality we have lil hollywood and even when we spent a draft pick on a receiver it was perriman who never showed any real physical flashes

why cant we draft wrs
how about that no 1 wr for baltimore huh guys wasnt it a brilliant idea for the front office to send jackson out there with him as his go to wr
are these shlubs in the booth just gonna but hug the cowboys all fucking game
i am fine if ingram never takes another snap
the fact that this a game with the 38 cowboys has me incredibly worried boys
lamar sure dont look like he just recovered from cov19
dropping mcphee and blitzing humphrey
ravens are the best team in the league
they would give up the 4th down lmfaoooo
jimmy smith is the best cb secondary turns to shit when we he doesnt play
harbaugh is a bitch for not throwing the challenge flag we couldve had the ball but instead its still a game
we will lose to the browns chunt will shred us
even tucker jfc man what a fucking shit show this team is
hell yea brandon scotts finally mayor

ngakoue is looking like a fairly big bust at this point ngl
no matter what happens i love this team till i die

edit spelling
its a tuesday night i dont want to drink but ill start with one beer
is this real life
according to jayglazer dez bryant had an inconclusive covid19 test this morning and thought he could play tonight when he was warming up the doctors pulled him because the test was inconclusive they retested him at the stadium that test came back positive he was sent home jonmachota
no dez tonight shit
with or without dez we should no way in shape or form lose to these dallas cowboys
if the ravens lose this game im gonna be so sad youre all gonna be like hey champ you ok and ill be like dont call me champ
mcphee campbell and williams all back plus the monster of wolfe the unsung hero this year also thats an elliot on elliot tackle
im tired of andy dalton he needs to go away
2 minutes in who should we fire rn
who is 33 again i was impressed with him last game
lets gooooo d
3rd and 24 bring the blitz
lamar finna come out in the second half with sleeves its cold as fuck rn
im convinced our defense could intercept every pass except one and someone in the thread would say were gonna lose based on one catch
lamar ingram and dobbins shouldnt run a lot this game covid can affect your cardio big time i expect to see a lot of gus today
here we go
why is dobbins not the feature back
ingram huh
why ingram in
thanks for your commercial fox my relatives are now arguing
hes baaaack
take fucking ingram out why the fuck is he in
i dont care how fooled a defense is by a screenlikely need some blockers near the runner
ingram has the ball 2 times gains 3 yards
they really told dobbins you the starterjk its gonna be ingrams geriatric ass
hollywood stop going fucking backwards you little pussy
fucking why ingram was great and i love having him on the team but just fucking use dobbins fuck
not a great pass wasnt even going to be a 1st if caught
brown is soft and short arms shit
that ones on hollywood
wr 15 got popped after that pick
soulja
hollywood has two arms i wonder if he knows that
god brown is really not that good
brown is awful
what the fuck was that route supposed to accomplish 3 yards behind the first down marker
how useful is hollywood in runblocking
not a great throw but come on hollywood
idk how we can use holywood man he is not good at anyhting
lamar has to shrug that off cant have steelers multiple tos bullshit happen
at least hold em to a fg
bell can catch a pass behind him and at the same time also doesnt take off down the field towards his own end zone what a nice thing we should have can we get one of those
hollywood looking like a pewee freshman football player among those men
honestly fuck it lets just only run the ball forget passing
son of a nutcracker

please roman do something
cant believe mccarthy didnt try a fake punt there we never would have seen it coming
how do you have that great of a dline and cant get pressure on dallas 3rd string oline jesus this is going to be a long game
lamar needs to run more hed rather throw it now and not take the easy yards like last year
hmm i had thought we were done with stagnant offices since joe left guess not
lamar just needs to throw and catch the ball
all i want for christmas is a new oc im sick of romans same fucking 3 plays
atleast theyre playing phish at every commercial
i honestly dont know why greg tries to make mark ingram work when dobbins is clearly better
cant believe dez tested positive for covid during warm ups
im so tired im already wondering how im going to make it to the end of the game
2020 is shitting on the ravens
im convinced brown is to the ravens what obj is to the browns

being forced fed by a qb to avoid drama and resulting in garbage plays making the qb look worse than he actually is
give duv and proche snaps over hollywood
hot take that was a bad pass thats on lamar and also a catchable ball thats on hollywood
we give it to a running back other than ingram and immediately get way passed the los
whos dick do i have to suck to get dobbins some totes wtf
oh weird running works welp time to throw to hollywood
did lamars groin ever heal hes had that same limp all season
gus had a nice run better not keep him going gr probably
dobbins
this is why you play dobbins
its not even funny when us as viewers can understand and see gus and dobbins are the better backs and to run your hot players until you cant

roman doesnt do anything i truly believe he has no idea what to do outside running concepts
dobby is free once again
see what happens when you dont run ingram
look at that first dobbins carry for 15

its not that hard roman
roman ok ingram youre back in
dobbins with a huge run and its a surprise to no one
dobbins is the silver lining
gus and jk only please
bruh
dobbins the one spark right now
it is so hard for this team to play mistakefree football nowadays
just dont fucking throw the ball all game its fine
dez out for the rest of the year with a case of im too old for this shit
roman we better not see ingram for the rest of the game its clear hes not the same back ride gus and dobbins
jackson was playing with his mouth guard out on that last play
one pick one fumble so far so good
interception fumble out of the way give jk the ball and we good
what kinda play call is that screen on 2nd and 18
why the fuck are we using hollywood on short routes hes a deep threat when he actually wants to be
2nd and long and he tosses 3 yards behind to the guy who cant catch

i cant
are you fucking kidding me with that play 18 yards and you throw behind the los
go for it
go for it
yes lamar lets fucking goiii
mark ingram should never get another carry brown should never get on another team bus lamar needs to learn to play under center with these snappers and greg roman needs to be excommunicated from football
yea baby
give it to ingram hell get the yardage s
lfg lamar
thats my llama
td needed that shit
its simppllleeeeeee
oh my god the way aikman said thanksgiving
so lets just run every down lmao
shades of the seattle game
dejavu
welcome back lamar
thats just terrible defense but hey ill take it
there we go lamar doing what hes best at
keep this shit uppppp
thought jt missed that lol
welcome back 8
man i was waiting for a flag but thaaannk god no penalties on that run
lamar has scored three 35 yard tds on that exact play and im pretty sure all were third and short or fourth and short
browns ego is proportional to his skillin madden
i love you lamar demeatrice jackson i kiss your mama on the cheeks
llama
maybe covid put lamar through a time machine to 2019 or something
just like seattle last year
shoutout to the sound guy at fox for playing us off with rush
thats my fuckin dude there you go lamar so happy for him
wheres everybody complaining at now
hes baaaaccccckkkkkkkkkkkk
holy crap did that first quarter go fast
oh fuck
jesus fuck we cant do shit right
and back to your regularly scheduled programming the 2020 season
fucking wide open
deshone what the heck
wow and this was a great st unit historically and it gave that up
nice try tucker good form for real
jesus this fucking team man just impossible to play a consistently good game
straight up if we establish the run this game is ours we can just kill the clock and score this is 2020 greg roman tho
at this point i just laugh when something goes horribly wrong in a ravens game its always something new just gotta laugh and move on
marlon
of fucking course it would be against us fuck you
announcer jinx not surprised
fake crowd boos really
giving andy dalton all day to throw has hurt us before
fuck andy dalton can just get away from this bum
dog shit apparently you cant touch receivers at all
its disgusting
bad field position for our def last 2 possessions clean that up and ravens should have this game locked up
i legit cant understand how the dline cant get pressure on dallas there is so much talent on that dline just fucking unbelievable
we ran a succesful rpo
hollywood caught a contested catch im shocked
hollywood caught something
gus bus
wtf did he really catch one
tbf marlon is one of the few players this year who consistently earn their paycheck
run run run

dallas sucks against the run
gus it up
gus the bus beautiful
i watch other teams and get jealous at the separation if lamar doesnt throw the best pass of his career every play it dont work
we having at least 2 100 yard rushers in this game
the gus bus makes no stops
dont stop running the ball
im scared that management will shed gus and keep ingram and dobbins when we should be moving on from ingram
let gus cook
the architect of this offense lmao
guys were running the ball its so beautiful to see
i am excited for some play action tds
playaction for the touchdown baby calling it now
bro can we just be a regular team who calls regular plays
seems like the cowboys are unblocked in our back field pretty frequently here we have had some clutch bigplay runs but a lot of these plays are getting blown up immediately
what a play call on 3rd and 8
look down the field
do not jinx us
what the fuck are we doing damn hahaha
defense has to step up if they do we win this game
wtf
fuck you fuck you fuck you
fucking bradley bozeman
holy shit were melting
so its going to be one of those nights
still the goat
had to happen on prime time
fuck joe buck
are you fucking kidding me
what have we done to you football gods
wtf
wtf
that was no good i cant even tell from the camera angle i guess i just have to trust the refs on this one but it looked really close to having gone directly over and above the upright which would be good if it had
joe buck whatre you doing
shows how important the entire wolf pack is arent we missing one of them
are you kidding me wow unlike tuck
fuckinjoe
you dusty hair plug cunt buck
entire team is failing today
fire justin

i am kidding
cant even blame tucker we iced our own kicker lol
if someone could murder joe buck all sports would benefit
we suck in all phases the great trifecta
the ultimate jinx is acknowledging that you are jinxing them and still doing it
wtf is going on we couldnt just snap the ball on the first kick we had to try to make them jump offsides and then we fuck it up with a false start then we miss the fucking kick on the next try jesus christ this is the worst season and its so heart wrenching its like every little thing happens that comes back to bite us in the ass
nfl games are predetermined confirmed living in a simulation how come everything bad is happening seconds after someone mentions it lol
lets not focus on the jinx but the flag
honestly if you told in 2017 me that wed have a mediocre season during a pandemic after two great years id take it
if we lose this game roman better get the boot this shit is embarrassing
for the xth time this team lacks heart and strength

top down issue starting with our fo we have been poorly developing players for a decade and scouting the wrong ones we dont hold our players or coordinators accountable either
lol is it really joe bucks fault though like id blame the olineman that essentially iced his own kicker with that false start over some superstitious jinx by joe buck
it says a lot about how good tucker is that we stop watching to get snacks when hes kicking cuz we assume hell always make it

we still love u jt its ok
wooooooooooo
droty
yass queen
crown the queen
queeennnn
lets go
the queens gambit pays off
just when i lose hope they pull me right back in
god i fucking love queen man is my dad
we needed that hell yeah
lfg
boykin redemption game
the ball didnt come within 6 of the ground and tucker was playing 4d chess

like a sac fly thats not a hit to his stats
td boykin
yassss queen
i can breathe now
yesssss what a catch
holy shit we fucking did something
boykin td
yo wtf was that a passing touchdown
damn that was a bad throw and an outstanding catch
well this took a quick turn that was about to get bad
fuck yeah boykin
fuck yes boykin
patrick queen is my new favorite raven hes swag as fuck
was that separation wtf
bro yall are a fucking rollercoaster of emotion lmao holy shit
could have been a better ball but the result is the same lfg
oh shit what just happened boyked
yo boykin scoring just to shit on you doom and bloomers fuck you he said
and then queen does what he doesstay with it folks
greg heart attack roman strikes again
damn i guess the miss was worth it lol
ok boykin
thats a hell of a play and finish
tucker is off today both pats were off centre and the missed fg
that would of been dez
wheres all you little bitch whiners now jesus let the game play out
boykin breakout game please
2 hands on the ball its amazing how that works
wait tucker missed a fg
lmao that defense does not know how to tackle
i called the playaction touchdown
can we please just beat the shit out of the cowboys now
yoink
dez boykin
hill and boykin been earning their snaps on special teams i like that

boykin
i want to be excited about that boykin td but even that looked a little shaky but ill take it
thats my quarterback
dez has covid
boykin is still a 5 wr on a good team upgrade the weapons
we could have trade skura and a nice piece of lettuce for hopkins man
why cant we get to dalton their line cant be that good
who was in here saying tucker couldnt kick a touchback he can kick them fine he makes a conscious decision most times to kick it high at the goal line to get ideally a short return
need some fuckin sacks already damn
ayo what ever happened with earl thomas felt like an eternity ago
why is lamb always open lol
offense scores defense starts letting them drive down the field
wolfe has been so good in the run game
something needs to change on 3rd and longs we absolutely suck on them for some reason
ravens d wont play too aggressive this game they want dalton to make the mistake not them
bruh wolfe has really really stepped it up like hes been dominant
what the fuck was peters doing on that coverage
d is not legally allowed to make a 3rd down stop
peters always 10 yards off
what the fuck is this coverage why was peters so far off come on wink
peters playing kinda scares so far find your mojo man
where is the pass rush jesus man
this sub including myself has no appreciated wolfe for what he has done
yikes that zone was terrible fuck zone against dalton 4th and 12 flashbacks
holy shit the cushion
d is giving too much space
bro a miscommunication like that on defense is unacceptable
peters playing so fucking soft man
wtf is going on with the defense
lol just point at gallup and dont pick anyone else up interesting strategy
if we cant get pass rush today were never getting it cowboys ol is literally uber drivers and wendys janitors
for all the man coverage skills we have why do we insist on playing 10 yards off at all times
what a shocker the offense is playing well so the defense obviously doesnt
how are we not getting any pressure on dalton against dallas banged up line
seemed like zone d but our lbs are in man
lol averett just pointing and watching
remember that year we had suggs and dumervil man that was nice actually getting to the qb
i dunno why the cowboys are trying to run their receivers are wide ass open every play
mcphee deserves judons money
get a fucking stop
something about the way dalton plays football just works against this d he always throws it so fast
technically that grounding
is it just me or does calais have some serious anterior pelvic tilt
wheres the d from last week lol
this defense i think says we think we can win this in a war of attrition i dont disagree as long as we are willing to adjust when required
bahaha
yaaaaasssss
told ya
lmao
this game is bizzare
iced
an eye for an eye
kickers getting fucked tonight lmao
is there a serious wind in bmore or something
lol you cant make this shit up both kickers get a five yard penalty and miss a typically easy kick
deion gonna get a charge stealing peoples pizzas
friendship needed with hollywood boykin is my new best friend
lol wtf
aikman is bias
that was insane wow what was their defense thinking
hell yeah that was catchable the only reason it wasnt a little closer is cuz they held him down
dez was seen on camera hugging cowboys coaches pregame

bro the entire nfl season is about to mirror the movie contagion hopefully wo the deaths
our first pi
first pi drawn of the year
he still hit him early still a penalty
fuck troy aikman
he grabbed his head regardless something wouldve got called
jk is the man
lol luke wilson trying to play grown man ball like andrews at half the size
dobbins is a top 10 back in the league he doesnt start
dobbins is fast
dobby
lamar its like wilson not mark hes gonna stop mark runs up the field thats the reason
why we cant make pitch work
feed that boi
were on pace for 320 rushing yards
dobbins rb1
dubbins
how do we keep getting pre snap penalties on offense
damn hollywood is tiny
lol illegal formation
what does that penalty even mean tf
we get illegal formation at least 2 times a game every week
shouldnt that flag blow the play dead instead of giving the defense a free play
guys just be glad wr 15 caught it
i mean yeah he made it but shut up about it
jesus run the ball its working
i swear we have so many speedsters but never run sweeps lamar obviously cant make pitch work we keep trying
lack of practice showing thru tonight
i do not understand what the fuck an illegal formation is i cant believe i didnt get the call to come play last week when we couldnt field a full roster im literally perfect for this team
i really hate that they keep trying to make that play work where they basically cut the field in half it really struggles it forces lamar to throw into tight windows not his specialty and it makes it impossible for lamar to take off
we take way too many procedural penalties
we need more levels in our routes just have one guy run a slant and another run a deep dig lamar is good at intermediate routes over the middle
at least one illegal formation penalty every fucking game

could probably count the amount of times ive heard that call against us in my life on one hand before this season
hes a god again
yep cant score in the redzone bottom half in the league for td percentage in the redzone
seattle sounders do they put things in their urethra
peters leg is hurt
will we ever sack dalton seriously if we cant sack against this line baker going to throw all over us next week
this says the ravens only have 4 illegal formation penalties this season which leads the league but cannot possibly be correct


really thought id be seeing more pressure on dalton this game
were going to let them get in fg range
we literally cant get any pressure on the quarterback no matter how many guys we send on a 3rd string oline smh
who else saw a d lineman jsut get tackled and no penalty thats was us last night basically
whoever their rt is is bullying whoever we have rushing on that side
yea that looked like a flag on us but im not complaining
we got away with that one
we got away with one there
damn we kinda got away with that
bowser has the snap count timed he slipped there but bro he bgg is playing great
lol refs
we got lucky there lol
there were about 4 penalties on that play refs said fuckit
we deserve a non call or 2 thanks refs
feeling like the steelers getting away with a call like that

dont like it
definitely shouldve been at least holding or illegal contact but not pi
nice
damn thats an awesome throw
thats the opposite of the jets
jesus fuck that should have been caught
the fact they almost pulled that off is ridiculous
why not go for some pressure and try and get tucker a long fg
im glad we dont have adam gase
playing it pretty soft we didnt rush a single player
wow we got lucky there
eh if the defense gets a good amount practice for the game they will be alright
yeah those replays of the hail mary look absurd not one single ravens player looks like they brought their hands above their helmet
on the bright side 1 penalty all game
i feel like ceedee could have easily ran through that pretty light contact and ceedee instead flopped for the call he is a strong dude
i honestly wish someone would show games with no announcers id pay for that
ravens wr snaps in h1 unofficial 27 total snaps

boykin 25
brown 24
duvernay 24
proche 2

boykin seeing a lot of snaps with dez out ravensflock yoshi2052
damn yeah that was pretty nuts deshon didnt get flagged
good on duv going down rather than losing the ball
awuzie refuses to be blocked by bigger players lol
duvernay was so close to breaking that
wow
wow
that was ugly
boykin was open
what the hell happened to his footwork and throwing mechanics
160 rush yards in the first half so immediately abandon it
why are so afraid to be who we are i found life became much more enjoyable when i embraced the fact i was a dick
still no sacks
tired of these fucking holds being allowed
how the fuck it was not holding on ngakoue
these dudes really cant get pressure on this depleted ass line
not one single piece of this team has improved as the year progressed i realize covid and all sorts of other factors but thats astonishing this team is much worse than it was in week 1
yannick is invisible
zeke been struggling just play the ravens cowboys oline struggling play the ravens pass rush they will be gods why is it when a team has struggles on things when they play us they disappear
team looks so fucking flat
look at all the time dalton has in the pocket
d is getting cooked
damn we got lucky cooper was open
our defense plays with the mentality of i hope they make a mistake instead of forcing them
can somebody wipe that blood off the tip of andy daltons nose maybe
the reffing has been decidedly bad i will give them no holds cause they havent called any either way
hahaha he missed again
got lucky there mp and humphrey look absolutely lost havent seen averett much idk if thats a good thing or if hes just not getting snaps
oooooooh that feels so goooood
running the ball every play wins us the game but figuring out something consistent in the passing game gives us a shot to compete with brownsgiants
those are some terrible dog owners
mt out here ruining careers
desperation bowl wtf
come on offense i want an 8 minute drive capped with a td pound that rock
i got excited for dobbins being in on that 2nd down play then lamar pulls the ball back and keeps it to get 2 yards damn but the 3rd down run was nice
thats a 1st
fuck yeah lamar
pls run with jk
dobbins ingram all day
jk all day
dobbins may be as fast or faster then lamar no reason he shouldnt be the first look at rb
dobbins rules
i dont see why roman doesnt see that dobbins and edwards are getting chunk yardage while ingram is getting next to nothing and still decides to put him in i love ingram as much as the next guy here cause i love the energy he brings but jfc we need to stick to 1 or 2 and let them cook
isnt it wild that first down handoffs go for 2 yards max with ingram but you do the exact same play with dobbins or gus and they work for 5 almost like theres something to learn there just maybe
ingram should run in the 4th quarter is dobbins and gus are gassed otherwise let him do his personality thing from the sideline and talk him into staying as a rb coach
lets just bleed clock and at least make it a twoscore game please
3 carries in a row for dobbins in the second half are we sure roman is still calling the plays
dobbins is averaging 89yrds keep feeding him romam
9 of 12 for 76 yards is bad
hey guys this running game is having some good tractioni think its time we throw three downs in a row
seriously lamar
his mechanics suck
lamar come on dawg
gro mustve read this subreddit now that jk is in
so fucking bad
run the ball
fucking greg roman s
i really really like dobbins
boykin looked open for the first down there
come on he was wide open
god cut justice hill
why tf is dobbins getting subbed out this is bullshit
damnit hollywood but that wasnt a good pass
why in the fuck is hill in there
this guy cant throw man what the fuck is going on lately
i figured it out ingram has had enough of this football bullshit they had their 4th child a year ago he just wants to enjoy life not worrying about injuries and whatnot so he channelled all his energy into his padawan jk dobbins
ah yes

shit throw into false start

love it
lamar really carrying romans shitty scheme
i rarely get to watch games living in tx and i want this season to be over with
lamar run good lamar pass bad

edit i rescind my statement
lamars run game is n point passing not so much but hes running efficiently
thank christ for lamars legs
why is justice hill in the game
souljaaaaaa
soulja play
soulja sighting
what a fuckin throw
oh look play action working again
there we go
soulja
good block dobby
hollywooooood
fuck yeah
soulja
soulja boy
what a throw
we need to sell our soul for a wr next season not a toy or gadget on but like a proper 62 63 wr that can go up and get the ball
soulja
hollywood making catches tn thank god
damn what a throw
ok hollywood now do that more than once every few games
what a fucking throw jfc
soulja boi tell um
hollywhooped friccin morons
that was pretty as hell happy for marquise there
fuckin dime
wtf was that graphic lmao they made him look light skin
souljah
throw it on a dime
soulja time
trac3 s
enjoy that gatorade hollywood
what a fucking dime holy shit
this quarter has lasted so long
its great to see brown making a great catch after running a perfect route theres the potential of this offense right there
now if only we could get consistency from them both we would be cooking
good adjustment by brown to cut up field beautiful pass by lamar on the run
this is what happens when lamar takes off and makes them worry about the ground game we open up receivers
hmmmm i am smelling something smells like a fumble
ferguson is a big fucking dude
how is he that wide open
so much for having an elite secondary they look clueless
wolfs been showing up
clear grounding
a good pass rush thats new
our defense cant hold them to a three and out for shit
run stop has been pretty good pass rush and coverage has been awful
just gotta start tackling their guys duh
get ready for the big turnoveri feel it
the biggest surprise outside of the dez news is our wrs catching tds
fort just gave me the stank face what a play covered up the tight end played the run and broke up the pass in one play
that should have been picked

you all armchair qbs work for circque du soleil and at home because of covid
first tube
sack
hey we got a sack
where is the fort love he just covered a te played the run and then recovered and broke up the pass wtf thats one of the best lb plays ever
yesss we finally got a sack
oh my fuck it actually worked for once
we can get sacks
yannick be getting pushed to the outside every time
cowboys kicker is ass lol
great time for our first sack to force a long field goal
thank you d finally
that wind is insane
our pass rush is way worse without judon hope all the judon haters can see his value
haha what the hell happened to greg the leg
someone is seriously in zuerleins head
lmfao he missed again
damn rough day for their kicker
joe buck is paying the price for the jinx earlier
14 pt game with 1414 left in the 4th
greg you fired
we dont need sacks or defense when we have greg zurelein
ricard just laid that poor dude out
lmao lets go pat
well now we know ricard is good
pro bowler pat ricard
got to like ricards return to the field very much in his style
in all seriousness its been pretty windy in the baltimore area the past few days its a tough ask for anyone to make a kick
my man bounced off project pat
choo choo motherfuckers
holy shit i feel bad for zuerlein i remember him jt and blair walsh were the next big thing at kicker when they were rookies
foot meet throat
how much do you guys think ricard squats lol
gus was such a great find
gus looking explosive today
pat ricard legit our most sure handed receiver
shades of last season this drive
can anyone remind the score when they played pitt
this is the most lively ive seen lamar in a few weeks i love it
5 rushes for 70 yards gus is eating like usual
just run up the middle
glad we got the first but looked like dobbins had room to run after the catch
so nice to see lamar having fun out there again
for once dobbins made the wrong read on that one
nice run by ingram finally
lamar is stupid good at that shit

its insane
lets punch it in with dobbins
didnt set his feet
in tucker we trust
digging the chalk dust
troy aikman jinx cost the cowboys 9 points from field goals
please just be a covid rust
if nothing else hopefully this game gets lamars confidence back up so when he has his favorite targets back hes more on point dude actually looks like hes having fun out there for the first time since week 5
why is our coverage such shit tonight is wink having a worse game than roman
finish this drive and safe to call it a night
all year weve been giving up first down after first down with soft coverage
this secondary is getting exposed without jimmy smith
fuck not humphrey
noooooooooooooooooooo marlooooo
how is that not a hold
humph no
not humphrey please
how was that a first down lol am i just biased
of course a terrible spot leads to marlon getting hurt on the next play holy shit
im purely speculating but marlon wasnt grabbing anything and also didnt look like he was in that much pain when he was on the ground hopefully he just got shaken up on that play
its just really hard to play corner when the guy can shove you at the top of his route without any fear of a penalty but if you in any way try to counter it youre probably getting a flag on you
hensley says he looks fine
how is a multi billion dollar league still using a guy running 20 yards a legit way to measure
how the hell is this defense ranked 8
yea keep humphrey out the rest of the way fuck this game onto cleveland
at this point i just want this game to end

its been 25 hours of dumb roman play calls and soft ass defense
those lips on cams drawing looked so fucking exaggerated and racist lmao who the fuck thought that looked good
averett just getting picked on
tackling maybe should be a point of emphasis
bowser gotta make that tackle
damn they literally clotheslined fort
challenge
yannick finish the play for once lol
ngakoue is coming so close every time lmao
thats a pick
fort had it
that was an interception to this is bs
that was an int and not pi
wow that was a pick
lmao never a pi but not an int
fuck you refs
if dallas scores hopefully you guys keep getting some first downs and finish strong
damn these stops on the goal line are nuts
run d
fuck yea this red zone d is solid
yo i cant believe how hard we held zeke like this thats fucking bullying
really good catch
peters lost again
this and the pats game considering the competition is the worse d i seen all year the chiefs are the chiefs so thats whatever
mp got burnt
mp was on skates
for fucks sake
peters is not a good cover corner hes a ball hawk this happens every week
phish count at least 3
marcus peters wtf
as we are right now we are not a playoff team shits sad
lmao how did they think its not even 10 yards
why are they even fucking talking about this lol
why is this even a debatable call
this is not a question
guys believe it or not the games arent always going to be as easy as they were last year we have a 10 point lead with under 4 minutes left ill take that every week even if its ugly
i dont think the refs would rule it a pick anyways
lol lj fort picked that off oh well
stop running backwards pls
mfw lamars fake handoff fools the fox camera operator
at some point they need to call personal fouls for jumping on proche after he was down just seems dangerous to let them pile on him after a clear recovery
did we really need slow motion shots of proche clearly holding the ball being slowly tackled sitting there and then slowly beginning to get up to know that the cowboys were full of shit
baker looks like a rat
why are you getting fancy run up the middle and get that 1st down to end this game
cool juke for no gain like that meme from yesterday lol
thank the lord
fucking gus bus man that man is a different breed
gus bus
edwards is ridiculous
theres no reason gus edwards shouldnt get 50 of the 2nd half carries
feels good to beat andy dalton

fuck him
gus edwards is unreal
i like ingram coming off the bench less pressure and he can come in fresh against lineman that are getting worn out
that marlon humphrey cackle
i love gus edwards
the bus is rolling
ill eat crow here when i saw ingram on the field for the 3rd down i thought it would kill the drive gj
i wouldve preferred if that was gus but jk fucking dobbins
jk dobbins
ez money
dobby
dobbins is a fucking monster
talk your shit obj
lets go lets fucking go
scoring a td would ice this lets go ravens
jk all day
ez money
6 rush yards shy of 300 damn
gg ez cowboys
hell yeah
the rushing box score is going to be absurd
the cowboys need to buy an entirely new defense

yikes theyre awful
we played pretty decent today defense got some things to work on though if were gonna beat the browns
looked like humphrey just gave up there
goldberg goldberg
lmao bro what the fuck
pick 6 or bust
the afc is much tougher than the nfc this year ravens kc pittsburgh buffalo miami cleveland and even the titans are tough
um can we not do hugs
elliot a straight thumper
how are we gonna protect averett next week
how about harbaugh stops playing 4d fucking chess and just kick the ball out of the end zone every time
lamar hasnt looked great
yikes lamar cannot throw anything over 10 yards tonight
seriously boykin might have scored a td on that play if the ball was accurate

lamars mechanics need fixing
the cowboys are awful we not winning against cleveland playing like this
boykin was wide open and the throw was atrocious again
once again the halffield play

lamar is so furstratingly inconsistent
shoutout to the run game but our passing offense is a complete disaster the pass plays look like shit i used to draw up with other kids on the playground
we got this covid was a revival for this team lets make this push
were fucking cursed
welp looks like it aint gonna work out for dez
dream of a blue wave ends in ga lol wtf
these passing concepts are trash man
did dobbins fuck grs wife or something
just to remind everyone theres absolutely no reason for us to lose to the 38 dumpster fire cowboys none i dont wanna see a single we can still do it postcomment here
good that interception almost made my head explode wtf was the playcall the pass decision by lamar the piss poor attempt by madden legend hollywood
we need to get rid of 15 asapppppppp
hey dez chill
why is skura at center
dont be surprised if roman abandons the run
if he dropped that td then that would be a pitiful pi call
man marlo has been struggling since covid
well thats a fucking announcer jinx if ive ever seen one
ah yes a short pass to justice hill surely will work
fuck off and go to hell joe buck
fuck you troy and fuck you buck
everybody in here has to calm down a bit lol
is it opposite day queen int boykin big td what next
defense elite
offense struggling
baltimore ravens
lmao fuck you troy and buck karma
joe buck too busy riding troys cowboy cock
the refs are against us s
refs giving us an actual break for oncd
banned of rnfl for 3 days yeehaw so here i be
the defense hasnt looked great at all tonight granted the points came on short fields as a result of hollywood and special teams but theyre pretty much able to do what they want they got bailed out by the no call at the end of the half too

ravens should be running away with this thing given their rushing attack vs the cowboys defense but alas its the 2020 ravens so here we are expecting a pass heavy second half cause greg gonna greg
imagine if they spent this much time talking about the no calls pitt always gets
x200b

now lamar has mechanical issues
lamars mechanics have regressed idk what his offseason coach did to him
guy wins the mvp and all of a sudden doesnt need to work with his throwing coach this summer only ab and the soulja
i feel like lamar lost some of the chip on his shoulder dont remember the lazy passes like that last year
alright zeke give us one of those fumbles youve coughed up all year
designed lamar plays are complete wastes of time 99 of the time lamar is a quarterback fucking throw
aikman is a piece of shit glad we dont play on fox much
yet another pass rusher tackled by their oline with no flag
thats gorunding
why does our defence always suck ass in the 4th quarter
you cant miss these throws against good teams this defense is abysmal
that play never works
okay

lamar hasnt played his best football today but man hes missing short range passes which is very unlike him some of this might be rust

just trying to be fair
like a guy below said yea lamar missed thr throw but most other qbs are getting sacked on that play be appreciative lmao
how did john not challenge that
peters sucks most of the time wtf is wrong with him
if lamar does that throw then its muh lamar bad

but since its dalton people dont talk about it
fuckin pick play holding on the o line clear as fuckin day jesus refs what the fuck
hate to be a downer but thats a good example of lamar needing to work on his touch boykin was wide open and the ball was a jumper almost gave the defense a chance to catch up
im not going to pretend like brown literally didnt just miss the ball with his hands and got lucky it hit his forearms

he ran a nice route but christ clean the catches up if you want to talk big shit
yall bitch just as much up 10 as you do when were down 20 goddamn
roman is a talent vampire he sucked all the talent out of our offense and lamar and this is what we have left
yall switch up so fast lmao
were just a bad football team
im convinced there is not a more bipolar group of fans on this site than this one right here
peters man you gotta make that play or dont do it at all
another shitty throw
its insane how inconsistent lamar is like what in the fuck was that throw to boykin but the throw to hollywood was amazing
bad throw but can we talk abt the playcall lamar had to make something out of nothing
not to be a nagging female but we need to get better at wearing masks on the sideline and masks that go over the nose
uhhhh is the game cancelled
im bummed for dez im sure he really wanted this game and to get pulled at such a late hour for such an awful reason i wish him the best as i do for everyone who gets covid yes even steelers and whats worse is its still running around within the organization i hope all these young guys dont have lingering effects
fuck the cowboys fuck covid fuck joe buck an fuck the steelers
and now roman puts in fucking justice hillfireable offense in itself
hollywood doesnt get to bitch anymore last week he wouldnt lay out for the pass that he could have caught

tonight he cant even bring his other hand up
bench brown seriously
fuck roman with a cactus in his ass fucking garbage ass coordinator
ravens offense seems to have reverted back to flaccomorninwheg days
wow clear hold
ugh tucker my boy what have they done to you
were just so cursed it all started when earl tweeted before the titans game last year
hollywood is lucky we dont have enough guys to field a team he could use a week in the cooler to get his head right
we dont get pressure
howw is that on marlon
how was that dpi lmao
we dont care anymore both onfield and in the boardroom we give away a dumbass easy td like that and all our players do is go oh no and walk off no passion

and our board clearly doesnt give two shits since greg roman is still employed
humphrey didnt even jump
oh wow a checkdown on 3rd and 8 nice call roman
he legit only looked at 1 read fuck man
roman about to get cute and stop running how many fucking times has this happened
gonna be one of those games
bruh fuck joe buck lmao
damn it buck what hell why did you even bring it up
yall are crazy with the jinx nonsense
we still dont look good this is what we should be doing against a bad team but much better than this lets hope its just a little rust
3 timeouts 2 minute warning run the fucking ball
at least try to get 2 feet in what the hell
this is our chance to fire greg roman before he ruins any playoff runchemistry that we have
that is big time pass interference and something that people who are just looking at penalties against penalties for are missing penalties not called
tj jacked up hollywood way harder last week in the exact same situation and also was a no call also ball needs to be catchable and it was 20 yards over their heads
stupid imo to only send one guy this aint madden lmao
not a single raven put their hands up on that hail mary lol
troy and joe are terrible to listen to i hope our guys shut them up and send them home mad
run the god damn fucking ball wtf is this
man lamar passes are so loose and easy

need to fix that
can we please take this offseason to do whatever they did after 2018 to fix his throw mechanics again hes doing the sidearm shit so often when it isnt needed now
almost like its predictable that wed get a three and out like i got 11 downvotes about

roman calling shit plays and lamar overthrowing arent the issue though because we have 161 rushing yards against a 48 team
has lamar regressed or is it just that the receivers suck 76 yards were in the 3rd quarter
like what happened with ingram since last season was it just yonda making him more productive
ok we need more of that from soulja and lamar
i just dont know how he will make those ridiculous rolling left back shoulder throws but miss a 10 yard slant by 5yds the inconsistency is just mind blowing
rnfl in shambles after that throw
just realized no matter how annoying buck and aikman may be ill take any announcer over collinsworth
if dallas had made those three field goals this is a one score game defense has been playing worse than the scoreboard shows
harbaugh should have whipped that flag out and yeeted it immediately

shit wins the game
thats fucking horse shit that they even had the opportunity to score that interception taken off the board

why the fuck do we get fucked by refs every single goddam week
zebras can eat my salty nuts
easy money greg roman cant you see that
that play just now gave me ptsd
god dammit dalton whyd you have to 4th and long us again with 50 seconds left
these completions wont matter but it is important to notice that averett is a completly liability and got burned by their whole wr corps
cut yannick and ingram for a wr1
honestly if brown is already this much ofa diva with what looks like a fraction of the talent of his cousin its spelling bad news for him
that pick was a bad throw
it is 30 blow up the team and draft a whole new one the game is over
queue the grown ass men screaming and blaming the announcers for that lmao never gets old
somebody please draw patrick queen as killer queen from jojo
please see that top down replay by fox to see how the floating arc pass by lamar was actually a dime to not get an int
lamars mechanics coming out of college were inconsistent hes not there yet but the lack of a real offseason did him no favors at all he will be fine
throw it on a dime time
gonna regret the peters contract in a year or two hes been really bad since the extension
cant wait
lets go
lets fucking go ravens
take my energy lamar
fucking bullshit
the comments on the live pregame show on youtube are an absolute shit show lol
jerry snuck a positive test in so dez wouldnt womp dat ass
who tf is cousin sal
all other ravens players tested negative for covid19 and no highrisk close contacts were identified source said so no dez bryant but game on as scheduled and no other players impacted tompelissero
does anyone else have to be pulled because of contact tracing
belee dat
we finally won a coin toss lets go
lamar looks rdy dude
dez bryants daily pcr test taken this morning came back tonight and was inconclusive per source the test was rerun and that also was inconclusive he was pulled off the field for a poc test which was positive for covid19 thats why hes out against the cowboys tompelissero

unlike many teams the ravens are so close to the lab they get their test results back the same day rather than overnight with an 805 pm eastern kickoff the rerun and retest process played out while dez was at the stadium before he was pulled off the field tompelissero
on the bright side our whole team has already had covid so they probably couldnt have caught it from dez
is williams and campbell back
we won the toss and defer might as well just give us the win and save potentially larger covid outbreak since its an automatic win for us
i hope we smash the cowboys tonight
thats what you call an elliottonelliott tackle
this is such bullshit player safety my ass
off tackle runs for 69 and the ravens d name a better duo
first game ill be able to watch since the colts game a few weeks ago and dez gets the rona its always something lol but lets get the w
questionable
can we get a stop one time tho
not the call i wouldve called
fortified
fuck yeah
alright folks drama behind us lets see some damned ravens football
lol zek should have just dropped it
lol
lets go llama
thank god lamar is back
wish i had a stream that doesnt stop after one play
lets go roman dial up the pass pass pass for me
get ingram off the field no more
ingram and 2 yards name a better duo
why is ingram the starting back

llama baby
we want dobbins
really glad were running with the hot handingram
where is dobbins
why is ingram out there
get ingram out bring dobbins in ffs
31st in passing

yikes
ingram i love you but why are you still starting
nice job marquise losing two yards for no reason
steve smith sr roasted the hell outta roman it was glorious
where the fuck is dobbins ingram is such a waste
nice backwards run
lets give dobbins 1 carry for 5 yards and take him out the game
fuck
sigh whatever
even if he caught that it had no chance at a first down wtf
jesus christ
lol
ass
oh boy here we go again
unfucking believable
great
use two fucking hands what the fuck
this team man what in the fuck
smh
yup
ffs dont know why i had high expectations coming into this
it feels like our tips always get picked steelers can have 7 with 0 but raven tips always get intercepted
thats a really fucking good pass for most recievers fuck
same old same old
dallas fan here rooting for you guys to win i want a top 3 pick in the draft
here we go with these playcalls again
were playing against the worst run defense in football
why would you pass
roman bout to make the cowboys d look elite af im sick of these fucking drives
look at this hollywood hopsffs
thanks soulja
goddammit
mcphee has looked good so far today
brown sucks ass
jfc queen needs to get better
about to get embarrassed tonight
come the fuck on brown youre a professional receiver use two hands
why is 33 on gallup
well at least our defense is still good
the pick was a bad throw but just because it was a bad throw does not mean the throw was interception worthy but unlucky but it just ended up in 3 points need the offense to start clicking asap
go fightin covid corvids
anothers levels concept by greg roman
we gotta limit the florida men on this team
can we try duvernay or proche more on the offense just get brown out please
dont put dobbins in we didnt want to win anyway keep playing ingram
gus still a bus
just accept that if we lose this game we dont deserve the playoffs makes this much more interesting
its actually incredible how many players on this team who were good last year are anywhere from mediocre to terrible this year
as an outsider why do you hate ingram so bad
bus bedwards
gus edwards nearly got as many yards on that run as he did all of last week
what the fuck did dez think was gonna happen in a pandemic
all gus edwards does is run right up the middle and get 8 yards every time keep him in
hell of a fucking run lets gooo
dobbins
keep dobbins in roman
dobbins all day
feed dobbins the rock
why tf did ingram get snaps gj jk
alright dobbins cant block for shit but on running downs hes the cats meow
imagine that dobbins getting a big run
wow same exacy time of run to dobbins and he gets 13 yards stop starting ingram please
we need a steady diet of dobbins runs and lamar runs
nah that guy sucks back to the bench
time for ingram to get 5 more carries
who look dobbins plays and we start moving down the field who woulda thought
i love ingram but gus and dobbins need to be 12 for the rest of the season
we give it to gus and jk and we immediately do well running stop giving it to ingram
jk has the explosiveness that ingram does not
well would ya look at thatits almost like dobby is super talented
triggered
who the fuck is snapping
for fuck sake with fucking snaps
ingram
gus bus
dobbins

which one do you think gets the most carries today
feeed this man
where have intermediate passes gone
cant wait for the two more snaps to gus and dobbins before 3min left in the 4th down 10pts
what even is that play
dobbins in one run got more yards than ingram will all game
he didnt drop it
brown is just nothing special hes a guy hed be a good third stringer on a team with a decent offense
we should use that dobbins kid more
let dobbins be great more snaps
go for it
we got this
lamar said no
go for it give it to gus


edit or that

why does hollywood stand 2yds in front of the line of scrimmage when we need 10 yds lmao
oh fuck yeah

i like this
ill take it
lolez
touchdown llama
lamar i love you
lamar is backkkkk
there he is
that boi gone
thatll do
holy shit yes
did we run that same exact play on 4th and 2 vs the r words this year think it was the same exact spot too lol
thats my qb
i think the stream of the game on twitch is faster than regular cable
lamaaaaaaaaa
lamar welcome back
1921 dom perignon lamar
my heart nearly dropped on the pa i havent felt that in a long time
aint mad at dez i wouldnt want to take multiple covid test every week either
thank you
how is it that myself and probably many others knew it was going to be a fake handoff that lamar keeps and runs with and nobody covered him
watching on prime i saw the td and went to this feed just to see negative comments because of the bad snap hollywood getting bullied out of bounds on the screen luke willson praise for actually catching it lmfao
can someone find a link to that td im studying for a final exam and cant be in front of a tv
if we establish a run that they cant stop play action is gonna open up so much
the best running team in the league playing the worst run defense and roman is thinking too hard
hell yeah coach lets go for it
its was so obviously what was going to happen on that fourth down play you had to know lamar was going to keep it right dallas
the veer is the best run we have
anyone else want to draft penei sewell in the worst way id legit move up for him
wtf
damn it special teams
harbaugh is a former special teams coach
what the fuck was that
jesus man
why are we shooting ourselves this year i dont get it
jfc can we do something good without 20 bad things happening fuck man
typical ravens football keep it close ugh
tranquillo motherfuckers they havent done anything but get a nice runback
i hate my favorite team
coaching fundamentals aka what we been lacking since october
we should be better in second half hopefully
wtf was that
we are making the fucking cowboys look good fuck
how are we pretty much one on one and getting no qb pressure
where is the pressure i better not see yall blaming humphrey for covering a dude for 7 seconds and then letting him get open lmfao
how do we lock down pitt and struggle here
we havent been able to practice in two weeks right
well that sucks only 4 plays and the answer back
lets get another one lj
welp so far this game looks like the past few weeks lets hope something changes
i feel like ferg misses a lot of tackles
offense gonna stunt defensive is looking porous
give me dobbins
offense shows flashes of 2019 offense

defense lets go ahead and take a break
oh good this game has been deemed the desperation bowl exactly what i wanted 2020 to be for a team that broke records last season
so far theyve scored on a tipped ball and a st fuck up nothing entirely alarming lets cool our jets fam
soulja redemption
wack
souljia catches it when its dropped in his chest nice big bucks material
that was approaching gritty for marquise
if you need a distraction from the game put us at 18 just out of the playoffs and keep trying til we finally get our prized 1 receiver
wow hollywood is actually catching tonight nice
lead the ball man he had nothing but grass infront of him
hell yeah nice run
that juke by gus
gus bus all aboard
gus bus
gus edwards huge run
all aboard
yes more run game run game was literally what drove our offense last year this is what we need to be doing
only reason dallas is winning this game is because of our stupid mistakes im so turned of this shit
lets get dobbins and gus some carries
its great seeing you guys shit on marlon and queen when they have a bad play while simultaneously praising the offense anytime they look remotely competent after weeks of being bad
did yall see gus make that guy miss
gus with the juke
that juke lol
gus bus all day every day
yes gus
gus dobbins lets go
punish these mfs man
feed jk and gus
beep beep motherfuckers
is this going to be one of those 7268 highschool scores
run the ball all night
ingram wouldve been tackled for a loss by jaylon there

gus gets a huge gain
every play should be a run
fucking get ingram out why
you would think we wouldnt stop running

greg roman has other ideas
hell yes run it down their throats
theres no way we just called that on 3rd down
wheres the goddamn play action
i like justice hill i thought he was much older than he was until i picked up madden this year lol
surely a play designed to get past the line dude really is whack
tf didnt he snap the ball
holy moly
weve been gettin really close to some delay of games same last week why dont we try some early in the play clock snaps and set up hard counts
damn announcers jinx
o
fuck
why does justice hill get snaps seriously
lmao
lol
murphys law
what the actual fuck
wow
pure comedy
fuck bozeman
how does that even hook the wind was going right and the ball was strait up and down
cant wait for jamarr chase or devonta smith
wtf is going on
literally jinxed it lmao
p a i n
joejust shut the fuck up
fuck you joe
that looked good to me
it happened
this is literally painful to watchsad
im in shock
i am displeased
no such thing as a jinx just got in tucks head
pain
same shit as the saints game smh
petition to fire joe buck
me rn
just not our year literally nothing has gone right

madden curse 2020
undisciplined ass team
serious question what does harbs do during the game at what point does he step in and tell roman to wake the fuck up and stop running plays where the receiver is at the los on 3rd down when will he tell these guys to get to the line with more than 5 seconds on the game clock
oh shit hell yeah fuck yes
the nerve that fuckin asshole has to jinx the justin tucker
queen bwill
holy shit patrick got one
lets be thankful dalton is in dak would have fucking torched us
caribbean queen
they keep targeting harris
mah queen

dead we score a passing td
okay boykin
boykins 1 receiver
boykin getting some action lets go
i like that its a pass play and not some bs fluke qb run
action jackson
boykin here we go
thats my soulja

im talking about boykin baby
boykin more like wr1
this fucking game man we look bad but were getting off miracle plays
ravens throwing passes over three yards ill take it
i take back my previous post tucker just redeemed himself
i like that
tucker back on track
also that catch was harder than it had to be lamar thank you for finding the wide open boykin
feel that the way the shit clings to the air randy its already started my dear good friend the shit blizzard jim lahey
miles boykin whos that

lmao
hes boykintheendzone
boykin goated
big boi boykin
big players make big plays
lmao my dad said right before the snap alright time for a one play touchdown and i said nah not with roman calling plays
estimated prophet
boykin learned to catch
not this time andy
just saw dez in the rafters during the pan out hes gonna bungee in during the 4th
why is the d playing soft lots of room is being given
ravens wr1 seems to be the guy that plays in the slot specifically on the right side of the formation
a foot above is head is not high he caught it pretty easily stumbled on the run
their offense looks good
trick plays fuck us up too
just yeet it
man we gotta be the worst 3rd down defence in the league jfc
dbs getting their poop pushed in again today
wolfe putting work in the past string of games
our corners are just so frustrating
andy not looking terrible
even if dak didnt go down the cowboys d would be holding this team back so bad idc how many 400 yard games dak has that defense is bad
derek wolfe deserves a contract
our corners takes social distancing seriously bold strategy
run defense is there need the pass coverage to tighten up
if our defense doesnt stop blitzing this is gonna be a close game
wolfe has shown out last few weeks
did dean pees replace wink today
derek wolfe seems to be getting better w every game
bro what the fuck defense
bend dont breakunless its a close game
why the fuck do we constantly play 15 yards off on 3rd down
send a blitz and still get no pressure the ravens special
no pass rush and broken coverage perfect combo lmao
stop playing so far off for fucks sake
here goes wink blitzing like his life depends on it again

just hold em to a fg and dont turn it over in 2min
how is their oline a turn style on running plays but all day on pass d
ive always had this feeling that if you play us enough the average qb will learn our scheme and roast us apart my evidence the career of andy dalton
run defense looks really strong rn tho
drive was way too long for my taste
the only solace i can take regarding our defense is that dallas has really good wrs so im not too surprised theyre being productive
lmfaooooooo
thank god he whiffed
lmfaoooo
this game lmao
lmaoooooooo
haha at least tucker was close
wow not even close on that kick
so hard to kick in this stadium in december lol
ok i feel better about tuckers miss now
lmao what is this game
lmao dejavu
bruh moment
something in the air for these kickers
anything you can do i can do betteeerrr
that wind must be swirling s
lets feast boys
yeah that was blatant
lmaoooo
jesus that was egregious
aikman hates us lol
aikman what you jock the cowboys
we finally got a pi call
feed jk
jk fast af
these asshole announcers lol
jk
that was a you fucked my sister tackle
mans got rkod
dobbins is so freaking fast
lamar needs to call that qb guru on day 1 of the offseason lol
dobbins just did the zeke lmao
lmfao they destroyed willson

ball looked uncatchable but ill take it
can we pls get rid of aikman as a commentator
dobbins put on his fast boy cleats it seems
start this fucking man please
jk is awesome man
dobbins got wheels too
lets get 7 points
dobbins that speed
what do these announcers mean uncatchable and way over the heads of everybody hes a professional athlete he can jump and reach those arms over his head that was definitely at least potentially catchable which is kind of the whole point for why they throw the dpi flag when they tackle the guy before he has a chance to jump for the ball
troy take off the cowboy hat for even 2 seconds please
simply give dobbins the ball
maybe stop the clock harbs
run some hurry up and keep pounding
aldon smith really has awesome seats to watch this game
pound with dobbins
anyone else see jk shoot the cereal bowl over to the dallas sideline
i love the juxtaposition of 55 on 15 dudes like 3x bigger than hollywood
was it shocking was it now they are shocked he missed one when its like they jinx him every fucking week what is it yall want him to miss or make it
its amazing that other ravens receivers dont get pissed off watching marquise play more than them
thinking about how blessed i am that i cant hear the commentators for this one

is marquise brown better or worse than john ross lol discussing with my friend and being dead serious
is there a way that i can bet there being a flag on a special teams play because i feel like i can make some good money if there is
certain members of this defense just seem completely unwilling to tackle elliott just zooms past with no effort to push him out of bounds or tackle him at all the defender looked like he just assumed he was going to go out of bounds and as a result elliott uses his awareness and balance skills to make it probably 3 extra yards when he should have been pushed out of bounds immediately its getting really frustrating watching the lazy tackling effort
imagine allowing a score to andy fucking dalton with a drive that starts with 35 seconds left
wheres the pass rush weve gone like 8 quarters without a sack
our dbs are there to tackle after the ball is caught do we ever play man
shit them having to pass if take away the run may be bad for us
can they get a fucking stop
false start no
we have barely even made contact with dalton how is that possible
damn i thought marlo was gonna pick that when lamb slipped was an easy pick 6 if he did
how many times has averett changed his jersey number lmao
that was a nice tackle
lol
lucky
damn gifted
almost everybody on this field sucks tonight
we got away with two on that one
wow we got lucky
board just sent dalton to another dimension
they got away with a hold
big miss lol ill take it though
can we please put any pressure on the qb without blitzing

ill admit that was a bad no call in our favor
so our defense can stop big ben and the steelers offense basically twice but we letting dalton stand in the pocket with like 10 seconds and not gettin them off the field seems legit
super lucky to avoid two penalties there
well that was a freebe
yeah thats a bad missed call
defense got bailed out by the refs this time
lets rush 8
that was way closer than i would have liked it to be
we could have at least rushed 3 and hoped for a field goal before half
well were winning i dont have much else to say
damn that was too close
silence of the lamb
what the fuck is this defense doing
lucky he didnt catch that all our guys were just standing there
i love that the hail mary is well underway and buck is still bitching about a no call from the play before
all the years of 3 fly we played should make everyone an endzone hailmary god
does fox know this is a nationally broadcasted game no they dont didnt think so
why didnt we send a 3 man rush if dalton had to get that ball away quicker we could have had a shot at our own hail mary
at this point im not sure if we sign judon or yannick deffo not big money for either super weird situation to navigate after the year is over
up and down after these crazy last two weeks people sick w covid and no practice its hard to expect normal health and chemistry glad were winning
a td here would be incredible
i think fox likes the cowboys a little bit dont you
lets go second half hope we run it down with dobbins and gus
whose welch 57 practice squad
this team cant block a screen for crap
man i hate these behind the line of scrimmage plays
i like the play to duvernay put the ball in his hands and see what he can do
were gonna end up winning this game by 3 scores guaranteed
roughing the kicker
this is the makeup call for the missed hold
just not accurate enough
if your name isnt mahomes or rodgers no team wants to see their qb throw the ball with that technique
that progressive commercial was legit funny
run the first play pass the next two again greg roman can fuck off
nice pass rush guys
man the dl is rough
where is the pressure
complete embarrassment to our pass rush
how are we not stopping this fucking offense
awful spot no cap
these sidearm throws when they arent necessary really need to stop otherwise pretty happy so far only rushing 1 on the hail mary was stupid though
can someone explain how we are giving dalton this much time against a swiss cheese line
someone explain to me why our dbs are never in a position to make a play on the ball they just tackle

how did he get 3 yards on a qb sneak
78 wasnt holding
its for the best they had it on the first time anyway
our d line kinda sucks
the time of possession seems like its been so ridiculously lopsided in the cowboys favor
this defense is soft asf at times man
that one game we had a pass rush bengals game i think was nice
lmaoooo
anyone want to win this thing
bro
hell yes lmao were finally getting some bullshit luck going our way
whose ready to get bitched by the browns next week
gamea really buffer with prime smh
dude i need dobbins to just do a little more if he does a little better im the 1 seed in my league
more injuries great
man fuck this season im so sick of seeing our guys go down
pls ricard be ok
i love what ingram did last year and the impact he has in the lockerroom

but part of my soul dies every single time we start a drive with a handoff to him
now just run the ball until they stop it first second third down
where is earl thomas when you need depth at fb
harbs stop being a beta tell romans fat ass to put dobbins and gus in the game wtf
i have no idea why greg roman hasnt figured out that he needs to just pick a rb and stick with them
stop giving ingram carries
tucker 58 yarder coming up trust me
personally i would be feeding the ball to jk but what do i know
this offence yet again is so inconsistent its so stale to watch
everyone running iso routes no separation i really cannot fathom how harbaugh is okay with this shit
oof 1 for 6 on 3rd down now 2 for 7
no excuse for ingram to run anymore literally zero
just keep running lamar stop forcing the throw
rpo stuff isnt working anymore wish roman would stop calling it
i know guys need rest breaks but how do we not give dobbins the ball every play all he does is gain yards
im curious why there hasnt been as much of lamar juking people out of their damn socks this year last year it was like literally every week lamar was taking souls with jukes this year its more straight line running
dobbins all day thats why i call him dad
no offense to lamar but dont throw it again this game
masters given dobbins a sock dobbins is free
dobbins is the best ohio st running back in the nfl
another horrible throw
come on lamar wtf
another ugly ball
why does lamars passing look so much worse this season
lamar man come on
havent stopped dobbins once lets throw some mo
can we do anything well without penalties
terrible throw
wtf is wrong with lamar this year
lamar gets so mad everytime cause he didnt get a td from these runs
that throw looked a lot worse than it was i think

that looked like a pick in waiting if he had put it in the right spot ahead of the receiver
what are you guys talking about that window is almost non existant
lamar needs to accept who he is and stop trying to be something hes not im not saying he shouldnt throw just that he shouldnt have any pressure to
soulja
beautiful throw
lets gooooooooooo
woohoooo
heyyyyyyyyyyyoooooooooooo
lets goo road to redemption
thats 2 straight 3rd downs that lamar bailed out gr
soulja
theres a great fucking throw and a great catch thank you
perfect
yes
soulja time
soulja
lets goooooooooooooo
there we go lamar now do that every pass
all my boy hollywood needs is a good pass
lets goooooo
thank god great pass and catch
great play by brown
lets go mar thats our mvp
calculated good call roman
thats what hollywood can do just needed a little more confidence after some rough games hope this is the game that turns it all around for him
they all fools they just activated goat lamar for the rest of the season
team is starting to find its rhythm though it seems finally
the field been slippery tonight
make the stop
lets put geno stone in he played some db in college
omg the rnfl game thread is such a toxic place i mean its fun when its not your team playing but jc the lamar hate over their is real
this girl wants to fuck andy
we couldnt even get pressure by bringing the house
pass rush is a consistent problem every year
not being mentioned in the afc is old school lets gon
another blitz where no one gets close to dalton and he throws to a wide open receiver
okay but why the fuck we have averett on cooper
averett back like he never left
secondary is getting fucking cooked
fucking learn to tackle jesus
oh my fucking god just tackle
is malik harrison hurt why is board in there
we have no ability to stop them on 3rd down
holy shit thats embarrassing had 2 on 1
man this defense honestly is quite disappointing
i know theyve only let up ten points but this defense is atrocious
how do you let him get that first
what is with this defence on 3rd and 5
our tackling is so soft
short catch and run is killing ua
fort he is so good
nice play by fort
someone needs to drug test wink

blitzing humphrey there is malpractice
dalton is pretty solid as usual
a sack
what is this
i just really dont understand so much this season like weve absolutely blown up inferior lines this season even before we got yannick why are we getting nothing done in pass rush today
our prayers have been answered
a sack are those allowed
finally
yeah fucking sack lets gooo
god finally
well timed sack
omg a sack what is this
we remembered what a sack is cue anime wow
buy your lotto tickets
finally a sack
haddy
finally
yannick just snuck in for a half sack lmao
fucking finally a sack
hahahahahahahahahaha
clutch sack

and a missed fg is icing on the cake
bum ass
holy shit
holy shit lol
finally a sack
oh my god mccarthy wants his boys to go hunger games on zerlein
oof
wtf is that
holding my justin tucker extra close tonight
greg will be unemployed by breakfast
lmao 14 on fgs couldnt be my kicker
holy hell their kicker sucks
ye yee
holy fucking shit greg the leg is in fucking shambles
that kicked just lost his job
angry run
joe buck is just built different at jinxing kickers
this ones for you wft
big dick ric big dick shoulder
the hell is going on with our stadium today nobody can kick
i kind of feel bad for zeuerlein but i also dont
new day sucks
pat richard is our big body receiver
zuerlein committed to the tank lol
lets keep the bus moving
gus has been rising to the occasion
kinda feel for greg
cant stop wont stop
edwards is so good
imagine trying to tackle a 300 pound dude running full speed
lol ricard
25 made a mistake there
just walked home from the bar in frederick and we seem to not be shitting the bed anymore what happened boys
damn he trucked him
i feel for zuerlein
thats a big boi
gus edwards is shifty as hell
gus all day every day
holy fuck gus
my stream has fallen way behind but this thread tells me i have something to look forward to
miss seeing this last week
lamars game is on point today
gus bus 5 for 70 this shouldnt happen run him so much more the wheels on the bus dont stand still thats for sure
wow even ingram got a pretty decent run in there
dobbins doing the carrying gus coming in for the big gains and ingram coming in during the 4th quarter fresh no teams stand a chance if we can pull it off well and still make the account for lamar
line has looked good from what ive seen lamar looking back to himself god i hope this is a springboard game
put this in so i can sleep
dammit whats up with this redzone offense
he had dobbins early on that smh
lol harbs get contacts bro life is way better with hem promise you also lamar myl is s was wideeee
im gonna say lamar saw the crossing db and threw it in the dirt on purpose
lamars playing ok for a guy who has barley practiced problem is that a lot of these plays have also happened precovid
i think it was more miscommunication than bad throw lamar expected boykins to dive on it low
happy that lamar is running again but damn those missed throws are inexcusable most backups could hit that throw
after that rollout call

hey roman you know andrews isnt in the game right

roman what since when
ngl i almost shit my pants when campbell limped off and richard went down glad both are back in the game resuming my blackout now
dallas defense looks absolutely gassed punish mode engaged just let the bus go finish this shit and lets get ricard a tdthe man deserves it
is it just me or is the fake crowd cheering for the cowboys
these wrs are wiide open
3 times better than the steelers at this point
we have 250 rush yards on 30 attempts and were up 17 in the fourth quarter that were throwing at all other than the every four or five plays change of pace is absurd
holding in the backfield not called again wouldve been a sack
haddy might be a viable interior rusher
wow they made up for the original spot
another first down thanks to humphrey going for the ball instead of the tackle
are they finally gonna called the right tackle for the false start
i pray jimmy is healthy next week
hes fucking short
not fruit punch
what is a first down
thats not an opi
not marlon
not humph
even when shit goes right for us shit goes bad
be ok be ok be ok
i hope humphrey is ok but our defense is playing real dumb right now
maybe i am exaggerating but this is the best the offense has looked since opening day despite just coming off the covid list lamar looks just like i expected to inconsistent but running the ball has been amazing and the offense overall seems to be clicking a lot more
jimmy smiths presence is missed so much
update humph seems fine
the ref spotted him short then realized it was close so he gave it to him the refs in the nfl do that a lot
my mental health is not good already and now hump is down
marlo please be ok
damn that rocket mortgage ad had terrible acting
no no no no no no please be okay marlon
marlon stretching on sidelines wants to come back in we are okay
if marlo misses any time we done for
lol another embarrassment by averett
no facemask thats surprising
they are going after averette
i think ravens fans started loving marlon so much because jimmy was and is oft hurt but when it comes to playing corner and covering the best receiver on the other team i truly believe jimmy is the best of that description to play the position for the ravens
i mean what even is tackling though amirite
can we pls learn how to tackle
these singing competitions are asssss
honestly i would rather us bring back bowser over yannick bowser almost has it all together meanwhile yannick is just too inconsistent and is gonna want a lot of dough
did 73 help tackle his own man
thats as obvious as it gets on that hold
this defense has some really bad games this is one of them
that was a pretty nice play by elliott ill admit
wrap the fuck upits embarassing
lj fort came to play holy shit hes fun
yasss we picked it
why cant this team tackle wrap the fuck up
they just ignored that hands to the face
our defense blows today
wtf he waited an hour to throw the flag
of course its a flag
why defense do so bad
defense is concerning for next weekend
ngakoue so close there
review that please
why tf would you not challenge that
that was an int
what
bullshit call
wow that was a catch
cant do shit if these cocksuckers wont call holds
should have challenged
lol on knocking the ball out of forts hand
i hope they kick it so they can miss the fg again lmao
is that considered a pick even if the ball touched the ground after he was down
horrible call
wait wtf flashbacks to our bad ass final stand pls do this edit fuck yessss two games in a row

edit 2 fuck
yannick missed that strip sack by literally a couple inches
stout
stuffed
the goal line defense on this team does not quit
defense not breakinglets fucking go
bwil is huge
so stupid
get that shit outta here
why didnt they just throw on 1st lol
all that just to let amari be open
what a catch
a wr making that stretching play and toe tapping is what the ravens need
well give them enough times and theyll eventually get it wink better reem this defense out after the game
watch the onside or other special teams fuckery
offense needs to close it out
wtf is our coverage tonight
all that to let coop get wide open
if peters would ball hawk more than he fucked up id be cool with his missteps
inc 3 and out
bring back the burnt toast memes
these passing d needs to be fixed yesterday man
survive this game and regroup in practice

plz no fumbles on this next drive
aikman go run headfirst into a brick wall challenge
lol not even a question
lol wtf was dallas even looking at
wtf
haha nice try
shouldnt have been that complicated but ok lets wrap this game up
it was a catch but it doesnt make a difference at this point who cares
no shot dallas has that
yay more rushing yards
that was most certainly a pick tho
dude just give dobbins the fucking ball
if turnovers are automatically reviewed why not rule it a pick and let it get reviewed
we literally run the same 5 plays on offense
it worked but giving it to ingram there was dumb
we run woooooo i cant fucking believe it
game over
edwards is feasting
hell yeah nice run
omg ingram did something
gus edwards best game by far dude is actually making downfield moves what
well cowboys are bad
smart run by gus love it
ok who we thinking for player of the game
gus is a beast man
gus really is like a closing pitcher man hes a monster when you need time off the clock lol
good for ingram unfortunately that will get him more snaps lol
gus edwards lmao
these spots are pissing me off
if our offense was less predictable we would dominate like last y ear i mean we all knew gus was getting the ball there still 20
having fewer yards to go than enough to get 300 rush yards is sad to see
love to see a jk td
probably dont put lj in the firing line with the game basically over plz
pad those stats
ez
easy money
the hay is in the barn
yee fuckin haw
easy money baby
my fantasy team is pleased thank you jk
ez mune
damn why couldnt our covid game be against this team
oh oh were baaaaack
somehow the cowboys offense wasnt also the issue for them tonight
yannick cant even get dalton when hes uncovered dude needs to step his game up
deshon going full goldberg
nice hit deshon
lay the wood joker
really thought elliot was weddle for a sec lmao
dont love that the d is playing like they already won even though they basically have
gg boys
gg boys
jt gettin that royal farms money
why dont we hear john harbaugh is a special teams coach there its funny how they only bring it up on the special occasion that something goes right lol
i realized i just hate watching this team that they were gonna come out with a chance to put this away and instead go three and out with a miserable series was entirely predictable
lamar couldnt set his feet fully but boykin needs to come back for the ball
i hope we can get trace in for a bit
this defense still cant tackle
sign will fuller for the low next season
fuck joe buck forever
pollard almost got the 1st down because peters refuses to fucking make a tackle
hollywood is mr big waste of a draft pick
great throw lamar nice way to start the half
if you have positive opinion about lamar dont go on rnfl u will get downvoted to oblivion
that was bad fuck man
if we play like this next week were gonna be fucked by the browns and bye bye playoffs
i would like to point you to my comment in this thread 2 hours ago


here comes lamar


he aint played in two weeks be prepared for rust folks
we cursed now boys
was really looking forward to seeing dez throw up the x in all black on dallas

stupid covid
he was only around the entire team and hugging cowboys

nobody closeand now offhandedly blaming fauci lol liquor time
man the ravens look completely different than last year thought lamar was the next vick
shit throw shit effort it was a shit play all around
on the hollywood tip wasnt the best throw it its watch catchable if he used two hands and doesnt already begin going up field
i will gladly miss playoffs if it means romans ass is gone and we actually get a good fucking receiver for once that isnt 78 years old
seems like every time we throw it to the soldier its a int
thats not on dobbins thats blocking amd scheme
guys lets just be positive
greg roman needs to go this shit is embarrassing it isnt even the onfield shit its persistent pre snap penalties and nonsense wasted plays and free turnovers this offence completely relies on lamar just being better than everyone else there is 0 coaching
lol i know it worked but it shouldnt have thats the exact same fucking play gro always calls on 4th and short
we should be eating these guys alive theyre arguably worse than the jets
every time we score defense turns into shit and they drive effortlessly
refs always have been against us why are yall acting suprised
this would be a shutout with our 2019 team
why is marlon criticism so downvoted here
humphrey and dpi name a better duo
i usually get really heated and emotional during ravens games honestly tonight i just feel completely deflated and dead inside

last season i woulda been running around my apartment after that 37 yard run by lamar and yelling at our blown kickoff stoptd

tonight im just curled up on the couch with my kitty whos sleeping and i cant be bothered to wake her so im just sitting in silence no excitement no frustration just indifference numbness i know this is overly dramatic but im just so bummed by how this season and year is going that its hard to get my hopes up
what the hell is this play calling stop getting cute and smash them
lmao we are so bad with the fucking options run it up the god damn b gap you bitch
seriously lamars first and only read on that play was a fucking 2 yard swing route just seems so low effort
why throw it to the first read
gro can just fucking go suck a dick
this team is fucked
they literally always jinx him
why the fuck did you say something
joe buck is a fucking simp
and those jackasses had to jinx tucker
fuck you joe buck
i mean its hardly a jinx if they talk about his record literally every time he kicks eventually hes going to miss one and thats not a jinx not that theres any such thing as a jinx anyway
i actually think buck took satisfaction in calling that miss
this team does not and i have never been so certain of anything in my life deserve to be in the playoffs you cant keep dropping passes making inaccurate throws missing tackles missing blocks calling bad plays and getting penalty after penalty and be a playoff team its bad business we need a harsh reality check and draft position
i honestly cant believe there are so many comments blaming the fucking announcers that tucker missed come on yall
what a read and throw by lamar and credit to boykin for getting that open
lamar just lay it in their hands just once bb
dawg boykin almost fucked that up lamar was leading him forward lmao boykin kind slowed down in anticipation happy that worked out
looks like yannick doesnt want to get paid
shut the fuck up aikman
isnt it beautiful when we rollout lamar when his best target area is the middle third of the field
perriman brown
i hope we win for wfts sake they straight up balled out on pittsburgh
wtf how is that not dpi
bailed out
troy no one gives a shit have a coffee and a water during halftime
lmao woulda been such bullshit if ceedee actually got that
so if dez tested positive does that mean a bunch of the guys on the field will be going into covid protocol this week since im sure they had some contact with him
and of course we come out throwing in the second half
offense is still trash
marlon is straight up lost out there
rush getting exposed without judon
3 pass three and out anyone
hollywood fault he aint as good as dk or aj so thats why he couldnt catch that throw
and justice hill comes in to get them out of fg range and then leaves thanks fucko
lamars had some bad moments this game but i think im feeling a little better about him right now
ravens dbs and inability to tackle name a better duo
mvp jackson stop playing with that man
somebody needs check on dez

something aint right
imagine how fucking dangerous the raiders offence would be this year if amari never threw his bitch fit for the trade
i thought yannick was really going to make a difference here i actually dont even remember the last time we had a good pass rush maybe its only partially on the players
he had a man wide open
if we go up by 21 in the 4th do we let trace muthafucking mcscorely eat
man cant help but think that wouldve been a td with gus or jk
15 pass plays is good and bad
so boykin shouldve had close to 75 yards with 2td if lamar could just throw the ball correctly
pain
you guys will be fine youll win out
they just gave them hope man wtf
easy money
dont be doing no damn tiktok dances
we could see trace take a snap this game
mister biscotti i i dont feel so good
dont cry we never get any calls most penalised team in the league deserved
damn dude his throws are so bad
yo he almost didnt catch that
these announcers are getting on my nerves aikman is such a homer
dude again boykin wide open and he puts it in the dirt his mechanics are fucked
sorry lady but cervical cancers closer to your uterus than your heart s
tackling is dog shit this year what is harbaugh doing
shit throw
tucker kicking looks off so far ngl
this fuckin sub has been so irritating since the influx of post 2019 fans

anything less than a 300 win is a fireable offense to you guys jfc
not going to lie that was pretty fucking funny
how does hollywood not get 2 feet in there

hes so bad literally any wr in the league gets 2 feet in there regardless of the penalty
this offense isnt beating anyone in the playoffs if by some miracle we even make it

no wrs hollywood isnt doing anything special lamar has regressed badly with accuracy and touch for every good pass he makes 34 bad ones

roman fuck off
browns r gonna end our szn on primetime if we come out like this
rushing 1 person what a fucking terrible decision
if we had the chiefs playbook wed be way better at passing
lamar is miles worse than he was last year his mechanics are fucking shot right now you cant be an mvp qb and miss wide open receivers on 3rd down coaches need to be on his ass quite frankly
were the only fanbase with a franchise qb that gets mad when the oc calls pass plays

just be real deep down yall have serious doubts about lamar
the cognitive dissonance of this sub defending lamar for everything he does while also decrying roman every time we throw the ball sure is something
this dude yannick is a bum literally has been non existent all szn
we will not beat the browns playing like this next week
so trading for yannick was a waste that sucks i was hype for him pass rush is still more nonexistent than my life
how do you give them that first down god this front 7 is a bunch of pussies
you guys feel like this is a season changing game because i feel it is i feel it in my heart
what has happened between his mvp season and this season that has caused lamars mechanics to regress back to his rookie season we rarely saw these throws straight into the dirt and balls sailing horribly last season
i dont think we will but if we lose to the cowboys and andy dalton i will be have to take a 2021 break from this franchise
erin andrews isnt that hot
hmmmmmjustin tucker missed a measly 36yd field goal
this still doesnt redeem himbut hes getting their
wait

mls is about to play their champ game

shows how little i give a fuck about soccer lmao
i love this team fr but the ravens just never look prepared for primetime gamesthe narrative is starting to look like its real
even a wide open td throw looked strangely awkward and unnecessarily difficult
damn people flaming hollywood for something that wasnt his fault lol
realistically if baltimore loses this game does the conversation start about a coaching change be it head or oc
holy shit

wtf is going on
game should be canceled
first game in two months boot camp lets go bois
andy dalton is a cool guy but damn do i hate playing this mf
lol why run it on 3rd and 24
covid beat lamars ass
looked like illegal contact to me or holding something there was definitely some pulling on browns jersey and some contact with his arm as he was trying to make that catch
fire roman cut hollywoods sorry ass
really making the cowboys oline look elite
the qbs job is to get that ball within an arms length of the receiver any other top we can make that catch that wasnt on lj
i want a coach that can salvage lamar hes falling apart out there
dobbins touchs ball gets 15 yards wont be used again until the 3rd quarter fucking gro
honestly its whatever that dez is gone man dude wasnt going to turn this offense around and suddenly make us 2019 ravens again cya dez
this coaching staff needs to go
i think he did that same arm motion to the sideline that he did in the seattle game last year that was also a 4th and 2 and also was a lamar run up the middle for a td
i promise you there is no reason that we need to throw the ball more than 20 times this game please greg dont fuck this up
good call
i havent enjoyed watching the ravens since week 1
marlon is hit and miss
dont worry zeke will have a fumble eventually
being a ravens fan pain
yall acting like corners cant have bad plays chill thats his first td let up all year
yeah lets hurt these announcers
fucking trash announcers
these fucking announcers just killed my boy tucker i want blood
we dont have the offense for a comeback either
joe buck is a cunt
he almost overthrew a wide open boykin
theres no way this has ever happened before
who wants to lose more
hollywood is a perfect nickname for him and i dont mean that in a good way
this illegal formation stuff is a staple of romans offenses

however he has called an objectively good game overall
why is it that i keep watching our defenders this time it was averett hit or wrap up a guy but they still get another 3 or more yards before actually going down
why is that not a 10s runoff
oh so when a call against the cowboys is missed they make a huge deal but against the ravens they are silent
bailed out deshon elliot always getting burned when i see him i swear
why the fuck would just let them run out the clock send nobody on blitz fuck sakes
that damn sidearm shit
were lucky that the cowboys are awful
jimbrownwasaraven
ricard is someone we cant lose man
jk laying the wood on jalen smith
like lamar is a rb its not wven funny anymore
no excuse for this guys this is just shit qb play
yall was saying
keep talking sht about lamars passing guys i think its working just a little
not bad for for a 1099 plush toy on the clearance shelf
that draft kings chick has a head as big as a fat melon jfc
does wink not think adjustments are real
queen is looking good all over the offense excellent draft pick
oof he had a first just going up the middle
have the cowboys stopped a run for less than 5 yards more than once this game why the fuck we running empty on 3rd and goal
such a bad throw god dammit
shitty throw at least we dont have rg3 in though
all these outside the hash and sideline timing throws dalton is throwing just makes me wonder how good lamar could be sigh
phantoms pi
your up 17 with 5 minutes to go just see if you got it the hell
peters which game is this guy going to show up at
oh marcus what is u doin
if we have no pressure on monday baker is going to feast
mp half glass of juice ass mf
the defense needs to walk home tonight lol
these refs are definitely on the cowboys payroll
spectacular 0 yard run from lamar there
obj sounding off isnt quite a normal sight to be seen boy is quiet he must be feeling it tonight
happy to see lamar and souljah chatting
a win is a win but i wouldve liked to see some progress in the passing game lamar has taken a big step back this year
averett looking like some chaps pit beef good god hes ass
that a terrible throw by lamar though still shoulda been a catch but goddam what a bad 3 yard throw
were just a bad team lol its not that complicated
honestly being a ravens fan has been embarrassing
cd lamb wasnt catching that ball regardless of that hold
terrible play call by martindale didnt like that at all
i cant believe im saying this but we aint going to beat the browns playing like this
mechanics are fucked
anyone even average at throwing could hit that pass
diddid hollywood justrun a route
the fuck was peters dapping up the cowboys coach for
ooft that shouldve been picked

edit nah wouldve been a tough one
awful throw
trace mcsorely time
jimmy smith is the leader of this secondary when he is playing they look different
hey ingram got more than a yard and a half
soooo andy dalton going to end our season 2 times in the past 5 years hahahaha you really cant make this shit up
browns fan you guys are more than likely gonna win this game but do you guys think yous look off lately probably because of all the covid stuff but damn you guys looked like a different football team the first bit of the season also obligatory fuck the steelers
rare nice throw by lamar
does any qb get killed for their first inaccurate throw of the game the way lamar does
fake news dallas won stop the count we need a recount
hows life
that wasnt a terrible pass for a rb
i havent been this excited for 2 games back to back for a long time forgot the last time lol


i really really hope that he was incredibly careful today since his am test was inconclusive
how much we winning by tonight boys
poor dez he got the rona hope he gets recovered well even if he doesnt play ball for us
all i can say is at caramba
we fucking got this with or without dez

belee
lets go boys
demeatrice jr about to stunt on dem boys
lamar with covid is still faster than everyone
tit bit nippily tonight at the bank
why does zeke just look dirty
theyre going to run because its all they have zeke will fumble hopefully
what are the cowboys doing lol
what was that playcall by dallas
has a team ever played on 6 days rest four times in a row before we boutta do wed tues mon sun
and were still running with ingram up the middle for 2 on first

oh that motion with hollywood could be interesting i would love to fake the handoff to him and then fire it to him on the wheel if open
nice
why are we running ingram in the middle on first
rust
get mark out of the game
fluker looking real terrible
mother f
dont run backwards
just run the damn ball
what the fuck brown
not ideal
well shit
nice throw by lamar
dude
can we shit can gro already
seriously fuck brown bigger just that perriman
hollywood didnt even try for that
imagine calling yourself a souljia and being a soft little bitch game in and game out
embarrassing
why is the score 0 to 0
can brown fucking try fucking disgraceful
use two hands brown
hope this does not turn into a td
just jumped into the game someone tell me why dez aint playing id heard hes not
im still mad about that int from the terrible play call to the throw to wr 15 trying to one hand it
does anyone find it at least a little bit funny that the steelers wide receivers tip a million balls into the air and none of them get picked while ours always seem to fall right into defenders laps
dont use queens pic
todays the only game im not going to be able to watch in its entirety because i have leadership training

im somehow not as upset about that as i normally would be

jesus christ were tough to watch this season
bus
this is why i would be so hesitant to pay lamar if i was decosta the inconsistency scares the shit out of me
2nd and 3 is so different than 2nd and 9 please no more ingram
roman lets take gus edwards out now and give ingram 50 carries
if jk isnt 100 then give the ball to gus over ingram
i missed what happened with dez
loom what happens when we put in dobbins
why wasnt dobbins starting again
huh running gusdobbins works keep doing that and stop benching them roman
holy shit dobbins
and now we wont see dobbins again till the second half
if ingram gets another snap we should riot hes not good anymore
gus edwards has been our best hb for around 3 years what the fuck does he have to do to start
yes please read option
now lets give it to ingram for 2 yards
inexcusable thats the first we saw dobbins lol
better sit dobbins
bozeman has been so underrated this year
wowffs
is there a way to find out how many interceptions are thrown when targeting a specific receiver
time to take dobbins out
hmmmmm idk guys i dont think we should use this dobbins guy s
i hope we just run run run now
my man dobby
oh come onskura wearing a different jersey
jk hoffa
we love mistakes
what happened with dez
were cheeks
shura at it agian
our soulja
mekari trash
wheres that c from last week dude was a monster
seriously dobbins not being the main guy is the only example you need to showcase romans incompetence
jesus this fucking team is impossibly difficult to watch
if we cant score on the cowboys who have one the worst defenses ever i need to see a firing idc
luke wilson
oh wow hollywood fought for extra yards
if we cant beat this defense we cant beat any defense
lukeeeeee
guaranteed roman kills the run before the cowboys do
alright coach lets go for it
our offense was so good last year because we had an explosive running attack idk what happened but ingram just doesnt have it anymore literally every other back has it way more however
lamar gonna pick it up himself watch
if only lamar could play under center
omfg snap the ball properly
if we go for itbetter be dobbins
give it to dobbins
roman cut the shit with the cute passes for brown
were doing our best to screw this up come on guys shake it off
luke wilson for te3
run here
why what the fuck is the point in throwing to that useless piece of shit he cant juke or outrun anyone
hollywood is such a bitch man cant fight anyone off
the cowboys are beyond trash
dick fingers willson caught it
lamer is the goat
dial up a 12 yard pass concept on 2nd and 18 dont just call a fucking screen every time
hell yeah
hell yes
cowboys are so trash
word up
that was easy
nice
lj8 baby
lmfaoooooo lesgoooooo
lets gooooo
add it to the reel
how bout dat lamar
lets go
was that llamas longest run of the year
ilu lamar
just give it to lamar
lamar is backkkk babyyyyyyy
we missed you king
thats our quarterback
focus on rushing attack feels soooooo good
idec just run it we can have georgia tech stats for all i care just put ur head down and ram your way to the damn super bowl who cares
just keep running it
welcome back baby
how many yards was that
lmao dallas sucks
das my fuckjng quarter back bitch
and a competent oc
now lets see if our defense can show up against the fucking cowboys
the passing game is still a shit show but atleast that was nice
ffs
fuuuuck where is our defense
lol
i missed the starting offensive line up for the ravens when fox ran it is the oline brownbozemanmekaripowersphillips from left to right
why he running side by side with pollard
harrison and harris fucked their lanes
dogshit special teams
thats the kind of play we can make when the team were playing has to respect our other backs they bit on dobbins going to the outside granted dallas has a really bad defense but its good to see us play to our strengths
lets go d
what the fuck
lmao rip
figures
ugh
i see no pass rush
this team man
make that money dak
looks like were in for a rollercoaster tonight
god balls
damn it
marlo
sad noises
what is going on with our coverage today
oh come on
damn one of the worst plays ive seen from humphrey in a long time
this team is depressing
doesnt matter but how tf is that dpi
fuck off special teams
welp great job guys
fucking lol
the only way our offense can get yards is through fluke running plays and now our defense is looking like ass
dallas got scott farkus at qb tonight love the justin townes earle on the outro though
to any team in the nfc east were truly sorry lol
pass rush needs to start getting to the qb
fuck passing establish the run
lamar really needs to hand it off more often
lamar breaking more records
defense in the neutral zone his hand was past the fucking ball
marquis brown did a thing
ngl i highkey love tuesday night football
i understand we scored on that play but that is a disrespectful play call to our wideouts and i wouldnt expect any dc to call anything different
gus gus gua
yasss gus
bus
roman cant cook up a passing game at all
lol lets gooooo gussssss
mmmmmm inject that right into my veins
holy shit its like running the ball works
damn gus is good
gus bus keeps rolling
keep running the ball the cowboys rush defense is horrendous
good great grand get on the gus bus
where tf is dobbins
lets go gus
its almost like the bus should be kept out of the depot some more
this cowboys defense sucks so bad if we dont gift their offense points this shouldnt even be close
are the ravens running offense that good or are the cowboys running defense that bad
keep the defense out of shit spots run the ball this should be a bad night for dallas
im so glad im not a cowboys fan
run that fucking rock
okay fluker i see u
ingram with a long run did edwards slip on his jersey
big pancake by fluker there
stop switching the damn running back every play pls
get justice hill out here run everybody
lets not throw the ball all game seriously
play action now
ricard totally fucked up that play lol
has the speed option worked this year
we gotta keep running the ball
ummm keep it up the gut option hasnt worked much
sighhh
fake fg inbound
just tuned incan someone tell me how the cowboys scored turnover bad defense
why was hollywood so slow off the line there
right call but i think the defense made that call
im kinda shocked it wasnt fluker i would have had him to get a penalty first
pain
welp fucked er boys were losing to the cowgirls
fucking christ can you curse us more
gotta be fucking kidding me
what the fuck is going on
fuck joe buck
well shit
i came in to this fully expecting a loss
my mouth actually droppee
lol
no way
cut tucker
fucking hell
why god why
im beyond tired of this team beating itself
shake it off defense has to come up big here
yeah man
fucking garbage announcers
that fg is good from 31

fuxking penalties this year
this is the second time this game we were jinxed the first time they praised humphrey before their td was thrown to his man absolutely cursed
well this is less than ideal defense has to step up now
i think this team has some voodoo shit on it because its just not our year
nobody cares work harder
so tucker short kicked it and they couldnt cover costing field position now he misses not his day
getting 2012 afc championship vibes
announcers mention that every time tucker kicks its notthe announcers fault he missed hes a fucking human its abig surprise i know but he is not a robot incapable of missing be happy he is human thats what makes him so awesome
chose the wrong month to be sober from alcohol
tackling continues to be atrocious
lol this game is going well its been the same shit in every loss since the chiefs and the 2nd steelers game bad play calls small mistakes penalties let the other team hang around and then we choke
learn to tackle pls no offense but damn
but fr koch called for the snap on the false start right why didnt cox snap the ball
dobbins is the best rb on the team and they barely use him
whos 33 i remember thinking he looked solid last season
defense heard me
lol it kinda feels like everything that could go wrong is going wrong with this team sad times
please tell me its a pick
lets a forced turnover here fruit punch time
idk if he caught it i hope so lol
i think that hit the turfi hope not
awwww yeah
ok now we redeem
dolt on
finally dammit
well theres a fucking break at least
patrick queen droy
yassssss queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeennnnnnnnnnnnnnn

needed that
droy
cant wait to waste this opportunity
nice catch
big fucking boykin
lets gooo
cowboys secondary making boykin look nflcaliber
nice

tucker missing the kick was actually good for us
there we fucking go bois
lets go myles now thats a soulja bench that bum 15
killa queen bites za dusto
lmaooooooooooooooooo
well that was quick
fuck yeah boykin
more of that yes
lamar is back in so may ways
wow this game is a rollercoaster
lets turn this game around boys
lets fucking go boykin
lets go
we should score at least 40 this game lol
was that the spark we needed
lets fucking goooooooo
that was fast
dallas took our memes about not needing to cover boykin literally
boykin lets fuckin go buddy
lve is getting fucking cooked today
now im happy tucker missed
we just need special teams and defense to not shit the bed here
tucker 88d chess easy w
oooo that ball was close to coming out
ferguson chopping to get edge contain on the reverse and then looked surprised when they actually came over there lmao
opi
zeke ingram
corners dont look interested in playing tonight
awooooooo
peters giving me a fucking ulcer with the soft coverage
how is dallas moving the ball on us
what is this soft ass coverage
our pass rush sucks
if its thrown underneath at peters youre going to catch it
why someone always open
how does he get that wide open
why the fuck is everyone wide open
ginger picking us apart
lack of pass rush there was awful
secondary what is you doin
just give him the first down clowns
from scrimmage to 1st down there wasnt a single body in the zone
fucking get to dalton god damn
no pressure no coverage is a bad combo
send everyone and let receivers have 7 miles of room
this pass rush has been so so bad this game their offensive line has somehow been worse than ours this season and we still cant get any good pressure
is it too much to ask for both sides of the ball to play well
i love the man defense i do i like its accountability but teams are roasting us in it because of the cushion peters gives its not a dig at peters but we need to adjust to cover that problem
okay was it man or zone if its man its averett if zone its someone else
every pass is a first down play closer holy fuck
mcphee has been great tho
stop sending safety blitzes
peters almost let pollard go to get the first down it looked like there or it looked a lot closer from that camera angle
holy fuck just please blitz peters he sucks in pass coverage rn
seems like our defense is just pushing guys and they stay on their feet what happened to tackling
we cant run over the cowboys ol who full of janitors and shitty club bouncers
need man press coverage these soft coverages dont work
whats up with our defense why is it so trash
lol holy fucking shit
two minute drill lets get some points

desperate ass pi
dobbins wtf get to the bench bro

hell of a run make another tkd happen i know you can do it
that speed holy hell
jesus what a throw again
dobbins is low key our best weapon
dobby
dobbins has speeeed
that was the first pi call that went our way this year
hell yeah dobbins
that play should have been a pass
troy aikman and shitting on the cowboys name a more iconic duo
wow hollywood got him one
every fucking game
smh
does harbaugh know what a legal formation is
theres my tucker
tucker back on track
love the grateful dead outros
just lol

we
f i r e d
whats up with all the dead phish
well we actually arent playing that bad and i know its dallas but damn im kinda impressed
just one game without 1 illegal formation penalty just once please
we cant really hang out with real friends either miller
watching the twitch stream is it just me or does the stream die every time it comes back from commercials
couldnt make that call on the big return
idk what just happened but ill take it
i havent paid much attention to him which is a great thing but harris has been great so far
i thought they were going to call that foul on us for the tackle lmao
lamar lookin like darth vader with that big coat on the sidelines
we better not give them 3
swiss fucking cheese
so this means roman will now just bench dobbins for the second half right i mean who actually wants to win games that sounds risky s
great tackle
theyre gonna get three here arent they
fucking come on defense
where the flag for the block in the back wtf who else saw that the right o line is doing some fucked shit

bowser getting steamrolled into the ground backtoback
hahaha this really is funny when it happens to the other team
what is elliott doing
deshon elliott is still a liability in coverage
lolololol
wowwwwwwwwwwww

we are getting soooo lucky defense getting bailed out

tipped pick uncalled dpi lamb slipping zurlein missing fg
we better not give up the hail mary here
aside from all the slop were playing a good game but we gotta pull away
i think our wrs are fine but i wonder is it more david culley our passing coordinator than greg roman is he the one that designs the pass plays wasnt he the one responsible for that 1 year that no wrs on the chiefs scored a touchdown
joe could throw a 20 yard out route on a dime but couldnt throw that screen like that lmao
holy shot can we please rush it
lol
since that was boykin we will excuse him had that been brown fire him on the spot
if were gonna throw when we shouldnt be can it at least be play action ffs roman
i get the run the ball sentiment but if we cant even complete two passes for 6 yards whats the point
yikes horrible throw from lamar but uh why are we passing

how often does greg roman need to be reminded that hes in charge of the 3rd ranked rushing offense playing the 32nd rushing defense
lol this team cant set an edge to save its life
all of the star players in the nfls commercials have the nerdiest voices lol
i drank a whole cup of coffee on that down
ffs dude basically had time to take a nap in the pocket
lmao 3 clear holds i get missing one even 2 but 3
wtf is yannick doing
no pressure again
my entire life is a lie about what is actually a first down
im getting bored can we get another turnover
can we please cover the receivers daltons got all day cuz the blitz isnt working
here comes the d forgetting to tackle and not playing with heart happens every week
where is yannick ngakoue
i just want one game where we play a complete game feels lien when the offense shows the d is gone and vice versa
this pass rush is awful
campbell wtf
we really need to be dominating the los the skill position players they have are among the best
lol
need some rofo coffee
bum ass
lol dalton with the moon ball attempt
got that buck luck
jay glazer face
fuck everything
well this drive is over already
oof
ricard took a hard helmet to helmet and fell after the playdid not look good
why did he keep that dobbins had daylight
nice lemar
first down steelers
thank you
what happened to ricard stepped away for a second
i dont think weve run a single play action play since it opened up a long touchdown for boykin thats malpractice
time to bench dobbins ffs roman youre such a clown
dobbins all day
roman in the game thread confirmed
ingram would have gotten 1 or 2 yards on that
dobbins balance is amazing
dobbins win
this is like the dean pees defense under utilized and horribly schemed
wtf
how dominate the cowboys spam jk and gus
jesus fucking christ dude
annd fucking self destruction
fucking hell lol
god damn it justice
gotta go to work
bad throw and hesitation
why is justice hill playing so much gus and dobbins are both beasts we should be playing them as much as possible
lamar waiting for the lb to move and he didnt then threw it behind thats not great
why does lamar hesitate its like he has been taught to not trust his instincts
thank god for lamar hes so fast
its still weird watching games with no fans lol
our entire offence just relies on lamar being a better athlete than everyone else imagine what he could do with coaching and a modern day passing scheme lol
damn lol
in madden this would be referred to as a qb draw cheeser
at this point we should just borrow the navy playbook we have a great running game and a great running qb but we cant throw
yeah he missed hollywood but it also was a bad read on the play because once he doesnt throw to brown right away hes supposed to go to his next guy boykin who was more open
throwing optional
there we fucking go
damn that boy is fast
ahh fuck yes
dime
what a theow
the real souljah boy
biiiig play
good thing were playing the cowboys lmao
everyone been slipping on the grass tonight
bruh that returner almost fucked his blockers ankle
what is up with our substitutions
yannick cant get one sack against this beat up o line
he leaped out like spiderman and got ragdolled
wide fucking open
why tf are they giving the receivers so much room
stop fucking blitzing holy shit
sheesh
youd think if we were gonna get no pressure we would at least cover
andy dalton actually looks pretty good i mean that as both a compliment to him and disrespect to our d
averette got worked man
were never going to get another sack the rest of the season are we
why do we insist on sending the fucking house every play leaving our corners out to dry tonight
just overall terrible refs this year i wonder why how does the training program in the nfl work
offence hey we got a lead
defence its the 4th quarter time to take that away
im just hoping for a zeke fumble on this drive
board really screwed up there biting towards the sideline
fort gotta secure that
no business getting that first
here we go
any injury updates
what was that song
defense has no excuses today offense ran for 200 yards they had plenty of rest
finally a sack
took long enough yahea boy
yes
yes
finally
a sack whats that
ohhhhh holyward
their kicker is some ass
mccarthy is just a shitty coach lol how do you keep sending zuerlin out like that
heh
lul
actual coverage by the dbs leads to a sack who would have thunk
mccarthy gonna have an aneurysm with all these missed fgs
zuerlein lmaoooooo
zuerlolien
cowboys kicker needs to be fired lolololol
i feel bad for greg the leg
damn
run the ball with every back we got
wtf is going on
damn their kicker is going to have nightmares about this field
yall the cowboys defense is 9th with dalton mccarthy is still decent as an offensive mind were not getting sacks cause mccartney is good enough at offense to take advantage of that in the past game thats fine matchups happen everything else hes been awful at cause were sweet
great stop d now lets put this game out of reach
damn nice hit lol
he needed a spanking lol
ok pat
weird ass kick
god damn
buss it
thats a big boi

gus bus
i thought zurelein was good i mean i dont mind the misses but 3 misses is surprising
i get so hard for some good fb play
god damn
damn edwards
woods went horizontal lmao
another greg that people are calling for to be fired
can we trade zureline 2 misses to erase jts miss and pretend neither has happened
legatron is batting 0250 on fgs tonight
now thats a grown man
how tf did lamar get all the way down there that fast to celebrate with gus
kinda tired of these announcers acting like the cowboys even want to be in the playoffs its a wash for them its fine what can you do when dak goes down
needs to be 60 40 dobbins gus
edwards lookin shifty this game lmao
just put gus in the ring of honor honestly
gus bus
i love how gus cuts
that cut
wasnt a hard hit but id still prefer if he didnt take those
oof
what was that play call
has roman ever heard of a dive
g u s

b u s
hammer it up the gut young fella
3rd and 3 why are you throwing
edwards and dobbins are 1 and 1a
did we sign ingrahms nephew or something who the fuck was that
lets fucking go
gonna be trace time soon
he was trying to shade boykin away from that safety
chalkdust torture
lamar shouldve thrown that td
these routes are cancer
so we rest lamar now next week we definitely have to choose our poison baker played great on sunday yall think he can replicate
throw it on a dime time
its a pretty wild week in football when im in the gdt defending lamar
thats a tough catch and throw to make
pressure
averett sucks when playing teams based in texas
first 00
just need 50 more rushing yards for 300
can we not
fuuuuuuuk
ah fuck
ahh dammit
pls no
not fruit punch
more injuries
please
i wish our offense could run combacks and out routes
weve won but at what cost
fuck pls not marlo
hump seems fine
tackling drills all week in practice chubb and hunt will chew us the fuck up with these arm tackles
averett

again
averett again
tackling meeds work too many missed tackles
so if i was playing the ravens id just spin my way to the end zone doesnt seem to difficult
what the hell was bowser doing
come on defense fuckkk
why is our defense playing like crap
i never see commercials unless its football season damn tv looks awful
wtf defense wtf refs
zeke is good at football
wow some garbage tackling there
the day the ravens start being able to finish tackles were gonna start winning some games
bad tackling has been an issue
ravens never get holds
clear hold
another hold hes fuckin choking fort
that wasnt hands to the facefacemask on fort wtf
clear hold again
what the fuck man
goddamn we havent been able to tackle in the 4th quarter for like 6 straight games now what the fuck is wrong with this defense every week people come at me when ask this same question the answer is theyre exhausted because the offense sucks i mean maybe the offense has largely been underwhelming but its still an inexcusably bad job of tackling
thats an illegal shift they had two guys move and didnt get set
the hold
i know averette has had a rough night but who would you rather have him or bonds
averett might need to miss time again lol
respect for the effort fort
i love our 4th quarter defence soft as fuck and play with no heart
averett saves the day
so many fucking holds
me too troy me too
facemask on fort and no call great
is dalton just throwing to whomever averett is on
you guys calling out averett lol who do you want in someone from the xfl
fucking challenge something harbs the fuck
lmao you cant play defense anymore man
that was an int
weak call
aa for the save
people can dog lamar for missing a few throws all you want but defence has been holding us down big time tonight
softttt
that was a great play by averett
bend dont break
yannick did very well hitting zeke
ball dont fucking lie
jesus christ man
welp
peters got ghosted
good d peters
dammit peters wtf
without that ultra soft holding we wouldve already been off the field gotta love it
peters got toasted
and then our weak ass secondary give up the td
how do you get so wide open in the damn endzone there isnt a whole lot of room
peters got shook lol
free
we playing like the game is over wtf
keep the phish outros coming i feel like a llama encore after this drive
this defence has been off tonight but reminder that was the first full drive of the game by the cowboys a fumble for 3 and a long return set up for the other 7
how do you hum belee dat
i knew when dalton was gonna pass it was gonna be a td pur secondary has been terrible
lol
clearly our ball lol
huh lol
run the clock and kick a fg
time for a ride on the bus baby
this is just another one of those games against an awful team that shouldve been a blowout
are the cowboys high wtf
alright we cant do shit about that pick can we move on please
these refs have been the absolute worst tonight on that last drive alone there were multiple holding calls they should have and didnt call they gave them a first down on an awful spot they didnt call the int it was just atrocious that was an int but on the 4th down td there was for the 20th time tonight no joke holding that they again didnt call
rare bad decision on the keep
yo why the fuck is gr calling plays where lamar is running right now greg you stupid fucking idiot let the rbs run and waste time dont risk our god damn qb
stop getting cute and just run up the gut
i really want them to take out lamar and put in trace to ice the game cant risk any injuries in garbage minutes
just run up the middle its like we want them to get the ball back
the giants defense is legit as hell good thing they have no offense at all
dallas has an extremely slow front 7

shocking tbh
great job gus edwards
if we lose to colt mccoy in a couple weeks im done lmao
gus is built different
thank goodness we won this one we need marcus peters to play better more pressure from our front 7 and to run the ball on offense from the start instead of trying these gimmick passing offenses for the entire 1st quarter

season isnt over
gus bussss
i fucking love our rbs and i love our backup oline
stop running lamar
the wheels on the gus bus go round and round
that stretch run has killed the cowboys all game
gus is having himself a grand ole day
doublem up
easy money
eazy money
do they have extra flags for special teams tonight the shitz getting wild
maybe michael irvin will give the boys bench the emotional support dog
sidelines are always open
good guys win tonight
averett is such ass
oh averett
pog pog pog
is lamars mask upside down
no stop the hugging
sooo glad brandon scott won and not gift card sheila
so he scores a touchdown and he the best in the legue makes a bad play and he sucks make up ur mind ppl

seriously tho lamar is a good qb and we need to stick with him good and bad moments
this sub run the motherfucking ball you morons


runs for a 1 yard gain into the line

why are you running the ball
lmao thinking about when people were like harbaugh coached teams get better in novemberdecember
how did he win mvp when he cant throw the ball
hes gonna make it anyway can we save the theatrics lol




wow
lamar looking really fucking good tonight ive been hard on him all year but hes definitely looking mvp form tonight
we need a solid defensive back so bad
we dont deserve playoffswell just get carved up by any team well face
they are abusing averret like my dad abuses me s
so lamar scores 1 td and has another 37 yard td pass and yall want his head for a bad pass that luckily didnt get picked yall turn on this man quick
bad throw felt like he couldve ran
yall are hilarious saying cut all these players and the 1st quarter hasnt even ended yet
yall are fucking blind if you think anyone was catching that ball that was a piss poor fucking throw thats not even debatable lmaoo
here goes dalton for 7 before half time
i get it the ingram had a couple of off games but you motherfukers are crazy saying he shouldnt even have a job anymore seriously take a step back and think about what you do for a living and how that gives you any qualifications to be calling football plays or signing contracts for players seriously what the fuck is wrong with you guys


edit and im not saying hes playing well im just saying you guys are fucking ridiculous
marquise breshard perriman brown cant catch a 10 yard out but pulls that shit in
peters has looked very ehh to me most of this season hope he can pick things up
wow averett really is some burnt chicken for a 4th 5th string cb you dont expect much but it seems like hes getting beat every snap he plays
day what you want but i feel so lucky to be alive to witness patrick mahomes play football goddamn
theres no way they can play this now right
is lamar playing tonight
shit defense is already looking bad
were not winning this game if we cant tackle again
lol im not worried at this point but id honestly rather play vs prescott than dalton
tackling is not looking good so far
roman is so ass man
catch the ball ya dingus
he went down so easy after that interception brown is such a pussy
why are we passing so much against the worst run d in the league our scripted plays are shit why isnt dobbins in on the scripted plays dobbins and gus thats the focus fire roman
dez wanted so badly to get back and play you test positive and you sit out for 10 days and you come back to play if you wanted it so badly

sit there and fuck off then sounds like you didnt want shit but a paycheck
that was excellently designed by roman nice blocking scheme
fyi this game is being streamed on twitch if you want a better quality stream and less lag time
just gonna ignore that offensive holding again
jesus marlo is about as inconsistent as fucking lattimore
marlo wtf
please never let ingram touch the ball again i dont care dudes washed its football he can dance and cheer on the sideline
pound the rock now because we know greg will pot a stop to that in the 2nd half
ok ingram got them wheels
me waiting for roman to bench dobbins
roman will run the ball chill yal roman deserves some hate but he is still partially responsible for the best offense we have ever had and the best running offense ever
i feel like planned lamar runs never work they have to be spontaneous
wtf was that 3rd down was hill the primary receiver
freakin a man quit jinxing us
joe buck rides troys dick every night
that honestly looked good to me
just had to pop in to say lmao what an announcers jinx
joe buck is and always has been a sub par announcer
i watch football to take a break from the stressful work life this team makes me wanna die
tucker gonna lose his title to younghoe koo
john is losing this team right in front of our eyes
hahaha this is the same old ravens wow just wow play calling is the same lamar has some off throws run game is working but then again this is cowgirls its starting to look real bad brownies are gonna kick our butt
some of you are fucking retarded


could it be that he missed because he had to kick two field goals in less than a minute one 5 yards more than the other no its the guys in the booth
lamar cant throw
so two of the most bashed player queen and boykin just came up big lol
i like deshon a lot but he needs to learn how to tackle
i must be the only one on here who rates joe buck and troy aikman although it may just be because we pretty much never get fox commentators for our games its a nice change from the usual cbs suspects
seriously brown is not good
lol 161 yard rushing is more than some team have had in a game all year and people still complain madness
was that decosta on the field
such a change to see opposing penalties and im so here for it
these commentators love giving sloppy toppy to the cowboys
mccarthy very dumb
fundamentally this team is so flawed i dont know where to start lol the poor tackling constant illegal formations false starts dropping easy passes
i think it was the right move to risk a holding call or pi to save the td but it shoulda been called
we need yanda to come out of retirement and go back to 3 te sets i love dobbins but man why would you throw out a winning formula that allowed us to have a historic recordbreaking year and made lamar mvp
yall thirsty
fuck duvernay had some space gotta accelerate quicker
boykin is clearly tired of playing in the nfl
wheres urban to talk to him about his throwing technique
as an outsider can someone tell me what changed with the ravens this year vs last
i was on a work call the past hour whatd i miss
i dont want to pay yannick or judon they both suck
why are we always in the pistol i miss play action instead of this option shit
all the time
wide open
you dont gotta be a lamar hater or a doubter to know that hes not a good thrower this year pedestrian at best for every 1 good throw this year he throws about 8 very bad ones

yeah i know hes reigning mvp but that was based on last year

something is very mentally blocking him
he started to come then he pulled out
at what point will these coaches realize they throw at averett every play
not a fan of deshon elliott
why is dez bryant saying hes going to quit
we really need to draft a new cb
peters got burnt but wow what a catch
peters sucks at least for what he is being paid the guy cant tackle and cant even guard right what a disappointment
man i do not think thats a pick i dont think he got control before his leg goes out of bounds
they cant even put on masks right
is it shitty to breakup with someone a week before their birthday
fuuuuck you joe buck fuuuuuck you chris collinsworth suck it you cowboy cuck little bitches
and now we have to watch lamar throw another pass again

you guys are way too afraid to criticize lamar that throw was up and away even joe buck said it
bad play for the i hate doom and gloomers ugh crowd
hollywood brown isnt good a receiver thats 59 isnt a 1 guy thats a slot receiver and speedy receivers are only good for going deep and if his qb cant hit him that deep then hes useless and im sorry lamar sucks at throwing deep unless its against garbage teams
you guys gonna bitch about how much refs hate the ravens now
im glad they didnt look hard at that td because im not entirely sure that ball didnt touch the ground when he landed
wasnt hollywoods fault bad throw
why couldnt the ravens draft lamb
why are we passing the ball
for a 66 guy it barely went over his hand there if he jumped he might have had a chance
still dont like 15
some of lamars misses i literally do not understand

im sorry but even a college qb would not have thrown that pass into the dirt what in the world is going on with him
this team aint winning a playoff game if lamar continues to play like this this is not a sustainable runpass ratio
elliot has regressed twice as much as than lamar this year
hate to say it but our secondary has been really bad for several games no one is ever in a position to make a play on the ball
a quality receiver would have pulled that one in
lamar has been bad this game
lamar is just a better running version of tim tebow
if any other qb had passing stats as horrendous as lamar this season theyd be flamed the fuck out of why do we keep giving lamar outs
me after 3 minutes we are who we thought we were
lol get ready yall pass calls from here on out from our main man gr
the announcers man
fucking aikman
roughing the passer
man the key board warriors are out tonight
roman is the only coordinator in the history of the nfl thats directly responsible for every missed throw and bad decision that his qb makes
lamar cant throw wtf now the 4th string rb gets a penalty
some of you guys are insane you can not blame greg roman when the wr was wide open in the end zone
marlon is a beast
idk if he had control with both legs in
punk ass weak defense
wonder if dalton is gonna get killed for that bad throw
effort our team lacks it loads of talent no effort
it was one pass
you guys are as bad as the announcers
that was a bad throw yall really never give it a fuckin break take off the purple goggles
boykin looked like he dives and gets that
4th quarter defensive breakdown incoming
man i know its going to be unpopular to say in this thread on this sub on this night but i legitimately like baker i wish he wasnt on the browns
we need to cut hollywood ingram and greg roman

we need to shop peters and maybe clark just to see what we can get
patrick queen is such garbage i know ill get downvoted for this
its trace time
holy shit theres no such thing as jinxing shut up lol
lol this sub saying marlo is a top corner is laughable hes just physical he has a big dpi every game i get downvoted everytime i say it im downvoted but top corners dont get targeted
that is the first bad throw of lamars game cut him some slack
browns going to embarrass us next week this team just isnt it this year
i will say this the moment special teams starts to goof is the moment where i move on from harbaugh thats his niche and theyre giving up big returns only hell knows what else is going on

why do we have 4 rbs active when dez has shown to be productive lol
wow

take notes hollywood
our season is fucking over there are so many people i blame but greg roman is a good start

and also hollywood can we stop drafting fucking rookie wrs and just get veterans
im not entirely sure how the upper management works does decosta have the power to fire harbaugh and roman with out owners approval
yeah if lamars going to play like this going forward we can kiss the playoffs goodbye

whatever going 1 and done again wouldnt have been productive anyways
wtf dez
is the game not on cbs all access this week
dont check out twitter dez fans


he just gave the middle finger to the ravens and said he quits

shouldnt have thrown that
our o line is not holding up
and thats why dez bryant spent so long as a free agent mystery solved
we should literally not throw a single pass all game
why the fuck is marlon in zone wtf
it looked like 40 completely gave up his lane
its gonna be one of those games boys
hey look at that out of the back of the end zone tucker just needs to do that i k ow they told him to make it returnable
better not let bad them stay close for too long we can lose just like the seahawks steelers
pass is caught

exhilarating commentary
called it
its a missed fg in the 2nd quarter it sucks but take deep breath everybody
your guys expectations on this team is too high were at best going to get bounced in the wild cards lol
fucking zero pass rush terrible
why is the defense getting so exposed
bad luck buck
how was that not a catch
it wasnt even catchable
y u no run
averaging 5 ypc with 4 yards to go and we decide to air it out
of course it doesnt look like a good spot to you joe
campbell getting worked
i did not realize brown was such a tiny dude jesus one solid hit from someone and that little man is going to be in a world of hurt
are we good again
these refs are awful on both sides
i feel like this is one of those games that is going to show too much to other teams down the stretch for no reason and bite us in the ass in a game that matters
ill forgive it because were ahead and it might be rust but if lamar can make those throws next time thatd be great
no no no no no no
were so fucked if marvin is out for any length of time
dez tweets yea im going to go ahead and call it a quit for the rest of the season i cant deal with this then he says im coming back this season or next season is unclear wtf
losing marlon in the fourth quarter of a blowout would be just perfect for this season
anthony is trash
nasty release
ehh didnt like that playcall
is harbaugh on the hot seat
lamar should not keep the ball anymore come on man
our oline has been way too fucking shit this szn for brown jr to be talking shit like that lmao
mike mccarthy you coward
a free 3 points for the cowboys because lamar cant throw and hollywood cant catch so awesome
humphrey contract is starting to look interesting
be thankful ur playing the santa fe school for the blind
peters went from a great trade last year when we should have won the sb to absolute trash this year and a bad pick up
cut hollywood chris moore boykin fluker let judon bowser ellis ward all walk man

this team has no top end talent and no heart

we need real players ready to make impacts
i thought harbaugh had a special teams background

was harbaugh not an expert on special teams

what happened



what a joke we get flags other teams get 50 yard returns
fuck this kicker get him off the field he is clearly the worst ever
wasnt the best throw but thats wrs are for bailing out the qb good shit boykin
say what you want lamar hasnt look this bad in a while post covid games looked rough for newton and trevor lawrence im concerned if this is normal but these many misses arent anywhere close to his normal
if lamar throws this ball one more time this game i quit
our receivers could at least try to jump for it
were gonna get killed
removed
defence ready to blow this one another classic ravens loss
mcsorley time
peters is probably a net negative as a player overall
if legatron hits any fgs we lose this game fuck this team bring on 2021 we wont beat anybody if we somehow make the playoffs
trace
lol they just said how hump was amazing player lol powned
instead of wasting our picks on yannick we shouldve traded for jamal adams
this is a super bowl caliber performance
were ass
opi
awful call why call a screen when we are gashing the ground game
no way this is happening no way were this bad i just cant believe it i was so excited for this season
thats grounding yo
lamar out here throwing ducks tonight but also making the plays he needs to thatsmyqb
averett shouldve stayed on ir tbh
smh but he wears the green dot
secondary is getting exposed
secondary is so clueless tonight
lamar jackson is a elite running back
no pressure at all yannick is a bum nice to see marlon lay down now that he has that contract
lamar through that pass to hollywood a bit back too late the average nfl qb hits that 85 of the time face it guys lamar is average at best at passing
erin andrews always brings the sexist creep out of me

just tuned in surprise surprise playing like trash

lmao at the downvotes delusional homers
steelers fan her and i come in peace just read through the bleacher report game thread tonight and there are a lot of lamar haters tell me
ravens fans why do so many of you hate him i would love to have him in my team
dez out for the year

what a pussy
receiver fault
over under well go three and out with the palys being

1st down pass for 1 yard or incompletion

2nd down run ingram inside or dobbins outside for 12 yards

3rd down over throw to open wr after lamar is flushed from pocket

4th down average punt from sam koch because we cant admit hes lost a step a little bit with age
two terrible passes in a row and yepint

marlon getting called on everything this season he got away with it a ton last season and its catching up to him he is not lockdown anymore
removed
is justin tucker hurt he cant kick touchbacks and his fgs have looked weak

edit there it is i was wrong
we have to use our 3 timeouts here
hollywood is still not good i would need to see plays like those consistently to think otherwise
hes still only holly until he cleans up his otherwise shitty play
our olb bowser getting lifted off his feet ugh
i really want the steelers in the playoffs

dont throw lamar
bad throw by lamar but he probably has a little rust
if we win this will it put us on top of the afcn
calais washing up rn
what are these awful crossing routes dude i really want us to lose out no talent on either line or at wrso maddening
he almost fucking missed that
these guys are too happy for beating a trash team
was thrown high but boykins job with his height is too jump for it
ok im honestly not trying to be pessimistic but why tf did boykin look like he was jogging is he really just that slow the man literally never shows any sense of urgency
andy dalton is going to beat the ravens lmao
dez gets covid potentially spreads it to the team and leaves great signing
cleveland is going to eat this team and end the season monday
who woulda thought that maybe you shouldnt put a rb at qb
hope we blow it whatever it takes to get harbaugh and that fraud qb out
if he keeps throwing like shit mcsorely needs to go in man
removed
yeah no its not easy money when youre 65 and played a really rocky game that almost brought dallas back into it



thats a cool bow
heck yeah welcome to the new member of the flock


i am unbelievably hyped for this more than usual and i dont know why
lmao same

i really hate this season more than others what the fuck
prayers up that he has a smooth and quick recovery

if we have another outbreak on our hands the season is over
theres a chance its a false positive the rapid tests have been really inaccurate
this is so disappointing for everyone
apparently his first test today was inconclusive so they pulled him to test again and it came back positive
if he was out there warming up w everyone and is positive now he prob spread it right
why the hell are we testing players when theyre warming up how about we do that i dont know a couple hours before the game
bracing for the dez caught it jokes
what a joke
thats it shut it down play it saturday night more time for rest
dufuq kinda shit is the league pulling now
pain
wtf is this bullshit

he should have been tested hours before game time

he got dressed in the locker room and was out warming up

our entire team is a close contact now
it sucks he got pulled at the last second but would you rather have him play positive
noooo
watch this shit be a false positive
worse game for that to happen ffs
i feel really bad for dez here he may never get this opportunity again
bruh why would they wait until 10 minutes before the game to test him thats so odd
wait are they even gonna play now
this is some bullshit test him again till we get a negative fuck it
bye
how is this not rigged excuse me if im wrong but why would they pull only dez 5 minutes into warm ups for a covid test after he has already been out in the field this makes zero sense
game is bigger than you dez youre 8th string completely irrelevant to this matchup cry on twitter after the game

wtf
could be a false positive
jesus christ man

ah shit here we go again
once again were all wondering if dez caught it
he was warming up before the game so who knows how many high risk contacts will not be able to practice this week

what the fuck dude this season is a disaster and so is our teams response we deserve to get fined the fucking team is so lackadaisical in preparation taking things seriously and staying away from covid it has no spiraled onto everyone who did

this shit is top down harbs edc and steve really need to get a handle on these players and this situation altogether

hope its a false positive but jesus man
dude what
wtf
theyre saying the games gonna get cancelled
and they arent running tests on the rest of the team the nflpa is so fucking weak man
surely if he was just pulled now during warmups a lot of the team are close contact no
week 18

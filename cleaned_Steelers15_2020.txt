its only been a stat since 2006 but the current single season qb hits record is 51 by jj watt in 2014 tj is on pace for 49 and would need 15 over the final 4 games to get the record not an easy task but if he has a big game vs the bengals it could happen
dont worry randy will draw a few plays up to ensure the defense gets a fair share of time in the games to come
if he didnt get hooked so often id say yeah

they were angry after losing the minibye and having the ravens game postponed multiple times came out and unleashed hell with a 3out and int to start on offense couldnt score a td until the 4q and had to hang on to get a w vs a jv team
cmon man theyre professionals not a bunch of teenagers if theyre angry or not it doesnt matter they need good calls and dont drop the fucking ball but guess what offensive coordinator sucks and wr have butter hands they need to improve not being angry as a group of children
the steelers have been angry for like three weeks and have looked like dog shit the whole time no idea what youre expecting to happen with the bills who are one of the best teams in the nfl
i thought they were supposed to be angry after the game was postponed 3 times against baltimore nope

angry when tennessee removed our bye nope

if this is them angry the last couple weeks then teams will be lining up to play them
i sure hope so but we cant assume that a team angry from a loss will play better we can assume if they execute on the field and make the routine plays consistently theyll play better but to your point this loss should help them refocus on the season and if the players are genuinely angered i hope they can channel that into better play on the field
1 they need to push the ball down the field more defenses arent afraid of the deep ball because they rarely throw it linemen are just putting their hands up and knocking these short passes down

2 hopefully haden is good for sunday night and so is spillane we cant afford to lose any more defensive players next man up only works for so long before you get to an area of your depth chart where the skill level drops off sharply

3 conner is obviously the best rb on the team hes at least a threat at rb the rest of them arent
really and you know this because

cowherd is a clickbait douchebag he can want what he wants steelers fans simply dont fucking care about cowherd
steelers have one of the largest fan bases in the nfl and members of the media know this were a passionate bunch and will defend the team when anyone speaks ill of the steelers unfortunately trolls exists for this reason trolls are going to troll thats what they do ignore it dont fall for the bait dealing with online trolls is hazardous to your health and well being
should the steelers resign juju next season
yes lmk my age dude
hell yes


yes
yes whats my age
yes
yes
i can guess every steelers fans iq with 95 accuracy with one simple question

should the steelers resign juju next season
yes what is my age
pay this man im curious how old you think i am
yes hes in a weird spot being the vet for the slightly younger dudes out there catching and ben obv loves him whats my age again blink 182 vibes
yep
he plays the way he does and still has potential sign the man
pay the man
yes whats my age
if he wants wr1 money then no wr23 sure
last time i make a post before going to work okay here i go on everyones age
not a simple yes no answer if its a team friendly contract yes if he wants a ton of money no how old am i
yes

op is not living up his end of the bargain here whats my age again
yes but hes gonna have to take a discount his hit on burfict cemented him as a steeler for life
not on wr1 money because we cant afford it
yes lemme know
yes but only if we use him in more of the way we did from 1719

if he is going to continue to be used for 4 yard slants then no id rather spend the money on other pending free agents
of course they should how this correlates with my age that i am interested in
depends
depends on the terms id like to see him back yes but not for ab money
depends if the numbers work
no already in salary cap hell
no
100 no question about it
absolutely
no
no
no
ill play along

assuming he doesnt come back on some sort of terrific teamfriendly deal absolutely not how old am i
yes if he accepts wr2 level money if he wants hopkins money then he gone
depends on how much he wants hes out of his mind if hes thinking hes getting proper no 1 receiver money from us
probably not for the the money hes going to command

i personally dont care if the browns make the playoffs we beat them 387 why wouldnt we want a chance to play them in a must win game

id rather the expansion browns go 142 before i ever root for the ravens
the ravens winning last night and this week against cle will likely put them in a playoff spot against the steelers as the likely 2 seed id much rather see the ravens lose and miss the playoffs then have to see them again in the first round of the playoffs the only way the browns take the division is if the steelers go 13 or 04 the rest of the way
the only time ive ever wanted the cowboys to win was last night
i dont want to play the ravens in the playoffs our run defense is severely compromised without bush especially the kind of run schemes they use we need bushs speed to counter lamars on the other hand their defense is very good it will be a tossup the browns are an easier matchup for us
fuck this kumbaya shit
down with the clowns
down with the bungles
down with the ratbirds
down with the cheats

go steelers

the end

will you fuckers stop being likeable for a week
this does not help me hate you
the heyward house is a good one founded by cam heyward supports children in the pittsburgh area


steelers fans and bills fans have always had mutual respect after you helped us get into the playoffs i think pittsburgh may have returned the favor by helping buffalo get in the playoffs one year but im not sure either way your fan base is totally awesome best of luck this weekend josh allen is a special guy
thank you for doing this sorry about your loss this upcoming sunday
my googlefu skills are not finding many charities and unfortunately im in meetings all freaking day any chance you could point me in a direction
see this i why i like the bills theyre just a nice group that likes to donate to charity but unfortunately i must root against you
why cant you let me hate you
damn you awesome bills fans i cant be angry
bills got one of the best fan bases in sports no doubt committed to their team and excellent in the community
aw thats lovely i needed something good this week thanks
this is the most wholesome smack talk i ever seen thanks for your charitable acts btw but you catching the smoke sunday
bills have one of the best fanbases in sports imo they may not be huge but theyre loyal never obnoxious seem to have a good sense of humor donate to charity and know how to have a damn good time id say going to a game of ours up there is on my sports event bucket list
so my favorite steelers related charity is one supported by the steelers fans of minnesota our group normally runs raffles every sunday as we pack the bar and drink beer and watch the game sadly with the shutdown we cant do that the proceeds from the raffles go to support second harvest who supply meals to those in need and theres a lot more in need this year


its not pittsburgh or pa but it is a worthy cause supported by the friendliest diehard steelers fans in the nation
z
youre just too goddamned friendly just relocate to canada already im canadian btw your team would be my instant second favourite

looks like spafrancorchamps
my dad is a yunzer not a yinzer further down the mon valley
amazing how is the fit i have a small ass head
where did you find this
this is ridiculously tough
damn that fire
i love it however i first thought it was from the ministry of silly walks

looks sick
yinz likes
thats an awesome hat not only does it capture our current best player in his trademark cele but it also has the shape of pittsburgh itself roughly but its cool nonetheless
how long did this take to ship i would love to get one for my dad if the delivery can get to me in time
thats so dope
i am going to give the benefit of the doubt and say ops phone autocorrected yinz into a south philly accent
antonio brown kicking the punter nice
i sort of wish tj would stop doing the kick as a pt ive seen too many injuries happen from simple things and i feel like he is going to pull or tear a hip muscle
whats that from monty pythons ministry of funny walks
its yinz not yunz noob
its not even fitted pass

i havent watched one all season since that was obviously the reason we hadnt lost yet i guess im good to watch this one
the best thing about a steelers loss is that the pittsburgh dad episodes are always funnier the dude got me through the misery of last season


yeah thats how all this works deb

had me crying said basically the same thing to my wife
this is the best one yet lol
that pearl harbor joke was riiiiiiisky
dudes really not funny his whole sell is his accent which half the time isnt even on point

23 at most allen is way too shifty

i do predict though we make him fumble with a strip sack
allen gonna hold the ball too long
i think tj is going to pop off he needs to for the record he already has dpoy on lock
we only need one to set the record and allen is as slippery as a monongahela whitefish so who knows he could be the one to break it but heres hoping
would you guys start the steelers d in fantasy this week

i get the stats show that by margin of victory we are ahead of the other teams but watching those games it has been a mix of blowouts browns early jags recently and very close games that doesnt really make this stat look bad it just shows that it doesnt really mean anything

weve been streaky and have a few glaring flaws opening up there have been 3 games where we failed to put the other team away and it cost us in one of them we got lucky in 2 others

we arent as good as our record and the drops are not helping our defense is missing key guys and key backups we were exposed by alex smith consistently in the second half luck finally turned on us with a knockup interception on the first play of our last drive
please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this weeks opponent including weaknesses strengths or info on lesserknown players you think will have an impact

if you are a fan of the bills feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above andor ask us about the steelers
how much of an impact do you think spillane and haden being out will have
were both strong teams and playoff bound as much as id like to see the bills win my main hope is a good clean close game with no major injuries

good luck
i think we will see a more successful air attack this week my best friend in a huge buf fan and was telling me in a discussion last night their secondary has had some pretty big issues with big strong physical wrs if we can get something that resembles a decent run game going i think we could see a big day from juju claypool and hopefully washington its supposed to be a pretty shitty night weatherwise though so the cards will be stacked against them in that respect
we should utilize dotson more in the run game he is a people movercheck the highlights we should have some semblance of a run game come sunday i hope
this game is gonna be a nightmare all of my friends are bills fans too
the bills are going to force the steelers to win with their running game it will not open up the steelers passing game they will just either be successful running or they will get beat they will not win passing thats just how mcdermott does it
if our receivers remember how to catch and if we can establish a steady running game then we have a shot at winning otherwise this is going to be another embarrassing loss because mcdermott will force us to run just like how we forced lamar to throw
if we dont run the ball we lose that simple if we can run the ball 100 yds and chew up clock i think we win ben throwing it 50 times isnt gonna work in fact the more ben throws it after 35 attempts the higher our losing chance is
man i like snell i know hes fumbled the ball a bit but hes also gotten the tough yards when we needed it the most a lot of the defenses weve played this year have been well organized and wft is in the top 10 i think if we can get an extra blocker for connor or snell like say i dont know our fb then we could probably get shit going on the run just hard to get through holes that arent there
hey there i seem to recall us meeting around this time last year which team do you think has improved more since last years game in my heavily biased opinion id like to say the bills have improved more overall our offense has made amazing strides and though our defense took a step backwards in the first half of the season theyve been playing well recently but records speak louder than stats and you guys have the much better record so id love to hear your thoughts
hey everyone a user on our sub uberhansen does an indepth analysis of our opponents each week and grades how they match up against our team obviously were playing you this week so heres his analysis would be happy to have you stop by leave a comment and let him know if you think hes missed anything
the more im looking at this the more concerned i am that the steelers could still lose the division our remaining schedule is much more difficult than the browns who get to play the giants and jets
please use this thread to post any trash talk about next weeks opponent some people from their sub may come here to do the same so please

do not downvote visitors for using this post correctly its a trash talk thread
bills fans are nice and theyre reallylovelyand uh

shit
i wouldnt let you guys near my tables because youd probably break it like the incredible hulk or some shit
imagine if a team had 4 years of bad luck in a row
went to pittsburgh for the snf game last year and all the steelers fans were respectful and the stadium was sweet and the wait i forgot where i was going with this
josh allen looks like uncle rico when he grows a mustache and it looks awful
you guys with your generosity towards charity and your exciting young quarterback goddamnit i got nothing
i went to see phish at the peterson events center last year and the parking was terrible you guys have like 4 parking garages just for doctors

other than that im a big fan though best friend is a steelers fan and youre my 2nd favorite team excited for this weeks matchup
yall cant even beat a team that is so bad they dont even get a name

also pittsburgh is a cool town and ive had a couple of good times visiting there people were nice food was pretty good if yall could change yinz for yall like a proper part of the country i might even consider moving there
in the past two years the steelers have had a duck a reindeer and an old clock as their quarterbacks steelers fans look forward to the day when a human player finally lines up under center
iron city is disgusting genny cream ale is far superior
ranch dressing is disgusting blue cheese is far superior
chase claypool has zero hand eye coordination as evidence by his eye black application
theres only one time each year ill listen to renegade and thats when the bills are dancing on the sidelines as the burgh boys lose

all hopes to a clean lowinjury count game
its weird when we play the bills its hard to hate on them so ill just say lets have a good game with no injuries

and wtf is up with you guys and tables thats really such a weird thing you know
shout is a better song than here we go
chase claypool is tyran matthieu moonlighting as an offensive player ive never seen them in the same place at the same time
check out this video of this browns fan in ridiotsincars
whos ready for josh fucks allen to go slangin dick up and down the field

you guys are only allowed to have touchdowns from chase claypool because im canadian so hes obviously my boy
steelers the only thing yall have been stealing is wins over bad teams i would like to introduce you to the one and only buffalo offense the super powered engine to a super bowl bound team lets see how good this steelers d actually is also good luck even though the person i hate second most in this world behind brady is a steelers fan
wings suck

let the hate flow through you
time to play a real team
hope the bills play like its the third quarter the whole time
i used to think pittsburgh had shitty winters

then i went to buffalo holy hell
when will all you steelers fans in this subreddit finally denounce the extremely racist guy i went to high school with who only posts trump things and whiny ref complaints after every steelers game could it be because you all agree with him and endorse all his opinions really makes me think

please pop off this week conner youre our only hope
i knew mike munchak was a big loss but i didnt expect it to be so noticeable just a year after he left hopefully the run game improves with conner back
good deal especially ug3

we now have 21 days to activate him
i think conner scores on 23 of those 6 attempts at the goal line
cassius marsh is a huge fan of magic the gathering lol
with tuitt back and heyward healthy were 2 deep on lde and 1 on rde so probably not much need for another one there

since were playing indianapolis in 3 weeks did we sign marsh just to get some insight into the colts defense
glad connor did well after his positive covid test was a little worried about his health knowing the previous health issues he had to overcome
thank god not only for the sake of our running game hopefully but more importantly for a guy who was probably high risk given his history with cancer to come off the covid list already is good news his life is more important than football
excellent news
so we went from no running game to ok running game
cassius marshi hated that dude when he played for the patriots cant believe we signed him
would love to see gilbert return and give us some depth depending on how long spillane is out we could use gilberts speed in dime packages

i now understand there is a scenario that can exist thank you for explaining everyone

beware this is long because i am a very analytical person so i have the steelers losing out to become 115 i have chiefs number 1 titans 2 bills 3 browns 4 and the wild cards all tied at 115 which are raiders colts steelers and dolphins note in order for steelers to not make it all of these teams have to be ahead of them so steelers would be essentially 8th spot and miss the playoffs also note only these 7 teams are capable of taking out the steelers spot since ravens cant cause of the one from each division tiebreaker happing before the crazy 3 or more teams tiebreaker for the wild card even if the browns are thrown in it doesnt make a difference ok so back to raiders colts and dolphins raiders have to win out to beat out steelers which means them beating the colts this week colts have a 44 conference record right now so that means they would finish 75 conference raiders would finish 93 conference and dolphins and steelers at 84 the head to head doesnt apply here since there are 4 teams tied colts would be eliminated cause of 75 conference and then tie breaker strength of vic in this case would be used to separate dolphins and steelers for 6 and 7th while raiders get 5th since technically everyone but them were eliminated in conference record tiebreaker but the point of this is since we cant get the colts and steelers at 115 alone where head to head would apply colts would always be eliminated first due to the 75 conference since they will always be eliminated first they can not take the seed from the steelers meaning the steelers have clinched a playoff spot right now
stopped reading after saying wed finished 115 tldr
the playoffs were extended to more teams in the past they would have already clinched by mathematical results
alright i finally did it after playing on the nfl playoff machine for so long i finally found the way the steelers can miss the playoffs i believe this is the only scenario in which the steelers can miss

1 tennessee must win the afc south with a record of 115 or better this means they can only lose to either the lions or the packers at most

2 las vegas must win out to go 115

3 miami must win 3 of the last 4 losing only to lv to go 115

4 indy must win 3 of the last 4 losing only to lv to go 115

5 this last step is a bit more convoluted because theres several ways that this can happen but the gist of it is the teams that we have beaten have to lose over these 4 weeks and the teams the dolphins beat have to win ive gotten this to happen several different ways one way for example was to have the no upsets happen outside of what was needed for the above to happen if that happened and the ravens also lost out the steelers would miss the playoffs
this post gave me cte
dolphins can still win the east which would put the bills in the wildcard mix and if the steelers lose this week they would lose the headtohead in the south the colts and titans dont play each other again so they could both win out and the colts would win the division with conference record and the steelers would be a game behind the 124 titans as you noted steelers would be behind the raiders as well as behind the chiefs if the chiefs lost out and raiders won out the chiefs lose the tiebreaker to win the division as a wildcard team the chiefs only have two more conference games to lose vs the steelers four

maybe im wrong like 20 of the drops this past 2 weeks can truly be attributed to bad balls the remaining 80 is just straight up tom foolery among the pass recipients i dont think ben is the full issue here
what a shitty leader always throwing his guys under the bus right boys
this is a leader he brings what he can do better to the table in this instance he also endeavors to raise his teammates to their maximum capabilities
this is being a leader he feels that his calling out ab in public lead to that nasty parting of ways in my opinion hes not going to call these guys out in public

could some throws have been better sure but its also on the receiver to be where the ball is thrown an overran route is going to be a less catchable ball youve also got to try to throw the ball to an area that it was be caught or hit by the defender

guys have dropped balls wide open that hit them in the numbers those should be catches every single time

these guys need to be in early working on the jugs machines you have to catch those easy balls

also fitchner needs to be relieved of play calling duties let ben make the calls at the los and go no huddle all game long the last few weeks they havent tried to stretch the field much dont ask guys to make 2 yard catches into 7 yard gains every play
hes definitely more careful with the media now but this is still the general tone hes had for years he might break down a specific play when asked about that specific play but he always ended with i have to do better which made the hot takes trying to blame tomlin and ben for abs behavior 2 years ago quite obviously bullshit at the time let alone seeing subsequent events turns out the days of our steelers memes were just days of our mbc all along
rnfl

horrible selfish leader and total fatty big ben roethlisberger slanders his young and impressionable receivers i just need them to be at their best when they are at their best we are pretty good is this another attempt to shift blame to his teammates find out as aditi kinkabhawla interviews a former db from the 1964 steelers practice squad with valuable insight into the mind of this madman
i thought against the ravens there were several balls that roethlisberger missed that made for more drops but i didnt see it being much of an issue against the football team i do also think getting guys in situations where they dont have to be planning how theyre going to turn this 2yarder into 6 will help a lot with the concentration
ben has struggled with accuracy at times for sure but lets not pretend there is a major drop problem outside of dj and ebron both of which were known for drops before coming to the steelers dj leads the nfl in drops and ebron is 5th the two of them combined have over half the steelers league leading number of drops
an accurate self assessment team approach and not affixing individual blame let the coaches handle personnel
def not 100 on ben when i see ebron get popped in the fucking chest and still drop the damn ball it is not completely on ben
hes just being humble cause most of those balls have been near perfect passes outside of a few notable misfires
unpopular opinion probably im sick of ben always saying its his fault it wasnt not this time or last time i understand it is smart and may appear humbling from a pr standpoint but it misses when its an outright lie im thankful for a humble leader when its the truth effective leaders also drive better performance when they hold those accountable when needed i understand also that tomlin is doing that just stop making ben a saint he good and well knows it wasnt his fault ill take the cold hard truth over smoke and mirrors any day
big ben is classy
my biggest take away is dropping catchable balls the last two weeks have made us look bad both on a national stage kc is fun to love and we are the evil villain now
most of those drops hit then in the chest but i respect him for not blaming them
this is ben being the adult in the room
a good qb always takes the blame
he needs to be careful or hell throw his back by next game
this is called media training
maybe ben thought they were going to run a different route
so bear with me here could abs implosion have taught ben a valuable lesson about how to relate with wide receivers

this doesnt sound like how ben would have responded to ab if he had a few drops on the day

i think our guy has learned something and it might be what saves this team

we are good when we can get first downs and control the clock throwing 50 a game isnt how our team wins
yes the drops by wide receivers are numerous and unacceptable but i think they also need to be put into context with the steelers inability unwillingness to create any kind of ground game they have resorted to 90 ben ball and with an aging quarterback not looking to take any unnecessary hits hes been getting the ball out in record time rocketing the ball into quick short routes mostly accurate but its hard to be 100 accurate when you barely have time to set your feet after taking the snap not trying to make excuses the receivers have to catch these but when these are 90 of the plays that are run in a game there are many more chances for drops

what if ben held onto the ball for a second longer would the oline hold up im skeptical if we cant run the football then it seems like we at least need to create more space at the line by taking more shots in the deepintermediate range to help out our short passing game

im kind of thinking out loud here but to sum up oline getting beat ben not wanting to take a sack 0 run game 90 quick throws behind the sticks way less room for error

i hope im wrong and i guess well see what happens when they have more than 4 days to game plan but im nervous that if these offensive issues start in the trenches our playoff run wont be very memorable
to a degree yes coming into this season i felt that they would be the achilles heel i do believe theyre better than i expected and the aging guys still have some gas left in the tank but with the injuries and covid issues they have been underwhelming recently most apparently in the run game against an average pass rush theyll hold up ben wanting to get the ball out quickly i think is less to do with them being a serious liability and more of him needing to stay healthy because our backup quarterback situation is the real liability
i think so seriously what happened to our online they keep ben clean but we cant run for shit we need munchack back
i think so we cant run the ball which means the passing lanes arent open but also when conner is playing his best football he doesnt need the best o line so you could also say its the running game
yes chuks is an incredibly poor run blocker not sold on him as a starter long term due to this decastro looks like his pro bowl level days are behind him pouncey has been below average for a couple years feiler is a better rt than g big al the only one having a decent season elite level pass blocking with ok run blocking

they should seriously considering benching chuks moving feiler to rt and plugging in dotson at lg
the line itself isnt the problem its the offensive scheme for running or lack thereof
i think our pass blocking is very good but the run blocking has been suspect all year
i probably sound like a broken record but

second chart down and we are basically tied for 2nd worse in pass block win rate

i have seen plenty of people on this sub and nfl confuse bens sack rate for good pass protection instead of realizing that the quick pass play style is being forced on the offense because of the lines deficiencies

oline is our weakest unit by a decent margin and they give ben and our offense no time for plays to develop

if it was jabrill peppers that shit would go across the room
im glad they  it didnt feel like seeing a dick other than mine today
dictaphone
i miss all the good stuff

who cares its not college ball and they dont make the schedule i stand by that the chiefs schedule isnt terribly more difficult than the steelers


take my strong hand
this only wouldnt be funny if ebron didnt drop half his targets everyone relax and enjoy sportsball
maybe just a little
fans of trash teams get so cocky so quickly
not seeing it what
you guys are still thinking about us after a win interesting

i miss heath miller lol
1 person voted for claypool

i just wanna talk
ebron is not a receiver

make a new poll without ebron for a clearer picture
fuck i thought it said who do we go to the most i read this shit in some other language and voted juju
if yinz vote for juju or claypool your a clown
the only correct answer is ray ray cmon guys
ebron is a te not a receiver
well

the thing is ray ray is the return man so id keep him for now juju is the most reliable so id want to keep him the most but cost the most claypool is prone to drops but is still young and improving so i want to keep him too washington is underrated and should be our 3rd recieving option

so id probably go dj and ebron
i know we have been having issues with catching but wouldnt the returner who doesnt start as wide receiver snd had caused multiple turnovers from dropping returns be the first guy on that list to go

i get the ebron hate but he still is 4th in receptions by a tight end this season you can naturally at least guess two tight ends ahead of him without much thought
washington is the only guy in that group whose replacement is already on the roster
wait i voted juju but i thought it was which receiver do we go to not let go im dumb let go really depends and luckily is something we dont have to decide with anybody but juju and to a much much lesser extent ray ray
i cant see us letting ray ray go with all hes done to improve punt returns
its crazy how even this poll is

rnfl would have a field day with our reactions
ebron ill defend him here and say that we knew his issues and hes on the cheap so he isnt bad for the money yes he has the drops but he also is real easy to drop if he doesnt pan out
honestly i think we can keep diontae for cheap because of his hands claypool we have for a while on a rookie contract washington might take lower but any team with any sense would pick him up he has amazing hands juju is the second coming of ward i think he would take a favorable contract to stay in pittsburgh and i think the steelers can make that happen i am more worried about the defense right now with ben as qb he makes every receiver a weaponwhen they catch the ball
diontae was having a great season until these last two weeks im ready to see juju leave no way hell be worth his next contract especially with the routes that hes being made to run

face it ben cant throw in the intermediate middle of the field anymore where juju is at his best there is literally no point to paying him 7 million a year to run 4 yard slants and get tackled immediately
when is the time

if myles the helmet garret gets it over tj i will fucking riot
the youtube channel thinking football released this vid 4 months ago predicting the 2020 dpoty after 12 games hes surely the front runner

what do you guys think
its going to garrett or donald also we dont want him to get dpoy because if he does hes more expensive to retain

cant argue with fact
honestly i feel like washington was in the same bind we were last year they have a hell of a defense and they have a decent offense just missing a play making qb which obviously alex smith has been getting it done definitely giving washington their props it wasnt an easy win for em but they bit down and got the job done i lowkey get excited to see the not as good teams do well especially if their win over us doesnt hurt our playoff chances but will most likely boost morale for washington
true
lmao thats great
makes me wanna ask which football team what a dumb name lol
we could be heroes too if we got an extra time out at the end of the game
you guys know we beat wft by 14 right

is that birdmans brother
sheeeit about time our team has a sweet ass pair of thighs like that its the missing piece of the puzzle i can hear collinsworth next year heres a guy with thighs that know how to win the steelers were already good but they were missing that key piece of someone who could pull of a crop top and boxer briefs
thats awesome the guy is a big mtg player and has been a special guest on various youtube channels

wheres the rest of his shirt
damn this is the 8th nfl team bro has been on
yo aint he that guy that plays magic the gathering on youtube
didnt realize jackie moon had a son who played anything other than semipro
i have the same pair of underwear
yall cant handle his midriff
is leonard belching there
this picture is fantastic
he lost a bet
well hello there
did these guys just come from a bathhouse
this pic is priceless
he was good for the pats once upon a time right
his new team nickname mr midriff
whys he in a jags uniform
nah im good
uh er ok cool
anyone else getting a johnny manziel vibe
over under on this guy absolutely bring gay

shouldve gotten it done last week
screw that miami loss scenario hope they dick down kc this weekend
ive been playing with this for a while trying to figure out what wild scenario ends with the steelers missing the playoffs and i cant find it as far as im concerned they are in already
would love to clinch the division to guarantee at least the 4 seed and closer to 13
go ravens
what would a brownsravens tie do for everyones chances
just need to beat cinci and no one else to lock up the north
so ive been wearing my juju jersey during every game since the start of the season i thought that if i kept wearing it we would keep winning but then monday happened my tj watt jersey has been untouched thus far is it time for me to switch over i want to do whatever gives us the best chance of winning
its tj time unless we lose to the bills then back to juju
to piggyback off of this i have a terrible towel tshirt that now has a 131 record dating back to last season the one loss was monday do i continue to wear it or do i set it on fire
i dont wash my football gear unless theres a loss have to clean out the stink of defeat
id like to be the first to admit that during the game i let my good luck charm 1 year old son go downstairs with my wife to play shes a washington fani wasnt even thinking this loss is 100 on me
i have a villaneuava jersey i got the day before our first game and it caught its first l should i switch to my juju ab color rush custom name jersey devin bush or roll with ally
i want no part in potentially jinxing our team you are responsible
wear whatever jersey you want the steelers did not win or lose because of your jersey choice

ravens fans have to go into this weekend knowing that if they win they only help us
eh id rather lamar get exposed again this season well just clinch the division next week
whos worried about clinching the division
naw fuck that i hope the browns win and knock ravens out of the playoffs
nope go browns
ravens need to beat the browns to keep their playoff hopes alive
we dont need shit from them we do not seek comfort
it will be interesting to see how dez testing positive and then practicing in front of cameras will affect their team this week
oh hell no im rooting for the browns id much rather see the ravens not make the playoffs steelers ill be fine and eventually clinch the north doesnt matter if it is this week or next or whatever they will be fine no thank you on letting the ravens in to the playoffs just so we can clinch a week sooner for the sake of hating the ratbirds and because they could make noise in the playoffs they can go stay in the safe confinements of their personal homes this january
no not ever not even once we can win the north another week the ravens may win but not with my backing
nah not at all let the browns win and then someone else beat them next week or the week after
if the steelers beat the bills ill root for the browns if the bills win ill root for the ravens
ravens need to beat them to have a chance at a wc spot
im rooting for the meteor
fuck the ravens hope the browns drop a 100
id rather have cleveland win and just have to clinch the north by beating them my hate for baltimore went to record levels i used to hate but respect themnow i just fucking hate them fuck em
nah
i honestly dont really care about the rest of the division tbh the only thing i care about is getting that 1 seed and first round bye
no matter who wins steeler nation can celebrate

its a win win better still have them tie
i hate everybody myself included i love my butter hands boys

this week i hate the bills and i dont give a shit to the rat birds the brownies and so on

i hate 1 team at the time and i hope i have to hate 7 more teams if my calculations are right
i honestly dont know who i want to lose more hopefully they tie or something lol
ive been saying this for a while that the browns are on the rise and have been for the last few years but ill rather see them browns be in the playoffs than them ratbirds aka exbrowns and thats because the steelers has been exposed and i can see us losing at least 2 more gamescall me delusional but its in plane sight that our oline can not run block to save our season
everyone is forgetting the baker has played good against cinci tennessee and jacksonville aka some of the worst pass defenses in the league the second baltimore starts playing tricks hell fall apart again
idec have the browns win and well clinch it elsewhere
enemy of my enemy is my well i wouldnt say friend but i just hope you win but purely because it will benefit me
as if were going to lose out fuck that i want the browns to win this game
we dont have to rely on anyone else to win the north just need to handle our business
i know we can get in through wild card but this will guarantee us the divisional slot
damn clinching the division is cool but so are taking browns to the super bowl jokes
god bless
if they cant be at us they cant beat a team with a competent defense and offense
we might not be undefeated anymore but we can still look down at the ravens in a slapfight with the browns for second and thats pretty funny and enjoyable
we still have the bengals colts and browns on our schedule well clinch on our own
do you really want to win the devision
nah

we have the tiebreaker with cle so even if they win out and we go 22 down the stretch we clinch the afc north and likely the 2 seed

we also currently have the tiebreaker with the chiefs but we lose that tiebreaker if a future loss is to cle or cin

were still very much in the drivers seat theres no need for doom and gloom
baker mayfield had the game of his life last week no way he can repeat that performance he is a second tier qb and probably wont be in the playoffs this year
i cant root for a win best i can do is hope for a tie or an outbreak of positive tests that cause the game to be delayed and fuck up everyones schedule
probably more likely than the steelers beating the bills

in my humble opinion carsons confidence would skyrocket in pittsburgh next year
no way we take on that contract
bloated contract and were trying to cut cap hard no
we are in cap hell dude
unless he completely vacates something in the area of 50 million dollars on his current contract to come and play for 25 million a year that would never happen

also he is not good
if the choice is between him and mason sure ill take wentz in reality i think we extend ben another two years and hopefully his successor is in the next few drafts
cap wise theres no way its happening but i wouldnt mind having him once ben retires
so people say darnold and haskins and i could see that and wouldnt mind but wentz is just bad and mentally broken he is less loved then a backup quarterback who took his team and lead them through the playoffs and won the bowl with events on the sideline only to get it back and have them draft a qb in the second round a year or 2 later
add him to our growing qb committee of jameis darnold haskins and trubisky next year
i would much rather have winston
he is playing awful even when he had a clean pocket which wasnt often this season he had poor decision making and was inaccurate often he just isnt playing good football rn dont think any team would want him on their team rn as anything other than a backup
how about getting stafford why go with a high priced head case
yeah hes too expensive i also dont see him as a long term option i dont seen wentz starting for a legit team 5 years from now we dont want to end up like new england however we need to start thinking what a postben team looks like
fuck no id take darnold minshew fitzmagic over wentz if we need a floater for a year at some point
no
the same as i feel about seeing another one of these threads for the hundredth time
am i missing something bens still here next year with his big ole cap hit right no way in hell we pick him up with that contract unless i missed news of ben retiring were barelywont have cap to resign our players
i often wonder what it might cost the steelers to give josh rosen a one or two year tryout
must be a day of the week ending in y because this sub wants another qb who might become available

doesnt matter if he is good just that there is potential that he becomes available
he sucks fucking bad so no
ive been watching espn and nfl network and they just keep talking about how shitty weve been playing blah blah blah but yet no one is talking about how the seahawks got smoked by the giants we almost won if it wasnt for alex smith fucking with the ball like brady or that pathetic goal line stop we would have won i hope coach and the team hear this shit and we get our shit together sunday night is going to show our real identity if were really one of the best in the league
that field goal was not the determining factor at all in the loss
because the seahawks werent undefeated
since the bills clobbered them the seahawks havent been that good not that surprising they lost theyre 23 over the last 5 weeks
because why the fuck would anybody waste any breath talking about the result of a boring and irrelevant game between mediocre opponents
a lot more eyes on the steelers we were undefeated and admittedly our schedule has been pretty light and we havent looked very good at times everybody was expecting us to drop a game and when it finally came the i told you so takes came rushing in

doesnt matter we lost to a solid team it happens theres barely a degree of separation between the best team in the league and the worst anybody can lose to anybody and talking heads are going to talk their heads off about it
everybody loves russel wilson

previous tweet shows drop rates leaguewide this isnt to excuse the drops but it does indicate that an increase in drops could probably be expected with the type of offense they have been focused on running the last 56 weeks
does any one know if this is because of reduced reaction time because of ball velocity
ukevinbrolbert

this is what i meant
i thought you were going to say its because of where
he throws the balls to and that he should stop illogically throwing to the wr hands
yea well ive seen some of the drops and most of them hit the receivers in the fucjing hands
the league probably ought to work on catching there then
randy fichter is
i dont give a shit about cold or velocity or distance from loscatch the damn ball its routine for some and we keep giving the same dudes chance after chancei appreciate the big play potential but at this point fuck it washington just showed he has that and we know he has hands put out there more

coach tomlin this is snoop dogg man

oh word thanks i wasnt sure for a minute
matt canada is our next offensive coordinator book it
this is from years ago but yeah still applies
its too late to fire an oc but just let roethlisberger call plays
matt canada
he aint lying
lets hire todd haley lol
this is awesome
i get this team likes to keep it in house and promote from within but please bring in someone from outside the organization the offense is way too stale for the amount of talent they have
snoop dogg can you please contact oklahoma state athletic director mike holder and tell him to hire a new hc
hes not wrong
i vote ricky lafleur for our new oc snoop will back me up on this
im pretty sure this who ben wants as oc isnt that how he got the job in the first place
fershizzle
will never forget when snoop went crazy on scobee
ok snoop i forgive you for wearing a brady jersey and hanging out with those jagoffs
this is old as shit
this is so good lol

james connor is a bum though
need this settled after a few interesting posts on the sub my personal opinion is a combination of we dont care and the browns i want to see the ratbirds miss the playoffs all together and i am confident the steelers will win the north regardless of this game

view poll
the steelers
i want the browns to win so the ratbirds season can come to an end hopefully lamar bails on their franchise
the answer is 100 we want the ravens to win all it takes is the steelers to lose to the bills and colts and the browns to beat ravens giants jetsand all of a sudden our final game is vs the browns with the division on the line the colts and buffalo are good teams and other than ravens browns schedule is cake

we 100 want baltimore to help us out here
tie
this was the hardest decision of my life and i just bought a house this year i still said browns because ftr
im rooting for whichever outcome favors the steelers more which would be baltimore winning
might as well have fun watching lamar for one game
go browns

the steelers only need two more total of steelers wins and browns losses to clinch the division its not realistic to be worried about the browns catching up to us for the division lead

should the browns defeat the ratbirds this week it would seriously cripple their playoff chances since they lose tiebreakers to the dolphins raiders and patriots at least

even though we swept them it is in the steelers best interest that the ravens miss the playoffs

therefore the browns winning will hurt the ravens more than the ravens winning will help the steelers



i can only imagine a scenario where the ravens eliminate the steelers in the playoffs i will not be thinking wow it sucks that the ravens made the playoffs but at least we had the comfort of clinching our division in week 14 instead of 15


we do not care
at least you finally have something to be proud of cherish it

but why is polamalu white
i have the same ornament on my tree now
from your childhood

man you all are young

aka your defensive player of the year
i wonder how defensive gradings work aaron donald has a higher grade but tj leads in these three important categories
and victim of uncalled holding over 9000
my fuckinghero nahhhhim too damned old for hero worship best player on the defense though
man is balling out every game
keep stacking those stats and hes a certified dpoy
dpoy
hes only gotten better every year so idk could be like brother and 3x
2020 dpoy
he should win dpoy but wont because everyone has a stiffy for aaron donald even when hes having a down year for him
god bless
qb hits is a weird stat lol
hes just made different
defensive player of the year
i know that it is controversial but tj has not single handedly won us a game minkah has won us games directly bc of his play tj had the chance last game and he cost the team dearly 4th goal holding penalty and the lack of focus on the forced fumble

either play not being a mental lapse and we win the game yes he is great great but i need a signature game this season to be the def mvp he could have locked it up last week but let it slip through his hands
really hope his knee does not implode like a lot of our guys
poor guy should have just fell on that ball though
still wont win dpoy because reasons
he also didnt recover an easy fumble and committed an unnecessary holding penalty on 4th down at the goal line


ravens fan here not talking shit but breaking down how they lost what they need to do etc
the need to get connor backand as much as i hate to say it ben need to get one of his balls back

i am not saying he should take a beating like he used to in his younger daysthat would be about three balls worth of braverythe guy used to get beat to hell and back but this one step dropget rid of the ball thing seems to have been figured out by two teams in a row

we have a talented group of receivers we need to trust them we also need to find some kind of balance between running and passing

as far as the defense injuries are fucking the team avery williamson needs to learn the scheme in a hurry hopefully hadens bell wasnt rung too bad on defense the issue is personnel right now not schematic


forest vs watford
i miss that sound they used for watt in heinz field
sorry to burst your bubble but theres an h in what

good that opens up intermediate slants the deep pass and the run game and we can stop fucking throwing bubble screens to nowhere
this makes me feel better than i did yesterday weve been really good at bouncing back from being exposed historically so perhaps this will force our offense to shift into overdrive

id love to see them throwing more intermediate stuff like they did in past years it seems like theyve been running the masonduck playbook this year on offense so far

were either going to get blown out by buffalo or were going to blow them out time to see what were made of
on the play starting at 759 if ben waited just a second longer to throw the ball then he would have had diontae johnson all alone down the middle granted we dont know if johnson would have caught it but if he did then it would have been a td

going forward i think ben should use his pumpfake even more and the wrs should trick defenders into thinking theyre going to run short routes but expand them into intermediate routes imagine opposing defenses biting on a quick pumpfake and leaving a bunch of wrs wide open in the intermediate zone thatd make them back off pretty quick
ben just playing the long con and going to start dropping bombs on every play in the playoffs
gotta appreciate alex man dude always is making quality content
i wonder how much of this is the schedule covid and our guys not getting many reps in practice hard to put new wrinkles in the playbook on these short weeks
you know what fixes all of this a run game
take gunslinger ability off of ben and bingo bango bongo no more batdowns
i personally think at 110 they were putting this on film for a reason i think they are baiting teams to play them a certain way to open up something else down the road i also think there is a reason for bringing in watt and not putting him on film at all as fullback you sacrifice a loss or two but the playoff spot has been secure along with a division title for the most part for the past few weeks i also think tomlin has found ways to create and artificial bye week over the past few weeks and generally this has looked like a team that hasnt practiced i expect them to lose to the bills but turn it on for a deep playoff run after that game
this might be a little far off in space but i truly think that we played a limited playbook for a few games this season when it comes to those big games thats when all the stops get pulled out if you can win with virtually the same plays why change it that way when scheming is completely different for an opponent they are caught out of step
not gonna lie i dont trust the guy on youtube who just broke 5k subs to tell me what nfl coaches are doing
unless the answer presented is very little besides hoping the receivers drop the ball then there is no value to the content

i think people are worried because we are regressing something fierce our offense looks like ass and our defense isnt consistent im not looking forward to our next few games
right no shit i dont live around many other steelers fans mostly packers fans which sucks and i just keep saying im just glad were 111 win some lose some then they comment how easy our schedule is and how we got lucky no team goes 110 without some luck and we didnt pick our schedule
id rather lose now and have a few weeks to figure it out than lose in the playoffs
think back to the end of last season where we watched the browns lose and ruin our playoff dreams think about how bad you felt now imagine if someone came up to you and said dont worry the steelers will win their first 11 games next year you would have called them a nut im proud of my boys they really bounced back
i have said it before and i will say it again we are the most spoiled fan base of all time
its not so much that loss that worries me its the bad play drops penalties and injuries all keep piling up other folks are saying our boys are tired all the other teams should be in the same boat right we are not trending in a good direction
10 days rest vs 4 days rest can make a 47 team look like they are as good as an 110 teamwait
preach
yeah i think everyone is overreacting a bit to the loss were 111 lol youd think we just lost the superbowl
fire tomlin trade ben punch fichtner anything less than 120 having won all twelve by three scores is an embarrassment
we lost bud for that sham of a game that shouldnt have been played at least at that time im more angry at that then wft a perfect regular season really seems like a curse on disguise
swept baltimore
expectations came with the performance we looked legit for a few games early on but now we look awful if this team played to its potential theyd win every game by 20
people need to chill out the offense is ass because pouncey isnt in so the ol cant even muster up a yard conners out too if you wanted a run game these last two weeks were not going to be it

the defense looked awful because it was missing its top 2 corners and the ilb position was decimated

itll get back together were a great team that got bit by the injury bug after playing 12 fucking games with no real bye and were still 111
agree in principle at the start of the season i pegged our record as 133 assuming ben would come back strong but it is more the trend of late game collapses and the injuries that are piling up the washington game seems like a microcosm of our season up early and rolling only to lose it in the end that is what this season feels like realistically i can see us losing 2 more games and going into the playoffs flat then dropping out in the first round i hope im wrong that is just the feeling i am getting
hopefully we can bounce back in buffalo at the very least this game was a wakeup call we really needed
only have one expectation 7
im not happy about the latest spate of injuries im not so much worried about the dropsies the receivers have of late since i blame much of that on the lack of routine
the loss wont look as bad in 4 weeks with the redskins rip off 4 in a row win the division and are the team no one wants to see in the first round they have a great d and alex smith just wins
i am worried play calling is bad ben is inaccurate and the receivers drip four or five easy passes a game
a loss to a team with 10 days off after having 5 days off vs the rats with wings bump in the road they werent going 160
111 is always a good mark the big concerns now are the running game defensive injuries and receivers dropping passes that should be caught all are legitimate concerns
im more worried about injuries not the loss
agreed brother dont even remember a season this good and ive been watching every game for the last 20 years im in my late 20s now and dont know how many more years we can realistically expect a sb opportunity ill enjoy this season before we plunge to rebuild mediocrity in a few years
it still amazes me how fans around here react after losing our first game in 12 weeks the amount of people yelling and screaming about burning everything to the ground and firing coordinators is downright embarrasing

its just funny how you see jagoffs posting screenshots from the ravens or browns subreddits poking fun and then those same jagoffs are whining and crying about randy as if hes the one dropping passes or blocking like a broken screen door
theres also an argument to be made than an undefeated team doesnt have a crappy loss we got outplayed in every aspect of the game straight up exposed unless we in a 6 day time frame adjust and learn to play football differently the way to beat us is out there on film for anyone who cares to watch
i mean ur right 1 loss and everyones acting like the 2007 patriots
its not one loss though they are trending downwards
everyone bitching can travel back in time and enjoy the season we had last year honestly last year was completely unwatchable this year has been a treat so far who cares if we dont win flashy a win is a win however i do wish our youngs guys would stop with the tik tok shit its just dumb random lip syncing and dancing in the locker room just stupid to me
why yes i can remember when the team looked like it could successfully execute a game plan i hope i get to see that again
glad someone said it i understand we havent been playing up to our potential and there are some glaring in inconsistencies but any other team would kill to be in our position record wise were going to make the playoffs and i feel we have the skill and coaching to get better in our deficiencies ill be proud of this team no matter what happens
its in the way we lost hopefully its the wake up call we need
it absolutely is i truly thought we were gonna go 160 so i am bummed but were still a big superbowl contender
its not the one loss it looks like theyre getting worse every week
this is a good spin on things
im not sure the expectations are out of hand this is arguably the most loaded talented roster in the nfl the regular season is a formality and the season will be measured by the postseason

for me its simple the same exact warts that showed in 2017 and 18 are still here plain as day lack of focus and starting slow ineffective run game and ben throwing a bazillion times this team has more talent than both the others so i was hoping theyd be different

in 2017 we saw an inflated record due to playing a bunch of backup qbs we know how that ended in 2018 we choked repeatedly down the stretch

we can overcome these warts most times because in a qb driven league our hofer is almost always better than our opponents but then come the playoffs
washington played harder than we did simple facts my concern is this is the second halfassed outing weve had in a row
we are going to make the playoffs we just need to win when it counts only thing that got me through a home loss to the football team
god bless
have the fire tomlin thread started up yet
nah
seasons over
all i think of is maybe next year
s
its not really about whether or not people are optimistic but rather what forms realistic expectations people look pretty silly when they say we beat a team with a bad record by a small margin so we suck ill agree with you there but its reasonable to be worried about a defense that will be down a starting corner and two starting linebackers including being down to 3rd string at one of those linebacker positions which will probably end up having to be filled by a safety its reasonable to worry about an offense that has been making fixable mistakes lately that cant entirely be excused by a lack of preparation and whether or not those issues will be fixed

i agree that we see a lot of we won by a small margin and thats bad news or in past years earlier in the season it was we lost to this team so thats bad news it obviously goes without saying that cherrypicking a specific performance in a specific game is not perfectly indicative of the future we saw a lot of they only beat garrett gilbert by 5 points complaints even after the 26 point win over the bengals and 24 point win over the jaguars and those were obviously irrational but sometimes there is real reason to be concerned moving forward
the record is great but you would think we would feel more comfortable about 111 but unfortunately there another 111 team this year and they look a lot better than we do also the injuries are piling up at key positions

one loss can turn to 4 really quick also it doesnt help how the scheduling jerked us around possibly affecting performance

heres hoping for a better performance on sunday night
its kind of upsetting that this even needs to be qualified
i dont give a shit about the loss im concerned with how terrible they look right now other teams look like theyre starting to figure things out and the steelers look like theyre getting tired and confused
you are right its a fabulous season however it can go downhill at warp speed with tomlin coaching
yah yall stop being so mad you lost 1 game my patriots are 66 chill out

90th upvote
haha this is awesome
its at 39 right now minkah
well someone fcked up
i never upvote a 43
ill admitive downvoted a good crosby post that was on 88 just sayin
just upvoted this to 69 heh heh heh
when i was a kid i always broke my the volume must be divisible by 5 rule when i would set the volume at 43 on my tv lol

just as a stupid side note that old tv was amazing because it went on a scale of 0100 and 50 was pretty much the optimal setting and so i could adjust it so perfectly depending on how loud i wanted it my current tv goes 0100 but 5 is the optimal setting and anything over 10 is deafening its stupid
did you miss the part where we lost on monday
its ok guys ill just down vote just to get the numbers back down to player numbers

this was so wholesome i love it
this is my christmas
as a buckeye fan i love this and the sound bite from mike tomlin to chase young pregame
didnt mike tomlin say something along the lines of i hope i never lose enough games to draft someone like you

lol
he woulda chased young ben
more like if he hit him it would have been roughing

great owners

not any other team where a five year old can learn the names of all the head coaches of the last 50 years in 5 minutes

no black and gold
i bought these today
like these more than the ab nikes that came out
do they help you drop the ball

although some of you dont like 92
got ab as well but damn did homeboy screw up
i will not put him on my wall thats for sure
i see 66

i miss alan not mario


is that the head of fauci if so agreed

goddamnit now im going to be thinking about this for the rest of the season
if the boys need they wifi turned off after dark then do it
this must be it put an asterisk next to our l
aye it is what it is we gotta do what we gotta do to win
im about to dm juju ebron and chase and tell them to stop beating off
what if manwhat if d
i dont make it a habit to think about what other people do with their dicks
this is one of those moments when true fans can step up to provide a lending hand to their team in need
this is either a good joke or some mgtow bullshit
wasnt there a seinfeld episode about this
thats it im out
too much steelers information today
i almost just spit out my coffee here have an updoot
fbi open up
eric epron amirite
this is the only logical explanation
i wonder if jujus participation in nnn is what led him to go after conners booty with a fork
can confirm their were multiple receivers participating ill try to see if i can find the post when im off work and post it here
sorry i had to downvote i saw there were 70 upvotes
when you are undefeated you dont start getting cute with no nut or a lot of nut do your job and let the natural balance of nutting be what it is
nnn is for virgins
those effects go away after a week apparently nice theory tho lmao
im actually thinking ebron and dj cant handle cold weather
dude wtf is wrong with you placing weight on the increase in energy levels from no nut november maybe they just had a bad day sunday and got their first loss of the season grow up

way to go vance hope you get to start vs the bills
this picture has him looking like a dancing instructor from a summer resort
and myles garrett is the browns nominee
chris conte disagrees
do they mean ray ray
is he usually a scum bag dont get all the hate
also best jawline nominee
i thought you had to commit aggravated assault with a deadly weapon on national tv to get this nomination what am i missing
i kinda wish it was juju
love vance can we also take a minute to appreciate the man this award is named after a legend on and off the field he was
the browns nominated myles garrett are you kidding me gaslighting at its finest
gotta love him
hey should be rewarded with 1015 balls against the bills
guys honest question how do you get forearms like that please help am insecure
nice try vance mcdonald
now put him on the fucking field i cant take another dropped pass by ebron
man of the shadow realm
this is a huge award and i hope mac wins it
its nice that he did something this year

nice try vance mcdonald
didnt vance say he prefers being the blocking te
yall this is super recencybias vance also drops passes theyre both known for dropping passes
ehhh
im pretty sure that vance and ebron share a pair of hands thats why we decided to bring ebron in hoping that they would fuse together on game days perhaps kolbert couldnt convince the supreme kai to lend his potara earrings if anyone recalls how the fusion dance goes please send it to tomlin for this weekend
he would if he should why do you think he should
hope we go after a te in the draft
so easy even a caveman can do it
i dont mind ebron on the deeper targets he seems more reliable on those getting vance those small dump offs instead of ebron could be the play though ebron seems to drop all the short passes
want to see vance pick up speed and get those stiff arms going
he should get more playing time that i agree with even if theyre not feeding him targets ebron is basically an inline wide receiver given how poor his blocking is hell play a little bit more 12 personnel and get them both out there and throw some different looks at the other team
vance is good after the catch but he has a pretty high drop rate not really what we need more of
he had drop issues before drops were an issue
his hair game is underrated
eh
vance should clearly get more playing time both ee and vance drop their share of passes but vance can actually block we need better runpass balance if we want to go deep in the playoffs
amen to that
get separation 1st
we need vance to suit up on the other side of the ball this weekend linebackers are all dead and vance isnt afraid of contact give him the green dot fuck it
nah
ben 3s eric
i just think he needs to be more involved just so he can block in the run game or in screens main priority is getting the run game going then we can start fucking around w whos gonna get benched for dropping balls
if ebron continues to have hands of stone then vance needs to get more targets
more vance less ebron ebron pisses me off on multiple levels dude has such a big mouth on sm and probably on the field hes a newby who plays like complete shit stop fucking smiling after u drop ur 5th pass of the night only thing funny is you getting cut after the season your not hines
how quickly yall forget

vance is a jag hes not particularly reliable definitely not explosive and barely an adequate blocker one great stiff arm and people think hes great after the catch

juju isnt the one dropping the balls
im pretty sure he has the least amount of drops out of everyone lol im sure hes just trolling with this
you guys are honestly fucking slow if you think hes becoming a diva like ab dude is a 24 year old that likes to playstream video games and hop on tik tok theres absolutely nothing wrong with it especially since it earns him more money than his nfl contract does

hes not out trash talking the team hes not out beating up women and nutting on their back hes not out throwing tables off from balconies

holy fuck some of you guys just hate to see anybody having some resemblance of fun
players can have lives outside of football
he only has 3 drops this season im pretty sure
goddam you do know its thursday what do you want him to do sit and sulk about the loss and his drop all week
this sub will have a meltdown when they realize mark madden has been right all along
i said this a while ago and got shit for it but i am pretty sure juju will be another bell or brown
i bleed black and yellow but id be lying if i said im not a pretty huge ravens fan too it was really fun to watch their 2012 playoff run and i think lamar is hella fun to watch too and i think harbaugh makes for an interesting coach im honestly surprised as to why more people dont just enjoy good football regardless if who its played by rather than getting caught up in hating teams becuz theyre our rivals guess im just more openminded than most sports fans
dude youre not a real fan of any team just a bandwagoner youre barely a football fan so thats why you will never understand

ididilaudid points7 days ago

not gonna lie i was a patriots fan for a while but i decided to be a steelers fan this year to switch it up and i couldnt be happier our defense is fucking filthy black and yellow baby
i have never understood having any sort of a vested interested in another team its steelers and fuck everyone else
i bleed black and gold

no you dont
i dont think theres a problem with rooting for an additional team do what you like especially if it doesnt hurt anybody and it allows you to enjoy your life and the sport more

the one thing i will say about rooting for the ravens however is i dont know how i would reconcile rooting for a team whose success comes at the expense of the steelers so like this week its easy i am going to root for the ravens against the browns because someone is going to win that game and the browns are the bigger threat to the steelers than the ravens most of the time though the ravens are battling with the steelers for positioning and arent in a position to help them in anyway and if anything theyre hurting them so i dont know how i would be able to build up an affinity for them the same way i have a team like the packers or panthers
you posted cringe bro
because youre not a steelers fan lemme guess youre also a red sox and yankees fan
ew
bro stop cheating on your girl and stop cheating on the steelers
theres nothing wrong with liking whoever you want nobody gives a shit but dont come here and say you bleed black and gold while also saying you pull for our biggest rival thats not what bleeding black and gold means

also youre not more open minded gtfoh its a fucking sports league open mindedness doesnt coming into the equation you were a pats fan up until this year so up until brady left and then you decide to change fandom and you pick a team that just so happened to be undefeated most of the season yea youre a troll
thats like being a pretty big ohio state fan but being a pretty huge michigan fan too or big into the eagles but also pretty big on the cowboys

you can be a fan of football and not choose a team and that seems to be what you want
because it cant be done and still be in good taste
yo whos mans is this
delete this nephew
dude why cant i stan for both the autobots and the decepticons
because theyre rivals you dont bleed black and gold if youre actively cheering for a division rival lol theres a difference between appreciating their game and cheering them on
guess im just more openminded than most sports fans

theres a difference between being open minded and switching who your favorite team is every year depending on who does best lol
you can think that theyre fun to watch without rooting for them just saying
well i mean i tend to root for the giants and plenty of people know that their my nfc team and so i suppose its not all bad to root for another but really the ravens
support whoever you want but if you are a true steelers fan you hate baltimore they are literally our biggest and most hated rival i get like players on the ravens but not supporting two teams in the same division
this guy is a clown lol go be a chiefs fan u bandwagon your not open minded ur just not a real fan i would puke if i was rooting for the shitty ravens can a mod get this guy up outta here
oof ive read some of this kids posts hes terrible please commit fully to being a ravens or any other team fan and get the fuck out of here and break up with your gf you sociopath
the sub wouldnt be the same without fresh yinzer opinions voice your unpopular thoughts hot takes and bold predictions here about anything football related

hate an admired playercoach love a hated playercoach do you actually like roger goodell think jesse didnt catch it he did any opinion about the steelers the rest of the league or the game in general are accepted throw em all here

responding to someones comment to create civil discussion and changing opinions are encouraged dont be a damn jagoff and turn it into a toxic argument

do not downvote others because you dont like their opinion

downvotereport content that break the rules

this thread is intended to not shame others who have different ideas and thoughts that go against the grain of the metas in the sub



and as always dont be a damn jagoff
this buffalo game is a window into the steelers future when you look at the types of teams that are likely to make the playoffs in the afc this is the type of team that youre going to have to beat can you hang with a very good offense and an adequate defense the league has shifted towards offensive football over the course of the last decade so what the steelers are trying to do this year is buck that trend elite defense and an averageinconsistent offense the offense has been stale going back to the cowboys game and it finally came back to bite them can it show up in a game where theyre likely going to need to score 26 points against a mediocre defense
run game tops 100 yards ebron has zero drops dj 1 drop steelers defense has a good bounce back because the run game gets going giving them a breather we remind the nfl who the 1 seed is

steelers 31 bills 17
bold predictions diontae bounces back from his drops and catches 2 tds and the run game gets back on track with 120 yards on the ground
i think this could be our best game offensively yet with the exception of last year for obvious reasons we tend to have one game a year where we go off especially ben last one i remember is 2018 against carolina we were 521 carolina was 62 people were really doubting us we didnt look great we didnt have a signature win the game started out rough with cmc running well but we ended up just beating the brakes off them ended up winning 5221 but it was 5214 until about 530 left in the 4th ben threw for 5 that game

this just feels like the kinda game where we go off after all that shit with the schedule moving around and having our first loss against a team that had 10 days to prep vs our 4 i can just see this team making a statement buffalo is a very good team would have been 102 if hopkins didnt somehow come down with a td in triple coverage on a hail mary but this same team got their doors blown off by the titans so theyre not perfect if our defense can play a solid game and we can just get some vintage ben this could be a 4017 type of shellacking

or its a close game and we either win or lose but im gonna pick the first option
with conner back theres a better run game receivers dont drop 8 passes defense gets a couple turnovers i dont have a heart attack the entire game
james conner beat cancer then covid then the bills to the tune of two touchdowns one on the ground and one through the air
steelers lose 3117 steelers next win will be against the bengals steelers go 124 offense is completely exposed to the league now the formula is there
here is an unpopular opinion if the steelers dont beat buffalo im going to think they are a one and done playoff team

because they kind of look like one to me when they cant run the football consistently and dont throw the ball downfield with any consistent success you might be able to overcome one of those not both

especially since we can no longer rely on the defense to carry us the way we could earlier in the year injuries are piling up and this d has always been overly dependent on turnovers if the other team protects the ball our defense looks a little ordinary at times

a more systematic defense is a little scarier to me in the playoffs

now from what ive heard there is some thought among a lot of the players that we are holding back a little bit because were in a very good position to make the playoffs still in a pretty good position to skip the first round and there are things we dont want to show i dont know if thats true lets see what we do with buffalo look if they crush buffalo then im probably barking up the wrong tree

one more thing to note it isnt necessarily a dealbreaker that i dont think our defense is elite there are no elite defenses in the nfl this year we still might have the best unit ive seen quite a few elite defense of units in pittsburgh over the years this just isnt one of them the list of impressive quarterbacks we have beaten this year is incredibly short
i dont see us making a deep playoff push bye week or not our offense has collapsed on itself with a nonexistent run game poor run blocking inexcusable dropped passes and ineffective playcalling even on defense while we are more consistent we still blow coverages that lead to huge gains for opponents every now and then and given how poorly the offense plays our defense has to go back on the field and stay there longer which tires them out and consequently makes them play poorly

its too frustrating to watch this unless we fix our offensive issues we are going to get bounced out of the playoffs by complete teams like the chiefs bills and even the browns
we lose this one 3424 but we see the bills in the playoffs once our defense is healthy and absolutely smack them around
bold prediction fichtner has been sandbagging this whole time and this week were going to see an offense we barely recognize someone on the steelers other than a qb is going to throw a td
nothing against buffalo i just want to keep the streak going

clears throat

trap game trap game trap game
ravens will be our biggest challenge in the playoffs
with the steelers i just think the biggest concern is how well their offence is going to perform when they face tough defenses in the playoffs the ravens gave them a very difficult time in pittsburgh and washington gave them all sorts of trouble as well the way those games were scheduled definitely played a huge factor so i cant discount that theyve got a lot of pretty young receivers out there just wondering how guys like johnson ebron claypool are going to do in those high pressure moments those drops seem kind of concerning especially since as a team theyve led the league in drops for the whole season i believe

x200b

i know the defense will come ready to play i just hope the offence can be as well
i hope we beat the shit out of buffalo im so sick of people on the outside who dont watch every single snap this team takes voicing their expert opinion on how were overrated and we cant beat kc


we will win out


we will beat kc


we will go back to the super bowl


fucking church
unpopular opinion ben can be a key piece on a team that gets to the sb but hes not good enough to put an offense on his back and lead them there
steelers lose 2717 running game not any better and offensively we stumble again 13 and 3 will definitely be a possibility i dont like it any better than yinz but without a decent running game we will probably be one and done in the playoffs ugh
its hard to watch the last two games and think it is likely we win more than 1 game the rest of the season

i hope im wrong hopefully these were just two bad games for us and we can bounce back but these past two week have been awful and if we keep playing like this only the bengals will let us win
with williams haden and spillane out this week this defense consists of mostly backups its going to come down to how the offense plays and from what weve seen recently i dont have a lot of faith that they will keep up with the bills i think we drop this one and get stronger down the stretch when guys start coming back and the offense has more time to work out its deficiencies
this doesnt concern the steelers directly or it may not at all but i think the bucs could be a dangerous team after their bye week they havent looked very good at all in recent games but this bye week could give them time to just slow down and readjust their offence if they change it to finally go with what brady has always been good with they can become a much more dangerous team id be shocked if they come out of the bye and keep trying to play the same type of offence they were before it if brady was smart he would atleast had a talk with arians when it comes to adjusting the type of offence

x200b

i think theyll be a very interesting team to watch for the ros and playoffs
unpopular opinion the sky isnt falling were fine and finish the regular season 142 with the top seed in the afc
we have all the onfield machinery to sbxxviicowboys their asses but were in dire need of finding some new mechanics
as long as ben is the starting qb fitchner will be the oc that is bens guy and he will remain asong as ben is his qb
vance mcdonald should see more of the field we run better when hes out there for blocking plays ebron is awful at blocking you give less reps to ebron until he executes

hope coaches start adjusting personnel for certain teams
if we had to lose any game this season im glad it was washington if we beat the bills colts and browns in our final stretch i wont have any worries plus we kept the 1 seed
bold prediction the drops will only get worse in the cold buffalo night weather the offense will continue to struggle in the long field but a combination of buffalo mistakes and defensive turnover plays will give the offense the short field 23 times and score on every possession it will be a surprise blowout win which will further confuse everyone
prediction not happy about it

we go 13 to finish the season limp into the playoffs and are one and done in the offseason tomlin gets a huge contract extension ben retires in 2 years we have some up and down seasons for several more years but fail to make it to the super bowl as the chiefs become the new patriots tomlin eventually leaves to coach another team and wins a super bowl there in less than 2 years
the offensive line is horrible and will derail the entire season need to fire the ol coach
hows this for a hot take if he is offered and accepts the job which is a big if and gets trevor lawrence bill cowher will win a super bowl with the jets before the steelers win their next ring
steelers should find a way to sign carson wentz as bens successor
pretty hot take for me were going to lose this one were thin at lb allen is a good running and throwing qb their offense has weapons a d their defense is good too this is gonna be a tough one 2723 bills
other in the comments

view poll
none of those tbh i think we need an ol first round
i would have voted ol
1st round olcb
2nd round olb
3rd round rb
the fact that ol isnt anywhere surprises me i think they should leave the first two rounds with an ot and a gc who can take over for pouncey in the near term
oline dude
wheres the ol option
wheres the none of the above choice o line hands down
surely we have to be thinking a new center here
would be great if we could pick up creed humphrey center for ou
none of the above oline
ol without a doubt
with this team the next draft will be depth which is a great place to be

our ol needs to get younger

we need a dt since alualu has played himself into a large contract back to back dts

id also like to see us take a te a fusion of vances stiff arm blocking and ebrons athletic ability minus drops lol

a day 2 rb would be nice if bpa

i dont want to see this team draft a cb but well need to bring someone in if we lose hilton and sutton

i like highsmith at olb but if bpa thatd be a luxury

we have depth at ilb if every stays healthy bush bince spillane
1st ol

2nd ol again

3rd rb
o line is the obvious choice fix that and magically see the running game improve
ol and we need to get a qb in the second or third
offensive line yes or yes
honestly too soon to tell ol is def a need but i dont think we need to use a first on it assuming banner can heal up properly and be ready to go next year but id say 2nd or 3rd round depending on who we retain and let go we will need to take a slot type corner assuming either sutton or hilton are gone we could use definitely use a stud te
bpa
almost at the end of the 2020 season which position should the steelers selection 1st overall the draft

ol t or center

why isnt it an option
oline then rb
id love to draft wyatt davis from ohio state would be a great addition to the oline
lol ol should be the number 1 choice
imo ol is the biggest need with cb dl and te potential grabs also olb could be it if highsmith isnt the future starter at rolb i hope not because not every position on the defense needs to be a first rounder

x200b

now i think chuks can play lt just fine banner resigned for rather cheaply can play rt dotson imo can replace feiler outright or move feiler back to tackle where i think he does better than guard pouncey and decastro remain where they are but they are getting old

x200b

hence why i think ol is a bigger need especially getting guys like dotson we need players like him who like to run block when we get in the transition between ben and heir qb whoever will need a oline capable of keeping the team balanced on offense
quarterback
o line tight end
im just hoping they draft juice herbert out of vt only got to watch him play for one season and he is an instant favorite for me would love to see him keep playing
ol
hate to say it but ben is getting old sooner or later were gonna need a qb
good question lb hopefully is a this year issue rb needs help i feel like we need help at ol but im not certain
so if we are 1 seed 2 seed or 3rd seed we will most likely play 6th or 7th seed first time we play who would you like that to be the most
id have to say id like to play miami or the colts

we want to be the best then we need to beat the best fuck it bring anybody lets go
seems like ben likes playing the colts
miami theyre not good enough at qb to beat our d plus a warm weather team coming into the burgh in january would be advantageous
anybody but baltimore if we are the 2 seed and they are the 7 seed its so hard to beat the same team 3 times in one year and a baltimore game will most likely take 3 years off my life
i want to say the browns cause weve had their number but also since we still have to play them in what could possibly be a afc north champ game i dont want to jinx it so instead im going to miami
still a lot of possibilities with 4 weeks left most likely 67 seeds as of now are mia ne balt lv and either tennindy of those mia or lv would be my first choices after this week there should be a little more clarity with big games between clebalt indylv and pitbuff
the one team i dont want to play at all isthe ravens divisional games are very tight typically
baltimore or cleveland im not the type to hope we can avoid certain teams so why not hope we can end any aspirations either of those teams might have
gimme the brahns or the purple brahns

i like it when we beat da brahns

if only his daughter lived in the burgh we could a kept him now hes destined for mediocrity in denver playing second fiddle to mahomes for the rest of his career miss you munchak
if he were still here i bet we couldve gotten a yard
people will blame fichtner and no one is throwing blame at the ol coach by far the weakest part of the team killing us
me too kid me too

everyone was saying it wouldnt hurt but our o line has progressively gotten worse at the run since his departure
me too but i really dont think he can help pouncey and decastro get younger
we need him back badly
he really was a fantastic ol line coach the new coach should just have copy and pasted what he did
me too man me too
never talked aboutbut huge loss huge
as much as the symmetry of a downwards facing steelers logo appeals to me i think my dislike for the ravens is greater plus on the ravens sub their downvote logo is heinz ketchup

edit ok i hear you guys just wanted to see the pulse of the sub everything yinz say is fair
we dont need them living rent free in our heads we already live rent free in theirs
how about tomlin upvote and fitchner downvote
nah we already live rent free in their heads no point in giving them the same
no why do you want ravens swag over here if anything make it scobees face
i am good thanks
no i dont want to be like the ravens subreddit
no their downvote button is embarrassing they care about us way more than we care about them and it shows
imagine opening every thread and having to see those hideous colors and logo even if its mocking them no thanks
no thanks they are not that important
make it offensive coaches face
no as much as i enjoy them getting hyped about the rivalry and i think their heinz downvote is funny it would be a little lame and embarrassing if we made our downvote their logo
i agree that we should do something about our upvote and downvote logos wtf is the ravens upvote logo anyways i honestly cant tell what it is

whatever the case i think we should always have the steeler logo as our upvote logo and the downvote should be whatever team we are facing that week make it happen mods
nah leave that kind of shit for the bengals sub if youre really the best you dont need to do those petty things
i would love it if it was a downwardfacing ravens logo personally
sheetz up vote wawa down vote

dont we have a primetime game this week
personally i dont like primetime games now too late for me i prefer 1 oclock or 4 oclock
goodell hates us
can everyone on this sub just try to not be a victim for like a day
normally we play well in primetime but this year i like the 1 oclock games seems to always be a lot of injuries in night games for some reason
i prefer wednesday at 340 pm it just works for me
i dont like primetime games i can only watch till halftime got things to do the next day only exception is the super bowl and conference championship games
ravens washington bills bengals

we literally get 4 prime time games in a row

stop complaining


thats a quality voice crack from ben typiiiically
love this feel like we dont get much behind the scenes ben but ill take what i can get
ben is theee man
i couldnt understand a damn thing they said to each other but i really want more candid interactions between ben and other players though
since it seems like ben doesnt like taking qb sneaks how do you guys feel about putting rudolph in those situations the colts do the same thing by taking rivers out and putting brissett in i feel like teams know when a sneak is coming most of the time anyways and that shouldnt really effect converting on 4th and inches unless polamalu just shows up on the defense is this a feasible idea or am i just a moron for even thinking of it
wouldnt that be a big tipoff that were going to sneak

i wish dobbs would dress because i think he was a pretty dominant rushing qb in college
put rudolph in obvious sneak he two step drops and completes a slant to johnson td or he throws it over his head 5 yardsyou pick the story
rudolph doesnt need anymore blows to the head
if you want to put a guy under center who hasnt done it all year may as well put a rb in there for the sneak
brissett is a competent nfl qb i have such little faith in rudolph im scared to see him even take a snap
rudolph just needs to fade away nice kid but not nfl qb starter or sneaker material
i prefer plans that dont involve putting mason rudolph on the field
not every qb is a taysom hill

found this pretty interesting and whilst well be contributing to those numbers that combined with the awful past few outings have to give some food for thought in terms of changing our offensive approach
i like how you can tell most qbs are right handed by looking at this

what does this have to do with the steelers am i missing something


bud the bear i like it
getting paid while painting bears dude where do you work are they hiring haha
i am aware that the paintwork is shoddy we only had limited time and i am no artist


i agree they need to send juju deep more often he makes those plays and hes right they look like they are looking to get as much yards before they even catch the ball
the offense is relying on short passes and yac so it kind of makes sense that they are thinking about the next move before they actually catch the ball hopefully we can come out firing on all cylinders on sunday night
get it to juju more just dont be forcing it like ben always tried with ab we are a good team washington has a great d without half the drops we win that game
ideally i have always felt like i can run down field and catch those deep passes

this is interesting for some reason remember out of collegedraft that he preferred playing in the slot

im thinking well see him taking more snaps as an outside wr on sunday instead of dj maybe washington in the slot
i mean sure all of us want to watch ben throw the ball downfield to whoever

but with ben getting rid of the ball in 23 seconds we dont have road runner on the field if we want ben to throw the ball down the field he probably has held on to the ball for 5 seconds
compared to last year or two years ago the route tree i was running was a lot different this year everything is a lot shorter

our offense is so predictable with these short passes is it fichtners saying i want to protect ben at all costs or our ol is not good and thats why or i am unimaginative and this oc thing is over my head
what happened to chase claypools jet sweeps

they havent been watching the games like the first 23 worked but after that it has been shut down consistently
i would also like to see them throw deep to juju at least fucking once

mf should be back to back dpoy im not gonna even say anything about last year im still pissed
i see no lies here jj buttering up steelers nation for the off season trade too
best player on the team
being in columbus oh i can never say anything about watt being dpoy all people here say is but myles garett is better
but hes not doubled teamed as much
watt brothers manning brothers
it takes one to know one
whats crazy is jj is saying this without any bias whatsoever
preach
the browns will still say garrett
shouldnt even be a second thought
mvp
but the steelers are a weak 111
how are jj and tj both juniors
yo jj when you joining the steelers bruh
the fact he has nothing for derrick is insulting
gets held on every fucking play
now lets sign dereks newborn bj and maybe well finally have a competent fullback
tell that to everyone still beating off to aaron donald and act like tj aint shit because hes not a tackle taking on as many double teams fucking clowns the biggest tallest motherfuckers are offensive tackles and are clearly there to stop an edge rusher from doing just that rushing the edge yet he fucks their mom every play no lube
come on lets not kid ourselves you know theyre going to give it to the db on miami with eight picks or some bullshit it took james harrison having one of the greatest defensive seasons of all time to actually get dpoy for someone in black and gold
and gets held on most plays
idk i think they should give it to a corner with like 4 int again
yeah pff rates donald higher therefor tj is shit
wouldnt the nfl leader in sacks also likely be the leader in pressure qb hits and pass rush win not taking anything away from him but those stats all just go hand in hand isnt this like the nfl leader in interceptions also being the leader in interceptions return yards
are they triple teaming him cuz if not the guy who gets triple teamed is dpoty and its not close
a bit cocky my old self does not like that makes him seem narcissistic he can be cocky in more sportsmanlike and mature ways i am not offended and i really dont care as long as it motivates him to keep up the high level of performance

remember when there was a rolling rock ad in that film legendary
the giants are the opposite

bungles bung holes were two i always heard for the bengals
when the browns were really sucking everyone around here called them the mistake on the lake
the browns dont need a nickname browns is honestly bad enough on its own bengals are the bungles

its not really malicious but my family and i have called the chiefs the chefs since that old snickers commercial came out
i dont think the browns really need a nickname just calling them the browns is enough of an insult
browns the factory of sadness
clowns bungles
bungles bums youd probably have to ask on a raiders sub what the chief nicknames are
shitcinnati
bung holes bengals
the stains browns
ratbirds ravens
the chefs chiefs

the backstory of the chefs is the field painter of the chiefs painted chefs instead of chiefs on a snickers commercial
i used to call the browns the brownies first they were a treat to see on the schedule easy win second insinuates that they are little girls

i see bungles a lot for the bengals dont know of any for the chiefs gonna have to brainstorm for them
bengals are the bungles
browns are the factory of sadness
chiefs are the queefs
lol apparently some people have already thought of some

browns

bengals

chiefs

youve outdone yourself with this one man so great the little faces are so cute
well shit i love primantis and wings should be consumed at the same time if you ask me this isnt fair to frame this as an either or op
dude i just wanna say i fucking love and wait for these ever week theyre so damn cute and im glad youve kept it up
thats a tasty fuckin matchup right there i may have to get both and watch the game
you outdid yourself this time
as a steelers fan that was formed after going to pittsburgh and experiencing the steelers and pens for that matter first hand that lives in wny it feels wrong to pit wings and primati bros against one another but i will be making pittsburghers all weekend and making necessary sacrifices

great job on this one though for real my favorite one so far
this is my favorite yet
i want primantis now
well now im hungry
these make my week
this is the best one yet


again vinny

as if we werent already thin at lb plus vince had the green dot didnt he
imagine if we hadnt traded for williamson
fuck
our defense is becoming unrecognizable at this point right in time against a red hot offense in the bills fuck this
lol allen is about to pick us apart in the middle

edit ol is a position im really big on in the draft but i would not be surprised if we spend a high pick on a mlb
jesus were gonna start marcus allen arent we lol
yo football gods what the hell did this steelers linebacker group ever do to you
now is as good a time as any for the offense to figure out how to score points again
rip linebacking core
come on bince
fucking hell this is big no spillane and no vince

man
jesus fucking christ
so who will be calling plays avery
does this mean avery and minkah will be at linebacker and maybe sean davis getting more playing time at safety im scared and confused
sowhat mlb are active whos even left at this point avery marcus allen i guess and
someone kill me

cmon man
ug3 is back at practice at least
well fuck put in ben at lb lmaooo
fuck we have zero linebackers this is not good for the bills game fuck
time to sign 12 lbs to the practice squad
so are they gonna push back this game like 4 times for us now

yeah didnt think so
wasnt he on the list a little bit ago
with defensive starters missing at all three levels against a very good offense this week we may have to score 3540 points to win it lets see if ben and company can do it this is a big test for our offense it could be a blessing in disguise too they probably have no option but to open up the playbook
anyone got the updated injury list
wow we are getting thin at ilb
oh man who would be in line to start
pain
shit just keeps getting worse
f
why is shazier the thumbnail
time to just move edmunds into the box all game and have davis or hilton play the ss role kidding but also a little serious we need some sort of coverage ability in the box or this game is going to be ugly
fuck man i look forward to watching vince play every week guy is a monster gonna be a a scary one this weekend
jeez hope its just the close contacts list again theyre so thin that losing a guy like vince blows however this bills team isnt exactly the team i worry about losing him against
this is fucking bullshit
thanks ravens
actually a blessing
we all know he was going to be going up against diggs all day now we can play a db on him
might actually be a blessing in disguise because we need coverage linebackers to play against buffalo

so we have avery and bueller
who is up next elliott ugiii move edmunds ilb and bring in s davis as safety it is awful thin at ilb
the steelers have placed lb vince williams on the covid19 reserve list another hit to the lb group that will be without robert spillane

yessir lets just let ben be qb and oc for one game and see how the game changes
might as well try it against the bills with no linebackers we need an offense thats gonna score 40 points cant get worse
they need a new oline coach
im with moats our offense has plenty of opportunities to score points our guys arent executing thats not on the oc
give canada control
go duuuukes
i cant believe anyone has any doubt whatsoever whos running this offense and it aint rc this has been bens offense since haley left there is nothing new this season that wasnt on full display in 2018

claypool out today for illness

this is a fucking disaster
maybe marcus allen shines i really think he has potential
we are losing pieces every week damn
the highlighter is dreadful

and every team is dealing with this crap lets focus on what we can focus on

so thats not good either
fucking nightmare bro
ughhhhhh terrible timing for all of this theres gotta be some kind of bubble put into place for playoffs
james washington 250 yard game incoming
im watching juju on twitch right now and he said claypool has the bubble guts haha

covid can sometimes cause gi upset but im hoping he just ate something that didnt agree with him and hell be good to go
wormley was out yesterday with an illness and back today so i dont read too much into it
that sucks
remember how close the game was last year the bills were arguably better last year too
shit shit shit shit
hey i mean if we have depth at any position its receiver
joe haden and robert spillane out chase claypool expected to play profootballtalk nbcsportscom

damn these are great job
i love the look with the black background on ben
wouldnt mind adding that tj to my collection either
i also got one for my father this christmas ill show it when it arrives
where are these from
awesome

i dont think this was a criticism of ben many of us here were saying the same thing given how little practice time the wrs and ben seemed to have the past couple weeks
thats what ive been saying but another thing that would probably help more is being less predictable randy
i think thats a fair assessment outside of juju this receiving group has limited experience with him
im sticking to blaming fichtner
maybe johnson and ebron should try playing without their gloves in the cold weather allegedly those modern gloves get slick and lose their grip when its cold out i think bleier made a similar suggestion
well ben is the only starting qb in the nfl who takes off every wednesday each week brady and brees both who are older than ben take every practice snap

ben has way too much say in this organization he raises the team with his play but his ego also holds us back
so its not just on the field that fichtner makes poor decisions its an odd choice to criticize the person who is one of the main reasons you still have a job
randy is such a idiot i can name 5 reasons off the top of my head why it isnt bens fault but im tired of wasting time talking about this dogshit coordinator
hi guys and happy holidays to all

i heard that big ben is only thinking about himself cause he keeps changing the plays when theres a running playi think others should call plays and why is it fichners fault when ben keeps changing the playsguys if a play is called the players have to executei say blame it on the players to not just the 1 calling the playsgo steelers
you obviously never watch football
ok mbc
is this just a very strange but elaborate troll post
youre either stupid or a troll either way get back under your bridge
im blaming you
what in the actual fuck
how much crack did you smoke before posting this

or maybe this is fichtners burner account
i heard that randy fichtner has been putting kick me signs on bens back all throughout the week and ben isnt too happy so hes intentionally sabotaging the offense to get fichtner fired just a rumor i heard on tv
1610 troll effort
what a shitty troll job
nice try but not enough troll

can he play linebacker
birth stats 27 lbs 28 oz 1 sack
bj watt

bout to give a whole new meaning to wattsup hell yeah you will be 4 times a night every two hours worth it though congratulations
brayden ugh
now maybe the experience of carrying a baby will translate to him doing literally anything on the field

im not big into college can someone tell me bout leatherwood
as both a florida fan and a steelers fan my dream pick has to be kyle trask
ive heard of leatherwood but i havent read anything of the other ot i just want a good run blocker for the draft
dont follow college but oline is a must unless some top guy falls to us for some reason
kind of surprised to see folks in on leatherwood over slater
i feel like you have to draft oline if you dont grab any in free agency we can get a quality rb later in the rounds
other than ol shaun wade is on my list
im actually completely okay if we completely focus on revamping our oline i love those
guys but they are in a decline
as their first round pick of the ones listed i think the only ones worth a first round pick based on positional value and individual production are slater leatherwood and jones

but i think you could grab mac in the second or early third if they trade up so i guess either ot in the first
boys we take leatherwood and run
ol please
as someone who watches every northwestern game id like to stake a claim that i think rashawn slater ends up being the second offensive lineman taken and his perceived stock will be consensus top10 before too long

slater went through some growing pains after an excellent debut as the starting left tackle for northwestern in the 2019 season opener at stanford especially dealing with bendy quick guys that said despite getting beat a couple of times he put together a nice game when he went against chase young last year and has only gotten better in his second season as the starter
najee harris would be nice
javonte williams north carolina rb
1 jets
2 eagles
3 steelers
4 bengals
5 bears

i think for most of the season many of us were glossing over the true performance of the offense theyre averaging close to 30 points a game well yeah because weve got an amazing defense that consistently sets up the offense with more drives and shorter fields were currently 3rd in the nfl in average starting position


were 24th in yards per play 29th in rushing yards per attempt and dead last in yards per completion below the bengals giants and bears time to hit the reset button
god if we had 2016 defense we would be fucked or 17 made blake bortales drop 45 on us
alright youve hit the reset button now what what does that mean

are you saying to cut ben fire fichtner pick rb round 1 or 2 bench ebron move around our oline
yards dont matter when youre scoring well were consistently given good field position from returns and turnovers as well

they better analytically catch the fucking ball
i know there are a lot of people who are rightfully concerned after the last 2 games but to me at least this just feels like one of those games that we win possibly in a dominant fashion look back to 2017 played a shitty game against the jacoby brisset led 37 colts and only won by 3 points the following week they blew the doors off of the 64 titans 4017 then in 2018 we lose on the road to the 310 raiders then beat the patriots the next week this is prime time in a key game against a very good team after an ugly loss im not saying they are a lock to win but it just feels like this is one of those big rebound games
so did the model not account for all the injuries on our defense
the lack of a run game has something to say to the analytical model
thats sounds incredibly stressful lol
cool now if i could play all of our games on madden we could be 160 i might quit a couple times to make sure that record stays intact
well thats not a heart attack score at all
looks like an ulcer is back on the menu boys and girls
if we beat the bills rnfl will say its because the bills arent that good

great jersey my man born and raised steeler fan that lives in the burgh heresteelernation all over the worldi love itgo steelers
so i want that same jersey but i want the stitched letters one instead of the silk screen can someone send me a link or explain the name difference between the 2 jerseys when you google jerseys there are like 10 different nameskinds
absolutely
the 711 connection got say

funny story i once got yelled at by my coach bc i hastily grabbed number 17 instead of 11

nevertheless nice jersey

thats awesome i had a slash poster on my wall growing up it listed him as a punter too
hey man he was my favorite player as a kid so relevent thats awesome
the way some people treated him was just awful he gave it his all every time he stepped on the field not even close to the best qb the steelers had but i still remember his time being at the helm of some good teams that were fun to watch
thats really awesome the only jersey ive had was a kordell jersey i wore the heck out of when i was a kid too so i kinda get that feel wore it until the letters peeled wow
thats pretty cool i too was probably around the age of 10 when i got my first jersey which was also a kordell jersey
lol its called pittsburgheeze you ass hat grammarbot
i found an away jersey at goodwill when i lived in wisconsin and out of all my jerseys its the one i get the most compliments on
fav steelers of all time drew a picture of him when i was 6 or 7 when visiting my aunt in pittsburgh my aunt who worked as head of volunteering department at upmc was able to get her steelers contact to sign it and personalize it for me for a christmas present one of my fav gifts
oh man thats awesome i dont really buywear jerseys anymore but for some reason i always liked the feel of these older replica jerseys kind of thin made out of the material that basketball shorts are made out of
when i was little my first jersey was a levon kirkland jersey about 2 years ago i finally took a trip to pittsburgh and they actually had a bunch in one of the shops pretty cool to find it after not being able to fit in my old one for so long lol i feel you on this
maybe i should of commented on his park incidentlol
he was a good runner and evader but really never had the arm strength or accuracy just sayin

who is that for those of us who dont memorize faces
i dont know faces really well is this donte moncrief
i was expecting swede
dionte moncreif and ebrick ebron
please if you think thats the problem then you aint been watching the 3rd quarter
first of all his play hasnt even been bad were one of the league leaders in drops randy fichtner is calling the plays we have no run game and the offensive line is quickly aging sure the deep passes havent been there but hes clearly still got it i dont see how this rough patch can be appointed to him in any way
its not all on him but he certainly was responsible for a part of our loss the pick 6 before the half and the under thrown ball to washington which was picked off was on him both of those plays killed us more than any other on offense
i dont blame himbut i do wonder if he can make all the throws anymore theres a reason why they throw so short all the time with the occasional deep arcing pass but the 1520 yard frozen rope passes arent there

it could be play calling but i have a sneaky suspicion that its his elbowarm that doesnt allow him to throw those passes i mean everyone can see the passing treeincluding them
we suck on offense period its as bad as last year in the last month
even he blames himself doesnt mean its all his fault but it is his fault
watching the game was a pretty good way for people to see that ben is to blame how can people not blame ben is the real question though i suspect the correct answer that people tend to be biased towards making excuses for players especially the biggest stars and scapegoating coaches is something that people wont ever admit which ironically further proves that the answer is correct

it was almost poetic when collinsworth was pointing out that it was clear roethlisberger was the one calling plays in no huddleand ben instantly threw his second int of the day just as bad of a throw as the first one i wondered what that would do to the fans in this sub who make excuses for the biggest stars like ben and scapegoat coaches like randy how silly of me to think that it would change anything

fichtner has obviously been doing terribly too opening the game 3 and out again is inexcusable the offense barely even looks like a prostyle offense anymore roethlisberger refuses to throw it past 10 yards into the middle of the field and its bizarre theres a lot of fluky short plays to mccloud or the backup rb whether its mcfarland or samuels and nothing to open up the field with all the receivers its a mess of too many issues at the same time and while scapegoating the coach and assuming the biggest stars are doing everything right is always the default opinion for a lot of fans the truth is everyone is sucking roethlisberger is right at the top of the list along with fichtner diontae johnson every other pass catcher for being unable to regularly create separation and the ol
randy and ben work together ben has a ton of control over the offense cant blame one without blaming the other
its pretty clear he cant consistently push the ball down the field or to the outside anymore unless he has an absolutely pristine pocket that allows him to really step into his throws

that throw to washington last night was underthrown by about 10 yards and he even had decent space to make it 2018 roethlisberger or most above average qbs put that ball out in front of washington and just a little bit more inside and its 6

the pick6 at the end of the half was a bad throw but just as concerning was the out route to claypool immediately prior to that he had plenty of time and space to make that throw he started to throw on time and in rhythm and it just didnt get there

the coaching staff is showing their concern through their actions too after the pick6 they had 50 seconds two timeouts and a field goal immediately grabs back momentum but they just decided not to even make an attempt claypool hasnt dropped anywhere near as many balls as guys like ebron and dj yet claypool has seen his snap share plummet in recent weeks why might that be because they know that hes basically a glorified decoy out there right now

the offensive line has been a problem too but the things are interrelated the run blocking has been bad but roethlisbergers refusal to go under center also makes really difficult to get a good running game going the lack of a running game just allows defensive linemen to teeoff on the oline knowing they can play the unlikely run on the way to the pass
you cant blame ben for most drops but there have been a few passes each game that are behind the wr and they have to make a tough adjustment to have a shot at catching it i cant blame them for a drop in that situation its a lot harder to adjust to throws behind you when theyre short throws because you have almost no time to react deeper throws are much easier to adjust to

that being said ben is horribly inaccurate this year especially in the deep game hes consistently throwing outside to guys running deep inside and throwing back inside to guys running deep outside both cases mean defenders are able to easily catch up and make a play hes been underthrowing a lot lately too

i dont think his arm strength is an issue like people expected though he still shows great arm strength once or twice a game but hes just not interested in throwing the 1020 yard intermediate stuff anymore its either throw a 5yard pass on 1st or 2nd and long then on 3rd and short he throws a 40yard offtarget bomb and its either incomplete or intercepted

we cant win games with 35 play drives our defense is being relied on way too much its honestly like watching last years team all over again

i also think people give ben a pass because he was playing well earlier in the year but thats because teams werent adjusting to the quick passes and we werent asking him to do a whole lot now that the pressure is on hes playing horrible football but people refuse to lay any blame at his feet because he makes a couple decent throws and thats all they remember in addition to the drops

blame randy all you want but hes not the one underthrowing a deep bomb on 3rd and short with 7 minutes to go needing two scores most play calls have at least five routes to choose from randy isnt telling a 20year qb who to throw to every play
lol people got to understand that the reason our playcalling is so conservative is because of ben thats why we are also last in playaction
you should have stopped at randy is calling the plays the sole reason he has a job is because ben can do whatever he wants the pick before the end of the half vs ten the pick against the back up ravens a few weeks ago the pick last night his decision making and play is troubling not to mention the continued batted balls from a 65 qb sure the deep passes havent been there is an exact issue its probably part of the reason the offense has been throwing quick passes dropped passes do not help ben however a majority of these dropped passes have been 35 yards which again points out the issue of throwing the ball downfield yeah he is part of the blame how in the hell couldnt you its ok to be critical of ben and still like him he has to play better but at this point in his career i am not sure he can whereas years before he could
80 on ben the 2 most important parts of a football game are the 2 min before and after halftime ben gave them all the momentum in the world worst throw ive seen all year including the titans and ravens ints thrown way behind juju you mean to tell me he cant throw deep hes immobile as fuck and cant complete short passes in the windows they need to be made ben is old man hes wrapped up what sucks is we are probably stuck with him for another year gotta draft ol and pray to the football gods we strike gold in the later rounds but ben will not lead us to 7
he was garbage last night hes playing on a bum knee of course problem is hes going to make like 40 mil next year and be even worse i hate to say it but hes done
its a team sport no sole player or coach is to blame everyone can do more ben is certainly not the reason were losing these last two games but he also isnt flawless this offense hasnt practiced a lot together over the last few weeks and it can lead to inconsistencies and missed timing the whole offense is one dimensional and ben plays a huge role in the play selectionaudibledeciding who to throw to he hasnt looked the same since that cowboys game


i would like to take this time to anyone that wants to read

after the two losses endured by the wft and the bills i took the time to rewatch each game and there is really no other reason the steelers lost but play calling and game plan everyone can be quick to jump in conclusions of refs and rightfully so on some of the callsnoncalls but this is a normal for every fan in the league and every team has to endure big ben is playing well the defense is managing their assignments well the oline is not the problem the wide receivers and their drops are not the problem

the problem is randy fichtner and his terrible game plans
1i do not understand how there isnt a 1015 yard route in the playbook until the 4th quarter

2an inside zone run on a zerostunted oline blocking scheme every time is not the answer to the running woes

3 a quick passing offense is not effective without the illegal picks thrown into the mix randy is trying to be the patriots of old where he picks apart a defense underneath to open the bigger plays but does it without the effectiveness of opening up the routes

4 there is no reason to open up in a 45 wide set and have everyone run at most 5 yards up field and turn around

5 the run does not work because every db has the luxury to play up towards the line 80 of the game due to the quick pass offense this allows the defense tons of flexibility to blitz inside and disrupt the run

6 either the whole steelers offense is in on the game plan of protect ben at all costs and dont adjust to a defensive game plan where he is allowed to operate or they are completely delusional in trying to be something they are not built for this offense can easily be effective in a pass centric offense if the game plan was to to allow the receivers to play like receivers and run a multiple concepts on the same play i havent seen a double more than twice all season or a play across the middle greater than 10 yards that wasnt meant to draw a pi on a heave by ben every route is either a 5 yard out hitch slant or drag 75 of the time it makes absolutely no sense randy has been incompetent in the past but it has never been like this he tried something new and it was figured out as it should have been now is the time to adjust and work towards holding the ball more than 2 seconds on a play i refuse to believe the o line is so bad that they cannot consistently block for ben

i wish i knew how to link plays legally so i can point out individual plays where calls were awfully prepared but i do not have the capability

anyone that stuck around for the rant thanks for reading i may be overreacting but i truly believe the only reason the offense is failing is due to style the offense plays individual player woes are expected and can be overcome this offense scheme is not a championship offense running at 100 perfection and needs to be adjusted
1 first few series are scripted by coaches and ben the people making the calls clearly should be fired from that job the reason there are no 1015 yard plays until the end of the game 4th quarter are because ben just doesnt have time for that route until the 4th when the other team is in max protect against chunk plays ben is fastest to throw in the league because his life depends on it pouncey cant block probably because his kneethey he didnt want to get operated in because he is late in his career isnt 100 and so he cant train a lot decastro a knees were shot coming into the season they wanted to sit him longer but they had injuries on that side and he came back early then he tore his core muscles and hasnt been able to hold a block that wasnt straight at him since he came back today was probably the day decastro got benched not because bad but because hes playing nowhere near 100 and was in ther out of necessity but then feiler blew out his pec or shoulder and dotson had to fill in then dotson had basically he same injury so because its a fast pass offense one safety mid depth 4 rushers everyone else is 8 yards deep waiting for a route to tackle someone quick

2 they insist on letting ben play from the shotgun so when they do go under center its a joke and everyone knows its a run so the entire team is in a goal line defense with one safety deep just in case if they ran from under center they could be in a 3 point stance and go pass or run from a single back set still have the rb protect ben and the defense wouldnt know if its pass or run it makes the defenders guess and make assumptions which is better than a delay hand off or a straight up hand off from shotgun and 2 pt stance blocking

3 randy and ben are emulating everything they ever saw and liked ben kept calling ryan switzer his edelman early in ryans tenure here ben loved that wubby like he was performing like edelman then you have that stupid td attempt to a o lineman they saw cleveland do it when baker had 4 tds and they wanted to show that we could do the same stupid play they never run that never practice it and i guarantee it was thrown in last min bc cleveland did it and i wouldnt be surprised if its code name was bm or some combo of bakermayfieldcleveland in their playbook
4 ben will die if he holds it long enough to go 6 yards we saw the penetration tonight when he held longer than 22 seconds
5 they cant run because they cant block they cant block because they are in shotgun every down which is a dont yield but basically no push stance for even athletic and strong linemen let alone old and injured ones that wont change until they make ben play under center which wont happen

6 they are all in on it because its all they can manage if they could do anything else they would but they dug this hole by throwing so much weeks 111 and now with no ability to run block and no one expecting random runs they wont be able to fool anyone into a formation that enables them to successfully run block washington sent 4 most downs and they still couldnt run block even when they had an extra man on the line still in shitgun so this is going to be a dan bylsma type early exit in the playoffs
6 either the whole steelers offense is in on the game plan of protect ben at all costs and dont adjust to a defensive game plan where he is allowed to operate

yes
great posti just hurt inside
we still all have to realize 3 games in 12 days its not the nba these guys gotta feel beat we saw that bills line take over the run game in the second half unfortunately the nfl has taken away 2nd place byes so i dont see this getting better for these guys
1i do not understand how there isnt a 1015 yard route in the playbook until the 4th quarter

there is the qb wont throw it
i think alot of the play calling is an issue of personnel ben cant throw a deep ball to save his life hes way too old to get the job done and he doesnt have the speed to really open up the play action offensive live is a trainwreck of its own but ben and the ol are the 2 mains reasons the play calling is what it is imo

he is being a good sport would you rather have bradys bitch ass who runs off the field without a second thought this loss sucks major balls and we all have a right to be upset but lets not transition into some whiney ass bags over shit like this
im not going to criticize the guy for having good sportsmanship they beat us and more so allen hung in there and got it done he deserves praise for a nice win
am i missing something
not sure why people hate on congratulating the team that beat us obviously they were better
man this sub has a bunch of fucking whiners this morning
amazing he didnt miss the highfivehandshakeor drop his jacket in the process
what is going on in the background
they are praying in the background ebron being a good sport as well this sucks but there are things bigger than winning
i think he made sure to do it during the interview so he can be on tv but to criticize him for showing good sportsmanship is asinine


ebron is a bum worst part about him is he thinks hes such a tough guy cant catch a damn cold unpopular opinion we should have kept jesse james a few years ago no big play ability but always solid now we have two tight ends with big play ability who cant catch

sorry bens boy aint gettin fired hell be here next season accept it and move on aint happening

take my upvote for a meme featuring a guy who was on two of my favorite tv shows ever and i hear hes rumored to be in consideration for jeopardy host

funny side note my auto complete wanted to capitalize considerations because of how many jokes i make about that being the last name of the pirates favorite trade target

love our team but their cockiness has to stop
juju shouldnt have been dancing on their logo

why its paint on a field who gives a shit if buffalo had a problem with it stop him while hes doing it they didnt or make him pay during the game they didnt

acting like him doing it had some effect on the game is dumb it didnt
he dances on every logo including the steelers this isnt a hockey locker room
he shouldnt have done that its disrespectful and not his style
oh lord did you just post something critical of juju on this subreddit of all places god save your karma because that shit is about to take a nosedive
im trying to stay positive by thinking about who could be our next oc when randy is let go this offseason

its clear to me that bens arm isnt going to allow for him to lead the offense like he once did and even once hes gone i think an olrun game would benefit a possible rookie qb

anthony lynn may be fired this offseason hes been on the hotseat and go check out their debacle yesterday running with no timeouts left

lynn was only an oc for part of 1 season before being promoted to interim hc in buffalo but hes been the rb coachassthchc of several impressive running games

in buffalo his offenses revolved around lesean mccoy who some thought might be on the downside of his career after being traded from philly eric wood and incognito made a couple pro bowls under lynn his first season for the chargers he took 2 guards on day 2 of the draft and leaned on melvin gordon and eventually austin ekeler for offense
anthony lynn is a terrible coach i wouldnt hire him to coach my sons little league team
when randy is let go this offseason

please dont get my hopes up like that
sorry to burst your bubble but as long as ben is the qb randy aint going nowhere

edit they also got canada that is creative when it comes to calling offense dont see a point of bringing somebody else when you got him on staff
im not sure why you talk about fichtner being let go as a when and not an if
rather have bill o
never heard of her
steelers promote from within its canadas job if the team moves on from good ol randy
go to hell
matt canada is already on the team
randy needs fired but this is not the answer at all
have you seen his clock management

you sir are plain stupid hes holding us hostage really who do u suggest starts ill wait u must not remember last year it was 10 short days ago we were also 110 and we are 112 now this is the stupidest post ive seen on this sub possibly
do you remember what we looked like in 2019 lmao
from what i saw the problem isnt ben playcalling has been pathetic at best ben has been overthrowing guys downfield i wouldnt say hes washed

the ol is injured we literally had nobody to go in if anyone else got hurt at the end of the game thats why we are not passing it deep we cant stop the blitz for long enough to get guys downfield
wait what is this bait if anything the recievers are holding ben hostage by dropping balls lmao
youre the same guy that wouldve cheered when bradshaw got injured in 83 its people like you that make steelers fans almost as bad as philadelphia fans and the reason ben isnt going to associate with pittsburgh after he retires
ill be honest we all bitched and moaned about duck and mason last year this offense doesnt look much better right now bens arm is toast he cant throw anything past 10 yards and every team knows this every deep pass is comically under thrown its why claypool has disappeared teams are literally loading the box to stop the pass and run ben needs to go he is 100 holding us hostage
before the game i read an article as im sure many of u did as well that the steelers are concerned about bens knee injury to a pretty high degree after the game i read stuff where now it kind of makes sense and its clicked to where i now see it i think it was the jaguars game he hurt his knees since then the offense has i could be completely wrong seemed to drastically change to this short passing all the time because he doesnt have the leg drive to get behind some throws like the deep ball ie the one he got picked off when under throwing washington last night he didnt seem to have much zip on his throws this is just my thought but this may be part of the reason for the awful game plan

doesnt make sense tho as to why we have abandoned the run game when conner was getting and still should get 20 touches a game something just isnt right and its mind boggling dont use our fullback and have become completely one dimensional just how and why the offense was doing well and then boom stop again i just dont get it
you have a point but that still doesnt explain why ben has avoided deep and intermediate routes between the numbers all season
the dallas game is where ben went down close to the end of the first half and mason saw some snaps hes been hurt since that game
if the issue is bens health and i think there is a valid reason to think it is at least in part a health issue then sit him next week maybe two the difference between the 2 through 5 seed has never meant less if a portion of the issue is his health then let him get healthy and eat the potential losses

but my sense is that its more than just health or just recent health the scheme is a problem as well and its a mutually destructive process they may need to get more of a max protect going three receivers running routes allowing a back or te to leak out as a late valve just running the receivers more than 6 yards down the field even if you cant always hit them will help to push back safeties and lbs seattle and tennessee are great examples of this you also need to get roethlisberger under center more but that may be hard if his knees are shot and makes the time off more important
youre not wrong but people keep talking about abandoning the run game their oline has been playing so poorly that they just have to abandon it conner gets hit by 3 players before he gets back to the los

for better or worse diontae is the teams most explosive receiver juju just isnt able to be a deep threat and is now a possession receiver idk whats going with claypool but now ben is falling apart
the main thing is we clinched a play off spot though it definitely sucks we lost

no way we drop this cincinnati game no matter how bad we look we already smoked them when they had burrow we just need to go 1 week at a time and get a victory this monday

edit changed weekend to monday
you realize the bills are the best team weve played all season and with a pick 6 we still only lost by 11

realistically we need to draft linemen
daily qb post came in early today i see
if ben goes this offseason go get stafford but we need to be spending our first round pick on the oline if there is still value later in the round
lol hurts
if we have a shot at drafting trask and the bigger first round linemen are all gone i wouldnt mind that at all i can just see the pats or some other team picking any qbs we want before us
phili aint giving up hurst
people voting for darnold do you really see him having success in our offense i havent seen him enough to form an opinion
if we can grab darnold or trubisky for a 3rd pick id do it the o line is a big concern pounce and decastro are corner stones that are aging i would see what value they hold in the trade market and send them off if the price is right the running back position reminds me of the last year with mendenhall and that collection of backs good compliments but no main ingredients i would give mcfarland some more reps so he can get comfortable in the o he always seems to anxious to make a big play because hes not in very much just my opinion im sure it will get ripped apart
im trying to find it but in 2016 or 2017 or so nfl network or espn or one of those generic mainstream sports media outlets made a lets look some years ahead to the best qbs of 2020 clickbait article predictably the list consisted of the best qbs of the day but older late 30s rodgers and matt ryan and mid30s cam newton and russell wilson carson wentz was a hot name at the time and they probably loved the few games a rookie desean watson played too no patrick mahomes no consideration of the fact that other qbs would be drafted in the future like baker mayfield josh allen lamar jackson kyler murray justin herbertit was really basically a list of current nfl qbs only focusing on names we knew at the time and not what was clearly most likely to happen younger qbs come out in subsequent years and play well

all of this to say is that the steelers next franchise qb after ben is certainly not in the league right now and is unlikely to be drafted in 2021
have faith in rudolph

if i dont play good enough football then i need to hang it up roethlisberger said postgame when asked if the steelers could regain their form but i still feel like i can do enough things to help this team win football games and im going to do everything i can to get us back on track

its clickbait headlines like these that use only half the quote that make people less informed than if they were to read the full quote or even nothing at all
if he hangs it up or not this offseason we have to figure out our plan for the future after this season
ben is playing scared i dont know if its because hes hurt or his arm doesnt feel as good as he tries to tell everyone it does but he isnt playing like ben

i am tired of seeing the quick release stat on a man who used to hold the ball for 5 seconds running around like a lunatic to ensure receivers were able to get open awesome hes not getting sacked but we arent moving the ball either

the team collectively said they deserved respect when they were undefeated and have proven in three straight weeks why absolutely no one showed them respect
ah yes the yearly i should think about retiring speech
paraphrasing but he did say in his youtube series that hes accomplished everything hes set out to do hes just sticking around for the young guys to help them win
i dont know if age is catching up with him and this is truly his last rodeo or if its just a phase and perhaps external issues just have him off his game tough to say luckily a game against cincy should get him back on track
then fuckin hang it up already so we can move the fuck on
at this point lets lose out accept the first round playoff loss and hope like hell we can get someone like kyle trask somehow i sorta want ben for another year or two tho just for the sake of tutoring whatever qb comes along plus this defense is way too good to waste their primes
this game was all on you ben be better man
removed
lets face reality our defense even with all the injuries is still balling and the best in the league our sts are vastly improved and above average

the main reason our offense sucks is our pathetic oline yes you can blame playcalling bens mindlapses drops and rbs but the origin of most of these problems is still our line we dont go deep because our line cant keep ben upright for long we cant run because we dont go deep and cant run block to save our lives

the most disgusting thing is that pouncey and decastro who are barely average are among the highest paid players on the team and make like 25m combined we really need to think about their future with the team going forward
when ben lined up over center the entire buffalo d everyone watching on tv and the commentators knew they were running it i think ben lined up over center less than 10 times who did fitchner think he was foolin

no matter what it is oline or scheme when 80 of your plays are throwing under 10 yds youre gonna get beat eventually welcome to the 21st century we have video

x200b

i was really hoping tomlinfitchner would have the o come out changed up 2 te run play action throw down field saving that stuff for the playoffs
absolutely did you notice how much our line improved when dotson came in and then how much it fell apart when he came out that dude is gonna develop like crazy i couldnt stand hearing collinsworth say literally every play and theyre making it work with a backup at guard
i couldnt help but notice that pff ranks pouncey as the worst center in the last 2 years i normally dont care for pff rankings but thats kinda jarring
only thing you are missing is the fact we have zero play action ability
i think its more scheme than oline talent and last night was a perfect example of why our offense doesnt work when the defense is keying in on the short pass game guess what they play close to the line see 910 defenders on the line of scrimmage for buffalo well when every single defender is within 1 yard of the line of scrimmage it is extremely difficult to run the ball as we have seen over the past few games i cant remember a single run where conner wasnt contacted first in the backfield

imo this all stems from ben not being able to throw the ball down the field anymore its clear defenses have keyed in on the short passing game yet no adjustments have been made i dont think this is lack of strategic ability for the steelers i think it is lack of throwing ability by our qb

i love ben and hes been our qb for basically my entire life but you can only fight father time for so long
sure i can agree with most of this but honestly the offense really isnt that good as a unit we absolutely positively cannot run block its probably the worst ive ever seen it was a matter of time before these flaws got exposed even though we were on a streak i never felt comfortable whats bothering me the most today isnt the loss its another one of bens drama remarks about retiring
i got ridiculed and downvoted to hell on this sub for saying our offense was going to go to shit when munchak left i wish i wasnt right but it was way too obvious and apparently nobody within the organization realized it either
lets face it when the steelers were averaging 122 yards a game it had more to do with connor overachieving and the pass game when it was not only a 3 yard pass
i am all here for the unsexy draft that should be 2021 give me all the olineman throw in a rb as well
decastro is fine

pouncey tho is grading out as the worst starting center in the league im not sure if its just slowing down with age and injuries be he just isnt the mean athletic guy he was even 2 years ago
yunz acting like were 211 yeah we look bad we have a lot of starters injured and are in triage mode we have some time to figure it out we will be in the playoffs and we wont be getting a bye so lets just relax
the 3 games in 12 days has undoubtedly wreaked havoc on this team the defense besides missing obvious starters due to injury was getting moved by the bills in the second half joe haden wasnt there to cover diggs tj watt wasnt setting the edge on runs the o line is old and hurt and that never helps in the run game i think the most important part to realize is that there was no way the steelers could come up with and change any scheme on either side of the ball in that short amount of time how many days of practice have they even had over these past 3 games
i understand the importance of a line but our line and most of our offense was healthy last year with the exception of ben and our offense is looking exactly the same as when mason was out there just not intimidating to the opposing defense
the scheme and the oc are the problem the oline rbs wrs dropping passes and playcalls are bad too dont get me wrong but this scheme and the oc need to change immediately if they have any chance at winning another game to lock the division let alone a super bowl this team cannot win a playoff game right now this is not an 112 team its more like a 85 team that got 23 really lucky wins
i keep seeing a lot of missed tackles and opponents running wide open in the secondary this defense over the past 4 or 5 years is great on paper but anyone who watches them knows theyre overrated
ol and ben
i think pittsburgh really ought to draft a qb this year bens aging fast i cant see him playing beyond 202223 which means now would be a great time to select a qb and have them sit behind ben like mahomes did in kc who could the steelers reasonably expect to draft fields and lawrence or wilson will be gone early but after that i see a gap where im not sure a qb gets selected for a bit
draft offensive lineman and cb this draft worry about a qb next year why because it gonna matter if we draft a qb if they cant run block and pass protect for more than 22 seconds fixing the line is the most important thing right now
will draft somewhere in the back third there isnt likely to be a franchise qb available then

realistically whats going to happen is ben will lay an egg next season and we get a high draft pick or we punt a season with rudolph at the helm and then draft a qb early either way tomlin is going to have to have his first losing season before we can draft bens real replacement
were better off taking players who can help immediately then tank for a year when ben does retire so they can get a topshelf rookie
signing dak prescott coming off his injury is my dream
we gotta pray we can strike gold in the later rounds its too important to fix ol right now but i do agree bens time here in pittsburgh is over
ive heard some things about trey lance or kyle trask
steelers should inquire about trading for jameis winston hes only 26 and is a decent qb yeah he does have a tendency for interceptions but he also threw for over 5000 yards and a ton of tds a few years back

besides there likely will be no great qbs available where the steelers will likely pick
2022 is shaping up to be a lower year for qbs in the draft so this is probably the better year to do it and were likely to see at least 4 qbs in the first round and as many as 6 depending on trask and mac jones its also a really good year for ots in the draft so if ever there was a year to try and move up in either the 1st or 2nd round this is it but even later in the draft you have guys like kellen mond brock purdy and jamie newman who will all be solid project qbs

i think kyle trask could be a great qb to sit behind ben next season and then try him out in 2022 as the starter ideally travis etienne falls to the steelers in the first round this year but if not then give me qb and ot in the first two rounds
say it with me boys daaaaaaaasaak
there is no qb without our draft position and the cost to trade up would be huge we need all new linemen and theres a much better shot at one being available at our possible draft positions
guys getting a qb now is what the bungles did they got a great qb but had zero line to block for him and he almost died back there and his career could actually be over no qb can operate with this line able to block for only 23 seconds before collapsing from every angle we need to get offensive linemen first
if trey lance is there you have to take him kyle trask is a good option as well

i dont care but it has to be either offensive line or qb in the first round i understand the steelers like taking the best player available but the qb and offensive line positions are in need of dire help
phil jurkovec
as an iowa state fan i definitely would not be opposed to drafting brock purdy if he was available in the 3rd or later
offensive lineman draft fixed it for you
notre dames quarterback is gonna be in the black and gold next year
i wouldnt be opposed to kyle trask if he was available odds are he wont end up being the long term guy but dak prescott was a mid round pick who also played for dan mullen in college and that worked out well
teams i see drafting qbs

sure things nyj jacksonville chicago

likely denver detroit new england

maybe san francisco philadelphia las vegas carolina

unlikely indianapolis minnesota cleveland atlanta
trade for darnold sit behind ben a year rebuilding his psyche now we have a low cost qb that can play

draft rb ol possibly cb

resign spillane let dupree and haden walk

this is the way
mason the next brady rudolph give him some time in the pocket and let him sling it to washington and chase all day
trade for darnold

this year i think this is a bit more representative of the issues ive seen in the passing game this season
so im beginning to think the passing game is structured around what ben is capable of doing hes started looking his age lately im not even sure he could throw many consistent passes beyond 58 yards to be totally honest
from all the highs and lows of yesterday leave your final thoughtsanalysisdiscussiontakeaways from yesterdays game

this thread is intended for levelheaded mindful discussion and less kneejerk reactions keep this in mind before commenting

as always dont be a damn jagoff follow our rules we all have different opinions and mindsets but were all here to talk steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day keep it cool
our offensive line deserves way more blame than im seeing you know why the run game isnt working do you know why we have to throw quick passes all the time

the oline is getting absolutely wrecked on pass protection and run blocking
week after week the same two issues persist

no run game

cannot throw deep

teams dont respect the deep ball so they suffocate intermediatequick routes and we cant move absolutely stuck in the run game again these are the exact same two issues that carry over week to week and we cannot fix it absolutely zero improvement i truly do not see how things get better at this point when this has been the same story week after week losing dotson feiler and chuks will only make it worse

in addition we went 110 on 3rd down

coaching staff lived in their fears and didnt play to win to end the first half not going for it on 4th in bills territory

this was bens worst game of the year

everything just piled up and left us with that performance last night missing joe vince and spillane was awful though i thought avery played pretty damn well

tldr we have a super bowl defense with an offense that cannot be trusted
i was more crushed when i got the feeling the steelers were giving up towards the end of the half it was bad enough that nothing on the offense was changing and then to look at some of the defense look like they were lost or didnt care just killed me

steelers have to find away to run the ball the offense needs to carry a little bit of slack for all the defense has given
who knew 112 could feel like this
well i hope we can beat the bungles but at this rate it will be a close game
sometimes you got to take your lumps it never feels good at the time but it happens in the nfl im hopeful well turn it around and make a real push in the post season but it isnt going to be easy and it shouldnt be easy here we go
we did not peak at the right time of the season
there were a few users on this sub that would vehemently argue with me about randys ability as an offensive coordinator and i still remember one of them even went so far as to say that randy is a good oc this experiment where we let bens best friend be our oc and give ben basically full control to do what he wants is souring very fast

the way i see it these next three weeks are the time where these two prove that this can work and actually function as an offense because right now i think we should definitely fire randy in the offseason and find a real oc regardless of how much ben will bitch about it if we had todd haley we would be in a much better spot right now im convinced of that say whatever the fuck you want about the fucking red zone but in some of these games being able to sustain drives and get at least three points would have definitely put us in a much better position to win games these past 2 weeks
hot take we lost the game but i wish we had won
i was going to come in here and write an essay about this team and their offense woes but its already been said


i will say though that i truly believe this should be bens last year either he retires or the team should move on from him they need to find a new qb and they need to look at someone other than rudolph duck and dobbs
our defense had its issues but theyre all compounded by the fact that the offense consistently is off the field in three plays defense is on the field so much and its a big part of the reason why guys on that unit are dropping like flies to injuries

its been clear for a month that defenses know whats coming and no adjustments have been made our playbook has somehow slimmed as the season has progressed zero plays that play off of our tendencies which would be so easy to implement given how predictable weve been theres no effort in keeping defenses honest were completely one dimensional on offense
the offence is scaring me and our defence is getting depleted a one and done playoff run seems likely to me
i feel bad for the defense going on two years of playing their asses off with minimal support on offense exhaustion and injuries continue to pile up and whats even more sad is that next year dupree hilton sutton are all possibly gone feels like this elite defense has gone to waste
death and silly steelers coaching decisions we had 7 in the box for the second bills td and it was 3rd down in steelers territory absolutely why
oh we just need juju to stop dancing to start winning again incredible deep analysis guys honestly injuries odd scheduling and inconsistent offensive play has caught up to us hard hopefully with an extra day of rest we can recharge a bit and get a good win going into the final two games of the season where we will either build a little momentum or not
steelers could really use a ravens win tonight so they can afford to sit ben for a week or two to let his knee heal
the people who have been insisting all year that the offense will turn things around need to realize that the offense cannot and will not turn it around and the only hope of this team doing anything in the playoffs relies solely on the defense saving their asses as they have been in the majority of games this year

munchak leaving was a much bigger issue than any of us could have imagined people knew it would be a big loss but it is unbelievable how big it truly was the oline is a mess with or without injuries

fichtner is one of if not the worst ocs in the nfl we would be blessed to have todd haley and frankly i would be thrilled if the steelers broke protocol and fired fichtner today the fichtner defenders are wrong there are mountains of evidence of that and it isnt even worth arguing about

people crying about butler for not having a defense capable of playing 75 drives at 100 effectiveness each week even with all these injuries need to chill and realize that every problem this team has comes down to the offense being bottom 5 in the nfl and bottom 5 is generous
i think you can attribute the poor defense to the injuries we didnt have haden and our ilb depth was very thin with spillane and vince out the pass rush misses bud a lot but still there were too many miss tackles and that just cant happen at this level i cant even remember the amount of times a 23 yard gain turned into a 5 yard gain because we cant tackle

this offense is atrocious butterfingers cant block cant run predicable play calling you name it

this team has played like crap 3 weeks in a row time is running out to clean it up

were not super bowl contenders at the moment
what happened to all the backfield motion runs really havent seen as much when they were so effective earlier in the season
lets be honest the offense have benefited from a good defense all season long now that the injuries are stacking up that cover is no longer there the defense is still giving great effort despite the injuries and constantly being on the field offense is our achilles heel its weird to say even with so many playmakers we play to win not to be proud for playoff participation this team can still do good things only if the offense wakes up if this is who they are then well were going to get bounced lets stop sugar coating it
i really didnt think we played that poorly considering who is playing at lb and our offensive line getting all jacked up i think we are starting to see how much that bye is screwing us over especially playing 3 games so quickly offensively i know people are outraged at how poor it has been but i really do think the offensive gameplan is simply dont let ben get hurt right now if he goes down making the playoffs is pointless and we already have locked a playoff spot i know people are saying theyve been figured out but there is just 0 urgency to try anything right now and our guys really dont seem to have a tone of motivation i expect to see us slowly begin playing better moving into the end of the season hoping the browns game is a mini bye week for us but at this rate probably will be for the division
what was the point of signing derek previous 2 games he was wide open in the end zone and didnt even get a look i havent seen him with significant amount snaps im confused on why
if youre gonna save the season it begins with randy fitchners access pass not working today
i think the biggest question in my mind is can the issues with ben be corrected my concern is they are not and ben doesnt have much left
hello darkness my old friend

this winning streak corrupted me and had me in an uncomfortable territory that everything was awesome while our team noticeably began falling apart i have faith in tomlin and others to right the ship we are not going to fire the oc or do anything drastic looking forward to some improvements next week we are in the playoffs with a great but much maligned def
i think we should all start expecting ben to sit out next week vs the bengals regardless of who tf said it i do think bens knee is not good because he barely moved last night that sack he took he actually just took that is not ben roethlisberger to take a sack like that

i stopped paying attention but did he even take a single snap from under center i think the whole 22 seconds thing is more a product of a dismal ol since munchak left and ben not being able to get mobile at all his bomb passes were always when hed bail from the pocket and make space but there has been zero of that since he knocked his knee in the jags game

i dont care about the record or the seed i just care to have the most healthy squad on whatever field come the playoffs so if we have to bench them all for rest take every remaining loss and go in as the 57 seed i honestly wont mind that as much as continuing to put an ailing bunch of soreass tired men struggle for what would inevitably amount to nothing anyway homefield doesnt even matter nearly as much this year and every team will be fighting regardless of their seed so there is no easy way to get there

however i do know that our pittsburgh steelers of the 2020 season can be gritty af and pull out wins they wouldnt have in seasonspast therefore i reserve hope based on love for this team and if such a move is made as to sit ben next week i ask that we appreciate the football reason and not care as much about the hot takes and media reasons

ok ive said my peace sorry and thank you

go stillers
if you count the legal points we won easily
the play calling is so goddamn predictable im not sure what happened to our jetsweeps but i feel like the same variation of 6 plays get called every time that tight end screen to vance was an abomination the amount of people we were missing on defense is just staggering and my god did it show i thought highsmith played well but we were just not getting outside pressure on allen unless it came from one of our cornerbacks maybe the acl injury allows us to retain bud for a cheaper price but well see secondary played very well until they didnt steven nelson played pretty well but eventually running press man against diggs just ate us up i cant help but feel if we had haden things are different this game minkah had his worst game in a while and just wasnt making plays that missed tackle and deep 3rd touchdown were momentum killers hilton played very well but that 3rd down pi buried us

our receiving corp has to be the most talented inconsistent group of talent in the league diontae has a chance to be a top 10 receiver and when he gets the ball hes electric but my god man you gotta catch the ball its gotta just bein his head at this point claypool isnt making those big plays he was earlier in the year he dropped a huge one yesterday it was a tough catch but still needed it ebron was ebron james washington is our most sure handed wr but he lacks the athleticism that the others do at this point jujus our best wideout and we need to take more shots with him downfield but with fucking randy bobandy calling the shots i doubt itll happen

the good things is were in the playoffs and were still in the drivers seat i cant believe im saying this but we need the ravens to win tonight because i do not want to play the browns for the division title were 11 and 2 and we need a big game against the bungles to build on hopefully we get spillane chuks dotson and haden back

here we go
ben disappointed me i thought after being robbed of a game winning drive last week we would see a fire but he needs to take 80 of the blame for that loss dude chucked the worse interception ive ever seen going into halftime the 2 most important parts of a football game are the 2 min going into halftime and the 2 min coming out ben deflated our entire team with a single throw i think next season we really need to cut bait we can keep juju bud and hilton by getting rid of ben cant let this defense go without a ring ben is not the guy to take us to 7 love all hes done for us but his arm may be the reason play calling is so limited
i was optimistic going into this week even with the previous two weeks but ive officially swung the other way

the oline is the problem right now and its not exactly something that can be fixed at the end of the season they cant run block seemingly cant pass block the very few times ben doesnt get rid of the ball in 22 seconds he has dudes right in his face and its all compounded by the fact that ben cant move at all maybe maybe if we had a mobile qb they could fix some of these issues with bootlegs and moving around in the pocket but that simply isnt an option the play calling is so predictable the d is literally just sitting there to blow up plays before they develop relying on the receivers to break 3 tackles to gain 8 yards is not sustainable

maybe if the defense was completely healthy you could get away with it by getting great field position but i just dont see how this team can win anything in the playoffs i guess itll make the games less frustrating when i have low expectations
i can understand being bad but what makes me furious is being stupid and thats what we are on offense right now

i dont think analytics are the beall and endall but they do show very convincingly that certain things like sneaking in 3rd4thand1 situations and using playaction often simply make your offense better the way we choose to play is the antithesis of what analytics recommend which wouldnt worry me if our offense is good but its not when pff say that they consult for 3132 teams i get this awful feeling about who that outlier is

steelers arent even best team in the afc anymore
juju dancing on the bills logo was the early sign we were gonna blow dude needs to stop with that shit love the guy but damn
rough game mostly played like shit by a team on fumes and riddled with injuries hoped for a win but not surprised by a loss i think they can pull it together with conner and pouncey back ill get nervous if things dont change against the bungals
no run game no explosive offensive plays ol is trash

the defense is good theyre still playing well but theyre getting gassed by the 3rd q because a the offensive doesnt help them and b we have no depth because everyones injured

i really think fichtner needs to go i dont feel like were that far away from competing even post ben we need a competent qb and to throw everything we have in the bank at munchak in hopes he comes back

this was our year we had the top defense an offensive loaded with cheap young talent an aboveaverage ol a decent rb and a hof qb

if we dont get it done this year we lose conner villy feiler juju bud sutton hilton and im sure a few more that is 722 starters not including other moves we make too
in the last 3 games the offense has score 15 17 and 12 points def scored in ravens game i didnt even go look at times when the defense set up the offense with phenomenal field position like last night to get the 1st score that in and of itself is a problem

last night the offense had 13 drives of those 13 drives 9 were 4 or less plays another 1 ended the 1st half there were 5 three and outs

last week there were 14 offensive drives 9 drives were 5 plays or less

week before against ravens 10 offensive drive 4 drives of 5 plays or less

that is the problem right there
injuries were brutal drops were still a major issue but this offense is inherently flawed and i dont think its going to improve im trying not to chicken little when were sitting at 112 but i cant imagine this team doing anything in the playoffs

the run game looked fifty times better than it has the past couple weeks and yet was still basically nonexistent the run blocking is a problem especially when youre down to your final five healthy olinemen but our group of rbs are not good conner is not a feature back and im losing any hope i had that snell or samuels will even be in the league in a couple years i would love to see more from mcfarland but he hasnt exactly looked promising either

the drops are just inexcusable dj got into a bit of a groove in the second half but multiple drives were killed because he couldnt catch the ball ebron is even worse because hes barely running his routes at this point if i had a little more confidence in the rest of the offense i would be happy to see them both scratched against the bengals

but honestly ben andor randy are the root of our offensive woes i have never seen a less creative or effective offense than what weve got over the past fourish weeks we are utterly abandoning the run in favour of a spread passing attack that rarely throws deeper than five yards ben has no deep throw capability at all and the medium ranges have been completely abandoned were barely playing from under center we have virtually no play action we arent even doing any of the creative sweeps or presnap motions that were working well in the first half of the season it is an absolute chore to watch this offense and its depressing to watch them repeatedly put our defense behind the eightball

ben is done we are running a gameplan thats even more limited than what we did last year with mason and duck if thats all hes capable of then why are we keeping him around especially when it will likely cost us quality starters like bud and juju and hilton he needs to hang it up and we need to focus on the future i just feel so disillusioned about what that future will look like
i cant say im optimistic about the rest of the season at this point our defense is playing admirably despite being decimated but our offense is so one dimensional it has become easy to defend

from what i can see our offensive woes are a 3 issue problem ben randy and the oline ben is our best qb by a mile but he doesnt appear to have the desire to throw the intermediate nor deep throws anymore that offense last night gave me december 2019 flashbacks completely ineffective in all aspects and playing scared that wasnt supposed to happen with ben back you could have thrown mason or duck in and it wouldnt have been much different

sadly my optimism for the playoffs is waning i just dont see the oline magically playing better considering the injuries and i definitely dont see ben and randy changing the offensive scheme ben wants to distribute quickly and that is what we are going to do i hope they surprise me
juju dancing is giving the other teams more motivation shit needs to stop now we are getting clowned on

havent been able to run the ball in weeks has finally caught up with us

offensive line has played decently but need obvious adjustments in the run game

ebron needs to be demoted to number 2 or used just in the redzone

all wideouts need to spend all week on the jugs machine

defensively just need to get healthy

its now bengals week lets focus on that and getting back to steeler football
i just want to say how dirty i feel todaydiggs is on my fantasy team
that sucked offense was just bad even ben looked shaky at times the play calling was bad the run game is dead seemingly little adjustment at half i wish i know how to fix this team
there is no deep threat because we need to get rid of the ball so fast no run no play action fake short passes are all that we have and our competitors know it defence is not getting any support
the fact we didnt try to score before the half shows how little confidence the offense has in its self if thats the case then some fucking changes need to happen immediately
short and sweet aside from our defense we really suck right now

offensive line is the most offensive thing about our offense ben cant throw deep our run game is an embarrassment and our oline sucks translation well throw middling every time special teams isnt exactly a bright spot but its not the shitshow that our offense is the only thing our wrstes can reliably catch is probably covid

god bless whats left of our crippled defense at this point because theyre holding our team together like fucking flex tape right now

i wonder if tj watt can play te probably has better hands than ebron
someone need to tell juju to stop fucking dancing for tiktok on the opposing teams midfield logo

what in the holy mother of fuck happened to the offense what can be done right now to help the o and particularly the line they cant run block worth a shit and everyone is talking about how much faster bens release is but its because the line cant pass block for more than two seconds

i think its becoming more clear that conner isnt the guy for the future i dont think snell or samuels is either

why does everything have to be out of the damn shotgun i can sit on my couch half drunk and know what the offense is doing id have to believe opposing teams can do it too then

why sign d watt as a fullback if youre not going to use him there is zero reason why this offense should have to go five wide inside the four yard line to try and score

the d is still playing at a super high level causing turnovers early and stopping teams from doing much of anything since the offense is showing incapable of capitalizing on those turnovers the d isnt getting adequate rest time which is resulting in injuries and then getting beat in the second half

as a fan with football knowledge having played the game most of my life on both sides of the ball these issues are glaring even to the most football illiterate it bothers me that the front office is having such a hands off approach to all of this

something has to be done and soon to right the ship these are not the kinds of games and looses you want leading into the playoffs theyre demoralizing
as a former patriots fan i can tell you that good oline play is essential if you wanna make any kind of noise in the playoffs brady routinely had tons of time to sit back and scan the field and it made a huge difference if tomlin cant figure something out by january then were royally fucked
we are screwed with no lube and not enjoying
it this time
i didnt wanna say anything out loud cuz of superstitions and shitbut i saw this coming the second our bye week got shafted by the titans its impossible to play 13 straight weeks of football and come out unscathed and the whole ravens situation was the nail in the coffin making us play 3 games in 12 days we can fix the drops we can fix the offensive line we can fix the offensive playcalling we can fix a whole lotta things but you just cant fix injuries were hurting right now and now that our chances of a 1st round bye are all but gone its gonna be a brutal second half of december and january for us

x200b

the only positive is that we have clinched the playoff berth and since winning out doesnt even give us a great chance at a bye maybe we can use these final 3 weeks to figure out some new strategies for this offense its painfully obvious that defenses have figured out what we wanna do on offense with all the short throws so its time to make adjustments this defense is playing ridiculously well and if we can just get that same level of production from the offense that we were getting at the beginning of the season we can do more than just pose a threat to kc
ol dl rb qb are major needs for this team heres hoping that some of the free agent decisions get made for them

feiler villanueva and conner are guaranteed goners williamson hasnt impressed he can go wormley the same vance and davis can go rayray unfortunately

at this point you have to pay juju as he is the most consistent player on this offense considering how little highsmith is doing you almost have to sign bud too because its clear that last year wasnt a fluke and the penny really did drop let 56 rotate both sides i dont really see the point in resigning banner as hes never been a starting caliber tackle and for people to moot him as next years left tackle blows my mind

dbs are tricky because hilton and sutton are a lot of good but a lot of bad idk who you keep here but in his limited action this year layne hasnt looked up to it which wouldve made the decision to keep mike and let cam walk a simple one would like to keep alualu as hes very solid but that depends on his price i liked what i saw out of buggs this year and i like mondeauxs motor even if he is a bit raw

the biggest issue is still probably quarterback if ben could consistently throw the ball downfield theres no doubt he would be he wanted a big fast guy to chuck the ball up to for years and now he finally has one in claypool and he cant even remotely make those throws anymore we can blame randy and he certainly is to blame for some of the lack of creativity but its ben you can only be so creative within that 10 yard window hes hamstringing this offense because he cant hit deep shots to worry a defense they literally have nothing to fear so long as they tackle on the catch

earlier this year he was kinda hitting those deep shots but the threat overall was there because they would occasionally hit its gotta be arm fatigue but that doesnt excuse the fact that his deep shots are now complete wobblers that are well under thrown hes hoping his receivers bail him out or that the refs do but the throws arent anywhere close to giving the receivers a chance

its a vicious cycle because if they could run itd take the pressure off of him but now with the way the offense is constructed youre always going to be running against 8 man boxes cause everything is so congested unless they start going downfield and hitting some long throws this offense is gonna be stuck in 1st2nd gear i dont care how good your offensive line is 5 can seldom block 7 6 can seldom block 8
bills players said juju childish pregame tik tok on the bills logo fired them up to win lol juju lovers please defend this is he just having fun give me a fucking break i want guys who are focused on one thing during the season winning juju isnt a winner hes a crowd pleaser

other teams not just divisional have disgraced the towel in other words franchises di this to other franchises in many instances across the season its all fun and games and adds to the experience
yawn if they lost he wouldnt have said shit
dont we always dance on teams logo ik he does it on ours a lot idk about other teams
punting 9x and 2 ints stressing the defense until was gassed af probably has way more to do with the loss than juju dancing
love juju but just stop the fucking dancing dude dallas and buffalo now looks like a jackass when this comes out
no one has a problem with it until we lose find something else to cry about because this is not an issue
hes probably doing it for a yt compilation or some shit who gives a fuck about people fragile enough to be upset by it that goes for the towel defenders too
im glad im not the only one that thinks this is stupid as fuck i said so during the dallas game and was downvoted into oblivion

its not even a tik tok thing just dont give the other team ammunition for more motovation its so fucking dumb what kind of mentality must someone have to think oh im gonna go dance on their logo this will piss them off its so fucking lame
thats right its all jujus fault the steelers lost
i dont think that logodancing or towelstomping for that matter makes one iota of difference in terms of motivation or energy level or anything else on game day these are professional athletes playing a violent game for millions of dollars in front of millions of people they are as geeked as they are going to be

i also dont believe that juju has his head in the wrong place or that he isnt focused because he does these things it takes about 30 seconds to plan and execute this stuff and if it keeps them loose thats just fine

it does however make you look like a complete fucking idiot when you do a tiktok dance on the logo at the middle of the field and your team lays a damn egg
juju is an attention whore even when he does something good for the community theres always conveniently someone recording it on their phone

i honestly dont know how tomlin allows cellphones in the locker room after the antonio brown playoff incident
not to sound like a boomer or mark madden but the pregame dancing on the teams logo has got to go
less dancing less tik tok more running the ball and catching passes blue fucking collar football
im ready for the steelers to move on from juju watch his videos with his buddy danny duncan and hes just an immature kid pair it up with stuff like dancing on opposing teams logos and the non stop social media just go juju we dont win super bowls with clowns like this
humiliating
fuck josh allen
really josh shut the fuck up and win a playoff game oh wait buffalo hasnt in nearly 30 years we will see these arrogant fucks again
fuck the bills and josh allen

as someone who lives in ohio i cannot possibly stand the idea of cle having a chance to win the division i will have to quarantine until next season to avoid browns fans obnoxiousness
after seeing all the ravens fans shit on us on twitter i hope the browns beat them back to baltimore
im torn a ravens win means theres a good chance that they become the 6 seed and i do not want the steelers to face the ravens in the playoffs a browns win means theyre only 15 games back of the division
tie i dont want either of them to win
can we change this to who do you want to lose because i want the browns to lose but i could never say i want the ravens to win
i voted for the browns
with all the shit talking the browns did after our loss to washington i hope baltimore beats their ass

my optimism was here this morning get a few guys back on d and the oline whup the bungles to remember what winning feels like go forward we have a lot of work to do for an 112 team but i trust in our guys to do it go steelers
i dont think optimism can rise for me unless we trade for the entire chiefs offense old ben and oline arent getting the job done its depressing
hopefully a division rival losing tonight will make you and me both feel better

he aint watching claypool because claypool doesnt get reps for some reason
chase was nonexistent yesterday
usavevideo
oc just needs to be fired end of story
ok so hear me out last year the ravens and lamar jackson where almost undefeated because no one could figure them out this year we did figure them out and look at them now this year on the other hand no one could figure us out until the washington game and know where getting be by worse teams dont blame the players there playing well mostly blame the coaching

tldr where getting predictable
i am concerned if you think were is where
the 2019 ravens were by every objective measure a great team they just got upset by a red hot team in a game where they were favored by 9


the 2020 steelers are a very limited team that wins by defense or not at all i cant imagine theyd be favorites against any afc playoff team right now by more than a field goal and theyd be underdogs against all the rest
2019 patriots is a better comparison
were predictable because the only thing we can do is short passes our offensive line cant run block so we have no running game ben is getting rid of the ball within 25 secs so our only passes are ones where the routes are that quick

our defense is out there most of the game so they get tired and our pass rush is less effective when the defense is gassed
the running game falling apart is the biggest issue if teams had to stay honest on defense to defend against the run the quick passing game would open up again but the steelers ran into two teams that planned for it well washington got their hands in passing lanes and the bills secondary played their coverage well and jumped routes is what it is cant win them all

i am concerned though about playoff football and not being able to run for even 50 yards combined in a game conner is still averaging 43 yardscarry on the season but it was 18 yardscarry last night not good and frankly the 43 stat is ballooned up because of the game he had in jacksonville as much as i like the guy steelers need to find a true bellcow running back instead of the committee they have now


might as well add teams that can run the ball too
teams whos 3rd and 1 play isnt firing a pass to the moon and praying it lands within 10 yards of a receiver
honestly other than a few drops super early first drive i though they did a pretty good job holding on that game now we know fichtner is the problem
this teams offense looks like the patriots offense in the worst way possible
teams that dont waste the talent of 3 phenomenal receivers by only running screen passes and making the shittiest play calls

or how about teams with an offensive coordinator that isnt so fucking retarded it makes their fans want to hang themselves

or how about teams that dont rely so heavily on their defense that it injures half the fucking starters
this wasnt even our problem last night we just couldnt move down the field because all of our passes were 3 yards long
it didnt feel like the drops were the reason they lost to the bills though they just cant move the ball at all
at this point i wish we could just hand the ball off we literally just have an offense that stands out there
this team feels like the bears with a little more talent defence is amazing but the offence makes that irrelevant
catch the ball run the ball throw the ball long any goes
god bless
defense wins championships when they can actually catch a pass or run the ball
lmao
pain
i hate that i identify
thanks for the awards just wanted to show my friend how it felt watching other teams make catches cheers everyone
drops werent even why we lost last night tbh every rushing attempt we had resulted in our backs running into a brick wall i dont know who our ol coach is right now or if we even have one and it seems like randy is underqualified as an oc because he came from being a qb coach and has zero experience with managing running backs i guess sometimes it pans out but you cant always plugandplay position coaches into broader roles that they have no background in
yesthe team is in a tad offensive rut 3 weeks to right the ship though stay positivewe are still 112 not 67 trying to claw in the playoffs

the worst part of this meme is spongebob and patrick arent even receivers theyre defensive backs
teams with competent ocs
its the ol
we couldnt run a 05k
thats how i felt tonight watching the browns and ravens offenses score at will

this is so fuckedbut so hilarious
sorry if this has already been posted today but messing around with the playoff machine on espn after yesterdays results it looks like both the division and balts playoff chances come down to tonights clebalt game

scenario 1

balt beats cle pit can then beat cincy and lose to both indy and cle finish 124 win the division and be the 23 seed over indytenn with a win tonight balt is likely in regardless of what mia does assuming they win all 3 vs jax nyg and cincy which seems probable

2

cle beats balt pit then needs to beat cincy and either indy or cle to win the division and still be the 23 seed 2 losses would put pit in the 56 spot if balt loses tonight they need to win out have mia lose 23 vs ne lvr and buff certainly possible given their current injury situation

soooo given all this it looks like our most likely finish is the 23 seed this is all assuming pit beats cincy next monday if i messed anything up let me know but it looks like a balt win tonight would seal the division and the 23 seed for us
so we gaurentee win the tie breaker with the browns if they lose tonight
at this point we have anywhere from the 2 to 5 seed i really think we should rest all of our starters the rest of the way

why

because only 1 gets a bye and we have little chance of that now

home field means nothing when there are no fans

we have so many people hurt and no depth left last night we were down to 0 reserve lineman at the end if anybody got hurt we have like 0 linebackers ben has got to have some injury problems

in other words we gain almost nothing buy winning regular season games but every injury makes the playoffs harder
i am not rooting for the ratbirds per se but id rather they win than lose
i think if cleveland wins tonight we can lose to both cin and ind as long as we beat cleveland week 17 and wed still win the division both teams would be 124 but wed have head to head tiebreakers over cle
dang dude guess im rooting for the ravens tonight this feels weird im gonna need a couple showers i think
i really thing the most likely scenario is we finish 133 with a loss to the browns and end up with the 3 seed i dont think buffalo is losing again but they play miami twice in the next few weeks

playing around on the playoff machine i dont think the browns lose again either i think we both end up 133 but we have a tie breaker ravens dont make it in my scenario and the browns end up 5 at 133
removed

special teams has been ass as well we saw exact why ray ray was let go from buffalo boswell for whatever reason cant just send kickoffs out of the endzone we consistently let teams start at the 3035 yd line its so bad also hard to put all the blame in fichtner when half the playbook is limited due to personnel old ben cant chuck it like he used to and ol is just pathetic
i feel like ben doesnt feel comfortable throwing the ball like how he used to when have you ever seen an offense with ben run plays like this
i mean dont get me wrong fichtners play calling has been sketchy at best over the last couple of weeks however he is not the sole problem here

when your offensive line cant block well enough for your running back to pick up one yard at a time that stagnates your offense

when your running backs cant find the hole or pick up 34 yards consistently that stagnates your offense

when your receivers act like they are playing a game of hot potato and no one wants to catch the ball that stagnates your offense

when your quarterback is making poor reads throwing soft lob passes and crucial interceptions that stagnates your offense

regardless of who is calling plays if our offense doesnt start performing at an nfl level they arent winning games
danny smith is horrible too butler is carried by elite talent like our ocs used to be
the offense would probably cost us a game to the jets
no the entire coaching staff sucks its sort of a mike tomlin tradition to annually have awful coordinators how the fuck danny smith still has a job falls totally on tomlin anytime an opposing kick returner makes it past the 30 yard line that is a failure on the special teams unfortunately it happens way too often against danny smith

jordan berry sucks totally on tomlin and smith for bringing back that joke but then again i have no doubt that the punt coverage is just as bad as the kick return coverage so at least when berry shanks a 35 yard punt there isnt going to be a return

keith butler sucks too but he gets bailed out by talent look no further than butlers refusal to double team diggs

mike tomlin has become complacent rooneys arent going to fire him and the media keeps sucking his dick so he wont make any changes to the coaching staff

considering hes the only receiver that can do absolutely anything he can dance on his damn head for all i care
i think maybe having an 110 record put a big target on our backs not dancing everyone is gunning for us period
i dont always enjoy his antics but hes a good natured person off the field and a tough sonuvabitch on the field its all part of the game i dont know if one thing or another can rile up an opponent to the point where they can overcome a lack of talent

the bottom line is the steelers arent playing well and the injuries are beginning to take their toll its the steelers one of if not the most popular franchises in the country of any sport i feel like we always have a target on our back they hate us cuz they aint us

hopefully the coaching staff is able to put together a game plan for the healthy guys and the injured get their rest for the playoffs ahead we have a ticket to the tournament which is more than what can be said for the past couple seasons

here we go
is he disgracing the logo or doing the naruto run either way who cares about target on the teams backs im sure you see teams of all flavors that would do what juju does he isnt hurting anyone
i am fine with it
no because the offense cant do nothing but throw short its the easiest offense to defend id be surprised if the bills defense even broke a sweat last night

the most unimportant irrelevant things get magnified in a loss they got bigger things to worry about than juju dancing on a logo though

side note him and washington are the only consistent players on offense

edit fans really need to stop looking at nfl meme pages shit is only gonna rile you up and concern yourself with things that dont mean anything that 11 point loss is misleading offensively as good as the bills is they were only able to put up 19 points against a defense missing 5 starters and a bills defense that literally only has to defend one thing
people need to care less about this
i wonder if other teams will dance on the logo when playing the steelers now
imagine a player coming into heinz field and purposefully dancing on the steelers logo pregame i am sure it wouldnt be a big deal at all on here
he backs it up on the field and hes a great teammate nothing else matters
thanks boomer
he needs to stop this
yeah this is exactly why we lost the game

he probably stayed up too late the night before playing fortnite too right

removed
fuck off dude
how hasnt this dude been banned post history is just spamming subs for clicks

he was the only bright spot on our offense last night so he seems like we should keep him but ok
jesus a lot of you guys are insufferable today
this stupid shit right here god damn this sub is insufferable some times
thank god the bandwagon fans are leaving thats the best part of losing tbh we see who the real fans are
lmao
id only let him walk if he asks for too much money if he expects to be paid like deandre hopkins or tyreek hill money hes lost is his mind
this is pantsonhead stupid
intensely stupid post
juju is the only shining spot on offense lmfao line is trash ben has been trash diontae and ebron have been trash run game has been trash but if theres anyone who is a priority to keep this offseason its juju

the logo dancing is enough for me ya i get it hes just having fun it gets old though

you must be awful at parties
if diontae wasnt dropping everything or if ebron was tearing it up sure i could entertain this idea but ultimately juju looks like the best receiver on the team claypool has the most talent just isnt being used and i guarantee you if he was let go hell tear it up for some team next year and everyone will question why the steelers let him go this offense will function best moving forward with an elite deep threat claypool and a great hands guy who gets tough yardage juju you can build around them just need to have some semblance of a run game so the play action will be a threat
so since we are good at drafting wr we keep them for the first 4 years and then we let them go does it sound reasonable absolutely not the drop passes problem is bc of our wrs are young and they lack of experience in the clutch moments the only one with a little bit of experience he even improved from his mistakes ex the fumble against the ravens is juju and you can tell he improved so much in tough catches we need to resign him
you guys do know im mostly just trolling right
resign hilton as the nickel corner resign sutton and play him on the outside release haden and save 13 million dollars have an elite secondary for the next half decade

juju is not a priority

receivers really are a dime a dozen i cant emphasize enough how tough it is for the steelers to draft really good cornerbacks they just arent very good at it and they finally have two young cornerbacks and people want to get rid of them for a tik toker
juju this year has shown three real steeler wr qualities but compared to all steeler wrs idk he has been a team player been the guy on 3rd down and ive seen him dive on fumbles more then once this year he is playing with his head first not talent

he is essentially a 2020 hines ward one of my favorite receivers but compared to like santonio mike wallace and ab hes not special even compared to claypool and dj jw if dj was actually catching the rock i think hes long term more talented as you can see we always get boys in the wr department remember bryant lol wow

juju is a great player and though i would say all the players i brought up are more explosive at the end of the day juju is still someone you want to have on the team much like ward history is positioned to remember someone who acts like a steelers first than one who plays well in the colors

tldr juju is the wr we want but no one should be surprised to see him go because he could and we would be fine
u guys dumb ash if u dont think anyone other than juju is producing week after week only one that looks like we can count on every week and it isnt his fault the offense makes the dumbest decisions on the pick if ben waited a little longer he wouldve been open for a first or even a better throw he was the only receiver to do anything really in the 2nd half they need to do more with him in the passing game send him deep a lot more

hey i was just wondering why juju spends so much time dancing before and during games seems like a dumb thing to do in my opinion does he want to be a tiktok star or something

thanks
i honestly see juju retiring early and devoting his time to streaming and social media


bell didnt really have a horrible personality he wanted paid and didnt like what the steelers were offering thats how it goes with any employment opportunity correct if you dont like what company a is offering then you go somewhere else cant fault him for that
im so sick of bell being lumped in with mbc its a business there doesnt have to be a good guy and a bad guy in every situation
i hope we take a rb in the first or second round whether we decide to sign conner or not

we need an every down back just like leveon bell and conner with either goal line carries or to sub in

i cant stand the conner snell samuels mcfarland committee

we need a big agile and quick dude like bell who can line up at receiver if needed
bell was in all his rights to do what he did was he dumb not to take the steelers offer at first yes now not so much however brown wasnt in the right brown is an asshole and i wish nothing but the worst
i would not put leveon bell in the same category of antonio brown
bell was solid but ab is all time talented like all time all time talented
how would that help ben cant throw downfield and defenses stack the line against our terrible o line connor was great during his rookie year and we have a really talented receiving core
correct me if im wrong but bell took less money to go to a worse team for years granted he failed upward to the chiefs but still
ive been a pittsburgh steelers fan since i was a little kid actually bens rookie season was when i started watching them pittsburgh could go 016 and ill proudly wear my steelers merch with a smile on my face with the two losses everyone is like oh no this awful its ok so what we could lose out and ill still be happy with the season weve had
super bowl or bust
i wear my steelers gear with pride regardless the record 112 right now looks better than last years 88 but i do think we need to start playing with some grit not making plays and not winning games makes the 112 look meaningless
look i bleed black and gold but theres some serious issues that were masked by ugly wins
ill support this team til the day i die but ill still get frustrated every year they dont play up to their potential this team has a roster capable of a super bowl run yet were starting the same end of season slump we did in 2018
easy to get frustrated now but if we were told 3 months ago that this team would be 112 at this point wed all be elated
pretty sure most on here will support the steelers no matter what the complaining is built up frustration when we have talented teams and of late we either dont make the playoffs go one and done or lose to an inferior opponent


the steelers could and should be better yes they are 112 but have not been trending in the right direction for weeks this isnt just a we only lost two games so far lets all be chipper the future looks bleak


imo this is the window we dont do anything this year it could be years because we are going to be losing a good amount of players due to fa and ben could be should be gone next year or will be another year older and step slower
for many teams that is an acceptable outcome those of us from pittsburgh and throughoutanything less than a lombardi trophy is a failure the culture of winning all the championships in the past dictates that
everybody chill lol did anyone think we were gonna be 112 at this point anyway
sometimes fans seem to forget the most important part of sports entertainment now granted the offense has been everything but entertaining lately yet people lose sight of that one win and the sky is falling trailing and the sky is falling bubble screen and the sky is falling enjoy it for godsake especially enjoy a franchise qb they dont grow in trees and due to the steelers always being competitive i doubt they get another one any time soon without a lot of luck going their way
the day after losses stink with that said i try to get over them asap because ive grown to realize that theres always next week to get it right and when the season is over win or lose there will always be next season

even when one of our current favorite player on the roster is no longer a member of the steelers we find a new guy to root for and support i agree with you and i am optimistic that this team is far from done and has a lot of football left at minimum 4 more games
hell yeah
if someone told you in september that we would be 112 would you be upset no not sure why people are losing their shit now
i agree but it hurts when you had an 110 start just to lose two games in a row because the nfl decided to screw us by basically taking away our bye week

lol what joe haden has been perfect for us how about restructuring bens contract significantly if he doesnt retire
i hope im wrong but father time will start catching up with haden soon so releasing him might not be a bad idea i think they can resign juju hilton and sutton while letting dupree go good for bud to break the bank and i noticed yesterday that pff has highsmith rated as the 8th best edge defender in the league
haden is a legit 1 corner the other guys are not now if your argument is you would rather have three 2 corners instead of one 1 and one 2 then thats a rational take but if you are trying to say that there isnt much of a drop off between haden and the other guys you are sorely mistaken
i think id probably wait for a time other than right after the two losses where our defense was torched by opposing wrs and haden was out due to injury

seems like theres some correlation there that might disprove your claim that haden isnt worth what were paying him
hilton is 26 sutton is 25 they still are pretty young and they can easily become elite hilton is already showing it the past few games i agree they would free up 15 mil and haden is already 31 release haden for fucks sake dont give decastro 50000000 no wonder we always have cap issues jesus ik decastro is good but im definitely not giving his ass 50 mil who the hell is giving ben 68000000 for two years lol sorry i just ranted the steelers need to solve the cap like immediately
were definitely going to have to shed some money and it just has to be haden the more i watch hilton the more indispensable he seems and sutton seems to be on the rise hate to say it but joe and not resigning juju are probably whats best also pairing bud and tj would be a dream not sure if we can financially make that happen
theres a lotta money tied up into ben next season lots
ignoring the fact that haden has been incredible for us releasing haden only saves 7m in cap space we are not resigning both hilton and sutton with that
id love to see hilton stay the guy is a legitimate playmaker and can do a lot of things i dare say hes the best tackler on the team
that is definitely not a great way of entering the playoffs hopefully we can right the ship
at this point im more concerned with whos on the injury report after week 17 and less about our record were not getting the 1 seed so were playing in the first round of the playoffs no matter how the next 3 go hopefully haden spillane dotson feiler and williams are all available by then and no one else goes down before then the record is what it is depressing as it may be id rather sit some guys take an l or 2 and have a chance at playoff wins then try to win the next 3 straight
that sucks



not playing derek watt is clearly just a long con fitchner is setting him up for a goahead td reception in the final moments of the superbowl
randy is a dumbass but derek watt is not going to solve the problems of the run game
i really had hopes that matt canada coming in would have resulted in james conner being used correctly and theyd run the ball more and have more creative play calling but sadly i was wrong
why give him that contract if you arent going to play him he is the second highest paid fb in the league avg per year
i suggest using cam heyward in the back field for short yardage and goal line either to clear the hole or run the ball
i cannot wait to fire this man when ben retires im wondering if mason is really as bad as we think or fichtner has an adam gase effect literally the least innovative oc out there
hot take swap canada and fichtners roles
3rd and long hb draw
big ben is pigheaded too doesnt like to call run plays or do play action we have a two headed monster in ben and randy
might as well put derick watt at ilb
what i want to know is how does a guy who looks like he lives in a truck stop bathroom make it to offensive coordinator in the nfl there is no way he has even an ounce of athleticism in his body
unnecessary bomb important distinction
i only remember watt being used on that one goal line play against wft and thats it for the whole season
put him on the bench and put in the back up play caller better yet just let ben call the plays on field
wouldnt feel right to win without bud steelers are just really considerate team mates
do not play claypool
i think one thing people neglect to take into account is ben doesnt really play under center much because in shotgun he can get the passes off quicker and doesnt have to take hits at this stage of his career if were going to win a sb last year proved we need ben healthy thus shotgun all day the sacrifice though is that running the ball effectively out of shotgun over the course of a full season is practically impossible so do we want healthy ben or 100 yard rushing games for conner cant really have both
im surprised theres anything on that sheet at all sometimes i think hes looking at a kids pop up picture book when calling plays to the field
its hilarious to me with all of the talent we have on offense that people really want a fullback in there more often
you guys always hate the coaching but only from the coordinators
removed
honestly we have nearly no chance of getting a 1st round bye now so i wouldnt hate letting ben and some other guys rest up and get healthy before the playoffs if we clinch the division
playoffs start in january
removed
i mean it just makes us look bad cause we are playing ass right now but juju is the only player on the offense that i feel wants to win the dances are just his personality hes just a happy guy but i mean 6 catches on 7 targets for 55 yards and a td is his role hes meant to get the nasty yards over the middle and hes doing it the best he can hes performing so i really could care less if he goes around dancing
the whole point of playing the game is to have fun he just wants to have fun and its not his fault the offensive coordinator sucks balls he catches the ball when its thrown to him so he has all rights to dance when he scores or before games
i dont understand people getting upset over things like this or ebron congratulating josh allen after the game especially with juju who has been great all year even with our offense being horrible we didnt lose the game because juju danced on their logo he wasnt even doing it to disrespect the bills

we just recently had ab have the biggest meltdown ive ever seen a player have and fans still come here and complain about some dumb tiktok video thing it could be worse
holy shit reading the title honestly cracks me up you guys need to relax are you gonna start demanding diontaeben the offensive lineetc need to change how they approach and behave pregame cause we lost it seems like some of you guys have never been apart of a team before people have different personalities not everyone wants to go into a game mean mugging and silent
lol imagine dedicating your entire life to football trainingpractice and then some guy on reddit sees you dancing for 15 seconds and says you dont care about football
i dont mind dancing and having fun thats fine but when you make it an effort to go to the opposing teams logo to go dance on it thats a sign a disrespect in my eyes on top of that when you lose it makes the steelers franchise look worse

jesus christ do you people even look to see if this has been posted 40 times before tossing it up its literally every day with the fucking darnold posts
i would mind personally but is darnold going into free agency
can we just get through this damn season
no matter who our future qb is he deserves better than fichtner at oc


the butterfingers are better lol
are you sure theres a difference
damn when did it become cool to bash our own team especially guys as crucial to our success as dj i remember when the users of this sub wouldnt tolerate this garbage
why we hating sure its funny but imagine he visits this sub or any social media and is greeted with this shit its clearly a mental thing this stuff doesnt help
sadly diontae is probably the best receiver on the roster offense did nothing with him on the bench juju is not a number one receiver

i mean we didnt really give them anything else worth talking about
josh allen is great and im glad hes getting recognition honestly
josh allen is gonna win a super bowl
josh allen couldnt rotate his hip in his passing because collinsworth was hanging off his junk all game
good pass by big ben now lets go back to josh allen
cris this is the seventh week in a row youve shown josh allen in class
did you know that ben has the quickest release time of any quarterback this season he averages 22 seconds

none in the past 20 years i can tell you that

we did have plaxico down at the one against the falcons in 02 though

lol everyone clowning juju doesnt watch our games he aint close to being the issue
its only not okay when they lose
man after a loss this sub gets as touchy as a teen on her period who cares what people are saying
steelers fans in rnfl are the worst im embarrassed by this disgusting disrespect get the fuck out of here
the whole tik tok thing is cringe but to its extremely moronic to say thats why they lost since it gave the bills bulletin board material nobody gives a flying fuck about it
juju is literally carrying whatever offense we have singlehandedly if he leaves and we dont do something drastic to improve the offense next year yall are going to miss the fuck out of him we would be absolutely anemic without him
i think that you can have respect for juju and wish that he stopped the tik tok shit before the game its not one or the other he can do it all he wants in his spare time but focus on the game during gameday

bills defense came out and said they had extra fire after catching juju dancing on their logo before the game started if we as fans and an overall organization think its disrespectful for people to stomp on the terrible towel we probably should think its disrespectful to dance on other teams logos as well
hes gone after this year anyways so who cares
lol its ok let them talk theyve never won before and theyre just happy to be where they are if our team wants to bounce back they will

if not buffalo has the right to run their mouths because they won that said it seems like theyre just giving us bulletin board material lol youd think they completely blew us out with all their talk
many people in the media are not only shitting on the steelers but the steelers fanbase and how sensitive they are i can see why now these threads keep popping up

juju is a grown ass man and making tik tok videos like a 12 year old girl while guys in the background are actually practicing

fucking embarrassing this is some clown ass shit
hes not the reason they are losing but hes an immature clown dancing and tick tocking like a 16 year old girl
im sure hell still be on tiktok next year when hes with the jets

thats not how the cap works
i suggest you do some reading on nfl salaries and how that affects the salary cap

yes we do do a lot of talking and dancing but i disagree with allen that our guys dont work
juju is cringe as fuck good for him i dont give a flying fuck and neither should anybody else let the guy do what he wants its insanely moronic to say that had an impact on the game
embarassing
sounds like the guy is talking rn but maybe thats just me we danced our way to 110 but 2 losses to good teams and suddenly were done i guess
im not tryna dunk on anyone or troll or be a douche im just curious on what fichtner supporters see in him that most of us dont
not defending him but

1 we dont know what plays hes calling and what plays he isnt so really we have no idea whos to blame for our recent struggles i tend to think that many of our offensive struggles are things that should be under his purview so i think hes to blame but none of us here are 100 sure of that

2 week 14 of the season is in the books theres 0 chance of an 112 team making a coaching change at this juncture of the season so its not a matter of whether we like him hes the oc for the rest of the season whether we like it or not
its the overall lack of creativity and imagination how is claypool such a freak that be had so many tds in sept and october but for the last month he has been held to basically nothing the only way we get him the ball is a jet sweep or a deep go route

randy is just too constrictive in todays nfl

and calling for a pass to hawkins on the goal line and not sneaking ben at least once is indefensible
im not a fichtner supporter but i dont think hes as bad as a lot of people make him out to be fichtner is just the scapegoat ben has a lot of control of the offense and gets all the credit when things go well but when things go bad fichtner gets all the blame he deserves some credit for getting them to 110 and does let ben takeover at times something haley refused to do
i think we all know ops shtick by now that this is not an honest question and he will not recognize objectively sensible accurate answers

the answer for anyone who truly is curious is that youre unlikely find anyone who likes fichtner the discourse is not people who like fichtner vs people who dont like fichtner to translate from hillibilly speak to sensible speak people who like fichtner is synonymous with people who can criticize coaches and players alike conversely people who dont like fichtner is synonymous with people who can only criticize coaches and can never admit wrongdoing by certain players who disingenuously ignore any sort of nuance and default to lazily saying its the coachs fault fire him

if it sounds like one side is more biased more emotional and less nuanced thats because it is its not differing opinions of equal merit its nuance versus a lack of nuance its scapegoating versus looking at the whole picture almost everything is wrong with the offense fichtner is just one of many issues and we should all know that hyperfocusing on one imperfection while ignoring the countless others will not fix the unit you can blow your load and replace your engine with the biggest and baddest money can buy but if your steering wheel or front axle remain broken then your car still isnt going anywhere
its not so much that i like him as it is that people blame him for shit that they have absolutely no idea if he was totally to blame for

no one thinks about things with nuance its 100 based on what they see and they assume they know everything but when you have about 5 of the whole picture and try to come to some kind of definitive conclusion it just makes you look foolish
fichtner deserves to be fired after this season hes a terrible oc but can all the blame be put on him i dont think so ben calls the offence as much as randy does he was hired for this reason ben didnt want an outside oc to come in and actually try to coach

if ben comes back next year so will randy
well we set a record for offensive consistency this season before the drops started second in his first year we led the league in redzoneafter losing all pro lb we were bottom 10 for years before that
wish i knew who called the deep bomb on 3rd and 4 where ben through the gamesealing interception without that knowledge youre just guessing if ben or randy is calling the plays

in fairness though diontae johnson is responsible for diontae johnsons lack of offensive production he gets multiple targets per game

i am not a ravens supporter im not giving up on my hate of the ravens just because its convenient i would much rather watch the browns win than the ravens given their not so successful history and my hate for the ravens
i dont care im rooting for the browns in this one
ill never root for the ravens the browns have a solid team i would like to see them finally get over the hump
fuck that go browns not that worried about them taking the division as long as we beat cinci they have to win their next 3 have us lose the colts game and then beat us week 17 i dont see any of that happening and honestly if were not the 1 seed and get the bye idc where we fall
no way fuck those ratbirds tonight doesnt matter if we take care of our own business
no i am a steelers supporter they so happen to benefit more if the ravens win tonight and while i hope that happens that doesnt make me a ravens supporter
nope

nope nope nope nope nope

nope
i am cheering for the new browns to knock out the old browns
no way go browns
its only for 3 hours we will be fine but if you really enjoy it u should be locked up for life
damn i thought you guys hated us but this is the same fan base who cheered for the browns in 2018 so im not surprised
i never ever thought id actually be rooting for baltimore this is uncharted territory
no way fuck baltimore id rather the browns be in the playoffs out of our rivals i hate the browns the least

great video it isnt even just our line its the entire fucking team no one knows how to block and teams couldnt be less scared of us embarassing
also how does a 64 240lb man get absolutely manhandled by a 511 195lb db and when i say manhandled i mean tredavious white made chase claypool his bitch on that play
i wish he would have showed the screen play where decastro was ahead of the back had two dbs directly in front of him and then didnt block either one
feiler looked absolutely terrible in the clips shown here
hey wouldnt you know there were guys open or running routes deep down the field i was told fichtner never calls plays with those routes in them you mean to tell me people here are wrong about something
the whole receiver corps is in a slump right now and getting out of it is going to open up a lot of things i mean you can see the run game sucks because safeties and corners are cheating up in combination with other things once the receivers start catching the ball again theyll revitalize the offense imo i dont think bens deep ball is particularly bad i think receivers just need to step up and play like they were playing in the first half or even last year
our priority this offseason needs to be building an offense that can run the ball get a new running back in the draft draft an offensive lineman and sign one
tired of hearing that we are a mediocre team and our schedule is the easiest in the nfl titans browns 2x colts bills ravens 2x wft under alex smith 51 as a starter the best d line in the league and the eagles 2nd in sacks solid defense and just beat the saintsthats 9 tough games the chiefs who are touted as godtier only blew out two teams jets broncos and play against the same amount of teams with winning records as we do 5 bills raiders dolphins buccaneers saints in an arguably easier division

if you need even more proof we dont suck this was my reply to the mediocre claim in that thread

mediocre bunch besides all of the injuries to our defense missing 5 starters last night 3 that are on ir we have a boatload of talent and execution is far from mediocre we are allowing the least points in the league182 tied leaders with dolphins on takeaways 25 1st in turnover differential 11 1st in sacks 45 1st in rush tds allowed 7 and the defense is on a streak of 70 games with a sack

this falls almost entirely on the offensive play calling unestablished run game throws over the middle and a lack of situational awareness and wr drops which kills drives were averaging 3 tds a game in 2020 ranked 11th up 14 from 2019 roethlisberger conner juju fucking knock off the tiktoks and dancing on team logos like an idiot youre better than that johnson drops washington claypool ebron drops pouncey decastro feiler and villanueva are no slouches randy fichtner and tomlin for not lighting a fire under his ass is singlehandedly ruining our team and any real steelers fan knows that

lets also not forget were razor thin on lb and ol depth and we had avery williamson who hasnt been on our team for two months with the green dot on his helmet last night

if we can fix the offensive game planningcalling get conner back up to 1520 touches a game we tend to do well when that happens and truly address the dropped passes i dont think many teams can fuck with us in the playoffs other than the chiefs colts and bills

lets fucking go steelers get us to that long awaited 7
i dont think many teams can mess with us in the playoffs besides the 3 best teams in the afc

what the hell does that even mean lmao
i love your positivity today lol

realistically we are a top 5 team in the nfl and the other ones on our level are just as flawed in some aspect or another the timing of our rut is just badstartling and i hope our defense can get healthy in time for the post season

things im not worried about bendiontae idcour rbsour defenses talent level even without budbush

things i am worried about our offensive linecoaching adjustmentsour health
we are what our record says we are the boys and coaches needs to get back to the grind hate to say it but ben is the one holding the offense back he flat out refuses to run play action this is carried over to the focus on pass blocking schemes and technique for the oline maybe its all the new bodies on the field some of those throws last night were not sharp i think there is so much bad on the offensive side of the ball to point to one singular issue
arguably nah the chiefs division is absolutely easier they get to play the broncos chokers and the raiders who arent shaping up to be as good as people thought for a while twice and theyve lost to one of those teams almost did it again too but for the sake of being consistent almost doesnt mean shit in this league now im not saying the chiefs arent elite but i just wanna see them held to same standard

i think a factor in it is offense bias people see the steelers offense stagnate in some games and the defense still holds strong and wills us to wins meanwhile the chiefs d is lacking but look kermit throw ball good ive seen people unironically say steelers only won all those games because they have a good defense likelast time i checked that was part of being a good team

i imagine this year or next year is bens last hopefully we can send him off with another chip regardless we gotta prepare for the future how would you guys feel about going after dak prescott or deshaun watson this offseason 40 million is off the books when ben does retire
we should just trade for mahomes instead
the fuck is with all the shitty hot takes on the cap today ben still counts against the cap for 20 million even if he gets cut or retires
opinion be realistic dingus

watson just signed a gigantic contract with houston and i dont see jerry jones giving up on dak so he will most likely get a similar contract and that it not what the steelers need right now
how do you expect to afford either of them when were 21 mil over cap for 2021 were not gutting the team for a qb
gimme deshaun watsonepitomizes what the current qb position has transformed intohes a solid qb better than dak in my opinion
watson already got an extension so he aint leaving houston



unless ben retires this season dak wont be on the free agent market long
watson is staying with the texans even if he isnt hes not in the cap range prescott is just not going to be affordable stop posting these idiodic ideas call the fan if you wanna spout utter nonsense
i would love for the steelers to go after stafford but we are stuck with ben
cannot afford either of them give it up we might be able to find aqb art the bottom of a cracker jack box though thats all they can afford
stafford

but do you also remember all the drama that came with it
ok this one made me audibly laugh


you can tell its photoshop the guy in the picture has hands
and he carries a fanny pack put the football in there
this is great if its actually your content
dionte moncrief johnson
pain
they should make him wear end drops on the back of his helmet
i was not expecting to see him back in the 4th period
that was a solid giggle snort
nice fanny pack now catch the fucking ball please
one thing that annoys me is the thought that he will clean it up you either have great hands or you dont
do this with ebron and call it erock ebron


color me surprised
i thought he had dropped a lot more balls than 12
or is that for a single game
i believe he can turn ir around but is it sophomore slump
damn diontae is my dude too

hes a good oc our line on the other hand

get em aaht
works perfectly also the jim mora 2nd half saints rant is once again a perfect fit i am always seem to come back to that dudes rants every season around this time of year especially
im so tried of this dude these jokes arent funny anymore

lmao perfect
awesome
for some reason i thought it was going to be the you shouldnt have done that meme

will we get him back for playoff time any word on dotson
pain
still no word on dotson which is good
if you are on a contract year and playing for the steelers you better watch out hiltonsuttonjujuconner all better be careful so far feilerdupreebanner have all gone down in contract years
okorofor dotson pouncey decastro banner
feiler sucks at least as a lg he does not sure dotson is the answer either they need to draft some absolute maulers next year rt and og im talking some dudes with mean streaks who will punish people

if im tomlin i shit you not for a full fucking game we running the ball everyone involved doing sweeps running up the middle get mccloud in there juju dionte claypool get our rbs and derek watt involved fuckin hell we runnin win lose i dont give a fuck were not likely to get a bye at this point we runnin

edit the week after that we throwing 100 to dionte johnson and ebron
id give my arm to get munchak back
hilariously bad o line play
draft ol 1st round
i tuned in at work on this play and stopped watching after im bad luck
there are three blocked defenders but not one steeler on the left side made a block two are chasing defenders they missed and one is on the ground
this is what happens when youre line is built to do one thing keep ben upright and yes they are very good at that but when is the last time you remember us running left behind big al it never happens the loss of banner is huge he is very athletic for his size and plays really well in space he wouldve been great in the run game

its also sad to say but decastro and pouncey look like they have a shot to be hofers they both have taken a step back this season
sad part is the bills defensive line is their weakest link
why is this the lines fault for there being almost 9 defenders in the box for us being a team that passes a lot teams sure do have it figured out the rare occasions that we are gonna run lol
this is the shotgun offense ben wanted he thinks the running game just happens by magic
bills vs decastro actually disgusted i just looked at this
zero blocking
i dunno why not fieler rt dotson lg and jukes swing too late to change it now though
what happened to giving claypool a few carries a game those misdirection plays looked like they opened stuff up more later in the game
is this before or after conner danced around for a couple seconds

not discounting the line having issues but conner has been absolute ass too too much bouncing around leading to loses and running right into the pile when there is a gap next to it

player draft positions based on walterfootballcom projections
if the steelers draft trask they need to immediately invest in the offensive line draft guys sign them in free agency whatever trask is a statue back there he reminds me of jared goff not that thats a bad thing im a fan of goff more than most but neither one can extend plays but can make every throw on the field
i was pretty big on lance for a long time whats not to like but

im with you on trask he seems like the perfect fit for the steelers trask with some offensive line in the draftfree agencyand we could get an offense going our scheme while relying off a little boogie in the pocket doesnt rely off a runner i think if canada takes over and has a new guy to mold while ben could mentor a bit there is some potential in it

it is pretty much unavoidable i think that ben is with us for another year at least his cap is
if we were to draft a qb not saying we will who would it be i dont really watch college ik the players and stuff tho
if you click that link it shows my full mock not sure what happened there

its always funny when bengals fans try to talk trash like bro you havent been relevant since the end of obama
ha

spot on
dont you have to think about them to post this though

im sorry but have you seen him on the chiefs or the jets lets be real the line has regressed majorly conner was killer in the year bell held out time went on and the high draft picks went to the defense which is fine with me bush and minkah have been amazing but the oline product has clearly regressed its just a fact it doesnt matter whos at rb theyd struggle
conner isnt a bad back man hes not given the separation and holes that he needs watch he will go to another team next year with a better ol and hell have a great year
bell was amazing

but lets not forget that we had a perfect storm of a great ol in their prime with mike munchak at the helm we also had a passing game that set opposing defenses on their heels and made it impossible to stack the box

i know we never took home a lombardi during that era but man i sure did love watching that machine operate
nah son you see him on the jets with this oline playing in front of him hed be just as pedestrian
dude is a shell of himself ive seen more burst and upside from derek watt
ab was way more beneficial than lb was lol lb ran for less than 4 ypc his last year here
i dream of heath miller
amen
levon bell had done nothing in 2 years had has left pittsburgh nothing

the steelers have always been very loyal to their staff and players and this is the downside that comes with it they often seem to keep deadweight around for a year or two longer than they need to
i do know this for a fact if dionte could catch a ball those first two plays do get us a first after that god knows what
i love how the rooneys are loyal to their staff but they just dont know when to let them go when its necessary

if they keep fichtner around for next year oh boy
biggest gripe ive had with tomlins steelers over the years is when something gets figured out and straight up doesnt work his teams seem to double down on it i dont dislike tomlin as our coach at all but i dislike that
every team scripts the beginning of every game first 1020 plays at least
wait alex has turned on randywow last week he was very critical i think yesterday turned him
i still think he is around because of ben ben gets to call plays because randy isnt wound to question him
down side to the rooneys theyre far too loyal
ive been saying this for the last year there is no greater indictment on fitchner than the offense being consistently awful on opening drives that is 100 on the oc
okay so real talk what good young innovative ocstobe are out there and available
the steelers offensive philosophy early in games is to probe and prod and test things and figure out how the defense is going to try to defend them so that they can start doing things to take advantage of that slow starts are partially by design
one has to wonderif theyre scripting the first x plays why dont they do it in a hurry up offense to at least gain that advantage over the defense

i liked how after that one game several weeks ago where they scored on the opening drive they were all like you guys can stop talking about that now sorry guys one fluke where your opening script works isnt enough to convince anyone your problem with slow starts is fixed
theyre keeping fichtner because ben wants to keep fichtner dont be fooled it aint just randy whos responsible for shitty play calling ben is a 17 year qb playing in empty stadiums theres literally never been a better time to check out of a bad call if he wanted to

x doubt

the bills were fucking terrible in the first half if it gave them fire they would have come out firing on all cylinders allen looked like bootleg tommy maddox in the first half everyone just looking for a bills storyline to make them look better than they are they beat an injured steelers defense and a team with quite literally no offense lol
no it really doesnt
fuck the bills
weird how you guys are calling poyer a liar instead of acknowledging juju being an idiot
just as the title says i cant remember any plays of the top of my head that included presnap motion last night what give seemed like that was the bread and butter of the successful offense we had to start the year
there was announcers even pointed out that bills always react to pre snap motion we just dont do the sweeps anymore because those werent working for a while now
ben probably didnt like it so they shitcanned it
i think chase claypool had a jet sweep in the first quarter
i know that hes been wildly inconsistent this season and drops are his middle name but i think that benching really helped im well aware that its too early to tell but in the limited action he got after that he seemed a lot more focused and a lot more confident so lets hope he can keep this up
probably no one is beating him up more than he is himself
you could tell he was upset on the sideline we know what hes capable of and i expect him to bounce back forsure
he needs to step up but i wont kill him too many other culprits whole offense needs to play a lot better
the guy is open majority of plays and hes our best receiver after reception and hes been on his game all year its all mental right now hell be just fine but i have to say fans dogging the guy constantly isnt going to help him i wish we could be more supportive
his performance has been bad as hell but hes not guilty of the team situation out oc is trash it seems our qb is injured and that doesnt help at all a lot of things around the team right now dont help diontae is just a part of it
i thought the steelers handled that perfectly sit him for a couple quarters and put him back in in the second half where he caught four balls
thank you for this the sub has been gross lately with kicking the man while hes down
no hes complete trash i want him off my fucking team
tomlin needs to stick to hire guns and bench whoever cant catch the ball for whoever can its a young squad and that wr1 spot can be anyones at this point i think i get hes flashy and i think hes a big play kinda guy too but you are a professional athlete now second year at that be better diontae
yeah no
at least hes not tic tokn midfield imagine if a player did that to a terrible towel
id definitely lean for baltimore as much as saying that leaves a nasty taste in my mouth

view poll
ratbirds a baltimore win means the steelers can clinch the division by beating the bengals next week


but after rooting for those bastards in purple make sure you take a shower
steelers clinch the division with a ravens win
yall are pussies for hoping the ravens take care of the browns for you

would love to see what this sub would have looked like in 2008 when the titans blew us out to claim the 1 seed
its not even the defense the defense is fine i think we give up at least 24 points still to the bills even with a healthy defense they are good the offense is playing like shit quick passes and runs for a yard or two its gets pretty easy to catch on after a quarter i mean jesus christ we can throw three completed passes and still have a 4th and short these young wrs are quick and elusive give them time to run routes maybe they wont drop so many
the offense is really really not good all the major injuries are on the defensive side and they have looked competent over the last 3 weeks

you cant blame injuries for continuing to run the same formation over and over removing the pre snap motion we were doing earlier in the year and dj leading the league in drops

if claypool doesnt draw pi or the defense doesnt give them a short field this offense is anemic at best

im not saying they werent doing good things early in the year but they got figured out by good defenses and have shown no interest or ability to adjust and then took things away from an already predictable offense pre snap motion

im hoping they use the bengals to try some new stuff out and right the ship but i fear we will sneak out a w doing the same old stuff and will come back to reality against the colts
thing is it might be too late to fix it or recover
and 3 games in 12 days
they tried the sweep with claypool one time and it got blown up after that they went away from it thats another thing get that kid more involved in the offense hes so much more useful then trying to cause a pass interference
espn analysts nobody gets rid of the ball quicker than ben this season

yeah no kidding hes throwing 3 yard passes and not allowing the receivers to anticipate the throw its not a good thing
i am honestly not terribly surprised by the recent losses they have been working on the assumption that there will be a game to play every week since september of course they are tired and more injury prone it sucks i just hope everyone can get healthy and do well in the playoffs
and the injuries arent even the issue the defense is still great not saying they dont miss bud bush and the rest but theyre holding it up

now the offense they need to change a lot they dont need rest
its because the offense cant stay on the fucking field for more than 4 plays at a time
is there any chance to just win the division and then rest everybody
my reaction when i hear myles garrett is the browns walter payton man of the year nominee
im confused was week 4 not a bye
wft with alex smith is a different animal than with dwayne haskins or kyle allen and buf is very obviously a top contender who is just now getting healthy some of yall need to chill
fire the coaches
youve had two byes you just dont want to admit it and like to play victim
hoping for a ravens win slaps myself in the sack did i really just say that hate to say it but the browns are catching up and need to be stopped
its honestly a giant bowl of not giving a fuck to be honest

steelers need to just win and not worry about anyone else at this point
my first instinct is to root for baltimore but i really dont want the stress that would come with staring down a 2 vs 7 first round game against them and itd also just be hilarious if they miss the postseason this one is tough
i live in ohio browns fans are insufferable fuck the browns
i feel dirty rooting for either but id rather the ratbirds win cause then the doodoos arent right on our ass
rooting for the ravens yuck i hate browns fans the most and their pain sustains me
a fucking tie that way neither of them wins
asteroid
would rather a ravens win just threw up in my mouth a little but i think the browns win 2817
used to live on cleveland im rooting for the browns what the ravens did to the browns is unforgivable im taking this resentment to my grave
i kinda have a soft spot for the browns since dad is a fan and hes 82 that being said i forget what browns fans are like when they are anywhere above 500 the think they already won something i chalk that up to a large portion of browns fans are buckeye fans whose douche baggery know no bounds sorry dad go ravens
i know theyre the rivals but the ravens need to win i felt bad for the players being exposed to the covid bs so tonightjust this one timeill root for the ratbiri meanravens
personally im not sure how much it matters at this point
not rooting for either my psychology is that im rooting for the best scenario for the steelers makes me feel less dirty
my thoughts are we dont want to meet any divisional rival in the playoffs i guess the ravens winning is the best chance at preventing that
dont think it really matters i havent seen anything over the last couple weeks that makes me think well do much in the postseason everything we do on offense allows the opponent to put 8 in the box and shut us down our defense has to spend so much time on the field theyre dead tired by the 4th quarter another season of what could have been
so i hung up and dialed 911 assuming that was code for him being held for ransom


seriously fuck the ravens
fuck rooting for the ratbirds if we cant win 2 of 3 or 1 win against the browns we dont deserve the division id rather the ratbirds miss the playoffs
i know in theory we want the ravens to win i find myself still rooting against them if we cant win what we need to to win the nfc northafc i meant lol than we dont deserve it fuck the ravens
i mean it works to our benefit if they win this game if they dont the browns are only one game behind us i dont know about you but the steelers offense has looked awfully sketchy to me lately and id rather us not be the laughing stock of the nfl if the browns were to some how overtake the division
im 100 rooting ravens lol

think the north may come down to beating them last game of season
doodoos getting some friendly fumble bounces and penalty calls
nfl trying to get browns a win tonight
entertaining but very sloppy game so far
nah
lamar from the locker room lol
so your saying browns take the north

looking back at 2017 offense and imagining this defense together we would be unbeatable
oh its third and 2 and were just outside of field goal range better throw a bomb deep downfield to benny snell theyll never see it coming
one wasted possession coming right up
even having leveon bell would be a major upgrade to out offense hed have 150 plus yards receiving per game with fichtner as coordinator at least then all the screen passes and running back draws would make sense
the only team in the nfl that has punted more than us is the jets 62 punts vs 65 this season

its a fucking miracle we have any wins at all lol
lmao pretty much
no no no its run up the middle for 1 on first down shitty screen on 2nd down throw 5 yards short of the 1st down on 3rd and a small punt
i know we are supposed to root for the ravens to win but i just cant do it fuck the ravens if we cant win the division after starting 110 then we dont deserve it
rooting for the meteor
u no what u dont have to root for the ravens cause if they still win they help us out but that dont mean we gotta cheer for them no what im saying
if we can secure the division before week 17 we can make it an effective bye week
i feel you i dont really have anything against the browns and i was really hoping they would put the ravens down either way that was one of the best games ive seen all season
the enemy of my enemy still aint my friend
nah im fully supporting them right now
fuck baltimore ill never root for em in any circumstance like you said if we cant clinch up then we dont deserve it
im going for browns the way i see it who do i not want to see in the playoffs thats the ravens

steelers made playoffs anyways and ive given up on the 1 seed so it doesnt matter about winning the division to me
i was really hoping for a tie because that wouldve muddied the waters so much not just for these two teams but for the whole playoff picture
scorching hot take lamar jackson is not a quarterback
rooting for the ratbirds is like sleeping with your sister sure shes a great piece of tail with a blouse full of goodies but its just illegal then you get into that whole inbred thing kids with no teeth who do nothing
ravens need to lock it up rn momentum is shifting hard
fuck the ravens
this game was crazy browns will roast us

i would rather put something spiky in my ass
matt canada and josh dobbs for oc 2021

haley turned our offense into a juggernaut he was just overcomplicated in the redzone fichtner is literally ass
haley is more trash as a person and fitchner is more trash as an oc
todd haley and arians would run laps around fitchner
idk i was a fan of todd haley until it seemed like his ego was getting the better of him he and randy seem like two leaves from the same branch but people really need to understand todd haley completely built the system to which weve had so much offensive success over the years

randy isnt a flashy oc but hes done good things for us too i really didnt think he deserved the job but he improved our offense in 2018 idk what to say this year his play calling has been terrible so has our ol though its hard to play call when you have to throw out 34 of the play book because the line cant handle it
fuck it the defense can do it by them selves
haley ran the ball and utilized the weapons he had on offense he too loved the fucking bubble screens but he was doing that more early on to protect ben from himself
stop the cap lol our offense was way better under haley and even arians

i get that keeping ben healthy means getting his body away from some of the traffic in the trenches but this offense seems broken in some fundamental ways theres no physical presence on the line of scrimmage the offense has no creativity despite having several plus skill position players im happy to blame fitchner but i like to ask the question the might answer why tomlin is going with this
being in shotgun helps our shitty line because it gives them more space to maneuver also allows ben extra time to scan the defense before the pressure gets to him

play action only works with a threat of a run game and solid line play we have neither
letsgo pretty much covered it play action takes more time than our like can block for as far as shotgun ben seems to want to do that helps him scan the d but he may also not like playing under center because of the risks to his knees lot more legs to avoid it hurts the running game for sure without a dynamic runner but our blocking isnt going to cut it either way
i think it is bens preference
no pa is on ben he doesnt like turning his back to the defense

news flash some nfl players are drowning in women and are unfaithful
nypost
fake news
ah yes the stalwart of journalistic excellence that is the ny post
ny post is trash who gives a shit about some bitter side piece
honestly ill probably get downvoted to oblivion but who gives a fuck shitty thing to do on the players part but whoever it is isnt paid by this team to not have side chicks as long as he isnt doing anything that could get him fined or suspended i dont care what consenting adult he sticks his dick in
first of all ny post

but second of all even if its true who cares 8 feel like its something that definitely couldve just been handled in house idk the need to expose him other than for attention it almost feels like a rihavesex post on her part lol
lol the ny post
i love how she says she doesnt care hes with other girls until she finds out one has the label of official gf which makes her a bottom feeder so she rats him out bc she ultimately thought she would be the one

lol hes a douche but so is she i fucking hate what social media has done to the human psyche
the question now his who is the player sure it doesnt matter as long as hes bringing it on the field but still kinda wanna know lol
lol why you always trusting thots

been a fan since the 70s bleed black and goldyellow im not a fair weather fan im here through thick and thin

to those that want to gobye
you clearly never even read through the game day threads during games we actually won
i must say being around this sub for awhile now it has gotten a lot better i dont like all the turning on our team stuff but at the end of the day it stems from passion and love for the game i spoke with my dad about it earlier and its like if you cheer for a baseball team and they play like garbage well theyll play tomorrow or even later that day as a double header in football its once a week the anticipation is much greater and the weight of the loss is much more significant

that being said i am someone who is also fed up with people saying foolish things i post positive things that apart a convo not saying im perfect some people may think im a bozo cuz i dont post harsh things so in no way am i saying im a perfect example i guess all im saying here is we all process a loss differently and if it means anything this sub is actually very very positive and is filled with a lot of insightful people i wouldnt close the door just yet cheers man
i live 20milea outside da burgh aint no escaping it even if i wanted to im not even mad though this has been a great year so far aside from the fucking injuries that wont fuck off but yeah go stillers
steelers fans arent very nice now i know why people say ohhh you like the steelers

i think it is ok to be upset or frustrated with how the team has been playing lately but i agree that the excessive hate and lack of support is totally overreacting and does no good to neither the team nor the fanbase
ask any yinzer if theyd take 112 and 2nd in the afc back in august and theyd be salivating they lost the 1 seed but theyll have their shot theyve played a bunch of games in a short period and have had some bad covid scheduling circumstances and injuries theyll get it turned around for a good run it wont be easy but when have any of the super bowl runs hopefully cincy is what the doctor ordered theyre not playing their best football now but have set themselves up to have a few off weeks by winning so many to start the season i am enjoying not having to scoreboard watch this year
i love my boys ive been seeing the flaws since dallas teams with incredibly fast offense and even faster defenses are gonna give us problems bills defense was a confirmation corners were right up against our wr all game they know what we are running its so obvious and yet this is all we got ben cant run and conner is compromised im very surprised we were able to last this long doing the same thing over and over again but hey if it aint broke dont fix it except it is broken now so whats the fix i have no idea
apparently a hot take around this sub but you can still be a fan and be critical of the team youre rooting for
seems to be a lot of hate watching fans every gameday thread im bummed with the injuries and lack of run game but if watching football made me that angry id find a new outlethobby some of yall need therapy

i rewatched parts of last nights game and one thing that caught my attention was that bens throws looked a bit off its like he was just trying to push the ball with his arm and there was no support from his legs i am not an expert but something didnt look right its like there was no weight transfer at all maybe the knee injury he suffered in the cowboys game is still bothering him it would also explain the complete lack of practice before the washington game
yep you can tell the difference from the beginning of the season
duck hodges super bowl run
the real question is when isnt he
no look i love ben but hes just old hes run down the fact hes still playing somewhat well is remarkable but hes just playing like an old man now which would be working out fine if our receivers could catch the ball
id heavily consider playing rudolph they sat ben in 2011 and that was with the division on the line the division is all but clinched now and they basically need a miracle to get the bye they should be able to beat cincy with rudolph

i laughed and frowned
i just cackled audibly
9 rushing touchdowns in a single game basically an nfl record


i hope fichtner didnt see todays game hes going to have a stroke just by trying to comprehend how 2 teams can run the ball efficiently
so whats the scenario now we beat the bengals and were the champs of the north or do we have to beat the browns too
what is a run game you mean that things where we give the ball to james connor to intentionally lose a down
steelers would get destroyed by both browns and ravens as they sit right now
i missed the third quarter why the hell is mcsorley in the game

edit spelling
this game is exciting as hellwe wouldnt even be able to compete like this presently ravens better not fuck us
yup
i cant wait till in the coming years we get rid of fichtner and eventually have a good run game and play calling hopefully we still have keith butler then too and most of our defensive guys to get a super team
glad the ravens won i was nervous wed lose the division if the browns had won
our offensive line needs to be just as retooled as our gameplans
really want the steelers to draft najee harris
yeah pretty much
add play calling to the list too
not only a running game but a quarterback who is mobile as well

dont get me wrong i love ben he can definitely still throw but i think its time to start grooming his replacement
gus edwards is like the ravens 3rd best running back but hed be a starter for us
i was thinking about how much i miss it the whole game
the fucking ravens are getting it together
how about first round running back and incorporating watt into run blocking
lev bell
i too think that the steelers should preternaturally have a 1 ranking in all aspects of football every season
funny because i remember when that was all they did
i have never understood why they dont do qb sneaks more often ben is a big strong guy and yet when they get on the goal line hell stay in the gun

in fact i dont understand why they stay in the gun every play

in fact i dont understand why they even pretend to try and run it why do that when you can throw it 75 times
losing munchak has been a huge problem that coupled with fichtner being totally inept and we cannot run the ball
i wonder if that guy the chiefs just signed this season will be available soon s
run game pass game hell at this point ill even take the rapper the game shit is getting out of hand boys
or an offense that is willing to attack multiple levels of a defense consistently throughout a game

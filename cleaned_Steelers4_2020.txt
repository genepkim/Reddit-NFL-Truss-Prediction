tes are barely involved through two games 89 has been invisible and while ebron has had a couple targets and catches hes also shown to be a liability in blocking

this is likely to become a serious problem as the steelers move on to tougher opponents tes are key to offense flexibility and selling run threats the steelers barely use play action obviously 7 is no running threat and the oc is on the predictable side as a play caller that means they have to outexecute the opposition on every play since they almost never win on scheme its not a good sign against elite defenses
this is an offense that used tes almost exclusively for blocking and check down passes for at least a decade just because they signed a guy like ebron and still have vance doesnt mean theyre going change up their playbook all that much so early in the season especially with a veteran qb returning from a year of rehab theyre already using a lot of new motions and misdirection handoffspa thanks to the input of matt canada as theyve done in the past with promising rookie receivers id imagine theyll slowly increase ebrons usage as a receiving threat as the season goes on that likely goes for derek watt too as he continues to heal up and get the timing down on run plays theyll likely use him more when dereks out there theyre usually lined up in a two te set from those sets you can expect more play action passes to the two tes

as for why there hasnt been as much play action so far its probably because play action puts your qb sitting behind a promising but still unproven offensive line waiting for downfield routes to develop said qb is old and returning from a year long injury rehab as the season continues and bens durability is less off a question mark you can expect more play action
i cant quite figure out common attitudes among steelers fans

on the one hand one might make a good point they paid some money to ebron i wish he would have more of an obvious positive impact

on the other hand fans can go offthewalls bonkers with acting like the sky is falling if this minor imperfection is not fixed this is likely to become a serious problem as the steelers move on to tougher opponents its not a good sign against elite defenses with an attitude like this i imagine that if op gets a papercut he acts like his arm is falling off

this is a common attitudebelief so ill take this opportunity to ask the op why he shares this common attitudebelief why would you choose to believe that anything resembling an imperfection means that theyre doomed against teams you perceive to have better ratings than the defenses theyve faced already im not saying that the tes have had the impact were hoping for thats not the point the point is to ask why you extend that to mean that all else the team has going for it will all be moot since apparently you imagine a team will somehow successfully exploit one imperfection know what team has an elite defense the steelers and acknowledging the short fields and penalties that kept drives alive they just allowed 21 points to jeff driskel you really think an offense with roethlisberger these top four receivers and now weve seen two 100 yard rushers in two different games will struggle because of the tes step back from the ledge calm down its not that bad

by all means this could be an interesting post and ebronmcdonald could be an interesting discussion but not if it comes with the air of its a miracle were not 02 without a perfect offense that can kill you with its wrs rbs and tes and were screwed if we play anyone better
hypothetically why do you want to put something on tape for your next opponent that you dont have to
the guys havent exactly been suffering offensively the last two weeks this week was closer that it should have been because the refs got snippy in the second half and the defense got hit with some series they couldnt get off the field on the coaching staff isnt playing fantasy 1 point more than the other team is all you need
i dont disagree but ebron had more yards than james washington third most targets on the offense yesterday
we have like seven viable pass catchers soaking up targets in the passing game giving more of them to big slow guys and fewer to juju diontae claypool etcthis seems like a questionable strategy to me
ebrons drawing coverage away from the wrs and vance while better than ebron at blocking isnt particular doing great either

ebrons done good from my viewpoint so far vance not so much
i dont see why we arent utilizing chase claypool as a te he is a big powerful guy and having him in that position would bolster our offense in every way from what i can see am i missing something here

i think our d is good
alualu really impressed me yesterday
bince is so underrated
love seeing all our guys on this list but its as expected after games against the giants and backupled broncos so far

lets hope we keep it going as we get deep into the season i have faith that our defense itself hasnt fully gelled just yetwhich is a terrifying thought for the league
notice how tj is the only one with an int and our guys combine for 6 pds too
always found vince pretty unremarkable solid enough but hes looked very good so far this year imo
jesus so many steelers lol love it
as everyone expected nickel corner mike hilton
tj watt tied for 1st in sacks btw with chase young
wheres cam heyward
hey sorry whats tfl i feel like im a veteran observer but havent ever seen the sack stat broken down this way before so if could tell me what each is means id really appreciate it
so cam still has more ints then minkah
nothing makes me laugh harder than the fact that someone traded 1s and is gonna pay jamal adams nearly 20m per year and mike hilton would cost no draft capital and maybe at most 8m per
i think bush is going to be solid but devin white is a stud

your nfl leader in ypc
claypool and dj on the outside juju in the slot big ben firing on all cylinders
man i just love claypools energy enthusiasm and passion for football he seems to be a highcharacter hard worker and im just so damn excited to watch his career unfold at pittsburgh
this young man seems to be as positive as he is good i want to see than big play grin week in and week out

big dude working off the defender grabbing a dime and tossing on the afterburners for a score he is like the second coming of plax martavis was the false prophet
its going to be so much fun watching this guy skies the limit
and making special teams tackles
claypool looks like hes going to be an absolute stud in these upcoming games
this kid is sharp and most importantly confident right off the rip love this dude
i am very happy for him just wish there were fans there for him to hear the crowd erupt for his first td hes the real deal
ill say it again this kid is going to be special hes tall fast muscular and has great hands our whole wider receiver and tight end core is stout and its going to be difficult to double everyone im really thinking that our offense is going to be on the field more once we tighten up a few things
this kid is like martavis but with a functional pair of hands and a brain
he has elite push off skills almost ab like lol
best 11 in the league the other one gave me 4 fantasy points this week i might just sign this one
mapletron is warming the bench on all of my fantasy teams i might actually be able to sub him in on a bye week if he keeps this up
this guys a stud
first of many
abbotsfords very own

me the biggest of brains wanting mcfarland to start
keep putting snell in and wait for him to miss an easy block ben isnt getting back up hes grabbing his shoulder
i think the truth is both of them are too inconsistent but conners ball handling compared to snell gives him the edge
if you take away his single long run of the game he was 15 for 47yds

snell was 3 for 5 yds

im not saying that snell is better or the answer but i am not convinced of connors greatness either any back can break a long one and push their total to over 100 but averaging 3 yds a carry is not going to cut it
i have one of these for dionte too
1st off we should be thankful we have two really three with js solid options at rb no point in complaining about an abundance of riches second and more importantly conner is the better back than snell for a variety of reasons which is why tomlin will go with him when hes healthy jcs pass blocking catching and ability to get open in a qb scramble situation are significantly better than snells jcs bad luck with injuries the past two years has really turned yall against him which is sad to seelets just hope he can stay healthy and if he cant well then weve got snell who is a great backup
i think the decision will eventually get made for all of us when conner inevitably gets hurt again
it was a bit annoying after snells great game that they said theyd split carries and snell got the ball 3 times also i think benny has a better performance against the giants than connor did against denver because connor got over half his yards on 1 play in garbage time they should actually split carries of lot give more to benny
ride the hot hand
at this point im ready to see what mcfarland has
most of conners yards came on one play admittedly one big play at a big time but regardless he had a pretty pooraverage game outside that last carry

that said ill take that every day over a guy who fumbles snell shouldnt play until he can learn to take care of the ball two fumbles in two games one of which he barely played isnt what lead backs are made of

i think they should both continue getting snaps the thing is even if we want conner to start his body isnt able to take 20 attempts a game he runs way too hard and hell just get hurt
listen steelers fans want every player to start and every player to be benched at the same time its just what this sub is like
late to the party but hopefully not too late i think the reason why snell is not getting more snaps is because of his pass blocking if snell is in the game ben and fichtner lose the ability to comfortably have the rb drop in pass protection this tells the defense it will either be a run or they can blitz equal numbers and most likely gets through the rbs assignment
i dont understand why we dont run rbbc if we have multiple viable starters i havent paid enough attention to both guys to say for sure if theyre both viable but connor seems unreliable on his own party of the issue could be the line they dont look great
at least conner doesnt fumble and he can catch he cant run though
conner will inevitably get hurt

this is the way
we are missing the right half of our line and ppl out here consistently and constantly wanting to blame james conner he displayed great vision on three runs out of multiple formations too idk where ppl are getting off saying he cant run out of the shotgun when he even scored his tiddy that way and had little to no room on most other carries
no i am still 100 percent behind snell
with an amazing start to a season dupree is looking like his last season was not a fluke having dupree and watt coming off the edge is just insane and i hope it continues like this but if dupree keeps his performance up is it even possible to keep him or will we not have the salary to spread around what do you guys think
starting to think its very unlikely last season he played well enough to justify the franchise tag price for this season and hes off to a just as good if not better start

but colbert has surprised us all before
it actually might be a possibility the aav of his contract might be close to the franchise tag and theyre affording it now were gonna have some cap casualties regardless but i feel like keeping bud and tj together should be a priority especially after seeing how good theyve been to start the season
finances have potential to be really really weird in covid world no point even beginning to guess
theres no way i feel like hes gonna be getting close to a 4 year 80 million contract with someone else
i think that this offseason well have juju bud and watt to sign well be able to afford 2 of those guys and i think even then itll be watt and juju i think that bud is pricing himself further out of our reach with every great game he has

id love to see the steelers prove me wrong though
someone will have to be sacrificed for watts megadeal seeing that we just extended heyward bud is most likely gone hoping highsmith can use this year to learn as much as possible before he ultimately starts next year
not unless ben retires
no hes playing incredible again and unless he gets hurt hes not going to be in our ballpark even if we restructure the shit out of people we will be unable to afford him i dont eant to lose him because hes always been an elite run stopper but since hes developed a pass rush hes as good as gone hope we get jima ring on the way out cuz dudes put up with alot of hate since he got signed
penciling in a 3rd round compensatory pick
i feel like playing across from watt will lower his value a bit not certain that other teams will be ready to pay him top dollar but who knows i wouldnt exactly be surprised if a desperate team offered him an enormous deal

in any case i honestly think it would be irresponsible to sign both watt and dupree to massive deals its too much money for one position
dupree and hilton will go tough but you cannot pay everyone heavy vet contracts and tj will get his soon minkah too in two to four years ben and pouncey retire and it will be the first opportunity in decades to clean up the salary cap situation
i would say no hes playing like a 20m kinda guy well see what the cap looks like i suppose but not a great chance
if he was on his final year and then next year his first tag we could possibly work something out trying to roll the dice on a low costrookielike qb but ben having another year makes bud staying here a near impossibility after cams extension

i have faith that we will sign all 3 tj bud juju

we will lose hilton tho without a doubt
lol nope
bud is gone and im fine with that to be honest the standard is the standard next man up lets go
overthecap has us 159m over the cap next season with bud hilton sutton av feiler juju and conner all free agents

9999999 chance hes walking
anybody know if and when the team is rockin the color rush unis this season
20 bucks says thanksgiving since its a home tnf game
my money is on dallas and the thanksgiving night game if were doing it twice

on another note why arent they selling more color rush jerseys

i can only find a tj watt in sizes s and m right now online
lol i have holmes wallace ab and juju jerseys who cares if they are only on the team for a year or more if they make an impact in the black and gold its worth representing them for life
he is always talking to his players you see so many coaches on the sideline buried in their playsheets or just talking with assistants tomlin is always congratulating teaching and chatting with the guys

i dont know why it took 12 years for me to notice this juxtaposition
hes not into burying his nose in playsheets and things of that nature
hes probably one of the most liked coaches in the game
at the end of the day tomlins strength has always been his relationships with the players and his leadership you can see that over the years the players buy in to coach t with a few obvious exceptions
hes a players coach for sure reminds me of a more well tempered pete carroll in a lot of ways
hes one of the guys i feel such a different sense of familybrotherhood with the steelers and its not just because theyre my favorite team something about them has always felt different you can tell that they all are friends and really enjoy the sense of family among one another

santonio is one of my all time favorites the way he left or more accurately was sent away combined with us getting antonio brown with the pick we got kinda turned him into a forgotten man

but i love seeing him being embraced and welcomed back over the last few years and he always speaks positively of his time here

hilton was everywhere yesterday i went to the restroom at halftime and there he was just wrapping that shit up
what a pathetic rep for vannett wouldnt normally call out a guy like this but he deserves it for throwing shade at the organization as having the wheels fall off when they went 88 without their star qb

i know we were trying to salvage the season and it almost worked but with hindsight vannett wasnt worth anything close to the 5th round pick we traded to get him and to think he was brought in for his skills as a blocker
i fucking love this guy
personally a huge fan of hilton i think hes underrated solid player imo
my favorite vannett moment yesterday was when he just randomly tripped over his own feet and fell over
ive been saying for years hilton is basically a linebacker dude just provided clinic film for holding contain on the edge forcing the rb back inside and ripping off the block sick
hes such a dynamic player he just seems to come through in huge and unexpected ways consistantly

much love mike heres to a healthy productive season
fuck vannett dude trashed the organization after he left because he didnt get much playing time hope you are happy being 02 ya douche
fuck nick vannett
wow that is embarrassing lmao cross post to nfl maybe they like shit like this usually
never underestimate the leverage a short guy can get if he gets under your pads
hes one of my fav steelers that one game a couple of years ago where he got a hatrick of really nice sacks
he is simply built different
this was my favorite play of the game
vannett thought it was a good thing he left the steelers we think too vannett we think too
nick vannett that is a name i have not heard in a long time long time
pancaked and still made the play
flawless

watt makes this stop possible not hilton hilton does not set the edge and force the runner back inside the play was designed to hit the gape between the tackle and tight end vannett is trying to get him up field as much as possible as the tackle and guard look to zone block watt hilton does a good job of not getting washed out of the play but if watt doesnt close the hole then the rb is into the third level with a blocker and one man to beat honestly if the rb had tried to hit the hole instead of bouncing it out its probably a first down

i love it
whats the name of the monitor
i will never not smile at that picture
i kind of miss that bengals rivalry
is this a basement the ceilings looks really low here
the moment juju went legend
cause juju making the path ahead and minkah and troy got your back
hey steelers nation

ive typically only bought jerseys from nfls site or the steelers shop but sometimes they dont have the player youre looking for or correct size today i stumbled on a site called steelersedgeonline when i google searched ryan clark jersey im not sure if the site is legit does any here know

ive heard about dhgate but im kinda skeptical on it i dont want to risk getting a cheap or knock off jersey no offense to anyone here who purchases from there i understand people may not want to spend 100200 on a jersey i personally dont mind i guess its just one of my expensive habits lol thanks for any feedback
id google reviews of the site specifically im always weary using those third party sites
tbh if im looking for something to buy online i check reddit to see if anyone has bought something from that particular site
ive bought numerous jerseys from dhgateother chinese sellers im an avid lurker of rsportsjerseys too anyway out of all of them i bought i only got 1 that was bad and i have never worn it the sleeves were fucked up so bad aside from that 1 outlier all of the other ones are pretty good for 25

real ones you can obviously go to nflshop steelerscom or you can try dicks sporting goods walmart target amazon etc never heard of steelersedgeonline you can try it but with paypal or a credit card and if its fake you can possible issue a complaint
i like dhgate ive never gotten an nfl jersey from there but ive gotten nba jerseys and they look good it takes about a month for them to ship though
if youre buying dhgate youre buying a knock off no doubt about it if you want official youre going to pay official prices especially in season i honestly dont think knock off is bad though especially when all the players i want to get might leave soon last jersey i bought was antonio and my rationale was even if he left there will already be so many good memories that i wont regret it but then immediately things took a turn south i might try to get a knock off juju or watt to hold me over now honestly i dont hate the steelers basketball jerseys that appear on the chinese markets either
ive purchased a jersey from this website it was a big ben color rush they look pretty legit was really happy with my purchase just ordered a tj watt jersey as well waiting for it to be delivered hope this helps

im very glad he played so well especially since well probably need to invest some more capital into our oline in the near future hopefully he keeps it up and he can be a reliable starter for us
assuming decastro is back next week i bet dotson returns to the bench but if things were to go sideways at rt down the road kicking feiler back out there and moving dotson to lg has to be in their heads nice back up plan to have
i know we brought this guy in on the strength of his run blocking the fact that he is not a point of weakness in the passing game is a fantastic sign

edit typo
early returns on this draft class have been good
his dad definitely earned the game ball for raising him
not anywhere close to being sure enough to tab him with a sack but i thought i saw one play where he and chuks coordination was not ideal looked like chuks will own the sack and probably should but its hard to tell who dropped their assignment i think kd ended up doing nothing on the play in question and that always makes me think twice
steelers guard kevin dotson in 2020

passblock snaps 43
qb pressures allowed 0

only rookie offensive lineman with 10 passblock snaps and zero qb pressures allowed

wasnt he one of those guys that pundits said was an absolute steal
need to keep ben upright indeed
the big s i x n i n e
he started 4 years at louisiana why didnt he just start at lg this season and keep fieler at rt

it gives me hope that randy is not as dumb as we think he is
honestly ive had ebron on my fantasy team several times since he was drafted years ago he always seemed to have all of this potential and would often disappoint from my meaningless fantasy perspective but only because i wasnt going out of my way to watch lions games to see how inconsistent the team as a whole was he has really changed my opinion about him in just two weeks here through how much people talk him up and his own personality

interesting to see how a team dynamic can really affect a player both good and bad from a numbers andor human perspective



source the very noticeable audible play call pringle monday
i just bought a can of taco flavored pringles
that oh face is never going away i love it
black butter
pringle monday that feeling you get after a steelers victory the fun dont stop when the play clock drops


i regret nothing
lold
if we beat the texans gonna photoshop big ben riding bush
save it for the ravens this team was bad and most of them were injured and we still almost blew it

nothing to gloat about this week take the w and be glad we got it


i met kordell and talked with him for like 45 minutes hes a super cool dude
legit kordell is still an all time favorite player of mine slash was a stud
if stewart played today the results may have been different but dude was still so fun to watch either way
only ten bucks i guess you can say the price of that jersey wasreduced by a large amount
i bought a kirkland jersey for like 35 this year first jersey i bought in years it was a great investment
kordell was good will defend him where did you get it
i wish i had a jersey
slash at the time i loved the shit out of him and had to defend him constantly now i realize how ben has spoiled us for almost two decades
slash he was lightning in a bottle in the 90s
got cheated big time in that 01 afc championship

hilton was that dude yesterday i like that plays being made arent by the usual suspects every time
because we take good pictures
100 agreed this team is so damn cool with an abundance of characters juju the most likeable wr if not player in the league the coolest coach class acts like villanueva conner heyward haden pouncey all over the place funny dudes like bince and zach low key guys with a good attitude like ben watt minkah dupree washington tuitt and vance then fresh talent with enthusiasm in diontae ebron terrell bush snell and claypool i fin love this team even when they were getting crushed last year it was still fun as hell them being 20 now just makes it that much sweeter i sound like a homer idc here we go

edit cant believe i forgot another low key hero bozgod
id like to see us put up a great game against the texans this week we should have beat the breaks off of denver last week it was embarrassing how close that game became

i think were a good bit away from being the best but luckily all you gotta do in the nfl is make the playoffs and then anything can happen im confident against anyone with this squad chiefs are the better team but that doesnt mean we cant beat them and thats all that matters
but this was from a previous year when we werent the best team in the league i think you just invalidated your own point by using an old photo
awesome pic
thought this picture was from the broncos game for a second and i realized that a there are fans and b conner is in a sideline sweatsuit i cant wait to be at heinz field again waving my terrible towel with you all
yall seen the ravens yet
one of these things is not like the others
i just realized theres 2 people in that pic with number 22 on their helmet
after yesterdays performance you dont get the gold key to the crapper just yet

yall got some work to do

i know mm is an ass but i kinda agree with him the offense needs to make fewer mistakes and the defense needs to be more disciplined in coverage overall im pretty optimistic though
i hate mark madden with a passion but hes right

we were 1 play away from blowing it against jeff driskel and a team that looked like they just landed on normandy beach

7 first downs at 3rd down from penalties blame the refs all you want unacceptable

they need to tighten this shit up or a real contending team is going to come in and dad dick the fuck out of the steelers
tj bud cam tyson and tuitt are gonna be all over watson their offensive line has been terrible for years they are gonna come out fired up though and we need to be on point think our defensive game plan will be a little different probably wont commit as much to stopping the run
actually we dont i could definitely see us fucking around with a few turnovers and still pulling a win out of our ass
this would be a happier place if we banned posts about mm comments
lets agree to not give this dickhead any clicks fuck mark madden i agree we need to do better but i dont need to hear from him
can we ban mark madden madden is a twat
texans are trash
vegas ou on wins when the season opened

hou 75

den 75

nyg 65

its silly to call any regular season game exhibition to begin with but whatever category those first two games went in this one belongs the same place houstons a mediocre team thats underperforming relative to even that humble standard
i dont think mm has watched the texans this season yet

theyre not very good
oh dear heres madden reinforcing the average or belowaverage steelers fans misconceptions of reality again hes reinforcing the alltoocommon idea that players and teams are slaves to their ratings or records teams with certain numbers are guaranteed to be worse than teams with certain better numbers the teams with worse numbers dont put up much of a fight and are called exhibition games but teams with better numbers like the 02 texans apparently are the real challenges

this doesnt say anything insightful about football or the steelers but it does prepare some silly people to throw a tantrum if the steelers lose or tie or god forbid win by one score

looking at the top couple of comments in this post its already fooled a couple people but thats a choice they make and i think they can change their minds at the snap of a finger we all know that nothing is linear like madden suggests or the top couple of commenters seem to naively believe theres a reason why the term any given sunday exists this is the nfl there are no easy games i think at any point we can all accept the objective truth that an nfl team is an nfl team in the regular season and playoffs theres literally no such thing as an exhibition game there are already games called exhibition games and theyre played in the offseason not weeks 1 and 2 of the regular season seriously this is equivalent to the alabama could beat the browns logic if you think thats dumb then im glad that youre getting the point

its silly to say the offense made mistakes and defense needs to be more disciplined so madden is right that their imperfections mean future games are worrisome its silly to say madden is right we were one play away from losing to jeff driskel so that means a real contending team is going to come in and dad dick the fuck out of the steelers those arent insightful discussiongenerating thoughts about how the steelers can compete this year i dont think we have an excuse for denying the objective reality that not every little detail will be repeated in future games and even if it is theres no a guarantee that a team with a higher madden or pff rating will be able to capitalize on those little details better than a past opponent did thats simply not how reality works and i dont understand how anyone capable of individual thought does not understand this i bet madden understands it hes just trolling and taking advantage of our village idiots
this dude muted me on twitter

that said i think he has a point here we didnt even come close to playing to our potential last week
i hate that lard lad and usually hes full of hot takes but he isnt wrong we squeaked out a win against a back up qb and a team losing their 1 wr it doesnt help to get a sack on 2nd down only to give up a 315 constantly offense needs to gel and set up clock eating drives they havent done that yet
fire mark madden
mark madden is a dumbass one fucking mistake made the broncos game close bennys fumble if benny doesnt fumble pittsburgh easily gets at least 3 points and takes enough time off the clock in the process to effectively seal the game

the texans are probably better than their 02 record suggests but certainly not that much better their offensive line is awful and their receivers cant create separation pittsburgh could potentially have 10 or more sacks as a team that game if they play as well as they have been the last two games minus the turnovers week 3 could be a very satisfying and dominant victory
texans game feels like a loss to me at this point maybe i will feel differently as the game gets closer
arent the texans 02

the anxious buildup then they start winning and your okay then the defense does nothing for about half a quarter and your nervous again then they win it on a ride or die play
for me its chest pain
with the refs that always officiate the games
went to high school with a current nfl player and a couple years back i ran into him while he was in town and we were talking about the season and he remembers that im a steelers fan and he tells me that theyre one of the teams he really doesnt want to play i think this was in 2017 and i just remember laughing when he said that because yeah at the time i think we were 112 and on paper looked unstoppable but they made every game so stressful and close for no reason but at the same time hes actually in the nfl and knows more than i ever will one of those moments i love thinking back on
thats me but instead of pills its cheap vodka that closely resembles turpentine
i usually take a few hits from the bong calms me down last thing i want is for my voice to be gone in the 2nd quarter lol
now that im into mid life i have to take blood thinners before every game to fend of the impending myocardial infarction

x200b

seek the way the truth and the life
dont you get it they do it to keep us on the edge they know theyll win but they want to give us a show
wait is that another screen pass
saturday and sunday being a nebraska and steeler fan

love seeing this
with this and his play last game i am loving me some dotson
okay but is he eligible
i feel like a bad fan all of the sudden but what am i missing did zach used to do this
sneaky sneaky
if you watch enough loops you might cry a little just sayin
baby hulk in the house
dotson is such a gem
as the title suggests i think this shift to the teen numbers from the 80s and the fact that we have one of the youngest receiving core possibly the youngest we should call them the teen titans
juju can be robin the leader
diontae can be beast boy the one that can do everything
washington can be cyborg the trucker of defenders
claypool can be superboy because he is an alien


ill try to photoshop something this weekend
claypool can be superboy because he is an alien

lmao
i hate to tell you this but titans is already taken
its so cringy but i fucking love it sign me up for the tshirt
no
try doing it after the texans game
id like that nickname a lot better if tennessee were still the oilers
im not a little kid anymore and i hear that they ruined that show anyway sooooo no thanks
its the first quarter of the big game and you wanna toss up a hail mary id like to be pimps from oakland or cowboys from arizona but its not halloween grow up peter pan count chocula look weve been to a million weddings and you know what weve rocked them all
i dont like it i love it
i love it
removed
removed

i literally cant comprehend how people can get this worked up over reddit comments and downvotes lol
they probably based the post off this article



which omits claypool probably because hes only played 48 snaps idk why else the article wouldnt mention him hes the highest graded wr in the nfl as of now with a very limited sample size
its 3 maybe 4 or 5 on his own team i dont get it
you dont understand the grading thats okay

they watch every play from every player through all22 film the give each play a 2 2 rating in 05 increments for instance his td was probably worth a 2but thats only one play each play is graded so if he misses a block hes getting a negative grade no matter how it affects the player i know of negative grades given to players not in the right positions at the right times in regards to the play call

the raw score is then added up and normalized on a scale of 0100

its not perfect of course it isnt its just one extremely knowledgeable groups ranking system it is one of the most thorough systematic player ranking systems out there but being thorough and systematic doesnt mean theyre right its all subjective look at it as a small piece of a large puzzle not the whole puzzle

edit so apparently theres things missing from the photo on my screen or something because all i see is op confused about how chase got a 70 week 2 and a 90 week 1


this is whats visible on my screen

i dont get this tbh claypool had the highest grade of any rookie last week right he caught every target and was a beast on special teams and had an amazing td this weekhe has to he number one right for context they had him at a 90 grade in week 1 theres literally no way he got a 70 grade in week 2 so these rankings must have a certain snap count or something associated with them claypool is certainly above anyone on this list im not saying hes the roy but based on their numbers thats how is

this was their most recent instagram post

well it was obvious that he wouldnt be able to cover an outside route based on how he was aligned so he was expecting safety help

i dont understand the big surprise part though edmunds is usually in the right position
eh it happens this was a difficult coverage assignment and the broncos called the perfect play against it thats a touchdown regardless

you guys are really unable to understand that edmunds takes the brunt of the blame because we have such a good defense that when mistakes happen it has to be someones fault

there were plenty of coverages blown by haden and minkah sunday funny you guys only like to highlight edmunds though
he came in clutch when we needed him with that sack though sometimes you just gotta take that w and move on
42 overall grade on pff so far this year

if he didnt play on one of the best defenses in the league he would be even more exposed hes lucky to be a starter
not to mention that fant was really the only playmaker the broncos had with sutton out by that point yea blown coverages happen but edmunds just doesnt seem to be able to pick up on whats happening and make the right play consistently

really love what i see from 90 week in and out just gets better every game and continues to prove to the league hes big dog
not an edge rusher in the league i would rather have right now dude is a superstar he will be worth the money
i bet i wont see many steelers fans complaining about pff in this thread
i still remember people were calling him a bust early his first year because he wasnt putting up huge sack numbers lmfao
94 is what his madden rating should be
vincemcmahongif
we need to keep him and bud together next season
man got robbed of dpoy last year
not surprising
and yet hes probably still not in the top 10 edge rushers on madden


he said all the right things in his interview hard nosed and confident but not cocky at all pretty sure colbert found a gem
it makes ben sounds so old he made me laugh
dont get me wrong im excited about highsmith and mapletron i think theyre going to be high floor producers

but i said this from the start dotson is the guy i was most excited about the guy is a fucking mauler and has a chip on his shoulder that reminds me of cam heyward im excited for this guy
im 23 i had dreams that i would catch a pass from big ben one day in the league i mean i witnessed favre play till he was like 40 something but it doesnt help that im also a short white dude with minimal athletic talent
hard not to root for this kid
i really hope dotson has a long career making our oline stronger
and hes number 69


hehe
dont puck up then kdot we have a hell of a defense again this year and i wanna see another steelers sb win before my dad dies sooner rather than later fellas

i didnt realize how open he was i thought ben threw a dime but this angle shows differently
i see your skills are improving
some arizona fan see his one foot wasnt down
actual photo
good to see rudolph is developing his skills while on the sidelines
can i get this as a phone background
this is perfect
potato quality

chase claypool is a stud and im so happy we have a randy moss type player
just picked him up in my fantasy league hoping his momentum keeps rising guy is a stud
this kid gon be gud

flashback to april who tf is this guy we just wasted a draft pick omg we needed a running back fire t0mlin

i may never understand the steelers draft picks or colberts reasoning but usually they work out in the long run remember how edmunds was a wasted pick last season or even pay off right away minkah claypool

i mean the ravens are arguably the best or second best team in the afc so im not too worried about not being the favorite in our division when the favorite in our division is the favorite in the afc

thanks you kevin dotson now lets see decastro pull off a 100 game

no offense intended decastro is a great ogbut maybe dotson is a freak at the position that no one expected

what are some other steelers news sites ive be on the btsc for a bit but looking for more input
i agree with all the minkah points
i am from michigan and i used to use nfl streams to watch the out of market steelers games most of the games are on cbs but i cant watch them because it shows the lionsbears majority of the time where do you guys go to stream the steelers games


please help

sportsurge
yahoo sports app on your phone im in texas and ive only been able to watch the games like this
if youre willing to pay nfl gamepass idk if they still dont let you watch in real time but to circumvent that use a vpn and get like the brazilian version

i love how dotson isnt quite sure what ben is gonna do but hes fully ready to ride into battle with him no matter what
if people werent convinced before our offense is going to be scary once the 4 preseason games are done
im amazed that someone saw that td and was able to remember a similar play from 10 years ago does this person have perfect recall or something
football on tv is as good a time as it can be without being there the coverage the camera angles spotters slomo instant replay its a damn close second to being there but this year nobodys there we all know that theyre playing in an empty building the cameras cant help but show this there arent fake heads in the stands so why are they throwing this lame roar of the crowd at us

overlaying the game with canned crowd noises im over it let me hear the game the players the coaches the refs all of it yes i know very well the problem theyd have with objectionable words possibly being broadcast football at every level from junior high school on up has plenty of swearing and let me tell you how creative some of these fuckers can get with their swearing and insults it aint just what they claim to have done to your mom but its how they claim they did it to her that would send network censors to the rabies clinic frothing at the mouth and barking

the games are already broadcastdelayed 10 seconds or longer for that reason and plenty of other reasons turn off the crowd track broadcast the game and be selective about where you put the microphones id much rather listen to the people on the field than some crappy recording they cant keep running and which never matches the action on the field theyre fooling nobody and it isnt enhancing my game experience

tldr shitcan the canned crowd noises
so there arent a lot of sound engineers who love football but i happen to be a sound mixer and while most of my work is in live performances i have done some broadcast sound

you want to know what would be way more distracting than the current canned crowd noise the whole field noise dropping out for completely random intervals at completely random times if im mixing and hear the word word that needs to be censored im going to have absolutely no way to know what microphone its coming from or if i happen to see it register on a meter whether or not that word is going to spill enough into other microphones to make it audible my only option with a 7second delay is to mute all of the live channels and at that rate iid rather have something to fill it in with like you guessed it canned crowd noise

could the canned noise be better absolutely there has been a lot of work done in engineering more believable audible reactions but the people developing generally arent on the teams of the big broadcast organizations theyre working on interactive theater pieces that are offoffoff broadway so while the tech is there the top broadcasters are just going to rely on what they know their people already do well

as with most things what you actually get your hands dirty things are more difficult than you might think
they will not do that due to the language you mentioned the crowd noise was never meant to actually simulate the game imo it was just a convenient excuse
ive heard that the guys who cut the micd up videos say the stuff they hear and cut would make the nfl lose fans lmao
been a long time since ive seen you post cynic glad your still active id love to hear to hear the audio on the field but you know dam teams would have a shit storm due to the fact of them being able to hear the play calls and audibles that would mean every team would have to change their terminology from week to week the quality of football would be drastically effected but im with you id love to hear some of their shit talking and who does their talking with their pads so to speak
i appreciate it to a small degree but i get what youre saying about hearing the rawness of the game i remember when nfl network first started doing live games they had very limited announcers and i loved it
not at all i really dont like the added in crowd noise either

were so used to crowd noise indicating things now its so random you instinctively think something goodbad happened when nothing happened at all especially when its delayed and youre looking for a flag or a fumble
i cant disagree but im just glad we have football have you thought about doing radio broadcast over tv i know people do that seems like too much work to me to sync up but crowd noise always seems less a focus in radio the absence of a crowd is just a big downer to the overall experience but to me its been less devastating in football than the nhl playoffs that shits just not the same i will say opening night even with the small crowd in kc sounded very natural to me hopefully we can all get there safely soon
at the end of the day they are selling a tv product and the consumers of that product are used to hearing crowd noise so they will continue to use it at least the fake crowd noise is relatively insync with the game
we listen on steelerscom and shut off the tv audio takes a few plays to sync up but its wayyy better we play it through a bluetooth speaker haha the monday night game tunch was a little inebriated it was pretty good
idk they have done a good job cheering and groaning at the right spots and theres stretches where i completely forget there isnt any fans bc the canned noise follows whats happening in the game
post the rants on your facebook page
doesnt bother me much im certainly not driven insane by it i wish it was natural too but shits fucked up right now id probably be more bothered by it feeling more like a practicescrimmage game that doesnt count an exhibition for a game show or something because it doesnt feel like every game ive seen on tv ever lack of crowd noise is kind of a deal breaker for me whereas its artificial presence is a deal breaker for you i get that its just different strokes for different folks

i know its not a popular take and ill be seen as somehow less of a fan or something but its an honest opinion
if im a curmudgeon so be it
the three times under tomlin we have played an 02 team

2017 lost 2317 against the bears in ot
2012 lost 3431 against the raiders
2011 won 2320 on a last second fg against a colts team that finished 214

the texans are talented and im sure highly motivated after starting with losses against the chiefs on opening night and the best team in football so far in the ravens im concerned no more dumb turnovers play clean and play smart
ugh that fucking bears game yikes i cringe every time i remember it
the texans arent bad tho just played the two best teams in the conference so hopefully the steelers wont have to play down to their level since they arent horrible
weve won some and lost some against teams with a small sample size of games in a given season huh
putting stock into the first 4 games of the season as if the bengals didnt have a 4 win season where they won their first 4
im a ravens fan pretty sure the texans arent going to give you a ton of trouble itll be a game jj will get a sack or two in the end tho i think the steelers will win this troubles me because were playing kc this weekend id really like it if the steelers lose but i dont think they will
the oline is going to be a tasty snack
our d is going to wreck their oline watson is very talented but by far the best way to mitigate that is get constant pressure on him im pretty 5050 on this game the texans are 02 but theyve played the 2 best teams in the league were 20 but weve played 2 of the worst teams in the league we can get the win but were going to have to step it up we let our foot off the gas against the broncos and almost blew it watson will be a much bigger threat if we give him the chance to be
i know the texans are 02 but they have played the ravens and chiefs before everybody gets their pitchforks ready to go in case of a loss you have to understand that at least 90 of the nfl would expect to be 02 having opened against those teams their record tells us next to nothing about the quality of the team right now
i feel like 02 teams are dangerous and i would prefer to never play them they arent yet convinced the season is lost but theyre desperate that said i feel like the steelers will beat houston however even if philly is somehow 04 when we play ill bet the house on a defeat you realize pittsburgh hasnt won in philly since the johnson administration like we were all chain smoking in the office mad men style laughing about landing on the moon one day when we last won there how crazy is that bill nelson was qb we won two games that year as successful as the steelers have been this blows my mind and makes it the most important game on the schedule this season
thx jinx
more confident at home that said the texans arent a bad team imo
that bears team beat every team in the afc north that year


is that raiders game the one where terelle pryor destroyed us
surprised this post hasnt been  lol

yeah this ones funny i chuckled
this is actually my wife beating me after being my tv following a run up the middle on 3rd and 14 haha
randy feverishly flips through a playbook with haleys name crossed off the front
wait what a draw play on 3rd and 14 is a good call at times

you cant count on getting the first down so unless the game is in a bad state its good to do screens and draw plays when the box is basically free so you can pick up 78 yards and have an off chance of getting a first down instead of risking a turnover or a sack on a more obvious passing down
its unfair said baker mayfield we just arent used to playing in stadiums that loud
they need to hire the eagles crowd noise guy who was playing boos for his own team
browns should also install fat inbred robots in the endzone seats to chuck batteries and water bottles
some of you guys are being too harsh on the browns of course they have crowd noise just from opposing fans

still not as bad as san diego going silent count in their own stadium tho
its gotta be hard regulating your performance when you dont have fans to get up and leave at the top of the 4th
of course they would
there is no crowd noise for the browns virtual or otherwise

hes almost doing the nike logo

as someone who lives in michigan i quite enjoy the lions being dogshit very entertaining
and the browns and lions havent even been to a super bowl
only pro team in ohio is ohio state
a combined total of 0 playoff wins since 2000
i dunno if that triangle is haunted or cursed or anything but its def pretty erie
i hope we can rescue tj hockenson before the lions ruin him or rescue jessie bates from the bungles
sometimes i forget the lions are a team at all
add a line over to chicago and call it a bermuda rectangle they havent been good in decades either
what do kentucky and ohio have in common neither has a professional football team
i am a lions fan and it hurts so bad watching my team just piss away talent every year never had a good coach or a competent front office thank god i have family from pittsburgh so they are my number 2 team
i just smh watching the lions waste the talents of calvin johnson when he was there and to a lesser extent mathew stafford but i wonder how much the contract they gave the both of them contributed to them not really having a sb caliber team

the browns are ran horribly and im not surprised they are stuck in purgatory sports in general is a top down kind of thing which leads me to my next point

the bengals might actually turn things not this year but they had talented teams in the past and due to ineptitude from players and coaches alike they never accomplished anything even though theyve had some good records a talented team wont always overcome coaching blunders and will never overcome a bad fo

but i still love watching the browns fuck up always a joy
i feel like these are the main teams despised by steeler nation which one do you hate the most

view poll
browns arent worth the time to hate
i picked ravens but im really starting to despise the browns they play dirty asf and were straight up headhunting against us youd also think that they were a respectable team for how much shit the fans talk also
i need more votes one is not enough
i chose the ravens the reason because they stole the brownsalbeit temporarily from the people of cleveland

i remember when that happened and i thoughtthat could be us it wasnt long after that when the steelers needed a new stadium and the city and state were not very receptive to the idea i remember being really concerned that i might soon be rooting for the l a steelers or something

thank god the rooney family has more morals and loyalty than the modell family did
by far the ravens indifference at best for the rest of them the tom bradyless patriots just arent the same
i still have a burning hatred for the bengals from a couple years ago lmao
who hates the packers

theyre a great team fan owned no cheerleaders
can i double vote the pats
patriots cause they cheated to win all 3 afc championship games
bengals those games always end up so rough and dirty
i dont necessarily hate the ravens i respect them they draft well and have been a worthy adversary for us i get the sense the feeling is mutual between the organizations

otoh the pats cheated us out of potentially 3 super bowl appearances they cant lose enough for my liking
i actually enjoy the rivalry with the ravens i see them as an equal contendercompetitor where real recognizes real i honestly think that if the ravens and steelers didnt have each other both teams would stagnate as each team is constantly nipping at the others heal vying for first place patriots on the other hand i loathe with a passion
i couldnt find roger goodell
hard to decide
grew up in a cowboys household has to be them bengals and browns arent worth the time ravens and patriots are a different kind of hate i just cant stand the cowboys
im surprised that tompa isnt an option here
im sure im in the minority here but i dont hate the ravens at all i love to hate them twice a year and thats about it theyre a solid respectable franchise that has given us some of the greatest moments in steelers football history

i feel bad for the ohio teams and feel nothing for the nfc teams that leaves one option
hated the ravens more when they had flacco for some reason
not sure i despite any teams honestly i dont get that excited for playing divisional rivals browns suck too much and ravens just dont excite me

i wouldnt say i hate these teams but i would get excited to play them cowboys and patriots something about the playing the cowboys seems to have great history two franchises with a long history
ive never really hated another nfl team because theres no team that we have to look up to there are teams who are better than us in any given season but our history and legacy speaks for itself the only competitor in terms of overall success cheated their way there so i dont spend much time even thinking about them
why isnt this multiple choice
i live in ctits the patriots by a mile
i picked the patriots due the fact i feel they are consistently finding ways to cheat and ruin the league with it

next would be the browns this is mostly because of the fans i live near but recently the amount of people that celebrated a player using a helmet as a weapon was sickening i understand tempers get heated with pushing matches or punches thrown this was a player trying severely injure his opponent all respect lost for that


although i hate the ravens its a respected rivalry though where i hate them because its a division opponent that gives us the most the most trouble people like ed reed ray lewis and terrell suggs
i hated but would have easily welcomed to our team with no hard feelings like haden
surprised people are picking the ravens over the browns i actually like the ravens these days
the browns bengals and ravens are all the same team we have utterly decimated for decades of domination so i choose to hate the chiefs bc they are the current top dog in the pound

theyve carried it 11 times for 88 yards an eight yard average highlighted by james conners career long 59 yard rush against the denver broncos sunday

this isnt the endorsement they think it is

10 carries for 29 yards prior to the long one 29 ypc
these are the types of articles i hate from steelersdepot the entire press conference is like why arent you using ebron wait and see is this the workload benny snell can expect wait and see why arent you using watt wait and see and boom steelersdepot has 3 new articles based on 30 seconds of tomlins coach speak just watch the pressers these feel like clickbait
i mean hes dominating on defense let the dude rest
i kind of figured this would happen as long as ben is the qb i highly doubt they will use a fb in a traditional sense i like the pre snap motion theyve added so its not all bad
i dont know why people are complaining about this were 20 our qb just came back from possible career ending surgery and he looks great and people want to complain about a fucking fullback not getting enough carries
there is no explanation in this article for the lack of usage lol
the fullback hasnt really been a significant offensive piece since the early 2000s not sure why football fans have a hard time seeing this
and things of that natureofc
hes been really visible on special teams dont see much impact beyond that i think he has a place as a package player for very specific situations on offense not sure i want him out there 10 snaps a game
bring back the fullback god damn it

could have just as easily been mike hilton but hes not as big of a name still great stuff tj
is it nuts to say he did all this quietly like hes just out there working and hes better than everyone they put in front of him
houstons oline is paper thin him and bud are gonna feast this weekend
best edge in the league period

i dont want to hear about khalil mack anymore i dont want to hear about von miller i dont want to hear about myles garret no one as of right now is matching the production of tj watt these past 2 years
dpoy on that ass
teej is playing like a man possessed out there
its crazy that a lot of his work doesnt even show up on the stat sheet sure he got two sacks but thats not even mentioning him forcing driskel to step up right into alualus waiting arms
drafting tj watt in 2017 at the 30th pick is starting to take on the status of members of the original steel curtain mean joe greene mel blount jack lambert jack ham lc greenwood andy russell donnie shell

tj watt is heading for that list hes only 25 years old but he is an amazing player
85 in madden unbelievable
was bud not dpotw week 1
steelers need to start using the tagline tune in for watt when advertising upcoming games and highlighting the defensive monster that is tj motherfucking watt

then they show highlights of derek
i did the math tjs career sacks average out to three every four games on average theres only a 25 chance hes held without a sack any given sunday
they probably shouldve extended him when they couldve done it for 20m a year the way hes trending hes gonna be a 30m per year player
why didnt they put the interception in there
was a bad call from getting diontae as special teams player of the week too
currently the best watt in the nfl prove me wrong
pats fan living in western pa coming in peace
damn you guys are lucky to have tj such a joy to watch cherish him while hes here
best defensive player in the game imo
tj watt was the first time the steelers ever drafted the guy i really wanted and i havent been disappointed yet hes the heart of that defense and no doubt will be made the richest lb and a steeler for life
get used to this hes just getting started

i have a theory on this after the broncos game i think i would have described the defense as pretty good but not stellar through two games with that being said every stat that i look at include dvoa which takes into account the opponents shows that theyre a monster unit theyre number 2 against the pass and number 1 against the rush in dvoa theyre dominant rushing the passer theyre dominant against the run etc

i think the steelers defense was fantastic last year but i allowed the memories of how great the defense was last year especially compared to the offense to create unrealistic expectations for what the steelers defense should look like they really have been dominant and i think this unrealistically high standard in my head has just made it harder for me to see that
sadly gone are the days of sub 14 ppg with 24 shutouts over 16 games too much leaguewide preference for more offense

i would love to see that again how dominant that would be in this era of offense
really its just been the penalties in the first two games not only have the penalties resulted in first downs but often times theyre on 3rd down sometimes 3rd and long so many of these penalties were also reallyyyyy ticky tacky so i dont expect it to continue

cut out the penalties on third down and the opposing offenses yardage totals will drop as well be getting off the field far quicker
im guessing part of why theyre blitzing so much is they just played two young qbs on a short preseason and with as much as theyre getting home theyre content to let the secondary tackle the catch counting on splash plays due to pressure
but they arent blowing teams out so i am worried about them going forward
i hope anyone who says this defense isnt good enough to win a super bowl takes a sack and fumbles in their own territory
we have to keep in mind we were playing the giants and then the broncos who lost their starting qb after already being devastated by injuries
please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this weeks opponent including weaknesses strengths or info on lesser known players you think will have an impact if you are a fan of the texans feel free to add in your two cents and ask us about the steelers
i dont know why but i feel like the steelers have great fans i could be biased as a houston fan that lives near baltimore but they always seem pleasant in comparison to what i see around here

also love pittsburgh what a great city
feels to me like this is a game the steelers show up for not sure about the stats behind it but i feel like we play good and win against mediocre average teams and dont show up at all for terrible ones texans are what i would define as an average team and for some reason im feeling the steelers can see through their 02 record and play a sound game im still waiting on that game that shows me this offense is super bowl caliper

also i like how our schedule played out feel like we are slowing ramping up our opponents with giants broncos texans and then titans next week for a big test
02 cant be overlooked as a win their record isnt indicative of their ability the texans are dangerous they got playmakers on both sides of the ball and are hungry for their first win this is going to be a great test on both sides of the ball on our communication execution and ball handling all of those have been outlined as our major issues i expect some of those issues to continue to surface at some point throughout the game hopefully we can keep watson and company contained and jj away from 7
nothing to ask but i love diontae hes my favorite receiver ive been high on him knew he was gonna be nasty
this game has me nervous very nervous texans are 02 and in pure desperation mode right now 03 is a death wish i can see houston winning this game
i dont expect us to blitz a lot this week texans o line is weak enough and deshaun watson is not daniel jones or drew lock i think that also means our secondary will be play much better hopefully minkah bounces back and returns to mid season form last year
watson is going to have to have a nearly flawless game for the texans to win their oline will struggle with pressure against that big nasty d

steelers offense should post around 30pts with their suspect secondary and run stopping ability
gonna be honest my gut is telling me this is going to be close but with the titans next week we really can not afford to lose this one because if we do theres a solid chance we are staring at 22 tied with the browns not to mention what may be an undefeated ravens team that is not likely to give us much wiggle room to get back to the top
this is gonna be the week i think big ben airs it out quite a bit texans secondary is definitely a weakness for them and making them respect big bens arm will open things up immensely for conner and snell in the backfield

defensively im expecting us to again go after watson with everything theyve got though i dont anticipate well commit so heavily to stopping the run this week that we give up major plays through the air watson is someone who can push the ball downfield through the air and take advantage of openings if we keep presenting them in order to stop the run

its gonna be a big day for our secondary and im anticipating a bit of a shoot out late in the game whoever scores first is likely gonna control the game but i think were the more complete team to win the full thing

next week is the trap game for us when we go visit king henry
gut tells me the steelers lose this week but on paper they should dominate

hey guys texans fan here honestly excited for the game we need this win the schedule makers did us no favors with these first three games but nevertheless im ready for sunday

i wanted to ask who are some unknown guys to look out for on sunday your defense as whole makes me nervous because pressure still is an issue at times looking forward to a fun discussion
notes on texans

corners are shaky we have a bunch of cb2 level guys and no cb1 level guy right now gareon conley is missed i feel like lonnie johnson jr should be a bad matchup for juju on paper but hes been inconsistent
justin reid is a future allpro he was a stud against the ravens expect to see him make an impact
our ilbs are under performing usually very good against the run and have been bleh at best so far poor tackling in the first game poor decision making in the second theyre about average in coverage dont think theyll be a point of exploitation in the receiving game
our edge lbs have been bad occasionally jacob martin makes a good play but otherwise just bad might be able to exploit backup tackles but i think yours are healthy
idl has been suprisingly good we have a solid rotation of guys who are doing work on the interior but our nose tackle play is below average which is hurting us
offense should be better than it is ol should be better than it is fuller and cooks need to both be healthy for us to see how good we are
each week of this season i am making a popular meal from the city of the texans opponent that particular week bbq for the chiefs crab cakes for the ravens etc for the steelers i am planning to try and make a home made primanti bros sandwich ive never had it but it looks delicious any suggestions how would yall recommend i prepare the meat is it like a flank steak
i am thinking we win this but its not going to be the pretty glad its at home because i dont want to play on turf after all the injuries last week i think the texans are a better team than the broncos theyve played two really good teams so far so i dont like having them come in here to fight for their first win they looked decent the first few drives against the ravens they just completely let the game slip away from them after a bad 4th down call and then a fumble returned for a touchdown on the plus side if we win theres a chance we can lead the division this week and maybe hold it until week 7
i really hope we win the browns play the football team and id hate to be tied at 21
coaches didnt want to say david decastro was practicing until juju told the media great to see decastro practicing today
texans fan please kill us i would rather go 412 and bob get fired than going 97 and squeezing into a playoff spot
watson is going to be running for dear life bud is coming tj too dont forget heyward and alualu highsmith and hilton blitzing like a maniac and please watch out for the man thats playing like he is sick in the head vince williams

offense has to come to play and protect the football we keep our d fresh and keep a sound offense this team is hard to beat
i think fans on both sides are going to be surprised by the game they see definitely see the steelers with the advantage in a few areas but the texans can be explosive i expect this game to be uncomfortably tight coming down to turnovers and penalties
blitzing watson is going to be excellent practice for lamar later on
steelers 24

texans 21
texans fan here picture post ravens

dline improving pj hall has helped solidify the interior which has allowed jj to move out jj and martin have both been showing ability to apply pressure which has been important as mercilus seems to have fallen off a cliff having got his bag at the end of last year quelle surprise important as

secondary oh boy a combination of a new scheme and a loss of our second best cb conley has seen us badly exposed bradley roby cb1 and justin reid at safety are legit but our other cbs hargreaves and lonnie johnson and eric murray have been struggling

oline were going to live or die by whether this unit plays up to its talent level we saw last year that this unit was improving but it seems to have gone fully into reverse this year in particular max scharping who was a 2nd round pick last year at lg seems to have gone from solid to crumpling like a folding table when the bills mafia are around if the unit clicks then weve got a good chance as 6040 underdogs if we see more of the same from the first two weeks well be going down by at least two scores with watson running for his life

tes fells remains good in short yardage but horrible at blocking which with the state of our oline after two weeks is not good hopefully akins gets more snaps as hes looked better all around

rbs if our line can get its shit together weve seen flashes of the old david johnson in week 1 particularly helped by having duke johnson to show some tricky looks on the offence

wrs showed flashes in both the first and second week with an enormous amount of speed meaning if watson can get time in the pocket theres potential for some bombs fuller looked good in week 1 but vanished last week as his glass hamstring struck again weve seen cooks and cobb improve with gametime unsurprising as new additions hopefully coutee has now been banished for good

summary i think well live or die by our oline this week we know your defence is legit and if our oline cant manage to put in even an average performance then this will be ugly our 3rd down completion rate against the ravens testifies to this if the oline plays to something resembling the cash and draft capital put into it then this will be a competative game our defence is improving week on week against our new dc weaver important as i think well struggle to match you guys if it turns into a shootout just because of how weak our offence has looked up front

heart texans 20 steelers 17
head steelers 27 texans 13 based on how good your d is and how shite our oline has looked

i knew we were missing someone cant believe ramon castro retired so young
i hope that david defoster guy on the oline comes back next week
i dont know if it will matter too much since it will let us sign bud watt next year
what moron wrote that
david foster still around
ah yes ramon castro happened when the steelers unwittingly performed a dragonball z fusion dance after a juju touchdown and david decastro and ramon foster combined pretty crazy to see someone play both left and right tackle at the same time
maurkice villaneueva should fill in just fine
this analysis made me laugh what does zach banner have to do with ramon castro and where did david defoster go get juju roethlisberger here
this reminds me of when we had ab and martavis and the antonio bryant mistakes we all made at least once in the heat of excitement
so this is something i gotta say about these websites one of my best friends who writes about the pga was picked to be their expert dude rarely plays and couldnt break 120 on the local muni but you read enough espn and social media and people are betting on what you write dont put money on something you dont understand yourself
ramon castro i hardly knew yasniff
oh well we still got chuks banner
are we also going to just ignore that dotson and banner didnt play the same position
rip to the legend jerry porter
what in the actual heck is a ramon castro

i dont care who the browns have on their roster they will forever and always be a big pile of dookie which is probably how they got odell to play for them
thats beautiful man good for big joe
orange team bad
extreme waste of talent by the browns
honestly thats a better win average for the browns than i what i was giving them in my head

the bermuda triangle of professional football is real folks

x200b

seek the way the truth and the life
joe haden is my dad
this might be an applestooranges thingbut i always thought that they have wasted so many 1st round picks on qbs because theyve improperly groomed them im left wondering what couldve been had those qbs been in a decent organization would they still have been a bust
if we expand that to all of the brownies pedigree picks then imagine the career that haden wouldve had if he were in a more supportive organization he has always been regarded as one the best cbs of this generation guy deserves a ring and i hope he gets one
cant believe this is what im going to be jerking off to tonight
and ben roethlisberger is the qb who has won the most games in cleveland since their return to the nfl
browns fan here joe haden is easily one of my favorite players if not my favorite he is the only player i have ever gotten a jersey for when i heard he was going to the steelers a few years ago i was bittersweet i was devastated at the fact that he was going to you guys out of all of the teams in the nfl but at the same time i was happy for the man he deserves to play for a team that he actually has a chance at winning a championship with thank you guys for treating him well
im a bot bleep bloop someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit

rbrowns joe thomas has won as many games with the steelers as with the browns

so a player on good team wins more games than said player on a bad team hold on i need a minute to digest this
lol
thats because the browns are racebaiting trash

i know he hasnt been a big name for the team but hes been around for so long at this point its weird to see him go i hope hes offered a roster spot elsewhere but i couldnt guess who would
lol love how were giving him a sendoff like hes finally leaving the nest
i hope he does well there big dan is going to be so tempted by all the great food in chicago to not be in great shape next year
good for him
hope he does well over there
6 years with us as a late round pick was a decent rotational guy which is all you can ask of for a late rounder best of luck to him

pro bowl voting already
i get the sentiment but i basically see this on every website especially annoying when its an ad and im already registered
we voting for the steelers to beat the texans
thanks but what does this have to do with the steelers
please dont interrupt my bread and circuses subreddit with this bullshit
yeah i agree with this sentiment but honestly why are you posting this in this sub has literally nothing to do with the steelers lots of people in this sub arent even american
whats this have to do with football or the steelers
so important this year thank you

i love this man somehow someway i want to be able to sign hilton again but im afraid hes just gonna keep pricing himself out of our range
hes awesome i dont know when his contract is up but i can see him being a sad loss
one his best games yet his only real slip up was the roughing the passer penalty on a 3rd and 10 blatantly went up high when he could have just bailed out otherwise he had a great game and love his fire
i honestly dont know of another slot corner that plays with the skillset that hilton has and it fits so amazingly with what the steelers do defensively obviously hes one of the handful of guys who will be looking for a payday this offseason and he certainly doesnt take precedent over watt or minkah but at this point i think hes so valuable to this defense and such a perfect fit that he has to be resigned id sacrifice every offensive fa except juju in order to keep hilton flying around in black and gold

very nice
awesome where did you get these

probably to replace cullers on ps dont know who the dude is
69 and 311 lbs lets give this guy a chance
he was an udfa for us and a final roster cut i want him just for the intangibles

we lift weights
the best part was him talking to ben about the dj td pass that he thought ben was going to run i was thinking about it but it was so far away
joe haden is hilarious
what a goofball i love him
oh man i love joe h seeing him so happy winning as a steeler brings joy its hard to remember he was a sad brownie all those years im really glad we have him
bens passes look on the money but some wombley messes at the same time dude keeps throwing off his back foot
why was this so funny

i will never not upvote spongebob
dont forget the bubble screen that leads to a loss of yards
yeah this is the most accurate thing ive ever seen if we run out of the shotgun on first down theyll never see it coming
ill have a ben call the plays in the no huddle make it a double please
bringing back the late 90s early 00s steeler playbook run run pass punt maybe see if kordel is available too lol
dont forget the screen pass for 2 yds on 3rd and 12
i feel like play selection has been way better this season
really though 1st down plays against denver

ben fumbles loses 8 follow up with a run
pass to ebron
pass to juju
incomplete to dj
incomplete to ebron followed by incomplete to dj
somehow inexplicably make it to the 2 where a 1stdown run is finally called
shotgun handoff to snell
pass to washington
pass to dj
run balled back for holding
1st 16 pass to dj
3 straight incompletions to punt
84yard td
shotgun handoff to conner
pass to conner

you get the picture
i think one thing thats going to help the offense out the most is the addition of more presnap motions this should help identify coverages and etc
except bens calling for pass about 60 percent of the time
what about the toss play out of shotgun

playing the long game do this then when they wise up and stop us we switch it up wait they arent shutting us down i guess just keep doing this then
i am so ok with this
good ol randy fishner
ten yards is ten yards
i have to say i liked the idea of the jet sweep on the first play maybe just dont drop the hand off next time
look at least we havent pitched the ball 6 yards deep on a 4th and 1 so still better than haley
what is it about the name randy that just makes me hate someone

god damn it randy
to be fair i thought the first half of the broncos game was called pretty good
how about a draw play on 3rd and long super original there
im tired of fitchner he is doo doo and needs to go man we can the same 5 plays every game and act like were not being predictable
so we ran on first down three times last game minus the awful dj endaround
its haley all over again
i for one miss todd haley

this dude was a g when i was a kid i was a military brat during the 90s and it was great bc i could trade all my football cards of other teams for steelers cards we had denver greenbay and eagles kids on my block brings back so many memories of 69 year old me i remember watching him lay people out and than trying to reenact the plays on madden so glad to see our dfence dominating once again the tripple b thing was cool and all but i will take a good d over a good offence any day
hope im not breaking the rules by posting this video hope you guys enjoy it god bless

mike hiltons current contract is for 329 million this year and will be a ufa next year
i remember my dad saying during the last game hilton gets the game ball

dude was everywhere
ugh im gonna miss him
a lot of games hilton hides in the best way

but when he shows up he lights up the highlight film
he deserves more recognition but we need less articles like this until we can resign him then lets shower him with recognition
does anyone think he could realistically be a starting outside corner
our defensive coordinator seems to like using him we may reach to keep him how many sacks we have against the broncos 3
im guessing well be capped if we try to sign a longterm deal
a lot of people talk about his surprise blitzing off the edge that works remarkably well or his coverage in the slot that also deserves praisebut one thing that goes unsung about him is his tackling for a small guythis dude is a pit bull he is not afraid to try and take on any offensive player whether its a lineman or skill player he always wants to make a play and has the heart of what it takes to be a stand out defender on a team with so much raw talent and ability
i love the respect we give this man because he deserves every bit of it
yes he does

i hope the offense plays less conservative and ben feasts on sunday
frankly i dont care about his sexuality good for him for coming out next week nice that he can finally be comfortable just being himself i just wanna see him catch the ball and score
as much as i would love to see them stretch and test the texans defense i think theyll be too afraid of watson to try to open up id expect them to try to get the run game going work the short and intermediate passing game and try to maintain control of the game i think it will probably work but i think its going to drive me insane
i think last week was his coming out part im hoping we can maintain a lead this week and not need him anyways tomlin doesnt like overexposing rookies if he doesnt have to and hes one of those people where i wouldnt mind there not being much film on him when we do need him im thinking it will be a good week for juju and dj though
i think claypool has as high an upside as anyone but lets be real wrs have a very complex job and playing at the highest level has more to do with experience than physical prowess he wont have one coming out game more likely than not but will gradually progress throughout the year as he learns the playbook

hell make great gains next year i think with a full off season under his belt thats when well really see
hes already a real weapon mostly because we have enough really good targets that no team can afford to dedicate a schemed coverage to a nine route by a rookie 4 wideout that and we have a guy who can push the ball downfield to him to exploit mismatches

but to have a real debut hell have to wait on injury or future season its just not feasible that hes going to see any real kind of target volume till hes higher on the pecking order

but i enjoy the idea of his having a year like martaviss rookie session where he doesnt touch the ball all that often but every time he does its in a situation where hes an immediate threat to take it to the house

overunder on broadcast mentions id put it at 45
i just read an article that said 1930 but i remember hearing 1927 from the edmunds game last year i wonder which is correct
did the nessers never play in the same game or was that before 1927
so wouldnt this be the third time then since it was the watt edmunds and rooney

and as always dont be a damn jagoff
chase claypool is going to be a league wide name by end of next season and on the level of some of the top receivers in the game

derek tj and jj
warm take 1a

in 2018 the steelers had an insanely talented offense with a ton of continuity everywhere they were 6th in dvoa 4th in yards 6th in points and 1st in red zone percentage offensively

in 2019 they had the worst qb play in years they stunk

in 2020 they have a qb a year removed from playing football with no preseason and short training camp throwing to basically one receiver that he has any sort of a rapport with and behind an offensive line that has sustained multiple injuries theyre 14th in dvoa 14th in points although one additional touchdown puts them 6th 14th in yards and 20th in the red zone

the steelers are playing an ultra conservative game plan to let roethlisberger ease into things theyre getting the ball out fourth fastest in the league theyre throwing the sixth shortest in terms of intended air yards and theyre still managing to pull off an above average offense people need to be patient with the offense and layoff fichtner a bit hes the same guy that put together that 2018 offense after all

warm take 1b

everyone hates the wide receiver screens i hate them too everyone yells at fichtner for calling them the same way they yelled at haley for calling them and arians for calling them since theyve endured through three offensive coordinators maybe its actually roethlisberger who likes them
mike hilton will make it to the pro bowl this year
it doesnt matter who we hand the ball off to ben is killing the running game in favor of having us run a shitton of plays out of the shotgun i see us run so many running plays out of the shotgun which the steelers simply arent very good at run plays out of the shotgun and a lot of times it feels ben checks to that when he feels the pass play isnt there and just let connersnell get whatever they can

to be clear i dont even think this is even something randy is pushing i think its mostly bens idea that he wants to run the offense out of the shotgun or at least an agreement between the two

we went out and got derek watt this offseason but for what the 45 goal line plays we get per game our offense would probably benefit greatly from at least a bit more plays under center so that the oline can pull out for run plays that they are so good at doing and maybe we can throw some playaction in there

all in all though im not sure it even matters that much since ben has shown he can read blitzes and get the ball out very quickly to the open man its just disappointing that it seems like we are heading back to the offensive pattern of 2018 where we threw the ball a shitton and had one of the worst running attacks relative to the rest of the league
terrell edmunds

pretty solid
i just have a bad feeling about this texans games im guessing the steelers come out sloppy and either the offense turns it over or watson eats last 2 times the steelers faced a 02 team they lost those were the mike glennon bears and 2016 eagles not exactly world beaters and i think houston is much better than those two

randy fichtner shouldnt be oc

pittsburgh offensive struggle is rusty because we didnt have a preseason we will look like one of the best offenses in the league by the end of the season

we beat the texans 287
stephon tuitt and vince williams are our best run defenders and it aint even close
two words trap game
we will go undefeated
very hot take i have us starting out the season 70 heres why if we beat the browns will start warming up combine that with a win against the titans and were on fire next will have a game against the ravens this is when things get crazy my prediction is a mink an fitzpatrick interception to seal the game after this we will be basically unstoppable only losing to the bills 151 going into the playoffs as i said scolding hot take
the single greatest cause of contention and disagreement among fans of the same team is the fans who pay little to no attention to the topic but think they do so they have a very cartoonish view of the real world that they dogmatically stand by the view seems to be that players with certain ratings and reputations are always perfect and the only component of a team responsible for success everyone else is a replaceable scrub or a coach who is just a figurehead along for the ride on the back of those talented players most of the contention and disagreement is normal people attempting to inform those other people how the real world actually works that no human is perfect and its possible for a normally great player to have a bad game or play and viceversa but its not anything nuanced about football or the steelers specifically
speaking of not anything nuanced about football or the steelers specifically if i were a gambler id probably bet on the texans on sunday i hope im wrong even if im not the preemptive response is no a loss to the 02 texans wont mean that tomlin fichtner terrell edmunds or any other fanfavorite scapegoat should be kicked off the team or that theres any concern for their future status with the team
ill edit this comment to add more if and when i think of them
unpopular opinion since it wouldnt take much at all i think we should trade for rosenor at least try him out he shouldnt be worth more than a 4th
this week texans win in ot

this season ben gets hurt week 7 and we trade for carson wentz
dupree is a more talented player than tj despite tj being the much better player overall
hot takes you say

ok by the end of the season claypool will be 1 opposite him will be dj with juju working out of the slot

hotter take due to my first hot take the front office will prioritize trying to sign bud dupree over juju
we need to snag robert saleh the moment we can

when he lays down next to you
some penalties are worth taking
nuk was so pissed about that lol
bince one of the all time greats
i was at this game great times
this was amazing is there a clip of this anywhere
so cozy did d hop ever respond to this anywhere lmao
merry christmas indeed
god i love vince williams haha
oh vincenzo
spooning

hope he does well there hed give us about one or two good plays a year but never developed the nasty streak he needed to dominate consistently
dude is just big literally the reason he had a job i dont think i could fill one hand with the plays he has made in 6 years
had high hopes for big dan wish him well

was impressed with dotson for his first game albeit against a banged up broncos team but so excited to have decastro back such a vital piece to this offense and should help keep ben from getting too rustled
this is great news a huge part of this weird season with no camp or preseason is going to be which team can stay the healthiest having our full compliment oline is going to go a long way to keeping ben standing

i am mega hype for our revamped offense
bruh i thought this guy had a full on metal leg photoshopped in this
i hope they limit him or sit him for the game sunday id rather make sure hes 100 than get another injury and be out for the season one more week wouldnt hurt
anyone every notice decastro is always looking down in every clip of him pass protecting i have to think hes reading hipsfeet first
hey guys as someone who doesnt really watch steelers games im a pats fan pls dont ruin me i see that derek watt is getting tackles i tried to look it up but couldnt find answers does he play special teams

edit deleting this post when someone answers
you are correct he is on special teams he finished tied for first in the nfl for special teams tackles last year with 16
why delete the post someone else might ask the same question

and yeah hes a bit of a special teams ace
when needed he cut the grass and things of that nature
yes he was primarily signed as a special teams contributor the steelers dont make a whole lot of use of fullbacks on offense
no he just randomly tackles his own teams players every once in a while just to keep things interesting


he got off
money talks
happy ending for kraft
of course just like his team he will have that asterisk next to his name
i knew hed get a fair rub
dont you know rich old white men dont commit crimes in trumps america
this really rubs me the wrong way
relevance

ben usually never gives a fuck about his mechanics this is good
his arm looks fine strength is there and he has been mighty accurate he just needs to get back the groove of setting his feet

dude is usually rusty this time of year so if he looks as good as he does now im september the league is fucked when december ben arrives that throw on the run to dionte was a clear sign he very much still has it
fit ben is feeling light on his feet
yesss stop throwing them wobbly messes off your back foot arm strength is there accuracy is there just make em easier to catch by getting your feet set and throwing them dime spirals
this might be the best most invested version of ben that we have ever seen
removed


i assume he will be fine
wednesday doesnt count
claypool 3 td game incoming
even if juju doesnt play its ok the rest of the wr corps is strong and the texans secondary is trash
damn hope its nothing major if hes out im still more than comfortable rolling with dj washington and mapletron
forget claypool i want to see washington break more tackles more of anything from him in his third pro season well be fine without juju for a game
everyone told me yesterday it was no big deal because it was wednesday same thing for today
no time to practice but plenty of time to stream fortnite later like he did yesterday ill wager

theyve only run the ball 4 times all year on 3rd down theyve passed the ball 23 times on third down and their 43 success rate on those plays is good for 12th best in the league
the play calling be likejust fine

cant wait for the first ever watt bowl good luck hoping to see a great game
look at me tj is the daddy now
best of luck to yall but i would be lying if i said i dont wanna see derek pancake block jj on a run play lol
pittsburgh born houston raised

i will forever bleed for the steelers but jj is a texas treasure and i am so thrilled to see all three boys on the same field sunday
tpain better so the half time show
if we get three more watts we can complete the infinity gauntlet
this doesnt look like peace
nice fantasying but the reality is jj is old and tj is hitting his prime this meme should be jj gray and in a rocking chair with tj feeding him soft foods and wiping the smush off jjs face
the time when you had the best watt must seem like a distant memory



like are you people serious

what is with these posts the playbook has been pretty diverse since the 2nd quarter of game 1

both tes and all 4 wrs have multiple targets and catches

all 3 rbs have caught passes

diontae has run a reverse in both games hes caught screens bubble screens long slants juju the same claypool has run out routes and go routes washington has been used on the outside and over the middle with the tes

we had an amazing shovel pass to juju in game 1 the rub routes were also done very very well and gave us a couple big plays including a touchdown

we ran a lot of counters with snell weve done a lot of hb dives we did a few sweeps

can you guys not be sheep parrots and actually watch the games

lol you posted 2 of the same meme one after the other whats your issue with the play calling my issue is with poor blocking and ben throwing into the dirt on open receivers running backs missing their holes the play calling has not been a problem
i meanthe ben eat it or yeet it arm punt sometimes comes on first down or third down who knows
i can only name cowhers and it went like this run run pass and it was either 1st down or they punted after the pass
i think the play call has been pretty solid so far this year just a little rusty but should come together
last year wildcat
i mean ben is like huck it chuck it football

qb sneak
screen screen screen screen and oh yeah screen
spider y2k banana
run run run pass punt
play 1 toss sweep

play 2 screen

play 3 hb dive with wr in motion

play 4 shovel pass

play 5 oh shit we need a play that goes past 6 yardsuhhhverts
better than todd haleys screen every other play plan
im no genius

you could have stopped there

id say ben is definetly still shaking off rust from not playing for nearly a year and having an injured elbow play calling im sure is also a factor
hes got the 4th lowest time to throw in the league right now hes not holding onto the ball very long at all also hes on pace for 4320 yards and 40 tds so its not really like hes struggling here

its early in the season and theyre in the top half of the league in scoring with a qb that has no preseason and hadnt played in a year
you think the offense is struggling
you forget our line they have done better than i thought they might but some of them are getting older one retired there have been injuries and all kinds of other factors it takes time for a line to work as a group and when there are constant changes it makes a difference

heck all those changes are why i am surprised they have done as well as they have i was particularly impressed by dotsons performance last week
front seven with cam heyward bud dupree tj watt and devin bush secondary with fitzpatrick wr corps of mr big chest juju smith schuster chase claypool diontae johnson and james washington big ben at qb offfenisve line with alejandro villinueva david decastro and maurkice pouncey
we wouldnt have had devin bush without mbc leaving we might not have been able to get fitzpatrick

youre acting like we can always have it all when in fact our trading away mbc is what allowed the signings of some of these players

now we have all these players plus an amazing and young wr corp that is selfless and works together as a unit

we are better off without him in every way
hed take up a lot of cap space that were gonna need
id rather have diontae at 1 mil than mbc at 20 mil given the composition of the rest of the team
well if he never went crazy we wouldnt have bush dionte claypool and maybe minkah ben and juiu wouldnt have this chip on this shoulder
nowhere near where we are now

if you think we go wr hunting like we have if we still had him on the roster youre crazy we would have lost a few key players especially on the offensive and defensive lines hell were still hugely up against cap and arent sure if we can retain everything we currently have

theres no way we blow our 2nd round pick on claypool or anything like that hell we might not have been able to secure fitzpatrick via trade because when miami took that trade they were anticipating a top 10 if not top 5 pick because they team was struggling

with ab in the mix im not so sure we were able to trade up as easily because everyone would be waiting for that rudolph to ab connection

wed be in a completely different boat if that tool was still on the roster instead of sitting at home hoping someone will look past all his legal issues and suspensions to give him yet another shot after blowing it with not one not two but three teams in nearly as many months
it cant really be better than 20 right now i think we all need to appreciate what we have
in addition to everyone pointing out that we would be in cap hell we also would not have diontae johnson since we drafted him with a pick we got from the raiders in the mbc trade
its addition by subtraction
thats really not how it works

if the ab saga never went down then this team would be completely different on both sides of the ball you cant just take a past player and plug him into this lineup as if everything wouldve happened exactly the same
ill take this offense over the 20152018 offense hands down maybe not as explosive but still very powerful with a better overall collection of receivers imo and not even close to being as toxic and juvenile
the problem with big chest was always that he loved big chest and his stats and his stardom and his money more than the team and winning championships so no he had his opportunity to be this good and it didnt happen im glad we have moved past him and his shenanigans
were better without him i know that sounds stupid because hes ab but team chemistry exists were better when ben spreads the ball with lower volume and our receivers are good as it is
the team we have now wouldnt be the same even if we had a non crazy ab we wouldnt have the same players and i would still have traded ab in 2016 after the locker room incident for a kings ransom


imagine if you will
step 1
trade ab in 2016
get a first and second
draft tj watt still


step 2 then draft tredavious white boom defense gets a fucking enormous boost trade burns for a doughnut cut golson that day


for reference these were our corners in 2017

step 3
draft budda baker to replace mike mitchell cut robert golden never sign nat berhe the fuckin bum or the bum jj wilcox


that would mean our defense would have been
tj watt heyward tuitt dupree
shazierbush and vincefort
whitehaden cockrellgaysutton hilton
davis baker dangerfield allen
mr big chest is mr old chest now hed probably be good but not anything close to great if he didnt jack off on a nonconsenting womans back

wtf do people want were 20 with a qb who almost lost his career due to injury and people just want to complain about the tight ends and fullback not getting enough touches
i think when its all said and done youre not going to see anyone with real eye popping top of the nfl receiving stats from this team ben feeds a lot of the receivers didnt read the article
this is sillyenrons stats are going to be just soso because there arent enough catches to go around hell make some game changing plays this year in key moments
ebron projects for 500 and 30 catches right now i think thats all we can expect this year
if people were expecting travis kelce or george kittle they are going to be disappointed we never use our tight ends like that

even in heath millers prime he was always more of a blocking tight end

i dont like it but it is what it is
people need to chill we already know what vance is ebron may have a higher ceiling but its going to take time to get some chemistry with ben

and this wr core is loaded people are really whining about the fullback not being on the field when it means taking someone like claypool or washington off of it
vance mcdonald was worth whatever they paid him just for that stiff arm against tampa bay alone
writers in a panic with us being 20 reaching for stories
when the argument gets made that we could get an elite tight end for their price it misses the fact that a single tight end no matter how elite cant run multiple tight end sets or back himself up theres value in having multiple tight ends who are starter quality even if theyre below average starters
ridiculous
the tight ends will get theirs we have a lot of mouths to feed in this offense and only one ball we might not see huge numbers out of the tights ends but they will have their days
this article is nothing more than a rebranded reddit comment

first ebron was likely signed knowing vance is gone next year

second ebron wasnt signed with the expectation hed have 70 receptions and 1000 yds his value is in the red zone and the attention he draws which opens things up for other weapons

you cant measure his or any te not named kittle or kelce real world value by his fantasy stats its like trashing nick chubbs value to cle because they turn the keys over to hunt near the goal line
well with how little we seem to be using vance he is a bit of a waste but both cannot be a waste blocking and just being in for formations and eating up some coverage as even a distraction is always valid
most of these value based articles completely ignore the fact that one cant just go out into the market and pick up x player at y cost at will aka they complete ignore the effects of market scarcity i mean you cant just go out and pick up a kittle even if youre willing to spend because hes not a widget or fungible talent classic stat nerd mistake
rf doesnt know how to use half the players on offense
wait til we play the ravensjust sayin
poor article and looks like a shitty site please do not share more from there most team content sites are cobbled together by people who would contribute more to society if they stuck to flipping hamburgers and scrubbing crappers this is no exception

who are the 12 of neutral fans thinking the browns or bengals had a chance at the division title
god damn this is an ugly graph

i cant even tell what im looking at after reading an entire paragraph explaining it
here are the results to the 5th annual rnfl preseson prediction survey we had over 5000 respondents with fans from all 32 teamsover the years this has a track record of identifying improbable division winners before the season starts based on the homer index you can see each fan bases individual playoff picks here

in 2016 the cowboys had the highest homer index score 68 and the seahawks followed closely with a 65 index score as the rest of the league was on the giants and cardinals bandwagon

in 2017 the jags and rams both had 70 index scores and i called them dellusionali was left eating crow as they both won their division

last year the titans scored the highest homer index score ever of 80 and vikings came in second with 75 neither won their division but both won playoff games as underdogs

this year the colts 68 and bears 66 had the highest homer index score well see how the fair this year

division highlights


afce vast majority on the bills patriots to fans not so sure

afcn ravens have 2nd highest neutral pick at 88 steelers fans still confident

afcs a lot of optimism in division amungst fans titans with slight edge but no majority amongst of neutral fans colts have the largest homer index

afcw chiefs are nearly unanimous picks to repeat as division winners chargers set the record destroyed might be a better word for the dumbness metric with more than a 26 of them picking the chargers to win the super bowl while also not picking them to make the playoffs for context league average dumbness this was 2


nfce eagles and cowboy fans nealry equally confident but netral fans have a significant preferance for the cowboys

nfcn no neutral majority but clear two horse race packer fans noticably more confident than the vikings bears have 2nd largest homer index

nfcs saints fans arent scared of the new look bucs at all most confident fan base in league at 100 on winning division only the rams fans did that last year and we all saw how that turned out

nfcw neutral fans have a preferance for the 49ers but seahawks fans are nearly as confident
this great
yeah well thats just like your opinion man
the leauge doesnt support anything but wins and losses and occasionally tom brady

the posters here have confidence that legions of embittered fans of lesser franchises dont support largely because their garbage teams never amount to much of anything while we stockpile lombardis like toilet paper in a pandemic

our confidence is supported by 20 by the best defense in football by a fully armed and operational hof qb throwing to the best young wr corps in football and by year after year after year of our fans our coaches and our front office being correct in assessing that our chances are pretty fing good
lol the panthers fans were brutally honest with themselves
only 19 of neutral responders picked new england to win the afc east seems insanely low also 66 of lions fans expected to win their division

jj what are you doing

if we win 5 games thats more that 4
i dont concern myself with future games and things of that nature
one game at a time bud
all i know is a year ago my faith in the season was dead

lets worry about sunday before we worry about 40 and beating the titans

well yknow except for the guys we have on ir

so glad to have decastro back this week though
beyond stoked to have decastro back
bless the knees bless the knees bless the knees
this does put a smile on my face
you love to see it
good news everyone
yes this is a beautiful thing
so the opposite of the penguins season im for it
thank god hassenauer is fine

except zach banner

what kind of job im sure an accident could happen
yuck emoji
light it ablaze and just walk away if anyone asks the car asked you to get in a limo with it
i occasionally have to do work at clients in the baltimoremetro area you guys should see the crap down there i always pass by a guys house which is right next to the ravens training facility and has a gigantic bus painted with a ravens scheme
pray trust wait sounds like ratswings playbook

pray we dont fumble

trust lamar

wait to see how long he can run
bet you can store a stabbed dead body in there just in case ray calls you to hangout
they wanna be us so bad the sticker on the top left says pit
you should ask him where he got that decal on the back just got a jetta and thinking about putting the steelers logo on the back of the car

blitzburgh never left we have led the league in sacks 3 years running now we just have the rest of the pieces to help elevate the defense
every time our defense plays another team we need to play rains of castamere

edit im glad people got this reference
theyre not gonna blitz at that extreme of a pace for the entire season i would guess that as soon as defenses start to gameplan for it they start backing off and playing more coverage especially if teams max protect

it wouldnt shock me if they hardly blitz this week
unique challenge this week with an accurate mobile qb cant over blitz
looks promising but holding my breath until we take home some hardware
our defense needs to step the fuck actually communication is killing us

i like that the hypocycloids are smiling
this is the content that keeps me coming back
that guys hair piece looks like a steelers helmet
this is the content i subscribed for
wholesome energy radiates from this image
i have a bad feeling about this game the texans are 02 and theyre due a win i hope we get the w but im not holding my breath

that said go steelers
anyone from rtampabaylightning will tell you the powers of the ms paint is real
its the first game of the season ill be watching so im psyched i dont have directtv and there are no bars open so the only way i can watch is with my friends its their sons bday this sunday too so im going to their place for both things
which side of the helmet is the logo on
is that a smiley face wearing a steeler themed dildo on its head
that bulls nose is smiling
what up
the bull should be frowning

perhaps even crying after sunday
super wholesome thank you upandae
i showed my partner this and her response was thats so dumb and so cute
i love these wish you would have made one for week 1
30 seems like a very achievable goal ill take as many ws as possible early on


what a cutie he looks a lot like my sisters dog and we have no idea what kind of breed he might be

fuck the ravenclaws
this is kind of funny we fans find meaning in everything
i was so happy when i was sorted in to hufflepuff on pottermore that way i could buy colors that already matched 34 of my wardrobe
no no no the rule is and always fuck slytherins
color wise huffepuff but were the brave and mighty team always pumping out heroes so that makes us gryffindor
hufflepuff is the worst though

edit triggered hufflepuffers below
so i will be flying all day tomorrow and am unable to tape the game at my house because it isnt shown on my local stations does anyone know of a way to watch a game after the fact

here we go

ps praying for derek to get a nice block on jj at some point
someone just told me about the game pass free trial doesnt seem like a bad idea
i enjoy watching nfl game recaps on facebook they might have other sources but its a condensed version of the game with all the key plays
theyve been putting a lot of full games up on youtube a day or two after lately seems like theyve finally realized that keeping nfl content off youtube was only bad for their business now theyre giving it away so creators can make channels and its essentially free advertising

live is still paid for and gamepass gives you that sweet instant access and redzone thats the real drug the nfl wants to sell you that redzone crack that live injection
nflfullhdcom

sometimes takes a couple hours or so for the game to get uploaded but its a full replay without commercials and bullshit and usually pretty high quality

hahahaha you can totally tell this is such a homer article

the proposed trade is a 5th and a 6th for fucking bj finney who would transfer with a 2year 6mm deal if traded the author just living in fantasy land
id rather stick with dotson pretty sure dotson could learn center in the next couple months pouncey is not getting any younger finney had a strong first few seasons but he dropped off fairly noticeably his last 2 seasons with us
if this was made between week 1 and 2 id consider it with dotson being very unproven but even if it was just luck his first start was fucking perfect and decastro is most likely back two late picks for depth is not worth it

x200b

if they wanted to dump him for a 6th sure not sure id do it at this time for a 5th
no thanks im fine with kevin dotson also we dont have a 5th this year thats baltimore property
its not inconceivable that the steelers would trade for finney if they have significant injury problems along the offensive line as the trade deadline approaches but no way the steelers give up 2 draft picks for him the most they would offer is a 7th i would think not sure they could fit that much salary under their 2020 cap either which is why such a deal would have to happen very close to the trade deadline
the steelers didnt value him enough
they should have never let finney gofinney should have started at left guard in 2019 he should be there again this year feiler should have stayed at right tackle


whoever downvoted his is an idiot foster was terrible last year

james farrior greg lloyd troy polamalu mike wagner and dwight white
i cant believe it took so long for webster to get in
wonder if troy will come back for the ceremony hope he does but i can understand if he does not

did anyone else notice when hiltons penalty was according to the article
hiltons penalty was stupid on his part minkahs i felt was a little bit of a tacky call
rubbin is racing
steelers safety minkah fitzpatrick was also fined 11619

hes still a lot better than an 80 they should probably change tjs to like a 97 too
imagine spending an annual 60 on the same exact game from 2012 with worse mechanics thats ruled by micro transactions since ea doesnt give a fuck about making a good game
they just gave him a new 86 in mut
its still low
theres a reason madden is rated like 20 on metacritic
still one of the better way to learn popular nfl defensive schemes if you diagram out what each guy does on each of those calls youll be a top 5 knowledgeable football fan easy this is not to mention the boost itll give to your madden game to never blow an assignment out of ignorance andor picking the right guy to free lance with

im talking about the uniforms seen here

it just feels like a wasted opportunity for that our home and throwbacks look so similar
nah the steelers have the best uniforms in the nfl and should never deviate

same with pitt pitts home jerseys are the best looking jerseys in all of sports
there arent enough downvotes in the world for those oregonduckwannabe festivals of hideous
not a fan of the greywash at all

id sooner take the prison stripe uniforms
boo i dont think we need alternates at all our unis are great but if the nfl is going to insist on alternates to sell the merch cant blame them its a business i want something that screams stillers
grey uniforms are just always so boring no variant of making them more steeleresque will make grey less boring the only grey uniform that works in my mind is the seahawks 3rds and thats even a stretch

if there is any change at all to the unis it should be block numbers maybe with the steelers patch whites go the same way

color rush stays bumblebee unis come back once a year
cool but not very steelers i vote to bring back the bumble bees
meh maybe mix in the metal gray but dont make it the whole uniform

we really need to pump the breaks on our untethered optimism

i want the steelers to succeed as much as anyone but we have only played two games against average garbage and we did not win convincingly in either

confidence levels are high but we got to remember its only week 3
if fuller is healthy i wouldnt at all be surprised if we saw a lot of max protect that and picking on bush in coverage with akinsdukedajohnson

is that ray ray mccloud number 14
tj looks likes he flying in circles

watt bowl hype
score predictions i say steelers 2420
its still 11 pm for me
im awake lets goooooooooo
fucking week 3

there have been signs of greatness there have been signs of rust there has been mike tomlin wanting more and not settling for anything but perfection

this week the pittsburgh steelers answer the bell and back up the hype that is flooding point state park this week we go from unbridled excitement to damaging on the prowl hunger aint granny double shifting this bitch all gas no brakes

this week we fucking tell the league whats up

it hit different dont it this squad this team this city we are hoisting a new flag and taking back our rightful mother fucking place as the fucking leaders of the afc north the afc and the fucking league the seat is still warm from the last time we sat there

nows the time to be hungry desperate unfucking predictable turbocharged recalcitrants of death

nows the time to walk out on that field and knock the goddamn taste out of the mouth of anyone that has ever doubted us
lets fucking goooooo
week 3 you fuckers time to see if you can beat a team inn desperate need of a win
5 am here been up for a bit but i always wake up early and never sleep too well

nerves are definitely real this is a game where we cant play sloppy and make stupid mistakes plus there are a few real threats lurking on the field like jj who could do some serious damage if they get a chance definitely feels like a game we could walk away with but im not about to write off the texans just because they went 02 against the chiefs and ravens

we win today and the pity party continues for the texans with some starting to entertain the idea that maybe they just arent good

once the sun comes up and the dogs get out of bed itll be time to get them into their jerseys and put on mine about half an hour before kickoff go pickup my chinese food got a nice hybrid member og at 29 to smoke for the game today and a victory preroll set aside which is a sativa player 1 at 23

lets fucking go
nice to finally see some motherfucking effort go into these lame ass motherfucking gameday wakeup posts smdh
is anyone else kinda worried about this game lol
hype for the hyphen

not for us west coast bois
3417
going to early church so we can be home to watch the game
take my vote only cause hes a canadian only how bout dem cowboys


he always does that to the titans this is the trap game
its a 100pm game so unfortunately unlikely to see 500 yard 6 td ben all his 500 yard and 6 td games were either late afternoon or primetime games 100pm ben is unfortunately when we usually see worst ben
5050 on this game hopefully they dont sleep on an 02 team per usual watson is scary good imo keys to winning are constantly pressuring him and limiting mistakes something else to consider their coach has poor game management
its the trap game i said it earlier in the week texans are a desperate team
im with ya bud 9 hours til kickoff
its definitely the trap game theres no way we should have better odds to beat the texans than we had before we beat denver and the giants
10 texans win

1 5006 ben game

89 something in between
if ben doesnt throw the ball to a texans defender we should be ok
i hope they come out with a w that is all
youre not alone ive been thinking these are the games that they seem to traditionally lose
trap
cue admiral ackbar
deadass though
stop saying this is a potential trap game

the texans are a good football team theyre far better than their record
so damn true
the texans arent the giants broncos bengals etc are we favorites yeah but not overwhelmingly so

too early in the season for that i think
he is good at football when i see claypool get a catch i say yes i think he is good at his job i hope he stays in the steelers employ that is all
when i see chase claypool not targeted i say no
i agree
vote upward

i love it when chase does well at that sport that he plays
i see this post i say yes
les claypool was in the band primus for a long time but for a short while he did a side project called les claypools flying frog brigade

its the most random thing in the world but whenever i hear chase claypools name i always mutter and his flying frog brigade under my breath

this has nothing to do with anything but i like that band name and needed to get that off my chest
when claypool not on field i say no

when claypool on field i say yes
as a canadian fan of the steelers i had to order his jersey hopefully he can become a big part of this team

yes record it

i have watched too many high caliber steelers squads go into should be win situations and coming up short titans and raiders in back to back weeks of when they sucked
im still amazed at how many people think houston is a definitive bad team when any team in the league would be 02 after playing kc and baltimore to start the season pittsburgh would be 02 if we had to do that no doubt in my mind
uhhhh dude shut up this is a trap game for sure
already wrong lol
not looking to accurate rn
holy shit
yikes
haaaard disagree based on what ive seen from my steelers lol
dont post this unless its after the fact
not quite 3513 but ill take a win anyday
we should get their watt because we beat them itd be just like when mega man beats a boss and gets their weapon
would be a great meme if we didnt have a thirdrate secondary
this didnt age well i still have hope
well this aged poorly
im worried that keith butler is going to do some stupid shit and try to blitz watson like we have been doing against the giants and broncos if he does that we will absolutely get picked apart by watson hope butler is smart enough to realize that
thanks for sharing your anxieties worry is interest paid on trouble borrowed
maybe you shouldnt be too worried i saw a stat this week that said watson had one of the worst qbrs when pressured so maybe thats not such a bad gameplan
disagree you should be putting as much pressure on watson as possible no doubt that he will break many tackles but you have to keep him uncomfortable their oline is pretty bad force him to make throws
dont worry be happy

its game day my dude
watson is terrible under pressure
i think a good combo of pressure and contain can go along way when you have a stout front and speed on the outside you can neutralize running qbs danger is watson just throwing to hopkins running freeoh wait
im mad

he mad

but i aint stressin
we play in the division with lamar jackson im not too worried that butler wont scheme well for watson i am worried about the drop off in run defense from week 1 to week 2 and of course the secondary needs to be better this week
maybe you were right
lets hope this game doesnt come down to butts intelligence
we will shut down every thing but the qb run watson will run all over the place big ben probably has a pick or two we probably win by 3 or lose by 14 this has trap game written all over it
honestly i doubt it


texans have the worst o line in the league and we have the best pass rush hopefully he realizes that we can get pressure and sacks without blitzing
your worries that the dc of the best defensive unit in professional football might not understand defense at the same lofty level as you internet guy are probably unfounded
stfu and stop posting reactionary bullshit after one half of football

this post aged humorously
how ya like them apples we did it

edit guess i should have said break past 27 since that was the highest output we had last season
i like the optimism
oooooooohhh boy were trying
looking pretty possible right now
we literally could have ran 3 yards and gone past the 28 points mark

hey guys giants fan coming in peace just wondering and had a quick question on who you guys think i should start at wr2 for my espn fantasy team juju or diontae i just picked up diontae and not too familiar with your guys wr situation i had juju starting ever since week 1 against my giants and of course he goes off but he only got me 118 points last week and i unfortunately lost by 02 points im leaning more towards starting diontae but wonder what yall think thanks for the advice and hope you guys beat the texans today


edit thanks for all the suggestions im now leaning towards putting juju back in the starting lineup and benching diontae good luck to all of you guys in fantasy and against the texans
full ppr diontae standard or 12 juju
this is tough because dionte has been getting a lot of targets lately id say juju because diote has played a little sloppy the last couple games muffed punt and a fumble im starting juju as well
why not start one at flex and one as wr2 they can both be supported every week
juju has been out of practice with a hurt knee im sure hell be good for the game but something to consider id probably go juju because hes really clicking with ben since his return but honestly you cant go wrong with either
if you have another strong wr starting and can take a mini gamble i say start johnson i have johnson starting this week ob my fantasy team i feel like hes going to have a breakout game with ben soon and as betting its this week
id go juju over johnson on this one

johnsons hands arent 100 surefire and hes already displayed some less than desirable catchesdrops this season with that in mind i think juju gets more attention because the texans will take advantage of great field placement and punish us for turnovers

thinking we play this one more cautious and johnson is a wild card
juju is the safe bet jhonson is the boom or bust stress out watching the game till the boom or cry through the bust i have jhonson in this week because i think hes going to boom today
nfl network reported ben made an effort to work with diontae a lot this week that combined with more targets may mean a big game for diontae today
its really a 5050 honestly good luck


i like how he thinks i could actually make it to the game anyways
we are allowed to concern ourselves with things of this nature

i love that even in a scripted 30 second clip he still drops the man never change coach and things of that nature
i love coach t
the standard is the standard

be very glad you didnt see that i was working that day and i kept checking the score and every time i looked i was another td for the texans one of the most ridiculous lopsided stat losses of alltime
heres the espn summary for the game the texans had a 40 yard fumble return for a td a 70 yard int return for a td and a 65 yard int return for a td they managed a fg on their own


i watched that one the most frustrating game ive ever seen 400 yards of offense and your defense gives up 40 yards and you lose because your o has 3 turnovers that are returned for tds
i was there and people were screaming for tommy maddoxs head i still remember a guy repeatedly screaming burn in hell maddox they dominated in everything but a couple of pick sixes made it a blowout loss
the frustration of that game still feels like yesterday be glad you missed it

i wish there was a nfl package that they didnt play commercials id rather watch the players stand around bsing for five minutes than watch another state farm commercial jesus
vince williams has played out of his mind so far this year all 3 games

just dont put him on a wr please
i cant believe that noncall on claypool you could see his whole arm being held from the moon
this is the most pathetic excuse of a fucking referee crew ive ever fucking seen
i am going to lose my fucking mind i have now watched for the last 2 fucking years that the oline is allowed to fucking hold tj whenever they fucking want it might be that im biased so im always watching but some of it is just ridiculous dude is getting fucking tackled
having juju not having juju
fire these garbage ass trash cans with stripes
im not going to start praising conner as just an incredible rb but anyone saying hes not a good player clearly is expecting too much he gets the job done and thats all we need
2 timeouts and half a minute yeah lets kneel on it
im probably the king of excusing drops but both of those were must catches
like am i an idiot thats pass interference by every definition of the rule no he literally made him make that catch on handed by wrapping both arms around one of chases what the fuck
is that not dpi holding a full arm back
im glad the players arent as mentally weak as some of the posters here
if i hear texans are 02 one more time my brain is going to explode
this is why i hate prevent defense defense gets soft in order to not give up a td instead of stopping a score whats the point of it as long as they have timeouts by the time they get to the redzone it doesnt matter anyways and youre just letting them get there for free watson took them 75 yards in under a minute dumbasses
mccloud is a madman holy fuck he ate that hit
if you are blaming ben or claypool you are a fucking idiot who doesnt know shit
this officiating crew is a joke
conor at 53 yards per carry mcfarland at 7 yards per carry maybe we should keep running
i cant believe we pulled this one out the first two games were mismatches this is the first win that actually tells me this team could be legit
when your entire defense is based around pressuring the qb its hard to win when the refs refuse to call holding
2 minute drill ben is my favorite ben
can we just tell ben that every drive is a 2 minute drill
i dont know about you but that was not claypools fault that was pi as fuck these refs are blind
nice pick but holy shit these holds are getting ridiculous how do our opponents have 0 holding calls in 3 weeks
i hate these tik tok commercials so much
were 30 when was the last time we were 30
are wenot gonna talk about how his arm was held
love how the nfl just decided to not call holding this year
every time the other team scores i think them stillers are a bunch of bums


every time the stillers score i think them stillers are goin to the super bowl
i am not a fan of drops and things of that nature
mccloud looks like our kick returner moving forward
how the fuck is that not pi
well fuck freaking 1 hand held and no call and he still almost had it also eat a dick announcer youre allowed to say he got away with pi
fuck these refs last week we got called the most bs dpi but apparently you can hold a receivers whole ass arm down
so no one saw the corner pulling chases arm when he was trying to make the catch no one
that was a good drive in my opinion scoring a touchdown was the proper strategy there
juju lead blocks so well esp for a no1 then the 2pt too
all im saying is were mothafukkin undefeated since the return of the chonky king thats my motherfukkin qb 30
official 2 watts beat 1 watt

science
imagine not covering juju lmao
texans were giving up the most qb pressure in the league

steelers were getting the most qb pressure in the league

none of that is working out
just removed my blue sweatshirt to reveal my steelers shirt our fortunes are about to change
damn ray ray dont give a fuck
every success by this offense is in spite of fichtner not because of him
after a 3andout give up an immediate sack run up the middle when you need 19 yards throw a 14 yard pass when you need 15 yards

everything about that was unbelievable stupid
the run on 2 and 19 is like pulling out just to finish on yourself
he fucking had claypools arm wtf
how is that not holding wtf
well thatll work now get a god damn touchdown and the 2 point conversion
that tj hits gonna piss some people off lmao
ok ben now we need a drive dont let this pick go to waste
tennessee next week thatll be rough as fuckkkkk but if we can shut down henry who knows
i hope this is a lesson to most of you its not over in the 1st quarter ben is a bad motherfucker and our defense is not something to fuck with 30 baby lets goo
jj talking to his brothers like he lost a bet and doesnt want to pay lol
imagine how many sacks tj would have if they didnt hold him every play
let ben run 2 minute offense all game all of our best drives this year are ben running the offense
maybe a hot take but we are better with ben
i want us to keep juju so bad
lmao they went 75 yards in 50 seconds
tomlin better shred this fucking secondary up what the fuck are they doing back there
they never overturn spot challenges but that spot was so bad this one will be
why are we handing it off to connor on 2nd and 19
why the fuck would you run it on 2nd and long
holy fuck refs
he held his arm the entire fucking time
that is fucking blatant dpi
if the refs wont call pi expect them to keep doing it
im praying for a big turnover here we really need it
fuck it houston just foul us refs are blind as shit
tj that man has a family
mike hiltons got dollar signs in his eyes this year lmaooo
thank god he was down fumble out the endzone would be a turnover
claypool is a unit
claypool is love claypool is life
for all the shit we give fichtner i think that was a really great playcall from him
reading this game thread has been the text version of the they had us in the first half meme haha
what was that stat before about the texans winning a bunch if they have the lead going into the half
wtf i never kneel on madden what are these coaches doing shake my smh
weve secretly replaced every steelers receiver with ike taylor lets see if they notice
redzone fg erggg

also jaylen samuels being in on 3rd and 1 is one thing but running a delayed handoff out of shotgun on 3rd and 1 with jaylen samuels is another

randy that was honestly just fucking stupid
so i gotta say i dont think our secondary is the same as last year
blatant hold on watt nice refs
that drive looked way too easy for houston
where had minkah been in the last 3 weeks
holding on tj again
qb sneaks are too easy

every steelers oc
i feel like if james harrison was chasing me i would at least make it across the street before stopping for a breather became a thought
where are the juju haters now that ben is back
they scored in thirty fucking seconds
how the hell did our secondary go back to being so awful when all the same guys came back
for your halftime show heres roger wiping a booger on a girl with one leg
when the offense does well the defense shits the bed and vice versa both rarely play well in the same game
secondary does not look good minkah is invisible they cant rely on the pressure getting there every time theyre getting sliced up whenever watson has time to throw

also i know were getting the ball back at the beginning of the second half but come on with 25 seconds we shouldve at least taken a shot or two downfield every point counts in what looks to be a shootout against a great offense
were down by 4 we get the ball back and tomlin has been very good at turning things around at half time lets take a minute to appreciate that we arent the rams and arent being blown out
remember were the pittsburgh steelers were not allowed to win challenges
refs cant see shit
james donte moncrief conner
so many passes off hands


makes you appreciate ward and brownwho is unfortunately batshit crazy now
id like one turnover please thank you football gods
tj is being held every play
just held his fucking arm down
dpi wtf
missed pi
he would have had the fucking catch if he had both his mother fucking hands
these refs are fucking ass
how is that not pass interference
wtf 21 was grabbing claypools arm
another week where the refs should lose their jobs
i wonder if we can train an ai to make reffing calls it could go rampant and still be better
nice of watson to tell hilton where he was throwing the ball
watson got a little too cute staying in bounds and got rocked
defense please end them with a big pick
god xavier grumble flashbacks oh my god lol

ok prediction mike talks to bob at half time trades jj for 4 cases of iron city and jj starts for us in the 2nd half
check 41 for roids 1 man cant stop vance
i know huston has a terrible o line but for fucks sakes our secondary still needs to play
fuck deshaun and his guitar
secondary blows i was worried with how bad they looked against daniel jones and fucking jeff driskel so im not surprised watson has carved them up
bro they are holding like crazy
i browsed 8 sites for divorce attorneys today
who else thinks randy fichtner should be forced to smoke crack and pcp before each game so he isnt so predictable
god imagine if this team didnt start so slow every game
see kids this is why we dont panic in the first quarter
we like wide open passes and things of that nature
im sorry but steven nelson looks awful this year so far
nelson looks like absolute trash today
can we please have an offense and a defense at the same time like just once
did we resign artie burns in the form of steven nelson
our secondary is buttcheeks this year
i dont really care for the leagues decision to stop calling holding penalties this year is the offense not already at a huge advantage at all times with all the other rule chsnges they need to gimp the teams that rely on a pass rush to succeed come on
why the fuck did we keep going out of bounds with like 150 to go in their territory
anyone a little worried about minkah
he is half a yard passed the first down marker
good challenge well see where the refs dart lands
these refs fucking suck that spot was off by like 2 yards
2nd and 19 lets run for 3 yards jesus fuck what
fucking ridiculous decision to run on 2nd down
way to take advantage of that nice punt return
offensive play calling is abysmal running on 2nd and 19 with this team is a bad decision we dont have derrick henry who can get 8 yards on any given play
dpi
had his arm
holding his whole hand
they refuse to call pass interference holy fuck dude
that was pi but randy what the fuck are you doing you get the ball at the 45 and get 2 yards worst oc in the league
great pick also great hold on watt that led to the pick instead of a sack
holy shit watson got murdered
there has been some outrageous holding on tj going uncalled
1 did the nfl get rid of holding calls seriously i have to ask


2 deshawn for protocol right when youre slow to get up they have to take him under the tent right
bens been overthrowing the fuck out of claypool today
melodramatic yinzers in shambles
juju looking like ward on these blocks
nice 2 points
end this fucking game defense come on i fucking believe in yall
i shrieked so loud at the td my boyfriend thinks his ears ruptured
what a phenomenal play call

claypool is so dangerous
they are very close to breaking the 25 game streak of having a to in a game

hope i didnt jink
well i owe the d a big apology way to step tf up
thats a dub ladies and gents


see you next week for a another edition of i hate everything from this sub
alot of no calls on tj this year
big bud 4 sacks and an attempted murder charge on deshaun mark my words
come on secondary we cant get a sack on every down

ahhhh the ol run run pass punt you hate to see it
oh my god dionte johnson has some great moments but sometimes i really question his football iq
time for a signature 96 yard juju td
wanna see me throw over em mountains
i think after cleveland cuts baker

he should keep doing the commercials except show him trying to break into the stadium
the first quarter was the vince williams show
are we just not calling holding on tj watt today
hey guys ready for another 3 and out
what a great defense we have right best in the nfl right
does our secondary and keith butler know theyre allowed to cover their receivers you dont have to stay 5yds away from them at all times
the holds on tj are infuriating i mean he obviously always gets held but these ones are ridiculous
r e l a x
i had zero hope ebron was gonna catch that lmao
hands rated e for ebron
ebron caught the ball obviously fire tomlin
hilton is the best tackling corner in the nfl
huh using the tight ends does something who would have thought
can we let ben just always run the two minute offense no matter the time on the clock
hah i knew the steelers would suddenly play completely differently unlike you reactionary idiots cool guy
holding isnt a penalty this year just hug the lineman and let it be
cool cool baby shit soft d
nelson regressed so hard
nelsons been garbage this year
very cool very good playing
our secondary is really concerning
i guess our defensive gameplan is to let deshaun watson develop fucking arthritis by torching our secondary so maybe he cant continue to dominate us in the 4th quarter
i cant believe the d couldnt have closed out the half without points like jesus
a blind monkey fucking a football could cover better than our secondary this year
brooke pryor on twitter saying looks like tj is fine
really fucking bad spot jesus
how can an official miss it by that much
are these refs blind they are constantly spotting it like a half yard to a yard behind where it was
he literally smacked the ball down a half yard over it
good challenge tomlin
what a horrible spot we shouldnt even have to challenge that
defense id like to order an apple turnover
were overdue for a turnover
id be okay if ray ray took over pr fulltime
randy you absolute idiot
nothing like a run on 2nd and 19
his arm is being held the whole time
holy no call on the pi
how can you not see that holding thats bs
missed dpi
yo 2 weeks in a row what is this
a drive here to get them out of the shadow of their endzone is highly desirable

gripping analysis
we need a turnover
hilton is bad in coverage said yall an hour ago
i hate when i try to upvote a great comment then it keeps scrolling down because a ton of people comment at once makes me sad
welcome to the pittsburgh hilton and turnovers
dear mike hilton

we love you dearly

sincerely
steeler nation
a got a theory on bens bad foot mechanics this year hes throwing off his back foot because his bionic new arm is too strong as we are seeing with the deep ball hes got to take some off
am i losing my mind or have we taken the play clock down to sub 5 seconds like every play this game lol
diddid we just run on third and short whats happening
how do we look like absolute garbage one drive and then like that the next
fucking steeler football



thats


how


we



do


it
and the 2points
now thats a drive
juju is quietly a really good run blocking wr
dangerously close there

no harm no foul young buck gotta be smarter than that
we got lucky on the fumble there
of course fichtner doesnt cover his nose
do we even need to run a play can we just kneel down three times
dont be proud take a knee for
steelers had the ball for 1150 of the games final 1327
man if we can beat this offense i really like our chances against tennessee next week really loving this team so far this year
all you jumpers complaining butts have to explain yourselves you jump ship so quickly you weak willed fools stand beside your team
well if we are gonna be good for one half ill take the second half every time
30 boys see yall next week
you have 24s and 2 timeouts try for fg range fuck
you all need to chill we cant get a td on every single drive that drive looked clean and we got some points on the board
why in the hell didnt we go for it on that 4th and 1 damn it teams are just going to do a three to five stepback with their qb and do an air assault on our secondary all season long if they cant fix it
what a blatant hold i know they intend to flag less holding calls but geez does he have to rip tjs helmet off first
run run pass punt give me the fucking playcalling holy fuck
oh look the return of the run run pass play sequence
every time dj catches a punt its going to be something great or something absolutely terrible
so this will be the rude awakening game huh
secondary has been lacking all season but still alot of game left to play
if im a coach this year im telling my whole oline to hold on every play refs arent calling it so why not
yall need to calm down its been 1 quarter
that houston defender trying to scissor kick the ball out of ebrons hands lmao
alright defense now we need you to get in the game
man ive never seen one of our tes do that thats pretty hot

and they didnt call the clear holding by the defender lol
put your pitchforks and torches away stop overreacting in the 1st quarter
im just so grateful to have ben back last year a 143 deficit wouldve been an l this year we actually have a chance
sometimes its really gag worthy how far a network manages to crawl up its own ass when promoting itself
alright this is it time for a mapletron td
with a name like rayray mccloud you can only be good at football
love the james harrison commercial
1714 id be drooling at halftime
wr diontae johnson is being evaluated for a possible concussion and his return is questionable
derek watt out of the game with a hamstring injury
fuck the announcer tj in on defense for pittsburgh but jj always a factor for houston like tj wasnt the runner up to dpoy last year and not a factor fucking dickhead
holy shit how did juju get that open
fuckers better pay juju
hot damn i love ben juju so much pay my boy juju in the offseason please
can we stop playing zone now please thank you
this secondary looks bad
a qb sneak banged randy fichtners wife its the only explanation
3 yards to the first lets throw it for 50 yards
thats 100 a first down
holy shit guys we might win a challenge
i think thats actually a good challenge
he had that by a mile
cant wait to see how we get fucked out of this one
the virgin short gain vs the chad 30 yard penalty
alejandro was just trying to find a flag to salute downfield
i feel so drained watching steeler games its always close when it shouldnt be and its too stressful
god it looked bad livebut on the replay it was even worse of a drop
houston should feel happy i would be upset at any points on their side they gave up two 4th down conversions after being gifted that challenge
holy shiok mccloud
nothing says i want to win like a 2nd and 19 draw play
need 19 yards run right up the middle

fuck you fichtner
colquitt has been incredibly underwhelming
smh running on 2nd and 19
run on 2nd and 19 the standard is the standard
tuitt is like fuck this ill do it myself
refs are fucking blind holy shit
you can just hold his arm like that
uhhhh can you legally hold on to an arm of a reciever
blatant pass interference
big surprisedupree comes around when he has a legitimate counterpart in watt
i swear its like our defense plays phenomenal on 1st and 2nd downs then just says fuck it on 3rd
defense comes through
pay mike hilton ffs
lets go hilton
the streak continues
thank god for watt
there we fucking go baby hilton you sexy son of a bitch
watson is a very mobile quarterback dline is getting penetration but watson is looking good extending plays really great to get that pick hopefully we can capitalize
3 straight outstanding drives by the d with one bad pass play given up holding the texans to 0 points

offense needs to stop fucking around and take advantage of this
i hope the steelers end this drive by scoring a touchdown
lets go connor i know you still got it
james fucking conner is hungry like the wolf
loving how conner is running today
everything exactly as we needed on that drive
here we fucking go
and the 2 point is not even my birthday yet
tj outwatting jj today
im just glad he didnt fumble that through the end zone
well he is damn lucky but still nice playcall
mapletron
their defense is exhausted steelers got 35 min top already
the offense finally clicked boys
while obviously it still would have been bad if that had gone through the end zone claypool continues to show how good his awareness is because his sole focus going down was trying to save that ball
last time we started 30 we won the super bowl i hope this team stays healthy so they can keep this chemistry going and continue to develop

titans next week gonna be dope
tomlin haters getting ready to eat crow
we dont do comfortable wins and things of that nature
undefeateddddddd
yikes that gave me flashbacks to grimble vs broncos
how do you even give up a td in 40 seconds you have to be trying to be that bad
gonna be a close game cant wait for the yinzer overreactions every time the texans get a first down including my own
i need me a birthday win come on boys
best believe im already drunk in order to get through this game steelers 27 texans 20 book it
they call dpi on other teams
juju is the ultimate grinder the man isnt always flashy but he gets those extra yards whichever way he can
pittsburgh has gone 20 straight games without a score on an opening drive


so weird not hearing the crowd on a pi call
running out of the shotgun


isnt that one of the things we hate lol
if youre gonna run it just give it to connor
you have conner as your power back and you run it with samuels no wonder we never score a td on an opening drive
why samuels

it was all working and they got fancy with your worst rb
somethings wrong with our secondary idk if its the scheme or what but theres a big difference between now and last year
get vince williams off of brandin cooks jesus christ
ah the ok run run pass punt offenseugh
vintage 96 yard juju td incoming
how is that not pi thats definitely catchable regardless of where it lands
alright ben we get it you can still throw deep can you just get a first down
what the fuck are we doing
i dont want to be pounding beers at 140pm but here we are
that was a great punt past the 50 and enough hang time to allow the guys to get down there awesome

randy fichtner and keith butler need to go i dont think theyre good enough to win a super bowl
what a fucking hit vince
one day we gonna dominate a game not today but one day
6 dbs and still pass for the 1st lol what a joke
uncalled holding on that
nothing like tj getting tackled
this is fucking bullshit tj is getting held so badly
tj getting held every play lmao
dude the holding is so bad you can see handfuls of jersey
hey can we maybe stop with the zone d
allow me to reiterate this secondary is fucking trash
where the hell is our pass coverage watson is killing us hes marched down the field multiple times
why does this feed look so bad after a quarter and a bit of football jesus christ if you dont have something nice to say dont say it at all
juju is looking more like hines ward every day great blocking by him
mcfarland is so much faster than conner its disgusting
i personally believe there isnt anything wrong with ben or the offense i think its more of a play calling issue i swear they only want to start playing ball and looking good when theyre down on the scoreboard otherwise they are completely lackadaisical its extremely frustrating
ben with the cut block
ben with a fucking block
ben with the block
that was 100 ben right there what other 38 yr old qb is throwing blocks on a 270 pound lb
no way this worked
that block from ben put him in the secondary he can do it all
diontae johnson is headed to the locker room not sure if it was mentioned on tv i heard it from missy matthews
flashbacks to last week when we killed lock on that sack
i want more mcfarland
pretty sure 18 is being evaluated for a concussion
really not a fan of just running twice there
derek watt hurt and dionte is getting checked for concussion fuck me man
everyone is talking about holding on watt


im still pissed when we played byron leftwich and the jags and they held the shit out of us on a 3rd and long and byron ran for a first to seal the game


fucking holding
really wish wed bring in some young fiery oc
we have a lead now can all the people crying please relax and we get the ball back after half
things have turned around ever since i changed my shirt to the one i was wearing the opening game
he ran harder to his celebration spot that into the endzone
see i told you pessimistic fucks fair weathers coming back all excited all the sudden fuck off youre either here for the team or youre not
okarafor solidifying his starting job at rt forever
josh allen sneaky top 10
this secondary man what was that
wtf happened to our secondary we didnt lose anyone from last year
ddefense bbbest in the llleague hhello
wtf is this defense
either a sack or we give up 20 every time
what in the fuck are we doing on defense here we just needed to keep them down for a minute
5 plays 75 yards 50 seconds pretty fucking tough to give up a td drive that quickly
is it the scheme or the players
the secondary is looking mighty suspect
offenses playing against the steelers defense have not been called for holding this year
can the d put together a better game plan during halftime
45 seconds right down the fucking field
nelson sucks so bad this year what the hell
if our defense plays like this against baltimore we will be blown out
who needs 3 points fuck it take a knee
fuck you butler great defensive play calling you schmuck
why not try to do something at least just let ben heave it there but no well just kneel with 24 seconds left
2 time outs and take 0 shots at the end zone
jeff driskel did the same shit to us
better see some actual half time adjustments if this team truly wants to make it far lets see theyre willing to get out of their stubborn ways
i would like coach to do locker room speeches so we can start kicking ass again
steelers defense has gotten really close to getting home on a number of occasions i honestly think there is a small element of bad luck there what concerns me more is the regression of the secondary especially nelson
50 we come out doing run run pass
the secondary is not playing as fast as usual
but thats not the only problem

were playing soft zone defense and deshaun is tearing us apart we have to play more aggressive man coverage
roethlisberger pointing out the fucking spot is the energy i needed today
ben wheels roethlisberger
he got that
that was a bad spot
ben with the stiff arm
oh shit a tomlin challenge
ben is pure fucking speed
bad fucking spot
refs dislike us today it kinda seems oo
thats a ben that wants to win
he absolutely got that
give that big man his first down he worked hard for that
spot challenges are so damn risky but i think he was there
hes easily a half yard over
bens face with that stiff arm has to be a meme later
wow thats a shit call game doing the fucking freeze frame on his knee down and the ball at the first or maybe just shy by an inch
these refs are embarrassing for that challenge and that pi lmaooo
catch the fucking ball
this drive went to shit
thank god for bos at least
catch the fucking ball
guess were feeding bosgod again

we cant keep fizzling out in the redzone like this
thank you houston for running the ball twice
we love 3 yard runs on 2nd and 19 dont we folks
okwhy would you play a draw play on 2nd and 19 with a future hof qb
these play calls are adam gase type shit
this is why we all call for fichtners head every year lol
i feel like the call came into ben as run it up the middle for 20
should have been pi fuckers they called that shit on us all day last week
i guess you can hold onto a wrs arm now
jesus theres swallowing whistles and theres these refs are we sure there are actually refs in the stadium
ill say it again fuck these refs
looks like the texans remembered they can pass on us at will
trash refs
oh shit


watt drilled watson
big tiny mike hilton
watt held that whole play holy shit im losing it guys my neighbors have got to hate me now
what could go wrong pointing at who your throwing at
just let ben be the fucking oc randy can just chill
this has been a huge game for ebron
when the offense is clicking theyre dangerous please more of them kind of drives
onner strong
jesus juju i really would have loved you keeping that held tight through the ground cause i hate trusting refs on anything catch related
god conner is the most when hes good hes great and when he off hes infuriating running back for me i love him right now though
huge huge huge huge huge
im not going to exaggerate at all

we have the best pulling guards in the nfl
alright defense lets show the fuck up give it back to the offense and run this motherfucker out
i love watching the fanbases opinion on conner change so much every half hour
jujus just been quietly doing the dirty work this year they gotta get him a nice little ten yard in route or something so he can work with some space
tj has already won the watt bowl
i feel like conner never tries to dodge anything he always just runs straight ahead and hopes for the best
wait did we just call the right play
i still fucking hate the touchback rule
claypool showing up at the last minute but showing up nonetheless

see ya texans 30 boys victory preroll
houston is a complete team a win here is really good
ayo claypool almost made me shit myself all good tho
joe burrow is on the ground every other play in the bengals game he is not going to last if the bengals dont protect him
buckle up everyone browns have a positive record for the first time in over a decade
once again reminded of that god awful fumble out of the end zone rule but luck might actually be on our side today
the defense had an amazing second half
tj and derek so mom officially loves us more now
so excited with how the team has started this season up the steelers never doubted the win today
here we go steelers here we goooooooo
i said it and ill say it again our secondary is looking mighty suspicious
as soon as i bought a minkah jersey he lost his superpowers all my fault everyone
whos worried
i said this when it was 143

the only thing lm going to say is good teams battle back from bad starts they make adjustments and improve over the course of a game the next 2 hours will determine if we are a good team hope the answer is yes because so far it hasnt been

i think we can say we are a good team now
lets goooooo
16 years as a steelers fan has taught me to never be confident or comfortable about any game so ill hope we win but ill believe well win when theres 30 seconds left and were up by 10
if we can continue to play d like that well win
offense is churning nicely this drive
we actually didnt start with the classic run run throw 3 and out this game incredible
jaylen as a third down back huh
21 straight games without an opening drive touchdown
steelers figured everybody plays the pass with samuels on the field the got too fancy there

just run it up the damn middle behind your all pro c and g
oh dont start this shit
middle has been wide open for 6 years now i swear
tj held like a newborn baby
alright fit ben time for the deep ball
run run pass zero ingenuity
we were doing so good and you default back to the run run pass fuck off fichtner
the more desperate team is going to win today
texans 02 after playing two of nfls best teams
steelers 20 after playing two of nfls worst teams could be a reality check for both teams
diontae returning punts is goddamned roller coaster
fumbles too much dumb enough to fair catch at the 4 get him the hell off punts dont care how shifty he is
ya all miss switzer now
diontae is not very intelligent
why does johnson continue to return punts hes like an idiot back there fair catch inside the 5 the fuck
diontae is such a boom or bust on punt returns hell either make a boneheaded play or a huge return
this is gonna be an ugly game
i missed bens bombs down the field but i only miss them when they are completed
jesus bince he has a family man
odd play calls so far
bince might be a one trick pony but that trick is really satisfying to watch
i dont get how teams can watch the patriots dynasty running the same 4 high percentage plays for two decades and not attempt the same thing
tj is being held every single down
i still believe in us
our 3rd down defense is trash
we really need a td on the next drive if only to restore our confidence
if we dont get something going on offense this next drive then we might get killed defense clearly isnt going to win us this game so its up to ben and the offense to take it into their own hands
minkah officially looking bad this guy needs to make a play
this discussion thread is absolute cancer lol
ive been to most other nfl subs and can confirm that theyre all just as cancerous when their team is down
id suck a fat d1ck for 1014
i hate that new rams logo so much
big ben with the block
great block ben
ben trying to lay the wood
ben with the block
chase is too big to not be in here
welcome to pittsburgh you cute fuck
ebron caught that
a long sustained drive thats what im talking about
ebron coming through clutch fuck yes baby
been waiting for them to unleash ebron
exactly what was needed defense finally rested and got the touch
if we could just not give up more points until the half that would be great
alright minkah i smell a tip pass coming your way
ok so if we hold the texans to nothing until half this is a totally different game
stilllll holding tj
did diontae return looked legit shook up after that hit in the reverse
fb derek watt has a hamstring injury his return is questionable to todays game
aw man poor derrick
i am so sick of running in first and second
ebron is just a skinny lineman playing te dude is huge
conner is looking good today
nobody was near him
we get the ball back at halftime too lets go
woohoo thats my quarterback and thats my receiver
ju ju you making me see our super bowl chances are trutru
how can we drop seven and still leave guys open
our secondary has more soft spots than a babys head
this steelers d looking real weak rn
right down the field
holy shit how did they march down the field that fast
goddamn just letting them walk down the field
its like every time people start to take us seriously we do stuff like this and show why they shouldnt

our secondary is looking like dogshit today
wonder how our 20 second offense is
yeah i actually thought wed go into halftime with a lead
this secondary is really really bad right now whatever issues they have they need to correct fast im not expert enough to know if its scheme or talent but they fuckin suck
man what happened to our d come on boys
defense looks not good right now
just when i thought my blood pressure was going down they pull me back in
how is the defense so inconsistent every drive has been 3 and out or fucking easy drive for td thats so fucking bad
with this pass defense who cares if you have a good run defense if teams never have to run against you
its even more painful to know that this is what were gonna have to deal with the rest of the year because you know that no changes are gonna be made to the scheme
this zone shit has to stop
ben with the forward kneel making sure he keeps those rushing yards
never thought id say it this year but we need the offense to bail out the defense
why cant the fucking offense and defense click at the same time
gonna need a lot more than 26 to win today
nelson has sucked this year must have slacked during the offseason
damn some of those streams must be very far behind lol
god hes just sailing these long balls man
bruh these guys are open deep ben is just overthrowing them by miles
he got that
hit em with the big stiff arm lmao
good challenge
ben with that dad strength
he has it by a yard easy
bens accuracy is suspect
two shitty sets of refs in a row arent these guys like trained for months and shit
flacco special
horrible play call but ill take the penalty lol
ball dont lie
bens deep ball has not been pretty
what a bad play call on 4th and inches
this is a bad string of calls makeup call and now another makeup call because the makeup call was a bad call
2 terrible calls in a row lmfao
should have been 7 with how our secondary is getting torched 3s wont win it
right in the hands lol
catch the fucking ball
ben less pepper way less pepper ffs
cant be getting field goals when our defense allows tds in 40 secs
catch the fucking ball
i cant wait for this next texans drive where they successfully target nelson every play
ray ray got wheels
thankfully our defense showed the fuck up

lets get a damn touch down offense
solid tackle by edmunds
its a shame terrell is so fuckin shit at coverage because hes above average in run defense
thats it i love mccloud switzer as hard as does try at least would have been in the dirt on that one but this guy made it into a decent return
mccloud runs like he thinks that at any point in time he may have to run through a brick wall and i love it
instead of killer bees we got big macs vance ray ray and anthony does it work if not ill see myself out
ray ray is a grown ass man
run play on 2nd and 19 are we giving up on the drive dude the fuckkkk is this
2nd and 19 lets give it to glass connor great playcalling
this game is making me remember how much i hate randy fichtner
its randy fichtners world and were just livin in it
its almost like they should have actually fucking tried on second down so the third isnt so hard
need 16yds and we run a 15yd route
wheres the fucking flag on texans 42 on the kick
i would love to see a play action pass not a screen at some point this season i would also love us to go no huddle at some point we used to do these things with some frequency
thanks a lot feiler
the worst part of the run on 2nd 19 was that it wasnt even a draw
we aint winning football games without takeaways
hell yeah tuitt
uh oh bens hurtin ben dropping 300 yards and 4tds this half
so just hold his arm the whole time cool
refs are so fucking bad
wow thats hella pi lol
man that wouldve been a hell of a catch
ummm refs
these refs need to be beat
our inability to score tds in the redzone is really the story if we lose i blame that
edmunds just loafing around in no mans land
tj getting sick of this shit lol
thats what we fucking needed td next cmon
watsons definitely hurt
hilton is a fucking stud
anyone else notice how jacked jake from state farm is
so its week 3 two injured qbs and we still have to play the bengals twice still i feel bad for burrow
you gonna hold me fine ill get eround the outside and cook your ass later

tj
taking off the homer glasses for a second watson is playing really really well he reads the pocket well scrambles well can make most of the throws its been impressive lots of people here shouting at our secondary but it is pretty darn difficult to cover zone when the qb can extend for that long and make throws across your body
it makes me fear ravens a lot
feel bad for the dude who was happy he benched ebron in fantasy
i hate the browns but man chubb is a fucking beast
vance refrigeration back in business
mcdonald puny defense
8 points would be so fucking huge right now
james conner
give juju half that touchdown that block was clutch
no hesitation on that run just a missile
no more jc slander
thats the kind of drive i want to see from this offense everyone contributed
big catch juju
juju with the pure class block there
lets fucking go boys now d up lets get this done
hold it down defense and get ben that ball back
d has to make a stand lets go
hell of a drive boys way to execute for the td and two points defense needed that break lets go boys
nice block juju
ahhhhhhhh lets goooooooooo
28 points is more than they scored in any game last year
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
jj on the sideline watching the new model outperform him
this tj watt is pretty good
our team is so strange third and long on defense is always risky third and short on offense is low succes
so glad they went for it would had been a tough fg
that was dark
if that went out of the end zone i wouldve cried
perfect play calling this drive has been magical
that was dangerously close to a touchback
c l e n c h
bro that was scary af
thank god
thank fuck that wasnt a fumbled out of the end zone bullshit
just take 3 knees
i want another score just so we can get over 30 points for the first time since 2018
gotta give the defense props for stepping up big time in the second half the offense finding more consistency really helped as well once we can put it together for a full 60 well be tough to beat
i thought with texans being 02 this would be the game we let slip glad to be wrong

i think ben is primed to make a run
we havent scored 30 since 12218 against the chargers
second half defense brought it and offense clicked 4th quarter
30 biitttcheesss
our secondary just doesnt compare to our dline and linebacker core
3rd and 10 more like 3rd and ben
not even gonna take a shot randy you fucking coward
wait arent we losing shouldnt we have tried something there
these passes arent perfect but they should still be caught holy fk
this dude is so much better than switzer when it comes to punts
so far im loving rayray wayyy more than diontae on returning punts

please lord let them not blow this turnover on 2 runs 1pass punt bs
blow it up fire all coaches and coordinators trade everyone for draft picks ben is washed uptrash defense is overrated our season is overs

where are all the folks saying this stuff in the second quarter go steelers
two things are going to happen


1 were going to win this game


2 haters on this sub will bitch about it in every way possible


ride or die
ben hits a guy in the hands
some people in this sub ben and tomlins fault
jesus can they cram any more commercials into this
if fitzpatrick doesnt get his shit together the fos gonna turn around and give his money to juju
conner has dropped balls that bell wouldve caught i miss him
i cant stand randy on 2nd and 19 why dont you call a quick in out or slant so then youll have a manageable 3rd down
lets have a healthy win here bless the knees
lets gooo

ps i miss the tomlin grinning face flair that used to be here
wont be able to watch the game since my buddy is getting married have to settle listening to the steelers radio lets go here is to 30
chinese food is on hand dogs and myself are in jerseys the good weed is ground up and ready to rock for kick off victory preroll on stand by 120 ounce water jug refilled with ice and refreshing water

lets fucking do this
i want the steelers to win
omg leaving tj unblocked on the first play of the game

the balls on hou
im liking the play calling so far
juju is hines ward 20
chill out on ebron yall that bell was below his knees 3 ft behind him
thats what i wanna see from connor fuck yea
i love ben not forcing deep shots just taking what theyre giving us
fucking beautiful seeing an actual check down in action instead of immediately going straight for the check down option
why not give it to conner to pick up the first
what a weird playcall on 3rd and 1
thats a good first drive if we keep on pushing the ball but hopefully end with tds well win
just hate these shotgun runs we continue to get stuffed on
that shite run call disrespects the supreme juju effort to get the first down and keep the drive moving
texans have serious speed outside thats gonna be an issue crossers against man is gonna kill is
why was vince covering cooks
like a knife through warm butter
bruh why did they not call holding
i really dont have a good feeling about this game
wheres minkah at
wheres fitz dudes been a ghost this season so far im thinking that butler has tightened the game plan because we have an offense this year stop that

ok fuck this everytime i wear a jersey we play like hot garbage im taking it off sorry guys
banner is my eligible receiver get better soon big guy
run run pass you think opposing teams will figure it out s
i was really confused when we didnt start the game with two runs up the middle and then a sack im much more comfortable now
run run pass never saw it coming
hilton is iffy at best in coverage but holy shit he is by far one of the best blitzers and solo tacklers we have
good defensive series there gotta get pressure on watson
who calls for a fair catch that close to the end zone
what in the hell lol its like im watching a madden game
offense looking like doodoo
only need 7 better throw a deep ball ffs
another week of questioning over half of the offensive play calling and it being a butt clenching close game the entire time it seems
wtf ben just throw for 8 yards stop overthrowing downfield and killing our field position
ben finna blow that new elbow out with these overthrows
ince
im not worried about the slow offensive start i think well figure it out has to be hard on ben to be playing with so many new characters after a whole season off

but i want our play calling to be better to help them gel
our secondary is so ass that we literally shut down every single teams running game and we still get torched knowing they have to pass
god damm we fucking suck today
why is everyone so wide open
has minkah played this year
our secondary is good for allowing 23 20 yard completions on every opposing drive
why arent they calling holding im not sure if ive seen it this year
bush getting it done
another 3rd and long where we flubbed the zone coverage
remember when the defense was good
bush 100 saved a td there
classic steelers go down by 11 and the start playing for real
defense cant get off the field offense cant stay on the field its going to end with us losing by more than 15

highsmith didnt set the edge oof
what the hell is going on with our secondary it should not be that much of a liability anymore
calm down everyone the game isnt over
if the offense is going to keep putting the defense back on the field after 3 outs this is going to be really ugly houston start their drives almost near midfield every time
why are we playing zone the texans wr are not that good i really dont get it

fire tomlin incoming
glad im working and not able to watch
wondering how many more times tj watt gets tackled before theres a holding call
the only thing im going to say is good teams battle back from bad starts they make adjustments and improve over the course of a game

the next 2 hours will determine if we are a good team

i hope the answer is yes because so far it hasnt been
i love macfarland man lol hes gonna be so good long term
thank you for using mcfarland
mcfarland runs like a chicken with its head cut off
mcfarland is so damn fast
calm down everyone there are 40 minutes left in this game lets go steelers
you guys are honestly the hardest fans to listen to when its not going our way be a fan not a fucking critic
nice block ben
ben with the block
ben with the leading block
lol ben throwing a block
damn that snell run opposite the fb was actually a really good call
i just went from frustrated to happy so fast i think i got whiplash
i thought ebron was shit and needs to be cut
fine do it the hard way fucking showoff ben
great play to ebron for the td
thats a fucking drive
what a throw by ben an even better catch by ebron thats what he was brought in to do
and good throw
lets goooooooo
ok now its time for the d to show their stuff the secondary needs to tighten up and get a turnover
so anyone know how that grounding was grounding i am not in the mood to look up very specific rules but i was raised with if you throw it through the back of the endzone its never grounding
is cbs fucking with me right now with no ray liota with chantix
still holding tj
hilton never misses tackles man
wattdupree 2020
everyone gonna chill the fuck out now
oh hilton my hilton
jesus that punt tho
ray ray got us about 8 yards more than fair catch switz
ray ray nice to have a return man that is actually capable been a long time coming
that punt almost went into fuckin orbit
diontae being evaluated for a concussion as per missi matthews
conner showing off all those muscles just to get touched and go straight to the ground
juju shoutout to chuks for playing lights out right now
wow busted coverage

juju
ill take that blown coverage
juju
juju
fit ben to juju baby
texans ran away from juju like he was hopkins
duuude i was like juju baby why you walking
i told yall to relax

we got this
hope dionte is ok i think well be seeing more claypool the second half of he cant come back in we may get to see what the kid can really do
overreactions help turn the tide
ben is too old and the defense is hot trash
cant believe he literally walked in lol
we get the ball to open second half
uhh wait defense it isnt halftime yet
oh come on now dont give up a free field goal to end the half
tj being held on literally every fucking play is driving me nuts
our zone coverage is awful or was that terrible man
1 turnover please to thank
every time we blitz we get pressure fucking blitz
i mean who likes a lead why carry one into half
oh come the fuck on guys just fucking hold em for three
that drive was too easy good lord
defense is just completely deflating is rn
holy christ d
why does look like our defense in 2018
nelson pls
did nelson just not want to even try to jump and defend that
i dont understand how there are so many no calls on tj
need to start getting that pressure in faster and secondary needs to clamp down watson is getting the ball off way to quickly need to keep those receivers covered tighter just a little longer
does nelson have watson on his fantasy team
that was the most predictable thing ever sadly
if we lose this game that texans drive is the defining moment of the game
why the fuck we just waste it
alright i can only say its fine so many times

x200b

what the actual fuck was that watsons an amazing qb but we should be able to guard cooks cobb and fuller this is so bad
defense is in shambles
wed be up by 14 if we incorporated bubble screens you know its true
the defense has did the complete opposite of what they did previous 2 weeks
anyone thinking its gonna come out soon that minkah is playing hurt this much regression makes no fucking sense to me
like do they tell the secondary that the middle of the field is made of lava or something in practice
those reality shows are trash
if we come out this half in fucking zone
its weird how hard it is for us to convert on third and one
ben with these adrenaline deep balls
claypool would have caught that but fichtner is being a fucking moron
ummmm are we going to talk about how that bomb to washington was completely catchable
i think ben got it with the extend
challenge that
ben is mobile lmao
he absolutely got it
clearly a first down
captain fastfuck urinatingtree is gonna love this play
ben looking like josh allen out there
ben thicc and quikkkkkkk
thats a first
thats a good challenge ben got that
ben is a graceful gazelle
are we gonna win a challenge on big legs rothlesburners
kind of embarrassing that needed to be challenged really it was well past the line to gain and there wasnt anything unclear about that in real time
lol so everyone is fucking blind ok
did sonic just have a commercial for ice
no holding calls at all and a bullshit lost challenge fucking trash refs
thats honestly fucking horrible what the absolute fuck how in the hell is that not a completely definitive result
karma fucker
good job chase
4th and inches throw to the endzone
god i wish charles davis would just shut his fucking mouth for 2 seconds i know its his job but hes bad at it
idk about that call but good play by claypool to get the flag
the ol flacco special
these drops are killing me
catch the ball make good passes
bens not hitting guys in stride very much at all
3rd goal 15 out well fuck us
sweet hands conner
youre right i do not feel good about this
now we have to watch this secondary
yup a penalty and two dropped passes will end a drive for ya
is our defense going to hold them to 3 and out
good stop big return


big mo on our side
excellent return
we got a returner here fellas
absolute huge dick play from rayray that hit shouldve rocked him and he shrugged it off like it was fucking nothing
good stand for the d maybe that last drive of the 1st half embarrassed them
oh good run on second and 18 but not first or second and 10
2nd and 19and you run it
2nd and 19 better run it up the middle
a run on 2nd 19 lol
and theres the give up the drive altogether 2nd down inside run lol
i love that we decide to run on 2nd and 19 theres no chance we can convert so we may as well waste this possession am i right guys
what a joke
shoulda gone for it
colquitt has been less than underwhelming so far
i dont mind running on second and surprising them but it cant be conner idk why he runs through the center every run should of brought in mcfarland
just fire fichtner and have ben call all his own plays or hell crowdsource them literally cannot be worse twitch plays nfl anyone
watt gets held every play so annoying
was that a tiki barboat
doit tuitt
a torn titty would suck
please we need a td here come on
best field position of the day 3 and out
such obvious pi
not gonna call that dpi literally holding claypools hand
ben 1527 jesus with 6 drops
how was there not a flag
lamarr woodley for the tflsorrynot used to highsmith yet
we need a turnover so badly
anyone got a replay on the claypool no call
tj has been getting held all damn day he got tackled on that one and no flag
another tj watt hold fuck man
finally a pick
hilton
oh come alll yeee faaaaaithful

mike hilton
finally a turnover
lets go d
nice work d
hilton you magnificent bastard
lets gooooo hilton
tj watt makes that play right after he was held and blocked in the back this man is a legend
that no call on watt is a makeup call for not calling him being choked all game
i love picks when the guy who picks it just comes out of nowhere
turned on renegade for a little pump up and we got an interception coincidence i think not
i think ben really misses health miller because ebron is getting the same type of play calls he did unlike with vance
time to get that ebron jersey
is it just me or is conner always looking around for the hit rather than running when he breaks through the first tackle
oh no here comes 3rd and short
ben with the absolute missile way overthrown lol
connorrrr
james conner rushing td



stillers goin to a super bowl
atta boy james
juju
james fucking connor

juju blocking schuster
lets sink that 2 point conv too
juju with that heinz ward like blockingya love to see it
lets go boys
nice block by juju there on the td
did he catch it
i admit i was a bit down on conner in week one he looks good today
plz dfense
thought that was a drop lol
wow that was a truly impressive drive well done lets gooooooo
we got 2 wooooooooo
mmmm steeler schizophrenia
safe to say we made some adjustments at the half lets go
man tj getting all those fourth quarter sacks and fumbles last year is why i wish he got dpoy he makes big plays when it matters all the time
long drive boyslong drive please
soak this clock and kick a field goal and ill be happy
3rd and 26 ya love to see it

time to torch that clock
3rd and long and no bs pi call its a miracle
james fucking conner
a little off topic but you literally cant see shit through these camera setting either let me see more than 5 players at a time or dont charge a month worth of salary for fucking game pass come on
fuck sake we always wanna do this the hard way
i fucking love that play ben mustve called it
wow amazing playcall
great play call
3 for 3 on 4th down plays eh fuck you fitchner anyway
wow josh allen converted a 3rd and 22


hes been getting rekt this 2nd half but that was great
well done washington was scaring me there just drop after the first lol
benny snells mouthpiece having a spinning rim on it is so on brand lmao
why do we care about running the clock when they went 70 yards in 40 seconds like we need a score
lucky that wasnt a touchback lol
that was was close to being a touchback
okthat was scary
geesh that was closer
i was scared af
if the ravens and chiefs beat these dudes by double digits then damn it so should we
3 and 0
everyone call for tomlins head in the first half howd you like those 2nd half coaching adjustments
if the steelers score 28 points we win lol 28 in 3 straight
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
undefeated
it was so nice having a good secondary for 1 year
how edmunds doesnt get absolutely grilled every week in film is beyond me
our secondary has seriously regressed
btw that was terrible clock management as always
nelson bad in coverage minkah nonexistent hilton neutral bince why tf is he in coverage
yikes all i heard all offseason was how amazing this defense was but now they are getting lit up this week after getting lit up against a career shitty backup last week

i think this also shows that the ravens are legitlike really legit
browns and bengals winning fuck today
conner you should have caught that
hire todd haley
uemmettbutcher i dont see a houston td right there i see a sack and your  comment
i think im more mad about this game than the jesse james td call in terms of refball
texans will tire out


steelers bend bit dont break


going 30
lmao refball every week its unbelievable
we seem to always put linebackers on fast receivers just steelers things
who knew our fire everyone game would come in week 3
i know this thread is like this every week but a lot of you need to find a new team to watch every time the steelers dont play perfectly its the end of the world foh with that
its not an overreaction to question our secondary at this point
remember when steven nelson was good last year i do dude gets touched up so often now
nelson has been getting burnt all year what happened to him
running like hes trying to get to the front of the cafeteria line
that was obviously a first down its actually rigged if it doesnt get overturned
good play by bush not biting on that fake
good shit edmunds
i thought our team was gonna give up 7 on every drive thats what the gamethread led me to believe
what a waste of a 2nd down
i cant fucking stand fitchner tired of these shit playcalls couldnt design a good td drive if all of our lives depended on it
it would be nice if minkah would hit someone instead of just waiting with his arms out
baker mayfield is so annoying
thats what im talking about the reports of the steelers demise were greatly exaggerated
ahhh yes another day another game where im uncertain if my young 29 year old heart can take the steeler suspense here we go
turn down for watt
does anybody know if decastro is back
i have bears and falcons instead of our game fuck fuck fuck
here we go whos ready to be stressed for 3 hours
we should start calling our defense womens pants because they dont have pockets
what an effort juju
nice effort 19
juju a beast
juju the fucking acrobat
im a more cynical steeler fan and give juju shit but hes a different player this year whether hes just amped up or he just phoned it in last year i dont know but if he keeps playing like he is its going to be a hard decision for contracts
there u go conner
holy shit play action
offensive like is giving conner some running room hoping himand the ground game do well today
good catch vance
still better than a bubble screen
weve showed em like 10 different things this drive
shit play call cmon man
not a bad opening drive obviously could have been better if they capped it off with a touchdown
michael irvin is clearly high during the pregame
samuels didnt even get close

well at least bosgod will be fed
very obvious how much we were missing decastro with that drive
i love chris boswell
benny snell is in the doghouse tough scene for those saying snell should be the starter after week one
i refuse to believe fichtner called that whole drive
points are points but bad call on the run with samuels
i wont put too much stock in the first 8 mins or so of the game both teams are still figuring each other out and adapting to the feel and flow

lets get another 3 and out and a solid 2nd drive and ill feel better about the momentum

we kinda need to punched in the mouth first before waking up
what ever happened to the nfl streams sub game isnt on in my market
first time they mentioned all the watts playing
every week i forget about fichtner and every sunday im painfully reminded
nelson what is you doin
vince covering cooks deep
well that was embarrassing
why is bince on cooks
fuck butler
bleh hilton should have had that
deshaun coming out knowing hes got something to prove today
how can our secondary suck this much as soon as our blitz doesnt work and the ball leaves qbs hand you know its a completion
typically slow defensive start no matter how good our defense they usually look bad the first drive last drive before the end of the half and late 3rd quarter
need minkah to stop sleeping back there and get involved
now this is the usual first drive run run pass offense
4 man rush 3 get the qb
play calling from first drive to second drive is so different
run run pass will never work
why do we go run run pass when our running backs cant run
ahhhh the ol run run pass punt you hate to see it
60 straight game with a sack
hilton is a monster against bubble screens
defense bounced right the fuck back

now do the same thing offense do it do it
3 weeks in a row where johnson fucks up on a punt return
let that ball go dionte what the hell
sounds bad but hopefully its his nuts and not his groin
get dj outta the gd pr spot
he knew he fucked up as soon as he called for that fair catch i dont think he knew where he was on the field
dj needs to develop some game awareness
diontae is a good player with some bad decisions
did that look like a groin issue or a hit to the balls hoping nothing serious
hey a benny snell sighting at least he didnt fumble
might as well punt on third down so we do one thing houston isnt expecting besides fair catch at the 4 yard line
wow our offense is still rusty you hate to see it in your own red zone yikes
that offensive series was fucking ridiculous
binceda man
at least bince williams is playing his heart out
well hey at least it wasnt run run pass lol run pass pass new era
are they even aware theres a game today
man go back to steeler fucking football on offense iformation with watt leading connersnell and use both tes in the pass game look at the strong offensive teams using 2 tes theyre lethal and we have ebron who can be a monster this play calling is holding ben back
when our defense produces more yards than our offense yet again
ince playing like a man possessed
vince looks scary as fuck so far this season
fichtner lets run it

ben 60 yard bomb to a receiver 40 yards downfield
i wouldve liked trying a slant 2 straight plays
that 2nd down play looking like pi to me

after last week we are owed a few

ben overthrowing everything by 20 yards tho
this offense is our weak point cant beat good teams with a bad offense idc how good the defense is
you know i am starting to wonder if our secondary scheming is not all that good over the years i have placed the blame on lack of talentbut now we have haden fitzpatrick and nelsonand hilton as our nickel

i know some people love to blame edwards for everything on down to climate changebut something bigger than that just doesnt seem right
lots of game left to play that first drive was great im fully confident we can recreate that unfortunately were losing the field advantage game but i foresee a turnover coming in the next quarter secondary got burnt on the td drive but im not overly worried as long as they communicate and adapt well be fine
i feel like we lost half our secondary
are we about to get embarrassed
watching bill belicheck eat a subway sandwich on a strip mall bench is jarring
wide open wtf are they doing
of course hes wide the fuck open
pretty obvious hold on tj there
watson is gonna have 40 passes for 400 yards at this rate
tj is blatantly being held
dude that tackle is holding tj so slickly i hate it
so basically if they pass were fucked
lamar jackson takes that for 50 yards

shit
well this is getting ugly fast

were in trouble boys
ok lets try this thing where we complete some passes and score a touchdown
zone is getting torched need a td bad on the next drive
mfw they had us ranked like the 7th best team lol
so first quality qb we play against and defense looks like utter crap
offense looked bad all season thus far

its disappointing to see considering kc 3420 and bal 3316 handled hou easily
i guess they dont call holding anymore

better to start adjusting now than when they inexplicably stop calling holding in the playoffs like they do every year
incredible how badly this secondary has regressed
lmao this holding
we actually suck dont we
why does our pass defense look so much worse than last year
come on guys us dolphins fans are rooting for yall hard
please god let the steelers get at least 1 td
good run run run our top two backs came in averaging somewhere around 5 yards per carry and we have an explosive young guy to complement them lets run rush rush rush
if we settle for a fg i will be so angry
james down at first contact conner
god ebron looks like hes about to drop everything he does catch lmao
look at ben with the block
sneak it cowards
ben oline master
this play calling is so good when were actually playing to win
we are perennially bad at short yardage runs
i swear if we dont get 7 here
bens feeling pretty good if hes out there throwing lead blocks
if there was ever a time to run run pass
just run it with conner
ebrooooon
yessssss

fuck your flag
there it is fuck you refs
ebron
there we go ebron
not watching a stream today but apparently what im watching is still behind rip i guess cbs all access is still technically a stream
ok can we calm down now
we really needed that hell yeah
that catch has some santonio holmes sb43 vibes
that was pretty hot ngl
let the big dog eat
e squared
what a fucking pass and catch thats huge
did he try to kick ebron
ebron haters suck it
get lamar off of my tv
lets get the fucking ball back for a quick score before the half
secondary needs to bulk up now
just when i think you couldnt get any dumber you go and call a play like that and totally redeem yourself
needed some time to put offense together now if the secondary isnt exploitable
nice long drive gave our d a chance to catch there breath and do some game planning to incoming
i hate being on the west coast i just want to watch my boys
way to punish the scramble
literally every time we blitz 5 it works
a demon possessed me as i yelled the words get him

yay defense keep doing it like that
time for a claypool big play
were going to get to see 2 minute ben
did johnson lose his pr job after that fair catch at the four
conner is just not explosive man great story and i love the guy but im tired of watching him run
what is this run run pass 2 min offense
2 minute warning this is where ben shines
we have got to stop doing the same fucking run run pass shit
bring willie parker out of retirement i stg i cant bear to watch us run it
conner just trying to run into people with his back because of all those back workouts
dj and d watt injured
this is the ben effect right here baby
head injury for diontae
ebron getting his hands dirty this week i like it
enjoying this drive
occasionally screen pass to conner has been working pretty well reminds me of bell days a bit
oh that was fast lmfao
juju styling on these fools
how do you blow a coverage that bad
boom shacka lacka nice fucking pocket protection that was a big blitz
ben to juju for the tdmusic to my ears
but the game is overrr guys
best drive of the season that was so satisfying to watch holy shit
chefs kiss
theres no way this is happening without ben god how we all missed him lol
voodoo mama juju
and just like that were back on top and we get the ball back after the half oh ye of little faith
great fucking drive damn i love juju man i hope he stays with us
that is called wide ass open
ok now secondary please stop their 2minute drill before the half
juju lets fucking gooo
lets just run no huddle for the second half
we were down by 11 for about two minutes during that time half this sub were about ready to become ravens fans
fire gmjr
jujuuuuuuuu
defense needs to force a stop here this is huge now
the offense needs to keep this up i hate when they get a lead and start to play conservative pedal to the metal and crush them lets goooooo
so your kids are misbehaving and the solution is buy a bigger house

what kind of fucked up message you sending rocket mortgage
holy wide open even juju was surprised by the looks of it
gotta worry we handed them the ball back with too much time left on the clock
wish we ate up more clock on that last drive knew houston would drive up the field here
nfl sunday football now with 100 more commercials
yeah just play soft zone
1717 is worst case scenario 2117 cannot be an option
watson carves up zone d left and right

butler lets keep running zone
hello defense
predictable
you have got to be kidding me
i thought this was supposed to be the best defense lol
are you fucking kidding me
walking all over our secondary
bring a blitzer please
yoooo that made me sad
our secondary literally has no discipline
wow looks like its gonna be a shootout
nelson didnt even fucking try
what happened to our secondary ugh
this 2018 all over again
secondary is imposter
nelson having a tough start to the year
50 second drive pathetic
wow we are getting torched
nelson is shit
this defense is boggling sometimes
unbelievable defense looked like they were ready for half time
you would score 100 points against us if you ran a quick pass every play
havent heard shit from heyward or tuitt once this game not good enough to beat watson
gotta run a play there see if getting into fg range is possible they had two tos thats frustrating
im reading on twitter tj watt went into the locker room holding his arm and may be hurt anyone see info on this
this secondary has to answer our questions what has happened to them
need some turnovers baby
im more worried about nelson over minkah
i know defenses are at a disadvantage because of the no contact rules and having ahard time practicing but this cant be considered acceptable to this team
butler probably made zero adjustments during the break keep playing hard zone will work eventually
i have to get the damn i hate 26 out of my head after barron last year mcfarland looks nice
we also arent gonna kick a field goal at mid fieldso thats different
ben deep ball pls thats the third or fourth tough miss today
thats a fucking first down
bens going to give me a heart attack
hey guys i know the first and second long ball didnt work but what about third long ball surely thatll work
nice run ben
fast ben roethlisburger
x200b

first down
good challange
ben with the stiffy
he made that shit come on
its not often you win a spot challenge but they should get this one hes over the marker
how do you fuck up that spot by a whole damn yard when youre right there
benjamin hot rod todd roethlisberger
ben got it whether or not the refs recognize is a coin flip imo
fucking refs
wtf
bullshit
even gene said it was a first
horrible call
ko your local ref
so frustrated with the producers they keep cutting away from the end of the play before they show us where the officials are spotting the ball hold your water for a couple of seconds to show us what is going on

they went to commercial for the challenge without even showing us where the ball was spotted
that is the most obvious wrong call ive ever seen
what an awful awful call
what the fuck
how
fuck you ref
the ref who reviewed that play should be fired immediately that was fucking ridiculous
claypool can act lol
absolute hose job from these refs houston holds on every fucking play offense and defense
i hate that play call
bullshit ref call on the ben stretch
karma
complete bullshit on the mark so idc
lmao that was a horrible call these refs are trash
we got bailed out hard
ball dont fucking lie assholes
i normally dont complain about the refsbut that call was bull and to the guy that got sharkeys my condolencesget some dinos son
the referees are fixing the mistake on the challenge
well these receivers are not helping ben
oh come on fucking catch that ball
al wtf dumb
ben kinda inaccurate today
is diontae hurt
lets put something together boys we need it
drop drop drop
can somebody please catch
catch the ball
the fuck was that play call
god av is terrible
long painful failed drive
what a fucking awful drive
catch the fucking ball
thankfully box is not box from 2018 something to be happy about
a clock has better hands
super happy about steelers special teams
guys quit saying ben should throw it less hard lol its the nfl these guys should catch these passes
anyone else see mccloud just eat a hit that would have taken most players out of the game
god damn mccloud took a fucking hit and took off like a fox in a arwing
not used to special teams clicking especially kickoff coverage
i think mccloud may become the featured punt returner
ok let the texans do that thing where they blow the game
ray ray is pretty good at this kickpunt return thing
well fuck just got embarassed on that blocking assignment
running the ball on 2nd and 19 you hate to see it
a draw on 2nd and 19 on your own 20 great call what a pioneer
why do you run on 2nd and 19
who thoughtthe run was the right call
running on 2nd and 19 is chicken shit
starting to think they may be better off with feiler at rt and dotson at lg no disrespect to chuks more about feiler struggling at g
need to protect your first ballot hall of famer better
i swear our offense is best when its no huddle
ben being injured would be soo steelers lol
we rely way too much on defense

lets get another stop boys
where is dupree today
we finally start with great field position lets take advantage
outstanding field position alright now lets do something with it
gotta be kidding me we needed a td
wtf i didnt know you can grab arms now
we gotta get juju involved
i guess you can just pin the receivers arms now
missed pi
holy pi batman
i would like an interception or a fumble please and thank you
fuck these refs
splish splash our offense is playing like trash
run the ball
are we capable of guarding the middle of the field
this defense is getting abused
secondary is asshole
i feel like ive seen the same thing happen 12 times this game holy shit
3rd and long guess theyll pick this one up as well
fuck this defense today
glad the secondary is enjoying their front row seats to the game
lfg hilton been having a great game today
money mike
yessss
mike hilton
fuck yeah
theres a spark now go get it offense
yes finally
yes hilton
looks like he pulled his hammy when he jumped
praise mike hilton lol
fuck thought watson was out for a moment there
lucky that wasnt a late hit on tj but nice job hilton lets go get it now
watt very lucky to not get a flag there phew
lets put some points on the board offense preferably 8
mike hilton next march
if we go three and out ill be fucking livid
please offense play like our last drive in the 1half
butler has been our dc for 6 years holy shit time flies
ebron lookin good
im not sure what happened there but i liked it
i dont ever want to hear phil simms say chubby like that again
our inability to get short yardage is obnoxious
we are allergic to gaining short yardage
theres some benny snell football
his arm is too damn strong
why have one feature back when you could have conner snell samuels and mcfarland
just run for it ben youre practically the fastest man on the field
the vance truck rumbles
lets goooo
vance is fucking awesome
conner baby lets fucking go for 2
james conner muthafucka real nice block by fieler
huuuge drive
nice run for 6
oh babyyyyy
trubisky and foles is arguably worse than rudolph and hodges
feiler redemption conner looks good today
fuck yeah
lets goooo 2821
i feel like rick flair right now

wooooooooo
worried that the 2pt gets challenged
i wouldnt hate a pick 6 right here
thats what happens when tj watt isnt held
wattttt
its thirrrrrrd daaahhhn


and 26
tj watt is going to be worth the entire steelers organizational worth lolol
oh mama im in fear for my life from the loooong arm of the law
the defense has been looking leagues better in this 2nd half i cant tell rn if its due to adjustments or what but they look good
lots of game left and have to work the clock out and at least get 3 watson scored 3 tds in under 3 minutes in the first half
please put it away here dont be conservative
stay in bounds
back to back 100 yard rushing games seems pretty good to me
i need 16 yards from jc here
defense really stepped up in the 2nd half gotta close this one out
vance mcdonald just killed that man
field goal ends it
go for it fk em
how many fucking times are they going to waste a perfect opportunity for a playaction pass
bubble screen time
jw lets gooooo
fuck it go for it
go for it dont be a bitch
i love that play call right there
no one is saying just kick it jackass
i love the ambition
buuuuurrrrrn that clock baby
im sorry everybody just put on my 7 jersey at the start of the 4th shouldve wore it the whole game
holy shit thats scary
danny smith and a whole pack of gum in his mouth as usual lol
luckily ball didnt go through the end zone
11 is my next jersey i love this kid
chase claypool
sure hes not fumbling but hes also got like 8 yards on as many carries
couldve easily been a touchback lol but we dont live in our fears
very lucky that didnt go out through the end zone
that was lucky
30 boisss
better give it conner
fat lady is warming up in the tunnel
about to go up 30
victory formation
i was depressed half the game but not anymore
dont forget guys the game was over after 15 quarters of football
kick the fg just to score over 30
can someone explain to me why the clock started to run before the two minute warning without us snapping the ball
after the defense allowed that score to end the half they pitched a shutout in the 2nd you love to see it
shutout in the 2nd half
what a performance by the defense in the 2nd half

feel real good about this team atm
name a more iconic duo than the steelers starting slow in the first quarter and sometimes the entire first half
what is like 83 chance to make the playoffs if you go 30
3 and fucking 0 baby
lmfaooo were gonna get blown out by the 02 texans boys
i see this place hasnt forgotten how to overreact
i cant fucking stand villanueva man talk about somebody who doesnt at all deserve the mark of 2x pro bowler thanks for your service but youre not good
secondary continues to be garbage
vince on cooks why
williams on brandin cook nice

we need a coverage linebacker asap
defense what the fuck was that
sounds like giving advice to my first girlfriend i got frisky with dont do anything cute just touch my balls the conventional way and focus on the basics
touch down bong hit
lol at all you fucking nerds saying the game was over in the first quarter
at least try nelson you know jump or do something defensive
its hard to say you couldnt see this coming jones and driskel threw for 530 yards on us and they picked us apart now watson has 200 yards in a half the secondary regressed so much
so if we lose tj this game just got a lot tougher
how many people want to bet we trot out the same defensive scheme at the half even though its clear to a blind man that it aint working
i dont think minkah has made a play so far this season hes due for a game changing play
good


stop


d
good job breaking down so there was nowhere to go with the ball after the catch wait for help to rally and make the sure stop
conner runs like he thinks hes leveon
i fucking cant stand this playcalling losing the fucking game and playing like cowards
were playing against the desperate texans the sportsbooks and the refs today this was always going to suck but fucking hell
oh shit their oc remembered he can pass on us
dont worry fichtner can mess up this momentum switch too
i cannot with these play calls stop with the fucking horizontal shit
if we end up going 30 after this gamecan people lay off the armchair general managing just a little
go for the touchdown please
gonna check post histories to see how many of you said it was over
man you guys are insufferable lmao
ben is the man though some of you dipshits need to recognize that
you can tell randy sits when pees because he runs it on 2nd and 19
think i wouldve went for that maybe thats why im not the coach
why hand off to our passing back when we need 3 yards
i think the texans just want this one more today
im scared we gave houston too much time
are you fucking kidding me

show the fuck up secondary
did they really just shit on us in 50 seconds
nelson is becoming a liability
well i have no way to watch the game but it sounds like this once great defense has fallen apart if you ask me its totally a coaching issue how you go from amazing to bad this fast without it being on the coaches is beyond me theyve let the players get lazy and slow
i came in here looking to vent about the secondary a little bit but jeez the bridge jumping going on in here is insane
catch the fucking ball
3 n out baby lets go
its either a 3 and out or td drive for the d
ray ray a fucking statue
why run it up the middle on 2nd and 19
that punt sucked ass
i need about 4 packs of cigarettes and 2 30 racks after this game
we need 7 here with a conversion no fg boys
look i just want the win but for fantasy purposes id love to see another conner6 here rolled him and juju today
honestly the defense looks like its regressed a bit from last year hopefully they pull it together as the season progresses
losing to bill obrien

lol
id rather have casper the friendly ghost out there than minkah what the hell happened to him
one thing to all americans here i get it you guys want your guns all good you guys dont want free healthcare all good

but how the fuck do you guys accept this much commercials during the game
here we fucking go
anybody else plays the game audio on two sets of speakers to get that bar vibe in the home
may the best watts win
ahh yes here we are another week of overreactions and crazy takes im ready baby
lets go baby

who ride
shoutout to my fellow east coast noontime drunks and even bigger shoutout to my west coast brethren pounding those bloody marys lets get this w boys
whos ready for some steeler football
its time for egregious overreactions terrible playcalling and even worse penalties on todays viewing of the national football league
expecting high wattage i quit im going back to bed
drink every time you hear watt or brother
did houston just forget about tj on that first play
iron mikewe love you
holy shit juju lets go
holy fucking shit juju
holy shit what a play juju
we have to keep juju holy fuck
did juju just backflip for a first
juju been playing like a te this season
we didnt go run run pass in that first drive
holy shit you love to see that effort from juju especially with a bum wheel
mcfarland sighting
looking good so far eating the clock up
who tf is calling these plays aint no way this is randy
why run with samuels in there
bosgod
is jj playing
so tired of seeing samuels in the backfield
honestly its okay with the fg liked the look the offense has
we are really stupid when it comes to personnel
finally got a stream going
i love how half the people are shitting on the play calling and the other half are impressed that randy called that drive it was a bad third down call but come on guys that was improvement
id watch attenborough narrate a documentary about paint drying
what has danny smith been doing bruh out st is good this year
nelson was like 4 yards behind him yikes
can someone pm me a way to watch the game rnfl streams is gone please help im not in the coverage area

edit thanks everyone
steven nelson is worrying me hopefully last year wasnt a fluke
vince williams on brandon cooks
need to pressure send an extra rusher
vince williams covering a wr brilliant keith butler
cover the middle of the fucking field
man coverage is not working
williams is gonna get torched
bill o brian is stupid enough to just run ball so i have hope
and this is why you dont settle for field goals
keith butler is such a dog shit nfl coach houston had two td plays exposing williams and hilton in coverage the only two guys who get attacked through the air get them off the field in passing downs
i

hate


cover


one


please stop


thank you
damn we did everything that drive except stop watson from carving us up like swiss cheese
secondary has left a lot to be desired especially compared to last year nelson doesnt look like the same player havent heard minkahs name called much i think maybe last year was just some guys having the best year of their careers too bad they cant keep playing like that
i dont have a good feeling about this game rn
run run pass defense is predictable and offense is even more so
we cant rush on the worst run d in the league
lol ugh 2 obvious runs and pass such a bold strategy
run run pass punt jump off a bridge into the allegheny river
run run pass strikes again
hate all these running plays when our rb is james conner
well shit offense needs to wake the fuck up

would love to see randy open up the playbook a little
claypool took on two blockers the whole way down the field and still got deep enough to force that return back inside

guy impresses me every time he steps on the field
bince
hate all these running plays when our rb is james conner
randy the playbook isnt a fucking dennys menu you cant just order the same shit every day for fucks sake try something else for once you bastard
roethlisbergers brain must be pure mush at this point like its kind of amazing that he can even walk and chew gum at the same time much less ply football
now thats our steelers defense lets go
there you go hilton you gotta spend all day making up for the td but thats a great start
there we go d
dont fucking fair catch that
if werent not getting to the qb then theyre hitting guys wide open 1020 yards downfield also why the fuck would you fair catch inside the 5
why fair catch at the 4 yard line let it fucking bounce
why the hell would you fair catch that
danny smith football baby its never mike tomlins fault for employing incompetent coordinators
plant your heels at the ten dont go backwards bud
why would you fair catch that
wow just let that punt go instead of fair catching
brain fart shouldve let it bounce
godamnit diontae
you know what this is some damn good tackling this year it really is showing
the question is why
mccloud has been looking great back there anyway
diontae is not long for punt return duty
why would you fair catch on the 4 dionte
let it go diontae what the fuck
wtf why didnt he let it bounce into the endzone
alright ive never played this sport and i think even i would have been smart enough to let that bounce
i can probably explain that but its still super shitty

he assumed with that booming low flying punt that the punter outkicked the coverage at the last second he looked down and saw that our outside contain was literally non existent and both gunners were right in front of him so he instinctively fair caught it

it sucks it makes sense experience will be make that better im guessing danny smith gives him the greenlight inside the 10 if he likes what he sees maybe he shouldnt
ben just calling a timeout so he can call his own plays
at least ben can still throw deep
jesus go back to the dump off passes
what are these play calls
lmao wtf was that
what the fuck is happening
more claypool please
ah classic goal line bomb
why take double coberage when the checkdown has enough room to run
a 10 yard first down is just as good ben
holy shit ebron was wide open underneath
ben we get it you still have a cannon now settle down and play winning football
im hoping this is just a slow start
vincent
bince baby
holy shit vince
what shitty field position yikes
ouch down population you johnson
turnover this drive calling it
bince and hilton show boys
big vince baby
bince billiams thank you
my cousin vinny again with the sequel tackle for a loss
ben is trying to hit covid with the long ball
our secondary is ass
we didnt even blitz and he was wide open
secondary needs to tighten the fuck up
soft as baby shit zone secondary
our secondary has been spotty this year need to tighten it up
keep running houston its the only we we can stop the ball right now
why would you even try to run against us lmao
watt getting held again
just remember last week the defense was on fire all of the first half and then came out flat theres still plenty of time in this game be patient the second half could be the complete opposite
how bad is this secondary its reminding me of 2018 season
uhh holding
will there ever be a holding call for tj
holy fuck are they not calling holding at all
so far a typical slow steeler start hang in there fans plenty of game left to go
if youre the texans why even stop passing
thats a killer to give up the first down there
great job bush perfect way to read the tes eyes and play the ball
holy shit that was so sad our guys ran into each other lmao
somebody name one bright spot from this game so far please
this is disgusting
our pass coverage is just bad this year i thought we fixed the problem from several years ago
what a shit show lmao
i wish sometimes we had a mobile qb or even a secondary why does texas even try to run
im not certain i understand what ive seen so far any film guys able to break it down for me seems to me like we have decided we are not interested in winning this one
i know its early but we look really bad
were losing right now but id much rather this team play than whatever that abomination was last season that was such a dark time
our coordinators are an absolute joke
playing bad in every conceivable way
stop playing zone
we need to run run run this next drive and go three and out
hard to win when youre fighting two teams can tj get a single holding call
so is our defense not as good as everyone advertised
backups in on the right side wormley and highsmith and they just run at them

good time to have them in
sigh
so many people who dont know shit about football saying minkah is bad its not minkah its the fucking scheme
defensive backs need to step up theyre getting torched maybe we need to get out of zone watsons just picking us apart
yep already like this kid
i see you mcfarland
wow he is f a s t
i liked that mcfarland keep doing that
oh shit yall have mcfarland he was an animal in college
daddy mcdonald
i could really go for a vance macdonald shadowrealm stiff arm today
shit i think even buffalo would smoke us at this point
i love ebron dudes a huge target
ben blocking
i wish we had another hefty back for plays like that can i have fast big and can catch can i just have it all
ben getting in there with the cut block lol love it
you see this we dont need the big passes keep it short and simple and we drive easily
johnson knocked the wind out of himself with that hit
thought snell had it jeez
need a score here
ben out here throwing blocks
looked like mcdonald was supposed to release

yessir
ebron
why didnt vance run open its like he was just standing there
that was a gutsy call
wow sick catch
rollercoaster of emotion drive there
clutch
ebron is balling out today lets go
yep that was grounding
ebron bout to go off lets gooooo
back in it bois
whoever said ebron looks like hes made out of clay obviously doesnt know chiseled marble
phew alright come on defense
defense give me an int now i want the lead
nice to finally have a te that produces again mcdonald went totally quiet not too long after that iconic stiff arm
nice catch
quick three and out
lets go d
lol he tried to kick him or something
ball dont lie
dont fuck it up d we need you to hold them to 3 out

or a pick 6 id definitely take a pick 6
ebron is one physical loon red zone maniac knows how to make the space
what was that kick off saved by allen
more steelers in the back field than down field
dj hurt
big d stop
that was a delay of game to me but ill take it
3 out here we go
with how often ray ray has fumbled prs im not any more confident with him back there
is nfl sunday ticket worth it i live in philly and finding a stream that doesnt have a lot of cancerous ads that works on my fire stick is absolutely rage inducing
god damn i wish we had a punter like that
if we had a good punter our special teams would be insane
when your defensive line is as good as ours is there will just be less holding calls its be 3rd and 30 for houston every time
noooo derrick
derek noooooo
why the fuck are we running the clock out
b b b butrun run pass why arent we punting waaaahh
1714 come on ill do anything
conner as our 7th string reciever
good juju
hell fuckin yeah juju
that is how we play
ju mf ju
fuck yeah thats what we like to see lol i thought he was about to step out of bounds there
jujuuuuuuuuuuu
just think yall were super tripping ten mins ago
we went 7 plays for 63 yards in a minute without using a single timeout or a pass traveling more than 8 yards
haha juju wide open he walked to the end zone
where are the naysayers
lol doesnt get easier than that
lets get a big defensive play now
i cant believe i have to miss this game
bd strip sack inbound
okay if we stop them we need to use our timeouts and try to get the ball back lets go defense
jujus on that beat in the endzone
wide open again
i cant believe we are back to having a soft defense last years defense was so fun to watch why cant we have both a good offense and defense at the same time
our defense needs to fucking nut up here
hes targeting hilton every time great in the flat terrible in the secondary
pick incoming
tuitt seems off this yeari wonder if the injuries are starting to take their toll
lmfao i dont even know what to say
garbage
jesusfuckingchrist
nelson is trash
lmao sick
hello defence are you there
what the fuck was that
tj not on the field that last playoh man pls let him be ok
ate our fucking lunch of that drive damn
nelson pushed him up to get the ball lmao
nelson has been getting destroyed this game
vietnam flashbacks with the secondary this year
watson on pace for 400 yards passing
21 first half points given up and no given turnovers
lets watch steelers tape to build confidence

thats how shit our zone d is
situational awareness is something the steelers will never be good at working the sidelines on their last drive was completely unnecessary and led to 7 houston points when your defense is sucking you have to at least try to help them
i feel like yall forget how stressful these steelers games can be
watson is just really good at escaping the pressure making our pass rusher less effective which is the key part to secondary performance this makes me worried about the ravens game
prevent defense prevents the steelers from winning the game
oh man mccloud is fun to watch more so than switzer was anyway
tomlin and his aviators such an iconic duo
i love that theyre actually using macfarland this game
would have been messy not to get that
connor needs to be the short yardage back everytime imo samuels and mcfarland both have failed to convert on 3rd and 1 today
thats my qb
steelers injury update wr diontae johnson possible concussion fb derek watt hamstring have been downgraded to out for todays game
what a stud
yes ben
did anyone elses heart stop when saw that white jersey coming to meet him at the first down marker
thats a first down
dont pull a hammy there ben
easy challenge
cant see his knee when it goes down is that good or bad for us
dont know about that knee looked down but hard to tell where the ball was when he went down
mobile qb started with ben to the right
wow thats horrible
refs have been fucking us all season
how the mother fuck does that stand end yourself
what the fuck he got that with the extension
why the fuck do we have to play every game against 2 teams
thats pure bias
that is one of the worst calls i have ever seen in a review
steelers vs refs

edit nvm
the ol joe flacco strat
lol always terrible calls against us
is there some kind of conspiracy against tomlin on reviews
holy shit deep on a 4 and 1 bailed out refs knew they fucked up
so are the rules just if its not a first down fuck you and your challenge
make up call
shut the fuck up thats not on claypool
what kind of pass is that
we finally got a bullshit call holy fuck
my god do these refs fucking suck like cool it benefits us but make a right call every once in a while would you
are they just throwing flags to adjust for their shit calls
ok a bad call makes up for a bad call
well ill take a dpi to bail us out of that and set us up with good field position hopefully we get in the endzone this time
make up call
two terrible calls by the refs
4th and 1 easy pass to an open ebron no fucking sling it 30 yards
these refs are fucking assssssss
terrible call lol ill take it
there we go the equalizer penalty fuckers
i think i would have declined that
the drops omg they want to lose
dammit jw
catch the goddamn ball
james didnt even close his fingers to catch that lol that was so weird
gotta catch that conner
catchhhh theeee fuckingggg ballllll
this offense cant get out of its own way for fucks sake
at least a nice long drive like that wears down the defense
deshaun watson gonna throw a pick here after running around for 5 minutes
why are our receivers and backs not named juju dunking their hands in grease before games
edmundsssss
i want a watt thread too d
great work d
edmunds does never let anyone juke him
ray ray
i love ray ray
rayray can runrun
wow excluding djs return td last year ray ray looks like our best punt returner in a while
edmunds all you negative nancys that kind of benddontbreak open field tackling is exactly why we drafted him
ray ray
mccloud looking like dri archer should have been
i dont understand houston trying the run this often when theyve had so much more success through the air ill take it though
really love how mccloud runs it

hope we can settle on him being our returner so we can stop with the switzer nonsense
that guy plays football
i need someone to upload that ray ray punt return later
you know i think mccloud is going to be a significant transaction he seems to be one of those guys who could take it to the house any time

and it has more to do with what i have seen thus far than this last good punt return theres a certain skill that kickpunt returners haveand that is that they improve on the fly they dont think they catch and go
sick blocking
youre fucking kidding me why on gods green earth would you call a draw play there
2nd 19 run ok that was dumb
with mccloud on the team we need to capitalize on the potential for star fox memes
wasted drive
horrendous play call
yep running on 2nd and 19 will work eventually s
how about some hurry up offense
colquitt fuckin stinks
can we get a sack
need more out of watt and need less holding out of their right tackle
sack
get tuitt
yes
do it tuitt
that was a great sack
dupree has been extra quiet today
ill say it for the tenth time why would you run the ball against us
do it tuit
do it tuitt
good job d can we pleeaaaase win this game its right in our grasp
back to back three and outs
this is great field position we have to get a td here
if we do not get any points on this series then there has to be a curse on this team like we arent allowed to have good offense and good defense at the same time
how many sacks is that now in this game
i feel like that spot was still like 5 yards back
lets start a twitter campaign reevaluate randy

and just flood tomlins account
great follow up drive for the d excellent 3rd quarter after a dismal 1st half hopefully they can keep it up for one more quarter
they too scared to punt to ray ray
joe burrow aka the cincinnati punching bag
damn good throw good attempt
fucking all over him what the fuck
got to love being gifted great field position and then pissing it away
definitely holding lol
okay offense lets wake up on the next drive shall we
nice stop rook
need a turnover here
fuck that was our chance
middle of the field is always fucking open with these guys
was he not very close to the los
heyward has been a tip machine
jesus guys
third downs suck
third and long is our kryptonite
what the fuck is with this secondary
cooks was already in the fetal position before watt hit him
of fucking course its edmunds
there ya go tj
edmunds runs past two texans receivers to try to spy watson when he still would have needed about 12 yards for the first
yes hilton
hilton is such a stud
hilton
thank you hilton
finally the defense did something
hilton
lets fucking go
hilton
there it is
lets go that was important now stop calling bullshit randy
now lets throw the ball
same guy everyone was trashing earlier
i take back my comment about our secondary being assman i missed that feeling of a pick
now can we fucking capitalize
my fav part of that pick is they just talked about watsons ability to extend plays and then he extends the play into a pick lol
did i just completely black out when did first down happen
there tes are getting a lot of looks
alright ebron more of that my man
fucking love decastro pulling
im ready for a claypool play
conner looks in pain ugh lol not again
some defensive hands to the face easily called there on our lead blocker but no flag
ill fucking do it again meme
defense doing everything they can to give the offense opportunities we need to capitalize on these
weve never had a bubble screen work
the one time it makes sense to run run pass and they dont
aside from the 1 run when connor lost his shoe is samuels basically been removed from the gameplan i cant even recall him last week
ben missing deep a lot today
ebron giving me flashes of good ol heeeeath
im getting stressed
i get so fired up whenever vance runs people over
vance
our tes putting in work
ben needs some reps to get used to his newly rebuilt arm on the long balls
atleast vance has shown up to play today
big vance
give me a fat td daddy ben
vance have a dip in
conner has been good today in my opinion
we need a td i know our defense has pulled it together but i still dont trust them to keep the texans out of at least fg range
go for 2
woooooo
lets goooooooooooo
beautiful atta boy jc
boy connor looks really fresh and rested right now workhorse back showing his talent in these type of situations and a fucking touchdown
this is gonna need to be a td imo watsons too good to shut him down the entire half
fuck yeah that was a great drive
offensive line is getting fucking gassed on these long ass drives
wow we converted
lfg
juujuuu
lfg
i love the steelers god damnit
sharp drive there wave the terrible towel
that ref wanted to call it incomplete
alright we just need to hold them now and its in the bag
juju is just a tank
looks like houstons defense is getting tired
thats what happens when hes not being held
why must my butt cheeks always be clenched when i watch my steelers
tj is dominating watt bowl
watch me from the sidelines big bro imma hurt your qb tj watt
our watt is best watt
feasting
web have just over 32 minutes of possession
big time tj fuck yeah thats five sacks so far for the team
sign tj watt and sign him now
im making a subreddit dedicated to announcers that instantly look idiotic
houston has collapsed over the last 10 minutes
do not let them pick this up got em on their heels
3rd down and half the distance to the parking lot dont give them a penalty for the 1st please
ray ray take it to the house and end this
finish them
our running backs were basically the three musketeer today
come on boys a long drive ending in points my heart will thank you
can we get a big play for minkah as an extra cherry on top of this game he needs one
james connor for 40 yards rushing this drive please
watt you beautiful motherfucker
why did he run out of bounds there
im fine with running if it looks like that
that man went flying
it seems like every time the color guy says something nice about houston they give up a big play lol
not this conservative bs
end it
goforit
first dahn
i love this team
thats a great call lets go
herm edwards voice hello you play to win the game be aggressive
totally thought they were going for the offside houston thought so too lol
i love the yugeeeee balls on tomlin
you love to see it
hell save the children but not the texan children
lol wtf
aw hell yeah reporting eligible in here
run it again boz boots it go to 30
boswell looks like a weirdo just wanted to get that out there
better to have died a small child than fumble the football

the man aint wrong
big clay
bro mapletron
fumble out the back of the end zonetouchback
damn that ref psyched me out there thought he was bringing his arms up
we almost went a full game without a fumble
heart attack averted for another week
big playpool
fuck grimble
chase claypool is a fucking monster
claypool da gawd
ball game
man i love watching mister claypool
3 knees baby nothing better
lot of people would like some more fantasy points here but im pretty sure this is gonna be 3 kneel downs
these sonic commercials are not as funny as they used to be
hell yes boys
defense came out of the half hard i love to see it
im proud of how he came back the second half complete shut out
fuck ya
look you whiny yinzers the sky is still up there
you guys are gonna talk all this shit now but then turn right around when the steelers do good
around the league

this playing desperate has to stop everyone needs to calm down a little bit and focus
no call still shouldve caught that thi
this secondary is so bad
hilton played that very horribly but was still inches from breaking it up

relax its one drive and its the first drive where theyve had an entire week to scheme that up bob typically has a great opening script but struggles afterwards

i know its so fun to give up 8 minutes in but give it time
ah theres the run run pass we love
hate all these running plays when our rb is james conner
johnson with the mental error incoming big play for him to rollercoaster our emotions
ben in a nutshell
a slow start for the offense and half of you guys have declared it the worst offense youve seen and the year is over
texans have a helluva punter
our secondary is absolutely atrocious
good lord this defense makes me so angry im having flashbacks of cockrell and the boys from back in the day
wowi really wish the offense tried something there
keith butler is just as bad as fichnter
jesus christ what is that the 5th drop today
why check down on long 3rd and goal
great drive to be stopped by 2 drops smh
is ben really throwing the ball that hard or can no one catch right now
i understand this is only game 3 but this team is a mess right now they gotta do better than this if they hope to go somewhere this season
everyone thats shitting on ben remember where we were last year without him
did fitchner just switch to houstons team 3 rb play calls in a row
colquitt isworse than berry
texans outta gas its all 3 n out from here for watson


time to put the squeeze on
thats why you dont fucking run
av cant hold a block to save his life my goodness
pi
hire todd haley

we will not settle for 2 yard drives anymore
steelers need a peanut punch training camp
i am feelingnot great
you guys know watson is really good and its almost impossible for a defense to cover for like 5 seconds right hes going to make some plays fucking relax
that look of horror on johnsons face realizing tj is completely unblocked
im
horny
omg
punch this in and seal it none of the kneeling shit
321 30
why has mike hilton been better than minkah fitzpatrick all season
woof elite defense my ass we did not look good that drive
we cannot be considered an elite defense this point into the season
these refs are ass lol we probably shouldve got a personal foul there
i say it every year but it blows me away every year how toxic this sub can be on gameday
blame the rooneys and management for this shit they refused to hire a better defensive coordinator with the idea being its the players fault they suck we just need better players

well the defense is littered with 1 and 2 round picks yet they still get embarrassed at will and no one is even close to the ball

keith butler needs to go period
hey its ok to say ben isnt having a good game because hes not its not the play calling its not the receivers ben is missing open guys throwing behind receivers and forced two passes into claypool last drive
people calm the fuck down
maybe dont 0ut vince on brandin cooks
bince on a 43 brandin cooks lmao
you know its a good day when randall corn on the cobb burns us for a td
damn hilton looked like a bitch there
would be nice to see minkah show up at some point
not ideal tbh bunch already said it but run run pass aint gonna cut it lol

next on offense reverse to johnson for a loss bubble screen for no gain connor runs for 4yds punt

if this happens im turning off the game
i swear this team has the iq of a first time pee wee football player
farmers trying to low key tell you theyll get you off on manslaughter charges if you stick with them long enough
how can our offense possibly keep up with ravens
this offense is the dumbest shit ive ever seenrun a fucking slant pick play out curl fucking anything other than all go routes
goddamn vince tell us how you really feel
this defense is a joke but after that deep shot into double coverage on 3rd and 6 i had a feeling it was gonna go this way
how the fuck you gonna let him complete that pass
so im not an expert so please correct me if im talking out of my arse but our secondary and particularly bush and minkah seem really fucking good at making plays whenever they get to the receiver as they catch the ball yeah

so why the fuck do we play zone coverage and let them fucking walk into ten yards of space
intentional grounding has to be the stupidest penalty of all time arent we trying to protect the qb
on that ebron td catch would you consider that a fade i am arguing with my son about what constitutes a fade pass
run run pass puke emoji
nelson lol you have got to be kidding
wow this secondary is doo doo
no pressure someone always wide open

feelsbadman
deshaun watson showing steelers fans hes arguably a top 5 qb in the league
iwas led to believe this defense was top 5
steven nelson looks exactly like artie burns man what is happening
ravens game is gonna be something
what happened to tj watt
bill is 373 when they lead at the half jesus christ
why do we continue to use prevent defense with so much time on the clock
trying to stay optimistic about this cause were only down 4 points but what the fuck happened to the d they were genuinely elite last year and now its like shades of 20152016 with this secondary
2 terrible calls in a row lol
villanueva is so trash
conner sucks ugh
oh look another mistake by 78
bosgod
ben is hitting these dudes in the hands
turnover incoming i feel it

jugs machine for washington and conner 4 star high schoolers would have caught those
i still think we win but we are playing like shit
insert some sort of switzer comment
draw on second and 19 as if were playing madden against an 8 year old
i think its time for minkah to pick 6 now
is tj hurt or just taking some plays off
i called it
run 2 yards
run 5 yards
pass thats someone drops comming up
why cant james consistently run hard like this i swear some games a gust of wind rolls through the stadium and he goes down
rather see conner back there in this situation
i wouldve loved for claypool to just go down after getting the first down but the rookie will learn
this is the most pittsburgh shit ever

no injuries 2 weeks of getting it figured out an opponent that is weak on offense and we look like we walked outta bed outside of juju back flipping for 1sts
999 of people dont understand football in this sub you do realize that one touchdown doesnt mean the season is over and that our defense is garbage
quit panicking yinz we always start slow we got this
wellwe finally face a decent team and we get exposed not surprised ig
the refs allowing deshaun to extend plays while they hold watt inches from a sack is infuriating

wake the fuck up renegades weve got a game win
hello from california lets get this win steeler nation 3
here we go steelers here we go the standard is the standard and things of that nature
watson finna get exposed
derek pancakes jj on power g and conner scores a tdcalling it now
i dont normally gamble on the steelers because they are too damn flukey but i like the 35 spread in this game i think they take it by at least 7
finally some ian eagle in my life
anybody got a stream going of the game
i benched david johnson in fantasy dont make me regret it
i really have been looking forward to this game in particular just because of what it would mean to win this
steelers now heat later lets ride
so watts going on today
i dont know why im so nervous
i worry about watson surviving the day we already broke one quarterback
good stop lets goo
who wants to keep count on how many times the watt brothers are mentioned i feel like a lot already
three and out baby
ayy no post punt commercial
juju strong af
what the fuck we didnt run it
atta way to stretch juju
wow juju
juju i love you dude
we need to keep juju please
juju a fucking beast
conner getting some yards early yes
aight conner i see you
juju with the field awareness knew where the line was and got it
we get to play with conner this week i dig it
wow he is fast
derek vs jj on that mcfarland run
james conner showing some real patience there
ben looking crisp
one damn yard
coulve been a td but ill take it offense moving well
so fucking underwhelming
we were charging down the field i think we should have went for it there
go for it

tj strong
what insightful commentary
williams on cooks
over cooked lol
jesus christ
we needed to get more pressure on that drive
the texans oline is doing a lot better than i thought they would be
alright hilton shake it off
gotta step it up steelers
man after the second half last and week and now this game our secondary really isnt that great anymore huh
imagine giving it to jaylen samuels on 3rd and 1 and expecting results great call randy
houston is desperate for a win cant underestimate the danger of a desperate team
defense needs to figure a way to defend the quick passing game well be seeing it all season
we gotta score on this possession

the one curse with being a dominant run defense is that theyre just going to throw the ball every play doable in 05 not 2020
this secondary is night and day compared to last season idk what the fuck butler changed but put it back the way it was now
to you idiots blaming minkah what the fuck are you talking about hes not even getting targeted
im fine with us taking the first quarter to figure shit out on defense and offense give up the td and thats fine just learn from it
something does seem different with the defensive scheme
if theres no pressure this game is over watson will pick them apart especially if haden continues to dog it and they keep targeting bushedmondshilton
now would be a good time to put it together in the secondary
3rd and mediumgoody

cant wait for a run play
man randy lets call some better plays for fuck sakes
bruh run run pass
beautiful
a playcalling as ususal
now we get to play from behind woohoo step the fuck up defense
its going to be one of those games
we should try a bubble screen
lets see if our defense can redeem itself
we need to get the momentum back big time
im really surprised ben hung onto that ball took a shot on the arm with only one hand on it
we cannot be scared of 4th and 1 inside the 20 bro settling for 3 is gonna haunt us if we cant figure it out on defense
bince
first quarter has not been great we better get our shit together soon
bince
the texans look like the steelers and the steelers look like the texans
me googles takeout near me

google taco bell mcdonalds wendys churchs burger king subway oliver garden
why in fucks sake did we change our offensive play calling from first to second drive it was obviously working fuck this coaching staff damn
ince
defense woke up after that last drive
thats what happens when you send extra rushers at him
ok now minkah go get that ball
hilton fuckin flying
it took us a long time to get to watson on first down

im not upset but it just feels like he has forever to throw
my cousin vinny with the sack attack
mike hilton
i fear third and long
fair catch at the 4
back to back plays for a loss thats my defense
just let it roll out
gud jahb gud jahb
jeez diontae thinks way too much on punt returns
godamnit diontae
why catch that our special teams is straight ass
does diontae smoke blunts before the game love him but that was questionable af
godamnit diontae
3 weeks in a row where johnson fucks up on a punt return
in the cock
dj what the fuck was that cmon man

the d hasnt been amazing to start they year but i think they will get better throughout the season the one thing ive been really pleased about though is tackling our tackling this year compared to years past is exponentially better
reddit is really dragging along for me
looks like ola went down there
ah yes the goal line bomb
this offense looks ill in these last 6 or so quarters like they luck into nice plays and drives
what the fuck is happening
short run deep miss deep miss this game is over
lets go back to that first drive
jesus christ why
dial it back a bit there fit ben
who is ben passing to 3 guys coverage
dayum
holy shit
alright boys this is definitely 2008 20
this offensive play calling is maddening
his name is vince williams
bince is nasty
need a to
helpless secondary
this secondary
losing to a team whose coach is like the owner gm janitor and head coach
omfg
minkah and nelson are not impressing me today
our secondary is getting exposed by a good qb gonna be a long season
we legit just sit in zone and wait what a joke
this zone were playing is soooooft
what is up with our secondary playing so loose
man this secondary is the weak link
ooh man that was a tremendous play call right in between minkahs 3rd and nelsons 3rd
holding used to be called too annoyingly now they dont call it at all when its blatantly obvious
he got bushed



yyyeeeeeaaaahhhh
yeah this defense is overrated
are we still selling out to stop the run
hahahahahaha what a joke
imagine seeing our secondary play like this and still ever trying a run play how fucking bad are obrien and the texans oc to even try it
they should try letting teams think they can run secondary cant handle the work load
bush playing better pass d than the secondary
our secondary just taking the first half off huh
cam and tuitt need to push up the middle
thats a big one for bush because that was in that guys hands
p a i n
this defense has no heart i swear
easy completion on a scramble figured
fml
hm didnt like that
bruh this sucks
holy fucking shit make a play
honeymoons over boys time to get to work and not make this a trap game
one thing i dont love about our dbs is how much off coverage we play i would love to see some more press

so hows the offense gonna respond 2 runs out if shotgun and a deep ball that falls incomplete 3 and out probably
we need this to get some damn motivation getting our ass handed to us
tomlins team as unbuttoned as ever
fucking sitting in zone just letting wrs get set up and waiting for the throw from watson
so our defense isnt showing up and we cant run a offense who do i blame for this the coordinators
why do we always need these wake up games where we get lambasted and then collectively go oh shit we need to do this
this could get ugly quick
this is embarrassing but pretty ball is being played by the texans today
if we dont score this drive then ill start to worry slightly we gotta answer
ok guys its 1st and 10 lets do this thing called a screen play those always end with a lot of yards
really need this secondary to wake up man nelson haden and minkah will be the downfall of this defense this team
nice blocking and run newbie
omg offense why cant you just not disappoint our defense
i said it over and over again last week now do you believe me this defense is too dependent on turnovers their scheme isnt up to snuff
ring the bell
that deserved to be picked
yikes i almost thought it was pickedgood play vance
get mcfarland in open space and we in business
our secondary communication seems to be very off people completely blowing assignments vince williams lining up across from cooks my hope is communication can be fixed and hopefully we can shut things down in the second half
i feel like we are so much better when playing man whenever we play zone it feels like someone blows their assignment and they have someone wide open any thoughts on that
meatballs are ready lets fuckin go
look at that ebron caught one
like that play call thats what you should do on 3rd and 1 great 3rd effort by snell
trick play
pancake for 7
dionte hurt
well executed reverse
shades of cower
dj was slow getting up
there ya go ebron
say go dj thats my dj
got to score here
how did we not get that
come on punch it in baby
ebron runs like he is made out of clay
where is jujuuuu
good thing theres no fans there to boo right now

heeeeeeeeeeeeath
dam what a catch
holy shit they fuckin did it
thank you big e
lets fucking go
hands
that was a pretty solid drive
how will the defense respond
ebron szn
ebron you sexy man
yes sirrr
damn great toss by ben
do your thing defense
okay time for the front 7 to make a splash play to bail out the secondary and get our offense back out there while theyre still clicking
fire sale on that sack
dam i thought that ball was coming out
good stop boys
great stand by the d lets close this deficit
nice stop lets do the double dip with the half
teeee jayyyyyyyyy
good starting field position come on bois
ray ray is so good
there we gooo blitzburgh
tackled by moron special teams that seems harsh
okay offense lets get it done again and take the lead before the half so we get the ball back in the second half fucking scorched earth on these texan bastards
a bit late but i love ebron and i am so happy seeing him score looked just like my madden fantasy team
2 minute ben drive plz
good catch juju
look i dont get paid shit to football but if i was on offense and i ran on first down unless i got at least 6 yards i would not run it again on second down id rather run short crosses out routes hitches whatever quick passes to get a first down instead of run again and get stuffed
reminder to everyone that overreacted abotu 10 gametime minuets ago myself included we get the ball to start the 2nd half
nice
juju baybe
td juju
juju muthafucka
yeeeeeeaaaaaaaahhhhhh
big ben for life
washington james washington 7 foot 20 washington
that was a beautiful drive
lets fucking go baby
so that just happened
that was beautiful now lets get out of this half and do it all over again at the top of the second
there we go juju with the walk in is always beautiful
thats an odd zone
playing like we have something to lose now lets keep it upppp
i was mad early now im happy
just let ben be ben
now we are having fun
everything tightening up looking strong here we go
ben is warming up
voodoo juju its spooky
steelers started 14 on third down but converted their last three
juju just hoovering tds
edmunds is our best tackles
big ben is feeding his tightend

niceeee
claypool has consistently been wide open but ben isnt looking his way
will be give up a garbage fg i bet we dooooo
secondary plz
this secondary is just
this zone is getting picked apart
if the defense got a turnover i would be soooo happy
tighten up defense
really edmunds really
why the duck was aikens wide open there good lord man
kinda wish we didnt score too fast but i mean
edmunds has not progressed in coverage since he got here
maybe they will get a td then ill panic
hilton is getting cooked this game
sack right here is huge
half the damn team was open
hahahahahahahah hahahahah
that was not ideal
yeesh just bend over for them
that was just so easy
secondary what are you doing
can we score in 25 seconds o
fire damny smith
nelson exposed
we cannot defend the pass period edmunds is trash in coverage our entire secondary has been getting owned this year
so yeah at a certain point its not the talent its the scheme and the coaching needs to change asap
this defense gives me 2016 vibes
watson to comfortable out there man gotta get some pressure
does anyone have a livestream link
washington is making cleveland look like playoff contenders
is halftime over yet wtf feels like ages
guys if we can make it 2 quarters more without a turn over we wont have to be reminded of that one ugly stat every game
3 bubble screens do it you cowards
hey you get off of mccloud
zero holding penalties on opposing offenses this year
like what im seeing from mcfarland so far for the most part
that spot
i really like this mcfarland kid
im liking what im seeing from mcfarland tonight

although maybe lets not send our rapid but pretty small rb straight up the middle
god dammit


when is the last time we converted 3rd and inches fuck
that nfl bite website is a fucking disaster it just opens a fuck load of tabs i really wish this free shit would improve the formats
there we go


alright conner
really seriously our speed back on a half yard play
what the fuck was that spot that was a first down
washington is just a lunchpale receiver

hard worker strong hands
shit non contact just fell
these deep balls yeesh
is that houstons 2nd hurt dback this game come on have to be able to light them up now
thats a td if ben stops overthrowing
no more deep throws for you ben thats what 4 that were war far over thrown
dbs always pulling their hammy when they get beat deep
he got it
big ben with the burners
gonna be interesting this see this offense 810 games from now i dont feel like they are clicking quite yet cause of the offseason and bens surgery the best is yet to come
dj is out
thats a first
its pretty obvious he got that
looks like a bad spot they rarely change it though
sick fuckin spot
whats taking so long wtf lol
so we ordered sharkeys latrobe pa and my fianc got a typical burgers with all the goodies they brought me a fucking burger with 2 grilled cheese sandwiches as the buns and no toppings im irate
omfg
ben fast willy parker roethlisberger
fuck these refs 0 opposing holding calls all season too
youre fucking kidding
robbed
ben is the best rb in the league
are you fucking kidding me
bullshit
ummmm are we going to talk about how that bomb to washington was completely catchable
wtf that seemed pretty definitive
what a terrible ref crew
how tf look at the ball when his knee was down
how do they still fuck that up after the review
that was easily a first down
thats clearly a 1st down fucking refs
this is a fucking joke
bullshit
thanks chase claypool way to sell that
thats bs
horseshit
refs forgot to use their eyeballs today
trash straight trash
that was a shit call
we finally get a call good job claypool
lmao fuck these refs
not even going to spot it morewtf
wow thats bullshit but thats the most normal thing in 2020 so ill take it lol
had ebron wide open but ill take that makeup call
call stands or yes that spot was terrible but we wont overturn that shit
how the fuck do you not overturn that call thats absolute trash
ok refs refs ok

johnson and watt ruled out
ben what the fuck was that rocket
why cant we catch
well its only 2 watts playing now
gotta catch that
bruh
bozgawd
why did ben throw that
someone catch the fucking ball
this drive really doesnt matter that much

either the d steps up in the second half or we lose its that simple
so do we know if tj is hurt
defense needs a turn over cmon guys
a three and out
ray ray mcdonald
cmon get off the field here
a stop
god damn
did he not call fair catch
did we just get help from sts what is this voodoo
ray ray is mr excitement the last few years have been dredd
ray ray got that off spray applied
cant wait for ray ray to bust one he looks soooooo close to breaking out for a td every time
good job blocking
our special teams is so much better than the last few years mr big wad getting the most out of these players
no one cares about the border wall
ben needs to be better at throwing the ball away holy shit
time to punt
well at least he caught 8t
ugly
hows the border wall going i know i cant really comment on american politics at the moment being a brit but come on how silly
is it fake time
it would be nice if the receivers ran to the sticks and then committed to their routes but oh well
2nd and fucking nineteen what is that play call
go for it
or they let us do the steelers thing where we blow the game either one works
how is cbs still in business theyre like the blockbuster of television
we need a great splash play from the defense
i am ready for a turnover
time for a quick int
would rather take a screen or a quick concept on 2nd and length of the universe instead of a run
have to force a turnover here or we aint stopping them
how is that not holding against watt
do it tuitt
do it tuitt
nice
come on ray ray
lets do it tuitt
there he is
great field position we need 7
you thought you could escape tuitt you thought wrong mother fucker
gotta say houston has some great player names a punter named anger and a lb named merciless
how about play action on first down
did the texans just swap us punters
i miss having receivers who caught the ball
so yall gonna blame ben some more
oh ffs
love it when ben pumps out the camera lmao
of course we get a 3 out
no more big throws ben start pulling a brady and just get yards
no one can hold onto the ball today
i feel like every weapon is getting a drive instead of spreading it around
bruhhh what
block in the back were getting fuckin piped here
thang god bob is horrible
so easy for him to get quick completions
i liked that coors commercial
always open
who the fuck blew that assignment
he was past the line of scrimmage
third and 10 fuck
fucking garbage zone
wow great play by watt
fuckkkkk our secondary is a bag of ass
watt blew that shit up
it would be nice to see minkah make a big play
bad defense today looks like scheme more than effort dont see anyone loafing out there
lets gooo
hilton
finally a pick
there she is
lets go mikeyyyy
nice
there it is
finally
pls offense
picked lets go
watsons head slammed so hard on the ground
wtf are these commercials
defense has stepped up big time second half offense needs to score now
no blockers over there and youre gonna screen huh fuckin joke of a play call
man i should have started ebron today in fantasy
i am enjoying the play of this ebron fellow
let ben call his own plays
ebronhaving himself a game
atta boy connor
good run after contact conner
sorry to ask any streams for the game
man ebron has been great for us this game
connor looked like he got hurt there
uh oh texans d a little exhausted are we
im getting shades of xavier grimble from ebron but in a good way
bennyball
conner looks so slow when he gets the ball no explosiveness
what in the hell was that throw
fuck big ben with the over throws today damn
big train vance
i guess bens repaired arm is stronger than his injured arm
just me that thinks jc is afraid of putting his head down and earning a yard or two
connor needs to learn to put his head down when hes only got a couple yards left
im gonna call that a health miller special to vance because i just miss heath today
vance getting up from the knee was hilarious
texans are gassedpound the rock
i get sick to my damn stomach seeing conner miss first downs because he hesitates thats two times this drive i feel like he misread and missed a first down cause of it
vance just trucked that dude i like it
touchdown
td conner
lets go defense lets fucking go
way to punch that shit in

fuck yeah holy shit
fuck yeah
lets go d
lets goooo baby
lets goo
whew juju made that close hope they dont review it nice job though
alright boyssss time the pull out the ol the same shit that happened at the end of the first half and then get the ball last and win it on a boswell field goal woo hoo
dpoy alert
big sack
watt
holy shit tj
jesus tj is a fucking animal
tj wattt yessssss
watttttt
tj wattttttttttt
watt has some magic too
121 tj watts
pump that shit directly into my veinsss tjjjjjj
lets gooooo
my man lets go
well one good thing about starting so slow all the time is we are a very good 4th quarter running team
tj watt you fucking monster i love you
ohhhh a pick there woulda been sick
tj is looking so much better than his brothers
we played renegade in our house
hes gonna be seeing tj in his sleep
watt looks amped
man tj what a freaking beast
lets fucking go
another tipped pass
our d showed up here we go

steelers defense is sorta good who knew
remember when jj was the highest paid player i guess its going to be tjs turn
i bet theyre missing the crowd now
time for haden to get a pi or a pick
time to wrap this baby up
goooood stop
my house is currently flooded from the amount of stress sweat ive got goin
conner time
i guess if i was going to pick what quarter we play best in 4th is a good choice but it is the most nerve wracking way to play
can we not do that thing where we try and run time off the clock and just go for points to end the game
plz dont keep them in the game plz i can see whats coming but plz prove me wrong
alright jc
time of possession is wearing them out
incredible 2nd half by the d lets burn some clock get at least 3 and take it to next week
well i would love connor to go down inbounds to eat up clock but a 1st an not really hit is never bad for him and his health
look at dem blocks boys
thats a great start by james
this texans defense is gassed
nice run wish he would have stayed inside of washington and in bounds but still a nice run
great run stay in fucking bounds
finish them
mcs block taking two players downlol
we dont make 2nd half adjustments
go for it
stupid question here but why not handoff to vance mcdonald in these 4th and short situations
go for it
yessss fuck yesssss
ball



game
wouldve been the longest fg in heinz history good decision to go for it
go for it yikes i dont like the position
honestly a tough choice here
thank god
aha now thats what im freaking talking about
eat that clock and keep driving steelers
great playcall im loving that
bit of a risky call there i love it
im not a nfl coach but id take the 2 minute warning instead timeouts are too useful
claypool
jesus dude my heart
whew
didnt go into the end zone
jesus tapdancing christ the 1st was more than enough but putting it to the 1 is money
holy shit that was close
what a play call
that could have been disaster
my goodness
what the fuck did charles davis just say lmao
sooooo close to a touch back
whew
you like that
ball game
my opponent has watson please kneel three times
great second half man way to adjust
how did buffalo blow it
30
30
we did it
wow good stuff fam
30 baby
hell of a game much love all 3
this secondary and keith butler about to get exposed this is going to be painful to watch
were about to get blown out
our secondary is so fucking trash
i will die on the switzer hill no matter what consistencyexplosive plays
fichtner has to go
how can you invest so much in a defense and still have it suck so bad
gave up 21 points in a half to a team that doesnt have any legit title aspirations based on their defense and o line what a god awful half of football by then against an inferior opponent at home
why cant we just stick to the script and win when were supposed to blow teams out of the water every game has to be a heart attack nail biter and i wont even be able to watch the end cuz i work on sundays just once id like to leave with a comfortable lead and have it stay that way
where are all the people saying earlier our defense is trash and james connor sucks
james connor needs to go
hey i expected a 3 and out ill take 3
bruh why the fuck is williams covering cooks
defense picking up right where they left off last week
the blitz isnt hitting and our dbs cant keep up its going to be a long day playing a real qb
if you get the ball past the line of scrimmage against us we are fucked lmao
run run pass
love seeing yinzers absolutely lose their shit over seeing a football team run the ball twice in a row
ben just got plowwweddd
anyone miss switz
holy shit im concerned all of a sudden ben is making wtf decisions

still early
is minkah gonna do anything this season or nah
hmmmm our o line not rushing to help conner might say something
i dont like conners running hes soft and weak glad they are mixing it up with the backs
how does connor not make those yards
nice great way to end the drive with a single play call
what that is not intentional grounding through the endzone was always permitted
pleeeeeease o please get us some points before halftime we need to carry this momentum
oh there you are run run pass
run run pass
run run pass
fuckin whiners and haters where you at

crawl back into your holes
minkah has not looked great so far this is like the third time ive seen him in the area of the catch not making a play
nelson didnt even try
nelson got bitched
jesus christ like a knife through butter
wtf happened to our secondary
breath guys its the september steelers
here comes a 80 touchdown pass to juju or claypool

please
steelers d is honestly playing like they all bet on the texans today enough to look like theyre playing hard but hardly playing
watson is 1418 for 202 yards and 2 tds
ben is 1118 for 128 yards and 2 tds


ooof 3 more completions and nearly 70 more yards
thats two shit calls if i ever saw some that was more opi than dpi
gotta hit the jugs machine this week fuck
easy td if they could catch the damn balls
catch the ball
her jersey should be 23rds steelers lol
great stop lets go
texans offensive coordinator taking a page from steelers
texans stealing our offense run run pass
this dan fouts replacement charles davis sucks hes interjecting so many assumptions and arguments based on personal feelings rather than valid premises thats its hard to listen to him just call the fng game stop trying to push your feelings of the matters still better than fouts though and 1000x better than simms
run on 2nd and 19 nice
2nd and 19 run the fuck
i like the running call as a surprise but what idiot goes for 19 through the center
maybe someday well draft a punter that doesnt suck
colquitt stinks officially
turnover time for our d im feeling it
not winning this game without a defensive score here we go
bleh dont throw that high and thats an easy first down ben
wasnt tiktok banned by trump why are we still getting commericals for it
i kinda hate seeing knees within 5 yards of the endzone but take the win dont risk shit still bleh
now trade edmunds for someone who can cover people maybe bob woodward


and get watt on this team
glad for the result but why even call the second down play youre on the one yard line just power it in
you guys are so whiny and negative ffs

put your phones down and watch the game
fuck randy fichtner
conner is so mediocre
can we get a coach that makes it fucking easy for once
hey you may not want to hear this but the defense got lucky last year that they played so many bad qbs the secondary always sucked
the texans are going to score 40 points in this game
nelson and minkah have regressed significantly this season
our pass defense is overrated
tj is out

ben will definitely blame washington for that
you just know houston is gonna score here
wtf was that dogshit punt i could do better than that

ben white tight ends bffs
this ones over early steelers arent as good as we thought
the second quarter literally just started can you guys calm down
remember that one guy we got i think his name is fitzpatrick

sucks the texans already won though
we are going to lose our play calling is so bad does your pussy hurt wake tf up steelers nation
whats the surrender index on that kneel coward shit
kick the fg definitely
imagine if we had a good play caller
why do steelers still have this dumbass as our offense coordinator
so far weve seen connor jaylen and mcfarland at rb i am liking them mixing it up
praise be to bosgod hes still a killer b in my eyes
fuuuuuudge


except i didnt say fudge
uh oh stinky
mike hilton is only good as a tiny linebacker
defense feelin themselves to much
one touchdown and everyone loses their minds lol plenty of time to get a dub so chill
vince williams terrell edmunds and mike hilton are liabilities only coverage sutton needs more playing time on obvious passing downs or the defense wont be good enough
idc how good this team is our coordinators need to go
people are still blaming minkah for that td i cant imagine being that stupid
binceeeee
whos hurt what happened to his cock and balls
idk why our guys arent getting calls so fsr
didnt someone question bens arm strength during the week it was like he needed to show it off
feel like the offense is just too dependent on our defense we have some of the shittiest gameplan in the league
ben wtf
its going to be a loooong afternoon
he was wide fucking open how does bitch boy butler have a job
just run prevent defense if youre going to stand 10 yards off of all receivers
watson is unreal
this team feels typical

we will be slow to get hot but get hot a lil to late and miss the playoffs

every year rinse and repeat
were relying so hard on the blitz its a joke
face a good qb get exposed baltimore or kc would absolutely thrash us
hard to cover guys in a zone for 5 seconds against a mobile qb

looked like minkahbush lost fuller in on of their zones when deshaun took off have to respect him running toward the los

just a tough spot there
are we finally waking up
qb sneak coming up
omfg intentional grounding
god damn 1 yard guys
cant score from 1 yard out
fuck you refs
jesus okay maybe the playcalling suspect
take it all back losers
id like to see them go for the kill here vs running the clock out cause we get the ball in the second half

somebody needs to throw out the 1970s nfl offensive playbook they keep using seriously let ben run go hurry up here and take the lead now and then come out in the second and keep fucking piling on
you guys were throwing in the towel 15 minutes ago lets go baby
our defense is fucking buns today
this is fucking pathetic defence
nelson is baby shit soft
embarrassing simply embarrassing they have the answers to our blitzing
steven nelson sucks
well that was pathetic
watson is just better than the defense he just looks like an elite player would be even better if the clowns didnt get rid of his best weapon
what happened to them not being able to stop our pass rush
couldnt even keep the lead musth less keep it to a tie game
howd i just know this shit was going to happen today the more things change
they will never overturn this terrible spot nonetheless
what a waste of a five minute drive
worst offensive play caller in the league randy should go somewhere
defense needs to make some stops i dont think we win in a pure shootout
2 fgs from the red zone is why we lose this game texans offense has our defense figured out and we can take 3s when theyre getting 7s
really want a turnover here
great stop now lets not settle for a fg and get that td
feiler has been so bad this year inside as far as im concerned put in dotson lol
okay see sacks like that i dont like
should have gone for it
shitty punt
shit on my dick fuck
minkah
we give up a lot of first downs on third and long
ben has looked great this game
ben is still rusty

oh no we suck again
bring back fucking todd haley dude was ass but holy shit his replacement is 10000x worse
but what name is on als helmet
the defense isnt as good as last year1
some random redditor with terrible football takes
bring back switzer
i mean this had trap game written all over it texans are desperate at 02 and lets be real with the way our offense plays wed be 02 if it wasnt for us playing trash teams
hot take our defense looks like steaming garbage and i am sad
whos ready for the inevitable 3 and out to start the second half runrunpass baby
ben is looking extremely inaccurate
fuck man were never getting the lead back are we
we should have kicked a field goal and gone for 3 after the td
dude why the fuck is the coaching staff so incompetent on this team special teams is ass play calling is ass
for everyone who was talking shit after our defensive drive saying if you think the defense regressed you dont know football its time to wake up if you cant notice even from the first 2 weeks that this defense has regressed then youre lying to yourself the hope is that the offense can be good and help compensate but thats tbd
in the very back end recesses of my mind i kinda figured our secondary was overrated lots of tip picks last year and lucky plays this sucks
ben struggling today sailing balls
what an upgrade to our punter s
if only we had coaches who knew when to throw a challenge
its like some of yall just watch the game so you can come bitch on reddit getting so old
ok boys lfg

minkah was in no mans land on that td
omg
great job o line
surprised there has been zero holding calls
villanueva is fucking trash
hilton is a beast
were back
wow people think running twice in a row is some terrible call its pretty normal especially when we get 5 yards on first down

yeesh
when it works it works but my god when it doesnt we get torched lmao
hilton with a great fucking tackle wow
this team has so much potential that will be hamstrung all season by ol randy
ok lets go
wtf
there you go hilton pt 2
great stop by the defense
think ola got hit in the balls
fair catch at the 4
our d didnt give up a third and long lets goooo
diontae with his head up his ass again
bud was going hard at him there better get rid of it
pray for vince balls
gud jahb gud jahb d
diontae what the fuck
i like diontae but hes not the guy to return kicks
big ben 96 yard 10 min drive incoming
so why did diontae catch that one
sweet just need a 96 yard drive fuckin easy
let that go
hope hes okay
chase claypool scud incoming
anyone know where there is a stream of this game
clean it up lets go
are you fucking kidding me
big ben doesnt look great to start this one hopefully he gets in a groove soon
fuck me
ah yes the goal line bomb again
interesting use of a timeout
screen on third anyone
mountain passing
what the fuck
woof
ummm
cool just throw it deep


wtf is this
not even second quarter yet
holy christ man
how about high percentage pass plays to get a first dahn
ben needed clifford franklin on that throwwith stickum
nice job defense
our receivers cannot get open for shit
ben not looking gr8 today
another easy first downthis secondary is bad

where are the minkah truthers
love you bince but you are a liability in coverage
secondary looks confused
he didnt even have to fucking move to get that open
secondary gonna need a sams club supply of cocoa butter for all these burns
minkah been quiet this season he needs a pick
uh oh big stinky
hey if we could cover a 3rd down play and not keep giving soft as fuck zone coverage thatd be nice
bud getting handlednot good
watson is setting this defense on fire
this secondary gives me 2016 vibes
he doesnt even have to make hard throws guys are wide open
dont you just love zone defense
so we were in man on the first drive and zone on this most recent drive

we just not getting d line pressure in the right area or what texans line seems to be handling pressure well
finally bush not getting burned in coverage
what the fuck is going on with the secondary
man we suck lol
alualu is so good
has minkah had one good play so far this season
i dont know if im behind or others are but man this is not the game i wanted where the fuck is minkah
what is minkah doing
somebody show fitchner that you can do 5 straight passes
how are these receivers so open
great job bush
devin bush go blue
guess we see what defense we have when we play a competent quarterback
jwsus fuck
fuckin ridiculous
lol well
fuck
damnnnnnnnnnnitttttttt
wow great start
this is the way
thats just watson being good
rudy rudy
this defense must focus on the media too much letting all the praise get to their heads
alright time for the offense to show up
fucking pat mcafee
secondary is getting roasted
id be disappointed if it wasnt so easy to predict this outcome as soon as every media pundit jumps on us vs an inferior opponent you just know were gonna go out and lay an egg
heres comes the big play from ben
if our front 7 is struggling to make big plays after big plays well have problems winning any game
oof slab up and respond boys

not gonna call it quits on the season after 1 quarter by a real good quarterback but it seems like the steelers absolutely need to put points up on this drive to keep them into it
theres way too many people claiming the steelers suck cause of a bad couple drives chill its early in the 2nd anything can happen
great play what a call
the defense is defending the short field over and over the offense needs to give them a break and keep the damn ball for more than 4 plays
its only the first half people we are a houston turnover away from this being a different game
come on you fuck nuts get your shit together
also no carries for snell
there you go amc
whew that was close
veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
great block by decastro
what was with that yell

oooooaaahhh
connor is so average
why do we suck on 3rd and short lol
should have broken that tackle still great job

i do like this two tight end with claypool at wr set
okay enron keep catching the ball
dj doing his grimble impression
again the double clutch
just dont take a sack now
really
fuck
oh yeahhhh
ebrooonn the monsterrr
ebron
late penalty too wtf
well shit
ebron
thank god for that
wow double e great job
ebron babbyyyyy
beautiful catch
lets go bb
great work lets get that ball back
good ball ben

anyone got the highlight link for that one
highsmith sighting
lets get the ball back and get into the 2 minute offense
he got mobbed
great sequence d
waoooooooo
defense is flying all over the field
i slept in and im just turning the game on how have we looked so far
the bud tj combo
go for the td
fucking momentum
ernie mills would have returned that for a touchdown
two minute drill time boys lets do it
so what do you do when passing works and were back in striking distance revert right back to the run run pass of course
any update on johnson getting checked for concussion
fuck hope johnson is okay
playing james at x so now we know who the backup x is
juuuuuu juuuuuuu
juju
lets go
jujuuuuu
id let ben call al his own plays
once again we have to keep juju
2 minute ben lets goooooooo
juju baby
cmonnn lets go man this is why we throw
thats what im talking about boys
juuuujuuuuuuuuuuu
offense is warming up
offense looks great obviously we cant always score but its mind boggling that we either do this or we 3 and out gotta have more real drives moving forward
it was the jersey i told you
stop somebody
that was easy see not so hard
that zone is bad
cant give up points
we will have no problem bowers in the secondary
well
come onnnnnn pick six
what a breakdown defensively for houston not only was juju wide open so was claypool
overunder on mark madden trashing juju soon
well we let them into fg range way too quick
that watson kid is pretty good
broooooooo
we need some pass rush watson had all day to throw that ball
ok


get a turn over and all is forgiven
deshaun watmontanabreesbradyson
well tits
watson does look really good today gotta give him that
fuck
he is unable to jump i guess
how about a kick return because both teams are half assing this final kickoff
that was just pathetic
boo
what happened to watt
alex highsmith got rooked on that td run
ring the bell
if we can just play some more man to man on defense i dont believe we cannot handle their receiving core especially with hopkins gone
big day for mcfarland
dude is fast
mcfarland shouldnt be shifty he should hit edges
give me 2421
i do not like seeing him try to run up the middle
did the move terrell edmunds to rb and change his last name
wtf
must qb sneak
jesus
cant get half a yard
ray ray always about to break it but trips or get tripped by his own man
wait what
fucking sneak it
holy shit kill me
go for it
wow they are struggling to say okorafors name
mcfarland 8 ypc
i do not like mcfarland up the middle
got hosed on the spot and then get stuffed
yes i love it
great job holding onto that
2nd most eligible receiver and the first down
we better not punt go for it
can someone tell me how we are doing i missed most of the first half give me the run down
can we at least get a fg x
big ben
ben
if his knee hit hes short i couldnt see it
wowwwwww
lol of course we lose the challenge
fuck these refs
diontae is out the rest of the game
silly ben had that
bullshit
need haskins to turn it on and beat the brown
i hate that nothing is ever overturned
wow did we get lucky there
how the fuck
these refs are actually losing us this game
bailed out
well thank god for the penalty cause that was not going to be completed
jesus h fuck these guys
refball
fucking garbage man

im getting pissed
defensestep up
she needs to work on her warrior stance
lets go d cant let us down now
god damnit
that penalty was costly
great stop
good return
we gotta get a td now
ray ray
lets give ray ray a screen pass or sweep
jesus
never stood a chance there
we just setting up the punt
need to get mcfarland involved in some screens
but why
ahhh that sucks
if we somehow won this game i really wont feel like we deserved it
switzer
we need to capitalize on this field position
tuitt
the only thing that is keeping us in the game is that houston think they can run it
there tuitt is
scared kicked it out of bounds
texans fan here do you guys think that every time we have a first down we are going to run the ball as well
i would decline every on purpose delay of game just to be a dick
fox mccloud reporting
this drive 2 yard run 1 yard run 6 yard pass punt
wtf was that spot
better half time adjustments on the d side
alright take advantage
punting is not on the menu for either team today
jesus fuck man
how about a run
garbage offense man
nobody bit on that run

no shit
we had the ball for about 7 seconds there
football team and eagles need to step up wtf
great
omg we cant even get a field goal here
heart fucking breaking

god damn it
block in the back
wowjust wow
wooooow
smh
this game is disappointing
bince is our best db
how about cover the middle
yay tj
are you fucking kidding me

were gonna lose this shit at this rate
football with no fans reminds me of baseball theres an intensity thats missing i think that works against the steelers defense
nice
is bince our best coverage player
zone zone zone
he got stamped
watt got fucked up
lets fucking gooo finallllyly
alright offense get it going
45 yard short first down pass instead of a run well yeah that is pretty likely good play calling now lets not run it 2 times in a row and punt
great catch ebron
heaaaaaaaaath
id like to see a breakdown of us throwing to the flats and it doing anything
huge
conner said get up off me
ebron just killed the texans thats like the 3rd bullet on his resume
conner hurt again
finally looking like we have a rhythm on offense
texans 41 let his tm struggle then let connor get the first down lmao
wtf kind of bullshit tackle from 41

trying to hurt conner
trick play time
fuck please stop overthrowing

we need boz on this one
what happened to the eagles


i thought they were going to e good again for awhile with wentz
claypool
caught them napping there
we just need three here
texans really just wasted their last timeout bosgod about to knock another 3 onto the board

bold move cotton
finally a call went our way
wheeeeewww
oh shit that was close to a major fuck up
that was terrifying
get a td fk em
wheewwwwwwwwwww
holy shit
yoooooooooo
i think the clock is broken
how is it first and goal and still ticking
congrats raven you easily win the division we suck complete balls
fuck it we are way too overrated average at best
yeah this is headed south fast texans are about to put up 40
this defense is garbage without watt
yall killing the secondary there is no pass rush how long do you think they can cover receivers for realistically
id have preferred our first to to be a bigger deal than just a pass punt
time for the offense to do absolutely nothing with the turnover
pussy shit not going for that
ben looks terrible rn
our defense isnt even good lol
leave it to the steelers to make a 02 team look good disgusting

will we have more points or 3 and outs in this game
conner looks so slow
ok so early draft list ol rb cb
cut every single db that isnt named haden or fitzpatrick cut them yesterday
i just gotta laugh at all these dumbfounded steelers fans player x regressed so much no they just arent playing ryan finley the secondary was never very good they got torched by brady and wilson how quickly we forget that
we suck dick at 3rd and short omg this is garbage why not snell
i feel like he could have dived for that
go for it
this game is going to come down to the defense i wouldnt have been worried in the past but we havent been looking good today
has our offense ever not gone 3 and out first possession
ben should have run there huge hole and only 3 yard for the first
well shit
defense has been looking like swiss cheese since the second half last week
where are all those yinzers that bitch about not running old school behind watt
ah yes fair catch on the 4
nothing worse than getting kicked in the dick
does it look like ben is walking around with a limp to anyone else
why waste a timeout what
who the fuck was that to a guy who was double covered jesus fuck
who are you passing to ben
this is a bit on dj for that silly fair catch
told ya 41 got destroyed by vance is leaving
the secondary was a strength last year
nelson and minkah just giving up pass after pass
nice work ladies
all things considered the defense isnt playing poorly theyre getting no time to rest and still making watson work for it a little offense is hitting the snooze button hard
why is mcfarland in conner has looked fine so far
are we really not gonna get a td from the 1
snell snell mach snell
oh my god were so fucking awful
sike lol
need for the pass rush to get there the zone wont hold if watson has a pocket and time
watson just throw the ball man you dont gotta get hit like that
jc from shotgun haters where
best watt is injured
nice drive but they shouldnt have went out of bounds so much
hello haters aka mark madden
i think everyone thought this game was going to be a cake walk and forgot that houston is actually a good team
hot take mccloud as pr mcfarland as rb1 claypool moves up with dj out
because fuck facemask penalties am i right classic refball
washington shouldve laid out for that ben snorted cocaine before the game i think hes pumped
fuck fuck fuck
oh shit that 3rd and goal i thought was 4th down for some reason
rip ben
second time this season our receivers ran a route short of the sticks
garbage punt
its so clear that people here really have strong opinions on the play calling but dont understand the dynamic ben took a huge shot and the best thing to do is hand it off and hope for a good chunk of yards to make the 3rd down play manageable and let ben get his bearings
i wanna stop running but our receivers cant stop dropping
gotta catch one handed ig
why would they keep running
is cobb invisible or some shit
every receiver is wide open
garbage secondary
we cant stop the pass game butler went all in on stuffing the run and sucking the qb at the expense of our pass coverage
it feels like were blowing them out but its only a 7 point game
conner great run but fall on bounds
stop running from the shotgun on third down holy fuck
who is willing to bet the steelers dont try at all im betting a ben knee
its so funny seeing the coach apologists in this thread our entire coaching staff is ncaa div ii tier


wonder when people are going to start giving ben shit on these drops for throwing bad passes

eh i dont know if that was dpi looked like his arm got tangled when the defender was trying to pick it off
fuck diontae
i know that was one of his better punts but colquitt fucking blows
maybe we can get just blown out and our hearts wont explode
oh look more idiots blaming minkah for steven nelsons fuck ups
potentially stupid question here what if juju had purposely stepped out of bounds as opposed to walking it in for a touchdown hoping to really burn some clock and setting the steelers up for 3 tries right at the goalline would that have been a respectable strategy given how much time was left and given that the texans had all of their timeouts or should you always take the points in that situation
snell wouldve caught that ball

wellwere pretenders weve been exposed
this game is done our secondary is straight fucking garbage
now i see why seattle didnt care about losing ebron
mike hilton is so fucking bad in coverage

this offense is fucking pathetic doesnt matter who the qb is
id say im shocked by the play today but that would be a lie typical tomlin trap game against an inferior opponent nice to see the standard is still the standard
guys watson is playing out of his mind sometimes the other team earns it
so ive missed most of the game until now have they been playing well
who the hell is travis scott
i do not like slim ben
as a ravens fan i am absolutely livid the texans def is this trash might actually be 30 pff fake
nfl corrupt as ever as holding is ignored as per usual
its funny how we always hold tomlin accountable for when we win but when were losing and getting our asses kicker everyone looks the other way lmao
here comes some terrible tomlin time management

people need to stop blaming receivers when ben has been inaccurate this whole game good news is ben is a hall of famer so i think he can fix it but those misses by conner and washington wouldnt have happened if ben threw better balls

edit yinz can downvote all you want but ben has not played a good game nitpick on a couple throws all you want but we need ben to play better plain and simple
ive been saying it for 10 minutes this game is over

its pretty embarrassing to be wearing steelers garb at the bar surrounded by neutrals watching the steelers get molested
three more yards than conner would have got
fuck this game about to turn it off make some fucking adjustments butler
this entire coaching staff has to go tomlin and butler first

so at what point do we hold tomlin accountable i mean we havent won a super bowl in over a decade with fucking big ben and havent been to one in almost a decade we constantly underperform
is it too late to get our first round pick back lmao fitz sucks this season
how about we stop blaming drops and start blaming the qb for throwing behind receivers

ben missed ebron running wide open on the phantom defensive pi ben is playing fucking hero ball out there hes not even coming close to completing these passes
oof vince baby what is you doin
oh no
fit ben wouldnt need to cgi the ball he could throw it over them mountains there if wanted
epic steeler td incoming
who is hurt
who is hurt
that fair catch was full special ed mode
my fucking gawd
dude ben what are you doin tryin for a flag
what a fucking shit show so far defense cant cover offense cant move the ball

we need to have a talk with our secondary why is minkah waiting i know he can read the qb much better than this be close before hand dont wait till they catch it to tackle
no time to panicbig ben will get us there
what im seeing is our defense keeps getting put in really tough spots need more out of watt right now rushing against the moving turnstile titus howard

one pressure so far and it wasnt a good one as he allowed deshaun to get outside the pocket
drop drop drop miss pass miss pass
thats what happens when you put a fucking fourth string running back in there
vmc caught it
78 is just not that good anymore
goddamnit
like just run to the outside its not that hard
i love ben
im feelin a minkah play
when we finally have a chance to go out and take the lead we do run run pass
juju
we might need a dtd in this game
smh
i think our run defense maybe got even better i dont even think our pass defense was much better last season


teams did this last season too
afc north nfc east
just trade snell lmao
lol cant get 1 freakin yard
pathetic blocking on 3rd and short
his knee looked down no
who gave mike a ref flag
houston hasnt settled for any field goals while weve had to kick two smh
if johnson ran up he wouldve gotten it lol
go for it
we gonna try another 4th and short
man imagine having a decent kicker we will probably never know that feeling
what a crap punt
bring back todd haley
pierre did a great job trying to sell that hold
how many times are we going to run that play with claypool across the formation and hand off to the back going the other way i feel like we run it every drive
catch the fucking ball
its never bens fault
every school year is like no other cbs news god i hate that sensationalism
edmunds making an error in coverage what a surprise
where can i stream this game
okay randy dont be a fucking punk on play calls
bruhhhhh
uhhh i think thats a touchback right because he fumbled through the end zone
why did they make jake from state farm black ive never met a black jake in my life did the original white jake offend people
conner is soft as baby shit
son of a bitch claypool

minkah exposed again
beautifullll
there offense is in love with the pass when the run game is working
good playcalling coach
seeing us pass this much with old ass ben hes still solid but definitely lost a few steps in this close of a game with conner having 10 carries for solid yardage just makes me miss todd haley more and more

im sure ill get downvoted but theres a reason bens interceptions and sacks have skyrocketed since we ditched haley


name a less dynamic running back than jc lmao just gets out in space and wastes it
catch the motherfuckin ball bitch
is it time to panic on the offense its not like its been even good these first 3 weeks and it looks like wet shit today
i fucking knew it was a mistake to keep going out of bounds every play tomlins time management skills on display
and this will be a tie game at halftime

edit i wish it was only tied
the only time james washington was actually good was with ducky hodges


bad drophorrible player he needs replaced and cut asap
i think its time we put justin layne in nelson just isnt the guy be fooled us to believe he was
james conner still isnt that good
dont worry guys we are going to be fine
he gave up on that play before the ball arrived expecting a flag
this game is over our defense cant stop them our offense cant move the ball

this isnt just stoopid its just bad as well
if you know you know
yeah its a no from me dawg

thats gorgeous do you have an etsy
awesome
this is sick bro using this as my background lmao
this is amazing i love it
weve been blitz happy today i want to be hit happy

obama and dan rooney were personal friends i do believe he was ultimately a chicago sports fan but hed root for pittsburgh in general at least i remember him doing so multiple times throughout his presidency

trump ive never heard say a word about the steelers prior to his recent rally
elvis love for one of americas greatest games went far beyond watching the cleveland browns and pittsburgh steelers his two favorite teams in the mansions tv room



x200b

excuse me wtf
snoop dogg
no they just hold up the jersey of the team that won the sb obama is a bears fan and trump is a patriots fan
well obama appointed dan rooney ambassador to ireland and rooney thanked obama on the podium after xliii so obama might have at least some affinity for the steelers
obama is a notorious chicago bears fan hes holding this for the steelers win of super bowl 43
pretty sure obama is a bears fan i also love the bears still tho itd be really cool if he was a fan of my favorite football team and baseball team
chipper jones is surprising
but what about wiz khalifa i knew he was a fake fan s
a better question is who gives a shit lmao its the president theyll hold up any team jersey of the city theyre in or praise any team that wins the super bowl its all a pr move because dumb people seem to put stock in omg this candidatecelebrity held up my teams jersey der im gonna vote forsupport them because they like my team no they dont they just know the dumb people will buy into that type of cheap disingenuous bullshit
obama spoke at pitt when he was running for president had franco harris introduce him claimed he was a fan of the steelers while watching the immaculate interception while living in hawaii i dont believe those time lines dont add up
im actually obama and yes i like the steelers dont me
trump is friends with big ben they may even be eskimo brothers
based on the game thread my nfl sunday ticket must be at least a minute delayed so much for following the live thread ill know every big play before it happens
touchdown ebron oh wait yinz knew about dat already
your sunday ticket is delayed and the live thread for me is super delayed lol
depends satellite positioning allows us aussies and kiwis to see the game a few seconds before america


i can post shit all day to my american friends pretending im predicting the next play but i really just saw it before them lol

i knew he looked banged up after that end around dang this sucks
damnit diontae is my favorite steeler hope hes just shaken up and its precautionary

how about that second half defense
we need 2019 steven nelson 2020 steven nelson isnt very good
just have a little faith arthur
did they score at all in the 2nd half

these knee jerk fan reactions drive me insane
i feel like were not respecting their olineworried about watson running so were not sending the blitz but all thats doing is giving watson time in the pocket to pick us apart
hey we got the w
you could so easily make this for the texans secondary on that juju td
there was still a little meat left on the bone is all
were blitzing like crazy this year any secondary is going to get beat up a little with this kind if philosophy
maybe lets try a whole secondary of zac effron clonesyou dont know for sure it would be worse
getcha head in the game
good news the steelers defense got their act together in the second half here are some deshaun watson stats to prove it

first half 1418 202 yards 2td

second half 59 62 yards int

also the texans running game could never get going
the d really stepped up in 2nd half though
wasnt really secondarys fault watson was getting a lot of time to throw in the first half because refs missed a lot of holding calls on tj
some were bad some were absolute dimes from watson
the standard is the standard
true

players ruled out for the rest of their games already include steelers wr diontae johnson concussion falcons wr russell gage concussion 49ers te jordan reed ankleknee and eagles te dallas goedert knee

i disagree this call is integral to the rules of the game and removing it would change the way its played
the penalties usually have no bearing on the play because theyre usually unintentional

the rule itself has a massive impact on the game

the 12 men rule is exactly the same are you suggesting they remove the penalty for having an extra player on the field

he only has one pick in three games if anything i feel like his decision making has been better downfield
this is his fourth game in 2 calendar years hes getting back into it
ben is playing pretty well imo
nah bens throwing a lot less flutter balls if any this year like he did a lot of the last few years the surgery seemed to have fixed him

i misread the title i thought you named your kid renegade
awesome i have that exact same blanket
congrats on the baby and thanks for making a new steeler fan
congrats
and on a win couldnt be better congrats
nice

welcome to the nation
you baby is gorgeous congrats
great tastego steelers
congrats steelers bro

ive always wondered how is that as a grill flipper its always caught my eye but i never pulled the trigger on it

last time we went 40 was 1979 when we actually won that superbowl inject it into my veins
be fun to beat arrogant rodgers in this years sb
its not over yet
theres only one champ that season was a failure lets hope this one goes better
our offensive play calls were just amazing this game the fourth down conversions were smart and well executed and the runs to end the game were also super solid he gets a lot of hate here but commendable play calls on offense caused this win
agreed

i remember my dad moaning in disgust a few years ago with wed go on 4th looked tight especially fake to claypool
his play calling early was trash i say this as one of the biggest defenders of him

it got better as it went on

the team just they really really struggle to start games well they need to figure out a way to come out and play with confidence and composure
idk about the deep ball on 4th and short lol
pretty sure the ocs switched sides at halftime
its back thanks to multiple requests and positive feedback here are my realtime thoughts

glad theyre letting conner run outside he is much better in space than running between the tackles

wondering if ben audibled into the handoff to samuels seems weird to run the ball with him if theyre gonna run there why not let mcfadden take it

unusual to see mike hilton get beat like he did on the texans first quarter touchdown

ben throwing deep on 3rd and 7 from inside his 20 will never not be infuriating

starting to wonder if stephon tuitt is ever going to be as good as was prior to getting hurt last year he has been invisible this season which isnt unusual for him prior to the 2019 season

steelers down 143 in the 2nd quarter and the defense still hasnt given up a touchdown on a drive that wasnt extended by a 3rd down penalty or on a short field

so far this has the feel of one of those games that the offense loses but everyone blames on the defense

ben with a nice block on the reverse to diontae but he should never do that again

when the broadcast returned from commercial at the two minute warning they showed a crude photoshop of ian eagles face on someone elses head and thats when i realized how much ian eagle looks like subway spokespedo jared fogle

great two minute drive for the offense

texans two minute touchdown drive was the first time steelers allowed a touchdown without a short field or penalty extending the drive

this is a good challenge by tomlin ball crossed by half a yard before being oob if they dont overturn this its a travesty

thats a travesty his knee is down and the ball is over the line needed garbage call

i am so fucking sick of going deep on 3rd and 4th and short they got bailed out by the pi but fucking stop

too many drops today somewhere hillibilly is blaming tomlin for not preparing the receivers hands properly

concerning they could only get 3 on the opening drive of the 2nd half because it feels like the defense hasnt really stopped houston outside of the first drive of the game

i started ripping stephon tuitt to my dad and he almost sacked watson maybe i need to keep it up

i also hate running the ball on 2nd on 19

id go for it here

missed pass interference when roby grabbed claypools arm i wouldve assumed it was obvious when you see a guy only using one arm to try to catch a ball but what do i know

what will it take for tj watt to draw a holding call he is held on like every play and its never called

what a change in the defense in the 2nd half

i still have yet to be impressed with dustin colquitt but im sure hes probably better than berry

30 feels good bring on the tits
love the hillbilly callout
mcfadden back on the team jk great write up
i feel like they have to let samuels run the ball sometimes just so the other team doesnt clue in that its a pass play every time hes in the play

so far this has the feel of one of those games that the offense loses but everyone blames on the defense guarantee that would have happened if the offense didnt score at the end even with a second half shutout

tj watts lack of holding calls reminds me very much of prime deebo
im a big ebron critic but really liked his game today he looked solid
how did we not get that call overturned for bens scramble for the 1st down the whole booth and mike pereria all seemed to be in agreement what happened there
did the defense change anything schematically in the second half or was it just better execution and thank you for these write ups
ben with a nice block on the reverse to diontae but he should never do that again

the commentators called this one well paraphrased that was a great block but the fans are going to hate that hes doing it
what will it take for tj watt to draw a holding call he is held on like every play and its never called

this seems to be a trend across the nfl nobody is getting called for holding unless its completely egregious probably intended to help protect qbs personally im a big fan of this change i hate seeing drives get killed over questionable holds

edit holding calls were down 78 in week 1 compared to 2019
bring on the tits

okay ladies you know what to do send them to sleestaks inbox lol

great game by the steelers that second half reminded me of the super bowl years
where was the comment when tuitt finally appeared and got the sack
what the fuck is up with the lack of holding calls in general did the refs just unanimously decide to say fuck it thats not a rule anymore
im very glad youre doing these even if they havent gained traction again yet youve still got your fans

0 points in the second half
offense stopped living in their fears at the end defense pitched a second half shutout no turnovers for the first time in like 10 years cant be 190 without being 30 here we fucking go
hi there steelers fans im just a texans fan here to thank you for your contribution to the fire bob fund we are now one step closer to firing the fraud of a coach kinda wish you guys had scored 40 on us though
bill obrian is 373 when taking a lead into halftime

tomlin lowers sunglasses

374
thank god we held on to 30
okorafor had a strong game
man it was like mass suicide in here in the second quarter fire tomlin minkah was a mistake fichtner sucks blah blah blah jesus christ second half shutout held them to 21 here we fucking go
everybody get in here
shoutout to vance mcdonald today was hustling and getting great blocks to open up the run game
2 watts are better than 1
jj watt 1 tackle
tj watt 4 tackles 1 sack
steelers had the ball for 1150 of the games final 1327

d gave up zero second half points
in years previous i definitely feel like this is a game we would have lost slow start on offense defense playing like garbage in the first half playing down to an opponent etc


but we came out in the second half and did a great job this really seems like a different steelers team


obviously we have a lot more work to do with getting better in the secondary with coverage and our offense definitely needs to get better too whether its on playcalling or just executing plays properly

also proud of conner not the biggest fan of him but two back to back games in a row he does a great job of running
2nd half adjustments more of that please
now that thats done can we agree to quit commenting we suck and games over in the first quarter of the game thread
we broke the turnover streak
thats 30 ladies and gentlemen



never ever ever doubt large benjamin
juju impressed me with his blocking today it doesnt get the attention it deserves for the value it brings and if i notice it it has to be good

he gets ragged on a bit for being a showy guy off the field but he gets dirty on it and thats what counts
mapletron is gonna be good
damn it feels good to be 30 holy run game in the second half batman
were going to the superbowl
what was up with the clock it didnt stop at 2 minutes
had us in the first half not gonna lie
now thats a tale of two halves fucking hell lets talk about it

bad

jaylen samuelsmcfarland as third down back just wtf was that conner or snell preferably snell take third down responsibilities cant create such a big mismatch and this was the thing that really stuck out to me and had me bothered

diontae pr this dude scares the fuck out of me hes dynamic with the ball but calling a fair catch on the 4 man oh man hopefully his noggin is good because hes a stud but man we cannot lose positioning on sts

pass pro i have said it every week ben cannot take these hits not real pleased with alfeiler i know ol tape is hard from a tv view but man they didnt look sharp gonna need a watch through on the a22 but not too thrilled

third down conversions we can all agree this area needs to improve right i dont have the numbers but jesus they didnt feel good gotta clean this up

good

vince this dude came to play and just routinely shows why he wont lose his job such a solid player not a fan on him covering fuller but really solid from him

we finally used ebron as we should a big body receiver glad he had his coming out party

mcfarland looks to be as advertised man he is fast and a real good debut for the rook consider me a fan

chuks i said it above but ol tape is hard from a tv view but i am really impressed with chuks i know we had a very small sample size from banner and chuks but chuks has looked really solid out there jj was a non factor and our third round guy played a solid game

ray ray he gonna break one one day we finally have a dynamic guy on krs consider me a fan man

overall was it the prettiest no do i give a fuck absolutely not were 30 and we rebounded hard in the second half shoutout to the coaching staff for the adjustments made because they were huge lets get ready for tennessee boys one last question who ride
first and foremost bless the knees arms ankles kankles and keep em healthy


i mentioned it last week but this game was definitely the prove it game for us


lemme start with the negatives

that first quarter was abysmal on both sides of the ball for us pretty typical these last couple games unfortunately but thats stiller football lmao


dionte is a wildcard at punt returner man that fair catch at the 4 yard was fuckin dumb the guy has a bunch of questionable decisionmaking hes good but he just has to sharpen up his decisions


our secondary man they are practically invisible at best and a liability at worst minkah has been stagnant last season he was quiet because he shut shut down now hes quiet but theres nothing dynamic out of him still early but there needs to be a changebesides hilton whos carrying us in that area bless the man


big ben is throwing it more but his accuracy is very questionable this game overthrowing out the ass glad theyre letting him let loose so hopefully its still the rust that will be gone in a game or two pref


runrunpass fuck outta here with that my guy


positives

that pick in the fourth was a game changer hilton is a goddamn dog fucking love what hes been doing so far such an underrated player whos finally making himself known to the general public


tj watt the truth dont need to say anything else


ben jujuebron connection is getting there ebron with a fantastic catch td


offense is at that good connection so far not up to what i would consider awesome but you can tell they got it together at the second half especially 4th quarter


lemme add we turned things completely around the second half d didnt let up any points gotta give props to the secondary who still got me a bit nervous but nonetheless

so overall weve proven ourselves to be good imo texans are not a bad team at all they had us for the majority and then we went beast mode at the second half sure they were 02 coming in but they faced the 2 best teams consecutively and then us


titans next here we go
first in the afc north bitches also the watt brothers are discussing getting subway after the game
2 watt 1 watt confirmed
loved this game i was kinda expecting a letdown the d looked shakey in the first half

d shut out the second half ben and conner both looked good

big team win

our death was greatly exaggerated
anyone else watching this bonkers ramsbills game
pros

tj watt
we held watson to 5 rushing yards if we want to win the division that means beating the ravens and being able to shut down mobile quarterbacks we did that today in spades
vince williams and tj watt
we saw the emergence of the running game with every back getting carries its good to see variety and plan coming forward
tuitt is back alongside tj watt
we have two tes or just way too many oversized wide receivers ebron showed up today and vance had some classic vance also juju playing like a te at times too with crazy yards after contact
we have the best watt

cons

week two of steelers vs refs team sometimes you have to play harder to win but this is getting old fast apparently holding on the offense isnt a penalty anymore
deep ball was really bad today ben was overthrowing everyone and we got really lucky on that 4th down dpi call
secondary is starting slow in games and while we might be able to catch up now that we actually have an offense to bring to the field the better qbs are going to take advantage early and quickly playing from behind all game is not the situation we want to see ourselves in

all in all a great game for the steelers tomlin seems to have a long game plan so we cant expect every possession to be a big one but if we give up points while not generating enough movement on the offense its going to be a tough road uphill in a lot of games
removed
juju deserves way more love than he gets here
it feels so good to have ben back again
3 0


3 0


3 0
cant wait to hear this weeks episode of pittsburgh dad
ben must feel like a kid in a candy store with all of the receiving options he has now good thing we do not have a diva receiver demanding the ball on every play any longer
two watts are better than one so youre always invited to join jj
good feeling winning in the 4th quarter instead of blowing a lead 30 nice
how many sacks is that now
the amount of sacks this defense is generating is almost video game status
that was a football game
we ride at dawn bitches 30 lets goooo
victory screech lolololooolololol
its what you want 30 baby now do i buy a juju jersey or a claypool jersey i have funds for one
all you tomlin haters better eat crow we had amazing adjustments on both sides
whew was ugly in the 1st half but we fixed most of our shit and played a great game towards the end being 30 feels so good
whatever second half adjustments were made worked like a fucking charm
i thought watt was going to get a late hit call on the interception
ben is too old and the secondary is hot trash and the texans are going to score 40 points fans who never watched a steelers or other nfl game before
i was depressed half the game until we won
cleaned it up in the second half


good win for our guys i think the texans were a good not great team


games get real for here on out here we gooooooo
this team really impressed coming out of the half that touchdown at the end of the second quarter was the last time their offense had any time to breathe total shutdown in the second half running game was super on point but it felt like a lot more outside runs maybe we should stop running it inside constantly hmmmm so the guys had more room to work with really loving this team right now
completely different team in the 2nd half great stuff
mike hilton
undefeated

game ball to tj watt and the guy that did a fantastic job against the other watt chukwuma okarafor love banner but looks like we have an absolute beast at right tackle shoutout to our scouting and our o line coach sharret for continuing to draft and develop that unit

who ridewe ride
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
okorafor was a total baller today i am so impressed good team win way to adjust and no turnovers
i too am moist
how bout some love for juju doing a back flip for that 1st down
honestly i feel juju might be a priority resign just for locker room culture
game threads are fuuuucking toxic were not going to absolutely smother every team every week on defense pitched a shutout in the 2nd half and the offense powered up punted when necessary and won the game great win
what a game man defense shut it down in the second half
30

lets fucking gooooo
im so happy

here we go
good game boys now we can relax and watch the rest of the games tonight
a pretty good all around game from everyone today
defense was great in the second half

good win
30
kind of telling that we never started 30 with both leveon bell and antonio brown
i like wins i like our watts i like our defense i like our healthy ben a lot to like bring on the titans
lets gooooo
i was super worried this entire game but the defense really shut down watson in the second half holy hell that was scary
first half started out messy but we dominated the second

im feeling good about this season with ben back and finally an elite defense again i feel confident we can make a run deep

steelers play their worst football in september usually now we are starting out 30 and we havent even had our gimme games of the bengals and to a lesser extent browns

excited when was the last time we started 30
second 12 d was suffocating last time we were 30 we were afc champions
copy and pasting my thoughts that i posted in the gt

said this when it was 143

the only thing lm going to say is good teams battle back from bad starts they make adjustments and improve over the course of a game the next 2 hours will determine if we are a good team hope the answer is yes because so far it hasnt been



i think we can say we are a good team now
might actually watch ravens vs cheifs tommorow
im from the erie area whens the last time the steelers browns and bills all won in the same weekend or even how many times has that happened in the past twenty years i was trying to find that stat but it seems to be a tough to get to
a win is a win
the run game and second half defense won this game great games from conner and mcfarland

mediocre game from ben at least he didnt turn the ball over
excellent win and exciting game all around 30 for first time since 2010 good shit

defense really clamped down that second half very nice seeing the team able to make adjustments after a rough opening
a positive i want to mention is the job chuks did with jj today really felt like he made him a nonfactor
this to me is an enormous win precisely because its the sort of game they would have found a way to lose in the killer b years the narrative was so familiar offense starting sluggish defense getting carved up by a good quarterback on a bad team playing down to competition yada yada yada but not this year not this team the offense did enough with some excellent plays from everyone though nobody individually went off the defense locked the door and melted the key for scrap metal in the second half stairway to seven baby here we go
i feel like our secondary is not as bad as people say it is theyre usually good at coverage but when they do give up plays theyre pretty big ones add in that deshaun watson is a really good qb im not surprised but tannehill is coming next week and we better not play like the 1st half defense
finally broke the turnover streak by steelers offense and special teams 25 games
were going to get games like that every team does we cant expect to dominate every half whats important is how we react watson is a quality qb who causes teams all kinds of problems and we kept him out of the game in the second half no turnovers is a huge stat too we really really need to start better though

3 and fucken 0
whys espn only showing tj with one sack he should have 15 no he got that one big solo one in the 4th but i swear he had another one where he helped dupree bring down watson
hate how we go down in the first half and all the fans on twitter start roasting the team there are two haves for a reason lol
for a team whose run game produced quite well today our fans sure to complain a lot in the game threads every time we run the ball
never doubted this team half of you continue to be dumbshits the game is not over in the first quarter stay out of next weeks game thread
tj and derek to jj so mom and dad love us more now just saying
okofor looked great happy to see us our coach bob and the texans
the defense really showed up in the 2nd half great game
chucky is a beast
dont blink
our offensive play calls were smart and well executed gotta hand it to fichtner here after a shaky start both the o and later the d started turning up the heat and although the texans are a solid team they just couldnt keep up with it week 4 against the titans we need to get off to a hot start sooner because we seem to have a habit of being slow first quarter players wise i loved conner this game what a strong performance that shows hes our rb1 juju is just a fantastic blocker and ebron was setting up some great chemistry with ben on important third downs
i shoulda known better than to start waller over ebron he was eventually have a great game and he did today also great job by the defense in the second half wish they were like that the first half but ill still take it
yoooo some of ya guys gotta chill saying the season is over when we are losing in the second quarter lol
victory preroll
what a fucking game steeler football and all the heart palpitations that come with it is back baby
allowed 0 pts in the 22nd half to deshaun watson
damn first 30 since 2010

i really didnt want to care about this season because im afraid covid is going to cancel it but damn it i have hope now
d line was good in the first half and great in the second o line absolutely balled out in the second massive shoutout to chuk he kept jj quiet all day big performance from him conner proved hes a starting calibre rb when healthy just a shame it wont be with us secondary still look shaky but hopefully its just a lack of preseason reps pretty much all our receivers had their moments as well weve quietly built up a really strong corp there juju had better be coming into the room to sign his contract just as tj leaves it

excited for the titans game now weve proven these last three weeks that run stuffing is our bread and butter so hopefully we can take henry out of the equation 40 would be a hell of a start after last season
excellent ending defense and offense both looked like they figured it all out by the end 30 feels good
we beat a great team and adjusts the fuck of them before 2 half great coaching and execution by everyone in second half 30 babyyyyyyyy
im absolutely ducking down something today


edith someone
vance had his best game in like 2 years
some wacky games in the league today
falcons bout to choke 2 weeks in a row

edit lol they did
i missed the game cause of work sadly will rewatch tonight to see the w

just need the celtics to lose tonight and its the perfect day for me
in tj we trust
after that game i willing to cool off on butler i think my analysis on him comes down to this the man is godawful at gameplanning but godtier at halftime adjustments i would like to sharpen up our first half performance to be truly happy with butlers scheming

ben played well call more medium crossing routes we dont need homerun passes until ben trains a bit more

drops really killed us connor had a great day on the ground i really wish he would make more plays on the ball and not drop passes
what are these weird things we have are theywins
its nice to have an offense again
i wonder what happened at halftime that woke the defense up

also i didnt see the play where dionte went out i really hope hes gonna be okay concussions suck
tj watt is a fucking beast
were getting outstanding performances from these offensive linemen filling in

great second half and very nice to see the offensive not take their foot off the gas ben knew giving the ball back to a hot watson was a risky move so they just kept pushing forward

despite that first half the defense continues to impress you cant expect them to hold everyone every week but they clamped down when they needed to for the second week in a row
overall solid game we fought hard and came back and came out with a w showing great character and grit from the whole team i hope moving forward we can get the run game going early on and not only deep in the 4th but hey 30 feels great on to the next here we gooo
our 2pt conversion was surgical
loltexans
i hope the dionte injury isnt too bad
will i watch a steelers game this season without a clenched anus for 92 of the game
since i dont see a nflatlarge thread

congrats go to joey burrow for getting above 0000

by tying the 3rd worst team in the nfl who gave them several turnovers and 4 ot possessions
held the texans to 29 rushing yards thats good d
i dont know whats going to happen with this season but this is the first time the steelers have started 30 in 10 years and this has not happened in either of my kids lifetime and its so awesome because this is the first year my son 7 years old is really into watching the games with us
credit to tomlin and butler for making adjustments at halftime something i didnt think theyd make deshaun looked like he was going to drop 40 on us after the first half
whos watching this absolutely hilarious bengals game i am rooting so hard for a tie
people here were talking about the test being this week watson was a decent quarterback to play against and definitely gave her a secondary a test i think the real test is looming in week four ryan tannehill by no means the greatest quarterback but the titans are pretty wellrounded team hopefully we can get our defense waking up early not as worried about the run game even with derrick henry we need to strike fast and hard
james conner was the best back today thought they actually platooned everyone well though
some of my favorite comments in the gamethread within the first 10 ingame minutes today

this defense plays with no heart

were going to get absolutely blown out by an 02 team

fichtner needs to go now

ebron drops everything

bad drophorrible player he needs replaced and cut asap
this is team just feels special defense locked up the second half and boy is great to have a good qb again stairway to seven baby
defense really stepped up their game in the second half glad to see the pass rush finally making some moves against watson secondary needs to the shake their rust off but other than that defense looks stout lets go get that ring
it was definitely a tale of 2 halves lets keep improving boys
im not even excited about 30 in excited that were actually winning offense is looking better every week defense is showing some holes primarily in the secondary and linebacker position that just needs some tuning overall here we go steelers
that td at the end of the 1st half was the best thing to happen to the defense seemed to have woken them up because they played lights out in the 2nd half
now introducing eric ebron and anthony mcfarland im happy with the production from those two when they were called upon
one of the most important calls of the game was moving to the run after the half our running back committee is also surprisingly effective
it is so nice to not have something good happening right now steelers going 30 is gonna keep me sane
feeling good about this win fought through some adversity and didnt get too comfortable with the lead this feels like the type of game we wouldve lost in the past 30 boys
glad to see the win but gotta play better than today if they wanna beat tennessee next week
secondary woes continue but i believe they will get their communication down dont know when but they will nelson minkah and joe just need to create that cohesion again
me currently
first time being 30 since 2010
wowzer
shoutout the defense for that 2nd half shutout30 baby lets keep it going next week against tennessee
howd we look today i had to attend a socially distant wedding and missed the whole game
any score predictions for vs titans i think it will be close but we will come out ahead
its nice having an offense again i was worried ben wasnt the same anymore but hes still probably a top 10 qb in the nfl
30
do u want sam darnold
i find it still tough to judge how good the steelers really are yes they are 30 but their opponents combined records are 09 next week we play a 30 team whose opponents combined record is 18 so a win here may not tell us much im waiting for a game when we play a playoff contender
mike hilton is a straight dog guy is flying around out there also loved the distribution of backs through the game were going to have the titans on their toes next week

beating deshaun watson i feel was a big stepping stone for this team lessons from this game will stick with these guys down the road when its cold and the games start to matter more another big test next week verse the titans baby lets get that 40
dope
its frustrating watching this team throughout 3 games because its there the peak of what this team can be is shown in glimpses yet throughout games players on both sides of the field just have massive mental lapses or just straight up disrespect their opponent and make dumb decisions i dont know who to blame but occasionally our defensive backs especially just approach teams or plays with condescension and it bites them in the ass with big plays and tds

i dont know who the steelers are or who they are going to be this season but we are 30 so yay i guess
those second half adjustments wow
well well well here we go doing work and getting the w lets go steelers
we looked like a true winning team today defense locked up in the 2nd half offense scored on legit drives and coaching had the balls to go for it to put it away great win
big ben is back
not sure what to make of this team but fuck it wayyyy better to be 30 than the 03 last year
preseason i had this one as a loss im delighted to be wrong
next game is going to be goood
so the nfl is just done with offensive holding i wish i could have recorded the game because i could make a pretty sizeable montage of tj getting bear hugged
i dont wanna exaggerate but this may be by far the greatest team ever assembled
i am dying for ray ray to break one it has been too damn long since we had a special teams td
im just going to say itminkah sucks first game he was basically asleep second game completely full of missed tackles and horrific penalties and this game justin more blown coverage and never being in the right place yep i said iti certainly hope things turn around for the secondary is making me really concerned

mopping sweat easy win never had a doubt
30 here we go

hell yeah our offense looked damn good today glad he is alright
we are stacked at wr but when arent we as of late glad hes ok
heal up quick electric to watch
i think his loss was really rough for us on offense

ben seems to love dj i think his injury had ben looking for a new security blanket and it hurt us when things broke down without him out there

but on special teams its going to be a big boost for us ray ray is a return beast and it will keep dj healthier
dj took a serious shot glad hes ok
fucked my fantasy matchup this week but whatever im really glad hes all right

it makes even more sense this way with how they had a lead going into half then got murdered second half
imagine having to play the chiefs ravens and steelers for your first 3 games
the ravens should be the purple person and the chiefs should be red
houston just seems to shut down in the 2h of all their games way to go steelers
look at watson keeping the play going and not defaulting to a run but throwing it downfield
12 seconds later
to mike hilton but still way to extend the play
they really couldnt pay hopkins and watson at the same time bob doesnt execute roster plans well but the concept of trading hopkins was almost a given
lets gooooooo finally the announcer can stop point out that embarrassing statistic for the past multiple seasons
wow i didnt even notice lets go
nah the announcers will just move on to the steelers have turned it over in x out of x1 games lol
we also kept our forced turnover streak going
and two penalties i think
30 for the first time in 10 years love it
only took a team with 0 takeaways this season
squee
the curse is broken
the announcers were too busy talking about what the watt brothers had for breakfast this morning pretty sure they werent even watching the game
our pass rush is phenomenal and they definitely won us this game i do wish minkah and the secondary would make a bigger impact however theyre not bad but if they were like last year wed easily go 133 or better i think
kept takeaway lead going to boot
here we go
i knew something felt different awesome

the booth ripped him off of a rushing first down today
i thought this said hall of farmer qb at first
lemme get a pic of dat stiff arm
goat
the longest tenured steelers player ever
his arm looks live as fuck i am so glad i was wrong about him being finished
the largest of benjamins
still knocking the rust off but 30 once that deep ball timing comes back woo
o7
shut yo mouthim just talkin bout ben
did he get a nose job
benjamin of enormous girth
i know they had the names for blm but today from what i saw they all had a different quote is this also for blm
i think it depends on the player ben said its a statement of unity
i believe its names of black people that died wrongfully some players are doing fallen soldiers as well
its showing unity throughout the nfl victims of violence

its been a tough 20192020 season and to come back this year and go 30 is just a fucking blessing lets go

everyone who says our defense is trash 6 minutes into the game
were getting home when it counts buds pressure leading to the heyward pick edmunds sack last week tj with probably the most beautiful sack of his career a little bit ago wealth is spreading wont be long before juju gets a sack ffs
and this is why you dont come on reddit during close or losing games or at all really unless its past the two minute warning and were up by 28 points any other scenario and its a panic ridden nuclear meltdown where everyone should be fired or retire never fails
lmao we all know who this is at
fair weather fans every team has them but all of ours have reddit accounts
we have beat bad teams we never beat bad teams this year is looking up so far
tbf our secondary has not looked very good through three games driskel and daniel jones both played well considering theyre both bottom 10 qbs and we left guys open left and right in the first half tightened up in the second half but mahomes would throw for 400 yards and 4 tds with the way our secondary has played thus far
lol
to be fair i think all of the offrehab time refired bens competitive engine a little while letting him get into pretty great shape

hes looked less rusty so far earlier in the season than in recent years
multiple things can be true at once ben needing to retire is foolish and firing the coaches seems excessive

but the secondary was awful today generally speaking and hasnt looked great this season overall fichtner is a mediocre playcaller at best and actively hurts the offense at his worst its no coincidence that some of our best offensive possessions come in the hurryup when ben is calling plays himself butler is tougher to assign blame to since the secondary isnt executing his playcalls

and yes despite that were still undefeated and despite being undefeated those problems exist
isnt every team sub this way
fichtner sucks and you cant convince me otherwise
guilty
we shut out the second half and got five sacks
its a great start and weve had moments of brilliance but i am not digging minkah fno big plays lots of blown coverage bad penalties last week and watson completely targeted center field all gamehope he wakes up
the teams we beat are a combined 09 lets not get ahead of ourselves we wont know where the team really is until we play the ravens
the secondary is playing terrible
danny smith has needed to go for five years
fichtner does suck
butler does make a lot of bonehead choices


wheres the lie
i am definitely in the first second and fourth point ben is still in preseason mode ill never judge that hall of famer
ill go to the grave saying fire randy
it was refreshing to see opposite world usually the team comes out blasting in the first half coasts through the second half and barely squeaks out the win

as opposed to looking blah the first half and slowly but surely imposing our will on a bad team up until the end finishing strong was a nice change of pace
this game taught me two things fichtner is like okay to decent as an oc but butler needs gone

first time for ben since 2004 in a way
go steelybois


very interesting graph i feel like the steelers really got the toughest texans effort against them as well since theyre in mustwin territory right now thats a rough schedule to start the season for houston
beautiful
i dont want to hear any more shit about how we arent as good as the rats and chiefs
these are really the big 3 in the afc those ravens games are going to be huge
this this is what i like to see
were good at foosball
texans also having played both of the other games from behind throwing a lot more and getting some garbage time yards
i am definitely not a pessimist but how much of this was garbage time during the ravenschiefs games
this is amazing
great graph
shouldnt this include points and points allowed
if we had better clock management in the first half we wouldve won by 14
the ravens games are going to be insane
they so need to beat dallas to keep my local buddies quiet
this graph is awesome thanks
saving this one to win some arguments thanks
why the fuck are you ignoring the strength of the team for zone yeah we were great in man coverage last year lets fucking abandon it so smart the front 4 has been carrying the defense because butler has apparently gone senile the secondary has been getting picked apart for 3 games now because were not a zone team
you play zone so when watson takes off youre not caught with everybody with their backs turned
a i dont think hes been calling the d the last couple years

b you want to mix in zone because man will without fail break down the way watson keeps plays alive
lmao like clockwork
i agree i wanted to see a little bit more man but against a guy like watson man means hes gonna be able to scramble because the defenders are downfield with their receivers
ignorance is bliss

man i wish i could ignore matchups game flow and personnel groupings and just say hurr durr zone bad because man was good
keith butler hillbillyhaven
cause he has the confidence that he can do what the fuck he wants
my favorite part of the game is when they put vince williams on brandon cooks
also hilton got beat in man for the td
im curious to see this guys post after we win a super bowl its great we won and all but its pretty ridiculous that we havent fired everyone yet
accurate af butler has no idea what hes doing in the first half
they should have run man on the play where hilton got the interception they could have done better than allowing 0 points in the second half
do you ever actually enjoy when the steelers win or do you to have find something to bitch about to make you happy

hey there hope everything is okay with the little fan i see an ng tube in their nose my little guy was in the hospital for the first 3 weeks of his life surgery at 5 days old he needed a feeding tube for the first two weeks kicking ass now
wonderful congrats here we go young steeler fan

a repost but truly the brightest star on our team
this guy is in the top 3 of next jersey purchase total master of position
be still my heart
i dont use the term man crush very often but
jj watt today 1 tackle no sacks no real pressures from what i recall

after what chuks has shown the last couple of weeks and how well dotson played in his first start last week you have to feel good about the future of the oline it can be extremely tough transitioning when youve got a veteran oline that starts aging out but dotson looks like a bonafide stud and chuks has looked as solid as it comes on the right side okorafors footwork really looks refined as opposed to when he was coming out of school there was a lot of hand wringing when chuks was drafted but he is showing he belongs in this league you love to see it
i couldve swore i saw hawkins jumping in there but idk if its for the extra lineman package looked good
i also am a fan of the changes that have been made with the ol i was really worried they were going to be a weak link for us but they are doing a very good job all things considered its not an easy thing to do with so many changes happening all at once
so good to know that our ol struggles were just because teams were always stacking the box on us i forgot who the new ol coach is but good work by him
he had 4 tackles 1 solo just an fyi
i believe al walks this offseason allowing to chuks slide to lt with banner coming back to play rt for us if we dont resign feiler i can see dotson being our guy at lg too
man if they could go into the 2021 draft only needing to add a lt on the first two days that would be really big given the number of folks who are fitting to walk this off season
one of their sacks wasnt credited to him but he was in the pile bringing ben down and i think he closed the escape lane

otherwise our o line has been very impressive i had my doubts during pre season
claypool highsmith mcfarland dotson and pierre to a lesser extent for being udfa making the roster

it looks this might be a legendary draft by the steelers at this point

and we didnt have a first round pick
lets see the potential on paper turn into consistent production on the field first

the rookies have shown enough to get excited but its still way too early to call the draft legendary

our 2017 is closer to the legendary status but at this point next year its entirely possible the only guy left with us will be watt
alright simmer down dude

claypool looks like a solid wr2 which is cool

mcfarland is a complementary back not an every down back

dotson was a solid pickup for sure but legendary


edit you know what im sorry dude get hype fuck yea steelers lets fucking goooo

im a drunk asshole
fantastic class for sure so far but i just dont know if legendary is the right word

although i think we might come away with a top 5 class without a first round pick

im convinced ben is why we seem to be a wr factory

he does so many little things you dont notice like going back to washington immediately after a bad drop to get confidence back etc

dude is a leader
okorafor was tasked with going 1on1 with jj watt for most of the afternoon and he did well

watts stats 4 total tackles 1 solo 0 sacks 0 tfls 0 passes defended and 0 qb hits

the steelers were also able to run his way plenty during the game with positive yardage

github whatsnew
dotson had pretty much a perfect game last week now chucks nearly shutting down a future hof i thought our oline was going to go south after munchak left
jj is no longer the force he once was that said the oline has helped produce 3 100 yard rusher in 3 games
he isnt exactly getting much help from the people around him

wrong sub buddy
i like the texans but it was us or them today i dont feel sorry

but i do wish to see them get some wins this year bill obrien is a shit cunt
yeah bob was a marginally good oc but somehow the texans ownership elevated him to not only hc but also gm hes god awful at those things
houston oilers garbage never sorry
i actually told my man texans qb looks good

psh whatever

your cat is super adorable
steelers kitty
not heating enough appreciation for the guy maybe he hasnt taken one for a touchdown but he has yet to have a return that didnt impress me and im sure we got a return td coming soon
i like him staying at pr and kr as long as he doesnt muff punts and call a fair catch inside the 10 yard line
does anyone have a video of that return where he must shook off the tackle and ran for like 12 yards
so far im impressed by him definitely an upgrade over switz
a competent return team is a big bonus to have it can help turning losses to wins as it takes a bit of pressure off both the defense and the offense

with our kicker back on track to being well above average and our new punter being an alleged improvement our special teams are now better
im super impressed with his contact balance for being as fast as he is im use to our guys just falling over haha
hes definitely going to break one soon i feel like hes the most dynamic returner weve had in a while
ray ray has a chronic fumblingmuffing problem as a pr in college ive just happy he catches the ball anything he does afterwards is icing on the cake
love this post ray ray is fucking quick man cant wait till he brings one back going to miss dionte a little because he was exciting returning punts but i think ray ray is solid
im extremely apprehensive to hop on the ray train what are the odds hes gotten over his fumbling issues hes had his entire career seems pretty slim but im warming up

this is the kind of offense i like how can a defense pick someone and stop them like we did saquon if any weapon on the field can be the one being used
can i get an f for starting dj as my wr1 in fantasy with davante adams out
im glad to see ben is starting to connect with ebron hes the best tight end weve had since heath retired
this is the way
you cant cover everybody all the time
i like this approach more than force feeding every ball to ab which results in some amazing plays but also creates turnovers plus when you have an offense that utilizes all its weapons a loss of one or two players dont make a huge difference if you form a habit of relying on one receiver his absence is felt instantly



how is that schizophrenia

thats random but funny
next year jj comes and joins his brother
jj is my favorite player sad the texans are not looking too great
pittsburgh is just far enough west to get the midwest nice
is this in ambridge
my favorite was a texans fan chiming into the postgame thread saying thank you for contributing to the fire bill obrien fund
tj watt boyeeee
cool kid
eat n park
lol im steelers fan living just outside dallas
so no one there was wearing a derek jersey
im actually the opposite a steelers fan living in houston i went to the game 2 years ago and loved it
were grow some of the best cump
removed

were 3 stepping here


old mans record
big props to the guys up front going into the season i was worried about depth and lack of experience and that became even more worrying after banner and wisniewski went down love the next man up mentality and happy to see some quality play from chuks and dotson loved seeing decastro back as well 3 consecutive games with a 100 yard rusher

these 10 am games kill


refreshing switcheroo from last year when we were 03 against teams with a combined record of 81

eta next week we play the titans who are 30 against teams with a combined record of 18 and theyve won their 3 games by a combined total of 6 points imo texans might be better than the titans but well see
cant overstate this fact enough but it was good to see the defense play and win against a truly elite qb such as watson
lets also not look past the fact that 3 of the 9 losses are from us lol
am i the only one who didnt think the texans looked that bad
all of those teams played teams that are currently 21 or 30 soooooo
can we just enjoy a win
the fact the weve beaten 3 03 teams in a row is almost more impressive than beating 3 30 teams we have a history of playing down to our competition and losing to bad teams
chuckles
im in danger
buzzkill
yes but last year we might have beat the 9ers and the seahawks if we had ben play also our defense was no where near its peak but i understand your point still we should beat the titans if we are a truly good team
yes but we register one third of those losses as well too small of a sample size
all hail the schedule maker

that is impressive means a lot too that banner beat him for the job maybe we have both of our tackles if villanueva leaves
if chuks dotson and banner can all be quality starters that will be huge the oline was getting old and we needed some young guys
chuks looked good today
jj watt playing for almost a decade and only playing 98 games really puts into perspective how much hes been injured in his career
is it pronounced chucks or chooks
chris carter hosts locked on steelers podcast its a daily podcast that goes over the steelers obviously the episodes arent very long but this guy is pretty knowledgeable and knows his xs and os

teams are not throwing at fitzpatrick and bush has done excellent in coverage both guys are due for a big play lets face facts our team is loaded with talent on the defensive side of the ball well be patiently waiting
bush made a ton of huge plays today what are you talking about

was responsible for a sack had a huge tfl and the biggest pbu of the game

not hearing minkah means hes doing his job
edmunds is the weak link on our defense opposing teams attack his side more than minkah just for that reason we always notice edmunds getting beat or running behind because offenses target him a lot not minkah if were not hearing minkah being mentioned for a turnover then its a good thing from a safety pittsburgh hasnt given him the freedom they gave troy to roam around just yet so theres only so much he can do but lock up his side of the field the front 7 isnt letting guys get by them which is a good thing so he cant make too many tackles or force fumbles

this happened the second half of last season too teams started going away from him and his playmaking slowed down when sean davis was playing that position we still heard his name on a weekly basis lol not in a good way neither so im fine with minkah keeping his side of the field quiet im sure pittsburgh will unleash him as the weeks go by and some teams will take more chances near him give it some time
i always think its a good thing to not hear minkahs name if you never hear his name then hes clearly not committing dumb penalties or getting burnt like nelson and hilton did today plus dont you think opposing teams watch film every week and try to avoid him i really dont know for sure if minkah is playing well or not
so when bush lead the team in tackles and passes defended through two weeks that wasnt enough
bush has been incredible in the past few weeks fitzpatrick has been pretty mediocre in my opinion but that may be because they are not saying his name as much
they dont call your name when the other team doesnt look your way
nah youre not watching close enough they are still making plenty of plays and not everything they do to contribute shows up on a stat line

plus our dline is so good lots of plays dont even make it to the second or third level
bush has played well minkah hasnt really been beat badly but yeah hes not making any splash plays at the moment
you dont understand what youre watching stop having opinions about it
nah

shutout second half were fine
its also notable while not in the same position but something to consider that bud dupree is playing for a contract so hes drawing a lot of attention if he can continue at 75 of week 1 were looking good
30
uggghhh do you actually have any braincells left
my argument here is that defenses rely heavily on the 4 preseason games to work out communication and scheme since they didnt have that e are all watching preseason defense expecting more they will gel but i am definitely frustrated like other fans
youre not allowed to talk negatively about fitzpatrick here

alls ill say is he was much better this week but absolutely deserved to be called out for his performance last week

lmaooooo this guy just sits in his basement furiously typing at fans of his own team but zone doesnt work rah rah rah when he doesnt acknowledge that our dbs got beat 1 on 1 too
so answer me this bud would you wanna play man coverage and had all dbs backs turned to the qb who is a very real threat on the ground or give up a few passes here and there by playing zone and keeping him contained
unpopular opinion but i agree i understand trying to stop the texans run but a lot of prevent like defense today didnt mix the man blitz in as much until the second half
i assume we all agree that you have to use zone you cant play 100 man

the question then is whats the right amount of zone it does feel like were using it too much but i dont have any numbers to back that up weve also been blitzing like crazy zone coverage supports blitzing and allows for more creativeconfusing blitzes does any website track zone vs man coverage snaps

also can you explain how danya has literally anything to do with this discussion
its weird that the team probably knows this already tomlin actually said today that they played zone so that more guys could have eyes on watson because of his running ability
get off this sub you arent welcome here stay in your basement rooting for the steelers alone but you really are the worst of this fanbase leave the playcalling to the professionals we won and thats all that matters theres always justification behind their decisions
stairway to 7 confirmed
what is bens jersey number
ben should go to the casino with those numbers
if the prophecy is true it can only mean one thing a 7th super bowl
uh guys does this mean what i think it means
if 666 is for the beast 777 must be for the goat
the prophecy has been fortold
that arm is bionic

all clips of ben from now on must have the bionic man sound effect when he throws
i like
its 7s all the way down
see what happens when you quit porn and booze
calculated
i have a question as a non steelers fan

when do you folks see ben hanging it up

also do you see yourself moving to draft a qb or sign someone who is being thrown around the league like a winston foles maybe darnold type player and give them weapons to be successful

spotted in mexico

damn the steelers are awesome
the peoples car cant argue with the owner of this one but do believe keeping things original is the way to go
the steelers are 30 right now combined the nfc east is 291 with the cowgirls and football team having 1 win a piece and the pidgeons having a tie im so happy we played the nfc west last season and the nfc east this season instead
and the nfc east has more wins the teams weve played combined lol

ben and dan both have 147 wins marino has 22 more losses

if ben wins 2 more hell be alone at 5 all time in wins
einhorn is a man guy
the pittsburgh runs strong through both these men and both score very high on the big galoot scale
seems like people just dont want to admit this guy is pretty good why i dont know yet another 100 yard game for him and for a second game in a row he pretty much sealed the game in the 4th quarter

james conner has eight 100 yard games in his career the steelers are 701 in those games james conner is one of only 3 steelers since 2010 to have back to back 100 yard games
i think most people like him as a rb the problem is his durability he needs to make it through this season to begin to change the perception
hes a very good back who cant stay healthy i loved what we did today with all 4 rbs getting snaps i think a guy like conner will benefit greatly from that kind of offense he has the talent but he just doesnt have the durability for a workhorse role
i dont think its that people are afraid to admit hes good i think the bigger issue is we all know hes good but his fragility is keeping us from getting our hopes up

i want the guy to go adrian peterson bananas i also want him to play all sixteen games
hes a good back but he struggles to remain healthy week to week luckily he beat cancer though i love the guy as a steelers fan but i wasnt going to draft him
hes a great rb and a beast but he cant stay healthy i love the man but we probably wont resign him
as others have alluded to conner is a fine player he is just very fragile the frustration is largely about his durability
i like the current distribution of the rbs give conner about 15 carries split up the rest dont be afraid to go with the hot hand
hes not great but he is good the late game big runs had two pulling lineman creating wide open lanes for him from what i saw he only broke 1 tackle maybe 2 tackles he is a good blocker and onecut runner but is not great at anything i will say that he surprised me at the end of the game today with his improved aggressiveness and ball security

i also have no problem if he proves me wrong
i love the guy great player when healthy just cant rationalize paying him with his injury history and when his backups have come in and we havent missed a beat
hes gaining traction again but lets stick to the committee hopefully fresh backs to wear on defenses and keep them honest up front then good luck figuring out our go to weapon for ben i mean really who the hell is it thats a good thing to not know
its our fan base they focus on two or three plays he does poorly on and thats the only thing they ever remember
we cant pay a guy with his injury history 12 million a year the best ability is availability rb is the most replaceable position in the league
he is much better running outside than between the tackles thats really the secret to his big game yesterday
what nobody ever said he wasnt good not sure if youve watched previous seasons but hes missed 16 games in 3 years hes good but injury prone this is very much an entry level post lolol
very talented will get hurt tho
hes a good back would i be upset if we got someone who is more of a every down back not at all hes good but honestly people hype him up too much
conners issue is a two parter

1 our offensive play calling often is predictable as hell and we get stuck in run run pass ruts where any defense worth their salt will quickly pick up on it and shut the run down ready for the air game doesnt matter who you hand it off to in that case a vast majority of running backs in the league are getting very little

2 conner has had some injuries and after last season repeatedly coming back when he wasnt 100 and trying to play through injuries because the playoffs were on the line didnt do him any favors couple that up with a ankle sprain to start the season and suddenly hes incredibly fragile and has durability issues nevermind all the other season ending injuries happening around the league and since his return hes been productive

people know conner is good we just lack consistency on offense right now defense is jiving and the offense falls flat drives start off strong then fall into predictable patterns one quarter were getting nothing on the run game the next were chipping them for 57 yards a go

we get our offensive hiccups ironed out and improve our playcalling so it doesnt feel like randy is just pulling from his top 10 most recent plays and has no clue he could back out of that menu and see a whole host of formations play types and more things will be looking a lot brighter

right now were doing enough to win the day and thats about it its been over a season since weve handily won a game too that definitely adds to the nerves and doubts
who is saying he isnt good what people are saying is that he isnt durable or reliable both of which are true

if we at least one per game for the rest of the season the record is ours
it was 4th longest according to the tv graphic

cut conner
spoiled asses go follow the jets for a few weeks and tell me how bad my team players coaches are
people think that every failed drive is the sky falling and its because they only watch the steelers
im all for bitching and whining about the ingame performance but calling for people to be fired when were currently sitting at 30 is the most embarrassing shit ive ever seen
ive read every post on this subreddit for over a year and a half now when i first started coming around i was in every game thread theyre so fucking toxic i had to stop after like week 3 last year
guys we could be like the falcons i swear this fanbase can be spoiles beyond belief
outside of the steelers isnt tomlin considered one of the best
is it just me not looking in the thread most games or was this one particularly bad i got depressed reading them nearly the second i looked sometime in the second quarter
the game threads are straight up toxic lol lotta people in here who think the game ends in the 1st quarter when in reality we still got 45 minutes left to play
ha im one of those but its really fun we all comment stupid shit in the heat of the moment and really no one curses when the defense allows a big play or when the offense goes 3 and out
let me preface by saying that i never call for any firing and im 100 a tomlin supporter but seeing other steelers fans pissed off when were losing 143 kinda acts as a coping mechanism for me its almost soothing
but were cool with fichtner
i havent seen theae for a while though
the only 1 of those 4 i saw was about the first half defense and i dont think they would tell you they had a good first half
im not sure what people are expecting from a game day thread of course its going to be a shit show people get emotional about this team and this game and when it doesnt go perfect theyre going to lose their minds in the game day thread its just mindless venting people relax let people blow off steam and scream through their keyboards theyre not hurting anybody
would it be considered doxxing if there was a weekly postgame thread all about links to the people who comment things like this in the game thread
its the most toxic thread on reddit

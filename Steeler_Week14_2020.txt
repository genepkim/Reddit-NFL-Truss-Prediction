Who says Steelers nation?
https://www.steelers.com/audio/steelers-nation-radio/
"I cringe when I hear the media or other fans use either term. I even heard an announcer use ""Gator Nation"" when talking about Univ Of Florida...eww."
"None of the above. Probably an unpopular opinion but it always sounded like some semi-pro highschool/college type fan unification... Like, it's beneath us.

If it happens organically, I get it. The terrible towel, Renegade... Hell even the old ""60 Minute Men"".

But ""Steeler Nation"" always felt as if it was thought up by a marketing team to ingratiate themselves into an existing fan base. ""How can we sell them soda if we can't identify 'them'…?"""
"I mean, it's always been ""Raider Nation,"" and like it or not, we (and most other fanbases) have adopted it.  There's never an ""s"".  No idea why that would be a question.

The question is whether or not any of us ought to be poaching it in the first place.  Let them have their thing in Oakland/LA/Vegas/wherever.  I get annoyed by fanbases glomming onto other teams' shit.  It still pisses me off every time I see lesser fanbases waving towels around."
"It is absolutely Steelers nation. 

Literally no one ever says Steelers nation."
""
I wonder if it's cause most people couldn't watch the game so they had to look up the scores lol.
We probably have the biggest fan base across the country too. Go to any big city and you'll find a Steelers bar
I have never heard of Tori Kelly.
I was googling it all day to see when the game actually was.

Playoffs? You’re getting a little ahead of yourself there bud
The first game we played tho... was that a JV squad? And weren’t you coming off a bye? Aight then...
"When a person dies we are reminded that from dust were we made and to dust shall we return. 

As we watch the ravens playoff hopes die I would remind their fans, from the Browns you came and to Browns you will return. Ashes to ashes, defunct to defunct."
[deleted]
Y’all have almost the exact same schedule lol
"lmao have fun on the couch this post season, ratbird"
As a Ravens fan lol get fucked saltbag
keep crying bitch
"Imagine taking the worst player/coach on every team and saying ""You beat x"""
"3rd down.  I think your entire fanbase has talked itself into a frenzy of believing it was 4th, and that the call on the field made any difference in the outcome of the game in the first place."
"In the words of Antonio Brown, KARMA...🤣🤣🤣"
Y'all forget the camera angles - no one **on** the field was complaining
*The Audacity of Cope*
"""overrated Browns"" are ahead of the Ravens, lol."
"Unfortunately none of us have much respect for an organization that enabled antimasker bullshit to parade through their locker rooms mid pandemic while hospitals filled up.

Bitch about us winning ugly all you want, it's your team that couldn't even play on game day. The winless Jets have managed to field a team come game day every week, which is more than your whiny bitch of a coach has managed."
Now list the Ravens' signature wins.
"Which one? The one where Benny Snell clearly got the first down? Ok.

John Harbaugh can eat shit."
Imagine being this much of a crybaby
""
Next man up - AH its his chance now
"This is awful. I would have rather lost that game than losing Bud. It amazes me how few people actually acknowledge this. TJ won't be as good without Dupree on the other side. Our whole defense is based on this pressure. Without it, we will have a really tough time in the playoffs.
I am bumped and can't enjoy that win and being 11-0 even a bit. Feeling like we lost a playoff game."
Well we will now get sooner than expected evaluation of Highsmith. They are going to also have to sign someone else for depth.
Our DBs are about to get exposed with not as much consistent pressure on the QB....
"EDIT: I thought they were at least tied, but it looks like they are at 68, but still on tracks to get to 70, as long as they can make up for Bud Dupree's projected injury. TJ and Cam can still do amazing things!

It's kind of a neat stat considering the last defense to hold the record was Tampa Bay, whose defense was coached by Mike Tomlin."
"Nope.  68 and counting.

The chance to beat the record comes against Buffalo, if we can sustain it till then."
"There is also the unofficial record, before sacks were counted officially... at 76 games with the Lions.  

I say we beat both records"
I'm pretty confident that we can break the record
I just hope all.sacks against Alex Smith are gentle almost loving sacks.
""
"This is awesome. Don’t sugar coat it, be honest and improve for next time."
Can we please get an us sucking flair
I’m glad he’s like this
Tomlin is the goods. We are very lucky.
"Offense wasn't as good as it could have been. A lot of drops or coming up short on 3rd down, some sloppy play in general. To be fair this was an a typical AFC North match up against the ravens, im just happy we didn't lose"
Love that
"I am honestly impressed that the reporter was able to say ""uh"" 6 times in 10 seconds."
Ex Tomlin hater here. I know I know I’m shit. Three years ago I was calling for him to be gone. Last two years I’m eating my shoes. Seriously this man could probably get the Jets a win this year if he went over there. He just knows how football works and when his players perform they win 100% of the time. Last game need to be put far behind us and let’s stay perfect!!! Thank you Tomlin you brilliant man!
73% of the 15 incompletions were dropped passes. That's just bad.
Ben had similar things to say in that post game interview. I love that our leaders are holding the team accountable and calling it like they see it (without calling out specific players).
And things of that nature.
"Reporter: ""Coach, how do you feel about the execution of your receiving corps?""

Tomlin: ""I'm all for it"""
We have the best coach in the league.
"I seriously thought he said ""Uh, suck it."" to that reporter lol"
r/Tomlinism
"Hate Tomlin or not, he will make you hold accountability for your poor play if done so. He’d probably be putting our receivers to work making sure they don’t drop another ball"
We definitely needed to do better especially the receivers who kept dropping passes that hit them in the hands.
We don't make excuses.
"The way to fix problems is to admit there are problems. Coach will get it figured out and fixed by Monday. He went 8-8 with just a defense and two rookie QB’s, Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer and Donald Duck. Everyone in Pittsburgh knows we need to draft a QB or end up with a Mark Malone. And get back to basics like running the ball. Get the other Watt into the game.Recognize problems and solve them."
Been posted here already
That's my coach and I'll ride with this man until he decides its time to stop.
"""Us sucking."" God I love Coach T."
"the standard is the standard, and we sucked"
u/SaveVideo
git guud
This is aweome but Mike needs to say the same for some of his timeout calls this year.  Oh geesh.
This might be my new favorite Tomlin moment
"This shit made me go "".....yoooooooooo lmao"""
Ben and coach T has been brutally honest. No sugar coating. Good stuff.
Our offense is going to have to make up for our defensive injuries soon. Bud is too big of a loss.
I thought he told the reporter to suck it before I read the comments.
So glad he knows the problem and isn’t just seeing a win
"No I said that I  felt like just maybe a league rule with the Rooney name on it might possibly put just a little more pressure on them than another team,maybe I should have been clearer in the original comment. I haven't said anything I wouldn't  say to the man's face, because that's what a man does,  I've  owned what I  felt at the time , realized I was wrong and said so. I never hated the man, I didn't think he was the best hire at the time, time has proven me wrong and I've said as much. Being a great position coach or coordinator doesn't necessarily translate into being a great head coach, the unemployment line is littered with great OC's and DC's that couldn't pass muster."
r/technicallythetruth
u/SaveVideo
Pissed
why'd i think this was Lil Majin?
"Tomlin is about to buy a jugs machine for every receiver on the team. 

Which I just realized everyone calls it a jugs but the brand is Jugs."
😳
I heard “suck it” the first time! “Us sucking” not bad either!
Randy “five yard pass” Fichner shakin rn. He’s just here to let Ben make his own play calls. It’s stunning how obvious the difference in the offense is when Ben is in the no huddle and when plays are being called in.
This made me laugh so hard
"I won't  lie , when we hired Tomlin I thought it was a lot of virtue signaling by the Steelers. I have never been happier to say I  was completely wrong. Now my mind was changed very quickly because it would take a blind man not to see what they saw in him. Everytime he steps up to a microphone it reminds me more and more how much I love this guy."
"Why do left leaning people always break things down to skin color,  the rule about interviewing black coaches is named after our owners, how would it look for them to pass on a black coach and have everybody in the league saying yeah yall talk the talk but don't  walk the walk,  forgive me for feeling that it might have played a role in his hiring. Also, how many of you had honestly ever heard of Mike Tomlin in 2006, I'm familiar with the Arkansas State and University of Memphis programs and had not heard of him, believe it or not there are people that can form opinions without race playing any role in it. I shared my honest feeling about the hire and admitted I  was wrong. I won't  apologize for that."
Hey coach to what do you attribute you only winning three playoff games in the last decade ...
"Good God it must suck going through life seeing the boogeyman around every corner, you can not honestly say there was no pressure for the Steelers to hire a black head coach at that time, that was my entire point, as I  have said repeatedly from the first time he stepped to a mic I saw why they hired himand have been 100% on board. Recently an article was put out saying Tomlin was one of the great black coaches and I was offended by the author qualifying him , I  think he's a great coach period. I would love to meet him and get to shake his hand and say to his face exactly what I've said here.

The whole racist thing g is so tired, and as for feeling superior it is you projecting that, your the one calling me names and cursing me because I  had the audacity to think a rule named for our owner might have put some pressure on them"

Bush was against Cleveland
Knees blow.  It happens.  It happens on Sundays at 1pm just as easily as it happens on Wednesday at happy hour.  Next man up all the same.
"Yeah I dunno, sometimes injuries just happen and it’s not anyone’s or anything’s fault"
Devin Bush was against Cleveland
[deleted]
I think it's conference record. So if the Steelers were to lose and they are both 15-1 this would be the week to do it since their loss was to an AFC opponent. This would be an NFC loss.
"doesn’t matter, Browns are going all the way **BABY**"
"Of course the tiebreaker could go either way depending on what happens.  ""What happens"" is the definition of a tie breaker.

The scenarios at this point in the season are too many to count.  Right now, we could tie with KC at 11-5 and have to decide which of us gets the fifth seed.  Let it play out a while."
"It's Win% of common games played.

Common Games Played:

* Ravens (1.000 for both teams)

* Texans (1.000 for both teams)

* Broncos (1.000 for both teams*)

* Bills (1.000 for Chiefs)

Basically. If the Chiefs win out, the Steelers can only lose to the Bengals or Browns. Losing to the Bills gives the Chiefs the Common Games Win% tie breaker. Losing to the Colts gives the Chiefs the Strength of Victory tie breaker, whether or not the Colts win out. 

*Chiefs play Broncos this week. A win for Denver would be huge, however unlikely.

"On the contrary. I think that a certain number of our players would be fine for the most part. They probably can’t even catch it...

Edit: Ignore the extra ""a"" before suspicious...proofreading"
I almost missed the joke haha.
I don’t understand why all this pregame/postgame hugging etc is still allowed. It is completely unnecessary
Wow.  I guess I completed missed the joke.  Sorry about that.
"I saw it at the end of the game and I was screaming at the tv. 

They should have just ran to the locker room. I know they just were next to them actually playing, but why take the risk."
They played football against them with tackling and blocking in each other's faces for two hours.  I don't think handshaking is that dangerous after wards.....

"Unpopular opinion #1: we are an elite team, and should be considered the favorite to win the AFC, and the Super Bowl.

Unpopular opinion #2: we will not lose a step without Bud.  He was playing solid football, but no better than that.  Highsmith and friends have a real chance to improve overall production from that ROLB spot."
I think we currently manhandle the Chiefs.
[deleted]
Bold prediction: we’re gonna lose to the Bills
"As much as I love this team, I think we get manhandled by the chiefs. Especially with the loss of Bush and now Dupree. I guess that may only be an unpopular opinion in this sub tho lol."
"[I deleted the thread don't worry]

Unpopular onion: I prefer when people think we're frauds

If you think about it, there are multiple tangible benefits to being doubted by analysts and other teams:

-lowered expectations means lots of chagrin when we keep winning

-teams will underestimate us, which affects their effort and game planning, thus helping us

-motivation for our players and less pressure

-less disappointing and shocking when we do have imperfections

I dunno, I guess I've just grown numb from reading too much Reddit commentary and news articles in the last couple days. I know our team is the best in the league, but I want to stay humble and I feel like we play better when expectations are lower. I'm sure that's confirmation bias, but it sure does keep me from getting frustrated at all the mouth breathers spewing hot takes without being able to think about it objectively."
"Hot take: James Harrison rejoins the team for veteran minimum, logs 15 sacks, 5 INTs, and places 3 QBs in long term comas over the next 4 games thereby edging out TJ as DPOY."
"Those who say ""If we play like we did in (insert close win here), we'll lose to (insert good team here)"" aren't saying anything insightful, but I think they know that. What I'm curious about is what they think they *are* saying, because I truly don't know what the point is that they're trying to get across. It's true that if the Steelers play as poorly as they did against the Ravens, they'll likely lose to better teams. What often goes unsaid is that it's obviously equally true that if the Steelers play as well as they did in some of the two (or more) score wins, they're likely to beat anyone. Similarly, if the Chiefs play as poorly as they did *in the game they actually lost*, or other close wins over lesser teams (squeezing out an OT win over the 3-8 Chargers, walking away with a mere two point win over the 4-8 Panthers), then they're also unlikely to beat the Steelers.

That's sort of how reality works. Play well, you're more likely to win. Play poorly, you're more likely to lose. I guess I'm curious why some feel the need to say this out loud. Since we all live in the same reality, we should all know this without it needing to be said. Do they think anyone will disagree? I really just don't get it."
Here’s a thought - we may not play the Chiefs at all. Anything can happen in the playoffs. They could lose before they face us. I do agree that this is the best Steelers team that we’ve seen since 2008. Guess where the Super Bowl is this year 😎
Juju is the most needed WR on the team. He’s not flashy this year but Ben trusts him to make the hard catches and to get the needed YAC
Unpopular opinion: The Browns are getting the same flack that we are getting. They are 8-3 and the NFL power rankings still rates then below the Ravens. Everyone just wants them to be bad and they are actually decent. I still want to blow them out again and make them cry.
"From your lips to God’s ears!  I pray you are correct about Highsmith.  He has shown some promising signs.  If he can play at a closely similar level, we should continue to have a hell of a defense.  That was probably Bud’s last play in a Steelers uniform.  I hate to see him go out like that."
TJ is going to see 1 million double teams
"I’m just taking a moment to vent like a rage animal about how the league is defiling itself trying to make time for Lamar Jackson to come back. 

First they did us dirty by postponing the Thanksgiving game six! days! in the hopes of getting negative tests back so he could play in Pittsburgh. 

Now they’ve pushed the Dallas game to Tuesday for no real reason other than to give the ten necessary days since his first positive test. They obviously think a team can play on four days’ rest because our game is going ahead on Monday afternoon. 

It’s so obvious that the league is bending over beyond backwards so they can get the reigning MVP back on the field. The illusion of competitive balance is gone. This is a farce. I hope Andy Dalton has his once a year great game and hangs 30 points on those dirty RatBirds. 

Okay, I feel better now. Thanks."
Browns are looking really good right now...
This stretch of games (3 games in 12 days) will help our offense get back on track for the playoffs.
"We're a really good team and have very good odds at being a super bowl champ this year.


Dunno how that became unpopular after going 11-0 and sweeping the ravens. But here we are."
Here’s a hot take: We rest a significant amount of starters vs WFT
"We go 15-1. Win the super bowl. People will STILL say we're overrated, easiest seasonal path to the super bowl in history, would've lost if we played (x), etc. People will refuse to accept the Steelers are even a top 3 team this year, and if we don't win the whole thing, it will just affirm their shitty biases."
"Unpopular opinion (in this sub): the Steelers finish the regular season in 2nd place in the AFC and get bounced in the first round of the playoffs. 

First assumption: The Chiefs probably don’t lose another game, so they finish 15-1. 

Second: The Steelers lose to Buffalo and Cleveland, finishing 14-2. 

Now we’re in Wild Card weekend, potentially facing teams like the Dolphins, Colts, or even the Browns again. I’m having flashbacks to 2017 against the Jags, or 2007 against the (goddammit) Jags, or even our loss against Tebow and the Broncos. I just have the feeling that we’re in for a huge letdown, followed by a lot of hand-wringing this offseason. I really hope I’m wrong, because anything leas than making the conference championship this year will be extremely disappointing."
The Browns are playing like Super Bowl contenders against the Titans right now and I’m scared of them
"Steelers being the undefeated underdog is the best thing to happen to them this season. Close wins against shitty teams=classic Steelers not a real reason to panic. 

Tomlin WILL get them ready to take on KC whether or not we keep the #1 seed"
"The biggest reason this Steelers are undefeated is not because of weak schedule, but because Big Ben has no away games."
Do what Clemson did when they beat the fuck out of Bama a few years ago.  Just find all the plays KC can’t stop.  Every offense runs the same concept in different variations.  There has to be overlap.  Same with defensive schemes.
Ben is out with 9 minutes left in the 4th because the Steelers are leading by 20+
Hot take:  Taysom Hill is just dollar store Kordell Stewart.
"Bud is a MAJOR loss for us, poor kid.  Blows the knee out in a contract year.  I hope he gets better and I hope Steelers find a way to keep him on the team paired with TJ"
Just have a bad feeling the game on Monday will be way too close. Dunno if it’s that unpopular of an opinion lol
I kinda want to lose a regular season game. The thing I'm most afraid of this year is that the patriots won't be the only team ever to go undefeated and lose a super bowl. Especially if the giants make the playoffs.
Our superbowl win chances are toast without bud. We will lose to the bills.
Can't wait for this 18-17 win!
"My prediction is we lose two, maybe three of our next 5 games, finishing the regular season at 13-3 or 14-2 at best. We make it to the AFC Championship game and get blown out by the chiefs by 17."
"Every year we have garbage games where our players forget how to play football but this year is the only year in recent memory where we win them.

Browns about to lose 3 straight. (I had a browns fan trying to tell me Chubb is better than henry)

Ravens about to make a dash for the playoffs but will barely miss it and only one team from the AFCN makes it."
""
"But they are 11-0...


Beat Baltimore at full strength, Titans and killed the browns. Better point differential than chiefs and better opponent strength, so ya GFYS OP lol"
That Bills game will most likely decide if the Steelers will go undefeated.
Rent free
That Pats team is the best I’ve ever seen but that Dolphins team is incredibly overrated
"There is something to be said about gritty, ugly wins that should almost be losses. Keeps them grounded,  prevents them from getting too high on themselves and provides ample energy to keep working hard in practice."
Steelers always play down or up to their level of competition. They could beat the jets by 3 and the chiefs by 3 in back to back weeks
"From all the highs and lows of yesterday, leave your final thoughts/analysis/discussion/takeaways from yesterday’s game.

This thread is intended for level-headed, mindful discussion and less knee-jerk reactions. Keep this in mind before commenting.

As always DON’T BE A DAMN JAGOFF. Follow our rules. We all have different opinions and mindsets, but we’re all here to talk Steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day. Keep it cool."
All aboard the Alex Highsmith hype train
"It’s gonna sound like an excuse for the team but I think the constant pushing of the game had a bigger negative effect than expected. It was, by far, their worst offensive showing this season and I don’t expect it to repeat. On to Washington."
"I’m just bummed out man. Bud worked SO hard to get where he’s at today. In what was likely his last and final snap as a steeler, the team that was so patient with him and worked with him to grow, he tore his ACL and ended his season. The guy deserves to get every penny and I truly feel for him. He wanted that bag. Never made a fuss about a franchise tag and was one absolute hell of a teammate. 

From a selfish standpoint, this hurts the team. Obviously alex highsmith will take over and while he has exceeded my expectations thus far, it’s certainly a downgrade. That’s not a knock on him, but a testament to the level Alvin was playing at. Going to have to adapt somehow tho. Perhaps more Hilton blitzes, more stunts, etc. gonna have to get creative. 

Losing Bush and Bud hurts. No way around it. Is it a huge blow to the team? Absolutely Yes. It is a death sentence? No, I do not believe it is. This defense is absolutely littered with talent, and while overcoming two phenomenal players going down is not an easy task, I firmly believe we are more than capable."
Thinking about Bud. Other problems can be tied up. Next man up! HERE WE GO
Mike Tomlin to James Harrison: “I am once again asking for your OLB support.”
I’d trade bud Dupree for a loss.
"The Steelers Constantly Play Down to the Competition noise is really starting to sound like nails on a chalkboard to me. It's such reductive and dubious bullshit, as if the Ravens whole season wasn't on the line yesterday.  
  
They can't win the division now, they're two games down to the Browns for a WC, and yesterday's loss means their path to one is that much more narrow.  

The Ravens played with the appropriate desperation, and somehow Steeler fans are surprised by their effort. Why are we always blaming our team for how hard opponents play us?  
  
You can criticize all of the damn drops, poor STs performance, the god awful tackling, but you can't make up some b.s. about ""Steelering"" when the Ravens led by 1 point for a grand total of 4 minutes."
"I'm still anxiously awaiting the return of the run game. The Ravens secondary was one of the only position groups intact and yet we had to throw it 50+ times to win this game. I know Conner and Pouncey were out, but so was most of the Ravens starting D-Line. If we don't feel comfortable running against backups, how are we going to fare in the playoffs?"
"Turn half the drops to catches and this is a blowout. Ben had his best game with accuracy for the entire year. Do we have a run game? 

W's a W"
"Mike Tomlin’s press conference after was perfect. He was pissed, as he should be. Hope they come back Monday ready to play."
"Run game concerns me. 

But if the receivers don’t drop everything last night Ben probably has a 90% completion rate and the game is a blowout, so at least we know the passing game is not an issue"
"I’m not surprised it was an off week for us, having the game moved and jerked around really doesn’t help athletes mentally and physically prepare. I know when I played D1 soccer game day routines and the practice leading up really makes a difference 

I also wonder why KC and Baltimore fans are so pressed about us being 11-0, like if you think we are so bad why are you all still talking about us? If we really aren’t a threat then you would forget about our team"
"Tomlin was not happy after the game, calling the performance ""junior varsity league"":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soZc05px6Fc"
"Defense played great. Bit suspect without Tuitt on some plays. Highsmith gonna sink or swim getting the big time step up into Bud's spot.  I do have more faith in him than I do in Spillane for Bush at least.  

Offensive playcalling was bleh, rush was bad until late in the game, so many drops.  Fire Randy, of course.  Hope Pouncy is just a close contact or symptoms and not covid positive.  

Special teams... muffed punt.  Only reason the ratbirds believed they were in the game.  I think out punt coverage on both sides could use a few extra drills, always looks shakey. 

Ravens gonna miss the playoffs"
"I have to say I loved how all of the fans of both the Steelers and Penn State were reacting to McSorely playing in the game chat compared to the rest of the Steelers fans. 

Basically [this.](https://i.imgur.com/vqMOTbo.mp4)

Beyond that I really loved the ability of Snell in that game. I had real questions how we'd be able to do without Conner and Snell did well. A lot of drops this game by both teams but it is a Steelers Ravens game, what do you expect? Defense always clutch, you love to see it. Offensive scheme was something, but it worked out. 

In any event, on to the next one."
"We're 11-0 and media still talking shit about us and not acknowledging our success this season. Man, I can't wait for us to shut them up."
Tuitt tweeting that “easy game” shit just proves to me that there are guys on this team who think that mindset is acceptable
"Take away a few of those drops and I think we would have won by 2 or 3 possessions. Hope those WRs and Ebron hit the jugs machine hard.

Super bummed about Bud. The offense will need to have better games than yesterday if the D can't be quite as formidable."
I think the defense will still be fine. Still talent all over the place. Think our Super Bowl chances will be determined but what our offense does (or in yesterday’s case does not do lol)
This is the worst win I've ever felt as a fan. Played our worst game of the season after already being frustrated with the time changes. And then we lose bud. Just pain.
"Tomlin is pissed and so am I. That shouldn't have been as close as it was. Versus practice squad and back up players who have only practiced once for this game. Versus 5 or 6 practices for us.

They keep pulling out these wins because of talent alone. Offensive playcalling is so predictable I may win some good money betting on it. That's one of many reasons the running attack is poor. Ben under center with 11 personnel. Run."
"Despite the final score, I don't think we were ever in any real danger of losing this game.  Even with our brutal mistakes gifting them points and sabotaging our own points, we still completely neutered their offense and were moving the ball consistently against their defense.  The 70 yard TD to Brown was essentially a garbage time TD with a hilariously bad blown coverage, reminded me of the Minnesota Miracle, and was the only reason this game ended within a possession.  It should easily have been a final of 19-7, and that's not even counting all the TDs we should have had in our numerous red zone trips.  

Really, the only major concern I have is the WR drops. McCloud has been solid so his muff is likely an anomaly, and the same goes for Edmunds re: the poor angle on the long TD.  If our WRs can clean up the drops, I see no reason why we can't finish 16-0.

It's just starting to sink in for me how well our offense complements our defense.  The quick rhythm, short passing game helps to create long lasting drives in the absence of the run game, while also limiting turnovers, thus allowing our defense plenty of time to rest.  This way the defense can go balls to the wall every time they're on the field and are not gassed at the end of halves.  I don't foresee a 16-0 finish, but I think this team is well built for a very deep postseason run."
"Can I just say we aren't really built to blow teams out. Teams aren't out there guessing what we are going to do, and it's been that way for awhile. We have a stellar defense who is built to get constant pressure and blitz, every team knows this and we say ok beat it. So far no one has. 

We have a lethal short passing game, with tons of options for ben. Teams know we are going to spread it out and we say ok now stop it. 

If we just had a run game we could control games more. That's what we need to figure out."
"Despite our arguably worst showing so far, I didn’t think the Ravens were in any position to win that game. At least I wasn’t ever afraid we were going to lose. I was frustrated with how the team played, for sure. That ravens team wasn’t good enough to hold the Steelers jockstraps. If they cleaned up the errors and only dropped half of the balls we did, it’s 24-7 early in the 2nd half or better and we are coasting at that point. 

Bud is a big loss, but so was Bush and we are still the best defense in the league, so here’s hoping Highsmith steps up big. 

Also, fuck everyone who says we aren’t legit or KC is head and shoulders better than us. You’ve been watching too many shampoo commercials. We have the 7th most points scored on the season averaging only 3 ppg less than the chiefs, while they are surrendering 4.5 ppg more than us. Not to mention being the sacks and takeaways leaders. They lost to the Raiders, almost twice, they had to take the 3-8 chargers to OT, and almost lost to the 4-8 panthers. They’ve had as many squeakers as us, while we haven’t dropped one. In fact we’ve beaten baltimore x2, stomped the browns, and beat the titans, all 3 of which are currently ranked higher than the raiders, who beat the quiefs. Get off mahomes’ dick"
Hope everyone slept alright after yesterday... I feel better now about the game yesterday we just have to put the drops in the past and keep moving forward. I’m just very upset with the Dupree situation I feel bad for the man. But at the end of things this is Steelers football and it’s next man up mentality Highsmith will hopefully fill his role and do it well. We are 11-0 and swept the Ratbirds and in my book that’s amazing no matter who you play and how you do it. Let’s keep the winning train rolling and the vibes high HERE WE GO STEELERS
People forget that all their points came off of Ray Ray fucking up big time and Edmunds freezing for some reason lol.
This season is what I thought the killer b squad would be...
The receivers are gonna be practicing catching passes for 12 hours straight lmao
"I went to see what was happening in r/Ravens for the Hell of it and the comments are as predictable as one would assume. ""Worst 11-0 team"" (as we've been playing bad teams), ""F\*ck the Steelers"" (real original there, fellas), and ""The team is full of phonies"" as a handful of examples. If we had actually stomped them, they would have blamed COVID. We won (barley) and say how we beat them with their roster depleted.

Maybe I was hoping too much, but I was hoping for some more introspection and comments on their newer/lesser-used roster."
I couldn’t hear the game. What happened on that second (I think) down where they measured it. It looked short. And I think they said it was short at least it said so on tv. They reviewed it and then said the call “stands” but it was now a first down? I was confused as to what the original call was or something
Steelers offense dropped the ball way to many times this game could've been a blowout if they would've not made to many mistakes
"I wasn't able to watch (stupid rescheduling, ugh), but I've heard about the bad first down call... I'm confident that we can get 1 inch on fourth down, it wasn't a ""rigged call"" that determined the whole game.  Excuses, excuses..."
"While we have a lot to work on in our game, I believe the Ravens D was very good and made us look bad in certain instances more than other teams would have. They deserve credit. We still need to improve, but we tend to forget that the Ravens are almost as good at blitzing as us and although Ben took some shots it wasn't a disaster."
"It's  hard for me to say this, but I believe the offense is responsible for buds injury. If the receivers catch the passes that hit them in their hands and  we turn those field goals to touchdowns, bud wouldn't have been in the game that late. Just my opinion."
I've been following the play calling on the offense pretty closely and did some comparison shopping. I have a master theory that the short sideline passing game plans are reserved for teams we know can't score on the defense with consistent success. Strong feeling that the offense has been hiding the playbook  since after that first Ravens game. Somebody is going to get a classic dose of down field passing Ben whoop ass when the time is right.
"Another week, another game of Randy Fitchner pissing off the entire city."
Go look at the Ravens sub lmao. They are fucking pathetic lol. Tryna say they are better than us off of one game of poor play. Blaming the refs for both losses and getting us to 11-0. I don’t think there is anything I hate more than Philly fans and Ravens fans.
"Just got a notification for a bungles post about us.

All I have to say is: The Bungles are without a doubt the worst 2-8-1 team I have ever seen."
"I’m nervous as hell we’re headed for an early exit from the playoffs.  We HAVE to fix our run game.  IF we can, then I think we’re fine.  We need to work on the drops a little bit, but that is actually fixable.  I don’t know if the run game is fixable or not.  If it’s not, then we are not winning the Super Bowl this year."
Just bench our stars for the next game. We've all but secured AFCN and a top 2 spot.

"Juju is smart and lucky enough to take advantage of a social media career along side his NFL career. If anyone on this team can be “cap friendly” it’s him. His Twitch, IG and YouTube channels alone combined earn him $750,000 a year. Never mind his sponsorships and his NFL salary"
"I know yesterday was an anomaly for the other receivers, but I still think juju is our best receiver and they absolutely should make an effort to keep him"
"Juju's YAC is just insane. I mean, not by the numbers, but the fact that he will catch something in no space and then still get an extra 4-6 yards is incredible. Dude is tough."
"I’d like to think JuJu is a priority, but we’ll see. I love Claypool and Diontae, and I give Claypool some slack since this is his first season, but the drops are rough. Statistically speaking, Diontae is one of the league leaders in dropped passes. I think Washington gets the short end of the stick though. (And I think if JuJu becomes a priority, he’s the odd man out)"
Oh captain my captain

Please pay the man so he can be OUR future captain!

I guess that means we're going to resign him.
So the team plans to bring him back next season?

The only non common opponents between the Ravens and the Steelers are BAL plays KC and NE (combined 13-7 with BAL removed) and we play DEN and BUF (12-9 with PIT removed). It's pretty evenly matched this year.
Ravens have like an identical schedule that’s crazy
Give them credit. We didn’t have to play a 10-0 team this year
"...this might make sense if your schedule wasn't VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL, BALTIMORE."

"The arguments about this are exhausting. No one will be convinced one way or the other. Yes, our SoS is low but, you know what, you play the teams on your schedule.

Hi fellow NoVA resident!
"As enjoyable as it is to be undefeated right now, our main goal is to win the Super Bowl, and I really don’t think going into the playoffs being undefeated helps that cause. It just puts a big target on our back, some guys get arrogant (see Tuitt‘s recent tweet) and if we get kicked out of the playoffs we’re the laughing stock of the league for years to come.

Just look at the Ravens. No matter how well they would play, they are being mocked with choking in the playoffs, King Henry memes, Fullback Earl Thomas and stuff. We would be them x1000.

What’s your opinion on that?"
16-0  means absolutely nothing without a Super Bowl victory..... just ask the ‘07 Patriots.
"I don't think it matters what our record is once we get to the playoffs.  Every game is a must win at that point regardless of record. 

But I agree I care more about a SB win than a perfect season."
"Well the only game we can’t afford to lose is this Monday. So there ya go

Edit: CAN not CANT"
">  if we get kicked out of the playoffs we’re the laughing stock of the league for years to come.

*The Cincinnati Bungals have entered the chat.*"
Superbowl > 16-0
I’d rather win than lose.
I’d love for the team to get a weeks rest before a playoff game. So yes the 1 seed is quite desirable
"I don’t think it matters what the record is. Most writers/ analysts don’t even think we are the best team despite our record and probably won’t even if we go 16-0. Yes the Steelers have their flaws but it’s about getting wins, especially a super bowl win."
Been saying it all along.
"I'm hoping for 15-1 (loss to Buffalo) and Chiefs drop game to Saints (14-2). Ravens I think will be 7 seed, chiefd/Ravens rd 1 would be great. However if we get the 2 seed we may face the rat birds a 3rd time.."
I agree. I think a loss eventually is important to be refocused before the playoffs. I'm thinking Clemson losing to Pitt and beating Alabama for the championship.
"Everything you listed is still going to be there going 15-1 or 16-0. We are still going to have a target on our back, the player's egos are going to be their egos, and people's opinions on us if we are bounced from the playoffs arent going to change."
"Sure but if no one can beat them in the regular season then nothing can be done about that. So far, no one seems to have ""it"""
How is going 15-1 better than 16-0? As long as they win who cares if it's going 16-0 or 15-1. Why would you want them to potentially miss a bye week?

"No. We do not ask ""who"" whatever. Teams know us. We are the Pittsburgh Steelers, noone needs to ask who we are."
"The Steelers had another pick-six against the Ravens yesterday. Via ELIAS: The Steelers lead the NFL in scoring defense, sacks and takeaways. Only 2 other teams have done that, this late in the season since the 1970 NFL-AFL merger, and no team has finished with the lead in all 3.

I just have a gut feeling he is going to be very impressive. What do you think?
He was drafted knowing we would be losing Dupree so we’re just starting earlier than planned.
"I’m with you. Some people you just have a gut feeling about, right? He put up some real TJ like numbers as a senior for UNC. He’s big and he looks mean. I think it’ll work out very well."
Next man up can always become the man. All you need is an opportunity to prove it!
"I loved him in the draft! It’s hard to go that far, but I love the gut feeling. Hope you’re right"
"Highsmith has a super-high ceiling imo, kid is a stud in both pass rush and pass coverage, he sets the edge pretty hard"
"This isn't an unpopular opinion, it's a bold prediction. And I really hope it comes true."
Do we have a nickname for him yet?
looks like he can line up on either side and be successful too.  i love how his highlights show him making the big play even with a lineman or TE draped all over him
"I think, and certainly hope, that he will be very good. Trying to temper expectations for this year. If he can make enough plays to prevent other teams from double/triple teaming TJ constantly I’ll see that as a win. Learn some lessons this year and fix them in the off-season, ready to rock next year."
Wanna see him hold up against the run. Has always been the question mark about him. As a pass rusher I think he is already pretty solid
The prophecy has now been foretold
"He's good, but not great (or even very good).  He's going to be active and make his share of hustle plays, but I think his size/speed limitations will hold him back from standing out once the dust settles and he's matched against grown men on every rep."
""
The NFL and ESPN really needs to assess him a qbr to go with his perfect passer rating in Super Bowls.
That..that's not a picture of Tommy Maddox
I used to watch Randle El in college. I live in Indy. He was an electrifying QB. I was so happy when the Steelers drafted him although I had no idea what they were going to do with him. I did know he was a very gifted athlete though.
That’s a weird way to say our lord and savior Duck Hodges
"I know this isn't the real reason for your post OP, but being old enough to have watched each one play for their entire career (still got a couple more for Ben), I can say that they are cut from the same cloth. As for stats, those have to be discounted as the game was much different.

Terry was the better athlete. He was truly a generational talent. I remember reading an article about Terry in his first couple of seasons claiming that he was the fastest player on the team. And his arm was second to none. Maybe Bert Jones could throw as far, but I don't think anyone could match Terry's combination of velocity, accuracy, and touch. 

Believe it or not, I think Chuck Noll was most responsible for Bradshaw's early struggles as he refused to designate an offensive coordinator. Noll was old school. And as much as that set the foundation for those great teams, it also did Bradshaw no favors. Think about that for a second--Bradshaw had no offensive coordinator or QB coach until Tom Moore in 1978 (I think). Also, Bradshaw was responsible for calling the offensive plays. There is no wonder he struggled for the first 5 years. Lastly, I think the league had a larger number of great teams and great QBs. Bradshaw truly beat some great teams to win those 4 Super Bowls. Heck, he rarely lost any big game.

Ben is a terrific athlete also. He doesn't have Terry's arm or speed, but he's bigger and stronger. I think that Ben just might be one of the best when it comes to turning nothing into something. The game is never over when Ben gets the ball in the final few minutes. That part of Ben's game has always been amazing. I live in Cowboys country and I hear all the time about how great Romo was at doing it. They quiet down when I can get them to watch Ben's highlights.

Ben could have easily played in Terry's era, and there's no question that Terry could have played today. Until Ben gets another Super Bowl, I'll say that Terry Bradshaw is still the best QB."
"Love terry, but its ben."
"Its a toss up. Back then Bradshaw was playing in a league where you could be killed, drug off the field and next guy up. People like Jack Hamm would fucking hit you so damn hard your grand kids would feel it. Penalties were non existing. 

Now. Technology and human evolution provides, smarter, much bigger and faster players than of years past. I'm talking overall, everyone on the field now literally runs a sub 5 second 40 including lineman 🤣 now you can be penalized for playing slap hands with Brady. But my boy Ben, because he's a big strong dude with grit, gets hammered, plays through injuries and continues to be arguably one the best all around QB of my time. 

Idk. I'm 39. Seen so many greats come and go. But Bradshaw playing in a tougher league, not superior imo would get the nod. This is my opinion. Trash it if you like. Go Stillers"
If you asked me this before this season my answer would have been Bradshaw but being in the here & now I must answer Big Ben 💛🖤💛🖤
"Bradshaw lost 4 or 5 seasons because of his arm injury. People think the 80s were a down time but they had very good teams in 1983 and 1984 and a healthy Bradshaw would have had them as Super Bowl contenders. 

I was 13 in 1983. It’s hard to describe the excitement in town when Bradshaw came back late in the season. Unfortunately he didn’t even make it through one half but threw 2TDs going out in a blaze of glory."
"Tony Dungy, easy."
Anyone who ever played NFL street knows that Randle El was literally the most valuable player in the league lol
I think Neil O’Donnell threw a prettier ball
"Both great QBs but Terry is downright annoying in his post NFL days. He’s also a Tomlin hater, and therefore a member of the most delusional group alive today."
"Man I loved Randle El... had his jersey and everything. Loved him at Indy too, I’ll never forget the first time watching him play Penn State I thought he was the best."
"Did Michael Vick play like, one season for us or am I making that up?"
Still have my Randel El jersey. Might have to bring it back out
Love this post but it's Ben.
Cliff Stoudt?
I don’t see Mason Rudolph in this photo??
But but... Ch-Ch-Charlie Batch...
It’s Jeff Reed
Dick Shiner?
"What's the point in comparing, they're both great but one is severely understated and it isn't Ben. They are both GREAT QB's."
"I can't hear the arguments over the gleam from our six Lombardis, eight conference championships, thirty-one playoff years, two bronze stars, and a purple heart."
Not quite a toss up brad has 4 rings Ben has 2 both had great defenses although steeler d of the 70’s was one of the best ever check their stats in 1976 the year brad was hurt they were amazing!

Spillane number 1 I like that
Spillane has been a stud
"I have been pleasantly surprised that Spillane hasn’t been picked on in the passing game. Same for Edmunds.

The Rams defense is so fucking good - I think they may make a run in the NFC.
"Crazy that Haden's rating is still that high with a pick 6.

I just realized this is through week 12, not just week 12."
"Where's that guy who said Spillane's #1 pass coverage rating was just padded because of his interception against the Ravens lol, as if interceptions don't contribute to your pass coverage grade."

There have only been three other teams to get this far in this season and lead in these three categories: 1985 Bears, 2000 Ravens, and 2017 Jaguars. If the Steelers somehow manage to finish the season in the lead in all 3 categories, would they be considered amongst the greatest defenses ever?"

"I'd feel a lot more confident if Bud was still playing...  As it is, I'm just trying to enjoy 11-0. It's been up and down this season, but I will always take an ugly win over a fantasy point filled loss."
"For anyone who can’t read the article the stats are 

Most sacks

Most takeaways

Fewest points allowed"
"Highsmith, albeit with less snaps, has graded out significantly better than dupree so far this year. Obviously there is an over exposure risk. Would not be surprised to see the Steelers sign a vet FA. But I do have high hopes for highsmith long term."
"I’ve been seeing a lot of doom and gloom regarding Bud’s injury and while it is a loss I don’t think it will nearly be as bad as you think.

First of our front five Bud is the worst, not to say he isn’t great it’s just that Cam Tuitt Alualu and Watt are all better than him. But more than that whenever we’ve had an injury this year the backup has come in a played great, be it Kevin Dotson and Okurafor for DeCastro and Banner, or Spillane for Bush. They drafted Highsmith to be Bud’s replacement and he’s played well when he’s had a chance we just have to have faith that our front office and coaching staff know what they are doing.

So TLDR. We have an amazing front five without Bud and our backups and rookies have done a great job this year when asked to step in and Highsmith should do the same."
"Next man up

everybody thought the sky was falling when Bush got injured

i trust Tomlin more than anyone to get it done, its what great coaches do"
"I'm sick for Dupree because I absolutely love the way he plays, but I've always been curious how much of his improvement in the last two years has been because the defense as a whole has gotten markedly better, and how much of the defense as a whole getting better has been because of his improvement. They're likely both influencing each other, but we may get a more definitive answer moving forward."
"It's not that the sky is falling. It's just, imagine this defense with Bud and Devin. Our backups aren't really the problem. Our backups backups are. Bud goes out, Alex comes in. Bush goes out, Spillane comes in. Now, when Alex or Spillane come out, that's the issue -- in late game scenarios."
"Highsmith, albeit it with less snaps, actually graded out better than dupree. And it wasn’t close. Pff grade I think?"
The way I see it bud is more of a 'scare-the-QB-into-throwing-the-ball-too-soon' kind of guy than a sack guy.  Highsmith is the same kind of player.  Doesn't always get to the QB but he makes enough noise on the line that it makes the QB uncomfortable.
So is this gunna be Bud's last year?
"I have a feeling we're going to miss Bud in stopping the run game.  Bud also had a habit of putting some hard shots on QBs that don't have their internal clock properly functioning.  Bud's not going to create instant pressure unless he's unblocked or schemed free, but he does have a knack for looping around and putting pain on the QB.  I get this feeling Highsmith is going to be pushed around a bit more until he gets acclimated.  He's got a great motor, tho."
"Honestly it's not the worst thing in the world to get used to not having him anyway, there's no way we were paying that man next year, he's been playing out of his mind."
""
"That's 2 months this season he's been AFC DPOM. 

Solidifying that case for DPOY, for sure."
"It's going to be a four-horse race for DPOY between Donald, Watt, Garrett, and Howard. I think Watt has the slight edge right now."
"You guys smell that?

It smells like DPOY in here."
I think the snub last year actually helps his case for DOPY. Gives voters the idea that he’s “due” for one. Which he of course is
Now if the refs called all the holds they put on him...
Announce JJ on min to sub for bud

Minkah will probably get extended. I’d say TJ is probably the safest besides Ben. No way in hell we ever let TJ go
"Forget about safe purchases. If you like the player, you can always recognize what they did in their time here. 

... What do you mean my hockey fan is showing?"
"Troy polamalu, both an amazing steeler and played for USC"
TJ. I got his after the rookie year and I'm certain he'll be here for at least 5 more years.
Fitzpatrick or Watt are solid choices
Minkah is definitely safe. He’s got at least a year or two left on his deal.
"Honestly, I don't think there is such thing as a ""safe purchase"" these days. As we saw with AB, things change rapidly with players. It's just a risk you take. It's really too bad that there's no way to make blank jerseys look good in football (due to the numbers on both sides), the same way that you can for hockey or soccer. I've found the safest bet with jerseys is to just go with legends, which is tough when you want current jerseys."
I'm somewhat of a Minkah man myself.
A player who is on his second contract OR TJ Watt. That's all I'd do right now.

"If it was set in stone, you just jinxed it."
that and the mf leads in like 7 categories and some aren’t even close
"No forced fumbles for watt, pretty weird"
I don't agree it is set in stone because Aaron Donald is just an unstoppable force at DT who puts up insane numbers considering his position. That being said I do think it is TJ's year to win it. He was deserving last season and I think that plays into these votes.
It's down to Aaron Donald and TJ Watt. I think Myles is out since he missed games.
"Vegas odds has TJ as the favorite right now... but Donald is still close.  Garrett has fallen quite a bit due to missing games... he is almost out of contention now.

TJ needs to keep that sack lead or tied with Donald.  His lead in TFL over Donald and QB hits/pressures is already near insurmountable."

It truly is sad.was a huge fan of him until he got a huge contract and selfishness turned him into a monster.

We are 11-0 and he would be complaining on social media that he should be getting the ball more and that Ben is utilizing too many receivers."
"Idk why people have the slightest respect for AB. He was always selfish it wasn't until he got his platform til people noticed. Central michigan players went on record saying so. Plus multiple felonies. Basically shit on our logo on the way out.

Offense is much better without the toxic twins chirping in Ben's ear and throwing a fit when they don't get the ball.

And while we're talking about it, are people serious about Harrison? Not only is he old and washed up, but he double crossed us as well."
"Had a friend who booked Antonio to sign autographs at his business before he blew up in the early days.  He said he was the nicest, most humble dude.  Also, he seemed almost intimidated or shy to meet the fans (according to my friend, I didn’t meet AB).  Comparing that description to 2019 Antonio is crazy - CTE and ego I guess."

Juju will be gone after this season IMO.
Thanks so much everyone! Extremely helpful :)
We are not letting go of Juju

if they would look at the angle it’s tilted which makes the ball short notice how no ravens were getting mad because they knew the ball was across
Even though it was a first down this is still funny ngl
"we have Big Boy Ben, we could’ve sneaked it in with ease"
Pretty funny actually
It wasn't 1st down though. Either way Steelers win so it doesn't matter.
or does Juju seem to be getting a HELL of a lot stronger and tougher than he has been in past seasons? I’ve been seriously impressed at some of his yards after catch this year
"he trained his ass off last summer and got huge dude. and the difference between him and some other players is he is playing *angry* football. he refuses to get tackled until there’s 3+ DBs on him and he still is stiff arming and planting his feet down the entire time. you see some other players who are cocky or arrogant, but juju is *mad* and he is playing his ass off despite not having those huge numbers that the fantasy guys expect out of him"
He always been a punisher. See burfict hit his rookie season. I think he’s got a lot of confidence this year being the “veteran” even at 24 years old and is somewhat trying to lead by example. I think he’s always been this way but now he wants to showcase his grit to the younger receivers and team as a whole
Last game proved to me that we gotta try to keep him. He’s gonna be so important to the continuity of this offense post-Ben. He’s a steeler through and through
He's fucking built too. Thick and man made. You can tell he's sculpted because you can see it thru the pads. His fucking vice grip thighs. Suffocating thighs. Rock hard thighs. Piping hot thighs. Great arms. Great abs. A stocky chest. Love the progress his body has made throughout his youth and now as a willing eager adult
"He reminds me of a Hines ward, tough as fuck and makes those dirty area catches. Very reliable. No reason to not sign this man"
He documented a ton of offseason work that he was putting in. Seems to be paying off well for him.
i feel like he might be one of the strongest (not the strongest) receivers in the game.
Personally I think he is getting just as many tough yards as last year... he is just not getting those feature big yard routes this year since so many others can do them so its sticking to people's memories better this season.
"He used to be a strong boi, now he is strong man"
I hope he never leaves
"absolutely love the football JuJu’s played this year, it’s a huge relief to not hear anyone bitching about numbers"
He has. He's leaning more on his physicality than his athleticism. Hoping he sees his value in our offense and takes a team-friendly deal.
He's always been beefy imo. Not to mention he's always been a good blocker too

I anticipate that these things get smoothed out down the stretch to play peak playoff football."
"So. My husband knows I have an irrational dislike of Baker Mayfield that extends beyond normal rival QB dislike. I can't even explain it properly and I know it's silly; I just really, really don't like the guy.

I would really like to see Layne emerge down the stretch. I am pretty satisfied with the play of our top 4 but Layne offers length and size the others don't.

"Every game is a challenge in its own way. From most likely to lose to least:

Buffalo and Indy are obviously the biggest threats to our streak.

After that, Smith and the Football Team could pull off a shocker.

We don't concern ourselves with Ohio teams and things of that nature."
"I'd say about 30-40, but that goes up to 70 if we beat Buffalo. Cleveland is a good matchup, and Indy can be good, but Rivers crumbles under even phantom pressure, another good Steelers matchup.

Even if they resurrect Joe Burrow's knee with demon magic, I don't think the Bengals have a real good shot rn."

It doesn't matter what your regular season record is once the playoffs start, or how ugly your wins are.  The upside of this years team is ridiculous, even with the injuries.

The question with Washington has never been about whether he deserves to be on the field more.  He’s clearly a legitimate nfl quality wr2/3.  His issue is that juju/dj/claypool are all legitimate nfl wr1/2.  I’m not sure any of those three at this point are true nfl number 1 receivers like an AB/Hill/Julio Jones/etc.  But all those guys would be the top dog on a few teams or a very good second receiver.
"He seems to have better hands than Johnson and Calypool, at least right now"
When you're so deep in the WR position that you're trying to run it like line shifts in hockey.
This is what I’ve been saying the whole time
"He could have been on the field on the interception. What the hell was that package? I wanna see Vance tight, with Washington, Claypool, Juju and Ebron outside if you’re empty on the goal line. Maybe take someone out if you need to have Watt on the goal line but have him beside Ben in pass pro. 

Protect Ben. Your receivers are usually so nice. Use them instead of splitting Benny and Watt outside. I know they’re trying to be creative but it was honestly easy to see it was gonna be bad just by looking at the personnel. What the hell do I know?"
"He'll be back once we reduce the use of the run & shoot, spread 'em out, & dump it off offense.  JW is a classic outside WR guy that runs full patterns.  2nd half of the 1st Ravens game was a turning point for our offense.  Before that, we were running pretty well and seeking chunk plays out of our passing offense.  Good chance this changes again once teams catch on to the spread/quick throw scheme."
He doesn't have the wheels that DJ has.  But clearly he has better hands.
"I don’t disagree, but who is being given less time? JuJu is needed 24/7, he’s gotta be in there unless he’s getting a breather. Diontae can have bad moments, but he’s become a go to receiver and is probably more open than anyone else in any given moment, giving Ben a safe target. His drops suck, but his breakout ability is nuts. Mapletron seems to have cooled off a bit, and he’s had a few rookie mistakes, but again how do you take a guy like him off the field that had a 4 TD game earlier in the year, forces a PI once a week, and is a redzone machine. 

Idk, Washington is maybe a more consistent option, but also less likely that any of them to break a big one with yards after catch and things like that. UNLESS we are just talking about going 5 wide every down and I’d actually prefer that! Run less, throw more! Play to our strengths! One of the best point guard QBs in the league (meant 100% as a compliment) and one of the best WR groups in the league (minus the drops)."
"Well the question is where does he fit in? Do they drop Dionte, the only skill guy out? Do they sit Claypool, the giant? Or do they sit Juju the possession receiver that's coming up on a seemingly expensive contract next year? If we let Juju go, he'll drop right in.... Seems like it's almost by design.  Honestly he reminds me of Cedrick Wilson back in the day (though so washington does more), strong hands, push you back and can block, but not THE guy. He'll go to another team and be okay if he doesn't take a team friendly deal.

Edit: Instead of just downvoting this, PLEASE tell me why I'm wrong? I love Juju too, but he's replaceable with he talent we have, and I'd really like for anyone to tell me otherwise."
"Johnson has one more stop than Stefan Diggs and DK Metcalf. It’s not that big of a deal. He gets targeted a lot. Drops tend to happen when you get targeted a lot. 

Personally, I’m more concerned that the Steelers give JuJu a contract extension. JuJu and his 8.8 average just isn’t that great. People need to stop acting like JuJu is playing great.

JuJu excels in the intermediate part of the middle of the field but Ben isn’t throwing the Ball there this year. So if Ben is going to continue throwing almost exclusively short or deep along the sidelines; JuJu is the odd man out."

"I was going to snarkily reply should we trade bush this offseason?  

But I guess Spillane can be Bince replacement now.  Who is at risks of being a cap casualty."
Well this is skewed as hell considering who we played.
Spillane is playing himself towards a big contract with another team.
That list is specific to Week 12.
"Top rated by some blogger's metric is a far cry from ""best.""

But what the hell.  Offer him for Warner once trade time starts up again.  You never know.  Maybe the Niners read the same blog."

its dumb to play the victim when your team is 11-0.  who gives a damn what others say.
"All these negative posts on this sub need to stop. We're 11-0, let people dog us if they want. Talk is cheap."
"Okay, so we lost our starting center...

The Ravens lost their starting QB, RB, FB, WR, TE, G, C, DE, DT, ROLB, LOLB, and LS.

It shouldn't have been 100-0, but it damn sure shouldn't have been 19-14 either."
"Oh come on, when Brady has a bad game there are 400 articles written within minutes about how his career is over. Stop this nonsense."

"Best record doesn’t necessarily mean best team lol I’m sure there are a bunch of really great teams over the years that had one or two losses. But I agree with your sentiment. At any rate, the most important thing is that if we win Monday, we’re in the playoffs. After that, we focus on locking up that 1 seed, baby!"
Yeah but you have to remember that we haven't played anyone good yet. We have a cupcake schedule. /s
[Ravens fans ](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApFVEPo0uxBWpAvpnWcJ_OwS-6AM)
Didn’t the patriots go 18-0? I thought they only lost the bowl
11-0 doesn’t make you a top 15 team of all time lol
"I mean, someone has to be.  We're still 11-0.  I'm cool with it."
""
I like him. He says nice things.
I find it so funny that Raven fans and so many haters are getting so pressed just to argue we’re a top 3-4 team rather than 1-2
"Ravens fans in 2019: Haha! Despite missing your franchise quarterback, despite losing the best receiver in the league, despite most of your offensive and defensive line being on IR, despite cutting a veteran WR before the season was over, despite having a literal duck at quarterback, despite having a banged up running back room, despite having a coach die just as the season starts, we managed to sweep you!!!

Ravens fans in 2020: NO FAIR!!! We had COVID-19 issues that were entirely our own fault cause our management is a total fucking shit show! We don't count the Steelers beating us in our house making Jamar Jackson look like garbage with several turnovers we only care about the second game where you beat us in your house!!! If it weren't for the consequences of our own actions this game would have been played a week prior when it was originally schedule and we still would have lost just like we did the first time! It's not our fault we're firmly in third in the division behind the Browns!! WE'RE THE PRE-SEASON CHAMPS!!! RESPECT THE BROOCH!!!"
"I don't know why any of you care about that graphic honestly. It's something that's made to purposely get fans upset and to discredit the players when it doesn't matter at all. Trying to reason with people that agree with these kind of posts won't work because they'll always just say cakewalk. The Steelers know how good they are and we all know that they are a top 3 team in the league. Stop giving these things attention and just let the team speak for themself, because no matter how far we go we're gonna get memed on no matter what"
"No one ever mentions our ""cakewalk schedule"" is also the same as Baltimore's, except they got KC and New England, while we got Denver and Buffalo."
I’ve never seen this guy with a bad take
"The 1972 dolphins won 4 games within 4 points too

On top of having nobody in their division over a 0.5"
"Regardless of what the dudes saying (he’s right) the first graphic is so dumb. “Bailed out by the refs” “beat overrated team” “barely beat x team” whoever made that is obviously a Steelers hater that can’t give credit where credit is due. We have some really great wins this season, yeah there’s a few games we went into that could be considered “easy” but if you’re still trying to discredit us as an 11-0 team you’re just wrong. Plenty of teams have easy schedules every year and we’re only the what 16th team since the merger to start 11-0? We’re really fucking good and you’re objectively wrong if you’re trying to say different."
"Thank you, Matthew, very cool!

Also on the close games thing, it’s funny how everyone says we shouldn’t play close games with bad teams but when we actually blew out the Bengals and Jags it’s discredited because...they’re bad. Pick one!"
Say it louder for the fuckers in the back!!!
An “ugly win” is better than a “pretty loss”
"Wins super bowl

The Steelers are the weakest team to win a SB"
"The ref bailout shit gets my blood boiling everytime. Every year, every team gets a lucky call. Pittsburgh has been on the other end of some really shitty calls over the years, so has everyone else in entire fucking NFL. not even considering the actual facts of the calls, people act like the calls were literally the most egregious calls ever made, when in reality it's the same shitty calls made every year. One more thing, Jessie james caught that fucking ball."
He said there's no such thing as an ugly win. He clearly did not watch Wednesday's game.
u/savevideo
"Its funny seeing Ravens fans try to argue that we have an easy schedule even thought it’s basically the same except for 2 games.

The Ravens play the Chiefs and Patriots.

The Steelers play the Broncos and the Bills."
Dude if we win the super bowl they’re gonna keep saying we had an easy schedule in the playoffs
"I agree a lot with what he's saying, but I do have one small disagreement. I think ""Ugly Wins"" are absolutely a thing in the NFL. It's not necessarily correlated to the final score, but you can tell when teams/players are playing to their potential, or close to it, and when they aren't. For example, Ben really didn't play an ugly game, but the receiving corps as a whole did. That turned a game that could've had a larger score differential into one that was closer than it probably should've been. So, in my mind at least, it was an ugly win. But, as long as they can take it to, and win the SB, who cares about how ugly the wins are."
"I'll say this. The 2020 Steelers don't feel like an 11-0 team. It seems like they've had to fight, and scratch, and claw their way to every win. Six of their eleven wins have come by one possession, two were hard-fought wins against bad teams (the Broncos and Cowboys) two more of those one possession wins came against teams that were struggling at that moment (Texans, 2nd Ravens game). I will also say that the two games that preceded the 2nd Ravens games were blowouts against bad teams, so maybe the Steelers are showing off their greatness this year. Is there something I'm just not seeing."
"By the time the season is over, we will have played the Ravens twice, Browns twice, Titans, Colts, Bills. 

Seven games against teams that are - at the moment - playoff teams or would be if they hadn't lost to US twice (Ravens) and might still get in. 

No one will be able to say ""tHe STeeLeRs HAveN'T plAYEd AnyBodY"" after week 17."
"When the Patriots for over a decade were winning their division repeatedly with two - or all three - of the other three teams in their division being absolute patsies,  I don’t recall people giving out about their “easy” schedule. You play who lines up across from you. And beating them all is difficult, even for great teams.  

If just having an “easy schedule” routinely led to 11-0 it would happen every year because there’s always a decent team with a weak schedule. Guess what, it doesn’t happen because it’s hard to do. And it deserves some plaudits."
I think with a slightly more hard schedule we'd be a 9-2 team. I also think the Patriots played in a different division than one where they get to whip on 3 usually subpart teams for 8 games a year they'd be a lot less dominant.  Funny how that narrative never gets mentioned.

"I want to boil this down to a venomous poison, tip some darts with it, and blow those darts into the necks of everybody I know and don't know."
His takes are always honest and not bias in any way
Hah! Promote that man!
Yep
We do win ugly though
Yooo big facts
"Love the casual comment. Gameplanning can be a hell of a thing. if youre team is better at it there's a good chance you win or put up a fight against a good team to show what you can do (bit biased but Tomlin last year was a good example and a bit of Kyle Shanahan this year)

Sometimes there are inconsistencies, but qbs on average complete 2 /3 of their passes per game. Everyone makes mistakes, its just how you deal with them that separates the good from the bad. Steelers have had some slow starts, but they still find ways to be successful/not get blown out when mistakes start happening."
"To confirm just go to [https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2020/reg/](https://www.nfl.com/standings/league/2020/reg/) and sort by ""Net Pts"":

* Steelers +129
* Chiefs +110
* Saints +101

In conclusion: the Steelers are a good football team."
People forget we’ve been on the opposite side of the score for years.  I’ll take this scrappy group anyday
I feel like we are took the spot of the pats that everyone in the league hates us. But I'm kinda used to it as a lifetime Bayern Munich supporter in Germany
matt has the most unbiased takes on sports internet tbh
A win is a win. If you win by 1 or 100. Ill take an ugly SB win over an loss any day. Or any ugly win over a loss.

No no no the obvious move is to put Ben at OLB and sign the ghost of Sammy Baugh
Clay Matthews is a free agent because he is too old. Jayrone Elliott will probably get signed to play STs in place of Highsmith/Ola at times to give them rests.
"At this point, I wouldn’t care either way. Highsmith is the guy going forward, anybody behind him is just there for depth. If the coaching staff thinks Matthews can add valuable depth, they’ll sign him. If not, it’s next man up."
"I am going to say this in every thread I see people metnioning signing some old FA.

&#x200B;

I would rather we get Skipper Tuzar again. Dude is young, healthy, knows the system and is just hanging on the Titans practice squad. That being said, Highsmith is the next man up."
I'd rather see what Highsmith can do. He's the potential future. Next man up.

Yes he could because he sucks lol

Please turn in your terrible towel and don’t drink Iron City til 2021. Good day sir
Maybe give Highsmith a chance??? From what we've seen in his limited time he's been solid. After the way Spillane stepped up for Bush im not going to doubt our backups until they show they can't keep up.
Just stop.
You're gonna get a lot of hate but i like the idea. It would be just an extra little stab to the heart of Ravens fans. Like Steelers fans when Harrison went to NE.
"We drafted Alex Highsmith for a reason. Why would we want old ass LBs who haven’t played this season, longer for some of yalls suggestions"
TALK YO SHIT HILLIBILLY
I agree with HillbillyHaven on this sub for once.
"Facts. Preach it!

Same crowd was saying the same when Bush went down."
"I don't know what everyone else is thinking, but I don't want Harrison back on the team. But I do celebrate him as an all time great Steeler, and I'm just happy he and the team seem to have buried the hatchet."
I didn't see anyone really implying these guys would be saviors.  Highsmith works start and get the lion's share of the time.  The new person would be depth that could possibly give positive contribution in limited time while the starters are getting breathers.
"I'm not sure your point here. We need to rotate TJ and Highsmith off the field. Is Ola going to be our only depth decent guy? I know we have someone else on the roster or PS but that's likely not better than someone with NFL games under their belt.

Signing a washed up LB with lots of experience as a 4th stringer would be great very wise."
[deleted]
I mean. I'm fine either way. I just grew up a huge Harrison fan but was too young to truly appreciate how good of a player he was. I just think it would be cool.
Who said this? I know for a fact ive been calling for more reps for the guy before this injury bullshit
"Not to seem un-alarmist, but maybe see how Monday goes and assess from there? I don't know."
Sign me up I can be an elite outside linebacker
"Highsmith has been good so far. I have faith in him. Plus, it will be good to see what we have in him before the draft this year with Bud certainly leaving in the offseason."
What about Clay Matthew’s??!
Deebo unretiring.
But James Harrison is just sitting at home. He could get at least 10 sacks out of the rest of the year.
Honestly why not give Harrison or Wake 5-10 snaps a game? Tj and Highsmith will need rest too.

I have a handful. That way if I have a Steelers watch party I can share with those that don’t have one or didn’t bring one. Clearly your dad was a loyal fan! Go Steelers!
I sentence you to the black towel.
"I have two towels. One I refer to as my ""playoff towel."" I've had it since 1994 and only bust it out for the playoffs. 

The other is my weekly towel that I purchased at Heinz Field (I'm live in Seattle now) before the rematch game against the Seahawks. My girlfriend and I called out to a cop on the sideline, explained we flew from Seattle and asked him to rub our towels on the grass. He rolled his eyes and looked at us like we were stupid, but he took the towels and actually walked about 20 yards to the end zone and rubbed them there. We were stoked."
My dad still has the mustard colored rag that he pulled out of my mom's rag pile after Myron called for people to bring a black or gold towel to the playoff game.
"This is my towel. There are many like it, but this one is mine"
"I have had the same towel since ‘95 and it’s crossed four oceans, been to 51 different countries, and was at the birth of each kid."
We used to wave bath towels before Myron got in on the act.
Sorry for your loss buddy.
I only have one and it’s never been laundered. My wife suggested it one time and I almost left her. Kidding.....kind of.
"We have a signed Franco one, it only comes out in very special and rare circumstances."
I get shitfaced at games and lose them multiple times a season lmao
I have one from my days at IUP after a wild night that I have 14 years later. My sister is due to have her first child this year. I made sure to buy her the baby's first Terrible Towel. It is signed with love from Uncle strategery_man
Sorry to hear. God bless
"I have about 15 different terrible towels but I mainly only use 1. The rest are just collectables at this point. Holiday themed, Superbowl ones, things like that."
We buy one at every game. Realllly hoping to get another one next season.
"Same here

This is the way"
"My most special towel is also the one that is permanently locked away- my son was born in Pittsburgh the day of Super Bowl XLV, he was wrapped in a Terrible Towel in his bassinet at the hospital."
"I do film work. One time a LA guy commented on our Terrible Towels. I jokingly said that when you're born, they send you home from the hospital in one. So everyone had one. Later, I found out that he believed me and told one of the Producers.

For real tho, ""if I ever hit he Powerball"", Imma provide those towels to hospitals haha"
We got our towles when we treated ourselves to a game for our 20th anniversary!
"I have my original-style towel, plus a few of the commemorative towels. I also have my dad's towel which is noticeably more rough and used than my towels."
"I have two, an original and the one that was released after Super Bowl XL with the logo, score, etc. My dad collects them, he has some framed that are autographed, and for the last few years I've been getting him different themed ones for Christmas, his birthday, and father's day. Just bought him the Renegade-themed one for this Christmas."
"I had two, one from my father and one from the game I actually went to (hosting the Rams last year). Then my grandfather gave me about a dozen and I'll never want for towels again."
"I have a terrible habit of forgetting to bring my towel to games so I have to buy several new ones each year. Not this year, but in normal years. I own dozens."
"Yes! I have a really special one, it’s was a gift from my best friend and it’s from the 2011 winter classic. I dropped it into a toilet at Heinz field during the 2015 playoff game where we lost to the bitch pigeons. I pulled it out and got a garbage bag from the snack bar to take it home and wash it. The only thing in the toilet was fresh water but that’s still nasty, but I wasn’t willing to sacrifice it."
Respect
I inherited my grandmother’s when she passed. Some drunk hoochie Saints fan swiped it from me at the Superdome on Halloween. Still bitter about it.
My old school towel (like the one you have pictured) never leaves the house. They don't make them like that any more and I'd be pissed if I lost it. I have a couple of newer ones that I take to games with me.
Same.

"Here is the argument the analyst drones would use,”okay I see that stat, and I get that they have the most wins against teams with winning records...but hear me out! They didn’t look good doing it. “"
"The most annoying thing about this incessant talking point is the pointlessness of it all.  We play the Bills, the Colts, and the (I still say they're shitty) 8-3 Browns on the road, down the stretch.

If we get handed a couple losses, oh well.  Maybe we were overrated.  (Or, ""our record was overinflated.""  Hard to be overrated when everyone says you're overrated, I guess.)

If we handle our business, nobody's going to be looking down their noses at us with an insane record and a raft full of wins over winning opposition.

Either way, we'll be headed into the postseason with roughly the amount of respect we deserved all along.

Please, entire world: give it a rest."
"Just saw a video of a Patriots fan and he said that the Steelers are overrated and that Ben is trash because the Defense always comes back to help us, which is true but it's not seen in every games that the Defense only brings points to the game"
"Easier said than done, but would love to see how Mahomes reacts to being hit.  He's kept fairly clean all the time.  Some team needs to try and punish him physically and see if he holds up."
And I was here convinced that our schedule was indeed easier
"Even if the Steelers have ahad a cakewalk, so fuckin what lol"
"Media logic 

Browns: Baker had sore ribs

Titans: Gostkowski whipped on the Field Goal 

Ravens game 1: Minkah should of been flagged for helmet to helmet 

Ravens game 2: That should of been delay of game, if Trace' the goat' McSorley started they would of won, but half of their team was on the Covid list"

If we beat the Football Team and therefore sweep NFCE will it count  that we also beat whomever becomes NFC East champ?

I noticed this live. Horrible missed call.
But but everyone told me the refs handed the game to us
"Cam said, ""Hold on, son"""
Yelled at the TV for that one.
"Its not just us, refs havent been calling holds like past years.  I suspect the league told them to hold off for more offense/points."
DAMN! Cam had his man completely beat and was running full steam ahead for it not that hold. McSworley would've been absolutely smacked!
And Watt being held in the end zone that resulted in a TD
"It’s a bad no call sure, but I’m sure someone could make a comp of all our favorable missed calls by the end of the season that’s the nfl baby."
Jeez this is worse than Bosa in the Super Bowl.

It's not holding if you grab the jerseys I thought?
"That would set a terrible precedent if they called that holding on Cam.

Offensive linemen, yes including Steelers, hold the jersey in some way or another during the play."
""
"Similar to what the other guy said, we sign every free agent QB, demand they take a league minimum. Offer the Texans a 5th round pick for JJ Watt"
We implode and become the new Browns. Our first several picks in the next draft are QBs. We fire Tomlin and Fichtner. Sign James Harrison back.
"Fire Fictner and Butler. Give Juju, Watt and Minkah 15 year contracts."
With this sub? Every FA that’s either a massive draft bust or old and washed up will be signed
"We would be 0-16 every year and confused why the 8 QBs on the roster aren't winning us games when we are rotating them through week by week and nobody lasts more than a season. We'd also fire coaches constantly, never have a draft pick because we'd trade them away for QBs, and resign players from our childhoods because this sub believes they'd probably work as a rotational guy despite being 10 years removed from the NFL."
We sign JuJu to a 5 year 90 million dollar contract. We then wonder why our offense sucks so much and why we can’t re-sign Minkah and Watt and then trade our better receivers for Sam Darnold
"Anytime something went wrong, someone would get fired immediately."
What others have said plus sign Daronld.
Before or after I open a vein?
"This sub?

Fire Tomlin, attend a KKK and/or Trump rally, and go on a date with our cousin."

Baltimore....worst 6-5 team ever...
"Compared to the Steelers the Ravens play the Pats instead of the Bills (which is an easier matchup), the Chiefs instead of the Broncos (which is a harder matchup), and the Steelers instead of the Ravens which as of last year would seem like easier matchups, but now we see the Steelers are a more complete team. 

It doesn't matter because the Steelers have done better against the same opponents, but this is just stirring the pot for no reason"
Making the SOS argument is stupid. Every team is 0-0 week 1. It changes literally every week from there.
"Steelers didn’t make the schedule they just play it. If they were 6-5 or some other dumbass record they would say Steelers aren’t playing very well. Which is the same shit they’re saying now. What’s great about the pros is winning is everything and style points don’t mean dick. Just win baby, win. STEELER STRONG!"
"The Ravens had the easiest strength of schedule heading into the season because they had two games against an 8-8 team, whereas the Steelers had two games against a 14-2 team. This is how math and numbers work. I'll always wish an organization as large as CBS Sports would choose to run content that looked a little deeper than that, and produced content that acknowledged some more context. But, obviously, they have to look out for their bottom line first."
"Actually ours is easier because we have to play the Ravens, and they have to play the Steelers.  Tough luck for them, tbh.  It's hard having to play such a good team twice."
"""Don't be surprised?"" Funny thing is, I'm not."

I've seen waaay too many people take this seriously
Imagine a washed up guy bitch about not getting enough snaps? No thanks I’ll take Alex Highsmith
Highsmith
would be a cool reunion but not sure if it’s a great idea...
"1. He’s 42 years old. No way is he going to be effective. No way he has the speed to get around the edge. He had 3 sacks in his last season. 

2. He left on bad terms. He was falling asleep in meetings and was resentful of Watt. He wasn’t happy for Watt’s success. He wasn’t being a team player. A big part of the success the team is having this year has to do with chemistry. Bringing in Harrison could easily screw that up."
"If he and the coaches can properly communicate with each other, he’d be a great ROLB to rotate in on 3rd and long situations. But really, that’s all he should be used as. If James understands this, and doesn’t get upset when he may only get 4-5 snaps in a game, it’d be great. If he and coaches aren’t on the same page about the role he’s being given, then it could become another locker distraction that’s not worth having James on the field.

I like Highsmith, and I think he could turn out to be really solid, but he’s still a rookie and having a vet like James to put in on those “we need/should get off the field here” type downs would be incredibly valuable."
No.

Steelers are one of the few teams that run their own shop and sell Merchandise. Check the Steelers store.
Steelers Shop should have some!

I love that man but that’d be really ignorant
"No thanks. I vividly remember him forcing his way off our team like a pouty baby, then going to ring chase with our most hated rival like it was no big deal."
"No room for Deebo’s ego. He couldn’t handle backing up TJ and Bud, what makes you think it’ll be any different backing up TJ and Alex. We have plenty of warm bodies if that’s what the argument for is..."
He's doing well in his retirement. No need to come back.
League minimum as depth in case the other two are complete trash. Shit if he takes attention off of TJ why not. Would be nice if his last game wasn’t wearing an Al Qaed...errr Patriots uniform
"Everything that needs to be said about this is in the article: 

*lost his job to Arthur Moats*

Deebo is washed and can’t play in our scheme anymore."
The only time a 42 year old should be on the field is if they are conducting an interview. Love the man and don’t want to see him carted off the field. Many thanks for some amazing years with the black and gold.
still bitter about him going to new england
"I think part of the reason this team functions as well as it does right now is that we were force fed a large humble pie last season. The starters learned that if you start one game, it doesn't mean you start the next one unless you prove yourself and the back ups learned that sitting on the bench one game doesn't mean you'll do it all season.

It's unfortunately a lesson Deebo never got. I appreciate his willingness to play, so I don't blame him too much for going to the Bungles and the Patriots. He's a football player first and a Steeler second, unlike Hines Ward, who was a Steeler first and football player second and would rather retire than put on a different uniform. I can respect both.

Deebo wanted out of the game to spend more time with his family because he realized he missed some moments of his kids growing up. That can do a lot to a person and who knows where his ego is 3 years later.

Let's just assume he wasn't at Bradley's for a routine check up because he lives in Pittsburgh and he's been his doctor for some 10 years but for ""official"" business… If it was made clear to him that unless both Highsmith and Adeniyi also get injured, he is not going to be a starter. That he would be there as a mentor to them, get to play the occasional snap but doesn't count on it and most importantly that he doesn't bring drama into the locker room, I'd be okay with him coming back.

I may be a fool for this, but I believe that eventually, those egos take a back seat and I'm willing to believe he's changed over the last 3 years."
It would be the ultimate redemption story for Deebo. I wouldn't say no but he should only see the field if Highsmith and Ola are incompetent. Other than that he should just be the mentor we wanted him to be.
I'd take him back in a heartbeat. I love that sonbitch. I like to pretend that his anti Tomlin commentary and his stint with the Pats never happened.

"Ah, the good old days of having a having a backup QB I wasn't afraid to watch."
I miss this dude
"We named our first-born son after Charlie Batch (and also his great-grandfather, but mostly Charlie Batch)."
Ahh yes. The days when we didn’t have to dread using a backup QB. Batch was awesome. By all accounts he does quite a bit in the community still to this day.
"[This game. ](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/tbt-that-time-steelers-qb-charlie-batch-beat-the-ravens-in-baltimore/) Charlie Batch, you’re in my heart forever."
What's the story behind this guy? I just joined Steelers Nation this year and I don't think I've heard of him 🤗
Batch was a back up that could have started on another team.
Him and Leftwich have been my favorite back ups.
"C$! In case you didn’t know, he QB’d the greatest game ever QB’d...by some arcane measure anyway, somehow. https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/11/19/charlie-batchs-186-yard-two-pick-game-has-espns-best-qbr-ever/"
I mean Ben was the backup for Maddox for a little while....
Personally I think our best back up QB was Big Ben when he was a back up for a week and a half. Also fuck Tommy Maddox.
"Happy birthday, you son of a batch!"
I missed Charlie Batch so much last year.
In Batch we trust
Love this guy. His last game against the Ravens is one of my favorite Steelers memories.
"Saw him start in Tampa. I remember it was like Pittsburgh south. So many terrible towels and had the whole end zone section chanting ,”Char-Lee! Char-Lee!”"
Love Charlie batch. He was reliable and solid. Much rather have him than mason Rudolph
Love him & Stan on SNR 🏈🖤💛
He beat the Steelers in OT coin flip game.
Mr Get er done Batch one of my top 3 backup qbs... Happy birthday
Does Slash mean nothing to you ?
"I'm going to confess here that for Ben's first couple of years, I kept saying we should bench Ben and start Batch"
"I dunno, Foles has a pretty strong resume for best back up of all time.  A super bowl and tied for most TDs thrown in a gsme(7)"

Imo we needed a loss or two before going into the play offs to get us in that “hungry” mindset. We are far from unraveled though that’s dumb we’re going for that Lombardi!!
We had 21 rushing yards we did unravel
Maybe being undefeated caused our tight play? but I think an L was needed to loosen us back up and play better if that makes any sense
Were we ever truly raveled though?
This headline was written in week 1. They just had to wait to now to use it.
Did they not? They were pathetic last night.

">Pittsburgh has been widely known since I was a kid to produce and USE TEs for both blocking and run and catch scenarios especially short yardage. 

Damn how young are you?"
Can you list the tight ends that the Steelers were known to produce and use without saying Heath Miller
"Seriously guys what the ever loving fuck are we gonna do. Our defense has taken some massive hits and our weaknesses are starting to become blatantly obvious now that we can’t lean on them as much as we had throughout the earlier part of the season. Ben is still playing phenomenally and even with the drop problems I think our receiving core is easily top 5 in the NFL, but good god man.. this run game is cringeworthy. 

14 carries and less than 30 yards??? I know the Redskins have a dominant front, but they are primarily known for pass rush and have been exploited all season by running backs. I love the Steelers and want to be as optimistic as the next fan, but it’s time to wake up and smell the roses. No matter how good we are compared to most NFL teams, if this run game doesn’t get fixed and fast, I promise you we will not stand a chance against the Chiefs. The drops i’m going to chalk up to a mentally exhausted receiving core after a consistently stressful schedule that doesn’t seem to be getting any more relaxing with the games ahead, but that’s the only excuse I’ll allow. This offensive line needs a massive overhaul, I can’t be the only one who saw them all get blown up on just about every running play we had. 

Last complaint (for now) why the hell don’t we scheme for Dobbs at all?? Dude can run! Look at what the Saints have been able to do with Taysom Hill all year and tell me we couldn’t do some similar things with Dobbs to spice up the offense a little and maybe open some things up. Wtf is Fichtner doing out there, is there any creativity left in that old brain of his?? We do the same thing every damn game, of course it’ll eventually not work. As good as Ben is, nobody wins in this current NFL by passing 60 times a game. This isn’t the fucking 1930’s man! We were 11-0 because of Ben’s outstanding play and our gorgeous defense and now our defensive machine is missing some it’s key cogs. Tell me I’m overthinking it if you want to, but I’m legitimately worried for the post season right now. And as laughable as it sounds, the Browns CAN still beat us out for the division if we continue to suck it up. **Rant Over**"
"What are WE going to do? Bitch on Reddit, pray hard for improvement, watch the injury report every day to see if Spillane/Haden/Nelson/? is going to be OK, and tune in on Sunday night to watch the game.

I know what you meant, it just struck me funny."
If they dont have more than half a dozen drops in each of the last two games they win both games by multiple scores.
Is this really how fans are acting after the first loss?
"I do agree that I too would like to see Dobbs activated to run qb sneaks on 3/4th down and inches and at the goal line. To me it seems that Ben doesn’t like to run the sneaks, but we need that part of our game. We don’t need to reinvent the offense, guys just need to execute better. Too many drops, missed blocks in the run game and bad passes. I think the sloppiness is due to reduced practice time and night games. All season long, the Steelers have been playing 1 pm start games with a few exceptions in Dallas and vs. Cincy. The players won’t make any excuses, but I will since I’m just an unapologetic fan of the Steelers"
The number one reason it's important to run the ball in the playoffs is time of possession. You can only stop someone like Mahomes so much. Our defense could play great on half of their possessions and yet they give up 31 pts because we cant keep the ball on offense and they have extra possessions to gash our tired defense while our offense is flabbergasted why our 2 yd passes cant generate good offensive drives.
We are screwed lol
[removed]
"Well... that could be a good thing. Let the sportscaster world keep saying how shitty we are. Maybe the players will see this, get pissed and refocus for another run.

But personally? Between the injuries and the scheduling issues? I think we’re worn out. They desperately need they Bye week. But I don’t know if they can get it together enough to win out."

"I think losing now is a good way to realize that we haven’t played particular well recently.  But I don’t think Washington technically earned that win, we played like trash."
I would be lying if I didnt say I was a little bummed tho
Yea it sucks we lost but maybe it humbled us and woke us up for play offs
"Whoa.

Hello.  LoL"
Imagine losing to a team literally called the football team!  LOSERS
""
They need to utilize James Washington more imo
Nearly half of those have been in the past two weeks
My theory is that Ben hasn’t been practicing a lot with the team recently and the receivers aren’t used to his heat.
It feels unfair to put JuJu on that headline photo
"I guess the silver lining is that this is very fixable. It's probably a combination of lack of focus with lack of practice. The loss should be a wake up call to refocus, and now we have a normal amount of time to practice again. I expect to see this team to come out inspired to bounce back next week. 

I don't think losing is ever a good thing, but I'd rather it be now than in the playoffs."
"Most points this season 38 twice.
32 & 22 pass attempts those games respectfully.
Fewest points this season 17 & 19.
53 & 51 pass attempts those games respectfully.
Rushing yards for the 38 point games 129, 138.
Rushing yards for lowest point games 68 & 21.
The 68 yards isn’t the lowest output but those are ugly numbers for any Steelers team to have in the rushing game.
I never thought I’d ever say this but I am jealous of the Cleveland Browns running game. That running game with Ben and our stable of WR’s would become another Steelers dynasty like during the 70’s. Just stating facts and hoping for the best.
STEELER STRONG!"
I havent seen this many dropped balls since freshman year of high school
They’re also 2nd in the league in passing attempts.  You’re gonna see dumb drops when Ben is throwing bullets 50 times a game with limited practice on a week-to-week basis.
"We're throwing the ball too much. If we don't establish a run game before the post season we are not getting to 7 this year. Ben throws the ball with a lead, tie game, deficit. You name it, he's throwing the football. I didn't fact check but my eyes tell me that We're throwing the ball way more than those other teams so naturally we're bound to have more drops. Our receivers aren't the problem."
Put their asses in a cold storage warehouse at 4°F with a Juggs machine and make them catch balls until they can catch 200 in a row with no drops.
I believe it has to do with Bens ultra short release time... notice all the big catches were after Ben moved outta the pocket..
"I’m fully expecting a second loss this week. Ebron posted on Twitter the “the fire has ben lit”, but I doubt it. Hope they prove me wrong."
Should just be a pic of just that stone hands Diontae
When I read his quote before the game I was waiting to see how many drops this dude had. Park his ass on the pine and let’s get Vance back in there
Take Juju the hell out of that picture.  Those drops ain’t his fault
The crazy thing is close to half have been in the last two weeks. Obviously the Steelers are a warm weather team this year. Let’s move the team to Arizona for games the rest of the season. Haha
Ebron was terrible.   Now I know why Colts and Lions fans hate him.
I am going to pull a Trump to make myself feel better.. *We have the most drops because we throw the most passes*
Wow
"Can we make a new rule for this subreddit page where we just don't make a million posts and comments complaining about everything. The pens page has a weekly post called F**k it Friday and they (try to) limit all their negetive energy into that post. I'm a huge Steelers fan but seeing every post just complain about the refs, covid, fichtner, dropped passes etc this is not the Steelers legacy to be a bunch of complainers. Steelers nation is about the hard working people who get the job done without making excuses."
Finchter slander is fun though
"Fr, embarrassing that Steeler fans are having meltdowns on Twitter and FB too"
"I say let people say whatever they want as long as their some validity to it and it adds to the conversation of what can make our team better. It’s been less than 24 hrs since the loss, let people vent for a day and then let’s see who needs to chill after that"
"Agreed!!!

Can we ban all the lame “upvote party” posts?  At least complaints can be insightful.

I try to post more posts on constructive criticism. At the end of this day this is a sub on a social media platform the point is to post and generate feedback . I
Personally feel the same as you where the crying and bitching is kinda annoying. Realistically there is nothing we can really do. All I can do myself is post things that I find people will enjoy reading and not flood the same stuff over and over. Try to have fun and hopefully more people can adopt that philosophy, I’m not at all saying what I do is right or wrong either , just I guess my 2 cents on it.

Except the memes. They make me laugh / cry.
No fuck off. You complaining about people complaining is pathetic as well
Yeah guys. Can we ONLY post sunshine and rainbows on here ALL the time?!?
"Imagine being 11-1 and the only loss coming on a week with only 4 days off. With multiple starters out and losing by one score ending on great tip pass. And people crying for people to be fired or cut.

How many games have we won with a great defensive play? That team has a good defence got the best of us. Grow up people, we have the best record in NFL and are going to be in the playoffs. Move on"
"Lol no where have you been all year? Not just gonna change it cause we lost one game.

I recently joined r/Steelers and just left this morning. So many low values posts
"YES! PLEASE THIS! I don’t really visit other teams subreddits, but I’d be surprised if any of them were as whiney as this one. There’s a difference between criticizing mistakes/weaknesses and just flat out crying like a baby.

It’s Tuesday fam
"~~Taking nothing from Alex Smith - what he's overcome to make it back to the field is beyond impressive. But Ben's injury absolutely had the potential to end his career as well, just not his life.~~

~~If Ben takes this team deep into the playoffs and makes a Super Bowl run vs. a WFT that may make the playoffs in the weakest division in history, does the award still go to Alex Smith? I know it's a bit ridiculous for this to bother me, but if the award is just ""eh make it back onto the field, great"" then I get it - Alex Smith had more to overcome. But if it's looking at what you achieve once you come back...Ben outright won 11 in a row and it could've been more if our receivers had hands and we didn't have Randy on the sidelines throwing darts at an open playbook that only had passing plays in it.~~

~~I suppose my question is - does the level of what you're coming back from elevate your chances of winning this award? So if Cell regenerates from self-destruction but Piccollo is able to hold his own vs. the best from other universes after losing an arm...Cell still wins the CBPOY award?~~

**Edit** - I did a little looking, and y'all are right. It's not the come back that matters; it's more the odds. Sorry to be a grump in the morning. It's been a bad ~24-hours. Mods can pull this if they want...or leave it up and I'll take my licks. I deserve it."
He lost it to smith last night
This award is entirely narrative driven and there is no planet where Ben makes a better narrative than Alex Smith
Well Smith beat Ben in a game so theres that.
[deleted]
Alex Smith won it the second he stepped on the field weeks ago. Theres literally no contest between the two. Yeah Ben is having a great year after his elbow injury but thats peanuts compared to what Alex Smith has endured.
"Has Ben played better this season? Yeah. Has he been winning football games? Yeah. But he came back from a pretty routine football injury, albeit a difficult injury to go through at his age. 

In contrast, there was a high chance that Smith would get his leg amputated, an even higher chance that he would never walk again. Playing in the NFL again was out of the question. But he came back! Not only that, but he is playing winning football and has brought life and a good playoff chance to a team that people were ridiculing all throughout the offseason and beginning of the season. I don't know how you could watch the guy drop back like 50 times last night against this defense, with no running game to rely on, making clutch play after clutch play, and ultimately winning the football game in the greatest upset of the season and not realize why he's the clear favorite. That performance screamed CPOY to me. 

You could say it's about narrative, but TBH, I think Smith deserves it, especially if he continues winning. Has Ben had a better season? Absolutely, but Smith has come back from so much more and is still having a pretty damn good season himself."
I'd vote Smith
"I was watching the game last night and before the game, they showed the ""comeback player of the year"" clip for both guys, how they got hurt and how they got better. They're showing Smith laying in a hospital bed, learning how to walk again, showing the damage done to his leg and what it looks like now. For Ben it was like...here are my stitches, and here's me wincing while the bandage comes off.

Fact is, Ben was only going to not come back if he didn't want to. He had a very routine procedure and it was his decision on how much he wanted to rehab it and how much he cared to come back at 38.

For Alex there were legit concerns of death or amputation, and even when they saved the leg the idea of him coming back was ridiculous. Is Smith having this amazing year statistically? No. In fact his numbers are pretty bad, but he does have two 300 yard games which I don't think anyone would have ever expected. They've won 3 in a row, including knocking out the only undefeated team in the league. Yes, Ben is having a better year, but what Alex has done simply should not have been possible.

Another thing to put this into perspective, imagine if Shazier actually came back. If he wasn't the same player, and only played as a rotational piece, would you not 100% call for him to be CBoY regardless of who else he's competing with?"
well if our receivers could catch the easy ass targets Ben is giving them his stats would be way way higher
"Not sure he ever had a shot once Smith had a 2nd game started... some were saying if Smith didn't even play a down he'd win it, but I think that would have been met with some reasonable complaints.  

But hes playing, starting and winning... Ben might be a runaway 2nd place, however, 1st place is even further away then Ben is from the rest of the pack."

"I'm annoyed we played like dog shit but I find it funny how many fans of other teams we already beat are acting like this is the end of the evil empire because we lost a single game against an NFC team on a short week with numerous players out, missed practice, and various injuries hindering both sides of the ball.

And to boot this thing even further we've still got control of the #1 seed of the AFC, the AFC North is still well within our control, and our 11-1 record shits all over the Browns at 9-3 and the Ravens 6-5 

I'd rather lose a game now than have this happen in the playoffs and pull a Ravens."
Lol Washington fan trolling. That’s nice you beat us and your team is the best in the division. With that being said I believe Steelers will go further than Washington if Washington makes the playoffs.
Why would anyone cry about losing one game?
Can confirm.
"11-1 and we'd have to win out for the first seed either way (win or lose last night) assuming KC does. Really not even that upset about this loss. I do get annoyed by all the obnoxious takes, but that's been happening all season. Like a week ago everyone was talking up WFT as an up and comer and now it's ""lol see Steelers play down to their opponents lmao am I right"""
The WFT has won the superbowl! The WFT has won a regular season game
We are miserable whenever we lose. It’s a reality. We’re putting on the smiley face because we still have the same goal of a championship and we can control our destiny to the 1 seed but just winning our games.
"Last time WFT won a super bowl was the year my little brother was born, he's a year shy of 30 now. Things could be a lot worse, thanking god I'm not a WFT (not even sure what to call that clown franchise anymore since they lost their name like a bunch of losers) fan today tho."
I expected them to go 0-16 this year and expect them to finish 11-5 soooo...

"If Steelers beat the Bills, and Browns, Colts and Dolphins lose we clinch 2nd seed or better. Also they don’t play easy teams (ravens, raiders, and chiefs respectively)"
I honestly think we’ll finish 13-3 or 14-2.
I question our ability to make it deep in the playoffs if we can’t hold the 1 seed. This team desperately needs a rest.
"Can’t believe I’m saying this, but Ravens please beat the Browns. 

I’m going to go throw up now."
Steelers still favored by 1.5 points visiting Buffalo off a short week/strange 12 days. hmmm
"It's not.
 
A win would be nice.  But going into the playoffs as healthy as possible, and playing well *then* (at the end of the regular season, and carrying momentum forward) is way more important.

14-2, 13-3...even 12-4...are all excellent fucking seasons.  Then, hopefully you're peaking late and you make a run.  I don't mind that we had a little downturn mid-season.  I mind even less that we got to do it while still piling up wins.  We got our lull without any meaningful consequences."
All that matters this year is winning the 1st seed.  Not going to be easy.
if we finish 12 - 4 i'm pumped
"They gotta win the rest of their games (at bills, at bengals, vs colts, at browns) if they even want a shot of a 2nd seed or higher"
Beat the bills that’s funny
"I think there are 4 major keys to yesterdays game that contributed to that loss.  You may disagree or just don't care which is cool, but this is my amateur breakdown of the game.

&#x200B;

1. Washington had the perfect defensive recipe to beat us defensively.  They have a solid D-line, and only needed to rush 4 down linemen all game.  While this didn't result in sacks, it did result in Ben only being able to throw quick passes to underneath routes.  I pulled out my calculator and the math checks out, 4 man rush results in 7 in coverage.  This is why we saw most under routes go for anywhere from -2 to 5 yards at a time.  This also was prevalent in the run game, which is a different issue for the Steelers by itself but even more prevalent against the WFT. (most teams can't get this kind of pressure with 4 d-linemen, but against teams that can; we need to figure something out offensively to combat it)
2. The run game, nothing to dissect here just... the run game. BLEH.  1st and goal on the one yard line and we can't punch it in, hurts my soul.
3. Drops-  This is an obvious one, but there was even more of an adverse affect that took place yesterday and last week that resulted from these drops.  Drops have ended drives for us the past two weeks.  3 and outs killed our time of possession.  As a result, the defense took a major hit in have to play harder and make bigger stops and that's when they started dropping like flies.  Does Bud tear his ACL if we convert a couple of those dropped passes last week?  Does Haden go down if we convert on 3rd and long to JuJu late in the game?  Spillane?  Hell, I haven't gone back and looked at the DBush injury, but is there correlation to drops in that instance? Drops are bad, but when drops take a toll on an aggressive physical defense because of playtime; that's even worse
4. Trust in our kicker.  Wright was sufficient for the extra points and chip shot field goal.  I don't know if the kid could have or would have made those other kicks but it comes down to this.  If you have a kicker on your practice squad that you can't even give an opportunity to kick chip shots against a 4-7 WFT, then there needs to be a better job done of who is the kicker on the practice squad. Just for example- FA Kickers available right now- Sebastian Janikowski, Mike Nugent, Matt Bryant, Caleb Sturgis, Chandler Catanzaro, for fucks sake Phil Mother Fucking Dawson is available. You wouldn't sign an OT that can't block to the practice squad, or a LB that can't tackle.  My only point here is put the right guys on the field to be successful, ""next man up"" means you have to trust the next man up no matter what position it is. 

Feel free to downvote, disagree or discuss below, I just felt like I needed to talk this loss out with you guys.  We are 1 win away from clinching a playoff spot and no matter who we play, this was a wake up call for some of these guys.  I'm loving this season and 11-1 is nothing to scoff at.  Anyone hating on the Steelers right now is probably still sucking the tit of the KC Chiefs even though they almost lost two days ago to the Denver Broncos.  It's the NFL and you can't win em all, you just have to win the last one."
I feel things like drops are signs of fatigue starting to show. It's been a brutal stretch of games.
I’d like to see James Washington and JuJu get more involved in the pass game. They have the best hands of our receivers and can still make the explosive plays. Ebron’s drops are hurting us but that’s what we signed up for when we signed him
"I feel like Macfarland (McFarland?) needs to get more work running it when Snell is ineffective. He shows goes speed and if he can break even a few for moderate gains they’d have to respect the run more. Our O-line also needs a lot of work this off-season.

I also think our playcalling has been poor in close games until we go into hurry up. If the ball wasn’t tipped and picked off I have a hard time believing they would’ve stopped us from getting at least 3 there."
"at this point in the season the run game is not going to improve, we’ve seen what we’re going to get. JC coming back will help slightly but overall i think that part of our scheme is dead for the season"
" 

1. 3 and outs killed our time of possession. As a result, the defense took a major hit in have to play harder and make bigger stops and that's when they started dropping like flies. Does Bud tear his ACL if we convert a couple of those dropped passes last week? Does Haden go down if we convert on 3rd and long to JuJu late in the game? Spillane? Hell, I haven't gone back and looked at the DBush injury, but is there correlation to drops in that instance? Drops are bad, but when drops take a toll on an aggressive physical defense because of playtime; that's even worse

I think this is the biggest reason why we have had so many injuries on defense. The offense needs to get their shit together and give the D time to recover."
I don't think Wash had a perfect defensive recipe there is an easy recipe that every team is using now. Teams are just rushing getting hands up and having LBs and safety's 5 yards off the line to disrupt the 35 4 yard passes a game.
You guys are all forgetting the whole offense is out of whack without Pouncey. The timing on every single play is off. That has a huge effect and one of the main reasons the offense just looked off. Yes the injuries on defense made a difference and of course the drops. But it looked like Ben was having to wait and react on every snap
I'm just glad we lost honestly. We didn't deserve to win and this offense is about to worst I've ever seen. It's mind blowing we got this far before we lost.
[removed]
Diontae for all his drops should be a big part of the gameplan but I agree that Washington should get increased looks. I think he is our most underrated player.
We have to have lost at least 200 yards on drops by Dionte at least.  Some of his drops were on deep passes that would’ve scored.
"Diontae is one of our best WR’s. Sadly he can’t catch, but he’s constantly open. Quit overreacting."
Who cares what they deserve. Diontae gets targets because he gets open
"You have a point, and I agree that dropping easily-catchable targets should drop you down a peg or two on the pecking order, especially when James Washington is your fourth or fifth option.

But when you start saying Johnson is the worst WR in the league, that's where people start telling you you're overreacting, and rightfully so.

Why are yinzers so bad at constructive criticism? Why can't you look at a talented player with tons of potential and just point out that they need to work on some things without jumping straight to ""he's the worst in the league, he needs cut.""

Same with coaches. It's been about 13 straight years of yinzers bitching about our offensive coordinator. **13 years** of ""he should be fired immediately"" after every loss, hell even every win where the offense struggled. Regardless of whether the offense is top three in the league, or the team is 11-1, it's always ""fire the coach, burn it down"" and never ""man, I wish we could just make these few minor adjustments to fix these couple issues.""

Yeah, DJ needs to fix his drops. Yeah, Washington deserves more targets while DJ is figuring out how hands work. But **no**, DJ doesn't deserve to be cut or traded for a 7th rounder or some shit, and he's definitely not the worst WR in the NFL."
"Than Diontae? Nope.

But he deserves more for sure."
"He had two ""not great"" games in a row and ya'll ready to burn him at the stake. WTF!? He still scored. He's at least getting open more than JuJu has. Does he need to step it up? Yeah for sure. But damn, ya'll are ridiculous. Same people who were ready to get rid of Washington two years ago."
"I think we all have to realize that lack of practice, rest, and just overall the situation the Steelers have been put in this year is taking its toll. You gotta think how many times you show up to work with less than ideal sleep and how lackluster your day can be. They aren’t super beings they are still just regular people and although they are for sure a very talented team, it’s a surprise they have shown as much resilience as they have to be 11-1 in my opinion."
I don't think so. He's a young receiver still developing. Steelers brass think he's the next AB.
[deleted]
More than Diontae is a stretch but he definitely needs to see the field a lot more.
They all deserve more targets then Ebron. He has been a drop machine the last two weeks
Get has always had his preferred receivers and he forces the ball their way. He’s forcing plays the Ebron and Johnson now. Finchner doesn’t have the cred to overrule him.
He deserves more targets but not over DJ.
My fantasy team says otherwise
Now im hearing that they cut Claypool snaps lmao. Didnt even consider diontae was the one hurting the team
"From all the highs and lows of yesterday, leave your final thoughts/analysis/discussion/takeaways from yesterday’s game.

This thread is intended for level-headed, mindful discussion and less knee-jerk reactions. Keep this in mind before commenting.

As always **DON’T BE A DAMN JAGOFF.** Follow our rules. We all have different opinions and mindsets, but we’re all here to talk Steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day. Keep it cool."
"People complaining that we're getting smoked by the media need to get over it. We lost and have played bad for 2 weeks against teams that (on paper) we should have trashed. This is what happens.   
If the lockeroom doesn't like that fact, beat the bills on Primetime and show who we are."
Us sucking
Our offense is too good and has too many weapons to have monumentally under achieved the way it has in the last 2 games.
"Im not as brilliant as some of you are in things such as scheme and stuff. But it seemed in the 4th quarter that Ben started to call more plays and we started to move the ball more. That is a very bad look for Fichtner.



Also, can someone explain to me what Charlie Batch meant about OL not disguising the runs? Should I be worried more about all the starters we lost yesterday or the Washington member called Ravens ""exposed us?"
"The running game is the worst i've ever seen from the Steelers. 

We have to rely on a 38 year old Ben to throw 50 times a game to bail us out."
"Our 70s teams finished 12-4, 14-2... we can afford a few losses and luckily it was a game that doesn’t affect our seed. RELAX everyone. We have time to work out the kinks."
"We’re going to know what kind of team we actually have really soon. Buffalo on Sunday. They’re a good team. 

How does this team respond? Let’s be honest here, they’ve been progressing downwards. The offense can’t run the ball. The line sucks. Will Pouncey coming back to anchor the line improve that? Are they really that lost without his pre snap calls? Possibly. 

Why are our talented receivers stone handed all of a sudden? 

The offense HAS TO figure out how to put up points in the first quarter. The D can’t carry them the whole way. The injuries piling up on the defensive side support that. They’re getting gassed, and the offense can’t give them enough time to rest between drives. 

How this team responds on Sunday night will be very telling for how the remainder of the regular season and playoffs will go. They’ve been riding high on an undefeated streak. All the while hearing chatter from all angles calling them frauds, that they’re not as good as their record would indicate. Then they drop this stinker to Washington. Do they come out and put a hurting on Buffalo? Shut down every aspect of their game and play a dominant 60 minutes and win? Or do they turtle, and drop two consecutive. The snowball effect that can have could be devastating."
"It’s been a while since we’ve lost a game like that one last night.. I was confident that we were going to drive the ball in the last two minutes for at minimum, a game tying FG. The tip ball at the line and interception by former Steeler Bostic was as disheartening as any loss in the last 3 years.  The bounce back is always sweeter!!"
"James Conner was the MVP of the team last night.

He didn't even play, yet showed he is LEAGUES better than Snell/McFarland despite our overall piss-poor run game.

I hope everyone appreciates that.

Randy Fichtner needs fired into the sun."
"Need to bounce back, get back to running as our defense can’t carry us we need to control the game"
If you go for run plays on Madden without beeing under center you usually get 0 or 1 yard. Just like we do in real life. I don‘t understand why Ben is so stubborn. I know it‘s not THE problem but it‘s part of it
"The offensive line and the general offensive game plan have been a problem for weeks and it finally came back to bite them.

First thing I would do is move Feiler back to tackle and let Dotson play LG. Chuks has been getting beat pretty handily, and I think it's also starting to take a toll on Decastro. I think this ends up solidifying the interior and the right side of the offensive line.

On offensive gameplan, here are some things to do to make it less one dimensional:

* Get Ben back under center more. I know he loves shotgun so he can survey the field, but it's just one of many facets that make this offense one dimensional. Running out of shotgun is hard as it is, let alone behind a suspect offensive line. Getting Ben under center - even if you're still passing out of it - at least makes the front adjust to different things.
* Bring back the jet sweeps and motion, but also use them on passing downs (not just as a clear indication of a run).
* Attack the middle of the field in the intermediate passing game. It'll create space for your running backs to run, and it will help to open up so much of that underneath stuff. With that said...
* ... start throwing past the sticks on 3rd down. The offensive design is not strong enough to create space for YAC the way that Kansas City, New Orleans, etc. do. You have good receivers who can make plays down the field. The drops are annoying, but it doesn't matter as much when the defense has three guys ready to make a tackle short of the sticks."
"If we aren't running the ball, we need to get JW more looks.  He's been our most reliable receiver for over a year and we keep him buried on the depth chart."
"The most heartbreaking thing about this loss was that it never felt like we were really going to lose until we did at the end. Sure we had trouble here or there and it was always close, but it felt like we had it and then it just went away. I feel like maybe that's why we did end up losing. That in our defense just needs time to breathe."
Well that was fun
We were high on our own supply. Time to buckle the fuck down and hit Josh Allen in the mouth.
"Steelers need to have at least the threat of a run game Otherwise it’s far too predictable. I’d also like to see more creative play calling. On third down, I don’t want low % passes to a backup running back.  If the WR can’t fix the drops, and the defense gets hit with injuries, they could be in trouble next week."
Tomlin putting the WRs on notice in his conference right now.
"Chase Young can fuck right off. “The Ravens exposed something in the Steelers.” Yeah, that you had an extra week of rest and preparation. Douche."
Does our offense suck or has the league figured us out?
"Gonna try to keep this one short and sweet with two main points:

We are 11-1. First place in the north. First place in the conference. One and only team in the AFC to currently hold a week 1 bye. We control our own destiny. We are fine. No, we shouldn’t fire Randy. No, we shouldn’t Tomlin. You guys need to relax. Do you know how many people would kill to be 11-1? I promise you that these issues are fixable. Firing a coach would just cause more harm, so stop even entertaining the idea. 

I am a firm believer in complimentary football. Both the offense and special teams are simply not helping this defense and that needs to change. They are on the field far too much and often times in poor field position."
"I'm not overly concerned.  With respect to the Ravens ""exposing"" us and WFT capitalizing on it, (1) the Ravens are very familiar with what we do, and vice versa and (2) if WFT was so tuned in to what we were going to do, was it their game plan to get down by two TDs? That makes no sense. Yeah, we can't run all that well, but there are other playoff teams with that issue - KC is middling at it, Miami and Buffalo aren't all that great at it, either, and WFT has one of the better young DLs in the league. The biggest concern is the drops. It's one thing for Ebron to drop a pass here and there, but yesterday was ridiculous, and the same for DJ. Clean half of those up, and this game is likely a double digit W. 

I am concerned about the injuries on defense, though. We've already have a big hole in the middle losing Bush, Spillane has been solid as a replacement and now he's injured, losing Bud obviously is rough, and missing two very good CBs is obviously problematic. 

In short, I'd like to see how we play on Sunday night before hitting any panic buttons."
"Time to see what adjustments are going to be made over this week. That is going to be the tell tale sign of what kind of team we really are, and who our coaches are. 

Coach T can come out and say whatever he wants about how badly we sucked and be brutally honest as he has been, but none of that means shit if this team doesn't actually change.

One of the most disappointing things about this loss is I think we were all expecting to see some sort of damn change in our offense from the Ravens game to the Washington game, but NOTHING did. Playcalling remained the exact same. RF is completely holding this offense back with his atrocious playcalling and play design. I think making him the OC was a damn mistake regardless of how close him and Ben are. Randy isn't working out, it's so clear and teams have figured out our damn vanilla ass offense. I don't know what can be done, but if Ben can just somehow call the plays with being able to fall back on the QB coach and back ups for advice, that would be the best possible solution at this point. I don't expect the Steelers to just fire Randy at this point in the season, but he's just not working out for us."
"I think having to play with JC Hassenauer instead of Maurkice Pouncey these last two games has been much more of a detriment to the offense than anyone has let on.  

I just can't imagine them having the same level of ineptitude in the running game and short yardage situations with Pouncey available."
"Here's how I know I am not objective about this team: I keep thinking they're doing things to keep them off of film so they can run them in the playoffs. No jet sweeps for weeks, no outside runs, no middle range passes."
"Not beating anyone by being one dimensional. Can't run the ball + drops = not sustaining drives. A good way to burn out the defense fast. I thought after the Ravens game it was a good thing that they were disgusted but apparently it was for show because nothing changed. 

We'll see what Sunday night brings but they've got another tough game and on the road."
"I’d rather play shitty and lose than play shitty and win, these coaches and players need to fix a LOT and the loss really highlights that. I’m tired of squeaking out wins when we should be putting teams away. 

I’m also realizing that the schedule changes have totally screwed us, everyone is getting hurt and as we were losing last night the D just looked like strangers out there. We really need Spillane, Haden, Nelson, etc healthy out there."
Why did we cut Wiz?
"First and foremost, we are 11-1 so remember the sky isn't falling. Personally, I was hoping for 10 wins and a playoff berth this season which means they have already exceeded my expectations.

That being said we have an obvious problem, other team's DBs are sitting on the short pass game because we are one dimensional. I don't think this is a Ben or Randy issue but a Ben AND Randy issue. This is what both of them like, Ben in shotgun throwing 50 times a game, so in my mind it is irrelevant who is calling plays because they will both default to the same style of offense. Be prepared for more of the same going forward, 50+ short passes, a few deep sideline throws, and 10ish sidecar handoffs from shotgun. 

Our defense is showing cracks but I think some of that is attributable to a lack of complimentary football and some comes from a loss of major contributors to injury. If we were able to posses the ball with regularity our D would look much better. 

Sadly, I doubt we are going to get much adjustment from Ben and Randy on the offense. That isn't going to get us to the Super Bowl unless Bush and Bud magically heal up so the D is back at full strength."
Why did Claypool get so few snaps? Actual question. If that was Finchner’s plan and he’s not hurt or anything then we legitimately need to fire him because Diontae and Ebron were playing like absolute shit
"Poorly coached game. WR’s can’t catch. Ebron can’t catch. Run game was absolutely horrendous. Defense gives up too many big plays, especially on x and long. Defense misses a lot of tackles. Why sign that K if you can’t trust him to hit a 45 yard field goal? 

You can only play shitty for so long before it bites you in the ass. If we play like that against the Bills we will be blown out of the stadium. 

Tomlin ripped into this team on Wednesday and they still played like dogshit yesterday. They better wake up next week"
"Learn how to catch the ball and get even an average run game going and we can finish the year strong. We weren’t exactly great running with Conner and Pouncey. But it’s even worse with them out.

Defense is getting thin so ball control becomes even more imperative."
When it comes to the playoffs I think the defense can keep them and win them games but I feel there's real concerns with how reliable the offence is. They don't have a great running game and I feel like every receiver except Washington has an issue with drops. I think they're trying to do that New England style short passing game but good defences like Baltimore and Washington have started to figure out how to slow it down
"I knew we were going to lose the minute they had the drive after going up 14-0 and they ran 2 passes on a 3 and out inside the 2 minute warning (also was ridiculous the refs gifted WAS 3 points; officiating was terrible in this game btw). You CANNOT win a game throwing the ball 50 times and not being able to run the ball especially while having the lead.

Ever since the Tennessee game it’s been obvious the Steelers can’t run the ball which is why they can only win ugly, whereas in the beginning of the year they were dominating their opponents because they could close out the game by running the ball and controlling the clock.

If they fix their O-line run blocking and become more balanced on offense they’re a super bowl contender, if not they’re going to get smoked in the playoffs."
"1-Have to get back to fundamentals on pass receptions. Looks like a lot of putting the cart before the horse and not finishing the play/catch

2-Fix/solidify run game. We do not have Bettis anymore. We need to find ways to help Snell and co succeed. Is missing Conner hurting? Yes, but shouldn't completely tank the run. Otherwise we're going to get jammed up passing ALL. THE. TIME. 

3-Defense looking more beat up and depleted daily. Wonder if they need to figure out a different game plan to close up the middle of the field now"
"We have a weird offensive line that won't allow Ben to be sacked, but can't run block for shit... what the hell?"
We are still 11-0 with BosGod.  All hail the 🐐
"People are talking about the pivotal moments in this game: failing to punch it in on 4th and 1. Critical calls by the officials. Alex Smith walking off with the ball. Ebron not getting out of bounds at the end. The batted INT in the 4th quarter.  

Sure, all of those being different could have won us the game, but if it's just those moments that change, are we proud of the game otherwise? I'm not. Whether we squeak out a win or lose like we did, here's what matters: *we played 4 quarters of bad football.*  

I hope this game is a kick in the pants. We've been sliding into mediocrity for weeks. Playing good football wins in the playoffs. A bad football team who squeaked out 16 bad victories doesn't make waves in the postseason."
"As frustrating as the past weeks have been, I can't help but feel for our guys. It's hard enough to win 11 games in a row in a normal NFL season, but this one has been extra trying. Hope they can find a way to rest and get out of their own heads."
Can we just try to have Watt lead block and Conner follow behind? Just try it old school once or twice. Please.
All yesterday told me is that if Alex Smith was 100% all year The Football Team does not have 7 losses.
"Tomlin's presser after the game was good. I appreciate how blunt he is, talking about routine plays routinely, and how the receivers at this level are paid to catch these passes, and they will be replaced if they can't do their job. Hopefully he fires the squad up for Buffalo. That is probably our biggest game yet, although the Browns might pose a challenge too."
"We need Conner. Even though running backs are easy to replace and he’s likely gone unless he signs a really cheap contract, not having a running back who can be reliable can hurt the offense. Last night clearly showed it."
"If we're being honest the win streak was amazing and fun but we were stumbling a lot in a few games...


Our goal isn't am undefeated season, it's the stairway to 7. This loss doesn't change that.


Learn from it, don't do it in the playoffs."
It could just be me but did anyone else feel like Jaylen Samuels made no effort to stop Bostic intercepting that batted ball? I watched in slow mo quite a few times and he was only a couple yards behind it and made zero effort to stop it. Yeah I understand it may have not meant anything since we had like 12 seconds or something but at least there was a sliver of hope
Remember when we scraped into the playoffs on a 6th seed with a mediocre team and won the super bowl?
"I saw nothing from Alex Highsmith that shows he can pressure the QB...at all. Dupree’s injury pretty much ended any Super Bowl hope

It’s good we lost one regular season game. It’s better to be 15-1 than 16-0 when we inevitability get destroyed by Kansas City; avoid getting completely humiliated as a 16-0 team"
I have confidence that we will be able to fix our issues as they are blatantly obvious. I’d be more worried if it was unclear what we were doing wrong. So identifying the issues should not be hard for our coaches. Just need to buckle down and fix them.
Any idea why they're not using Jaylen Samuels at all in the running game?
I’m sad
Sphincter Fichtner is an actual problem and really needs to gtfo of Pittsburgh.
Defence made so many bad plays. TJ tried to get up while a loose ball was under him. 66 got a play that reset the downs and cost us a touchdown.
I’m blaming dropped passes. I think if you fix those we win this game.
"This is not related to this season at all but I’m curious what everyone thinks about the qb situation in Philly. After announcing that wentz was benched for jalen hurts I can’t imagine the eagles have much in the way of future plans for wentz. According to sportrac there is an out in wentz’s contract after next season (didn’t look in depth at it so not sure who controls that out). Does anyone believe wentz has the ability to be a high level qb in a different organization/should we take that gamble if the opportunity arises given we are playing with a somewhat injury prone 38 year old qb currently?

Edit: I may be blinded by how hilarious it would be if a guy left Philadelphia for Pittsburgh and turned back into a super bowl caliber player. A man can dream."
Whoever said yesterday “Inb4 a member of the 72 dolphins says something about being the greatest undefeated team ever.” Literally called it lmao. Damn Larry Csonka
"Have to figure out how to get our run game going. Doesn’t have to be a masterful run game but it should be more positive plays than negative. At this point I’ll appreciate anything over negative yards. The drops aren’t the worst thing ever, but it seems to come at the most crucial part of the drive. Fix those and we’ll stay on course for #7. The defense isn’t a worry for me because chiefs won last year with a middle of the pack defense. They just got stops when they needed them. For the love of the football gods, duct tape, spit, super glue, or whatever the hell we can do to piece together some consistency on offense."
"Zero creativity in the play calling. We used to be able to swap out different backs and consistently get good yardage out of them. I know WSH had a run defense, but not even trying to squeeze a few running yards out of Snell every once in awhile to keep the chains moving REALLY paints the rest of the offense into a corner

Also, Kick the FUCKING FG. We don't want to let the rookie kick a FG in the 2nd/3rd quarter because of obvious reasons. Yet we were going to rely on him to kick the game winner with 5 seconds left? Makes no sense, offense couldn't score the entire first half and we're still not taking the points."
"They need to readjust Juju's role in offense, I don't think he's being used to his full capability so far. That and James Washington needs to start getting significantly more playing time imo. If that means the other guys have to take a step back in terms of time on the field, I think that's ok"
I feel like we don’t appreciate James Connor enough and we might’ve won if we had him.
"Can someone help me understand why the offensive line can do well at pass defense, but is unable to move the line and be effective in the run game? I get that Ben is getting the ball out quickly, but besides that... I just don’t understand offensive line play, and isn’t it the same players from last year? What’s the disconnect? Last year our run wasn’t this bad."
"Scheme wasn’t a problem. Guys were getting schemed open, we just didn’t execute. 

Miscommunication on defense is hurting us at critical moments.

O Line needs to be as energetic on runs as they are on pass protection."
Benny Snell is doo doo.
"Randy Fichter is so bad at calling plays, I rather rehire tod Haley"
[deleted]
So how did Claypool’s date with Losing go?
I may be blind or something but Is Vance McDonald hurt?
SEE YOU GUYS IN BUFFALO :)
"Man look bottom line is we’ve been fucked at every corner this season, from getting an early bye week, to injuries, and to game reschedules, them boys are tired. I think this loss will definitely help us a lot more than hurt us. On top of exhaustion they have had to deal with constant bullshit from the media and fans of other teams that were patiently waiting to take a shit on Pittsburgh. It’s all good, a perfect season isn’t the goal, winning the SB is."
I would rather of saw James harrison out there vs Highsmith. Dude was fucking invisible. They have to go out and get someone else. He didn't even get close to Alex Smith.

"Honestly, after seeing the way he responded when it happened, I'm taking that as good news.

I like what I've seen from Williamson so far, but they're going to need to play a bit more dime moving forward to cover the middle of the field."
"I’m not even worried about home field anymore. I just want the best, most rested version of the Steelers in the playoffs. Hopefully the Cleveland game won’t matter."
I’ve said this way too many times this year but next man up. Avery Williamson time.
The thinnest position group just got thinner.
"It's unlikely to be covered by non-Pittsburgh media since the biggest superstars on defense -TJ, Minkah, and Heyward- are all healthy, but this defense is absolutely gutted with injuries. Both starting corners are battling injuries. They lost an elite edge player for the year. The starting ILB *and* his backup are out. Players along the DL -starters and depth alike- have been on and off the COVID list.

I know I often tell off ~~the naysayers~~ people who want radical changes that won't actually help, but if the Steelers lose @ Bills on Sunday and the Browns beat the Ravens in Cleveland on Monday, we're looking at a mere one game lead for the division with the Week 17 finale looming. We're talking about keeping pace with the Chiefs for the 1 seed -so losing to WFT, an NFC team, is preferable if they're going to lose any game- but honestly I think it's fair to sweat about the division!

Edited my comment. I don't ""tell off the naysayers"". It's perfectly fair to criticize the team and point out flaws. I only tell off the batshit insane people who say ""This team isn't perfect so fire the coaches and that will fix all the problems!"" I'm not thrilled with a lot of Fichtner's choices from yesterday, but how stupid do you have to be to think ""Fire him with no backup plan"" will automatically fix whatever you don't like, while maintaining whatever you do like? No, your fat ass on the couch seeing Ben making adjustments or Dobbs wearing a headset, does not mean that either of them can become the regular play caller."
At this point if we’re not losing guys for the season I’ll take it. Home field doesn’t mean shit for these playoffs anyway. Our defense is depleted of starters and we just need to squeak a couple more wins.
Is UG3 healthy?
Tough hit but silver lining is that he should be back in a few weeks. Holding on to the number one seed is gonna be tough but lets remember we are still an 11-1 team and anything can happen in the playoffs. Anyone know if Gilbert is getting close to returning? It's gonna be Bince and Williamson but we could use some speed. I guess Allen could play more.
"Big miss, he was playing superb. Real old school Steelers football player"
This is actually good news. I thought he was another one done for the season.
Bless all the knees.
Good thing they made the trade
Sucks that we have 2 key defensive players down. Our defence didn’t adapt at all last game and made so many miss play.
"This is a bigger deal than people seem to think. This guy was the green dot on the defense, and being on the team for as long as he had was familiar with the system. Theres a reason he got it over Vince and its crazy to think Williamson can just step into that role.

Look how out of position the defense looked at Spillane went out....its going to be rough next week"
You know it's bad when the backup gets injured
That's amazing news honestly!
"Really have been enjoying Avery Williamson on his limited reps so far. Seems to play the ball fast and solid tackler. He should step in just fine.

I am more concerned about Alex Highsmith."
[removed]
He and ebron are getting an insanely high amount of targets. Diontae is getting targeted like he is davante adams. This team needs more james washington
Jimmy Wash needs to see the field more. Always makes a play when called upon.
Our luck it'll be above freezing in Orchard Park this Sunday night... /s.
"You’re right, and his multiple 100 yard games before this week were meaningless. I say we just cut him, he’s the worst."

Here’s to hoping we won’t be using chase for this again 😂😂
"I mentioned in the game thread (ugh) that I'm not seeing it with Snell. It was not a popular take. I don't get it, what do you guys see that I'm not seeing? He's a downhill, zero cut runner who is easily stopped if he doesn't get momentum.  


On the other side of the junior coin, is McFarland. I think he's got potential if he can just learn what is a hole and what is not a hole in the NFL.  


I think Conner does a much better job than both and I really hope he's up for a stretch run."
We just have very average RB's all around. None of them do anything particularly well.
"The deal is he's terrible.

The Steelers have excelled at the strategy of taking college producers who fall due to poor metrics, then training them up in the NFL, letting their natural athleticism come out.

Benny doesn't have any natural athleticism, it turns out.  After two years of training up, he's still a one dimensional, slow twitch plodder.

Cut bait, try again.  That's drafting for you."
"You could put Derrick Henry back there and it wouldn’t matter. Watch the tape, the Oline gets bullied snap after snap after snap. They’re very bad"
"Snell is slow and has very bad vision. That can sometimes be overcome by being a pure bruiser, but he isn't that either because he's too small."
"I mean it’s hard our line hasn’t really done a good job w blocking, honestly I feel like our line hasn’t been the same since munchak left"
"He's not good, doesn't look for holes, not fast, not elusive was taken off the field for 4th and 1 after failing on 3 and 1, and they choose to throw it deep to a back-up rookie RB. That should tell you how they feel about Snell."
"Benny is alright, but he's an outside runner. Fichtner is trying to run Benny between the tackles and James outside the tackles. Dude has his shit reversed."
I miss Jerome Bettis.
He and the rest of the RBs need to go. Mcfarland is the only one that even does okay and it's because no one has really seen him play lol
">He's a downhill, zero cut runner who is easily stopped if he doesn't get momentum.

Sorry are we talking about Snell or Conner"
Snell isnt very good. He is similar to Conner in that way.
What are you expecting him to be? There’s a reason he’s only used in short yardage situations and rarely comes in for a spell to give Conner rest.
He runs like a dump truck
It's almost impossible to give any RB a fair evaluation behind the current OL
Snell is what he is...a backup RB.

"Anyone else think Mike Tomlin looked happier with a loss today than a win on Wednesday? I know losses suck, but I’m starting to think chasing get perfection was more stressful to the Steelers than it was worth."
I think he probably looked happy because he found out none of the new injuries are season enders.
"He’s probably happy that he has a legitimate excuse to make practice hell this week. If I’m him (good thing I’m not because he’s an elite head coach while I’m just a jagoff), I make these fuckers practice outside all week and make the entire team run a lap every time a receiver drops a pass."
"I think the 98 (or 97) Broncos held the same sentiment. But injuries are taking a toll on the defense. Once Spillane, Haden, and Nelson are back things should look up again. But in the meantime the offense needs to get aggressive or this is just gonna be a skid. The 09 Saints could afford a late season sputter, we can't."
"Team looked like shit, I dunno"
"Idk about Tomlin but I certainly felt that way. This team needed a loss, as weird as it is to say, to bring them back down to earth. Gotta get back to fundamentals. And if we were going to drop a game, this was the one to lose"
I think tomlins style of coaching is extreme motivating to be successful. I’m sure you run out of coaching material if you win every week. Now that they’ve lost he can open up that part of his repertoire
I don’t think he was happy I think he just expected it. He was watching his team play bad the last two and wasn’t gonna be like 👁 👄 👁 when the L came. Idk if pros still do laps and up-downs for punishment but I bet you them boys are going through something at practice rn 😂😂

If it comes down to paying someone on defense (Hilton for example) or JuJu give me the defense all day.
"People’s JuJu obsession is starting to get creepy. JuJu isn’t anything special 

Imagine paying JuJu over Mike Hilton."
"Juju went from being a legit deep threat who could run crazy routes and make contested catches against some of the league's best corners to a 4-yard slant king.

I don't blame him for that, because it's our own offensive coordinator's dumbass fault for how they are scheming him. I love Juju, but this season proved he is not worth paying. There are a TON of guys that can do what he does for this team offensively, and I seriously doubt this is what Juju wants to be doing at this point. 

Writing was on the wall last night with his reactions."
JuJu had 27 yards...pay him for what exactly?
"Not til his contract comes up. It's idiotic not to keep him cheap until then.

Edit: I just realized this post is about JuJu and NOT James Washington lmfao why did you use a picture of both of them with WASHINGTON holding the ball if you were talking about Juju lmfao"
I don’t know if Juju will want to come back. He might be enjoying it here but going elsewhere will probably be better for his wallet. He had great numbers in 17 and 18 but he’s not stuffing the stat sheet recently which will effect his next contract.
We've fazed juju out for a wr with the worst hands in the league why would we consider paying him

"* Our HOF qb is coming off elbow surgery and clearly isnt as good as he used to be and its apparent in his inability to push the ball down the field accurately, hes also VERY injury prone and aging.

* Our RB is far below average at the moment. And when Connor comes back he is at best an average RB who can only run up the middle, cant run outside the tackles.

* We dont have a true #1 Reciever, not to mention all of them are young and our WRs and TEs are very prone to drops and have been all season.

* Our Line can't block well enough to create running room for the backs, and likely cant block long enough for Ben to stand in the pocket for more than 2 secs consistently

I honestly want to know what plays we have had success with that you want us to run. It Genuinely intrigues me. The only play that works are short passes.  So i dont know what you want him to call when its so painfully obvious that we only have 1 option of play. 

Like for example, if we actually had a capable running game like the Browns or Titans no one here would have a problem with running the ball on first and 2nd down. But guess what ? WE DONT HAVE A GOOD RUNNING GAME.

#PLAYCALLING DOESNT MATTER IF THE PLAYERS CANT EXECUTE."
Stopped reading at the first bullet point. It was literally elbow surgery.
"DJ's and Ebron's drops are the only issue that needed fixing in order for us to be a comfortable 12-0.

If Ben's top targets catch the ball, we contend for a SB.  If they don't, we don't.  The gameplan and playcalling were more than good enough to win against an overmatched team yesterday.  The receivers weren't."
Ngl the whole Alex Smith “forgetting” to leave the field was bullshit. They got the three points to win the game from that. The Steelers were shitty though....like SHITTY
The first point was bad an inaccurate enough but then you claimed Conner can only run between the tackles when he is undeniably at his best when running outside.
Randy’s burner acct
"We might have the #1 pass protecting OL and the #32 run blocking OL. That’s our first problem. 

Second is Fichtner. It’s undeniable that he works well with Ben and so we’re unlikely to find anyone better until Ben leaves, but we’re not scheming people open. We’re relying on the players to be better than the guys across from them. In most cases they are, which is why we’re 11-1, but it’s not like we’re Buffalo or San Fran who are able to get guys open just based off the scheme. When our guys drop passes we’re going to struggle."
"How can you blame any of the running backs? Do you see how awful our offensive line is? The Steelers offensive line is one of the worst in the league, if not the worst in the league"
"Idk why everyone expects the offense to be good when it is poorly coached and the QB doesn’t practice. 

These guys catch balls from Rudolph all week and then Roethlisberger on Sunday. Of course they’re going to be sloppy."
One of our first 2 picks this draft better be used on a running back. Conner isn't the answer. Snell and McFarland definitely aren't either. If you can't get a yard on 4th and 1 you aren't going to win in the post season.
"We played 3 games in 12 days it’s never happened in the nfl and it will never happen again the body wasn’t built to play that much football at this level, our guys were gassed and now has the injury bug. The NFL fucked us plain and simple."

"The amount of slander and ""Steelers are frauds"" comments on their twitter was insane. I think prior to this year and being undefeated, most people didnt care that much about us. But to go undefeated for so long and not always have a high scoring game like the Chiefs, it put a target on our backs.

I was so down after the game but my friend(who is a die-hard Washington fan) told me, ""hey at least you're still going to the playoffs"". That cheered me up so quick lol"

I think that trick play really cemented it for me. When the team knew they had to resort to trickery because they couldn’t rely on our line and running backs to push for 1/2 a yard is a sad moment.
"How bout running a QB sneak 4 times. If you're worried about Ben, put in someone else"
Then take the 3 points. I wish Tomlin would accept who we are. The run game problems are too deep to fix this far into the season with the guys we have. Im much happier losing doing what we do best; leaning on defense. Instead we are trying to go for it when we already know what this offense is capable of. That was the only real frustrating thing to me yesterday.

"Throwing a fade to a guy who has like 5 catches total (ever on this team) on 4th down was also one of those ""we don't deserve to win"" scenarios too lol."
catstrophic is also what i'd call ebron's blocking effort on the 4th down run.
"Throwing it 4 yards deep on 3rd and 13 twice and running on 3rd and 10 is also fucking catastrophic, yet it never seems to be addressed"

The referee literally watched Alex Smith run right past him off the field after motioning for the ball and just stood there and let it happen. Sorry, but if you want to play keep away with the ball on offense while the game clock runs down that’s 100% on you. I know 3 points wouldn’t have made a difference in the game and I’m not at all blaming it for their loss, but it’s this kind of shit that screws the Steelers year after year and I’m fed up with it."
"You win some of those, you lose some. That’s not why we lost."
"Honestly, I thought it was a riot. That’s some old school dickery, and as a Steelers fan I respected it. Smith was playing chess on that play, and some quick thinking. Most new QBs wouldn’t have that situational awareness

We didn’t lose by 3, we lost by 6, and we beat ourselves. Good for WFT."
"As a Lions fan, how are you feeling about Ebron?

I still like Ebron, he’s loads better than most tight ends we have had recently."
"The way I see it, the Steelers got away with one last week, and if you’re up 11 on a lesser team at the half, you can’t really point to something like this as the reason you lost.  They had less than 100 total yds in the 2nd half, dropped a ton of passes in this game, couldn’t get one yard at the goal line, abandoned the running game after sucking at running all season and barely even thought about throwing downfield in the 2nd half.  And that’s just talking about the offense.

If you’re pointing at that call and the 3 WFT pts associated with it as the reason for the L, you watched a different game than I did."
Dear Lions fan. I’d like Stafford to be Ben’s eventual replacement.
We got away with one last week.  We got karma this week and WFT got away with one. It all evens out.  The game should never have been close enough for that to matter.
I don't understand why players are allowed to leave the field with the ball at all.
As a steelers fan you can't be mad at this but okay with our stunt against the ravens last week. It certainly isn't the reason we lost.
"Can’t be mad, it isn’t why we lost. Steelers are a winning franchise, we don’t concern ourselves with fourth timeouts or the play of refs."

Most would say its the most egregious since last weeks end of the first half. That's why its tough to make a big scene about it."

We’ve barely won half our games and the same issues have plagued us throughout the season. Baltimore exposed nothing. Washington just had more time to prepare and got it done.
Cool. They can know what it's like to watch the playoffs on TV.
Defensive geniuses. All they had to do was knock Spillane and Haden out of the game. Why didn't anyone else think of that?

I blame this loss completely on you
My thing was that they kept winning and I hadn’t worn a jersey so I had that thing
I never wash it until we lose. Then I was the stink of failure off it. Now I’m washing literally stink off it since it has t been washed in almost a year. Same rules apply to my socks and my towel.
Its the cunt that posted a meme of us 12-0 in the 2nd quarter.
"I wear my jersey every Sunday but because the game was on Monday I went to work and went straight to my  dads to watch the game.(because he is a huge Washington fan) So if you want to blame someone, blame me for not having my jersey 😔"
"I didn’t wash mine but I didn’t wear mine either. I was at work last night, wore it for the Wednesday game while at work and sweated my ass off all night so I opted not to wear it last night. I regret my decision and take full responsibility, sorry fam. Won’t let it happen again."
I was tired and fell asleep during most of the game :/ it’s the first game I didn’t watch 100% of this season. I blame myself. About to go buy some energy drinks for Sunday.
I did. Five seasons unwashed. I washed it prior to the thanksgiving game to be presentable for dinner. I’m so sorry
I got my Terrible Towels for yesterday's game so it must have been that
"My Jersey is still in the closet. I didn't wear it, so it wasn't my fault. (they lose every time I do wear it)"
I agree. It’s the dipshits who posted 12-0 stuff early.
I watched the game.... normally I don't because out of area
I bet on the Steelers for the first time all season....
"Was in meetings on Zoom, forgot to put my lucky jersey on.  Sorry everyone."
I can now shave my mustache.
"I’m sorry, guys. I put out a Steelers flag on my lawn on Monday. I let yinz down"
Forgot to wear my chain on game day for the first time this season:(
"I’m grateful that Ben hasn’t been sacked much this season, but the run game has been nonexistent of late. How much do you think the loss of the great Mike Munchak as OL coach is to blame for this?"
Our pass protection has still been really good. But 3/5 of our starters are 30 or older so declining was natural.
With pouncey averaging 4.2 ypc without they at 2.8.
"I don't even think that's the problem. The problem is our offensive scheme.

We use the short passing game as an extension of the run game. That means opposing defenses can have the same formation to stack the box AND play the pass. 

Also it's fucking obvious if we run or pass the ball. That makes it so easy to stop us. 

What we need to do is increase the average depth of target for passing plays. Make it 10 or 15 yards. No need to take deep shots down the field. 

Just medium shots in the middle of the field can open up their defenses so much more and then they have to choose to stop the run or the pass. Not both."
If Munchak is so great why isnt Denver's line better?
Lack of sacks is a direct result of Ben's 2 second release time on 3 yard routes. The O-line is not good and I'd bet 100 dollars the DeCastro is hurt and will have some kind of surgery when the year is over.
Very little. Our two studs on the OL are old. Time to draft another. Dotson has been a nice surprise.

Strange cause Dionte keeps getting the lions share of snaps while making the lions share of drops.
This sucks because Diontae  has had some awesome catches also
"2/80/1TD 

Big man up next."
I’m so glad he finally said it. I was getting tired of the “we suck and need to be better” it just felt like a half assed apology.
I want to know if we aren’t running power because we just can’t or because we want to stay in these personnel groupings.
BAW GAHD IS THAT JAMES WASHINGTON WITH HIS BIG STRONG HANDS?
Dionte and Ebron caught a case of Agholor Hands
Is that why Claypool only had 31 snaps despite having fewer drops than Juju and Diontae?
"I actually liked seeing more throws to McFarland and Samuels. Hope we continue to see that. (Though the 4th down throw to McFarland wasn't the best call)

A few weeks ago it would've been crazy to talk about moving passes from this elite WR core to running backs, but here we are."
"I didn’t get to watch the game, how many drops did we have?"
Stern words considering this isn’t a new issue this year. Also Why has Claypool’s targets dropped so drastically
Damn straight.
Makes Sense.
Right so when can we expect to stop force feeding 85 and 18 then?
You can clearly see the issue with Ebron and Johnson is they are concentrating on the direction they are going after the catch before the ball is caught. They need to keep eyes on the ball until pocession is made. Worry about after catch yardage after.
I agree with most of the sentiment in here that work needs to be done. Everyone needs to remember though with our current pass only offence the amount of dropped passes will rise just due to percentages.
"Pick me up Coach, I can catch."
Bring back Martavis and Wheaton. Crazy bastards but it’s their time to shine.
Better question.  Why is McFarland still on this fuckin team when he averages 1.3 ypc and can't catch.

Ravens sub has been TRASHING the Steelers more than any other sub. No other sub comes close either (I browse them all). My goodness.
I just think it’s annoying they call us frauds/worst 11-0 team because Steelers are still tied with the chiefs for the most wins against teams above .500. The ‘72 Dolphins and ‘07 Patriots both played in significantly easier divisions than this year’s steelers
"If Tomlin feels like he can smile in the face of this loss, then I think I can too."
"I mean, to Washington and everyone else, that was a Super Bowl for them. Meanwhile, it took til DECEMBER to lose the 1st one. Not sweating it."
"This is so relatable but it'll be alright. It was a terrible cocktail of bullshit from the short schedule to loosing so many pieces of our defense to dropped balls. I really hope this is the wake up that finally gets everyone on the team ready. Get Connor back and establish a run game, stop dropping passes and demolish the Bills."
"I'm dragging us (in my head) not because of a loss, but because we've played garbage games the past two weeks and haven't shown much that makes me confident in a deep playoff run let a lone a Superbowl win. Anything can happen, and I still HOPE we turn it around. But we've got problems that need addressing, and they just seem to be getting worse."
"fRaUdS yOu FiNaLlY lOsT tO a GoOd TeAm, shut up, they only got like 4 days to relax and train after beating the Ravens, that is no time at all, sure some plays were sloppy, but that’s just 1 game"
Colin Cowherd has really been laying into us
I enjoy the browns just pipe dreaming about all the possibilities of maybe maybe being able to catch up.
Agreed. They better lookout too cause when play offs happen we’re going off
Must be tough to have ONE loss.
Tbh forward looking for this team: we need to draft a qb to replace Ben.  Yes our wrs have been dropping passes but I also know that Ben can’t throw long bombs as well as he could compared to a few years ago. He can’t play forever and he will hit that wall that all qbs hit once their skill level drops.  We also need to draft a rb and te in the next draft.  Snell is not good.  Conner is inconsistent.  I’m not a fan of ebron.  Drops way too many easy passes.
"Just wait until after Josh Allen drags us on SNF. I feel like that's our rock bottom game. Our D is banged up, and our O can't run and is predictable af. Gonna be a long night in Buffalo."

may be why we didn’t see much Claypool yesterday. Will be interesting to see Ebrons involvement next week

"It is starting to feel to me like with the injures piling up and the lack of rest the team has had that we are losing our edge. In other sports, teams routinely rest people to make sure they are fresh for the playoffs. In the NFL it seems like they only do that if/when there's nothing left to play for. Typically home field advantage is something worth risking it for (or is it?) but this year that's way less of a concern than having a rested focused squad. Since we will probably clinch a playoff berth before Sunday night I feel like we should not play our starters Sunday night. Here are my reasons why I think this is a great idea:

1 - Rest our guys, avoid further injury risk, reset mentally. 

2 - Cincy coming up next week without their starting QB seems like win #12 which should be enough for the division. Playing a fully rested squad here would seal the deal.

3 - Don't give a potential playoff opponent in Buffalo any tape on our matchup.

4 - Fuck the NFL over for dicking with our schedule so badly by giving them a backup squad in Primetime.

5 - Give our depth guys some high-profile minutes since our injury situation is what it is. Improves next man up mentality.

I know we will not do this, but what do you guys think about the idea? I also think the second we clinch the division, we should shut the first team down for the reasons stated above. KC hasn't been any better at home than on the road this year. I have no fear of going on the road and winning. I do have fear of us just running out of gas and losing to anyone anywhere."
This way of thinking is the only way they go 11-5 and miss the playoffs or lose early. You can’t just take weeks off and expect to be able to turn it up a notch.
Nah we have too many flaws.  We have stuff we need to work on
"At this point you keep playing to win. Get guys reps at injury positions on D, fix issues on offense and special teams. The goal should be to win out at this point. If KC drops a game then I could see resting players against the Browns if we have the division locked. That's about it. Too many issues on Offense to give guys a break. Everyone should be playing for there jobs at WR and in the run game. 

It's not doom and gloom yet. We're still 11-1. But we should be playing like a team on the outside looking in."
i’m no coach or anything but it seems like defenses has our offense figured out like the short passes we’re working but now we are lucky to even get 2 first downs on drives. i feel like if we go back to ben doing what he does best extending plays the offense can wake up
"Get pouncey and Connor back, sit ebrons dumb ass and get McDonald in there to block (not sure where the hell that dudes been, but if he’s healthy he should be in there) and start pounding the shit out of the fucking ball, get back to Steelers football force 1 on 1s w Washington clay pool Johnson and juju and take advantage of them"
Don’t play like yesterday
Catch the ball.
I agree with your points and endorse the sitting of the starters Sunday night! Us Steelers fans should call for Tomlin to do it

Buffalo is coming up next week and its probably going to be bad"

Who gives a flying fuck? Power rankings mean literally nothing.
Well hes a joke who had us going under .500
"So I'll be that guy. I periodically watch Cowherd because I appreciate outlandish, crazy views. For the record, before Seattle played Arizona last week, Cowherd said that ""Seattle is the fourth ""best"" team that could join the top tier of teams"". He had the Steelers in his top tier of teams - top 3 in the league.

Cowherd is the guy you grew up with who broke your balls when the Steelers lost and praised them when they won. The guy you could never argue with because he had no allegiance to any team, but found a way to hate on all teams collectively.

When you learn that about him, you can start to watch him without having an overall hate for him. He takes anything that happens, magnifies it by ten and talks about it. It's for nothing other than ratings. 

The thing is, we've played like absolute shit the past two weeks. This isn't the same team from even two weeks ago, so adjustments need to be made. I'm not sure I'd put us as low as 8, but it's not crazy that we could have dropped from 1-2 to 4-5. The team hasn't played bad, they've played absolutely atrociously. We are one dimensional, lost a top edge rusher, and our one dimensional WR's look like they forgot how to catch. We are tied for dead last in the league in YPC and 28th in the league in total rush yards. Completely abandoning the run like we've been doing (53 passes/14 rushes yesterday, 51 passes/19 rushes last week) will lead to heartbreak hotel in December/January. We need to get better running the ball or we aren't going anywhere."
He's trolling Steeler's fan and getting the reaction that he wants.
I like us as an underdog
Sounds like someone’s a little hurt because his preseason projections were sooooo wrong
NFC is kinda crap this year.  92.68% chance that an AFC team wins the Super Bowl.

Lol the Rams

"I like his segments, but horrible take. Also, I think the chiefs deserve fourth at best. Barely winning the last.3 games not to mention a loss to the much worse raiders."
f@#k em
"After watching the last month and with injuries, I think it’s reasonable to argue we are on the cusp of the top 5 but TB and LA being stronger than us and CLE is ridiculous.  
  
I am concerned that we will start losing consistently or early in the playoffs. I think we can win the SB too. There are real cracks though."
"5, 6, 7????? Wtf is that. We lose one game and all hell breaks lose."
I think the saints are a one sided team. They have a really good D. I think with film people will expose their offense. I think Green Bay is gonna win that conference. Bucs are over rated but have a good D.
That's fine. We are better off when you underestimate us.
"On the one hand, the Steelers deserve all the shit they get this week for losing to a terrible team like Washington, especially considering how pathetic their effort was.

On the other hand, Cowherd is super butthurt his prediction of Baltimore going undefeated and Pittsburgh finishing with a losing record and third in the division keeps getting thrown in his face so he goes out of his way to overhype any criticism of Pittsburgh."
Can we stop giving this racist asshole attention? Please?

"Claypool has been dropping passes too recently, guess he was the casualty for Washington to get more playing time. Imo, DJ should be losing snaps to Washington as well cause Claypools drops aren't nearly as bad as his"
"All WRs are dropping passes, but only one of them has a direct replacement on the field and that's Wash for Claypool"
"Well Ben openly said Washington deserved more play time in the wake of last week's struggles...so for him to go in, someone has to come out.

Juju isn't going to come out much, so either claypool or diontae have to come out for washington to go in on most sets (obviously not true on 4-5 outs but still)."
Steelers always do this with rookies. I think it’s because rookies aren’t used to so many games being played so fatigue can be a lot worse for them. Same thing happened with Devin Bush’s snap count last year.

Claypool’s lack of snaps yesterday was criminal
"He had the third most WR snaps, so...."
At least he’s still part of team redneck in spikeball with Duck
Looks like buying that juggs machine and living on a farm over the summer paid off for him. He’s got the best hands on the team.
We have 3 potential probowlers ahead of him.  Though I think he's starting to take DJ stonehands snaps now.
Get Ebron off the field
I know he has big hands...but I really hate how he runs with the football.
We need to give Derek Watt more offensive plays. We need him for the run game
What’s the context of the joke of him being a farm boy? I never understood
Which WR snaps you wanna take away for him?
[removed]
Does anyone just get pissed off at seeing Ebrons face after a drop? He has the look of “oh well just another drop lol”. While Juju on the other hand beat himself up when he dropped the ball. Just hate how he looks after a drop sometimes and just wondering if anyone else feels the same.
reminds me of Aroldis Chapman’s fucking smile every time he gives up a home run with two outs in the 9th
Dudes been dropping balls since he entered the league
"He's the anti-Hines Ward.  Hines makes the catch, takes a huge lick, gets up with a huge, lovable grin.  Ebron drops the ball and grinches out. 

As a bonus, check this out:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NB66FQcUgLc"

I had a bad feeling this guy wasn’t going to be able to shake the drops. He has such a history of this shit idk why we thought we could fix his problem. It’s blatant he takes his eyes off the ball and tries to do stuff before the ball is in his hands. He makes hard catches look easy and easy check downs look like they’re the hardest catch in the game
Oh Heath Miller we miss you
"Droptimus prime has no feelings. Or hands, and brains it seems."
"I find it funny how you guys throw out all the good Ebron has brought because of a few drops, something that has effected the entire offense. Go off though"
Im grateful to have em. Hes def not the detroit ebron and im ok with that. No one is perfect.
I get pissed off seeing Ebron off the field. I can forgive the drops if he wasn’t such an arrogant motherfucker off the field. Like him talking shit to LeBron James because he was praising the Browns just stfu man.
Yeah that pissed me off. You don’t get to smile when you play like shit. Ebron mind as well have put on a WFT jersey last night. It left me feeling like the colts got the best part of the deal
What’s the difference? They both dropped it. Who cares about their face after.
Neither one of them should be dropping balls. They’re spending too much time on Twitter and Tik Tok and playing like bums.

Boy.  You can sure spin a tale.
This takes me back to elementary school!
"We all know that the drop problem is real with the Steelers this year. Tomlin has specifically addressed the issue by talking about how the guys who can’t catch the ball will be replaced with those who can. The consensus has been that (with this drop issue in mind) Washington needs more snaps, and Diontae needs less. But facts don’t lie, and I wanted to share the details (according to pro football reference) as to how our pass catchers are doing.
For the sake of not being too convoluted, I didn’t include RBs. The list is our top 4 receivers and Ebron.

Here is the drop rate for our guys, in order:

JuJu - 2.1%

Claypool - 5.1%

Ebron- 6.4%

Johnson - 6.6%

Washington - 7.1%

JuJu is the clear winner here. At 94 targets, he only has 2 drops. His average depth of target (ADOT) is just 5.7, as his targets are usually crossers, screens, or comeback/sit back in zone type routes. That makes it easier to catch the ball, but at the same time, the 2.1% drop rate is impressive. We trust him in third down and money time, but JuJu deserves more targets in general IMO. He needs more targets down the field, in medium routes, and in the red zone.

Chase has had some drops more as of late, but his catch rate is still at 5.1% with 78 targets. He also gets the bulk of the deep throw targets, with his average depth per target being 12.9 (far and away the deepest for the team). The deeper the routes, the more likely drops may occur, and thus far it seems like his misses are in combat catch scenarios. Him having the second-lowest catch rate with the longest depth per target is impressive.

Ebron came to the Steelers with a drop problem. However, his drop rate is better now than it has ever been. With 8.2% and 9.6% in the previous two years, 6.4% doesn’t look horrible. Vance McDonald's drop rate in 2018 was 5.6%, so not really a huge difference there. Ebron's ADOT (7.1) is similar to Diontae, and so is the drop rate. 

Speaking of Diontae, Johnson's drop rate is the second-worst among the core group at 6.6%. His average depth per target has been 7.5. His route running is supreme, fans know this, so Ben isn't afraid to throw him deep comebacks or slants. He has had drops on wide-open deep balls, however. For those who see Antonio Brown in him, AB's ADOT was 11.3 in 2018 and he had a drop rate of 1.8. The Steelers' passing game is different than it was in 2018, but Johnson has room to grow to catch AB-type numbers.

Although everyone wants to hail Mr lobster claws as the guy who should replace all of the butterfingers on the team, James Washington actually has the worst drop rate at 7.1%. He only has 3 drops, but with 42 targets that isn't great. His drop rate has risen each year, from 5.3% to 6.3% to 7.1%. His ADOT is second longest, however, at 10.7. But Washington too dropped a deep pass that would have been a TD in this season.

It may be worth noting that Ray Ray has 0 drops in 19 targets. His catch percentage is also very high, but most of his targets are behind the line of scrimmage or very short, in fact, his average level of depth of target is -1.2 (so it’s pretty much always screens).

Another important thing to talk about is the types of players that each receiver is. Claypool had fewer snaps in the game against WFT than normal, and that was to get James Washington on the field more in replace of him. Claypool and Washington are similar players. Thus far, Washington has proven to be the better combat catcher, but Claypool has more breakout ability. They are both big-bodied deep threats who can outmuscle and out position a defender. Diontae and Ray Ray are also the same type of player. They use elite quickness in their route running and to run after the catch. The group as a whole is extremely talented. But, do we want Ray Ray to run go routes instead of Claypool, or Washington to run that timing-based comeback route like Diontate that gave the Steelers a TD against WTF? I honestly don't think so. It's hard to take Diontae out and expect Washington, for example, to give Ben what he needs in that area of the passing game. The bummer of this situation is that Claypool, JuJu, and Diontae give the Steelers an incredible mix of styles and player types, if they could simply catch the football. One could, perhaps, argue that Washington could take a few snaps from Ebron and Claypool, just to get him on the field more and prove if that 7.1% drop rate will lower with more targets. It also could be argued that the traditional WR types don't matter if someone is simply a better option over another.
Meanwhile, JuJu is sort of in his own category for the team. He can do it all in many ways and is closer to an Anquan Bolden or Hines Ward than anything, players who were great and also unique for the position.

So there you have it. What do you all think? It's easy to ask for the benching of a guy for the backup, but there is likely a reason why that starter is ahead in the depth chart. Meanwhile, mixing it up could be both a wake up to the starters who are in a slump, and provide a spark with different players having larger roles. The bottom line for me, feed JuJu more."
"i feel like this is where digging deep into the stats can be detrimental, like watching the games and seeing the passes that are dropped by Tae and Ebron, to me they seem to be pretty catchable targets. Idk. it also feels like Washington only gets targets when they need a really difficult play to be made so if he’s dropped a few i can understand why. again i don’t know. they just *all* need to catch the ball man lmao"
we need juju going deep more often he is probably bens most trusted receiver and he is running screens and crossing routes when we send him deep and they throw to him he always comes down with it
Definitely agree feed Juju more but I still think they need to use Jimmy Wash more. Not a one for one benching but spread out his time with the guys. I also think they’re giving Claypool some rest mainly because he’s a rookie and used to the 12 game season plus a bowl game.
"This is highly misleading. Washington has the best hands. His “drops” if you want to call them that have been ridiculous difficulty, lucky-to-get-a-hand-on-the-ball passes."
Johnson and ebron have had more ball drops than a $2 hooker.
This is Dionte's secret reddit account.
i just think Randy needs to get his shit together
I dont think we need to bench anyone but we need to spread the ball out more imo. Why is Ebron getting so many targets? I'd rather see most of the passes that he gets thrown his way go to juju. Like every curl he runs this year he gets no YAC. We cant run the ball so we need to have short easy catches in place of the run game. They just shouldn't be going to ebron. He should be the fifth option at best and hes being targeted like hes our second.
I guess you get so used to seeing wash catch so many contested balls that you forget that he drops some easier ones
"As much as we all hate AB, that kid was always staying after practice in front of the juggs machine.  Even as a veteran.  Diontae and any other of that style receiver really needs to do the same to become a starting caliber player."
"I don’t think these whole year stats matter right now. They have 34 drops on the year, with over 1/3 of them coming in the last two games. I don’t care how they have looked the whole season, I care how they look right now. Diontae and ebron had 5 between them against the Ravens. They added to that against Washington. They are dropping balls right now, I don’t care what they did in games 1-10."
I 100% agree. We need to feed Juju the ball on plays besides screens and quick routes. If we threw him the ball all game instead of only in the fourth quarter he’d have 425 yards and 7 touchdowns every game (I know it’s an exaggeration just deal with it)
How many of these drops came in the last 2 games?
If you discern from watching the games that Washington is the problem with drop passes. Then you don't watch the game. Dionte and Ebron have a problem. It is so easy to see.
""
It feels like Washington has a game with a big play and we phase him out of the offense for 4 weeks

-Total passing yards 13th

-Passing yards per game 14th 

-Total rushing yards/rushing yards per game 29th 

A mediocre at best offense with a stellar defense. Being the 8th best team is pretty good considering all of that."
"Going off how we’ve played the last two games, I’d say we are 5th or worst. If this was a matter of potential, then I’d have more of a disagreement. 
Edit: as he probably is ranking by potential I do disagree with this chart. Shouldn’t judge a whole season on two mediocre games."
Good... I hope the team is taking notes.
We aren't top 5 until we can run the damn ball consistently
Our defense is hurt and our offense is horribly one dimensional in that Ben can only accurately throw short and we can’t get a yard on 5 plays.  Where would you rank us?
"What’s the issue? Steelers have the worst offense of all of those teams and the defense is banged up and getting run on. 

Idk how anyone can watch the Steelers play the last month and say they’re an elite team."
"Chiefs, Saints and Bills definitely. Eh on the Rams and Packers. Certainly not Bucs and Browns."
"Their job is to stir the pot and have different takes for the most part. What they put out isn't entertainment if they're just going off of general consensus or logic. It holds no merit nor validity, it's just to stir the pot and nothing else."
I prefer it this way.  The steelers do better as the underdog.  But everyone knows this is biased as fuck.
"The question really is can the offense put 24 or more up on these teams. I think our D can hold most (not KC, though) to 24 or fewer. 

Sadly, watching over the last month, I don't think so. A decent defense will shut our offense off. Ben's accuracy on deep throws is sporadic. Our run game isn't able to produce since defenses don't prioritize covering the deeper routes. Well, and our line has some difficulty run blocking. And the number of times.the routes run aren't deep enough to get enough yards is alarming. 

So yeah, we might be 7 or 8."
"I’m cool with the media not liking us. If we were universally accepted as the best team in the league, had a perfect record, no flaws on our team, and cruised through the rest of the season, I’d be absolutely terrified of getting soft and then being showed up by some wild card team with a derpy QB in the Super Bowl. 

Sports is all about overcoming adversity and proving doubters wrong, now these guys have something to prove."
"The line can't block for any of our running backs

Our running backs can't make any plays or break any tackles. They go down on first contact.

Fichtner didn't fail to extend the ball on the one yard line when Snell jumped up and held the ball under his arm, failing to get into the endzone.

Our offense gets turned into a pass-only offense. 

""Run the ball when you only need one yard on 3rd and 1!""

- so what about the 5 failed attempts at the one yard line?

""But why throw a pass to a running back!?"" 

- the pass before was a quick one to Juju and broken up. They were 50+ passes into the game. Have to do something they haven't seen. Hell, it almost worked.

""Why throw a pass to an OL?!?!?!""

- Kansas City did the same thing. Are they bad now too?

Oh and...

WHEN OVER 10% OF THE ON-TARGET PASSES ARE DROPPED WHAT THE F DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN?

Fichtner is being scapegoated like all hell. Haley was a fucking moron. Fichtner called a fine game, the players failed to execute. Want a coach to yell at? Why not the receiver coach or the OL coach? 🙄"
"The problem is he’s predictable as fuck. He is the definition of insanity. Doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result. I understand our OL and RBs aren’t that good but he has done no favors to his team. And for the record, he can’t develop talent worth a damn either"
"He’s absolutely part of the problem. 

You can’t watch other nfl teams play and think to yourself “wow the Steelers offense is actually coached well”. There’s no excuse for this offense to not score 30 a game."
">""Run the ball when you only need one yard on 3rd and 1!""  
>  
>  so what about the 5 failed attempts at the one yard line?

That's part of the problem. Why have those other 5 attempts failed? Is part of it the O-line? Sure. But when the Steelers announce that they are running, and how they are running, because they line up in the same formation they've run out of the whole game, the defense is gonna be ready.

One time one of our RBs got about 9 yards on a delayed handoff. Do you know how many times after that I saw them run that play. Not once! Meanwhile, a single back formation run up the middle? That's like 90% of Pittsburgh's running plays and they almost always go for no/minimal gain. Is Fichtner the only problem? No. Is his play calling a significant problem though? Absolutely!"
"11-1 was a pipe dream until this season. I’ve watched Steelers teams lose 3-5 of this same game every season for quite a while now. I’m glad we are in the hunt this year with some destiny control.

Could do with a few fewer injuries though."
"Fichtner has to know our oline isnt winning the line of scrimmage consistently. They can pass block, sure, but they dont open holes or drive the opposition back like they did when Bell was in the backfield. It's up to the OC to make adjustments. Like say;

- Mix Derek Watt in. (Hes played under 40 snaps all season. Its time)

- Involve the tight ends in the blocking scheme.

- Get our RBs into one on one situations and give them a chance to make somebody miss. (Connor has been excellent in space.)

- Disguise the run (play action ect). 

The running game as a whole is struggling, but the backs themselves are talented enough."
"You're right that Fichtner is the scapegoat here. Will probably get downvoted for this but if you're going to say Randy is part of the problem, then Ben is also part of the problem. You can’t say one is a problem while the other isn’t. They both go hand in hand and Ben has a huge say in what Randy does. That's the only reason Randy became OC in the first place."
"There was a chart showing run blocking and yards by running back and Conner was far and away working behind one of the worst lines and performing at above league average despite this fact. Reddit search sucks so if someone else has it saved feel free to post it. RB isn't the issue, the O'line is, and to a degree the play calling. They need to be doing a better job of disguising the run plays to give them a better chance of success since they aren't going to be doing any blocking for it apparently."
"You're basically suggesting that unless we have elite talent in absolutely every aspect of the offense, it's not the OC's fault.

That's not the case. No offense is perfect. A good OC uses the offense's strength and hides/works around its weaknesses. That's the job.

Is Fitchner ""the problem""? No, obviously not. Is Fitchner part of the problem? Yes. Is Fitchner doing anything to make the offense function better? It sure doesn't seem like it.

I think the Steelers utter failure on openings drives under Fitchner is a great example of this. Imagine you have all week to write a script for one drive that maximizes on your talents and takes advantage of what you've seen on your opponent's tape -- and you fail. Every. Single. Time."
"Very few fans have any business holding opinions beyond when they ought to set down their beers and shake their pom poms.

Listening to them criticize NFL gameplans is a real hoot for those of us with a background in the game."
Steelers are gonna lose their first playoff game either way so...

This was after a different game. Was literally posted weeks ago. They didn’t do this after last night. Stupid.
i don’t think that’s after this game but they having fun but ur right they are receivers the first thing you should learn when playing wr is to catch😂
I see less DJ and more Washington on Sunday
"""NFL players can't have fun if they lose even one game"""
This isn't either of their accounts...
Oh calm down. Football players are human. Get a life.

anyone else almost die of a seizure when he was on the ground 🤣
Now if only our offense could get going
"I know TJ rightfully gets all the DPOY attention but Minkah is really the piece that made this whole defensive click. And he’s like the perfect player, always in the right position, never takes a bad angle. Him getting the wind knocked out of him last night was the first time I’ve ever seen him get dinged up."
"And when he went down last night, we all collectively shit our pants!"
Well here’s an idea.... PLAY HIM AT WIDE RECEIVER AS WELL...
"We need to stop with the shotgun runs and try some power runs, singleback sets. Our defense is constantly winning these games for us while our offense goes stagnant for like 7 straight drives. We used to be a 30 point offense in the first 7 games but now we just suck on offense. Randy gotta just use different sets in the run game cause that shotgun draw shit obviously isnt working."
That’s an impressive stat. Didn’t knew this.
The REAL Fitzmagic.
This is the wholesome shit I like to see
That's crazy good
Well that’s freakin impressive
Wow
And zero playoff wins

I see plenty of those posts here when another rival team loses so pot/kettle and all that.
"What you want them to say? “Oh the Steelers really tried their best that game, I think they’re still really good”? No. Don’t post shit from their subreddit, it make it look like they’re in your head."
We do the same thing when they lose
About to start a JUSTIN TUCKER MISSED A KICK UPVOTE PARTY

I’m not worried it only took 11 W’s to get to this one L

The little brother is always jealous of the big dog in the kennel
like they gonna make the playoffs🤣🤣
"So the ravens are still gonna play against the cowboys after dez just tested positive today, he was on the field warming up. They don’t have to reschedule?"
This game should be canceled and forfeited the Ravens have had every chance.
"I’m watching the game and the pregame guys were all looking at Jay Glazer like “So, he had to have practiced with others, how is this not a concern?!”"
"If Roger Goodell was smart, no there would not be a game tonight. But we all know about his love affair with money so it’ll go on"
That organization and their fans are the biggest dumbasses I think I've ever witnessed . Glad we swept em out of AFC North contention
[So irresponsible from Baltimore](https://twitter.com/jonmachota/status/1336473277166981120?s=19). They knew his test was inconclusive and still let him in the stadium today. What do I know though
"They're caring about other people, went in a dumpster with a certain white suit."
No because somehow it will affect us.
"Are we seriously still whining?  Shit happens, move on."
"I think this just proves how much baloney the rona really is now. It's mutated, it's become more infectious but less deadly. Now, if you have immune deficiencies or a pre-existing illness/disease or you're elderly, sure it's still a threat. But to the average person and especially NFL athletes this isn't a life or death situation like it's made out to be. The numbers of deaths have been inflated by hospitals because they get a bail out from it. George Floyd for instance is considered a covid death when we all know he didn't die from rona. 

On top of that I personally know people who work in elderly homes with people that have tested positive for Covid-19. They never tested positive themselves but they got sick when this first happened. They are 99.999% sure they had it, but were ""exempt"" so they could continue working since they were essential. They haven't been sick since, they've built up an immunity. 

We've seen athletes like Cam Newton miraculously test positive and report no symptoms or illness at all. Now Dez gets pulled in the middle of warm ups and tests positive? With no symptoms or illness either? Seems a bit funny to me. I'm not saying this is the case with everyone who has tested positive but I think a lot of them are part of a game the NFL is playing to manufacture drama. Some of these people definitely aren't covid positive. So why are they testing positive and only being held out one week most of the time? If they tested positive on multiple tests there's no way one week of quarantine is enough to clear them of being infectious. 

Covid had become a tool of fear for politicians and media and a tool of manipulation for the NFL apparently. You can tell me I'm wrong but it doesn't add up."

if this team plays like the last 2 weeks we will get fucked by the bills
"Lol we’re not fine. No run game, all the drops, and the predictable passes won’t win us a super bowl"
Aw. Poor jets
But this doesnt allow me to be a reactionary and give in to my anxiety about my team.
Play like this against Bills and we're fucked.
We’ve averaged 14.5 points on offense the past 2 games. Against any team in the playoffs that’s a first round exit. This offense needs to get back going now.
I’d rather be wheee Green Bay and KC are. Our offense is garbage
"By no means does this mean we're perfect, but we need to stop treating ourselves like we're 5-7 right now, and block out everyone else's perceptions of us."

"Sure, the drops have been an issue. However, I'm more concerned with the fact that defenses are now keying on the short passing game and Ben is not placing the balls in the spots to let WRs make defenders miss."
"It really seems like the steelers have been scraping by for a long time. I don’t feel that our record reflects our ability. No run game at all, Ben has to throw the ball 60 times a game, players being cocky on twitter. Tomlin really seems like the only guy that’s aware of this, and I’m thankful for that much.

That being said, the defense IS playing lights out, but now that the injuries are piling up, it is really time to buckle down and stop scraping by.

I’m glad the Steelers lost because this is exactly the kick in the ass they needed. Losing your undefeated record to the NFC east is going to light a fire under these boys. I hope."
"I'm glad it was WFT because it doesn't affect the #1 seed if both KC and the Steelers win out. If both teams are 15-1, we own the tiebreaker!"
"I am not... because it wasn’t just an anomaly. They are a tired football team with major injuries at key positions and have a huge flaw that any team can exploit...no fear of the running game.

Maybe Pouncey and Connor coming back will help(God, I hope)"
"We all hope that the lost will inspire better play from the team. So many examples of missed opportunities.. but it happens. We just couldn’t get a string of 50/50 plays last night that we have been getting all season. And to your point, the players needed a loss like this; feeling like they should have won the game, but lost it because of their lack of execution. And I agree with you about your point about Tomlin. He knows his guys were feeling themselves a little too much."
"I wouldn't go as far as say that I'm glad, but I'm glad that if we were to lose this season, it would be to a NFC team. Also, I'm curious how this helps ease the pressure, as I'm sure being undefeated adds pressure. Will be nice for the team to finally have some rest and get back to normal scheduling.."

"NGL, if we beat an 11-0 team I would be excited too."
There are a lot more teams between Buffalo and Washington 😂
"Accurate assessment

EDIT: the only issue I have is that I fear that the Steelers don’t deserve the top of the pedestal. In fact, I am deeply concerned about them losing two in a row to a very hot Buffalo Bills."
I think I’d put the chiefs and Steelers on an equal pedestal now.
"They should be esctatc to be in 8th place. That team with that defense can go places, just like the current steelers"
"lol when you have nothing else to root for, this one felt good for us. Always had a soft spot for the Steelers, good luck on the rest of the season 🤝"
I feel like people dont realize that its how well youre playing that matters not your record
"Still shouldn't have happened,  just saying..."
"This would be better if, in the fourth panel, he did not have the team emblem and the reveal was only in the last panel."
"Wft fans have every right to be excited by that win. They played better than the ""best"" team in the afc."
patriots or wft? whos better?
Lmao so true
Shouldn't KC be on top? They at least lost to a somewhat of a playoff contending team.
I'm trying to figure out how to watch the TNF in HDR but can't seem to do it (is it still possible?) I have a 2019 shield pro with the fox sports app (ethernet connected). It does say 4k but not HDR. My TV is a Vizio which doesn't have the Fox Sports App so I can't try that.

not sure who this is addressing but im more bummed about dupree than anything


view poll
who says steelers nation

i cringe when i hear the media or other fans use either term i even heard an announcer use gator nation when talking about univ of floridaeww
none of the above probably an unpopular opinion but it always sounded like some semipro highschoolcollege type fan unification like its beneath us

if it happens organically i get it the terrible towel renegade hell even the old 60 minute men

but steeler nation always felt as if it was thought up by a marketing team to ingratiate themselves into an existing fan base how can we sell them soda if we cant identify them
i mean its always been raider nation and like it or not we and most other fanbases have adopted it theres never an s no idea why that would be a question

the question is whether or not any of us ought to be poaching it in the first place let them have their thing in oaklandlavegaswherever i get annoyed by fanbases glomming onto other teams shit it still pisses me off every time i see lesser fanbases waving towels around
it is absolutely steelers nation

literally no one ever says steelers nation

i wonder if its cause most people couldnt watch the game so they had to look up the scores lol
we probably have the biggest fan base across the country too go to any big city and youll find a steelers bar
i have never heard of tori kelly
i was googling it all day to see when the game actually was
removed
playoffs youre getting a little ahead of yourself there bud
the first game we played tho was that a jv squad and werent you coming off a bye aight then
when a person dies we are reminded that from dust were we made and to dust shall we return

as we watch the ravens playoff hopes die i would remind their fans from the browns you came and to browns you will return ashes to ashes defunct to defunct

yall have almost the exact same schedule lol
lmao have fun on the couch this post season ratbird
as a ravens fan lol get fucked saltbag
keep crying bitch
imagine taking the worst playercoach on every team and saying you beat x
3rd down i think your entire fanbase has talked itself into a frenzy of believing it was 4th and that the call on the field made any difference in the outcome of the game in the first place
in the words of antonio brown karma
yall forget the camera angles no one on the field was complaining
the audacity of cope
overrated browns are ahead of the ravens lol
unfortunately none of us have much respect for an organization that enabled antimasker bullshit to parade through their locker rooms mid pandemic while hospitals filled up

bitch about us winning ugly all you want its your team that couldnt even play on game day the winless jets have managed to field a team come game day every week which is more than your whiny bitch of a coach has managed
now list the ravens signature wins
which one the one where benny snell clearly got the first down ok

john harbaugh can eat shit
imagine being this much of a crybaby

next man up ah its his chance now
this is awful i would have rather lost that game than losing bud it amazes me how few people actually acknowledge this tj wont be as good without dupree on the other side our whole defense is based on this pressure without it we will have a really tough time in the playoffs
i am bumped and cant enjoy that win and being 110 even a bit feeling like we lost a playoff game
well we will now get sooner than expected evaluation of highsmith they are going to also have to sign someone else for depth
our dbs are about to get exposed with not as much consistent pressure on the qb
edit i thought they were at least tied but it looks like they are at 68 but still on tracks to get to 70 as long as they can make up for bud duprees projected injury tj and cam can still do amazing things

its kind of a neat stat considering the last defense to hold the record was tampa bay whose defense was coached by mike tomlin
nope 68 and counting

the chance to beat the record comes against buffalo if we can sustain it till then
there is also the unofficial record before sacks were counted officially at 76 games with the lions

i say we beat both records
im pretty confident that we can break the record
i just hope allsacks against alex smith are gentle almost loving sacks

this is awesome dont sugar coat it be honest and improve for next time
can we please get an us sucking flair
im glad hes like this
tomlin is the goods we are very lucky
offense wasnt as good as it could have been a lot of drops or coming up short on 3rd down some sloppy play in general to be fair this was an a typical afc north match up against the ravens im just happy we didnt lose
love that
i am honestly impressed that the reporter was able to say uh 6 times in 10 seconds
ex tomlin hater here i know i know im shit three years ago i was calling for him to be gone last two years im eating my shoes seriously this man could probably get the jets a win this year if he went over there he just knows how football works and when his players perform they win 100 of the time last game need to be put far behind us and lets stay perfect thank you tomlin you brilliant man
73 of the 15 incompletions were dropped passes thats just bad
ben had similar things to say in that post game interview i love that our leaders are holding the team accountable and calling it like they see it without calling out specific players
and things of that nature
reporter coach how do you feel about the execution of your receiving corps

tomlin im all for it
we have the best coach in the league
i seriously thought he said uh suck it to that reporter lol
rtomlinism
hate tomlin or not he will make you hold accountability for your poor play if done so hed probably be putting our receivers to work making sure they dont drop another ball
we definitely needed to do better especially the receivers who kept dropping passes that hit them in the hands
we dont make excuses
the way to fix problems is to admit there are problems coach will get it figured out and fixed by monday he went 88 with just a defense and two rookie qbs rudolph the red nose reindeer and donald duck everyone in pittsburgh knows we need to draft a qb or end up with a mark malone and get back to basics like running the ball get the other watt into the gamerecognize problems and solve them
been posted here already
thats my coach and ill ride with this man until he decides its time to stop
us sucking god i love coach t
the standard is the standard and we sucked
usavevideo
git guud
this is aweome but mike needs to say the same for some of his timeout calls this year oh geesh
this might be my new favorite tomlin moment
this shit made me go yoooooooooo lmao
ben and coach t has been brutally honest no sugar coating good stuff
our offense is going to have to make up for our defensive injuries soon bud is too big of a loss
i thought he told the reporter to suck it before i read the comments
so glad he knows the problem and isnt just seeing a win
no i said that i felt like just maybe a league rule with the rooney name on it might possibly put just a little more pressure on them than another teammaybe i should have been clearer in the original comment i havent said anything i wouldnt say to the mans face because thats what a man does ive owned what i felt at the time realized i was wrong and said so i never hated the man i didnt think he was the best hire at the time time has proven me wrong and ive said as much being a great position coach or coordinator doesnt necessarily translate into being a great head coach the unemployment line is littered with great ocs and dcs that couldnt pass muster
rtechnicallythetruth
usavevideo
pissed
whyd i think this was lil majin
tomlin is about to buy a jugs machine for every receiver on the team

which i just realized everyone calls it a jugs but the brand is jugs

i heard suck it the first time us sucking not bad either
randy five yard pass fichner shakin rn hes just here to let ben make his own play calls its stunning how obvious the difference in the offense is when ben is in the no huddle and when plays are being called in
this made me laugh so hard
i wont lie when we hired tomlin i thought it was a lot of virtue signaling by the steelers i have never been happier to say i was completely wrong now my mind was changed very quickly because it would take a blind man not to see what they saw in him everytime he steps up to a microphone it reminds me more and more how much i love this guy
why do left leaning people always break things down to skin color the rule about interviewing black coaches is named after our owners how would it look for them to pass on a black coach and have everybody in the league saying yeah yall talk the talk but dont walk the walk forgive me for feeling that it might have played a role in his hiring also how many of you had honestly ever heard of mike tomlin in 2006 im familiar with the arkansas state and university of memphis programs and had not heard of him believe it or not there are people that can form opinions without race playing any role in it i shared my honest feeling about the hire and admitted i was wrong i wont apologize for that
hey coach to what do you attribute you only winning three playoff games in the last decade
good god it must suck going through life seeing the boogeyman around every corner you can not honestly say there was no pressure for the steelers to hire a black head coach at that time that was my entire point as i have said repeatedly from the first time he stepped to a mic i saw why they hired himand have been 100 on board recently an article was put out saying tomlin was one of the great black coaches and i was offended by the author qualifying him i think hes a great coach period i would love to meet him and get to shake his hand and say to his face exactly what ive said here

the whole racist thing g is so tired and as for feeling superior it is you projecting that your the one calling me names and cursing me because i had the audacity to think a rule named for our owner might have put some pressure on them

bush was against cleveland
knees blow it happens it happens on sundays at 1pm just as easily as it happens on wednesday at happy hour next man up all the same
yeah i dunno sometimes injuries just happen and its not anyones or anythings fault
devin bush was against cleveland

i think its conference record so if the steelers were to lose and they are both 151 this would be the week to do it since their loss was to an afc opponent this would be an nfc loss
doesnt matter browns are going all the way baby
of course the tiebreaker could go either way depending on what happens what happens is the definition of a tie breaker

the scenarios at this point in the season are too many to count right now we could tie with kc at 115 and have to decide which of us gets the fifth seed let it play out a while
its win of common games played

common games played

ravens 1000 for both teams

texans 1000 for both teams

broncos 1000 for both teams

bills 1000 for chiefs

basically if the chiefs win out the steelers can only lose to the bengals or browns losing to the bills gives the chiefs the common games win tie breaker losing to the colts gives the chiefs the strength of victory tie breaker whether or not the colts win out

chiefs play broncos this week a win for denver would be huge however unlikely

source
on the contrary i think that a certain number of our players would be fine for the most part they probably cant even catch it

edit ignore the extra a before suspiciousproofreading
i almost missed the joke haha
i dont understand why all this pregamepostgame hugging etc is still allowed it is completely unnecessary
wow i guess i completed missed the joke sorry about that
i saw it at the end of the game and i was screaming at the tv

they should have just ran to the locker room i know they just were next to them actually playing but why take the risk
they played football against them with tackling and blocking in each others faces for two hours i dont think handshaking is that dangerous after wards
the sub wouldnt be the same without fresh yinzer opinions voice your unpopular thoughts hot takes and bold predictions here about anything football related

hate an admired playercoach love a hated playercoach do you actually like roger goodell think jesse didnt catch it he did any opinion about the steelers the rest of the league or the game in general are accepted throw em all here

responding to someones comment to create civil discussion and changing opinions are encouraged dont be a damn jagoff and turn it into a toxic argument

do not downvote others because you dont like their opinion

downvotereport content that break the rules

this thread is intended to not shame others who have different ideas and thoughts that go against the grain of the metas in the sub



and as always dont be a damn jagoff
unpopular opinion 1 we are an elite team and should be considered the favorite to win the afc and the super bowl

unpopular opinion 2 we will not lose a step without bud he was playing solid football but no better than that highsmith and friends have a real chance to improve overall production from that rolb spot
i think we currently manhandle the chiefs

bold prediction were gonna lose to the bills
as much as i love this team i think we get manhandled by the chiefs especially with the loss of bush and now dupree i guess that may only be an unpopular opinion in this sub tho lol
i  the thread dont worry

unpopular onion i prefer when people think were frauds

if you think about it there are multiple tangible benefits to being doubted by analysts and other teams

lowered expectations means lots of chagrin when we keep winning

teams will underestimate us which affects their effort and game planning thus helping us

motivation for our players and less pressure

less disappointing and shocking when we do have imperfections

i dunno i guess ive just grown numb from reading too much reddit commentary and news articles in the last couple days i know our team is the best in the league but i want to stay humble and i feel like we play better when expectations are lower im sure thats confirmation bias but it sure does keep me from getting frustrated at all the mouth breathers spewing hot takes without being able to think about it objectively
hot take james harrison rejoins the team for veteran minimum logs 15 sacks 5 ints and places 3 qbs in long term comas over the next 4 games thereby edging out tj as dpoy
those who say if we play like we did in insert close win here well lose to insert good team here arent saying anything insightful but i think they know that what im curious about is what they think they are saying because i truly dont know what the point is that theyre trying to get across its true that if the steelers play as poorly as they did against the ravens theyll likely lose to better teams what often goes unsaid is that its obviously equally true that if the steelers play as well as they did in some of the two or more score wins theyre likely to beat anyone similarly if the chiefs play as poorly as they did in the game they actually lost or other close wins over lesser teams squeezing out an ot win over the 38 chargers walking away with a mere two point win over the 48 panthers then theyre also unlikely to beat the steelers

thats sort of how reality works play well youre more likely to win play poorly youre more likely to lose i guess im curious why some feel the need to say this out loud since we all live in the same reality we should all know this without it needing to be said do they think anyone will disagree i really just dont get it
heres a thought we may not play the chiefs at all anything can happen in the playoffs they could lose before they face us i do agree that this is the best steelers team that weve seen since 2008 guess where the super bowl is this year
juju is the most needed wr on the team hes not flashy this year but ben trusts him to make the hard catches and to get the needed yac
unpopular opinion the browns are getting the same flack that we are getting they are 83 and the nfl power rankings still rates then below the ravens everyone just wants them to be bad and they are actually decent i still want to blow them out again and make them cry
from your lips to gods ears i pray you are correct about highsmith he has shown some promising signs if he can play at a closely similar level we should continue to have a hell of a defense that was probably buds last play in a steelers uniform i hate to see him go out like that
tj is going to see 1 million double teams
im just taking a moment to vent like a rage animal about how the league is defiling itself trying to make time for lamar jackson to come back

first they did us dirty by postponing the thanksgiving game six days in the hopes of getting negative tests back so he could play in pittsburgh

now theyve pushed the dallas game to tuesday for no real reason other than to give the ten necessary days since his first positive test they obviously think a team can play on four days rest because our game is going ahead on monday afternoon

its so obvious that the league is bending over beyond backwards so they can get the reigning mvp back on the field the illusion of competitive balance is gone this is a farce i hope andy dalton has his once a year great game and hangs 30 points on those dirty ratbirds

okay i feel better now thanks
browns are looking really good right now
this stretch of games 3 games in 12 days will help our offense get back on track for the playoffs
were a really good team and have very good odds at being a super bowl champ this year


dunno how that became unpopular after going 110 and sweeping the ravens but here we are
heres a hot take we rest a significant amount of starters vs wft
we go 151 win the super bowl people will still say were overrated easiest seasonal path to the super bowl in history wouldve lost if we played x etc people will refuse to accept the steelers are even a top 3 team this year and if we dont win the whole thing it will just affirm their shitty biases
unpopular opinion in this sub the steelers finish the regular season in 2nd place in the afc and get bounced in the first round of the playoffs

first assumption the chiefs probably dont lose another game so they finish 151

second the steelers lose to buffalo and cleveland finishing 142

now were in wild card weekend potentially facing teams like the dolphins colts or even the browns again im having flashbacks to 2017 against the jags or 2007 against the goddammit jags or even our loss against tebow and the broncos i just have the feeling that were in for a huge letdown followed by a lot of handwringing this offseason i really hope im wrong because anything leas than making the conference championship this year will be extremely disappointing
the browns are playing like super bowl contenders against the titans right now and im scared of them
steelers being the undefeated underdog is the best thing to happen to them this season close wins against shitty teamsclassic steelers not a real reason to panic

tomlin will get them ready to take on kc whether or not we keep the 1 seed
the biggest reason this steelers are undefeated is not because of weak schedule but because big ben has no away games
do what clemson did when they beat the fuck out of bama a few years ago just find all the plays kc cant stop every offense runs the same concept in different variations there has to be overlap same with defensive schemes
ben is out with 9 minutes left in the 4th because the steelers are leading by 20
hot take taysom hill is just dollar store kordell stewart
bud is a major loss for us poor kid blows the knee out in a contract year i hope he gets better and i hope steelers find a way to keep him on the team paired with tj
just have a bad feeling the game on monday will be way too close dunno if its that unpopular of an opinion lol
i kinda want to lose a regular season game the thing im most afraid of this year is that the patriots wont be the only team ever to go undefeated and lose a super bowl especially if the giants make the playoffs
our superbowl win chances are toast without bud we will lose to the bills
cant wait for this 1817 win
my prediction is we lose two maybe three of our next 5 games finishing the regular season at 133 or 142 at best we make it to the afc championship game and get blown out by the chiefs by 17
every year we have garbage games where our players forget how to play football but this year is the only year in recent memory where we win them

browns about to lose 3 straight i had a browns fan trying to tell me chubb is better than henry

ravens about to make a dash for the playoffs but will barely miss it and only one team from the afcn makes it

but they are 110


beat baltimore at full strength titans and killed the browns better point differential than chiefs and better opponent strength so ya gfys op lol
that bills game will most likely decide if the steelers will go undefeated
rent free
that pats team is the best ive ever seen but that dolphins team is incredibly overrated
there is something to be said about gritty ugly wins that should almost be losses keeps them grounded prevents them from getting too high on themselves and provides ample energy to keep working hard in practice
steelers always play down or up to their level of competition they could beat the jets by 3 and the chiefs by 3 in back to back weeks
from all the highs and lows of yesterday leave your final thoughtsanalysisdiscussiontakeaways from yesterdays game

this thread is intended for levelheaded mindful discussion and less kneejerk reactions keep this in mind before commenting

as always dont be a damn jagoff follow our rules we all have different opinions and mindsets but were all here to talk steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day keep it cool
all aboard the alex highsmith hype train
its gonna sound like an excuse for the team but i think the constant pushing of the game had a bigger negative effect than expected it was by far their worst offensive showing this season and i dont expect it to repeat on to washington
im just bummed out man bud worked so hard to get where hes at today in what was likely his last and final snap as a steeler the team that was so patient with him and worked with him to grow he tore his acl and ended his season the guy deserves to get every penny and i truly feel for him he wanted that bag never made a fuss about a franchise tag and was one absolute hell of a teammate

from a selfish standpoint this hurts the team obviously alex highsmith will take over and while he has exceeded my expectations thus far its certainly a downgrade thats not a knock on him but a testament to the level alvin was playing at going to have to adapt somehow tho perhaps more hilton blitzes more stunts etc gonna have to get creative

losing bush and bud hurts no way around it is it a huge blow to the team absolutely yes it is a death sentence no i do not believe it is this defense is absolutely littered with talent and while overcoming two phenomenal players going down is not an easy task i firmly believe we are more than capable
thinking about bud other problems can be tied up next man up here we go
mike tomlin to james harrison i am once again asking for your olb support
id trade bud dupree for a loss
the steelers constantly play down to the competition noise is really starting to sound like nails on a chalkboard to me its such reductive and dubious bullshit as if the ravens whole season wasnt on the line yesterday

they cant win the division now theyre two games down to the browns for a wc and yesterdays loss means their path to one is that much more narrow

the ravens played with the appropriate desperation and somehow steeler fans are surprised by their effort why are we always blaming our team for how hard opponents play us

you can criticize all of the damn drops poor sts performance the god awful tackling but you cant make up some bs about steelering when the ravens led by 1 point for a grand total of 4 minutes
im still anxiously awaiting the return of the run game the ravens secondary was one of the only position groups intact and yet we had to throw it 50 times to win this game i know conner and pouncey were out but so was most of the ravens starting dline if we dont feel comfortable running against backups how are we going to fare in the playoffs
turn half the drops to catches and this is a blowout ben had his best game with accuracy for the entire year do we have a run game

ws a w
mike tomlins press conference after was perfect he was pissed as he should be hope they come back monday ready to play
run game concerns me

but if the receivers dont drop everything last night ben probably has a 90 completion rate and the game is a blowout so at least we know the passing game is not an issue
im not surprised it was an off week for us having the game moved and jerked around really doesnt help athletes mentally and physically prepare i know when i played d1 soccer game day routines and the practice leading up really makes a difference

i also wonder why kc and baltimore fans are so pressed about us being 110 like if you think we are so bad why are you all still talking about us if we really arent a threat then you would forget about our team
tomlin was not happy after the game calling the performance junior varsity league


defense played great bit suspect without tuitt on some plays highsmith gonna sink or swim getting the big time step up into buds spot i do have more faith in him than i do in spillane for bush at least

offensive playcalling was bleh rush was bad until late in the game so many drops fire randy of course hope pouncy is just a close contact or symptoms and not covid positive

special teams muffed punt only reason the ratbirds believed they were in the game i think out punt coverage on both sides could use a few extra drills always looks shakey

ravens gonna miss the playoffs
i have to say i loved how all of the fans of both the steelers and penn state were reacting to mcsorely playing in the game chat compared to the rest of the steelers fans

basically this

beyond that i really loved the ability of snell in that game i had real questions how wed be able to do without conner and snell did well a lot of drops this game by both teams but it is a steelers ravens game what do you expect defense always clutch you love to see it offensive scheme was something but it worked out

in any event on to the next one
were 110 and media still talking shit about us and not acknowledging our success this season man i cant wait for us to shut them up
tuitt tweeting that easy game shit just proves to me that there are guys on this team who think that mindset is acceptable
take away a few of those drops and i think we would have won by 2 or 3 possessions hope those wrs and ebron hit the jugs machine hard

super bummed about bud the offense will need to have better games than yesterday if the d cant be quite as formidable
i think the defense will still be fine still talent all over the place think our super bowl chances will be determined but what our offense does or in yesterdays case does not do lol
this is the worst win ive ever felt as a fan played our worst game of the season after already being frustrated with the time changes and then we lose bud just pain
tomlin is pissed and so am i that shouldnt have been as close as it was versus practice squad and back up players who have only practiced once for this game versus 5 or 6 practices for us

they keep pulling out these wins because of talent alone offensive playcalling is so predictable i may win some good money betting on it thats one of many reasons the running attack is poor ben under center with 11 personnel run
despite the final score i dont think we were ever in any real danger of losing this game even with our brutal mistakes gifting them points and sabotaging our own points we still completely neutered their offense and were moving the ball consistently against their defense the 70 yard td to brown was essentially a garbage time td with a hilariously bad blown coverage reminded me of the minnesota miracle and was the only reason this game ended within a possession it should easily have been a final of 197 and thats not even counting all the tds we should have had in our numerous red zone trips

really the only major concern i have is the wr drops mccloud has been solid so his muff is likely an anomaly and the same goes for edmunds re the poor angle on the long td if our wrs can clean up the drops i see no reason why we cant finish 160

its just starting to sink in for me how well our offense complements our defense the quick rhythm short passing game helps to create long lasting drives in the absence of the run game while also limiting turnovers thus allowing our defense plenty of time to rest this way the defense can go balls to the wall every time theyre on the field and are not gassed at the end of halves i dont foresee a 160 finish but i think this team is well built for a very deep postseason run
can i just say we arent really built to blow teams out teams arent out there guessing what we are going to do and its been that way for awhile we have a stellar defense who is built to get constant pressure and blitz every team knows this and we say ok beat it so far no one has

we have a lethal short passing game with tons of options for ben teams know we are going to spread it out and we say ok now stop it

if we just had a run game we could control games more thats what we need to figure out
despite our arguably worst showing so far i didnt think the ravens were in any position to win that game at least i wasnt ever afraid we were going to lose i was frustrated with how the team played for sure that ravens team wasnt good enough to hold the steelers jockstraps if they cleaned up the errors and only dropped half of the balls we did its 247 early in the 2nd half or better and we are coasting at that point

bud is a big loss but so was bush and we are still the best defense in the league so heres hoping highsmith steps up big

also fuck everyone who says we arent legit or kc is head and shoulders better than us youve been watching too many shampoo commercials we have the 7th most points scored on the season averaging only 3 ppg less than the chiefs while they are surrendering 45 ppg more than us not to mention being the sacks and takeaways leaders they lost to the raiders almost twice they had to take the 38 chargers to ot and almost lost to the 48 panthers theyve had as many squeakers as us while we havent dropped one in fact weve beaten baltimore x2 stomped the browns and beat the titans all 3 of which are currently ranked higher than the raiders who beat the quiefs get off mahomes dick
hope everyone slept alright after yesterday i feel better now about the game yesterday we just have to put the drops in the past and keep moving forward im just very upset with the dupree situation i feel bad for the man but at the end of things this is steelers football and its next man up mentality highsmith will hopefully fill his role and do it well we are 110 and swept the ratbirds and in my book thats amazing no matter who you play and how you do it lets keep the winning train rolling and the vibes high here we go steelers
people forget that all their points came off of ray ray fucking up big time and edmunds freezing for some reason lol
this season is what i thought the killer b squad would be
the receivers are gonna be practicing catching passes for 12 hours straight lmao
i went to see what was happening in rravens for the hell of it and the comments are as predictable as one would assume worst 110 team as weve been playing bad teams fck the steelers real original there fellas and the team is full of phonies as a handful of examples if we had actually stomped them they would have blamed covid we won barley and say how we beat them with their roster depleted

maybe i was hoping too much but i was hoping for some more introspection and comments on their newerlesserused roster
i couldnt hear the game what happened on that second i think down where they measured it it looked short and i think they said it was short at least it said so on tv they reviewed it and then said the call stands but it was now a first down i was confused as to what the original call was or something
steelers offense dropped the ball way to many times this game couldve been a blowout if they wouldve not made to many mistakes
i wasnt able to watch stupid rescheduling ugh but ive heard about the bad first down call im confident that we can get 1 inch on fourth down it wasnt a rigged call that determined the whole game excuses excuses
while we have a lot to work on in our game i believe the ravens d was very good and made us look bad in certain instances more than other teams would have they deserve credit we still need to improve but we tend to forget that the ravens are almost as good at blitzing as us and although ben took some shots it wasnt a disaster
its hard for me to say this but i believe the offense is responsible for buds injury if the receivers catch the passes that hit them in their hands and we turn those field goals to touchdowns bud wouldnt have been in the game that late just my opinion
ive been following the play calling on the offense pretty closely and did some comparison shopping i have a master theory that the short sideline passing game plans are reserved for teams we know cant score on the defense with consistent success strong feeling that the offense has been hiding the playbook since after that first ravens game somebody is going to get a classic dose of down field passing ben whoop ass when the time is right
another week another game of randy fitchner pissing off the entire city
go look at the ravens sub lmao they are fucking pathetic lol tryna say they are better than us off of one game of poor play blaming the refs for both losses and getting us to 110 i dont think there is anything i hate more than philly fans and ravens fans
just got a notification for a bungles post about us

all i have to say is the bungles are without a doubt the worst 281 team i have ever seen
im nervous as hell were headed for an early exit from the playoffs we have to fix our run game if we can then i think were fine we need to work on the drops a little bit but that is actually fixable i dont know if the run game is fixable or not if its not then we are not winning the super bowl this year
just bench our stars for the next game weve all but secured afcn and a top 2 spot

whats the point of this post tuitt was joking about playing a division rival
having to get ready to play 3 times in a week probably played a role
ah yes of course its all because of a tweet by a player who wasnt even on the field good thing detective zeitgeist2019 is on the case

been banned from there for a long time for calling an obvious racist a racist
dont make references to tards and you wouldnt get banned

sweet talk is the way to a womans heart

now juju heres 3 dollars to stay with us
juju is smart and lucky enough to take advantage of a social media career along side his nfl career if anyone on this team can be cap friendly its him his twitch ig and youtube channels alone combined earn him 750000 a year never mind his sponsorships and his nfl salary
i know yesterday was an anomaly for the other receivers but i still think juju is our best receiver and they absolutely should make an effort to keep him
jujus yac is just insane i mean not by the numbers but the fact that he will catch something in no space and then still get an extra 46 yards is incredible dude is tough
id like to think juju is a priority but well see i love claypool and diontae and i give claypool some slack since this is his first season but the drops are rough statistically speaking diontae is one of the league leaders in dropped passes i think washington gets the short end of the stick though and i think if juju becomes a priority hes the odd man out
oh captain my captain
pay this man
this must be a sign that they are going to keep him

x200b

right
steelers dont rock the captain patch so its in name only but still cool
thats my captain
pay the man a reasonable amount
his draft video is for real fucking inspiring
the steelers will agree to setup a bot net to watch his streams thus guaranteeing him capfree revenue
please pay the man so he can be our future captain
for the cardinals maybe
i guess that means were going to resign him
so the team plans to bring him back next season
hines ward 20
we cant just pay everybody we have to pay tj and thats going to cost qb money thanks to garrett and bosa wr really shouldnt be the priority now if he takes a lowball to stay a steeler awesome

his face is there for a frame yet its such a great frame
its weird looking at the original oline in 2016 it was that exact unit for many years but now i think were starting to rebuild it
you could have just asked a few people in this sub seem to have every steeler game ever memorized
man the bell touchdown that led to was such a beautiful run
im pretty sure the moment right before in the booth phil simms farted and stank it up didnt realize this was from a steelers game until now

heres an article outlining this theory as the birth of tony romos announcing career
how did you find this
holy fuck that oline was stacked
youre hardcore friend
i was at this game never knew this was the meme game tall boys started slushing up
props to whoever took the screen grab from a single frame to gift us this
link broken damn
good work finding this the frame comes and goes so fast did you have to watch the whole game
this is amazing
i always assumed it was this game but i never bothered doing the leg work to find out great job
gods work you are doing for us
it is the dolphins

well thats a positive wouldnt ya say
lets hope it stays that way incubation period isnt a day
well this is essentially meaningless within the context of potentially contracting it within the past few days to say nothing of the game yesterday so im glad theyre all negative this time but ill hold my applause
but reddit told me that the steelers would get infected even though a fucking doctor cleared the ravens yesterday reddit only listens to medical professionals oh except when its inconvenient

honestly i dont even know why i fucking have this app bunch of posers trying to act like the smartest people in the room

im always confused when they bring out the tiny desk people make fun of it every time
is that a diaper
that carpet is a disgrace to our great nation and its once proud and here we go
i dont know if i understand the whole ordeal well enough
but it shits me that john has a coach under his management that failed to prevent against covid19 causing steelers a massive inconvenience would then sit there and complain about inconvenience and unfair treatment shut up and move on he should be grateful theres been no punishment and that they got to play rather than forfeit
just swung by from chicago to tell you this was very well done
in fairness to complaints about ref fairness refs arent calling shit against us by anyone theyve only called 47 penalties against our opponents the entire season which is by far the worst in the league theyve also called 72 against us 5th worst in the league and a lot of those calls were ticky tacky calls

for comparison sake with a very similar schedule yall have had 72 calls against your opponents

and then i get the notification about buds acl
this is a potentially lifechanging video
worst 100 team in history but best 110 team lfg
what is this from

contrary to popular belief teams can only play the teams on their schedule

110 baby
the only non common opponents between the ravens and the steelers are bal plays kc and ne combined 137 with bal removed and we play den and buf 129 with pit removed its pretty evenly matched this year
ravens have like an identical schedule thats crazy
give them credit we didnt have to play a 100 team this year
this might make sense if your schedule wasnt virtually identical baltimore
i predict that they go 23 down the stretch and finish 500
what i find funny is we play the exact same teams exept thet have kc and ne and we have broncos and bills
i hate that argument because you can only play who is on the schedule and this isnt like college football where you can schedule in a few small school patsies to blow out also everyone of those teams has pros on them and they are playing to win too
the arguments about this are exhausting no one will be convinced one way or the other yes our sos is low but you know what you play the teams on your schedule were also the only team that has had two games jacked up by covid scheduling you play who lines up opposite of you and if you beat them you get the plaudits just keep doing that and you hoist the trophy and thats what the damn game is all about screw the haters here we go
lmao the ravens are playing a few dumpster fire teams and the browns

in there practicing with nerf balls
need a drone if you dont have flying skills i have belichicks phone number
hi fellow nova resident
as enjoyable as it is to be undefeated right now our main goal is to win the super bowl and i really dont think going into the playoffs being undefeated helps that cause it just puts a big target on our back some guys get arrogant see tuitts recent tweet and if we get kicked out of the playoffs were the laughing stock of the league for years to come

just look at the ravens no matter how well they would play they are being mocked with choking in the playoffs king henry memes fullback earl thomas and stuff we would be them x1000

whats your opinion on that
160 means absolutely nothing without a super bowl victory just ask the 07 patriots
i dont think it matters what our record is once we get to the playoffs every game is a must win at that point regardless of record

but i agree i care more about a sb win than a perfect season
well the only game we cant afford to lose is this monday so there ya go

edit can not cant
if we get kicked out of the playoffs were the laughing stock of the league for years to come

the cincinnati bungals have entered the chat
superbowl 160
id rather win than lose
id love for the team to get a weeks rest before a playoff game so yes the 1 seed is quite desirable
i dont think it matters what the record is most writers analysts dont even think we are the best team despite our record and probably wont even if we go 160 yes the steelers have their flaws but its about getting wins especially a super bowl win
been saying it all along
im hoping for 151 loss to buffalo and chiefs drop game to saints 142 ravens i think will be 7 seed chiefdravens rd 1 would be great however if we get the 2 seed we may face the rat birds a 3rd time
i agree i think a loss eventually is important to be refocused before the playoffs im thinking clemson losing to pitt and beating alabama for the championship
everything you listed is still going to be there going 151 or 160 we are still going to have a target on our back the players egos are going to be their egos and peoples opinions on us if we are bounced from the playoffs arent going to change
sure but if no one can beat them in the regular season then nothing can be done about that so far no one seems to have it
how is going 151 better than 160 as long as they win who cares if its going 160 or 151 why would you want them to potentially miss a bye week

no we do not ask who whatever teams know us we are the pittsburgh steelers noone needs to ask who we are
the steelers had another picksix against the ravens yesterday via elias the steelers lead the nfl in scoring defense sacks and takeaways only 2 other teams have done that this late in the season since the 1970 nflafl merger and no team has finished with the lead in all 3

lol your tomlin mannerisms are spot on
i like these better than tomlins actual presser
get well great player i am so glad that you are a steeler
amen

i just have a gut feeling he is going to be very impressive what do you think
he was drafted knowing we would be losing dupree so were just starting earlier than planned
im with you some people you just have a gut feeling about right he put up some real tj like numbers as a senior for unc hes big and he looks mean i think itll work out very well
next man up can always become the man all you need is an opportunity to prove it
i loved him in the draft its hard to go that far but i love the gut feeling hope youre right
highsmith has a superhigh ceiling imo kid is a stud in both pass rush and pass coverage he sets the edge pretty hard
this isnt an unpopular opinion its a bold prediction and i really hope it comes true
do we have a nickname for him yet
looks like he can line up on either side and be successful too i love how his highlights show him making the big play even with a lineman or te draped all over him
i think and certainly hope that he will be very good trying to temper expectations for this year if he can make enough plays to prevent other teams from doubletriple teaming tj constantly ill see that as a win learn some lessons this year and fix them in the offseason ready to rock next year
wanna see him hold up against the run has always been the question mark about him as a pass rusher i think he is already pretty solid
the prophecy has now been foretold
hes good but not great or even very good hes going to be active and make his share of hustle plays but i think his sizespeed limitations will hold him back from standing out once the dust settles and hes matched against grown men on every rep

the nfl and espn really needs to assess him a qbr to go with his perfect passer rating in super bowls
thatthats not a picture of tommy maddox
i used to watch randle el in college i live in indy he was an electrifying qb i was so happy when the steelers drafted him although i had no idea what they were going to do with him i did know he was a very gifted athlete though
thats a weird way to say our lord and savior duck hodges
i know this isnt the real reason for your post op but being old enough to have watched each one play for their entire career still got a couple more for ben i can say that they are cut from the same cloth as for stats those have to be discounted as the game was much different

terry was the better athlete he was truly a generational talent i remember reading an article about terry in his first couple of seasons claiming that he was the fastest player on the team and his arm was second to none maybe bert jones could throw as far but i dont think anyone could match terrys combination of velocity accuracy and touch

believe it or not i think chuck noll was most responsible for bradshaws early struggles as he refused to designate an offensive coordinator noll was old school and as much as that set the foundation for those great teams it also did bradshaw no favors think about that for a secondbradshaw had no offensive coordinator or qb coach until tom moore in 1978 i think also bradshaw was responsible for calling the offensive plays there is no wonder he struggled for the first 5 years lastly i think the league had a larger number of great teams and great qbs bradshaw truly beat some great teams to win those 4 super bowls heck he rarely lost any big game

ben is a terrific athlete also he doesnt have terrys arm or speed but hes bigger and stronger i think that ben just might be one of the best when it comes to turning nothing into something the game is never over when ben gets the ball in the final few minutes that part of bens game has always been amazing i live in cowboys country and i hear all the time about how great romo was at doing it they quiet down when i can get them to watch bens highlights

ben could have easily played in terrys era and theres no question that terry could have played today until ben gets another super bowl ill say that terry bradshaw is still the best qb
love terry but its ben
its a toss up back then bradshaw was playing in a league where you could be killed drug off the field and next guy up people like jack hamm would fucking hit you so damn hard your grand kids would feel it penalties were non existing

now technology and human evolution provides smarter much bigger and faster players than of years past im talking overall everyone on the field now literally runs a sub 5 second 40 including lineman now you can be penalized for playing slap hands with brady but my boy ben because hes a big strong dude with grit gets hammered plays through injuries and continues to be arguably one the best all around qb of my time

idk im 39 seen so many greats come and go but bradshaw playing in a tougher league not superior imo would get the nod this is my opinion trash it if you like go stillers
if you asked me this before this season my answer would have been bradshaw but being in the here now i must answer big ben
bradshaw lost 4 or 5 seasons because of his arm injury people think the 80s were a down time but they had very good teams in 1983 and 1984 and a healthy bradshaw would have had them as super bowl contenders

i was 13 in 1983 its hard to describe the excitement in town when bradshaw came back late in the season unfortunately he didnt even make it through one half but threw 2tds going out in a blaze of glory
tony dungy easy
anyone who ever played nfl street knows that randle el was literally the most valuable player in the league lol
i think neil odonnell threw a prettier ball
both great qbs but terry is downright annoying in his post nfl days hes also a tomlin hater and therefore a member of the most delusional group alive today
man i loved randle el had his jersey and everything loved him at indy too ill never forget the first time watching him play penn state i thought he was the best
did michael vick play like one season for us or am i making that up
still have my randel el jersey might have to bring it back out
love this post but its ben
cliff stoudt
i dont see mason rudolph in this photo
but but chchcharlie batch
its jeff reed
dick shiner
whats the point in comparing theyre both great but one is severely understated and it isnt ben they are both great qbs
i cant hear the arguments over the gleam from our six lombardis eight conference championships thirtyone playoff years two bronze stars and a purple heart
not quite a toss up brad has 4 rings ben has 2 both had great defenses although steeler d of the 70s was one of the best ever check their stats in 1976 the year brad was hurt they were amazing

spillane number 1 i like that
spillane has been a stud
i have been pleasantly surprised that spillane hasnt been picked on in the passing game same for edmunds

this year has been so weird
the rams defense is so fucking good i think they may make a run in the nfc
crazy that hadens rating is still that high with a pick 6

i just realized this is through week 12 not just week 12
wheres that guy who said spillanes 1 pass coverage rating was just padded because of his interception against the ravens lol as if interceptions dont contribute to your pass coverage grade
i feel like edmunds may have fallen last week on that ridiculous dive of a miss tackle on browns tdi have no clue how pff grades these things
yo who the fuck is breon borders


there have only been three other teams to get this far in this season and lead in these three categories 1985 bears 2000 ravens and 2017 jaguars if the steelers somehow manage to finish the season in the lead in all 3 categories would they be considered amongst the greatest defenses ever
2017 jaguars

well my day has been ruined

id feel a lot more confident if bud was still playing as it is im just trying to enjoy 110 its been up and down this season but i will always take an ugly win over a fantasy point filled loss
for anyone who cant read the article the stats are

most sacks

most takeaways

fewest points allowed
highsmith albeit with less snaps has graded out significantly better than dupree so far this year obviously there is an over exposure risk would not be surprised to see the steelers sign a vet fa but i do have high hopes for highsmith long term
ive been seeing a lot of doom and gloom regarding buds injury and while it is a loss i dont think it will nearly be as bad as you think

first of our front five bud is the worst not to say he isnt great its just that cam tuitt alualu and watt are all better than him but more than that whenever weve had an injury this year the backup has come in a played great be it kevin dotson and okurafor for decastro and banner or spillane for bush they drafted highsmith to be buds replacement and hes played well when hes had a chance we just have to have faith that our front office and coaching staff know what they are doing

so tldr we have an amazing front five without bud and our backups and rookies have done a great job this year when asked to step in and highsmith should do the same
next man up

everybody thought the sky was falling when bush got injured

i trust tomlin more than anyone to get it done its what great coaches do
im sick for dupree because i absolutely love the way he plays but ive always been curious how much of his improvement in the last two years has been because the defense as a whole has gotten markedly better and how much of the defense as a whole getting better has been because of his improvement theyre likely both influencing each other but we may get a more definitive answer moving forward
its not that the sky is falling its just imagine this defense with bud and devin our backups arent really the problem our backups backups are bud goes out alex comes in bush goes out spillane comes in now when alex or spillane come out thats the issue in late game scenarios
highsmith albeit it with less snaps actually graded out better than dupree and it wasnt close pff grade i think
the way i see it bud is more of a scaretheqbintothrowingtheballtoosoon kind of guy than a sack guy highsmith is the same kind of player doesnt always get to the qb but he makes enough noise on the line that it makes the qb uncomfortable
so is this gunna be buds last year
i have a feeling were going to miss bud in stopping the run game bud also had a habit of putting some hard shots on qbs that dont have their internal clock properly functioning buds not going to create instant pressure unless hes unblocked or schemed free but he does have a knack for looping around and putting pain on the qb i get this feeling highsmith is going to be pushed around a bit more until he gets acclimated hes got a great motor tho
honestly its not the worst thing in the world to get used to not having him anyway theres no way we were paying that man next year hes been playing out of his mind

thats 2 months this season hes been afc dpom

solidifying that case for dpoy for sure
its going to be a fourhorse race for dpoy between donald watt garrett and howard i think watt has the slight edge right now
you guys smell that

it smells like dpoy in here
i think the snub last year actually helps his case for dopy gives voters the idea that hes due for one which he of course is
now if the refs called all the holds they put on him
announce jj on min to sub for bud
thats our outside line backer comrades
if want doesnt get dpoy we riot
crazy how watt has no forced fumbles
best linebacker in football
respect

had me thinking dang i gotta drop some quarantine weight if im going to get mine out
the only way debo would play again would be a contract with guaranteed playtime
remember how pissed we were when james acted like an asshole to intentionally get himself cut and then joined the patriots people were practically chasing him with pitchforks tarnished legacy how dare he now we want a 42 year old guy that screwed us to come back and do what stunt highsmiths growth
we arent out of 2020 just yet
i currently have a juju jersey die hard steelers and usc fan im really hoping we resign him this offseason if not though would fitzpatrick be safe purchase thanks
minkah will probably get extended id say tj is probably the safest besides ben no way in hell we ever let tj go
forget about safe purchases if you like the player you can always recognize what they did in their time here

what do you mean my hockey fan is showing
troy polamalu both an amazing steeler and played for usc
tj i got his after the rookie year and im certain hell be here for at least 5 more years
fitzpatrick or watt are solid choices
minkah is definitely safe hes got at least a year or two left on his deal
honestly i dont think there is such thing as a safe purchase these days as we saw with ab things change rapidly with players its just a risk you take its really too bad that theres no way to make blank jerseys look good in football due to the numbers on both sides the same way that you can for hockey or soccer ive found the safest bet with jerseys is to just go with legends which is tough when you want current jerseys
im somewhat of a minkah man myself
a player who is on his second contract or tj watt thats all id do right now
i got the fitzpatrick salute to service jersey clean af
after spending one months rent on a brown jersey a few years ago i would highly recommend the jersey of a retired player
im going to get a mitchell ness jersey i think im a bigger dude 66 300 the tight jerseys do not fit me the mn look to be a little looser
removed

need collinsworth face in there
heres a guy who owns pff and doesnt know the stat that females make up 47 of nfl fans and since there currently arent any women in broadcast booths doing playbyplay or color commentary maybe cris could give up his seat for a while
i love this lets gooooooo
what if our mom is from allentown
is this in reference to confessed pedophile cris collinsworth
damn what is this from
its sad he had to apologize for that

this citys made out of greatness and smog that one got me lol
dont pretend youre in wexford youre slumming it here with us

what the hell day is it is 60 minutes on

lmfao

that right there
pluck a duck
the line about harbaughs tears oh man
lmao best one of the season
kickthedamnball

i had the same reaction
how you get a 724 area code
if we can survive the edgar thomson plant we can survive you

fuck that hit a little close to home north braddock represent
i like it ravens can complain about us delaying the game a couple seconds when they delayed the game by 6 days
greatness and smog i love it
removed
when a player was awarded afcnfc defensive player of the month twice a season since 2009 he became defensive player of the year

2009 charles woodson
2012 jj watt
2014 jj watt
2018 aaron donald




myles garrett could win it in december i think watt will win it but he needs to keep up his streak easily the best defensive player in the league behind maybe aaron donald
if it was set in stone you just jinxed it
that and the mf leads in like 7 categories and some arent even close
no forced fumbles for watt pretty weird
i dont agree it is set in stone because aaron donald is just an unstoppable force at dt who puts up insane numbers considering his position that being said i do think it is tjs year to win it he was deserving last season and i think that plays into these votes
its down to aaron donald and tj watt i think myles is out since he missed games
vegas odds has tj as the favorite right now but donald is still close garrett has fallen quite a bit due to missing games he is almost out of contention now

tj needs to keep that sack lead or tied with donald his lead in tfl over donald and qb hitspressures is already near insurmountable

no hate but what made you put led zeppelin bit of a odd choice i feel like for a highlight reel

couldve been 3rd or even 2nd best receiver in nfl history he squandered his chance at greatness truly sad
it truly is sadwas a huge fan of him until he got a huge contract and selfishness turned him into a monster
imagine if he was still here

we are 110 and he would be complaining on social media that he should be getting the ball more and that ben is utilizing too many receivers
idk why people have the slightest respect for ab he was always selfish it wasnt until he got his platform til people noticed central michigan players went on record saying so plus multiple felonies basically shit on our logo on the way out

offense is much better without the toxic twins chirping in bens ear and throwing a fit when they dont get the ball

and while were talking about it are people serious about harrison not only is he old and washed up but he double crossed us as well
had a friend who booked antonio to sign autographs at his business before he blew up in the early days he said he was the nicest most humble dude also he seemed almost intimidated or shy to meet the fans according to my friend i didnt meet ab comparing that description to 2019 antonio is crazy cte and ego i guess
im praying for a steelers buccaneers superbowl to see the steelers beat tom brady and antonio brown both at the same time
dont be sad remember all the good times his catches have given us
i had this card rated and autographed it disappeared in a move still upset til this day
should make you happy hes gone cause now were 110
the holder is worth more than the card itself

not quite the wordsmith that tomlin is lol
bruh can we just get a sticky thread of all the fuckin quotes this year so many to keep track of

we do not care
fart in a skillet
cant see past lunch
got a double header in a couple hours
imagine getting stiffed armed by a tiktok influencer
we love being in the kitchen
we make no excuses
what does that even mean
i dont know what this means but i like it it is my solemn vow that i will use this in a work meeting today
fichtner is the bizarro tomlin
fichtnerisms
if it bounces it wasnt a fart
fitchners play calling is like farting in the skillet empty but can cause illness
dude god damn it can this guy just not be associated with our organization
what the fuck thats a gross analogy
this statement alone a fireable offense lmaoo wtf does he mean
lmao
lmao wut
randyare you a smart feller or are you a fart smeller
okay now i want an ismoff we give tomlin and randy a mic and they each have to go back and forth dropping single sentence isms until one of them dies

if highsmith plays well enough to not be a handicap to our top tier defense this last draft was one for the ages even without a first round pick
highsmith looked really good when he got chances to play if he balls out itll make it easier to bring back juju with buds money in the offseason
well shit if drunk uncle butler is hype so am i
against 30 of the other 31 nfl teams im not concerned about highsmith

im concerned about not having dupree when we play the chiefs also concerned with not having bush i want to be able to get home with 4 studs against them be able to double hill and then having edmundsbush to have the athleticism to take away kelce plus helarebell in the passing game and fitzpatrick to put some fear in mahomes with his ball hawking
i think anyone lined up on the other side of the is gonna do decent cause tj is a destroyer of worlds they spend so much time worrying about him that his linemate can make shit happen
id hope every professional football player had a football mind considering the entire country produces about 7 per state a year collectively itd be a fucking tragedy if they didnt

hey keith start fucking i want more than one more ring for the steelers
alright keith then stop dropping watt into coverage so much
jesus can you clinch a playoff spot before you start talking super bowl
what a strange way to judge your success i have less career accolades than fuck trophies
one for the son
do we need to up their daily dose of copium all offseason they talked about how ben was gonna be trash and they were gonna sweep the division and now they are 3rd and cant even win the north and now they are complaining about how easy our schedule when they play the exact same schedule as us expect we play the bills and broncos 1210 combined and they play the chiefs and pats 157 combined they shouldnt be worried about us they should be worried about passing the browns first
same reason like 90 of the posts here have been about the ravens for the last two weeks
we dont concern ourselves with raven subreddits and things of that nature
we do not care
this is a bit ironic
dont talk about them we can live in their head while continuing ignore them if you wanna talk about other teams talk about who were playing this week or even the browns because theyre more of a threat than the ravens lol
the ravens fans got huge egos after last year forgetting that without big ben we are a completely different team getting swept hurts their feelings
rentfree
theyre coming to the realization that their mvptheir franchise qbtheir futurewas all smoke and mirrors a gimmick and a fraud and that theyre doomed to remain our plastic blowup ghetto slam doll for the next decade
they hate us we hate them pretty basic
because


rent free
hi please delete if not allowed my fianc is a die hard steelers fan from pittsburgh and he mentioned wanting to get a new steelers jersey and preferably juju but hes not sure if he will be resigned or a free agent after this season is over

am i risking it by gifting him a juju jersey for christmas in hopes that he will resign hes open to other players but i would love to get him one of his favorite player

thanks
that would definitely be a risk yes

who else does he like
watt is the best player on our defense and aside from ben the best player on our team he will be around for a long time that is your safest bet
i doubt we let go of juju but yes go with watt thiers always a chance that they will leave but watts here to stau
get the juju even if he leaves youll have something to remember him by
if juju is his favorite player and pittsburgh is his favorite team theres no question you should buy him the juju it dont matter if hes still here next year or not i still wear my phil kessel pens jersey all the time bc hes one of my all time favorite players hell id say if juju leaves buy him the jersey for wherever he goes as well nobodys ever gonna see him at a bar and say why u wearing that jersey he dont play for us no mo theyll say duuuuude i love juju go stillers no brainer
juju will be gone after this season imo
thanks so much everyone extremely helpful
we are not letting go of juju

if they would look at the angle its tilted which makes the ball short notice how no ravens were getting mad because they knew the ball was across
even though it was a first down this is still funny ngl
we have big boy ben we couldve sneaked it in with ease
pretty funny actually
it wasnt 1st down though either way steelers win so it doesnt matter
or does juju seem to be getting a hell of a lot stronger and tougher than he has been in past seasons ive been seriously impressed at some of his yards after catch this year
he trained his ass off last summer and got huge dude and the difference between him and some other players is he is playing angry football he refuses to get tackled until theres 3 dbs on him and he still is stiff arming and planting his feet down the entire time you see some other players who are cocky or arrogant but juju is mad and he is playing his ass off despite not having those huge numbers that the fantasy guys expect out of him
he always been a punisher see burfict hit his rookie season i think hes got a lot of confidence this year being the veteran even at 24 years old and is somewhat trying to lead by example i think hes always been this way but now he wants to showcase his grit to the younger receivers and team as a whole
last game proved to me that we gotta try to keep him hes gonna be so important to the continuity of this offense postben hes a steeler through and through
hes fucking built too thick and man made you can tell hes sculpted because you can see it thru the pads his fucking vice grip thighs suffocating thighs rock hard thighs piping hot thighs great arms great abs a stocky chest love the progress his body has made throughout his youth and now as a willing eager adult
he reminds me of a hines ward tough as fuck and makes those dirty area catches very reliable no reason to not sign this man
he documented a ton of offseason work that he was putting in seems to be paying off well for him
i feel like he might be one of the strongest not the strongest receivers in the game
personally i think he is getting just as many tough yards as last year he is just not getting those feature big yard routes this year since so many others can do them so its sticking to peoples memories better this season
he used to be a strong boi now he is strong man
i hope he never leaves
absolutely love the football jujus played this year its a huge relief to not hear anyone bitching about numbers
he has hes leaning more on his physicality than his athleticism hoping he sees his value in our offense and takes a teamfriendly deal
hes always been beefy imo not to mention hes always been a good blocker too
please use this thread to post anything doesnt have to be steelers or football related at all dont downvote in this thread if you see someone being a jerk report it or message the mods about it

need to vent do it here

hatelove something and want to talk about how much you hatelove it do it here
the victim complex on the ravens sub is hilarious what a bunch of mouth breathing sore losers we are by no means perfect here far from it but get a grip lol
im not panicking so much now after a few days past the ravens game a rayray muff and red zone drops kept them in it but these are more like anomalies and not trends they were due for a let down and a game less than 24 points scored so im not too surprised it happened against the biggest rival i anticipate that these things get smoothed out down the stretch to play peak playoff football
so my husband knows i have an irrational dislike of baker mayfield that extends beyond normal rival qb dislike i cant even explain it properly and i know its silly i just really really dont like the guy i once got super drunk and drew a mean picture of mayfield in ms paint and tweeted it at the official browns account not my proudest moment but anyway

i was out grocery shopping and noticed a certain item had been added to my list a baker mayfield body pillow i must have looked crazy for laughing like i did in the store

imagine some sweatlord browns fan with their mayfield pillow propped up on the couch on game day i cant deal
made a youtube channel to talk about the steelers if anyone is interested in checking it out im new to youtube and not good with technology so i know the quality of the videos isnt the best working on it if selfpromotion isnt allowed here i apologize and understand if the comment gets 


put in an offer on a house yesterday hopefully they say yes
i would really like to see layne emerge down the stretch i am pretty satisfied with the play of our top 4 but layne offers length and size the others dont considering both hilton and sutton are set to be free agents and haden may get cut for cap room hope not it would be great to see layne make some plays before 2021
no spoilers but the new mando is fucking awesome
i just cant wait to play the chiefs i think we will prove a lot
the ravens sub reddit without a doubt are the biggest bunch of cry baby whiners ive ever seen worse than the browns who have a lot more reason to bitch with their history

pouncey
go broncos
nice of colinsworth to give credit the kansas city for pulling out a win against a depleated broncos team but criticize our offense for not putting up more points on a wednesday afternoon against a nearly full strength ravens defense s
waiting to hear back from the lender about the house we want the wait is agonizing

view poll
all the sacks
think 1619 is the most realistic if he stays healthy 9 more sacks in 5 games would be pretty crazy with how much pressure we get from everyone gotta think tuitt gets a couple cam and then even vinnyhiltonedmunds on a blitz too
i wish is 16 and more but im not sure

trying to find a watt jersey and theyre the only place that seems to have stock for him and the price seems good too just raised my eyebrow a bit since it seems too good to be true can anyone vouch for them
im like 95 sure you are going to get a fake dhgate or aliexpress jersey dont give them your cc info whatever you do
ordered a jacket through some generic chinese based website the size ordered was 3xl the size of the body portion of the jacket received was probably a 2xl the arms however were just a l no way to return took my lumps and did a hand me down

hes at a doctors appointmentwill people chill out hes 42 years old and not at all what he used to be used to love the dude for sure but he would be no help to us
thats a no from me dawg
dude wasnt even good his last few years what are we talking about here
ill wait over here for the highsmith hype train to pull into the station
i would honestly rather see us poach back skipper tuzar from the titans psquad
just in for a prostate exam for the hell of it
back when he played and id see him on tv i could never figure out if the bars tv aspect ratio was out of whack it was madden or fox sports cgi depiction or the real actual hulking james harrison on the screen
nostalgia is fine but i have no interest in a 42 year old commercial actor who bad mouthed the coach publicly i trust kc to identify a better asset for depth
id rather highsmith at this point
no
ill jump on board with you
hey i have no problem if this beast wants to come try to win our affection back sure he left on bad terms but he just wanted to play maybe it works out and he really helps us maybe it doesnt work out and he proves that all the talk is true
been hearing rumors about this but nothing official its not a terrible idea as long as he is ok being a backupspecial teams player

what do yall think the chances of you guys going undefeated is
i give it a 15 chance buffalo and indi are going to be tough imo also browns week 17 could be a loss if we secure the 1 seed by then
who cares

were trying to win a superbowl my man
much lower than the odds of this question getting reposted near daily here
we win these next two i dont think we will lose these next two are really really tough games especially considering the guys are going to be exhausted
every game is a challenge in its own way from most likely to lose to least

buffalo and indy are obviously the biggest threats to our streak

after that smith and the football team could pull off a shocker

we dont concern ourselves with ohio teams and things of that nature
id say about 3040 but that goes up to 70 if we beat buffalo cleveland is a good matchup and indy can be good but rivers crumbles under even phantom pressure another good steelers matchup

even if they resurrect joe burrows knee with demon magic i dont think the bengals have a real good shot rn
better than every other team in the leagues chances thats for sure
yall lost to the redskins

that team was so special and its crazy to think how long ago that season already has been but damn i miss the bus ward cowher porter etc but here we are 15 years later and ben is still fighting for another lombardi for pittsburgh i really hope this team pulls together for ben and gets him his third ring
every time

every time when cowhers daughter grabs coachs face and the other daughter says daddy were world champions

every damn time it crushes me

every time including now

its always the journey
what i like about that year is it really illustrates what is important in winning a sb and why i am not worried about this team playing poorly right now

we didnt have a great record that year and made it in the playoffs as a six seed but when we were hitting peak performance when we got to the playoffs we had to beat every playoff team on the road that year

it doesnt matter what your regular season record is once the playoffs start or how ugly your wins are the upside of this years team is ridiculous even with the injuries the closest we have come to hitting our peak ability was against the browns this year if we can learn from our mistakes and pull it all together when the playoffs hit well be unstoppable
great watch love how they comment on every game leading up to sb




now my mind may be fogged but

i recall a story about an old man having a heart attack at cupkas 2 on the southside when jerome has that ball pop out and two off duty emts resuscitated him till ambulance arrived

this may or may not be true
thanks for the suggestion watching right now harrison in the huddle at the super bowl looks like a baby
cowher and his girls at the end
im watching it now its crazy how much i can still feel the stress and emotions even though i know how it ends

after six dropped passes in the game wednesday its hard to argue that a guy with reliable hands doesnt deserve more playing time
i dont disagree he seems to be developing well
saw this tweet and totally agree i think washington is underappreciated by most of our fan base he is reliable and has had some awesome clutch moments pulling down a td last year while being assaulted by a browns defender is one of my favorites

im not as football savvy as others but i wish there was a way to get his more reliable hands out there
i have been saying that all season
great ben so whos coming off the field

ben roethlisberger says james washington who had the crucial catch in the final minutes of the game deserves to be on the field more his connection and relationship with washington seems to have improved dramatically since washingtons rookie season

the question with washington has never been about whether he deserves to be on the field more hes clearly a legitimate nfl quality wr23 his issue is that jujudjclaypool are all legitimate nfl wr12 im not sure any of those three at this point are true nfl number 1 receivers like an abhilljulio jonesetc but all those guys would be the top dog on a few teams or a very good second receiver
he seems to have better hands than johnson and calypool at least right now
when youre so deep in the wr position that youre trying to run it like line shifts in hockey
this is what ive been saying the whole time
he could have been on the field on the interception what the hell was that package i wanna see vance tight with washington claypool juju and ebron outside if youre empty on the goal line maybe take someone out if you need to have watt on the goal line but have him beside ben in pass pro

protect ben your receivers are usually so nice use them instead of splitting benny and watt outside i know theyre trying to be creative but it was honestly easy to see it was gonna be bad just by looking at the personnel what the hell do i know
hell be back once we reduce the use of the run shoot spread em out dump it off offense jw is a classic outside wr guy that runs full patterns 2nd half of the 1st ravens game was a turning point for our offense before that we were running pretty well and seeking chunk plays out of our passing offense good chance this changes again once teams catch on to the spreadquick throw scheme
he doesnt have the wheels that dj has but clearly he has better hands
i dont disagree but who is being given less time juju is needed 247 hes gotta be in there unless hes getting a breather diontae can have bad moments but hes become a go to receiver and is probably more open than anyone else in any given moment giving ben a safe target his drops suck but his breakout ability is nuts mapletron seems to have cooled off a bit and hes had a few rookie mistakes but again how do you take a guy like him off the field that had a 4 td game earlier in the year forces a pi once a week and is a redzone machine

idk washington is maybe a more consistent option but also less likely that any of them to break a big one with yards after catch and things like that unless we are just talking about going 5 wide every down and id actually prefer that run less throw more play to our strengths one of the best point guard qbs in the league meant 100 as a compliment and one of the best wr groups in the league minus the drops
well the question is where does he fit in do they drop dionte the only skill guy out do they sit claypool the giant or do they sit juju the possession receiver thats coming up on a seemingly expensive contract next year if we let juju go hell drop right in seems like its almost by design honestly he reminds me of cedrick wilson back in the day though so washington does more strong hands push you back and can block but not the guy hell go to another team and be okay if he doesnt take a team friendly deal

edit instead of just downvoting this please tell me why im wrong i love juju too but hes replaceable with he talent we have and id really like for anyone to tell me otherwise
johnson has one more stop than stefan diggs and dk metcalf its not that big of a deal he gets targeted a lot drops tend to happen when you get targeted a lot

personally im more concerned that the steelers give juju a contract extension juju and his 88 average just isnt that great people need to stop acting like juju is playing great

juju excels in the intermediate part of the middle of the field but ben isnt throwing the ball there this year so if ben is going to continue throwing almost exclusively short or deep along the sidelines juju is the odd man out

i thought that said haden for a second thank god it didnt
just here to answer questions from a wft fans pov or just talk football
how scary is terry
opinions on wft keeping the wft branding long term
i look forward to seeing both of these veteran qbs meet again especially given their recovery stories of course bens was nowhere near as severe as smiths but it is an incredible story to see them both back and playing against each other once again
tell us about 3 positive things that daniel snyder has done as owner of the team seems like every story about him ends with him being a clown
i think the stillers might struggle against this defense
i went to high school with one of your cheerleadersdance line girls she got ran through by the majority of our football team i often wonder if she is doing the same up in dc bless her heart she was passed around like a bottle of crown but she was always sweet to me
hows chase young doing saw him hit burrow but havent been following him otherwise
the redskins will give us a battle no doubt take the skins and the points
was having the racist team name awkward as a fan
after his blow up with tomlin is this really going to happen
why do yall actually believe this stuff
i dont think theres any overunder on deebo coming back cuz it aint happening

he was pretty obviously trolling us with that ig story at dr bradleys office
we already brought in a guy for a tryout highsmith is now the starter

it would be neat to see him again but its not happening
dont you remember debo and ab clowning tomlin during his presser when ab was on his way out nfw
0

harrison is a little bit of a troll he took what was probably a routine followupcheckup and used it to turn steeler nation into a frenzy
id love to see him come backas the strength and conditioning coach
even with it set at 0 ill take the under
ill say 1 only reason i wont say zero is because deebo still trains like a madman but realistically hes 42 and hes just teasing i have no expectation that deebo comes back nor do i think he could help at this point
0 chance
dude was a locker room cancer it aint happening
this will probably not happen but shit i wouldnt be mad if it did

nice pick6 too glad he was able to play
joe haden says he wouldnt have been able to play thursday with his knee injury he was 5050 to play on sunday but by tuesday he knew he would be able to play

is this good or bad are the lions the lowest over that time or was denver the highest i am guessing low since i dont see any david carr led texans on here
this is the way weve already had too many injuries if we keep protecting ben weve got a great chance to make a playoff run

edit i say too many injuries but compared to some other teams weve been pretty fortunate to only have three significant injuries
how many games in a row is that with no sacks given up 4
who really cares the only thing that matters is hoisting the lombardi i dont see the pats on this list and they have the most sb wins and appearances in the last 20 years so this stat much not mean much

man would of had a touchdown if ben saw him
fuck it put him on the other side from tj hes an olb now
you would think we could use him for short yardage plays up the middle but nooooo lets stick in a ant to break tackles by 350 linemen
hey hes actually just as good a fullback as tj is a linebacker its just hes a fullback
fun fact for derek watts senior year his prom theme was turn down for watt in honor of him
fullbacks are people too
hes been good on special teams steelers just dont run a full back much anymore should use him more in tight end sets id rather see him than our 3rd stringer
wtf did derek do to earn that

eat a bag of dicks

thats the one thing about the defense if one player goes down thiers a player who isnt as good but would be a starter on basically any defense best defense in the league
i was going to snarkily reply should we trade bush this offseason

but i guess spillane can be bince replacement now who is at risks of being a cap casualty
well this is skewed as hell considering who we played
spillane is playing himself towards a big contract with another team
that list is specific to week 12
top rated by some bloggers metric is a far cry from best

but what the hell offer him for warner once trade time starts up again you never know maybe the niners read the same blog

and ben still didnt have a bad game lmaoooo i wonder if he will ever get his respect
we do not care
brady can also throw bitch fits when he loses and refuse to shake his opponents hand but people just say hes the greatest ever hes a veteran hes earned the right to do that

its dumb to play the victim when your team is 110 who gives a damn what others say
all these negative posts on this sub need to stop were 110 let people dog us if they want talk is cheap
okay so we lost our starting center

the ravens lost their starting qb rb fb wr te g c de dt rolb lolb and ls

it shouldnt have been 1000 but it damn sure shouldnt have been 1914 either
oh come on when brady has a bad game there are 400 articles written within minutes about how his career is over stop this nonsense

we do not care
the numbers mason
nfl numbers like those used on football reference all come from combine pro day or rookie weigh ins theyre real theyre official and they have as much to do with reality as honeymoon sex has to do with projecting forward for the life of your marriage
i was surprised to learn that rudolph is the same height and only 5lbs less than ben
ben plays bigger than those other guys

imagine using youre only a top 15 team all time as an insult
no one remembers the 2005 steelers sliding into the playoffs they remember them winning the super bowl
we do not care let the haters hate theyre going to anyways
i had a threesome with the two ugliest playboy playmates from 2019
i posted this in a similar thread

lets check football outsiders dvoa previous years figures are end of season dvoa but its an efficiency stat so it doesnt accumulate or anything week 12 stats may be a bit more extreme on average due to regression to the mean but its enough to be roughly comparable

2020 steelers as of week 12 295

2015 panthers 255

2011 packers 262

best record doesnt necessarily mean best team lol im sure there are a bunch of really great teams over the years that had one or two losses but i agree with your sentiment at any rate the most important thing is that if we win monday were in the playoffs after that we focus on locking up that 1 seed baby
yeah but you have to remember that we havent played anyone good yet we have a cupcake schedule s
ravens fans
didnt the patriots go 180 i thought they only lost the bowl
110 doesnt make you a top 15 team of all time lol
i mean someone has to be were still 110 im cool with it

i like him he says nice things
i find it so funny that raven fans and so many haters are getting so pressed just to argue were a top 34 team rather than 12
ravens fans in 2019 haha despite missing your franchise quarterback despite losing the best receiver in the league despite most of your offensive and defensive line being on ir despite cutting a veteran wr before the season was over despite having a literal duck at quarterback despite having a banged up running back room despite having a coach die just as the season starts we managed to sweep you

ravens fans in 2020 no fair we had covid19 issues that were entirely our own fault cause our management is a total fucking shit show we dont count the steelers beating us in our house making jamar jackson look like garbage with several turnovers we only care about the second game where you beat us in your house if it werent for the consequences of our own actions this game would have been played a week prior when it was originally schedule and we still would have lost just like we did the first time its not our fault were firmly in third in the division behind the browns were the preseason champs respect the brooch
i dont know why any of you care about that graphic honestly its something thats made to purposely get fans upset and to discredit the players when it doesnt matter at all trying to reason with people that agree with these kind of posts wont work because theyll always just say cakewalk the steelers know how good they are and we all know that they are a top 3 team in the league stop giving these things attention and just let the team speak for themself because no matter how far we go were gonna get memed on no matter what
no one ever mentions our cakewalk schedule is also the same as baltimores except they got kc and new england while we got denver and buffalo
ive never seen this guy with a bad take
the 1972 dolphins won 4 games within 4 points too

on top of having nobody in their division over a 05
regardless of what the dudes saying hes right the first graphic is so dumb bailed out by the refs beat overrated team barely beat x team whoever made that is obviously a steelers hater that cant give credit where credit is due we have some really great wins this season yeah theres a few games we went into that could be considered easy but if youre still trying to discredit us as an 110 team youre just wrong plenty of teams have easy schedules every year and were only the what 16th team since the merger to start 110 were really fucking good and youre objectively wrong if youre trying to say different
thank you matthew very cool

also on the close games thing its funny how everyone says we shouldnt play close games with bad teams but when we actually blew out the bengals and jags its discredited becausetheyre bad pick one
say it louder for the fuckers in the back
an ugly win is better than a pretty loss
wins super bowl

the steelers are the weakest team to win a sb
the ref bailout shit gets my blood boiling everytime every year every team gets a lucky call pittsburgh has been on the other end of some really shitty calls over the years so has everyone else in entire fucking nfl not even considering the actual facts of the calls people act like the calls were literally the most egregious calls ever made when in reality its the same shitty calls made every year one more thing jessie james caught that fucking ball
he said theres no such thing as an ugly win he clearly did not watch wednesdays game
usavevideo
its funny seeing ravens fans try to argue that we have an easy schedule even thought its basically the same except for 2 games

the ravens play the chiefs and patriots

the steelers play the broncos and the bills
dude if we win the super bowl theyre gonna keep saying we had an easy schedule in the playoffs
i agree a lot with what hes saying but i do have one small disagreement i think ugly wins are absolutely a thing in the nfl its not necessarily correlated to the final score but you can tell when teamsplayers are playing to their potential or close to it and when they arent for example ben really didnt play an ugly game but the receiving corps as a whole did that turned a game that couldve had a larger score differential into one that was closer than it probably shouldve been so in my mind at least it was an ugly win but as long as they can take it to and win the sb who cares about how ugly the wins are
ill say this the 2020 steelers dont feel like an 110 team it seems like theyve had to fight and scratch and claw their way to every win six of their eleven wins have come by one possession two were hardfought wins against bad teams the broncos and cowboys two more of those one possession wins came against teams that were struggling at that moment texans 2nd ravens game i will also say that the two games that preceded the 2nd ravens games were blowouts against bad teams so maybe the steelers are showing off their greatness this year is there something im just not seeing
by the time the season is over we will have played the ravens twice browns twice titans colts bills

seven games against teams that are at the moment playoff teams or would be if they hadnt lost to us twice ravens and might still get in

no one will be able to say the steelers havent played anybody after week 17
when the patriots for over a decade were winning their division repeatedly with two or all three of the other three teams in their division being absolute patsies i dont recall people giving out about their easy schedule you play who lines up across from you and beating them all is difficult even for great teams

if just having an easy schedule routinely led to 110 it would happen every year because theres always a decent team with a weak schedule guess what it doesnt happen because its hard to do and it deserves some plaudits
i think with a slightly more hard schedule wed be a 92 team i also think the patriots played in a different division than one where they get to whip on 3 usually subpart teams for 8 games a year theyd be a lot less dominant funny how that narrative never gets mentioned
future espn analyst right here
i want to boil this down to a venomous poison tip some darts with it and blow those darts into the necks of everybody i know and dont know
his takes are always honest and not bias in any way
hah promote that man
yep
we do win ugly though
yooo big facts
love the casual comment gameplanning can be a hell of a thing if youre team is better at it theres a good chance you win or put up a fight against a good team to show what you can do bit biased but tomlin last year was a good example and a bit of kyle shanahan this year

sometimes there are inconsistencies but qbs on average complete 2 3 of their passes per game everyone makes mistakes its just how you deal with them that separates the good from the bad steelers have had some slow starts but they still find ways to be successfulnot get blown out when mistakes start happening
to confirm just go to and sort by net pts

steelers 129
chiefs 110
saints 101

in conclusion the steelers are a good football team
people forget weve been on the opposite side of the score for years ill take this scrappy group anyday
i feel like we are took the spot of the pats that everyone in the league hates us but im kinda used to it as a lifetime bayern munich supporter in germany
matt has the most unbiased takes on sports internet tbh
a win is a win if you win by 1 or 100 ill take an ugly sb win over an loss any day or any ugly win over a loss
finally a tik tok i enjoyed watching
i believe i said something similar in a post a few days back
yeah ok
i appreciate that weve been getting too much trash talk when its not even warranted a dub is a dub simple as that
we do not care
steelers trash
this was from a meme account its not actually meant to be serious come on guys

i knew i loved his character for a reason
rafi bomb
so thats what sean rodriguez is up to
imagine living in maryland
i need to find a gif of this moment a friend of mine is named derek so we use the derek memes from the good place to poke fun at him but hes also a ravens fan from maryland so two birds
everything this guy does he makes 110 times better

no no no the obvious move is to put ben at olb and sign the ghost of sammy baugh
clay matthews is a free agent because he is too old jayrone elliott will probably get signed to play sts in place of highsmithola at times to give them rests
at this point i wouldnt care either way highsmith is the guy going forward anybody behind him is just there for depth if the coaching staff thinks matthews can add valuable depth theyll sign him if not its next man up
i am going to say this in every thread i see people metnioning signing some old fa

x200b

i would rather we get skipper tuzar again dude is young healthy knows the system and is just hanging on the titans practice squad that being said highsmith is the next man up
id rather see what highsmith can do hes the potential future next man up
i think i like alex highsmith
yes he could because he sucks lol
isnt clay ilb bud is edge
i bet he has been studying film

remind me to never eat something randy fichtner cooked in his skillet
uhhhhh is that a compliment or should i upset by that
shame dennys took the southwestern fart skillets off the menu now idk what to order on saturday mornings
the monkeys outta the bottle man
i hate randy
you know what they say people in glass houses sink shshships
wot in tarnation
funny quotes like this only work if you dont suck at your job
so i guess hes as good of a cook as he is a playcaller im not too big on skillet farts
good god randy
checks out


please turn in your terrible towel and dont drink iron city til 2021 good day sir
maybe give highsmith a chance from what weve seen in his limited time hes been solid after the way spillane stepped up for bush im not going to doubt our backups until they show they cant keep up
just stop
youre gonna get a lot of hate but i like the idea it would be just an extra little stab to the heart of ravens fans like steelers fans when harrison went to ne
we drafted alex highsmith for a reason why would we want old ass lbs who havent played this season longer for some of yalls suggestions
talk yo shit hillibilly
i agree with hillbillyhaven on this sub for once
facts preach it

same crowd was saying the same when bush went down
i dont know what everyone else is thinking but i dont want harrison back on the team but i do celebrate him as an all time great steeler and im just happy he and the team seem to have buried the hatchet
i didnt see anyone really implying these guys would be saviors highsmith works start and get the lions share of the time the new person would be depth that could possibly give positive contribution in limited time while the starters are getting breathers
im not sure your point here we need to rotate tj and highsmith off the field is ola going to be our only depth decent guy i know we have someone else on the roster or ps but thats likely not better than someone with nfl games under their belt

signing a washed up lb with lots of experience as a 4th stringer would be great very wise

i mean im fine either way i just grew up a huge harrison fan but was too young to truly appreciate how good of a player he was i just think it would be cool
who said this i know for a fact ive been calling for more reps for the guy before this injury bullshit
not to seem unalarmist but maybe see how monday goes and assess from there i dont know
sign me up i can be an elite outside linebacker
highsmith has been good so far i have faith in him plus it will be good to see what we have in him before the draft this year with bud certainly leaving in the offseason
what about clay matthews
deebo unretiring
but james harrison is just sitting at home he could get at least 10 sacks out of the rest of the year
honestly why not give harrison or wake 510 snaps a game tj and highsmith will need rest too

we have thousands of armchair gms in here that im sure would love to help well be stacked at qb with darnold winston cam
oooh id love to do pittsburgh but idk if im qualified enough
id like an assistant gm role if still available
id love to be an assistant gm too

no way in hell id give that footage up id be terrified of a lawsuit lol then again i know nothing about the law
banner is genuinely one of the funniest people ive ever seen the dude just loves life and loves being a steeler
fam gonna fam
typical older brother move haha
this about to become like jujus stolen bike
its only funny into someone gets hurt then its hilarious
a signed jersey and a selfie together and he could have it from me
hahahaha spoken as any brother would want as a younger brother i can say that my older brother would do the same
they had us in the first half not gonna lie
area ive seen a few unfortunate ups and fedex drivers slip on my steep stairs on northumberland
i would be more embarrassed about all the ways i tried to save myself from falling while delivering be doing moves i never knew i could i miss being a mail carrier but a work shooting amazon having their own delivery team pushed me out
checking my ring footage
im broke but i wish you all the best upvote
i hate the steelers

but this guy banner has a place in my heart

go back and find them
that really sucks if you want dm me your address and i will send you one of mine
i bought them anytime i passed through pittsburgh at bettis hall of fame induction and at that one roadside steelers store in west pa you know the one took them all over the country too even had my designated grip corner that smelled of sweat rip wherever yall are
i got a sb xl one with your name on it merry christmas just dm me your address and ill ship it out on monday

move the things you care about personally
theyre just touring the world covid cant keep their wanderlust down
im embarrassed to say ive literally never owned a terrible towel in all my years as a pittsburgh fan
so my dumb ass missed trying to buy this years sts sweatshirt ive been trying to check the nflshop website since early nov every day and its never come back in stock 2xl i even had my mom checking for me too im 41 ha does anyone know if stores in pittsburgh are stocking these im stuck in nj eagles country so we have nothing around
i would assume the new steelers store at hienz field might have them

i have one forget it exists then buy a new one find the old one and repeat cycle
i have a goto towel for winning games for us also havent shaved my beard all season youre all welcome
dude that towel should be grabbed and displayed somewhere thats a awesome tradition in your family
i have a handful that way if i have a steelers watch party i can share with those that dont have one or didnt bring one clearly your dad was a loyal fan go steelers
i sentence you to the black towel
i have two towels one i refer to as my playoff towel ive had it since 1994 and only bust it out for the playoffs

the other is my weekly towel that i purchased at heinz field im live in seattle now before the rematch game against the seahawks my girlfriend and i called out to a cop on the sideline explained we flew from seattle and asked him to rub our towels on the grass he rolled his eyes and looked at us like we were stupid but he took the towels and actually walked about 20 yards to the end zone and rubbed them there we were stoked
my dad still has the mustard colored rag that he pulled out of my moms rag pile after myron called for people to bring a black or gold towel to the playoff game
this is my towel there are many like it but this one is mine
i have had the same towel since 95 and its crossed four oceans been to 51 different countries and was at the birth of each kid
we used to wave bath towels before myron got in on the act
sorry for your loss buddy
i only have one and its never been laundered my wife suggested it one time and i almost left her kiddingkind of
we have a signed franco one it only comes out in very special and rare circumstances
i get shitfaced at games and lose them multiple times a season lmao
i have one from my days at iup after a wild night that i have 14 years later my sister is due to have her first child this year i made sure to buy her the babys first terrible towel it is signed with love from uncle strategeryman
sorry to hear god bless
i have about 15 different terrible towels but i mainly only use 1 the rest are just collectables at this point holiday themed superbowl ones things like that
we buy one at every game realllly hoping to get another one next season
same here

x200b

this is the way
my most special towel is also the one that is permanently locked away my son was born in pittsburgh the day of super bowl xlv he was wrapped in a terrible towel in his bassinet at the hospital
i do film work one time a la guy commented on our terrible towels i jokingly said that when youre born they send you home from the hospital in one so everyone had one later i found out that he believed me and told one of the producers

for real tho if i ever hit he powerball imma provide those towels to hospitals haha
we got our towles when we treated ourselves to a game for our 20th anniversary
i have my originalstyle towel plus a few of the commemorative towels i also have my dads towel which is noticeably more rough and used than my towels
i have two an original and the one that was released after super bowl xl with the logo score etc my dad collects them he has some framed that are autographed and for the last few years ive been getting him different themed ones for christmas his birthday and fathers day just bought him the renegadethemed one for this christmas
i had two one from my father and one from the game i actually went to hosting the rams last year then my grandfather gave me about a dozen and ill never want for towels again
i have a terrible habit of forgetting to bring my towel to games so i have to buy several new ones each year not this year but in normal years i own dozens
yes i have a really special one its was a gift from my best friend and its from the 2011 winter classic i dropped it into a toilet at heinz field during the 2015 playoff game where we lost to the bitch pigeons i pulled it out and got a garbage bag from the snack bar to take it home and wash it the only thing in the toilet was fresh water but thats still nasty but i wasnt willing to sacrifice it
respect
i inherited my grandmothers when she passed some drunk hoochie saints fan swiped it from me at the superdome on halloween still bitter about it
my old school towel like the one you have pictured never leaves the house they dont make them like that any more and id be pissed if i lost it i have a couple of newer ones that i take to games with me
same
i only use one for games the same standard one ive had since i was a kid but i tend to grab specialty ones sb champs 80th anniversary etc to stash in the closet
no family tradition here i grew up out of state and became a fan while at pitt

my oldest one was found in shadyside the night we won super bowl xl in 06

youve got to be shitting me i wont be able to watch my steelers play because of the nfls corporate greed this is what pushes me over the edge fuck roger goodells ugly ass
i live in that small part of southern mn that isnt allowed to watch it guess daytime talk show reruns are big ratings boosters compared to nfl football
nflbitecom
every time i see a steelers tv coverage map i low key wished they included the state of tasmania with a small red dot over hobart
see that tc in washington state thats me guess i better make a day trip to nebraska
people cant even go to bars to watch the games either pirates life for us
bruh im right outside of the coverage zone
youre all welcome to come watch at my place if you wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart

here is the argument the analyst drones would useokay i see that stat and i get that they have the most wins against teams with winning recordsbut hear me out they didnt look good doing it
the most annoying thing about this incessant talking point is the pointlessness of it all we play the bills the colts and the i still say theyre shitty 83 browns on the road down the stretch

if we get handed a couple losses oh well maybe we were overrated or our record was overinflated hard to be overrated when everyone says youre overrated i guess

if we handle our business nobodys going to be looking down their noses at us with an insane record and a raft full of wins over winning opposition

either way well be headed into the postseason with roughly the amount of respect we deserved all along

please entire world give it a rest
just saw a video of a patriots fan and he said that the steelers are overrated and that ben is trash because the defense always comes back to help us which is true but its not seen in every games that the defense only brings points to the game
easier said than done but would love to see how mahomes reacts to being hit hes kept fairly clean all the time some team needs to try and punish him physically and see if he holds up
and i was here convinced that our schedule was indeed easier
even if the steelers have ahad a cakewalk so fuckin what lol
media logic

browns baker had sore ribs

titans gostkowski whipped on the field goal

ravens game 1 minkah should of been flagged for helmet to helmet

ravens game 2 that should of been delay of game if trace the goat mcsorley started they would of won but half of their team was on the covid list
titans browns and ravens x2 right
if we beat the football team and therefore sweep nfce will it count that we also beat whomever becomes nfc east champ

but the refs favor pittsburgh
i noticed this live horrible missed call
but but everyone told me the refs handed the game to us
cam said hold on son
yelled at the tv for that one
its not just us refs havent been calling holds like past years i suspect the league told them to hold off for more offensepoints
damn cam had his man completely beat and was running full steam ahead for it not that hold mcsworley wouldve been absolutely smacked
and watt being held in the end zone that resulted in a td
its a bad no call sure but im sure someone could make a comp of all our favorable missed calls by the end of the season thats the nfl baby
jeez this is worse than bosa in the super bowl

its not holding if you grab the jerseys i thought
that would set a terrible precedent if they called that holding on cam

offensive linemen yes including steelers hold the jersey in some way or another during the play

similar to what the other guy said we sign every free agent qb demand they take a league minimum offer the texans a 5th round pick for jj watt
we implode and become the new browns our first several picks in the next draft are qbs we fire tomlin and fichtner sign james harrison back
fire fictner and butler give juju watt and minkah 15 year contracts
with this sub every fa thats either a massive draft bust or old and washed up will be signed
we would be 016 every year and confused why the 8 qbs on the roster arent winning us games when we are rotating them through week by week and nobody lasts more than a season wed also fire coaches constantly never have a draft pick because wed trade them away for qbs and resign players from our childhoods because this sub believes theyd probably work as a rotational guy despite being 10 years removed from the nfl
we sign juju to a 5 year 90 million dollar contract we then wonder why our offense sucks so much and why we cant resign minkah and watt and then trade our better receivers for sam darnold
anytime something went wrong someone would get fired immediately
what others have said plus sign daronld
before or after i open a vein
this sub

fire tomlin attend a kkk andor trump rally and go on a date with our cousin

my stillers mask is too small for me gotta go dahn the strip get one of those terrible towel ones
wake up

after last season regardless of covid its been a bit of redemption with ben back
yeah fuck the ravens poor poor bud dupree and tj watt

baltimoreworst 65 team ever
compared to the steelers the ravens play the pats instead of the bills which is an easier matchup the chiefs instead of the broncos which is a harder matchup and the steelers instead of the ravens which as of last year would seem like easier matchups but now we see the steelers are a more complete team

it doesnt matter because the steelers have done better against the same opponents but this is just stirring the pot for no reason
making the sos argument is stupid every team is 00 week 1 it changes literally every week from there
steelers didnt make the schedule they just play it if they were 65 or some other dumbass record they would say steelers arent playing very well which is the same shit theyre saying now whats great about the pros is winning is everything and style points dont mean dick just win baby win steeler strong
the ravens had the easiest strength of schedule heading into the season because they had two games against an 88 team whereas the steelers had two games against a 142 team this is how math and numbers work ill always wish an organization as large as cbs sports would choose to run content that looked a little deeper than that and produced content that acknowledged some more context but obviously they have to look out for their bottom line first
actually ours is easier because we have to play the ravens and they have to play the steelers tough luck for them tbh its hard having to play such a good team twice
dont be surprised funny thing is im not

ive seen waaay too many people take this seriously
imagine a washed up guy bitch about not getting enough snaps no thanks ill take alex highsmith
highsmith
would be a cool reunion but not sure if its a great idea
1 hes 42 years old no way is he going to be effective no way he has the speed to get around the edge he had 3 sacks in his last season

2 he left on bad terms he was falling asleep in meetings and was resentful of watt he wasnt happy for watts success he wasnt being a team player a big part of the success the team is having this year has to do with chemistry bringing in harrison could easily screw that up
if he and the coaches can properly communicate with each other hed be a great rolb to rotate in on 3rd and long situations but really thats all he should be used as if james understands this and doesnt get upset when he may only get 45 snaps in a game itd be great if he and coaches arent on the same page about the role hes being given then it could become another locker distraction thats not worth having james on the field

i like highsmith and i think he could turn out to be really solid but hes still a rookie and having a vet like james to put in on those we needshould get off the field here type downs would be incredibly valuable
no

nfl shop has run out of everything i wanted already
so apparently i can buy a marcus wheaton jersey but for ben i can buy a desktop cornhole set what a joke
steelers are one of the few teams that run their own shop and sell merchandise check the steelers store
steelers shop should have some

i love that man but thatd be really ignorant
no thanks i vividly remember him forcing his way off our team like a pouty baby then going to ring chase with our most hated rival like it was no big deal
no room for deebos ego he couldnt handle backing up tj and bud what makes you think itll be any different backing up tj and alex we have plenty of warm bodies if thats what the argument for is
hes doing well in his retirement no need to come back
league minimum as depth in case the other two are complete trash shit if he takes attention off of tj why not would be nice if his last game wasnt wearing an al qaederrr patriots uniform
everything that needs to be said about this is in the article

lost his job to arthur moats

deebo is washed and cant play in our scheme anymore
the only time a 42 year old should be on the field is if they are conducting an interview love the man and dont want to see him carted off the field many thanks for some amazing years with the black and gold
still bitter about him going to new england
i think part of the reason this team functions as well as it does right now is that we were force fed a large humble pie last season the starters learned that if you start one game it doesnt mean you start the next one unless you prove yourself and the back ups learned that sitting on the bench one game doesnt mean youll do it all season

its unfortunately a lesson deebo never got i appreciate his willingness to play so i dont blame him too much for going to the bungles and the patriots hes a football player first and a steeler second unlike hines ward who was a steeler first and football player second and would rather retire than put on a different uniform i can respect both

deebo wanted out of the game to spend more time with his family because he realized he missed some moments of his kids growing up that can do a lot to a person and who knows where his ego is 3 years later

lets just assume he wasnt at bradleys for a routine check up because he lives in pittsburgh and hes been his doctor for some 10 years but for official business if it was made clear to him that unless both highsmith and adeniyi also get injured he is not going to be a starter that he would be there as a mentor to them get to play the occasional snap but doesnt count on it and most importantly that he doesnt bring drama into the locker room id be okay with him coming back

i may be a fool for this but i believe that eventually those egos take a back seat and im willing to believe hes changed over the last 3 years
it would be the ultimate redemption story for deebo i wouldnt say no but he should only see the field if highsmith and ola are incompetent other than that he should just be the mentor we wanted him to be
id take him back in a heartbeat i love that sonbitch i like to pretend that his anti tomlin commentary and his stint with the pats never happened

ah the good old days of having a having a backup qb i wasnt afraid to watch
i miss this dude
we named our firstborn son after charlie batch and also his greatgrandfather but mostly charlie batch
ahh yes the days when we didnt have to dread using a backup qb batch was awesome by all accounts he does quite a bit in the community still to this day
this game charlie batch youre in my heart forever
whats the story behind this guy i just joined steelers nation this year and i dont think ive heard of him
batch was a back up that could have started on another team
him and leftwich have been my favorite back ups
c in case you didnt know he qbd the greatest game ever qbdby some arcane measure anyway somehow
i mean ben was the backup for maddox for a little while
personally i think our best back up qb was big ben when he was a back up for a week and a half also fuck tommy maddox
happy birthday you son of a batch
i missed charlie batch so much last year
in batch we trust
love this guy his last game against the ravens is one of my favorite steelers memories
saw him start in tampa i remember it was like pittsburgh south so many terrible towels and had the whole end zone section chanting charlee charlee
love charlie batch he was reliable and solid much rather have him than mason rudolph
love him stan on snr
he beat the steelers in ot coin flip game
mr get er done batch one of my top 3 backup qbs happy birthday
does slash mean nothing to you
im going to confess here that for bens first couple of years i kept saying we should bench ben and start batch
i dunno foles has a pretty strong resume for best back up of all time a super bowl and tied for most tds thrown in a gsme7


imo we needed a loss or two before going into the play offs to get us in that hungry mindset we are far from unraveled though thats dumb were going for that lombardi
we had 21 rushing yards we did unravel
maybe being undefeated caused our tight play but i think an l was needed to loosen us back up and play better if that makes any sense
were we ever truly raveled though
this headline was written in week 1 they just had to wait to now to use it
did they not they were pathetic last night

i got words for you

maurkice pouncey

pittsburgh has been widely known since i was a kid to produce and use tes for both blocking and run and catch scenarios especially short yardage

damn how young are you
can you list the tight ends that the steelers were known to produce and use without saying heath miller
seriously guys what the ever loving fuck are we gonna do our defense has taken some massive hits and our weaknesses are starting to become blatantly obvious now that we cant lean on them as much as we had throughout the earlier part of the season ben is still playing phenomenally and even with the drop problems i think our receiving core is easily top 5 in the nfl but good god man this run game is cringeworthy

14 carries and less than 30 yards i know the redskins have a dominant front but they are primarily known for pass rush and have been exploited all season by running backs i love the steelers and want to be as optimistic as the next fan but its time to wake up and smell the roses no matter how good we are compared to most nfl teams if this run game doesnt get fixed and fast i promise you we will not stand a chance against the chiefs the drops im going to chalk up to a mentally exhausted receiving core after a consistently stressful schedule that doesnt seem to be getting any more relaxing with the games ahead but thats the only excuse ill allow this offensive line needs a massive overhaul i cant be the only one who saw them all get blown up on just about every running play we had

last complaint for now why the hell dont we scheme for dobbs at all dude can run look at what the saints have been able to do with taysom hill all year and tell me we couldnt do some similar things with dobbs to spice up the offense a little and maybe open some things up wtf is fichtner doing out there is there any creativity left in that old brain of his we do the same thing every damn game of course itll eventually not work as good as ben is nobody wins in this current nfl by passing 60 times a game this isnt the fucking 1930s man we were 110 because of bens outstanding play and our gorgeous defense and now our defensive machine is missing some its key cogs tell me im overthinking it if you want to but im legitimately worried for the post season right now and as laughable as it sounds the browns can still beat us out for the division if we continue to suck it up rant over
what are we going to do bitch on reddit pray hard for improvement watch the injury report every day to see if spillanehadennelson is going to be ok and tune in on sunday night to watch the game

i know what you meant it just struck me funny
if they dont have more than half a dozen drops in each of the last two games they win both games by multiple scores
is this really how fans are acting after the first loss
i do agree that i too would like to see dobbs activated to run qb sneaks on 34th down and inches and at the goal line to me it seems that ben doesnt like to run the sneaks but we need that part of our game we dont need to reinvent the offense guys just need to execute better too many drops missed blocks in the run game and bad passes i think the sloppiness is due to reduced practice time and night games all season long the steelers have been playing 1 pm start games with a few exceptions in dallas and vs cincy the players wont make any excuses but i will since im just an unapologetic fan of the steelers
the number one reason its important to run the ball in the playoffs is time of possession you can only stop someone like mahomes so much our defense could play great on half of their possessions and yet they give up 31 pts because we cant keep the ball on offense and they have extra possessions to gash our tired defense while our offense is flabbergasted why our 2 yd passes cant generate good offensive drives
we are screwed lol
removed
well that could be a good thing let the sportscaster world keep saying how shitty we are maybe the players will see this get pissed and refocus for another run

but personally between the injuries and the scheduling issues i think were worn out they desperately need they bye week but i dont know if they can get it together enough to win out

i think losing now is a good way to realize that we havent played particular well recently but i dont think washington technically earned that win we played like trash
i would be lying if i didnt say i was a little bummed tho
yea it sucks we lost but maybe it humbled us and woke us up for play offs
whoa

hello lol
imagine losing to a team literally called the football team losers

they need to utilize james washington more imo
nearly half of those have been in the past two weeks
my theory is that ben hasnt been practicing a lot with the team recently and the receivers arent used to his heat
it feels unfair to put juju on that headline photo
i guess the silver lining is that this is very fixable its probably a combination of lack of focus with lack of practice the loss should be a wake up call to refocus and now we have a normal amount of time to practice again i expect to see this team to come out inspired to bounce back next week

i dont think losing is ever a good thing but id rather it be now than in the playoffs
most points this season 38 twice
32 22 pass attempts those games respectfully
fewest points this season 17 19
53 51 pass attempts those games respectfully
rushing yards for the 38 point games 129 138
rushing yards for lowest point games 68 21
the 68 yards isnt the lowest output but those are ugly numbers for any steelers team to have in the rushing game
i never thought id ever say this but i am jealous of the cleveland browns running game that running game with ben and our stable of wrs would become another steelers dynasty like during the 70s just stating facts and hoping for the best
steeler strong
i havent seen this many dropped balls since freshman year of high school
theyre also 2nd in the league in passing attempts youre gonna see dumb drops when ben is throwing bullets 50 times a game with limited practice on a weektoweek basis
were throwing the ball too much if we dont establish a run game before the post season we are not getting to 7 this year ben throws the ball with a lead tie game deficit you name it hes throwing the football i didnt fact check but my eyes tell me that were throwing the ball way more than those other teams so naturally were bound to have more drops our receivers arent the problem
put their asses in a cold storage warehouse at 4f with a juggs machine and make them catch balls until they can catch 200 in a row with no drops
i believe it has to do with bens ultra short release time notice all the big catches were after ben moved outta the pocket
im fully expecting a second loss this week ebron posted on twitter the the fire has ben lit but i doubt it hope they prove me wrong
should just be a pic of just that stone hands diontae
when i read his quote before the game i was waiting to see how many drops this dude had park his ass on the pine and lets get vance back in there
take juju the hell out of that picture those drops aint his fault
the crazy thing is close to half have been in the last two weeks obviously the steelers are a warm weather team this year lets move the team to arizona for games the rest of the season haha
ebron was terrible now i know why colts and lions fans hate him
i am going to pull a trump to make myself feel better we have the most drops because we throw the most passes
wow
can we make a new rule for this subreddit page where we just dont make a million posts and comments complaining about everything the pens page has a weekly post called fk it friday and they try to limit all their negetive energy into that post im a huge steelers fan but seeing every post just complain about the refs covid fichtner dropped passes etc this is not the steelers legacy to be a bunch of complainers steelers nation is about the hard working people who get the job done without making excuses
finchter slander is fun though
fr embarrassing that steeler fans are having meltdowns on twitter and fb too
i say let people say whatever they want as long as their some validity to it and it adds to the conversation of what can make our team better its been less than 24 hrs since the loss let people vent for a day and then lets see who needs to chill after that
agreed

this man for president
can we ban all the lame upvote party posts at least complaints can be insightful
pack it up ugumbytsmiles seasons over

s
well we do ask that people post their thoughts in the appropriate post game or day after thread but when we delete excess post game posts people complain about that too

so i think the best course or action is to decide on an individual basis
i have to say im at fault for doing this and would like this to happen as well

sorry steelers nation for the negativity
i was about to start calling this the bitchburgh steelers subreddit but i feared the backlash too much
amen
i completely agree with you i speak for myself on this one i try to find the silver lining in our flaws and no sobbing and complaining have i done it in the past 100 i try to post more posts on constructive criticism at the end of this day this is a sub on a social media platform the point is to post and generate feedback i
personally feel the same as you where the crying and bitching is kinda annoying realistically there is nothing we can really do all i can do myself is post things that i find people will enjoy reading and not flood the same stuff over and over try to have fun and hopefully more people can adopt that philosophy im not at all saying what i do is right or wrong either just i guess my 2 cents on it

cheers steelers nation
except the memes they make me laugh cry
no fuck off you complaining about people complaining is pathetic as well
yeah guys can we only post sunshine and rainbows on here all the time
imagine being 111 and the only loss coming on a week with only 4 days off with multiple starters out and losing by one score ending on great tip pass and people crying for people to be fired or cut

how many games have we won with a great defensive play that team has a good defence got the best of us grow up people we have the best record in nfl and are going to be in the playoffs move on
lol no where have you been all year not just gonna change it cause we lost one game

obligatory fire mike tomlin already
i recently joined rsteelers and just left this morning so many low values posts
yes please this i dont really visit other teams subreddits but id be surprised if any of them were as whiney as this one theres a difference between criticizing mistakesweaknesses and just flat out crying like a baby sometimes makes me embarrassed to be a steelers fan because i know these people are walking around spouting the same shit irl i have friends who are cowboys fans and theyre not as insufferable as some of you guys

its tuesday fam
taking nothing from alex smith what hes overcome to make it back to the field is beyond impressive but bens injury absolutely had the potential to end his career as well just not his life

if ben takes this team deep into the playoffs and makes a super bowl run vs a wft that may make the playoffs in the weakest division in history does the award still go to alex smith i know its a bit ridiculous for this to bother me but if the award is just eh make it back onto the field great then i get it alex smith had more to overcome but if its looking at what you achieve once you come backben outright won 11 in a row and it couldve been more if our receivers had hands and we didnt have randy on the sidelines throwing darts at an open playbook that only had passing plays in it

i suppose my question is does the level of what youre coming back from elevate your chances of winning this award so if cell regenerates from selfdestruction but piccollo is able to hold his own vs the best from other universes after losing an armcell still wins the cbpoy award

edit i did a little looking and yall are right its not the come back that matters its more the odds sorry to be a grump in the morning its been a bad 24hours mods can pull this if they wantor leave it up and ill take my licks i deserve it
he lost it to smith last night
this award is entirely narrative driven and there is no planet where ben makes a better narrative than alex smith
well smith beat ben in a game so theres that

alex smith won it the second he stepped on the field weeks ago theres literally no contest between the two yeah ben is having a great year after his elbow injury but thats peanuts compared to what alex smith has endured
has ben played better this season yeah has he been winning football games yeah but he came back from a pretty routine football injury albeit a difficult injury to go through at his age

in contrast there was a high chance that smith would get his leg amputated an even higher chance that he would never walk again playing in the nfl again was out of the question but he came back not only that but he is playing winning football and has brought life and a good playoff chance to a team that people were ridiculing all throughout the offseason and beginning of the season i dont know how you could watch the guy drop back like 50 times last night against this defense with no running game to rely on making clutch play after clutch play and ultimately winning the football game in the greatest upset of the season and not realize why hes the clear favorite that performance screamed cpoy to me

you could say its about narrative but tbh i think smith deserves it especially if he continues winning has ben had a better season absolutely but smith has come back from so much more and is still having a pretty damn good season himself
id vote smith
i was watching the game last night and before the game they showed the comeback player of the year clip for both guys how they got hurt and how they got better theyre showing smith laying in a hospital bed learning how to walk again showing the damage done to his leg and what it looks like now for ben it was likehere are my stitches and heres me wincing while the bandage comes off

fact is ben was only going to not come back if he didnt want to he had a very routine procedure and it was his decision on how much he wanted to rehab it and how much he cared to come back at 38

for alex there were legit concerns of death or amputation and even when they saved the leg the idea of him coming back was ridiculous is smith having this amazing year statistically no in fact his numbers are pretty bad but he does have two 300 yard games which i dont think anyone would have ever expected theyve won 3 in a row including knocking out the only undefeated team in the league yes ben is having a better year but what alex has done simply should not have been possible

another thing to put this into perspective imagine if shazier actually came back if he wasnt the same player and only played as a rotational piece would you not 100 call for him to be cboy regardless of who else hes competing with
well if our receivers could catch the easy ass targets ben is giving them his stats would be way way higher
not sure he ever had a shot once smith had a 2nd game started some were saying if smith didnt even play a down hed win it but i think that would have been met with some reasonable complaints

but hes playing starting and winning ben might be a runaway 2nd place however 1st place is even further away then ben is from the rest of the pack

im annoyed we played like dog shit but i find it funny how many fans of other teams we already beat are acting like this is the end of the evil empire because we lost a single game against an nfc team on a short week with numerous players out missed practice and various injuries hindering both sides of the ball

and to boot this thing even further weve still got control of the 1 seed of the afc the afc north is still well within our control and our 111 record shits all over the browns at 93 and the ravens 65

id rather lose a game now than have this happen in the playoffs and pull a ravens
lol washington fan trolling thats nice you beat us and your team is the best in the division with that being said i believe steelers will go further than washington if washington makes the playoffs
why would anyone cry about losing one game
can confirm
111 and wed have to win out for the first seed either way win or lose last night assuming kc does really not even that upset about this loss i do get annoyed by all the obnoxious takes but thats been happening all season like a week ago everyone was talking up wft as an up and comer and now its lol see steelers play down to their opponents lmao am i right
the wft has won the superbowl the wft has won a regular season game
we are miserable whenever we lose its a reality were putting on the smiley face because we still have the same goal of a championship and we can control our destiny to the 1 seed but just winning our games
last time wft won a super bowl was the year my little brother was born hes a year shy of 30 now things could be a lot worse thanking god im not a wft not even sure what to call that clown franchise anymore since they lost their name like a bunch of losers fan today tho
i expected them to go 016 this year and expect them to finish 115 soooo

if steelers beat the bills and browns colts and dolphins lose we clinch 2nd seed or better also they dont play easy teams ravens raiders and chiefs respectively
i honestly think well finish 133 or 142
i question our ability to make it deep in the playoffs if we cant hold the 1 seed this team desperately needs a rest
cant believe im saying this but ravens please beat the browns

im going to go throw up now
steelers still favored by 15 points visiting buffalo off a short weekstrange 12 days hmmm
its not

a win would be nice but going into the playoffs as healthy as possible and playing well then at the end of the regular season and carrying momentum forward is way more important

142 133even 124are all excellent fucking seasons then hopefully youre peaking late and you make a run i dont mind that we had a little downturn midseason i mind even less that we got to do it while still piling up wins we got our lull without any meaningful consequences
all that matters this year is winning the 1st seed not going to be easy
if we finish 12 4 im pumped
they gotta win the rest of their games at bills at bengals vs colts at browns if they even want a shot of a 2nd seed or higher
beat the bills thats funny
i think there are 4 major keys to yesterdays game that contributed to that loss you may disagree or just dont care which is cool but this is my amateur breakdown of the game

x200b

1 washington had the perfect defensive recipe to beat us defensively they have a solid dline and only needed to rush 4 down linemen all game while this didnt result in sacks it did result in ben only being able to throw quick passes to underneath routes i pulled out my calculator and the math checks out 4 man rush results in 7 in coverage this is why we saw most under routes go for anywhere from 2 to 5 yards at a time this also was prevalent in the run game which is a different issue for the steelers by itself but even more prevalent against the wft most teams cant get this kind of pressure with 4 dlinemen but against teams that can we need to figure something out offensively to combat it
2 the run game nothing to dissect here just the run game bleh 1st and goal on the one yard line and we cant punch it in hurts my soul
3 drops this is an obvious one but there was even more of an adverse affect that took place yesterday and last week that resulted from these drops drops have ended drives for us the past two weeks 3 and outs killed our time of possession as a result the defense took a major hit in have to play harder and make bigger stops and thats when they started dropping like flies does bud tear his acl if we convert a couple of those dropped passes last week does haden go down if we convert on 3rd and long to juju late in the game spillane hell i havent gone back and looked at the dbush injury but is there correlation to drops in that instance drops are bad but when drops take a toll on an aggressive physical defense because of playtime thats even worse
4 trust in our kicker wright was sufficient for the extra points and chip shot field goal i dont know if the kid could have or would have made those other kicks but it comes down to this if you have a kicker on your practice squad that you cant even give an opportunity to kick chip shots against a 47 wft then there needs to be a better job done of who is the kicker on the practice squad just for example fa kickers available right now sebastian janikowski mike nugent matt bryant caleb sturgis chandler catanzaro for fucks sake phil mother fucking dawson is available you wouldnt sign an ot that cant block to the practice squad or a lb that cant tackle my only point here is put the right guys on the field to be successful next man up means you have to trust the next man up no matter what position it is

feel free to downvote disagree or discuss below i just felt like i needed to talk this loss out with you guys we are 1 win away from clinching a playoff spot and no matter who we play this was a wake up call for some of these guys im loving this season and 111 is nothing to scoff at anyone hating on the steelers right now is probably still sucking the tit of the kc chiefs even though they almost lost two days ago to the denver broncos its the nfl and you cant win em all you just have to win the last one
i feel things like drops are signs of fatigue starting to show its been a brutal stretch of games
id like to see james washington and juju get more involved in the pass game they have the best hands of our receivers and can still make the explosive plays ebrons drops are hurting us but thats what we signed up for when we signed him
i feel like macfarland mcfarland needs to get more work running it when snell is ineffective he shows goes speed and if he can break even a few for moderate gains theyd have to respect the run more our oline also needs a lot of work this offseason

i also think our playcalling has been poor in close games until we go into hurry up if the ball wasnt tipped and picked off i have a hard time believing they wouldve stopped us from getting at least 3 there
at this point in the season the run game is not going to improve weve seen what were going to get jc coming back will help slightly but overall i think that part of our scheme is dead for the season


1 3 and outs killed our time of possession as a result the defense took a major hit in have to play harder and make bigger stops and thats when they started dropping like flies does bud tear his acl if we convert a couple of those dropped passes last week does haden go down if we convert on 3rd and long to juju late in the game spillane hell i havent gone back and looked at the dbush injury but is there correlation to drops in that instance drops are bad but when drops take a toll on an aggressive physical defense because of playtime thats even worse

i think this is the biggest reason why we have had so many injuries on defense the offense needs to get their shit together and give the d time to recover
i dont think wash had a perfect defensive recipe there is an easy recipe that every team is using now teams are just rushing getting hands up and having lbs and safetys 5 yards off the line to disrupt the 35 4 yard passes a game
you guys are all forgetting the whole offense is out of whack without pouncey the timing on every single play is off that has a huge effect and one of the main reasons the offense just looked off yes the injuries on defense made a difference and of course the drops but it looked like ben was having to wait and react on every snap
im just glad we lost honestly we didnt deserve to win and this offense is about to worst ive ever seen its mind blowing we got this far before we lost
removed
diontae for all his drops should be a big part of the gameplan but i agree that washington should get increased looks i think he is our most underrated player
we have to have lost at least 200 yards on drops by dionte at least some of his drops were on deep passes that wouldve scored
diontae is one of our best wrs sadly he cant catch but hes constantly open quit overreacting
who cares what they deserve diontae gets targets because he gets open
you have a point and i agree that dropping easilycatchable targets should drop you down a peg or two on the pecking order especially when james washington is your fourth or fifth option

but when you start saying johnson is the worst wr in the league thats where people start telling you youre overreacting and rightfully so

why are yinzers so bad at constructive criticism why cant you look at a talented player with tons of potential and just point out that they need to work on some things without jumping straight to hes the worst in the league he needs cut

same with coaches its been about 13 straight years of yinzers bitching about our offensive coordinator 13 years of he should be fired immediately after every loss hell even every win where the offense struggled regardless of whether the offense is top three in the league or the team is 111 its always fire the coach burn it down and never man i wish we could just make these few minor adjustments to fix these couple issues

yeah dj needs to fix his drops yeah washington deserves more targets while dj is figuring out how hands work but no dj doesnt deserve to be cut or traded for a 7th rounder or some shit and hes definitely not the worst wr in the nfl
than diontae nope

but he deserves more for sure
he had two not great games in a row and yall ready to burn him at the stake wtf he still scored hes at least getting open more than juju has does he need to step it up yeah for sure but damn yall are ridiculous same people who were ready to get rid of washington two years ago
i think we all have to realize that lack of practice rest and just overall the situation the steelers have been put in this year is taking its toll you gotta think how many times you show up to work with less than ideal sleep and how lackluster your day can be they arent super beings they are still just regular people and although they are for sure a very talented team its a surprise they have shown as much resilience as they have to be 111 in my opinion
i dont think so hes a young receiver still developing steelers brass think hes the next ab

more than diontae is a stretch but he definitely needs to see the field a lot more
they all deserve more targets then ebron he has been a drop machine the last two weeks
get has always had his preferred receivers and he forces the ball their way hes forcing plays the ebron and johnson now finchner doesnt have the cred to overrule him
he deserves more targets but not over dj
my fantasy team says otherwise
now im hearing that they cut claypool snaps lmao didnt even consider diontae was the one hurting the team
from all the highs and lows of yesterday leave your final thoughtsanalysisdiscussiontakeaways from yesterdays game

this thread is intended for levelheaded mindful discussion and less kneejerk reactions keep this in mind before commenting

as always dont be a damn jagoff follow our rules we all have different opinions and mindsets but were all here to talk steelers and see them succeed at the end of the day keep it cool
people complaining that were getting smoked by the media need to get over it we lost and have played bad for 2 weeks against teams that on paper we should have trashed this is what happens
if the lockeroom doesnt like that fact beat the bills on primetime and show who we are
us sucking
our offense is too good and has too many weapons to have monumentally under achieved the way it has in the last 2 games
im not as brilliant as some of you are in things such as scheme and stuff but it seemed in the 4th quarter that ben started to call more plays and we started to move the ball more that is a very bad look for fichtner



also can someone explain to me what charlie batch meant about ol not disguising the runs should i be worried more about all the starters we lost yesterday or the washington member called ravens exposed us
the running game is the worst ive ever seen from the steelers

we have to rely on a 38 year old ben to throw 50 times a game to bail us out
our 70s teams finished 124 142 we can afford a few losses and luckily it was a game that doesnt affect our seed relax everyone we have time to work out the kinks
were going to know what kind of team we actually have really soon buffalo on sunday theyre a good team

how does this team respond lets be honest here theyve been progressing downwards the offense cant run the ball the line sucks will pouncey coming back to anchor the line improve that are they really that lost without his pre snap calls possibly

why are our talented receivers stone handed all of a sudden

the offense has to figure out how to put up points in the first quarter the d cant carry them the whole way the injuries piling up on the defensive side support that theyre getting gassed and the offense cant give them enough time to rest between drives

how this team responds on sunday night will be very telling for how the remainder of the regular season and playoffs will go theyve been riding high on an undefeated streak all the while hearing chatter from all angles calling them frauds that theyre not as good as their record would indicate then they drop this stinker to washington do they come out and put a hurting on buffalo shut down every aspect of their game and play a dominant 60 minutes and win or do they turtle and drop two consecutive the snowball effect that can have could be devastating
its been a while since weve lost a game like that one last night i was confident that we were going to drive the ball in the last two minutes for at minimum a game tying fg the tip ball at the line and interception by former steeler bostic was as disheartening as any loss in the last 3 years the bounce back is always sweeter
james conner was the mvp of the team last night

he didnt even play yet showed he is leagues better than snellmcfarland despite our overall pisspoor run game

i hope everyone appreciates that

randy fichtner needs fired into the sun
need to bounce back get back to running as our defense cant carry us we need to control the game
if you go for run plays on madden without beeing under center you usually get 0 or 1 yard just like we do in real life i dont understand why ben is so stubborn i know its not the problem but its part of it
the offensive line and the general offensive game plan have been a problem for weeks and it finally came back to bite them

first thing i would do is move feiler back to tackle and let dotson play lg chuks has been getting beat pretty handily and i think its also starting to take a toll on decastro i think this ends up solidifying the interior and the right side of the offensive line

on offensive gameplan here are some things to do to make it less one dimensional

get ben back under center more i know he loves shotgun so he can survey the field but its just one of many facets that make this offense one dimensional running out of shotgun is hard as it is let alone behind a suspect offensive line getting ben under center even if youre still passing out of it at least makes the front adjust to different things
bring back the jet sweeps and motion but also use them on passing downs not just as a clear indication of a run
attack the middle of the field in the intermediate passing game itll create space for your running backs to run and it will help to open up so much of that underneath stuff with that said
start throwing past the sticks on 3rd down the offensive design is not strong enough to create space for yac the way that kansas city new orleans etc do you have good receivers who can make plays down the field the drops are annoying but it doesnt matter as much when the defense has three guys ready to make a tackle short of the sticks
if we arent running the ball we need to get jw more looks hes been our most reliable receiver for over a year and we keep him buried on the depth chart
the most heartbreaking thing about this loss was that it never felt like we were really going to lose until we did at the end sure we had trouble here or there and it was always close but it felt like we had it and then it just went away i feel like maybe thats why we did end up losing that in our defense just needs time to breathe
well that was fun
we were high on our own supply time to buckle the fuck down and hit josh allen in the mouth
steelers need to have at least the threat of a run game otherwise its far too predictable id also like to see more creative play calling on third down i dont want low passes to a backup running back if the wr cant fix the drops and the defense gets hit with injuries they could be in trouble next week
tomlin putting the wrs on notice in his conference right now
chase young can fuck right off the ravens exposed something in the steelers yeah that you had an extra week of rest and preparation douche
does our offense suck or has the league figured us out
gonna try to keep this one short and sweet with two main points

we are 111 first place in the north first place in the conference one and only team in the afc to currently hold a week 1 bye we control our own destiny we are fine no we shouldnt fire randy no we shouldnt tomlin you guys need to relax do you know how many people would kill to be 111 i promise you that these issues are fixable firing a coach would just cause more harm so stop even entertaining the idea

i am a firm believer in complimentary football both the offense and special teams are simply not helping this defense and that needs to change they are on the field far too much and often times in poor field position
im not overly concerned with respect to the ravens exposing us and wft capitalizing on it 1 the ravens are very familiar with what we do and vice versa and 2 if wft was so tuned in to what we were going to do was it their game plan to get down by two tds that makes no sense yeah we cant run all that well but there are other playoff teams with that issue kc is middling at it miami and buffalo arent all that great at it either and wft has one of the better young dls in the league the biggest concern is the drops its one thing for ebron to drop a pass here and there but yesterday was ridiculous and the same for dj clean half of those up and this game is likely a double digit w

i am concerned about the injuries on defense though weve already have a big hole in the middle losing bush spillane has been solid as a replacement and now hes injured losing bud obviously is rough and missing two very good cbs is obviously problematic

in short id like to see how we play on sunday night before hitting any panic buttons
time to see what adjustments are going to be made over this week that is going to be the tell tale sign of what kind of team we really are and who our coaches are

coach t can come out and say whatever he wants about how badly we sucked and be brutally honest as he has been but none of that means shit if this team doesnt actually change

one of the most disappointing things about this loss is i think we were all expecting to see some sort of damn change in our offense from the ravens game to the washington game but nothing did playcalling remained the exact same rf is completely holding this offense back with his atrocious playcalling and play design i think making him the oc was a damn mistake regardless of how close him and ben are randy isnt working out its so clear and teams have figured out our damn vanilla ass offense i dont know what can be done but if ben can just somehow call the plays with being able to fall back on the qb coach and back ups for advice that would be the best possible solution at this point i dont expect the steelers to just fire randy at this point in the season but hes just not working out for us
i think having to play with jc hassenauer instead of maurkice pouncey these last two games has been much more of a detriment to the offense than anyone has let on

i just cant imagine them having the same level of ineptitude in the running game and short yardage situations with pouncey available
heres how i know i am not objective about this team i keep thinking theyre doing things to keep them off of film so they can run them in the playoffs no jet sweeps for weeks no outside runs no middle range passes
not beating anyone by being one dimensional cant run the ball drops not sustaining drives a good way to burn out the defense fast i thought after the ravens game it was a good thing that they were disgusted but apparently it was for show because nothing changed

well see what sunday night brings but theyve got another tough game and on the road
id rather play shitty and lose than play shitty and win these coaches and players need to fix a lot and the loss really highlights that im tired of squeaking out wins when we should be putting teams away

im also realizing that the schedule changes have totally screwed us everyone is getting hurt and as we were losing last night the d just looked like strangers out there we really need spillane haden nelson etc healthy out there
why did we cut wiz
first and foremost we are 111 so remember the sky isnt falling personally i was hoping for 10 wins and a playoff berth this season which means they have already exceeded my expectations

that being said we have an obvious problem other teams dbs are sitting on the short pass game because we are one dimensional i dont think this is a ben or randy issue but a ben and randy issue this is what both of them like ben in shotgun throwing 50 times a game so in my mind it is irrelevant who is calling plays because they will both default to the same style of offense be prepared for more of the same going forward 50 short passes a few deep sideline throws and 10ish sidecar handoffs from shotgun

our defense is showing cracks but i think some of that is attributable to a lack of complimentary football and some comes from a loss of major contributors to injury if we were able to posses the ball with regularity our d would look much better

sadly i doubt we are going to get much adjustment from ben and randy on the offense that isnt going to get us to the super bowl unless bush and bud magically heal up so the d is back at full strength
why did claypool get so few snaps actual question if that was finchners plan and hes not hurt or anything then we legitimately need to fire him because diontae and ebron were playing like absolute shit
poorly coached game wrs cant catch ebron cant catch run game was absolutely horrendous defense gives up too many big plays especially on x and long defense misses a lot of tackles why sign that k if you cant trust him to hit a 45 yard field goal

you can only play shitty for so long before it bites you in the ass if we play like that against the bills we will be blown out of the stadium

tomlin ripped into this team on wednesday and they still played like dogshit yesterday they better wake up next week
learn how to catch the ball and get even an average run game going and we can finish the year strong we werent exactly great running with conner and pouncey but its even worse with them out

defense is getting thin so ball control becomes even more imperative
when it comes to the playoffs i think the defense can keep them and win them games but i feel theres real concerns with how reliable the offence is they dont have a great running game and i feel like every receiver except washington has an issue with drops i think theyre trying to do that new england style short passing game but good defences like baltimore and washington have started to figure out how to slow it down
i knew we were going to lose the minute they had the drive after going up 140 and they ran 2 passes on a 3 and out inside the 2 minute warning also was ridiculous the refs gifted was 3 points officiating was terrible in this game btw you cannot win a game throwing the ball 50 times and not being able to run the ball especially while having the lead

ever since the tennessee game its been obvious the steelers cant run the ball which is why they can only win ugly whereas in the beginning of the year they were dominating their opponents because they could close out the game by running the ball and controlling the clock

if they fix their oline run blocking and become more balanced on offense theyre a super bowl contender if not theyre going to get smoked in the playoffs
1have to get back to fundamentals on pass receptions looks like a lot of putting the cart before the horse and not finishing the playcatch

2fixsolidify run game we do not have bettis anymore we need to find ways to help snell and co succeed is missing conner hurting yes but shouldnt completely tank the run otherwise were going to get jammed up passing all the time

3defense looking more beat up and depleted daily wonder if they need to figure out a different game plan to close up the middle of the field now
we have a weird offensive line that wont allow ben to be sacked but cant run block for shit what the hell
we are still 110 with bosgod all hail the
people are talking about the pivotal moments in this game failing to punch it in on 4th and 1 critical calls by the officials alex smith walking off with the ball ebron not getting out of bounds at the end the batted int in the 4th quarter

sure all of those being different could have won us the game but if its just those moments that change are we proud of the game otherwise im not whether we squeak out a win or lose like we did heres what matters we played 4 quarters of bad football

i hope this game is a kick in the pants weve been sliding into mediocrity for weeks playing good football wins in the playoffs a bad football team who squeaked out 16 bad victories doesnt make waves in the postseason
as frustrating as the past weeks have been i cant help but feel for our guys its hard enough to win 11 games in a row in a normal nfl season but this one has been extra trying hope they can find a way to rest and get out of their own heads
can we just try to have watt lead block and conner follow behind just try it old school once or twice please
all yesterday told me is that if alex smith was 100 all year the football team does not have 7 losses
tomlins presser after the game was good i appreciate how blunt he is talking about routine plays routinely and how the receivers at this level are paid to catch these passes and they will be replaced if they cant do their job hopefully he fires the squad up for buffalo that is probably our biggest game yet although the browns might pose a challenge too
we need conner even though running backs are easy to replace and hes likely gone unless he signs a really cheap contract not having a running back who can be reliable can hurt the offense last night clearly showed it
if were being honest the win streak was amazing and fun but we were stumbling a lot in a few games


our goal isnt am undefeated season its the stairway to 7 this loss doesnt change that


learn from it dont do it in the playoffs
it could just be me but did anyone else feel like jaylen samuels made no effort to stop bostic intercepting that batted ball i watched in slow mo quite a few times and he was only a couple yards behind it and made zero effort to stop it yeah i understand it may have not meant anything since we had like 12 seconds or something but at least there was a sliver of hope
remember when we scraped into the playoffs on a 6th seed with a mediocre team and won the super bowl
i saw nothing from alex highsmith that shows he can pressure the qbat all duprees injury pretty much ended any super bowl hope

its good we lost one regular season game its better to be 151 than 160 when we inevitability get destroyed by kansas city avoid getting completely humiliated as a 160 team
i have confidence that we will be able to fix our issues as they are blatantly obvious id be more worried if it was unclear what we were doing wrong so identifying the issues should not be hard for our coaches just need to buckle down and fix them
any idea why theyre not using jaylen samuels at all in the running game
im sad
sphincter fichtner is an actual problem and really needs to gtfo of pittsburgh
defence made so many bad plays tj tried to get up while a loose ball was under him 66 got a play that reset the downs and cost us a touchdown
im blaming dropped passes i think if you fix those we win this game
this is not related to this season at all but im curious what everyone thinks about the qb situation in philly after announcing that wentz was benched for jalen hurts i cant imagine the eagles have much in the way of future plans for wentz according to sportrac there is an out in wentzs contract after next season didnt look in depth at it so not sure who controls that out does anyone believe wentz has the ability to be a high level qb in a different organizationshould we take that gamble if the opportunity arises given we are playing with a somewhat injury prone 38 year old qb currently

edit i may be blinded by how hilarious it would be if a guy left philadelphia for pittsburgh and turned back into a super bowl caliber player a man can dream
whoever said yesterday inb4 a member of the 72 dolphins says something about being the greatest undefeated team ever literally called it lmao damn larry csonka
have to figure out how to get our run game going doesnt have to be a masterful run game but it should be more positive plays than negative at this point ill appreciate anything over negative yards the drops arent the worst thing ever but it seems to come at the most crucial part of the drive fix those and well stay on course for 7 the defense isnt a worry for me because chiefs won last year with a middle of the pack defense they just got stops when they needed them for the love of the football gods duct tape spit super glue or whatever the hell we can do to piece together some consistency on offense
zero creativity in the play calling we used to be able to swap out different backs and consistently get good yardage out of them i know wsh had a run defense but not even trying to squeeze a few running yards out of snell every once in awhile to keep the chains moving really paints the rest of the offense into a corner

also kick the fucking fg we dont want to let the rookie kick a fg in the 2nd3rd quarter because of obvious reasons yet we were going to rely on him to kick the game winner with 5 seconds left makes no sense offense couldnt score the entire first half and were still not taking the points
they need to readjust jujus role in offense i dont think hes being used to his full capability so far that and james washington needs to start getting significantly more playing time imo if that means the other guys have to take a step back in terms of time on the field i think thats ok
i feel like we dont appreciate james connor enough and we mightve won if we had him
can someone help me understand why the offensive line can do well at pass defense but is unable to move the line and be effective in the run game i get that ben is getting the ball out quickly but besides that i just dont understand offensive line play and isnt it the same players from last year whats the disconnect last year our run wasnt this bad
scheme wasnt a problem guys were getting schemed open we just didnt execute

miscommunication on defense is hurting us at critical moments

o line needs to be as energetic on runs as they are on pass protection
benny snell is doo doo
randy fichter is so bad at calling plays i rather rehire tod haley

so how did claypools date with losing go
i may be blind or something but is vance mcdonald hurt
see you guys in buffalo
man look bottom line is weve been fucked at every corner this season from getting an early bye week to injuries and to game reschedules them boys are tired i think this loss will definitely help us a lot more than hurt us on top of exhaustion they have had to deal with constant bullshit from the media and fans of other teams that were patiently waiting to take a shit on pittsburgh its all good a perfect season isnt the goal winning the sb is
i would rather of saw james harrison out there vs highsmith dude was fucking invisible they have to go out and get someone else he didnt even get close to alex smith
removed
removed

honestly after seeing the way he responded when it happened im taking that as good news

i like what ive seen from williamson so far but theyre going to need to play a bit more dime moving forward to cover the middle of the field
im not even worried about home field anymore i just want the best most rested version of the steelers in the playoffs hopefully the cleveland game wont matter
ive said this way too many times this year but next man up avery williamson time
the thinnest position group just got thinner
its unlikely to be covered by nonpittsburgh media since the biggest superstars on defense tj minkah and heyward are all healthy but this defense is absolutely gutted with injuries both starting corners are battling injuries they lost an elite edge player for the year the starting ilb and his backup are out players along the dl starters and depth alike have been on and off the covid list

i know i often tell off the naysayers people who want radical changes that wont actually help but if the steelers lose bills on sunday and the browns beat the ravens in cleveland on monday were looking at a mere one game lead for the division with the week 17 finale looming were talking about keeping pace with the chiefs for the 1 seed so losing to wft an nfc team is preferable if theyre going to lose any game but honestly i think its fair to sweat about the division

edited my comment i dont tell off the naysayers its perfectly fair to criticize the team and point out flaws i only tell off the batshit insane people who say this team isnt perfect so fire the coaches and that will fix all the problems im not thrilled with a lot of fichtners choices from yesterday but how stupid do you have to be to think fire him with no backup plan will automatically fix whatever you dont like while maintaining whatever you do like no your fat ass on the couch seeing ben making adjustments or dobbs wearing a headset does not mean that either of them can become the regular play caller
at this point if were not losing guys for the season ill take it home field doesnt mean shit for these playoffs anyway our defense is depleted of starters and we just need to squeak a couple more wins
is ug3 healthy
tough hit but silver lining is that he should be back in a few weeks holding on to the number one seed is gonna be tough but lets remember we are still an 111 team and anything can happen in the playoffs anyone know if gilbert is getting close to returning its gonna be bince and williamson but we could use some speed i guess allen could play more
big miss he was playing superb real old school steelers football player
this is actually good news i thought he was another one done for the season
bless all the knees
good thing they made the trade
sucks that we have 2 key defensive players down our defence didnt adapt at all last game and made so many miss play
this is a bigger deal than people seem to think this guy was the green dot on the defense and being on the team for as long as he had was familiar with the system theres a reason he got it over vince and its crazy to think williamson can just step into that role

look how out of position the defense looked at spillane went outits going to be rough next week
you know its bad when the backup gets injured
thats amazing news honestly
really have been enjoying avery williamson on his limited reps so far seems to play the ball fast and solid tackler he should step in just fine

i am more concerned about alex highsmith
removed
he and ebron are getting an insanely high amount of targets diontae is getting targeted like he is davante adams this team needs more james washington
jimmy wash needs to see the field more always makes a play when called upon
our luck itll be above freezing in orchard park this sunday night s
youre right and his multiple 100 yard games before this week were meaningless i say we just cut him hes the worst

heres to hoping we wont be using chase for this again
i mentioned in the game thread ugh that im not seeing it with snell it was not a popular take i dont get it what do you guys see that im not seeing hes a downhill zero cut runner who is easily stopped if he doesnt get momentum


on the other side of the junior coin is mcfarland i think hes got potential if he can just learn what is a hole and what is not a hole in the nfl


i think conner does a much better job than both and i really hope hes up for a stretch run
we just have very average rbs all around none of them do anything particularly well
the deal is hes terrible

the steelers have excelled at the strategy of taking college producers who fall due to poor metrics then training them up in the nfl letting their natural athleticism come out

benny doesnt have any natural athleticism it turns out after two years of training up hes still a one dimensional slow twitch plodder

cut bait try again thats drafting for you
you could put derrick henry back there and it wouldnt matter watch the tape the oline gets bullied snap after snap after snap theyre very bad
snell is slow and has very bad vision that can sometimes be overcome by being a pure bruiser but he isnt that either because hes too small
i mean its hard our line hasnt really done a good job w blocking honestly i feel like our line hasnt been the same since munchak left
hes not good doesnt look for holes not fast not elusive was taken off the field for 4th and 1 after failing on 3 and 1 and they choose to throw it deep to a backup rookie rb that should tell you how they feel about snell
benny is alright but hes an outside runner fichtner is trying to run benny between the tackles and james outside the tackles dude has his shit reversed
i miss jerome bettis
he and the rest of the rbs need to go mcfarland is the only one that even does okay and its because no one has really seen him play lol
hes a downhill zero cut runner who is easily stopped if he doesnt get momentum

sorry are we talking about snell or conner
snell isnt very good he is similar to conner in that way
what are you expecting him to be theres a reason hes only used in short yardage situations and rarely comes in for a spell to give conner rest
he runs like a dump truck
its almost impossible to give any rb a fair evaluation behind the current ol
snell is what he isa backup rb
when you have 5 rbs you have 0 rbs

he had one bad game chill

i had a guy who frequents rravens randomly pm me about our loss while also wishing me to get covid lmfao

imagine being 65 and that butthurt
note this was modified by a friend of mine after seeing a similar image posted here a week or two ago had to have the shot glass in that image taken out and the edges smoothed a bunch to make it more usable

x200b

he then removed extra text i would have preferred that on but im not gonna complain
anyone else think mike tomlin looked happier with a loss today than a win on wednesday i know losses suck but im starting to think chasing get perfection was more stressful to the steelers than it was worth
i think he probably looked happy because he found out none of the new injuries are season enders
hes probably happy that he has a legitimate excuse to make practice hell this week if im him good thing im not because hes an elite head coach while im just a jagoff i make these fuckers practice outside all week and make the entire team run a lap every time a receiver drops a pass
i think the 98 or 97 broncos held the same sentiment but injuries are taking a toll on the defense once spillane haden and nelson are back things should look up again but in the meantime the offense needs to get aggressive or this is just gonna be a skid the 09 saints could afford a late season sputter we cant
team looked like shit i dunno
idk about tomlin but i certainly felt that way this team needed a loss as weird as it is to say to bring them back down to earth gotta get back to fundamentals and if we were going to drop a game this was the one to lose
i think tomlins style of coaching is extreme motivating to be successful im sure you run out of coaching material if you win every week now that theyve lost he can open up that part of his repertoire
i dont think he was happy i think he just expected it he was watching his team play bad the last two and wasnt gonna be like when the l came idk if pros still do laps and updowns for punishment but i bet you them boys are going through something at practice rn

if it comes down to paying someone on defense hilton for example or juju give me the defense all day
peoples juju obsession is starting to get creepy juju isnt anything special

imagine paying juju over mike hilton
juju went from being a legit deep threat who could run crazy routes and make contested catches against some of the leagues best corners to a 4yard slant king

i dont blame him for that because its our own offensive coordinators dumbass fault for how they are scheming him i love juju but this season proved he is not worth paying there are a ton of guys that can do what he does for this team offensively and i seriously doubt this is what juju wants to be doing at this point

writing was on the wall last night with his reactions
juju had 27 yardspay him for what exactly
not til his contract comes up its idiotic not to keep him cheap until then

edit i just realized this post is about juju and not james washington lmfao why did you use a picture of both of them with washington holding the ball if you were talking about juju lmfao
i dont know if juju will want to come back he might be enjoying it here but going elsewhere will probably be better for his wallet he had great numbers in 17 and 18 but hes not stuffing the stat sheet recently which will effect his next contract
weve fazed juju out for a wr with the worst hands in the league why would we consider paying him

minkah is fine haden has a concussion
minkah came back looked like he prob got the wind knocked out of him his ribs might be a bit sore but he came back and was fine
i thought minkah straight up broke his wrist he like superman flew into that tackle hands first i thought he was done thankful he came back in the game

our hof qb is coming off elbow surgery and clearly isnt as good as he used to be and its apparent in his inability to push the ball down the field accurately hes also very injury prone and aging

our rb is far below average at the moment and when connor comes back he is at best an average rb who can only run up the middle cant run outside the tackles

we dont have a true 1 reciever not to mention all of them are young and our wrs and tes are very prone to drops and have been all season

our line cant block well enough to create running room for the backs and likely cant block long enough for ben to stand in the pocket for more than 2 secs consistently

i honestly want to know what plays we have had success with that you want us to run it genuinely intrigues me the only play that works are short passes so i dont know what you want him to call when its so painfully obvious that we only have 1 option of play

like for example if we actually had a capable running game like the browns or titans no one here would have a problem with running the ball on first and 2nd down but guess what we dont have a good running game

playcalling doesnt matter if the players cant execute
stopped reading at the first bullet point it was literally elbow surgery
djs and ebrons drops are the only issue that needed fixing in order for us to be a comfortable 120

if bens top targets catch the ball we contend for a sb if they dont we dont the gameplan and playcalling were more than good enough to win against an overmatched team yesterday the receivers werent
ngl the whole alex smith forgetting to leave the field was bullshit they got the three points to win the game from that the steelers were shitty thoughlike shitty
the first point was bad an inaccurate enough but then you claimed conner can only run between the tackles when he is undeniably at his best when running outside
randys burner acct
we might have the 1 pass protecting ol and the 32 run blocking ol thats our first problem

second is fichtner its undeniable that he works well with ben and so were unlikely to find anyone better until ben leaves but were not scheming people open were relying on the players to be better than the guys across from them in most cases they are which is why were 111 but its not like were buffalo or san fran who are able to get guys open just based off the scheme when our guys drop passes were going to struggle
how can you blame any of the running backs do you see how awful our offensive line is the steelers offensive line is one of the worst in the league if not the worst in the league
idk why everyone expects the offense to be good when it is poorly coached and the qb doesnt practice

these guys catch balls from rudolph all week and then roethlisberger on sunday of course theyre going to be sloppy
one of our first 2 picks this draft better be used on a running back conner isnt the answer snell and mcfarland definitely arent either if you cant get a yard on 4th and 1 you arent going to win in the post season
we played 3 games in 12 days its never happened in the nfl and it will never happen again the body wasnt built to play that much football at this level our guys were gassed and now has the injury bug the nfl fucked us plain and simple

and in the conference
are we still first in the conference too
ugh and done by an nfc east flunkie whose collective division record is 16 wins afc n is at 28 should be toby not jim in the clip
bummed at the loss but this video is absolutely hilarious
the name plate is a really nice detail lol
i liked that washington team i hope gibson can recover from his toe injury soon they are going to run that division for the next few years im still mad that we lost but im okay with who we lost to it doesnt hurt us in the standings
it had to happen eventually all good things come to an end all the bandwagons you can leave now
still 1 in the league kcs loss came against a division opponent so we still have tie breakers against them
lol they got us on that one wft are legit though especially on defense they could become a problem for the nfc in the upcoming years on an unrelated note ive always liked their burgundy colored jerseys
the amount of slander and steelers are frauds comments on their twitter was insane i think prior to this year and being undefeated most people didnt care that much about us but to go undefeated for so long and not always have a high scoring game like the chiefs it put a target on our backs

i was so down after the game but my friendwho is a diehard washington fan told me hey at least youre still going to the playoffs that cheered me up so quick lol
beautiful ive been staring at it for hours now have my free award
usavevideo
we needed to lose so we can understand that we arent perfect and anyone can beat us they are still nfl teams regardless of wl ratio we just need to beat the browns and bengals so we can sweep the division
beautiful
i live in the cleveland area and and all the browns monkeys are talking shit
god bless
57
ill give them credit the videos pretty funny
wasnt this posted by the official washington ft twitter lmao
so the ravens cant win but the browns still could interesting

can someone explain having a decorative pumpkin in december isnt that a halloween thing canadian asking
no man this was my fault i forgot to wear my lucky shirt to bed the night before game day i accept the blame
guys this was all me this is the first game i didnt watch with my 2 year old son all season as i was still at work

i vow to skip work for every odd scheduled game for the remainder of the season

1st seed baybee

i think that trick play really cemented it for me when the team knew they had to resort to trickery because they couldnt rely on our line and running backs to push for 12 a yard is a sad moment
how bout running a qb sneak 4 times if youre worried about ben put in someone else
then take the 3 points i wish tomlin would accept who we are the run game problems are too deep to fix this far into the season with the guys we have im much happier losing doing what we do best leaning on defense instead we are trying to go for it when we already know what this offense is capable of that was the only real frustrating thing to me yesterday

throwing a fade to a guy who has like 5 catches total ever on this team on 4th down was also one of those we dont deserve to win scenarios too lol
catstrophic is also what id call ebrons blocking effort on the 4th down run
throwing it 4 yards deep on 3rd and 13 twice and running on 3rd and 10 is also fucking catastrophic yet it never seems to be addressed
qb dive 4 times in a row if you got to ben gets it in 9 times out of 10 i get preserving the qb but hes not made of glass brady does it all the time
damn right ive been saying that for years throwing on 3rd and 1 is a joke run the goddamn ball down their throats if you cant get 1 yard rushing on any given play you suck and dont deserve to win
rtomlinisms
without any nuts and bolts the wheels will start to come off
thats when we miss the bus
nuts and bolts of football


add that to the list
aint nobody disagreeing glad it was against wft we needed to be humbled

i know very little about the protocol itself i know its 12 days rest then you can be allowed to join team actives again if cleared by a doctor or is the timeline base on the severity of the injury
you can pretty much assume he will be out for the bills game i cant remember the last time someone went into the protocol and then played same week

what about bos i dont want another game where we feel going for it on 4th and 1 is a better option than a field goal attempt
is haden a definite out or is there a chance he can clear protocol before sunday
any word on haden diggs will kill us if he and nelson dont come back
having steven nelson back will help having robert spillane out for any time will hurt though because now the steelers would be down to a thirdstring ilb
also as a lions fan fuck the refs
i just caught a ban on rnfl for daring to question the rehab messiahs fourth timeout but hey thats reddit man
i figured youd feel for us more because of droptimus prime
when its against the steelers its cute and silly and a 200 iq play but i guarantee you if it was against the chiefs or pats it would get called out 10 times out of 10 and the league and sports media would lose their shit the referee literally watched alex smith run right past him off the field after motioning for the ball and just stood there and let it happen sorry but if you want to play keep away with the ball on offense while the game clock runs down thats 100 on you i know 3 points wouldnt have made a difference in the game and im not at all blaming it for their loss but its this kind of shit that screws the steelers year after year and im fed up with it
you win some of those you lose some thats not why we lost
honestly i thought it was a riot thats some old school dickery and as a steelers fan i respected it smith was playing chess on that play and some quick thinking most new qbs wouldnt have that situational awareness

we didnt lose by 3 we lost by 6 and we beat ourselves good for wft
as a lions fan how are you feeling about ebron

i still like ebron hes loads better than most tight ends we have had recently
the way i see it the steelers got away with one last week and if youre up 11 on a lesser team at the half you cant really point to something like this as the reason you lost they had less than 100 total yds in the 2nd half dropped a ton of passes in this game couldnt get one yard at the goal line abandoned the running game after sucking at running all season and barely even thought about throwing downfield in the 2nd half and thats just talking about the offense

if youre pointing at that call and the 3 wft pts associated with it as the reason for the l you watched a different game than i did
dear lions fan id like stafford to be bens eventual replacement
we got away with one last week we got karma this week and wft got away with one it all evens out the game should never have been close enough for that to matter
i dont understand why players are allowed to leave the field with the ball at all
as a steelers fan you cant be mad at this but okay with our stunt against the ravens last week it certainly isnt the reason we lost
cant be mad it isnt why we lost steelers are a winning franchise we dont concern ourselves with fourth timeouts or the play of refs
most egregious noncall ive ever seen

most would say its the most egregious since last weeks end of the first half thats why its tough to make a big scene about it
removed
apparently you must have missed vince williams taking a little nap on the 1 yard line against the ravens to run the clock out at halftime wednesday

this was in reference to the attempt at passing to the righttackle fyi
damn zach i see you
how did no one put this shit in here already this is funny as fuck

exposed what the offense cant run the ball just keep the receivers in front of you and wait for them to drop the ball

if you have an above averagegreat dline youre gonna give the steelers oline some problems

if your defense can do a 4 man rush effectively and has depth at lb and db you can slow down the steelers passing attack
weve barely won half our games and the same issues have plagued us throughout the season baltimore exposed nothing washington just had more time to prepare and got it done
cool they can know what its like to watch the playoffs on tv
defensive geniuses all they had to do was knock spillane and haden out of the game why didnt anyone else think of that
i love how they act like they cracked the code we dropped a fuckload of passes and lost two of our key players on defense not to mention our starting center is out conner is out and we had a kicker whos farthest field goal is like 38 yards if thats cracking the code then call me bill belichick
washingtonfootball de montez sweat runs off heinz field yelling i knew it i knew it i knew it when i ask chase young he says we all did baltimore exposed some things steelers

i blame this loss completely on you
my thing was that they kept winning and i hadnt worn a jersey so i had that thing
i never wash it until we lose then i was the stink of failure off it now im washing literally stink off it since it has t been washed in almost a year same rules apply to my socks and my towel
its the cunt that posted a meme of us 120 in the 2nd quarter
i wear my jersey every sunday but because the game was on monday i went to work and went straight to my dads to watch the gamebecause he is a huge washington fan so if you want to blame someone blame me for not having my jersey
i didnt wash mine but i didnt wear mine either i was at work last night wore it for the wednesday game while at work and sweated my ass off all night so i opted not to wear it last night i regret my decision and take full responsibility sorry fam wont let it happen again
i was tired and fell asleep during most of the game its the first game i didnt watch 100 of this season i blame myself about to go buy some energy drinks for sunday
i did five seasons unwashed i washed it prior to the thanksgiving game to be presentable for dinner im so sorry
i got my terrible towels for yesterdays game so it must have been that
my jersey is still in the closet i didnt wear it so it wasnt my fault they lose every time i do wear it
i agree its the dipshits who posted 120 stuff early
i watched the game normally i dont because out of area
i bet on the steelers for the first time all season
was in meetings on zoom forgot to put my lucky jersey on sorry everyone
i can now shave my mustache
im sorry guys i put out a steelers flag on my lawn on monday i let yinz down
forgot to wear my chain on game day for the first time this season
im grateful that ben hasnt been sacked much this season but the run game has been nonexistent of late how much do you think the loss of the great mike munchak as ol coach is to blame for this
our pass protection has still been really good but 35 of our starters are 30 or older so declining was natural
with pouncey averaging 42 ypc without they at 28
i dont even think thats the problem the problem is our offensive scheme

we use the short passing game as an extension of the run game that means opposing defenses can have the same formation to stack the box and play the pass

also its fucking obvious if we run or pass the ball that makes it so easy to stop us

what we need to do is increase the average depth of target for passing plays make it 10 or 15 yards no need to take deep shots down the field

just medium shots in the middle of the field can open up their defenses so much more and then they have to choose to stop the run or the pass not both
if munchak is so great why isnt denvers line better
lack of sacks is a direct result of bens 2 second release time on 3 yard routes the oline is not good and id bet 100 dollars the decastro is hurt and will have some kind of surgery when the year is over
very little our two studs on the ol are old time to draft another dotson has been a nice surprise
idk but i saw mike munchak leave a tied buccos game in the top of the 9th and it soured me on him ever since fantastic player great coach baseball fan who leaves at the top of the 9th in a tie ball game

that video is from 2014 and he was originally talking about todd haley but it is surprisingly accurate even 6 years later
fire dat mother fucker

truer words have never been spoken
coach tomlin this is snoop dogg

yes snoop he knows who you are lol
listen to him mike the man speaks the truth fire the hippy do ittttt
i seem to remember snoop giving the kiss of death to todd haley as well

deliver us from mediocrity saint snoop
hard to argue with snoop
he aint lying
seems crazy to call for this at 111 but when you cant score more than 17 at home against an average defense it gets really hard to defend our one dimensional offense
ah celebrity sports fans and providing the insight of the oc sucks name a better combo

struck through celebrity because it wasnt necessary
this is the best thing ive seen all day
i like how he introduced himself to coach as if hes not one of the most famous rappers of all time
fire ben

james washingtons music
washington needs a raise missed one ball and never dropped it again lmaoo
if you cant catch it then youll get the donte moncrief treatment
hes really not having any of it

the coaching of catching the football for those who are employed to do it at this level is not something that ive got a lot of patience for its not something that any of us have a lot of patience for those guys job is to catch the football particularly the routine ones
those dropped catches killed us nothing more deflating
good diontae should rightfully drop down the list then
in my opinion juju needs a more significant role in the offense deeper passes down the field and more targets not just 5 yard routes over the middle
the standard is the standard and things of that nature
it sucks cuz diontae is a stud outside of drops
i know vance has been out what the heck happened to him in the passing game all i see is him running down the sideline and stiff arming a defender into the turf like a facepalm from hell and they dont throw to him anymore
so at what point does that happen because dj is leading the league in drops and im guessing ebron is leading for tes
these guys need to live in front of the jugs machine for a few days
if you throw the ball 60 times a game there are going to be drops how about finding an oline coach that can get a run block scheme going maybe some dude in denver or something
tomlin acting like he has replacements whos he going to bring in rayray he cant even field a punt cleanly anymore
i still dont understand how washington lead the team in receiving last year and then effectively got benched this year thats really got to fuck with your head every time hes out there hes trying to prove something
not making excuses for the wrs but if they are catching weak sauce passes from the red nosed backup qb all week in practice maybe they arent used to the quick bullet big ben is sending their way
diontae why do i hear boss music
itt people that thing wrs all play the same position and just think washington for diontae is 11 replacement

diontae is the x hes got the best route tree is the most explosive with the ball in his hands and gets the best separation hes not getting replaced coachs speak nothing else
mike tomlin is a badass thats fucking football right there none of that pansy ass dick tugging smile for the camera bullshit men puke men poop on the field men deliver their new born baby on the side lines fucking hard core dick in the ass butterball foosball fuck it chuck it game time shit

edit guys its a copypasta popular on rnfl
while big ben is launching bullets from point blank range thats no excuse for dropping that many balls the receivers are trying to run before they get the ball
deion cain season
strange cause dionte keeps getting the lions share of snaps while making the lions share of drops
this sucks because diontae has had some awesome catches also
2801td

big man up next
im so glad he finally said it i was getting tired of the we suck and need to be better it just felt like a half assed apology
i want to know if we arent running power because we just cant or because we want to stay in these personnel groupings
baw gahd is that james washington with his big strong hands
dionte and ebron caught a case of agholor hands
is that why claypool only had 31 snaps despite having fewer drops than juju and diontae
i actually liked seeing more throws to mcfarland and samuels hope we continue to see that though the 4th down throw to mcfarland wasnt the best call

a few weeks ago it wouldve been crazy to talk about moving passes from this elite wr core to running backs but here we are
i didnt get to watch the game how many drops did we have
stern words considering this isnt a new issue this year also why has claypools targets dropped so drastically
damn straight
makes sense
right so when can we expect to stop force feeding 85 and 18 then
you can clearly see the issue with ebron and johnson is they are concentrating on the direction they are going after the catch before the ball is caught they need to keep eyes on the ball until pocession is made worry about after catch yardage after
i agree with most of the sentiment in here that work needs to be done everyone needs to remember though with our current pass only offence the amount of dropped passes will rise just due to percentages
pick me up coach i can catch
bring back martavis and wheaton crazy bastards but its their time to shine
better question why is mcfarland still on this fuckin team when he averages 13 ypc and cant catch


im a simple man if i see a roll model i upvote
wfts social media has been posting memes since last night because they have literally nothing else to celebrate or be happy about ever
her welcome to brittsburgh tshirt is one of my christmas presents to myself this year she also has some sick steelers inspired ring gear
impact is on tonight you tuning in
that gif is freaking classic though lol cole got launched into the dark dimension lol
who

ravens sub has been trashing the steelers more than any other sub no other sub comes close either i browse them all my goodness
i just think its annoying they call us fraudsworst 110 team because steelers are still tied with the chiefs for the most wins against teams above 500 the 72 dolphins and 07 patriots both played in significantly easier divisions than this years steelers
if tomlin feels like he can smile in the face of this loss then i think i can too
i mean to washington and everyone else that was a super bowl for them meanwhile it took til december to lose the 1st one not sweating it
this is so relatable but itll be alright it was a terrible cocktail of bullshit from the short schedule to loosing so many pieces of our defense to dropped balls i really hope this is the wake up that finally gets everyone on the team ready get connor back and establish a run game stop dropping passes and demolish the bills
im dragging us in my head not because of a loss but because weve played garbage games the past two weeks and havent shown much that makes me confident in a deep playoff run let a lone a superbowl win anything can happen and i still hope we turn it around but weve got problems that need addressing and they just seem to be getting worse
frauds you finally lost to a good team shut up they only got like 4 days to relax and train after beating the ravens that is no time at all sure some plays were sloppy but thats just 1 game
colin cowherd has really been laying into us
i enjoy the browns just pipe dreaming about all the possibilities of maybe maybe being able to catch up
agreed they better lookout too cause when play offs happen were going off
must be tough to have one loss
tbh forward looking for this team we need to draft a qb to replace ben yes our wrs have been dropping passes but i also know that ben cant throw long bombs as well as he could compared to a few years ago he cant play forever and he will hit that wall that all qbs hit once their skill level drops we also need to draft a rb and te in the next draft snell is not good conner is inconsistent im not a fan of ebron drops way too many easy passes
just wait until after josh allen drags us on snf i feel like thats our rock bottom game our d is banged up and our o cant run and is predictable af gonna be a long night in buffalo

may be why we didnt see much claypool yesterday will be interesting to see ebrons involvement next week

it is starting to feel to me like with the injures piling up and the lack of rest the team has had that we are losing our edge in other sports teams routinely rest people to make sure they are fresh for the playoffs in the nfl it seems like they only do that ifwhen theres nothing left to play for typically home field advantage is something worth risking it for or is it but this year thats way less of a concern than having a rested focused squad since we will probably clinch a playoff berth before sunday night i feel like we should not play our starters sunday night here are my reasons why i think this is a great idea

1 rest our guys avoid further injury risk reset mentally

2 cincy coming up next week without their starting qb seems like win 12 which should be enough for the division playing a fully rested squad here would seal the deal

3 dont give a potential playoff opponent in buffalo any tape on our matchup

4 fuck the nfl over for dicking with our schedule so badly by giving them a backup squad in primetime

5 give our depth guys some highprofile minutes since our injury situation is what it is improves next man up mentality

i know we will not do this but what do you guys think about the idea i also think the second we clinch the division we should shut the first team down for the reasons stated above kc hasnt been any better at home than on the road this year i have no fear of going on the road and winning i do have fear of us just running out of gas and losing to anyone anywhere
this way of thinking is the only way they go 115 and miss the playoffs or lose early you cant just take weeks off and expect to be able to turn it up a notch
nah we have too many flaws we have stuff we need to work on
at this point you keep playing to win get guys reps at injury positions on d fix issues on offense and special teams the goal should be to win out at this point if kc drops a game then i could see resting players against the browns if we have the division locked thats about it too many issues on offense to give guys a break everyone should be playing for there jobs at wr and in the run game

its not doom and gloom yet were still 111 but we should be playing like a team on the outside looking in
im no coach or anything but it seems like defenses has our offense figured out like the short passes were working but now we are lucky to even get 2 first downs on drives i feel like if we go back to ben doing what he does best extending plays the offense can wake up
get pouncey and connor back sit ebrons dumb ass and get mcdonald in there to block not sure where the hell that dudes been but if hes healthy he should be in there and start pounding the shit out of the fucking ball get back to steelers football force 1 on 1s w washington clay pool johnson and juju and take advantage of them
dont play like yesterday
catch the ball
i agree with your points and endorse the sitting of the starters sunday night us steelers fans should call for tomlin to do it
cincy coming up next week

buffalo is coming up next week and its probably going to be bad


bout time call them dudes out
i say we just beat up randy again nothing to do with him i just hope that mf retires next year and thank god for tomlin said something about the drops if they go one game without one drop ill die happy
with who ray ray cant catch a punt mccloud

id like to see the snap counts to compare because highsmith probably has 20 of what the other guys listed have
pff wont disclose their formulas on how it evaluates its players its an industry secret what a joke pff is the biggest scam and worst thing to ever happen to football fans

does a single living breathing person actually care what clownherd thinks
honestly just stop posting cowherd stuff here he loves to rile people up and the only appropriate response to anything this clown says is to respond with a photo of his stupid prediction about baltimore finishing 160 and us at 79 he has zero credibility
who gives a flying fuck power rankings mean literally nothing
well hes a joke who had us going under 500
so ill be that guy i periodically watch cowherd because i appreciate outlandish crazy views for the record before seattle played arizona last week cowherd said that seattle is the fourth best team that could join the top tier of teams he had the steelers in his top tier of teams top 3 in the league

cowherd is the guy you grew up with who broke your balls when the steelers lost and praised them when they won the guy you could never argue with because he had no allegiance to any team but found a way to hate on all teams collectively

when you learn that about him you can start to watch him without having an overall hate for him he takes anything that happens magnifies it by ten and talks about it its for nothing other than ratings

the thing is weve played like absolute shit the past two weeks this isnt the same team from even two weeks ago so adjustments need to be made im not sure id put us as low as 8 but its not crazy that we could have dropped from 12 to 45 the team hasnt played bad theyve played absolutely atrociously we are one dimensional lost a top edge rusher and our one dimensional wrs look like they forgot how to catch we are tied for dead last in the league in ypc and 28th in the league in total rush yards completely abandoning the run like weve been doing 53 passes14 rushes yesterday 51 passes19 rushes last week will lead to heartbreak hotel in decemberjanuary we need to get better running the ball or we arent going anywhere
hes trolling steelers fan and getting the reaction that he wants
i like us as an underdog
sounds like someones a little hurt because his preseason projections were sooooo wrong
nfc is kinda crap this year 9268 chance that an afc team wins the super bowl
this dude is a dweeb
were 3 at lowest
ill rank the browns ahead of the steelers if they beat them
someone please explain to me how teams like the packers who have lost to the vikings colts and bucs the bucs who are 75 and the browns who we have already kicked the living shit out of by 30 are better than us weve struggled the last two weeks because of injuriescovid and shitty play calling but because of that we are suddenly barely top 10 lol sounds legit
lol the rams
the only time i ever see this jackasss face is on our subreddit
this is actually a good thing you never want cowherd on your side
i do mot blame him i do think the packers are overrated but no one cares lmao
dude defo cant get a boner
wow
i like his segments but horrible take also i think the chiefs deserve fourth at best barely winning the last3 games not to mention a loss to the much worse raiders
fk em
after watching the last month and with injuries i think its reasonable to argue we are on the cusp of the top 5 but tb and la being stronger than us and cle is ridiculous

i am concerned that we will start losing consistently or early in the playoffs i think we can win the sb too there are real cracks though
5 6 7 wtf is that we lose one game and all hell breaks lose
i think the saints are a one sided team they have a really good d i think with film people will expose their offense i think green bay is gonna win that conference bucs are over rated but have a good d
thats fine we are better off when you underestimate us
on the one hand the steelers deserve all the shit they get this week for losing to a terrible team like washington especially considering how pathetic their effort was

on the other hand cowherd is super butthurt his prediction of baltimore going undefeated and pittsburgh finishing with a losing record and third in the division keeps getting thrown in his face so he goes out of his way to overhype any criticism of pittsburgh
can we stop giving this racist asshole attention please
we have looked like shit for 2 weeks in a row sooo
ngl outside of the rams being so high and swap cleveland and tampa and that list looks about right to me

because of yall lol
mathematics and stem

claypool has been dropping passes too recently guess he was the casualty for washington to get more playing time imo dj should be losing snaps to washington as well cause claypools drops arent nearly as bad as his
all wrs are dropping passes but only one of them has a direct replacement on the field and thats wash for claypool
well ben openly said washington deserved more play time in the wake of last weeks strugglesso for him to go in someone has to come out

juju isnt going to come out much so either claypool or diontae have to come out for washington to go in on most sets obviously not true on 45 outs but still
steelers always do this with rookies i think its because rookies arent used to so many games being played so fatigue can be a lot worse for them same thing happened with devin bushs snap count last year

everyone has been dropping passes seems like claypool no more than others
too bad ebron was blowing blocks and dropping passes he needs a week on the bench and a lot of time with the jugs machine no excuse for mapletron to not be getting much more play time
in that same time frame he only caught 2 balls lol

i love how the ravens sub is move focused on our season than their own broke covid ridden team
i appreciate all these memes theyre making me feel better
this is actually top tier lmao
i swear on every tweet about pitt theres that one dude with the tampa bay pfp posting that steeler road to copypasta
scoreboard aaron burr

love to see a stat on how many uncalled holds have been against tj this season
holding aka rear naked choke

im not so sure that was illegal hands to the face as his helmet is ripped off from behind
neither do the false starts on tackles responsible for blocking him they never call that shit either
ohhh i needed this thanks dood
i cannot understand why it doesnt draw more flags because its often egregious
ironically tj holding someone was a massive component to our loss granted washington 7 points
it isnt just tj its basically every elit edge rusher in the league
so true yet so painful


lol did you think that if you went into there sub they would be saying awww poor steelers i really feel bad for them and still think they are the best team
thats the 1 team i dont want to see if we have to play in the wild card round hopefully they wont be able to make up a game and get skunked out of the playoffs
them celebrating this is like a yankee fan celebrating that the mets beat the red sox i dont get it
it is funny how theyre willing to make themselves look like fools because of how jealous of our record they are lmao
have you read anything on our sub or did you just deicde to post this randomly lol

i know dj had a td catch yesterday but he also had a few drops any chance we see him playing behind washington on the depth chart

and to be honest they line up 34 wide so often is anyone really being replaced
the second half of that quote is some tomlin gold

i expect guys to make routine plays routinely
hope he puts his money where his mouth is and gets washington more playing time

same buddy same
what a cutie boxer


claypools lack of snaps yesterday was criminal
he had the third most wr snaps so
at least hes still part of team redneck in spikeball with duck
looks like buying that juggs machine and living on a farm over the summer paid off for him hes got the best hands on the team
we have 3 potential probowlers ahead of him though i think hes starting to take dj stonehands snaps now
get ebron off the field
i know he has big handsbut i really hate how he runs with the football
we need to give derek watt more offensive plays we need him for the run game
whats the context of the joke of him being a farm boy i never understood
which wr snaps you wanna take away for him
removed
does anyone just get pissed off at seeing ebrons face after a drop he has the look of oh well just another drop lol while juju on the other hand beat himself up when he dropped the ball just hate how he looks after a drop sometimes and just wondering if anyone else feels the same
reminds me of aroldis chapmans fucking smile every time he gives up a home run with two outs in the 9th
dudes been dropping balls since he entered the league
hes the antihines ward hines makes the catch takes a huge lick gets up with a huge lovable grin ebron drops the ball and grinches out

as a bonus check this out
also missed the block on chase young on 4th and goal on the 1 yard line
i said it already today i miss heath miller if there ever was such a thing as a franchise tight end heath was it
who on our roster do you suggest we replace him with
i had a bad feeling this guy wasnt going to be able to shake the drops he has such a history of this shit idk why we thought we could fix his problem its blatant he takes his eyes off the ball and tries to do stuff before the ball is in his hands he makes hard catches look easy and easy check downs look like theyre the hardest catch in the game
oh heath miller we miss you
droptimus prime has no feelings or hands and brains it seems
i find it funny how you guys throw out all the good ebron has brought because of a few drops something that has effected the entire offense go off though
im grateful to have em hes def not the detroit ebron and im ok with that no one is perfect
i get pissed off seeing ebron off the field i can forgive the drops if he wasnt such an arrogant motherfucker off the field like him talking shit to lebron james because he was praising the browns just stfu man
yeah that pissed me off you dont get to smile when you play like shit ebron mind as well have put on a wft jersey last night it left me feeling like the colts got the best part of the deal
whats the difference they both dropped it who cares about their face after
neither one of them should be dropping balls theyre spending too much time on twitter and tik tok and playing like bums

boy you can sure spin a tale
this takes me back to elementary school
we all know that the drop problem is real with the steelers this year tomlin has specifically addressed the issue by talking about how the guys who cant catch the ball will be replaced with those who can the consensus has been that with this drop issue in mind washington needs more snaps and diontae needs less but facts dont lie and i wanted to share the details according to pro football reference as to how our pass catchers are doing
for the sake of not being too convoluted i didnt include rbs the list is our top 4 receivers and ebron

here is the drop rate for our guys in order

juju 21

claypool 51

ebron 64

johnson 66

washington 71

juju is the clear winner here at 94 targets he only has 2 drops his average depth of target adot is just 57 as his targets are usually crossers screens or comebacksit back in zone type routes that makes it easier to catch the ball but at the same time the 21 drop rate is impressive we trust him in third down and money time but juju deserves more targets in general imo he needs more targets down the field in medium routes and in the red zone

chase has had some drops more as of late but his catch rate is still at 51 with 78 targets he also gets the bulk of the deep throw targets with his average depth per target being 129 far and away the deepest for the team the deeper the routes the more likely drops may occur and thus far it seems like his misses are in combat catch scenarios him having the secondlowest catch rate with the longest depth per target is impressive

ebron came to the steelers with a drop problem however his drop rate is better now than it has ever been with 82 and 96 in the previous two years 64 doesnt look horrible vance mcdonalds drop rate in 2018 was 56 so not really a huge difference there ebrons adot 71 is similar to diontae and so is the drop rate

speaking of diontae johnsons drop rate is the secondworst among the core group at 66 his average depth per target has been 75 his route running is supreme fans know this so ben isnt afraid to throw him deep comebacks or slants he has had drops on wideopen deep balls however for those who see antonio brown in him abs adot was 113 in 2018 and he had a drop rate of 18 the steelers passing game is different than it was in 2018 but johnson has room to grow to catch abtype numbers

although everyone wants to hail mr lobster claws as the guy who should replace all of the butterfingers on the team james washington actually has the worst drop rate at 71 he only has 3 drops but with 42 targets that isnt great his drop rate has risen each year from 53 to 63 to 71 his adot is second longest however at 107 but washington too dropped a deep pass that would have been a td in this season

it may be worth noting that ray ray has 0 drops in 19 targets his catch percentage is also very high but most of his targets are behind the line of scrimmage or very short in fact his average level of depth of target is 12 so its pretty much always screens

another important thing to talk about is the types of players that each receiver is claypool had fewer snaps in the game against wft than normal and that was to get james washington on the field more in replace of him claypool and washington are similar players thus far washington has proven to be the better combat catcher but claypool has more breakout ability they are both bigbodied deep threats who can outmuscle and out position a defender diontae and ray ray are also the same type of player they use elite quickness in their route running and to run after the catch the group as a whole is extremely talented but do we want ray ray to run go routes instead of claypool or washington to run that timingbased comeback route like diontate that gave the steelers a td against wtf i honestly dont think so its hard to take diontae out and expect washington for example to give ben what he needs in that area of the passing game the bummer of this situation is that claypool juju and diontae give the steelers an incredible mix of styles and player types if they could simply catch the football one could perhaps argue that washington could take a few snaps from ebron and claypool just to get him on the field more and prove if that 71 drop rate will lower with more targets it also could be argued that the traditional wr types dont matter if someone is simply a better option over another
meanwhile juju is sort of in his own category for the team he can do it all in many ways and is closer to an anquan bolden or hines ward than anything players who were great and also unique for the position

so there you have it what do you all think its easy to ask for the benching of a guy for the backup but there is likely a reason why that starter is ahead in the depth chart meanwhile mixing it up could be both a wake up to the starters who are in a slump and provide a spark with different players having larger roles the bottom line for me feed juju more
i feel like this is where digging deep into the stats can be detrimental like watching the games and seeing the passes that are dropped by tae and ebron to me they seem to be pretty catchable targets idk it also feels like washington only gets targets when they need a really difficult play to be made so if hes dropped a few i can understand why again i dont know they just all need to catch the ball man lmao
we need juju going deep more often he is probably bens most trusted receiver and he is running screens and crossing routes when we send him deep and they throw to him he always comes down with it
definitely agree feed juju more but i still think they need to use jimmy wash more not a one for one benching but spread out his time with the guys i also think theyre giving claypool some rest mainly because hes a rookie and used to the 12 game season plus a bowl game
this is highly misleading washington has the best hands his drops if you want to call them that have been ridiculous difficulty luckytogetahandontheball passes
johnson and ebron have had more ball drops than a 2 hooker
this is diontes secret reddit account
i just think randy needs to get his shit together
i dont think we need to bench anyone but we need to spread the ball out more imo why is ebron getting so many targets id rather see most of the passes that he gets thrown his way go to juju like every curl he runs this year he gets no yac we cant run the ball so we need to have short easy catches in place of the run game they just shouldnt be going to ebron he should be the fifth option at best and hes being targeted like hes our second
i guess you get so used to seeing wash catch so many contested balls that you forget that he drops some easier ones
as much as we all hate ab that kid was always staying after practice in front of the juggs machine even as a veteran diontae and any other of that style receiver really needs to do the same to become a starting caliber player
i dont think these whole year stats matter right now they have 34 drops on the year with over 13 of them coming in the last two games i dont care how they have looked the whole season i care how they look right now diontae and ebron had 5 between them against the ravens they added to that against washington they are dropping balls right now i dont care what they did in games 110
i 100 agree we need to feed juju the ball on plays besides screens and quick routes if we threw him the ball all game instead of only in the fourth quarter hed have 425 yards and 7 touchdowns every game i know its an exaggeration just deal with it
how many of these drops came in the last 2 games
if you discern from watching the games that washington is the problem with drop passes then you dont watch the game dionte and ebron have a problem it is so easy to see

it feels like washington has a game with a big play and we phase him out of the offense for 4 weeks
washington had some of the most exciting plays for us last year dude should get more playing time
never thought about it but james is better than their 1 wr thats kinda crazy
that stiff arm really wasnt filthy though lol

28 days later
the only logical endgame of this meme i look forward to getting back to regularly scheduled tomlinposting next week
encroachmental agony
tomlin needs to get checked out for liver failure based off of this meme lol
he should have been fired after tim tebow beat us in the playoffs

this is a misread of the scene this would imply that we think about the browns but pretend not to so maybe in a roundabout way its true to the scene


do i think they can beat all those teams yes have they proved to be a top 5 team this past month no shot
bro hes a troll he ranked us 4 in the division at 79 to start the season lol
honestly this isnt too far off from where i see them i would put them at 6 ahead of cleveland and la

the way they are currently playing they no way deserve to be talked about in the top 5
every one of those teams would have beat the steelers squad that showed up for the last two games
total yardsyards per game 21st

total passing yards 13th

passing yards per game 14th

total rushing yardsrushing yards per game 29th

a mediocre at best offense with a stellar defense being the 8th best team is pretty good considering all of that
going off how weve played the last two games id say we are 5th or worst if this was a matter of potential then id have more of a disagreement
edit as he probably is ranking by potential i do disagree with this chart shouldnt judge a whole season on two mediocre games
good i hope the team is taking notes
we arent top 5 until we can run the damn ball consistently
our defense is hurt and our offense is horribly one dimensional in that ben can only accurately throw short and we cant get a yard on 5 plays where would you rank us
whats the issue steelers have the worst offense of all of those teams and the defense is banged up and getting run on

idk how anyone can watch the steelers play the last month and say theyre an elite team
chiefs saints and bills definitely eh on the rams and packers certainly not bucs and browns
their job is to stir the pot and have different takes for the most part what they put out isnt entertainment if theyre just going off of general consensus or logic it holds no merit nor validity its just to stir the pot and nothing else
i prefer it this way the steelers do better as the underdog but everyone knows this is biased as fuck
the question really is can the offense put 24 or more up on these teams i think our d can hold most not kc though to 24 or fewer

sadly watching over the last month i dont think so a decent defense will shut our offense off bens accuracy on deep throws is sporadic our run game isnt able to produce since defenses dont prioritize covering the deeper routes well and our line has some difficulty run blocking and the number of timesthe routes run arent deep enough to get enough yards is alarming

so yeah we might be 7 or 8
im cool with the media not liking us if we were universally accepted as the best team in the league had a perfect record no flaws on our team and cruised through the rest of the season id be absolutely terrified of getting soft and then being showed up by some wild card team with a derpy qb in the super bowl

sports is all about overcoming adversity and proving doubters wrong now these guys have something to prove
the line cant block for any of our running backs

our running backs cant make any plays or break any tackles they go down on first contact

fichtner didnt fail to extend the ball on the one yard line when snell jumped up and held the ball under his arm failing to get into the endzone

our offense gets turned into a passonly offense

run the ball when you only need one yard on 3rd and 1

so what about the 5 failed attempts at the one yard line

but why throw a pass to a running back

the pass before was a quick one to juju and broken up they were 50 passes into the game have to do something they havent seen hell it almost worked

why throw a pass to an ol

kansas city did the same thing are they bad now too

oh and

when over 10 of the ontarget passes are dropped what the f do you expect to happen

fichtner is being scapegoated like all hell haley was a fucking moron fichtner called a fine game the players failed to execute want a coach to yell at why not the receiver coach or the ol coach
the problem is hes predictable as fuck he is the definition of insanity doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result i understand our ol and rbs arent that good but he has done no favors to his team and for the record he cant develop talent worth a damn either
hes absolutely part of the problem

you cant watch other nfl teams play and think to yourself wow the steelers offense is actually coached well theres no excuse for this offense to not score 30 a game
run the ball when you only need one yard on 3rd and 1

so what about the 5 failed attempts at the one yard line

thats part of the problem why have those other 5 attempts failed is part of it the oline sure but when the steelers announce that they are running and how they are running because they line up in the same formation theyve run out of the whole game the defense is gonna be ready

one time one of our rbs got about 9 yards on a delayed handoff do you know how many times after that i saw them run that play not once meanwhile a single back formation run up the middle thats like 90 of pittsburghs running plays and they almost always go for nominimal gain is fichtner the only problem no is his play calling a significant problem though absolutely
111 was a pipe dream until this season ive watched steelers teams lose 35 of this same game every season for quite a while now im glad we are in the hunt this year with some destiny control

could do with a few fewer injuries though
fichtner has to know our oline isnt winning the line of scrimmage consistently they can pass block sure but they dont open holes or drive the opposition back like they did when bell was in the backfield its up to the oc to make adjustments like say

mix derek watt in hes played under 40 snaps all season its time

involve the tight ends in the blocking scheme

get our rbs into one on one situations and give them a chance to make somebody miss connor has been excellent in space

disguise the run play action ect

the running game as a whole is struggling but the backs themselves are talented enough
youre right that fichtner is the scapegoat here will probably get downvoted for this but if youre going to say randy is part of the problem then ben is also part of the problem you cant say one is a problem while the other isnt they both go hand in hand and ben has a huge say in what randy does thats the only reason randy became oc in the first place
there was a chart showing run blocking and yards by running back and conner was far and away working behind one of the worst lines and performing at above league average despite this fact reddit search sucks so if someone else has it saved feel free to post it rb isnt the issue the oline is and to a degree the play calling they need to be doing a better job of disguising the run plays to give them a better chance of success since they arent going to be doing any blocking for it apparently
youre basically suggesting that unless we have elite talent in absolutely every aspect of the offense its not the ocs fault

thats not the case no offense is perfect a good oc uses the offenses strength and hidesworks around its weaknesses thats the job

is fitchner the problem no obviously not is fitchner part of the problem yes is fitchner doing anything to make the offense function better it sure doesnt seem like it

i think the steelers utter failure on openings drives under fitchner is a great example of this imagine you have all week to write a script for one drive that maximizes on your talents and takes advantage of what youve seen on your opponents tape and you fail every single time
very few fans have any business holding opinions beyond when they ought to set down their beers and shake their pom poms

listening to them criticize nfl gameplans is a real hoot for those of us with a background in the game
steelers are gonna lose their first playoff game either way so

28 was the greatest number on monday glad hes back
i cant believe nobody has gotten the answer 214 yet smh

this was after a different game was literally posted weeks ago they didnt do this after last night stupid
i dont think thats after this game but they having fun but ur right they are receivers the first thing you should learn when playing wr is to catch
i see less dj and more washington on sunday
nfl players cant have fun if they lose even one game
this isnt either of their accounts
oh calm down football players are human get a life

anyone else almost die of a seizure when he was on the ground
now if only our offense could get going
i know tj rightfully gets all the dpoy attention but minkah is really the piece that made this whole defensive click and hes like the perfect player always in the right position never takes a bad angle him getting the wind knocked out of him last night was the first time ive ever seen him get dinged up
and when he went down last night we all collectively shit our pants
well heres an idea play him at wide receiver as well
we need to stop with the shotgun runs and try some power runs singleback sets our defense is constantly winning these games for us while our offense goes stagnant for like 7 straight drives we used to be a 30 point offense in the first 7 games but now we just suck on offense randy gotta just use different sets in the run game cause that shotgun draw shit obviously isnt working
thats an impressive stat didnt knew this
the real fitzmagic
this is the wholesome shit i like to see
thats crazy good
well thats freakin impressive
wow
and zero playoff wins

i see plenty of those posts here when another rival team loses so potkettle and all that
what you want them to say oh the steelers really tried their best that game i think theyre still really good no dont post shit from their subreddit it make it look like theyre in your head
we do the same thing when they lose
about to start a justin tucker missed a kick upvote party
colin cowherd wants a word with you
im not worried it only took 11 ws to get to this one l
lol like there wont be one of these here if they get beat by the cowturds
yeah but theyve only been able to post that once this year
the little brother is always jealous of the big dog in the kennel
like they gonna make the playoffs
so the ravens are still gonna play against the cowboys after dez just tested positive today he was on the field warming up they dont have to reschedule
this game should be canceled and forfeited the ravens have had every chance
im watching the game and the pregame guys were all looking at jay glazer like so he had to have practiced with others how is this not a concern
if roger goodell was smart no there would not be a game tonight but we all know about his love affair with money so itll go on
that organization and their fans are the biggest dumbasses i think ive ever witnessed glad we swept em out of afc north contention
so irresponsible from baltimore they knew his test was inconclusive and still let him in the stadium today what do i know though
theyre caring about other people went in a dumpster with a certain white suit
no because somehow it will affect us
are we seriously still whining shit happens move on
i think this just proves how much baloney the rona really is now its mutated its become more infectious but less deadly now if you have immune deficiencies or a preexisting illnessdisease or youre elderly sure its still a threat but to the average person and especially nfl athletes this isnt a life or death situation like its made out to be the numbers of deaths have been inflated by hospitals because they get a bail out from it george floyd for instance is considered a covid death when we all know he didnt die from rona

on top of that i personally know people who work in elderly homes with people that have tested positive for covid19 they never tested positive themselves but they got sick when this first happened they are 99999 sure they had it but were exempt so they could continue working since they were essential they havent been sick since theyve built up an immunity

weve seen athletes like cam newton miraculously test positive and report no symptoms or illness at all now dez gets pulled in the middle of warm ups and tests positive with no symptoms or illness either seems a bit funny to me im not saying this is the case with everyone who has tested positive but i think a lot of them are part of a game the nfl is playing to manufacture drama some of these people definitely arent covid positive so why are they testing positive and only being held out one week most of the time if they tested positive on multiple tests theres no way one week of quarantine is enough to clear them of being infectious

covid had become a tool of fear for politicians and media and a tool of manipulation for the nfl apparently you can tell me im wrong but it doesnt add up

if this team plays like the last 2 weeks we will get fucked by the bills
lol were not fine no run game all the drops and the predictable passes wont win us a super bowl
aw poor jets
but this doesnt allow me to be a reactionary and give in to my anxiety about my team
play like this against bills and were fucked
weve averaged 145 points on offense the past 2 games against any team in the playoffs thats a first round exit this offense needs to get back going now
id rather be wheee green bay and kc are our offense is garbage
by no means does this mean were perfect but we need to stop treating ourselves like were 57 right now and block out everyone elses perceptions of us


sure the drops have been an issue however im more concerned with the fact that defenses are now keying on the short passing game and ben is not placing the balls in the spots to let wrs make defenders miss
it really seems like the steelers have been scraping by for a long time i dont feel that our record reflects our ability no run game at all ben has to throw the ball 60 times a game players being cocky on twitter tomlin really seems like the only guy thats aware of this and im thankful for that much

that being said the defense is playing lights out but now that the injuries are piling up it is really time to buckle down and stop scraping by

im glad the steelers lost because this is exactly the kick in the ass they needed losing your undefeated record to the nfc east is going to light a fire under these boys i hope
im glad it was wft because it doesnt affect the 1 seed if both kc and the steelers win out if both teams are 151 we own the tiebreaker
i am not because it wasnt just an anomaly they are a tired football team with major injuries at key positions and have a huge flaw that any team can exploitno fear of the running game

maybe pouncey and connor coming back will helpgod i hope
we all hope that the lost will inspire better play from the team so many examples of missed opportunities but it happens we just couldnt get a string of 5050 plays last night that we have been getting all season and to your point the players needed a loss like this feeling like they should have won the game but lost it because of their lack of execution and i agree with you about your point about tomlin he knows his guys were feeling themselves a little too much
i wouldnt go as far as say that im glad but im glad that if we were to lose this season it would be to a nfc team also im curious how this helps ease the pressure as im sure being undefeated adds pressure will be nice for the team to finally have some rest and get back to normal scheduling
fucking traitor

ngl if we beat an 110 team i would be excited too
there are a lot more teams between buffalo and washington
accurate assessment

edit the only issue i have is that i fear that the steelers dont deserve the top of the pedestal in fact i am deeply concerned about them losing two in a row to a very hot buffalo bills
i think id put the chiefs and steelers on an equal pedestal now
they should be esctatc to be in 8th place that team with that defense can go places just like the current steelers
lol when you have nothing else to root for this one felt good for us always had a soft spot for the steelers good luck on the rest of the season
i feel like people dont realize that its how well youre playing that matters not your record
still shouldnt have happened just saying
this would be better if in the fourth panel he did not have the team emblem and the reveal was only in the last panel
wft fans have every right to be excited by that win they played better than the best team in the afc
patriots or wft whos better
lmao so true
shouldnt kc be on top they at least lost to a somewhat of a playoff contending team
im trying to figure out how to watch the tnf in hdr but cant seem to do it is it still possible i have a 2019 shield pro with the fox sports app ethernet connected it does say 4k but not hdr my tv is a vizio which doesnt have the fox sports app so i cant try that
i believe you need either a compatible cable set top box firetv or roku device for hdr

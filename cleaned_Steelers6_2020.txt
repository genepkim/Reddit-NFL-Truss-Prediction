bellichick later get the cameras boys we cant let this happen again
man i miss when getting onto the 5 yard line was basically a touchdown just ride the bus in
also this reminds me of jordan in that last dance doc brady and i took that personally
brings a tear to my eye damn i miss that team
kicked the snot out the eagles on that next game too
removed
i gotta see my college qb go toe to toe with brady

but the ravens browns and bengals all won and i didnt get to watch a steelers game on top of that

but were still first in the afcn so its all good
the browns are lookin pretty feisty finally burrow showed he belongs and the ravens are the ravens if the steelers win the division theyll be the most battle tested team in the playoffs i like that
id like to say that we always play down to the level of our opponent it turns out our opponent has always been us

this is a joke
still undefeated
still first place in the division

time to handle business with eastern pennsylvania and protect the throne
fire mike tomlin

big ben needs to retire

devin bush is a bust

juju needs to stay off social media
that was one hell of a game i still cant believe we got out of this as the division leaders
the steelers are about to play another soft offensive line

most sacks allowed

1 texans 16
2 bengals 15
3 giants 14
3 eagles 14
5 broncos 13
5 jaguars 13
5 49ers 13
5 washington 13


we still get to play the jaguars bengals x2 washington and eagles who are all bottom 5 teams in sacks allowed

we currently rank 2nd in sacks and unlike the 1st place eagles we have only played 3 games

we currently rank 2nd in ydsg and 4th in ptsg on defense

eagles currently rank 28th in ydsg and 26th in ptsg on offense

steelers sack totals this season

1 giants 3
2 broncos 7
3 texans 5

view poll
my mind is telling me 4 but my body is telling me 10
im just trying to imagine what infinity sacks would look like like would tj just hold carson on the ground for 60 minutes
6
jesus the steelers are 713 broncos sacksthats bananas
the idea in rnfl that weve only gotten sacks cause were facing bad o lines is sooo dumb were also getting pressure at historic levels even for a pass rush that has been the best for the past few years also part of the reason theyve sucked is because theyve played us

anyways last year we demolished some of the best o lines like the colts and ravens so that should be more proof that this is just a monstrous pass rush
anyone else worried about sleeping on the eagles
none

the eagles will have positive covid tests and the game will be cancelled because the nfl wont make a forfeit happen for some reason and the season will not be extended
going to drop that 10 spot
more than in week 4
more than or equal to the number from week 4
i will predict 4 one from each of watt dupree williams hilton
wentz is somewhat hard to bring down good at throwing the ball away last second 0 2 in fact id be surprised if we dont go more coverage this week to stop the check downs tes their receivers kinda suck
ill say 5

jones escaped just barely in week 1 to keep the totals low we feasted on the broncos and surprisingly on the texans even with watson being elusive

unless wentz runs for his life its going to be a long day for him honestly 5 is on the low end but this week off might have us come out a little slow to start
70 thousand

as all steelers fans know as soon as a backup qb subs in for another team they start lighting our defense upex hoyer with colts driskel with broncos
could this maybe be because tomlin and butler gameplan well against the starting qb so when the backup comes in we arent prepared for them or do you think it is something else
could this maybe be because tomlin and butler gameplan well against the starting qb so when the backup comes in we arent prepared for them

yes all teams have this its a well known thing you cant game plan for someone who you have no tape on etc

beyond that the opposing team completely changes their offense in most cases since the backup cant run the starter caliber offense and has different strengths and weaknesses and you arent prepared for that either
game planning plays a huge role i also think that backups tend to go into it with a nothing to lose mindset and make some unexpected big plays after a few weeks youll typically start to see why they dont start ie duck and rudolph last year
yeah its how mason rudolph almost beat the seahawks last season and duck came in and wouldve likely beat the ravens in week 5 if not for the juju fumble what matters is we won against both of those qbs tho
this is not a steelers phenomenon it is a league wide phenomenon the game planning is the biggest factor as others have said even similar qbs will have different types of plays theyre good at or different defensive looks theyre good at identifying then imagine going from a pocket qb to a guy who can run a bit much easier for the offense to adjust than the defense

but also the tropes of bringing in a backup qb midgame to inject some life into the offense have some truth to them imagine being a backup qb and getting your name called in the 3rd quarter youre thinking this is the moment ive been waiting for for weeksmonthsyears and your adrenaline is going to spike that energy is going to translate to the offense

we saw this happen last year when ben went down rudolph led a couple scoring drives against the seahawks when rudolph went down duck led a scoring drive against the ravens when we benched duck rudolph led a scoring drive against the jets last night the pats benched hoyer and stidham led a scoring drive vs the chiefs last week the bears benched trubisky and went on a tear to win the game only for foles to fall on his face when he played a team that got to gameplan for him

thanks titans good luck week 7 cause youre all gonna fucking need it
tomlin has disciplined this team very well
bud dupree talking via zoom said right now all he does is go to practice go home and sometimes to the grocery store in an effort to stay safe and keep his teammates safe

im gonna miss him next year he seems like a genuinely awesome guy hope he makes a stupid amount of money on an nfc team
i cant wait to body these titans week 7 ruined our mid season bye
well titans players in response are going out on the town kissing everyone and everything and because its tennessee theyre probably licking every door knob they can find too
bud trying everything he can to make me root for him and tj to be this generations lloyd and greene
occasionally laid up at yo girls house whatcha gonna do
is this not what everyone is doing

goes down to massachusetts

fucking circuschurches parks every walking path and sidewalk restaurants full to the brim i dont even like driving with my window down


why am i not surprised mr gregarious newton got the rona


edit point is there are so many people socializing or lolly gagging in popular cities you cant even drive your car and be properly distanced because everyone stopped caring



good stuff
this is really cool

removed

a bit disappointed by the box design would think they could come up with something better it doesnt make me want to eat the contents inside whatsoever with juju thrusting his nuts in my face

honestly considering they beat our two archrivals in the playoffs last year id say it evens out
lmfao
alright cmon guys it was funny ragging on them a bit but its not like they woke up one morning and went imma go get the covid

edit i missed that the nfl has ruled it a protocol violation carry on
festytits
im confused to why the patriots still played
it doesnt help that everyone in our division won on sunday either
titans fan incoming i know it feels that way to all but no team wins when there is no football to be played im just kicking my feet on the swing waiting to titan the fuck up on my week 4 bye not cool man lol
having no football to look forward to while the rest of the nfl was frolicking was tough but now were finally back and ready to make carson wentz miserable on sunday with the browns game the week after this is another lower tier team that we need to clean up because the afcn isnt slowing down either unfortunately
hopefully thats the positive now steelers football every week till the run to the superbowl
i have to imagine our d line can barely contain their excitement at the threadbare patchwork quilt that is the philly o line
with how bad the philly oline is we should beat the breaks off of wentz
the browns are making some plays and its their super bowl when they play the steelers i loved seeing the browns beat the cokeboys id like to see the browns become more competitive and let the bungles be the doormat of the division forevermore

eagles are usually a pain in the butt for the steelers i cant explain it
its going to be advantageous i imagine to have a week to see how the browns offense functions with the absence of chub not saying dernest johnson wont be a problem as he chuncked the cowboys pretty good on sunday but id much rather go against him than the chunt combo hoping to also see this secondary come together and create good communication this week we will need it after seeing objs performance on sunday im not looking past this eagles team thats riding a pretty great high from the 49irs im just hoping this steelers team can clean up holes theyve had in previous weeks and showcase it
when you consider that this team starts slow in september usuallyid be a bit worried if i was the rest of the league you cant sleep on the steelers or you get what the steelers used to do against weaker opponents

i hope the rest hasnt made them rusty at all cant come out in the 1st quarter asleep
i am horrified of this week this game stinks of a trap game
we need to start hot so it forces wentz to drop back then we can torture him


completely remove their run game
please use this thread to post any info you wanted to share about this weeks opponent including weaknesses strengths or info on lesserknown players you think will have an impact

if you are a fan of the opposing team feel free to add in your two cents about the same topics above andor ask us about the steelers
last week felt so long after we didnt have a game feels good to be back and ive been waiting on this thread
i think this is going to be the game that proves to me that we are no longer the steelers of the past 5 years i think in the past this is a game the steelers dont show up for and lose against a middling to poor nfc opponent i was looking forward for the test playing against a good team like the titans but i really want to see us win this game handily on sunday our defense is the best in the league but i want to see our offense take the next step so bad but as ive said to my friends i think if we score 2528 points per game this season we go like at least 133 so the offense doesnt have to be spectacular
this could be a potential super bowl preview
how has your offensive line been the eagles biggest strength so far has been their front four and more specifically their ability to rotate quality players with fresh legs in at the end of games i believe we lead the league in sacks albeit 13 of those sacks coming against the bengals and the 9ers
removed
i think the most interesting matchup is going to be in the trenches we both have solid dlines but and correct me if im wrong the steelers oline doesnt seem as solid as the eagles
hey steeler country eagles fan here looking forward to a hard hitting competitive game definitely gonna see lots of good defense and who the hell am i kidding were gonna get smoked
tj watt is going to win dpow after this game the tackle is going to be a turnstile
i am ready to feast on the eagles o line i think this should be a solid win if they start on the right foot
our d lines have the most eagles and 2nd most steelers qb hits bless the knees carson and ben gonna get hit
is chase claypool ready to break out going up against either maddox small or mills slow this may be a game where he plays a big role and puts up big numbers juju should get mostly erased by slay but beyond that you guys should do fine our linebackers are horrific our dline is pretty damn good and safeties are
offense lets just say ill be starting the steelers d in fantasy this week
i actually think this may be a close game i can see the eagles being very hungry after a confidence booster in beating the 49ers the steelers are going to be well rested but who knows if they play down to their opponents yet again we shall see in any case looking forward to another edition of the battle of pa
why is this thread in contest mode again makes this way less functional
how are your tes the eagles lb core is not very strong and tes are very powerful against teams with no lbs especially those tes who are big as they can match up easily with corners
how are the steelers going to handle upcoming tickets comparing this to what the eagles do anyone get any info as a ticketholder


i cant imagine want to pay thousands to watch a bad eagles team lose in a mostly empty stadium but i am curious how both our cities and teams will handle this inside pa guidelines
what weaknesses either offensively or defensively do you feel the eagles should try to exploit

for the steelers offensively i would test those eagles lbs all damn day

defensively bring the heat on carson our ol has been playing better than expected considering all the injuries but they are young and inexperienced
you guys are probably getting 10 sacks im starting your d in fantasy lol
where do yall think the eagles can exploit the steelers

i fear that botched call was the symbolic passing of the torch from one nfl evil empire to the next
jesse james caught that ball btw
i just wanted to remind everyone in light of these trying times we are living in that jesse james caught that football thank you for your time
the best part was watching pats fans meltdown about how mahomes is the nfls golden boy and that he gets so many calls its unfair yet they just spend the last almost two decades being the benefactor of having the golden boy
watching patriots fans meltdown in the game thread was quite delicious
i mean i can feel them that was a shit call that changed the entire game we should expect better from the refs and from the nhl that being said i feel absolutely no sympathy for the fans of the team that told us all but thats the rule jesse litterally caught that ball facing the throw and was able to take a step turn it up field and stretch it upfield they changed the stupid fucking rule because of it it changed the entire outlook of the playoffs yet we were called crybabies and told to deal with it fuck them and their childish fucking fanbase couldnt have happened to a better team
i wish them decades of misery
fans of literally every other team in the nfl watching the game last night
memba when a forward progress negated a turnover for the steelers i memba

he was from pittsburgh and wanted to play here alot of people wanted him in the team i rember he went on rich eisien shiw and he said they never contacted him lol he wanted to play he would live at his moms and wasnt too far from staduim he said he wrote to teams that didnt cintact asking then why lol was it because we had heyward etcm and didnt need him even though he was a pittsburgh kid or they didnt see anything in himyou think steelers would be interested in him since we love michigan players and he was a michag player and kid was from from pittsburgh and wanted to play for steelers
im sure we would have taken him with our second 3rd rounder in 2019 if he was still available it wasnt an area of need really but weve usually gone bpa through drafts however if you remember 2019 was the year we traded our 1st and 2nd round picks to move up and select devin bush so we didnt have a pick until the 3rd which we used to draft an impact wr and replace mbc

also a lot of draft analysts had winovich going at the end of the 1st round so the industry was obviously a lot higher on him than nfl scouts
i dont know that they werent interested in him but when they traded up for devin bush it kind of took winovich off the table there were plenty of rumors that the steelers liked him although that may have been smoke screens to cover for their interest in bush

the steelers had a lot of needs going into that year that were ahead of edge ilb cb safety xreceiver etc and the only chance they had to take winovich was at the johnson slot if he had fallen a half dozen picks more to the spot where they took layne that would have been interesting
hes a bit of a tool anyway


the being forced to take your lunch break 20 minutes after clocking in is a great analogy for the week 4 bye having said that tomlin doesnt care hes like the honey badger
one of the best pittsburgh dads in recent memory worth the watch
holy shit i remember when the simpsons moved to thursday

removed
if the steelers allow it i assume those 7500 seats will be offered to longtime season ticket holders
heinz

meanwhile green bay just put a hold on holding fans lol
hot my email this morning ill be putting in for both games
if there are any season ticket holders willing to sell their tickets its always been a dream of mine to take my dad an eagles fan to a game
fans are allowed back

due to how little seats we have its basically going to season ticket holders so the rest of you can stay at home

lol
crazy times man
why even bother
talk about luxury

i know i figured if you put all three watts on the field they turn into exodiwatt and become that custom madden player you made when you were a kid who was 7 feet tall with all 99 stats
exactly what i thought when i heard the news
i thought that was steeler fans realizing we couldnt put jjs contract on the roster even if they left him in a basket on our doorstep along with a note begging us to give him a good home
wattwattwatt coming for your qbs buttbuttbutt

edit shit didnt think this through derek will change his name to dj when he puts on 200lb moves to nose tackle
sorry to sound stupid but why
jj wants to win though if texans cant turn it around he may want to leave and what better place to go than a team who has a top 5 defense want to say 1 but idk about all around stat wise a decent offense and his 2 brothers theres still hope but it would be when his contract is up or unless the new coach wants to dump the old guys to clear some cap or get some picks
jj is past his prime and only plays about half the year hurt all the time why steelers fans want him is beyond me
hansen brothers
achievement collected maximum wattage
jj has declined drastically whens even the last full season hes played or close to full season

wouldnt even want him at least not for what he makes vet min come on down can play second to hayward otherwise hard pass
dont need him especially with signing cam
idk why steelers fans are so hot on jj watt hes a de in a 34 defense which puts the onus of of sealing the edge and edge rushing on the de we run a 43 though our des are inside rushers and run stoppers even if he somehow did become fast enough to play olb who are you gonna replace him with tj and bud have been playing gang busters
jj has missed 32 games over the last 4 seasons

much like conner both are great guys but we need players healthy and on the field especially during bens last few years under center

to me the cool factor of a 7th lombardi outweighs that of watt x 3

wow tj on one side and jj on the other would make nearly every qb in the league shart before every snap
removed

5500 fans

maybe the early bye was a blessing in disguise get diontae healthy and get allen more ready to take defensive snaps
i cant freaking wait to see diontaes breakout game

its coming
for a fraction of a second i saw tomlin talking about the availability of watt and my mind went to tj and covid and my heart went to omg omg omg

what do you mean out of a concussion dr nigerian will smith

wheeee lets break up the undefeated team
we need to figure out who we would replace him with before we talk about trading not to mention we will also be looking for replacements for bud and alualu this off season too
nothing bc the steelers wouldnt mess with a defense like this that would be stupid
lol hes due 9 million salary next two years his cap hits 15 but thats due to dead money from restructuring so we would barely save any money while trading away a stud
lol this scumbag is karma hunting check his post history

i love wearing my pens jersey around philly just to piss everyone off but i really hope we win this week had amazing seats the last time we played in philly surrounded by eagles season ticket holders and getting blown out like we did was so frustrating would really like the boys to return the favor knock them down to 131 so i can just smirk at everyone in the office on monday
in the same boat though ive never had anyone give me shit for wearing steelers stuff its the penguins stuff thats dangerous
bad things happen in philadelphia
i used to live in manayunk across from pitchers pub we would hang a giant banner of the opposing team that was playing the eagles each week just to piss off eagles fans theyre stupid
i would normally think the same but the eagles are horrible and so are their fans the fans have given up already
bro i live in baltimore i feel you
me being in philadelphia this week


ftfy
id start the drive to pittsburgh early if i were you eagles fans are not people to mess with when theyre angry and drunk
miss those gameday gatherings that used to be held weekly at the plymouth meeting dave busters typically got over a hundred steelers fans in a rented out ballroom with tons of projectors of the game and all the food and beer you could want those were the days
on the incline
ive got my giant steelers flag flying in delaware countyand several nest security cameras
i taught my kids early to hate philadelphia because their fans throw snowballs at santa
philly is one of the dirtiest cities on earth

steagles much respect to your uncle ill raise my towel in his honor
im so sorry for your loss thanks for stopping by to share your story

im from philly and currently live several miles outside of it growing up i lived with just my mom who is from pittsburgh and i quickly became a steelers fan my husband is an eagles fan as are all of my inlaws and my dads side of the family ive become very good at cheering the eagles on while secretly hoping they lose spectacularly

ive tried so many times over the years to like the eagles but i justreally dont like them ive been to one eagles game and caught the worst cold of my life soon afterwards it aint meant to be
i smell some love for us actually hehe enjoy the match and i will drink some wine im italian lol in your uncle honor my friend
ordered some eastern pa beer for the game i shall toast him on game day

and wish carson a speedy recovery on monday
played renegade on 11 for a the fallen brother
may his ic light stay cold and pirogis always warm
my dads side of his family are all huge eagles fans i was worried that my grandpa wouldnt live long enough to see them win it all when they played the pats in the super bowl i traveled across the state on super bowl sunday to watch the game with him one of the best football watching experience of my life thank god for nick foles
sorry for your loss man sounds very sad but im glad you areatleast seem to be doing better cheers to your uncle and cheers to a good injury free game
its a shame steelers and eagles arent in the same division im a little sick of playing teams that dont matter like cinci and cleveland playing philly 2x a year would be far more interesting

though we will certainly take the 34 free wins a year playing ohio teams
dont worry well win this one for him
good luck guys drink a beer for my uncle steelers faithful

there will be beers drank in your uncles name i hope we get a w for him to
sorry man thanks for sharing the memory

im happy to shit talk your stinking garbage nfc east bullshit team in his place if you want go throw a battery at santa you filth wuter
thank yall for all the love

also sorry to my women steelers fans just realized how shitty it is i said gentlemen only yall have been too kind ill have to post a picture of the man when i find a good one of his tattoos
gentlemen
what do you think about trey lance do you think he can be the hier to big ben

he still needs to develop as a passer but can sit behind ben for a year him and matt canada as oc could be the future
would be nice but i doubt well be able to get him with the 32nd pick
trey lance is going to be one of the top qbs in the 2021 draft and is expected to go about in the top 10 so i wouldnt get my hopes up if i were you
oh snap we are starting with the should we could we can wes extra early this season lmao
when was the last time a qb drafted as a sophomore did anything at the nfl level and does he even fit the steelers offensive system ill pass
this draft will likely be more unpredictable than the one that just happened

all i can say for sure is that i would like a trevor lawrence justin fields or trey lance i cannot say we can realistically expect anything

not to mention that teams either have qbs at the end of their career brees matt ryan brady rivers big ben etc qbs that are good but not great minshew bridgewater goff carr tannenhill cousins etc or their organization is likely to look for a change to see if something sticks darnold whoever denvers qb is trubisky foles jones haskins etc

i can see more than half the league having a reason to take a qb this coming draft some less plausible than others but still a nonzero chance

tldr i doubt we even get a chance to
is there literally anyone in the world you people dont think this team should be pursuing youre like my kids at the grocery store

fine ill bite what do you know about him that i cant learn from looking at his stat sheet
would love to get him but cant see him falling that far
sure lets begin tanking s
stop it ben will be our qb until the wheels fall offand most likely we will have to suffer a year or three of shitty records in order to find the next steelers qb

and as far as i am concernedwhich amounts to a thimble full of spit ben has earned that designation
honestly i hope we can snag darnold for a 2nd or something when jets take tlaw
id love the pick but godwilling hes going to be long gone before the steelers get to the podium
finna need 31 teams to sleep on him before we can pick him
finna need 31 teams to sleep on him before we can pick him
hes likely going to be a top 5 pick with some experts saying he will challenge lawrence as qb1 in the draft theres no way he falls to us so it really isnt even worth discussing
i could see pittsburgh taking him but it would need more than likely a devin bush draft pick move

my high ass thought that when he said whos your favorite bud i was thinking they were talking about weed
shout out to god
bud is actually a really funny guy so i was surprised to see that hes a terrible on screen personalityinterviewer

this definitely makes me miss abs what it is segment though it was always hilarious
bud dupree might be the worst interviewer ive ever heard hell get halfway through a question then change it

having said that i did watch this entire video

why do you expect that shithole company to know what theyre doing
chase looks like a jersey shore version of himself
whered my mans eyebrows go
that looks more like mahomes
only madden player i like is trace mcsorely
screencapped from his latest youtube video



hes a pretty funny dude
ahh chase claypool often confused with renowned nfl star hingle mccringleberry
switch him to te its dope
diontae johnson is also poorly done in this game sigh
ea with the pam meme response its the same picture
all rookies and c and below players look awful most superstars look amazing and then notable players usually too unfortunately some stats are left out just looking like rando models but they took their time with many studs that game is scary with how good players look devin bush minkah conner look amazing and decastro watt tuit cam pouncy juju enron haden bince snell terrell ben all look good with scans for sure
other players that look spot on around the league are shaquem griffen david njoke levante david mahomes kahlil mack amari cooper tua i traded for him in madden franchise once ben retired lol etc etc

ea scans faces once they do the player usually looks darn near perfect
diontae and chase for example either never got scanned or go need to rescan because the other wr and rb like snell conner and juju look nice
this is bad but its honestly not as bad as ive seen others im expecting them to be able to support at least face scans off their roster photos with the ps5xbox series s but who knows they put in close to zero effort with things like this
yeah this is hingle mccringleberry not mapletron change my mind lol

its like that pic of the kid with veins popping out of his forehead and when you havent badmouthed the steelers in 5 min

its not even the anniversary of it or anything just a total shit on steelers post
honestly people on this sub blinded by bias on this one i think this isnt blatant either way but i think for sure it was intentional
1 he was already standing there so the notion that he ran over to disrupt the play is not true

2 he also could have definitely got out of the way much quicker whether it was just a brain fart or something else is up for debate

3 whether it was intentional or not really doesnt matter it should have been a 15 yard penalty either way but the fact that people were calling for any supplemental discipline was extreme
so this is the first time ive seen a thread pop up on rnfl about it and people are still like furious about this even a couple steelers fans chimed in to say that mike did this on purpose

im not sure how anyone could look at that in real time and assume it was anything other than an accident is it common opinion that tomlin did this on purpose people really think tomlin thought oh fuck yeah im gonna trip him

im always open to changing my opinion and i just dont see any part of this that wasnt just a stupid mistake
people still think tomlin did this on purpose jesus christ its more believable that jacoby fumbled every ball as a steeler on purpose because he was still pissed at that incident if youre a steelers fan and really think this was incidental stop youre making us look like idiots
i was not a fan of the steelers at that time i always saw it as intentional i can see either side now really
i cant believe how many people think it wasnt intentional
this sub may as well just be a pro tomlinsteelers propaganda outlet its just embarrassing at this point

he literally smiled after he did it
how is it not intentional i dont even think he ever denied it being on purpose silence is basically an admittance of guilt

thats a great one to have
and its a beaut clark
just wanted to add some additional details its the platinum retired player legacy jersey
did jerome ever wear block numbers
a lucky man and an awesome jersey wear it with pride
the bus is a great jersey your wife is a keeper
da bus
badass the old block numbers and everything keeper
couldnt have done better
nice one back in like 97 or 98 i had a chance to buy a bettis jersey or a kordell stewart jersey i took kordell what a dumbass
she did good get the classic jersey of a hof player dont ever buy the jersey of an upcoming star

my 17 wallace jersey is a perfect example of that
just got a 40th bday gift of 43 home jersey also my first
good choice
i want
awesome
the bus my all time favorite steelers rb sorry leveon

bettis was the rb when i first got into the nfl back in 2001 steelers went 133 that year i believe and lost the afc championship to the patriots i am almost positive that game was one of the spygate games actually
and the best one putting htat jersey on one day in la i was given a better table at breakfast with a small discount and high fived fist bumped and cheered by every type of person and in every walk of life you could think of jarome bettis is a class act and when you put in his jersey you see how much people think of him its really humbling and cool
i just had the biggest brain fart
i have a franco harris jersey i could be your full back
franco had rocky blyer
nice my only really nice jersey is a white away ward i love it
block too peak bettis
i have this jersey bought it from the pittsburgh mills mall bettus is the best wish he was still around
thats a great one to have as itll never go out of style aside from roethlisberger you really cant guarantee any current player will remain on the team in years to come and then your 150 jersey can be found in the 10 bargain bin
i wish the new jerseys that the steelers wear were block numbers

i wish the new jerseys that we buy as fans to wear fit better like the old ones my current jerseys make it hard to lift my arms up the sleeves are so tight
its a great jersey i have a black bettis jersey

wasnt that just a few weeks ago
i distinctly remember a few comments here wanting us to sign matt patricia a few years back that one is so much worse
the fire tomlin crowd usually looks pretty foolish in retrospect they live play to play and series to series
man remember when a bunch of steelers fans wanted to fire mike tomlin and replace him with mike mccarthy doesnt that sound idiotic

could be said at any time
it sounded idiotic then too
its almost like the average fan is actually an idiot and the front office of one of the nfls most consistently successful teams might just know more about how to build a football team than they do
seems weird to even want to trade a hc with 1 sb for a different hc with one sb but alright
by remember when you mean right now on facebook right that place is terrible
it sounded idiotic then now it just sounds straight up asinine
yeah but tomlin totally didnt have control of the locker room this past weekend
i love western pa but unfortunately we all know some of our neighbors are never going to be happy with a head coach who looks like coach tomlin regardless of his record
i use to be fairly active in the steelers facebook community and there have been a big group of fire tomlin people there for years now i will say theres a lot more level headed people in the reddit community from my experience at least
it sounded equally idiotic then anyone who couldnt see it was woefully short sighted or guided completely by emotions
it always sounded idiotic
it sounded idiotic then too
never heard these discussions but whoever said it you are a dumbass
same people who said the steelers should start batch even when ben was healthy
well no one has ever accused the yinzers of being brightcrazy and loyal yesbut not bright
who ever said that i just cried for years to get rid of todd haley
love tomlin ive always defended him and will be glad that hell retire with us in infinity years cause i dont want him to leave
just wait for one bad half of football and theyll be prominently vocal
those werent steelers fans those were haters posing as steelers fan no real steelers fan is going to want to fire a coach that led us to the best record in football in the 2010s outside of the patriots never had a losing season and got us to 2 super bowls and 6 division titles i mean hes been with the same team for 13 years and has never had a losing record are they 5 coaches in the history of the league that can boast that stat
it sounded idiotic then
the good thing is rooney isnt jones and thank the football gods he aint
i love tomlin but someone please take away his challenge flag
im a fan of tomlin and think hes a great coach but cmon its three games into the season and weve played nobody yet

tomlin has issues and people pretending he doesnt are just being willfully ignorant steelers fans tend to either love or hate their teams very few are objective and willing to see both the good and bad of situations in an unbiased way i think the thing that bugs me the most are the big game gaffes that hurt the teams chances when they matter the most like killing clock to score a td with only seconds left or many instances where the challenge flag shouldnt have been thrown or the losing his locker room at times or the overlooking this weeks opponents or the decisions to go for it on 4th when two scores are needed and time is running out tomlins been fortunate in that hes coached a great team under great ownersstaff and hes been very lucky in that regard
i never wanted mccarthy but i do think tomlin tightened it up the past two seasons in 2018 and the few years prior he seemed to be much more passive and on the verge of losing the locker room last year and this year he has been on point and rock solid
i actually give art rooney ii a lot of credit he was under a lot of pressure to make a change but he instead made tomlin get a bunch of staff help and its showing up on the field with more sophisticated schemes and better preparedness no one ever really questioned tomlins club house chops although he started to go a bit soft during the ablev bell days but he was indeed getting badly outcoached for a couple seasons there and i dont think anyone really wanted mccarthy in any serious way steelers always go for the young unknown guy when they do decide to make a change and never pay big for coaching
weve literally played three winless teams while the cowboys have played the 31 rams 40 seahawks and 31 browns comparison isnt really apples to apples here

watching field goal practice pregame keisel jersey onhe came by and gave it to me
bk fear the beard nice yo
is it weird that he gave op only one shoe or is that just me

i can only picture him hobbling away with one shoe on now
whats in the crown royal bag dope shoe btw
going to be in colorado springs for a wedding looking to see if there are any steeler bars where i can be around the black and gold if you guys have any suggestions please let me know thanks
i lived in co for four years closest i can think of is jacksons hole across from coors field in denver i know thats not much help but if you get a chance to check it out do the owner has an entire section in the back of the bar reserved for steeler fans game is projected huge on a wall food there is amazing get the breakfast nachos tater tots with cheese salsa and sour cream bloody marys are great there too
i dont drink so im not super familiar with the bars but i am from springs my understanding is that the dublin house up north off academy is a steelers bar as well as the triple nickel on the east side of downtown we have a pretty big following out here so you have a chance to be in some decent company regardless of where you go good luck my brother
it was a 2030 minute uber outside of denver but the rusty bucket bar and grill was packed with steelers faithful it was unfortunately the game where they laid an absolute egg against the mike glennon lead bears but a good time nonetheless
in springs the dublin house
i used to live pretty far from the springs so sorry
but the rusty bucket in littleton was always a go for with the gang for game days
benders up in westminster but thats over an hour always a good time
i live in the springs and know that the triple nickel is one people say dublin house but i havent ever been there been to the triple nickle quite a few times its a downtown dive but you get yinzers there
from my travels the answer is usually yes but im not sure about colorado springs but statistically i think theres probably at least 1
how is mike tomlin off a byei really liked the steelers to start the season and thinking about using them in eliminator pools

i know philly just beat sf but maybe the niners arent that good they only beat the 2 ny dumpster fires
be humble this week guys we getting into trap territory play good and lets get the w
it does feel like the classic steelers were almost too well suited to beat this team so well probably play down to them and either lose or play a miserable game and win on a last second field goal type game
there was no extra week to prepare the titans game wasnt moved to week 7 until friday which means that the team was prepping for tennessee until then at most they have two extra days which is closer to replicating a thursday night game schedule obviously minus the actual game
i am fully prepared for hurts to come in and inexplicably put up 4 tds and everyone to declare the wentz era over only for him to look like shit for the next four games i can just feel it
going off the books there are 6 games with larger money line discrepancies than the pittsburgh game week so mathematically youre better off picking one of those
like i said in another comment last week was not treated like a regular bye week the team practiced like they had a game to play all the way up until thursday and theyve only gotten a few extra days to prepare for philly not a full week like a normal bye week i dont think we will see a blow out type game it will likely be a close game that alot of steelers fans will bitch about the play calling etc but ultimately i do think the steeler will win
49ers were without garop bosa thomas and sherman but eagles definitely have their backs to the corner which you never really want to go against
whenever we have time a bye and the advantage its usually time for us fans to close our eyes and pray we win
man ive had a long day and i hate the fuckin eagles
they didnt have an extra week to prepare they were preparing for tennessee until thursday morning then they sent everyone home because they were required by the cba to have 4 consecutive days off in order for the week to count as a bye

so yes i believe they will take a dump on philly but not because they had an extra week because theyre better
probably the opposite rusty game we lose
no it will be close
if anyone watches this team they know that we are usually sloppy off a bye but the thing is that this wasnt a normal bye and we pretty much practiced the whole bye week so i actually think thatll be an advantage for us
i think this steelers team is different form the team a few years ago in the sense that they will not overlook any opponent i think they will execute and dominate the run game steelers win 2513
honestly we should crush this team their offense has been bad and our defense should stuff them in the pass and run game they have a good front 4 so if ben can get rid of the ball quick and not take many sacks this should be an easy win

that said never underestimate the steelers ability to beat themselves when playing a bad team
on paper this should be a big game for our pass rushers ebron and the recieving corps in general but seems kinda like a trap game to me also we really only got 1 or 2 days of extra practice because last week we were preparing for tennessee
more chances of exactly the opposite happening
im sure theres a way to see tomlins record coming off a bye
its the steelerswe will win with a late game field goal
is it just me or do i feel like there are loads of shit teams this year that were at least decent last year like the texans we will dump on the eagles unless wentz just decides to start being good again i think steelers have a legit chance of going to the super bowl this year if covid doesnt get in the way
how has this fanbase not learned yet to never assume we blow out anyone especially philly who we have a very shaky history against recently
i still feel like our offense is shaky at best and im not sure how theyve looked so far this season but philly has a scary group of pass rushers on paper

derek barnett brandon graham malik jackson fletcher cox and javon hargrave
steelers lose when they are most expected to win this game scares tf out of me enough that i have eagles 10 in my bet slip
if they take a dump on philly its because theyre pissed off not because of the extra week look for it to be closer than it should be again
there is a chance we play down to the competition and stumble our way to a loss or tie but i hope not
eagles are 12 seems like a setup for a tomlin special

steelers also have not yet played a complete game on both sides of the ball weve seen glimpses but it hasnt yet all come together
they have a good dline and some receivers but carson wentz really playing bad these past 4 games so yeah there oline as well is not good
the eagles own the steelers in headtohead

no not at all what we need next season ol ol ol cb ilb
i think weve hit our critical mass on wrs even if juju walks ol is a priority
pitts looks dope but

the knock against him is the blocking its the thing that as florida fans knew all too well last year mullens offense as a whole struggled with far too often part of that comes back to pitts the need for him to provide extra protection instead of doing what he does best run routes and give trask a goto target could depend on the strides made from the florida offensive line which returns 4 starters

steelers expect their tes to block just ask ebron
with this name we have to get him right
not a priority

rtechnicallythetruth lol
you really got me there champ
no not that jon gruden
you scared me
ultimately the players health matters more than a good bye week and certainly our enjoyment i think that playing this season without a bubble was already foolish but forcing the pats and chiefs to play because its a big game was nothing but malicious science clearly said we wouldnt know for sure until over 5 days after the initial case because false negative rates remain high until about a week later and now because of this game players may suffer severe long term consequences and the chiefs franchise might collapse too if mahomes suffers long term lung damage as gilmore was all up in his face after the game too
the nfl is garbage its still the same league that put cte under the rug its still the same league that fought to keep the families of players who died before 2006 from receiving any part of the 1 billion concussion settlement theres no surprise that they are continuing to put money before the health of the players
i said the titans game should have been a forfeit last week and was downvoted in oblivion for it the nfl covid situation going forward is going to get worse not better some teams will be able to keep it at bay by having players coaches and ancillary follow the protocols that is essentially a discipline and conduct issue if this season has any hope of being completed teams that have covid outbreaks will have to start being counted as forfeits avoiding covid is possible the nhl and nba made it work if i had to bet money right now i would say that the steelerstitans game was the beginning of the end of this season because the nfl is a weak undisciplined league starting at the commissioners office and running down through several embarrassingly managed teams
i cant believe they just postponed a day given how the titans outbreak has gone the nfl did not plan to prevent the virus or deal with its inevitabilities because the league is a confederacy of rich assholes who legitimately dont care about the safety and wellbeing of the players and their families
im also happy we didnt play

we could be looking at multiple steelers testing positive if we would have played the game

it should be a forfeit though

pandemic control is just part of a teams preparation and performance right now

if you screw it up then you deserve to lose just like any other aspect of the game

if you have one team who is following protocols in their facility and players are going above and beyond by doing things like having their children learn online to help limit their possible exposure and then you have another team who is doing the stupid shit like oakland is doing then the one who needs to pay the price is the one who is playing it fast and loose
but a good bye week is for players health just depends on if the rona is worse than an injury



sources confirm to nc5 that a group of about 15 titans players held a workout at montgomery bell academy last wednesday one day after the teams facility was shut down by eight positive covid19 tests


so now all the people that were mad at us for blaming tennessee saying its not their fault for a national pandemic where do we stand
make an example of them force a forfeit against the steelers and the bills shut them down

oh and the reshuffle the games back to where they were originally
uthereandfatagain i recall you saying something along the lines of being unfathomable fuckwads in regards to people in this sub suggesting the titans outbreak likely happened for not following covid protocol wellhere you go
thats enough to piss a guy off right there our players going above and beyond to follow protocols doing more than what is expected then you have these chuckle fucks who seemingly want to ruin it for the rest of the league
never forget to remember fuck the titans

im gonna be pissed if the bills get a free win and we gotta deal with playing team plague rat and getting our bye fucked with

i know rnfl is beating their collective dick to this idea because its us but this shit is getting ridiculous cant wait to read the back pedaling from those saying it isnt like they violated protocols or anything
fucking donkeys give us our win then
the way i see it titans should forfeit any games they cant play same with ne same with us if it happens
taps the headline and stares waiting for the apology he knows will never come

s
make these fuckers forfeit the game against us that is absolute horse shit

edit they locked their sub now and youre not allowed to view it

edit2 no they didnt im just an idiot
i hate the idea of forfeits in the nfl but also fuck these guys for being assclowns no idea how the outbreak began but once the outbreak started everyone should have been sent home and told theyd be fined for doing anything nonessential that risks further exposure by the titans fo and the nfl would love to see some punishment handed down to everyone involved in this workout
guessing all well see is a big fine and maybe a lost draft pick
can we get their 4th for this insanity
forfeit the game and give us their draft pick
fuck titans if nfl doesnt force them to forfeit and give bye week back to steelers thats some straight bullshit
we deserve their draft picks for this obscene negligence
as sad as this is to say nothing will happen literally nothing
fine yes lost draft picks maybe lost gamelost revenue dont go all crazy here this is money were talking about nobody wants to lose money game on
i was really liking the titans with their smashmouf style of football but if they do dumb shit like this i dont like them anymore someone please alert the press
im all for coming down hard on the titans but the nfl wont make retroactive decisions there has never been a forfeit in league history theyre not going to issue it twice to the same team in one week
not a great look by the oilers getting together after the outbreak had started yinzers on this sub touting this like a smoking gun are ridiculous i mean cmon now just look at the raiders and tons of other teams struggling with protocols
forfeit they lose their 1st round pick next year we get that pick should be pretty cut and dry

no
wtf is with you guys and wanting every single qb
no
no
no
i just what didnt we do this yesterday with the trey lance question

stop wanting every player ever

rodgers took over in green bay because brett favre kept dicking the team around by not deciding whether he was retiring until after training camp started not because he had noticably fallen off in other words not because he couldnt compete but because he wouldnt

i dont see rodgers pulling that bit and i think gb keeps him as long as he wants to be there and can play if not they let him walk and he decides where he ends up and for what money and there isnt a damn thing any individual team can do to influence that decision except start stacking dollars
rodgers playing as a top 3 qb playing jordan love just cause you used a 1st rounder on him

nope not happening the nfl loses money by canceling games and thats more important than player safety and healthcare protocols
now that its come out that titans broke protocol and practiced on a private field after the facility was closed they forfeit any benefit of doubt it was fair but shitty up to the point where they actively contributed to their team outbreak they need to take the l
if the titans forfeit their week 5 game with the bills they should also forfeit week 4 against the steelers that is the only fair course of action
copying my comment from an rnfl thread

if they dont forfeit the steelers game then the bills shouldnt get a free win either just postpone that game too i know i sound like a crybaby right now but in a season that might end up having less than 16 games every win matters if the bills get a free win so do we
agreed but it wont happen we all know how the nfl never does the right thing in these scenarios exhibit a being last week and them not nipping this in the bud right away exhibit b being them seemingly having zero plan with regards to all this
if the bills end up getting a win from it then the steelers can have a good argument some people may not like the idea of automatically giving an undefeated team a win or a loss but if protocols were broken during week 4 and before the game was postponed i domt see why the steelers shouldnt get the free win
just a random thought but before the season started i honestly thought the nfl should of done a random blank week or two for everyone plus a bye just so they could flex things around because this was bound to happen eventually granted that would of extended the season a good bit but who cares safety is more important
if you think that tennessee is the only team that will run into this your being naive the season is going to have to be extended by at least 2 weeks as i see it if not more they should have planned ahead and did a 14 game schedule without bye weeks
it should be forfeit i say that because the titans negligence has resulted in the steelers going from week 7 on the road to week 8 bye to week 9 on the road to three away games in a row with no break that is a competitive disadvantage introduced in to the steelers schedule by the negligence of tennessee
did this illegal practice take place this week or last week it doesnt seem to make sense to make the titans should have to forfeit last weeks game because of something they did this week hate to say it im just being unbiassed here the initial outbreak has not been proven to be caused by breaking protocol
week 4 should have been pushed back give every single team the week off and resume after all the testing is done everyone gets an extra bye and they get about 2 week to get the outbreaks under control quarantine players and staff and force teams to play with what they have left play the damn super bowl in march
eyes on the prize people maybe the season should be scrapped for health reasons lives more important than a game and i love football
dont say this on their sub i got banned for saying they deserve to take an l lol
i agree it sure looks like tennessee cant get its act together
nfl cant retroactively force a team to forfeit so this just cant happen wish it would it would definitely be more fair to the team and the league as a whole but it is what it is and we just need to embrace the change and be thankful we even have a football season and an undefeated team right now on to philly
titans should forfeit week 4 dropping them to 31 and the same in week 5 if they dont have their shit together 32

but the steelers should still be only 30 after a titans forfeit they shouldnt get a win

use win to figure out the standings

idk why this is so hard

that salute
just had to get that trump dig in there
im gonna be so pissed if the titans have to forfeit against bills and we are the ones that get absolutely fucked and just have to deal with it if we dont get a forfeit we have to at least get some draft compensation or something
the whole situation sucks and shows the nfl did zero planning for this inevitability everybody dogpiling on the players and teams is easy but this was going to happen eventually are we going to dock the pats bc cam spread his covid too we already know he got too close to multiple ppl in their building the titans situation is different in that they had an outbreak and dudes got caught on a practice field outside the teams facility thats on them and they should get punished accordingly
ucaptainfatfuck7 is going to smite all of tennessee if this happens
when we win the super bowl after having to deal with it it will be legendary
im not sure why everyone is taking about forfeits just cancel the damn games so pit and buf only play 15 games and you take the winning percentage out of that for the standings ten only has 14 games

the nfl accepted that possibility when they decided to hold the season
i dont want titans to forfeit not to us and especially not to the bills a team we will very likely be competing for playoff seeding against
unfortunately our game was rescheduled before the nfl instituted forfeits as a possible punishment so i doubt they could retroactively change ours super shitty considering this weeks game isnt gonna happen and its confirmed they practiced outside the facility on wed before our game looks like the bills are getting a free w and were getting the shaft
dont win super bowls with forfeits im actually hoping the steelers and titans play should be a good test plus my good buddy is a titans fan
i doubt the titans will be magically better and allowed to play by week 7 we might end up with a forfeit later

rivalry aside even i think this shit screwed you immensely
the titans need to lose a first round draft pick they need to be made an example of to the rest of the league
they better give us a forfeit at least if they lose a pick and we dont get a forfeit it really doesnt do us much good
forfeiture or i dont care
1 coach and gm fined 1000000 team fined 10000000 all of it goes to covid relief in the nashville area

2 they forfeit last week and this week and are ineligible for postseason play in 2020 and 2021

3 lose a first round in 2021 and 2022

4 all players coaches and staff must sign onto a public apology to the entire league and its fans for fucking up everything in such a monumental way

5 3 years of probation any violations like this again and all said penalties are doubled

if that happens id feel slightly better
there wont be a forfeit nfl makes zero on a forfeit why cant you seem to understand isnt all about whats best for steelers
anyone know of a good spot in orlando to catch the steeler game maybe a bar that might have all the games on their own tvs maybe theres a steeler bar in orlando
when i lived there there were a couple on christ street downtown but also nypd pizza would show steelers games be safe nobody in florida is taking the virus seriously anymore and cases are spiking
there are no good bars in florida right now
in winter park there is a bar called spatz i used to go to to watch the game it wasnt necessarily a steelers bar but the bartenders were steelers fans i miss that place

whyyyyy
this sub and the obsession with backup qbs is out of this world
this is just some ironic joke right
first aaron rodgers now haskins what are we gonna see next brett favre out of retirement
no
there are so many reasons why not to do it first of all he doesnt fit the system 2nd of all washington is fucking his development 3rd of all randy fichtner couldnt develop a qb if his life depended on it quit with the desperation for once in your goddamn life
if we want to take a look at him itll be cheaper to just pick him up off the scrap heap after football team cuts him

he wouldnt do us any good this year anyway whatever else you can say about him hes coming along well in his nfl development isnt among those things if he came in today and was immediately instated as the backup there would be no reason to think hed be anything more than absolutely terrible at it for the short term we dont have to give up a 4th and a 7th for that weve already got it covered
he is bad at professional football
he sucks no thank you
why
conditional 7th maybe
this happening has the same odds as andy luck coming out of retirement and us trading for him after ben rides off into the sunset this year
i actually would like to trade for him send rudolph and a 3 maybe

ben roethlisberger said the steelers got the short end of the stick regarding the disruption to their schedule and their shortened threeday bye week he also added hes just starting to get ramped back up and the postponed game against tennessee halted progress

i find myself ok with the browns finally showing some life last year browns fans were planning their parade in march but they all got smacked back down to reality this year they havent been quite as vocal
gpodawund
my best friend was a die hard browns fan when he died i adopted them as my second team kinda glad to see them finally doing well
bengals vs brownies afc north championvid 2020

hey we got fkd on the bye week thing and brady is retiring to gods waiting room this year

strange times indeed
having watched them play i dont think im ready to call them good yet
i dont know if beating the cowboys and bengals qualifies them as good but okay

you knowtj is one of my favorite playersbut his high kick celebration thing not a big fan

this made me uncomfortable
wtf is this video
i dont know he took a risk and it didnt work out for him i would gladly be paid a fraction of what he is for being in a shitty situation many of us basically already do this guy is being paid a shit ton to sit on a bench if it comes down to it lets be real
he doesnt give a shit if he gave a shit about winning and being a great football player then he would have never have sat out and would still be in pittsburgh which is totally fine but its funny to me that people would think hes pissed or upset about it in anyway he doesnt care he has his money thats what he was after
honestly you gotta feel bad for the guy at this point he royally screwed himself over
frank gore played like absolute shit and will probably not see more than 5 touches next week with bell healthy

frank gore basically proved how inept that offense is and highlighted how well bell is really doing with everything working against them
it would be more accurate if you could photoshop her dancingcrying in a bank
bell doesnt give a shit hes got his dough probably going to retire when his fat contract expires and live the good life must be nice
why are there so many bell posts these last two weeks the man did what he thought he needed to do to make the most money possible for him and his family let him live his life
what the fuck is this videos context
yall are taking this too seriously its a meme
i still miss lev he was well on his way to being one of the greats imagine him alongside juju johnson claypool and ebron i cant think of a team that could match up with them
2 words leveon eat shit
how dare you place the steelers and tik tok in the same post downvoted through and through lol

pretty sweet we got a signed helmet for our christmas
happy birthday king

ready for game time

johnson is like the epitome of steelers football

at any moment quite literally everything can go wrong for seemingly no reason at all but at the same time at any moment quite literally everything can go for seemingly no reason at all

my heart still has not adjusted to all this being in a single player
and thats with a few bad drops

that mclaurin guy gonna have to watch him probably the only bright spot in that horrible washington team keep hearing about him and was coached by ike hilliard

you forget limas sweed
hollywood would be a top 5 wr if he was on a team with a qb who airs it out more

there is evidence that the team didnt follow protocol and given the number of players who caught it it isnt unreasonable to think that this most recent evidence wasnt the first time that protocol was broken

i think it would be ridiculous for them to forfeit the bills game but not the steelers game
call me crazy but if they were disregarding covid19 policies while their facility was shut down due to a covid19 outbreak something tells me they werent exactly following covid019 policies to begin with

kind of like someone getting hurt on a job site messing around or doing something they werent supposed or not wearing proper ppe likeliness is that wasnt their first time disregarding the rules it was just the first time they found out why the rules were actually there

having said that i get what others are saying about not liking the idea of being handed a win but im also not fond of handing the advantage to the ravens in the division and give them more prep time for us the week 8 bye meant we got to rest after facing them and the next game against them would be in our house

right now weve got the win advantage and i think we can carry that to when we play the ravens

the titans fucked themselves on this one with meeting like that to train and all that they fully deserve to have forced forfeits and everything else thankfully they started testing positive before we had a chance to step onto the field with them and looks like they are only taking themselves down

the other teams who are starting to have issues well see
personally i dont really care the scenario i dont want to be handed a win particularly considering were winning the superbowl this year
getting handed a win from the league because a playoff team was incapacitated does nothing to make the steelers better as much as i like free things getting a win by forfeit will hurt us in the long run

absolutely unbelievable that theyre probably gonna get away with screwing us out of our midseason bye week
if they dont forfeit the game the titans need to at least forfeit a first or second round draft pick to the steelers
they broke protocol to get into this spot im not going to go over the timeline again but an outside layman can see that

signed a dude who tested positive during his mandatory 4 day window wasnt supposed to be around team or facilities

now everyone has it
dont think itll matter in the greater scope of things its gonna happen to more and more teams until its impossible for the season to continue
i just wanna preface this by saying yeah i know it sucks to lose the week 8 bye and also have the ravens coming off their bye before the game in baltimore but its also not the end of the world what doesnt kill you makes you stronger blah blah blah you get it

every game not playedtelevised is lost revenue for the league and that affects everyone less revenue means a lower cap next year and as many of you know the steelers cap situation next year is a major issue and to make things worse their list of urfas is long hilton juju big al feiler sutton conner banner ect

those games could end up being the difference between juju being a raven or a patriot next year or staying with the steelers think on that before wishing for a free win plus the best revenge against the titans is to kick their asses straight up on the football field go team
the nfl and nflpa reached an agreement late last week where the 2021 salary cap will have a floor of 175 million the revenue loss will be spread out the next three years if revenues are better than expected the 2021 salary cap could be higher this years salary cap will remain at 1982 million

the cap isnt going to be devastated because of lost revenue it will very likely go down but it wont go further than 175m thats a sizable chunk potentially gone but i really dont think itll be backbreaking especially if some players like juju take backloaded contracts until more revenue comes in

in the least were not as fucked as teams like houston after they gave watson all that guaranteed money
i think some of their players will be suspended so hopefully they remain suspended against us


theyll be fined which means fuck all to us


but what would be cool the rescheduled game should be our home game have them surrender their home game to us and the bills and whoever else along the way


i cant imagine us getting their picks though coz then the bills etc are gonna want picks too and who gets priority
yeah that would make sense of the nflpa already agreed to prevent such
they practiced after the league told them not to fuck them they should forfeit vs us and the bills if not then give us their draft picks steelers players are even asking why they didnt play now several players asking i thought that was the purpose of expanded practice squads to get sick players out
they should forfeit their next two years of first round picks 1 to the steelers and 1 to the bills
removed

were the better team if healthy we should be expected to win our division no need for cutting edge journalistic enterprise hottakescoldbeercom to spell it out so i wont grace their spam with my clickage
win there i summed up the article in 1 word
if we win more games than them i bet we dethrone them as afc north champs
to save yinz a click its 4sentence blurb that basically just says steelers defend good and offense needs to play better also a gif of vances stiff arm on conte thats it scorching

op is spamming this nfl article on various team subs
nfl article i would expect that to be on or affiliated with nflcom not some fan site blog looking place
the sub wouldnt be the same without fresh yinzer opinions voice your unpopular thoughts hot takes and bold predictions here about anything football related

hate an admired playercoach love a hated playercoach do you actually like roger goodell think jesse didnt catch it he did any opinion about the steelers the rest of the league or the game in general are accepted throw em all here

responding to someones comment to create civil discussion and changing opinions are encouraged dont be a damn jagoff and turn it into a toxic argument

do not downvote others because you dont like their opinion

downvotereport content that break the rules

this thread is intended to not shame others who have different ideas and thoughts that go against the grain of the metas in the sub



and as always dont be a damn jagoff
titans forfeit bills game not steelers game everyone get pissed but it doesnt matter because titans test positive all the way to week 10 and forfeit anyway
unpopular opinion we lose this one because of a lack of momentum from an unexpected bye week along with a rejuvenated eagles team coming off a win against the 49ers that and steelering

bold prediction ignoring my unpopular opinion the steelers steamroll with 4 first half td passes from ben woohoo
with the eagles suspect secondary and strong defensive front ben has to get the ball out quickly we will see 5 or more 40 yard passing plays with 2 of them being hauled in by claypool for 111 yards
tyson alualu scores a defensive touchdown off a sack fumble return in the 2nd quarter
also can people stop talking about trap games every single pregame thread or discussion thread turns into a but guys is this really a trap game thing just stop
i dont want the titans to forfeit the game to the steelers id rather see the steelers bury them week 7
we witness the awakening of dionate and chase this game

post game edit halfway called it
bold prediction mapletron catches a 69 yard touchdown and swings his dick in celebration
steelers win totaling 8 sacks
steelers nation radio needs to stop it with the religious shit and praying and reading bible verses
i kinda tuned out of football news since our bye week started and all the crazy shit happened politically recently kept me distracted

my bold prediction is that mason rudolph will be the quarterback for the final few minutes of the game by that i mean kneeling out the wi because we are up by so much
probably an unpopular opinion but we need to look into bens future replacement after this season we have talented young players on both sides of the ball and it could all go to waste if we wait too long and end up with a mediocre qb

the content i needed today
hello pandae love the work even though youre not a steelers fan
the little smiley face on the steel beam really makes this drawing
gritty
stunning phenomenal exactly what this sub and the world needed
is that gritty
i see what you did there im beaming
beautiful
love these
well you are quite the artiste
should we tell him














im just kidding there better be a fucking game this weekend
steagles
steel beam you say

like a light beam

cue music

yeah smoking out the pound of p
i got a plan like master p
told her everything aint what it seems
okay you gotta light on you a beam
im the king of all her dreams
super fresh like listerine
okay shawty i got lots of teams

ok ill stop
fuck the flyers fuck the eagles carry on
i love the face on the steel


feel like the whole nfl hopped on the fuck the titans train over the last 24 hours
nfl needs to quit pussyfooting around on punishments be it for a player or a team its time they lay down the law set an example
as a steelers fan living in buffalo i lived in pittsburgh for 5 years then moved to buffalo for employment i finally have something that everyone around me can agree with

edit fuck the patriots we have that
my prediction is the nfl makes them forfeit the game against the bills but not the steelers it would be totally unfair but save them the money of cancelling only 1 game instead of 2 and would be very classic nfl to care more about money than fairness

large fine for the team vrabel suspension and all those who practiced illegally suspended is probably where theyll start maybe a loss of a draft pick as well who knows at this point i know the nfl would try to work around a forfeit as hard as they can but its certainly on the table
youre missing 29 more arms
if they make them forfeit the bills game but not the steelers im gonna be fuming
do people actually think theyre going to forfeit games you think the nfl is just gonna say ok cbs dont give us money
two great tastes that taste weird together
give us their first round pick
they should do the standings based on win the titans get loses stillers and bills get nothing they only play 15 games its not fair to other teams if some teams are getting free wins
and i was on the playoff bandwagon for the titans last year but now im like fuck them
hell we could even throw in a raven hand there id imagine if you fuck with my bye week bc another team cant get with id be upset too
i saw a twitter post detailing that both teams will not get paid if the game is forfeited so maybe just forfeit the bills game eh
so i think it should be a forfeit for both but the bills and steelers still get paid it doesnt make sense to punish the teams that are following the rules and staying vid free
now that the titans were caught redhanded practicing when they were supposed to be quarantined they should also be fined out the ass and penalized draft picks
as far as giving those picks to other teams vs they just become dust in the wind that i dont know
a part of me they do ferfeit both games and the other have allen and singletary on my fantasy league
also destiny 2 players
this shouldnt even be a question this should have happened for our match and if it happens for bills beyond we raise hell fuckgoodell
its really simple if a team cant put together a team that can pass the coved 19 test then forfeit we got shawshank redemption
and now the next mf is lined up in the shower if you cant play get the f out the way
agreed
i think the players who heldattended the workouts should lose their paychecks for the rest of the season maybe a little harsh but i think its fair i also like the loss of draft picks idea as well

this feels like a trap game

however i would like nothing more than for the steelers defense to get 10 sacks and 3 turnovers
tj dont mind if i do
with his helmet on you cant tell what a thick and righteous fro tj has
wow the franklin institute boutta smack carson back to north dakota

weve already had a few guys on and off the covid19 injury reserves including washington

seems like the shoe was on the other foot we didnt like the feel and handled shit accordingly
if the steelers handled it as poorly as the titans have id say end their season too fuck any team that would put the health of their players other teams players and all their family members at risk just to play a game
contracting a virus isnt a moral failure you could get it from any number of sources it doesnt have to be a result of negligence

thank you for making this
aye
remember fuck the titans
oh covid definitely remembered the titans

not good for the ol blood pressure ill tell you what
me where is tj is he safe is he alright

report it seems in his anger he hurt his knee

me no hes alright i saw it i nnnnooooooo

report hes not in danger of missing the game though d

me you son of a bitch
hope he is okay
maybe that bye week did come at the right time i noticed alot of talk during the reddit live game thread about teej getting hurt im glad he finished the game but i had been wondering what all that talk was about
tj watt linebacker defensive specialist for the pittsburgh steelers a man barely alive

gentlemen we can rebuild him

we have the technology

we have the capability to make the worlds first bionic man

tj watt will be that man

better than he was before

better stronger faster
i assume he is fine but i dont like hearing him on the injured report
sounds like a day off to me
am i the only one who wishes he wouldnt do that leg kick for his celebration move

vance also said hed rather block all game than get 1 catch thats a team player if ive ever seen one ebron owes him a beer
i really like how theyre specializing their roles on the offense on the other hand nothing makes me happier than watching defenders bounce off of vance like hes made of rubber
fichnter added that hes excited to see the impact this has in the run run pass strategy totally not lifted from haleys playbook minus 40000 bubble screens

i just wanna see mcdonald stiff arm some motherfuckers straight out of the league
as one of vances biggest critics ive been super pumped about his approach having a stud blocker thats an average receiver at te is such an underrated thing
is he just not a fan of getting hit low on those short crossing routes tes usually get cant blame him for that
how much of that ten pounds is in his hair and beard

i mean mcdonald looks like an actual minnesota viking

thats awesome man
epic gift kudos to your wife for such a great gift
super cool i was concerned it said switzer which would mean it has definitely been dropped on the ground
shes a keeper
she has excellent taste
thats awesome
did you waive for a fair catch when she gave it to you


im kidding awesome gift


edit oh shit thats shazier not switzer


still awesome
thats pretty badass im jealous is your wife single

outstanding
i think this was shopped

the good old riley meme
your moms basement needs sanitizing

i didnt watch this but ive had a few beers and the words next man up has me thinking of tomlin and makes me wanna run through a fucking wall for that man
very sad to hear about tunch having als lets hope for some breakthroughs in that diseases treatments


ive met tunch and he prayed with my family so my uncle would get a kidney my uncle got a kidney so im going to pray for tunch
tunch will beat down the disease like he beat down defensive linemen
damn wishing him the best
fuck poor guy
yeah what a bummer watching him this year you could tell something wasnt right
the good news is als research has done wonders ever since the ice bucket challenge hopefully he pulls through
fuck als
just in time hope this helps him
manthat is awful wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy such a horrible disease
goddammit too young to have seen tunch play but his voice is a sunday afternoon staple i wouldnt wish that disease on anyone
just listened to him and wolf last week on the dve2 hd radio station i knew something was up and was googling furiously trying to find out if something had happened with him very sad to hear but hopefully new research can help him prayers for tunch
i work with the als association and know that there is a solid chapter in western pa my grandfather got care in pittsburgh when he had als about 15 years ago and there are great medical experts in pittsburgh and ohio

very sad to hear this about tunch i wouldnt wish als on anyone i hope this brings some needed attention to the disease the care available in 2020 is better than it has ever been but its a very difficult disease and hard to plan for the trajectory of it steve gleason has lived with it for many years now but its not easy

i hope he and his family get all of the care and support that they need
oh my god tunch is more than just the voice of the steelers network he is an amazing individual who ive had the privilege of meeting on many different occasions my prayers go out to this very spiritual heart and soul of steeler nation we love you tunch
such a good player and great person my first memory of him was watching him play basketball on the steelers team that would play vs all the local school districts wishing him and his family all the best in this tough time
prayers up for tunch and his loved ones
oh man thats heartbreaking hes a hell of a guy wishing him and his family the best
oh shit i wouldnt wish that on anyone
damn that sucks listen to him and wolf daily after randy bauman on dve
damnthat is heartbreaking i hope he and his family are able to cope with this as well as possible
oh no i am heartbroken for him
very sad and sending prayers his way listening to his show on steelers nation radio for a few years now and could tell something was up with him
damn poor guy
terrible i knew he didnt sound right during the first game this year he just seemed completely out of it and not his normal self
i met tunch and wolf years ago he is genuinely good person and godly man praying that he will beat this insidious disease

might be in the minority but these are lame
i agree
wish they would wear these one game
its not a salute to service its an insult to it

the us armed services are meant to be somber and serious institutions the only purpose of which is to protect the citizenry from real lifethreatening dangers

the marketing and fetishization of them is why you get things like heavily armed militias plotting to kidnap and lynch elected us officials tv has talked them into hating

this is propaganda for profit nothing more nothing less
every time someone takes a cell phone pic of a computer screen i die a little bit
those are actually pretty bad ass

gotta admit juju out there hustling my dream is he is trying to use endorsements to make up for the money we cant pay him the ultimate team player
i like juju as much as the next steeler fan but i dont think i would feel comfortable drinking something called juju juice
i guess hes juice juice smithschuster now

juju is going to make 500 million dollars at this point jesus
combining tik tok youtube instagram twitch endorsements his own branding for his charities hes beginning to become a marketing genius especially for what he stands for idk just have a lot of respect for it all
should have been jujuice
im going to need someone from pittsburgh to send me some juju juice asap
hes like the master p of the nfl
please use this thread to post anything doesnt have to be steelers or football related at all dont downvote in this thread if you see someone being a jerk report it or message the mods about it

pats facility is shut down this morning sunday due to another positive test as per schefter
looks like tjs going to be on pats youtube show around 3 pm for anyone looking to listen i think pats on sirius now too

just thought yinz should know

edit it was the third hour not 3 pm sorry fellas and ladyfellas for the wrong time
good looking out
hes coming on now just a heads up
hes on
hopefully we get insider info about the cgap

dont tell the guys in rlakeeriebros this but the steelers have always been the only other team i actively root for outside of my bills my dad was a fan when he was a kid during the steelcurtain era that carried over when youre not playing us ill always root for you also lets hope this years snf game is less ugly than last years same outcome would be great though sorry love you guys
pittsburgher living in buffaloid say our hate for the patriots is what we most share
titans tennessee football team they offend me
fuck the titans and deflatriots
as a steelers fan loving in buffalo its been a weird 2 weeks
the rust belt is pretty large i wouldnt be surprised if a significant portion of the nfl is rust belt but i do respect and kind of like the bills all things considered they have a good ownership and fan base

your snow can fuck off though
got nothing but love for you guys bills fans are fucking awesome and im hoping at some point i can find my way to buffalo for a game
titans are becoming footballs trashtros

theres prolly a bunch of cool ass people in this sub the cross section of stuff i like and football is pretty remarkable
always hand in hand with bills bros theyre the reason why we were able to hand the bengals such an epic loss in the 2015 playoffs
can someone tell me why we hate the titans i get the whole covid thing but multiple steelers have said its nbd im confused
there were some egregious buffalonians on my floor at pitt tied with eagles fans when it comes to enjoying their own heartbreak but when they got a win man was it fun
buffalo bill bros
everyone hates the patitans so were all family here

well except ravens fans
fuck the pats
remeber last year when we loved the titans yeah me neither
bills look crazy good this year and allen looks much improved and like the real deal hopefully theyre peaking too early and will cool off otherwise id say theyre the afc super bowl favorite at the quarter mark
the steelers and bills were the only teams that voted against art modell relocating the browns to baltimore
it was not a lateral it was a forward pass hate the titans and odonnell too
fuck the titans

remember when that kicker faked getting knocked down in the playoffs

i remember
i mean the best bill ever was a western pennsylvania kid
why would we bother hating the titans all they did was get sick

you want to hate someone hate the nfl for not legislating preventative measures the way youd like

or the leadership of the country for defanging the cdc and for actively promoting the growth and spread of covid and actively attacking and marginalizing those who seek to prevent it

titans owners coaches and players were just duped by and then coddled by the same people who have put the whole nation and much of the world in danger with their dangerous antiscience headinthesand rhetoric

i like and respect vrabel and the titans a lot more for fucking over brady and belicheat in their swan song than i could ever hate them for being fooled by people in power
he just said on the pat mcafee show we all feel our great my body feels great

was scared he was on injury report yesterday but i think this means hes fine
yes people love to take the extremely basic practice designations as a symbol that someone is destroyed for the next gameseason etc


no i dont think i will

jesus christ so much nonsense in that writeup no one needs that much useless information
i got arthritis scrolling to the comments
this is no opponent texans game day food thread
the richest comment in that thread is when one person said we dont have talent at wr outside of juju
they knocked off the ravens last year
they also stomped on the terrible towel so fuck em
that was last year this is 2020 this year is a separate dimension in and of itself
last season is last season this season they are messing with our world so no
titans ravens patriotssame damn thing

all suck none are special dont put the pats and the ratbirds on pedestals steeler fans arent jealous of any team
also joe nedney

fuck that team
hol up they knocked off the pats and the ravens in the playoffs last year never forget ill gladly give them a 5 year reprieve for that
it does not matter what they did last year

and in the end its only matters if we beat the ravens

i dont care who else afc north loses to as long as they lose to us
lol i thought this was gonna say jesse james caught that ball
lmao they woulda definitely lost to chiefs or 49ers theyre ass postseason


also this but yknow fuck me i should get banned for saying we shouldnt immediately all dogpile on the titans and demand draft picksforfeit wins

with 1 less game yeet
rnfl loves talking about how this is irrelevant due to us playing only bad olines
burrows sweating intensifies
nut
kevin colbert is damn near perfecti edited from god

2 years agono defense last year helmets were thrown the ship has been righted
seemingly

3 years and back on the path to 7 thats great team management love the potential of this team remember when we lost to the raiders
unbelievable they all make eachother better so not only are they individually stars the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
thats really saying something for tj considering he gets held half the time
wow
guys is this good

lets introduce them to blitzburgh
the eagles are injured to shit in related news grass is green
i just saw a boot go flying across the room i think thats how theyll create the pass
theyre gonna throw to tight ends a lot
good luck with that
short quick passes all day so we cant pass rush
bold strategy cotton

this is corny as fuck but i love it
they dont have much likeness lol just a black dude and a white dude
tj just looks like hes whining while bud flexes at him lol
this makes me strangely uncomfortable

my therapist luigi bud dupree isnt real it cant hurt you

luigi bud dupree
rblursedimages
wheres tuitt
love the concept but tj looks like my 4 yr old son throwing a tantrum
we should wear overalls as pants one game
super sack brothers


ahhh i see why this is nsfw
isnt this normal wasnt there a humorous story this off season where ben was trying to get the defense to hit him and they refused

also is there a team in the nfl whose starting qb isnt off limits during practice

he aint touchin nobody who you touchin nobody
i i need an adult
its crazy for how good hargrave was last year we havent missed him one bit in 3 games
hes still a rotational player on the eagles didnt do all that much last week i am looking forward to seeing his patented fork lift move against pouncey if pouncey has any weakness its that he can be power rushed and bull dozed at times another interesting match up for sunday
this gives me a strange sensation deep down in my pants
giggity
how is the gravedigger doing this year
now i want ben to stiff arm him as he runs for 11
phrasing
good guy javon
apparently hargrave hasnt heard of the metoo movement which clearly states you cant harass a woman unless youre really good looking then its flirting



very low effort but i was bored
havent even seen the final product but thats hilarious

here we go
the circle is about 4 in diameter irrc

retro bowl is such a great game i recommend it to literally anyone that has a working phone and likes football even a little bit
great game i rename all the players after current steelers players
love the game played it nonstop for two weeks
careful i think you meant the pittsburgh iron workers wouldnt want the nfl to get upset

but seriously great game i did the same but i think it took me longer to get a defense that could allow me that 1 drive per game to screw things up
such a great game and costs one dollar very much recommended
love retro bowl won 11 championships with the lers didnt realize how much they updated the game i havent played in a while
man this game is just sooooo addictive and yes i only play with the steelers herewego

who the fuck is zach gelb
classic shitty argument just because something worse is going on the world it means you cant complain about anything else dude sounds like a kid in this
zach gelb can go fuck himself

big ben got asked a question during an interview and answered it honestly no one would be happy going from a week 8 bye to a week 4 bye especially when its the fault of another team who cant follow simple fucking protocols to get their house in order and put something on the field

oh and a division rival were currently leading benefited immensely from this move

zach gelb then tries to bring up the current covid19 situation and people losing their jobs because of the ongoing pandemic like hes not lucky as fuck to be a sports broadcaster and that if dumb fucks like the titans continue to disregard protocol the shit that keeps him employed shuts the fuck down and hes one of those out of a job

so my question is who asked zach gelb for his opinion how fucking pathetic are you to post a minute plus long rant about someone being unhappy with a major change at their fucking job because another organization caught covid19 then did shit like continue meeting disregarding protocol and more does this dumb fuck not see the god damn irony in saying big ben has nothing to complain about because of the current situation while complaining about his complaints

oh yea and because of the titans look at all the major changes the schedule for week 5 has to go through as well oh and the steelers didnt really get a bye because the game wasnt delayed until friday after the team spent all week preparing as if they were going to play because the nfl doesnt have any fucking back up plans for a team does something as insanely stupid as not take covid19 seriously
aw stop it zach gelb enough of you

there are people who actually have reallife issues this year people losing jobs people losing loved ones people getting diagnosed with this virus and testing positive

and i have to hear zach gelb complaining about big ben
im so bored of this formula

a player is asked a very specific and direct question by a reporter

player rolls eyes and responds

quote is then shared without any context as if the player is just shouting it from the rooftops and hoping people hear
never heard of her must be a bengals fan
this two time superbowl winning qb whos been in the league for 16 years thinks he can speak about the nfl
so

not important enough to say through the media big bens opinion of his professional situation in the time of covid

clearly important enough to say through the media zach gelbs opinon of big bens opinion of his professional situation in the time of covid

makes plenty of sense

zach doesnt get to fall back on its his job to spew through the media because thats also part of bens job so much so that when players dont spout they even get fined for it
what an asinine argument lol fuck that idiot
zach gelb never heard of him some schmuck trying to get attention by shitting on popular players with dumb takes get this great value mark madden outta here
lol that reporter is an idiot

this is their job that we have decided needs to happen i love football and missed it im glad its being played

but the players are also allowed to express their opinions and unhappiness when things happen the nfl hasnt planned well enough to play in the midst of a pandemic theyre still people regardless of if theyre getting paid millions or have access to good healthcare
by his logic isnt he wrong for complaining about a guy complaining when theres worse things going on in the world
who is zach gelb
the dude has 6000 followers on twitter hes literally nobody
also it was not a normal byeweek they were practicing up until the announcement as if they were still playing as normally schedule such a dumb take
zach gelb looks like mason rudolph after being stung by a dozen bees
when will people realize the sports reporter hot take doesnt give you anything more than temporary ratings

for example espn has basically become the hype and hot takes network and they are losing viewership in droves and are ready to layoff a bunch of their workforce because people got tired of the nonsense

always providing nothing but hot take gives a sports reporter 15 minutes of fame but then people realize that kind of behavior makes the reporter look childish and immature quickly ending those 15 minutes in a cold cold way

the sports reporters who quietly do their jobs and give informative analysis are the ones with staying power and are more likely to be seen as an authority of the subject in the eyes of others

edit to add and off topic

by the way it was refreshing to hear kirk herbstreit and chris fowler call an nfl game without them feeling the need to hype every play and player chris collinsworth on nbc can learn from these guys and realize that not every player deserves the line thats what makes name such a great player after they make a good play sometimes just call a good play a good play and move on no need to spend the next minute hyping the player andor play

just call the game and stop artificially hyping it we know if something worth getting hyped up about happens were watching the game too
lol his take is laughable he must not have even listened to the press conference
what a moron i cant imagine the amount of pain he is in after a season at his age of course he should be upset about the bye week its a crucial recovery week for players
well you know what they say about opinions everyones a yadda yadda

hard for anybody to have a good passer rating when they have 4 guys in their face before they finish their drop back
shoutout to the browns
but every game thread i have been reading how our cbs have gone downhill and are constantly getting burnt s

i think the steelers will win on a walk off field goal
i think its going to be a lot closer than we expect while the eagles basically have no receivers we are known to play down and our offense hasnt quite hit their stride yet its going to be close
it feels like we always lose to the eagles im shook
i think the steelers will win on a walk off field goal
i just want a win preferably a blowout for once but ill take any kind of win
i think the defense will hold them to a performance similar to week 9 against the rams last year
60 chance of rain
453
e
i dont think the bye is gunna help us necessarily but who knows i do know we seem to play every team close regardless of skill level so i wouldnt be surprised if it didnt look similar to the giants game we will probably control the gamehave a decent edge but still only win by 10 or less

2113 steelers
are you unfamiliar with ben coming off a bye week
close win or loss 2320
i dont think we blow them out but we should get the w i just cant help but think how much this feels like it could easily be that classic steeler let down game
i really hope for a solid w it would lessen my anxiety for the expectations i have but in all reality steelers win 3124 playing behind most of the game
steelers win 2723
3114 ertz hurts us early but we adjust
i think edp445 is going to continue bashing the eagles and thanking the steelers for kicking their shit
we are going to start off very slow go into the half 13 6 defensive td on a pick 6 then turn it up in the second half with the final score 30 13
as much as i love conner injury seem like they love him just as much so watching the games from last season and the sprinkling that weve had of snell i thought he was gonna take over after conner he runs with heart and power but the fumbles are a problem now watching mcfarland dude is so explosive so just curious who you guys think gets plugged in of conner goes down
is it just me or does benny seem really small this year
after connor and yesthis is kind of a cop outbut i think they will see who has the hot hand snell brings power and toughness mcfarland brings speed and agility

if snell could learn to hang onto the ball i would prefer him as the feature back over mcfarlandjust for the ability to power throughlike bettis but all that is for naught if he is a fumble machine

edit in short snell reminds me of a bettis type runner mcfarland reminds me of a dwight stonewillie parker kind of runner
nobody outside conner is nearly talented or reliable enough to be more than part of a committee so nobody is the answer youre looking for
me
if it was one guy probably snell because his build but itd likely be a committee
i wish wed see more of mcfarland tbh he is fast as hell his build doesnt scare me hes the same size as miles sanders

probably to play fbspecial teams like hes done before since derek watt is out

not weird many coaches travel in packs you work together at xyz university then get firedleave find new job and bring others with you or one of them gets a job and brings you with them its been ths way for years for many staffs in college and nfl its a very small fraternity that seemingly values loyalty sometimes over capability

just read a tweet from mike giardi where he was told by tannehill that the titans lost faith in the testing process like motherfucker you assholes were holding unsanctioned practices when you were supposed to be sitting at home
so now reports are they held an unsanctioned practice the day after they were told to shut down how is the nfl not stepping in and punishing them they deliberately shirked the rules and have negatively affected two teams class organization my ass
thats just gross negligence now
grown men can act like babies sometimes
like really how hard is this shit everyone else is doing this shit working shit jobs for no money how are these guys having such a hard time playing a fuckin game
itt

some points made that seriously make me question how those people havent been taken out by natural selection by now

credit to my buddy kevin we went on a boat ride around the city and got this wild picture

edit turns our utopperh2 does have a reddit account
cant wait to see the guy who does the wake up mother fuckers posts here in a couple hours gets me rock hard every time
peta going to be very mad when we destroy the eagles tomorrow
this is an especially serious game let us remember what happened at the last matchup a complete disgrace for us eagles ran the game from start to finish that memory gets erased here with a blowout win

i see you slimmed him down for the photo very flattering
i know its a few years removed but this gives me the creeps anyone else
2020puffs cigarwhat a year its been
imagine explaining this to someone in 2015
bert from sesame street will be handing the ball to oscar the grouch
just three years ago they were fighting for the division against each other 3 years
is joe flacco an elite quarterback

frankly i think it is hilarious
what even is this year
elite handoff am i right
im new i dont understand


fourtime super bowl champion randy grossman
the rabbi was a definite favorite from the steeler dynasty

no finer head of hair has ever graced the inside of a football helmet
reminds me of when i almost bought an ab jersey a few years ago and the store i go to didnt have it in stock they claimed they interstore transferred it but it never came in

lucky for me since he had his meltdown shortly thereafter and it all went to hell lol

saved by the miscue
how did you do that i want to do that to mine lol still have my ab jersey sitting around
grossman had some clutch third down catches in sb 13 to keep drives alive that ended up going for scores great hands tough underrated
he was one of my favorites growing up had some big catches and could block too
its off center and i cant unsee it
can someone explain to me why you cant just buy the numbers yourself wtf nfl

my favorite defensive player to watch probably in steelers history dude is relentless
me and tj have the same birthday

til
i think that means were getting at least 3 birthday sacks
does anyone else hate it when they see its these dudes birthdays like bro can you stay 23 forever please
watt will have 3 sacks today
i saw a news article that tj is not playing because hes injured thats not true correct
its his birthday and he gets to be paid to hit wentz all day

lucky
we share a birthday
eagles fan coming in peace to wish one of the best current players on defense today and happy birthday and hope he doesnt kill carson if hes lined up on mailata god bless his soul

hoping for a great game today steel bros
i hope he for his bday and mine murders some eagles qbs figuratively of course

edit apparently its a bunch of others birthdays as well good times
hope he gets a pick six or a sack
birthday boy with the sack
nice one sacks per quarter would be appropriate
all the eagles ol out there giving him birthday hugs how sweet

it hurts me to my core that the nfl punished players as hard as the federal government for the horrible crime of gasp smoking reefer

no much better to keep them pumped full of pharmaceuticals so they dont notice their brains being completely hammered into putty until they cant think straight in their 60s
he always reminded me of randy moss his acceleration and top speed for being that tall was insane

im sorta surprised now that pot is legal in nfl he has not signed anywhere
so sad but at least steelers always draft good receivers
claypool has the potential to be bryant and better i hurt for bryant i really do but lets be thankful and hopeful with what we do have
he could have been a hofer so much god given talent
he was the definition of playmaker
dude was a touchdown machine
we got claypool
dont worry we have claypool now
if this country ever decides to take mental health seriously and legalize cannabis this man would have never had an issue dak prescott was incredibly brave to come out about it which is why his injury today was extra brutal bryant deserved better and some guys just cant stay out of their own way because they are either incapable or dont have the support around them to make it happen bryants failings are a product of society just as much as they are a product of his own poor choices josh gordon is another example
dont do drugs kids
there was some talk a week or so ago on this site about claypool being a reminder of bryant only better first quarter today certainly drives that home
he actually did what dionte tries to do
he was a goddamn football player
he was so freaky athletic amazing athlete absolutely amazing
would you rather

a make history in pittsburgh turn your name into a legend make millions if not 100s of millions of dollars have just about any woman in the world

b smoke a ton of weed
who is that and why are we sar
i think he is missing a 1 on his jersey isnt his name mapletron
i forgot he existed to be honest between bens injury bell and brown leaving and bryant ive been kind of disengaged watt and claypool bringing me back in tho
the rules suck but seriously you give me that kind of money and the only thing i have to do is not smoke easy choice
hey guys i think we found a suitable replacement
i watched that 3 times before realizing i was watching it loop and i was not upset
very reminiscent of ahem chase claypool
chase claypool is everything martavis bryant should have been
hes a free agent
could have been great it really is heart breaking that he never was able to get his demons under control
tomlins arrogance is to blame years of having a top tier squad and nothing to show for it but postseason disappointments and historical ownage by the patriots
mike tomlin and wasting talent name a better duo
fuck him chose himself over his team

love the argument of he was struggling with addiction but weed isnt addictive

want to smoke weed play by the rules lobby to change the rules but play by the rules
complete straightline route runner also not that great hands even some of those catches he looks awkward trying to catch it over his shoulders his rookie year was the aberration respect for the production he did give us though

thanks for posting this i miss home pa im watching from florida its been on n off raining here today here we go


do you mind answering a couple questions from a season ticket holder who opted out this year

how did you get picked for the tickets
was the resale value crazy high because there were only 5000
how was the atmosphere was it similar to a wpial championship if youve ever been
how did they decide where you had to sit i assume they werent you normal seats

im sure it was a surreal experience but awesome also


you married your daughter is that legal
she must be really small to fit up there

i know hes a beast after the catch but shouldnt we be protecting him by putting mccloud out there
did he get injured on that last return

and yeah idk
dj does punts rayray does kos been that way since game 1

looks like pnc park during a normal pirate game

totally meant heinz field but my father sent me this from one of his old fraternity brothers at the game i would honestly love to go to a game like this
im just happy to see people back in there tbh i would love to get my hands on some tickets but they are probably so fuckin expensive
were there a lot of people or was it crowded i wanted to go but was kind of concerned
looks like any pitt game on saturdays
it wouldnt be surreal to see firstenergy stadium like this
removed



bookmark this nflbitecom
the shots of heinz field with covidlimited attendance reminds me of normal bungles games ive seen

i hope they stay amazing after this game
eagles are really good
no local stations broadcast the games here anyone have any ideas

to be fair the steelers have been getting some help from the stripes to this point
wow
these refs have been terrible making bad calls against both teams but i agree most but not all of there bad calls have gone against the steelers


hes a very small guy and nfl football is a violent game hes got his shiftiness to help avoid hits but he isnt a burner either so defenders can line up their shots wo fear of being out run gotta assume hes always going to be battling injuries andor hes going start wussing out of contact even more than he does now leaving meat on the bone on plays
insult to injury
somehow i havent seen this meme before and i love it
started him over claypool hes legit cost me two fantasy wins oh well i hope this isnt a pattern thats developing

so when does juju start picking fights with ben freezing his feet and complaining about his football helmet
hey ill take a td however we can get it my fantasy team is hurtin tho come on juju
juju plays team ball i think hell be fine

and again
and again
i fucking love this meme format so this made me audibly laugh hysterically
so much yes
and his third
im fucking convinced the universe is always listening i was completely unaware of this video until someone at work brought it up today as well as unaware of the turnout of the game for you to post this is just too much of a weird coincidence for me right now lol
kinda looks like him

you spelled goat wrong
steal of the draft

ben loves his big receivers and so do i
nut


that was quick take my upvote
congratulations that was fast lol
this announcing crew is one of the worst in awhile
james franco harris lmaooo
what about steelers oc andy richter
a legend nobody knew existed until today
vilma is probably the worst announcer ever
it took all of vilmas 3 remaining brain cells to realize how badly he fucked that up
i like when he said wentz was looking for wentz down field
that was somehow not even in the top 5 most awkward flubs that came out of vilmas mouth today
that was such an awkward moment lol why did he even think thatd be funny
it was so awkward wouldnt have been if they had just dropped it lol
james franco is it true you guys are starved for a new thing to hate

raiders yes

james franco then why dont you feed them
i dont get it
fulgram is tearing this eagles defense apart vilma

fulgram went undrafted drafted by the detroit lions vilma

oh and the idiot vilma called darius slay derrick slay twice
cant stop giggling
thats a wonderful photoshop job my dude
yinz break yinz break forevaaaaa
the mistake wasnt that bad anybody could let that slip it was the cringe worthy recovery that hurt
strawberries
lmao
cant even think about franco with dirty heads popping into my head
a true hall of famer
well that didnt take long lol
vilma was giving some interesting commentary
awesome
heartbeat its a lovebeat
vilma was a nightmare to listen to his attempts at being funny were horrible just stick to calling the game
vilma did an amazing job calling the saints game last week this steelers game not so much sadly
i thought that blunder was funny but how about the black announcer saying he loved eddie van halen and van halens music now i understand there are many black people who love rock n roll metal and eddie van halen but not that guy suspect at best

i didnt even know points went up this high
means nothing if they cant hold the lead need defense to step up
i know it hardly matters but it was getting a little annoying hearing it on the radio
nah now theyll just frame it and say theyve only scored 30 pts once in 23 games
gotta get that opening drive touchdown next week and shut people up about that
winning shootouts count double in the standings
removed
it always seems to me that refs try to keep a lot of the games close
the pi calls have been terrible for both sides so far in this game

theres a game on
going to be a no for me
no dont be surprised if they resign him hes already said hes not chasing money and has seen the whole grass isnt always greener effect happen to multiple guys
what do you think is going to happen after this game now that claypool had a breakout game and juju did relatively nothing what do you think is going to happen when claypool starts to draw double coverage

you need two good receivers lets keep him on the roster and use him while we can
no
boo this man
no
no
pay him for the right price plain and simple if some team wants to overpay the shit out of him let them
juju will resign for 15 million a year steelers trade james washington for a 3rd round pick in the off season
no really really bad take you need multiple deep fast threats you saw what happened when juju was without ab the first year and didnt have ben to help shoulder that responsibility

x200b

you get rid of juju ben retires in 2 years youre fucked
first downvote of the week youre welcome
no not unless he demands absurd money hopefully he wont but if its anything remotely reasonable we have no reason to get rid of him hes an excellent wide receiver and depth is what you need to win
absolutely not we are all in on winning this year so it would make no sense unless we got a good player in return but theyd need to learn the playbook and everything besides juju is still making an impact and wed lose insurance incase we caught the injury bug at wr
haha haha no

you do realize we get a comp 3rd round pick for juju his services this year are well worth waiting one year for that pick

if we traded juju in season it would need to be for a 1st round pick

we might even be able to trade him after the year on the franchise tag for a pick

im not even saying we need him this year but even as depth hes worth more than a third

maybe some words bc im lost




too bad they played like shit today but hey a wins a win
a pick that should have been a batdown

4th down and they catch it gave the eagles 50 yards or something
missing the birthday boy that caused the pick
minkah needs to be traded immediately

i still remember steelers nation getting angry over that pick
sounds like he is the only non running back to ever do it
some so who were the rest
not a bad group to be associated with to put it mildly

chase claypool
can we get a wellness check on that guy that benched claypool today
dear chase i feel like i can call you chase because you and me are so alike id like to meet you one day it would be great to have a catch i know i cant throw as fast as you but i think youd be impressed with my speed i love your hair you run fast did you have a good relationship with your father me neither these are all things we can talk about and more i know you have not been getting my letters because i know you would write back if you did i hope you write back this time and we can become good friends i am sure our relationship would be a real home run
if you ever feel stupid just know doug pederson tried a 57 yard field goal at heinz field
folgers fullgham who the fuck is that this was far too close but lord almighty we got the dub lets get into it

good

ben roethlisberger hes a gamer man theres no way around it he redirected chase on his 4th td right up the middle holy christ its good to have the kind back

mapletron welcome to nfl eh what a game a bullshit opi is what ruined the ultimate day but wow he came to play such a weapon a big bodied dude thats tough to defend we got a good one

pre snap motion its just a different offense than anything weve seen even putting claypool in motion draws enough attention we heard so much about the influence of matt canada and we can see that now lots of movement

an offense that converts points off tos is such a refreshing change of pace from last year getting 7 of steves int is what helps out so much we missed that last year shoutout to big fucking ben

bad

third down defense jfc where to begin we could not get off the field to save our life man have got to do better here thats the only reason this game was so damn close seems like the longer the down and distance the easier it got so frustrating

refs again pure garbage on both sides this was as bad as ive seen them man

wasnt the prettiest but raise your hand if youre 40 bitches ill take the wins any which way we can get them no easy wins in this league fuck you fulgham

claypool folgers coffee bitch ass wr

who ride
the last time the steelers opened 40

the pirates won the world series
ill take the heart attack every week if we keep winning
chase claypool is my dad
chase claypool just schlonged their secondary
40 baby
claypool with 4 tds but spiritually 5 because the refs stole one from him future hof
the fact that claypool looked that good even when facing slay is really promising we got a special one right there
alright straight up fuck these refs
my god that was pathetic officiating for both sides smfh

so injuries idk about yall but its very concerning to me seeing ben grabbing his arm hes doing the same thing as early in the season last year

dionte has to be smarter with his plays the guy has the talent but he fucks up a bit too much keep him away from returns too mccloud is doing better and i dont want dionte getting injured which keeps happening unfortunately

decastro got injured again too and while that fucking sucks too im at least content that our depth seems ok to handle it dotson is capable


defense was all over the place and our secondary was getting torched by fulgham as always we never seem to coast on games ever lol smh last time i felt we coasted was 2018 against the panthers so like steelers could you please fucking stop with the coasting

alright positives and i only want to talk about one


chase fucking claypool

mapletron the god


he is a monster my goodness utterly dominant
can someone let the officials know that their face masks arent meant to cover their eyes too

anyway take the w and go 40
claypool with 4 tds as a rookie despite a phantom opi call steelers with a 40 start for the first time in 40 years crack a yuengling and crank renegade
perhaps it is now time for the torch of pennsylvania to be passed to philadelphia for wentz to take up the mantle of quarterback of the keystone state

tuitt sack

then again perhaps not
claypool is a stud our secondary needs a lot of work those 3rd and longs were dangerous
chase claypool was so good that even the refs were impressed
the reality is the defense has not begun to tap their potential we got glimpses of it in the second half of the texans game we will need to develop into that type of defense consistently to contend for a title

we should be excited that the offense is breaking out it isnt complete yet but its getting better

on one hand this is the least impressive 40 team ive ever seen but they have a tremendous ceiling

remember in previous years we play like this and start 22 and those two losses come into play late in the year for playoff seeding

look at how many times the patriots started slow and clunky but were undefeated or only had one loss somewhere around the halfway point and had a huge advantage for seeding they found ways to win those games thats us this year hopefully winning even while we are not hitting on all cylinders setting ourselves up for something bigger later in the year when every win will absolutely matter for seeding
best rookie wr ever
lets worry about the defense tomorrow

todays all about chase fucking claypool
holy fuck
eagles were a legit team i know their record doesnt show it but their defense is absolutely nothing to fuck around with im upset with our secondary but other than that i dont have a ton to complain about at the end of the day a win is a win
the eagles are in dismaypool
worst officiating ive ever seen but a dub is a dub
gotta catch a quick nap before work but game was closer than it should have been refs did an awful job for both teams but we also had a bunch of dumb calls on our part putting haden on fulgam happened way too late in the game and we sacrificed the secondary far too much to bring pressure on a quarterback who could get it out quickly and easily thanks to poor coverage

still a win is a win and claypool showed up big time this week onto the browns unless the covid19 gods decide to smite our week 6 broke 30 points this week boys

ill smoke my victory preroll after work to get a really good sleep after my first overnight shift
fuck the refs fuck the flyers and fuck philadelphia in general west pa best pa
chase mother fucking claypool
lol do you think claypool ran out of td celebrations
raiders just beat kc
on the brightside sanders broke off that 74 yd run ended up with 80 total and 94 as a team
jerry rice wears chase claypool pajamas to bed
i love the delusion over in the eagles sub they think the refs handed us the game when it was trash calls that benefited both teams
defense had an off day and the offense stepped up and bailed them out love it
post the ref picture with the trash can on fire
stat sheet says 4 td but i saw him in the end zone 5 times

letting one wr score that many times is a serious problem youd think after the 2nd td they would try to lock that shit down pretty embarrassing for jim schwartz
the nfl has obviously tweaked how the rules are being interpreted by the referees to benefit the offense so there is more scoring they pretty much quit calling holding at all and theyve increased the pass interference calls on defense this is in addition to their usual calling the games in order to keep the score close to make the league appear more competitive than it actually is bottom line is the nfl is very poorly run and designed with greed as the number one goal instead of making sure the games are called fairly if that game was called fairly then the steelers would have won by at least two touchdowns but the league doesnt like that scoreline they attract more viewers and make more money with close games
word is that chase claypool is being examined for a strain in his back from carrying that entire fucking game
that was a great game until it wasnt and then it was again ggs boys now lets flush the browns
well it was ugly but the offense won a game for what feels like the first time in a long time
our defense had some lapses but the main reason that game was even that close was the refs and their total shit calls they took at least 2 tds away from us for bs calls they were atrocious and if im tomlin im calling them out post game
refs were fucking terrible and they can go fuck themselves but our secondary has to play better the game threads make the secondary seem much worse than it is but theres definitely been regression
sanders had a 74 yard run in the first quarter he ended the game with 80 yards rushing
the pittsburgh heart palpitations
chase claypool dad dicked the iggles long hard
mapletron is born
chase claypool can fuck my wife
me thats the scariest movie ill watch all october

week 6 steelers hold my beer
ben was solid chase claypool is my new bff defense looked asleep at times not sure if that is partly due to coming off the unexpected bye week but at least they looked good on that last eagles possession thank god this wasnt a really good team or else they would have taken our lunch money today gonna be a long stretch from here on out but if we stay healthy and come to play i believe in this squad
this was one of those games that was bound to happen and will happen again the defense cant win andor close out every game really happy to see the offense can step up and close things out when they need to
the best part of this game was juju and james washington going all in on the sticky ball celebration carrying it all the way back to the side line
we have the best pass rush in the league not doubt but what the fuck happened to our secondary
we gonna talk about terrell edmunds being the best player in the secondary today or is the steelers reddit not ready to have that conversation yet
lets go boys maple syrup on me
if you dont like that you dont like steelers football
only thing that matters is 40 boys
wentz isnt a bad qb so im not surprised he got back on track just didnt expect it would be against us
an ugly win is still better than a close loss lfg
this was the most anxiety inducing game because all of my friends are eagles fans

today is a good day
game down to the final few minutes blown 3rd down plays on defense win by 2 points

classic steelers football wins a win and im happy with that
i hope johnson is okay
we have to keep juju for claypool if that makes sense its a good 1 2 punch
going into the season i knew chase was tall and fast but after watching the first game and seeing his body control on the sideline catch i knew he was going to be special he has the best body control ive seen since ab in his prime he could have easily had a 5th touchdown today
chase claypool
claypool best wr in his draft class change my mind
need a chase claypool up vote party
never in doubt bois
my heart cant take anymore
on 10112020 chase big dick energy claypool hung 4 tds on the philadelphia eagles making the first recorded stunt on these hoes in the 2020 season
fuck the refs
40 for the first time in 41 years
this is the beginning of the chase claypool for oroy campaign
claypool went off great game for the rookie
petition for pittsburgh to secede from the us and selfannex to canada
member how we usually lose to bad teams im glad this didnt happen
well never get it but the nfl needs to address the officiating in this game piss poor
i wonder how many years of my life ive lost being a steelers fan
yay we won fuck the refs
claypool is a beast and probably our new 1 in my eyes


ben played great and had 0 interceptions


defense didnt get any pressure

ebron needs to clean it tf up with the drops hes a te though

and obviously

fuck the refs
overall nice win although there was a point i thought we were going to lose the gimme game

nice to be 40 although we havent played the ravens yet

claypool is great idk how the steelers can always find these wr deep in draft

the refs were absolutely awful i feel like there were so many penalties
4 and mf 0 25 perfect gotta love it not easy to win games in this league but its easier with big ben keep flying under the radar of the rest of the afc i like it
i wonder how much travis fulgham going off had to do with zach ertz catching 1 pass for 6 yards
5 sacks 21 qb hits best steelers front 7 since 2010
my opponent started claypool this week pray for me
without a doubt the defense needs to play better putting teams in 3rd and long is supposed to be a good thing for the defense but we can never execute in those situations i hope butler or tomlin starts to address this shit but idk

ben and mapletron carried this fucking offense today both solid performances im so damn happy about claypool and that we have him on our team hes going to be great and i cant wait to watch his career
im happy ben is playing so well and chase was amazing but our defense is scaring me a bit
once just once i would like us to put away a team by the end of the third quarter so i can unclench my fist before the game is over

i know im asking for a lot but my heart aint getting any younger
some of the steeler fans on twitter are so insufferable people like mark madden and company will go to any lengths to trash the steelers regardless of success its almost like these people arent fans at all do we have some work to do on the back end of the secondary absolutely its early in the season every team has things to work on its like if this team isnt absolutely perfect every sunday they complain regardless of outcome and then trash the fans that are actually excited about the win and the great game some of our players had
40 bitches
lfg
did vilma watch the game we really couldnt run the ball worth a shit
mapletron good
40 just need dj to stop breaking himself and our receiver corps is gonna be unstoppable
welcome to the al bundy club chase claypool
this game gave me a killer headache wtf is wrong with this defense
this was the first game where the defense let us down and ben had to step up and win it
happy cake day tj
now lets watch the raiders trying to win and the browns game
if the raiders make this first kc loses
mother fucking chase claypool league is on notice now
what the fuck happened in the chiefs game
west side best side that is all
i love this team but watching them play is stressful as hell itd be nice to have a few games thatre guaranteed wins
this claypool guy might be good at football
my friend cowboys fan hasnt seen if of our games just asked me is we could go undefeated this year had to do a spit take
guys i dont want to overreact but were going to win the next 3 superbowls
watching this from over in melbourne and stayed awake until 4am for it claypools effort made it all worth may just stay awake to watch the other games now im that amped
i never thought i wouldnt see days of our steelers in my inbox by week 5
wonder what was said to juju to get him so upset when he was on the ground
since we won i can say this it was kinda nice for the hometown guy to score even if he was playing for the enemy
i feel like the offense bailed out the defense today

hard fought game great w
you cant guard chase claypool the secret service couldnt guard chase claypool
some of yall are so fucking cancerous in the game threads man
yall gotta realize that the refs kept the eagles in that game eagles are tough but every team plays the steelers like its their super bowl the steelers weathered the storm and kept pushing forward the biggest takeaway from this game is that the refs need to be reviewed weekly and evaluated and penalized for terrible calls
nothing is as miserable as the game threads guys people are going to score against us people are going to make bad plays refs are going to mess up calls please stop overreacting to everything when we let up a td there is at least 10 comments saying the steelers are going to lose the rest of the season relax people
i will stop saying clay chasepool i promise
dak prescott just had one of the worst ankle breaks ive ever seen
of course the week i drop claypool due to lack of usage he pops off for 4tds and johnson gets hurt again
steven nelson and minkah seem like they are regressing in year 2 with pittsburgh almost like they had good talent last year and then they realized they are on the steelers and our secondary is a sieve half the time minkah especially where is his aggressiveness he had last year our scheme has him just sitting in zone
we want myles garrett
that was almost terrible
not a great win but we take em where we can get em 40 is huge lets hope they figure out why wentz was able to move the ball so easily hope some of you guys can chill and enjoy the entertainment we wont go undefeated just so yall cant maybe have better expectations
we are on our wayyyy here we go
that was a butt clencher
offense needs to be more aggressive defense needs coaching
i missed the second half can someone summarise in 10 words or less or as a haiku poem cheers

also im on my phone with shit signal so i cant check stats what did claypool finish on
claypool is my first childs name now
i love crunching out these wins
i missed seeing the td pass to pouncey
watts injury really affected the secondary without him firing on all cylinders were an above average unit with watt were top tier hope he can heal up
beautiful w although im concerned about bens deep ball hes been overthrowing everyone this year
he could id give him 4 years
chase is ab plax
was hargrave in this game i remember he signed with the eagles did he do anything in this game he said he wanted to sack ben lol
i couldnt watch the game how were the refs terrible
big ben is quietly having a great season 10td to 1int and 7 in the nfl hes played 1 less game than most other qb on the list past years i feel hes thrown more ints
great sunday for us

now im wondering who had it worst today 9ers vikings or cowboys fans im leaning towards cowboys i wish dak a speedy recovery
is it just me or is it a guarantee that we blitz when hilton and edmunds both line up over the slot seems way too predictable
gotta tighten up that 3rd down defense bigtime this team has given up so many 3rd and extra longs its gonna lead me to an early grave

they blitz on 1st and 2nd downs getting them to the 3rd and longs then come 3rd down the dont blitz and they drop into a soft zone the pass rush doesnt get there in time and theres always someone wide the fuck open

this team is built to play man defense i know why theyre doing it when you play man all defenders backs are to the qb who can then take off and run theyve played a bunch of qbs capable of a decent run

but to treat the likes of carson wentz like hes god damn lamar jackson is ridiculous blitz on 3rd downs play man on man get off the fucking field
finally home after my first shift and gonna smoke that victory preroll cheers
i love that we won and im glad to know we have a new stud wr however im pissed at myself for benching him in all my fantasy leagues
im tired of clenching my butt but im not tired of winning
missed the end of the game last night due to family obligationscanadian thanksgiving did watt come back in the game is the injury serious or will he play next week
if the second half of the texans game gave me confidence in our defense this game did the opposite we have the talent to win the superbowl but we are being held back by two subpar coordinators
what a wild 180 from defensive to offensive powerhouse why cant we just have both in one game whatever a dubs a dub lmao
i say it every week this team takes years off my life
i dont get why people are so mad when people point out that minkah is regressing

he was a dpoy candidate last year and looked like the best safety in the damn game he looks nothing like that this year it doesnt mean hes not good anymore but hes definitely not that so far
cowboys fan here in peace why the fuck was yall safety ejected after just one helmet to helmet hit there was no ejection called by the refs i learned from the dude who announces the red zone channel and was like what the hell
damn fullcum really destroyed our secondary today also most of those pi calls were absolute bs and ruined my enjoyment of the game wentz sucks ass i was hoping they would keep hurts in the game but holy fuck mapletron is good im really happy for him today my dad is an eagles fan so ive been texting him shit all day
can we get a new offensive coordinator his play calling is painfully obvious thank goodness ben is playing like an all pro
in the battle of pa the fascists lose well done boys fuck the refs fuck fascism
juju thanks for everything but i think claypool will make you expendable heading into next year
nfc least is so bad why do i even hope the eagles could beat yall ravens will of course win this division but i really wish it didnt have to be this way sweeping the division in order to win the division is distasteful to say the least it really looking it will have to be the ravens to set yall selves straight
great start to the season the team looks really good and mostly complete things are looking really up
als can go f itself hopefully there is a cure after the ice bucket challenges

oh and hes got the jokes as well
chase claypool holy shit
death taxes and the steelers finding really good under the radar wrs
seeing big ben peak too his left before claypools 4th td like did these fuckers just put a linebacker on this grown man
gaaaaaahhhdddd thats badass
he caught 7 of 11 targets too
stop stop my penis can only get so erect
i love to say i told you so rsteelers i remember a post about 2 months ago asking what his realistic expectations are and i was the only one seriously giving him wr2 level stats this guy is a stud and is the type of sure hands goupandgetit wr we havent had since hines ward retired
this is the way
take my up vote well done shamelessly stealing this
welp unzips
i really dont get it how the hell the steelers always get some top wr through draft

from hines ward to antonio brown to juju and now chase claypool

meanwhile my teamcolts cant draft a good wr even if irsays life depended on it
they got free wifi too
4 tds
no offense but711 is called that cuz its only open from 7am to 11pm not always

its really too bad those 20195 receivers were a complete bust
damn its a shame that we had to wait so long for a gem before we drafted dionte in 2019 the last great one was james washington all the way back in 2018 and juju in 2017
limas sweed xx
as is tradition
you guys remember running on the opponents 40 yard line down by 9 with 3 minutes left after a huge turnover i miss the 90s
and juju b4 that
i havent seen a game like that since the 1966 chicago city championship where polk high beat andrew johnson high and old sparetire got run over
this is the way
sorry

said absolutely fucking nobody

bonus i forgot we actually signed ed oneill as an udfa in 1969

5 weeks into the season now and minkah fitzpatrick has been all but a complete ghost his only notable play today was once again not wrapping up and bouncing off of a receiver like he did with jerry jeudy in the denver game

minkah has not made any notable splash play or impact since the beginning of the 2nd half of last season

the excuse was always well quarterbacks dont target him but as we saw today that doesnt work anymore he literally stood in the end zone and watched a touchdown 5 feet from him

i never see him playing deep thought that was his main job and have never seen him so much as break up a pass or save a first down

is he being schemed out of the game by every single teams offensive coordinator are we simply not using him right anymore

he is the only top tier safety in the nfl without a single notable play this season so far

what do you guys think
hes been targeted like 5 times this entire season thats what you wanna hear from a game changing safety
that td in the endzone he was lined up on the other side of the formation no way that was his responsibility you all are fucking crazy if you think someones who only notable play is missing a tackle do you fuckers remember mike mitchell and artie burns like just because hes not getting picks doesnt mean hes playing bad
no no we dont need to talk about him every player is going to have plays where you can complain about them minkah has rarely made those dudes a great player
hes been fine
theres obviously no excuse for a missed tackle but otherwise its just a result of scheme nearly every snap minkah is single high with edmunds in the box minkah drifts to one side and the ball pretty much never goes that way what else can he do
he never gets targeted teams are smart after a great season last year theyre finding ways to avoid him its annoying seeing somebody miss an easy tackle and i wish he could ballhawk more but hes not getting the opportunities pay close attention when our defense is on the field try to count how many times opposing qbs throw into minkahs coverage it hardly happens they target edmunds and the outside corners without fail but usually stray away from minkahs zone

edit just to clarify some of my wording opposing qbs definitely fail plenty when targeting our corners i just meant thats usually who theyre targeting not minkah
hes basically eliminated the ability to throw to whatever part of the field he is on when qbs arent throwing the ball into the part of the field youre defending its really fucking hard to make a splash play
so you want him to make plays when the ball is almost never throw to him or around him

x200b

please learn to watch the game this topic comes up near daily here and its always the same answer you just dont want to hear it apparently
if you havent watched the all22 which idk if it is even out then shut up
dude td are going to happen no defense is perfect we are 40 not sure why youre bitching
do you notice that he is nowhere near the ball on nearly every passing play might be a reason for that
ok so lets just cut him then since hes so trash
he was a lot more free last season

the biggest play happened because the darling of this sun couldnt tackle
minkah has be beat on a deep ball what once this season sorry the safeties job is to defend the deep ball right
after further conclusion minkah says youre wrong
be careful he might ask for a trade

not just the cornerbacks but the safeties and linebackers too
hello there
this meme could also work with fulgham and our defense

claypool emerging will hopefully just get juju open more theres no doubt in my mind ben trusts jujus hands more than anyone else
another receiver having a big game will likely be a net positive for juju because it will result in fewer double covers for him
man i really dont want to lose juju but weve got 4 really good receivers now and you cant keep everyone
the tide is rising
the way i see it claypool is proving himself to be wr1 material which will allow the front office to cut juju next season especially since we need to keep minkah and tj


baby terminator

how lucky are we to have an organization thats only had 3 head coaches since the 60s
we have the best coach

i still honestly have no idea how good the steelers actually are
yay were 4 and 0 people in pittsburghfire tomlin
our front 7 is stellar our secondary is in question with our run defense being so good i think it will help us with the ravens but we need haden minkah and nelson to return to their form from last year nelson had two picks today but hes been getting burned way more often than last year
were better than the titans and seahawks
scared my dog when i cursed out the refs on tv on that bulls hit call on claypool
its hard to judge anything about the defense when pass interference is determined by a random number generator and olineman literally tackling tj watt on almost every play is 100 legal
this is a solid team takes a bit to get going when the qb was out for a year and you get an unexpected week off while rolling strong with a 3 game win streak
we do usually come off the bye looking shaky and shitty eagles teams have pulled a w out against us in the past so ill take this ugly as it was
they dont ask how they ask how many 40 is 40 enjoy it
i dont worry about the fact that our wins are against bad teams the way this team works under tomlin we will struggle big time against a team that should be an easy w and oftentimes lose it then the next week we play one of the best teams in the league and beat them so to me you cant judge us based on our competition too much at the end of the day were 40 and i have a lot of confidence in our defense to stop anybody and i think our offense is just going to get better and better every week

steelers secondary have you ever heard of travis fulgham

nfl no

steelers secondary would you like to


my poor dog hides from me during the game i get a little emotional lol

ed oneil the actor that played al bundy actually played for the steelers for one training camp
its all i could think of

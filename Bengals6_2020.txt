"Simply put, both are playing (or played in John’s case) poorly but I think AJ gives us the best chance to win. I think there’s a better chance that AJ figures his shit out or works through whatever he’s got going on than John does at learning how to catch and love himself."
This take is really really stupid. Just enjoy the win mate.
"Is Ross really a deep threat if he only catches perfect throws that land on his hands?  I agree with many of your points, but I just think Ross has had 2 years to figure it out, but just can’t."
Tee is a better deep threat than Ross.  Ross needs to develop better ball skills before he's helping the team on anything beyond a slant
""
"A couple years ago I had started doing these weekly.  It's purely PFF data, but graphically represented since it's easier than looking thru all of the various players.

I changed it a bit this year to have linemen as rectangles, the next level as rounded rectangles (TE & LB), outside players (WR, RB, CB, S) as ovals, and QB as a circle.

**Take-aways right now:** these all align with what I've seen watching games, but reinforced with this information.

* Carlos Dunlap is really sliding this year. 
* We *really* need Geno Atkins back as that would probably lift Dunlap, Hubbard and Lawson
* Our LB are only serviceable. 
* Trae Waynes was a needed piece as we don't have much at outside CB outside of WJ3.
* The line isn't good, but is better than last year. We really need guards.
* A.J. Green is not right. He can't separate, has no burst, and isn't a difference maker."
Very intrigued to see what happens when Sua-Filo gets back and potentially Waynes.
And this is why we drafted Tee Higgins unfortunately Father Time is coming for Green
Tyler Boyd is popping off this year for sure
"Should be added that Jesse Bates III is ranked the #1 Safety in the league.  Boyd is the ~~#4 WR~~ **#3 WR!!**, and Burrow is currently the #9 QB.

EDIT:  Scratch Boyd, as of this morning he is the #3 WR!!"
I like this format a lot. Nice work.
AJ you’re breaking my heart :(
Bobby Hart Greened up and quietly doing an average job???
The secondary tho....
Great job on this. I like the visuals.
"I don’t have the breakdowns but my eyes are telling me Boyd and Burrow got something special going on, AJ looks slow, and the lack of pressure by Dunlap and Hubbard is disappointing."
"100% expected Bobby Hart to be the worst starting lineman, but I guess Michael Jordan is only the GOAT in basketball 🏀"
"Man, every time I see AJ miss a catch or come up slow after what used to be a typical play for him I get legitimately sad. I hope he can get back to form in some way."
Markus Bailey and ADG... not great
"First impressions are, and I will say we are only a quarter a way through the season after an unprecedented and unusual offseason so these thoughts are subject to change (except the first one):

1) Reader is a great addition. Can’t wait to see what he does next to Geno. 
2) I have said this before that I hope we keep AJ at a *significantly* reduced rate next year as a fourth receiver, but mostly to continue his mentoring for Tee, Auden and any draftees in 2021 (Ja’Marr Chase, an unnecessary pick but worth dreaming about🤤). He is no longer the AJ we all love and remember. 
3) Ross should never touch the field unless injuries are a factor. He takes away opportunities from Auden, Williams and Higgins...you know players who are actually contributing and will be the future of the franchise. 
4) I drool and get giddy when I see Auden, Higgins and Boyd on that field. Boyd’s route running and hands, Auden’s and Higgins’ size and body control, PLUS chemistry with Burrow will be scary good. 
5)In what is his redshirt rookie season and after going up against some tough competition, Jonah is going to be a good (perhaps really good?) tackle. Depending how the 2021 draft/free agency plays out our offensive line may become serviceable or, dare I say it, *good*?!
6) Our young linebackers are playing like they are young and without the benefit of a preseason. I hope that is the explanation. Enough said. 
7) What I thought, and I suspect most of us thought as well, would be a distinct strength, our defensive ends generating a pass rush, has been a huge disappointment. Is it the lack of Geno and his generational level talent or something more? Employee96’s age, Lawson still not the same after his injury, Hubbard has hit his ceiling or a combination of factors? ...*cough* poor coaching? *cough* I think this has had more impact on our defense’s poor performance than anything else.
8) WJ3. Hmmmm, depending on where we are in the draft we may have some good options to replace you, which is an option if we have a good enough record that the top linemen are off the board. Are you good enough to sign long term and we still stick with BPA on the line or do you make us consider a Surtain II, a player I absolutely love?
9) Bates, I love you! I would have your babies except I don’t have a uterus, but my love for you is so strong I would like to find a way. We need to resign you now! Reader in the trenches, you in the backfield, now all we need is a roaming missle in the middle and we have a frightening core to our defense. 

Finally, thank you for doing these! Great for us fans who want to see some analytics made easy for us. Truly appreciated."
"Forgive me for this question as I don’t understand how PFF is tallied, but how is Joe Mixon only a 67.7? The dude went completely off the rails from a stats perspective."
Father time has come for basically all of our Lewis/Dalton/Green era players. I am not overly confident that Geno is going to come back and be a game-changer in the middle. Our poor drafting is really showing its face now.
"We are in the tineline where Bobby Hart is a better than AJ Green.

*Shudders*"
"Things are pretty interesting at WR. Back in 2015 when we had a strong receiving core we designed it like a Swiss-Army-Knife with a secondary emphasis on talent matchups. Marvin Jones (Speed/DeepBalls and #2), Mohammed Sanu (Slot, #3), AJ Green (Do-It-All Elite, #1), Brandon Tate and Gio (Mismatch/Burn a LB, #4). 

They all had different roles to play and usually couldn't defeat a corner of a higher status. Mohammed Sanu was usually not going to win vs CHJ, Talib, Adam Jones, Gilmore, Sherm, etc.

In 2014 we had the same guys but because AJ and Marvin Jones were injured (think back to the playoff game v Indy) Mo Sanu was vsing #1s and getting blanketed. But with everyone back in '15, he could play his role and beat up on people at his level.


It seemed like we were trying to do that again with Boyd and Ross draft picks. Possibly because that's what we saw success with OR because that's what Andy Dalton and Marvin Lewis liked.

Boyd worked out, Ross didn't. AJ got hurt, Boyd had to go against Gilmore(who would have locked up AJ)... 0 catches.


Then we get Zach Taylor AND Joe Burrow. Here is where we see the switch is ideology. Zach looks at the QB he just drafted and looks at what that franchise QB is comfortable with. He also looks at the play-action Run Pass system he wants to run. He looks at what's on the uptrend in his locker room before the draft (Auden Tate, Boyd, maybe AJ, Mike Thomas) and says Big Body WRs. We are doing jump balls, backshoulders, box out passes, Over routes, etc.

Where '15 Cincy had Wrs with different builds for different roles, '20 beyond Cincy will have a beast in the slot and multiple BIG BODY WRs who will make contested passes 70-30 balls.

Kinda cool seeing this change happening."
"Feels like a more substantial grade disparity between Mixon & Bernard, even though Gio’s had some tough runs so far. My patience with AJ is waning, but I can’t believe he’s regressed as much as these 4 games have shown."
"As much as it sucks to say, we shouldn't resign Green at the end of the year. He's a complete shadow of what he once was and is getting outplayed by a rookie. If he were pulling double coverages every snap it'd be different, but he's not even worth pulling the #1 DB to cover him. Maybe translate his money into two young WRs to grow with Burrow. I'm sure Green's leadership is great right now, but that's all he is offering."
It looks like we still need to improve our LB core. It’s a bummer that none of the rookies are really showing that they belong yet.
"I hope I’m welcome here. Really do love the visual representation and would love to know how easy it to replicate to other teams as I’m sure seeing things like this would help many fantasy owners. If not I may look to replicate for the Saints. 

Finally is it week 4 data or week 4 cumlative to include weeks 1-3 performances?"
"Why don’t you show love for Darius Phillips? I understand PFF doesn’t grade him fantastically, but his completion percentage is fantastic. Great ball skills? Nice visual representation. This is much easier to look at than my write-ups."
Do you have this graphic or even just the grades from the first 3 weeks??
This is awesome man. Thanks.
Jordan really should stick to basketball
Mixon had 3 TD's and 150+ yds rushing. What even are these numbers
Leshaun Sims probably nabbed the starting job from Phillips
"I made a post last year saying we should have traded AJ for a 3rd round pick or maybe even a 2nd rounder if the stars aligned.. I got a mixed bag of responses from this sub, but ultimately the consensus was to hold out hope for Greens big comeback. I moved to that camp too, but that hope is gone and I’m bummed we missed the window to trade him for higher value. Could have gotten a starting caliber tackle or guard for him in the first 3 rounds of this years draft. Ah well, at least we are keeping an all time great Bengal happy."
"Wow, the Jacksonville game must have given the O-Line an insane PFF boost. I’ve always enjoyed PFF, but very much take it for what it is: a compilation of stats and advanced metrics. They tell a story, but never the full story on a guy in my opinion. 4/5 of our linemen are not ‘average’ or ‘above average’. If they were, we wouldn’t be a 1 win football team right now."

"Health and safety > football games.

I don't like this.
On the Bengals website you can sign up to be contacted to purchase the tickets. I just signed up
This makes me so happy.  I missed the opportunity last time because of technical issues.  I will NOT miss it this time.  If you have season tickets make sure you sign in AFTER the tickets go on sale.  If you are signed in to the website before you won't be able to see it until after you sign out and sign back in
That’s awesome. Hopefully the capacity can increase even more as the season goes on! (Safely ofc)

"I’ll be straight with you guys, I was excited to see Joe get his first win Sunday. I also haven’t throughly enjoyed a Bengals QB play this much since Boomer when I was a kid and Carson’s early days. 

With that being said, the Jaguars were/are a paper team and it was imperative they win that game to get some positive momentum. The Ravens game is going to be a true indicator of where this team is at, get manhandled and blown out like a HS Team playing an NFL team, yeah there’s still big issues, stay competitive and lose by a score, things are moving in the right direction, win, well that speaks for itself.

I have faith Joe will have us in that game, unfortunately there’s 21 other players fielded and many of them I’m suspect on. 

Regardless, looking forward to Week 5! WHO DEY!"

"I hate seeing that pick on his stats. NFL needs a better way to allocate interceptions to the correct player. Like, just allocate the INT to the player that was responsible or split it like a sack stat if it’s a gray area."
"Don’t get me wrong, Burrow played well. But I had no idea Herbert had a heck of a game. I’m honestly surprised"
"Voted. What does everyone think about Justin Herbert?

I know I'm biased, but Herbert's throws do not seem as impressive as Joe Burrow's. 

Herbert seems to have the benefit of receivers that can get decent separation. 

I don't see many plays from that highlight reel where Herbert is ""threading the needle"", and throwing dimes. Maybe nickels, but not DIMES."

"He was cut by the patriots, and the 49ers. Our WR room is already solid. There is no reason for us to pick him up. Don't let the memory of what he was for us fool you into thinking he could be that for us now."

I still paddle the canoe. but we're full up at WR.
Vet min if anything for us. I’m not even sure he’d prove to be any better than WR5 mike Thomas and definitely prioritize Tate but I do like him as a person
Washed up and always overrated by this fan base.

Enjoyed this read and seeing Carson giving props to Burrow and fans in Cincinnati. After all that went down I think it's very legit of him to still support the team and the city.
"Ughhh okay like he didn't just spend all off season bashing us during all of the pre-draft speculation that Burrow didn't want to play here. Also he had T. O.upon his request , Chad, Benson a Mike Zimmer D and said we weren't trying and went to the playoffs the year after he left with a rookie QB.

Long story short Palmer is a prick and was overrated. Check out the NFC champ game against the Panthers and tell me how great he would have been."

"Not at all. This reminds me of the first month of the MLB. People were saying baseball was going to end when the Cardinals missed like 10 games while other teams had their own Covid related game suspensions. MLB is now deep in their postseason doing fine. NFL has, what, 10 positive cases through week 4? If you told me that before the season started, I’d say things were going wayyyy better than expected. Positive Covid tests were inevitable, and we might see some games postponed, cancelled, or forfeited, but i don’t see the season going anywhere"
Imo the worst case scenario is a 3 week hiatus  and everyone in the league quarantines. I dont think cancellation will happen.

"Hi Everyone,

Last year I became very interested in PFF grading as many fans have. I finally decided to buy the edge subscription so I could see some finer details of the grades. With that, I was disappointed that there aren't graphics showing week to week progress a player makes based on these grades. Thus, I decided to make my own file that I could update myself after each week. I think it's most interesting to see how each player progresses, especially a young team like ours. 

The file contains a tab for each position group. Every player that has taken a snap is represented and a graph shows their progression for the grades I thought were important for each position group. Note that the grades are not what the player graded for that specific week, but rather the overall grade for the entire year. Unfortunately, I did not decide to do this until post week 4. So I do not have weeks 1-3 included. Huge bummer but there was no where I could find grades for those weeks. **IF ANYONE DOES HAVE THOSE GRADES AND WOULD BE WILLING TO SHARE THAT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.** Also unfortunate is how google sheets changes the file when importing from Excel. I had red and green lines as type of cutoff points but they simply did not carry over into google sheets. O well I suppose. The y-axis also changed slightly but that's no big deal. 

I plan on updating my file and reposting to the sub each week for those that don't have the time or subscribe to PFF themselves. Or if you do, you can simply import the file to Excel and use it how you desire. 

BTW - For some reason I thought our bye week was week 10 (it's really week 9), so that week is not included. I will have that fixed with the update I post next week.

Edit: that’s if the team plays well or gets lucky."
5-0
"We can beat the Browns and the Titans might have to forfeit haha. The Colts will be really tough with the way their D is playing but we have a decent shot.

I don’t really see a path to victory against the Steelers or Ravens unfortunately. Any given Sunday but those games probably give us less than a 10% chance."
"2 potentially 3 games. I honestly think we have a shot against the Ravens. They don't have the best pass rush so if they want to pressure Burrow they have to blitz and that's something Burrow is strong against. I think it'll be a shoot out.

There's no reason we can't beat the Browns especially since they won't have Chubb.

The Steelers are 3-0, but who have they played? The Giants, Texans, and Broncos. None of those teams ar good. 

The hardest games will be Titans and Ravens because we still suck at run defense."
"I see us losing 38-30 to Ravens this week, winning 26-17 over Colts, winning 34-31 over Browns in a last minute thriller, Win 38-21 with Titans and lose 24-10 to Steelers to go 3-2."
This is a true test for Zac Taylor. He’s had plenty of time to get acclimated in the league and now it’s time to put him and the team to the test vs some of the leagues best. A great coach comes out of this stretch with 3+ wins.
At least we get the automatic win in week 8 lol
What is a reasonable record prediction for the next five do you guys think we can rattle off a win or two?
I could see us winning the titans game and possibly the colts game. Joe gonna have his hands full the next couple weeks. Just don’t let him die vs the Steelers defence.
"While it's hard for any team to go 5-0 or even 4-1 but that would change this season's expectations. Burrow gives them a chance, just need to the defense to step up in key situations. One game at a time though"
"Honestly i think we have a good chance at the next 4 games after this ravens game. 

Colts have a really great passing defense but I think we can keep up with them with joe in a low scoring game and with joes clutch gene its not hard to see us taking that game.

The browns ran all over us last game but we still only lost by 5 points and that was without geno or mike daniels in the middle and it was in Cleveland. Dont get me wrong cleveland is probably still favored but burrow can keep pace and if mixon is on again we could get out to an early lead.

The titans have not impressed me much this season even with being 3-0. They probably will run for a lot of yards on us but if we make it a shootout I expect them to fall flat.

Steelers game is tough but we do have a bye week to prepare for it and based on what joe did when he had extended time to study defenses in college we could be talking about a potential rivalry redefining game in the making.

Give me 2-3 wins in this stretch followed by some pretty bad teams. 

Joe is the real difference maker he will drag us to wins we don't deserve."
Close games to the ravens and titans but barely lose those the other ones we win
"The only way we beat the Ravens is in a shootout.. so I’m hoping the coaching staff realizes that. This is a game where you NEED to be aggressive. Don’t settle for field goals, don’t punt on 4th and short, don’t run on 2nd and long. I’m praying Taylor understands that."
Looks like 5 W's to me.
"The Titans might give us COVID and get our season cancelled, which almost guarantees a high draft choice, and keeps Burrow from getting Kimo’d by Pittsburg."
"Can the titans even play us by then? Lol and if Lamar doesn’t play I see us going 3-2 in those games, but as a fan I’m going 5-0."
"I’m not saying I hope the Titans woes continue, but I’m saying I hope the Titans woes continue"
"If we can keep these games close and not get blown out by the Ravens and maybe pick up 1-2 wins I would be super pleased. We haven't lost a single game by more than 5 points so far.

You know Burrow is only satisfied with W's. And this is just an X factor we haven't had in a while. We can beat any of these teams of we are playing our best ball.

I have faith."
"Honestly I think they can win any of these games. I'm legit smelling upset against the Ravens, they're not the same team and I think this team will want to make a mark after finally winning.

Xavier Sua Filo should be back sometime within this stretch so the o line should be at least a bit improved with him. But Rivers and Big Ben are both senile old men who make mistakes, the browns had a perfect offensive game against us and barely won, idk what to make of the titans, I don't think I've seen them play this year. Of course it all comes down to the o line, and if the defense can live up to their expectations, but I think the bengals have the talent to win most of these games."
Does Zac Taylor get fired if we're swept by the browns?
[removed]
"Why do the Bengals only post the press conferences from Zac Taylor and Joe Burrow?  Looking through other teams YouTube channels, they have several press conferences from several players posted each week.  Obviously the other players have press conferences because the reporters tweet about their comments, but the media team chooses not to post them."
Bengals will hold a conference with a player and make it impossible to find for fans. If you go on sports illustrated and get to the “All Bengals” page u can find them on there by scrolling a bit...
Idk they used to post transcripts too and quit.
It sucks but James Rapien usually puts them up on SI.com after the game

"I wonder who they’re planning to start over him, maybe Lawson?"
"Love Dunlap but he hasn’t looked great in the pass rush. He plays to bat balls 100% of the time. Good trait, but not 100% of the time. Great D lines have great edge rush, we do not."
Hopefully Zac can get it cleared up with his Veteran.
"Dunlap deserved to be demoted, but not like this."
"I mean... you got benched, play better and you won’t get benched."
"Its business, he's being overly sensitive"
"Zac and the coaching staff dropped the ball on this one, disrespectful to let a veteran player find out through posting the depth chart."
"His performance is definitely down and the demotion is justified however, he's due the respect of them approaching him 1 on 1 with this sort of thing. You don't want to piss off a veteran leader who has been a franchise pillar as long as he's been."
Uhh. What?
"I dont think he is going to see a huge reduction in snaps, but hopefully he can use it as motivation."
Trade Block time.
"In regards to roster management in the Taylor era, has there been anyone that has played so well that they have 100% locked down a spot? I know Dunlap has been a long time starter, but he’s not played like it since Taylor has been here, and this is not the same roster at all. I think Dunlap time’s time is over, and Taylor isn’t Marvin. Dunlap needs to be a team player and bust his ass when he’s on the field."
[deleted]
Maybe stop playing like ass idk
"Dalton was benched on his birthday and you’re bitching about a rotational job listed on a piece of paper?

Smallest 🎻 playing right now for Dunlap"
Dunlap hasn't played well this season fr.
"My heart hurts for Dunlap. This shitty organization has put such pathetic Defensive Coordinators in place ever since Zimmer left and now our current bag of donkey dung at DC is demoting Dunlap to a position that doesn't fucking make sense for our group of DEs. Some coaches are trying to keep their jobs, but its going to back fire."
[deleted]
"He had a good game against the Eagles with 9 solo tackles and 1 pass defended. The other 3 he has struggled stats-wise. His worst game was last week. I get the move form a stats perspective but what I wonder is the field leadership side of things. Not sure if he is or isn't an on field leader but I'd have to imagine he is. Even so, that can only get you so far when you have to stop such a potent offense!

&#x200B;

Edit: They should be upfront with him at every turn, however! He's earned that!!"
""
"Love Dunlap, but can appreciate the approach of no sacred cows. We have had that problem as a franchise for too long

Hopefully motivates him back into form"
"Good. He's been really, really bad this year. 0 sacks, 1 TFL, and only 2 QB hits through 4 games? Either he's getting old or mentally out of it. 

I'm really glad we seem to be moving past the Marvin mentality of playing your aging players out of respect or whatever. I want every player at every position to earn their snaps. Love Carlos and want to see him back on the field, but not until he steps up his game."
"It seemed like he was more upset that he found out from the depth chart being posted, not directly from the staff"
wow who’s starting in place of him? lawson?
This says as much about how much Carl Lawson has improved as a 3-down player as it does about Dunlop getting older.
I agree his play on the field hasn't been as great as previous years. Hopefully Dunlap doesn't take this too personally and escalate it to a larger problem than it needs to be.
"I've loved Dunlap but dude has been on the Bengals since our original 9/85 Palmer/Johnson were still on the team, which really seems like a whole lifetime ago.

He's getting old and just isn't the same player anymore."
Dunlap needs to air his frustration with himself only. He has not been good this year and needs to figure out what he needs to do to stay a starter. Our defensive line has been awful with him out there
"I'm a huge fan of Dunlap, have his jersey and everything.  What I've noticed about him this year is that there have been several plays, it feels like one or two each game, where he pushed way too hard into the backfield, failed to set the edge, and let the RB run between him and the DT as if he wasn't even there.  Up against the Ravens, who we know will have a huge focus on the run game, I don't necessarily disagree with putting him behind Lawson and Hubbard on the depth chart, however that works out."
"Dunlap is an awesome person and player, but I fully agree with this decision. He has been complete trash so far."
"I understand and agree with this decision. Both Hubbard and Lawson have been way way better and almost every way. With that being said, last year post-bye week (2nd half of season), Dunlap was easily the best defensive player on the team. So I'm hoping something similar happens there"
"Im fine with this, Hubbard and Lawson especially have been making plays so far where he hasn't. Sends a good message."
Not good at setting the edge this year. Literally the most important thing against the ravens. Not too surprising to me.
I'm just curious...Is it his birthday? This really feels like it must be his birthday or something.
Sorry big dog you gotta play well to get my sympathy
I feel like when Geno plays he draws double teams and now Dunlap does. Without Geno he becomes the guy who gets doubled
"I thought his twitter handle said he was an employee. He should listen to his bosses and be humble and get hungry instead of getting mad. He's gotten paid, he's had his day in the sun, and he isn't earning that spotlight anymore, so it is time to see if someone else can step up. Maybe Carlos will too, given time to reflect."
"All the ""fans"" replying to the tweet saying they disagree or who is starting instead... do they even watch this team? Or Twitter bots? Insane."
Still funny to me we have beat writers named Tyler Dragon and Ben Baby
"My concern is that a new coach comes in with something to prove, and can’t handle other vocal leaders in the room. So he starts freezing out the guys who step up and talk, with the idea that he’s clearing our folks who “aren’t on board.” Fans love this no nonsense type of BS, because we ultimately don’t know the full picture of how that locker room operates.

What inevitably happens is that the new coach doesn’t perform, gets canned, and now the team is left without the veteran players it needs to provide some stability. So not only did that coach fuck if im the present, they fucked up the future too.

There’s a reason a lot of successful coaches are good man managers. Let your coordinators focus on the Xs and Os, you worry about setting the direction of the organization and making sure everyone understands it."

That was awesome.  Literal LOL at the Birth of Venus one.
Holy shit the time he had behind his line for that georgia play....

The end of this was fantastic. Lol
Love it.
Andy Dalton was great for us and wish we have gotten the playoff success we deserved. But my flair has been this way since the end of the CFP championship game for a reason.
"AJ has come under a lot of criticism lately, from myself included. What have the observations been?

* Slow - lost a step
* Doesn't have the same hands
* AJ is constantly double-teamed

A lot of this comes through on the PFF side of the game and the result isn't pretty for AJ. AJ's grade on the season is 56.9, placing him at 88th overall in the NFL on a minimum of 10 targets. Curious to know more about his situation, I watched the condensed version and coach's film version of the game and watched #18 on every single down, whether he was targeted or not.

This is only during the Jags game, but what I noticed was-

* AJ may have the worst average yards of separation in the entire league, BUT he *does* create separation. Many, many snaps, AJ had his defender beat by at least 5 yards. However, what I had noticed was, AJ would beat his defender on his first move and create the separation. Then, the tail end of his route was a comeback or a cut to the sideline, which would slow him up and have the defender right back in his ass. It seems the way AJ is schemed is hurting his numbers. I counted 7 routes that if AJ had just kept the gas pedal to the floor and faded or streaked instead of curling, it would have been a wide open touchdown.
* AJ still has hands. He has dropped 2 balls, but I truly believe that AJ just hasn't had his moment yet this year. One comment I will make - It seems AJ has been a bit lackadaisical on his route running. Some of his routes look plain out lazy. If it's a quick pass that isn't schemed to him, AJ doesn't even begin his route with a hard first step. I saw 2 or 3 snaps where AJ was extremely delayed getting off the line of scrimmage. All other receivers began their routes a whole second before AJ took his first step.
* AJ is **not** getting double-teamed ever. We have seem teams line up with 2 deep safeties and they still aren't cheating his way. This is simply just not true. AJ is drawing the top corner for **most** snaps when he's in the game, though.

I'm looking for AJ to potentially have his first breakout game of the season versus a lackluster CB group in Baltimore.

Please discuss below. I'm interested in the general consensus of AJ and how he may perform the next couple weeks as opposed to the first 4. I did record several videos on my phone of certain plays detailing what I was speaking on above. The quality is bad since it isn't a screen record, but if anyone knows of a way that I can post them to share with ya'll then please let me know."
"I think it is fair to say right now AJ is not the player he once was. Chalk it up to age, injuries or rust coming back from injuries. 

It's going to take a concentrated effort by AJ and the coaching staff to figure out how to maximize his skillset. They did not get a chance to do that in preseason. 

It also doesn't help that he's had little time to build chemistry with Burrow"
">  if anyone knows of a way that I can post them to share with ya'll then please let me know.

You could download the imgur app and use that to upload then share a link

Also this is a really high quality post thank you very much for taking the time to go through all of the film and to write this up, I found it super interesting.

Off the top of my head one play that stands out is from the most recent game.  I know it was 3rd and long and it was a throw to AJ on the right side and I seem to remember him just not even trying to put his hands out to catch the ball.  I don't know shit about fuck but it seemed like he wasn't even trying on that play but maybe there was something I didn't pick up on.  Just seemed like he wasn't trying on a very important play.  Could have been the last play of the drive following the turnover.

Edit:

Here's the play https://youtu.be/pbjFUxemfXk?t=26

Now that I rewatch it, this could have been a TD if he didn't have to cut to the sideline like you said"
"Marlen Humphrey, Marcus Peters and Jimmy Smith are lackluster?"
"his heart is not in the game.

i think both his effort and his mindset are lackluster, and it shows in his performance.

in addition, he has zero rapport with his QB and therefore he is not a primary target."
i honestly think he should just be running go's and slants at this point. Let boyd n higgins run more complex routes.
"> AJ would beat his defender on his first move and create the separation. Then, the tail end of his route was a comeback or a cut to the sideline, which would slow him up and have the defender right back in his ass

Defenders intentionally play off on the first move so they don't get beat deep or on a double move. Doubly so for a receiver like AJ that doesn't have the speed to breakaway anymore, trying to bait a rookie QB into throwing something they can get their hands on. Corners know they can recover and close the gap with ease. AJ's only advantage now is physicality so why press him hard on the line?

To your other points, AJ has just looked flat out lazy and disinterested. Maybe its because the offense isn't schemed around him completely like it was before. Maybe its because he doesn't want to be playing on the tag. Maybe its because Joe's first read is Tyler Boyd. Maybe its because AJ doesn't have the juice anymore physically and he knows it. Maybe its because AJ has had some bad luck on his targets and hasn't been able to get involved like he wants to.

Your guess is as good as mine, but at the end of the day the point remains that he has looked awful out there and our offense runs better when he isn't involved. This will almost assuredly be his last year in stripes."
"If AJ is getting open only to then roll, curl or cut back into coverage then it is 100% on the coaching staff to recognize this and alter the scheme.  Shame on them if this is true."
"There's 0 chance he justifies an extension after this year. 18 million in extra cap space will buy a lot of defensive depth with almost no loss in production at WR. 

He's been a huge part of this team, but it's time to move on."
AJ has always gone super beast mode against the ravens.
"Let's be real here, Bengal fans are very bad about wanting instant results and I hate seeing it. So glad they have no say in what the Bengals do. 

1st - AJ Green last played a game December of 2018. DECEMEBER OF 2018 PEOPLE. It's going to take more than a 3 week period to get back into that kind of form after almost 2 straight years no football at all. 

2nd - No pre season/barely any off-season practice. The dude preseason and off-season practice is weeks 1-3 so far. AFTER 2 YEARS OF NOT PLAYING ANY FOOTBALL. Show me literally anyone who went 20 some months without playing their sport and was an all pro after 3 weeks. 

3rd - New QB and bad oline. AJ is trying to get some kind of connection with this dude without 3 second being able to hold on to the ball. What does he like with this situation or this oh wait he's already sacked. Welp maybe next time? 

This is not an ankle sprain with AJ, its multiple injuries and freaking 20 months of no football and no preseason. Can we for the love of God once think responsibly and not rush him to be prime AJ Green just yet??? I mean come on... WHODEY"
Joe doesn't have the time to wait for AJ to run a good route.....
He's done mate. Best to just accept it.
""
"That sucks, hope he's alright."
I'll never root for injuries and I would have liked some of our young guys on defense to get more looks and experience playing Lamar. I also don't want the Browns or Steelers winning the division and if Lamar is out for a few weeks it makes those scenarios more likely. He's far more likable than Baker or Ben without a doubt.
"This is setting up just perfectly. I can see this perfectly through my bengals glasses. Lamar doesn't start, and bengals go up big by half time 21-7. Lamar comes back in to start the 3rd quarter and leads the ravens to score 35 unanswered points. Ravens win 42-21."
"Even with RGIII at QB the Ravens should beat us handily if I'm being honest. I can't see us stopping their rushing attack. But I do hope Jackson plays, never like playing an opponent that isn't at full strength (relatively speaking) to open the door for the ""yeah but"" if we win. Plus Jackson is just an absolute blast to watch."
Want him to play. This week is a test to truly see where this team is at.
I would rather see how Joe stacks up against Lamar and test what this team can and cant do
I love watching Lamar I hope he plays (even though he’ll prob run for 150 yards)
"I haven't given up on hoping for a wild card this season (yes I'm delusional!) and this does increase our chances of winning. I do hope he's not seriously hurt though, he's an electric player."
Looks like Caucasian Smoke from Mortal Kombat in the thumbnail lmao

Tbf i have never heard of any aging player being happy about losing their starting position. I’m sure Taylor and Eason will have a conversation with him to smooth this out.
Dunlap hasn’t gotten a sack or made a noticeable play in the run game for 4 weeks now. If he wanted to be a starter then he should’ve played like one. I hope we spend his cap space on offensive linemen this offseason.
Wow... lost a lot of respect for Carlos after watching that. He is in need of a big time attitude adjustment. I wouldn’t stand for that BS if I was a coach.
"Let’s not make a mountain out of a molehill out of this.


I love Dunlap, but if he’s pissed, he can get over it."
Do you have a link?
taylor set the precedent with the dalton decision last year.  vets shouldnt be surprised.
"Carlos Dunlap vs the Eagles:
-6 defensive stops

Dunlap in the 3 other games:
-0 defensive stops

He has 9 total pressures on 128 pass-rush attempts, and has produced a pass-rushing productivity of 3.8, which ranks T-48th among 56 qualifying EDGE defenders this season.

Lets not. Its highly unlikely
"I wish football was a sport that was active with midseason trades like MLB or NBA, but it rarely ever happens. We’ll be standing pat."
I just got done having a conversation with my friend who is a Browns fan. I asked him if you could have Baker or Burrow for the next 10 years who would you pick. He couldn’t decide but he said he was leaning  Baker. I am a diehard Bengals fan but I feel like I could’ve been honest with myself in that situation are all fans this crazy?
What QBs would you take over Burrow?
Fan bias is extremely real and extremely powerful. I can definitely believe this happened and that your friend believed what he said. Desperately believing in your franchise while in denial of what a rival has.
"If I wanted a better qb, I would go with Burrow each time. However, I don't want a better qb, I want Baker. I like what we have."

"Use the money you would have paid AJ in an extension and sign Allen Robinson this off season. He would complete the WR group for the next 5 years. He's 27 years old and has been one of the most productive receivers in the NFL with shitty teams his entire career. You could maybe get him a bit cheaper because he doesn't carry the big name guys like Beckham, Julio, etc carry. In short...he's drastically underrated. 

Draft an O Lineman in the first round, then use additional money gained from cutting/losing guys (Dunlap, Ross, Erickson, Hart, Billy Price, William Jackson (if not resigned), Gio, CJ Uzomah) and sign another elite offensive lineman and/or defense play maker. 

Bengals are in a good spot but they need to be smart this off-season and cut ties with some guys and then actually spend the money they make up on other solid acquisitions. 

This is the way..."
I honestly think we don’t need WR help. We have  very good prices in place with or without AJ ... namely joe burrow lol
Please no
Being a Penn State fan I gotta agree 100%
"Honestly all we need to do in the WR room is draft some guy with explosiveness in the 3rd or 4th round unless some beast drops to us at any point. Boyd, Higgins and most likely Tate set us up for the rest."
"Depends on the price. I like him but don’t have a desire to pay high $ to a receiver with the talent we have already. 

Instead, I’d prefer we invest that cash in a DE or OL. 

If I had to choose a pass catcher to pay, I’d prefer to go after Hunter Henry and restructure/cut Uzomah."
Use AJ’s money to sign a free agent offensive lineman that is proven. Draft WR in 2nd or 3rd round next year.
Nah we don’t need to sign a WR we need to let all the vets walk besides Geno and sign the best OL available then draft one of the linemen not names Sewell cause we won’t be bad enough to get him
"I'd rather sign one or two proven linemen, and draft Chase because there's no way Sewell's making it out of the top 3"
"You do know Hart is signed at over 7 Mill a year through 2021.

Although MB has let go of salaries more recently, unless Hart agrees to reconstruction into a bonus, don't be surprised if he is on the roster next year."
Same why a no? After watching last nights game i think Robinson would be a great addition.
I'd rather see Auden get more meaningful reps
"The MOVE to do , is trade aj green to a wr needy team this season. As long as it’s a second rounder ( better than the end of third compensation if he walks next year).  We don’t need to sign any wr to a contract of 15 million, not aj or allen Robinson. Instead. Take that extra 15 million saved from AJ, and go out and over spend on THE best lineman. Then draft the tackle from Oregon with the first round pick. 
Boom! O line fixed. 2 second round picks to take best available."

Got an email saying us little people will now have the the opportunity to purchased tix on October 13.
"It has nothing to do with season ticket holders. When it bumped up to 12,000 fans could attend, they announced they would be opening single game tickets sales."
"Not true at all, I am a season ticket holder and couldn’t get tickets. I bet the bengals set aside like 500 tickets to give the allusion that they are giving non season ticket holders a chance"
"Its called ""the Bengals want other fans to show up, and not just season ticket holders"""
"thats good news, it show that Bengals fans is not that dumb."

"You know what, i don’t think it should be that lopsided at all, but I kinda get it. Lawrence has been amazing for like 3 straight years, and Burrow only had one. However, that one year was one of the best college QB seasons ever where he trashed Lawrence in the finals. Honestly, I can totally see why someone would think Lawrence is the better prospect (longevity versus peak), but I am incredibly happy we have Burrow. He already looks like top 10 QB material, and I wouldn’t trade him for anything"

Lebron literally just won a championship within the last five years. Doesn’t even equate to the satisfaction that we will all feel when the Bengals win their first SB.
I don’t give a fuck about Cleveland sports tbh
Jimmy Buckets is rippin ass
"Holy shit dude fuck you and fuck Lebron. How is this even remotely related to the Bengals? If the NBA collapsed I wouldn’t give a shit. It’s bush league compared to what it used to be and will never be close to the NFL. 

Again fuck you and that whiny bitch Lebron James."
Fuck Cleveland and fuck Lebron

"God. I remember I drunkingly made a post on this sub about how Haskins would bring excitement and joy to our franchise...

WTF was I smoking?

Edit: [here’s the post lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/bengals/comments/b7t3ey/this_fanbase_needs_dwayne_haskins/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
Yup. Dodged a big bullet there.
I just look at Burrow and wonder what the hell we did to deserve such a blessing
"Too early to give up on Haskins. The physical tools are there. However, you can’t force a kid to study the game like a Manning or be humble or show up early everyday etc. I just don’t like giving up on young talent if they get the proper guidance. He should have stayed another year at OSU. 

My worst nightmare is he goes to the Steelers and they make a man out of him"
He might never be good but his development in the nfl hasn’t been ideal. His rookie year he had a coach that didn’t want him and put no effort into helping him and year 2 he gets a new coaching change. He was already pretty green and hasn’t had any help.
OSU quarterbacks and the NFL don’t go together
Holy hindsight bias
I still think he could be a productive NFL QB in the right situation. But nowhere near what Burrow can be
"I am as well. There was a Bengals fan on here that I got into it really heavy with when he came out. I like to watch tape on college QBs when it comes draft time, and I watched every single pass that Haskins threw that year. 

I’m no expert, but I did not like him whatsoever and this user basically thought I was massive idiot for having any doubts or criticism of him. He thought he was such a sure thing and he has had the exact same problems in the NFL that he had in college."
"There are too many factors when trying to find an elite QB. 

To win a Super Bowl, you need to get your QB in Rounds 1-3 with Brady being the aberration. And yes...Kurt Warner and Brad Johnson. Otherwise, you're not getting your guy. 

&#x200B;

And even then, scouts have no idea how the player will perform at the pro level. It's weird how we live in an age of ""advanced analytics"" and have no idea how the guy will turn out at the pro level. Any one of us could be a pro scout making tons of money instead of sitting at the bar talking about who should be a first or second rounder with our friends.

Haskins had the stats at OSU and impressed scouts. But like a lot of first round QBs, you either have it immediately or you don't. 

&#x200B;

1) You come in right away, play well, and have great stats and the team wins. (Dan Marino, Andrew Luck, Ben Roethlisberger) 

2) You come in, the team sucks, but you have great stats and demonstrate your ability.  

3) You get drafted by a bad team, you suck your first year but you get better. (Peyton Manning, Troy Aikman) 

&#x200B;

The word ""develop"" is interesting. To me, you either have it or you don't."
"This sub had its Andy = BAD, Haskins = SAVIOR moments. I kept my mouth shut because I don’t care to argue, glad we avoided that mess."
Dwayne had 300 yard game with no interceptions against Baltimore Rivera and staff got a personal beef with this kid. So before you guys get on your high horse because we finally scored a qb understand the fact.
I had hoped missing the end kneel down to take a selfie with fans was just a mistake of excited youth. Turns out it may be par for the course.
"I mean, he got drafted into the absolute worst possible situation. It's at least 50% not his fault how he's failed to develop so far."
I was one of those idiots as well. Thank goodness the Bengals weren’t thinking what I was lol.
I also did not want us to draft him. I am so glad we did not.
"LSU alum who was a ‘Skins fan..... y’all doged a bullet. Watching the skins implode yet again is just so.... expected. Hoping the Bengals can make magic happen with Burrow at QB1. I’m not ready to not be obsessed with him quite yet. (It’s also the only somewhat exciting part of football season this year, given our new DC apparently likes losing....)"
I remember being called crazy for my criticisms of Haskins pre draft. While I like being validated I was hoping to be wrong about Haskins.
"It takes a big man... to admit that you made a borderline semi-informed decision while half in the bag.

Now get back on the wagon and enjoy the ride!!"
I got called a racist on here for saying we shouldnt take him :/
"[Haskins gets a raw deal](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/dwayne-haskins-benching-with-no-washington-advocates-young-qb-caught-in-vortex-of-organizational-failure/)

Haskins aint anywhere near Burrows level. However going to WFT is his issue. Read that article. And I hate the little puke who wrote it. (Ravens homer LaCanfora) But he aint wrong in this instance.

Through 13 games:

Player A) 193/283 (48.4%), 1,801 yards, 8 TD/15 INT, 59.6 rating

Player B) 208/349 (59.6%), 2,304 yards, 11 TD/10 INT, 77.8 rating

Player C) 269/476 (56.6%), 2,869 yards, 21 TD /25 INT, 68.0 rating

Player A is John Elway; Player B is Haskins; Player C is Peyton Manning."
For sure dodge a bullet but I feel for the dude. Didn't even get to have a full season before getting benched.
Haskins was excellent at throwing screens to really fast guys in an Urban Meyer offense... That's about it. I'm glad we dodged that bullet too
I got called a racist on here for saying we shouldnt take him :/
Imo haskins was a version of dalton with a stronger arm. Still required all the support cast and events to go his way. Although dalton had better presnap reads.
No fucking shit. I screamed in this sub for months at any moron homer that wanted to draft that loser. You can tell who has “it” and who doesn’t and Haskins doesn’t have it

This is exactly the amount of Bobby Hart I like to see.
"Ok I'll be the guy to say that the front office and zac taylor have actually been doing good things recently.

We can debate how much mike brown was involved in us spending big in free agency but we cant forget that this just happened.

Zac Taylor has made a few questionable play calls but he has definitely reimagined his playbook to work great with a guy like Burrow. 

Now dont get me wrong joe is doing the heavy lifting all by himself in making this team great but i wouldnt describe the recent actions of the bengals as ""not helping their team be better""

This is all subject to change obviously but why not give them some credit until they prove otherwise."
"That may be the most perfect example of the meme, plus our season's hopes, that will ever exist. Brown and Zac need this tattooed on their foreheads."
Someone update this and put Bobby Harts name on the trash can in the background.
rotfl. perfect
He needs to pull harder today.....
I think they should add a kid in front of burrow Train with another O-Line Train and have Jim Turner as the kid ramming the train into burrow

This brightened my day. Thank you. FTS.
"i’m a bengals fan in australia, and i’m about to get up at 4AM australian time to watch the bengals play the ravens and probably loose by 20"
"This is the way

Lived in Korea for a little over a year and did the same."
"\[27F\] I'm a recent Joe Burrow fan (because he's cute.lol), and I have also been learning the rules of NFL. The airtime for the game here is on the Philippines is 1AM. Hopefully, I'm still awake by then xD"
"[28M] I’ve been a Bengals fan since 2005 from Australia. I’ve done many, many 4am wake ups in my time. I had to stop when I started full time work 😔 I’ll still get up and chuck on redzone though before work starts."
"Get to watch the Bengals at 4 in the morning?? Hell, that’s a dream come true!! Lol hopefully they reward your dedication with a W!"
This is how I feel as an American watching Formula 1 lol
"At least the playoffs end up being at a reasonable time for you! I'm in Ireland, early games in the regular season is fine (6pm) but forget about any prime time games."
Yeah but that’s ok because you just watched 10 of the craziest extra time minutes ever in a rugby match.
"I really don't think they will lose by 20 today. I think we will be pleasantly surprised. Winning is unlikely, but I think it could easily end up being another of those one score games."
This is the way
This is the life of a Cincinnati fan.
"Wouldn’t call this dedication as much as this is self-hurt... you should probably get some help, you don’t deserve to be treated this way."
20? Someone woke up feeling optimistic
"I have a buddy who lives in Hawaii who gets up at 6 to watch the Bengals at 7. He's an extreme early morning person though, so he loves it."
"Your score prediction is a bit too prescient. I guess that’s what happens when you are a day in the future already :)

(I did remember which way the date line works right?)"
Ummmmm.......im scared cuz there is only 9 minutes left and we are down by 20 lmfao are you from the future????
Here in India. This is my first NFL season. I don't have a single favourite team but Burrow is definitely my favorite player. This Ravens game is gonna be very stressful.
"Wow, you called it. We are down by 20."
I'm in Hawaii so the games are usually 7/8 depending on DST. One nice thing is having the rest of the day to yourself

Looks like the game will be played mostly in the rain. Let’s hope our O-Line can be decent at the run block and not force us to pass. Hopefully it’ll be an exciting game! Who Dey!!!
a slippery field means less mobility on Lamar’s part. That’s absolutely their biggest advantage. I like our chances. 34-31 Bengals. WHO FUCKING DEY.
I hope Joes tiny hands don’t have trouble holding on to the slippery ball.
It's wet games like this... where Joe Burrow channeling his inner SpongeBob at the start of the game may come in handy.
It rained last week and they did great... We got this!

The lack of decent facilities is actually in our favor this time. We'll take it.
And yet here we are with no positive test (knocks on wood) while the Pats and Titans have closed their facilities and had games postponed...sure point us out.
"There isn't really any information here other than ""Bengals bad.""

We don't have traditional NFL facilities and haven't done much contact tracing because we've had no positive tests?

I'm sure there must be something in that data, but without it, this is a nonstory"
"Well we haven’t had any cases yet, so maybe the rest of the league should follow the Bengals lead."
Don’t give LaCanfora clicks you assholes. He’s the absolute pinnacle of hack “journalists” and this is almost certainly either overblown or complete bullshit.
The fact that literally nobody else is reporting this is telling.

That was such a soft call. Burrow could get murdered and the refs would allow it.
"Can we talk about how garbage this announcing crew is? ""Burrow's gotta learn to throw it away"". No. He knew they were offsides and you didn't somehow"
THAT PASS IS COMPLETE!
"“Why do I keep saying Murray” 

1. You suck and are unprepared.
2. This game is a joke"
Am I wrong? How was that a first down? Am I tripping?
Green just fucking stopped running his route
This is the worst protection I have ever seen
AJ Green needs to be benched.
"I'm already getting sick of Taylor blaming Burrow. Coming out of half he says it is all on those turnovers...No mention in to how terrible the line is doing causing the turnovers. 

He's really working hard to protect Turner."
What a dick move by harbaugh
Absolutely zero effort from green on that INT...
Bengals Defenses and third down completions to the opposing Tight End for the conversion. Name a more iconic duo.
Hart standing there like an idiot while Burrow gets smashed is a perfect picture of this line.
Lmfao this o-line is terrible
This is the kind of game that someone loses their job for.
"I’m officially anti Zac Taylor, he’s a coward."
"I'm tired of wasting Justin Tuckers time.

Anything Below 50. just count it as 3 and lets keep it moving"
We put together a good drive and it ends with 6 for the other team
Really come on. You’re up by 27.
This is text book 101 How to ruin a franchise QB
"Wanna hear a joke?

A failed OC and QB coach becoming a HC."
"Bengals going empty backfield to try to get Ravens to spread blitz out, and the Ravens don’t even care. They know the receivers can’t get fast enough separation, and that the o-line can’t block. No need to call off all the blitzes."
"Holy shit ZT. Why are you still spreading wide? They’re blitzing every play. Any numbnuts knows you need have a TE in there with the line or at the very list a god damn chip blocker what the hell dude. Fire Zac now. Also, joey appears to have hurt his arm. Fuck these coaches."
Ravens figured us out. Just blitz every play and Burrow wont have time to throw. There is no way we can play the rest of the season like this. Fed up with how ZT has handled this offseason.
Anyone blaming anything or anyone outside of the offensive line this game is completely blind
I literally had no expectations for today.. but holy shit
Zac is a nice guy and all but his record speaks for itself. He needs to be gone next year. His coaching staff is horrendous. The people you surround yourself with explains a lot about you
A run on 3rd and 7 and then a field goal to end the game??? Fuck ZT. He doesn't want to win. Just wants to keep his job as long as he can.
That rollout play has worked 0% of the time so far.
No matter what the distance is. The Bengals are trash on 3rd down
"You're allowed to grab Burrow's head, but not tap Lamar's shoulder like you're a bouncer who needs to see an ID."
"Idea: let’s play Bobby hart at QB for a series, leave the RT spot completely unmanned, and see how Bobby likes getting teed off on from the right side every damn play."
Entire country knew that blitz was coming
Oline coach should be fired on the field
Being a dipshit cunt runs in the Harbaugh family
We all just saw AJ stand there right?
Fire Marvin!
We need to cut out the chapter of the playbook that has those roll outs...
Real generous spot right there.
"I mean maybe the tv camera angle is bad, but the bengals have to challenge that"
"That was such a BS call. How is that unnecessary roughness? It wasn’t even rough. Even in today’s game, that isn’t a personal foul"
"My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because being a fan of this team gave me cancer anyway."
“We’ll find out who that is after the break”... these announcers even suck.
Broooo our offense is essentially responsible for 21 of the 27 points.
Harbaugh can fuck off challenging this up 4 scores with 6 minutes left.
"Don’t worry all my fellow Joe Mixon fantasy owners, ZT is going to run this clock out before we score to preserve the shut out."
We did not just run it on 3rd and 7
These announcers are AWFUL
Take burrow out. The line gives him less than 2 seconds. At this point all your doing is making him doubt himself and risking injury.
I think its fairly unanimous as a fanbase we dont hate the ravens the same way we fucking despise the steelers
Just three unanswered touchdowns and the Bengals are right back in this.
The crowd noise or whatever the hell it is has now given me a migraine.  Literally can’t watch any more
Dude the WRs aren’t open. Who do you guys want him to throw to?
Zac Taylor’s seat should be on fire after this shit
Ugh kick rocks Harbaugh
Can’t wait for Zac and fuckface Turner to blame the sacks on Joe.
"If anyone wants to stop watching this dumpster fire and switch to see something cool, Alex Smith is about to play"
John Ross inactive yet again lol
Nice to see Bobby hart social distancing out there
That was the first time in Lamar Jackson’s career that he didn’t score an opening drive touchdown against us. Baby steps!
"Does the broadcaster keep calling Lamar, Murray on the play by play? Or am I crazy?"
New rule: you can't tap the qbs shoulder
Guaranteed they don't call that if Burrow gets shoved there though
I went into this game mentally prepared to get ran over and it’s helped so far
I don’t understand why we keep playing into our weakness. We don’t have an o line to throw a 25 yard pass.
Even the Washington Football Team were able to hang with the Ravens. The difference a somewhat competent coach makes.
"I can't believe Zac Taylor, with such an impressive resume, is struggling to succeed as a head coach in the NFL. Who would have thought?"
"I’ve said it before and I’m going to say it again - drafting burrow only to put him behind this line is like purchasing a brand new Porsche, letting your toddler drive it off the lot, then being surprised when your new toy gets totaled. I’m so exhausted with the brown family & Duke Tobin"
Fire Jim Turner now.
I wish our coaches would look as infuriated as i do when i watch this JV oline play. Maybe some fear for their jobs would make em play even average
This is the equivalent of our super bowl hangover. ZT doesn’t win very much
Benching Burrow is silly and will do nothing but piss him off given how competitive he is. Leave Burrow in and send his (inevitable) medical bills directly to mike brown & Duke Tobin - maybe that’ll motivate them to actually get some damn protection for their prize QB investment
I'm buying a Bates jersey
"Announcers touched on it - but the biggest worry now is Burrow losing his pocket awareness and starting to ""feel"" guys when they aren't there. Ghosts. If Joe keeps getting sacked he's going to start feeling it in his head and get happy feet. That's troublesome."
The defense is actually (kinda) doing their job right now. Ravens haven’t scored since the 1st quarter. If the offense hadn’t completely fucking imploded this could still be a ball game.
Is Gumbell okay?😂 Dude seems like he's completely lost.
I mean literally what is our plan with the rest of the season? How are we going to adjust and protect Burrow? What are our options?
"D is actually balling out, fuck . Keep Hopkins and Williams, trash the rest"
We didnt give up points to end the half 🥳🥳🥳
"Did that halftime announcer just say “they’re protecting ok, just not getting open down the field”???? What offensive line is he watching?"
"“Why do I keep saying Murray?” 

LOL I’m dead"
Welp fuck us there goes Reader
Whoever was in agreement that our O-line was fine enough to make no moves to improve it is who should be fired s m h
"That second down edge rusher was on burrow, but god fucking dammnit Taylor HAS TO STOP CALLING PLAY ACTION OUT OF ACE. IT RARELY WORKS, AND IT IS CONSTANTLY GETTING BURROW SACKED. FUCK YOUR DESIRE TO IMITATE SEAN MCVAY ITS NOT WORKING"
Lamar should legit have 5 picks today
What can you do but laugh?
Harbaugh can lick my butthole
The entire Harbaugh family are a bunch of bitch ass motherfuckers
"Zac Taylor really said ""well at least we didnt get shutout"""
You know... bengals could just hire a GM and this nightmare would be over. But the brown family just keeps doubling down on their ineptitude
Green just watching that happen
You cannot convince me that there are not free agents out there that would be improvements to our offensive line.
AJ sitting there alone on the sideline was heartbreaking.
That's the play out of a timeout?
Imagine Burrow with the pocket Jackson gets
the sidearm is wild- dude called him Murray though lol
"This guy keeps calling Lamar, “Murray” 😂"
I’m inclined to think consistent 3rd down conversions is a coaching matter
Why the hesitation to hit Jackson?
"Lamar Jackson is having a down season this year, Murray however is incredible, could not have prepared for this"
"What the absolute FUCK was Davis Gaither doing there? Runs right past Jackson and stops? How about just going right at him, son?"
"Aj, you have to do something"
AJ Green is done. Just gave up on trying  to tackle the guy who intercepted that ball. He is scared. Can’t play football scared.
"AJ Green gave up on that play.

Probably wouldn't have caught it, but shouldn't have been a return."
How in the fuck is that roughness?
What a bullshit call
can anyone find the rule about that being “automatically declined.” i mean wtf
This team will win with Burrow. It will not win with Zac Taylor.
"This aint LSU. You cant hold it that long, son. 

Learning lessons. Wait until he gets his Shitsburgh indoctrination of cheap shots and shit refs."
"Obviously the line is a complete mess, but joe’s not helping himself at all. He’s going to get himself on IR if he doesn’t starting throwing the damn ball away"
The shitty thing is he's not allowed to make rookie mistakes because there's no room for error on this fucking God awful team.
It's the reigning MVP and division champs vs. a rebuilding team with a shoddy O-Line. I know it's rough but it's expected unfortunately. I'm mostly disappointed that Taylor's solid calls in the JAX game were a blip on the radar rather than a consistent trend going forward.
"Isn't that going low on the QB?

Is it different when your behind the QB..isn't that the carson palmer rule?"
If Linemen didn't exist we'd be one of the best teams in the league
Fucking two rushers not picked up FS!
Greg Gumbo does not call a good game
It's going to be fascinating to see how the Bengals adjust at half time to this Ravens blitz. You KNOW what's coming ZT...how you going to beat it?
[deleted]
Is 3 wins in 21 games good?
"I don't know what you guys want from playcalling. If you can't execute in the trenches, you won't do shit. Nothing can develop, no running game to consider, Burrow is getting hit before his second read.

There's no hiding this horrible offensive line play with schemes. They are getting thoroughly thrashed."
Jfc this line is going to get Burrow murdered.
"Yeah, Joe was bound to have his first clunker eventually.


Good news is that he’ll probably learn from this, and we’ll get pissed off Burrow next week."
"If I have my stats right, Dalton was sacked 37 times in 13 games last year... Burrow is at 22 in 5 games..."
"The frustration for me is the bengals knew they were drafting a QB this off season, and just flat out didn’t even try to upgrade the line. It’s not like this line is decimated with injuries. It’s practically the same 5 as last year. Just a fucking terrible job by a team that knew it was going to draft and rookie and start a rookie."
Have we even gotten past the Ravens 40-yard line on offense yet
"Why the hell are you challenging the spotting on a first down when you're up 27 with 5 minutes in the damn game? 

Talk about a poor winner."
Joe looking disillusioned hurts to see
"""You draft a Quarterback and you have to make a commitment to protect him""

No shit, you don't say?"
"""Joe can't hold onto the ball that long""

The fuck you mean? He only has about 2-3 seconds to hold before the pocket collapses, sometimes less."
Want to beat the bengals? Run misdirection plays.
Why does Gumble keep calling Lamar Murray?
Not a first down
"Lamar ""Murray"" Jackson is killing us on 3rd downs"
Why no challenge to the spot??
Fire Anarumo how the fuck does he still have a job. 5/5 on 3rd down in one drive unbelievable.
You know I'd really like Mark Andrews to fuck off
Wtf did aj turn into a blocker after the pick or somethin?
AJ Green playing the ball like John Ross
 Lmao no fucking way burrow would get that call
Automatically declined?
"Well I hope weeds legal wherever you’re at folks, you’ll need it"
i picked the bengals +14 did i make a mistake?
How are these people so fucking incompetent? Our O line just fails to block pass rushers on several plays.  Not complicated blitzes just d line running free.
"The Jags were playing on Rookie, this is All-Madden difficulty."
One good game against a shitty team bought Jim Turner the rest of the season. So dumb. Fire turner fire Lou
"Burrow pointed AJ deep, and AJ hitched."
free play so Joe said fuck it
"Surprised if they snap it: Literally snaps a micro second later

Lol"
"Taking Burrow out, as seems to be the popular opinion based on these comments, would be so detrimental to his outlook next year. Strictly because the competitive side of Burrow would be inevitably pissed that this coaching staff wouldn't let him compete and try to win, and you risk losing his confidence in the organization (slim as it already may be)"
The Erickson 30 yard lateral sprint for 4 yards
[deleted]
Quick slants beat blitzes right? Asking for a Friend.
Defense looks legit today.
"Can we stop talking about culture, and instead talk about how Zac Taylor’s offense doesn’t score points?"
I can't believe that was only 1 half of football.
I am so impressed with our defense.
Joe has to start feeling that pressure.
This is probably the worst offensive performance by the bengals I’ve ever seen
"AJ doesn’t want to be here anymore, on the bench he said trade me"
I just want a decent drive. Joe needs some confidence.
They finally run a qb sneak and they get it. Who would’ve thought
Well. The NFL now has the Bengals figured out. Just blitz every play.
"One of these days, the defense will play like they did this week and the offense will play like they did last week. And it will be good..."
we can't have nice things
I'm starting to think we're not gonna win the super bowl this year
Harbaugh is a piece of shit. What a tool
Congrats Harbaugh you save a yard up by 27 as you were handed generous spots all game. What a bitch.
FAT RANDY MADE A CLUTCH FIELD GOAL! LET'S GO!
why didn’t we try for a TD there??
Is not being shut out worth that much? jfc. Just go for the TD.
Going for a field goal down 27. Marvin Lewis level shit. Give me a break.
Kicking a fg?  Fucking weak.  What a bitch move.
[deleted]
We should stop trying to win and just run the ball the rest of the year to keep Burrow alive.
FIRE ZAC TAYLOR
Def take the field goal after that misdirection. D stepped up after that.
How many bengals does it take to stop a 3rd down...
I have to give credit to Lou and Taylor. Bold to create an entire defensive playbook that ignores Tight Ends.
"I knew they were going to score a lot today, but that was frustrating. 3rd down & long defense was absolutely abysmal"
"So many unblocked rushers, and WTF AJ"
How has no one told gumble that he keeps calling Lamar Jackson Murray?
On pace to lose 0-40.
"AJ gave this team a lot of good years, but his drop off in production has been.... dramatic"
We're gonna lose by 50
"At this pace, The 4th quarter will feature Ravens’ second string."
This is tough to watch
I don’t think I’m going to be able to finish this
Fuck this offensive line. Fuck this coaching staff. Fuck this front office.
[deleted]
"Harbaugh isn't going for the win, he's going for humiliation."
"This is evidence of how far off we are as a team. We can’t compete with the Ravens or Chiefs, and that’s the standard."
can we bench joe before he breaks? thanks
Yeah another second and long run!!! Genius!!
Quit going god damn empty. We can’t pick up the extra rushers
We get an interception and within 20 seconds we are punting lmao I hate this team
Pain.
Can we get one play with some time in the pocket? For fucks sakes
"Holy shit y’all, we’ve just had an extremely rare Carlos Dunlap sighting!"
It really sucks because are defense is playing decent and if our offensive line was just okay we would be in this game
If you would have told me the defense held them to 17 I would have guessed it was a close game.
It’s encouraging that we’ve held them to 17 and they haven’t completely blown us out yet.
"On the plus side, how about Logan Wilson?"
Really liking Wilson. Kid has good instincts. Always around the action it seems
Lamar is making some severely questionable decisions
"Fuck yeah Wilson, way to hunt!"
Our d has been ok today. If we could put a drive or two together this would at least look respectable
QUIT CUTTING TO SAD AJ ON THE SIDELINE ITS VERY DEPRESSING TO SEE
Just a bad bad throw.
what the fuck was that late hit on burrow that went unflagged
Did we just send sample deep down the sideline?
You guys think we'd do better if we did that one thing Jon Bois made? Just run 1 play where 1 receiver runs around trying to get open while every other single player drops back to block?
WE'RE GOING FOR THE SACK RECORD BABY
Sam hubbard just broke his arm in case anyone missed it
"https://twitter.com/Kyle_Smith1087/status/1315370059313881088?s=19

Here's the Green trade lip reading, I can't tell that he said it tbh"
Forward progress had stopped
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
We are playing a good team and we are not. I think we were all hoping for something this sunday but deep down we knew..... we knew.
Love how AJ and Ross are simultaneously absolute fucking bums but somehow someone will want to trade anything of value for them
NOT A SHUT OUT!
Bring out Fat Randy to avoid the shut out lol
"can't hold the football? he's not scrambling around there for 20 seconds you incompetent fool he's running for his life.

what's he supposed to do, just sit down and take the big sack every drive? or make every pass a throwaway?"
ZT is a giant Pussy
"God this game is a shitshow. Our long beloved vets are looking embarrassing, our o-line is back to unbelievable trash, our defense can't get a stop on third down, receivers are slipping and giving up on plays, even Burrow is looking flustered and making terrible decisions. Like, I get that AJ didn't try to stop that interception, but there is no world where that was a good decision by Burrow."
"Welp. Shutout, aj green wants to be traded, sam hubbard broke his arm, dj reader carted off the field, joe burrow looks like a rookie... This is a bad, bad, week."
"Bills fan here,

Cheering heavily for you guys and hoping Burrows pulls some Andy Dalton magic against the shit birds."
Oh yeah I forgot the Ravens have a marching band.
Not mad at the call to go for it just wish he saw Higgins
Why would you give up the deeper route on 3and 14
I see our Offensive line has resumed their quest to kill Joe after taking last week off.
This announcer calling Jackson “Murray” over and over again is too much
"Horrible decision from Burrow but come on 18, you have to at least pretend like you’re paying attention and making an effort on that play"
That so soft
Sorry but Dunlap is not good enough to warrant playing time
AJ Green should not be anywhere near a football field *stephen a voice*
I know Zac is going to want to call a thousand passes after this drive to catch up but I say give it to mixon
Should of hired Bieniemy
Dumb ass announcer. He took a shot because it was offsides.
Anyone wanna play some cards? Maybe go for a walk?
"""What do you think about the execution of your offensive line?""

""Yes please."""
Are we on the fire Zach Taylor train yet ?
We got a fourth down stop? I’m buying a lotto ticket today.
Here's the opportunity to switch momentum.
"Makes you wonder what this team did all week, because they definitely didn’t prepare"
Ravens really haven't forgiven us since beating them in primetime in 2018.
"It's not even the blitzes beating the line, it's 3 or 4 man rushes where 2 men still get to Burrow. Actually pathetic."
These plays are too long developing. We needed a game plan like the other games. But here we are trying to stretch the field when Burrow has no time
Well the silver lining is that this is probably pretty good closure for Dalton
"The sad thing about all of this is.

Lamar Jackson has made 3-4 horrible throws already that were interception worthy this game, were just not good enough to capitalize on them."
You guys think Lamar isn't running because the Ravens told him not to because he's dinged up? Like he's not running by choice?
Out only hope is a TD here and 2nd half adjustments
Ah there’s our 2nd and long run. Was wondering when that would happen.
When are we going to figure out that we can't block 7 guys with 5?
We've nailed our draft picks tho
RUN THE GODDAMN BALL
What a flaccid performance
Well that was quick. Way to squander that interception.
Play calling is abysmal
I can’t watch this play calling anymore. This is trash
"Ngl, we always do be a second half team"
The Bengals always call timeout and the opponent always converts
This CBS broadcast needs work. Broadcast team didn’t do their homework and they’re missing easy details. We’ve also missed the start of multiple plays
"HOLY CRAP, THEY DIDN'T SCORE AT THE END OF THE HALF"
Surprised how well D is playing
Defense did it's best despite being handed shit situations. I didn't expect our offense to look *this* bad.
The only bright spot I can find is that this rookie class have looked tight.
Wilson is playing really well
Ravens fans trying to kid themselves that Lamar isn't going to fold again as soon as he plays a decent team in the playoffs
"This game sucks, but there’s certainly hope for the future with Burrow and Higgins."
This just a nightmare
Got sacked in 1 second
This oline is trash
This game is Dave Shula-Era bad.
I feel like our o-linemen have bad peripheral vision
Commentators are the worst. Jerking off to that Jackson scramble that still resulted in an incompletion.
My eyes hurt
The most anxiety inducing fumble I've seen in awhile
Burrow needs to take the bengals to court for attempted murder by means of this offensive line
"Defense is just tired , can’t blame them .. been on the field all game and played pretty fantastic"
"Defense has played SO WELL today. If the offensive could have done anything at all we would be right in this game.

I wish we could just string together 4 quarters where the offensive AND defense play well.

It seems like every week it's one or the other."
Burrow is going to learn a lot about playing QB in the NFL from this one.
This is just sad man. If I was Burrow/Mixon I would publicly call out the line/coaches. You have the ability to do that. So pathetic from the o-line.
Lol
"tfw our ""fuck it"" offense is doing better than our actual offense"
"I cherish watching our O-line, from a safe distance, gaze upon Joe Mixon running into a pile of Ravens."
wasn't that helmet to helmet?
Just miss it Randy fuck it
"3 points in this game, feels like a participation award."
AJ quitting on a jump ball. Some things never change.
Burrow is gonna get hurt. He’s getting hit on every play. Fire. Jim. Turner. Now.
Wow this is trash tier level play calling
Fuck off ZT. What a fucking pussy.
"And there it is. His arm is clearly hurt.

Who had game 5?"
Burrow has no chance. I wish he’d pull a Tom Brady and start cussing everyone out when they mess up.
"This fake crowd noise is annoying AF, just screaming"
To be fair...that was a hell of a play by Humphries. Wish we did that.
Boys I hope I’m wrong but I feel like our cheeks finna get clapped
Who else is stoked to see that Lawson-Reader-Atkins-Hubbard line in action today??
"I FUCKING BOUGHT AN HDTV BECAUSE I CORD CUT AND NOW I CAN WATCH BENGALS GAMES IN HD! Sorry for the caps, I'm drunk, high, and excited. Who dey!"
Bengals will win 33-16
Nice little pitch and catch to Sample on the first play
Let’s just go Madden style and run 5 wide all game lmao
FUCK SO CLOSE
"Except for the one play, that was actually serviceable D, secondary looks good so far."
"Thx for trying to jinx Tucker anyway, Ian"
"Great that we only held them to 3.

Bend don't break."
Joe “Lamar Jackson” Burrow
"Just go for it. It’s the Ravens, take some chances."
Higgins was wide open
Let's go Bengals! Fuck the Ravens!
Challenge that spot if they are giving them that. Two bad spots now
That was not a first bs
"How do you not challenge that spot.

Come on Taylor do your job"
"I mean, we all knew that was going to Mark Andrews and still couldn’t stop it"
This third down defense reminds me of the teryl austin year
Lou is so bad. This guy can never get a stop.
"“I think Mike Brown liked that too, saved some money on balls.” 

Only Mike brown would be the butt of a ball finances joke."
Anyone else sick of these dumbasses talking about balls
"O line blows two protections.

LBS blow contain for huge play.

Lou's D can't stop on 3rd down.

Taylor doesn't challenge obvious play.


The 4 horsemen of Bengals weaknesses are playing true to form today.

Edit: jesus make that 3 completely blown aasignments. This o line man"
Terrible play calling by Zac
Lol our oline still fucking sucks
It'd be nice to see AJ actually not quit on a route.
AJ Green really trying for that 1 year vet minimum contract next year
Do penalties not offset anymore?
Aj is washed sucks to say
Thats a weak ass call
How is that automatically declined and not offsetting?
What no offsetting penalties? Wtf
"Hey that Andrew's guy is pretty good, maybe we should guard him."
Aj the new ross
Wait how tf did Baltimore’s penalty get declined but ours still stands?
"Idc really care about losing this game, but man Lou is so bad at his job."
Y’all remember USC firing Lane Kiffin literally as soon as he stepped out of the airplane when they got back to LA following a loss - Is that too much to ask for Lou at this point?
Did the commentators not realize it was a free play?
This is a massacre
We are looking to go too far downfield and we cant do that with the pressure they are putting on. Quick release passes is the way to go.
"This is literal torture. I had low expectations already, but holy shit..."
Next year we need to completely overhaul the OL through the draft and FA. Not one guy should be safe.
"i love the bengals and will always be a fan, but sometimes for the sake of my own mental health and happiness, i just have to shut games like this off for the day."
"Harbaugh a bitch for that call, I hope we make them pay."
Pretty typical AFC North game where we piss our pants and forget who we are for 3 hours. I'll never understand why this Organization is incapable of ever showing up or even be slightly competitive for big games.
Hart literally just stands there and watched a burrow die
Jim Turner doesn't just need to be fired at this point. He needs to be exiled from football. Somehow this is the worst line we've ever had.
I never thought I would actually want Ryan Finley to play.... but here we are...  Burrow is going to die out there
Are they blitzing every play?
ZT really outdid himself there on that drive. Impeccable play calling. My favorite was that 2nd and 13 run that totally didn’t catch them off guard.
"Lamar Jackson is the James Harden of the NFL.

Kills all of the shitty teams during the season. Won't get it done in the playoffs."
I love logan wilson
Lol this commentator is awful
"Okay I know we're getting blown out so I have no room to talk, but does anyone else think lamar jackson is looking really bad? He's not running effectively, and I feel like he's been really inaccurate except on a handful of throws"
Oh god dam joe plz be ok
Defense figured out how you gotta play Lamar.
How is someone unblocked every play
"Chances tucker gets ""double"" calf cramps?"
John Ross should be a better marquise brown
We got this bros. Clearly the Ravens are barely hanging on
Do we score at all? I don’t think so.
"Anyone else hear announcer say “They’re [Bengals O line) protecting ok they just can’t get open down the field”??

Did I mishear that ? Lol"
Phil Simms sounding real dumb saying the Bengals are blocking okay
How are we ONLY down 17?
I’m excited for Logan Wilson. He looks good
"ZT has wins against the following coaches:

Gase 
Kitchens 
Marrone"
Why DO you keep saying Murray?!
Thought they were gonna call personal foul for lightly grazing by Lamar
Just imagine the cap hell we would be in if we signed AJ to a 4-5 year deal
If burrow had the amount of time that Jackson has we’d never lose
Omg look we actually run north south and get 5 yards. Stop the quick pitch bullshit our line can’t pull for shit
Our defense needs a pick 6 that’s our only hope rn
Burrow jersey is covered in dirt
Reader goes out and they immediately gash where would have been
If we could get the offense and defense to both show up to the same game that'd be great.
Burrow is rattled
AJ Green now talking about he wants traded. Nobody will take him
How many sacks is that? NFL Record is 12 in one game
So how hot is Zac's seat now?
We could have 6 picks today
We should 6 ints right now
Fire Jim Turner now.
This all spiraled out of control when ZT called that rollout play in the first drive.
"Hahahahhahahahahahahahahahaha

Fuck this goddamn team"
Jim Turner is a con man
First offense in the league to score -7 points in a game
If this were an actual close game that fumble would probably have ruined my day. At this point all I can say is it was a great play by the defender to knock the ball free.
This is why I drink
I’m ok with losing with a rookie qb if it’s fun to watch. This is not even a little fun to watch and was a complete waste of 3 hours
Hey! A quick pass goes for 10 yards? Where the hell has that been all day?
Maybe if we get the first pick in the draft for the next 22 years we can replace our whole team!!!
the refs have been handing out 1st downs all game if you get close to it.
Nice throw and catch :(
"I, for one, am not minding these garbage time Joe Mixon fantasy points."

Ravens got lucky
"Good job defense, fuck everything else"
Member when just getting Jonah back was supposed to fix the line. I 'member.
Ok gumble time to hang it up
Locking down that 2021 #1 pick baby!!
Hippity hoppity I want my life to stoppity.
"Good god zebras, I get y’all are protecting QB’s but this is still a fucking contact sport"
Clearly Burrow knew it was a free play and the announcers are trying to shit all over him for a pick that he knew wouldn't count.
Damn 0-14-1 on the road in the last 15 games?? Fire ZT!!!
"Yo AJ, you fall asleep or something right there, buddy?"
What the fuck is AJ doing? Dude is fucking donezo.
"Taylor’s seat has gotta be warming up, right? This team is pathetic"
This is the worst fucking football game I've ever watched
Zac the fuck face Taylor needs to just run Mixon a metric fuck ton from here on out. The oline cannot stop the Ravens.
[removed]
I wish he missed that. Fucking pathetic
Taylor really just called 3 straight runs to kick a field goal
Fire ZT please
"I'm working, but from home.

I got a fresh pot of coffee, stream up, $5 on the Bengals, and you guys.

Sundays are great."
Bates is gonna be an All-pro this year.
Bates is a g
I know he didn’t get the first on that but that was a wild run lol
Is Zac Taylor the best waterboy in the league?
Why dude keep calling him murray😂
Wtf was Hubbard doing there?
Hoping they jinx him with that interception stat
Can we just fire Anarumo holy fuck
CAN WE GET A THIRD AND LONG STOP PLEASE HOLY SHIT
I feel like we haven’t had a good 3rd down defense since like 2010
Why is every 3rd down getting over a ft added to the spot? Wtf
Wtf 59
This is going to be a long day boys.
You have to get a TD on this drive or this one will run away. Defense had so many opportunities to get off the field. God they are trash on 3rd down
"Lou, for the love of god utilize a sliver of common sense & give Vonn some help. Vonn in single coverage on andrews in the red zone is the dumbest coverage possible"
So who was the LB who decided to try to block a throw from the side instead of sacking his ass?
Is Atkins playing or not? I'm not seeing him out there
Does Burrow overthrow or are our receivers that fucking slow?
"lol at mike liking that because it ""saves some money on balls"""
"Can't beat the Browns, can't beat the Ravens, can't beat the Steelers. This is going to be a long few years."
Lol this line is absolute ass across the board man. Even the guys we give credit here and there are well below average.
Weak
Pussy ass shit
That’s fucking garbage
Brady effect coming in for Jackson.
Wtf what a weak ass call. Swear on everything ref said penalties on both sides but only ours enforced? Must've misheard I guess
Is anybody really surprised the ravens are kicking our ass?
This game is over boys. 3-13 is still on the board.
"Alright, not today. Nope. I'm gonna go be productive."
Shitty ball spots on the last drive for the ravens and a bullshit 15 yarder on Dunlap. Fuck this league
Tate on Tate
Lmao literally every week the commentators shit on us for having the TE block a top pass rusher
Still confused on why we make mixon run inside every time
This is hard to watch lol
"So our oline sucks, dline sucks and our WR cant get open? This a L"
"When we block 7 against 5 rushers, yeah nobody is gonna be open."
AJ looks hella defeated
"Typical Bengals, look competent for a game and then come and look like you don't belong on a football field the next game."
Can't watch anymore. Hurts to see Burrow being ruined like this.
Really wish we had gone after Eric Bieniemy instead of Zac Taylor.  Shame he'll probably land in Houston now
If Taylor doesn't make changes at coaching staff removing Turner and Lou at this end of this season... I'm kinda done with him.
Holy shit we made a 3rd down stop
Lou adjusting. Bringing extra pressure finally. Now ravens will adjust
"Defense isn’t playing bad 

Yeah they have 17 points but the defense can’t get off the field"
This line can't do shit right
Redmond back up to game speed
There’s the Alex Redmond I know!
Murder a ref. Somebody.
It's sad that a flag against us is pretty much required to have a good play.
If I was Burrow I’d be booking a plane to take off at halftime. Fucking embarrassing
"Get him out of there. He's going to get hurt if this keeps up. 

At least start moving the pocket so hes not a sitting duck."
Bruh for my sanity I gotta stop watching our boy take this abuse lol pray for him
"All I want is for us to win a game against a good team.

Is that too much to ask?"
Jeeze - just concerned with Joe. He's going to get hurt
Bobby Hart failed his Wendy training and somehow got a job as a starting guard
This may be a dumb question… But I keep seeing everyone say burrow throw it away but he’s literally surrounded… Wouldn’t throwing it away be more susceptible to a pick? Not that a sack is any better or burrow dying…
I knew this was an l but this is demoralizing lol
"Well time to turn this game off and getting ready for my second disappointment of the Sunday at 730 at Nippert.  

When do the Cyclones come back?  This town needs a winner."
The defense is playing a decent game at least. Doing well against the run
Sometimes the Bengals defense shows flashes of excellence. But most of the time it's like there's nothing
"Burrow needs to have a long conversation with Andrew Luck about what happens when you’re an unbelievably talented QB drafted by a franchise that refuses to protect you. 

If we don’t get line help this offseason burrow would be wise to pull a Carson Palmer and force a trade out of town, unless he wants to be Andrew Luck 2.0"
“The pass is... COMPLETE” -Greg Gumbel on Lamar Jackson throwing an interception
Lol that pass is complete. Yeah to the Defense. These announcer did not prepare for this week
That pass is complete? What game are you watching announcer?
They need to take Burrow OUT holy shit he’s GOING to get hurt
Get Burrow the fuck outta there!
KEEP BLITZING
LOL what was that 10 seconds off the clock??
"The defense has done as much as they can possibly do, they gotta be gassed"
This offensive line is worse than the old lost decade ones that featured Rod Jones
Is burrow hurt?
Honestly... kinda feel bad for our defense...
This coaching staff is bottom of the NCAA league. 3rd and 10 take a timeout wide open wr for Ravens. They don't have any clue at all.
Signing Jim Turner to a long contract extension must be accomplished before halftime is over!
We finally didn’t give up points before a half & all it took was a missed 61 yard field goal!
Bengals Seahawks anniversary come back?  Let's go!
Pick 6 for us to start the second half please!
FUCK YOU RAIN WE HAD THAT INTERCEPTION
Starting to like Wilson more and more. Pass coverage and awareness of passing zones is damned good for a rookie who essentially no offseason.
Defense is solid today so far that's a bright spot
"If Waynes plays as advertised then we have a good secondary, coverage sacks so far all year"
Biggest takeaway... run defense has stepped up. Defense is still pretty bad but it is way better than last year. And Logan Wilson is a player.
Feel bad for Mixon
RG never saw that guy run by him
Ouch...
Can we also say how good Huber has been this year
Anybody else turn off the game? I’m going to get some wings.
God do I even bother turning on the game against the Steelers.
Has Logan been the best rookie LB this year?
How many times is he going to call him Murray lmaooo
I really thought they were about to call unnecessary roughness for touching Lamar when he went down. Cincinnati sports have scarred me.
how about another joke Murray?
And now DJ is down. Great.
Please no not DJ
goodbye everyone I'll remember you all in therapy
The A.J. Green era is over.
"*throws incomplete pass*

“That was a coverage sack.”


This commentary is soooo bad LOL"
"I’m as frustrated as anyone about AJ’s lack of effort on the Int earlier, but seeing this sub hate on him is the worst. This guy’s HOF career was ravaged by injuries. He’s the best Bengals player of the last 30 years. We can be upset that he looks lost, but he doesn’t deserve the hate."
Defense not giving up. That's nice to see.
He threw the fucken ball away. Is Gannon watching the same game he's announcing
Come on burrow. That would have been a big gain for mixon.
You guys think we will score any points this game?
"Looks like we got away with a false start, I’ll take it"
I hope we are just  trying to get turner fired
"""score or go home"" alright let's just get a 3 yard gain"
I'm not excited for a week of BENGALS ALREADY RUINING BURROW? headlines
Thats two picks in their 30 that have been dropped...... f
AJ is just not himself. Those zero effort plays should never happen
Play calling is complete trash
They’re running so Joe B doesn’t die
LOL
Good grief
Lmfao
What a shit show
Finally had some momentum :(
This sucks but it was a lose as is.  Regroup for next week.
God this crowd noise is so obnoxious.
Fat Randy Offensive Player of the Game
Not sure what’s worse going for the field goal to save face or not going for it in what was a fucking shit show of a game anyways fire this fucking incompetent staff
Alright forget my earlier comment. Fire them all. That’s pathetic.
"AJ GrEeN jUsT nEeDs TiME

Green is washed up. Sorry."
I’m over AJ Green tbh. He is a liability on the field this season
"AJ is still great to be on the field to take the #1 cb, idk that Boyd and Higgins are as effective without that"
So Jacksonville is absolutely terrible
"Look how Mark Andrews prevented an interception, if only AJ Green would do that."
"Carson Palmer came back from 17 points against the Ravens in his first year. 

https://www.espn.com/nfl/game?gameId=241205033

LETS GO BURROW"
I HATE when teams go for a low percentage play on 4th down. God just get the 4 yards. We don’t need 20
Fire Lou fire Zach fire Jim
"Reader's knee. He looked to be in pretty good amount of pain. So he can join Waynes on the Free Agency Big Contract IR fun. 

Team is fucking cursed."
"Three times we throw quickly on third and long and get 4-6 yards, why the fuck aren’t we doing that on first and second down?"
John Ross wouldn't have even caught that ball so he never could have fumbled. #firezactaylor
"This team conceded before the fourth quarter even started. No sense of urgency at any point with play calling. 

I get they had been beaten down all game, but that in itself is a lack of competence at the coaching level.. Zac Taylor needs to go."
DID HE REALLY GO FOR A FIELD GOAL DOWN BY 27 AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHH
It's time for the Zac Taylor experiment to end.
God I fucking hate waiting til 1PM. Love when I’m out west for the weekend and the Bengals come on at 10 or 11
"Here we go. Lets be competitive at least and you never know, AJ might put another Baltimore killing performance."
"Great awareness right there, Joe.

Guarantee Dalton would have thrown that away."
Ah shit here we go again
Sam has been getting so much pressure this year but can never  finish the sack
Hey I'll take it
Nice play on the ball by Bates!
Damnit Tucker stop being the best kicker
Billy Price getting hyped on the sideline. Keep the energy boys.
Goddamn. Impressive run but what the flying fuck.
ugh 6 inches too high
Should of just done some quick slants
Look at Bates scaring Brown out of bounds. What a beast.
Next years draft better be edge rushers and OL.
Zero pass rush whatsoever
I’m jealous of their offensive line
Good job by phillips.
Our run D has been looking...good? Too bad we keep blowing third downs
Murray lol
lol where was Hubbard going
Ravens can just fuck around on 1st and 2nd and convert 3rd every time
not sure why bates didnt stay on andrews there
MURAAAAAAAAYYY!
Yet another generous ass spot there
Generous spot for the first down.
"As a Bills fan, that spot reminds me of Patriots Bills games. Crooked."
3rd down? Ah I see it's touchdown time
Murray to Andrews 😒
God fuck this 3rd down defense.
Andrew carries lamar in the passing game so hard
Vonn Bell has not been good
Anyone know who that was that blitzed but didn't go near lamar?
LET’S GO GET A TD
"Well, I'll see you all for next week's ass kicking."
I feel awful for anyone who started Mixon today.
Ugly
Low effort all around. Typical bengal bullshit
You gotta get rid of AJ
Damn AJ at least TRY to push the guy away
Sure do miss the days when we would smack the Ravens at Baltimore.
Why is AJ still on the field man. He just gives up
Why is ineligible receiver declined by rule?
Joe has to be looking around going “what the fuck is a wrong with with everyone?”
I just feel bad about getting destroyed because I don't want Joe to be sad :(
"God damn, way to shed that sack, Joe."
"No worries, just grab our QB by the head."
"who the hell was that, that just hugged boyd its like he was thinking ""you just saved me job"" kind of hug"
My desk is about to have a My Head-shaped hole in it.
from 2nd and short to 3rd and long..
How is that not unnecessary roughness?
expectations were low but holy fuck
Whew it's gonna be a long game...
Burrow has to learn to avoid hits and throw it away. This line can't protect him and there not going to get better. Unfortunately burrow is going to have to adapt or he's going to get hurt.
I just feel bad for Burrow at this point
So do you ever wonder if Mike Brown watches the OL during these games? I do sometimes...
Are the announcers really shit talking burrow LMAO stfu and keep calling Lamar Jackson by the wrong name dumbass
"I wish our O-Line had the heart of Gio blocking, that fucker puts his damn soul into it."
Zac Taylor sis he’s comfortable with this O Line. Re signed Bobby Hart
Nice stop!
Nice a 4th down stop
"Neither turnover was great from Burrow but I think it shows game awareness that both of them came on 3rd down in  a game where we need a bit of luck to win. So extending the play or throwing up a hope of a ball on 3rd might look worse than it is

Hes also getting no help but hes looked a bit like a rookie today."
If Lamar could actually throw we'd be in more trouble than we're already in.
I like how Von was wagging a finger in Andrews face like Andrews isn’t frying him
Ah yes I remember Redmond and the constant holding calls he gets
This is a joke
Bobby hart might not be good guys
How burrows still bouncing around I have no idea ...
Take burrow out he’s gonna die
"Ravens are going to pile up 10 sacks today, aren't they?"
I see the classic holding killing 100% of Bengals drives will continue on
Haven’t seen geno out there once
If you go to the ravens thread all their fans are amazed  of how bad or o-line is
Baltimore's coverage is super tight while at the same time they're getting crazy pressure. This is just complete offensive dysfunction.
At least the defense looks competent
Either our defense or our offense looks good. Apparently it can’t be both.
Erickson is so slooooow
PICK OMG!!!
Bruh this announcer is so fucking bad. Actual moron
Wilson's second int this year
Good on Wilson
"That was a 9 second drive.

The line is SO bad. Burrow has no time to throw."
"Like I said, It’s weird to see Burrow and company playing like shit and the Defense playing pretty well..."

I 100% assume he's making this kick
I didnt expect to win this game obviously but this is really ugly
"lolol am i crazy ..

or does It seems like bengals fans really like Justin Tucker?"
Off topic but it's hilarious the anti-Kate Schroeder green new deal commercial uses the national petroleum agency's green new deal fact sheet as it's source for the job loss claims
I hate this Think We Can campaign.
Does anybody remember the last time the bengals D got a pick 6?? Because I don’t
Andddd it’s raining
Does the commentator not realize our only W was in the rain? We boutta take over!
I’ve been impressed with defense so far
We need to revamp the offensive line the way we revamped the linebackers last year
Please let us get a TD
Take it to the crib Tee!
Ridiculous
"That’s why gio is on the field over mixon

Edit: on third down"
We are giving Burrow his worst game
Dude has said Murray like 7 times today.
"For the millionth time today, they’ve referred to Lamar as Murray"
"Bengals are about to be the only team in an 8 play teaser of 1pm games that loses for me because their offensive line is absolutely garbage. The defense is trying, but man. Burrow is getting murdered out there. 19 points looks like it might not be enough."
Reader looked hurt...
Hahahahaha what's the fucking point anymore
How do you get stiff armed by someone that weights 150 lbs
Football is stupid anyways
AJ gone too
"Readers knee done. Carted off. AJ Green done for the day. Hammy. 

Should shut him down, put him on the trading block and get something for nothing."
Joe was bound to look like a rookie eventually. We aren’t near the Ravens level. We suck yall
Defense is really playing well against Lamar. He looks clueless at times.
Reader goes off and the Ravens have the sense to run it. This is going to be even worse...
They should be winning 40-0
Ffs Joe
my poor boy is shook
"I don’t quite fall into the camp of fire everyone however, I am wondering at what point this season if it continues like this do we see changes? Does Zac get fired?"
What kind of play is that? We need 25. Not 2.5.
This is pathetic.
just turned back and Joe gets sack again
I swear this team drops more picks than anyone else
Gotta make that play
Receivers can’t separate for shit. Put Green on the IR and bring ross back.
"I've been very impressed by the linebackers since week 1. Yes there were mutliple should've been picks, but in years past those would have been 1st downs for the other team so it's something."
"* Bengals 2021 Offseason Priorities: Replace everybody on the Offensive Line besides LT Jonah Williams, spend money in Free Agency and or Use Draft Capital.

Letting Joe Burrow get Sacked and Hit this much is just unacceptable. This O-Line is so bad that they allowed 3 sacks by Cornerbacks against Baltimore Week 5.  They've now allowed 32 Sacks and 70 QB Hits through 9 games this season. That puts him on pace for a getting sacked 57 times this season."
Zac Taylor's inexperience is clear as day. Just wow.
We're still running......
Taylor what is the point of that running play. Its been done 10 times for 10 losses.
Has time....first down. Almost like there's a correlation
Getting a TD will be a win in my book
Well
And there’s the cherry on top of it all
Smh
Pain
lol cow of the week
That was the best Ravens touchdown drive of the game.
"I’m not even upset about it, at this point I find humor in it"
Looks like Baltimore respecced out of the running tree and allocated all the skill points to the pass rush for this game.
Apologize for this game jack off
Why the fuck are we running out of shotgun on 3rd and 1
Playing for pride now. Get a TD
"Inb4 Baltimore challenges ball spot again

Edit: Nevermind, refs did it for us"
Hopefully the Ravens let us run one of those plays where everyone pretends to tackle the person running the ball so they feel good about scoring a TD.
Clean house
Just put up the post thread already
Its finally over
"Tap Lamers shoulder: 15 yard penalty 

Steamroll Burrow after he throws it: *Crickets*"
On a positive note we most likely won’t have to trade up to get Sewell!
Eric Bieniemy should of been hired as the HC....Zac Taylor is a joke and don’t think I can watch this team any longer as long as he’s the head coach
"I genuinely hate the Zac Taylor hire. I can't comprehend how anyone can support it. He has absolutely no head coaching experience and he has not had any success anywhere he has been, outside of bringing Sean McVay his water when he was thirsty. Literally any college head coach would be better at this point."
Cant believe CBS thought the fucking garbage Raiders vs the Chiefs is a better national game then Burrow Vs Jackson. NFL desperately giving LV exposure its sad.
A one arm shove followed by a flop? Has the nfl turned into European football?
"It's time to rebuild. As much as I hate to say it, get rid of AJ Green, Dunlap, Atkins, Gio, etc. We have no chance of winning this division with anything close to the team we have. It's not 2015 anymore."
Let's see how many times AJ green quits this series.
Looks like Burrow was bitching at the ref to call a low hit on him.
Mark andrews showing aging AJ how it's done.
Just embarrassing. Fade me.
Burrow isn't finishing the season.
Joe's arm is hurt...fuck...
All aboard the fire ZT train
Lamar getting exposed by THIS D?
Burrow is shook. Not a good game from him today.
F to all those who took bengals +13.5
"I hate ravens coach. Goes for 4th and 6 up 17-0, challenges ball placement when up 27-0. 
Get fucked dork"
Everyone saying trade AJ is hilarious. A bag of peanuts has more trade value than AJ
Wtf is that play call?  Man fire zach
THE BENGALS SCORED!!!!
Thank god for the 3 pity points. ZT needed to make sure he wasn't shutout.
Mike Brown must of cum hard when he asked ZT what his salary requirements would be
How about a fucking screen against these all out biltzs? Zac Taylor is the worst coach in the NFL.
Remember when we barely beat the Jaguars and thought we had a chance against the ravens?
"At this point I'm so fucking sick of AJ. Like I love him to death and will respect everything he did for this team forever, but if he's just not even gonna try get his ass out of here."
"Jesus christ aj if you're not going to even TRY to run the route AT LEAST try to tackle the fucking guy.

Bench him. And that hurts to say that"
At least I started Andrews in fantasy today?
Put Dunlap back on the bench. Selfish me first attitude putting his team in a worse position than they’re already in
We're gonna absolutely ruin that poor young man. This hurts to watch.
Joe is gonna haul ass out of Cincinnati as soon as he gets the chance
"And we need to seriously start looking to trade Green, Dunlap, and Atkins"
"God, you fucking hate to see that happen to your franchise QB."
So Zac in the hot seat rn?
Lol its so painful being a fan of this team.
At some point Zack Taylor needs to win some fucking games
So that wasn’t a fun ride. And I want off. Please fire Zac Taylor and Jim Turner and leave them in Baltimore
Poor joe.  I love him man.  Let's get him some protection- fuck you mike brown
There’s no stress for Bengals HC. ZT is here for at least 8 more seasons
I’m done with the Taylor experiment
All kidding aside. I genuinely feel bad for Joe Burrow.
We’re either gonna get blown out to infinity or pull the biggest upset
"After seeing the Chiefs handle the Ravens, I hope we come out super aggressive taking shots down the field trying to jump out to an early lead."
I feel like an upset is in the air. 28-20 Bengals
"This day, in October of 2020, Joseph Burrow claims his rightful path to the crown. Zeus and Thor know he is the the true ruler of Valhalla."
"Let's goooo! We got this shit!

#WHO DEY"
"Wow, Reigning MVP hasn't beaten the No1 pick since 2005."
Think that was a designed run. Good idea to at least put that in their heads
Beautiful punt
Welp
"Yep, that's about how I expect the whole game to go."
Bates is a stud
Too bad Justin tucker exists
"Was that third down Carlos Dunlap “trying extra hard”? Jesus, he looks like he couldn’t care less"
BATES BATES BATES
I’m late to the party. How’d the offense look?
Upsets happen when the favorite takes FG instead of TD. #WhoDey
Damn burrow that was nice
"Early but our o line actually looks decent so far

Edit and then completely blows an assignment on the next play. Nevermind."
Higgins was wide open?
It could be the angle but...it looks like Boyd just had to close his hands lol
"Whew, Andrews went flying."
Man we've had a like 3 solid opportunities for a pick so far today
I know they’re marching but I do feel like our Defense is playing well
"Either our players are trash, or Lou is that bad as a DC"
Poor job by bates there
"Cool, got a S who can't cover a TE"
This defense is just so frustrating
mark andrews had at least 3 third down conversions that drive
"Who is this Andrews, maybe we should cover him"
So that spot for the first down was bullshit. But they most likely would have went for it on fourth down and got it. So whatever.
"Why don't we go for the sack?

Just tell me why?"
If we quad cover Andrews on those third downs maybe we can stop the conversions...
Four third down conversions on that drive?
I bet Mark Andrew's acts like a bitch off the field
Hey how about we scheme to stop the only person on their team who is getting targets?
Joe Burrow vs the world
"Here’s the thing, I understand why they would’ve told the defensive ends to contain instead of sack. You don’t want Lamar running on you. However this plan only works if Lamar can’t throw. Lamar is the MVP and can throw the damn ball. I’d rather rush him and make him have to get to the marker."
Boy this got ugly fast
Just plain ugly. This about to get out of hand fast.
FML
hahaha we suck
Get rid of all our vets
Lmao what the fuck
This is absolutely hilarious.  Could they be any worse?
"Lawson got obliterated by Lamar there. What a stiff arm
Edit: was Wilson not Lawson"
Can we put in mike Thomas over AJ? At least he looks like an nfl reciever.
"At least we will have a bunch of room under the salary cap once we get rid of AJ and Dunlap.

Hopefully we spend like we did this offseason"
We still can't defend TEs can we?
I'm sad lol
"Secondary not going to cover anyone, I'm out"
Still waiting for this Zac Taylor offensive ingenuity...
Burrow is going to die today
There's Drew Sample trying to block an edge rusher again
Who won the coin toss? Do we get the ball to start the 2nd half?
If we could give burrow fucking 3 seconds per dropback we could be playing 500 ball
Free play??
If you're not even going to try and protect Burrow just sit him.
Jesus fucking Christ
Ill be impressed if we lose by less than 30
Oh goddddd
This is what I feared today would be.
Think Joe knew that was a free play at least I hope so. AJ also just gave up again. Immensely disappointed in AJ this game.
I don't know how long I can watch this...
"At least it’s a learning experience, right?"
This is the game that would get the coaching staff fired on any sensible team. I expect to read that Brown has extended all their contracts tomorrow.
"I didn't see the start. Is it boomer on colour commentary? 
He's really enjoying shitting on Burrow today. 
The OL is massively outmatched by the ravens D here"
That blindside hit hurt *me*. Somebody get Burrow some protection!
So where are the idiots that would take Ja'Marr Chase over Penei Sewell?
All I want is a good pass rush
Nice stop!!
"Ok, here we go. Turning this game around NOW."
Well that's good at least
Stupidity runs in the Harbaugh family
Make Baltimore pay for their arrogance on going for it on 4th and 6 up by 17 points
"Just one touchdown please

Just one"
I just need Joe to make a successful drive so he doesn't get too into his head...but damn man has 0 time
Penalties are why nobody signed Redmond
2nd and forever.  Nice.
Oof
"Great, we can't even count on Jonah now"
"No excuses, get burrow out"
They are getting sacks and not even sending a blitz. Standard 4 man rush.
So how bout that terrible Ravens pass rush?
Looked like a little late hit on burrow on 2nd down.
Guess I can go back playing among us and this garbage off
It feels like beating a dead horse at this point but this O-Line is just fucking sad lmao...
Dominated on both sides of the ball. This is a rough one
I'm not having fun
[deleted]
"I bet the o line comes out looking better in the 2nd half like they have the rest of the games, idk why this is a thing, but this is the first game the other team capitalized on it, and Burrow getting hit extra"
Why is it every time we play an AFC North team we are absolutely the Clampetts?!
Man we making this Ravens D look like it's straight outta of the year 2000
Do you people not understand that you don't turn a franchise around overnight?  Anyone who thinks the current Bengals with their non-existent o-line and defense would somehow hang with the Ravens doesn't know much about football.
"Zac Taylor wins: dumpster fire Jets, dumpster fire Browns, and a bad Jacksonville team."
Defense might score before the offense if the blitz keeps getting to Lamar
I'm starting to think we aren't very good.
Our defense just choked but tbh they haven't been that bad.  The o is straight garbage
I just can never understand ZT playcalling. Like we dont have the line to get any yardage on 3rd down. Like why are we running there?
He wouldve been gone!!
The only thing performing worse than the Bengals offense is Gumble.
IS THAT A LINEBACKER MAKING A PLAY? LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOO
Wilson! Damn good coverage!
Can you fuckers block for once
Get ready for some 2nd and long runs
"I cant watch the game at work; is price, williams, and hart playing.. What they lookin like"
Terrible fucking plays
"Ah yes, that’s definitely the play to call & the route to run when we need 10 fucking yards lmao"
"60 yard attempt, let’s see it"
"Really wish the hot seat whispers would heat up on Zac Taylor.

He has no concept of situational play calling"
"Silver lining is that the defense has actually looked pretty solid. Only giving up 3 scores on 7 Baltimore possessions, one of which started at the Bengals 12 yard line."
"Woke up early to clean my house and get ready to watch the bengals. I was in a super good mood and ready to watch the game. Put on my Burrow Jersey, and cracked open a beer. Now I am wearing sweatpants, and gonna take a nap. Can’t watch this crap."
This team is single handedly destroying my liver
Get your bets in now. The o/u on 2nd and long runs (9+ to go) is set at 2.5
Anyone else just seeing a screen with both teams logos?
Is Josh Kline a serial killer or is there a reason we haven't just dropped 10 million on his desk
"Side note that doesn’t really matter, this is some of the worst commentary I’ve ever heard"
Oh my godddd how was that not a pick
3 and out! 3 and out!
OK let’s see the second half adjustments…
Now in the last 4 games we’ve made adjustments after the half let’s do it again!
Good night.
Wow Redmond. Wow
Wow :(
Defense needs some help.  Cant be on the field the whole game.
[deleted]
Reader hurt. This team is seriously cursed. Every free agency signing has either sucked or gotten hurt
Are head coaches and offensive line coaches ever fired mid-season? Asking for a friend
Lol Lamar just ran right into the ref.
Is isn't a coverage sack if he doesn't get sacked.
Defense keeps giving the offense opportunities to make this a game.
"""that was a coverage sack"".... except we didn't fucking sack him"
Heady play Mixon.
Joe needs to throw it away
Offense absolutely shit the bed today man
Let’s just go into our 2 minute offense. Because I’d be happy to see at least one drive last 2 minutes
Kevin huber is the mvp
99 Making some plays today
"Are the Bengals not bringing TEs to help with pass rush? Can’t watch, only listen on the radio."
LB's gotta step up and take on lineman early
"On a positive note, 14 points of the ravens 20 is from an interception and turnover on downs... Basically, they only scored TDs when we have them great field position."
"And that’s why Gio is the third down back, ladies and gentlemen."
How much of the deep throw problems are burrow and how much is the lack of separation from the receiving core?
Really confused by some of these spots
"I missed the Green trade thing, what happened?"
THROW THE BALL!
[deleted]
This is an embarrassment
"7 sacks and all are embarrassing, free runners left and right. Probably only two at are on Joe"
"If our O-like was even ""not great"" we'd be in this game smh"
Only team in the league that hasn't scored yet this week Pog
"Well, Anarumo has actually earned his check this week. The rest of the coaches..."
Holyyyyy shit
WHAT T FUCK WAS THAT
BRUH YOU GUYS
My god the ravens have 7 sacks this game
Mixon could and should do more of that.
POINTS
WE SCORED SOME POINTS
Well...we scored?
And why not try an onside kick. Yeah your not going to  win the game but get some practice in. Fire this clown
Is Burrow limping? I hope that was just his normal walk.
"Let me ask a question really quick...

Are there people who would like to go 8-8 and miss the playoffs, pick at like 15?

Or would you rather go 3-13 or 4-12 and get another top 10 pick to to use on an OL for Burrow?

Because right now, the expectations of this sub are way too high for a rookie joining a 2-14 roster from last year."
Enjoy filing for unemployment tomorrow Thomas
Fucking AJ Green is worthless at this point. He looks like an Alzheimer's patient out there lost on the field.
"This one’s on Zac Taylor, fellas. He has got to hold the OC and the offensive line coach accountable for this complete lack of preparation and gameplan. This is his official hot seat moment."
"I just want to thank all of you for being great fans. We can’t play football, but we can root and we can hope. We’re doing an excellent job of hanging in there and continuing to watch. I truly believe our day will come with Joey B. And when that day comes, we can literally come back to this thread and see that we were all here, wading through a shit-filled sewer of agony. I love y’all. WHO DEY."
The announcer is right lmao
Why do we keep doing these roll outs they haven’t worked once yet
yeah sorry guys i can't finish this one.
That’s not a fumbled had possession to the ground
This is the first game where Joe looks like a rookie.
"This is 1990's bad, guys"
Our o line is horrible.  Fire zac taylor.
AJ would have just stood there and watched
Honestly doing a good job pressuring and containing Lamar Jackson.
It’s weird to see Burrow and company playing like shit and the Defense playing pretty well...
Just run the clock out
AJ Green makes a lot of money that isn’t being earned.
"I have a 5-page essay due tomorrow.

I guess poor time-management is something I learned from the Bengals."
The last 3-4 drives was some of the worst playcalling I’ve ever seen. Lol. A run on 2nd and 13. Unfucking believable
Zac Taylor is out his depth when he's asked to do anything else but make a coffee for Sean McVay
"You gotta throw it away, you know there is two players right behind you. Terrible play"
"The media before this game was talking about how lackluster Baltimore’s pass rush has been. Obviously they’ve been blitzing a ton, but I think we can all agree that playing Pittsburgh is gonna be worse than this."
The fuck? Why
"Woo boy, playing for the field goal"
Were kicking a fg?  Man fuck zach
Lmao field goal
AJ Green with his head in his hands is a big mood...
"AJ is washed, the line needs launched into the atmosphere, and my faith in this new coaching staff gets smaller and smaller every day. I’m tired of only beating bad teams and getting smoked by the really good ones. I just want a quality win man."
Rich fucking Gannon just outcoached ZT....just throw the post for a TD
"fuck AJ green, hes a bottom tier washed up WR. you aint julio"
That strip was ZT’s fault!! All his! He is mike Thomas. So it’s ZT’s fault
Absolutely have to sit Burrow it’s over and he’s gonna die
Is it just me or does the noise from the fans at the stadium sound really annoying
Burrows confidence has totally been knocked this game
Defense actually isn't playing terrible today.
Now we’re turning on Carlos Dunlap too. Jesus you guys fucking suck
i can’t be the only who saw tee higgins open for that 4th down conversion
This is just annoying. Can't wait until the Ravens actually have to start paying their play makers.
"I hate saying it, but that was a bad decision by Joe. Can’t lob it up in the middle of the field while falling down, it’s a recipe for disaster. Let’s get it next drive."
Good way to earn your starting spot back Carlos
Please just don’t be a blowout. Make this game look somewhat competitive
Leave it to the Bengals or Lions to get screwed by the refs. Everyone other scenario that’s offsetting. Fucking bullshit
It was going well until the D decided to take every third down off. And then a horrible play calling drive form ZT to follow up. And then Carlos having a hissy fit
Fire Lou  fire Zach fire the cut the whole damn oline
Bench burrow before he gets hurt please
"This line, these play calls, they players playing flat, it’s all coaching and it’s horrid"
Hahahahaha. 3 minutes to go down and score and we run it twice and throw a screen away. Wow we’re pathetic
"Stream is freezing alot, think my ISP is trying to save my sanity today and I'm  just stupid enough to keep pushing through the pain."
"I think we need to spend a few years in the minors to develop a solid team, then we’ll be able to compete"
Lol why the hell are we doing play action?
Guys. I'm pretty sure on the next 3rd and long the short pass is going to work.
Burrow needs to throw some of these away
Lamar Jackson is not very good
Hubbard look like he was holding his arm there???
What do you know.  Quick routes work
Zac Taylor deserves some hate for entering the season with this OLine but the wide receivers aren't getting open. And the OLine blows. It limits the offense severely
Zack Taylor does not have the “it” factor
FAT RANDY 😤
"AY Superbowl inbound! We scored points against the Ravens, we are now the best. Best logic, you cannot prove me wrong. /s"
"Well thats a game I just watched.

Can we PLEASE sit Joe and let Finley take this pounding for the rest of the year?"
Fuck you Zac
The Ravens are letting them gain yards like the Bengals are a Down’s syndrome kid.
Lamar Jackson do be ugly tho
Yo fuck aj green.
Aj quit on another play
Holy shit is Lamar Jackson is the most overrated player ever? He can run but that seems to be about it?
"I'm all in on Joe Burrow, but I dont think the coaching staff is competent enough to get a win against anyone outside of the worst teams in the NFL. If Bengals fans want more than 4 wins in a season, they're gonna have to accept Zac Taylor is not the answer."
At least I’m playing the Ravens’ defense in my fantasy league this week...
"The Ravens are a well coached team with competent players. A stark contrast to the Bengals organization. I hope Zac Taylor and Turner are 
 fired tonight."
"Glad that I finally don’t have to bootleg the Bengals game today.

They’re actually showing it in my area"
Man bates bit sooo hard on that fake
That could’ve been a lot worse
Price wants in on that action LOL
Eat that Lamar
Go for it. Its the ravens. We need points.
"He didn't fall, he was pushed."
Can we run the ball with mixon to the outside for once
Boyd falls a couple times a game man
Goddamn that was a gorgeous escape Joe
AJ Green would have made that catch.
"We’re now 6/7 on 4th down...not too bad, eh?"
"It’s going to be a long day for us, we already look out schemed."
Well thats what it looks like if they have to rely on Jacksons arm. Let's hold them and take the lead
Real generous spot there
Our 3rd down D needs help
"Wtf kind of ""press coverage"" was that smh"
What the hell was Hubbard doing there
gosh ducking dammit
WTF. I look away and now they are at the 10?
Cmon Williams you were there dont run yourself out of it
**1 STOP PLEASE**
"ONE MORE STOP

ONE MORE STOP"
Defense is at least showing some fire today
Whos 59?
We have been going to man coverage on every third down and they just throw it at Bell
Big whiff by Lawson there
"Gotta hit that dude on the line or something man, they go to him EVERY third down"
They had 5 3rd downs that drive and converted all of them I wanna cry.
Really sad when we can’t cover shit
pass d is trash
We have done OK on defence except where we go too cautious on key plays. Keep the pressure on ffs.
we had a couple chances to get off the field. Can’t give up 3rd and 14
Welp. This is a blood bath.
oof
All three of those plays were abysmal.
"Man this is a frustrating watch so far

I expected something similar but still lol"
Well that was a horrid decision.
Weak as fuck what bullshit
"Oh no, we suck again"
Defense just standing around looking at butterflies in the end zone
Bengals phoning this shit in big time. Brown stopped and stood and so did the defenders. Players not in the game at all this is whack af
Brown looks like someone entered a big head code on him. His helmet to body ratio is off.
To everyone who thought our OL turned the corner last week: whoops.
"So let me guess, Zac Taylor gets another pass?"
Man I swear is it just me or does it looks like the personnel on D line has not been what I was expecting. Where’s Geno? Keep Reader in the game!!
"Those anyone have a clip of the ""unnecessary roughness""?"
Tate on Tate action
Call me stupid but I’m hopeful with burrow. If and big if we score a TD here and stop the ravens next drive I think we can get back. Is it likely probably not but it’s definitely possible
And we took the ball 1st 😐
"""Not as effective outside the pocket""

A+ analysis there"
Jim turner putting sample on judon? Ffs this is beyond idiotic
Goin from a 2nd and 4 to a 3rd and 12 what’s new
Mixon is going to end up with negative yards
Why wouldn’t the Ravens blitz 8 every play? They’ll either get to Burrow or stuff Mixon.
It’s about to be 24-0 just take him out of the game
☹️
Well this will be a good learning experience for Joe
Over 50% of snaps pressured and pretty much every throw off his back foot. Fuck this oline is garbage
"Jesus fucking christ, Burrow is dying out there."
Listen y’all this is one of the best overall teams in the league it was gonna go terrible from the beginning
"Alright, Joe. Lesson #1:

Throw the ball away when you have to."
If we could lose by 17 or less I call it a win lol
"That ball bobbled out, incomplete... It was batted down."
It’s Comeback Szn
No harm on that fumble gift
OMG A STOPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Ok this is the drive. THE drive. The TD drive.
Hey! A screen! ZT reads this forum!
Pancake
Would we be better off just playing without a RG?
We can't even run a screen properly lol. Can we please just kill the clock and go home?
I feel like we're playing from beyond 10 more than we play from below
I mean jesus christ lololololol
Somebody needs to be fired after this game
Might as well forfeit with this effort by the team and ineptitude by the staff
This organization is an abortion from top to bottom. The contents of a midsummer portapotty.
"Y’know, I’m gonna blame that first sack on Burrow.


Hart was actually doing his job, and Joe just held on to the ball for way too long."
Can we just put the practice squad out there?
Joe Burrows manager is probably fucking terrified
How about decent drive and 3 pts? Is that too much to ask?
Goddammit Gio gotta make yourself more available
"I just got off the phone with Roger Goddell, we'll be playing the Jacksonville Jaguars for the rest of the season."
No hold?? Ok
Anyone checked out of this game already?
Wow I’m surprised they didn’t call DPI just because
I’m sorry but can we please not forget that 2nd and 13 run call. Like wtf ZT
At least darius philips has been a bright spot on this stinker of a game
Phillips is having a good game at least
WIIKLLLSSON
Our next win wont be until late November at this rate
What players on our roster would start in baltimore?
D has played decent minus the 3rd Downs. O line has really fucked this team today
atta boy carlos
We should be down 40 at this point
 Bring on those halftime adjustments!
Dont have the ball at the half... sure hope Zac figures some shit out real quick
"Safe to say, our game plan was.....  Subpar"
Someone...anyone...on this coaching staff needs to ne held accountable.
Play calling was good until that rollout play. So like 1 good play. Jesus Christ ZT WTF are you doing
Can't believe Zac Taylor and his historically good NFL offensive scheme isn't performing well with the Bengals. Who would have thought?
Gonna earn the nickname Wilson Pickett.
Here. We. Go.
TEEEEE
Thing is our defence is doing well. If we had even just a competant OL we would be competitive against a good team.
I hate that the excuse will be they Baltimore is a tough team and rest it at that when this coach is the drizzling shits.
He clearly isnt watching this game lol
This is just embarrassing
I say we take a deep shot next offensive snap.  Fuck it.  Good as a punt or 3 and out
AJ Green is being reported as doubtful to return due to hamstring
Stuffed armed a ref lmao
Defense secondary has been excellent today.
D playing well!
Ref in the way...still can't catch the man. Wtf
There's been a few times it seemed Lamar could've taken off. Glad he  hasn't.
"Mike Vick > Lamar Jackson . Outside of a <10 yd pass, Lamar has no passing ability."
OMG I can't watch this game anymore. I'll die from anxiety. Gonna go watch KC vs LV. Bye guys.
Feel for AJ but hoping to see more Tate. He needs more snaps.
Stop jumping on Lamar pump fake just keep driving at him and get the hit on him. You won't get a penalty if you hit him as he is throwing
Lou’s job is safe for another week
Is Willie Anderson available?
Thank God Mixon knocked it out for
Joe has to throw it
Throw it away joe....
For Fuck Sake!
When a QB is not being protected by an OL you will find him running around like an infantryman in no mans land. Joe has the bravery not to rush the throw but sometimes you just got to get rid.
Worst part of the game is our defense is playing really well given the matchup and offense cant get anything going
The O line held!
Drew Sample jumping like a whale out of water for that ball.
"That's one bad throw out of how many good/great throws so far.  No one is perfect, Burrow included.  

Hopefully that play just lights a fire under his ass for the rest of the game."
We converted a third down!
I swear he says Teabag Stadium
Joe just protected himself!
4th and 20? Don't mind if I do.
Holy shit
Lmfao at least we're going to have a high draft pick again.
"*Homer Simpson voice*


Mmmm...4th down and 20"
I feel like I did with Marvins last couple of seasons. The more he loses the earlier he gets fired. Poor Burrow
Is this gonna be a shut out
Checking out. Heading to verdansk. Have fun watching you brave souls
"Why are we tanking so bad?? 
We can barely get anything to work..."
Its like Taylor doesn't recognize who our playmakers are until its too fuckin late. Gameplan to your strengths the NFL isn't for participation awards damn
WILL YOU QUIT DROPPING INTERCEPTIONS IM DYING HERE
This is literally the best I’ve seen us defend L. Jackson. Unfortunately we’ve put up a goose egg on offense
We fucking needed that
I fully expect us to score negative points next week.
Good god
Bruh
lol
faaaaaaade me bb
LOL
Pain
If we get the first pick in the draft what would be the best way to go?
Cue the circus music
we've given up rip
This ref and Gumbel need to do a game together on commentary.
Fucking fake fan noise!!!! Terrible!!
bruh let us have something w h y
I will never understand running out of shotgun on 3rd and 4th and short
If ZT punts he deserves to be fired today
**THIS AIN'T OVER YET**
Burrow with the FU toss
Best play of the game!!!  It's the little things guys lol
he does?
Pity spot lol
It's amazing what we can do when it's not 4th and wtf every time
"Lol, a field goal......Jesus christ"
"Ugh, why can't we ever kick ass in the afc north?  They all have our number."
Holy shit all these comments. We’re playing the fucking Ravens and the reigning MVP. This was not ever supposed to be a close game. Chill the fuck out everyone.
Why even throw to AJ Green? He doesn't even try for the ball.
It’s gonna be a longggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg game
This sub quickly went from being pumped AJ’s back to hating him saying he was never good in the first place
Not worth watching the rest of this. Fuck the Brown family.
"I guess the best case scenario is this year, the Vikings fire Zimmer. Zimmer is content to go back and be a defensive coordinator. The Bengals court him aggressively and offer him top dollar. They get rid of Lou Anarumo. They fire Zac Taylor and hire Eric Bienemy to be a head coach. They draft Penei Sewell. Logan Wilson and Akeem Davis-Gaithers keep developing nicely. They go out and trade for a quality guard and begin developing Adeniji. They plug in Sewell at LT and move Williams to RT. Joe Burrow keeps developing his sense of timing. Turner gets fired and banned from the league and we get a bonafide offensive line coach to come in and work these kids over and get them functioning as a complete unit."
What is Taylors record? We are rapidly approaching Hues record.
Positives:  defense. T higgins.  I played the ravens defense this week 😂😂😂
"I’m calling my shot:

I say it’ll be about 6:30 through the first quarter before we start saying that someone should be fired."
Bengals take the lead on the Ravens this drive it’s over. Lamar sucks at throwing
Terrible decision by burrow
Never see ball carriers throw it away when they are way behind the line. I’m shocked more RBs don’t do that like Lamar just did ;)
I just hope we actually get the next head coach signing after this year right. I really don't want Burrow to have a coaching carousel.
Burrow learning quite the lesson today. Very poor.
AJ pulling a carson palmer and quitting.
[deleted]
All Redmond does is get penalties
Somebody rob Hart for his Js he don't deserve em
I was in neither camp about ZT before this game. But I’ve seen enough. He’s a garbage tier coach. Freddie Kitchens esque. At least browns were quick to see their mistake.
Anyone at this point still think Zac is the guy?
What the fuck is with the pitches?!
That’s why Gio is usually in on 3rd down. Good at blitz pick up.
burrow is not going to survive a full season of this OL
Can we try somebody other than Redmond at rg? Know that one wasn’t really on him but he’s looked really bad
AJ was never healed from the hamstring.
"Take a 5th rounder for Aj and let Auden Tate see the field. He's done, I'm done"
Now AJ has a hamstring? gimmie  a break
"I admire Joe's optimism, but the clock in his head better start working"
Tank for Sewell.
Man.  Defense killing it.  Offense looks like when andy was here
Uh oh. Hubbard is hurt. Fuck
Fire the whole staff
*cough*trade AJ Green for a lineman*cough*
Anyone know what the patch on 93 on Baltimore’s Jersey is? Looks like a guy holding two shields?
I'm playing against Mixon in fantasy this week but I still wish we'd just hand off to him every snap for the rest of the game just to keep Burrow upright and safe.
who the f u c k is JBalvin
Did anyone else see burrow make a pout face when talking to Lamar 😖
The league is finally adapting to Lamar. Just like they did to RG3. I never bought the hype. He’s a glorified RB
Am I the only one who think Lamar Jackson is over rated?
Unsportsmanlike by the ravens. Like really your up 17 to 0 and you’re gonna go for it? Piss off...
We're really gonna make him David Carr. I hate this franchise.
We gotta get burrow outta there
You guys should fire ZT and hire Joe Brady.
I'm really worried that looking back this will be the game where Burrow realized he needed to get out of Cincinnati as soon as he could.
Taylor is a fraud. Fire him.
Dont let our shit O-Line let people forget how atrocious the Play Calling was today
Take burrow out of the game right now. We are not winning this game and he is going to get hurt
Can we please pull Burrow so we can use him in the future
Bench him. Save him for next year.
[deleted]
"Do you guys remember that dumb saying ""if you build it they will come""...?

It's more like ""Give Joe time and he will score."""
He should’ve ran for it I think he had the angle on the defender
Defense not doing bad just cant stop em on 3rd down.
MaKe LaMaR tHrOw
Joe will die by season's end at this rate
I think the ground caused that fumble
"Guys I love Joe but he's holding the ball way too long, it's not all the lines fault as bad as they've been"
"This is a rough watch, but watching all the fans in here turn on each other...makes it a lil easier haha"
Alex Redmond again... You can't TACKLE the defense dude.
Isnt it amazing seeing the penalties called against us that wouldnt be called for us
"Competent, well built and coached team versus whatever scrubs we put out there."
"For everyone saying we need to get Burrow out, it's not his birthday."
Eric beinenmy come on down
joe is broken
There is a reason Mixon doesn't play on 3rd downs. Absolutely no idea how to block.
Ah arm tackles ☺️
Green with a hamstring problem? His career is done.
"Oh so Green has been injured this whole time, that makes sense, didn't make sense how far he fell"
This is worse than the KC game last year
"My confidence in this coaching staff is more than spent.  Jim Turner needs to go after this week. An overall talentless line playing at an average level for ONE game against a hapless Jaguars team is not even close to enough. Joe Burrow has been hit nearly every offensive play. He needs time to make plays and make mistakes, dude is just in a lions den. 

It's rare to ""contain"" Lamar Jackson like the defense has today and theres no excuse that this game isn't more competitive. Taylor needs to figure out the run game and dictate a faster pace with some creativity. He looks completely lost with no answer."
Running the ball down 20 in the 4th quarter
End me fam
Fucking end me
[deleted]
"We, ladies and gentlemen are kittens in the nest of a mighty bird."
"3rd and inches? Let's run out of shotgun!

Jesus christ what's up with this dudes constant terrible play calling..."
Being in the gun on 3rd and 1 is inexcusable.
ZT about to call timeouts between every knee? No? Shocking.
This team is a complete fucking joke.
Get AJ outta the game. He doesn’t even show effort anymore.
"I'm a lifelong Bengals fan. Fourty years. I'm giving this coaching staff one more offseason to show me they care about protecting Joe long-term. If they don't, then I'm out. I'll come back and root for  Burrow when he inevitably leaves and goes to a team that deserves him."
Just get Joe burrow out of the game before he gets hurt. Trade for some o linemen guys
"2020 Bengals ceiling is a 5-10-1 season.   
Not Burrow's fault. The lack of an OL, poor coaching decisions, and poor off season decisions by the Front Office created this season."
We know this O Line is trash. We know this. That means the coaches and ownership know this. They want you to think you’re crazy. But they’re gaslighting us. They say what you want to hear but never do shit. At this point we only have ourselves to blame for having hope
I just moved out of market.  Can anyone recommend a free or cheaper way to watch games online?
I’m nervous
Best free live stream?
I have no idea what to expect honestly.
Love all the local company ads that don’t have the Bengals permission for their logos. Just generic orange shirts and outside PBS
I’m on vacation in Florida. I have Hulu plus live. But I can’t figure out how to get the bengals game! Help!!??
LET'S FUCKING GOOO!!!
We need to score on the first drive and force Lamar to play from behind
That’s an... interesting hairdo
Oh my goddd
"Not much you can do there.


Just a well designed play."
If we win the toss we should always defer. Why da fuck we electing to receive? Making adjustments after one drive or what?
Love me some D
LB blowing contain big time. Sounds about right for this LB group
My only hope is that we keep it close
Wow defense got off the field after that monster play
TEEEEEEE
That was cover 3?
Green...
Higgins looking good.
"Take it to the crib, Tee!"
Crazy Legs
Omg joe that was sick
Just a tad too high
"4th and short, throw it deep.... Bruh Boyd is a middle of the field machine come on..."
"Oof, juuuuust out of Boyd’s reach."
Burrow is already running for his life. Gonna be a long day..
Burrow looks a little banged up or uncomfortable after that last scramble/hit. Hopefully he just needs to loosen it up a little.
Not as bad as when Gruden would dial up a 45 yard bomb to the endzone when it was 4th and 1
What is wrong with our pass rush?
Wow that coverage by sims was awful
Watching Dunlap out there he just doesn’t have it.
damn lamar is so good at running but really doesn't have a deep ball huh.
He was 2 ft short there... like it wasn't even close?
Didn’t we have this same ref last week?
Look at our D hitting nice and low. You love to see it
CMON D MAKE US PROUD
Well fuck
Fuck
Defense  should have watched tape on Murray..might’ve helped a bit..
Can we get a ducking 3rd down stop?? Duck!
"Jesus, can we please make adjustments to cover Andrews."
Fire Lou and go get wade Phillips
Awful 3rd down defense on that drive.
"Be honest boys, how much do you think we are going to score and how much do you think they are going to score?"
that hurts
WHO WAS HE THROWING TO????!?!
Long day ahead...
 Mer?
Bad play but eh
This is as bad as I thought it would be.
wtf was that
This is a fun game..
Get me out
"Well our defense is still trash, our O-Line didn't magically become competent just because Jacksonville is bad, a good team has destroyed any hope in a quarter l o l"
"I’m not even mad, our team is trash and this is meeting expectations."
TATEonTATE
"Their endaround goes 50 yards, ours goes 1"
This team and Tight ends blocking defensive ends name a better duo
atta boyd
Seeing Joe run for his life is difficult to watch.
Can you imagine Joe's scrambling abilities behind a line where he doesn't have to do it every play? Dude is elusive as hell.
Tyler Boyd is so trustworthy
That personal foul call was very weak. Burrow can't throw up balls like that and he knows it. AJ doesn't have any will to win anymore these rookies are working harder than him.
Nice catch Boyd
I love AirBnB.
30 yards of running for -4 yards fuck this OLINE
Will the score be better or worse than the 38-6 Browns game?
YEAH BOYD
lol
I feel so bad for Joe. No protection whatsoever I still can’t believe we didn’t sign quality OL
Let’s see a long ball
Horrific
PHEW
Oh god
Should be a free play
Should’ve went with the int
pain
Pain.
Ugly
Painful.
"this is like a nightmare I had, though Joe was due for a brutal game let's be real it's a good learning experience if anything"
Nice tip
I like how they have all day to throw.
This team embodies incompetence top to bottom
Nice stop d
Get some points O!
:(
Why do people still watch this team?
😖
Geno not playing?!
Lots of quick hitters this drive please.
"I’m so tired of the way we are pitching East and West to Mixon. I understand our guards are our weakest link, but you HAVE TO RUN THE BALL UP THE GUT.  This cutesie bullshit does NOT work."
It’s like all the defensive players just know the opposing team is going to score within 2 mins and just give up.
Time for our weekly 2 minute drill TD to give up
"You just wish we had *anything* to point to. Nothing looks good in this game. 


#SAD

Edit: apparently I should complain more and good things will happen lol

Edit 2: can't wait to give it back in 4 plays lol"
That would’ve been 6
Zac Taylor is such a pussy
That was a touchdown that he just dropped.
Please just run the clock out for 2 quarters
Yay!!!!
Bout the 4th INT he throw glad we caught one.
What a play
ALRIGHT ROOK
Defense is stepping the fuck up!
Phillips has looked good.
🤞 TD before the half
GUMBELL 🤣🤣
Honestly its amazing dlinemen ever bat the ball down. Almost always seems like the defender puts his hand up before the throw and the qb just gets lucky enough to throw it right at his arm.
Lamar looks like he missed practice this week.
Every time we call TO on d bad things happen lol
"Even if he makes it, still a 3 score game"
At least the Q2 was better.
"Good on the defense honestly, the o-line however........"
We need to go hurry up the entire second half.  I don't care if we go three and and out a couple times in a row.  Need to shake things up.
"I swear I hate Lou like every week, but he always leaves me satisfied at the end of games"
You wanna see the difference between good coaching and a good franchise? Look at Matt Ruhle and Carolina and what he's doing there
"Man, we have had our hands on half a dozen passes"
NOOOOoOOOOooo
Is Lamar an idiot
Our defense would decide to be competent the game our offense gets buried huh
Defense has played well enough to be in the game right now. Oline and play calling have been absolute ass. Story of the year.
He's becoming self aware
jesus
"The way this game is looking, we need to run a quick hit,, hurry up offense.  Nothing else is going to work.  We just have no time, and no run game.  Running is just a waste of time at this point, as is trying to get a semi deep pass."
[deleted]
AJ's out too? Can't catch a break
There goes our run d
Penei Sewell round 1 Trey Smith Round 2 Sign Joey Thuney move Williams to RT
Oh come on that should’ve been a sack
HE WAS IN THE POCKET WHERES THE PENALTY
Looks like you shoulda been a WR Lamar
Good AJ is out now Auden can maybe make a play
Poor aj:(
😳
This game is giving me heartburn
I played Joey in fantasy this week 😤😭🤦🏻‍♂️
Any update on Reader?
Finally a nice block and a 1st down....lets go
First down!
WE GOTA FIRST DOWN!!!!!!
[deleted]
burrow should keep on one of those mixon runs he's like...always got an empty field ahead
is boyd injured???
Pee wee football
What the fuck am I watching
why leave him in
I really just don't care if we win anymore. My expectations are as low as they can be. Idk what else to say but no one here can pretend they expect anything more than disappointment. I'm glad I have fantasy football to look forward to because the Bengals bring me no joy whatsoever.
Why the hell are we running two deep routes?  We don't have that kind of time dumb pieces of shit!
FUCK!
Nice stop!
Surprised Zak isn't having us practice our knee taking.
LOL GO JOE SQUARED
Hubbard elbow injury
Achain link away
WE WON BABY WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Glad I had to work today!
Why even go for a field goal at that point?
"Fuck, we cant even get 1 td"
"Why the hell is Taylor passing on the 2 yard line? Somebody tell the man, in AFC north 5 or less we run!"
"As much as I love watching Joe- this is a textbook example why you shouldn’t start rookie QBs til they’re ready AND they have at least mediocre support

This is an impossible situation and a perfect formula to ruin a young QB"
get zac the fuck out of here
Burrow pls lol just throw it away dog we're gonna get destroyed your stats are all we have
Burrow needs to be benched for his safety ASAP
[deleted]
Plz be gentle Lamar
Dunlap playng Marvin Lewis Football^^TM
Dunlap is a clown
ZT is dead to me
"Let's hope Burrow will have a short memory for next week. He's way off today, line aside."
That one was on Joe.
Down 20. 3rd and 25. Give up screen pass. Quitters!
Serious question. Should Joe sit out? Like this guy can play 10-15 years in this league but not if he gets hit 20 times a game. He’ll have a short career like a RB.
I am sick and tired of these players dropping INTs. This is ridiculous. How ar you a professional athlete and do not possess the coordination to catch gimme INTs.
Does Burrow seem to throw a slow ass ball sometimes or is it just me?
Ross and AJ need to be traded tomorrow for picks or linemen.
Fire everyone!
White Claw #1 cracked open. Mango. We’re 1-0 when i open a mango claw before kickoff. Keeping the streak alive!
Everyone got their Fire ______ comments ready? Have your top 5 list of complaints?
Which one gave up the sack?
That was a great play by burrow
We need to trade Dunlap if he keeps playing like this
Defense not looking terrible so far so that's kind of promising
"Get fucking lost, Dunlap"
NFL’s golden boy
zach taylor has to be joking with these play calls
Whew free play
Thought they weren't gunna call that offside the way this is going
Sit Burrow down no use in him getting injured.
Unreal... I guess the Ravens are our new Big brothers of the division putting out punishment on us the lil bros
Who else has zero faith in this 3rd and long? 🙋🏼‍♂️
Welp time to switch over to Redzone.
"We've not let lamar run at all too, shame a good defensive day so far is wasted"
"It’s a shame the race is gonna be dry. Been excited for the road course all day. I think they are starting on wet tires though.   Kyle has a chance to point his way in.  We’ll see. 

Green flag in 10 minutes."
Lou's just gonna let em waltz into Tuckers field goal range. Fuck off with this bend not break shit
Honestly without Andrews Lamar cant throw for shit against any decent coverage
Dobbins needs to be on the field more
LAMAR. JACKSON. IS. OVERRATED
Lazy Eye Watson lol
A quick short pass hallelujah!
Stop these stupid fucking pitches. They don’t work holy shit.
Horrific coaching/play-calling and a bad o-line lead to disaster.
Not sure why we held on to green the past few years
"Joe, why didn’t you just take off right there?"
Do we have to play the 4th quarter
This bum Ingram acting like he got 200 yards when he just got his second first down of the game
HOW DO YOU DROP THAT
CATCH THE FUCKING BALL
If the bengals made a comeback I’d be shocked. Literally the most improbable thing that could happen this game
So can we fire everyone yet?
Calling it. Bengals TD!!!
Ok Burrow is looking pure rookie today.
Some of this is on Burrows. Holding ball too long
QUIT ROOTING FOR BURROW TO GET HURT JUST TO PROVE A POINT ABOUT THE OL BEING BAD.
Bench Erickson for Ross.
"Thank God that was a free play but I do *not* want to see that again, Joe."
They blew the whistle well before the ravens had the ball. Bad whistle but technically its not a turnover by rule.
Punting down 3 possessions against a far superior team ☺️
"For the love of Burrow, put in Finley."
"I’ve tried to be patient with the offensive line, but man, at what point is it a failure of this administration to not trade for someone tomorrow? I can kind of understand banking on their development and whatever but it’s clear now it’s not happening ."
Now that AJ Green is out maybe the offense has a chance.
THROW THE DAMN BALL AWAY FOR ONCE JOE
Maybe this game is the final nail in Mike Browns coffin.....
Headline: Bengals make case to bring relegation to the NFL.
Typical Mixon. Great on one game and below average in the next.
Jonah Williams sucks
"Joe, honey, throw the damn ball."
"O-line hasn’t been great, but Joe’s not doing himself any favors holding on to the ball for as long as he has."
lol fuck you Tucker
I don't know why he still thinks he can hold onto the ball there. I'm not saying the line is doing it well but at some point you have to know what you have and he can't hold onto the ball that long.
The O-line doesnt seem as bad as they have been but something seems off with our blocking schemes. The Ravens have had a number of plays where there is a free runner going strait for Joey B.
Can Taylor. If not Turner should be gone after this game.
Can we have 5 women for offensive linepeople. I truly believe they would do better
Burrow is playing like straight ass
😂😂😂
[deleted]
This team sucks.
Taylor's inability and refusal to call out this offensive line and instead blame the performance on the interceptions is the nail in the coffin for me. Fire the dude. I'd rather have Gase.
That int is on the o line
I say they forfeit the season at this point because you just can’t compete when it matters
Our defense appears to have given up already
Lamar sucks!! /s lol.  That was a fun sequence
How do you drop THAT
"Lamar cannot run on us.

Edit: This game*"
Salty ass bitches
"Geno back...Now its Readers turn

Get ready for alot of ""Hes week to week"" hahaha"
Baltimore's offensive coordinator has more experience than our head coach .
Shocked the Ravens haven't used Dobbins on us that much
Wtf do you expect AJ to do there? That ball was 10 feet over his head lol
[deleted]
At what point do they sit Burrow?
Ravens fan here. Does Burrow get abused like this every week? I’m legit getting worried for him.
College football team vs NFL football team
"I got a notification saying there was a touchdown to Mike Thomas, what happened?"
AJ should retire. He is clearly done.
Joe is broken and out of confidence. Needs to request a trade ASAP and bail on this trash franchise. His potential deserves it.
"Defend that throw. Try,"
He was already down
"If things don't get better in the second half, we should just sit Joe. This isn't fair to him."
Stop fucking running on 1st down
BENGOS

Sometimes I wonder if we would be complaining as much as we do if we were a Super Bowl contender rn...

"Monday there should be an open call at PBS for a Head Coach. The man hired is an unemployed married father of 3, who takes the Bengals to the playoffs. Starring Mark Ruffalo and Natalie Portman in the Disney adaptation."
Does this coach even have an idea of play calls by situation? It’s like he just flips the Rolodex and calls whatever it lands on.
"alright, someone has to say it, burrow is terrible right now."
Luke fickell for head coach
Why is K Austin Seibert still on our roster
Ready for new Bengals Head Coach Bill O'Brien
Mixon is trash J.k. Dobbins is already better than him smh
What is Burrow doing
Boyd needs to catch that.
Making me wonder if Joe either studies tape or listens to his coaches mid-week
Fuck Lamar Jackson and fuck the Ravens. Tired of seeing people fanboying division rivals. It's embarrassing.

I'll never forget this game. I quit smoking cigs that game. Good day all around.
I was at that game so I may be biased but it's my favorite Bengal game in history and I think one of the best NFL games I've ever seen
As a Bengal fan surrounded by hawk fans in Oregon this was an amazing day!
This is now more relevant than when it was posted lol
Remember when Russell Bodine was our biggest gripe?

Can they block?
The one on the right is a natural bengals fan!

These guys look like they could protect our boy Joe better than our O-line.

Jim Turner needs to be fired immediately
Don't see a lot of Gravity Fall memes sadly. It's a show I wish I could go back and watch without knowing what happens.
"Nothing changes but the quality of our opponents. Our line is historic trash and there’s no “trusting our guys” that will improve it. 
 
I’m one of the eternal optimists here but have been angry watching their ineptitude all afternoon."
I’m increasingly getting on the bench Joe until we can protect him better bandwagon.
Man I fucking miss that show. A fucking 10/10 words can't describe how that show makes me feel :(

Just make one for the next 11 weeks and call it a Season
"At this point, they should just sign the Elder High School line. I’m not sure if Elder would be better, but they certainly wouldn’t be worse and they would be hell of a lot cheaper."
They would probably do better if they just didnt have any fancy blocking schemes. Just stand at your spot and don’t move. Let the quarterback step up to avoid pressure instead of scrambling out.

I think the camouflage helmets are making it hard for Burrow to find his targets.
sigh
""
Bobby Hart is the only NFL player to ever miss a blocking assignment because he was at the craft services table.
How can Redmond and Hart look Burrow and Mixon in the eye after a day like this? I have second hand embarrassment every week.
[removed]
How exactly is this Mike browns fault this year?
Calm down sport...
[removed]
Just hope the Joesen One doesn't get ruined from this dumpster fire of an offensive line.
"Pathetic coaching, why would an offensive line block out on a blitz leaving the A gap wide open. This is pee wee league 101 shit, you always collapse down and let the edge rusher free if you have to leave someone free."
Anyone miss Marvin yet?
AJ has stolen his paycheck for years now. It’s gross.

The brown on top was a great addition to show how shit we are
[removed]
That pick for sure but otherwise no WRs open and no time to throw with no running game
""
"As much as I love Green, the Bengals missed their damn window to trade him when he was somewhat attractive as a trade. We have to face the facts. Vintage Green (at least for him while he is in stripes) is probably long gone.

Part of me wants Green to be the team's Larry like the Cards, but he is getting so hurt and is just a shell of his former self by a lot.

Bengals will be lucky to get a bag of chips and some coupons for Green at this rate."
Ah. I remember getting negative karma multiple times over the past two seasons for defending the position that we have no businesses even attempting to re-sign the guy. And here were are...another year of him being a complete dud.
"Hamstring my ass, he’s quitting on the team"
Who cares at this point?
""
That does seem like what he said
"Going into this game, he was second on our team in targets with 33. First was Boyd with 34. Difference is, Boyd has 28 receptions on those targets and Green only has 14. It’s not like we aren’t trying to get to him. I don’t know if he thinks we aren’t using him right or what, but on the surface it appears to be more of an AJ problem than an under utilization problem"
Yeah I think that is what he is sadly saying...
"We have two grumpy, under performing vets now? We should move these guys."
"He isn’t himself for sure. You can see his routes are slow and he can’t get separation. My favorite player and sad watching him play. 

Given that. He is not a quick dash receiver and needs time to develop. That with the rust he has from not playing to him still afraid to get injured he won’t produce for this team. We will not have an oline that will give him or anyone time and it’s not going to all of a sudden change this or next year."
"I can kinda see the ""Then trade me"" part but can't really tell for some of the other parts of the sentence."
Says the man who is bottoms in separation created
"""Then just trade me"". Yep, he did say that."
"If I’m not going to catch, don’t throw it to me.,.."
"Tough to watch as my favorite player of all time. He’s getting the targets just can’t make the plays, sad to see a future hall of famer lose his edge."
we wont get shit for him
Dunlap should have been moved in the off-season and AJ can be gifted to any team willing to take his salary. I love these guys but if they think they are playing at a level worthy of the salaries they get then they need to look in the mirror. We need draft picks more than we need them.
"Not sure, based on his mannerism and overall personality, I took it as him saying ""trade me cause I'm not useful anymore"" kind of what an older veteran might say if the younger guys are starting to take over and he sees that he's taking away opportunities from them. I really don't want to believe he's turning into an Antonio Brown type demanding trades and shit."
Oh no
Watch him go to another team and tear shit up. It’s happened to us before.
[deleted]
"See ya later, AJ. Glad we didn’t pay you"
We can’t trade you because you have no value. 0/31 teams would offer a thing for AJ Green
What i don't understand is that he was getting plenty of targets in the first couple games and not doing much with them. Then last couple games he gives up through his routes. How is Burrow supposed to trust him???
"He’s playing 70% of snaps and averaging over 8 targets a game. He’s gotta be accountable for some of this lack of production, we have been trying to get him involved"
"Whelp, AJ, you’ve been a great player for the us - best player on the team when you weren’t injured. So good that teams prolly game plan to limit your touches. That, and a rookie QB, and maybe it’s just me but it doesn’t seem like you separate from defenders like you used to. So, I’d hate to see you go, but maybe trading is a good idea given the young talent at your position. No hard feelings and we wish you the best."
"I see both sides really. They basically had him in as a blocker today. On passing plays, they ran him on 5 yard in routes. He was basically a decoy today and got 1 look that sailed way over his head for a pick. He wasn't in for a lot of 3rd downs. 

His production hasn't been good this year, but the way to get him rolling isn't to have him in as a blocker."
Stop being shit then. This aint Marvin where Vets get all the snaps. Fuck off AJ
Use him? The same guy who has yet to make it a drive without giving up on at least 3 plays. Good riddance.
He goin to Dallas now that Daltons starting
What could The Bengals reasonably get for him? A lot of wear and tear on those tires.
"This is not the AJ I choose to remember. Age and injuries ends all NFL careers. He just hasn't accepted that yet. I'll Choose to remember the good times. See you in the hall of fame, AJ."
"Dude looks like he’s not even trying out there, yet wants to pout on the sidelines after sitting out the last 2 years."
I want to move on from AJ. He is constantly hurt and his poor showing in playoff games has always pissed me off. Today he quit on two passes. Good bye aj.
Trade this sandbagger for an o lineman stat.
"Anyone who says AJ needs to go can fight me, hands up."
"Hey I like what he did for us in the past but dude needs to wake up to the fact he has no trade value.

That’s what happens when you spend the better part of three seasons injured and not playing as remotely as well as you used to play.

Say what you want to about Dalton at least at the deadline last year he likely had some value as a quality backup.  No idea why the Bengals didn’t make a deal.  Could have gotten a 4th or 5th round pick which beats nothing.

Teams aren’t going to trade shit for a backup quality WR with injury issues.

If they did Ross would have been gone weeks ago."
If you don’t wanna use me yaknowwhaimean then just trade me
"AJ should go because he deserves better than this franchise. Although burrow is a huge step in the right direction, Mike Brown is one of the least competent execs in the league and realistically will fail burrow rather than give him the tools to succeed. I mean this is a franchise that allowed Marvin Lewis to keep his job despite consistently losing multiple wildcard games.   Now Zack Taylor is here and has looked piss poor next to the guys he put on the coaching staff with him. Get AJ outta that city and on a team who actually knows what it means to win."
Get an O-Line for him.
"You can't tell shit from this. I get being upset about him underperforming, but he could be saying anything. We're not professional lip readers."
The stat on the screen shows 9.2 targets per game... I would hardly call that not using him.
Have to get open to get the ball. Complaining about usage seems like a cop out.
"I mean.... He could be saying a number of things.

Its just speculation."
"my favorite bengal player from 2011-2016, however we should just trade him to the patriots for one of their linemen. They need WR's. We need linemen. Tee Higgins is the future AJ green replacement."
I have no idea what green said there and this looks purely speculative. It really doesn't matter tho. Green is clearly post prime and is not a viable first option at this point in his career. We need to make a decision on what to do about that.
"Hey, if you wanna be used, then maybe play harder.

I swear to god, I used to be a big time AJ Green fan. But his lack of effort is killing me. You've had 1.5 years to recover and get ready for this fucking season, and you look like you're 55 out there. If you don't run your routes, why would the ball come to you? He literally looks like he's running thru molasses out there, and literally everyone in the league can cover him. I'm very much ok with the decisions Burrow makes with the football. If it didn't come to you, there's a reason."
I'd trade him for an O lineman in a heartbeat. All respect to him but would benefit both parties.
"I don't think that is what he said, I mean they have tried to use him."
Fuck AJ Green. Dude doesn’t give a fuck anymore. He’s trash.
Ertz and a 5th for green and uzoma 🤔
"They’ve been using you, you’re just trash. Go home to Georgia and let the NFL forget about you. You’ve been gone for two years already."

You see...a 2nd or 3rd? Are you drunk?
There’s absolutely no way we’d get a 2nd or 3rd round pick for AJ. I don’t even think we’d get a 7th. No team will want to pay his contract for this year
You mean a 2nd or 3rd in like 2050 right?
"31 year old wide receiver who's struggled with injuries the past few years and now seems to struggle getting separation. 

Buddy, I don't even think he would be claimed off the waiver wire."

"That was a monumental effort by the defense.

I've never seen a single group get so utterly dominated as this o line. What the fuck"
How bad does this line need to be for Turner to lose his job? I can accept this team is rebuilding. I never expected this to be a good year. But this is ridiculous.
"Actually, great game by the defense, all things considered.

Good to know our O-Line is still a pile of shit though"
We just saw the death of AJ Green boys :(
I expected so little from our offensive line and was still let down
The D has flashes of serviceability.
"I'm not even sad we lost, I'm sad we let Joe down :("
"Things they should do:

* Fire Jim Turner
* Fire Duke Tobin
* Hire a real GM 
* Build a real scouting department 
* Have direct convos with Zac, put him on the hot seat
* Let AJ walk after this year
* Spend BIG on offensive line in offseason
* bring back the tiger logo
* Build a real training facility
* cut Dunlap
* cut Gold Star as the official chili as the Cincinnati Bengals
* Create a Ring of Honor

What am I missing?"
How many times has Burrow been sacked? I had to quit watching at halftime
Someone needs to get cut or fired. Absolutely unacceptable to keep marching the same players/staff out there. Borderline criminal
"I’ve stood by ZT for awhile now, but idk man. The play calling today was questionable. Calling plays where receivers are running deep routes instead of calling the quick slant/curl plays. Running to the outside when you have a 200+ pound HB who can run it up the middle for 2/3+ yards on momentum alone. Nothing has been done to the line besides Redmond. I’ve given up on ZT. Hate to say it man."
First time all year I actually felt like Joe was gonna be ruined by the end of the season.
"Two things can be true simultaneously, Zac can be incompetent at calling plays for the personnel he has, and the personnel itself can suck. Hue Brown had terrible talent but that didn't change the fact that he was a terrible coach. I would give Taylor the benefit of the doubt, but Burrow has to stop getting hit. That's worse than losing, and it has to stop. 

I don't care about balance, get the ball out of Burrow's hands or immediately hand it off. No more play action out of ace, no more read options, and keep short route options open at all times - I thought he did a good job with that in the Chargers game, for example."
"Honestly, defense did their job today. I shit talk Lou, a lot, but he always punches above his weight. Not saying he’s good, but he does keep us in games. ZT and the gang got their ass handed to them."
Kicking a field goal down 27 with 30 seconds to go is just pathetic. ZT lost my faith today.
Our offense was absolutely pathetic. Defense actually did pretty decent considering the shit hand they were dealt.
[This is suddenly so relevant again](https://imgur.com/a/Onyr2lF).
"Zac Taylor needs to be fired. Defending this trash o-like play, starting AJ when he clearly is not healthy or productive, and the uninspired play calling. Every game it feels like they go in with absolutely no plan. Burrow is going to get hurt or rattled beyond repair if we don’t do SOMETHING to help him."
I know that moral victories don’t exist but lou should feel really good about his gameplan
Zac Taylor is a giant pussy.
"My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through."" I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because being a fan of this team gave me cancer anyway."
7 sacks.......what a way to set your rookie quarterback up for success
NOBODY SHUTS OUT THE BENGALS!!!
"How can this glowering, despised, simpleton of an owner be the spawn of NFL royalty. Fuck Mike Brown, and his nepotism. At least Jerry Jones gives a shit if his team wins or loses.

It’s beyond frustrating that the players, and fans have to put up with his greedy egotistical bullshit. Would that we could also have an election and oust him and his shitbird progeny.

Fuck the Steelers and fuck Mike Brown."
Pathetic
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
"Dave Shula 19-52

Bruce Coslet 21-39

Dick LeBeau 12-33

Zach Taylor 3-17-1 so far

Welcome back to the 90's"
The OL issues have to be coaching. I know there aren’t any pro bowlers on there but they can’t be all that bad. I mean how many first round picks do we have on the line?
And to top it off Hubbard with an elbow injury
"Yea but if there WERE offensive linemen for sale at Walmart, they would look a lot like Redmond and Hart"
Im just waiting to see if ZT comes out defending the o-line and Turner again. That will tell me all I need to know about him in Cincy.
"Let's be real, Marvin wasn't a great coach, but he would never field a team as terrible as the product Zac has put out the past season and a half. I don't think people realize how difficult it is to run a football team, and Marvin did a decent job, but Zac Taylor is in way over his head."
Zac Taylor is a giant pussy. What a way to set the demeanor for the team. Won’t even try for the TD cause you don’t want to get to shut out. Who gives a shit.
"to zac's playcalling and the bengals OL:

git gud."
This should be what gets Zac Taylor fired but let’s be honest. We all know he’s not going anywhere til his contract is up because Mike Brown is a cheap bastard.
Fire Zac Taylor post game please
"Zac Taylor is bad. 

The O-Line still sucks. Jacksonville must be really really really bad.

The defense still sucks as well."
When I die I want Alex Redmond to be one of my pallbearer's. He's so good at holding that my family won't have to worry about the casket being dropped.
"How many successful coaches take a 7-9 team and turned them into 2-14 their first season? What about their second season?

We can't afford to develop a HC and a rookie QB."
FAT RANDY LAST MINUTE FIELD GOAL UPVOTE PARTY!!!!!
Zac Taylor is gonna let Jim Turner get him fired isn’t he?
It's almost like drafting one player doesn't fix an entirely broken organization
"I’m not even angry, just sad."
"Guys, was it pretty? No. Are there things to take away from it? Probably, not. But, Baltimore is a legitimate Super Bowl contender and we were a 2-14 football team last season. I think the defense played well considering the circumstances they were put in on quite a few drives. 

To me, this was Burrow’s first game where there were times he look flustered. It’s natural, he’s a rookie. The ability of this sub to overreact from week to week will never seize to amaze me 😂"
Pollack should be available again after the season so there's a strong replacement for Turner hopefully
Fire Jim Turner now.
"Did we adjust at all on offense? It's one thing to get off to a bad start, another to do nothing and let it keep happening drive after drive. Burrow looked like a rookie today, he held onto the ball too long for a good chunk of the game. This is one of Taylor's worst coached games all things said. This definitely felt like multiple steps back after the offense looked mostly decent to good the past 3 weeks."
"This is the kind of game that wasn’t supposed to happen this year. That’s why this hurts so much. We were supposed to lose, but not in demoralizing fashion like this."
I can’t bear to think about the post game interview with Burrow
Quit watching at half time and went outside and planted a tree. I like to think my Sunday was a lot more productive. Until the Brown family decides to give a damn this franchise is a waste of time.
Damn Andy Dalton throwing bombs
"I'm not really sure what you guys expected with all this anger and shit.

Defense played very well. Offense had a terrible matchup against a Super Bowl-caliber defense.

Nobody thought we would even be competitive in this and we really weren't. That's okay. Don't be mad about the games we're *supposed* to lose, be mad about the games that we should be winning."
Defense looked great! Glad we contained Lamar. Offense line and Burrow were at their worst today. Fire Turner plz
"I don't understand hardly any of the playcalling on offense, and the o-line continues to be horrendous.  This team will be lucky to get 1-2 more wins this season."
"Play goal-line, pro form sets so literally all protection is in front of Joe, then let throw the ball away or make 3 yard passes."
">\#Bengals DT D.J. Reader suffered a quad injury that’s expected to knock him out for the season, sources tell me and @TomPelissero. Tests to confirm when he gets back to Cincinnati but the team is bracing for the worst for their big-ticket free agent signing. - @MikeGarafolo"
Andy Dalton SZN
Hey hey! Ho Ho! Zac Taylor has got to go!
well we are about to find out how good Andy Dalton is when not a Bengal.  The Cowboys are not good but they don't have a bad offense (Dak was having a great year).
"Coaches....throw yourselves under the bus for fuckin once and get a damn line. Stop blaming your players for your ineptitude. Literally all I want to see for once....accountability.

Stop telling us 'well, there was enough positives to build on.' You can't play that hand after today. Look in the mirror for once."
At least ZT ran the clock out in the fourth to save Joe any more hits..
"Wasn’t able to watch the game but what type of stat line is that for joe mixon in a game you are down big all game? Was Taylor trying to get him hurt by giving him a huge workload? I’m bewildered by that. You always pass when behind big, not feed your RB 24 carries."
Sigh.
When do we start the oline rebuild? What can we get for dunlap and Atkins?
what kinda nice whiskey y’all drinking after this one? I just cracked open a 1792 Single Barrel. 🥃
Great defensive effort!!  Offense would be good if we could block for more than .5 seconds :/
Steelers are going to murder Joe
Well browns got smoked by them too and they look decent this year... so maybe that should make us feel better? Lol
Sooooo the post game video started on the Bengals app and then it went down and the link has since disappeared for me. Anyone else having trouble?
"I’ve watched for about 30 years. This is the first time that I feel close to just giving up. There’s just zero joy involved in being a fan.

They seem hopeless, even with Burrow. Just too many   fundamental flaws within the organization."
Coaching staff is getting tossed in the offseason
Trade green for a lineman. Any one doesn’t matter
Why should we keep Zac Taylor? Is there any positives whatsoever? What has he brought to the franchise? This is just as bad and questionably worse than anything in Marvin lewis last two seasons. The defence was OK today. That is the only positive from this game. Fucking pathetic.
"Our defense actually looked really solid against a tough team today and the offense couldn't get it going. Then Zac Taylor rewards the D by playing for the loss on offense in the 4th. Take the starters out if you're giving up. Thats when it got embarrassing, I was fine losing a game we were supposed to lose up til that point"
"Here I am, missing Marvin Lewis... Why the fuck did we replace a mediocre NFL head coach with a guy who should be coaching pee wee"
We are embarrassing
Hire Marvin!
lol
"I know we had lots of other major problems, but play calling on 3rd down was atrocious. Tosses behind the line of scrimmage every singe time. If it didn’t work the first 10 times, just stop doing it. It’s literally not that hard."
They need to go out and get someone in on Oline either in FA or trade ASAP.
Anybody hear about DJ Reader?
I miss winning football.
Defense was super solid - OL blows - can't connect in the screen game for the second str8 season - lack of speed at WR is hurting their ability to take advantage of rushers - lack of a running game hurts everything else on offense.
AJ needs to go. For his sake and deserves it. He looks soulless out there. Maybe a veteran OL man in exchange so Joe doesn’t die this season.
Terrible
Boooooo
Better than losing by 36
"Going in we knew this was an L, however there was some definite positives. The defense played well against a solid offense. We are not a playoff team this year, but we don't need to just bash the team and point fingers. This sub is so negative."
"Bill O'Brien come on down, you're the next Bengals Head Coach"
Wait what why are calling Taylor a pussy? what i miss lmao

"Its a given, hes doomed under this line, coaching staff and ownership group. Sucks to be him"
Yes. I don't even think Burrow will stay healthy the whole season with the line the way it currently is

Fire Turner first!
Fuck Zac Taylor and this coaching staff. Nothing else to add. Dude has never been a good OC with his multiple chances. We settled on ZT over Eric Bieniemy! And now it's too late to get EB with the Texans job up for grabs and we'll be stuck with another year of running on 2nd and long.
Should be saying fire duke tobin.
"Our Offensive Line Coach (doesn't deserve her name dropped), needs to be fired, and at least three of these dudes need to be replaced this offseason."
How have the Bengals fucked aj green at all? To give him 17 mil+ after not playing in almost 2 years? By giving him the 2nd most targets? The defense played great today and the offense shot the bed. Either way Taylor has enough support from the locker room to play out his contract. Only way he gets fired before than is if he loses the locker room.
We never fucked AJ Green over... he's been hurt for two seasons and we gave him 18 million this year to shake the result off.
[removed]
Enough reason to fire Turner for me

We all just want the same kind of job security bengals coaches have. I think that’s why we’re actually pissed here /s
[removed]
What’s the point ? They know they played like shit and the o line blows and aj isn’t the same player anymore. Why feel the need to tel them 1000 more times
[removed]
Because this isn’t madden and nobody wants trash wide receivers.
[removed]
He is on pace to be sacked just over 70 times this season. That is unacceptable.
"I don't know what was going on today. I know everyone is frustrated right now, but some of that didn't even feel like Oline issues. Like, there were plays where the Ravens showed an obvious 6 man blitz while we're sitting in an empty set, and then Burrow takes an immediate hit because 5 guys can't block 6. There were also plays where Sample was expected to 1v1 starting defensive ends and HBs were expected to block for a gap cross field and nothing got adjusted pre-snap. Just felt like a horrible mix of bad oline play, bad play calling, and bad pre-snap adjustments"
Fire Jim Turner now.
It’s almost like he was drafted to the leagues worst team or something.....
I could do better on our o-line.
I'm getting sick of thinking maybe Bobby Hart is getting better. But he always gives up on blocking. As soon as they get past the line of scrimmage he basically just lets them go so they can sack Burrow.
You guys are fucked. Welcome to the next 20 years

"Well shit now the Brown family has to be thinking “SEE this is what happens when you spend money in free agency, they just get hurt and it doesn’t work.”"
"By god, that’s Penei Sewells music"

From bad to worse
Well for fucks sake just kick a guy in the nuts while he's down
COVID please end the season

Kms
Pain...every year...pain
Isnt this a record setting year for injuries for the league. Guess that's what happens when you rush to get a season in.
All the free agency acquisitions are getting injured. Typical luck
"So our top 2 FA signings might not even play this year? Just #bengalsthings

Edit: I've been drinking, but basically a wasted year which is just business as usual."
Natch
I swear we not only suck at functioning but we have the worst fucking luck ever
Ok how much opposition would there be to benching Burrow for his safety now that the season is shot
Snake bit man lol
When does next season start again? Can't wait for 2021-2022 season! LOL.
"Amateur coaching staff, lazy front office, and bad luck are a terrible combo."
[removed]
"Imo, the calls to fire ZT are a little premature. He got thrown into it late last year and had to run Marvins team/personnel last year. He finally got his QB and he has influenced the team to spend money and bring players in. He has demoted veterans that aren’t playing well. He is doing what we wanted for 15 years... but creating a winning culture takes time. When you come into a team where the O-line is one of the worst, it takes time to rebuild it. Outside of the o-line, we’re playing pretty good, still need to address areas but we have improved everywhere except the line. I think we need to give him a little more time. At least another draft and round of free agency. Thoughts?"
"ZT thought our offensive line was fine coming into the season, so...yes"
I think it could be time have him stop calling plays...
I really want to know why Adeniji hasn't even been given a shot at RT or RG
"I think Turner needs to be fired first. If Turner isn’t fired soon and we don’t win about 5-6 games this year and focus on the o-line this next season, then we consider firing ZT. Jim Mora had 3 years and went .500 with Peyton Manning before Tony Dungy came in."
I don’t know what he brings to the table as coach. He’s clearly not some sort of offensive genius. It doesn’t seem like he’s skilled at assembling a strong staff. So what does he do?
[deleted]
I've seen nothing so far that wants to make me keep him...not sure if that answers your question or not...
Not yet but Jim Turner needs to be jettisoned. You give a vote of confidence to this absolute atrocity of a line and it needs to be your head on the chopping block.
"I think in relation to his play calling, you can’t truly judge him fairly because of how bad the oline is. It limits why you can do as an offense. But you can blame him for not improving the oline."
"He did nothing for the offensive line.  It was ALWAYS where the time and the money should be going.

They just drafted their franchise quarterback.  Its time to get an offense that works and then rebuild the defense.  If Burrow was a vet free agent maybe that's different, but we are about to ruin the career arc of a potentially great player because we are too inept at judging the quality of our offense.

Did they really think that the only problem with our offense was Dalton?"
"David Shula had Boomer, Fulcher and a skeleton crew of the 1988 team in 1992 and still won 5 games. That ""winning culture"" everyone waited on then....... took another 13 years before Marv got them in the playoffs because Mike Brown stayed with the wrong head coaches for 3-5 years each in Shula, Coslet and LeBeau..

Jonah Williams is a ZT draft Pick

Bobby Hart got 3 yrs/21 Million **after** ZT had been named HC 2 months earlier.

Fred Johnson is his FA. Redmond was brought back by him 2 weeks ago. Michael Jordan looked like a high school player today and that pick is on ZT as well.

So basically except for moving Hopkins to center, the rest of the starting OL is all ZT, who rebuilt it into what is is today. Garbage. 

Marvin took a 2-14 to 8-8, 8-8 and playoffs in his 1st 3 years with what ? Chad and TJ were up and coming. Dillon was bitching and Rudi was a pre-season god only. Who was our OL in 2003 ?. Oh just some guys named Willie Anderson, Levi Jones , Steinbach, Richie Braham and Mike Goff.

Unless you are related to ZT, then the Jets game is our Super Bowl for the 1st or 2nd pick of the 2021 draft. I have not seen a Bengal team play that bad in 20 years. It was embarrassing watching some ass clown call running plays with 3 minutes left in the 1st half down 17."
" Not calling for his head...**yet** but isn't this the same mistake the Browns made with Hue Jackson? Just constantly denying any issues due to him being the new coach? A good coach should be able to raise a terrible team to at least mediocre and build from there, unless you're pulling a Flores or Johnson and intentionally tanking. That's not what we did last year. We did not try to tank last year, at least not until we pulled Dalton, we were just bad. This year the only thing that's showed improvement is our defense and only barely. If this season ends with only 2 or 3 wins, then we start calling for his firing because something is wrong."
"In a perfect world, we have Eric Bieniemy oh speed dial. But something tells me we're going to ride out Zac Taylor to at least the end of Burrows 5th year"
I think we just need an O-line
Yes. He's not it.
They are not premature. This guy obviously has no future so you need to just make the move and end it.
Yes. Last season is what got us Burrow but coaches that start out 0-11 and finish 2-14 don't go on to be winners. He should be gone after this season if not sooner.
I don't think you can fire him at this point but I am definitely a doubter now. We're going to have to see some major improvement from this team for me to think he should still be the head coach for next year.
Fire Duke Tobin. 4 seasons of bad OL help and continues to do as poor of a job fixing it as anyone. Now I sit here watching the Seahawks with DK Metcalf doing incredible things and Drew Sample struggles to get 5 targets a game!!
We should just hire mick Cronin
We can start by firing Jim Turner
Fire Zac and David bell on the same day
"Give him to the end of the year but then get a real coach in here while it's considered a ""desirable job"""
"Yep. It is time to fire Zac Taylor. He's 3-17-1 in 21 games. It has shown he is not fit for the job. But, what's more telling than the record is the quality of play that is put out there week after week. This is a team that routinely shows the same consistent lack of discipline and preparation, and the major issues continue to be the major issue with no improvement. And, what's worse than even that is that no strides have been made to fix those major issues. And, what's worse than even that, is that he says the concerns for these major issues which he refuses to address are overblown. And, what's worse than even that is that his ignorance and denial is going to squander the talent of the best potential player that has ever graced this franchise. And, what's yet worse than even that, is that even us armchair quarterbacks saw it coming.

Fuck that idiot. Ship him out and pack Jim Turner (and whoever else wants to go with them) with him. There's nothing whatsofuckingever premature about this stance."
[deleted]
They should get rid of him now but this franchise will likely wait until next season is over.
"I mean. If the team isnt willing to spend money to improve the weakness that everyone already knew was there, does it matter if we have a different HC?  The team has gotten much better this season and its showing.  The defense was improved.  


Until the Front Office decides to go out and sign some quality O-lineman though there really isnt a reason to think Zac Taylor is the problem.  Yall did this with Marvin as well.  Dude could win games in spite of the ownership and you still wanted him gone because you neglected to see the actual problem (And yes I was ready to move on from Marvin when we did so dont try to come at me with the craziness)"
Should have cut ties at 2-14
"Anyone saying to fire ZT is fucking stupid. Bottom line. 

He inherited a dog shit team. We tanked his first year to get a #1 QB pick to replace Dalton. Understandable, many teams have done it. This offseason was decimated by covid, and we didn't even have a preseason, so any plans to develop things with the new, young players started basically 5 weeks ago. He is hamstrung by Mike Brown's shitty, cheap ownership. We aren't going to break the bank on All Pro lineman. There's nothing ZT can do about that. The only option is to try and use draft picks and develop them. A couple were busts, it happens. He also can't go out every Sunday and say ""our O Line is dog shit sorry LOL"". Get real. And there's definitely no point in cutting anyone without viable replacements. 

Going into this game we were 1-2-1 with a flat 0 point differential. Last year we were 0-4 at -53. Let's see what happens."
"To me, he gets one more year. If we don’t have a winning record next year then we let him go."
"Hmmmm, he seems to be making some head scratching decisions. Example, yes the defense was bad last year we knew we were drafting burrow and our line was terrible. Why was Reader the big free agency splash and not O-Line? Hitting Jim Turner who has no track record of NFL success. You mention him having Marvins team but that was a roster that should be winning more than 2 games a season. Zac Taylor does not seem ready to be to a head coach. Honestly , Zac’s resume isn’t that great himself. QB coach for the Super Bowl Rams, a team without good Quarterback play."
Bill O’Brien redemption opportunity? Yes I get it he got fired but many good coaches do. He did well up until the last year or two- maybe being a GM/coach was too much to handle.
[deleted]
"Not gonna lie, I was a Tua truther all the way up until draft day and have since been cleansed and had my sins forgiven in the Church of Joe. But one aspect I never thought about is as good as I thought Tua was his surgically repaired hip would be in need of a geriatric walker through the first 5 games of the season.

Although today was more about game plan agasint the blitz than it was about the olines ineptitude, I'm glad we have a healthy and resilient QB thats not gonna play any different despite football hits. Long live the King of Ohio."
This is the reason Miami isn't playing him. They have a lot of spending money this off-season and will probably spend most of it on refitting their offensive line. For now they're throwing out Fitzmagic to ruin their chances at another high draft pick.
[deleted]
"And it started before today. People were saying he's not trying, he's given up, he's not showing effort...the man is a SHELL of himself. His body has betrayed him. It's not lack of effort or will, he's hurt. He can barely cut. 

I refuse to let this team, franchise, front office, whatever...take away all of the good memories and what AJ Green has given us over the years and somehow manipulate me into not liking him. My friends are already talking shit about him. 

It's not AJ! It's the freaking organization. Corey Dillion, Takeo Spikes, Carson Palmer, Andy Dalton, and now...AJ Green. Don't let this team manipulate you into having a bad taste in your mouth over another beloved player and all around class guy.

There's a reason why all these guys want to be traded. Damn."
"Seriously AJ is an all time great Bengal, and he's been a class act the whole time. Absolute non diva and carried the team year after year. Hate to see people here turning on him. 

Yeah he's been pretty bad this year.
Though what do people on here expect? Players become worse as they age, especially if they go through multiple injuries."
AJ isn't the first frustrated Bengal to want out. He won't be the last and he's certainly won't be the most bitter. . It seems he isn't gelling with Burrow and Taylor's system. See if you can trade him for some O-Line help and move forward. I hope he finds success on the next team.
"I mean absolutely no disrespect by this but aj is either not trying his best out there or he isnt good anymore.

I dont know which is more upsetting to me."
"Trade him? For what?? No one would give you anything for him, he didn’t play the last two years basically and he still hasn’t shown up this year.."
"I posted during the game but of course the mods removed it.  When an INT was thrown, he didnt chase the guy w the ball but instead starting to run vertical upfield. It made no sense. It also showed me.....he's not here amymore.  Sad."
"This team didn’t mouth those words today, and frankly, this team has give him a tonne. He’s still butthurt, but AJ honestly seemed to sour at the end of last season."
Did you not see the many articles last season addressing this? Dehner and Morrisson more or less confirmed that he did quit/give up on the team/season.
"What people don’t realize is this man is fighting for his career. He’s been plagued with injuries for over 2 years now. The hamstring explains it all, since week one he’s been slow to get up from EVERY play. You have to be blind to say he’s 100% healthy. And honestly he doesn’t have a choice this time to sit out until he’s healthy. He’s sat out almost 2 years, if he sits out anymore he won’t be employed next year. It’s a cut throat league and he doesn’t have a choice but to play through it. So yes now his frustrations are probably bubbling up."
"I came here as a Ravens fan to say that I am not accepting any AJ Green slander. Some dumbass sports writer from Yahoo is trying to push a narrative that he doesnt try and gave up on that pick play. The ball was over his head by like 10 feet. Its not space jam. 

Does his contract suck? Yup. Is he a shell of who he was? Yup. But he is an all time great imo for the Bengals and might as well pay a dude that gave you so much when you arent going to the playoffs this year."
"I love AJ, and if we create a Bengals hall of fame (kind of like how baseball teams have their own HOF) he would definitely get in, but he is just out of it this year. I mean mentally, I actually think trading him would be a good idea, send him to a young team with a young QB in need of veteran WR, maybe the Giants or Jets, or maybe the Chargers?"
"I would’ve agreed before today. He didn’t have any fire in him today or the whole season tbh... he stopped on routes, didn’t even try. He didn’t want to be anywhere near peters on the INT. Then he gets hurt, sits on the bench and mouths what we all know is essentially trade me. I’m still a fan, and I want the best for him. But he needs to be traded, along with Dunlap, Geno, etc. We’re in a rebuild. Need picks and younger, cheaper players and need to bolster Oline and defense"
"I love AJ. He carried us to some of the highest highs (and in my lifetime, to arguably our peak). I don't blame him for wanting to be done, with the organization or the coaching staff.

But he def gave up today. And I even understand not wanting to get injured on the INT return (look at Dak getting wrecked on the franchise tag). But I don't know how else to describe it than as giving up.

He's hurt and he's out of it and I hope he finds a way to recover from both, with us or someone else (Packers?)."
"Ah, the posts about how I can't be upset with a player because he's a class act. I love these. 


AJ is done. He gave up today."
"\>  Andy Dalton 

Hahahahahaha. Fuck, you almost had me, then you threw in dalton's name. That's good.

And somehow you forgot Whitworth. I hate me some Bengals ownership too, but Dalton was ass. He's had some good teams that he's completely shit the bed with. I was there at 2 of his playoff games. I'll tell you one thing: I do NOT fucking miss every other pass attempt getting batted down at the line of scrimmage; dude fucking sucked, and his garbage stats speak for themselves."
"I’m a huge AJ fan. The thought of letting him walk/trading him in the offseason pissed me off. 

Class act or not, he isn’t performing. I didn’t expect him to be a top receiver in the league but it’s been bad. I think we have the weapons to fill the void that he’d leave. 

If we can find a team that would bite on a trade and get a decent OL out of the deal, I’d be thrilled. Burrow needs help. We all knew it but this week should have brought some urgency to the front office. Even if we can’t get a star OL, they need to do SOMETHING to try to help him. I understand we aren’t playing for a super bowl but we can’t let Burrow get beat to hell every week. If they don’t address the OL, I want them to bench Burrow so he can live to see another year."

"I’ll start:

God damn that was a pathetic performance by the offense. Defense actually played decent but the Reader injury now fucks up everything for the rest of the season. Why? Why can we not for once just have some little shred of injury luck? RIP to the dream of seeing Geno and DJ playing together this season. 

Don’t even get me started on the OL. It’s disgusting. Burrow is eventually gonna get busted up really bad after one too many of these hits. The entire offense flows through him and if we can’t keep him upright there’s no way any kind of offense gets produced whatsoever. Oh and the cherry on top is that AJ Green  staying and having success in Cincy is most likely donezo. He looked livid sitting on the bench “injured” when he also may have said “just trade me”. 

Did I miss anything?

I’m upset. End story. Your turn"
We did a great job on Lamar for the most part. Our o line is a dumpster fire and why we weren’t even competitive. Zac Taylor being ok with their performance is starting to make me dislike him.
fuck
I'm ready for next week.
"I think it’s time to bring John Ross out of the doghouse. He’s still not good, but the offense NEEDS a speed guy who can take the top off of defenses. Baltimore just blitzed every down and played their corners up to not allow short/medium passes, and it paid off because Boyd/Higgins are great receivers but nobody is expecting them to catch 40+ yard bombs. 

I’d just rather demote Erickson, have Brandon Wilson return both kickoffs and punts in order to bring Ross back to help open up the field with his vertical threat."
"Hot take. Line isn't bad because of talent but rather terrible coaching. 

Turner and Lou need to be gone the day after the last game or Taylor is dead to me."
"It’s a rebuilding year and we have a shitty team. Frankly I’m surprised we have one win. We will be good again in the next few years, you all need to fucking chill."
"Even with Joe, we will never beat Lamar or Mahomes when it counts in the next decade because our organization is so inadequate."
Defense played good not just decent
Everything right here is perfectly said
💯💯💯💯💯💯💯
I’ll say it again- bench Joe until this shit gets straightened out. He’s getting hammered physically and eventually he’ll start seeing ghosts mentally.
"I never saw a play where he seemed hurt. It feels like the team just said ""hamstring"" so they weren't disrespectful to AJ. The truth is that the team is better off with Boyd, Higgins, and Tate over AJ."
What I get from it. Benched and they said Hammy so he wasn't embarrassed.
"It seems that way. I’d agree about being better off, we just need some speed in the WR room..."
On the pick burrow threw he looked like he just gave up. I think he’s injueed
"If we got news tommorow that we traded an green for a 3rd round pick would you be upset?

I think I might want that to happen."
Green said it multiple times that he only wanted to play with Dalton and it shows. He hasn't done anything this year expect pocket 17 mil and go half assed.
"I think his ankle was fine at the end of last year. He just quit.

He’s just collecting a paycheck now"
Ugly Dak injury...
He immediately gets sacked 😂
"Dak just got his ankle turned sideways. Hes going to be done for the year. 

Hope Burrow watches and learns from that play. SLIDE FEET FIRST PEOPLE. Prescott could have avoided disaster if he hasnt went head on to a DB who pinned his foot under him."
"Stunt on them hoes, Andy."
Watch him drive down the field to win this game
Cowboys gonna go and win every game this season with Andy and lose their first playoff game lol
Annnnd he fumbles leading to a Giants TD.....
What are the chances Dalton has more wins this year than Burrow?
Looks like Dak's year could be done from the initial reactions. I'm just glad to see AD playing in his home state. Hopefully he has a chance to put up some good tape for another contract somewhere. Go get 'em tiger!!
" pretty much loathe the cowboys, this might be the only time i've ever rooted for them."
I’m dialed in. LETS GO ANDY!!!!
"God I really hope the giants win, giants gonna take sewell.."
[removed]
"If Dalton stays healthy he's going to be starting against us in Week 14

Thats going to be FUN"
The storylines always find their way! I’m pumped
Didn’t even think about that. That would be really cool!
If Louisiana Jesus hasn’t been crucified by a DE
"I hope he absolutely shreds us. Will be the first game I've ever rooted against the Bengals in. I know that's going to be a minority opinion, but idc. We shafted him so hard last year and he took so much unnecessary hate from everyone for so long that I hope he has his best game of his career against us."
That's going to be a very emotional game.
What’s the over/under for total sacks in the game?
[deleted]
LET'S FUCKING GO ANDY!!! FIRST APPEARANCE FOR THE COWBOYS ENDS IN A GAME-WINNING DRIVE!
"I have a reason to not hate the cowboys 

I'm conflicted"
"Bah God, is that Christian rock playing?"
"I feel so bad for Dak but so happy for Andy. This year proves definitively he wasn't the problem, and while I am all aboard the Burrow train, I really want Dalton to have success in Dallas."
It’s like Ironman suiting up
Oh my gosh we really are gonna see Andy vs Joe aren’t we
"Hide your chili, Andy is up."
How do I watch when I’m in the Cleveland vs Indy market?
[deleted]
Very happy for Andy. He will be a starter again next year (guessing for Colts)
Did the cowboys recover the fumble?
I am all of a sudden heavily invested in the Cowboys season.
"It felt so weird watching Andy in a Cowboys uniform. 

I didn’t get truly invested in the Bengals until around 2013, when I truly got into football. Andy has always been my QB since I’ve been a fan. Watching him play for another team, is just... strange."
IT'S BOSS TIME
"Up to this current point, Andy Dalton on the Cowboys was fucking hilarious to me. After the game, everyone would be shaking hands, and Dalton would just be smiling ear to ear, just happy to be a part of the team. Reminds me of when my grandfather and my father were building our deck when I was five, and I brought out my plastic toolset to help them out. Obviously he’s more useful than that but his facial expressions always struck me as a bit child like.

Cowboys: YEAH WE DID IT WE WON THE GAME WOOOOO

Dalton, with a huge smile on his face: And I helped!"
"Bummer for Dak, but I'm happy Andy get's a chance to shine. He deserves a starting job!"
Anyone else disappointed he didn’t dye his hair blue?
"""Is that Andy Dalton's theme playing?!"" 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZGhaBEVCM"
"Cowboys fan here. I never hated the Bengals or Dalton, he always seemed like he tried his hardest in the games I did see. From a Bengals fans perspective what should we expect given Dallas's current state.

Starting LT,RT, and C (who was a backup anyway) are all out and replaced by a rookie we drafted (C) and two UDFA's at LT, RT
Our starting TE is out as well, but our backup has been kinda solid.
The whole defense seems to be in shambles with I'd  say 1 key injury and couldn't even hold the Giants below 30"
Mother fucking Andy Dalton
Never has Amy Grant instilled such fear.
I miss this man in stripes
Makes me happy you bengals fans love the guy so much .
"I won’t lie, I’m obviously always going to be sad that Dak’s not out there, but I am excited to see what Dalton can do with our monster receiving corps.  

That bomb he threw to Michael Gallup tonight to win the game was beautiful."
"I was just talking to my dad on Sunday morning about how the only way we could see Andy Dalton play against the Bengals this season is if something happened to Dak Prescott, making him unable to play. I told my dad I doubt it would happen too.

I jinxed the Cowboys, but we'll probably get to see Andy Dalton face the Bengals this season."
"Thanks for the laugh, man :)

-	Cowboys fan"
I love Captain Ginger. always a standup guy.
"Cowboys fan here.

I’m glad the Red ~~Rocket~~ Riffle is getting someone PT.

Especially considering he’s the best ginger in the NFC East."
I’m an LSU fan and a Cowboys fan so I think I’m gonna  stick around on this reddit if that’s cool.
That is fucking hilarious!
Week 14. He’s coming to wreak havoc in Cincy
"He lacks pocket presence, which is exactly why he will fucking thrive in Dallas, because they actually understand why you protect your qb. If teams overload blitz him, he will lose. If OL holds up, they could make a run out of the ridiculously terrible NFC east. Specifically, he folds under pressure 100% of the time."
"We’re a fucking nightmare, to the fans.  And it’s not even wholly the teams fault all of the time. 

1. Reds go on an awesome streak, make the playoffs and shit the bed by being shutout for the entire series. 

2. FC Cincinnati just can’t seem to get it going.  High hopes, Low results.  I’ll still give them a couple years being they’re a new team but it’s not looking good.

3.  Trae Waynes out, Mackenzie Alexander out, DJ Reader done for the year, AJ Green looking more like he could be done forever, can’t separate and can’t make a contested catch.  Uzomah looking good, done for the year.  

Just can’t catch a break.  If we ever get time travel I’m going back and saving Bo Jackson’s hip and making sure they can’t force Marge to sell the team.  There has to be someway to break this curse.

Also, Fuck the Steelers.

ETA:  If Dalton wins a playoff game for Dallas I’ll fucking cry."
Its been a very nice 25 years to be a Bearcat! I won't spend a dime on the Bengals...UC gets all my money. They actually deserve it.
"But I’m excited for Andy to get another shot, in his home state no less. Go get em Red Rifle!"
Tuned in to see him fumble geez
Meh so far.
I wanted him to earn the spot. Not like this. I hope Andy does well.
I'm happy for Andy. He deserves to be far away from Mike Brown's dumpster fire.
I was so wrong about you.... So wrong... I need you in my life so hard.... I wanna make it right with you.... Come back home and I'll make everything feel alright... Xoxo
Roman or Bieniemy would you like to come on down to a questionably functional franchise we have sadness and Joe Burrow
It was time for Marvin to go but he is definitely a wayyy better football mind/coach than Zac.
"Marvin's time was up but he will always be twice the coach Taylor is. I know the kids here don't remember this but Marvin Lewis took a 2-14 team and went 8-8 in his first season with Jon Kitna at QB, whereas Zac Taylor took a 6-10 team and made them 2-14."
Yeah you’re stupid

""
I think they have plenty of weapons in Dallas lol
Why would they him pay $12-$13 million for the rest of the season to be their WR4 when they have issues elsewhere?
Yea im getting my first look at Dallas for the season now. They have plenty of talent in that position.
I hope you win a playoff game for the Cowboys.
He is going to win this game for the Cowboys.
Sucks for Dak. Feel really bad for him. But I can be a Dallas fan for awhile! Andy's got a nice OLine. Would love to see him succeed!
Andy is dropping fucking dimes
I knew he was going to win the game when the Giants had to punt with 1 minute left.  I'm adopting the Cowboys as my second team now that Andy is starting the rest of the season
Throwing laser bombs out there.  Damn
HE DID IT!!!!!
Cowboys fan here. What should i expect from him? Hes got killee targets but will have to work behind a slapped together o-line. Please make me feel better. Im begging you.
Week **14** just got real interesting.
"I don’t wanna live in a world where the Cleveland Browns are actual playoff contenders.

The thought alone terrifies me."
I dont really care about that as much as I hate that our coaching staff is satisfied with our oline
"ehh let them have a winning season and a playoff run that team and fan base deserves it after all the bullshit that teams been through, im more concerned about joe burrow being behind that o line. i really dont want him to pull an Andrew luck"
"Disgusts me. We have the better QB in so many ways. 

Yet......ughhhhh"
It happens every now and then
When they invest in the team in the right areas and put their players in spots to be successful it's going to happen. We are the new browns.
The Bengals are too shitty to be concerned about what any other team is doing.
Look at what Andy just did.
You win games in the trenches. Not a secret yet teams struggle to realize this
that was a blatant offensive holding
Way to go red rifle
Very happy for him
Love it for him
Amazing what he can do with a passable offensive line. Taylor absolutely disrespected him last year. I hope he kills it for the Cowboys.
https://streamable.com/ke8fux
Andy was always pretty good in the end of the game 2 minute drill.
Against the Giants. Call me when he does it against an actual NFL team.

ANDY WON A GAME WITH A DEEP BALL?????????
Really happy for him
Fuck yeah Dalton! That might have been the first time I rooted for the Cowboys
Who Dey!
"Fun fact: 5 years ago on this date, October 11th, Dalton did a similar thing leading us to a game winning FG in OT against the Seahawks."
"Dalton did this all the time for the Bengals, not surprising."

"After a horrible loss today it was good to see him come out make that play, and win it for a good dude."
Way to go Andy. That was an impressive outing
Lord forgive me but I'm about to be a Cowboys supporter

It's gonna be extremely bittersweet watching Dalton light them up
Low key I'm happy to have another team to enjoy watching
I can wear my dalton jersey one last time
""
"I’m more focused on him giving up on the catch, it doesn’t look good in defense of AJ there. Old AJ darts in the air and somehow comes down with ball."
"His attitude changed after they benched Dalton last year. Before Andy was benched, he wanted to finish his career here and set more records. As soon as he was benched, he started talking about going wherever the money was and not wanting the Tag. He got the Tag, and thinks he deserves more but hasn't shown it. They should try and trade him off now and get something instead of waiting around like they did with Dalton."
My only thought and I’m a huge AJ fan is that he’s trying to run up the field for a goal line tackle? Right?
"He wants out as it is obvious with that ""if you are not playing me, trade me"" vid floating around. That pass was 5 feet over his head and he was not sure where it was at. Even the great lord and savior ZT agreed in post game.

Hobson's job is to spin everything the Bengals do negative into a positive. He has done that for 20 years. so he posts his daily articles everything is roses down at PBS. ZT has given him weekly interviews and Marv really was not like that, so Hobson is a all-in ZT guy for his own benefit.

There are many players that are not ZT fans, but lets keep in mind of a certain rule you cannot badmouth the organization {cough... Carl Pickens}

So now people bad mouth AJ and Carlos because that is what some Bengals fans do. They pick a guy or 2 every year who had a above average career and say they are shit now.

No... ZT is shit and makes David Shula out to look like Lombardi in Bengal HC history."
" AJ Green is NOTHING like Pre 2019 AJ Green , I do not know if his body is just that broken down or if He really doesn't want to be out there anymore. More likely it is  a combination of both. He used to be a top 5 wideout but in all seriousness I do not know if he is a top 5 wr on this roster, all good things come to an end and the bengals have obviously held on at least 1 year too long. I know this much if the bengals had a smart(er) front office that 18,000,000 would have been spent much more wisely on any position other than WR!"
AJ green lost all my support today. He’s turned into a bitch.  He’s scared to play.
AJ will be one of my all time favorites even if it looks like it’s going to end on a sour note. The writing is on the wall he isn’t the same player basically being almost 2 years of being out of it and it’s clear the team has moved to Higgins Boyd and Tate as the top 3 receivers. Reality is we’re not winning with that kind of o line we have. Ross and Green won’t be here next season. That’s pretty much a given. Ross should be traded for anything at this point.
"Okay one thing, green has been dealing with a hamstring probably all year. That's first off, and it was bothering him more this week. That's probably why, he didn't go for that ball or the chase down (even though he should of). Second thing is I don't believe that video of where AJ is saying trade me, is complete unbelievable. He doesn't act like that, never has, never will. We don't know what was said on the field, so we can't just say, green wants out. 


Just give Green a couple weeks to get back and you will see the difference. I don't think he is back to full strength yet, if nothing changes passed week 10 then it's time to cut him. But I believe in AJ Green, he has always been here for us and now it's time for us to stick up for him."
"I literally have a signed picture of AJ on my living room wall. So understand, I am a HUGE AJ fan. Or was. This play broke my heart. He’s been seemingly absent from the team so far, he’s not producing at all. He doesn’t look as fast as he used to for one, but then this happened. He so clearly gave up on the play, and then didn’t try to tackle Peters on the return. I watched another play where Sample did a 180 and laid out for a ball he was never gonna catch. HE TRIED THOUGH. AJ Green is the Joey Votto of the Bengals. Was a definite HOFer before getting injured and simply hasn’t been the same since. Idk if it’s him having trouble coming off the injury or just him phoning it in waiting to leave Cincy. Either way it hurts"
"Just cut his ass. If you don’t, you endorse this behavior.

So much for the culture change"
Again I’m not turning this into a Clickbait conversation but it was pretty damn telling today that he is not interested in being here you could see it with his verbal and nonverbal’s on the sideline
"I told you all he wasn't worth bringing back. When he told the organization it needed to take care of him after his bum ass sat on the side lines for 2 seasons, I knew he wasn't worth the cost of his cleats. Dude's a scumbag."
"Hey Bengal bros! Just want to thank you all for giving us Andy Dalton. Unfortunately my wife has her coworker D’erik over every Sunday and they kick me out of the house because they need the whole place to themselves to focus on work projects. So I usually can’t watch as many games as I want, and I just realized I don’t really know much about my new staring QB. Any insight you all could give on Dalton would be great. Thanks!"
"Slightly off-topic and maybe not my place to say this, but that whole your wife kicking you out of your house for D'erik thing just sets off a couple red flags with me I'm not gonna lie lol"
This post has to be a joke. Right? Right?
Do you know if D’erick can block?
The NFC east is dreadful; keep Andy healthy and you'll win the division.  The Red Rifle will deliver!
"Well Dalton really is a great QB. He utilizes...wait a second.

After thinking about your situation, I’ve determined this D’erik sounds like a trustworthy, standup dude. Definitely comes off as a chaperone more than anything. Nothing to read into there!"
"Dalton is a terrific human being and a very capable Quarterback. He doesn't have amazing anything, but he's got a good arm and is pretty great at pre-snap adjustments. He won't lose you a game, but he isn't going to pull some miraculous hero moment to win you one either. Put him behind a serviceable O-Line and give him a decent RB to hand off to and you'll stay in games!"
"Honestly you lucked into a good catch with him.

He’s a top 10 QB when he has talent around him.

Even with your o-line injuries he’s battle tested in that regard with the shit line we had last year."
All I will say is don’t get too excited when the playoffs come around.
Username checks out.
"Game manager. But he’s solid when surrounded by talent. Not good under pressure. Better hope the oline holds up well but if it does he will make plays. He’s fairly accurate. Will have no trouble getting ball to Gallup, cooper, and lamb. I really don’t think you’ll lose much with him at QB over Dak. Just need to rely on run game a little more"
"Given the number of times Borrow has been sacked it’s only a matter of time before he faces the fate as Dak :(

Glad to see Andy’s still got it"
Lol
"This is a top level troll right here. 5/7

It's amazing how many moron Andy Dalton Bengals fans you hooked too that answered in earnest. They most likely still think Dalton was a good qb."
"How small is your place that you have to leave so they have space for ""work projects""/ are you and the missus Texas Fun Couple on Onlyfans?"
"Solid player can probably do well in the Cowboys offense but he’s not Dak. On another note, wtf is going on at your house?"
""
Good for AD.  I hope he has a great year.  Guy got way too much blame for the shit that happened in Cincy over the years.
Really happy for Andy. I’ll be watching the Cowboy games now that he’ll be starting. Hope he continues to do well.
What a throw to gallop down the sideline!  Go cowboys!!  Never thought I'd say that..  lol
"Obviously, though,  he was definitely the problem with the Bengals."
Lets go joltin’ ginger!
Miss you sweet ginger boy!
""
Lol he’s going to kick the shit out of the Bengals. I have no doubt in my mind
Andy is going to be dropping those 🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼🤟🏼
"As a Bengals fan I say I hope he completely destroys us. I hope he is the last straw, if that is what it takes, to get Zak canned.

The guy stood by this organization, never bad-mouthed it or the ineptitude of the front office. He played to win, he never gave up and he would have stayed if they let him.

He deserves the satisfaction of crushing this team."

Great use of that meme lol

I doubt they even make the playoffs but ngl I'd love to see Andy pull a Foles and go clutch a superbowl outta nowhere

I say this with no biasness at all
"I already said this, but I think Zimmer is gonna retire at the end of the season, if anything."
They JUST reupped his deal in July for 3 more years. Would be a shit business decision.
I want him. For DC. Not for HC.
"For real, who in their right mind goes for it on 4th and 1 from inside the 10 yard line, up by 5 with less than 2 minutes against the Seahawks...

Just fire him already..."

Burrow needs a better O Line around him tbh"
"There is a lot of ""Worst thing about this OLine is x"".  The most alarming thing to me about the OLine is that the front office saw the issues and did very little to address it. They see the weakness in it now and are doing very little to address it."
[removed]
"Oh yeah, and what’s Frank Pollack doing?"
"Paul Alexander was bad , no doubt. But the Bengals have exceeded themselves with Jim Turner. Yesterday Jonah played like a rookie. Tre Hopkins was the best lineman we had, and guards graded out in the 40's.... The consistent Bobby Hart was consistently  bad, as usual.

If they are going to scrub John Ross every game. A.J. wants to be traded, Dunlap  demoted to pass rushing only, and Geno is on a snap  count.  Isn't  it time to make some trades? 

While none of these players is going to get us much, how about moving Gio? There are some screening trapping teams that could use him, and maybe trade us a guard?Tackle even right tackle probably out of the question, but maybe a guard? Or, Zac might have to give up the 3 Wr scheme and play Joe and Gio at the same time to pick up blitzes? Play them as split backs? Anything? Please?"
How many times this season has Sample been assigned to block a DE ?? The Scheming on this team is failing pre-snap. We can’t even evaluate any of our skilled position players when things are like this.
Paul Alexander was not that bad compare to Jim Turner. Jim Turner is straight up trash and a giant jackass off the field.
Why does half this sub think we can trade lesser pieces for lineman. No one will trade lineman for scraps.
I don't understand how this O-line can be so bad. These are all huge guys from top notch college programs. It seems crazy that they can't be coached up to be at least respectable.
"I don’t see someone trading for AJ, he makes too much money and has looked horrible.

John Ross might fetch a 5th rounder. Dunlap...maybe a 4 or 5, he makes good money and hasn’t looked very good.

I’d shop Gio if we can get a 3rd back. He’s one piece we could move for a decent return. I want to hold on to Geno Atkins though.

I’m open to being a seller but not a buyer. We can fix the Oline in the offseason, not able to right now unfortunately.

I know Joe wants to win games but he needs to protect himself. He may start having to throw the ball away considerably more, even if just for this year."
"We've got solid offensive skill position players, we've got an incredible young LB corp and solid DBs - we need to fortify the big men in the trenches on both sides - protect our QB and get after their QB. The increased pressure and ability to stop the run on the line will let our LBs make tackles in the gaps. What we are currently faced with is the opponent's OL getting solid blocks on the second level and allowing gashing runs. Additionally, with no pressure on the QB our DBs are forced to cover for an impossibly long time. The lack of protection for Burrow is going to be a problem. Defenses focus on pressure and denying the short game and their pass rush doesn't allow time for a deep threat too often.  Fix the trenches and we are a playoff contender."
Gio the guy actually making blocks while the offensive line misses them? No thanks.
"Gio is almost 29 years old and everyone in the league knows the more Gio plays is only a matter of time before he gets injured. Plus he is another Bengal with a contract that most teams will not find friendly. My question is you have a 5'11"" 240 LB back in Perine who gets no offensive snaps.

There might be 30-33 players left from Marv's 2018 team. The excuse I have seen on other posts is ZT needs to build a team, but technically, almost half of the roster and PS is his guys in less then 2 seasons. You cannot just trade veteran leadership because you don't like them.

David Shula {19-52} wiped out the roster in less then 5 years. By his firing in 1996, only 2 Bengals from the 88 super bowl team remained. Joe Walter and Lee Johnson. The team then spent 1996-2002 as a laughingstock and for every Dillon and Spikes they drafted, there was just not enough talent to build.

Zac Taylor is doing the same thing. Why would you keep Finley when Mariota {knowing he would not beat out Carr} could have provided veteran leadership to Burrow ? Why did Jordan Evans get a INT and Fumble last week and not play this week ? Why is Vonn bell getting 95% of the snaps and Shawn Williams is getting 1 tackle a game ? Tate wants out as well, so what happens when AJ, Ross and Tate go ????  Higgins, Boyd and Mike fucking Thomas ?

Notice the trend. ? Many Marvin guys are not getting snaps. ZT is wiping away that roster with  his evaluation in talent to replace them. 

Take away the tie and Zac is on pace for 9-51 in his first 60 decisions and there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Peter King talks about David Carr, but go take a look at Archie Manning's career with the Saints. 

That could be Burrow's career 6 to 7 years from now. 30 years old and shell shocked because a QB coach turned HC wants his 53 guys and has horrible play calling he refuses to give up.

Meanwhile Alex Van Pelt is 4-1 as OC of the Browns and changed Mayfields footwork.

The moral of this novel is Zac Taylor needs to be canned before he destroys this team into being 1991-2002 all over again.."
"None of the players you listed are worth someone that will instantly fix our O Line problems. Ross is shit, Green is past his prime, if Geno returns to pre-injury strength when he's 100% there's no way I want him gone, and Geno and Dunlap are average. 

Trading them for draft picks instantly turns this into another tank season, which I think would be okay but the idiots in this sub will just get even more mad."
"Zac Jackson needs to go as well. He did not know how to counter the blitzing from Baltimore. It was amateur hour in terms of offensive play calling in that game. Then kicking a field goal at the end of the game, to save face was, just the cherry on top of the disaster."
I think some back up guards might be had
God the shitty takes in this sub are becoming unfathomable.
"A lot of the issues we had Sunday were due to failure to pick up a blitz. I haven't yet rewatched but it looked to me that we did much better when they didn't blitz. They just had no answers. Now, a lot of teams couldn't handle that D. 5 or 6 guys can't block 6 or 7 guys. I think the play calling was terrible and they knew this was coming. I truly believe there isn't an easy one answer fix. It's technique, scheme, and talent. I suspect Burrow had issues pre-snap. Ultimately it's on Zac. We have had a year and a half of this and something has to change. 

As far as trading to get a savior lineman, forget it. We need to keep our draft picks and then dump veteran talent in the off-season. Then pay the piper and get a line in free agency. IF they can get a RT tackle and Guard FA then draft a WR to replace AJ."

"I'm not an ""office"" side of sports guy.  I live in Baltimore and am a Bengals fan.  I was young when the Colts left and my dad is from Cincinnati.  My wife was asking some football history questions about the Browns moving here and becoming the Ravens, but the Browns still existing.  So I was hitting wiki to relay the facts.  All that to say, of all the teams I looked at while going down that rabbit hole, the Bengals were the only one that have the owner, president and general manager as the same person.  I see talk on here of hiring a good GM, but I had no clue how dysfunctional our front office ""responsibilities""  truly were.

&#x200B;

TL:DR  Why in the hell does one guy think he can be the owner, president and GM successfully?"
Same reason he thinks we don't need a scouting department or indoor practice facility despite being located in Ohio.
I'm not sure it's as much Mike Brown thinking he's the best as it is just Mike Brown being a cheapskate that doesn't want to pay more people than he believes is necessary.
"Mike Brown is just old and stubborn, whilst it seems like Katie and her husband are slowly gaining control, we’ve kinda seen the team side of things excel... slightly. This last off-season we actual made FA moves, to help fix the defense, which has actually helped.... I do not wish anything to happen to Mike Brown, but if he fully retired, you’d probably see the team move in a better direction."

"Nah, Duke is the GM without the official title. This is not a Jerry’s world situation."
"I dont have a problem with how our front office works.

If we had success we would probably talk about how good a system it is.

That being said obviously when they make mistakes you wonder why they arent setup like a normal nfl front office.

I dont really think our front office is uniquely dysfunctional because of it though."

"Nah, that's dumb. No need to stunt Burrow's growth completely.

Instead, run the ball more. Sometimes even in passing situations. Will we be as competitive? No. Will Burrow survive? Yes."
Should just forfeit the rest of the games so no one gets hurt.
This dude needs to go.
Very curious to know what Darrin Simmons quietly thinks about all this. He’s seen a lot of coaches come and go. I wonder what he thinks of Turner.
He was a fucking disgrace before he got here and he has only cemented that further. At least he seems to have kept his stupid mouth shut for once during his time here.
Yeah him and Zac Taylor. I'd let Zac Taylor have the rest of the season then fire him and hire an experienced coach.
Where’s the change.org petition
Why not fire Zac Taylor? Isn’t he the one accountable overall?
& Zac Taylor
The vibe in here is that you think you they should be undefeated right now. There are reasons they only won 2 games just don't fire every coach and turn into the Browns. They need an Oline and there isn't much you can do until the off-season to fix that issue.
He’s bad but so is our line talent
"If we were 4-0 right now, I swear to christ some of y'all would *still* find someone that needs to be fired. The one thing they could do that would make me happy is get rid of Bobby Hart. He gets pushed back and ran over so much that the fucker might as well have roller skates on. I honestly don't know what some of us are expecting right now, especially since our off- and pre-season were so spectacularly hosed. If we can keep Burrow alive until we can get an o-line, then next year will be good. This year has plenty of time to turn out okay, so why not be a little patient? Good luck to us all."
Good lord yall are depressing.
"You mean, ""Fire Zach Taylor"" campaign, there fixed it for you."

Who would take on that contract for the product you have seen him put onto the field?

"He's not looking like he is worth the $18m this season, but I'm not sold he's over. 

He hasn't looked good at all yet, and has the hamstring issue after Sunday, but completely writing him off is a bit overboard to me."

What u say
You’re doing the Reddit wrong

Its gonna be a long year
Just wake me up when its time to draft again.
From what I saw it looked like he dislocated his elbow. It was after a non-eventful run play. Still standing he's holding his left arm and it looked to me like his elbow was popping out of place. Jogged to the sideline and they took him right into the tent.
TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK TANK
This Dline is in trouble haha.
"To be honest I don't really care about this injury in terms of our D-line strength. Hubbard bites on play fakes, bounces off the ball carrier, or slides off a tackle attempt. His sacks always come as clean up when it is 7 seconds into a play and the QB was chased toward him. He was overhyped by OSU fans a couple years ago and hasn't lived up to it.

Edit: Glad to see OSU fans still at work. Every OSU player on our team is garbage lol"

Not like this season was going anywhere anyway. Im going to sleep Wake me up when we got a competent o-line

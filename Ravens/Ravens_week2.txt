"Browns fans are really mad that Baker Mayfield couldn't single-handedly and magically turn around their pitiful culture. 

One of them even called Lamar a ""System QB"". Maybe he is. If being a ""system"" QB means that we have set him up for success and have actively built around, and supported him, rather than expected him to magically fix everything, then call him a system QB. That's what a *WINNING* organization does. 

Bottom-feeders. Looking forward to challenging Pittsburgh for AFCN supremacy. You know... as always."
Was it worth it
"He keeps making me look stupid every offseason where I question him or have criticisms about what he can do. I was saying he might not have enough zip. Questioned his deep ball accuracy. Questioned the work he was putting in this offseason. Then he clearly answered all three questions. He reads the defense well, steps up, and throws dimes. 

His progress is just insane. He’s already making that transition into the Russell Wilson type QB much faster than anyone thought. 

Watching him, especially in contrast to Baker, it’s obvious he just “gets it”. He understands what a good QB is supposed to do and executed those things."
People questioned how hard he worked during the offseason? That's a good joke.
"He is so much more comfortable in the pocket and way less rushed and erratic when locating an open target. It looks like he is just seeing the field better. Super psyched about the clear work he’s put in to his throwing mechanics, as well. How lucky are we?"
i was surprised he didn't run all that much yesterday. lol just feeling nostalgic ha
"I’m glad you posted this, because I don’t have another outlet for my observations. He had a pass to Mark Andrews in the second half for about 15, 20 yards that was just so perfect. Also the way he looked off the safeties to the right before tossing the touchdown to the left. Probably my two favorite players from him yesterday. Also I think he took maybe three sacks? I think they probably happened because he’s trying to get more comfortable in the pocket, which he is. I don’t think he really hit his stride yesterday, which sounds obnoxious coming from a Ravens fan because of his stats😂"
He really is an amazing QB. Last year it was clear that the he was moving so much faster than the game. Yesterday it was clear that the game has slowed down to him.
"After watching the game and then rewatching the highlights, I feel like the most impressive play to me was the touchdown to Willie Snead. Lamar is just looking ball off to the left and then drops it right in between two guys just to wear Snead can get it. Beautiful."
"I've been telling people for a while that all you needed to see his desire to improve was his college tape. Coming into his last year at Louisville, he had every reason to sit back and not change a thing. He had just won the Heisman trophy after all, nobody in college football had a better excuse to rest on their laurels. In spite of that, there was substantial improvement in him as a passer that season. Better footwork, a quicker release, more focus on keeping his eyes downfield when plays broke down, even though he could've easily changed nothing and still been drafted high, he had clearly put an offseason of work focused on his weaknesses, and while he was still imperfect - if he wasn't, he wouldn't have fallen to 32 and we wouldn't have had to run a triple-option offense in 2018 - it was clear he did not care about his accolades, only his improvement.

Dude has always been driven by the desire to be the best, never satisfied with where he is, even when ""where he is"" is the Heisman, or as we're seeing, the MVP. I said leading up to the draft that he needed to go to the right team where he could learn and focus on fixing what remained of those issues, but that if that was what he did with the resources of an ACC also-ran like Louisville, he'd work his ass off with a full-time coaching staff at a billion-dollar NFL team. I'm very glad we ended up being that right team."
Not bad for a rb
I thought he had an almost perfect game yesterday. He got even better throwing the ball than last year. The only thing I didn't like was when he threw the ball rolling left and should have been picked. Only bad decision I saw all game
"""It's just the Browns"""
"He only ran 7 times and the Browns kept him bottled up on every run but two. And I didn't even notice. His poise was off the charts. His pocket presence was off the charts. His touch was off the charts.

He was so clearly the best player on the field. My only reaction to his TD to Snead was to just laugh. Any remaining doubters are either haters or racists.

By the way, I honestly thought the O-line played pretty ass yesterday and it didn't even matter."
"The majority of his balls were all perfect spirals too. He definitely worked on his hand placement. He had that one really back duck towards the end of the game, but he was under pressure so it's whatever. Really liked what I saw"
Now you can support his next of season the right way
"Guys, I think I found the Impostor."
"its gonna be even more ridiculous this year because of dobbins' speed...how do you cover dobbins, lamar and hollywood?...all his physical tools aside, its lamar's football acumen that is super impressive. he is a craftsman."

"I woke up, read a single shitty comment from a browns fan and went straight into hateful mode. There really isnt a response he can give that hits deeper than the shit I through on him."
Baker Mayfield and Patrick Maholmes are in like every other commerical after their performances in 2018 - where's the love for Lamar?  I literally haven't seen him in a single one.
He's had some. But it doesn't seem like something he places a high value on.
"Got to remember he negotiated his own deal, and didn’t hire an agent.  To my knowledge, he still doesn’t.  A friend who does marketing for NFL players told me those negotiations go through his mom.  

He really does seem to only want to be sponsored by the brands he enjoys.  Oakley he said he’s worn since he was a child. He has his own brand (Era 8), so he doesn’t seem to be in a rush to sign with one of the big clothing/shoe brands.  But his value is only going up, and if he keeps this level of play up, that could be a 10 figure deal when it happens."
"He’s in this [Madden commercial ](https://youtu.be/5YUxJlR4n5Q), but that seems to be it."
"Well, the way baker performs I’m glad Lamar isn’t in any. I’d rather he focus on improving, like he seems to do"
"As someone else echoed, I think he's way too focused on winning right now. Also his mother is kinda his manager/agent, so she might be telling him not to do so and instead build his own brand. Also, he may just have no interest in doing them tbh."
"I just don't think he cares tbh. There's the Madden ad, the Oakley endorsement and the Heisman House ad but that's about it."
Hes in the Heisman House commercial
I believe this offseason he was realizing that nobody cares and was working harder
"It’s simple, he just doesn’t do commercials. Seems that he’s more focused on winning and improving his game than doing other stuff. Just another reason to be a fan of his, dude is literally working constantly to get better"
"He, CMC and Patty are in a BOSE commercial (though its pretty much all Patty)"
"I think he did a Bose commercial with Mahomes and CMC that aired before the Thursday night game, but I can’t find it anywhere. Maybe it was just for the season kickoff."
Happy for you guys and keep it up!
Ravens will represent the AFC in the Super Bowl.
Props to you guys and Mr. Discount Double check too. He was looking like vintage Rodgers yesterday.
Big Truzz!! Congrats on beating the other purple team!
"Adams was nice yesterday too, great game."

"So many good things about this clip:

-Calais dropping into coverage and turning into a 300 pound Ed Reed ballhawk

-Marlon continuing his reign as the king of turnovers (ints, catching tipped balls, forcing and scooping fumbles, etc)

-The defense ALWAYS taking a squad photo after every huge turnover lmfao"
"Calais going from being upset he dropped it, realizing the ball is still live when he turns around, throwing his hands up in celebration when he realizes Marlon has it and then going ""oh we gotta go over there and take a pic now? Ok."" and starting to jog was hilarious."
I’m very confident he made this play because of watching film. He seemed to immediately know where baker was going to go with the ball.  Veteran move.
"Man if calais caught that, that would have been sick."
"Also notice how he clapped in frustration mid fall, basically horizontal in the air. Now that's athleticism"
"It's been said on here many times, and elsewhere by people who get paid to write about the NFL, but the Campbell signing may be the biggest impact FA signing in 2020, and he is already proving what sort of impact he can make. 

In EDC we trust."
It was the first drive! Then a fumble on the next one. I almost felt bad for Stefanski for the way the game opened.
"No crowd screams to know what just happened. Though I will say, the change in the fake crowd noise was nice. I honestly forgot at times that there were no fans."
That is no man. He is definitely a bear in disguise
"#80 on the browns was uncovered (bottom of screen). Had the play gone to him, different outcome."
LOOK AT THE DEATILS!!! *Ingram hyped voice*

It just kinda rolls off the tongue and it's definitely that disrespect to a team when your backup has to play on after a blowout.
Someone in a different thread called him Bobby Three Sticks and I definitely like that!
"I'm still trying to make ""Rob"" happen so I'm gonna vote we say they got Rob'ed."
Bobby Three Sticking and when bob goes off it’s a “deep three sticking”
I like it.
The Human Victory Cigar!
I like it! Do it similar to the way the Orioles sub put a bird on a map for teams they sweep/win the series (can’t remember which)
And... when we put him in in the 3rd quarter - we get to say “put in RG4” at the top of the fourth!
Book it!
My father used to cal him RG Green.
On to something here
Ship it
Ravens are 1-0 when RG3 plays
How about RGmemed?
"So basically my dad has had a shitty year. Besides the obvious 2020 being a dumpster fire, we’ve also lost mom and my younger brother. All in a span of five months. 

As a family we’ve all always been huge ravens fans and I’ve taken over watching the game with my dad. (So glad they won yesterday!!) He is a massive fan. 

Is there anything I can do for him as a surprise? There’s already a cut out in the stands but it’s going to be hard to spot it. I’m having trouble of thinking of something that could really cheer him up. 

Thanks for your time!"
"Are any of the Ravens on Cameo? You could pay for a personalized message from one of the players he likes if one is on there. 

Sorry to hear about the struggles.  Hope the end of 2020 and 2021 is better for you and yours."
"Very sorry to hear that.

Could be something as simple as making a slideshow with some ray lewis quotes in the background? Just thinking how some pics of the family and everything mixed with ray talking about strength and perseverence would be pretty moving and uplifting"
"Very sorry for your loss, 
This is a tricky question normally I’d say you could contact the organization about having him go out on the field or even come in for a practice and meet a couple players but they won’t be doing that for a while. They might do something like send him a letter but that’s the extent of it during COVID-19. but outside of that anything little you put your time in he will definitely appreciate and enjoy"

It was incredibly impressive that the Ravens held Rich Gannon to those numbers when you look at what he had done prior to that game.
16-3 for that team was essentially 38-6 in today’s age
"The Raiders entered that game with the number 1 rushing offense in the league. 

They averaged 154.4 YPG rushing during the season. 

The Ravens held them to 24 yards on 17 attempts.

The 2000 Ravens will always be the greatest run defense in NFL history especially when you look at the running backs that they shut down that season."
Not bad for a qb
"In the year 2000 you didn't need offense because your defense was more likely to gain field position. 

I remember a quote from Ray at the time he mentioned that if were up 2 scores the game was essentially over."
"Wasn't this more or less the TB - NO box yesterday? 

Of course, that kind of proves your point given the QBs."
"Not gonna lie - as good as the Ravens are and as much as I love Lamar, I kinda miss going into a game with Ray and Ed hoping our defense could carry us to a 16-13 win"
Honestly. Those are kinda of like Joe Flacco numbers pre and post 2012.
That team didn't evolve into this team.  There are completely different teams.  They share a logo and thats about it.
""
I wish I was as passionate about anything as Peters is about humiliating the Browns.
The best thing about no fans was hearing how mental this guy is on the field. He'll celebrate every incompletion for a full 40 seconds lol
I'd love to know how many shit-related comments MP made to OBJ yesterday. If there was anyone on the field who would bring it up it would be him
He's such an asshole and he's earned every bit of it. I fucking love him.
"Big fan of Deshon coming in and celebrating with MP, you can tell everyone loves each other in the secondary"
I was howling when he just stood there screaming after that play lmao
I said it during the game.. cant wait to hear MP go nuts. Big ass never ever forgetting the rams game last year.
I wish more than anything I could hear every single comment Marcus makes
It seems like everyone who’s ever **played** with him **loves** the dude though. Just a super competitor who DGAF in general. Gimme dat all day
"Everyone in the league hates him, but I can guarantee the team LOVES his play and attitude. A perfect fucking fit"
This play was crazy. Notice how Peters began to undercut the route *before OBJ even made his cut*. Peters is known for gambling and making play like this. I just worry for the day when an offense sets him up with a familiar look and then BAM double move and Peters is nowhere to be found

It was hilarious seeing every pass breakup celebrated like it was a pick six
"Really miss the Sizz-man

He was basically the soul of the team for a decade"
We need to find a way to hide a bud light for this man to chug
Didn’t he call OBJ and Jarvis “Girlfriends”?
"Idk if this is controversial, but Peters is our best corner. Isn't as grabby as Humphrey and has better ball skills. Humphrey is younger tho so hopefully he keeps improving."
Ball So Hard U lives forever in Balmer. MP Juiceman is the new Chancellor.
When we got peters I was at practice for football and I told my mates and we all went crazy good times
What a fucking sloppy route by OBJ. Peters ran the cut better than he did and he isn’t even a fucking WR. Shit like this is why I hate being a browns fans. Especially when you have a stupid ass fantasy writer talking about how OBJ should have had a 100yard Easy. No he shouldn’t have. Dude was lazy as fuck and is way too mentally soft.
I love his celebrations lmao
OBJ in good position.  Baker's accuracy just sucks.
our rookie linebackers looked solid yesterday. Queen look what we expected but for me Harrison was EVERYWHERE. Almost tipped a ball to a Clark pick. Might be homer but I think there’s a possibility we don’t lose a game this year
"I thought that Chris Board has some work to do.  He played nine snaps and came to my attention in a negative way twice, once with a big missed tackle and also with an overpursuit when he had backside responsibility that resulted in a huge Cleveland running play.  Definitely the weak link in the position group so far.  

I would have liked to see a little more from Judon as well, but I'm fairly pleased with the linebackers, especially Queen."
I don't want to overreact but this looks like a dynasty.
I'll admit I was worried about Queen's tackling but he proved me wrong. I also loved that he wore a Ray Lewis t-shirt to his press conference and said it was about respect. Unbelievably classy move and I immediately felt like this dude is an all time Raven.
"Harrison had a few bad angles on some plays trying to stop the run, but I'm sure thats nothing he cant clean up after watching the game tape.  Queen seems as advertised for the most part"
"I think the only teams we could possibly lose to is the chiefs, Steelers, titans, and MAYBE the patriots"
"In 2003, Boller started 9 games and played in 11 total games. In those games, he completed 51.8% of his passes, had 7 touchdowns to 9 interceptions, and had a rating of 62.4.

In 2004, he started all 16 games. He had a 55.6% completion percentage, 13 touchdowns to 11 interceptions, and a rating of 70.9.

In 2005, he started 9 games. He completed 58.4% of his passes, had 11 touchdowns to 12 interceptions, and a rating of 71.8.

Ravens fans should forever appreciate what Lamar does on a weekly basis especially newer fans who never had to suffer through some of the worst quarterbacks performances you will ever see."
"To me, Kyle Boller was the worst pick in Ravens history since he wasted the prime of Jamal Lewis and some great defensive teams. 

If Boller could have been a competent QB, it would have taken so much pressure off the defense and Jamal to consistently carry the team game after game."
"He was but one is a looong shit stain that was the Ravens offense for almost two decades. A lot of amazing defensive squads were wasted over that time. Joe Flacco felt like a reprieve for a while, and now I barely understand what I'm watching when the Ravens offense hits the field. It still doesn't feel real to me. I still expect three and out."
"The two worst things about Boller were that he would consistently trip on/get stepped on by the offensive guards, and that he would often have a big game late in a season that would give you hope that he was coming around.  When he annihilated Favre's Packers, I thought that he'd finally done it, but then he was back to his regular self next season."
"Wow! Honestly, those stats reminded me why Flacco seemed like such a godsend for so many years."
"Lamar already has five of the top ten single-game passer rating records in franchise history. In 23 starts, he's thrown 3+ TDs nine times, while in 163 starts Flacco did it 17 times. He's something completely different and we should cherish it."
And the guy somehow stuck around through 06 and 07 with McNair starting and was slated to be the starter in 08 after we drafted Joe. lol. That bit amazes me.
I remember hoping we would punt so we could have Ed reed get a pick 6... seemed more likely then the offense scoring.
"I honestly think the primary problem was Billick. He wasn't the offensive genius he was touted to be, unless of course you gave him a rejuvenated Randall Cunningham, and two hall of fame receivers.

Not to let Boller off the hook, but the offense didn't exactly light the world on fire when Billick was given veterans like Elvis Grbac and Steve McNair, either.

The real problem with Boller was the fact that the Ravens actually traded up to get in. The pick they ended up sending to the Patriots was used to select Vince Wilfork. Never trade up to get a QB. It rarely works out. 

Edit: I know technically the Ravens traded up to get Lamar, but I think trading up to 32 is different than giving up a 1st rounder to trade up to 19."
How about we don't.
""
I'm concerned about our run defense. This makes me very slightly less concerned.
David Johnson looked good too
David Johnson played better anyways.
Booo I want them at full strength.
"Ehh the Texans don’t concern me whatsoever. Reid called a vanilla game and mahomes didn’t even break a sweat and the chiefs were in control all game long. Plus their rookie rb ran for like 140 and 2 tds or something the Texans d is just awful. Plus neither of the Texans rbs is nearly as good as chubb and hunt, and none of their weapons are as good as the browns and we held the browns to 6. Also BoB is a terrible coach. Get ready for another game of us cruising to an easy win along with some stifling defense."
"\#Texans RB Duke Johnson, who sprained his ankle on Thursday night, is considered week-to-week and is a long-shot to play this week against the \#Ravens, source said. However, playing in Week 3 is possible, an indication it’s not a serious injury.

He had one of the greatest college campaigns ever

Mahomes but for old time sakes a battle with Big Ben on Thanksgiving sounds amazing
Jackson vs Mahomes will be awesome
"Oh boy there isn't a thing in this world that makes me as giddy as beating the Browns. I was absolutely loving last night's game and I can't wait to do it again. Baker throwing picks, OBJ seeing his dad; the world is alright in my book"

Chiefs by far. Then probably the titans and Steelers.

So whether we win or lose that game, the narrative will stay the same throughout the entire year.

I voted for the chiefs because I honestly think that will be the matchup between the two best teams in football, and we can finally get over the Chiefs hurdle that has also plagued Lamar since he took over as the starter"
Chiefs scare me and I just know it's gonna be a nail biter. I'm not looking forward to the stress I'm gonna feel.
Vs. Pats will be interesting because historically Bill has struggled scheming against athletic QBs but lets see if that changes when his QB is Cam. He can actually simulate a gameplan to practice against all he wants now.

If the Ravens were gashing a team the way they were running on us early we would have ran the ball 50 times lol. I hope with more time together the d-line stiffens up and proves me wrong."

Matt Waldman has been in Lamar's corner since the draft. He called it.
"Totally agree with Matt here.

When he lights teams up through the air this season (again), a lot of people are going to talk about how he finally learned to beat teams through the air. It's bullshit confirmation bias. He was great yesterday, but he also threw five touchdowns last year week 1. He's *always* been a good passer. Yesterday wouldn't have looked out of place at any point in 2019."
"Matt Waldman is 100% right about this. 100%. 

Lamar's pocket poise, pocket movement, and pocket management were all outstanding in college. He used to climb the pocket like a vet as a 20yo junior in college. The pocket poise/movement/management that lamar showed against the browns shouldn't be viewed as ""improvement"". He had it at 20 years old. It was the #1 reason why i loved him as a prospect coming out of college. 

What has improved? From a technical standpoint, he has refined himself big time. His footwork, launch point, and stance are all dramatically better. His technique from a fundamentals standpoint is far better now than it was when he was in college. He is getting better from a route recognition standpoint. He rarely gets tricked by underneath coverage these days. His throwing on the move in that browns game was amazing as well. That has improved.

The point is his pocket pose/presence/movement were all great even when he was a rook. Waldman has an RSP film room up detailing lamar's ability to consistently climb the pocket and manage the pocket in an efficient manner. He made that video when lamar was a junior in college. That's what he is talking about."
"It’s revisionist history to suggest that this is not a sign of Lamar’s development. He’s clearly gotten better as a pocket passer during each of his NFL seasons.

Throwing against college secondaries =/= throwing against NFL secondaries."
"I don't keep up with college football too much, so it baffled me when I looked back and saw that Lamar had a 69-27 TD:INT ratio in college. The way people talked about him you'd think it was closer to 1:1. He's always been pretty good at protecting the football and I'd honestly value that over a couple extra passing yards that the other QB's had."
zeus did well against myles garret
"Didn’t everyone agree he could make reads/see the field as good as the rest of that draft class? I definitely think his motor skills/arm have developed closer in sync with his vision over the past two seasons, though ."
"Jackson said it took him a while to even get used to what a NFL Football felt like.

Ignoring how hard he worked to improve himself from where he was at in the 2018 preseason is dumb as shit."
"This is stupid. Players can improve and Lamar obviously has. Saying a guy has shown clear improvements isn't a slight at all, it's a complement to the hard work the player has put in to get better"
"Love Matt Waldman, but I respectfully disagree with him on this one."
"I never questioned how he worked the pocket, i questioned his ball placement and the consistency of it.


He has shown strides in his ball placement for sure."
"Ok let’s get this straight, Lamar has definitely developed vastly as a pocket passer since entering the league. He’s a completely different player than he was at Louisville. Lamar at Louisville was not amazing from the pocket, he was just better than people gave him credit for. He was still inaccurate and had bad mechanics and tendencies and made some bad decisions. The issue was people using this to write him off as a run first qb or a wide receiver. However, saying he’s always been this good is just insulting to Lamar, dude has put in serious work and countless hours and reps to get himself to this position of being a top 3 qb"

Thats a cool story. Go Mom. I wonder if she plays 🤔🤔🤔
">She also got a pair of cleats signed by her freeloading child, and a controller with a Ravens faceplate

Perfect"
"So let's watch the [Tyus Bowser sack on 4th and 4 in the 3rd quarter](https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/1305488216603193347). Tyus plays it beautifully, delaying his pass rush until the LT takes his eyes off him for a split second, looking to see if he can help with a double-team. You can see the exact second Tyus goes in for the kill and beats his man [here](https://imgur.com/d20oxyk).

But I want to show you what's happening on the other side of the field at the exact same time. 

Jimmy Smith, Marlon Humphrey, and Marcus Peters all line up against this bunch formation from CLE. You can see [here](https://imgur.com/523WTTy), in the split second before the ball is snapped, the three are discussing assignments and routes possible from this formation. Keep in mind, we have *no tape on this team* right now. Sure we have last year's stuff, but nothing under this new coach, new offense, with new players. 

Their talks are interrupted and, wordlessly, each one peels off on a different receiver [right as Baker is looking in Landry's and Hooper's direction](https://imgur.com/gyRWobp). The three essentially worked out [this mess](https://imgur.com/koreMQx) in the split second it took to snap the ball and get moving. 

One of the major criticisms of Baker is that he doesn't keep his head cool when he loses his first option. In this case, Jimmy took Hooper out of the equation and Peters took out Landry. Baker panics right as Bowser makes his move on the LT and forces Baker to roll out. If Baker doesn't panic here, he likely [sees Njoku wide open across the middle for this first down](https://imgur.com/D0RYtWC) before Marlon can get in place to defend him while Tony keeps stride with OBJ across the traffic. 

These 5 players together sacked Baker and it is an absolute thing of beauty."
[The Browns OL when they see Tyus rush right past them](https://streamable.com/yps1vp)
"What this shows, which is an even greater testament to our coaching staff, is that this is a route concept straight from the Matt Rhule/Joe Burrow LSU Offense. We already have the tools and know how to beat what may end up being the trendiest playbook adjustment of the season, against a player that should be able to pull this off in a short-yardage situation."

Sick dude
Odell heard footsteps one play for a 1st down. He’s soft.
These jokes are so dead already. It was funny for a day or two.
"After putting Baker and the browns where they belong squarely at the bottom of the AFC north, do you think the boys will have a similar demonstration against Watson as to last year's meeting or are we looking at a potentially closer game? Lots of positives from week 1 but I'm going based off of the discussions today from every sports broadcast blaming Baker and OBJ for the win."
"By Winston I’m assuming you mean Watson, and yea I think we’re probably gonna blow them out again. No Hopkins means we’re probably gonna shut down their pass game. I’m not really concerned about that cuz I’m pretty sure our offense will score every drive. The chiefs offense didn’t even look like they were trying and moved the ball easily. I’m predicting 45-17 or something where they score a few garbage time tds late and we pile up on them early"
"Watson is infinitely better than Mayfield, but he’s not surrounded by as much talent as Baker. The key for the game is to stop the run game."
Probably. The Texans were horrible on both sides of the ball on Thursday. They only padded their numbers because the Chiefs took their foot off the gas.
"Its gonna be ugly, 50 burger incoming"
I'm sad cause I have to play Will Fuller in fantasy 😭 hopefully our sweet princes take it easy on him and let him score one time.
"Man this sub got cocky. It won’t be a blowout. And we need to tighten the run D cause DJ looks rejuvenated. 

We should win however!"
"Maybe not that similar with a blowout like last year but probably a comfortable win. Ravens had a decent bit of mistakes yesterday they still need to iron out. Browns game would’ve been closer if Browns wouldn’t have Browns’d it up so many times. (See: Baker staring down man before INT, fake punt fumble, 4th & 41, 3rd down drop followed by missed easy FG)"
""
"I have gotten pissed at Harbaugh in the past for leaving Lamar I’m too long. That being said, this early in the year, you need to get Lamar as many reps as possible before week 3."
There is a reason why he is a long term coach of an NFL team and I fix cars.
He really doesn’t even need to defend this. Even though this was week 1 EVERYONE needs reps. This is essentially getting him back to game speed
Lamar didn’t get a preseason so I don’t mind keeping him in an extra drive or two past when we probably should have taken him out.
This is hilarious. Like half of Brady's career stats haven't come in garbage time in games where the Pats had already obviously won.
"Coach, you don't have to defend a damn thing to these ppl.  Get as many reps you can get in... I dont hear anyone talking about Mahomes playing the entire game, and they were up 31-7..."
"I can't believe this is even a controversial topic. 

""You guys are up way too much! Pull Lamar earlier! It's not fair for the Browns!"""
"I agree to an extent. He can stay in, but should be handing the ball off or throwing quick slants. Minimize any chance he gets hit in garbage time. 

He took a trash time sack yesterday and I winced."
"We play like last year, he’s gonna have TONS of 4th quarters off! 😂

Don’t mind him staying in, gotta knock that rust off for week 3! we should be 2-1 against KC (play calling lost us that game lowkey.)"
Sean Payton would be so proud. Coaches who don’t give a fuck and will do anything to put their foot on their opponents necks
I dont mind if Jackson stays in. Hes an adult. If he doesnt want to be in there by all means.. he can say so. If hes still in I have 100% confidence that's where he wants to be. Hes not scared of injury and yall shouldn't be either. More qbs get hurt inside the pocket than out of it. Shit happens. Let em play

Depends on the team and coach really
"Lamar would still be good, but no other organization would have completely went all in like we did. The ravens and Lamar were/are an absolute perfect fit"
I don’t think other franchises would give as much as the Ravens have to build a team around Lamar.
"Yes the dude is a fucking talent and a half.

I get we have good coaches but he does nothing but smash expectations and put the work in himself. I'm not sure the Browns would use him right but I promise you they'd of finished every year with a better record if they had drafted him.

""Just as good"" is subjective to a lot of variable changes had he landed somewhere else.

I do think we're not the only team he *could* win a championship/MVP on. But I desperately **want** us to be."
"Lamar would still be tremendous but the caveat in your poll's 2nd option is that he would be ""just as good"" I feel is false. 

I don't think any other team would've had the guts to structure the offense around him and his strengths. Teams going forward, though, will definitely learn from what the Ravens have done and will probably be more inclined to do something similar."
"With certain teams he’d be nearly just as good. With the jets, dolphins, bungles, etc? Still good but wouldn’t have developed near as much as he has in 1.5 years at bmore."
Depends he would thrive in a very select option of teams
"If he goes to the browns he's trash, that much I know"
You know some idiot team wouldve tried to make jim a wr
"Still good but not at this level, but we built our offense around him instead of trying to make him fit into an existing structure."
"Some teams he would be great, others merely good. Impossible to predict though, I don’t think Lamar was ever going to be a bad qb, he is a good thrower, and always has been. Every rookie qb struggles passing, manning sucked ass as a rookie and I am tired of that being the excuse for all the shitty evaluations of him coming out of college"
I think he would've looked good with Jacksonville when they were SACKSONVILLE. Another team would be the Titans. Him and Henry would be insane..
"I think he would be just as great on a handful of teams. I think he would be very good on most teams. I think, despite his one of a kind talent, some teams would destroy him and his potential (most notably Cleveland)"
"My vote is to cheer for the Bengals, because fuck Baker that’s why."
"Definitely Bengals. I like Burrow and he will probably be real good unfortunately.

If the browns lose to the Bengals after the ass whooping we just handed them I'm expecting a very entertaining collective meltdown from their team and their fanbase."
We’re not Steelers fans in their own stadium. We don’t cheer for divisional rivals.
Tie lmao
"I don't cheer for either and just let the chips fall where they may. 

I fully expect the Ravens to have such a divisional lead at the end that the outcome of this game will be inconsequential."
"The only thing I’m rooting for is both teams imploding. 5 missed field goals or extra points, 10 interceptions during that game. All that sort of stuff that I can watch and laugh at"
I kinda found myself rooting for Joe burrow on that almost game winning drive. I think I'd rather root for him than baker
Bengals. It really hurts to say I don’t hate the Bengals like the rest of the division right now but the hate just isn’t there. And there is nothing that would be better then the Browns having another losing season
Both teams forfeit.
Bungles cause i like Burrow (for now) and it will be funny to see the browns be 0-2
Nobody. We are Ravens fans
The bengals. If Cleveland implodes we are for sure winning the division
I say bungles. Just hoping there isn’t another Hail Mary win against us again this year.
"Tie...Or better yet, Burrow outplaying Faker.."
Bengals. I hate the Browns.
Chaos
bengals so i can peruse the browns sub after and listen to both the baker defenders arguing about how odell sucks and the people with a brain arguing that baker is no longer a viable QB
Bengals and Big Joe B
"Bengals, I don't hate them that much anymore cuz we've owned them recently. But when they were our dads I hated them so much. Also 4th and 12. Fuck Dean Pees."
"Bengals because fuck the Browns just a bit more. Plus I like Burrow a bit. Mostly because if the Browns do lose, especially if they play badly, doubly so if they get their ass kicked again, we'll see the mother of all meltdowns from their team and especially fans. If the fans are already turning on Baker and OBJ for losing to Baltimore, if they lose embarassingly to the Bungles, well oh boy"
"I'm not cheering for anything, but super fuck the Browns.


Nah but I feel like the Browns have more of a chance to turn it around and become somewhat of a threat, so I'd rather they fall back in the division even more"
"Root is a strong word. I expect the browns to win. The Bengals played some seriously garbage football in that game, which I watched most of. While the browns lost, I felt like they made more plays than the Bengals did, and the browns had clear upsides like a lethal front seven and a strong running game. The Bengals looked like trash at every level."
"I'm a big Oklahoma fan so it sucks seeing Baker struggle as much as he has. Obviously, I'm happy that we have been getting the best of him in our matchups which is nice."
I don't care who wins. I just want Burrow to play better than Baker lol.
Bengals if I have to choose. I hate them a little less than I do the Browns
Browns so our win looks that much better

Who cares according to browns fans Baker will be gone in 3more weeks along with obj

"Hes gonna have two big games a year to make his season stats look decent. Then people will say something that he has 8 sacks and blah blah blah.

I hope the guy is gone next year. He cant produce his own rush unless a dumb team makes a TE block him. If only we kept Z Smith. We are paying this man 16 mill to be a, ""well imagine if we didnt have him"" kind of guy. Our pass rush has been shit with him will be shit without him. At least we can get someone who can set a damn edge.


Rant over sorry lol"
Yeah don't you remember the uncatchable ball on 3rd &12 roughing the passer penalty that put them in scoring range?
Comments on this post are toxic af 😂
"Dude wants top LB money without playing like a top LB... It's the perfect plan on his part if it works out for him, honestly."
I'll be disappointed if we pay him big. With all the upcoming contracts we can't pay a dude like that.
"He had his weekly RTP called on him, at least some things never change."
"Only notable thing he did yesterday was a retarded RTP in the first half after Baker had clearly gotten rid of the ball. Other than that he was a ghost all game long.
The fact that he has Campell, Wolfe, and Bwills on the inside yet stil can't generate pressure is absurd. He can't produce an ounce of pressure unless he's against a bad/rookie TE or a reserve lineman. He can't contain the edge to save his life, despite it being it being a major part of his job. If this FO is smart, which they are and I have faith in them, he'll be gone this year and we'll draft a DEor two in the early rounds this draft. Under no circumstances should we pay him a new big contract. 
But he'll probably get his two games where he goes off and pads his stats like normal and someone else will pay him big money. If only we had kept Z Smith.
For reference, Judon yesterday was outplayed by both of our rookie linebackers, which Judon is technically a linebacker as well. Harrison had the same amount of tackles, 4, and a pass deflection. Queen doubled his tackles, with 8, got a sack, and forced a fumble. Judon only got 4 tackles despite being in his 5th year."
Oof 😢
He only shows up against shit competition maybe 4 times a year to pad his stats.
"I thought the same thing. He did more harm than good. When he does not get a new contract from us and signs for big money somewhere else, I will remember days like yesterday."

Those bad Flacco and Kyle Boller years are still fresh in my memory. No chance I’m ever going to take this for granted.
There’s at least one play a game where Lamar does something crazy and jaw dropping. I look for that in other QBs and it just doesn’t happen outside of like 5 other players.
I guess you weren’t here when Flacco was our signal caller I loved him with his occasional magical plays
Lol they just said the Steelers offense was looking good and I laughed out loud.
There are a couple of teams I can watch. It was kinda awesome watching D Hop catch so many balls yesterday. but I definitely have twice as much fun watching our guys
I still grit my teeth and curl my toes on every drop back. You can thank about 90% of ravens QBs for that one. I’m getting PTSD flashbacks to Kyle Boller chucking the rock directly in to triple coverage. But thank goodness for Lamar.

Anyone know any updates of Ronnie Stanley?
Decosta bought him chicken tendies and Stanley's ankle was instantly healed
Harbs said he will be practicing Wednesday.
Not serious never even took his cleat off for the injury there was just no need to keep him in
"From what we saw in the game,  he stayed on the field after the injury and wasn't taken into the locker room.  If it was serious or if he was in that much pain there's a 0% chance he stays on the field.  We also were already up big so there wasn't a reason for him to go back into the game,  so him not returning to the game wasn't weird (I actually think it was great we got Fluker some game time). So although Harbaugh almost always downplays injuries,  I think the optics on this look pretty good."

They've had tons of players over the years I've loved, their fanbase is always cool, they hate the Browns and Steelers as much as we do, and if we're being honest, Ravens-Bengals is by far the tamest divisional rivalry in the league. It seems forced whenever people try to drum up hatred for them on the same level as the Steelers, Browns, and Patriots.

So yeah, Bengals cool in my book 14/16 games a year"

Uhhh what?
They won their game tonight though...
My favorite thing to see after a good game is who got the game ball. Who got it this time?
"Coach mentioned them in the post game. Calais got one and maybe JK? Let me go find out

Edit:

- Dick Cass
- Calais Campbell
- Lamar Jackson"
"I loved watching football. I could watch any football game no matter what teams and almost always enjoy it. Even two bottom tier teams playing a random Thursday night game was exciting. Then the Ravens drafted Lamar Jackson. Lamar, Harbs, and Roman have made our games so exciting to watch that I can’t get excited for other games. Outside of a few teams, normal football is barely watchable. I mean, why are other QBs so slow? Why are other teams not as cool or fun as the Ravens? Lamar has officially ruined football for me. Thanks Lamar."
haha lamar go fast vroom
Having a true ALL TIME GREAT(tm) on your team will do that a bit.  There is a letdown when ordinary folks play.
"Louisville fan here, I haven’t enjoyed a non-LJ8 game in years. There’s a support group that helps. We meet on Tuesday nights at 7:00."
"It was pretty fun watching the Chiefs on Thursday but that game was a bit one sided. I tried to get hype for Brady Brees, but honestly it was underwhelming old man football. Tonight I was having fun rooting against the Steelers and Titans but alas they both won. Booo I need more Ravens."
I love watching teams I hate get beat and going on their sub reddit game threads and just seeing them cry 🤣 especially when they play us and lose and they get to see how scary Lamar actually is. Smh people be thinking Lamar is some kind of myth until they see for themselves
"“I mean, why are other qb’s so slow” made me lol. Good post"
"Unless it's Mahomes, Rodgers or Wilson I don't even bother watching other games.

Although I did watch the Rams for a bit just to see what $5 billion looked like. And I'll watch the Raiders first home game to see that stadium too."
"Tennessee v Denver last night I kept thinking to myself, “why don’t they just score the touchdowns?” and “why don’t they just do the offense thing?” and realized I’ve been spoiled after 2 decades of putrid offenses."
I highly doubt Ravens - Chiefs or Ravens - Titans will be boring. Lamar and the Ravens need their A game for both of these games.
Watching the Titans v Broncos last night and the missed field goals made me value Tucker even more than usual. Same goes for Lamar. Watching crap QBs makes me super thankful for Lamar.
I said this last year. I find other games like watching paint dry. The Steelers game last night was awful to watch.
Defensive battles are cool.
"This probably isn't a popular opinion, but I think the games are a little boring now. After years of watching every Ravens' game come down to the last play for what seemed like every week, it's weird to easily beat teams. I barely watched after the 1st half the game vs the Browns. It was already over. Lamar is amazing and exciting in his own way. But the anxiety of the game is gone. The excitement is a little lesser because I'm not on the edge of my seat as the team teeters between a win and loss. Nevertheless, go Ravens."
"Its like when Curry started the 3pt trend now everyone wants a ""running qb"""
"Funny enough, it used to be the opposite. The “down” flacco years I could barely remember I was watching a football game, it looked like we were playing a different sport. Now we’re playing a different sport but in the cool fun way"
"Someone said after watching the Texans Chiefs game, that Deshaun seemed so slow compared to Lamar. 

I thought it was an exaggeration until Sunday when I saw Lamar go *Mach 5 in the backfield*"
"Give it time, all the QBs are scoring rushing TDs now"
"He has ruined football today just like Michael Jordan ruined the NBA in the early 90s. Once you watch these two, good luck feeling entertained by anybody else."
""
Annnnd there's my new fantasy name
"Random thought, almost a year later. AFAIK the NFL prohibits changing your jersey number midseason. Anyone here able to help me understand why it was allowed in this case?"
"I think they allow it when a transaction happens, like a trade or free agency pickup. They just don't want everyone changing their number every week when nothing in the roster is changing"
Marcus peters would have intercepted the number anyway so you might as well just give it to him
""
Still fukin got it
It is hard to watch Gostowski tonight
So happy he got a ring as a rookie. Plus had clutch kicks. 4/4 on FGs and 16/16 on extra points. Also the funny (since we won) fake field goal attempt in the Super Bowl.
Probably my 2nd favourite Raven behind Lamar and even then the gap isn’t as big as you’d expect
Let’s not forget the contributions of the wolfpack as a trio! Best in the league by a mile.
I solemnly swear I will never take him for granted. dude is automatic and an integral part to this team. we’re almost guaranteed points if we make it to the 40(ish) yard line.
In Jus We Truss
"I was kind of hoping he would get to try a long shot in the Browns game with that big lead and a quiet stadium late in the game, I bet he coud have made 65-70 yards. Just to rub it in. He's done it in practice."
Remember when he kicked it directly over the upright to beat  the Patriots in 2012
We really gotta do whatever we can to make sure this dude is a lifer here
"Oh man, after watching this game tonight... so grateful."
I’m just curious how many years he has left until the hell hounds come... that demon deal had to be expensive
"As I watching the game, I was literally thinking about how lucky we are to never have to worry about the kicking game. Seeing Seibert blow it really reminded me how great we have it."
Tucker deserves a spot right beside Ray Lewis when his career is all said and done
[And now the Browns have cut Seibert after that dismal performance.](https://www.si.com/nfl/browns/news/browns-bring-on-cody-parkey)
Justin “Justin Tucker” Tucker
Thank you God for giving us Lamar Jackson nd Justin Tucker.
"Watching Gostkowski yesterday I was telling myself how much of a luxury it has been to have this guy kicking field goals for the Ravens for this long. If Cundiff never missed that kick in the AFC Championship, who knows maybe Tucker never falls to us"
Justin “still fucking got it” Tucker
I got my first jersey this year and it's of tucker. He is God sent
My friends always tease me because I draft him early in fantasy. He consistently puts up points and is one of the greatest Ravens.
STILL FUCKIN GOT IT
A friend made a Billy Cundiff joke to replace Gostkowski yesterday. Do you think we sign Tucker if he makes that kick?
Theres no debating hes the best kicker ever. Vinatieri was amazing but Tucker was WAY more efficient and just as clutch
"I think Gostkowski knew about the Tucker conflict between myself and you all.  I mean, I find it hard to be a coincidence that he was so bad his first game with the same exact team that upset us in the playoffs last year combined with the fact that he's a kicker like Tucker."
"I just wanted to drop in with respect for this beast.  Was arguing with a scrub today and I used Tucker as an example of a player at the top of his position.  His response?  ""Tucker isn't even that dominant.""

Like what?  Who the fuck believes that?  That would be like saying Pat Mahomes isn't dominant as a QB.  It's common sense.  Some people are salty as fuck about talent that isn't on their team or that disproves their point.  Tucker a bad bad man."

The nfl advertises all its primetime games dude
I mean what are they supposed to say? “ This game sucks but you should watch it anyway”?
I mean... personally it’s a matchup I’m still excited to watch. Maybe these teams aren’t on our level (knock on wood) but it may still be a good game. I don’t have such burning hatred for other teams that I get pissy when the NFL advertises about their game.
"Annoying?

We got football man!

This year has been a fucking shit show. Lets enjoy the good things."
"NFL: ""watch two teams who suck at drafts go head to head in this battle to be the lesser of the two most over rated teams in the league."""
"They could go with “Someone is gonna get a W”. But with these 2 teams, I could see a tie happening."
"Joe “Winless” Burrow goes on the road to Baker “At Home” Mayfield.

Just seeing this only reminds me that they tanked on accident and that Cleveland has ruined any career success Mayfield could have."
""
"People keep bringing up the penalties in OBJs defense but they were for what, like 30 yards and 2 first downs?  What a game changer."
This isn’t surprising hump is odell’s father
He was even banged up out there!
A dad playing sports with his son.. You truly do love to see it.
"The Ravens intentionally fouled OBJ when needed to prevent him getting any rhythm in my opinion.

They knew they could get in a his head, and screw up the entire Browns offense."
"I know it was just the browns, but thought it was worth pointing out. Only the Packers Scored more points last week, with 43.  The Patriots were #2 scoring defense giving up 11 points."
"Even though I use the expression myself, ""Its just the...,"" to be honest, I don't like it. It's just the Browns until those scrubs fluke us out of a win and a 14-2 teams last loss was to just the Browns.

I hope our guys were proud of this statline despite the team, and try to build upon it going forward. Thanks for the stat"
"I mean everyone is riding the Greenbay Packers success right now, they put up some amazing numbers. But I am convinced that we, on average, can keep a solid defence and good scoring offense up all the way until November. And once the cold weather comes... well we know where this is going to end"
And it was just one game. Long way to go!
"Highest point differential, yet still behind the chiefs, who we scored more, and allowed less than. I don’t really care too much about the power rankings, especially not at the begging of the season, as it will probably make more sense as the season rolls along."
""
"Well, Ricard helped.  That’s not an easy assignment"
Boyle is definately one of the most underrated tight ends in the league
"Compared to whatever the hell Evan Engram was trying to do to TJ Watt last night, that's elite."
"When we resigned him to that 3 year deal, there was a lot of talking heads saying we overpaid (because people only look at the stat lines).  

I remember someone, maybe one of the coaches or an analyst who actually watches games said having him on the field is like having an extra Guard out there, and this was a great signing.  Then it came out that there was a strong market for him."
Isn't Boyle rated higher than a lot of offensive linemen on blocking? WELL worth his salary
"Definitely solid, but Garret initially looked inside where Boyle had help (likely just trying to get eyes in the backfield tbh) then Ricard popped over with a chip and release across the middle. Boyle didn't seem to bed the help, so big props to him against a huge adversary."
Wow. Boyle! That is insane. A TE blocking a top 3 NFL pass rusher like that.
"Boyle is absolutely manhandling Garret. Ricard comes in to chip him but it was barely needed. Even if Garret got off Boyle, Lamar gets the ball out we'll before Garret even touches him."
"I'm a lifelong Jets fan, fully indoctrinated by my father, also a lifelong Jets fan. However I also call myself a pragmatist, and have a hard time supporting ANY organization - sport, political, or enterprise - that has no skill in operation.

Most recently the Jets hired Adam Gase as head coach - a man who has done little more in his career than carry water for a veteran Peyton Manning. He'd continued to prove he brings no innovation or value to this offense.

Even before that, our owner looks to a NFL Network talking head to help him hire a GM, because he himself is damn clueless. That gave us Idzik, another example of Jets mediocrity.

I've watched over the years as the Jets have tried to be competent. The closest they came was while mimicking the Baltimore Ravens - hiring Rex, bringing in Bart, and building up the defense to an actual contender.

Now I watch the Jets and I'm just pissed at the ineptitude. Add to that the owner is now in the Trump Admin sexually harassing people (sorry for the hint of politics) and I really want little to do with the Jets anymore.

Beyond that, I just admire how the Ravens are run. They know how to draft, scout, and build a team around its strengths. The Lamar Jackson draft again proves the genius of Ozzie. I cannot believe Mayfield went #1 and Jackson fell so far. I find myself cheering every time Lamar beats the shit out of the Browns, and hope the Ravens continue to destroy them for the foreseeable future. I hope Cleveland regrets that draft for years to come.

A lot is going on in the world right now, and I find myself much more impatient to useless worry and stress. I'm also a Mets/Knicks fan (thanks again, Dad) so something has to give. The Jets are becoming a useless worry to me - especially after the Jamal drama. Good riddance to him - I'm glad he's not our issue anymore, but man do I wish I could follow a team that is all business. If Gase isn't gone soon, the Ravens might be that team.

I've never considered joining a bandwagon until now. I wonder, am I a Ravens fan?? Does B-More welcome wayward fans from crappy teams like NYJ? Either way, I hope Lamar gets his (first) ring this year - Sam Darnold sure as hell isn't."
About time the Ravens of the North fans start defecting to the mother land.
"Bro you're always welcome here! Just 3 ground rules:

1) Steelers Clowning is enforced\*\*\*\*\*

2) Jets are Ravens North but worse

3) All opinions are valid, except for the trash ones"
"If you wait long enough, half of our squad will end up there anyway. But who has time for that? Fuck the Steelers, welcome aboard"
You’re not a Ravens Fan yet unless you say the 3 magic words
"I don’t consider it a bandwagon if you’re going all in to be a true fan of the team during the good and bad times.

fans that came aboard last year but stuck around even after the Titans loss? not a bandwagon to me.

root for an organization you can be proud of with a team that excites you. hell, I’d probably be a Ravens fan even if I didn’t live in Baltimore.

in short, welcome aboard and fuck the Steelers."
Well the jets are just Ravens North at this point so you might as well just ease yourself over here
*Someday this could all be yours.*
It’s like when you switch from the store brand knockoff to the name brand. You’ll never go back.
Come to the black and purple side man. We have cookies and Lamar Jackson..
"If you’re still on the fence do some research on our owner Steve Biscotti. 

Dude made his fortune off employment companies. Turns out, hiring the best people and knowing how to keep a dedicated and respectful atmosphere is good business for ANY organization. 

It’s the reason we’ve been considered such a well run organization. It all starts with the owner as you’ve come to realize. It’s amazing how far that effect trickles down. I mean, the players are well respected enough to basically make their own roster changes ala ET3’s release. 

It’s been a point to draft and recruit people who are enjoyable to be around and having good character. It’s very easy to root for not just the players but the FO as well. I absolutely do not blame you for wanting to leave the jets fandom as they have done nothing to earn your continued loyalty. They simply pray off indoctrination as you mentioned."
Hey dont get down you guysbare basically the ravens without success cause you guys sign anyone we dont.
"As long as you say the magic words to open the doors to Flock Kingdom you're in. No not ""open sesame"" but ""Fuck the Steelers""!"

This is a joke right? Where’s Buck?
"I mean their analysis is fine, but to put them above us!? What the actual fuck?"
"Bruh the Steelers did not look that good against the Giants, the worst team over the last three years. They had moments but it wasn't a top five performance"
"Their defense is absolutely elite. They will ride that and a good coaching staff to a top 10 finish. Their offense will struggle, and so will Ben. All that said, they are not a better team than the Ravens. That’s just ridiculous!"
Their defense is so nasty that they let the giants drive down the field multiple times and they got lucky with that goal line interception.
Imagine hating Lamar so much you do stupid shit like this in articles that he will never even see.  Just one minuscule example of the kind of shit he has had to deal with.
"""Aaron Rodgers sure looked washed up. How dumb that thinking was came true against the Vikings...""

wut"
They slob ok the steelers knob so much it’s ridiculous. I can’t wait to fuck them up.
"This is just a reminder to not believe in any power rankings, even if it says we’re no.1"
"I saw a post in r/NFL that said over the past 3 years, the giants have had a worse record than the Browns, and that includes the 0-16 Browns. 

So if your team is struggling one of the worst team in the past 3 years... that’s pretty alarming for ya. 

It’s honestly because of Ben. The announcers were praising that man all game even though he played subpar. So much bias I can’t believe it"
who the hell ranked father time ahead of the ravens?
"Whatever opponent adjustments you want to give to the Ravens, you should give even more to the Steelers. The Giants have one of the worst offensive lines I've ever seen."
🤮
This must be Pete 'fucking' Pisscunt!
I haven’t cared about any power ranking since 2011. I care about us playing and winning in January and February
"They had an extremely pedestrian offense(30th in yards, 27th in points) last year, and were still 8-8 because their defense kept them in games. Shoot, they still had a chance to reach the playoffs at the end of season. If Ben stays healthy, and that's a big IF, you have to think they will have a much better offense. And when you couple a good offense with that defense, they can be dangerous. Don't sleep on them.

&#x200B;

With all that being said, no fucking way in hell they should be above the Ravens."
"This is like tier 2 clickbait, dont fall for it. Who cares?

Every site makes rankings and it means fuck all for every team but one in February 🤷‍♂️"
I guess we could be Division Champs for five years in a row and the Steelers are still a better team. These people are so dumb.
didnt we beat them with RG3 when they had a playoff berth riding on it?
This is the same company that employs JLC...so yeah not super credible
Anyone else notice Ben constantly grabbing his left knee in that game?
HAHAAHAHAHAAHA
Power Rankings are one half analysis and one half putting what ever popular team is minutely good near the top to generate clicks.
"The Aaron Rodgers line and the green bay ranking is all the more insane to me. He had one good game after years of not being quite what he used to be, and all the sudden they're the second-best team? This list is awful"
GOOD!!!!!
"Having the Saints above us is just as insulting. Their offense looks mediocre and Thomas is now out several weeks.

Edit: This is Pete Prisco, who I think is legitimately retarded, so maybe we should be nicer. He had the Packers at #2 going into the season. Maybe Aaron Rodgers is legitimately pissed off, puts that team on his back, and starts playing at an elite level again, but they were an overrated team last year and had a bad offseason."
The writing is almost as bad as the analysis.
Ravens were the only team to hold their opponent to single digits and have won 3 consecutive season openers by at least 30 PTs..... an absolute joke
"Apparently beating the Giants > beating a division rival? And the Ravens were arguably the 2nd best team in the NFL last year and look *even better*, but suddenly we're not even the best team in our division?

What a fucking joke. People are so eager for the Steelers to be good and the Ravens to regress it's embarrassing."
"Yeah, I’m a Steelers fan and there is no way I put them ahead of Baltimore.  I know they won on the road but you’re win was the most impressive of the week imo. Just doing it to stir shit up"
"Hot take clickbait, that’s all there is to see here."
"The only reason I can see for this, is Fat Boy is back in the line up. They seem to think Ben is a game changer."
4D Chess; someone's paying reporters to write up hot-take articles and power rankings for bulletin board material.
"I'm usually the first to say who gives a fuck about Power Rankings. When I saw this shit I came straight.to Reddit looking for this thread.

What the actual fuck. I hate the Steelers but respect the actual fuck out of them. If they were legitimately a great team I would have no problem with this. But in no way in hell are the Steelers a top 5 team based on beating.the Giants........"
Weird
Does anyone know if there’s going to be wired episodes this year?

That defense was looking tough, also the third Wildcard spot should open up some interesting upsets in this year's Playoffs."

I still think Gus deserves more reps. He’s been consistent for 3 years and gets a lot of chunk yards.
Well done!!
"Literally every time I see Dobbins I think he’s Rice. His play style, build and number was uncanny on Sunday. Was looking for Jamal until I realized this was the current group and not all time RBs."
"Baltimore-Core-4-Corps. | BR's RBs 2020:

* Mark Ingram II #21
* J.K. Dobbins #27
* Gus ""The Bus"" Edwards #35
* (...And) Justice (4) Hill #43"
"Some suggestions: Have all 4 in the same jersey color. Also, Dobbins' Ford patch from his practice jersey looks really out of place. I get that pics were limited and that was practically all available until this past weekend. 

Bearing these things in mind, I'd personally prefer them all in white jerseys, so each player pops off that beautiful backdrop — especially since the only regular season game action for Dobbins thus far has come via white tops. Plus, those shots of Gus & Justice are picture-perfect! 

You could still have them slightly differentiated in that two could be in white jerseys/black pants (Gus & Justice from the 2019 regular season Bills road game & 2019 preseason Packers home game, respectively), whereas Ingram & Dobbins could be wearing the purple pants.

Granted, I suppose the pants portions could be cropped out, too, of course. I found a few photos of those two in said uniform combinations that might work together, depending upon what would need done for sizing/proportion-fitting & image-positioning purposes:

Potentially, there will be opportunities to wait until after this Sunday for some game action snapshots of Dobbins sporting the purple top, since Houston will be wearing all white for their home opener, as per usual. 

On the other hand, I wonder if you could somehow Photoshop out the Ford patch, and otherwise just leave everything else the same? Obviously, this is your own creation, so whatever your preferences are matter the most above all else!

Additionally, I do love this as is (sans that practice patch). However, I just felt compelled to chime in with some suggestive options that MAY make this look even more awesome! Regardless whether you consider any of this, thanks for the quality content!"

"My thoughts are that its going to be much much harder than the Browns, but that I still expect to win."
"Other than Deshaun, not one person of their offense scares me."
"Any given sunday, but without Hopkins I don’t see their wr’s having any success vs our secondary, meaning we can blitz all day, which historically Watson has struggled with. Our offence will put up points like it always does. It is a good matchup for us"
"Offensively they're worse across the board than Cleveland is except at QB, which is a pretty significant step up. I expect them to test our defense more but even so I think we have the edge in that matchup.

Defensively they don't really match up all that well against us. JJ Watt is a good player but he's not 2015 Watt anymore. Their front seven does have good players around him but their DBs should struggle, particularly with Hollywood's speed. They'll need to *really* harass Lamar to protect their back end, which was Cleveland's strategy and it didn't work very well at all.

Overall they're a good team but I think we have the edge. We'll see how much their extra prep days help them but on paper we take this one."
Shutout
Last year they had the best receiver in the league and a bye week to prepare and got absolutely smoked. This year they have a couple extra days to prepare after looking like complete shit front to back after no real offseason. 52-10
"I was scared last year with Deandre Hopkins, not so much this year.


I don’t see how they score more than 14 points."
I’d like to see how fired up the texans come out playing. I’m sure they haven’t forgotten last years blowout so I’m sure they will give us all they have. I think if we can get out of the first half with a close game or even a small lead though I think we should comfortably come out in the second half ready to grind out the win.
"I’m excited to see us against a better qb. Watson looked bad week 1, not sure if it’s the loss of Hop or what, but last year we dominated their souls. I hope to see the same"
It’s gonna be nice having a tougher matchup before the chiefs game
"JJ Watt isn’t better then Garrett at this point in there respective careers, but Watt is a matchup nightmare for us, because he will challenge our interior line where only Bozeman is solid."
In my head. I keep saying we win by 13. I think that's more than believable.
"As long as we dont let Watson get comfortable, we should be ok.."

Considering the ravens are the browns 2.0. Welcome.
Acting like jumping ship now includes all the years since '95 is funny. Brush up on the dark days we sat through while you wore Brown and Orange before posturing like you have tenure.
""
Don't see 4th and 41 very often!
That was a sweet drive for sure. I also really enjoyed the thirty five second TD drive before the half after Beckham flubbed a third and two pass and the Browns missed the field goal ten yards right. Swinging from a possible 17-13 outcome on their last drive to down 24-6 had to ruin their halftime break.
"That game had two really great signs.

The 99 yard drive you mentioned and the perfectly executed two minute drill for a touchdown (only took us 49 seconds I believe).

The only criticism I have with Sunday's game is that Lamar should have come out a lot sooner than he did."
"That's a net 140 yds driven by the entire Ravens team offense and defense when you actually think about it. I don't believe it has ever happened before or will happen again in the NFL. For the defense to back up a team by 41 yds in 3 downs and then for the offense on the very next drive to march down 99 yds for a whopping 140 net yards total in consecutive drives is unimaginably great. But, when you play the Browns great things happen to the Ravens just like the 295 yds rushed by Jamal Lewis all those years ago."
"To be honest, 25 outta those 41 were forced by themselves. 3 consecutive Flags: Facemask OBJ and I believe two false starts. You know, the Browns doing Browns things."
How those 3rd and 4th downs aren't being talked about more is beyond me. I am choosing to  view it as a sign of things to come.
"Yeah that punt was awesome, I figured we were going to have a fruitless drive, hopefully getting up the field enough to get a decent punt off, but actually scoring there was so awesome"
""

If this actually happens then this will be the second consecutive year in which we beat our week 1 opponent so badly that the player they spent their second-most recent first round pick on got panic traded.
"It's funny how they've gone from ""Baker is the future and we have so many weapons"" to ""We look so good on paper. Why can't we get it together!?"""
"I honesty think this is a Ownership issue. 

After all these QBs, coaches, etc and you arguably have your best roster in a while. You can’t figure it out???"
why is this in the ravens sub
"No we dont need him but EDC has been very aggressive in the trade market Peters, Campbell hell he even tried to swing a trade for Hopkins and Clowney lol. Im expecting EDC to keep an eye on the situation."
Not true but ARob is one of the most underrated wrs in the league. He would instantly be our WR1.
"He’s just mad because he wants an extension and bears are undervaluing him. 

If that’s the case, we ain’t got the money for his extension."
"Hopkins is big pull. He isn't a rando. Every team should have been on the phone asking about him. 

Peters fell into our lap. The Rams wanted Ramsey. 

Campbell is basically the same. Fire sale on the jags end, why not see what they could get. 

I don't see picking this guy up, when he passed on us before AND we want to build up Hollywood Brown."
He's catch the TD Boykin dropped but ain't he due 15m?
Can he rush the passer?
"I don’t see it.. He isn’t a superstar like Earl/Calais/Clooney/Adams/Peters.. He falls into the “star” category. Not worth it when we have a potential superstar out of Hollywood + a ton of young guys who’s Reps he’d be eating into. If Snead was to go down then yes I’m all for it, but he isn’t really worth what we would have to give up to get him."
Dont need him. I like our WRs..
Stupid ass discussion. We'd sooner trade for an OLB who can edge set than AR12.

lol With defensive grades like that you'd think we were the ones that got blown out...
"Reminder, PFF grades are actively bashed by a lot of the football analytics community, and are extremely subjective. They provide information, but are imperfect in many other ways. For example Lamar last year didn’t grade out anywhere near where he probably should have. No point complaining, they aren’t the same thing as performance, just one way to assess play"
PFF off their wax pens
"I'm going to try to add a little bit of context for these. So here we go:

JK Dobbins also had a grade of 73.0

Bradley Bozeman had a pass block grade of 87.2

Matt Skura had a pass block grade of 76

Miles Boykin had a run block grade of 89.6

Defensively:

Malik Harrison had a coverage grade of 85, which is amazing

There were a number of players with tackling grades below 30 including Marcus Peters.

I can't really explain why the grades are so low without really looking deep. If I mentally go back to the game, I remember thinking that the problem with the Browns were the same as least year. Landry was open, but Baker makes the wrong read. Baker throws it to OBJ, but he drops the ball. Baker makes the read and Landry is open, but then he throws off-target. Running game is great, but they're down 20+. Just a bunch of small different miscues that makes the whole thing seem bad. It might just be that the Browns offense performed well overall and made our defense grade poorly, but those small mistakes led to 6 points in results."
LJ FORT IS A GOD
Peters played a good game I thought
I wonder about Malik grade? I thought he played pretty well.
"These grades are seriously pulled out of their ass.

Humphrey allowed 0 TDs and forced 1 PBU/1 INT and a sub 60 Passer rating if I'm not mistaken.

I thought Tyre also played well in the run blocking, I guess they weigh pass protection heavier.


How does a rookie who forced a fumble had a sack and a team high 8 tackles get such a poor grade?? 

There were two plays one a toss and one looked like a wheel route where he didn't get the tackle. Do they weigh that on one person?

I'm surprised they look at our D as poor, by DVOA we were top 5 and look to continue the trend of top 5-10 D.

I'd say our run D prob weighed us down"
"Was on a road trip going to different state's highest points (including MD, I made the state one rock higher), and I managed to avoid any spoilers for Sunday's game. Just watched the condensed version over lunch and hell yeah bois! A few mistakes here and there, but overall looking good! I'm freakin hyped. Also pretty happy to be able to open this subreddit too.

Absolute legend.

"Big, if true."
"Rumour has it that Buck Allen's legacy over the position is so strong, that it will now henceforth forever be known as 'Running Buck'"
"Kinda sad that this dude missed out on both 2014 and 2019. Perfectly slotted at the start of our only 3 year stretch without a playoff appearance since 96-99 and only experiencing a small tease of our future offense - never getting more than 5 offensive snaps while Lamar was starting in 2018 (10 total, only 1 in the playoff game)

We knew that his star would outshine any and all other Ravens, but Lamar was our future. How were we supposed to handle this situation any other way? He was simply too good for us. It wasn't fair."

Idk it could be fun but an open invite to spice up this page with wholesome memes of our Beast of a Qb while we await a Houstons destruction next Sunday."
"Even better 

Use his shirt as your canvas"
"I see everyone on this sub praising the defense and taking about how we dominated the brown's, but i haven't seen anyone mention the fact that Hunt average 5.5 YPC and Chubb had 6.0 YPC. Sure defense played a great game, held the brown's to 6 but there were still a lot of big gash runs and it's mildly concerning to me."
"I am not concerned because it is week one.
Week four was pretty pathetic last season.  But we turned out okay.  
In a manner of speaking it is pre season."
"When you jump out to a big lead like that you kind of concede the run and focus on not giving up anything deep. However, there is still work to be done on that front. I'm not worried though. 2 rookie starting ILB's and 3 new guys on the D-line rotation including 2 starters. They'll get it figured out."
"When yards start to translate to points, I'll be concerned. It's a bend, but don't break sort of thing. I mean, we put up 500+ yards of offense against the Titans and only scored 12 points. Points wins games."
"It was a porous run defense, but keep in mind it’s week 1 and Chubb and Hunt are great backs.  David Johnson had one pretty good game, but I don’t expect him to be on that level so the worry is lessened."
gotta give queen and harrison a bit of time to acclimate before judging too harshly
Outside runs look to be the problem.  Hopefully they get it corrected.
Queen got held up on blocks frequently.  Has a lot of growing to do but he has special speed.
"Take out each RBs longest carry and shortest and you have -

Chubb - 8 carries for 32 yards (4.0  ypc)

Hunt - 11 carries for 50 yards (4.5 ypc)

Those are much more realistic numbers and show how stout the Ravens rush defense actually was. We are not going to prevent every single big play, and that can skew averages, but look at what we let up on an average play and it is a far better indication of what we did

We only let up 4 runs of 10 yards or more out of 27 attempts, the average carry length before first contact was 2.1. Our run defense was dominant, we just played 2 of the top 10 RBs in the league at the same time"
Hunt was also used out wide  a lot which you really aren't going to stop kareem hunt from being effective out wide unless you create a well disguised blitz from the safetys hes been doing it his whole career. And honestly I'll take that from chubb getting one big 30 yard run all game instead of the 84 yards to the house. This defense is pretty new together with no pre season it's not gonna be 2000 off the rip
"Its somewhat part of the heavy blitzing scheme.  When you have 5 or 6 guys pinning their ears back constantly, you're taking the risk of getting gashed in the run game."
"If the pass D keeps playing the way it has been, I'm fine giving up 5 ypc."
"It's concerning to me too, because it's in large part what caused the loss in the playoffs last year. However, two things to consider: 1) it's week one, so there is time to make improvements and 2) even if the defense plays the way it did last year, it's only going to cause a problem if the offense isn't hitting on all cylinders."
"Its week one is they had two very fast and talented runners. We held them to 6 points. Force a fumble on a rushing attempt. 

I dont know what more you want. They didnt let them run it up our assholes all day. Could have been worse."
I just chalk it up to the first game and the D still putting it together and being rusty. Remember too that Chubb and Hunt are two of the very best RB tandems in the league...
""
"And before anyone shits on PFF, Ken McKusick and Sarah Ellison agree."
Wonder if Fluker moving over to tackle mid game had anything to do with it
"Best left tackle in football went down, guy who plays mostly guard stepped in at tackle, rookie right guard, and another guy coming off a MAJOR knee injury. Oh, we also played a very good dline.

If that was the WORST that they are going to play, and given the circumstances, it very well may be the worst they could play, I will be more than happy with it.

They will get better, and they will be fine."
Cleveland has arguably the best d line in the league though
"I was saying this during the game, the browns D line won as hard as I've ever seen a d line win. They were in the backfield every play and were slowing our potent run offense. All the Ravens had to do was run scramble drills. The browns just couldn't catch Lamar even with penetration every play, and Lamar was finding his receivers on the run. 

People look at Lamar's numbers and go 'wow look what he did from the pocket'. Nah. He did that shit on the run, the whole game. And still posted the highest efficiency of the week. The dude literally transcends the game. There is nothing the browns could have done to stop it. I mean it might be the most ridiculous performance I've ever seen from Lamar individually, because I've never seen him under that much pressure."
"And we still won 38-6! This team is already scary good but still has a lot of room to improve. I believe they will. Don’t overreact, we didn’t have a oreseason. Give these guys a few weeks to gel and get better as a unit. The ravens are the team in the nfl with the highest ceiling."
It's going to take time to move on from Yanda.
Looking forward to seeing how they deal with Watt next week
Idk I rewatched the game and did not see glaring oline issues. Shit happens but on big plays Lamar had time to throw and that's how we scored.
"Not too big of a deal imo. The fact that TP is a rookie, Skura literally destroyed his knee 10 months ago, and Fluker was just signed a few months ago gives me hope they’ll improve. Just as long as they don’t end up on that list by November, everything will be okay."
"Correa making an appearance on that list too. Can’t believe he found another team and is getting any playing time, time and time again showing how he’s not a NFL caliber player"
I'm pretty much done with PFF. Not saying that we were great but I'm not sold on their ratings meaning anything anymore.

The Ravens have never had a player make it in as a receiver or as a center. I’m not counting Jermaine Lewis or Jacoby Jones who were WRs but made it in as returners. I’m also not counting Morgan Cox who made it as a long snapper. Here’s to hoping that changes this year with Hollywood and Skura!

Edit: Ravens had Zuttah make it as a center in 2016. So looks like receiver is the only position left."
I thought Jeremy Zuttah made it in 2015 or 2016.
We’ve had receivers that should have made the pro-bowl. Mason had over 100 catches a few years ago.

"I met Elvis Dumerville once at the giant in pikesville. He was incredibly nice, but I still felt bad about disturbing his grocery shopping."
"I keep going back-and-forth in my head how tomorrow will go.

Most of me thinks this is just another opponent in the way and will a be a breeze just as last years 41-7 drubbing went. Easy win, no questions, on to KC.

Then my pessimistic side is like, Deshaun Watson just got paid and is tired of playing second fiddle to Mahomes and Lamar in the eyes of the league. 

“But Bill O’Brien actively makes them bad”, I know the fact he’s still their HC and GM is mind boggling, but i digress. An embarrassment on during the first game of the year on National television, tack on a 10-day break, first home game (with fans mind you), and a relatively healthy team has me thinking tomorrow could be a trap game. 

We have KC on Sunday Night next week, the only team that routinely has had our number during this past run. I’m not saying we’re looking forward but if you said some guys were, no part of me would be surprised, hell, I’m making plans already for next weekend. 

Someone calm my nerves, thanks. #Truzz"
"Well, we should win, but this is the nfl. You never know until the game is over, or at the very least, the end of the 3rd quarter when Lamar gets pulled again."

isnt the chiefs ravens game on monday night next week?
"You know what's one of the best things about being a fan? 

Other than some emotional investment (or the ill-advised sports bet with large amounts of actual money on the line), the outcome of the game has little to no impact in the grand sheme of things for us as fans.  

Sure, maybe a small heartbreak here or there happens when the team loses an important game, but we also get high highs & a fun ride when things are going good, & right now my friend, things are going great. So, to keep it short & simple...

Just enjoy the fireworks."
"Haha I wish that Ravens -KC game could be played with fans :(

Although tin the grand scheme of things it’s rly not important haha. But we’ve played them twice now in KC, 
I’d love to see the outcome in front of our crew and home field advantage!!"
Ravens roll. Houston doesn’t have enough on offense to really challenge the Ravens Defense. Our ground game should pick back up this week and it’ll be a 3+ score blow out.
"The Ravens will win. Or Houston will run all over us, control the clock, get some key stops and get an unlikely victory. Hopefully the first one."
"Believe me, I'm all for routes. But I think one of the issues that we saw in the playoffs last year was that we blew so many people out in the regular season we didn't really know how to play from behind. 

Obviously we win and Lamar stunts all over them hoes, just hoping the Texans can offer some competition"
We gonna stunt
We’re in great Position RN. on paper the browns have a great team yes they are the browns but they got the offense to give any defense trouble and we routed them. Next 2 games we atleast need to go 2-1 and we’ll be in amazing shape after that we got 3 “gimmies” WAS CIN PHIL I’m sure we can go 3-0 during that stretch. playing Cleveland’s offense then Playing Watson and Mahomes back to back weeks would probably be any teams nightmares to start a season. Worst case scenario is we go 1-2 in these next 2 weeks.
"After seeing how lamar has handled himself since entering the league and his and hollywood's comments about sleeping on the titans, I dont think trap games are gonna be a thing for this team. At least for this year. Its gonna be a blood bath"

THEN ITS MF GAMEDAY"
"Damn, game isn’t until 4, just figured that out. Buzz = killed"
Where are the NFL live streams?
"Gotta start fast, score early and often, and hopefully just kill clock and wear them down.

I am a little scared because this is a textbook ""look ahead"" spot on the road with the Chiefs coming to town next Monday night."

":(

It’s hard to argue with, he deserves it. He’s much better than Tunsil. 

But also, fuck"
"Stanley’s deal is a forgone conclusion at this point. Besides Lamar, the most important guy on the team is the one who protects his blindside. Pay that man his money!"
"We can and will do it, if the chiefs and the Rams can afford to pay all their players, so will we. It’ll be even easier with Earl gone too"
He deserves it and I have faith in Big Dick DeCosta to figure out a way to give it to him.
"How can every position keep getting paid more and more? TE, CB, QB, among others, at some point the market has to stop getting reset"
"It’s frustrating—I think we made a mistake not getting his deal done before Tunsil. Maybe Stanley wasn’t willing to negotiate until Tunsil’s deal got done, but it feels like we’ve painted ourselves in a corner now."
"I know we’re in good shape next year for the salary cap, but damn we’re still going to have a hard time paying everyone."
"Give him on of those 10 year contracts with a lot garuanteed. Maybe he'll take a discount lol. 

But seriously, his cap hit is already like 13 mil, an extra 10 won't hurt too much. Hopefully he's not trying to be greedy."
Well deserved
Justified.
Pay that man!!

"Such a classy shirt, do they ship to the Netherlands?  Hahaha"
"Is it unpopular to believe Deshaun Watson does not belong in the same group as Mahomes, Wilson, and Lamar? I think he's an athletic and unique talent but I don't think he's transcendent like the other three. His praise and glory reminds me of Matt Ryan's in his prime. Treated as golden when he's silver at best, and when he doesn't succeed it's always because of everything around him. Meanwhile, Lamar has to prove himself weekly and does. Maybe it's me."
"Think you meant Wilson and not Watson in that first sentence. But yes I agree. He looked pretty just okay in the opener. Great athlete no doubt, but not a great quarterback yet. But his O Line has never been good for him"
Yea  it definitely isn’t unpopular.  I think most would agree Watson is a step below Mahomes/Wilson/Lamar.
"He’s great when he has an all star cast around him, but it’s becoming clear that without top tier players, his offense is not that good. Feel like Lamar could step in there and just take over and still make plays in all facets on offense"
"It was interesting to see that according to Mike Sando's QB Tier list, NFL coaches and executives still rate Watson over Jackson. 

It seems like Watson's issues get excused by his sub-par coaching and team, while Jackson's accomplishments get excused by good coaching and his athletic talents. 

For the record, I like Watson but Lamar is clearly ahead of him."
I think he’s good but not great. I also think he has boneheads for coaches and a FO that isn’t doing him any favors by trading away one of the best WRs in the NFL in his prime for an injury prone RB who has seen his best years behind him
We still haven't seen what Watson does in a season without Hopkins who is probably the best WR in the league. I think he is being overrated by many and you need to consider his lone playoff win to be a fluke since Josh Allen basically gifted them the game. But of course the agenda will be Bill O'Brien is the one holding him back when he will play bad.
"I think Watson is limited by his team and coaching. Not as good as Lamar and Mahomes, but I bet if he's in Reid's offense he would be in the same tier."
"I dont think its unpopular here, and maybe mixed with other subs. He's a good QB, dont get me wrong, but I agree, I wouldnt put him anywhere near Mahomes, Wilson, or Jackson. 

I think this year without Hopkins will really tell how good he really is."
"I agree, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to me. He is clearly talented, but he hasn’t been able to put it together on a consistent basis the way the others in the group you listed have. I don’t understand the love and money he has gotten."
tbf to him I think he was totally unprotected behind that line last year. Plus his HC is awful.
"Ive been a fan of watson since he was at clemson and believe he could be maybe just below lamar and mahomes if he was in a different situation. Lamar and mahomes have taken their teams to a new level and deshaun hasnt, but he does have by far and fucking away the worst coach and front office of the 3"
"I think he’s good, but not great. He could’ve been much better by now if he had a better coaching and weapons around him. He probably could’ve been as hot as Lamar in a system that’s more designed around him, but I’m not sure Houston has the brain trust to figure that out."
"I think it’s about to become more and more popular. I don’t think he’s as good and he’s always had stacked talent, now his boy Hopkins is gone"
Watson does deserve to be in that group
"I dont think hes put into those conversations because of talent. 

I think hes there (for the most part) because along with Lamar and Patty hes part of the next generation of QBs.

Drew Brees to their Brady v Manning if you will. not the best example but I do think he'll have some success"
"Absolutely disagree. Watson is amazing. The Texans have allowed so many QB hits and Sacks in the past 3+ years, I think even the best of QBs would struggle behind it"
"This isn't unpopular I don't think.

What's unpopular is taking it a step further and saying that he doesn't even belong in that next tier and without Hopkins he doesn't really offer much than slightly above average play.

Obviously thats yet to be proven but it's been my thought since his rookie year. He has gotten bailed out on so many bad throws by Hopkins. Until I see him do it without Hopkins I can't in good conscience rank him above or in line with the likes of Rodgers, Brees, Brady, Tannehill, Dak, or whoever else you may put on that next tier down after the top 3."
I like Watson and think he is a great QB on that level. Very talented and often creates something from nothing. Hard to succeed with a bad o-line and BoB. Even with those obstacles they should've beat KC last year in the playoffs. Completely choked that game away. I feel bad for him if anything. How do you give Hopkins away for peanuts and then spend that money on cooks and Johnson. Just abysmal FO decisions
I blame it on BoB
Yes it's unpopular because it's wrong and a dumb opinion.
"He reminds me a lot of early-career Andrew Luck. People would act like he's the new face of the league, but he's only better-than-average.

Watson has a ton of potential, but potential doesn't make you elite."

Hey! Another Tech fan too! love it
no offense but that fantasy team is terrible
U winning today
The sad part is this is actually better than a lot of y’all haters teams😂
Wait... so who’d you take in the first round then cause hopefully it wasn’t Lamar lmao
"I thought I was too much of a homer with Jackson, Tucker, and our D!"
Guess you’re conceding the bye week
Terrible lineup
I will clap and maybe even say “Yes” if they do so.
Yes
I want Mark Andrews to score a touchdown.
"Clap? Do you mean Applause (n, approval or praise expressed by clapping) ?"
I believe Lord Baltimore's Ravens will win the American Football game against Sam Houston's Texans
Clap clap
I concur.

i’m too used to ravens past. i was waiting for a loss every game of the 12 game win streak
Nah this team is driven they aren’t gonna be listening to any talking heads on TV
"Yes, but I'm superstitious and weak."
"I’m still nervous for every game, tbh. The anxiety keeps me humble 🙃"
"Nah I think I'm done being nervous in the regular season. We finally have a team capable of carrying the load on both sides (if the defense sucks Lamar can easily hang 30+ on this team, if the offense is stalling I can see the defense containing Watson).

The annoying part is we could win this game 27-17 and analysts would start asking 'Are the Ravens starting to slip' lol."
"No. In the short run, any NFL team is dangerous, the games are notoriously flukey, and everything could come together either against us or for us. But in the long run the Ravens are a championship-quality team."
"It's always good to be a little nervous about teams like the Texans. Teams that aren't flat out bad, and that have the capability to surprise you. Like, they have talent, and that talent can show up for any given game, but the coaches can't make it gel from week to week.

That being said, I think our D is gonna feast on that O-line."
Could be a close game or could be a shutout.
Some analysts are predicting this to be close. Stephen A and Mike Vick even called for the Texans to win
I’m always nervous. No matter how good we looked last week I have ptsd from the boller days and Flacco’s inconsistency days.
Hell no im predicting that too cuz its happening
Nope
"10-7, both lines lookn suspect for the Ravens so far."
"I’m nervous because ofc I want this team to win, but I also don’t want Watson and Watt to start off 0-2. Deshaun is amazing, I just don’t know why he had to face two of the best teams in the league in back to back weeks. 

I just want a close game, regardless who wins"

You do realize the Monstars lose right?

"Jim Rome said that Kyler Murray is a more explosive runner than Lamar....


People are crazy 😂"
"Kyler is a great runner. Should probably run more often. But the stratosphere that Lamar is in running the ball is different. Kyler is lightning. Lamar is a fucking nuke running the ball. Just fucks everything up. Your eyes, ankles, soul, etc"
I didnt know jim rome was still alive 😂😂
It’s Jim Rome. Dudes a clown
what the hell is wrong with people
"Well, his runs are more explosive but thats because his runs are almost exclusively scrambles. These will inherently be bigger than designed runs. 

HOWEVER, Lamar is still more explosive. But I can see why someone would say that about Murray's running."
"Now Lamar isn’t running enough, you say?"
"He just seems more explosive because he has shorter legs and therefore sorter strides. Makes him look SUPER fast! 

Lamar with his longer strides just looks like he's almost coasting as he's running (IE look at Randy Moss)"
"This season sure. Overall, no way in hell. Lamar hasn’t really gotten it going yet on the ground. But I think that’s mostly by design. Teams are terrified of him gashing them for big gains so it’s been a huge part of their game plan. But this offseason he focused on getting better at passing so he doesn’t always have to do that and so far it’s paying off."
I guess by some measures he arguably might be. I feel like he can hit zero to sixty in a straight line a little quicker maybe. But he’s nowhere near as elusive and doesn’t have the same change of direction as Lamar does.
"Maybe, but Lamar’s vision and elusiveness is the best a qb’s EVER had."
even if true it only means they are both explosive af
"Everyone just flocks to the new shiny thing. 🙄

They’re both awesome, but Murray isn’t the open field runner that Lamar is."
If you compared him to last year Lamar than you're absolutely right. Something about this year tho (granted only 2 games) where he just hasn't been running at the same level as last year.
Rome is a very excitable dude.
"Explosive runner? Lamar wins.

Explosive offense? Sorry guys, but Kyler has insane receiving weapons and a pretty good RB too."
"Seems like the lack of pre-season games/contact may be catching up to some teams with the insane amount of injuries today. Hope everyone on both teams, both sides of the ball can come out of today’s game fully healthy."
"Don’t go on r/NFL today y’all, it’s looking like an obituary page in a newspaper"

I am so fucking gay for Mark Ingram III idgaf what anyone says
You just lost to Mark Ingram at QB.😂🤣
Also what a block by Mekari
[deleted]
"Big brain move from Harbaugh.

- If you lose the challenge, you lose the timeout you probably would've used anyway to regroup before, basically, a game-deciding call.
- The time the ref will be under the hood will almost certainly be more time than a normal timeout.
- You can luck out and pick up the first!"
Did y’all see what happened? I didn’t see a replay.
I definitely feel like Lamar was grumpy today 😂
Kinda wish we'd let Lamar get a TD there somehow. 😂
Dobbins said fuck yo defence
I like the call to Hollywood but maybe they could have disguised it better. Regardless nice tackle by the Texans defender
Lamar got us 3 points there. Evaded like 4 sacks.
Ok guys time to put RGIII in
FOH with these tik tok commercials
Lamar said 😐
Lamar looked bored af on the bench
LAMAR in a commercial!!!
Fun fact: Lamar is 9/10 right now
They're just targeting Anthony levine since the tavon young injury
Deshon Elliot is a work in progress right now
"Okay, now get some defense.  I want a turnover."
"Good lord, Tucker's kick couldn't have been more on center."
That’s a touchdown
Who called for the marlo Play lol
"I'm sorry, 15 straight games with a takeaway? Is this even legal?"
Peters is an absolute fucking chad
Deshaun looked like he wanted to break that surface lol
This fucking interior O line is hot garbage
Refs gifting the Texans 3 points is pathetic
"Nice drive, refs"
What fucking garbage refs spotting the Texans up the field there and even giving them time to get a FG
I think we downplayed the loss of Yanda
The O-line is booboo tiddy fuck today
PIT/KC going to feast on our Oline if we don’t get it worked out.
Brown is straight up getting over powered at the LOS. He gets knocked back 2-3 yards instantly.
Yall acting like OBJ is not playing against JJ fucking Watt
Averett looking like Chykie Brown
LJ jumped on the pile😂
[deleted]
8 minute drive needed here
"What’s it like to root for a good team? 

-sad nyj fan"
YES. The truss is STILL enormous.
At first i thought it was lamar that took it then i was like why is he not running way faster lmao
Big Trusssssssss
THATS MY RUNNINGBACK
MI2 going fucking mauy thai on the logo is the funniest shit I have seen today lmao
Earl who?
I love this team.
I just want a Lamar bomb to the endzone and im good
CBS show some god damn replays. What the fuck?
Grumpy Lamar gonna stunt next week
Tuck is definately happy today
Shoutout to Jimmy smith for not hearing his name at all today
I don’t deserve this. What did I do in my life to deserve being this happy every Sunday?
JK has such a bright future
I like Dobbins. I just think he's neat 🙂
DOBBINS IS FUCKING LEGIT
"That Dobbins run is gonna make it look like we curbstomped the Texans with the run game today when that's not exactly the story, lol."
Its funny to see players on the other team surrounding lamar after the game. They are such big fans of him 😂
Man fuck all these injuries today. Wtf.
slay kweeeeeen slayyyyyyyy
"Tough time for his first bad throw, I think he had the TD"
The sound of the ball being kicked in an empty stadium is so satisfying
lamar has to take the space and get the easy first down. I know going for TDs is nice but on 3rd you gotta secure the first
3 man rush lamar should have scrambled that time
Marlon the most underrated defensive player In the game. No one even acknowledges it
It looks like LJ got in
Marlo and punching the ball out. Name a more iconic duo
"[Marlon's new sponsorship deal](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819OuxQ09ZL._SX425_PIbundle-4,TopRight,0,0_AA425SH20_.jpg)"
Not the LJ who I thought would score today but I’ll take it
"Fort isn't a HOFer. And he may not be on the Ravens all that long, but fuck if he's not a great story and an awesome pickup. Love that guy."
LJ + LJ = SB LV
"Somewhere, Ed Reed is smiling"
"Yeah, Marlo and Marcus are going All-Pro again."
I love MP JUICEMAN
"Marshall yanda if you’re listening, if Jesus can come back from the dead you can come back to play in the NFL. Marshall pls"
Refs are babying Texans
Holy fuck they're really trying to get Houston back in this game.
"Move Marlo into the slot, Jimmy & Peters to the outside? 3 best corners on the field like last year. Don’t want to see Averett out there."
Late to the party but wtf was that illegal contact call? Why didn’t the refs just give them 3pts
I don’t like how Much Lamar is getting hit in the pocket so far this season. PROTECT THE FRANCHISE
"Honestly thank god for the LJ fort TD...otherwise this would be an uncomfortable 13-10 lead.

We get the ball at the start of the half. Keep up the faith, Flock."
Harbaugh: mask tastes good 😂
Thank God for Tucker... where would we be without him?
averett stinks but that was a hell of a throw by deshaun
Get averetts trash ass off the field fuck
"Trade or sign another CB, Averrett cannot play"
Bench Averett play Jimmy
"Offense needs to turn it up a bit. Defense is going to be a little gassed, long drive."
"[Jesus Christ, I had no idea Fairbairn was this good. ](https://i.imgur.com/rpMyI2y.jpg)"
I was wondering why Lamar looked so slow until I saw the 2-1 on the jersey
[deleted]
Ingram: HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
"We all feeling a little anxious with the game, acting like 30pts aint our base line😎😎😎"
Stanley isn't known as a run blocker but holy crap was that great
Where are all the 'GreG RomAn is TrYing to Be tOo cUtE' comments?
# BIG TRUSS NO LITTLE TRUSS
Why is Ingram always physically abusive to opposing teams' logos lmao
BIG RB. NO LIL RB.
Team looks inconsistent asf and we still drop 38 & 30 SCARY
"Mahomes is 13/28. 

wat"
I sprinkled the old bay on my natty right before that drive. Good luck charm? I think so.
Tavon Young’s injury is gonna be a hit to the secondary 😭
Love that Harbs trusts Lamar.
I’m a little disappointed with how little we’ve run Ingram tbh.
"SHOW THE REPLAY OF THE DQ

why is the broadcast so bad about showing replays today"
When’s the last time Tucker kicked 4+ FGs
Really puts into perspective how fucking incredible our team is that I somehow feel disappointed with today’s game 🤣
DOBBINS! only if you could broke that off for a td. 🤣🤣
DOBBY IS FREE
Pick your poison of which RB you want to fuck you up
Wannabe Lamar runs to get wannabe Tucker in position for chipshot field goal
Wonder how some of you fairweathers would've handled the Flacco regime lmao
why do i even come to this thread when we're not winning by 40.
"The ravens didn't finish with 200 yards rushing


>!JK YOU FRICKEN MORON!<"
Important to remember we are probably the best Offense in the league. Every team is going to bring their best effort each week. Lamar making good decisions today. o line needs to give him more time.
"Don't forget to switch to incognito browser, guys, we about to watch a whole team get fucked by a beautiful black man"
Useless Broncos
I still don't understand how Ricard missed that block on 2nd down
That jet sweep with hollywood went so bad lol
Fuck these indoor stadiums with concrete floors
"We’re only 13 minutes (real clock, not game clock) into the game, and my anxiety is already sky high"
This play calling is weird as fuck
What is going on right now? Is the offense not in sync this game??
"OK, all these designed Lamar runs... Why?"
It's points I'll take it
Remember last year guys it was 0-0 against the Texans late into the 2nd quarter. We then won 41-7 😬
i miss yanda
I’ll take that instead of Watson getting sacked and then starting our drive in our own half
EARL WHO?!?!?
THICC RICC
Heh. My wife just called the last 2 plays.  I married a winner.
No crowd noise being pumped in? Pretty sure I hear crowd noise...
Gonna be a close game but we got this
I swear Hollywood looks like a kid playing with adults 😂
We’re playing okay. Just a few miscues here and there. No worries
That's a fucking touchdown
Marlon Humphrey is literally “One Punch Man” hahaha
that's a fucking touchdown
Dude LJ Fort. I don’t know how he’s so good but he is.
"Thanks for cutting LJ Pittsburgh!!

Edit: Trading"
robbed the rams
"That's Mr. MPJuiceman, sir"
I LOVE RAVENS FOOTBALL
Peter's is an insane ball hawk.
The O Line is worrisome.
These fucking refs hahaha
Cobb was being a fucking bitch
"they just fucking gifted the Texans a field goal to keep them in the game, what fucking bullshit"
Trash refereeing
"On some drives we look Elite, other drives we look lost lol"
Bills beat the dolphins by 3 and now Allen is leading the MVP race? Bills fans are so special.
"RBs need to be involved in the offense second half, Texans gonna keep getting to Lamar if the playcalling revolves around Lamar dropping back on 90% of snaps. Way too predictable."
"I know we are up two scores, but it doesnt feel like.  Offense is off sync and defense is struggling to stop Watson.  Not to mention the refs helped with two bs calls at the end"
What the fuck is an illegal double team block?
"Hello, OLine?  Can you please show up?"
Peters almost stripped the ball
Fire Averett into the goddamn sun
Not having Tavon in there is a liability. Hope he’s alright!
Harbaugh looks pissed
Week 2 ppl calm down
TRADE #93 HE SUCKS SO BAD s/
Somehow held them to a FG. You want to see frustrating? Block the kick
[deleted]
ROUNDHOUSE KICK THE LOGO
ROUNDHOUSE
What a fucking play
When in doubt TRUZZZZZZZ
No little boi
HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
##WILDCAT ON 4TH AND 1 TD
"We want the chiefs 

We want the chiefs"
That Brian Billick offensive genius finally coming to fruition. I knew he had it in him.
[Mark Ingram becoming Chuck Norris](https://twitter.com/RealPavetexRob/status/1307813273589481475)
Calais Campbell probably reminds offensive players of when they first saw California redwood trees. #shallnotpass
Fairbairn ain’t half bad
Horrible spot! WTF
Andrews held that block and that was a TD
"Sad news to report. Patriots' RB James White's father was in a car crash today and did not survive. His mother was also in the car and is in critical condition.

White's father, Tyrone, was a captain with the Miami-Dade Police Department.

James was told and is inactive tonight. - @AndySlater"
Fuck the Titans
I wanted Mandrews TD but I guess
bruh Dobbins is fucking unreal
Fucking Chargers choked
We have so many weapons its hard to involve them all. Miles Boykins looks really good so far
Just because we haven't scored 2 tds yet doesn't mean the sky is falling. This will be a close game.
"If we blow out the Texans it'll be because they're bad, yet if the steelers go 2-0 it's all about how they're back. Just like the Browns when beating up the bengals"
This poor guy is so injury prone 😕
tavon and injuries is an iconic duo i do not enjoy
I remember when we had Mark Ingram.  Those were the days.
Roman trying too hard
Patrick Queen is everywhere! Wow! The dude is so fast
Jihad Ward has 20-20 foresight
I love y'all but these comments have me SERIOUSLY questioning y'all's knowledge of the game.
Imagine not converting on 4th and 1 in your own territory and the opposing team scores a touchdown
I feel like Boyle has been stopped inside the 5 like 4-5 times now in his career.
Ofc the best Heisman house commercial is the one with Lamar in it
Lmfao these dudes can’t get set and a play off in time with NO CROWD NOISE. Texans are bums lol
Gotta start sacking this dude
Justin “Hands” Tucker
Hey guys FGs give us points too. Some of the people in here are wayy too spoiled
Someone here just called for a Marlon type of play.  Good job honey.
One punch man Marlo
Marlon is so good at punching the ball out
Humphrey was destined to be a Raven.
Marlon Humphrey is like the one punch man of the NFL
Man LJ has been a beast for us
That’s a fucking TD
"Baller ass play, so lucky to scoop Fort"
LJ Fort is a damn good player he was only a journeyman because the rest of the league didn’t know how to use him .
Get Marlon the Brinks truck!
Man if we had a pass rush we’d be nastyyyyy
I audibly yelled holy shit
Even Peters looked surprised that he got that as he got up lol
Petition to change Marcus Peters nick name to MP grape juice man
HAHA why is MP wearing a winter hat in Texas in September. Love that guy.
So the wide receiver can just barrel into the corner and get an illegal contact?
FUCK OFF REFS
"every time i hear number 23, i forget who the fuck it is

then remember why i dont remember every time

averett is just erased from my mind"
These refs are actually so trash
Why is Averett on the field when Jimmy Smith exists and Brandon Carr is a FA
What the fuck is that?
These refs are actually missing chromosomes
What a gift of 3 points. Man.
"That was some bullshit, bullshit calls meant to give the Texans come points smfh. I hope we come back out and destroy them 😈"
"Grade A bullshit, ref. Texans should thank them for the 3 points"
Everything about that drive was horseshit officiating
"https://twitter.com/TorreySmithWR/status/1307799585994223617
lol Torrey vs. Pollard"
JK with the Ray Rice type crawl.
Offensive line is getting exploited today. Not good moving forward.
Damn our O-line blows today...
Phillips is gonna lose starting position I bet. Dude is not great.
"That kick was reminiscent of the game winner in the playoffs against Denver. Same distance and looked the same.

Also how the fuck was that not Pi on Andrews?"
O-Line looking shaky but we’ll bounce back
O line looks atrocious today
"We have arguably the best offensive tackle duo in the league, but the interior O-line is looking like a big liability. That just can't stay the case moving forward."
Too many FGs today.  Roman has to get away from drop back pass plays down field and run some quick slants draws or SOMETHING to slow the rush because our O line cant
Should be 27 - 7 SMH
Clay Matthews is at home watching our abysmal pass rush
Russ Wilson looking like Lando Calrizzian. 😂
My name's Anthony Averett and I use cable
Get Averrett off the field.
Averet giving Chykie Brown flashbacks
Shocker. Averett getting bitched as usual
"It feels like we're playing so bad, but we're still up 13 with 1 quarter left. I am becoming very conscious of how spoiled we are"
"If they get this its still a 10 point game, just need to pound the rock"
I love the home crowd boos when there’s no home crowd
A long scoring drive would do a lot for us right now boys. And the great llama still need to tack atleast 2 tds to his stat sheet.
"Bill Polian finally got his wish, Lamar lined up at WR"
BIG NUTZ HARBZ
BIG BOY NO LITTLE BOY
Tucker got a lot of fantasy points this game too
"TOOOOOOUCHDOWNNNNN RAAAAAAVENNNSSSS

AND A BEATING ON THE TEXANS LOGO

TRUSS"
This is why we will always be that team to go for 4th down
Chiefs are looking very soft and very beatable today. Love to see it
How did Fort miss that sack
"It's crazy that this is an ""off day"" for the team"
If KC loses to Herbert's first start
I think that's a good challenge. Lamar might have gotten it.
Aaaaaand unclench.
Was against the decision but I can’t be mad with the outcome
"I'm calling it, defense with a garbage time INT."
This game was just so we could get JT some reps
Dobbins is gonna be a superstar
Yo Dobbins is wild for real
JK but he ain't Joking
"Love watching Dobbins. Speed to get to the edge, tough enough to bang through the center, and good contact balance to break tackles. The future is bright"
man it’ll feel like an eternity until next monday
"So, they just forgot about Tucker? “Butker best in the league”"
I'm going to run that play on my wife tonight.
I much prefer when the Ravens reach the end zone instead of the texans. Perhaps the Ravens should do that more?
"The Ravens are playing very well for my birthday today. Just a few observations:

- I'm liking a lot of Jackson's decision-making. A couple high throws (esp the throw on the dig route that was caught by the jumping WR), but overall he's been good.

- Averett is not a starting DB. He's committed a couple dumb penalties and left his assignment open a couple times.

- I like the DL pressure on Watson. Still stunned he got away from a sack.

A solid 7/10 performance.

The illegal contact calls were pretty ticky-tacky calls. I saw a little bit of contact on the one replay that they showed on the first call, but I would've not called either."
"""how are we beating kc next week"" as if they aren't struggling against the chargers right now. 

they're obviously the team to beat and will be tough to beat, but some of you need to chill."
How is this trash o line going to stand up to KC next week?
Wtf is this play calling rn...
Wish we would run it more...
Decent drive sucks we didn’t come out with 6 but miles better than our first drive.
Patrick Queen is everywhere and I fucking love it
Wish that ATT girl was my friend and nothing else.
HOW DID HE GET UP SO FAST LMAO
Way to make up for last weeks fumble Ricky
Lamar's about to bring me back from 40 points down in fantasy
###GOT UP LIKE A MAN POSSESSED
Lol. My boy Ricard ain't letting that ball go for anything.
That cat commercial was terribly awesome.
"We need to trade for a real pass rusher tbh

An edge"
The only time we get anything remotely close to a good pass rush is when we scheme up a blitz that gets a us a free runner to the QB. We don’t have anyone that can beat their blocker.
Annoying. Hope the defense can clean up a bit like last week too. Watson's obviously better than Mayfield though
Watson is good guys we are not playing against Baker
Bless u Tucker
We fine y’all. Even when the offense looks out of sync we’re gaining yards and getting first downs.
Fruit Punch.. is back!
He totally scored there!!!
Marlo has mastered the peanut punch
fuck kiko alonso!!
We ask for turnover we receive. We ask for TD we receive I love the Llama era
LJ Fort.....most under-rated Ravens FA signing ever?
"Defense is nasty, I just wish we had more of a passrush."
"LJ Fort is the Ravens defensive MVP so far this year, who would've thought"
Quick reminder that LJ Fort WASNT EVEN ON A TEAM this time last year. DeCosta has a knack for finding talent where no one else does
Chiefs are losing. I just wanna see that team become human.
lj fort consistently proves to me why he deserves to be my new favorite linebacker.
I like that from Harrison.
MP JUICEMAN HE GOT THAT JU ICE IN HIM
Fruit punch straight to the juice man! 2020 no fly zone baby!!!
Bro this defense is nasty
Holy fuck that was beeeeeautiful
I would pay to have a live stream of Marcus Peters mic’d up
"It’s just the Browns, right?"
WHAT A CATCH!!!
jesus h christ i love this goddamn football team
That pick might have been the best catch so far this game
"Man... that INT was incredible. All hands, full extension & against the grain while going to the ground?"
Give me MP juiceman over Ramsey every day of the week and twice on Sundays
"okay justice hill in a commercial lol, random."
What an interception...  holy hell. MP Juiceman
get ronnie out.
How long would it take Marshal to put on 100 lbs?
This game is a good example of badly we miss Yanda. Not only his blocking ability but his line calls as well.
Good guy Marcus Peters lmaoo
Pussy ass call
"Our pass rush sucks, but to make it worse, they can’t tackle whatsoever. We miss 90% of our chances at sacks which are already rare."
Sorry but these are just some bad calls. Not too upset with our D this drive.
WTF just happened?
What the hell is happening
These fucking refs. Wow
How much BoB paying these reff to keep his job
That’s such bullshit
"What the fuckkkk, these refs 😂😂😂"
Still up by 10 AND we get the ball to start the 2nd half
"The ravens are going to have to dial up some quick hitters. The texans are sitting deep like they did against the chiefs. 

Lamar gotta look for his checkdown. 3 sacks at the half against this defense is keeping the game from being a blowout."
Is it part of the (defense exhausted = fresh Dobbins in) gameplan or why on earth isn't JK getting any carries?
Man I’m so happy to have Ray rice back
"How was that not dpi, mckinney never gets his head around"
Where’s our illegal contact call?
Its like we're fucking shocked they blitz everyone on 3rd downs. They've been doing it all day.
Can Greg Roman realize they're blitzing those situations and get some designed out of pocket throws?
Maybe we can finally get some pressure
"Averett did something!

Edit: Nvm"
"Averette giveth, Averette taketh."
Why the fuck do we have Avrett covering cooks? 😑
Someone has to gif Queen jumping on the pile
Queen looking extra and I like it!
"Me: How are we going to beat the Chiefs with this o-line and without Tavon

Also Me: -looks down and sees that Chargers are up on KC 17-6-"
"JJ Watt, again, is good at this football thing."
Ingram really just spin kicked that wall lmao
I can’t believe that worked LMFAOOOOO
LOL thought that was Lamar
NO LITTLE BOY
NASTY
This game has felt like just a fucking grinding slogfest. Can't believe we are up by as much as we are. That fumble return was huge
Did Ingram just karate kick the Texans logo?! Merciless.
OMG that play design was so fucking good too. Roman showing off.
"what blocking on that play, I will want to know what lamar did out there tbh"
The Force is with us.
"That TD took Watson soul, you could see it as soon as he seen the TD"
Lamar and Hollywood on the bench there is so fun to see.
Why did they kick?
time to run that clock out
Now that I feel comfortable that we will win I will give props to Justin Reid. He has been very strong for the texans in these first two games.
He definitely got it
The Gus Bus is in full service!
What did Blacklock do
Hey guys pro tip: stop going out of bounds
No idea why Gus and Ingram didn't just fall down in bounds.
Can’t wait for Ravens wired this week just to hear Ingram after the 4th down TD
Dobbins isn't human
"That was a stumble away from a touchdown

Dobbins' future is so bright man I am pumped"
I can’t tell if the Texans totally don’t give a shit anymore or that was a truly phenomenal run.
JK ain't kidding
Guys guys guys WE ARE SO LUCKY. What a team we have 😭
"Good win. Tavon Young injury sucks, but given what a bloodbath this sunday was I think we got off light."
"About Tavon Young:

>By video, worry for ACL injury. His day is done and maybe season. Too many of those today. 1 is too many. - @ProFootballDoc"
Sometimes I wish Lamar would run
I am scared for next week
We miss Yanda
"Everyone is downplaying how good Watson is. Dude is a great QB, he is gonna make some good plays against any defense"
"Go Ravens, fuck Pittsburgh!"
"Back up QB gives Steelers trouble

Steelers Fans : “Ben is back!!!”

How are people picking this team to win our division?"
"""NFL contractual obligations"".....  Let's GO RAVENS!."
Tavon exhibiting his all-glass body again
The fact he was able to walk is a good sign
Who’s Elizabeth? Patrick is the only Queen I know
This sub was moaning 90 seconds ago.  We're spoiled.
"Lamar is doing everything, the team need to WAKE UP!!!!"
Lamar almost made that work. Insane.
Something seems off
I kinda forgot what a fourth down felt like
Solid drive
"Gotta use these RB's more

Lamar can do it himself but he doesn't have to"
Still fucking got it
"Henry Cavill's like 40 and MBB is like 16, who TF did the casting for this movie? The age gap is absurd for siblings"
so that's how that feels....
Well its a good thing Watson didnt get sacked now
that's my QUUUUEEEEENNNNN
Patrick Queen ROTY no doubtttt!
Houston decided the Cleveland fake punt worked so well last week they thought they'd try their own dumb play in their own zone.
LMAOOOOOO
"Now, run the ball please."
Poor Nick. He almost gets there every time. Then somebody else scores the TD
Good to see Ricard getting involved
I was watching Ravens higlights from 2018 and Nick Boyle was one of the like 3 main players who are still on the roster
Ricard making it up for last week!
James Harrison fan duel commercial. Greatest thing I’ve seen all day
There is no fullback in the game that didn't start off in baltimore that would have made that catch
Imagine getting scored on by a defensive tackle
Damn guys this the season with the worst injury bug to the league. Half the niners are injured and Saquan Barkley had to be carried out the game with a knee injury. Damn I really like Barkley and his season might be over in week fucking 2
Any updates on Tavon?
Pass rush is fucking ass wtf
Pass rush needs an upgrade asap
Texans run a pretty similar offense to ours
That's ok.  Will get it back
Everybody calm down. Our shoutouts are fun but these dog fights make the game so much more exciting
Texans are playing a lot more physical imo
They always try to jinx Tucker smh
Let's have a stop here
Y’all. Chill out. We’re winning. It’s early. R-E-L-A-X
Humphreys right hook is legendary
Challenge?? That's a TD!
FRUIT PAWNCH!!!
It kinda looked like he scored there
my fantasy team would really love this to be a TD.  Thanks Tony!
I do not see how Fort was down
They’re going to rule that a TD
I don’t see where he went out of bounds
Lmao give LJ fort some offensive carries!
Fort looked scary af running that ball
to think the steelers didn't want Fort and his massive fucking biceps?
"Wow, Fort looked amazing. That scoop, the carry, the eye for blocking, the dive at the end. 

He must have played lots of offense in high school or something. Looked natural out there. 

Also, that was a TD."
I love overreacting at the slightest hindrance but also screaming my throat out at play like this. Being a ravens fan is so fun
See y’all? R-E-L-A-X
Little known fact.  LJ stands for Lyndon Johnson.
"don't get me wrong i'm always happy whenever we get a TD, but you just love to see a guy happy on the sideline. happy for you fort."
Fruit PUNCH!!
Take in we found out about LJ Fort at our joint practice with the eagles last year. He impressed and we stole him from their practice squad. Now he's absolutely balling
"“Justin Tucker with another kick. He’s getting tired!”

I love Kevin Harlan."
Thank GOD we finally woke up 💪🏾
My god what have we done!
GOOD SHIT PETERS LETS FUCK EM UP
God I fucking love our secondary
I almost yelled REEEEEEEEEDDDDDD!
"Holy shit 

These defense is scary"
I’m ready for RG3
LMFAO imagine taking jalen ramsey over marcus peters
This is the greatest day I’ve had since last Sunday
Fruit Punch and Juiceman
We are going to be getting some bandwagon fans this year aren't we? I haven't seen a Ravens team this good in fucking years.
Damn OBJ is getting manhandled
We need to get Yanda beefy again and get him suited up.
"WTF is happening with this line?  At least Stanley is walking it off but fuck man, Yanda’s absence is hurting us."
Please be okay Stanley 🙏🏻
"What is our o-line doing? 2nd last year, today we look like 2nd to last... Come on now"
What a bullshit call on Averett
Someone fire up the “bull shit” chant
How the fuck do they miss that hold on Judon jesus christ
Averet is horrible man
That was a bs call. Averett getting targeted
Those are some shitty penalties. How the heck can a receiver just bowl somebody over and get the flag...
Why did the fucking clock stop? What???
But they didn't have a t/o and didnt spike it?
"I’ll take a 20-10 lead on the road while getting the ball to start the 2nd half, but definitely had a couple missed opportunities. 

Shoulda scored off the Peters Pick, Oline needs to play way better, but overall a great first half"
"""non-traditonal quarterback play"". How traditional we talking because I'm sure Lamar is more throwback than most"
"The texans have turned the ball over 3x yet are only down 10. They held the ravens to 2 field goals and sacked them out of fg range for a third. 

This may sound weird but the texans' defense is actually doing a decent job while sticking to their game plan. Stop the run @ all costs, get the ravens to 3rd and long & hunt. 

Good thing our defense has been opportunistic & our offense hasn't turned the ball over. 

W/ all of that being said, the ravens could win this game going away if they get their ground game going. Tire out the texans' defensive front & this game is done."
"fuck yeah lets run with Gus More

*next play hit behind line of scrimmage*"
He didnt play that ball? Am i crazy?
Was that not PI? The defender wasn't looking for the ball
How was that not PI
Orlando Brown hardly even trying right now :(
So thankful we have tucker
How was there no PI on that throw to Marky Mark bruh
I like running that clock down. Let's keep doing that.
Damn man 4 sacks wowwww
"You know. I understand we are winning and everything.

But these refs need to call penalties correctly. If that was the texans that would be PI on us. Give us a break"
Chances we see Fluker next game?
We are good but I feel like this team needs a wake up call
Wilson looking like Pablo Escobar lol
Get Avrett some help.
Averett is so fucking bad
"I’ll say it again, Averrett needs to be OFF THE FIELD"
Stop letting them hang around
Wow. 4th Q already. Our first drive was amazing time killer. Now got to get them off the field on 3rd and long.
Hold em to 3 here and put em away next possession
Averet out there giving me sharese Wright flashbacks
Queen jumping on that pile was a real Ravens move. Love this kid
Hopefully we follow up with a nice long drive for a score to ice it
"Lmao who yelled ""oh my god""?"
Seeing Baby Yoda made me feel a little less anxious
I dont think Watt played in our game last year.  He has been the difference today
#MARK MOTHERFUCKING INGRAM
#BIG BOI NO LIL BOI
*tears* **thats my running back**
Hahaha that kick in the EZ haha
"BIG BALLS HARBAUGH
BIG TRUSS INGRAM  
WOO WOO
SIX POINTS"
Lol Hollywood trying to bully through two guys for 3 yards and a 1st down was kinda funny. Especially when Mark breaks a 30 yard TD right after it on 4th down.
"Only way I would have loved that more were if it were a direct snap to Ricard who then threw a TD pass to Lamar because why the fuck not, Lamar needs to add ""Not bad for a Wide Receiver"" to his resume."
BIGGGG BOIIII
I fucking love that creativity in the play calling
You say big truss you get a big upvote
I thought that was lamar lol
"We scored 30 on an off day, against a competent opponent. We aight"
Feel bad for Watson get my guy a real franchise...
Elliot is loads better than Earl at blitzing
Alright 99yd TD to Hollywood GO
Score again
"I don’t mean to alarm y’all, but the Chiefs just tied with the Chargers"
Good challenge. Low risk high reward. Even if he  doesn’t get it it’s just a QB sneak
Why did 90 get ejected?
Any have a gif of what got that texan ejected?
"Lamar, Humphrey, Peters, Ingram, Tuck, Queen, Andrews, Hollywood all killin it

But yo. It feels so good when our support guys are making monster plays. Fort obviously, but Gus bus making big moves, Snead has been a monster anytime the ball’s been near him, Boykin making some HUGE blocks, D line getting TONS of pressure. I love this team..."
Pass rush has been better in the 2nd half
Daaaamn JK!
“Rides him down like a rodeo cowboy” O_O
"Seriously not fucking fair to have Ingram, Gus, and JK(and Justice Hill)"
Next week’s game is going to make me drink heavily
"Well, a rookie threw for over 300 on this D. Hopefully Lamar can do the same."
No pass rush is going to be the death of this team.
You guys are honestly the worst sometimes. Holy shit.
T young is made of phone chargers
Not again Tavon :(
Good thing we have CB depth
"god damn... feels so bad for Tavon, hopefully he's good"
There's going to be sooooo many commercials
And the Sunday of a million injuries strikes Baltimore
[deleted]
Queen's got a motor on him.  Good.
Queen was a great pick up never gives up on the play
Run the fucking ball
Offensive line does NOT look good so far
"Even with the O-line woes and Tavon injury, we can all take some chicken soup for the soul and watch Tucker work his craft."
Where can I get that face cover that Harbaugh is wearing? Looks like the MD flag but with Ravens colors
Tucker still fucking has it
Offensive line needs help
53 won't hear the end of that
"Don't forget y'all, this is exactly how the game started last year. We won no contest 5 times over. Chill"
Ward is too big for that shit 😤
Hey only we can do that!
LMAO DUMBASS BILL OBRIAN
GREAT pressure those past 2 plays. Now turn this into a TD
Wallstreetbets
If they're going for it on 4th and 1 on their own 30 you know they're scared
Just remember last year when we played the texans we started slow
##yas queen
off topic but how the fuck did the cowboys win their game
WHAT AN AMAZING CATCH BY PROJECT PAT
I feel so much better now lmao
Okay be honest who had Picard picked for a TD
CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON
lol imagine giving up a receiving TD to a defensive lineman
What a catch by ricard. Wow.
And y’all were worried in the first half.. trust in Lamar
KC is getting beat by the chargers
Gonna need to answer those short TE passes over the middle.
"Our pass rushers, especially unblocked blitzers need to play with discipline in the backfield and stop blowing past Deshaun every time"
"I’m out of beer 

This is a tragedy"
"Ordered some DoorDash sushi - If I die, I die"
Where is JK?
Still fuckin got it!
Glad we're getting points but wish we could be turning those into TDs
#GOD I LOVE HUMPHREY!! THAT'S A TD
THE MARLO PUNCH IS BAAAACK
THAT WAS A TD WTF
MARLOOOOO
You know what im talking about to JuJu!!!
Marlo with the punch!!!
Thats a td
MARLON FUCK YEA BABY
Fruit punch baby!!
"That bounce off the fumble was perfect for Fort.

If this gets upheld the Ravens better make it count"
Marlon's punch is legendary
"Even if it’s not a score I think we can punch it in from the 1, hopefully with JK, cause I flexed him in fantasy lol"
Give that man his touchdown!
They're reviewing the turnover. Can they change it to a TD if they see it?
That’s a touchdown
"PAY LLAMA, PAY HUMPHREY, PAY STANLEY"
Our secondary is SCARYYYYYY Marlo with a big forced fumble
"The way Marlon punches the ball out so well reminds me of Peanut Tillman.

FBI Officer Tillman is currently a 2020 HoF nominee.

All hail King Marlon"
LJ Fort was such a good pick up
I was surprised the broadcasters weren't calling out that it was an obvious TD.
Linebacker unit is looking very solid
I like when Kevin Harlan does our game
Defense woke up! Just how I like it DIRTY!
MARCUS PETERS! LEGENDARY
Peters grew three feet on that dive
JUICEMAAAAAANNNNN!!!!!
My god this defense ya'll
JUICE JUICE JUICE
Defensive Play Of The Year right there
Holy shit I think Peters just pulled a micheal jordan and grew six feet for that pick
Dear lord what a catch
"But muh defense... 

You people are so impatient"
Has juiceman always been his name??
What a pick!!! Dudes a bonafide stud
Hope Tavon is ok. :/
We are almost too good of a team. everyone is going to start hating on us
The talent on this team is absolutely disgusting.
I’d like to apologize for my doubts when the game began
"I literally yelled ""OHHHHHH"" when Peters got that INT."
O Line might be the only negative this half so far.
"can watt

like

*not*"
Love how the FG target line CBS makes for Tucker is at like the 45 lmao
Stanley down noooooooo
Dobbins can’t block
Buying offensive line 10k west varrock bank
offensive line has room for improvement.
This is like worst o line performance I’ve seen since like 2017... they got 3 sacks on Lamar not even fucking Aaron Donald got a touch on Lamar last year
Shitty playcall considering how bad the line has been
Averett has not had a single positive play his time here
How many times can Judon fly into the backfield and whiff man
Thanks refs...
Wtf why did they give them extra time?
Refs are the best players on the Texans.
Houston clawing and scratching to just stay within 10
Suck a nut refs
Before that last drive I was just thinking how the refs have been pretty decent thus far this season. After that drive WHAT THE DAMN HELL REFS YOU PIECE OF SHIT
Officials kinda lost the handle over that last minute.
offensive is a bit shaky. Defense are killing it
Offensive play calling is absolutely embarrassing. When did we bring Marty back?
i know you guys think we need to win this game by 50 but i just want to avoid the injury gods at play today. i will consider that a win.
pollard acting like a clown on twitter again to no one's surprise
We’re playing okay considering everything. O line needs to step the fuck up no more sacks
should we rotate Fluker in at RG?
"I'm just gonna say we still adjusting to lack of pre season & fans. I mean these 10pts don't feel great to up by, but its not like we down 8pts to a rookie qb right now😏"
We scored 20 points on a playoff team in their stadium. We're doing more than fine
"the ravens: put in a run 

this sub: i pretend i do not see it and continue to complain about throws."
Just had flashbacks of Ray Rice.  Dobbins is money 💰
Ahh you got me short of the first. JK
Long ass drive
Shouldn't the defender have turned for the ball?
Awful O-line man smh
That was a close one there Tuck
still fuckin got it
I wish this game was more like our last matchup
This O-Line needs to get their shit together quick
Didn’t realize we were playing SF’s all-world D-line today. Embarrassing.
this OL play is pathetic
"This O Line... smdh.

What was that, sack number 4?? 

Need to get that shit straight."
Oline was shit week 1 also....They had terrible grades 🤦🏼‍♂️
Queen is fast as hell
Don't even bring 23 home with us. God awful.
Of course it was on Averett. How the fuck is this guy still on the team
plz get averett outta here
Averrett getting absolutely demolished here.
Patrick leaping on the pile lmao
"Look I get being homers, but the fact that a lot of people can't respect what Watson does is kinda sad. He's playing a great game so far. They better not win or I'll probably join the blind homerist discussion, but at least give respect where respect is due."
Averett has singlehandedly put bend don’t break back on the menu.
Need to put the nail in the coffin on this drive TD and games over
Not sure why you’d go for 3 here
Alright same drive as the last one and let's go home and get ready for KC
Deshaun looks sad lol
I just creamed my pants
What a fucking play call
WATCHING IN MY HOTEL ROOM ON STUPID GAMECAST AND HOLY TITS IM HYPED
"I love that we went for it on 4th there, great call and great execution!"
Ok low key was like wtf is this wildcat...I’ll sit down
2/2 on 4th down conversions.
i can't wait for ingram's post game at the mic
"Watson's having a decent game today, will give him that."
Do we have any update on Tavon? Haven’t heard anything from announcers
THA J O K E R
I truly do not understand how some analysts had Deshaun Watson rated above Lamar going into this season
Good challenge.
"Good challenge here. Don't get it, we can go for it on 4th and we burn a time out (Which we may not need). Get it and it's a 1st."
Challange it man he stretched out it should be good
Go for it. All aboard the Gus Bus.
#BLEED THE CLOCK
All aboard the Gus bus
gus Edwards is the rg3 of the rbs lol. show up to close it out
Gus is a starting RB
GUS BUS LETS GO
Theeeeeee wheels on the bus go MOVE BITCH
Why did this guy get DQ'd?
Stop running out of bounds
That's like 80 seconds that should be off the clock Roman fucked up
"The two sweeps were really crap calls. Regardless, points are points. GG Houston!"
Why did that player get ejected? I didn’t catch it
The shots of the Texans sideline makes them all look depressed
DOBBY!!!
DOBBINS!!!
JK just ripping off 40 yard run like it’s nothing!!!!
"Man I wish he’d of scored on that, would of made flexing him worth it"
“Rides him down like a rodeo cowboy”.... wat
"I almost feel bad for the Texans. After getting pounded by Ingram and Edwards, Dobbins comes in and absolutely gashes them."
YABBA DABBA DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can we talk about half time adjustments both weeks so far? Especially the Oline this week. RBs have had great vision but Oline just blasting holes
2-0! Bring on the Chiefs
No lie the LA stadium looks amazeballs
Ok. That dude kicked three 58 yd field goals. Two in a row after an ice timeout.
Sometime my inner masochist wants tucker to kick my balls. His amazing leg caressing my scrotum would truly be sensational
People are acting like the Texans are a bad team. They were literally up by like 21 or something against the Superbowl champions in the playoffs last year. This game isn’t going to be like last week.
with this o-line the Steelers might have a fucking field day with us gah damn
CBS production has been very poor today
"This sub is spoiled as hell tho. Why the hell are some of y’all complaining when we’re up 10 and getting the ball to start the 2nd half on the road? 

I’ll take this shit every week!"
This subs annoying if we aren't crushing the other team
"What the FUCK is our offensive line doing? They're traffic cones right now for the Texans. And oh boy, Stanley might be injured again. Just great. Here comes another game where Lamar has to do literally everything for the offense."
Talk about keeping a team in it at the end of the half
Refs gave them 3 points
Texans are such pussies for taking a FG. Although i guess it was fourth and 15.
Oh I see. The Chiefs are clearly going to win lol
CBS needs to hurry and put this game on lol
Damn Judon almost had him
"I'M FUCKING DONE WITH TAVON, LETS DRAFT SLOT CB"
A sight all too familiar to us flock:Tavon young making a great defensive play and then limping off the field.
"The number of big names going down to injury today has me quite concerned for our boys, and even more so now."
They should ban turf!
Please fucking run
what are they cheering about? a helmet to helmet hit? lol
Today is fucked I’ll die if Lamar gets hurt
Lamar showing elite composure rn
"I get that the Texans are running 8-man boxes all day, but do we only have one rush from an RB so far?"
I miss Yanda
Playcalling reminds me of the bills game. Too much trickery. I guess we're putting it on tape for the chiefs but... w/e
Both O lines look terrible. Dshaun must be use to by now
"Dang, nice moves Watson"
Big props to Ward for letting that sack go and avoiding the horsecollar - had both hands inside the jersey at the neckline
Good gracious what a freaking escape by Watson
Already in fg Range sick
Let’s go! Joker SZN
Tells you what they think of their chances today that they’d go for that.
GOOD SHIT ELLIOT
Lol. Bill O'Brien is fucking stupid
At least the Texans failed on that 4th and 1
Hell yeah!
"man , my stream is sloow"
Let’s get ittttt
Lamar really making project pat work for that td lol. Great play though
Pat looked like he's made of rubber
Is is me or did Joker just play that like E dub and force Watson to call timeout
"Wait, there’s no crowd noise? Then where is all that cheering coming from???"
Damn it.  I hate when they get first downs
"Wow that was sloppy, no pressure and left WIDE open"
Pass rush is garbage when just 4
We need pash rush right now.
Who's fault was that on the deep pass. Elliott?
That's fine. Respond right back
Wheres the pass rush?
I hope the downers here realize in the game of football both teams usually give up a touchdown or two a game. Not every game is gonna be 45-6 calm down everyone
Fuck off Baker we don’t care about your book club
Lamar looks unbelievably calm out there. Amazing how he continues to get better.
I hope we invest in the online next year. Hate seeing LJ run for his life.
Sam Koch can secretly throw. Tucker can secretly catch. I think we found our next QB/WR duo
Mr. Automatic!!
We aren't sneaking up on anyone. Texans are facing 0-2 and they're ready for us.
How perfect is it to have a Fort on Defense?
No fucking way this team is incredible
"Damn, thought he was in lol. Glad we got that all the same"
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT D!!!! LJ FORT!!! MARLON!!!
That's a TD.
LJ taking over the game!
I love Marlo
Marlooooooo!!!
This game is about to get ugly. Can’t help but feel terrible for Deshaun. He deserves so much better
Fruit punch!!!!!
"Pay peanut, holy fuck. What a play by Fort. They’re gonna show that all week."
"Yeah, that's going to be a TD."
Definitely a tuddy. Awesome stuff. Pretty sure Judon got blocked in the back on the rush too
Tuddy all day 📈📈📈
Goddamn. The defense does *not* look sluggish.
TD confirmed!
I love Marlon
Lamar Jackson Fort
Dang Harrison is FAST
WHAT A PICK
I’m gonna nut
#GOD I LOVE OUR CORNERS
WE FEASTING TODAY BOIS
BALLHAWKIN PETERS WOW
#MP JUICEMANNNNNNN
After a slow start... RAVENS ARE BACK BABY! MP Juiceman in the house baby
Marcus F'n Peters!
Dude should be a WR lol
Let’s fucking go Marcus Peters!!!!
**Juiceman!**
Defense rolling now
About to be back to back years of having two all pro corners
HOLEEEEE FUCKKK WHAT AN INT.
Deshaun looks scared against our D just like last year
MP Juuuuuuiiiiceman!
HELL YEAH D
YALL HAVE NO FAITH
"I’m so fucking glad we’ve got peters, for a 5TH rounder"
"MP JUICE MAN! they thought it was sweet, but it was really sour!"
This is a championship type defense. Turnovers are strongly correlated to Super Bowl runs.
Ravens MVP Kaare Vedvik
Dear god. I remember like 6 seasons where we didn’t have a single WIDE RECEIVER that could make that catch
Lamar just felt bad that Watt hasn't had many sacks lately and wanted him to feel good. Good guy Lamar man.
How much farther back is Tuck’s FG target line than other teams?
Weirdly poor pocket presence there from Lamar. Had an opening to his right but twirled into that sack.
Ronnie stanley is hurt
Yanda come back
Ronnie pls
Online is awful today
Lamar having Louisville flashbacks with this O line play today
Anthony Averett is def our worst corner
Why does it take literally our entire defense plus a couple camera guys to tackle Watson?
Averett needs to be off the field right now
Lmao fucking bullshit call
Omg these calls
That OL is not ideal
Soft as shit call
Levine & Averrett having shit games.
Fucking home job
Jesus christ Averett is piss poor per the usual. Is their no free agent or practice squander out there?
Seeing Averett out there is giving me flashbacks to last years Browns loss. God he is awful. We need Tavon back.
What the fuck is that call????????
What in the world
"I’d rather have Canady than Averrtt, he’s just horrible"
What the everloving shit is going on with the refs on this drive?
"I think we're a bit spoiled. It's the NFL, we're not going to dominate literally every play/drive of the game. We're up 10 at the half, KC is down 8. We are an elite team, but we aren't perfect. Let's not lose sight of that."
Refs fucking called shit illegal contact then stop the clock .
Not getting points off of that turnover is rough
Either flag us or keep the clock running wtf is a 4 second add?
I’m mad but I’m also just plain confused. Wtf rule are the refs invoking here?
blatant hold on Judon right after the wiped sack
Can someone get the oline motivated? Can we make some running lanes and get these backs going strong!
We seem off. Offensive game plan seems off. Without the Def TD it would look a lot different at half. Hope we can adjust at half and settle some. These guys don't look like they can play with our guys. We should run them out of the place.
We get the ball after the half. Just have to settle in more. We know we have the talent.
joe flacco > kirk cousins
If they're so disappointed in the run game how about running the ball more lol
Boykin  is much improved
Harbaugh sucking on his mask looks so weird lol
Is Dobbins hurt? Is he active?
“Exciting even when he gains one yard”
"When I drink stout, we play questionably. When i drink tequila, we play consistent as fuck. I know what I must do, boys"
teams are doing a better job of closing off the amount of space Lamar has to work with
Oh you thought he was down? JK!
Wow what a play.  Shades of Ray Rice vs Cinci years.ago
how was that not pass interference?
PI?
4 sacks today?  O line butt today
Yo o line is straight trash
Roman needs to run some screens
Tucker out here doing trick shots on his FGs now
23-7 sounds a lot better than 23-10.
Really need to rally that OL during this defensive series
Taking a second to to admire Tucker.  That FG was beautiful. Close but most would not have made it.
They are abusing Tyree and Brown whew
Ravens should have swallowed their pride and brought back Osemele. Oh well.
If this stream drops audio one more time I’m going to report it.
Everyone bitch in about this team even the play calling is fine we are not KC down 11 to a fucking rookie
Watson is a tough mf to bring down
Nanny McPhee seems to always be getting in the backfield today. Still goin strong
OMG Averett is garbage.... how do you give that up!?!?
AVERETT is literally so fucking bad. Please cut his ass and start tucker.
Picking on Averett bad.
Averatt is just getting demoralised
Averette is ASS
Yeah get Averett off the fucking field
"avarett is not good, i agree. you just have to feel bad for the guy though. will be picked on all game ever since both marlon and MP caused turnovers."
Averett consistently gets beat 🤦‍♂️
Damn what a throw Watson
oh fuck off Trent Green.
"Lol @ PQ leaping on top of everyone else

""This is MY pile!"""
They fucking dogpiled him LMAO
It looks like we put in Jimmy for Marlon and gave Marlon slot duty back while Young is out
"Averett is showing why he's the 4th option. 
It's not that he sucks, it's just that he's not a one-half and two option on a starting defense."
This drive has felt like forever
ohhhh my gawd
Now let's just grind the hell out of them for 10 minutes and end this with a TD
Mando!
Not sure why but I've got respect for JJ.  His brother (although good) seems like a dirty player.
"Watt has played really well, credit where it's due."
BIG TRUZZZZZZ
BIG BOI NO LITTLE BOI
INGRAM
THAT'S HOW YOU 4TH DOWN IT BABY!!!
GOD I LOVE THIS TEAM SO MUCH
With the roundhouse kick lmao
"ERRYBODY GET IN HERE, WE DID A RUN BLOCK!!!!!!!"
Kick that fucking bull! Let’s fucking go
So everything’s back to fine again 😂
Dis that dirty biiird gameplay I was promised.
Someone link the replay....   Plz.
[Harbaugh balls for calling a play like that.](https://i.imgur.com/U1x9Jko.jpg)
That was some tomfoolery play and I live for it.
"Dang, so many big name injuries today"
Why do I feel like 17 points still ain't enough? Must be that Cowboys/Falcons game from earlier. (Plus I'll never count out Watson.)
Lmao @ Hollywood dancing menacingly towards David Johnson
A Lamar TD pass to Hollywood to end this game would be absolutely pizza pie for me
JOKERRRRRR
he's the Jokaa Baybeee!
DeShaun gonna make some money he keeps this up.
WARM UP THE BUS
Here comes the passrush
Time to feed those running backs
Unpopular opinion: We extend Ingram for 2 years.
". . . lamar throws a somewhat wobbly pass for a touchdown and lamar gets roasted, and mahomes finally ties the chargers and he gets ""wow just wow"""
20-3 career start? Not bad for a running back
KC is scary. But at the end of the day is just about getting to the playoffs and being hot at that time.
Texans damn lucky. That was an inch from being a touchdown.
Jeez I forgot we play KC next week. Huge game
"Yeah challenge the spot, he reached that fd"
I like this challenge. Looked close and we can just use it as a timeout to figure out things anyhow
Assert dominance. Go for it and go long to Hollywood.
Thats how you do it.
The fake fake
big dick harbs
Gus is a gamer
Gus could legit be a #1 on a bunch of teams
"This is why you pound the rock. They know its coming and can’t stop it, easier for oline to runblock than pass block too. Gus has earned more touches"
Lightning McQueen leading the team in tackles again! LOVING this guy
"Please explain, why is this player disqualified?  I don't understand.  TY"
"TICKETS PLEASE.


 The bus will be departing soon."
Replay of foul?
Anybody know what just happened?
I want Harbaugh's neck gaiter.
Why do they keep running to the sideline? Cmon.
Can't believe we didn't throw once on that drive.
I hope the people saying go for it aren’t serious
Super Bowl Confirmed?
Thank god for that graphic I would’ve never known that guy won MVP
The ravens have generated 22 pressures today
DOBBINS YESSS
JK
Run of the day!!
"Dobbins: Drop the taco judon, get in the freaking bus"
DOBBINS!!
Next week is gonna be a crazy game
Texans have no heart left. They do t give a fuck lol
I want a Lamar touchdown
"Oof, if KC loses to LA, they're coming here fired up lol."
"Ooo I’m so hyped for next week 

LETS GOOOOOOIOOO!"
Here we go with the refs...
Dobbins needs to learn how to block
Play calling seems to be a lil too cute right now.
I don't like these play calls. Things feel very conservative right now.
Hollywood be frying niggas man lol. Butt ass. Ass naked out there
Who the hell just said Marlon needs to wake up the d with a big play? Damn sorcery
"O line needs to step up, but not as much as the officiating does. I don’t know how you miss the TD live when it’s right in front of you, and then the 2 illegal contact calls and the absurd pause to give the Texans enough time to kick a FG is just inexcusable shit. This crew shouldn’t get another game this season."
Anyone concerned about the score is a 2019 era new Ravens fan
O line is officially the weak link of team
r/TexasCuckoldCommunity
some of you became fans of the ravens last season and it shows.
"I’m not sure where all of the chastising is coming from. These gameday threads are literally all just hot takes. It’s what you came here for, and it’s just the nature of these threads. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
it’s kind of depressing without crowd noise
Defense was pathetic that drive
"ravens 20

texans 7

refs 3"
"Averett, Shareece Wright, Chykie Brown, Maurice Canady, and Dominique Franks are the same “give up a 10+ yard catch on 3rd down” corner, change my view"
Let’s Fuckin Feast!!!
Broncos keeping it close 👀
"LOL, Denver is really pushing the Squealers."
"Looking at all the injuries this week, I hope our Ravens will be safe"
You had one job Denver :(
Thank god we play the giants at home. MetLife field  is ending everybody’s season
jimmy gets by with a lil help from his friends <3
Good shit Jimmy
Great 1-on-1 stop by Jimmy
"Good start, let's get it"
I swear the biggest cheat code for our offense is 5 wide but we barely ever do it smh
I love how long NFL commercial breaks are
Is Tavon Young made of glass
Wow well its our turn i guess what a terrible day for injuries man
Looks like he came down on that left leg and the knee just flexed out to the side.  No bueno.
"He was limping off, I bet he's ok"
Someone spiked the NFL’s Gatorade stash with bone hurting juice apparently
Young is made of glass
Could be ok. Fingers crossed
Yaaaas queen
Queen is gonna be a BEAST
Fuck I thought the ball was out but it was just Johnson's red shoes
How many times am I gonna have to watch mahomes play cornhole smh
Run the fucking ball
Lol run plz?
"Does Lamar's balls look zippier today to anyone else?  Like last year they looked solid, but today the just shoot out."
Apparently everyone in here thinks they would be a better OC than Roman
The Oline doesn’t exist today
I miss Yanda
Yanda plz comeback
What the fuck is our O-line doing right now? The Texans are using them like turnstiles
Why do teams still use Turf. Jesus
Can Lamar not hit the hard ass fake field with his throwing hand? Cool thanks.
The Texans are playing great defense.
"On 3rd & 7, why do we have 3 players running routes underneath the sticks?"
Texans are playing well. Don't forget there's another team on the field. We looked good enough
What’s up with the fans on here making crazy takes after 2 drives? Same thing happened last week but for the defense.
Damn everyone in here's a better play caller than Greg Roman I guess from the sound of it
that was impressive by Watson to break free from Ward
Ward just got daddied
Jesus what a hell of an escape.
Earl Who?
Fantastic fucking stand
Holy fuck what a terrible decision
"It pumps me up that our offense is so good teams have to take shots like that 4th and 1, and our defense is tough enough to shut it all down"
Lmaooo that was a ballsy move
JOOOOOKER
Opposing teams feel the need.to be aggressive with us.  Just like the Ravens when we played KC.  I don't blame them going for it.  Risky but it has to be done against high scoring teams.
"great clean stop

we got to punish these stupid decisions, let's get 7"
"If we don’t get 7 off this, imma be pissed"
"So, our offense is so freaking scary teams are running bad 4th downs in the hope they keep us off the field. Feels damn good."
Fuck yes
THAT'S MY BLOCKING TIGHT END FIGHTING
pat Ricard what a unit
BIG BOIS GOTTA EAT what a play by Ricard
What a snag
PROJECT PAT
Great catch
Pat really redeemed him self from last week there.
_My erection enters the chat_
Going for it on 4th in your own territory is a bold move against this offense
Awesome catch by Ricard but poor Boyle can never get in the endzone
"CAPTAIN RICARD, MADE IT SO"
Hopefully Tavon can come back this year
CMON JIMMY
Fuck that was a nice catch by Ricard!
yasss it's Lamar
Seahawks gonna bring Cam back to reality tonight I think
That's a big yikes
That’s on Elliot
Smhhh
I never understood why some underestimate Deshaun.  He's one of the best QBs in the league.
DUUUUV
Ingram heard y’all talking shit
Put Tucker out there in the slot
Going from Joe to Lamar feels illegal
"Holy shit, Romeo Crennel still exists!"
i love this belichick commercial lolll
Feel like he couldve picked up the first
"Clean game so far. No penalties, no turnovers, no sacks? Or pretty close to none.

Any turnover is gonna be big."
D needs to step up. No pressure at all
I swear i saw someone comment that we need marlon to force a fumble literally a few minutes ago
WHO NEEDS A NATIONAL GAME WHEN YOU GET KEVIN HARLAN
How is that not a TD?!??
That’s 6 come on!
HUMPH WITH HIS FINISHING MOVE
UNDER REVIEW????
LETS GOOOOOOO. AWESOME
That’s a TD
I really need Harbaugh to challenge this for my fantasy
Bro imagine thinking you’re gonna beat the Ravens while giving up defensive touchdowns 🤣
Let's go Marlo!!!!
Thats a td boys
Humphrey graduated from the peanut Tillman school for DBs in case anyone was wondering. Head of his class too.
Pay marlon!
All Pro Marlo 💜
FUMBLE TD!
Marlon ‘Hammer Fist’ Humphreys
Goddamn that was an effort at the very limits of human capability for Fort to get that in there.  Amazing!
Tucker practicing his bending techniques on these kicks
"Mega hustle from Fort!

All right defense, don't let up! Should be well rested after all the TV breaks and reviews."
ya know arizona looks great this year.
Queen in coverage over a wr??
MP!!!!!
Interception!!
FULLY ERECT
This Team is fucking good
HOLY FUCK PETERS 🔥
Marcus fucking Peters
JUICEMAN 🥤
WHAT A FUCKING PLAY
MP JUICEMAN!!!!!!!
I love MP Juiceman
HOLY FUCK WHAT A FUCKING PICK
MP GRAPE JUICE MAN
OOF
Oh my word
OUR DEFENSE IS HUNGRY!!!!!
JUICE
MPJuiceman looking like Ed Reed
What a game so far after that slow start
JUICEMAN
Our elite corners showing out today
So what EDGE we trading for?
"TD, halftime, TD, game"
Now it’s time to step on their throats and end this before the half. Let’s go boys
"Let's gooooooo.

Chance here to pull a Belichick Special. Double-dip before end of half and we start the 3rd with the ball."
"MP ditched his man in the flat and double backed for the snag. Such a sneaky fuck, love it."
Holy crap that int was fucking beautiful
Peters took a page out of Ed Reeds book with that int
Watt is destroying OBJ
I want you all to just take a moment to appreciate this special roster of guys we have right now. Don’t take it for granted.
I miss Yanda :(
Not today Watt any other day is fine...
Not Stanley 😱
Online playing like total dog shit today.
oh fuck oh fuck not stanley please
Averett is a bum.
Are you fucking kidding me?!
Queen is an absolute beast
Averett is such a fucking liabilty
Fucking Averett you know he’s going to the sideline
LOL WUT
WTF Averrett is allowed his field what a joke
"Fucking dammit, you can't let deshaun do that."
Having not seen Averette for awhile I completely forgot how TRASH he is
Wtf just happened
Houston a bunch of pussies
Not worried. Couple of gifts from the refs there.
Lol that’s bullshit.
"That one weak, and simply wrong, illegal contact call on the sack made the whole drive happen, but that doesn't excuse every other play. That was awful"
Refs were dogshit down the stretch. That illegal contact on the sack was soft as fuck.
This Texans team is so trash. We're keeping them in the game. God it must suck to be a fan in Houston
That was legit. You can't delay the game because the ref fucks up. Same thing as moving the chains. If they aren't set the refs can pause the game because *they* fucked up. Not the other team
Dear God I hope uncle Eric is on the phone calling someone to play corner next week.
"I’m still really confused why the refs gave them a free timeout, not suspicious at all"
We're up 10 but only have 5 rushes by rbs. I understand letting the defense pick their poison but you can't just allow them to get us out of our game.
"Hey Greg, think you're gonna run it more than 5 times in the second half?"
Pass protection has been crap.  Need to run some draws/screens or roll Lamar out to slow them down
Did Dobbins get a single snap in that half
"Once again, the coaches are forgetting that the Ravens are a run-first team..."
"Anyone else want to see some more 2 TE sets and JK Dobbins in the 2nd half?

We need to slow this pass rush down"
Also our D-line has gotten pretty good pressure but Watson’s athleticism is phenomenal
Don’t know why a lot of you are angry . Deshaun is going to make plays he’s arguably a top 5 guy and we’re so lucky D hop ain’t playing with the Texans anymore. Texans are bound to make more bone headed TOs and bad plays we got this Guys.
It’s never worth to return kickoffs anymore because all of the flags and the small likelihood of actually getting past the 25
Maybe the Gus Bus is like the Texans kryptonite
"Ah yes, the Ol' Akron Pros"
Dobbins staying up after that contact was amazing.
"Dobbins: aw jeez looks like you got me 

JK"
That was Ray Rice like holy shit
Jk ray rice
Good read and play switch by Lamar
Dobbins good.
Wow. That’s was Ray Rice chills man spooky
Obvious PI.  Dude could be kissing Mandrews.
How was that good coverage?
Excuse me I forgot. What does an o-line do?
"Scaring me there, Tuck."
That was SNUCK in there damn
thank god we have tucker
almost had to burn down a village there for a second
Llama gonna need some ice packs after this game
Ok wtf is going on with our o line
"God won't allow Tuck to miss, i swear."
Missing Yanda so bad
This IOL man.
Dude. If our line is this bad -- CALL DIFFERENT ROUTES. Spread them 5 wide. Call a screen. Do literally ANYTHING different. Jesus.
I would really like Fluker to start at guard for now. He wouldn't get bullied in the run game.
Well it's a good thing he overthrew that lol
Wink bout to send some heavy pressure on the right side
I do think we see Fluker at RG next week but ya'll saying Brown Jr. Looks bad and Yanda made him good have apperantly forgotten who hes going against damn near every play. Id like to see a Tackle playing next to a rookie guard that doesnt get eaten alive by JJ Watt
Even with that sack Watson looks like he’s covered in oil lmao
why is Averett on the field
FUCKING AVERETT
Averett cant keep up
What a fucking throw by Watson
"Cut Averett, he’s always the culprit"
Averett needs to be cut
Picking on Averett alllllll day
Averett sucks
Can't let them get more than a FG here with the amount of penalties and TFL we have had. Let's shut it down.
Avarett is already playing garbage time.
Please bench averett asap
Line is starting to get pressure.
"Queen be like, ""I want the tackle too!"""
we need tavon back man
"Yeah, we do not have to do this Averett experiment. Just play Jimmy."
i miss lamar </3
Man I hope we can pound the rock and burn some clock on this next possession
I love wink's scheming. Fuckin 8 defenders on the LOS.
We need to put the Texans away now. This is the way.
"Lol, people are still roasting Averette 😂"
Herbert has 3 more completions than Mahomes and 125 more yards
Cactus Jack sent me
"It's early but our OL just doesn't look the same in the run game. Yanda retiring & skura not being 100% are 2 reasons why. Both opposing defenses have sold out to stop the run as well.

As the new OL builds cohesion, i think they'll start to dominate on the ground again."
Did Lamar just reverse Summersault
**Snead has the need for Speed**
"I really like Snead IV.  He shows up every game for something, and that was a tough-ass run after catch."
Murray runs so weird
Kyler Murray has me worried if we meet them in the SB. He's so much better this year
"The best part about Lamar is how much he just loves the game and everyone included, breaks two tackles falls over the guys, gets up helps them up and hugs both of the texans players"
This just in. Lamar Jackson sandbagging so that he could play a full football game
INGRAMMM
HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
So much for eating clock but fuck it LETS GOOOOOOOO
Not bad for a RB
He just Cobra Kai'd their logo.  Dayam.
HELL YEAH COACH LET'S GO FOR IT
CANT HANG. THATS FUCKING BALTIMORE FOOTBALL RIGHT THERE
Ingram was so hyped 😂
THAT’S how you do a 4th and 1
ROUNDHOUSE
😂😂😂 He busted roundhouse kick!
WE SOME KIND OF 1920S FOOTBALL SQUAD?
Absolutely amazing blocking should be game LFG
"INGRAM I LOVE YOU

Roman and Harbaugh, what a play call, hats off!"
BIG BOI RUN
The hays in the barn!
We own this bitch
"For all the problems with the O-line, we’re still firing on all cylinders, and beating these Mfer’s handidly."
I love this team!
I am suddenly a wildcat fan. But only for one play
"Just when you thought this offense has done it all, 4th down wildcat for 30+ you have got to be kidding"
"let's get a 3 and out, we can basically end the game."
[deleted]
Lets gooooo D
When Deshaun has time he is absolutely surgical
Calais there showing why he is great.
Elliott has been playing great! Safeties have been refreshingly good these last two games
STOP TURTLING D
Yeah we can't play like there's 2 min left
The pressure today hasn't been bad honestly.
Geeeeeez Elliot
JOKER
Is Watson blind lol. I don't think it could've been more obvious that we were sending the house
Please eat the clock
Not to be greedy but another Lamar TD would really save my fantasy team
Gotta tighten up that coverage and pass block a bit better for KC next week. Other than that solid display of football for us.
"Down by 17:

&#x200B;

KICK A FIELD GOAL"
how are you *not* going to go for this?
How the fuck do they not show a replay? That’s absurd CBS.
That was a crazy play call
lmao i'm so glad we want to demoralize them and go for it
that scheduling does suck for houston. i agree.
Hope Houston destroys the steelers next week
Now we are just demoralizing them
Gus looks incredible right now.
"Chargers about to score a TD

They on the 3"
Damn Gus is the closer
Gus Bus is so good
"Having Gus is almost dirty, we run Ingram and Dobbins all game. Then we send in Gus against a completely wore defense."
Did anyone even see what got 90 ejected?
235-105 on the road 😳
Cunningham has a done a good job containing Lamar. Credit where it’s due.
Running out of bounds on back to back plays.. not smart football
lamar TD here pls
in the least weird way possible deshaun watson has got some smooth skin.
Kick the fg go up 3 and let's roll it out
"If we score another td, I'm gonna be 1 point off on the lucky guess thread. That's gonna suck."
It’s crazy to think about how we haven’t lost a single game since the browns week 3... might change next week but a 15 game winning streak is insane
I love Kevin Harlan
JK Dobbins is electric!
"GET HIM DOWN

LMAOOOOO"
Yo that’s gotta be demoralizing as fuck
DOBBINS
These little flashes of JK's ability makes me hyped for how he is going to develop in this offense
Ravens have 223 rush yards. Texans held up until the 4th and then boom
We almost have 4 guys with 50yrds rushing. Wonder if thats ever happened before?
Mahomes just picked up 3rd & 20 on a RUN wtf
"Oh god, here comes the Pat Mahomes comeback"
"Settle for a tie, cowards"
"Fuck the chargers 

We’re gonna do it by ourselves"
Lamar 37 for 46 398 5tds

Our O Like is playing like shit but Lamar is so good that he’s only been sacked once
"whew i feel so much better after we didn't score a touchdown on 100% of our possessions.

lol y'all need to chill."
Is Watson covered in oil?
"The Texans player placed the ball, and then the ref kicked it backwards. I guess that means they get a free timeout to get a FG."
Meh. 10 up at the half. I'll take it
"Our O-line couldn't block a light breeze today, let alone a D-Line led by JJ Watt. What the fuck are they doing?"
GET AVARETT OUT FFS
Bro fuck this announcer saying that was a penalty but the shit on Andrews wasn’t.
God Mahomes is going to fucking expose Averett
Niggas keep trying to tell me Edwards is just a product on the offense.. dude is good
"Probably the most ""human"" I've ever seen Lamar play"
This was the weirdest blow out ever we had to try hard for it. A lot of the other ones felt effortless
The Hay is in the barn!
I know our play calling has been questionable and the o-line sucks today but shit are we spoiled with so many people complaining about not blowing out a good team
The other team is still allowed to score guys...
"Fuck this call it a tie and try again next week 

Save the knees"
Tavon can sneeze and get hurt
18 games in 4 seasons for Tavon if he's out for the season.
"Literally the same start as the Browns game. Go up 10-0, have a shitty defensive possession

Tell me what’s next?"
This offensive line is so bad
Play fluker and mekari
We need to put a big hit on Watson. We’ve allowed him too much time and space to build confidence
"Kinda feel bad for the Texans right?  Schedule hard af.  KC, us, then Pittsburgh next week.  Damn"
"Not surprising they picked up that 3rd and long on Averett, get him off the god damn field"
30 to 13 but I feel like we've been playing pretty bad idk lol
"Steelers have a lot of game left, the TV will cut to our game at the start, won't they?"
Steelers really blowing this shit lmao
Broncos fucking suck
"Well, if there’s anything we learned, it’s that the Steelers defense is overrated"
"Something bad teams have in common: Not blocking obvious free rushers, haha."
Steelers almost lost to the Jeff driskel Broncos. Spooky
Hope Ingram goes off today
"Strap yourselves in, here we go."
Kevin Harlan let's gooo
Campbell just reached out and grabbed that runner.  Otherwise he was going at least several more yards.
"lol way to hold em Jimmy.

Jimmy say “Heeelp!!!”"
Always hated jets sweeps
Levine is just the best
"Ahh, Lamar should've probably tried that 5050 ball down the field on the right hand side."
They’re clearly scared of Watt disrupting the rushing offense
Welp there it is
Tavon looks like he’s in a lot of pain
NO TAVON
FFS we were just talking about avoiding injuries. Thankfully he seems to be ok
"Goddamnit, who put knee-breaking shit in all the fields this week?"
Tavon pls no be hurt
Meanwhile LMFAO Falcons. They are the biggest choke artists in the NFL.
Walk it off young one
I had a bad feeling the rampant injury bug that’s been hitting the league would bite us today :(
"Fucking week 2

*edit: i mean the amount of injuries around the NFL has been rough this week"
It'll buff out.
Anthony Averrett....
YAS QUEEN
Queen with the hustle
Why aren’t we even trying to run the ball?
Oline looks like ass
This o-line play is terrible
Rip tavon
At least he can walk that’s good
Hollywood could have blocked watt and was like lol no
All these injuries today has me fucking spooked for the Lamar running game
Maybe our front office will dial up some trades or something for the O-line on the level of how they re-tooled the defense mid-season last year.
We had a slow start to the Texans last year and still put up 41
Always said  O line is overrated. The reason why teams don’t get sacks on the ravens is because of Lamar
Let the Ravens gain momentum. They're just powering up
"We have 3 stellar RBs, for sure dont hand the ball off once in a quarter."
Let Lamar get a feel for what they are doing and he will adjust a bit
Okay that was impressive
"That's it, I'm getting a beer."
This is going to be a VERY fun game. Battle of crazy athletic QBs
*evade 100*
"Deshaun ""Lamar Jackson"" Watson"
That was honestly best case scenario because it could have easily turned into a horse collar.
"come on, don't be shy, slander the ravens defense some more."
Can’t give the ravens offense great field position. Getting a TD here would be huge
why do teams always try dumb ass 4th down attempts on us? hilarious
Hell yea boys. Let’s get 7.
Watson loving the jump pass
BoB is such a dunce
FUCKING HUUUUUUUUUUUGE
HELL YES DEFENSE
how idiotic lmao
That was not a good decision. Two weeks in a row teams getting too cute on us.
This game is already waaay better than the Denver Pittsburgh game.
Front 7 looks light years better
We just got the ball within Justin Tucker field goal range
It was actually a good thing that no one wanted to tackle Watson on that play
"Man, with all the speed on this offense, Boyle looks sooooo slow"
YOU OWED US THAT RICARD
"Feel better now, boys?"
Ricard!Oh yea!!
Lamar 2 td run yes
Love this drive
PATTY RICARD THANKS BOB
TOUCHDOWNNNNNN RAVENS!!!
Great play from project Pat!
Much better play calling. Lock clockwork when we on.
Thank you sweet lord baby Jesus
The Texans wanted to be us so bad by going for it on 4th down
Has Dobbins played a snap today?
"flip over to the WFT  at commercial just in time to watch Haskins get pancaked

edit: scary terry appears"
Bill O'Brien MVP
"Good shit, Ricard!"
"First td

More to come"
"Imagine using analytics and probabilities to get an edge in a football game only to see the effort benefit the other team. Congrats, you're BoB."
"I haven’t heard anything about it, so I’m assuming Clark still has the Green Dot?"
Our run D is looking decent
"Also, I do hear crowd noises pumped in. Do you guys not hear it?"
Hell of a blown coverage.
yuck
Double fuck
"If Watson had time, that was a TD."
Does anyone know what Pacific time the game is
Need the offense to come out big this drive let the defense get some light under their feet and get back on top of things
This pass rush is gonna suck so hard next week.
Tavon being out does actually hurt us
Ate a whole wedge of triple cream brie and it’s got me fucked up
Fuck Earl Thomas bum ass for costing us 15 mil this year
"Bro, Ingram takes a fucking beating when he has the ball"
"Oh my god, if Lamar starts working voice inflection into his repertoire -- that's it. Call it. The man's in total sheriff, Brady/Rodgers territory."
Lamar to Tucker is now my ultimate dream play to see recorded in a regular game scorebook officially somehow
"All I want this season, besides a super bowl, is a Tucker tuddy"
what cant tucker do
Hollywood!
"Hollywood Brown making catches like he's 6'9"""
Let’s go! Is it just me or does Hollywood always land funny when he goes up for a catch?
Fuck running he’s gonna be Lamar Rodgers from now on
Tucker for wr
Doctor my Eyes just saw a pass from Jackson to Brown.
lamar throwing way offscreen? it's going to hollywood
That was a fucking zinger to Andrews but good defense
Little too much on that throw
MARLOOOOOOOOO
"ALSO, FRUIT PUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!"
Did I just say I want a TO?  YES I DID!
MARLOOOOOOO
YAAASSSSS GIVE ME THEM TURNOVERS
"WHO IN HERE SAID WE NEEDED A TURNOVER TD, WHAT A PREDICTION!"
Humph punch!
BUILD THAT FORT AND WATCH IT STAND
Marlon 😈😈
Humphrey is such a beast
Marlon>Jalen
He’s in come on
Texans can't be serious...
It’s not a TD!!?
The ball hit the pylon before he went out!
Oh wait we don't have to challenge because all turnovers are reviewed and they review the entire play. This review will end with us kicking a PAT
Lamar Jackson = LJ. Fort McHenry is in Baltimore. LJ Fort Illuminati confirmed?
LETTSS FOCKIN GOOOOOO!!
🔥 🔥 🔥
"The wink defense has nasty punches, Peanut did it all the time too"
All these great players we're going to have to pay 😭
Went the bathroom... guess that was a mistake.
For you Ravens fans to give some context here. The WR that caught the ball does this so often. He gives us flash of hopes and then does this and now will not play for the next 4 games probably lmoa
"thank god, that def looked like a legit TD"
"I'm surprised, but I'll take it!  TD!"
Thats a touchdown!
"LET'S GOOOOOOOO RAVENS!!!

😈"
"Houston blaming lack of energy on lack of crowd noise, pretty sure Houston would be silent regardless after that last TD"
Marcus motherfucking peters
bruh
What a catch
Holy fucking highlight reel.
I think the D heard the shit you all were talking.
MP JUICEMANE
MP JUICEMAN
MPJuiceman!!!!!!!!!!!
That's a catch by a mile
"good afternoon  Houston, the juice man is here."
OH YEAH DON'T FORGET WE HAVE A DEFENSE!
Juice man!!!
We starting to heat up!!!!
WHAT A PICK
Marcus gonna start clowning them😂 looks like Lamar ain’t playing in the fourth ☹️
M P JUICE MAYYNNNEEEE
MP JUICEMAN
MP Juiceman! God we are so lucky to have two stud corners.
People still try to act like we don’t have 2 of the top 5 corners
MP JUICEMAN MP JUICEMAN MP JUICEMAN
Turnovers win games. Turnovers lose games. We on the right side of those TOs
GIMMIE THAT!!
 JUICE MAN JUICE MAN
YESSSSS WHAT A CATCH
LJ Fort and MP masking our oline getting manhandled and the lack of a pass rush
Td here and after the half and cruise lol
EAT
"We are fucking scary, I love it"
Bud light guy needs to brown bag that beer
Lmao they making deshaun watch the pick
We don't stop the clock for out of bounds anymore?
I love Peters so much
Gotta feel bad for Watson honestly dudes just going to end up like Andrew Luck
I fucking LOVE Peters and humphrey duo. Keep them together!!!
MP stands for Magic Powers with how he caught that o.O
"We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs"
"Unfortunately for the Texans, they're stuck playing the Ravens on All-Madden difficulty."
"Man, OBJ is having a rough start to the season. Garret last week and now Watt"
I'm not used to seeing Stanley and Brown getting pushed like this
Well that wasn’t good
Stanley no
Fuck it.  Let Tucker try it from ther e
What the fuck o-line
O line pls
So I guess Stanley now has injuries to 3 parts of his body.
We can't lose Stanley. That could be devastating to the offense
Do we actually have an offensive line?
Ok the entire o-line needs to step up NOW without Stanley
Can Yanda start eating again - maybe he can make a comeback for week 4 or 5. Just need him to get in lineman shape
The o-line needs help. Idk why edc thought a third round rookie was gonna fill in for yanda.
Lmao an interception and the Texans are gonna score
Bullshit flag
AVERETT IS FUCKING TRASH
Again? Come on
LEARN TO TACKLE
What shit way to end the first half.
Averted shouldn’t even be on the team anymore
Rather have Levine play corner than Averette
Remember when Averett jumped over the fumble in KC and missed the ball entirely
"Our ILB is our best pass rusher, good lord"
"Shit needs to be said in the locker room, shit needs to be said"
Damn. Our o line looking like a bunch of beanbags
Huh???
WTF was that
we stayed really healthy last year. you get some soft spots exposed if guys start getting dinged up
Why did they give them time....
"Fuck off, come on"
O line needs to be addressed ASAP
fucking unreal
Actual BS but whatever
Offense is just not getting it together. Defense keeping us in this game. Let's hope oline can get it together and Lamar comes out angry in the second half to put together a TD drive.
"This O Line... Chris Jones and the Chiefs are gonna be licking their chops looking at this on game film.

We need to get this shit straight."
[deleted]
Thank fuck Lamar can throw cause the run game has gone to shit
When they stop the clock to call a penalty which ends up getting declined dont they have to impose a ten second run off?
Boykin is a tight end now I guess
Boykin's not a TE
"Lamar’s composure today >>>>

But I’d like to see him scrambling to avoid those sacks a little more. Bully them into submission"
These announcers called DeShonn Eliot a C and Boykin a TE so far
Watt is a legit superstar. His presence is felt this game.
"Gus, AKA the Bus."
"The OL isn't helping, but the playcalling has left a lot to be desired so far"
This is exactly why we should keep feeding the running backs
Our backs are the best downhill runners in the game
omg close up of Harbaugh eating his mask
FEED GUS
We had 3 lead blockers on that play and 3 players on the defense were around lamar unblocked within 3 yards.
Ray rice flashback
Need I say I'm throbbins for Dobbins?
Amazing play by dobbins staying up
I want to see a bomb to Hollywood lol
Dobbins is such a great pick
Way to go JK
Ray rice vibes
andrews almost got a hug for a td
That's a PI if the roles were reversed
Yeah the O-Line is a worry.
Dude Hollywood was wide open
pi
"Andrews wanted to moss him so bad, I would have nutted"
"i have faith in phillips, but he's just not it yet."
Phewwww. “Still fucking got it”
This fucking oline already
o line is booty
Tucker really scared me there
O line.... stand between the rusher and lamar pls
I miss Yanda
Thank God for Tucker
Offensive line straight dog ass
Orlando let that blitz right in untouched smh
"""STILL FUCKING GOT IT"""
Is our OL bad or is Houston’s DL good?
The Oline is lookin like Swiss cheese.
"Just seeing how close he can kick it to the upright without touching it, that's all. Totally intentional."
"These field goals are killing me. Total yards edge  and +2 turnovers, we should be up a lot more than 13."
It can’t just be the loss of Yanda. Somebody on that offensive line has regressed.
Tucker just tucking it in
Ngl I'm scared Lamar's gonna get hurt if they don't fucking block for him. Lamar getting hurt could potentially end the season
Orlando brown looked good playing next to yanda last year but now holy shit
We aren't used to winning and it not being close... In all honesty the team needs to overcome and pull through games like this. This is what sharpens our blades
I hate looking in this sub and everyone being so negative when we are up two possessions
McPhee almost blew that up
Watson just fucking go down jesus christ
LOL there were so many humans in that pile
Our front 7 is going to wreak havoc against a less athletic qb
ANTHONY AVERETT NOT ANTHONY EVERETT.
Averett. Jesus Christ. Do your job
Get Averett out of there bruh
Averett suuuucks.
averett shows up just to get fucked next play
Averett is a horrible football player
Averett is pain 😫
What ever happened to Iman Marshall? Has he been injured?
DOG PILE!
Do we have any other corners aside from Averette who could sub for him?
This drive is giving me agita!
Guess I'll take it. 😂 This team kinda playing like butt and drain the quarter for +3.
Can someone explain to me why Bernard Pollard hates  Harbaugh? [Link](https://twitter.com/crushboy31/status/1307799103192141827?s=21)
i’m ready for one of the cb’s off the practice squad. averett has been trash since we drafted him
We jumped boo
"Prince Amukamura is a FA 😏

Yeah, he's too good to be a fourth corner though"
"Oh look, now they have a manageable 3rd down..."
Lol who laughed there
Great job D!
Good stop
Houston out here trying to throw on Humphrey. Good way to not score touchdowns.
Long TD drive please. Even a long FG drive would be nice
Still pissed off they replaced Jake from State Farm into a handsome and fit man. I miss the old one 🤧
We need a long fucking drive like it's nobody's business.
Jackson is so entertaining to watch
Slippery like a rain drop!
she is so fine
"Slippery as a raindrop.

Poetry"
I need a HOUDINI play
"Did not know bout Andrews diabetes, huh that’s crazy"
JJ chill...plz
Jj Watt is not a human being.
Lowkey forgot how good JJ Swat is lol
LETS GO
LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!
FUCKING INGRAM!!!!!!!
I FUCKING LOVE THIS TEAM!!
What a call G Ro
The ravens are my favorite team
bruh my jaw is on the fucking floor lmao holy shit
Was that a direct snap to Ingram?
Best blocking all day! What a time for it to come!
Dagger.
BIG TRUZZZZZzzz
INGRAMMMMMM WHAT A PLAY GOD DAMN THAT WAS SEXY
2-0 baby
What did that net do to you Ingram?
"GRO is a handsome, husky genius"
YES SIRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
"What a clean run, jesus. Gotta love Ingram"
MEET ME OUTSIDE THE BANK....when we get back
"Damn, Jake from state farm buff af"
BOB so mad he took the mask off
"Still 10 mins to play, let’s get a TO"
Texans are known for having a bad oline and we have given Watson lots of time
"Watching the ravens play prevent towards the end of games always infuriates me, it’s so bad"
BLOCK THE FG PLZZ
Deshon > Desean
SACKED!
I traded Sammy Watkins to my buddy for Hollywood like 20 mins before kickoff and now Watkins is hurt holy fuck I just got that one off
Props to Faribairn for also staying clear of the illness affecting nearly all kickers this year and being pretty money for his team today
"https://twitter.com/ravens/status/1307813744194523136?s=21

Bruce Lee"
"Damn, easy on my QB fucker"
clock killing TD drive here we go
God I love football
We going.
[deleted]
Good thing the refs couldn’t see that blatant hold from Andrews 😂
Not a bad challenge.  Gives them a TO to go over 4th and 1.
Knee wasn’t down
Good challenge if don’t get it it’s basically a TO
He got it
how the heck didn't they spot that as a 1st lol
God we are lucky.
Yup. Houston's done.
Gus fucking ramming them
Time to load up the Gus Bus
THA WHEELS ON THA BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND
gus bus!!! ride the man!
I know these are garbage time yards but I love Edwards
Damn gus showing off
Make🙌🏽Gus🙌🏽bus🙌🏽the🙌🏽starter🙌🏽
Gus bus taking us to W street
Gus lives for the 4th quarter
Blacklock.... Dude is lucky he has an L in there
They just ejected Blacklock!
"Imagine having like 5 guys we trust to run the ball, Amazing

This fucking team guys"
"Member back in the first quarter “omfg were gunna lose” 

R-E-L-A-X"
"Gus ""7.9 YPC"" Edwards"
Can they stop going out of bounds 😂
"Ok, so it was a 5 minute drive with a FG. Still works."
Wasted a minute dumbass outside runs there
Another week it feels good to be a Raven
I like the implications
pick 6 coming up
Houston sports fans all collectively gathered outside the stadium as you can hear the boos
RGIII TIME!
So who’s our player of the game? The whole team ? Felt like a collective effort
ITS RG3 time again lmao
that will just about do it yeah?
#J K ALL DAY
Oh yeah. Dobbins is gonna be nice.
JK
Holy shit JK
I’m so fucking hungry for next Monday
"Who screaming ""get down""????????"
RIDE EM DOBBINS!!
Dobbins is a great open field runner. The turf monster almost got him there but he was crazy in college
Pray that Greg Roman doesn't try and fancy it up
Lamar looks a half step slower since he bulked up. Overall probably a good thing but we may not see another Bengals type play.
#RAY RICE
Watson a bitch begging for flags like that
Hey Jk maybe block somebody
"Listen I had a really hard week, I'm gonna need you guys to chill with the doom and gloom unless we're down 20 points in the last 2 mins of the fourth."
Looks like we're feeling the loss of Yanda
SERIOUSLY. PASS DEFENSE. WAKE UP
71 was way up field on that. Is he eligible?
Poor tavon young is made of glass
Brown won on that route. Gotta give him a chance.
FRUIT PUNCH
What’s the point of having Ingram if we don’t use him. Can’t just deep ball everything
"Got the best CB duo, but also the worst CB in the league to balance it out"
WHY ADD time!! This is rigged af
.....pass interference 100%
Refs robbed us of 7 WTFFF
"# Danny Lee Jesus ""D. J."" Fluker please"
"Don’t get me wrong I love our usual offense, but this type of offense hits different"
LETS FUCKING GO BOYS AND GIRLS
Dobbins is new but he should of got that block for Lamar coulda been a 1st
Tavon just can’t stay healthy
That dude is fragile as fuck. Jesus.
Stupid drive but points
Ok the missed tackles were probably just Martindale playing 4D chess for good field position.
Anyone else think this defense could be historically good?
COMPLETE TO TUCKER!
We need to run the ball
Was that a catch?!?
Oline keeping the Texans in the game
Opening gameplay was bad this game. Texans got rocked by the chiefs run game. We came out passing. The biggest downfall of this team is game planning and play calling. Same shit happened last season
Nice to see the refs only robbed us of 4 points instead of 7
We keep scoring and have no turnovers and everyone is screaming at our offense
Should have kept Carr
"Let’s go offense, let’s put a nice drive together."
Why are we running outside the tackles right now? Running out the clock is far more important than scoring.
Run the score up
Bob paid the refs smh
damn. refs hate you guys too? must be an AFC north thing
"I know we're winning but there is plenty to improve on right now.

Lamar had an open run lane for a first but instead threw it off-target to Hollywood in the end zone. Lamar in general is accurate today but his pocket presence is off.

Line is trash. Both offense and defense.

Offensive play-calling is off-rhythm. No Dobbins. Little Andrews. Extremely poorly done chance at end of half to capitalize on Peters's pick.

We better come out with a fire under us."
If they dont go for it they’re throwing in the towel.
"I’m more worried about staying healthy that I am winning this one. I mean, I want the dub but want everyone to finish the game healthy even more. These 1pm games have been brutal with some huge injuries."
Unrelated but can someone explain the Bills hype to me? They had the easiest schedule ever last year and this year they've scraped by the Jets and are losing to the Dolphins. They're a slightly above average team at best
"Aww, Denver finding a way to screw it up"
Fucking denver
okay rsvens time to reclaim first place
"Me before the season: ""Denver with the help of talented rookies such as Jerry Jeudy and with Drew Lock as QB will be a legit contender for the playoffs!""


Me now: :/"
"Ok, can we just end this trash Pittsburgh game and get to our coverage?"
HELL YEAH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS!
I'm so afraid of todays match and not because of the match up but because of all the injuries around the league. Like people dropping all over the place smh
I love being in the zone for the game this week and not having to jump through ten hoops to watch the game.
How are y'all watching the game? Any streaming services?
It is really good to hear Kevin Harlan
Purple and White is such a sexy combo
"in other news, herbert is starting"
Here we go
"Hey, do you guys think Mark Andrews will be a Raven long term? (To buy or not buy a jersey)"
Good 3 and out there
3 and out baby!
Imagine punting on 4th & 1.
We suck at sweeps
Let’s fucking go
Get a turnover and get that momentum going
"Alright, we can just start the game for real now"
Time to wake up guys...
"cmonnnn Tavon down, nooooo"
And hes gone again
"FUCK

At least he’s walking"
"Oh no, another injury :("
Oh Tavon :(
Fuck tavon young hurt again
"Oof, that definitely popped out slightly"
"Call Ed Reed. I know he's bored and not doing anything right now. For old times sake, Ed."
Dude if he is injured again idk how we can keep him next year
"Knee sprain? Lets hope, be strong Tavon :("
Tavon Young is injured again god fucking damnit this guy is so frustrating to root for.
Maybe tavon will be ok
"Ok. I'll admit it. Through 1 game plus a quarter, I was wrong about Queen. Dude is a stud and I can't wait to see him develop."
YAS QUEEN
QUEEN KEPT FIGHTING
">DT Brandon Williams is dressed, but backup Justin Ellis started the drive and just went out for Derek Wolfe. Something to watch. - @jonas_shaffer"
Anyway I can watch the game without getting DMCA notice? My mom got one for last weeks game and it freaked her out lol.
Where was the protection?   (I like JJ Watt except NOW)
Who remembers 2013 when we were literally ecstatic for first downs
Terrible play
That guy with cleats same color as the ball got me excited for no reason
Lol are we gonna run the ball?
"I hate the head to head flag, but how was that not a penalty?"
NICE block by boykin
"Guys we will adjust, remember last year when we played them?"
rUn ThE bAlL
Guys.  Its the first quarter.  Calm. Down.
That was a good throw
"Fuck it, throw it to Andrews every play. No one can stop him."
"lol he did not need to hurdle at all though, just go around"
The CBS broadcast is fuckin awful. We keep missing the start of plays.
Where tf is our O-Line?
Boykin again!
Looks like Boykin might have a day
Alrighty... I am scared as shit 😂
Big first down!
We're rolling now
Dobbins? Ingram? Gus?
The way Lamar throws is art
Well at least doubtful means it’s probally a knee sprain and he’ll be back at some point.
We don’t run the ball anymore apparently
O LINE GIVE LAMAR A SECOND PLZ
Pound the rock
"I get so worried when Lamar runs lol, I feel like his mother."
Lamar i Iove you
"Roby is out there headhunting wtf, every single tackle he's going headfirst like Shazier"
Holy fuck free rusher on every play
Why is Hollywood in the backfield?
got tipped i think
Flat
"Take your points, brick by brick"
Jesus fuck
Bruh
just a nice job my deshaun. he's a more likeable big ben.
I miss Suggs
"It's one thing to get outran by Watson, but to get stiff-armed by him? Come on lol"
Ravens D  just got Lamar'd.
"Gotta be honest, that was impressive"
He's greased up with oil and butter
"Gotta get him down, but honestly that kind of pressure, no matter how experienced Watson is, has to rattle him on some level."
"Can't believe he wasn't whistled down, I think Ward let go."
Queen is the smart one and not going for the kill to make him throw it out
how tf did we let him go lmao
fuck lmao Watson is legit
Gotta stop this here
Fuck off the field fuckers
lol I love our guys but he made us look silly there.
bruh did they just call Elliot a Corner?
Any known streams for the out of towner's??
"I get Watson is slippery but damn, dude. Tackle the man! You practice against Lamar!"
Big oof
What call was that
Bob things
FUCK YEAH
Bill O'Brien gonna Bill O'Brien
D is playing their asses off. We aren't sacking but the pressure is for sure getting there. DBs doing the damn thang too
And this is when we pile on. That was a mistake.
Wasn’t Queen I don’t think
Fucking Bowser got thrown like a toddler 😂 that is not how you get the big money extension
"What in the fuck was that call?! I mean, go Ravens, but damn. So dumb."
Wink def knew they were gonna go for it and took the timeout
Great screen play
nice set up on the screen
Lamar is throwing darts!
"Interesting to see if Dobbins gets the touch here at the 1.

edit: gus bus"
Man I thought he was gonna get there
Boyle looked so dejected that he didn’t get in
TOUCHDOWN RICARD!!
Ricard making up for last week
TOUCHDOWN RAVENS!
Cool.
JuSt RuN tHe BaLl
Solid drive Lamar throwing lasers
yoooooooooo
WHAT A CATCH DAMN SON
Thank you BOB
Richard is Dat Boi.
Damn.  Akins a big dude
"Come on, defense! Work hard to get Lamar the ball back!"
"Wake me up when the playoffs start, this scrub Watson won’t be there"
A moving pre-snap defense will typically be a good one. Add the talent in and you’ve got a great defense
Whose the person out there responsible for coming up with m words to rhyme?
Where tf was Marlon running
Llama looks sad 😔
fuck
"FFS you gotta get ahead of that throw, they just got 36 yds"
Wake up D!
Come on let’s get a TO
This is bullshit
Fells is killing us.
ugh no thnk u
Okay yea that definitely should’ve been an ineligible man downfield
Defense forgot how to defense
I miss Tavon already 😔
Baker belongs in a book club.
Levine out of his depth back to back. He should only be a special teams player.
Mark Andrews time
Can anyone comment on how the chiefs are looking?
was that Duvernay's first career catch?
Jackson is such a pimp
Who gets ball at halftime?
"Looks like this year Lamar is going to be much more of a passer than runner.

More practical but not going to lie I’m going to miss the nutty rushing attack."
Coaching adjustment - Lamar doesn't always have his mouth guard in when he's handing it off. Defense can easily key on that.
Hollywood!!
"Nice catch, Tuck!"
"we need some trick plays to get Tucker in at wr. 


/s odviously"
HOLLYWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Lol Justin Tucker the legend
##HOLLYWOOD
"HOLLYWOOD.

Massive first down! We need a touchdown here."
I get the feeling they wanted Ingram as the vet to be the primary ball carrier against a Texans D line led by Watt and out for some revenge from last year.
Am I the only one noticing Mark Ingram being open asf on those fake runs where he goes short to the side????? Like why not even try that
"Fun fact, I still have to mute the TV when JT kicks. I know he’s Mr. Automatic, but I’m still scarred for life from Hauschka (sp?) and Cundiff"
"lol, Fox for Cards-WFT just called Watson vs Jackson an NFC showdown."
"I don’t understand why Dobbins hasn’t been in more, he looked good last week. I hope they get him involved in the second half"
Fuck I love Marlon he’s always forcing fumbles
Harbs had the red flag in his hand. Challenge coming up?
OH LORT LJ FORT
#FRUIT PUNCH
MARLON HUMPREY PERFECTED THE PEANUT PUNCH
Of course it was Humphrey who punched it out!!
Punch Master Marlo
Hold that ball tight when Humphrey is around!!
Looked like he got in
HOLY SHIT!!!!???!!!
Snowball is about to get extra snacks tonight!!!!
"Aaaaand. HE'S SHORT BY A YARD! Damn, Kevin"
Whats under review?  To see if its a touchdown?
Td
Yo that Wendy’s pretzel burger looks sus
Can someone explain the fruit punch to me apparently I missed a meme
BLANKET FORT
Ok everyone take a breath now. We got this.
More good news: Chiefs are getting cooked by Justin Herbert
💜🖤💜🖤
building the fort in the end zone
We’re taking no prisoners
"I’m glad that we’re getting the train going, but can we just appreciate that it wasn’t Dan Fouts that was officiating when this happened?"
Buy Von Miller for the low EDC
We gotta knock Watson on his ass
Charles Tillman looks at Humph highlights and probably smiles
Fucking Peters.
YOOO

**MP JUICE MAN**
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHH!
MP FUCKING JUICEMAN!!!!
My god is that clean!?!?!?!
WHAT A PICK
ODELL IN SHAMBLES JUST GOT SHIVERS DOWN HIS DANG SPINE.
The defense has finally woken up haha
I might cry guys
Y'all thirsty? Have a damn JUICE BOX!
Get that sorry offense off the field!
What a fucking catch by MP juice man! Most receivers couldn’t make that catch
Ravens need to PAY Lamar.
That. Was. Incredible.
Marcus Peters is a fucking hawk
What a pick!!!!
Holy shit
I wanna see hollywood in open space more
STUNTIN ON THESE HOES
MP JUICEMAN!!! LET'S GO OUT THERE AND GET A TD BEFORE THE HALF
Woooooo
WHAT A FUCKING PICK
PICK 6 SHAWTY!!
Our defense may not be our all time best but it is fun as fuck
Score here then get the ball first in the 2nd half.
Watson tried to break that tablet
MP JUICE MAN
PETERSSSSSS
Hey Deshaun! We ain’t the fucking Chiefs! You ain’t throwing that shit easy on us!
Watt's just damn good.
Too many sacks smh
I know it's JJ but OBJ is getting burned.
QB1 is pissed at that line
"J.J. Watt is great when healthy, Lamar Jackson is not bad for a runningback.... tell me something I didnt know."
Orlando Brown is getting bullied
"Where is Jackson's protection? Dang, JJ Watt is good.  And handsome."
JJ Watt is good relax guys
AGAIN! WTF
"Fuck I'm filthy with our oline. Weak, weak, weak."
My god this oline lmao
I'm cri
At least we get the ball back at half
Man our OL is struggling today
"LMAO pathetic protection.

Gotta call faster routes if they can't protect Lamar better than this."
Please stay healthy
Greg Roman forgot his specialty is running the ball.
They are pinning their ears back. Need to call a screen pass or draw to ease that pressure
FUCKING FINALLY
"it's okay to miss watson once, he's crazy slippery. just stay on him."
"if the oline showed up today, we'd be up like 30"
Where's Jimmy Smith? I hate having Averett out there
"The O-Line has been atrocious, but god bless Lamar and understanding that he can’t give the ball away."
"DEFENSIVE

ROOKIE

OF

THE

YEAR"
Bruh how we about to let Watson do this and get momentum going into half.
Averett more like ayy catch it
Anthony come on man
Very nice sack
"Get Averett outta there, dude is a liability"
Please let that flag be on Houston
"They're blitzing every play, just start calling screens until they soften up"
averett is not very good man
You would never guess Averett is a former Alabama DB by looking at his play in the NFL
What the ever loving fuck was that bullshit
"So....it's still 20-7. Right?

😑"
"Damn, only up 10 with a fumble return td and pick."
Put in Mekari or somebody on the line we need some stability there
"We made good adjustments at the half last week, let’s hope we do here."
Why we passing so much? Where's the run game?
"Up 10 at the half despite a shakey Oline/Run game play, and we get the ball back? All is good"
Definitely too much passing in the first half as well. We got 3 good backs gotta get them involved.
Fuck off refs
Refball
Wtf was that call?
Can't show the replay because nothing happened
Did they start pumping in crowd noise this half
"Today, our kicker became a WR and one of our WRs became a TE"
Gus Bus!
BEEP BEEP IT'S THE BUS
The Gus Bus has NO brakes!
Y’all weren’t ready for the BUS
So whats going on with Dobbins? Doghouse? Injury in Pregame? He had gotten 0 touches
Best this century 😎
We finally seem to be getting the running game going
DOBBINS
Holy Ray Rice Deja vu
i see ray rice
THERE'S DOBBINS
"Way to get us a first down, Dobbins!"
He looks so much like Rice
Dobbins is special yall
He wasn’t even looking at the ball
dobbins using that rice arm
Just had a realization about our time of possession on this drive. Unreal.
It's nice having ray rice back
"This drive has officially taken half the quarter.

Let's end it right, boys."
OL....geez man.
Jesus Christ line
Philips is killing us at RG
No PI??
Oof that was close
HOLY SHIT TUCKER. GOT ME WORRIED
I get we are up but this o line is really sad today
"Nailed It!  

&#x200B;

47-Yd Field Goal for Tucker"
Man what is up with our o line!?!
Tucker playing with us lol
Phillips is fucking shit
Oline is worse than dogshit
Bozeman is our best lineman at the moment (Stanley a close second) and that makes me suuuuper nervous
Lamar needs to throw it to the check down  . It might be a difficult throw but it’s the only option
cmon defense step up and get the ball back!
fuck yes
"Brought the house, and it fell on Watson like the Wicked Witch."
"B-Will getting pressure, I see you big boy!"
Bowser has been amazing so far
Watson is so good jesus
That was a good throw.
Averett sucks
WHAT THE FUCK
We can’t do better than Averett?  God damn that mother fucker sucks
Oof. Amazing pressure. But Averett not quite there.
That was a fucking beautiful pass
I’m so sad about Tavon
Lol
Has Hump even allowed a completion?
"Line needs to get better at picking up their assignments.

I know yanda is gone but this has been an inexcusable amount of missed blitzers."
Can Watson not set his feet and throw anymore? He does that high-school jump pass even when there's no pressure lol
"I know we have a 10 pt lead but it just doesn't feel like it bc we can barely stop the pass and the o line can't pass block to save their lives. And before you ask - no, I'm not a bandwagon fan from last year."
We need a touchdown
Houston’s wr corps is all-in on blazing fast #2’s lol
Get 6 sirs
Points or bust on this drive
Any news on Tavon?
"If you ignore the fact we are up and only look at the bad plays, we are playing god awful. /s"
Own td game over
Is there a way we can run the clock for 14:10?
SNEAD!!
NEED4SNEAD
GOOD JOB SNEAD
Nice to see the Ravens having multiple receivers with decent hands
remember that flacco era game where jj watt basically singlehandedly destroyed us? i can't remember the specific year.
"Man, JJ Watt has been an absolute beast today"
i really don’t care for plays to ricard
GO FOR IT!!!
Going through his reads.
Get em!
go for it
Hell yeah coach let’s go for it

Chiefs about to drop an **L**
There goes our offense big truss wooo wooooo
Not sure I’ve ever seen a play blocked that well.
Thank you thank you thank you
Anyone just see that dropped pass in the KC game? Lol
Clay Matthews had 8 sacks and is still a FA @EDC
I feel like there’s a decent amount of holding not getting called
THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT
Another sack!!!
Theres the sack
JOKER
JOKER SZN
There we go DeShon!!
Finally starting to feel good about this game (Pls football god don't jinx us)
Let's eat some clock.
"Lol, KC is not taking that L."
Boyle gives up on blocks so fast
Amazing tackle stopped a touchdown
What a freaking tackle. I thought he was gone.
Jackson had the whole outside and ran straight into the defender
Kinda disappointed that we didn't take that to the house lmao.
"Well, at least we're still terrible when it comes to challenges."
Yo again I ask where can I get that neck gaiter Harbaugh is wearing?
Good win obv but you gotta feel bad for the wasted talent in Houston
"Fake punt.  Sam Koch TD pass.  

I'll buy a Koch jersey immediately."
I feel like Stanley not having a good game....is this true?
Gus Bus is sneaky big
"I gotta say, Edwards looks a heck of a lot more explosive than Ingram so far this year."
GUS THE BUS
I heard Gus was once called the Bus.
Damn Gus Bus is fucking doing it today
Gus is going to get paid next year.
Gus Bus> Jerome Bettis
THE BUS LOST ITS BRAKES
RUN UP THE SCORE ON THEM
"you know what's an improvement, last season lamar had trouble keeping an eye on the play clock, but this year, he seems to be in complete control."
Boze on that play tho 😳
Gus is so damn talented. I hope we don’t trade him
These timeouts.... yikes
Lets see JK run it down their throat!
"Still think Gus should be our 1. I love Ingram, but Gus is my man."
Jk in the doghouse for something. What he do?
Chargers up 3
Lets get Lamar another passing TD
lamar jackson TD coming up
running out of bounds Lamar?  hmm.
"Also I was thinking this earlier, I don’t think JK quite knows the playbook yet and that’s why he’s not playing as much. But I’m just guessing"
Props to the texans LB’s they’ve been keeping up with lamar for the most part.
Why we extending the game lol run up the middle lol
"This was a gutsy win, but our blocks were so low-effort"
Today was a good day to have Tucker on your Fantasy team.
Rg3 time?
Anyone else just get a big ass smile looking at Lamar on the sideline?
GG GUYS LETS GOOO
Remember when people in here were just saying how our defensive pressure is awful?
Dayum
Lol we really out here adding insult to injury like this? 😂
"43 yards from 3rd string rb, yes please!"
glad we came out of this game with a W and mostly healthy.
This is tough for Houston. They haven't looked that bad these last two weeks but they seem like they have no heart left. Two games back in the division already too.
oof not gonna be able to physically watch the game next week gonna have to listen on 98 rock dont have ESPN anymore
LET'S GOOOO 2-0
lol game over!
Chargers/Chiefs likely going to OT (if the Chiefs don't win outright).
Can we make sad Texans a new meme?
LOL he really called a punt there huh
The crowd noise in this LA game is annoying. Like an annoying constant buzz
Our oline is straight trash
If Lamar made that pass his haters wouldn't shut up 🤣
Tavon injured? What else is new.
We aren't playing particularly well today. Guess I'm spoilt by our great play in the Lamar era.
"Laughably bad play calling here.  Yes, our line is bad and will offer no protection, so why aren't we dialing up a short pass or a draw?"
Dobbins needs to block
"Another day, another Tavon on IR"
Whelp there goes Tayvon Young
I'm pretty sure Tavon just ended his career. I really hope I'm wrong.
Holy shit we look like ass today.  Andrews is the only consistent player
Lamar is carrying us rn lol goodness
Is the field super shitty? Lamar keeps slipping.
"I know deshaun is good, but you have to get a sack there. Embarrassing"
Lmao tucker!!!
Tucker is a new WR
Put tucker at WR!
“Judon is getting close though” -someone who told me Clowney sucks cause he doesn’t get sacks
Now our OBJ is acting like a homegirl.
Time for Fluker at RG
The next Texans completetion raven's reddit is going to call for Bisciotti to sell the team
Amazing how these announcers really forget about the person who got this mobile QB trend started with Cam.
Do not go for it if we don’t get it.
Miles Boykin is such a good blocker
“Best in the league”???
Averett is fucking trash. What the fuck was that
Tavon’s just going to be one of those guys isn’t he? Fuck.
Can we trade for JJ Watt at halftime?
Online is having a hard time yes but it seems lamar is picking the wrong of the two holes every single time which is extremely uncommon.  Though no real blame on him considering he usually Always picks the right hole.
"Didn't get promoted?? BUY A CAR!! 

WE DEFINITELY CARE ABOUT WOMEN AMIRITE FELLAS?"
Well that was flat
Come-on rookie! you got to make that block
"First drive - Lamar scrambled during a 3 man rush. He usually stays patient at that point. 

2nd down play reminded me of the bills game."
Come on Matt. Gotta make that play.
Tavon is made of fucking glass man..
Every fucking year. Poor guy
Mahomes playing like shit today.
Mahomes is 2/8 for 14 yards after 1 quarter? I mean they'll almost certainly still win but that is pretty wild.
"The Texans are going to gain some yardage but make no mistake, there is absolutely nothing there for them right now anywhere on the field. This is some vintage ravens defense so far."
TUCKER
Damn. First bad pass from Lamar.
Seriously.  Fuck this week.
Fuck our o-line is terrible
Extremely lucky to be up by 13 now
Temper tantrum!
"Well, just make the ref fumble and they’ll add time for you"
"The defense ended the half with a penalty filled choke job, think the same thing happened last week but we escaped without giving up anything"
I’ve seen a lot of BS officiating in my life but giving time back to the opposing team so that they have enough time for a fg? That’s beyond ridiculous
Dude was open.
Shit coverage by Queen
Why the hell was Queen playing at corner?
Was nervously waiting for a flag there on Marlon
"I never watch broadcast TV except during football season.  Damn, these commercials suck.  Even worse during an election year."
Imma need Mandrews to go off these next 7 minutes to hel my fantasy team
That was so risky
##Put Gus Edwards in the Ring of Honor
"Props to the Oline, they're winning the battle when they know what's coming."
"There's no reason for Lamar to carry, let alone go out of bounds there."
Take 3.
Run up the score plz
Ferguson can’t even get off a running back bro
imma be honest... don’t flame me fellas... I think Baker’s commercials are funny.
This play calling is trash
"Honestly. It's not ""spoiled"" or ""annoying"" for wanting to have the team mix up the plays. Use the running backs we have. They can help"
Mahomes will eat this secondary alive. We're going to have to blitz 6 the whole game.
Broncos 👀
Please broncos 👀
steelers bout to lose to a back jeff driskel
I really hope this game finishes before our game starts
At least theres no way for this game to go into OT
Still not over
will the Steelers play against real football teams this year besides us?
Man this game sucks I can't wait for Lamar to put 60 on the Steelers. FTS.
Broncos choking again 🤦🏽‍♂️
Fuck
"Every time I see a score that shows the underdog making a game interesting, literally within two minutes of me turning the game on, they fucking tank and do something stupid."
Had to switch over to the Washington game. Really can’t sit through this Steelers game until ours starts
Ravens game day boys. Let’s go!!
Damn Steelers always getting lucky against awful teams.
I’m watching Sunday ticket. Where’s the game?
Oh yes Harlan is commentating Im so happy
Texans won and elected to receive- they know if they give the ball to Lamar to start they’ve got no chance.
All the homies LOVE Kevin Harlan
We are off
LETS GO
BOW SHIT !!! HOL UP ! MOVIE
did CBS fuck up and not show us the first 2 plays
Nice 3 and out to start D.
PUNT
3 and out!
HELL YEA JIMMY
Smith did his job there.  Nice.
Nicely done Defense!
Harrison is already starting? Wow thats crazy!
I love it when teams receive first
"R A V E N S 

RAVENS!!!"
"whats up my dudes, couldn't watch last week so this is my kickoff today

and to make it all better, it's kevin harlan on the call

lets fucking go!!!"
F***
LET'S GO D
No tavon
Jesus christ man
"Tavon again, oh no."
Oh God no Tavon
Welp
Tavon pls
Goddammit tavon
thats not ideal
Oooph bad landing
FUCK
🙃🙃🙃
FUCK
"That did not look good - gotta feel for Tavon man. Second year in a row. What a terrible day for injuries, but not a good way to start."
What even happened there?
what a surprise
Hopefully it's just a knee sprain
The falcons are having the hardest 28-3 flashbacks right now
"Fuck man, was so excited to see him play this year w/ MP and marlo"
Id rather see Jimmy outside now and Marlon in the slot
watson does have good escapability. that was nice pursuit.
"Good pressure there, and nice play by Queen"
Good DEFENSE!
Good job D
PUNT
LFG
Finally they got him down
"Not a sack, but I'll take pressures all day, everyday."
Hope my dude Young is good. Wearing his jersey that I never wear too much and of course :(
Ok shake off the last drive and get some momentum here
I like how we've already touched the qb more than we did last week.
Come on guys  you need to have faith. Have faith in my bobby
Let's fucking do something now
Ditched my wife making Halloween decorations to watch the game.  Im in trouble.  But don't care
Watt is just good.
What the fuck offense??
78 you awake??
Run the ducking ball
\#FFS WE GOTTA PROTECT LAMAR
MANdrews
MANDREWS!
JJ is gonna be disruptive lol
Andrews there we go!
"Nice, but no need for the hurtle there, Mandrews."
Helmet to helmet
handrews do be looking like white drake.
Those first few offensive plays were an hommage to our pre-Lamar days
Gotta love how the Texans PA people accidentally made the fake crowd cheer during a big play for the Ravens haha
Literally zero runs lol
Have we ran the ball at all yet????
The o line is looking like an issue early
Big boy Boykin.
Good play Boykin
God the people in this fucking game thread man. You would think we would be down 21 by the way people are talking
Hell yea Myles
Offensive line needs to wake up
Let’s go Miles!
Run. The. Bal..
Yes Boykin nice slant
How bout our runningbacks take some carries...
Has anyone seen our o line?
"The o-line looks awful, what's going on?"
There he is!!
Now this looks like the ravens offense
Is stunting happening?!
Oof that injury report does not sound good
We rollin now boys. Don't forget the Texans are still a good team
Is Tavon done for the year again? That would be devastating for him
They aint running the ball cause our interior line had some trouble against Cleveland Last week. How ya'll think they will do better against the Texans d-line who is 10x better than Cleveland
>Ravens cornerback Tavon Young (knee) doubtful to return - @AaronWilson_NFL
Damn it.  Need Young
lamar's doing a good job avoiding injuries so far
O-line has been hot shit. Lamar keeping the drive alive every play
Both tackles seem confused
Nice route by Boykin.
Lamar such an escape artist
"Finally seems like the O is getting a rhythm, but it'd be nice to get the backs involved."
What a run
"Shame Lamar got caught there, they faked out Watt real good"
"I like the 3. Definitely wanna see more running plays to our RBs though. Can't complain about the drive though, D is holding it tf down"
Both defenses came to play today
TACKLE!! And damn Watson is strong.
Damn dude I hate those plays lol
"Dang, is DS greased up??"
PUNT!
Sneaky Watson
Credit to our secondary for holding it down through that 3rd down
Are you serious Ward?
We have to finish these tackles guys.
Sack that MF goddamnit!!
Bruh the play clock was on 2 just let it run out
Watson is really good at breaking tackles
Watson just too strong?? lol
So this is what other teams feel
FUCK YEAH
Want that face covering Harbs has. Anyone know if it's for sale?
#DEFENSE
Thank you very much
Horrible call by Texans
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!
thats embarrassing
AW YISS. MOTHER.FUCKING. ##PRESSURE
Queeeeeeen
Lmaooooo
LFG
GET YOUR FUCKING WEAK SHIT OUTTA HERE!!!
Let’s get a TD here
RECEP-BACK
Oh yeah I like that
Ingram took a hell of a shot and didnt even flinch.
Haven't seen a screen in years
"Goes for it on 4th down in their own territory and doesn't get the first...

*The connection to your peer has been lost.*"
Reminder. We were only up by one score at the end of the first quarter of last year’s Texans game. Then we feasted.
Wasn't our score something like this after q1 against Texans last year?
"That was... a strange move by BoB. No fans, low energy, 3-0 game. You just manufactured energy for the Ravens, man! 😂"
Dunn is a big boy
Bozeman block was fire
Bob is glad he has a mask on to hide his red ass face rn
i have it on good authority that greg roman read all of your complaints. tyfys
##yasss screen
Boyle just can't buy a TD
Omg Boyle almost!
I thought that's was 6 for sure
I'll fucking take it
Gotta lead him just little more Llama lol
WE JIVIN NOW
"I’m happy to see Hayden succeed today, but we’re still good without him"
TOUCHDOWNNNNNNNN
Good Work patty
😍😍😍😍
I’ll take it lol
Nice job ric
Juiceman pick 6 plz
RECEP-BACK!
"I say Texans, you say fuck em, Texans"
What's the rule again for blocking kicks? Seemed like a lot of Texans lined up on one side.
Anyone from AZ know why our CBS isn’t showing games today?   It’s three hours of paid programming in place of the game lol
"Come on, D!"
Pass rush needed desperately
Seeing lineman just standing around as a play ends give me war flashbacks to middle school and I love it
Fuck
oof. Marlon abandoned the TE. was he expecting help?
who's man
"Double, awful yuck"
SMH
Fuck
Alright. Get one back
"Ok 

Let’s go"
It's really disappointing that Ferguson or Bowser aren't starters at DE/OLB yet. We need a serious upgrade in those positions.
ibm WATSON hahahahahaha
"Need a touchdown drive here.

Texans are a good team, Watt is back and we're in their house after blowing them out in ours last time."
"Marlon tried to pull a Peters and jump the outside route, ended up handing Fells a first down"
Levine showing why he stays on special teams still after this whole time
Lamar is sharp
Duvernay!
Lamar's throws just look so much more crisp this year.
DUUUUUUUUUU
DUV
Love Devin
Beautiful throw.
Where’s JK
How come our fake hand offs look a lot more fake this season...?
Interesting that we're not trusting them deep yet.
Yeah man it’s not as easy for us to run to the right without yanda.
Jk time
Lol Tuck
I fucking love this team
HOLLYWOOOD
HOLLYWOOD!
That's an easy 26 yards
Hollywood always seems so close to turning those jets on
Holly
🎥🎥🎥
Tucker is automatic
I’ll take those points thank you very much
I wish we were running as much as we were play action(ing)
"Now this might be hard for you all to understand, but JK might not be a good matchup against this d line. Also, he'll be much fresher later when the d is tired"
YESS I STARTED DST
I JUST CREAMED
Just when y’all were losing truss
Hell yeah. Let's punch this one in!
I think he's in
Humphrey the Hammer
I liked that.
That fucking punch
Marlo is that motherfucker
Thanks for the ball Houston
FRUIT PUNCH!
HUMPS GOT THAT PEANUT PUNCH IN HIS BAG!!!!
"LETS GOOOOO. Also, how the hell did they miss that hold on Judon??"
LJ FORT
Oh come on ref give him that td!
That’s a TD baby!
LETSSS FUCKKIIIINN GOOOO
HELL YEAH!! I’M WEARING MY HUMPHREY JERSEY TODAY TOO!
Fuck yea
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
Fort TD lets go Fort!!!
Let's go!!!!
Wow I didn't realize Fort fumbled that after the score. Almost pulled a Mosley
Hollywood was gonna let Deshaun eat shit into the bench lmao
HOLY SHIT MP JUICEMANNNN
What a grab by Peters!!
FUCKING PETERS!!!!!!
great catch
That shit was beautiful
What an INT!!
HOLY SHIT that pick
WHAT A FUCKING CATCH
You love to see it!
that was a beautiful catch by Peters
 Peters!!!
That was an incredible dive!
MP JUICE MAN!!!!!!!
I love our secondary :'-)
MP JUICE MAN!
Now we gotta game goin
Announcer should know it doesn’t matter if it touches the ground as long as he’s in control of it when it does
Fuck he could have been a wr lol
LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!
I’m just picking up on it
What's up with the lack of deep play attempts? Is it because of the amount of pressure Lamar is under?
Can we get some fucking protection for Lamar? Please?
"Jimmy’s turn, please?"
"Watts still got it, dang"
F***
Can we actually protect Lamar?????
Watson looks like he wants to end it all lmao
Why aren't we running the ball?
We're making the plays but the Texans are manhandling some guys out there. A lot more physical.
Fuck
Rare bad play
He looks OK
Holy shit... bad goes to worse.
Not stanley...again.
Please be okay Stanley. We need you
No reason to call such a play on offense. You know our o line can’t hang on for more than a few seconds so there’s very little chance our WRs can run a longer route. Need quick hits not long slow developing pass plays come on
Stanley doesn’t look too distraught
Alright defense no points let’s go to the half
Roman needs to play all to their strengths. Gun the whole game.
Wouldn’t a pick 6 be fun here?
Terribly managed drive there. That was a chance to really put the Texans up against it.
Such a weird game
Anyone got any O-Line players for a 5th rounder?
This new overly pass happy play calling along with our struggling OL is really pissing me off now
"Oh, yeah we can get sacks too, baby!"
Shocked that we were actually able to tackle watson there
There's the sack we needed!
QUEEN
Bowser deserves a contract extension over Judon so far
I got excited for a sack but nvvm
"Judon needs to break down and tackle, he keeps diving and wiffing"
Bs call
QUEEEEEEEEN
Averette is bbq chicken
Ofc a convenient penalty
Can we fucking tackle? Jesus Christ
Defense shitting the bed now...
Home game clock operator is friendly
Nice referee escort on this drive
"Okay, ref. What are you seeing? 😂"
What’s the noise I hear in the broadcast?  I thought they weren’t pumping crowd noise at the stadium.
"Put Jimmy on the outside man, this is why we signed him"
"We just rushed 2, wtf?"
We need to chill tf out
What in tarnation
We adjust and get the ball back next half. We're still up two scores people
"As long as the line play is cleaned up next half, we should be fine"
"6 point swing cause of that sack. Oh well, still in good position."
This is defensive battle imo neither of our lines are holding up.
Chest pain? WTF is that lol
"Not apart of the local market and the CBS game for my area is the chiefs game. Fuck me I guess. 

How is the game so far"
What is pollards beef?
"Damn, that Washington/Cardinals game is speeding! They're already 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter."
We knew oline would not be the same without Yanda
Stanley is hurt and looks like it and Brown jr. Is getting embarrassed by Watt. We need to do something.
omg bullshit flag
🙄
great job Boykin
Boykin TE?
"""Boykin the tight end"""
Wait Boykin is a tight end?
boykin just chilling where he needed to inbetween
Did Boykin play TE in college?
There is a reason they keep calling pass. They aren’t able to get enough push on Oline.
GUS BUS!
Where is Dobbins?
Nice run gus
Let’s get the Bus chugging baby
THA WHEELS ON THA BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND
THE GUS BUS ROLLS
Da busss
Love Boykin ❤️😩
GUS BUS let's get that run game going!
Lamar has been deadly with his voice today
Now we running
Dobbins might not be a strong blocker yet
Keep Gus in over Mark rn if we’re just gonna act like JK doesn’t exist lol
"Gus is a beast for bit DLs.

Even if JK is an everydown back I love rotating power and speed backs"
I love Seeing Gus getting physical
JK!!!
That was some terrible blocking lol
JK!!
JK Rolling
Dobbins you fucking stallion.
I like that Dobbins
Love that second effort by dobbins
"Dobbins giving me Ray Rice flashbacks

Get JK'D"
Looked like Ray rice
Dobbins has received a target from his coach. Dobbins is a free RB!
AMAZING PLAY BY DOBBINS
Dobbins fresh in the second half.  Let's get it
jk had has  the hand like ray
"Orlando Brown, I love you man but you are getting eaten alive against Watt today..."
Fucking oline
**UGH O-LINE**
Obj is getting worked.
"I want to see an option play with Llama, Dobbins, BUS, Ingram, and (fuck it, why not) RG3."
Can our OL block?
"Where is our o-line today? Texans D is not good, yet we are getting manhandled"
Really not liking our O-line play
Kinda fucked up that you can’t challenge a no-call
"Damn, you could see the shadow of the ball on the goal post as it passed. Hard to get closer than that without hitting. Still the GOAT"
"Man I miss Yanda. His presence made the two guys next to him better, and it's showing these first two games."
Dont think Phillips was as ready as Harbs thought he was. Skura is playing slightly scared it looks like which is to be expected coming off such a serious injury. Bozemen has held up decently though.
Start Fluker and start Dobbins.
Lamar ran straight into that sack. Phillips picked up the stunt pretty well tbh. Still unsure about him  but that one wasn't a miss
Come on D make a play! We need yall
Eww Ray look creepy af in that pic lol
13 pt lead not bad
Come on defense tighten up
there we go
nice!!
BIG BABY
That tackle holy cow
Nice tackle Averette!
"Thank god we sacked him, Cooks was wide open"
SACK
"Yeah, both of these o-lines are trash today"
23 powned
What the hell did Watson do to piss off his own Center this much?
Jesus Christ deshaun is a beast.
How
That was a great play god damn
Nvm lol
How did that throw arrive?
Come on man
I thought that one was PI
This ad is worse than The Champ is Here. Very 2020
"We need to rally back on offense next drive. Go down field, take time off and score a TD. Field goals will win it but we want to win with confidence!"
Stills smiling at humphrey like he even came close to catching it
Need a stop here. Defense needs to show some fire.
Goddamn it Calais
Nice hold
"We drained 15 minutes of game and kept the margin 10.

I consider this an absolute win."
Noice
This is the way.
"Run the ball, convert with Mandrews on third. Get it done! Letssssss gooooooo!!"
"That, right there, helping up the opponent, is what makes Lamar Jackson an awesome human."
Willie pinballing through the D
SNEEAAAAD
Slippery as a rain drop!
Watt is definitely showing up today
I'm so conflicted. These are two great plays but they are moving down the field faster than my fatass when it's meal time
I want 2 td passes by lamar
Gus is freaking unstoppable
Fuck it go for it
Damn I wish we had a big physical WR like Boldin used to be.
OMG YES
Mark ingram or Lamar jackson? I can't tell
"And this, too, is the way."
BOOM!!!
INGRAM!!!!!
WHAT A PLAY CALL!!!
Let’s goooooooo. Dagger!
Let's fucking gooooo
God I love Mark Ingram!
NO LIO BOI
FUCK YEAH!
I was questioning not getting 3 there but lol @ me.  That was awesome.
30 YARDZ BABY!  Biggg TRUZZZZZZ
THATS BALL GAME BIG BOI!
Mark Mf Ingram!!
HAHAHA FUCK YES INGRAM STILL GOT IT
**INGRAM**
YESSIR
LMAOOOOOOO
Drink to that my brothers!! We can relax now
"What a call, thank the football gods it worked or it wouldve been a terrible call. Am I right boys?"
DER D
Holy shit one of our lineman got their ass handed to them on that last play.
"Make em work for it D, nothing fast"
Ughhhhhh.... this what yall dont need
Is it me or is Ward getting no push on that left side?
Elliot is the enforcer out there.
Cmon defense game ain’t over yet
Not sure if Texans looking good on offense or our defense not on point
I hate this prevent d we're playing
That was actually a really good route by Cobb
Is tht a humphrey sack?
Gotcha!
Deshon szn
I’m glad we’re getting to play a game this physical and seemingly close. Defense needs to fight through the rest of this quarter.
LET'S GET THAT SCORE. GO RAVENS
I really enjoyed the Ingram TD with Lamar at WR and a RB at QB
"Ah, here comes the Pat Mahomes comeback"
I need some GUS in the 4th quarter.
[deleted]
How is Mahomes so good
Chiefs looking at our game so they gotta come back lol
Great stuff. That Ingram run was chef’s kiss
That would have been six if it wasn't for that tackle.
is Jah Reid available?
Damn Mahomes that was a crazy pass
Just no reason for designed Lamar runs in the fourth quarter up 14.
That's a FIRST! WTF REFS!!!
Go for it!
"saved the touchdown

daaamn"
Fuckin Mark needs to finish that block
Send it
Seriously
Big truss here on this call.
I haven't been watching but I assume Herbert's been balling
"If it ends up being short, I don’t think it’s a good idea to go for it even though we’ve been very successful in the past."
Let’s go for it coach!
Challenges make me anxious
Ez
Was that ball game?
WFT coming back a little~
Gus is so fucking good
This dudes got balls the size of Texas
KC roughs the passer on a 3rd down play where it was an incomplete pass
Wind that clock!
is Ingram not fit to play?
They have hardly played Dobbins today
Guys the Bus!!!
Boykin blocking downfield is awesome. Kid is the unsung hero of this run game.
GUS BUS
Gus for MVP
"chill edwards, i can only get so hard"
"fuck it let's see a strike into the endzone here, Brown or Andrews"
Ejection!
Was that #90s second ?
Did the Chargers bench Tyrod for Herbert?
"Gimmie another Lamar TD for fantasy purposes. Would prefer rushing but will settle for passing, I'm not fussy!"
Somebody stay in bounds
Buried
CHUCK
"Ugh, that's Kevin Harlin. He's totally obsessed with me 😏"
"Fuck it -- play action Lamar to Hollywood touchdown!

.../s. Kind of."
Texans quit on themselves
somehow chargers let Mahomes scramble for 21 when they needed 20.
GOOD JOB TEAM
Tavon Young likely out for season...
Few bad plays and we trash again. GTFO fake ass fans.
O-Line needs to get their shit together man. We should be up 27 or 23-7.
"Guys, it’s one bad drive. Reeeelax"
And Tavon might have torn his ACL again.   Another sacrifice to this Bloody Sunday in the NFL.
Not sure why we’ve completely abandoned the run. Ingram and Dobbins just not getting any touches on two drives already
Trash ass offensive line
Blatant fixing by the refs there.
RGIII has the best smile
I don’t think people realise how good Texans D is. We can’t be super human all the time.
I told you guys o-line was gonna struggle. Those of you who downvoted me owe me money.
Just bench Lamar too risky to play him this week. Everyone's going down
pls run the ball
"Trash first drive ,"
"Some guys just have awful luck. Plays in 2nd game since 2018, gets injured again and it doesn't look good."
"Young injured again, big fuckin surprise"
"Dude, Andrews needs to stop jumping."
Just protect the ball pls Lamar
Might want to consider shuffling up the o-line. Looks terrible
"Texans are such a dangerous team. Glad we took the points there but... dang, a TD would've felt great there."
We left our tackling at home
Thanks BoB
Not looking great
Elliot looks slow there
"Where are our corners? This should be an easy strap up man coverage kind of day by Marcus, Marlo, and Jimmy"
I'm really starting to hate the fake crowd noise about as much as I do laugh tracks on network sitcoms.
"LaMaR cAn'T tHrOw

-haters"
Hot Take. Duv is going to be our next Jacoby.
Nice catch by tucker
Nice pass to Tuck
"Put Tucker in, he'll get a td"
I feel like the offense is being too cute rn
"Two possession game after the refs gifting them 3, lmao keep helping them refs they need it"
Hope our O-line shows up for the second half...
Y’all need to settle down lol. The world isn’t going to explode if we don’t score 3 touchdowns per quarter
Everyone is blaming the OL for that sack. That sack isn't the OL's fault.
They’re just driving up and down the field smh
"This game is far from over, especially if they stay uptempo and we play prevent or some nonsense."
Excellent block by Bozeman!!
GO FOR IT
Run the fucking score up fuck RG3 lol
I hate when lamar takes knee’s because it hurts his rushing stats. Dudes gonna take like 50 knees this year and his ypc average will drop a bunch
why was Queen outside guarding 1 on 1 like that?!?!
I honestly expected more from us. Big ups to the Texans for making us earn it.
"Greg Roman you dumbass you need to run, kill clock, and hit the field goal but no you wasted the turnover and now Stanley is injured"
[deleted]
"Man we could see the makings of a bad Oline in the browns game, but now it's really hurting us against a bad team."
"I'm glad the refs can just give free timeouts whenever they want

NFL hates us cause we love our players and support BLM"
Y’all always gotta complain about something huh
Unpopular opinion but I get a lot of entertainment from some of the content on TikTok I'll be sad to see it go
I could care less what they did before the game. I don’t need a kneeling update every week on what the team did and what anthems they did or did not stand for
"Ugh,  4th down :("
The interior oline is still weak I see
Dammit Tavon Young just can't stay healthy.
He can never stay healthy!!!
Tavon and injuries man
"Well, we resigned Jimmy Smith to a one year prove it kind of veteran deal and he yet again can't make the field.


Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Averrett is in instead."
Another year our return game doesn’t exist lmao
"WHY SRE THEY TRYING TO KILL LAMAR, CALL A FUCKING RUN."
"The o line has regressed so much, what a damn shame"
Llama gonna run out of energy by the 2nd quarter RUN THE DAMN BALL
Ready for dubs for both my Ravens and Lakers today
"I'm sad I have to miss the cards and chiefs game because I'm focusing on ours. But at the same time, we the best, so am I really missing out?"
"i don't hate mahomes, i really like him, but i do hope he lays an egg in his game because why on earth is this not the national game."
TUCKER WITH THE GODLY CATCH
Marlon Punch-free
"This is why you run the ball, to freeze their ends and give yourself 3rd and shorts. The play calling hasn’t been good. This game has been all our defence. Our only td came on a 30 yard field. The offence needs to establish the run, idk why we keep passing on 1st and have given dobbins 0 carries. Last time we abandoned the run like this was the playoff game"
There are going to be problems if they bring this play to Pittsburgh
"We don’t need Yanda, it’s week 2. Chill."
Refs trying to bail out the Texans and make this a game.
We’ve played very sloppy and still are up 20-7. We need to wake up now
Learn to wear a mask you fucking ancient zebra cunt
"Any way we can realistically improve our pass rush this season? Like, who we can trade for or something?"
"Not sure how you make that play with him shoving you like that, blatant pi"
You guys are new to Lamar Jackson if you think this O line punishment is new to him. All that chaos is way too familiar to him.
AVERETT with a good play??
If young is out for a while we really should trade to get someone other than everrett
cant have those mistakes right now. Make a play d
Awful throw
Not good for Lamar.  Stay inbounds.
Man do we have the best 1-2-3 RB lineup in the league or what?
The Gus Bus's gas mileage/battery range just went up.
The bus is just working them right now
GUS BUS....CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS
"Where was Andrews all game, wtf?"
Is Stanley still out? Yall Oline ain't holding it down like normal.
Yooo why is Lamar not bailing out?
"This shit is fucking rigged, FFS!"
Texans are just one good drive from making this a one-score game.
Time for some Texan bbq!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hey all!  Getting excited and annoyed b/c CBS dc has not switched over yet .
Anyone have a stream link?
Wait is this happening
Will they wait until the squeelers game ends to start ravens game?
Pit lose soon
I need a link to watch the game can someone help me out?
Squealers still blow
I called out of work for this
they gonna finish the steelers game on cbs before they jump over?
anywhere to stream this?

"As a new fan, are the Texans good or is it gonna be another blowout?"
I too am looking forward to a robust game of football
Oooo got the home jerseys on
Ah ok here we go!
"Watch them fake it lmao
Edit. I'm surprised they actually punted it knowing that they have BoB"
"Ahh, yes. Now I get to see what a good team looks like."
LET'S GOOOOO LAMAR. LET'S GO RAVENS!
"Run, run, run the ball."
Let’s get the running attack going again
Those numbers are insane
The fucking zip on that ball.
LFG
LETS GOOOOOOO
It’s weird hearing the NBA 2K guy announcing football
Atta Boyyyykin
Bruhh
28 TDS 1 INT JFC
awful
Are they even pumping in crowd noise? It's so quiet
FUCKKKKKKK
F
Great
Fuck today
Man
Looks serious
It has to be worth something that he didn’t get carted off and got up pretty quick
Well he was due to get injured in the preseason.... so this is par.
The knees are compromised today
Averett is ok
Good stop
Get ready to watch Averett get burned
Queen is a king
"great stop defense, pray for Tavon!"
Queeeeen
Long live the Queen!
Monstars
Hope Young is Ok.
Let’s go O
What's the most important piece on a chessboard?
ProfootballDoc thinks it’s an ACL injury for Tavon https://twitter.com/profootballdoc/status/1307781548364578816?s=21
Lamar scores  2 td in 6 minutes
Are we not allowed to run today?
Ouch
We're getting close to blocking these punts
bad start for the offense
"Ugh, we NEED Ronnie Stanley..."
Not pounding the rock!  The Hell!!!
Nowhere to go on that play
Ugh
One first down. Let's go.
FUCK YES
Lovely block
Mandrews
Man loves to hurdle
Lamar is my dad Andrews is my papa
BEST TE IN THE LEAGUE
I fucking love Mark Andrews
There we go
Anybody got a working stream?
Nice block by Boykin.
Fucking Mandrews
Lmao y'all have lil truzz
I don't get the play calling thus far
Boykin with a man sized block
Bless you Mandrews
That's more fucking like it
Wtg Mandrews. Now let’s run.
RUN THE BALL!!
RUN THE BALL! HARBS!!! >:(
Is ingrim hurt?
Did the rbs suit up today?
How was that Roby hit on Hollywood not a flag for leading with the crown?!?
Andrews really need to watch the hurdling. He's going to get hurt
Mandrews hurdling brings back bad memories
Mama there goes that Mandrews
RUN DAMMIT
I love boykins block there. How come we havent ran the ball a single time except for the sweep? Running backs?!
Uh run the ball bb
O-line looks baaaaaad so far
Roman you are really confusing me here
Wow. What a throw. Also Oline...how about a second or two?
Did not like that landing from Mandrews.  Me no like helmet hitting ground hard.
Isn’t Lonnie Johnson the guy who misspelled his name on his SAT?
MAndrews! Nice block by Boykin too
Are we just passing vs AFC south teams or what?
Beautiful run by Lamar there.
Lamar nice!!
FINALLY A DECENT RUN
Cool.  Cool.  I think they just needed a series to remember that not every team is the the Browns.
Boykin has much improved
"Fuck, Young's done for the day probably"
Ravens marching!
YES Slants to big body receiver finally!!!
FUUUUCK. Poor Tavon
T Young knee problem....no dah
"Well crap, Young likely done for the day"
"FUCK,  we need Tavon"
Classic lamar right there. Love it
gus almost plowed through that tackle
Tavon Young best nickel CB in the league for 1 game you get out of him a year
Llama is showing off
"Yes, but slide FEET first Lamar..."
Omg lamar is so fucking good
Hold my breath every time he goes face first.
a cleanse of pallet after watching my man burrow try to be lamar lol
Lamar is good
"love gus, even on 3 yard runs"
Good drive by the offense. The defense is getting some good rest with this drive.
3 in a row?
No one went to pick up Lamar :(
lamar fast
Any decent slot corners available? Losing tavon’s a big blow to our depth
Broken ankles!
Cunningham is pretty good it seems
I miss Yanda
Hollywood wants nothin to do with Watt lol
Go for it!
ITWT
we don't seem to be using the fake handoff look that we used a lot last year.
A lot of new fans were not here when every game was within 3 and came down to the last play I see lmaoooo
Houston would have 7 on the board of we had just picked Baker up in the draft. Shit.
Its early in the season they are showing some looks for upcoming teams to study
Defense make a play
Everybody. Don’t care anything else but please stay healthy until the chiefs game.
How is Lamar so young!!!
Run D looks good
But yeah let JK/Ingram run a little
Stuff these fuckers.  Get um off the field
"Least we forced the 4th, no 1st down. But Jeeeeeeezz we need better rush"
"I know tackling Deshaun isn’t easy, but that was awful"
Really suprised that wasn’t blown dead
When did the Texans pick up Russell wilson?
"Shit, I was so stress. Lucky he got out so many tackles, he should've thrown it away like 20 times that play."
Fucking make the tackle
YES
hell yeah!
DEFENSE
"Lol, Watson had no chance"
Big oof
Bill o'brien... wow
Who had the QB pressure?
Trust BoB to make a horrible decision
Let’s go boys!!!
"Unrelated, but where can I get that neck gaiter that Harbaugh's wearing?"
I’m gonna need two TDs to Hollywood for my fantasy team.
I know nobody cares about fantasy but I just traded Watkins for Hollywood minutes before kick off I'm stoked
BoB is gonna BoB
There’s my Ingram
Angry Ingram.
Texans had a mini bye everyone chill
Jk dobbins td incoming
This is a nice drive.
Ram this one in like it's Jenna Jameson.
There's Ingram
Lamar's a gunslinger.
TUDDER
hot damn
Alright D let’s get it
"D just punked em hard, forced the T.O."
Why did the Texans decide not to pump crowd noise?
Wide open
Too much time!!!
Whew.
Just like that
False start??
Damn
Fells eating our lunch
Burn the clock and get the ball back next half and double up on scores
Those passes to the TE who is so much bigger than our DBs....really hard to stop even with perfect coverage. Dunno what you are even supposed to do there.
Pls respond rn Offense we’re fortunate that BoB is an idiot
Stream?
Offsides
"Damn, first flag?  Clean game"
Let’s get it!
DUVERYAY
Jackson’s ability to turn an aggressive blitz against them is just fun to watch
Yes.  Need more Ingram!
We got this
"Move those chains, move those chains, move those chains, HUAA!"
Oh Boy!
Tuck with the catch! Goat
That was harder than it needed to be
Lamar and the receivers are playing great
lot of open receivers down the field.
"Man, he juuuuuust barely got Hollywood"
Damn.
Fuck
Awww
Tucker is so damn good
that show actually looks good to me
Great special teams play by Board
Where the hell is JK DOBBINS TODAY
"This is a good game to get out if sync. Texans are really good and if we can grind this out, it might show some of our coaches and players our deficiencies before the game vs chiefs."
And just like that we run away with it
LET'S FUCKING GO DEFENSE
AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET BACK D!
"FUCKING COWARDS, GIVE MY MAN HIS PICK 6"
FUMBLE TD LETS FUCKING GO!!
"Long Texans drive here for a TD to end the half would be... bad! Let's get hype (for the first time this game), defense."
Just thought to myself we could use a fumble
😍😍😍😍
Fruit Punch is in season
...
please let this stand
FALCON PUNCH
You love to see it!
MARLOOOO LETS GOOO
hey thats a touchdown
LET'S GOOO
Our defence just played right.
He ain't even step out!
MARVIN FOR DEFENSIVE MVP
WOO
Nothing to review here. Ravens ball 🙄
Thats a TD right? Looked good to me
He made a football move after catch the ball it’s a fumble.
Marlon is gonna get his bread soon
TD!
I called it!
td.
Ahhhhh yeahhhh
Let’s go!!!
Big Willy!
Let's do it again
If tavon is out do we sign TJ?
Herbert  winning against mahomes lamar best qb mvp
Fuuuck yes!
Can't let them score here. Need to go for the throat early
LFG
LETS FUCKING GOO
Watson slightly overrated!?!?! Hmmm....
End it here
No one even close to open
Guys when did Ed Reed come back wearing 24?
Watt is just fucking terrorizing is god damn
Got damn O Line
JJ owns our line when we play in NRG
brown kinda stopped onn watt a little  early
Need to get OBJ some Boyle help
Brown gotta move his feet there
"""FG Target Line""  Is that corrected for Tucker?"
Let’s get enough for at least a fg
"I like a TD here, but if we only get 5 yards and a FG I’m happy"
It’s JJ Watt. Dude is a fucking beast. Not surprised.
Oh God
I MEAN SHIT O LINE
"Man, O line is getting torched"
Fuck
CAN WE NOT
"Don't ruin our chance to see tucker kick a really long FG. It's not fair, JJ."
What’s with all the pass plays?
"Damn, why Yanda"
God damnit
Dobbins missed that block.
Bro our Oline nooo 😞
FUCK
He looks fine
"Ronnie pls be okay.

We love you ya big bear!"
Not that the online has been stellar but that was an all out blitz
Ronnie Stanley’s ankle again
No points for them cmon stop them here
Offense hasn't felt as dominant on the Texans side of the field as I'd like to see.
All these people crying about these sacks but lamar ain’t drop the ball most qbs would have dropped that ball
These TEs are killing us.
Finally a sack!
Looks like the Texans woke up
Cmon defense...
Obviously I'm not a coach but if they're rushing the linebackers and we have very fast WR why don't we run them down the middle?
I hope Stanley is okay
🤦🏽‍♂️
"instead of clock running out, now it stops."
Dammit
Averrett is trash. I don't want anyone to convince me otherwise.
Int calling it by clark
Averett is a fast frank walker
okay didn't see the ref kick it. i'll allow it.
Thats fucking crazy
Still blame the lack of a rush.
Bull shit
Skura is just a shadow of his former self. Absurd to play him in the condition he is in.
Just saw a local political commercial that was [LITERALLY this](https://youtu.be/SW-JocxB15U) but with wrestling techniques instead of guns. So so dumb.
COLLUSION
Great protection there
Wow the line held up lol
"Lamar had time, he needs more"
Cunningham is everywhere
Roman run the damn ball
Hey guys a run!!!!
GUS THE BUS
He really do be looking like a bus sometimes
"Ok, as much as I've been loving seeing Jackson's upgraded passing abilities it's nice to see some running too!"
 This is why we should be running
HONK HONK
THE BUS IS ROLLING
Gus running mfs over!!!
The Gus bus stops for no one
"If there werent other guys around, Gus would have 100% broken that tackle on his previous run."
"Ingram might not be as fast as he used to, but he still runs hard"
Played WR at Notre dame.
Always forget how explosive Gus is
Gus should get ever 2 yards to gain even time
"Look at that stat, fuckin beautiful.

These Ravens are something special."
Lamar doing work with the snap count
I'll take that
Hollywood deep
Lamar tapping into that Brady/Rodgers energy. Get those free yards! Make them think twice about jumping the snap count.
Gus doesn’t get enough recognition man
"&#x200B;

Lamar making ESPN Highlight  Reels"
are you all happy you got your planned run with lamar now?
JK IS IN
KEEP HIM IN YOU FUCKS
GOOD JOB DOBBINS!!
I love that from jk
Damn I can't believe he stayed up for that.
"Fucking right dobbins

Thats some rice shit right there"
Sick tackle break JK
atta boy Dobs
Nice fucking play dobbins
Way to stay on your feet jk
Nice job!
DOBBINS. Making plays
"Oof, Lamar..."
Let's go jk
FEED JK
What offense are we running?!? Air Coryell?
I'm not looking these called qb runs. Haven't worked well but once
Finally got Dobbins involved!!!
GOOD SHIT JK
JK!
JK out here turning cbs into fools
JK lol
What a catch and run
Is something wrong with Ingram?
Jk but we ain’t joking
Exactly what I'm talking about. No way we let gus go with JK. Perfect 1-2 punch
reminded me of another 27 with that
"When our run game is working, we are almost unstoppable."
That was a money throw.
:/
NEED A TD TO HOLLYWOOD HERE
Dobbins is so fucking good
McKinney turned pretty freaking late on that one
Jesus fucking Christ online is total shit today
Gimme 3
SMHHH
i want an o-line plz :(
Where's the line...
 Pain
Line looks fucking awful
God damn this o-line sucks
Whew close one there Tuck
Shew that was close. Good time eating drive and points at least
Is Ronnie playing or is he still on IR?
Bruh it’s 2020 why is James Harrison in commercials
Our line looks a bit slow processing stunts. Hopefully it improves as the rook gains experience and these guys get more playing time together
Queen go zoom
Our running game hasn’t looked good that last two weeks
McPhee looked 24 there!
He down.
How tf does Phee still play songs hard
Watching the ticker 49ers lost a few players today eh? Jesus
ah fuck
oh boy.
We need to get this oline together and need an actual pass rusher with some speed.
Almost.
"1 offense TD feels bad, hope we can get one more and sure up the game"
Calais noooo
Fuckk
We finally stopped their offense
yesss baby yoda
"Ok, that was the hand-off deception I've been missing so far."
Be careful Mark 🙏🏽
Thays mah boy
[deleted]
Hell yeah In fg Range
"Lol, everyone thought Washington was gonna be good this year"
here we go long clock burning TD drive
I love this announcer lol
SNEAD
Perfect.  QBs draw and quick slant to Snead.  That’s how to slow down the rush.
I hate when they say shit that jinx us. Don't talk about the damn no turnovers!
Dobbins wide open on the dump off
Line is really struggling with those interior stunts.
Thats what you get when you don't wrap up for literally no reason.
GO FOR IT
Oof he needed a few big Macs for that
Llammmmma
5 wides go for it
Fucking right!!!
Fortune favors the bold.
WOW WHAT A PLAY CALL
THE BIG FELLA
Wildcatttttttt babyyyyy!
BLACKJACK 21!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THAT'S HOW YOU BLOCK
LMAO WOW
game
The road to 2-0
Hell yeah let's go for it coach!
Hit that bull Ingram!
YEP
LMAO let's fucking go!!!!!
BIG BOI SHIT
LETS GO MARK!!
Poor Giants.
Alright D. Please no points
[deleted]
Cmon D!
Come on defense dont do that
Marlon Humphrey a slot CB?
Jesus another obvious missed hold
apparently Sammy Watkins suffered a  *possible* concussion in todays game.
Can we keep playing aggressive? A lot of time left
i would not wanna be watson there and have campbell fall on you
Bowser in coverage?
Another sack whiffed.
How did whoever that was miss that sack
That block by project Pat on the Ingram TD... Amazing
I'd like to see the O-line and the RBs get some real-time chemistry going for the rest of this game. We're going to want/need it at some point.
Justin Reid is very good
Damn that was a clutch stop on Lamar ngl
go for it
Surrender Index is gonna flame us hard if we punt
"Anybody know if the neck gaiter Harbs has is avail for purchase? Can't find it on any of the main sites (NFL Shop, fanatics, fansedge).

Also, solid overall game! Go Ravens!"
Look like LLAMA said I’ll do it myself lmao
"Not worth it, that’s how Mahomes got hurt"
The cardboard fans are kinda creepy
"I wonder why lamar doesn't have audibles like Mahomes does. Yknow how Mahomes says ""35"" to signify snap it on 2? Lmao"
I want us to score 7 more! I don't want to see us let up. Let's make a statement that even on our off days we're better than most AFC teams.
Let's make it 37!
GUS
Score again
One more score and put this thing to bed.
Can we just start with the Gus Bus from now on? Like let the man ram that Dline a bit then swap in Ingram & Dobbins to get loose on em then let Gus carry the team home.
Wildcat Dobby
Did he hit Lamar late?
its not an officials timeout...they were waiting until the ejected player left the bench area  before resuming play
Uhhh? Okay?
"buh bye, bud"
Lamae ts plz
O line got it done on this drive
Lamar td plz
"Well, now it is time for KC.  It is on!  Big Time!"
Go ahead with your bad self Chuck Clark!!!
David Johnson single-handedly stripped the “sack daddy” monicker
Gg
"Someone said 90 was stomping Lamar's head, is that true because wth"
Best back drafted this year
Did we play Gus so much as cover for the Chiefs?
Dam we make it look to easy
Now I just want them to put in Justice Hill to get his pounding in against the Texans
WW
How do OT rules work again?
Bowser is looking look so far he’s been very active in these first 2 games always seems to be around the ball maybe 7+ sacks this season...also Boykin on offense but LJ has so much weapons
Tavon Mr Glass Young SMDH
That wasn't great. Let's just hope it was a rusty start
"Man, I’m hoping it’s rust, but our Oline hasn’t been good. Squeelers will eat this line alive..."
This is a closer game than it should be. Weird play calls and a shaky O line really not making me feel good
[deleted]
I fucking hope nobody falls injured here
Damn
"That series was uninspired, lol."
It didnt look like anything even touched him.
Tayvon Young hurt again? Wouldnt be surprised.
Roman calling this game way too cute. Run the god damn ball on first down.
roman passing too much just like in the titans game
Boykin is such a good ass blocker
Sometimes I forget how spoiled we are with Lamar
Lamar needs to start sliding feet first
Need stream plz.  My power went out. No direct tv for me :(
Boyle's block game needs help
That wasn't holding?  Ok
Yea I've lost hope for this offensive line.
Oline doesn’t look good
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/028/539/DyqSKoaX4AATc2G.jpg
Why make the Texans do anything? Why not give them 3 points and call it halftime?
Rushing is not working at all which sucks
Boykin the tightend
Play calling is horrendous
I really want to see Fluker. Just to see if he can make a difference. He looked good last week.
"Fuck with out those turnovers our defense really isn't that good. So many wide open targets, no pass rush, can't finish tackles in the back field, letting deshaun finish plays, things that will not pass against playoff teams"
Has there been an update on Tavon?
"Lol Houston fucking sucks, so mad there’s a 7 seed now, they may make the playoffs"
YOU CANT PARK THAT BUS
Great block from Boykin!!
Oh yeah boy! Let's get that run game working!
"We're getting lucky with the turnovers tbh, this defense is suspect"
Little off today. Texans D not quite that good.
"Throw short on 3rd. Flacco, is that you?"
We’re also up 13 points so yeah while the O-line play is frustrating I really doubt we lose this game.
I’m very nervous for this game. Our pass rush is god awful and watson is a magician. I also think our run defense is lackluster. I’m nervous for every game though. We’ll probably win by 3 scores lmao
Fucking hell Tavon Young Mr Glass needs to be cut... He doesn't do anything for us besides leave us hanging
Why the fuck can't our defense play defense right
This is probably the least hype I’ve been for a Ravens game in a while lol
Can someone PxP?
"clearly lamar took notes from kyler murray, the GOAT of getting out of bounds. r/nfl had some great advice."
OBJ getting used and abused by Watt
defense looks shaky
"Haven't caught the game today, but from what I've seen a bit it seems Lamar is a bit off and so is the line"
"The fact that it takes 50 people to tackle 1 person is concerning, otherwise good D! xD"
Can't believe we're winning a ~~home~~ game 30-16 in the 4th quarter and these dorky ass doofus' in the booth spent more time talking about other teams' QB's
Sorry ass pass rush
Does anyone else think Watt is a huge douche?
never was a fan of T. Young. dude is too small for a CB
Watson sucks....Big money for medicore play
Do we want the Chiefs coming in after a loss? I can't imagine them 1-2
are we going to see RGIII?
"Idk what game y’all are watching. Oline looked much better that drive. Held the pocket for Lamar on most throws and had good run block. The only bad play was the sack and they blitzed.

So many casual fans."
Gonna be honest. Lamar has made the OL look worse on a number of plays. This is looking like the steelers game. He's seeing ghost rushers.
Our defense. 😂😂😂
"I hope they don't try to draw a pentaly.

You could pull that shit with cleveland, but this defense is way too disciplined to do that."
where to watch?
Lamar carrying rn
Bwhahahahaha
Been watching RedZone during commercials and all I can say is Andy Reid must really hate how he looks in a mask to go with the shield again.
Where was marlon going lol he just got up and ran the other way
Offense looks sluggish today.
jj watt make the executive decision to start juicing again.
"Man... the pocket was good, there. Lamar ran into a sack"
So sad that there is no ravens football next Sunday
Smh
Why are we not running?
Fade me
"Can’t take a sack there, NGL, i was thinking hand it off and try a long fg. Lost 3 points."
anyone else just watch peters get fucked up? lmao
Wow we give our running backs the ball and it works who woulda thought
Lol go for it /s
Shit. Gotta punt imo
lol random challenge
Why the fuck Is BoB calling timeout
Beep beep BUSSSSS
GUS BUS!!
Feed the bus.
Wheels on the bus going round and round right now
THE BUS
Pat is such a boss
These refs are so fucking incompetent
Is it sexist if I say Melanie Collins is hot?
If we lose Stanley....... next week is a done deal loss
Lamar is panicking in the pocket . We NEED the o line to step up to calm lamar
Too much Lamar running.
"What is Lamar doing? Do you see the blitz? Get out of the pocket, dude."
Can you guys not start blaming the refs? That was an obvious penalty on Averett. He sucks.
Shades of Roman's playcalling against Tennessee
Tavon Young...going to be a meniscus or ACL
Who is this play by play announcer? Pretty annoying
There is no way they were snapping that ball. Waste of a timeout.
We should have at least tried the hard count before throwing the challenge flag
That’s shameful how did they possibly not get Watson
Is it me or has Calais just not looked like his pro bowl season last year?
How are we beating KC next week
These dumbass mistakes are going to doom us
All the hype just for 2 3 & outs by both teams 😂
Aww go for it
"Honest question.
How can we afford to pay Stanley 22mil when the other 3 or 4 positions on our line are so bad against good pass rushes.
Wouldn't it make more sense to trade stabley, draft a o line piece and pay someone who commands less 12-15"
Jackson needs to do a better job of handing the ball off on the read option
Is this an unpopular opinion? I don't really think Proche is that great as a returner
"Imagine being Lamar Jackson and instead of scrambling you collapse in the pocket.. SMFH

Edit: thanks for the downvotes, but yall know I'm right"
Stanley hurt now. Dude is so weak.
What team is going to trade us for a corner this year? Cause me thinks we need one
Terrible Kick!  He almost missed!
Alright. That State Farm commercial was pretty good. Lol
[deleted]
We’re going to get Lamar hurt. We need to stop doing designed runs for him when it’s not necessary and he also needs to slide
Going to lose...

Goodluck. He will just take his all pro self and go to another team.

If your playing the Chiefs that showed up today Chiefs have zero chance beating you.

Can't wait for DeCosta to snag some great OL for a 9th round pick. That's where the team needs it the most. Thankfully Lamar has been so calm in the pocket

BoB trading his #1 target is still baffling
I sorta feel sorry for Watson. He’s so legit and is with a  coach/GM that is gonna waste his youth.
"I like watson. He's got great pocket presence and can extend plays.

BoB is just a dipshit ruining his and jj watts careers"
I feel so bad for him
"I've loved Deshaun since he was at Clemson, and he deserves so much better than he's been given in Houston. BoB is on-track to waste a once-in-a-generation QB's career just like Indy did with Luck, and it's a fucking tragedy."
That trade of DeAndre Hopkins was epic stupidity
He looked so dejected that entire game.
"His talent is being wasted.. He deserves better than what he's getting!!!
I feel bad for him.  I can never talk bad about him.."
He should’ve never re-signed with Texans. They are gonna waste his career.
That's life in the NFL somebody is going to lose
I'm rooting for him fr
The game thread was so shocked over how evasive he was. I hold my breath every drop back. I really don’t get why people think he’s overrated.
My mom laughed louder each time they showed him frozen in rage and said it needed to be a meme
"I wouldn't have signed the extension if I was him. Even if he outlasts BOB, chances are the next HC won't be significantly better and the organisation will continue to mismanage the pesonnel around him."
"#The rules are simple:

* **Submit a player/coach/position group**, preferably **in BOLD** to stand out easier. Add stats/reasoning if you want.

* Make sure your nominee has not already been submitted. 

#**Previous Weeks**

* Week 1: Lamar Jackson

#**This week's nominees are...**"
"**Marlon Humphrey**

Right hook from Marlon swung the momentum completely and the Texans never recovered."
"**MARCUS PETERS, MARLON HUMPHREY, LJ FORT and PATRICK QUEEN**"
"The Runningbacks!

Ingram with the swifty 4th down TD

Edwards with a bunch of backbreaking runs 

Dobbins with the nice 44 yard run to get us over 200 again"
"***Justin Tucker***

He didn’t need to score a game winner, but we haven’t given him the opportunity to often (thankfully). 

His consistency is easy to overlook and take for granted but he kept the distance which is crucial as we play best with a lead. So even when the offense couldn’t get it done he got us some guaranteed points."
Tucker for always being reliable!
"Gus Edwards.  That drive was the backbreaker.  

Don't get me wrong, defence made plays like crazy, but it was that drive where I wrote 'Game over' in my notebook."
"#Marlon Humphrey

Led the team in tackles (6 solo + 1 assist) and the clutch forced fumble"
"Lamar Jackson.

Im 100 percent convinced he makes this offensive line look decent. If its any other QB we would have given up 10+ sacks. Put Fluker out there at RG and help Orlando. That right side was ABUSED today"
"Overall, Gus. But Fort's play really turned the tide in our favour and he flashed in other plays as well."
"Lamar. Dude kept so many offensive drives alive, especially in the first half. His stats are good but he played so much better than they say."
DEFENSE ^(^Other ^Than ^Anthony ^Averett)
DeCosta for gems signings like Fort
MP Juice Man
The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down
So many people here are posting about the running backs but how about my boy **Patrick Ricard** blocking for all of them and opening up some massive holes to run through? Not to mention his layout goal-line grab for the TD!
The Gus Bus. Making no stops and taking no prisoners since 2018.
Team
Defense
defense!
All running backs
Defense: Made plays when it mattered and held our lead
While we had a good game and good players. The O-Line got pummeled today. Albeit some of those were because of Lamar running around but still. Gotta hold them boys back.
"Everyone for sure. Lamar being Lamar, all the running backs putting in work, MP and Humph being great, Tucker not missing as usual. Not much to criticise other than you know who"
"Another **team win**

Humphrey killed it, Lamar did great, Ingram had an excellent run TD, jk with a game killing run, gus controlling the clock, fort picking up the fumble, Juiceman with the int, elliott stoping that 4th down and a sack.

Everyone played well and still we got stuff we know to work on."
"**SECONDARY** (not named Anthony Averett)

Marlon and Peters played lockdown coverage all game, and each came up with a backbreaking turnover. Elliott had his first sack, Chuck kept everyone in position, and Jimmy played well in his limited role."
"LJ fort, looked like a rb on that pylon extension. That defensive TD is what first allowed us to pull away and we didn’t look back"
"DEFENSE

Whole squad effort.

PQ looking like royalty. Marlon swinging harder than Myles Garrett. LJ Fort taking it to the house. MP Juiceman out there pickin like it's apple season.

I thought some of Lamar's throws were a bit shaky today and OL was slacking, but that's why this is a **team**. Our receivers made plays, defense stepped it up, and as always Tucker gets it in.

*Lamar wasn't bad by any means, and did a fantastic job dealing with the pressure of an incredible Texans D. I meant moreso some of his passes were just on the edge and required good moves from our receivers. The Ricard TD that was a bit low comes to mind. At this point our competition is only ourselves and perfection is the standard we go by 😤*"
Peters
Defense....does that count?
MARCUS PETERS
"Offense: Gus
Defense: Fort"
Greg Roman. Gut punch with Ingram wildcat completely demoralized the Texans. They were shell shocked after that.
"Lamar and the run game?

That OL, in particular the right side did them no favors. Lamar was super fucking comfortable under pressure like usual and was on point even though he couldn't go deep like he wanted. Gus, Mark and JK (albeit late but man that fucking run was electric) were on fire"
"Fort has fumble recoveries in back to back weeks and this one he turned on the jets, Let the big man get this one"
Running backs
**Gus Edwards**
"**Defense**

Lots of good plays and turnovers from them. Took a while to get some sacks but they eventually came through."
Running backs
Going defense on this one. Creating turnovers and getting pressure on Watson.
RB's
*Gus Edwards*
Peters
"**Marcus Peters**

That was a great interception.  You could give it to a bunch of guys as it's a true team effort this time, but I'm fine with spotlighting Peters."
"I'm going to say Boykin.  he didn't have the best game statistically, but his presence was felt on the field, at times he was invisible last year as a pass catcher. run blocks well."
"Ingram,  for the roundhouse kick and fooling a lot of us thinking that Lamar got slow somehow."
"I can't pick just one, so I'm going with...Our Pro Bowl CB duo.

**Marlon Humphrey** & **Marcus Peters**

I don't think Marlon allowed a single completion and both contributed to turnovers. Plus the Peters INT was thing of beauty."
"LJ needs some credit

Of course it's a team win, but Fort did a total tempo shift with the scoop and score. 

Humphrey, Lamar, the game plan, JK ...they all work. They always work.

Fort's instincts and good angles and pure footballin got the game going the right direction! 

Lf'ing J Fort"
The entire defense
"**Marlon Humphrey**

The punch. Played great coverage all game. And was bringing the energy. The way he attacked the lead blocks on one of the plays had me HYPED"
Marlon Humphrey and Patrick Queen
Marlon Humphrey/MP JUICE MAN
"One half of the best cornerback duo:

 Marlon ""Fruit Punch"" Humphrey"
"I vote for the secondary, they did a great job slowing down Houston’s WR core and allowed our front 7 to go to work. Marlon had the big forced fumble, Peters that ed reed like interception, and Elliot with that sack."
"Gus Edwards, Marlon Humphrey, Marcus Peters, L.J. Fort, Lamar Jackson and Calais Campbell are the players of the game candidates and the Emmy goes to.....

....... L.J. Fort"
"For me, it would be the cornerbacks, and Tucker obviously."
"Marlon Humphrey. Forced a fumble that led to the game-breaking TD, and made Fuller non-existent."
Wink martindale- For the second year in a row he had the perfect game plan to stop deshaun Watson. Coverage was excellent and he devised a good blend of blitzes so Watson had no time to throw.
Marcus Peters. Channeling Ed Reed on that pick...
[deleted]
233 I think before the kneel downs so I think we ended up with 230 total
"As far as I know he is an impending free agent after the season. . . 

I feel that we have to retain this guy. He’s fit in well with the scheme and Lamar, just wanted your thoughts on retaining him for next season"
"Honestly hes amazing, but RB is the one position where we can lose a guy due to our depth. Ingram, JK, and Hill are an amazing trio if Gus leaves. Just depends on how much money he wants"
"Give me Gus over Hill. 

Haven’t really been impressed with Hill."
Yeah he’s worth more to us than he is in a trade. Next year it’ll be JK and Gus 1 and 2. Cut Ingram to save cap space but maybe he’ll resign/restructure on a cheaper team friendly deal.
[deleted]
He’s a RFA next year
"Gus probably gets a deal on some other team, we dont have the cap to go for him. We probably pick up a RB day 2 or 3 if not another UDFA. It is sad but with c ap dropping so much and the paydays we have to make he doesnt fit in the books."
"I’ll say Gus is a killer late in a game, with the fresh legs we provide him."
honestly for the future i’ll take gus over ingram cause mark us getting old
"I really think EDC would be amiss to not resign him. He's a great 1b - 2 back and his 1 cut power style REALLY fits us on 3rd and short.

He's got great vision between the guards and fights for yards.


I'd really like to resign him to a deal similar to Kareem Hunts. You then match him with JKs contract"
"Gus is a RFA.. prolly pull 3-5mill/yr in free agency.. 

Ingram is gonna cost 6.33 next year.. can save 5 mill with cut.. but can prolly pay him whatever we would have to pay Gus to keep him..

Justice is gonna be cheap still.. 

Probably trade Gus to the Jets to replace Bell.. extend Ingram.. keep Hill and Dobbins.."
I saw Ingram shaking his head and talking to someone on the sideline on his last run. It’s pretty clear mark thought he shoulda scored but it seems like Gus is more worried about contact or just doesn’t have the elusive necessary. No one may have notice but mark points to his head and you can tell it’s regarding Gus not being a very innovative or creative back.

"As bad as this sucks for him, we gotta restructure that contract. Paying him lots to never play a full season."
3 missed full seasons now?
"Really feel for the guy, hopefully Averett can step up because he was getting dotted up all game"
The best ability is availability.
"Well, he only has season ending injuries so I didn't expect anything less"
Dude needs to retire
"Tavon is a great player but at a certain point out for the season just becomes who you are, 3 of these now idk how much he's got left"
Are you fucking kidding me. That's just shy of 2 full seasons missed in two seasons.
Man Tavon is such a baller CB. He plays way bigger than his size and was an incredible find. I wish he would get rid of whatever luck is plaguing him.
So can we go get Carr back from the Cowboys practice squad? I dont want to see Averett on the field trying to stop any of the Chiefs receivers next week...
Time to restructure that contract
Come on....god dammit
What else is new
This sucks
Really unfortunate for him
Fuck this!!
What team is tanking? so we can pry their slot corner away for a 5th
I feel fucking terrible for him. Can't even imagine what he's going through
"I'm not sure he should be cut next year right off the bat, but at this point we've got to plan as if he's not in the depth chart."
bro he’s good but he gets hurt so much he’s missed over 30+ games now he should retire
Dude can’t catch a break. Next man up
Hate to say it but he can’t be relied on. He shouldn’t be on the roster at the start of next season.
"FUCKKKK, this one hurts"
"It certainly seems destined that Tavon Young & DeShon Elliott are not supposed to play together. Whenever one *is* healthy, the other one is injured. Ever since Tavon's contract extension, he has played a grand total of one full game. That signing sure looks like one of DeCosta's worst decisions as GM, right up there with the ET3 debacle!

It is a shame, because he is a pretty special player when available. However, it feels as if he has been injured more than Jimmy Smith & Lardarius Webb combined (I'm exaggerating, of course). Yet another reminder why Brandon Carr should have never been let go! Too bad they had to learn this inevitable, predictable lesson the hardest way possible!"
">On February 21, 2019, Young signed a three-year, $25.8 million contract extension with the Ravens, making him the highest-paid nickel-back in the NFL.


Can't predict injuries but this hurts"
Really sucks but hes gotta get cut next yr. He was one of my favorites on D too
yep i knew he'd get hurt he gets hurt every year
Should have resigned Carr. CB getting super thin
This is probably the end. Sucks so bad. Really liked the dude.
"Couldn’t watch the game live, how’d it happen?"
"Anyone know how much we’d save? Wasn’t his contract right up there at the time? I feel for the guy, but with zero production we need that money for Stanley/Humphrey/Andrews etc"
5th round pick for The Jets best Cornerback...incoming!!!
"Well that sucks. And with the cap being extremely tight next year, I can definitely see him being on the chopping block. 

It's a shame, but I think he's going to end up being one of the great ""What If's"" in team history."
They gotta cut him at this point. It's every single year
Cut him forever who cares how good he is if he is injured for 50% of his career
"There absolutely cannot be any other franchise that has ever been more ravaged by constant injuries to secondary members than what our favorite team has gone through for approximately a decade-plus! But hey, who cares about a guy that never missed a game in his career, just let him leave. I pine for Brandon Carr over Anthony Averett, but those pipe dreams are long gone!"

"How do you get that effort from your team and just hand the Chiefs the ball. Stopped on 4th and 1 or punted to the Chiefs 1 yardline you lost the game, so don't take it out of your players hands."
You can’t give them the ball back.  Plain and simple.  Conservative football loses against the Chiefs offense.
Talking about this guy like hes 1 of a kind 😂
That's exactly what I was thinking
Yeah I usually love Romo but that was just a stupid statement from him.
Wish you would've posted the context. No idea what you're talking about.
"As much a I love to hear the goat getting respect, butker is literally the next one in line for career % after him. So one of a kind, no, but not many as good as him. Tucker just happens to be better."
"The main issue is that the Ravens don't have to settle for those king attempts very often, meaning Tucker can't show case his skills as often."
They all want Tuckers spot but they can't have it
The chiefs sub really believes his comments to like no one could ever hit a 58 yard fg lmao
I'm fine with that. Let them forget Tucker is the Ravens best kept secret in the NFL
I mean he’s paid to talk about the teams and players he’s there commenting for.
Whats the big deal? Let em enjoy their win..They didn't disrespect Tuck..
I think we are taking this too personally.

Trade for a db? Sign a free agent? Or bring a guy up from practice squad? Give me your thoughts
"If we base it off history, we’ll probably trade our washing machine for Jaire Alexander"
Sign Lamar Jackson. Right now.
Jimmy will go to CB and we’ll likely promote from within at reserve safety. Levine will play a lot more in dime packages.
I mean he was out all of last season too no?
Once Carr goes back down to PS (I think he was pulled up against this week) I say we sign him on Monday and bench Averett.
"We play football. 

I mean Young was out all of 2019 and 2017. We played the Chiefs last year with Carr, Averett, and Canady and lost on a 3rd down conversion. 

I think we will be fine."
"Maybe josh nurse, who was having a pretty good offseason, could be promoted within and play nickel?"
Trade a 5th round pick for Strap Harris

"Sounds like yet another season ending injury early in the season. That’s 3 out of 5 seasons. 

Sucks man. Just hate it for him."
"This is unpopular but he needs to be gone. Yeah he's good, really good. I like him. But he's never available. 3/5 years with season enders is too much and we can't afford to pay him for that."
He needs to go man he’s eating up too much cap space to be constantly injured.

He said he was kidding after. Torrey is too nice.

Aww man.  It’s devastating for the kid.  All the talent in the world and the body just can’t hold out.  I can’t imagine the frustration.  Cut him a break.
"No need for this IMHO. The guy has played well and hard for us and rehabbed from multiple injuries. 

Not his fault that hes hard luck. 

Sometimes Im embarrassed by my fellow fans."
Bro delete this.
"As we are used to being delighted with over 30 pts per game almost every week since last year, however, today, the o line being out of groove almost costed things on offense and if this would've happened against a better team there's no doubt we would've lost this game.

I like to focus on the fact that the game was won and that's all it matters, but it's becoming a serious concern that the offensive line will start affecting play calling and what can be done on offense.
The offense wasn't able to take any deep shots or call any deep, long developing plays since the pass rush was too intense, which immediately took an effect on what Hollywood and Andrews bring to the table, Ingram struggled a lot at beginning, same with Lamar which seemed to bump into sacks since the guys in front were literally being pushed back. I'm hoping since they'll have an extra day of rest this next week they can clean this up otherwise the Chiefs defense can make life difficult for them (Not that they're an elite defense but they're pretty damn good if given the opportunity and their opponent is caught slacking)."
What's most important is how much better Lamar's passing is. He's throwing absolute zingers all day.
"Good points, but most teams don’t have a Garret/Watt wrecking shit either. Those two are elite talents.  Let’s see what happens against more pedestrian lines before sounding the alarms."
"I know I'm not the only one when I say that this felt like the least rewarding win we've had in a very long time. Hardly feels like a win at all, and to me, that's because of everything you just mentioned above. 

It felt like the last two seasons with Joe Flacco and Marty, nothing but dump offs and a few check downs. Our line effectively ensured that Mark Andrews, Brown and the rest of our textbook Corp was effectively out of the entire game. 

Oh, and also, where the FUCK was Dobbins this entire night besides his 40 yard scamper in garbage time??? Did he have a bad week of practice or something? What gives?

Also, we are NOT going to be win like this against the chiefs or Washington with our line so suspect."
I felt at times Lamar was doubting himself on the rush attempts. A couple times I felt he was in two minds.
"Unpopular opinion: The OL wasn't as bad as it seemed on passing plays.

I thought lamar ran into 2 sacks and was indecisive on a third. Unlike week 1 & most weeks, I thought lamar was feeling too many ghost pressures while not reading the leverage of pass rushers which led to sacks. For instance, tyre Phillips had his man blocked on one play. Lamar scrambled in a way that allowed the DL to uncover and sack him. Tyre went from doing a good job pass blocking a guy to ""allowing"" a sack because his qb ran into the defender's path.

The Texans did a good job squeezing the pocket with their ends. However, we've seen lamar move brilliantly in the pocket in situations like that in the past. Today, lamar looked like the lamar we saw in the steelers game last yr. 

Also, I thought jj watt in particular was great at readingand attacking the mesh point.

Either way, lamar still had an efficient and productive day. He is a great player. I just thought he made the OL's job harder than it should've been today in a few instances.

The OL's run blocking on the other hand wasn't good in the first half."
""
"Honestly, there’s no one who consistently gets the short end of the stick as much as Tyrod. I really doubt Herbert doesn’t start after that performance. Sending all positive vibes to him, but man just terrible luck in his career. 

Selfish: Would love to have him back in Charm City if anything happens to RGIII"
He looked terrible last week and Herbie looked real good today. He won't be the starter
Tyrod is not good. He is a backup.
If anyone watched it breaks my heart to see Boyle apparently doesn't get along with Humphrey.
"I think it’s just a joke between Marlo and Boyle, cause if I’m not mistaken Marlon always calls him a “jerk” and maybe Boyle gets a lil hurt from it, but I don’t think they DON’T get along."
Haven't seen it but who cares. I have disliked a lot of coworkers over the years. You can't like everyone
I think it’s a mixture and of things. You’ve got a quiet ass white guy around a bunch of hype high energy black guys. Their energy doesn’t match at all. I don’t think it’s as big of a problem as it seems tho.
It didn’t seem like anything to me
"Unpopular opinion: Marlon strikes me as the kind of guy I would hate to be around every day.

That said he's a baller ass corner so who cares what my perception of him is based on limited social media insight."
I honestly felt so awkward watching that. It really seemed like Boyle and Andrews hated Marlo.
Why what happened?
"Man its the first I'm hearing about it, but we don't need to more beef or drama in the locker room after the earl Thomas shit"
Damn thats whack lol

"My god man.  The browns have Garret.  The Texans have Watt.  Those two are game wreckers + the rest of the talent on those lines.  Ravens O-line isn’t elite, but it’s certainly not time to sound the alarms yet."
Found the fan that didn’t sit through 2013-17
Duv didnt score
"We are 2-0.. I doesnt matter if you win by 1 or 30...A win's a win. As a matter of fact: How does a win feel like a loss? 🤔🤔🤔🤔
You fans need a damn Snickers.."
"All those problems and we still won by 3 scores. Which tells me we will probably be okay.

Also Duv didn't score."
"the opponent is allowed to make plays, they are professional athletes too"
"If out-gaining our opponent by 100 yards, controlling the clock, and doubling the scoreboard is getting exposed... expose me 14 more times. We just took 3 knees inside their 30 to win fella. Sober up."
Chill it’s week 2 🤦🏼‍♂️
"Man I literally just sat here watching the game and said out loud.. I still can't figure out how to feel about putting up 30 pts a game consistently.. it's such a change from every year ever. No matter how bad the o-line play was, or how lethargic it seemed.. you still gotta bring at LEAST a 30 bomb to stay in touch with Lamar..so far the only teams averaging that besides us is the Packers and Seahawks, and most likely the Saints after tomorrow..

Then you look at the defense and the Packers and Hawks are giving up 22.5 pts a game vs our 11 pts a game.. next best defense is the Raiders giving up 15 a game..

Point is.. we are the most balanced team in the NFL bringing the most explosive offense with a TOUGH defense, neither has to be perfect and can give a little which is what you saw the last two weeks.. Garrett and Watt both did what they get paid for.. some of the best in the game.. on offense Chubb and Hunt are gonna get their yards on ANY night.. Watson is gonna make plays and try to win.. but nobody is putting it all together like we are right now.."
you can't fault the O line for giving up the hits to lamar by JJ. JJ is a top echelon defensive player who is capable of making any O line break down. it just is what it is. they'll get better but i'm certainly not gonna fault em for not being able to stop jj watt.
"Holy fuck.....

We got some fans on here actually complaining about the offense. Not that they played poorly, just that they didn't play good enough, despite scoring 30 points. Like...I honestly never believed that day would come. I'm an old school Ravens fan, I remember production like this was rare and appreciated. So I'm a little shocked at some of the posts I'm seeing. It's not in big numbers, yet. 

But I would like to remind old and new fans just how good we have it right now. Old fans that are complaining, remember boller and streaky flacco. That's all I'll say, new fans. Take it easy, it's 33 points. Against what I consider to be a good team, so hopefully this post puts some of the complaints I'm seeing into perspective. 

We are lucky to have Lamar.

Edit. Furthermore, the chiefs didn't do too well on offense either. More perspective for you."
I'll take the W any day of the week.  You play to win the game!!!
"Anybody that saw Boller and Flacco must literally thank their stars to have Lamar Jackson as QB right now. He is far and away the best football player in the league and let's just be thankful we have him. Flacco was streaky sure but when he stunk, he was a lot of wood under center. Literally."
"I was at work thinking ""huh off day for the offense"" then I thought ""huh I remember when we beat the Bills like 13-7 only a few short years ago."" 


Bandwagoners, man."
Agree with you but offense didnt score 30 pts. Just want to credit our D which in those days you speak of were also like our offense too! Today the D scoop n score reminded me of those days..
"We played a smart game, managed our lead and ran out clock

It may not have been big explosive passing plays, but it meant we didn't take any risks and maximised our chance of winning the game."
New fans are insufferable. Kids can't appreciate shit
"I'm happy with the comfortable W, but am concerned about IOL play and still have questions about our passing game. We did not necessarily need it today, but I still want to see what Boykin and Hollywood got. We might get a chance next week with Kansas City."
"It’s football, let’s be happy that we are getting scores from every way possible: Rushing, Throwing, Defensive turnovers. Well oiled machine"
"Honestly I’m fine with it. Shows that as a team, we can win different ways depending on how the defense is playing. Browns want to stop the run? Lamar throws for 275 and 3 touchdowns. Texans want to stop the big plays? We dink and dunk and run our way to the win. 

And it’s only week 2. We’re 2-0 while not playing our best."
Only real complaint is too many sacks. Never didn't have the lead to complain too badly.
"Idk about others but personally I was concerned just bc we saw what a well-oiled machine we were last year and we still came up short. I'm not ungrateful that we can finally expect the team to handle lesser teams, but I just get worried what will happen we go up against true championship contenders. Those teams will exploit your weaknesses"
I’m happy about the offense they are top 5 in the league just concerned about the line it’s getting Lamar killed.
"Most years, a lot of teams don't gel until after 4 games. This year, with no preseason, it may be 6 games. I'm happy with the progress, though, and look forward to more."
The bandwagon is real
I'm almost positive I heard him say he would've voted for Russ for MVP last year but he lost his ability to vote because he didn't submit his ballot the year before...... Essentially ruining Lamars unanimous mvp.  Ive spent enough time listening to him praise Pittsburgh as is. Now that.
"He is a spiteful, hateful, SOB that has consistently hated on the Ravens. Just listen to that chicken neck fuck call a Steelers/Ravens game and you'll understand that he is uber biased POS. That is the reason why I don't trust PFF one bit."
"I’ve found I really like Tony Romo, Jim Nanz.

Edit: Charles Davis"
"I believe a few people voted Russ all-pro but didnt dare vote for anyone else for MVP, I don't think Collinsworth was one of them though. 

He is hella biased in his commentary though for the team he prefers."
And he would have been the lone idiot. There was no one last year that was even remotely close to Lamar. There is just no arguement to be made for anyone else.
What can you expect from a sad and ringless former bengal? A team who’s only job is to spite the AFC division leader.
"People who think MVP just means ""Elite quarterback with the worst teammates"" are wrong and stupid and bad."
chris collinsworth reminds me always of the gimp from pulp fiction.
Lamar is still better then Wilson.
"Yeah, I heard this too and was like what?? Then he was laughing like yah I WOULD have been that one guy.. oh well

Bah"
"Besides all the comments here about bias, my biggest beef with Collinsworth is he's shitty at his job.  He'll say stuff like ""That looks like a catch, but I don't know what a catch is any more.""  Dude, it's your fucking job!  How about you look up the goddamn rule and learn what a fucking catch is!

Edit: If I told my boss, ""These JavaScript libraries keep changing, I don't know how to code anymore."" I'd be fucking fired."
Hey wait as an old time fan I love Chris Collins Collinsworth and he has always always had the ravens back as much as a color guy can.  He called both our superbowls before we even got to the playoffs

No fro marlo
"Is Marlon finally off the market? Cuz if you go to that megkurkowski chick in his comments, from her instagram story, she look likes she's watching his cat snowflake right now 👀

Sorry, I was bored this morning 😂"
Noooooooo
Hopefully it grows it back :((
Okay. Why did Marlo cut off his fro?
Is that the joker suit?
Did he ride his bike to the game?
Why should anyone care? Bigger issues in the world these days

"Yea i heard that too, after watching JTuck kick 4 FGs today"
tuck would’ve made that 58 yarder too tho
Oh ok I wasn't the only one to do this
"I hope that next Monday night Justin Tucker hits. 63 yard game winner so then we can use the ""and I took that personally meme"""
"Seems people have already forgotten about that 61 yard GW, but whatever"
"Romo is such a Chiefs blowhard. I honestly am happy we don't have them for the chiefs, he never sea impressed by lamar."
I did the same thing!
"I felt the same watching the 2 Pats' games and the commentator going on about Cam's option read play and how long he holds the ball while making the read. Like seriously, did you watch a single Ravens' game in 2019."
Tucker is the greatest kicker *of all time*
"If I hear the words ""best kicker"" its a built in trigger in my brain, it'll catch my attention everytime"
I'm not looking for a Butker Vs. Tucker duo. Jackson vs. Mahomes is what we are coming for.
Anyone notice the obvious he’s playing in a fucking stadium when he kicks 58 yards go kick 58 yards in fucking charm city brother
Automatic
Who?
I know all of Reddit loves him but I really don't think Romo is that great of an announcer
[deleted]
"lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season, never this type of adulation, even before the season started alot of folks annointed russ the MVP. 
why was it so diff from lamar? it seems to me russell is the perfect ''type'' of qb and face for the nfl they want to promote, not the florida dialect heavy qb"
Lamar was voted a unanimous MVP. I think he got his recognition.
"Lamar got plenty of praise once the season was underway last year. He was unanimous MVP.

Russell Wilson is arguably the best QB playing right now and he's a good dude. Deserves every bit of it."
"If you're going by that broadcast, than yea, Collins would suck Wilson's dick dry if he could. But right now, Wilson is dominating. His numbers are ridiculous. 

Praising one QB is not a knock on another."
"> lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season, never this type of adulation, 

Lol wut?  Did you not watch the games or follow the media last year?  

Yes, a lot of people are saying that it's Wilson's 'turn', but his play so far has been worthy of being considered.  It's a long season, and if awards were given in the preseason, the Browns would have won the Superbowl last year."
"People were all over Lamar’s dick man. 

He was unanimous MVP, cover of Madden, running on sports center nonstop. People were constantly saying “oh my god he actually can pass??!” 

It was glorious. Not sure what planet you were on but this post just sounds whiny af"
"Bro don't be salty. Lamar gets tons of praise.

Russ has more tds than incompletions rn dude is BALLING"
r/conspiracy
"Russell’s that good, though."
"Let's not have conspiracy theory crap here please. Once the Ravens beat the Seahawks last year, it was nonstop praise for Lamar last year or did you just conveniently forget that?"
"Maybe you’re looking too into it, granted Russ was receiving a lot of recognition last season too and rightfully so he was doing great too. But Lamar did unanimously win MVP, there’s no more recognition than that, and you’d see a highlight of Lamar posted every chance the NFL could post it. Russ is just playing insane at the moment and hopefully he can continue, cause he’s a baller and a great person."
"Lamar was unproven at that point, and announcers/media just play it safe. They know Russ is great, so they don't have to really face the music if he ends up playing poorly enough to lose MVP or MVP Votes. 


Of Drew Lock or Haskins came out this season playing like Wilson did, they wouldn't get the hype from media people because the media people do not have much to work with from other seasons.


Lamar did get hype pretty early on though."
"Dude. There are MANY other players in the league who excell. Russell Wilson is playing incredibly well right now. The dude is making insane throws. His production with the O-lines he’s had is amazing. Lamar is doing Lamar things, he was the Unanimous MVP last year, it’s ok for other people to get attention. 

The media slobbed on our knobs *all* last year, Lamar won player of the week I dont know how many times. Like yes, Lamar has faced adversity for how he sounds but this just seems like a bit of a stretch to me."
Lamar never got praise? What is this man talking about? He literally got the MVP lol
Let’s not be like Seahawks fans last year. There is no reason to shit on Russ to try and prop up Lamar. Let Russ get his well deserved hype and focus on the Ravens.
"Little known fact. 

The announcers are supposed to talk about the teams on the field at the game they are assigned to."
Wilson has earned it for the time being.
"Lamar was the talk of the league all last season. Russell Wilson has been in the league for a long time and is finally getting credit where it's due. He deserves it, he's an excellent QB."

Not blindside
Yeah it‚Äôs literally right in his face lmao
I bet Rob's eyes were wide as dinner plates when the OL slid out lol
"Its not called a ""blindside"" sack just because the hit is so vicious that the qb goes blind for a second."

Don't pat yourself on the back too hard OP
I was more upset about them trading back twice to skip on Ridley and DJ Moore
"What is the point of this? To float he's injured? ""Hah! We didn't get him look how injured he is!""

This doesn't relate to the Ravens, why does this sub feel the need to take all r/NFL news and make it about us?

A lot of teams passed on James, he has bad injury luck as of late. That's it."
Still wouldve wanted to draft him not getting the point here
I was so upset when we passed on James to trade back at 16. Looks like Ozzie knew something the rest of us didn't.
"Sad for him, but good for us. Aways happy to see potential playoff rivals lose key players to injuries."
""
"Credit to Gardner Minshew, he took that hit like a champ and got right back up."
A classic play from Ravens legend Kenny Young lol
This made me laugh way too much.
"Jesus the roast of the Jags isn't even going to be fun, went from super bowl aspirations 2 seasons ago to rebuilding"
Jags fan. Can confirm. Life is pain. Enjoy Calais
"Let‚Äôs wishbone the offense üòÇ Ingram, Dobbins, Fournette, Andrews, Boyle, Ricard /s"
"If Dobbins wasn‚Äôt drafted this year, I‚Äôd be all over the Ravens signing Fournette. Would be so good in the read option system"
Is minshew really so bar that they don't even wanna try to build around him? It's like they're setting him up for failure at this point.
"I remember a press conference in 2017 where a reporter was giving Ozzie a hard time for picking almost all defensive players. He responded by pointing out that it‚Äôs stupid to pass on a great player just because he‚Äôs on the wrong side of the ball. He followed up with ‚ÄúIf Leonard Fournette had still been available at 17 we‚Äôd have picked him.‚Äù Poor us, we got stuck with Marlon Humphrey instead"
Oh lort
Any chance we think about trading Gus to Jacksonville?
More like me after drafting him on my fantasy league
Funny how Minshew has the same amount of playoff wins as Lamar. For now üòè

question: who the fuck is our TE3 going to be??
It looks like they're actually going to hold on to him for now. https://twitter.com/AaronKazreports/status/1300451244469825540
If Eli Wolf makes the roster is he an honorary member of the Wolfpack?
Hopefully Delanie Walker is on the way
Damn apparently he was actually playing his size this camp I‚Äôm surprised they cut him.
My bet is they roll with Ricard and bring in Walker/other vets who get cut for some workouts after Week 1
Damn thought he was gonna get the nod. ELI WOLF.. ACTIVATE
"Good luck to him in his football career, I thought he was gunna step up to be TE3 this season."
Oh no! I thought he knew the offense really well and was a great blocker. Probably a PS candidate is why he was released early.

You should maybe put a title so that people don‚Äôt assume it‚Äôs the same thing as the previous post aka Scarff being cut.

"Unless JK balls out incredibly hard, I don‚Äôt see him truly supplanting Ingram this year 

I think to start, it‚Äôs gonna be like 50% Ingram, 25% JK, 15% Gus, 10% Justin Hill

I expect JK to take 5% of Gus‚Äôs and Justice‚Äôs carries and maybe some of Ingram‚Äôs as well by mid-season. 

So it would be like 45% Mark, 35-40% JK, the rest split between Gus and Hill. 

2021 I think JK will be lead dawg but I hope we can keep Mark around ... maybe extend him 1 year to lower his cap."
I dunno. Mark Ingram is **so** good with LJ at the mesh point. It's a key part of this offense. We saw Gus doesn't quite have that mind-meld that LJ and Mark have. Interested to see how Dobbins does. But has to bee something to keep in mind when it comes to who's getting carries.
I took jk in every league expecting him to take the lions share of the carries by midseason. We'll want to keep Ingram healthy for the playoffs
I'd say week 11 barring Ingram has an injury before that
"He could be like Ekeler this year, just catching passes"

"Wow, a return guy with no camp issues. I must be dreaming"
Urge to simp...rising...

He‚Äôs a dawg, a football player that plays receiver, and will be a Raven for a long time."

How effective would he have been if he was playing with Lamar Jackson ?
Considering you still need to catch the ball to play wide receiver roughly as effective as he was before. Maybe a few more jet sweeps or other gadget plays but largely the same player.
Lamar doesn't play special teams so I can imagine anything would be much different aside from starting at the opponents 40 most drives
Well he‚Äôs a killer returner so we‚Äôd be starting with awesome field position most of the time
This man.. i copied all of his dance moves. All of em. All of us RAVENS fans owe him.. and i do too.. lol
"Picked off Lamar, and returned a kick. Will Nigel continue the un-drafted rookie streak?"
"I'll be honest, when I was making cuts in madden I cut him cause I thought he was a random fake filler player without a picture and a fake sounding name. Ended up resigned to the practice squad i think."
After last few days I think he has a legitimate chance. Was initially thinking Chauncey Rivers for OLB depth/development
Nigel is my boy and I love that he‚Äôs getting the opportunity. He absolutely should‚Äôve been drafted and is one of the better UDFAs I can remember over the last few years by any team.

"Reminded me of the video of Brian Billick [""encouraging""](https://youtu.be/LluesncBJGo) Trent Dilfer."
"Hah! 

Trent was just barely good enough to get us to that championship. 

You could say, ""well, he took care of the football,"" but he didn't even really do \*that\*, either. IIRC, he actually threw a pick *in the Super Bowl*, but it was called back on an unrelated penalty on the defense. I'm not looking it up; someone correct me if I'm wrong."
A few years get taken off my life every time someone tries to say the 2000 ravens offense was good/mediocre.
I re-watched most that Super Bowl years ago and think I remember him missing a lot of open dudes and I was just thinking how much more Ravens would've smoked them if Flacco were QB.
Trent Dilfer being such hot garbage really makes that championship even cooler though
Still better then Tony Banks
"I re-watched that game last year and what stood out to me the most was not how dominant our defense was, but just how bad Trent was.  He missed so many wide open passes and the offense could have realistically scored 3 or 4 more TDs.  This post is one of a few times a wide open receiver could have walked in to the endzone if we had a decent QB throwing to them."
Dilfer Dime
Well at least he made the right read
And to think Dilfer thinks Baltimore did him dirty by replacing him.
Accidental never in history ball.
"I am not a qb guru, but even 10 year old me knew Dilfer had atrocious footwork"

My first ravens game. One of HEAAAAAAPs best moments at the end.
Unbelievable how short these games can run if we just focus on the actual playtime... thanks for sharing! I needed this.
Our offenses under Billick were so bad lol. Steve McNair turned it on for that last drive and Mr. Dependable Todd Heap making plays like always! The chargers taking that safety made absolutely zero sense since they had to punt the ball right after giving up the safety lol
Heap was a monster
"HEAAAPPP! McNair had guys in his grill all drive, that man could maneuver around and make something from nothing. 06 was a great squad. Even Clayton had it on that last drive ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
I was at this game and have the picture if heap‚Äôs diving TD framed and I remember that TD vividly but I did NOT remember that SD took an intentional safety in this game. Interesting!
"That defense was the definition of ‚Äúbend, don‚Äôt break‚Äù and sometimes they didn‚Äôt bend either."
Lol @ that arm punt at [https://youtu.be/3YRtdsgkfy0?t=474](https://youtu.be/3YRtdsgkfy0?t=474)
First Ravens game I ever attended. I‚Äôll never forget this game
"That defense was so fucking good. This was prime LT running behind a beastly OL and outside of run, he was bottled up for most of the game."
"So everyone knows what happened with earl, from him fighting with big baby last year to the final straw with Chuck Clark and everything in between. Im curious to think if anyone thinks this will be a blemish on edc. Every medium to big name free agent (or trade) hes brought in has either played out or im excited to see play out (Campbell and wolfe), from him getting a 4th pick for flacco to what he's put together this year is par none (maybe ozzie) but will signing earl to such a hefty contract be a blemish on his record?"
"Nah, he just didn't pan out."
Not a blemish at all.. by every account a guy on pace for a HOF career is someone who you want on your team.. we know what a good FS does for the DBs and defense in general by being blessed with Reed for so long.. and I mean we got a good season out of him.. if they beat the contract what did we really lose out on?
"I can't see how it would this early in his career as GM, it's not his fault Earl couldn't put his ego away and not be a prick"
"It all depends on how the grievance plays out. Really it was a an overpay in the first place especially when he was only getting 1 year deals when the ravens signed him to 4 with alot of upfront guarantees.  EDC has made way more good moves then bad but did get over aggressive with the ET3 signing in hindsight.   Still if thats his worse ""blemish"" I'm more then happy."
"Earl Thomas is a Hall of Famer and isn‚Äôt washed up. You take a chance on that. Some weird shit happened with him that I don‚Äôt think is fair to expect EDC to have foreseen.

Not going to be on his highlight reel but it was defensible and we got a very good year out of him."
"People in here will say no, but he was pretty much objectively EDCs first real mistake as GM. It won't stick with him any more than signing Frank Walker or Elvis Grbac stuck with Ozzie, in a couple year's time no one will care one way or the other, that being said it was a bad move really from the start. Signing a guy over 30 coming off a broken leg (and other injury issues in his last few years in Seattle), who really didn't fit our system given that Wink's defense really doesn't call for a single high safety in the back end, to a really big 4 year deal was doomed from the start - it's really just weird that it was character issues that ended this stint, either way I don't think his time here would have lasted much longer, probably wouldn't have survived next offseason.

Despite being good for us, he wasn't playing at the level of his deal and, again, didn't fit the system, so I don't doubt that we were happy to use our ""out"" on his deal when it became possible."
It is definitely a blemish no other team offered him anything more then a one year deal.  We bid against ourselves to give him the contract we did.  Oh on top of that he had no contact with anybody in the organization before the offer was actually made so this wasn‚Äôt just a questionable move with hindsight.  I still love EDC though he‚Äôs been really great other then that.  I mean fuck even Ozzie has a blemish or two with the obvious one when we sent Boldin away for peanuts.

"I don't know what stats you're looking up but stop going to that site. He didn't miss a game his rookie year, and that included 2 playoff games. He played in 5 more last year. To date he has only missed 11 of 34 the chargers have played. 16 more is 27/50.

And the dodged a bullet idea is nonsense. He should have been drafted by us instead of w/e they were thinking with Hurst. A fluke injury that will cost him his 3rd NFL season isn't a reason not to have taken him in hindsight. Hurst isn't even on the team anymore, and we've had a revolving door at safety."
"Super easy to say in hindsight.

I would've still preferred him over Hurst on the off chance that he stays healthy on a different team, or that he comes back from the extensive injuries and is able to show his stuff.

100% still better on potential to do ANYTHING than Hurst was. IDK how we can ""dodge a bullet"" on a pick where we got minimal value out of and ended up getting extremely lucky to trade for a solid pick."

"11 seasons as a Raven, with 61 career INTs during that time. That‚Äôs an average of over 5 INTs a season. That‚Äôs actually really legendary"
Why was he so cruel to the Browns and Bengals?  Nobody likes a bully.
I keep hearing all this about how Lamar is working on his deep ball and going to run less this year. I don't get why people want to turn him into a pocket passer. I say  let him do what made him a star.. really hope they don't try to force him to be something he's not
"I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre trying to change him, more just improve a portion of his game. If we need a few quick strikes to catch up, it‚Äôs good to have the deep ball skills to get those points back quick. He‚Äôs already showed those skills, I think they‚Äôre just focusing on that this year, since that‚Äôs kinda what we needed last year in the playoff game."
"I don't get the impression they are forcing him to do anything.  If you listen to what Lamar has talked about the last 2 years, much of what they are working on are the same things he has said he wants to work on.  He is a Quarterback and his main purpose is to distribute the ball.  Passing is a huge component to that in this league.  Lamar improving his ability to pass, anticipate routes, work on his touch and delivery is important.

Again, all of this has been stated candidly by Lamar himself.  He has even talked numerous times about not running as much himself.  That isn't trying to mold him into something he is not, that is just him wanting to make more plays with his arm.  The better he can throw, especially deep, the more opportunities he will have to make big plays with his feet as well.

Think about it this way, if a team has to really worry about your deep pass game, then they have to keep their safeties deep or keep CBs in more off coverage.  They can't just press and play the box all the time.  When you get them to respect that, it will give Lamar more options to be versatile and use all of his skills as a runner and a passer.

Finally, if you look at everything they have done the past few years, they have sold out on being all in with Lamar.  They have changed the style and dynamic of the team to fit more of Lamar's style of play.  But like all teams, they need to constantly change some things and switch some things up to keep opponents guessing."
"Lamar will never turn into Checkdown Joe. 

That‚Äôs because he‚Äôs his own checkdown. Lol"
I think we will see Lamars career mirror Russell Wilson. When Russ first came into the league he ran a lot and used a ton of read option. Running ability allows a QB to limit turnovers or not force bad throws. As he got more comfortable and experienced they let him throw way more and limit the amount of running.
"Misinformation is part of the off season. They did the same thing last year. Even if they change nothing, they're not going to admit that to all the other teams out there."
That was Caldwells bullshit
I heard he is licking both hands now.
You're falling for it just like they hope other defensive coordinators fall for it. Do you really think Lamar isn't still going to run and make people look foolish with his legs?

I know its lamar but i wish people would stop spending money on this shit game. At their board meetings they probably have a good laugh at how people still buy this shit when they don't even try
It's frustrating that Lamar got stuck with this dog shit retread of a game and the worlds most amateur cover art.

That‚Äôs great to hear about Tyre
Dobbins is gonna be so fucking good in this offense man. I love Ingram but Dobbins is gonna take that starting job by the the end of the year.
"Out of all the potential replacements for Yanda that we had this offseason, Phillips is the one I least suspected to earn the starting job. But if he‚Äôs outplaying Powers, Bredeson, Makari, AND Fluker then I‚Äôm not gonna complain about that."

Did something happen to Madubuike and Harrison?

Patrick Queen: Starting MLB
J.K. Dobbins: 'Signficant' role as backup RB
Devin Duvernay: In mix as WR/KR

James Proche: Punt ret.

Other finalists include arthur brown, Matt fucking elam, and sergio kindle (honestly this one is sad)"
sergio kindle smh and perriman tbh
Terrance Brooks
"Tom zibikowski, thought he‚Äôd be a good ss next to reed"

Lamar Jackson on the Browns would be in a wheelchair right now
Hue was the coach at the time you know damn well he wouldve switched to wr like a moron
Chubb was a stud in the second round of this draft but how would Saquon not go at 4...?
Lamar honestly landed on the best team possible. There are maybe 2-3 other teams that would have tried to build the offense around Lamar but the Ravens had the best coaches before they drafted Lamar. Orlando Brown a first round pick after we got him in the third? Nice.
Yeah Darold at 3 is rediculous

Mark Andrews must be #17 if he's not in that list.

Because we actually took the time to build around him and help him, instead of expecting him to magically turn the ship around, like the Browns have done with the past 2-3 QBs they've drafted. 

In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the Browns part ways with Baker and expect Trevor Lawrence to be their savior next."
I have to imagine Marc Andrews is somewhere in the 1st round as well.
In what world is Denzel Ward getting drafted before Derwin or Minkah?

There is zero chance Darnold goes that high.

"I am the commisioner of a fantasy football league with a team that has become available.

This is our 20th season and we had a some mildly quirky rules and traditions that I think makes us an especially nice choice for someone looking for a second league (Though we are plenty of people's only league and that's cool, too.  It's my only league most years because I have to handle commissioner stuff as well as my team.) or something of that nature, because we are different enough to be interesting but so different as to be frustrating.

We do expect owners to set lineups week to week and make sure they have a starter at every position every week and to play to win.  However, you don't actually have to win. Some people have played for years and always have losing records and we're cool with it because we see they set their lineups and make transactions and are trying.  You have to try, not necessarily be skilled. :)

If anyone cares, we are rated a Gold level league (80th percentile or above, but below 95th percentile, which is a different level) by Yahoo and have people in the lowest category (Bronze) and in the highest category (99th percentile), so it's a little wide spread.

One catch is that the league has already drafted. The draft for this team didn't go very well, so it's a challenge, but not an impossible one. We chose not to have a Covid IR, which means if the season involves as many suddenly cancelled NFL games as some think, there will be a lot of movement of players from rosters to the wavier wire and free agency pool and back with teams scrambling to find people to start, which means a lot of chances for a team to improve by scooping up guys other teams are basically forced to cut to clear roster spots.

Get me your email address if you are interested and I'll send an invite.

One thing I should say from the onset is that we don't do politics or related symbols and even have a no politics rule for team logos and essentially everything.  Applies equally to both sides.  Keeps the peace. :)"

"Yeah, Harbs was the number 2 option after I believe Andy Reid gave him a good recommendation.

Turned out well for the Ravens. Dodged a clapping bullet."
"I remember being PISSED that we missed out on Garret and really annoyed that we settled for a special teams coach from Philly. Such a silly reaction looking back, but 2008 was fun all things considered."
It is also worth remembering that Brian Billick only got the head coaching gig after George Seifert turned it down.  Both of the Raven's Super Bowl wins were teams coached by their second choice for head coach...
probably gonna be the best HC the franchise has had for as long as it exists. love Harbs
McDaniels was lurking in the water as well.
"I really, really wanted Garrett. I thought he was going to be a stud coach. Next I wanted Tex yo have the job. I was legitimately pissed we hired Harbs. I guess that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not an NFL GM."
"Garrett might have developed into a better coach here than he did in Dallas.  Flacco had his best games in a system like the one Garrett had.  Who knows what might have been if those two had gotten to grow up together. 

But I am 100% a John Harbaugh guy.  He's my coach."
Garrett was definitely coming to Baltimore until JJ convinced Garret that he would get the HC job within 2 years.
Seeing stuff like this makes me get cold sweats....we would still be bragging about 1 SB win if we got Garrett. Man's had the most stacked offense last year on the Cowgirls and made them go 8-8

He‚Äôs awesome. I am still stunned how we got Peters with a pick for a kicker we were NEVER GOING TO SIGN.
"To be fair the Campbell trade was made because of cap reasons, not necessarily an equivalent player value. 

The real value in this trade comes with the fact that the Ravens were willing to part ways with the recently drafted 1st rd. Pick because of the value they already have at TE. Ace move by the GM to make good trades for the roster you have."
He did train with the Yoda of NFL FO!
Losing Hayden Hurst still hurts me a bit. Man had great hands and insane speed and was an amazing talent. Too bad he was underutilized. Im hype asf for calais tho no doubt
"It feels good watching the Pats fail, especially when we also succeed."
Love getting Campbell
"I love it, but how is it legal for us to win that much? I feel like it shouldnt be able to happen, but DeCosta makes it so."
"This has been one of the best examples of Football Management I've ever seen. Tier one pass rushers and tier one (potential) running back for Hayden Hurst (tier 2 TE, at best). Love it!"

Hot take but Hurst has the best hands out of our TE group.

"With our receiver corp so young, is he worth a workout? 

Guy obviously didn‚Äôt work out in New England but they signed him to be their primary outside number 1 with Josh Gordon. (I know Edelman, but he‚Äôs a slot guy). 

He was outstanding as a number 2 behind Julio in Atlanta and AJ in Cincinnati. 

Sanu has never been an issue off-the-field. Never a problem with the media. Guys seem to like him in the locker room. Is from/still lives in New Jersey so it‚Äôs somewhat close Keeps to himself, works hard, and leads by example consistently.

Here he wouldn‚Äôt have to be ‚Äúthe guy‚Äù but a guy, very similar to a Crabtree. Plus a 1 year deal to prove he‚Äôs still worth something never hurt nobody.

I like it. Thoughts?"
"Apparently he's a really good blocker, but eh. Isn't he hurt?"
"Similar body to dez. Big strong, physical guy. Good blocker. If he comes at the right price , hell yea"
"Even the most successful coach in pro football, who's desperate for wide receiver talent, doesn't think he's worth a roster spot."
"Eh, take a look, but I don't really see what he'd bring to us honestly. He doesn't really fit with what we've been looking for in WRs under DeCosta so far. Honestly would rather we save our money for when teams start trimming down to 53 and there are some more potentially impactful options on the market, as far as WR goes I'd rather just see what we have in the younger guys than sign Sanu.

He's a good WR3 at best, not sure why the Patriots decided he was worth a 2nd. Saying he was an ""outstanding number 2"" is a stretch, he wasn't a  liability when he literally had two of the best WRs in the league peeling coverage away from him."
"You‚Äôd think if he had anything left, the receiver starved Patriots would hold on to him. 

Hard pass."
He wears DBZ cleats so the answer is fuck yes
"Decent big receiver, can play strong in a gimmick offense, great run blocker, and a Rutgers kid. I'm for it."
"I don't really think he would start for us, so nah. He's older now. Pats didn't see much in him. I'm fine with sticking with our young guns."
Would be disappointing because it would mean the FO isn‚Äôt impressed with the current group outside of Hollywood
Nah we got enough heads to feed already and he doesn't bring anything unique to our WR room
Sanu did his job for the franchise already getting us Dobbins
"Fuck no that would be a massive step backwards to what we did during our 6 year playoff drought.

If he can't make the Pats with their sorry ass receivers then he's not making our team."

Dude's a straight-up baller and his play from behind victories will come, there is *zero* doubt in my mind about it. The fact that we so rarely have to play from behind is a testament to how good he (and the rest of our team, of course) is. 

No need for a reach like this and inferring it's proof he can play from behind. 

That being said, great two drives and I can watch highlights all day long."

I have a couple of quick questions. How much does it cost and can I use my dog?
I was thinking about it but the Canadian dollar is trash right now.
Is it 1 purchase for all the home games? You don't have to buy 1 cut-out for each game do you?
Tbf all proceeds are going to a charity.
I was in to do this til I saw where they wouldnt send you the cutout or at least let you buy it after the season.
"He also is apparently looking more driven then ever because he's never had a coach look him in the face and flat out say ""no thanks"".


I didn't realize he was that bad in his tryout üò¨"
Lmao that‚Äôs a tough one. Those workouts are really that tough that he puked?
"I think Dez's heart is there but injuries and taking two years off really turned the clock waaaay forward on his career, imagine if we had him and Wallace the same year"
"Someone posted what the workout was a couple years ago, and assuming it was accurate...it looks fucking insane.

Suggs also failed it a few years ago and he was close to game-shape. There's a reason why our team very rarely looks gassed, shits intense."
I think this was reported right after it happened
Barstool Banks said that too fwiw
"lol what a pussy. (im just kidding I would quite literally die during the warm up, and Im in good shape)"
"Sucks to hear tbh, was looking forward to a veteran reciever. Not sure if those workouts were hell or he was out of shape. I'm assuming he was pushed hard since the front doesn't want to gamble on him"
That's what Barstool Banks said too.
"Let‚Äôs say all our top players either top 1000 yards or get really close. That means, LJ, Ingram, Edwards, Andrews, Brown, and maybe JK. That‚Äôs possibly 6000 yards right there. Add in 500ish yards each from Snead, Duvernay, and Proche even, and maybe another 300 for Hill. 

Is that crazy talk??"
"Considering we were less than 500 yards away from it last year, it certainly seems doable.  But we would probably have to be in more close games and push the ball down the field in more 4th quarters, which I'm unsure about."
yes
"Well this sub once thought Maclin, Perriman and Wallace would each put up 1000 yards so nothing is crazy here"
"Its not crazy at all. Only thing is,  just like last season, LJ might not play in the 4th quarter in some games! I see a few blowouts incoming"
"I think you have Gus and JK opposite, if Gus isn't dealt I still think JK has taken that number 2 spot"
If we keep rg3 on the bench this time around then yes
"7,000 yards isn‚Äôt crazy after last year

But thinking LJ, Ingram, Edwards, and Dobbins could ever EACH get 1,000 yards is insane

Obviously it‚Äôs hypothetically possible but I seriously doubt 3 running backs have ever gotten 1,000 total yards all on the same team in the same season. And then add another thousand to LJ"
"Not crazy,  but it would mean besting last year's total. 

We had 6521 yards of total offense last year (407.5 per game).  7000 yards across 16 games would mean an additional 30 per game."
"All these guys could get 1000 individuals, but I don‚Äôt think they can all do it at once."
"Yes, it's crazy talk.  We're taking a big step back without Yanda.  It will take at least 2 years to get RG back up to speed.   We may still win a lot of games, but it won't look as easy as it did last year."
"Someone made a great point that it's going to be harder to draft next year with no college playing in the fall. You think a lot of talent is gonna fall? I think so, plus teams might have to rely on already hyped up players with little film and basically a year off. 

I def think we should trade our 1st for a db or wr. Who would you trade for?"
Colleges are playing.
"For one, who would they trade for?   All teams know about the draft and if they have the same thoughts as you, that pick will lose its value.  What CB or WR out there is a realistic target?  

Second, no.  There will still be a draft process.  While it may not be the amount of tape, there‚Äôs still tape on the projected 1st round picks.  Yes, it‚Äôs true that those projections would have shaken up during a season; but I guarantee you the NFL will figure it out.  Maybe they move the draft back until May, or triple down on those exhibition games (like the Sr Bowl), or the NFL will be very lenient on the rules for player workouts and visits.

Lastly, due to COVID the cap is a great unknown.  Draft picks are the way to manage by the cap because you‚Äôre getting rookie contract players.  They can‚Äôt trade and bring in anyone who will cost money when the cap is an unknown, and the money is needed for our existing players anyway."
"I mean, I don't know what we're going to get for the 32nd pick, but I am willing to listen to offers."
"Since jaguars are having a fire sale to tank for Trevor Lawrence, I‚Äôll gladly give up next year‚Äôs 1st for Josh Allen."

"I don't see anything wrong with kicking the tires. Even if we're all in on Elliott as the guy beside Clark, our depth at safety is just nonexistent now. Levine doesn't get many defensive snaps anymore - by the end of last year he was in low single digits per game - and calling him a DB at this point is a stretch, Jimmy seems like he should be able to make a pretty nice transition to safety snaps but his health is unreliable and he is at this point an unknown at the position, after those guys we're relying on a rookie 7th rounder in Stone and a rookie UDFA in Warrior.

I wouldn't be against seeing what he's asking for."
"Imo we shouldn't, he just offers nothing imo. And I feel like we're better off with someone young who can develop but wat do y'all think?"
"I think Geno Stone is a sleeper. Like my post with Sanu yesterday, can‚Äôt hurt to give the guy a try out and possibly a one-year offer but nothing more. With COVID this year, availability is the best ability, the best teams that will need to 1) stay healthy and 2) be able to plug someone in seamlessly if someone tests positive/is injured"
"Literally any decent player released ""should we sign him"""
No
i think it‚Äôs a good idea. Bring in some cheap competition and also some depth considering Joker‚Äôs injury history. also has plenty of starting experience.
"Is he willing to place special teams? Cause as a backup safety, That‚Äôll probably be one of his role."
"If we had a regular preseason, sure why not."
Maybe midway through the season if Elliot just doesn‚Äôt pan out.
I'd rather develop our guys then take a rental on a guy who might be a bit washed.

"I'm happy he made the cover of madden, but why did it have be this dogshit one lol. the game is not worthy of lamar."
"Interestingly enough this was the last year Madden had competition and 2K screwed everyone inadvertently by releasing NFL 2K5 at $20 which cost EA a ton of sales and forced them to lower the price of Madden 2005 to $30. Later in the year, EA purchased the exclusive NFL agreement for only licensed NFL game and now we get the same game every year with no improvements, just updated rosters and unfixed bugs.  The pricing of NFL 2K5 was the main driver of going after an exclusive agreement."

He was already reading defenses better than almost any other qb I've ever seen.  Or maybe his vision during plays is just that good.
Can Lamar read defenses well in generally? I know he executes the reads in the offense to perfectly but I don‚Äôt know how well he can scan a defense and make changes. Last year the second half of the season he was on fire but he seemed to move people around less and such

A lot of people are sleeping on this division we could legit have 3 playoff teams if fat Ben and baker rebound and play well
"I think this is one of the more honest articles about the AFCN that has come out. The Browns may just be the 2nd best team in the division this year and give us a decent challenge for number 1. 

Baltimore has the talent and drive to be 16-0 this year, tbh, barring major injuries. I think it'll come down to how many mistakes we make. We no longer have the luxury of randomly dropping 2 games early on. 

Like coach says, we gotta keep stacking wins. Or someone else will."

"Hi Everyone,

First of all, thank you for the mods for giving us permission to post.  

I wanted to take you a moment and introduce the Super Casual Football Sim League. For those unfamiliar with a sim league, I find the best way to describe is as an old feature of Madden, where you created a player and developed their career.  Think of it like that, but the teams are run by real people and instead of competing against bots who have a fixed growth, you‚Äôre competing with other people.  You develop your player, and then the AI takes control of the rest. Sounds fun, right?  It is also completely free.

All of our games are recorded live, with live commentary in the booth and the update system is so easy that two other simulation leagues have adopted it as their update system.  In addition, we are the only Simulation League to run on Axis Football, and it has gotten the notice of the team there as it has gotten their attention and occasionally they pop in for the streams.

If you want a look to see how a game looks, earlier this season, The Coyotes decided to make the Aliens work for their win, in an attempt to play spoiler for the postseason for our team out of Roswell: https://youtu.be/x-FjVupBPSE?t=1104 to save you some time, I have the link starting the video at the 4th quarter.

We've shown a willingness to move on from our STs aces when they are older and can't contribute much outside of STs anymore, we did it with Albert McClellan not too long ago. Levine is 33 and go fewer and fewer defensive snaps as the season went on last year, getting down into the low single digits by the end of the season even though we were desperate for LBs all year. Great on STs obviously, but he hasn't been our best guy there for a couple years.

Does anyone know how often ravens will be running 3 tight end sets this year?
"Nah, EDC‚Äôs going to get Hurst back for a 7th round pick and a stale bag of chips.  And Atlanta‚Äôs going to pick up 80% of his check."

"I'd rather roll the cap space over. We've got some stars who are going to be really expensive soon, and that'll put the good but not great guys at risk. I'd rather retain guys like Mark Andrews, OBJ, and Hollywood long-term over getting Clowney now"
"This will be fun when he signs with the Tits or Saints and people are all pissed and try to justify why **""I never wanted him in the first place""**.

IMHO an offensive player to really watch and get excited about. Harbaugh is lavishing praise and the guy is fast with great hands. Disciplined route runner too. Could be a major steal in the draft. Very excited and will be watching with great interest his development.
"Duvernay was an absolute stud at Texas. I watched every game (I'm a Longhorn), and each play I would find myself looking for Duvernay bc I knew he was the best bet. He's extremely fast and has fantastic hands. Sam Ehlinger (UT QB) is a known scrambler that lacks the speed and agility of Jackson, but he has the size to make up for it at the college level. With that said, Duvernay was his constant security blanket. The guy knows how to get open and run with the ball. He's quick, but he's also a bowling ball. He's an angry runner. He's moves like Brown before the catch, and runs like Ingram after the catch. I'm obviously bias bc I'm a Longhorn, but I was ecstatic when the Ravens drafted him. I look forward to watching him on field."
"As a Ravens fan for many years, best to hold off on high expectation for receivers. 

Excited for Hollywood. Outside of that, I‚Äôll believe it when I see it."
"Very excited to see him play. I think our receiving core really improved this offseason. Brown added a lot of muscle, Boykin really impressed in camp, Snead I think played good in camp and we added DD (duvernay) and Porche"
"I'm super excited for this guy! For me he has that Steve Smith vibe to him - get him the ball let him beat people up. Unfortunately (for the sake of us getting to watch DD play more) I think snead has been too good to just brush aside.

Just like Ingram and dobbins, this offence has too many good issues. It's a fans dream and a fantasy football nightmare

Edit: forgot to mention the most important part! Have you seen the biceps on the kid?!"

They'll keep the practice squad stocked and maybe claim someone off waivers.
"Pat ricard as FB/TE and i imagine when we put a couple of players who are a bit banged up on IR to return in as little as 3 weeks, we could be bringing back one of the TE's we just cut for their spot"
My guess is they bring in Delanie Walker after they place Skura on IR designated to return list. Just guessing of course. Eli Wolf and/or Scarff may be back on the PS.
Maybe Boykin sees some snaps at TE.  He‚Äôs 220 and blocks well for a WR.

The 16 year streak is done. It was a good run. I think the lack of preseason really hurt the streak continuing.
Covid claims another victim.
I read some tweet today that its the first time in franchise history they have kept back to back set of QBs from the previous year
"Not exactly, the streak of keeping a UDFA on our 53 player roster after cutdowns is over. BUT we can still keep a streak of having a UDFA on the roster in Week 1 alive and well. There's a chance we put Skura/Moore or Madubuike on IR and then sign Nigel Warrior or Colon Castillo back to the active roster"
"IT is not done yet, the 16 year streak is having an undrafted FA make the 53 roster for the first game week. Skura is still on PuP and probably going to be put on IR (since he only has to be on for 3 weeks with this season roles) which means that Nigel Warrior/Wolf can easily make the team in that spot.   


Madibuke is also injured - the only time-table i have heard is week-to-week so I dont know if he will be IR'd too to start the season. But that is yet another spot for possible UDFA to continue the streak."
Is it us or the Patriots? I think I saw a similar headline about them
Not over yet. We'll probably re-sign someone when Skura and/or Mad Boogie go on temp IR

We won‚Äôt know that until game day.  Harbaugh doesn‚Äôt like to give up information until he absolutely has too do so.
"I think the only real question mark left as far as starters goes is on the offensive line.  With this being game week, I imagine they'll have the starters taking most of the reps this week, so we should get a clear sense on the O-line this week before game day.

For the wide receivers, I assume it's Hollywood, Boykin, and Sneed as WR 1-3, with Duvernay and Proche getting action here and there."

Good to hear tbh. If coaches thought we needed him we could get him.
"Notes on the Clowney pursuit ...

‚Ä¢ He had offers of ~$15M this offseason, but from teams he didn't want to go to.

"After the disaster with ETIII, I don‚Äôt blame the Front Office for being cautious with someone who might be a bad culture fit. Plus, I‚Äôm pretty sure than money we don‚Äôt spend under this years cap can get rolled into the next season which will be a lot more important with Lamar, Ronnie, and Marlon extensions coming due"
He probably didn't play like a Raven in their book. Purposely missing training camp 2 years in a row in addition to never really improving his pass rushing moves (working off talent) probably rubbed them the wrong way.
"The Ravens' business plan is ""younger, faster, stronger, cheaper."" Clowney would be deviating from that plan, which they do if they think it is really worth it. So they didn't think he was worth it. I like our guys. We will get production from Bowser and Ferguson, especially with upgraded DL."
"Can't help the club from the tub.

"Ya hear that, Tits!? You were his second choice!"
"I mean not gonna lie, would have loved him. And I‚Äôm scared about our depth at certain positions, especially after losing Yanda, Hayden Hurst, and Earl this offseason. 

But at this point EDC has my full confidence until proven otherwise."
Aww man
"If he was willing to come and we had the cap I feel like we‚Äôre gonna have a bit if regret on this.  AFC North has a strong rush presence (Chubb/Hunt on the Browns, Joe Mixon on the Bengals) and realistically if we get to playoffs the Titans and Henry are probably going to be in our way (let alone KC).  We can use his run stopping. And I love Judon but I think his sacks and TFL numbers were helped a lot by the aggressive blitzes we dialed up.  Even if Clowney isn‚Äôt an elite pass rusher I think he still brings a presence that allows us to get pressure without blitzing.  More importantly, it would help shore up potential gaps in the Secondary where ET is gone by strengthening the line."
I wonder if the front office consults the council on things like this
"EDC understands we need the cap space to sign Humph and Stanley.

I would not be surprised to see Stanley get a contract in the next year, Humphrey get franchised after 5th year option and us extend Lamar next offseason"
"Didn‚Äôt he get 12m with incentives that made it up to 15?


Most of these comments seem to indicate it was 15m against the cap.  I‚Äôm no cap expert but I don‚Äôt belieber that 12 with 15 max = 15 against the cap.

Those of you who don‚Äôt think he was worth 12, shame on youuuuuu"

"The Cowboys will probably designate Carr as one of their 4 protected PS members all season long, too. Thus, this now officially eliminates any hope of his return to the Ravens whenever the inevitable injury-laden secondary members start going down, as per usual.

Hence, there is officially no chance of relying on a solid contributor such as Carr in any type of dire pinch this season ‚Äî let alone the likes of a Maurice Canady coming back from IR on an annual basis, as obviously he has been long gone to the Jets since last season.

Personally (and I am sure plenty others feel the same way), I think this was an under-the-radar bad decision to cut him loose during the offseason ‚Äî especially considering the perennial durability issues of Jimmy Smith, Tavon Young, DeShon Elliott & even occasionally Anthony Averett.

Additionally, they were well aware of how ET3 was frequently behaving. In fact, apparently they were actively seeking ways out from under his contract for a while.

GET OFF MY LAWN
[deleted]
"I‚Äôm anxious as always about the opening game being a divisional game. Harbs is 9-3 on opening day and we‚Äôre usually very well prepared and I bet we come in with a chip on our shoulder since they ran all over us last year in week 3. 

I think we get the win, but I‚Äôll be more conservative and say something like 24-13. But would love to see a beat down like 39-3."
"Browns fan here. I think the 8-point spread in favor of your team (which will prob go down a couple points as we get closer to Sunday) is fair. There are a few reasons why:  

-Our brand new LT, Jedrick Wills, has reportedly had a tough time in camp. Granted, he had to move from RT (which he played at Bama) and he was going up against a fully-healthy Oliver Vernon but he will be protecting Baker's blind side. I'm not sure if I like that going up against your pass rush  
-In addition to Wills' foibles, C JC Tretter has been battling injuries through camp. As of today (9/7) he's back to practicing, but he's the anchor of our OL and if he's not ready that's going to be a problem.  

-We have a solid starting four on our DL but lack depth. I expect to get a good pass rush going against your OL but I don't expect it to last into the 2nd half.  

-Our LB corps is easily the weakest part of our team. Only Takitaki is a known commodity with Mack being out. If your RBs or Lamar make it to the 2nd level, that could spell trouble for us.  

-Losing S Grant Delpit was a huge blow, although I would think that he's technically an unknown commodity as a rookie; having Harrison step in takes a load of that weight off. But after Harrison I'm not sure how good our safeties will be. Our CBs are money though.  

-Baker has been inconsistent. Most of these inconsistencies have been in the early part of camp--he's since smoothed out the rough edges and he looks pretty good now--but if he struggles again like he did last year, the game could easily get out of hand.  

-New coach and offensive scheme. With not OTAs and preseason, this is gonna be difficult to streamline. We might do better in the 2nd half of the season if Stefanski is worth his salt and we avoid major injuries but I don't expect our offense to be ready beyond the first couple scripted drives. We are as talented as anyone on offense but it's going to be an uphill battle to gel on time.  

Let me know if you have any questions and I'll do my best to answer them."
"Ravens are gonna win big. 

-Look at our recent week 1 score lines. Absolute domination over the past 3 years. 

-Cleveland has a brand new coaching staff that had a shortened offseason. Yikes

-Cleveland‚Äôs defense is a massive liability. Billings opting out will hurt an already weak run defense. Many unknowns in the LB and secondary. Expect a heavy dose of Ingram and Dobbins. 

-Chubb will get his yards, but I think ultimately our defense will limit him and the play action. 

Final score: Ravens 38 Cleveland 10"

Ravens win 42-14. Lamar throws 3 TDs and 300+ yards.
33-20 Ravens. Mayfield with a late 4th quarter TD to make it look like less of a drubbing. Lamar throws an INT at one point but is otherwise the MVP of the game.

"It's just Harbaugh's usual ""rookies to the back of the line"" thing. Having Patrick Queen be the day one starter is quite unusual for him."
"Hollywood was listed as the WR3 going into last years season debut.

He then had 150 yards and 2 TDs in week 1


This depth chart means notbing"
"This depth chart was put out by the public relations team, not the coaches. Harbaugh won‚Äôt even tell the media who is starting at right guard on Sunday, he‚Äôs not going to break down the order of every position so the other team knows what to expect. This is just something to create buzz and keep fans interested until the season starts."
I really wouldn't worry about the 2/3/4 spots on the RB depth chart at this time. Playing well will move you up.
Harbs doesn‚Äôt like depth charts.

Hey guys! Just wanted to open a discussion and see what the flock expects out of Jaylon this year. I‚Äôm super hopeful that he can take the next step in being an edge-setter. Hopefully McPhee can help mentor him and help him become the pass rusher we all hope for!
"Jaylon Ferguson and Miles Boykin are the two non-rookies whose progress this season will likely define us.  We'll be a good team even if we get very little from those two, but if we can get breakout seasons from one or both, the sky's the limit."
"I expect him to have 2 more quality seasons, then put up 15 sacks in the last year of his rookie deal then sign elsewhere (see Z, McPhee, Kruger, etc)"
"Fergunsun missed a good amount of training camp with an undisclosed back injury.  I don‚Äôt expect him to get more time snaps at OLB then Bowser or McPhee at least for the first couple games, but he will see more snaps at OLB then Ward."
"Per Wink, Jaylon came into camp in great shape.  Wink had said last year that Jaylon didn‚Äôt really get into pro shape until about halfway through the season. I think the offseason additions of Campbell and Wolfe will help get him more favorable matchups and one-on-ones this season. By year two the game generally starts to slow down for guys and they usually make a sizable jump in productivity. I would wager Jaylon improves this season and has around 8-9 sacks."
"This year? I expect nothing of him. Develop, get a few snaps, don‚Äôt embarrass yourself, and I‚Äôll be pleased. That being said, I mean develop. I expect the kid to break into a starting role 1-2 seasons from now"
"My conservative hope for Ferg is something similar to Bowser last year. Around 5 or 6 sacks, but kinda streaky, with maybe one or two big splash plays that make a casual fan go ‚Äúwho the hell is Jaylon Ferguson‚Äù."
hopeful but not super optimistic
"Honestly, I don't expect much more than what we got from last year. He's still fat as hell and there's been nothing coming out of camp that he adding any other moves to his arsenal. I want him to succeed so bad, but I'm not gonna get excited until I see something on field.

I really wish we had a preseason lol"
Seems like the ravens tried to do some funky trade of Clowney.  Maybe they didn‚Äôt see Jaylon stepping up in practice or maybe they thought getting Clowney was too good to be true.
Ferguson got a lot of playing time as a rookie and was... not good. Most 3rd rounders don't pan out and I think it's very unlikely he does.

"Sooo, can someone smarten me up on cap stuff here. If we traded for him from the jags, wouldn‚Äôt we still be stuck with the contract? Or would the jags eat some of it, thus making this a thing where jags are buying draft pics?"
Imagine if EDC got us Hopkins and Clowney... This man already stole 2 all pros he almost did it again lol. EDC is always ready to make something happen.
"Basically, the Jags would pay him more money up front and then trade him to use for a high draft slot. Effectively ‚Äúbuying‚Äù a draft pick from us. Other leagues do this, NFL has not allowed it."
"Even if it didn't work out, I love EDC thinking outside of the box."
"Coming from a casual ravens fan, who do we have such a good relationship with in the Jaguars organization. 

Ravens seem to always be linked to their players and have traded with them with Campbell now.

Is this a Eric Decosta thing?"
"Well, at least he wanted to come here. Time to move on and get ready for those Browns...."
This confirms he's not good enough to overcome the cap hit we'd take.
all this is telling me is that we‚Äôre gonna be right back here next FA
"Still don‚Äôt know why NFL doesn‚Äôt allow sign and trades like these. It‚Äôs a win-win for both teams. Jags get draft capital, but eat a portion of cap for Clowneys bonus, and Ravens would get Clowney and he‚Äôd take up less cap."
I‚Äôm not too keen on Clowney anyway I don‚Äôt think he hustles on defense which is our culture on that side of the ball
This year it makes sense to carry more cap into the season. Never know who might opt out or be ruled out due to positive tests. Smart to keep a larger Emergency fund
No cap
Soooo we can think Judon and a pick?
"In this thread: downvote anyone that thinks we could have used some EDGE help, or anyone that calls out what a massive circle jerk this thread is."

"Clay Matthews and Cam Wake are still on the market and we have about $16m in cap space right now (not including the expected ET3 grievance which I believe will drop us to $12m). 

Would it be more worth it to get a team friendly 1 year deal on a veteran pass rusher, or is it more worth our while to let the cap roll over for when we eventually have to pay our young core?"
Both are washed.
Let's let Bowser ball out and work for his payday this year
I'd rather have Suggs back than either of those two.
Too many big in-house contracts on the horizon. Me personally I‚Äôd let it roll over.
"With the uncertainty around the cap next year and the need to pay Stanley, Humphrey and Lamar I'd say let it roll over. Since we didn't draft an EDGE we desperately need Ferguson to develop this year."
"Right now, ill let the cap roll over. We have a very good team. I would just let the young guys get more experience."
We don‚Äôt even need those players lol
I‚Äôm for letting it roll over. Cap is expected to shrink next year and we have some key players that we will want to try to sign
Everyone puts too much weight in people being veterans.
"If last season was any indication, they'll roll with our guys until they prove they need help and then we'll make a move"
"The trade deadline is still open and injuries happen so nobody should be too much in a hurry to spend what little bit of cap that is left. Let the process play itself out. Worst comes to worst, if money isn't spent it can be next year in a year where the cap is going to be reduced."
"Let it roll over as it stands, but if somebody gets hurt I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to give either a call."
Rolling over cap space is dumb. A dollar of cap in 2020 is worth more than a dollar of cap in 2021 because the salary cap (except in extreme circumstances) inflates.

"Also, I'd like to add, Art Modell was the best thing that ever happened to that garbage franchise and terrible city, and the more you blame him for your losing culture, the sweeter the ""Art"" tag looks on our second superbowl jersies"
"I also find it hilarious that the Steelers and other franchises stuck up for Cleveland when Art wanted to move the team, but Pittsburgh and the rest of the league was radio fucking silent when Irsay ran out of town in the middle of the night in a blizzard. Literally lied to everyone on local news, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not moving the damn team.‚Äù A team with 3 NFL titles, and 1 Super Bowl victory, vanishes overnight. Literally nobody outside of Baltimore cared when it happened. Why should we care about Cleveland‚Äôs announced move? Not to mention the whole 12 year wait vs 3 year wait thing. 

Commissioner Tagliabue came to the negotiating table and helped Cleveland, as opposed to Comissioner Rozelle who approved the Colts move without question (Rozelle later wrote in his autobiography that it was the worst decision he made as commissioner).

Baltimore and Cleveland both filed imminent domain lawsuits to keep their team‚Äôs history when moves were announced. You can figure out on your own which city got screwed and which city got to keep their history. 

The Colts used Johnny U and footage of Baltimore in their uniform release video a couple months ago, and switched to the old number font and horseshoe worn in Baltimore. When did we wear Browns unis? Oh that‚Äôs right, never.

We are still being slapped in the face with the Colts move to this very day while Cleveland owns their history outright. The Baltimore Colts history is locked behind an Indianapolis vault, and we will never get it back. Cleveland fans need to stop crying, you‚Äôre lucky you even have a team."

After the latest Odell Beckham news I think a more appropriate name would be the Cleveland Steamers.
"i go into every season feeling indifferent about the browns. they‚Äôre honestly so pathetic year in and year out that i can‚Äôt hate them.

but then they get odell, my favorite player in the nfl before lamar joined us, and i had to sit there watching baker constantly overthrowing and playing like shit. then they had their only good game of the year against us and treated it like the super bowl.

i can‚Äôt think of a city more deserving of the browns than cleveland. i‚Äôm so glad that no matter what i‚Äôll be able to tell my kids about ravens super bowls even if they never win another in my lifetime, something a browns fan likely won‚Äôt see. i don‚Äôt know what it would be like to tell my kid we picked top 10 every season"

"i'm feeling really rude today so let's just say it. we here in baltimore with the colts leaving are like when your girlfriend breaks up with you, so you go out and find a nicer, smarter, hotter, more successful girlfriend. the browns over there are the ex-boyfriend who lingers around the ex-girlfriends life, keeps on reminiscing about what could have been while she has definitely moved on, and eventually gets a new girlfriend who is definitely not an improvement."
"I've always said that if Cleveland does make a super bowl run, it will be the most unimpressive thing ever. Like you've had how many top 5 draft picks in the last few decades? The NFL is almost designed to gift you a lombardi at this point but they still lose."
This is the way
"In life it‚Äôs important to carefully consider your opinions, examine your biases, and do your best to understand the viewpoints of others. However sports are supposed to be about fun and blind indulgence of emotion!

One word: Brilliant!
The Cleveland Steamers
"Friendly reminder that the team we ""stole"" was objectively bad.

They were below .500 when the move was announced. Only one of the teams they beat had a winning record. The teams they lost to weren't world-beaters either(10-6 DET, 10-6 BUF, 7-9 HOU, 6-10 NE, 4-12 JAX), so they couldn't even beat bad teams. They were mediocre at-best in nearly every statistic at that point, too. (Bottom five scoring offense, bottom 12 scoring defense, bottom five in yards allowed, bottom 12 in third-down conversion rate, worst third down rate allowed on defense, I can go on)

The '95 Browns were plain bad, and those were the real Belichick Browns, not the 11-5 '94 Browns. The teams they beat in 1994 were 7-9 on-average, and the teams they lost to were 10-6 on-average. The 1994 team wasn't good, it was mediocre and got an inflated record courtesy of getting four games against the Bengals and Oilers, two teams who won a combined five games and drafted #1 and #3. (It would've been #1 and #2 if not for the expansion Jaguars)

Pretending that the team would've followed the exact same trajectory, just a little further northwest, if they had never left Cleveland, is nonsensical. Maybe Marchibroda goes to Cleveland, but given the part his old Baltimore connection played in the fit, I doubt that. Billick probably wouldn't have, given he was their top choice in 1999 and he turned them down. It's not like he was snubbing them to join a powerhouse either, we were 6-10 in 1998. He specifically didn't want to be in Cleveland, and that 2000 team doesn't happen without Billick. Sure you have Ozzie, but that team can be as talented as you want it and it doesn't matter a bit if you have a bad coach.

The ""stolen glory"" narrative is BS cooked up by people who, without football for three years, had nothing to distract themselves from the depressing reality that is living in Cleveland. Let them have it, they're not worth the effort of convincing otherwise."
"Week 1 is going to such a fucking good game. See ya there, Ratbirds."
"We need the pic of Art holding the Lombardi in here as well, maybe on gameday?"
Wow this is mean
"Art totally fucked them over but who cares fuck cleveland, its funnier that way"

Is it wrong for me to find it in poor taste how the announcers keep talking about how $$$$ Mahomes and Watson signed their deals for? Idk. Especially when people are struggling

Chiefs are a problem
It's weird to think about how the Ravens are gonna be playing both of these teams in the next 3 weeks
Chiefs defense isn‚Äôt elite. But you have to keep up with Mahomes. Week 3 is going to be a good game.
Starting the fuck the chiefs early because I know in a couple years we are going to hate them like Pittsburgh and New England
blew my hammie today in sacrifice for our squad
Why do the announcers have too keep reminding me how rich Watson and Mahomes are and how poor I am??
It's good to hear Kelechi's name with some praise
Oh man. I like the vibe in here much better!
Now that they've signed Watson to a big deal they should probably consider giving him an offensive line

The Chiefs really Milton Berle'd that game.
"I thought I saw some bad officiating on that TD drive.  A hold that should have been called.  A chop block.    But frankly, I have no idea what the rules are anymore NFL has changed so many times."
Mahomes threw several terrible pick-worthy passes but was bailed out by stupid defensive penalties and dropped interceptions. Not impressed. I honestly think if you swapped him and deshaun and put Deshaun on the chiefs he would be talked about like Mahomes.
Chiefs are for real damn

Our 2014 offense was arguably the best of the Flacco era, and to go up by 14 points twice on the Pats in New England and then lose was just devastating, especially with the trickery and smugness of Pats fans with the ineligible receiver chicanery."

I dont really have any reason not to like you guys so I'm hoping to come on in and watch miami from a distance. Anything outside of the obvious I should know getting in? I know ketchup because Heinz field but what is the upvote supposed to be? What teams do we clown on like the browns and bengals, also what players to hate and stuff."
Ray and Ed came from The U. Welcome.
Old Bay my friend. Put it on EVERYTHING
"Upvote is old bay. It‚Äôs a seasoning which is famous here in Maryland. It‚Äôs most famous for going on crabs but we put it on a bunch of other stuff....fries, corn, veggies etc

Our main rival is the (Fuck the)Steelers. Since about the early/mid 2000s it‚Äôs been one of the best rivalries in sports let alone football. Both us and them were known as super physical defensive teams. We always had knock em out slugfest styles games with them. The intensity on the field has died down some with a lot of the key pieces in the rivalry retiring and both teams shifting philosophies. It‚Äôs definitely a respectful hate. We hate them down to our cores, but we also respect them. 

Browns rivalry is more of a fan rivalry. They hate us because we took the team they couldn‚Äôt succeed with and turned it into one of the best organizations in sports. Meanwhile, they got another team and immediately drove that team straight into the ground. Their fans talk a lot especially for having almost no success. They are most notably known for being back to back off-season champs. 

Bengals are kind of just there. They were a nuisance back when they had Carson Palmer, Ocho, and TJ whoseyourmamma, but most Ravens fans held no ill will toward them outside of Burifect (fuck that guy). Marvin Lewis their long time HC was the DC on our 2000 super bowl team. Most of us really liked him.

Patriots are our biggest non division rival. We always seemed to play them well. We‚Äôve knocked them off in the playoffs a bunch of times. I‚Äôm sure you can appreciate that. They don‚Äôt like us, we don‚Äôt like them. 

I‚Äôd say just watch our games and let the player hate come naturally. There used to be a ton of Steelers players we hated like Joey Porter, Hines Ward, James Harrison, and Plexico Burress. Once you start getting I to the teams you‚Äôll just naturally start disliking certain people. 

Other fun facts....hmmm we have one of the last and the oldest NFL marching bands. They used to play for the colts before they left. There‚Äôs a pretty interesting 30/30 on them. We‚Äôre named after Edgar Allen Poe‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúThe Raven‚Äù who lived and died in Baltimore. Poe is also the name of our mascot. Fans still do the [seven nation army](https://youtu.be/CGRThLyuN1U). We‚Äôre responsible for one of the loudest [‚Äúmanure‚Äù chants](https://youtu.be/AkYheL5dULY) as Al Michaels stated. We scream ‚ÄúO‚Äù during the last line of the national anthem (which was written in Baltimore). 

Lastly if you‚Äôre going to be hanging around our sub, here are some things you will need to know.

-Llama=Lamar Jackson
-Marvin= Marlon Humphrey
-Dragon/Elite Dragon=Joe Flacco
-You will at some point get bucked and/or Jk‚Äôd 
-We just lost our sweet prince to the Jets. We‚Äôre still in mourning
-EDC=Eric DeCosta
     -It is know that EDC has a giant dong that may or
may not have magical trade powers. 

Otherwise just hangout here and shoot the shit with us. You‚Äôll catch on quick."
"Aye man anyone is welcome as long as they don't go around giving the organization and the fanbase a bad name. Hop on and strap in, cause this season gonna be wild"
"Come on down man! Miami has brought up many players for us, like Ray, Reed, both Lamar and Hollywood from Miami."
"Lewis. Reed. McGahee. The U has been pretty much the reservoir for our greatest players. 

That's not to mention that Lamar and Hollywood are from the Miami area!

Welcome, friend"

"Dolphins are on the up... just stay with them. They'll be solid within the next two years, and remaining loyal to your team feels better than falling off a bandwagon."
all aboard choooo choooo
Honestly this time it seems the front office is doing things the way they should. I‚Äôm hard on all of the AFCe teams but I will admit that having your ass kicked 2 times a year by the greatest dynasty in the history of sports is probably not conducive to making non-reactionary front office decisions. I really like Brian Flores and the draft/trade strategy these last 2 years. Don‚Äôt give up hope. The big bad wolf is finally gone for you guys and the rest of the division is still as weak as ever.
Look I'm not the biggest hater of Chiefs. But I seriouslyl did not expect that.
"My son's reaction to it: ""It's Missouri, what did you expect?""

Midwest rednecks are the absolute worst."
"It was never about the flag, this is a group of people who think it‚Äôs a good idea to go to a sporting event during a pandemic, and the game was played in Missouri.

It‚Äôs disappointing, but not surprising sadly."
They should've left the field after that.
Ravens fans did the same thing when the Ravens had a moment of silence/prayer before the national anthem for the 2017 Raiders game
What do you expect from a fan base still doing that racist ass tomahawk chop bs.
"I wasn't sure what to make of any of that.

They said they were going to do something as a sign of unity and all they did was link arms.  Then *some * boos.
I am not sure what was going on. Either way I saw no reason to boo unless it was about social distancing."
It‚Äôs Kansas what would you expect?
[removed]
"Outside of the reddit bubble, this is how most people feel."
Dissing the country and flag will kill off their fan base.  Their not the sharpest knifes in the drawer.  Bye bye nfl...

"Exercise is hard? Lamar looks like a god, and he doesn‚Äôt even train full time (He owns his own clothing brand and has a partial stake in 3 of Steve Bisciotti‚Äôs chicken tender restaurants). Anyone who thinks otherwise is a dope smokin pussy licker.

He slaps skin with beautiful women so often that he can just use that as cardio to save time. He has between 1-3 girlfriends at any given time, and he powerfucks them all like a gorilla. In fact, the sex gets so intense in his mansion that he keeps a massage therapist on call to help him recover postfuck. He does more mobility work after sex than he does before/after he trains."

Gotta wonder if we coulda signed Clowney outright if we had done this last week

Truzz EDC though, probably just preparing some mid-season moves"
"Well we do have a fifth round pick just collecting dust... 

Trade for Aaron Donald confirmed"
Would love an extension with Ronnie or Marlon but it could be just cap space for the season because of injuries and bigger practice squads. Sorry for being a pessimist
So we got big baby in town for this season and next season? But after that i assume we probably have to left him go
"So with all these two year deals, this is def the window for the vets SB rings. I don‚Äôt think guys like Jimmy, MP, and BWill will be back after their contracts expire and we got hella people to re-sign. Our team can still be really exciting in two years with so many young studs. Our future looks really stable even with a big deal for Lamar. EDC has really impressed me with how he‚Äôs handled the cap situation."

But my cousin wanted me to pick a team that I would consider the favourite of mine so I just looked at all the teams and picked the one with the coolest logo. Then I watched the Dolphins game cause I was bored and I was like ""holy shit these Ravens are actually really good"" and that got me to love NFL. Watching that Miami game was one of the best decisions of my life cause now NFL is like my favourite thing ever. And I'm so glad that I chose the Ravens cause they have so great history and they're the best organisation in the league by far. And also, fuck the Steelers."
"Was a Packers fan as a kid. My Dad converted me during the 97 season. There's been ups and downs, lots of yelling at the TV, lot of hear breaking moments. Wouldn't give any of it back.

Been a fan since I was born- as a little kid I‚Äôd always rewatch the vhs tape of the 2000 super bowl run. Just magical
Feed. The. Snead.

We‚Äôll see who the true fans really are when times get tough (hopefully not soon)
Lamar is definitely my favorite to watch in the game. Been rooting for his since his draft interview. See you guys in the AFC championship game
"I remember having a big argument with my buddy in summer 2019. He was convinced Lamar would be a total dud and I was indignant -  arguing for his speed, work ethic and the raw skills he displayed in college. Never in a million years did I expect the season we got, but oh boy was the vindication sweet"

"The Athletic did a ranking on each NFL team's future outlook based on QB, coaching, front office, personnel, etc. Ravens beat out the Chiefs for the #1 spot (mainly due to Lamar still being on a rookie contract).

Hard to pick one Ed moment, but a cool, rather obscure, one was were he picked Manning off twice in a 6 play span in the playoffs. First int he fumbled from garcon punching it out. Second int was called back from a Corey Ivy penalty away from the play."
The greatest safety ever. Fuck with me.
"Ravens vs Dolphins Wildcard 2008.

Fresh into football, no idea who the Ravens were and then Reed took it to the house. My favorite player ever since. I'm kinda war I missed his best years. But that made me also miss Boller, so I can't be too mad about it."

What are they going showing the only qb with Super Bowls rings?
"With Ward's hand fracture and Breeland's 4-game suspension, the Chiefs will have to play without their starting CBs in week 3. 

What is the chance of having multiple WR sets that week? Maybe a Brown-Snead-Duvernay?"
"It definitely doesn't hurt, but we need to go in ready to POUND the rock like we did in 2018. We really almost had them in 2018 when we played a physical, smash mouth, ball control style.

Last year, we tried to play hyper aggressive and pass too much. It's great as long as you keep scoring, but if you falter at any point, the Chiefs will hit you back.

Their run defense looked pathetic last night against the Texans. I say we go in ready to run 40 times and just blast them in the dick

If we get them back on their heels and bringing heavier packages, then having backup CBs should make it easier to punish them with play action though"
It won‚Äôt change the gameplan too much. We will continue to do what we do best. The titans game shows that. Don‚Äôt stray from what works. We may find find by week 3 we are having more success stretching the field than pounding the rock. Lean on what‚Äôs working
Hopefully we put up 1000 yards on them im really sick of losing to that team
"After watching last night and the amount of weapons they have available, I'm going to say Baltimore is going to have to use all of them"
I mean we will definitely attack that on defense but their pass rush is good and I'm more worried about stopping them from scoring verses how we can score.
Actually ward will probably play with a cast on. He‚Äôs probably going to play next week too
Ward may end up playing with a cast.
The Chiefs four losses last year came when the opposing team had time of possession of 40+ minutes. It‚Äôs going to be about keeping Pat and Co. off of the field.
"> What is the chance of having multiple WR sets that week? 

We did this quite a bit last year. Don't see any reason we wouldn't this season."
"I mean the scary thing about the Chiefs is that they weren‚Äôt playing at their highest level, and still scored over 30. Like they were playing with their food."

This can truly be a chance for a boykin breakout game. I love Hollywood but hell most likely be shadowed by Ward, whose an excellent man corner and has the speed to keep up with him."
"I want us to play this game the way the chiefs did vs the Texans. No preseason and lack of practice time means a lot of pass protection stuff will be rusty, along with lots of other shit. I think we should try and keep it simple and play a power run game and ball control offense."
Didn‚Äôt  Lamar say he‚Äôs is going to be passing more this season and he really wants to focus on being a traditional QB? We all know what he‚Äôs going to do when he has to take off and I‚Äôm sure there will be 4-5 designed runs for him on Sunday. I‚Äôm not going to be totally surprised if we decide to throw 30+ times though. Browns might give us a fight to start the season.
Nobody has the speed to keep up with Hollywood üò§
"I think Boykin is gonna have a big year, relative to expectations. Hollywood is gonna be awesome this hear, and Boykin is gonna eat off of weaker coverage, generally."
"Put in a 3wr set with Hollywood, Devin Duv, and Boykin. And let Boykin cook...."
Sorry Boykin but I don't think the coaches are looking at Reddit. Just keep putting in the work and you'll get yours.
Our TEs are going to feast as is Snead. Slot and TEs are gonna hit thosw intermediate routes in between the #s. Their LB corn is suffering hardcore
Will anything this team does matter to you so long as we make the playoffs/stay healthy. Is this truly a season of ‚Äúshow me when it counts‚Äù? What‚Äôs a game everyone is circling on the schedule? Do we feel that this season is going to last long enough for the  playoffs to begin? Just wanted to get a temperature check on the sub before the game.
"Making playoffs of course is important, and of course as high a seed as possible since home field advantage is always nice. Even in a year without fans, not playing in KC with fans or playing somewhere with vastly different climate could help. 

But unsurprisingly I think the most important game is the Chiefs. Even if we lose others, I think we need to prove to ourselves and the rest of the league that we can beat the best. Being close doesn‚Äôt matter anymore, gotta finish. Even if it‚Äôs an ugly game that we win cuz of a last second field goal or stop, we need to walk out of there with a W to get the confidence for that postseason push"
What does making it to the playoffs to begin with mean?
"Any Given Sunday.

That being said, I earnestly feel that this team is the best set up Ravens team in history. The most dominant offense last season limped our defense into the playoffs only for them to give up the ghost. The Ravens have made serious improvements on the defense and built a future on the offense. Finally our schedule by DVOA is massively weaker than last year."
"16-0, said that shit last year and i was off by 2 games"
Division crown with 11-13 wins.
Win or lose (hopefully win) I just wanna see lamar jukin dudes out of there shoes.
"10-6. Wild Card playoff spot. Team will be good, but hard to replicate last year. AFC North will be very tough. All 3 other teams will be better than last year."
"Nothing gets me more hyped than seeing the ravens enter the field with the intros they get, and I‚Äôm site it‚Äôs the same for the players. They could just pre record the announcer and press play and televise it. I‚Äôm sure it won‚Äôt happen but it‚Äôs a dream."
"I‚Äôm a little confused by this, what entrances are you talking about exactly? If it‚Äôs just coming out of the tunnel, they almost always televise this live. I still have Ray Lewis‚Äôs last entrance at M&T Bank saved on my DVR"
"We've lost both Buck Allen, and Jaleel Scott, who's the next raven who's gonna step up and be the goat?"
The ghost of D‚ÄôAnthony Thomas
How about we just not force anything and let it come naturally. Jaleel was some weak sauce.

Last year was three headed tight ends this year is for headed RBs
Making some tweaks and changes to this!! Will post the updated one when done!!! Appreciate all the love this is getting

"Heavy on the under. Ravens don‚Äôt give rookies a lot of reps unless they have to, and they certainly don‚Äôt with Ingram and Edwards. JK will have reps to prove himself, but I doubt he has more than 7-8 touches. Unless he breaks a long one, he won‚Äôt go over"
"I would lean to the under. We have a lot of RBs to feed and a rookie in week 1 isnt likely to be the bell cow. 

Id think Ingram is going to get the most touches.

Then again total yards means passing too so if he rips off a few chunk play check downs he could get there.

Just my 2 cents , week 1 theres so many unknowns, that isnt a prop id feel good firing on."
Over because we‚Äôll have a 5 TD lead after the third so he‚Äôll see plenty of garbage time
"With Justice out, they might try to get him going. Really hoping he holds onto the ball and doesn‚Äôt make mistakes."
"Probably under, but I could see him ripping off a big run and finishing 7 for 83 or something like that."
For now I will take the Under. Last year Ingram‚Äôs total yards per game was approx 84. Once he‚Äôs named RB1 then safely the Over.
"Under, but for any skill or talent. 
I think Ingram and Jackson will have most of the ground yards but we will have a pretty balanced passing game too."
"Its easier to predict touches than yards. But I say with limited touches that he'll certainly be close to that. Could easily go over, just not enough without a score to justify starting him week 1 in fantasy. I have him. Benched him for Fuller. But can he get 80yds on Sunday. Ya he can. Dont forget last year Baltimore had Brown light it up week 1 and he was a fresh rookie."
"Whatever happens I just hope he plays smart, stays healthy, and gets good reps and experience in because we‚Äôre gonna need him a lot as the season goes further along. Also wondering if I should start him, Sony Michel, or Leonard Fournette in my FF league. Any advice?"
under I think. he might see a few snaps i doubt many more than 4 or 5 for the first couple weeks.
I'd say over if he was on any other team lol. I think he'll be out there for passing downs tbh
over
I say he gets around 80 yards. i think Harbaugh and the gang want to get Dobbins going as early as possible.
It really depends on how to first half of the game goes. If we have a sizable lead than I'll take the over. If it's close in the second half I'll take the under (it'll be close tho).
Under
The better question would be he'll have over or under 8 yds a carry. I say over.
He‚Äôll have a whole 3 quarters to run when we start resting our starters after the first quarter.

[deleted]
He‚Äôs WR4.  He will probably get to do some Kick Returns too.  If Snead gets hurt he‚Äôs probably next up for slot receiver the reason he‚Äôs behind Snead is that he isn‚Äôt anywhere near as good a blocker and doesn‚Äôt know the offense as well.
"Prob WR 3/4. May get a few snaps here and there early on. Has potential to rise up depth chart, because our receivers aren‚Äôt that great.

Edit: I expect them to mainly use him in the slot and on screen passes."
"Good question.

Not to many things violate this sub. 

Join us and be respectful and you can ask just about anything pertaining to ravens.

I will say, a lot of us are very excited to see what he can do with his unique skill set and physical frame."
"I‚Äôm a fan of both actually lol so I was HELLA pumped when we got him and still praying Elliot can stay healthy. This is Sneads last yeAr under contract and I firmly believe this is his last year as a raven as well in part to us drafting his replacement Duvernay. I believe he‚Äôll have a very successful rookie season with a few big plays here and there. But nothing too crazy this season just because of the lack of an offseason and preseason. I actually think due to his speed after our week 8 bye, he‚Äôll be pushing Snead to the sideline"
I think he‚Äôs gonna get a shot at KR tomorrow with Hill being out.
"I think the guy is going to be a rock star here.
I am looking forward to big things from him."

So unreasonable. Browns ain't scoring 10

"Whoa whoa whoa... still repping Madden 20??

Me too lol"
"24-20 ravens win this one. I have Ingram, Andrews, and Edwards scoring"
I'll lay it out for you as truthfully and strategically as I can. The Ravens will struggle tomorrow and come out with a 55-6 win. Lamar Jackson has another perfect passer rating game with 6 TDS thrown and 1 run.
Anyone else expecting another highlight tape of Hollywood catching bombs and going the distance?
The Browns have a depleted CB group. Hollywood & Mandrews are gonna go off. I think we start with the pass to set up the run.
My prediction was 42-14 Ravens win. Lamar gets 4 passing 1 rushing TDs.
"69-0. 5 for Lamar, 3 for Rg3 and 2 for T-Mac. 

Koch & Tuck succesfully go for 2 on the last TD, but the play is ultimately deemed null due to an illegal block in the back by Ravens Team Mascot, Poe."
"No, there‚Äôs no way we are scoring that much, sorry

24-14 Ravens"
"Hi all!  With Chris Moore and Justice Hill out for the game, how big of an impact will this have on our ST unit?"
"Moore was good at downing balls on punts deep in the opponent‚Äôs territory, but I‚Äôd imagine some of the young players step up to fill that role. (Maybe Proche). Hill I don‚Äôt think will be missed as much. You also have to remember Harbaugh was a special teams coach, and we have Tucker, Cox and Koch who will for sure do their parts."
Maybe a slight impact on punt coverage as most of the kickoffs go out of the end zone now.
I'm working on one and I wish I could get some feedback on whether or not it's HQ enough and if I'm being too pointed. I don't have any super premium tools or editing experience so I don't know if joining in will help represent or lower the quality and make us look bad.
"If John Harbaugh were here (because he‚Äôs everybody‚Äôs dad), he would say ‚Äútrust yourself. I‚Äôm sure whatever you will come up with will be great!‚Äù"
"I'm sure it'll be quality! If you want, PM the gif to some people if you want feedback"
"Dude you got a post to the top of our sub so I'm stalking your profile looking for dirt. OF COURSE YOU SHOULD POST. Are people going to talk shit on the quality? Yes it's going to get torn to shreds. Do they really mean it or should you care? No. Gif wars online are one of the funniest purely entertainment-driven phenomenon I've ever witnessed. Anyone who shows real anger over a gif, or admonishes someone for not being a pro animator is a piece of shit anyway. Being a part of a stupid subreddit rivalry instead of just commenting makes it that much better. So who cares if it's not going to win an Oscar. I've had gifs flop a couple times but I've never considered not posting."

"Well, Ricard helped.  That‚Äôs not an easy assignment"
Boyle is definately one of the most underrated tight ends in the league

"When we resigned him to that 3 year deal, there was a lot of talking heads saying we overpaid (because people only look at the stat lines).  

I remember someone, maybe one of the coaches or an analyst who actually watches games said having him on the field is like having an extra Guard out there, and this was a great signing.  Then it came out that there was a strong market for him."
Isn't Boyle rated higher than a lot of offensive linemen on blocking? WELL worth his salary
"Definitely solid, but Garret initially looked inside where Boyle had help (likely just trying to get eyes in the backfield tbh) then Ricard popped over with a chip and release across the middle. Boyle didn't seem to bed the help, so big props to him against a huge adversary."
Wow. Boyle! That is insane. A TE blocking a top 3 NFL pass rusher like that.
"Boyle is absolutely manhandling Garret. Ricard comes in to chip him but it was barely needed. Even if Garret got off Boyle, Lamar gets the ball out we'll before Garret even touches him."
"I'm a lifelong Jets fan, fully indoctrinated by my father, also a lifelong Jets fan. However I also call myself a pragmatist, and have a hard time supporting ANY organization - sport, political, or enterprise - that has no skill in operation.

Most recently the Jets hired Adam Gase as head coach - a man who has done little more in his career than carry water for a veteran Peyton Manning. He'd continued to prove he brings no innovation or value to this offense.

Even before that, our owner looks to a NFL Network talking head to help him hire a GM, because he himself is damn clueless. That gave us Idzik, another example of Jets mediocrity.

I've watched over the years as the Jets have tried to be competent. The closest they came was while mimicking the Baltimore Ravens - hiring Rex, bringing in Bart, and building up the defense to an actual contender.

Now I watch the Jets and I'm just pissed at the ineptitude. Add to that the owner is now in the Trump Admin sexually harassing people (sorry for the hint of politics) and I really want little to do with the Jets anymore.

Beyond that, I just admire how the Ravens are run. They know how to draft, scout, and build a team around its strengths. The Lamar Jackson draft again proves the genius of Ozzie. I cannot believe Mayfield went #1 and Jackson fell so far. I find myself cheering every time Lamar beats the shit out of the Browns, and hope the Ravens continue to destroy them for the foreseeable future. I hope Cleveland regrets that draft for years to come.

A lot is going on in the world right now, and I find myself much more impatient to useless worry and stress. I'm also a Mets/Knicks fan (thanks again, Dad) so something has to give. The Jets are becoming a useless worry to me - especially after the Jamal drama. Good riddance to him - I'm glad he's not our issue anymore, but man do I wish I could follow a team that is all business. If Gase isn't gone soon, the Ravens might be that team.

I've never considered joining a bandwagon until now. I wonder, am I a Ravens fan?? Does B-More welcome wayward fans from crappy teams like NYJ? Either way, I hope Lamar gets his (first) ring this year - Sam Darnold sure as hell isn't."
About time the Ravens of the North fans start defecting to the mother land.
"Bro you're always welcome here! Just 3 ground rules:

"If you‚Äôre still on the fence do some research on our owner Steve Biscotti. 

Dude made his fortune off employment companies. Turns out, hiring the best people and knowing how to keep a dedicated and respectful atmosphere is good business for ANY organization. 

It‚Äôs the reason we‚Äôve been considered such a well run organization. It all starts with the owner as you‚Äôve come to realize. It‚Äôs amazing how far that effect trickles down. I mean, the players are well respected enough to basically make their own roster changes ala ET3‚Äôs release. 

It‚Äôs been a point to draft and recruit people who are enjoyable to be around and having good character. It‚Äôs very easy to root for not just the players but the FO as well. I absolutely do not blame you for wanting to leave the jets fandom as they have done nothing to earn your continued loyalty. They simply pray off indoctrination as you mentioned."
Hey dont get down you guysbare basically the ravens without success cause you guys sign anyone we dont.

This is a joke right? Where‚Äôs Buck?
"I mean their analysis is fine, but to put them above us!? What the actual fuck?"
"Bruh the Steelers did not look that good against the Giants, the worst team over the last three years. They had moments but it wasn't a top five performance"
"Their defense is absolutely elite. They will ride that and a good coaching staff to a top 10 finish. Their offense will struggle, and so will Ben. All that said, they are not a better team than the Ravens. That‚Äôs just ridiculous!"
Their defense is so nasty that they let the giants drive down the field multiple times and they got lucky with that goal line interception.
Imagine hating Lamar so much you do stupid shit like this in articles that he will never even see.  Just one minuscule example of the kind of shit he has had to deal with.
"""Aaron Rodgers sure looked washed up. How dumb that thinking was came true against the Vikings...""

wut"
They slob ok the steelers knob so much it‚Äôs ridiculous. I can‚Äôt wait to fuck them up.
"This is just a reminder to not believe in any power rankings, even if it says we‚Äôre no.1"
"I saw a post in r/NFL that said over the past 3 years, the giants have had a worse record than the Browns, and that includes the 0-16 Browns. 

So if your team is struggling one of the worst team in the past 3 years... that‚Äôs pretty alarming for ya. 

It‚Äôs honestly because of Ben. The announcers were praising that man all game even though he played subpar. So much bias I can‚Äôt believe it"
who the hell ranked father time ahead of the ravens?
"Whatever opponent adjustments you want to give to the Ravens, you should give even more to the Steelers. The Giants have one of the worst offensive lines I've ever seen."
ü§Æ
This must be Pete 'fucking' Pisscunt!
I haven‚Äôt cared about any power ranking since 2011. I care about us playing and winning in January and February
"They had an extremely pedestrian offense(30th in yards, 27th in points) last year, and were still 8-8 because their defense kept them in games. Shoot, they still had a chance to reach the playoffs at the end of season. If Ben stays healthy, and that's a big IF, you have to think they will have a much better offense. And when you couple a good offense with that defense, they can be dangerous. Don't sleep on them.

&#x200B;

With all that being said, no fucking way in hell they should be above the Ravens."
"This is like tier 2 clickbait, dont fall for it. Who cares?

Every site makes rankings and it means fuck all for every team but one in February ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
I guess we could be Division Champs for five years in a row and the Steelers are still a better team. These people are so dumb.
didnt we beat them with RG3 when they had a playoff berth riding on it?
This is the same company that employs JLC...so yeah not super credible
Anyone else notice Ben constantly grabbing his left knee in that game?
HAHAAHAHAHAAHA
Power Rankings are one half analysis and one half putting what ever popular team is minutely good near the top to generate clicks.
"The Aaron Rodgers line and the green bay ranking is all the more insane to me. He had one good game after years of not being quite what he used to be, and all the sudden they're the second-best team? This list is awful"
GOOD!!!!!
"Having the Saints above us is just as insulting. Their offense looks mediocre and Thomas is now out several weeks.

Edit: This is Pete Prisco, who I think is legitimately retarded, so maybe we should be nicer. He had the Packers at #2 going into the season. Maybe Aaron Rodgers is legitimately pissed off, puts that team on his back, and starts playing at an elite level again, but they were an overrated team last year and had a bad offseason."
The writing is almost as bad as the analysis.
Ravens were the only team to hold their opponent to single digits and have won 3 consecutive season openers by at least 30 PTs..... an absolute joke
"Apparently beating the Giants > beating a division rival? And the Ravens were arguably the 2nd best team in the NFL last year and look *even better*, but suddenly we're not even the best team in our division?

What a fucking joke. People are so eager for the Steelers to be good and the Ravens to regress it's embarrassing."
"Yeah, I‚Äôm a Steelers fan and there is no way I put them ahead of Baltimore.  I know they won on the road but you‚Äôre win was the most impressive of the week imo. Just doing it to stir shit up"
"Hot take clickbait, that‚Äôs all there is to see here."
"The only reason I can see for this, is Fat Boy is back in the line up. They seem to think Ben is a game changer."
4D Chess; someone's paying reporters to write up hot-take articles and power rankings for bulletin board material.
"I'm usually the first to say who gives a fuck about Power Rankings. When I saw this shit I came straight.to Reddit looking for this thread.

What the actual fuck. I hate the Steelers but respect the actual fuck out of them. If they were legitimately a great team I would have no problem with this. But in no way in hell are the Steelers a top 5 team based on beating.the Giants........"
Weird
Does anyone know if there‚Äôs going to be wired episodes this year?

I still think Gus deserves more reps. He‚Äôs been consistent for 3 years and gets a lot of chunk yards.
Well done!!
"Literally every time I see Dobbins I think he‚Äôs Rice. His play style, build and number was uncanny on Sunday. Was looking for Jamal until I realized this was the current group and not all time RBs."
"Baltimore-Core-4-Corps. | BR's RBs 2020:

* Mark Ingram II #21
* J.K. Dobbins #27
* Gus ""The Bus"" Edwards #35
* (...And) Justice (4) Hill #43"
"Some suggestions: Have all 4 in the same jersey color. Also, Dobbins' Ford patch from his practice jersey looks really out of place. I get that pics were limited and that was practically all available until this past weekend. 

Bearing these things in mind, I'd personally prefer them all in white jerseys, so each player pops off that beautiful backdrop ‚Äî especially since the only regular season game action for Dobbins thus far has come via white tops. Plus, those shots of Gus & Justice are picture-perfect! 

You could still have them slightly differentiated in that two could be in white jerseys/black pants (Gus & Justice from the 2019 regular season Bills road game & 2019 preseason Packers home game, respectively), whereas Ingram & Dobbins could be wearing the purple pants.

Granted, I suppose the pants portions could be cropped out, too, of course. I found a few photos of those two in said uniform combinations that might work together, depending upon what would need done for sizing/proportion-fitting & image-positioning purposes:

Potentially, there will be opportunities to wait until after this Sunday for some game action snapshots of Dobbins sporting the purple top, since Houston will be wearing all white for their home opener, as per usual. 

On the other hand, I wonder if you could somehow Photoshop out the Ford patch, and otherwise just leave everything else the same? Obviously, this is your own creation, so whatever your preferences are matter the most above all else!

Additionally, I do love this as is (sans that practice patch). However, I just felt compelled to chime in with some suggestive options that MAY make this look even more awesome! Regardless whether you consider any of this, thanks for the quality content!"
The League is not ready.

"My thoughts are that its going to be much much harder than the Browns, but that I still expect to win."
"Other than Deshaun, not one person of their offense scares me."
"Any given sunday, but without Hopkins I don‚Äôt see their wr‚Äôs having any success vs our secondary, meaning we can blitz all day, which historically Watson has struggled with. Our offence will put up points like it always does. It is a good matchup for us"
"Offensively they're worse across the board than Cleveland is except at QB, which is a pretty significant step up. I expect them to test our defense more but even so I think we have the edge in that matchup.

Defensively they don't really match up all that well against us. JJ Watt is a good player but he's not 2015 Watt anymore. Their front seven does have good players around him but their DBs should struggle, particularly with Hollywood's speed. They'll need to *really* harass Lamar to protect their back end, which was Cleveland's strategy and it didn't work very well at all.

Overall they're a good team but I think we have the edge. We'll see how much their extra prep days help them but on paper we take this one."
Shutout
Last year they had the best receiver in the league and a bye week to prepare and got absolutely smoked. This year they have a couple extra days to prepare after looking like complete shit front to back after no real offseason. 52-10
"I was scared last year with Deandre Hopkins, not so much this year.


I don‚Äôt see how they score more than 14 points."
I‚Äôd like to see how fired up the texans come out playing. I‚Äôm sure they haven‚Äôt forgotten last years blowout so I‚Äôm sure they will give us all they have. I think if we can get out of the first half with a close game or even a small lead though I think we should comfortably come out in the second half ready to grind out the win.
"I‚Äôm excited to see us against a better qb. Watson looked bad week 1, not sure if it‚Äôs the loss of Hop or what, but last year we dominated their souls. I hope to see the same"
It‚Äôs gonna be nice having a tougher matchup before the chiefs game
"JJ Watt isn‚Äôt better then Garrett at this point in there respective careers, but Watt is a matchup nightmare for us, because he will challenge our interior line where only Bozeman is solid."
In my head. I keep saying we win by 13. I think that's more than believable.
"As long as we dont let Watson get comfortable, we should be ok.."

Considering the ravens are the browns 2.0. Welcome.
Acting like jumping ship now includes all the years since '95 is funny. Brush up on the dark days we sat through while you wore Brown and Orange before posturing like you have tenure.
""
Don't see 4th and 41 very often!
That was a sweet drive for sure. I also really enjoyed the thirty five second TD drive before the half after Beckham flubbed a third and two pass and the Browns missed the field goal ten yards right. Swinging from a possible 17-13 outcome on their last drive to down 24-6 had to ruin their halftime break.
"That game had two really great signs.

The 99 yard drive you mentioned and the perfectly executed two minute drill for a touchdown (only took us 49 seconds I believe).

The only criticism I have with Sunday's game is that Lamar should have come out a lot sooner than he did."
"That's a net 140 yds driven by the entire Ravens team offense and defense when you actually think about it. I don't believe it has ever happened before or will happen again in the NFL. For the defense to back up a team by 41 yds in 3 downs and then for the offense on the very next drive to march down 99 yds for a whopping 140 net yards total in consecutive drives is unimaginably great. But, when you play the Browns great things happen to the Ravens just like the 295 yds rushed by Jamal Lewis all those years ago."
"To be honest, 25 outta those 41 were forced by themselves. 3 consecutive Flags: Facemask OBJ and I believe two false starts. You know, the Browns doing Browns things."
How those 3rd and 4th downs aren't being talked about more is beyond me. I am choosing to  view it as a sign of things to come.
"Yeah that punt was awesome, I figured we were going to have a fruitless drive, hopefully getting up the field enough to get a decent punt off, but actually scoring there was so awesome"
""
""
""
If this actually happens then this will be the second consecutive year in which we beat our week 1 opponent so badly that the player they spent their second-most recent first round pick on got panic traded.
"It's funny how they've gone from ""Baker is the future and we have so many weapons"" to ""We look so good on paper. Why can't we get it together!?"""
"I honesty think this is a Ownership issue. 

After all these QBs, coaches, etc and you arguably have your best roster in a while. You can‚Äôt figure it out???"
why is this in the ravens sub
"No we dont need him but EDC has been very aggressive in the trade market Peters, Campbell hell he even tried to swing a trade for Hopkins and Clowney lol. Im expecting EDC to keep an eye on the situation."
Not true but ARob is one of the most underrated wrs in the league. He would instantly be our WR1.
"He‚Äôs just mad because he wants an extension and bears are undervaluing him. 

If that‚Äôs the case, we ain‚Äôt got the money for his extension."
"Hopkins is big pull. He isn't a rando. Every team should have been on the phone asking about him. 

Peters fell into our lap. The Rams wanted Ramsey. 

Campbell is basically the same. Fire sale on the jags end, why not see what they could get. 

I don't see picking this guy up, when he passed on us before AND we want to build up Hollywood Brown."
He's catch the TD Boykin dropped but ain't he due 15m?
Can he rush the passer?
"I don‚Äôt see it.. He isn‚Äôt a superstar like Earl/Calais/Clooney/Adams/Peters.. He falls into the ‚Äústar‚Äù category. Not worth it when we have a potential superstar out of Hollywood + a ton of young guys who‚Äôs Reps he‚Äôd be eating into. If Snead was to go down then yes I‚Äôm all for it, but he isn‚Äôt really worth what we would have to give up to get him."
Dont need him. I like our WRs..
Stupid ass discussion. We'd sooner trade for an OLB who can edge set than AR12.

lol With defensive grades like that you'd think we were the ones that got blown out...
"Reminder, PFF grades are actively bashed by a lot of the football analytics community, and are extremely subjective. They provide information, but are imperfect in many other ways. For example Lamar last year didn‚Äôt grade out anywhere near where he probably should have. No point complaining, they aren‚Äôt the same thing as performance, just one way to assess play"
PFF off their wax pens
"I'm going to try to add a little bit of context for these. So here we go:

JK Dobbins also had a grade of 73.0

Bradley Bozeman had a pass block grade of 87.2

Matt Skura had a pass block grade of 76

Miles Boykin had a run block grade of 89.6

Defensively:

Malik Harrison had a coverage grade of 85, which is amazing

There were a number of players with tackling grades below 30 including Marcus Peters.

I can't really explain why the grades are so low without really looking deep. If I mentally go back to the game, I remember thinking that the problem with the Browns were the same as least year. Landry was open, but Baker makes the wrong read. Baker throws it to OBJ, but he drops the ball. Baker makes the read and Landry is open, but then he throws off-target. Running game is great, but they're down 20+. Just a bunch of small different miscues that makes the whole thing seem bad. It might just be that the Browns offense performed well overall and made our defense grade poorly, but those small mistakes led to 6 points in results."
LJ FORT IS A GOD
Peters played a good game I thought
I wonder about Malik grade? I thought he played pretty well.
"These grades are seriously pulled out of their ass.

Humphrey allowed 0 TDs and forced 1 PBU/1 INT and a sub 60 Passer rating if I'm not mistaken.

I thought Tyre also played well in the run blocking, I guess they weigh pass protection heavier.


How does a rookie who forced a fumble had a sack and a team high 8 tackles get such a poor grade?? 

There were two plays one a toss and one looked like a wheel route where he didn't get the tackle. Do they weigh that on one person?

I'm surprised they look at our D as poor, by DVOA we were top 5 and look to continue the trend of top 5-10 D.

I'd say our run D prob weighed us down"
"Was on a road trip going to different state's highest points (including MD, I made the state one rock higher), and I managed to avoid any spoilers for Sunday's game. Just watched the condensed version over lunch and hell yeah bois! A few mistakes here and there, but overall looking good! I'm freakin hyped. Also pretty happy to be able to open this subreddit too.

"Even better 

Use his shirt as your canvas"
"I see everyone on this sub praising the defense and taking about how we dominated the brown's, but i haven't seen anyone mention the fact that Hunt average 5.5 YPC and Chubb had 6.0 YPC. Sure defense played a great game, held the brown's to 6 but there were still a lot of big gash runs and it's mildly concerning to me."
"I am not concerned because it is week one.
Week four was pretty pathetic last season.  But we turned out okay.  
In a manner of speaking it is pre season."
"When you jump out to a big lead like that you kind of concede the run and focus on not giving up anything deep. However, there is still work to be done on that front. I'm not worried though. 2 rookie starting ILB's and 3 new guys on the D-line rotation including 2 starters. They'll get it figured out."
"When yards start to translate to points, I'll be concerned. It's a bend, but don't break sort of thing. I mean, we put up 500+ yards of offense against the Titans and only scored 12 points. Points wins games."
"It was a porous run defense, but keep in mind it‚Äôs week 1 and Chubb and Hunt are great backs.  David Johnson had one pretty good game, but I don‚Äôt expect him to be on that level so the worry is lessened."
gotta give queen and harrison a bit of time to acclimate before judging too harshly
Outside runs look to be the problem.  Hopefully they get it corrected.
Queen got held up on blocks frequently.  Has a lot of growing to do but he has special speed.
"Take out each RBs longest carry and shortest and you have -

Chubb - 8 carries for 32 yards (4.0  ypc)

Hunt - 11 carries for 50 yards (4.5 ypc)

Those are much more realistic numbers and show how stout the Ravens rush defense actually was. We are not going to prevent every single big play, and that can skew averages, but look at what we let up on an average play and it is a far better indication of what we did

We only let up 4 runs of 10 yards or more out of 27 attempts, the average carry length before first contact was 2.1. Our run defense was dominant, we just played 2 of the top 10 RBs in the league at the same time"
Hunt was also used out wide  a lot which you really aren't going to stop kareem hunt from being effective out wide unless you create a well disguised blitz from the safetys hes been doing it his whole career. And honestly I'll take that from chubb getting one big 30 yard run all game instead of the 84 yards to the house. This defense is pretty new together with no pre season it's not gonna be 2000 off the rip
"Its somewhat part of the heavy blitzing scheme.  When you have 5 or 6 guys pinning their ears back constantly, you're taking the risk of getting gashed in the run game."
"If the pass D keeps playing the way it has been, I'm fine giving up 5 ypc."
"It's concerning to me too, because it's in large part what caused the loss in the playoffs last year. However, two things to consider: 1) it's week one, so there is time to make improvements and 2) even if the defense plays the way it did last year, it's only going to cause a problem if the offense isn't hitting on all cylinders."
"Its week one is they had two very fast and talented runners. We held them to 6 points. Force a fumble on a rushing attempt. 

I dont know what more you want. They didnt let them run it up our assholes all day. Could have been worse."
I just chalk it up to the first game and the D still putting it together and being rusty. Remember too that Chubb and Hunt are two of the very best RB tandems in the league...
""
"And before anyone shits on PFF, Ken McKusick and Sarah Ellison agree."
Wonder if Fluker moving over to tackle mid game had anything to do with it
"Best left tackle in football went down, guy who plays mostly guard stepped in at tackle, rookie right guard, and another guy coming off a MAJOR knee injury. Oh, we also played a very good dline.

If that was the WORST that they are going to play, and given the circumstances, it very well may be the worst they could play, I will be more than happy with it.

They will get better, and they will be fine."
Cleveland has arguably the best d line in the league though
"I was saying this during the game, the browns D line won as hard as I've ever seen a d line win. They were in the backfield every play and were slowing our potent run offense. All the Ravens had to do was run scramble drills. The browns just couldn't catch Lamar even with penetration every play, and Lamar was finding his receivers on the run. 

People look at Lamar's numbers and go 'wow look what he did from the pocket'. Nah. He did that shit on the run, the whole game. And still posted the highest efficiency of the week. The dude literally transcends the game. There is nothing the browns could have done to stop it. I mean it might be the most ridiculous performance I've ever seen from Lamar individually, because I've never seen him under that much pressure."
"And we still won 38-6! This team is already scary good but still has a lot of room to improve. I believe they will. Don‚Äôt overreact, we didn‚Äôt have a oreseason. Give these guys a few weeks to gel and get better as a unit. The ravens are the team in the nfl with the highest ceiling."
It's going to take time to move on from Yanda.
Looking forward to seeing how they deal with Watt next week
Idk I rewatched the game and did not see glaring oline issues. Shit happens but on big plays Lamar had time to throw and that's how we scored.
"Not too big of a deal imo. The fact that TP is a rookie, Skura literally destroyed his knee 10 months ago, and Fluker was just signed a few months ago gives me hope they‚Äôll improve. Just as long as they don‚Äôt end up on that list by November, everything will be okay."
"Correa making an appearance on that list too. Can‚Äôt believe he found another team and is getting any playing time, time and time again showing how he‚Äôs not a NFL caliber player"
I'm pretty much done with PFF. Not saying that we were great but I'm not sold on their ratings meaning anything anymore.

"I'm not overly worried about the oline yet.  With no preason everyone's like was a little off.  The Browns do have a really good dline as well, and looked to commit to stopping the run.  If in three weeks they still are having issues, than I'm worried."
"I agree with this analysis. I will say, Skura was bound to be rusty, no one is arguing that we don‚Äôt need Ronnie, and Garrett is a top tier player. 

They need to tighten up though, but I still think they can do it."
"Also worth noting in the middle of all this hype is that our run d didn't look that great either. Browns abandoned the run pretty early on, but they made some pretty good runs in the 1st QTR."
"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/itj854/week_1_worst_team_of_the_week_by_pff_grade/

Fluker, Phillips, Skura & Ricard all made PFF's (worst) Team of the Week."
Good thing we have Lamar Jackson hahahahahaha
I mean I said it during training camp and I was downvoted. Brown‚Äôs D-line is quite good tho. We‚Äôll see what happens.
Lamar made OBJ a pro-bowler. Lol
Im not worried. I would expect Fluker to be replacement level at T. Zeus Jr. Struggling with Garrett is to be expected. Im excited that Bozeman played well.
"Reminder that Cleveland put a ton of capital in their offensive and defensive lines. 

Bitonio is an all pro and top 5 LG in this league, Wills is a top ten pick and IMO the rookie with the highest floor; it was difficult to find a game where he was beaten once, Tretter is a solid C who would be an upgrade on 90% of teams and Conklin is a monster Tennessee was dumb to let get away.

On the defensive side Garrett is an absolute game wrecking top three pass rusher in the league, Sheldon Richardson is still a top DT, Vernon isn‚Äôt great but he‚Äôs still dangerous and Larry O is a great rotational DT and better than what most teams have at DT1 let alone 2. 

So it‚Äôs not shocking we lost the battle of the trenches"
"Need to have Phillips and Skura on a short leash now (unless they string together a few good performances). I'm more bullish on the idea of Fluker being an upgrade on Phillips than I am about Mekari being an upgrade on Skura, but if we're struggling to block against Houston, those changes need to be made.

It's tough with Skura, because after one game it's impossible to know if he was just shaking off rust or if the injury has taken something from him permanently (or even just for this season).

Tough to bench a rookie without taking some confidence from him, but if we can't run the ball our offense loses a lot."
"Re-watched Ravens-Browns. I‚Äôm concerned about the o-line.

‚Ä¢ Mad props to Skura for his return, but it was a rough game, including his part of the Ricard fumble.

‚Ä¢ OBJ frequently beat by Garrett. To be fair, it‚Äôs Garrett.

‚Ä¢ Need Stanley healthy

‚Ä¢ Run blocking not great

"Been watching the game before work this week and it looks like the Browns D played to not let Lamar beat them with his legs, which in turn effects the run game. However the run game was still pretty good all things considered.   Our run d looked a little shakey at the start but tightened up as the game went. 

End of the day, we got a week 1 win against a division opponent. Lamar looked very comfortable throwing and even when he was running, always kept his eyes downfield instead of immediately taking off. JK Dobbins making EDC look like the smartest GM in the league. Defense made big plays when it needed to but still had a few dumb penalties. Hoping Staley can stay healthy because he's so damn good and it sucks that he can't stay healthy."
That and it looks like Ingram lost a gear

Baldy loves him some Lamar.  These segments are the next best thing to the actual games.
Still in awe that we get blessed with this young man. Good lord the NFL is in for a rough few seasons.

We need to get Ingram a ring
"Ingram mentoring J.K. ‚Äî his likely replacement‚Äî hits you right in the feels: ‚ÄúTrust your eyes like you have your whole life. Run like you‚Äôve been running all camp. Be J.K., you ain‚Äôt gotta be nobody else. Be J.K. and that gonna be more than enough, I promise you that.‚Äù"
The video title is misleading. Should be ‚ÄúHype beast Ingram Wired‚Äù
"The cutest moment is when Andrews walks up to LJ after his second TD & just gives him a big old hug.

This team is the best"
"Ingram making it his personal mission to yell enough for 70,000 fans."
Inject this team‚Äôs chemistry into my veins
Anyone else tear up at Ingram psyching up Dobbins! Wow that was awesome! Ingram won‚Äôt be as good as he was last year but he is probably the most important part of our team clicking.
You can tell JK just adores mark.. love to see it
Ingram legit the GOAT hype man
Idc if JK takes over RB1. Mark Ingram needs to stay on this team. He‚Äôs the embodiment of everything this team is
"If Ingram isn't running, he's talking."
"Oh man, this is like the old school Wired episodes. Way more player convo's - hope this continues!"
"The ravens production team is absolutely amazing love these videos every game week

Mark Ingram needs a ring so bad I love this team"
"‚ÄúMy son make me proud, man‚Äù"
It is stupid to think we cut Ingram to save 5M.
"""ooh you strong!"""
"Man when Ingram eventually retires he should just hire out his hype services. ‚ÄúYou GOT this. BE YOU. BE YOU. You‚Äôre MORE than enough. Now go KICK this exam‚Äôs ASS‚Äù

After watching this video I want to go do push-ups and yell"
It's wild to think that this is only Ingram's second year on the team. The front office really seems to be good at signing free agents who fit into our organization. Except maybe that one safety...
"This video is the only thing you need to show when asked if we're ok with cutting Earl. This is a team, all included!"
Haha Ingram called him Marlo
Looks like nobody wants to do mic‚Äôd up anymore after the Darnold incident
"If our young guys like LJ, Mandrews, JK, Hollywood, etc... could only have 1 thing between the following list: 
-Basic food and necessities 
-Pure raw football talent
-Amazing work ethic 
-The guidance and support and hype of Big Truss Mark Ingram himself

Well boys...that‚Äôs easy...I‚Äôll take what Ingram is giving them all day! That would be more than enough...Belee dat! That man embodies team play! We are so lucky to have him! 

Also, we are super lucky that our guys just have all of those things on the list! Loving where this team is and is headed! 1-0 every week!"
The conversation between Lamar and Andrews after the first touchdown is gold. Everyone thought it was a bad throw and a great catch. But Lamar couldn‚Äôt see if there was a defender trailing Andrews so he threw it high and leading him. This wasn‚Äôt a bad throw it was a great one!
"If everyone had a hypeman like Mark Ingram, the world would be a better place"
"Last night I was sitting around, with this feeling like something great was coming up, that I‚Äôd been looking forward to. I just had a few mini vacations over the last month (camping and the beach), so I couldn‚Äôt figure out what there could possibly be to look forward to.

"I enjoy Tom Grossi a lot and if you read between the lines of what was said (Lamar Jackson was a major key why we won, run game wasnt needed as much), its yet another person saying that Lamar isnt a ""runner"" and can throw the ball to win.

Also, he has us currently at #2, we all know who #1 is, we have to do work this week and especially do work the week after."

I bet Colin was harder than OBJ in a public bathroom after the performance Baker had on Sunday.
"Colin Cowherd is obnoxious af. I couldn't care less about what he thinks, especially after once upon a time he compared Lamar to Tebow. Idk why people take this guy seriously, he switches up all the time"
Dude sucks. Said he'd still take Darnold over Lamar during his MVP season. He trashed Lamar for the longest time
Colin Cowherd can definitely be a turd at times but I'm lucky that he's a fan of both my teams (The Ravens and USC) so I get to listen to him speak a lot of praise/knowledge of both
"I just got done skimming through different games of Lamar‚Äôs 2018 season. I know people talk about it all the time, but it really is amazing to see how far he‚Äôs come. Just throw on one of those 2018 games and immediately watch our most recent one. Night and day. I always pulling for Lamar in 2018, but I never really imaged he could become what he now is. Everything is so different. His poise, his confidence, his size, his throws, his runs. He really committed himself to becoming the best possible quarterback he could be and he‚Äôs exceeded expectations. I‚Äôve really never seen any player with that kind of determination to getting better. He truly is something special and I hope so badly that he stays in Baltimore for the rest of his career. He represents the city and the organization so well. Gritty, underdog mentality. ‚ÄúNever good enough‚Äù. Let‚Äôs get this ring."
"What I really enjoyed seeing was when he first started, when he would take off he would just tuck the ball and go. But then he evolved to the point where he would tuck the ball, escape, buy as he was escaping into the clear he would pull the ball back out looking to throw. Was just awesome seeing him not going the Vick route and just bolting."
He has that Brady level will to improve.
And he's only 23 years old. My oh my.
"A couple of weeks ago, I rewatched the 2018 game vs the Browns.  It struck me that his handoffs didn‚Äôt look good, like he was telegraphing the handoff.  Compare that to last year when I was always trying to figure out who had the ball, because the handoffs were smooth and the ball was kept hidden as long as possible."
"LJ just has an unreal work ethic. The man just won MVP and all we hear all offseason is about him working out and trying to get his receivers down to FL to get in reps. 


He also seems to be a great student of the game. You can just see his understanding and reading of defenses growing every year. That‚Äôs where all those people saying he wasn‚Äôt smart enough to be a QB screwed up. They looked at his wonderlic and heard him talk and immediately pegged him as stupid. None of them took the time to realize that his football IQ is unbelievable."
He was okay in 2019 too.
"Hopefully for eternity, but just want to know what y‚Äôall think!

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/itprir)"
"If he continues to improve at this rate, he will stay until 2040 and win 9 Super Bowls"
"Though he understands this is his job and it's a business, he honestly gives me vibes to be the type to stay in Baltimore for his full career in gratitude of trading up to give him the opportunity AND building the offense and team around him."
"For the sake of being better than Brady, he will be in Baltimore for 21 years and win a total of 7 Superbowls.

Edit: I am trying to be a little bit more realistic than the comment under me. /s"
"I‚Äôm the one person who hit 2-3 years. Not a troll, just fucked up scrolling on mobile lol

"How bout this, if we aren‚Äôt able to pay some of our star players to keep Lamar, will we find equal/better replacements, or will we have Lamar Jackson and no one else?"

No more pro bowls for Sam Koch
WTF this is incredible. Post it to r/nfl
"Even without rushing TD's? That's fucking insane. I know we disappointed in the playoffs, but for years and years into the future, football fans are going to come back to the rushing record and see this 2019 Ravens team and be in awe."
"I feel like this stat is helped greatly by the Ravens being so aggressive on 4th down. 

I was curious about the number of turnovers on downs, since obviously that isn't counted here. Baltimore had the highest 4th down conversion % last season, and was in a 3-way tie for 5th most 4th down attempts.

Overall baltimore turned over the ball on down just 7 times on 24 tries.

Meaning if you wanted to adjust this stat by subtracting turnovers on downs the Ravens are still VERY positive, and everyone else is VERY negative. KC went 6 for 10, which would put them at -2.

https://www.footballdb.com/stats/teamstat.html?group=O&cat=W&yr=2019&lg=NFL&sort=fourthpct"
"What blew me away is finding out we don't even go for it that much on 4th down either. Apparently we only go it the 10th most often in the NFL, we just have far and away the highest conversion rate.  I had just assumed this was a product of our amazing offense along with how aggressive we are on 4th down but it turns out,  our offense is just insane.

That makes me feel better.
That's pretty reasonable
And he knows Andrews catch radius is gigantic!
tfw your defense is so bad that their most effective play is to literally be so bad that the opposing quarterback thinks it's a trap and plays it extra safe
He has PTSD from not seeing that defender in the pro bowl because of the uniforms

Mark was the one that chased down JK's first touchdown ball after the play to hand it to him because no one else thought to grab it
He doesn‚Äôt seem to be bothered by the reduced role either. He‚Äôs worth every penny of his contract just to be the teams hype man
There are some guys that I wish were a Raven for their whole career. Ingram just fits so well
"He‚Äôs always been a good teammate.  In NO with Kamara, they had a great relationship too.  

He‚Äôs a veteran and has $32mill in career earnings.  Wrong age of 30, at a position with a short shelf life, team drafts your replacement in the 2nd round, and he performs well in camp, so the writing is on the wall, why not have fun with it?"
"Mark knows his worth as a player and a leader so he‚Äôs not insecure. 

idk where we‚Äôd be without him. he brings that energy, love, and camaraderie. no matter what happens to Mark in the future I will always appreciate him. I hope we keep him for as many years as he wants to play, and after that bring him on the coaching staff."
"Ingram may be the most selfless player in the NFL, and he is going to make an amazing coach when his playing days are over. I hope he lands at some mid-tier college and transforms their whole program.

UMBC should start clearing out an office right now."
"This video, Ingram screaming at Mark Andrews to ""make daddy proud"" and Andrews hugging Lamar just give me the feel of such a united and fun locker room"
"I love Ingram, I love Dobbins"
Man the chemistry of this team is off the charts.  God damnit I love it!
I love this team!
"I think it's because he knows his time is coming up to leave the league not next year or the year after. But soon. And he sees this clear stud player and wants him to be great. 

Mark Ingram is essentially taking on the role of mentor. This is his protege. He wants to look back on the career of JK Dobbins and know he played a role in it. Which is awesome. A lot of players dont get that. Like aaron rodgers when he joined. He apparently got a pretty cold shoulder from Farve who was pissed that his replacement was standing on the sidelines when he felt he could still roll for a few years. 

I'm excited for JK. I cannot express how happy I was when we drafted him. I did not expect him to fall to us in the second because hes clear first round talent. Dudes a stud. Gonna be great watching his career. 

I love our locker room culture. They really are a family that act like they love each other. No one is getting jealous if they dont see the ball, they'll to make blocks for the guys that do. That's not common in the nfl. We have a special culture."
I hope he retires a Raven man. I'm a Saints fan too and was too excited when he signed here

"Thank fuck for all the terrible gm‚Äôs and coaches that tanked Lamar‚Äôs value because of where he is from, how he looks, and how he plays football.

You look at what Wilson is doing this year, and I have a hard time believing part of opening up his game wasn‚Äôt due to him watching Lamar and our system, and asking for a change from their run run pass conservative offence. You see it in the Cardinals and Pats offences too, Lamar is just starting his 3rd year and has already sent a ripple through the NFL, and it is probably just the beginning. Never thought we would have another guy like Ray, but Lamar is that guy. This entire fan base has Rally‚Äôd around Lamar, and he is just going to get better and better.

"It amazes me how many scouts clearly did not do their jobs when it came to Lamar.

I used to work for a certain worldwide leader in sports - never anything on-air, just background production stuff - and part of that meant being well-versed enough on all major sports, including college football, to be able to produce a show properly. I started paying really close attention to Lamar during his Heisman season after he singlehandedly ended the dominance of Jimbo Fisher's Seminoles, and after his Heisman season I started watching him with the vested interest of someone who knew their team was probably taking a quarterback in the next year or two.

I can forgive most fans for assuming Lamar would struggle in the NFL. If all you saw was Lamar's stat sheet in games where he passed for 180 and ran for 160, some highlight reels that were dominated by Lamar adding to his ankle collection, and the handful of national broadcast games Louisville had where he was a runner more than a thrower, then I 100% get how that plus some shaky throws at the combine could give you that impression. It's perfectly reasonable - even if it was wrong - for a regular viewer to make that assumption.

What is *not* perfectly reasonable is how many people failed to see beyond that assumption who make six and seven figures to specifically do exactly that. The evidence took some digging to find, but it was absolutely there. The growth from 2016 to 2017 as a passer was substantial, and the mechanical and mental improvement from someone who just won the Heisman and had every excuse to take it easy in the offseason was really impressive to me. 

Not only that, but if you watched full games of Louisville instead of just cut-ups, two things became apparent: 

1. Petrino ran a lot of pro-style concepts, so while there were absolutely options and other gadgets, the notion Lamar was illiterate when it came to how NFL offenses worked was laughable.

2. A lot of those runs weren't because Lamar can't throw, they were because the team around him was bad(The only other player from that offense currently starting in the NFL is Geron Christian, LT for the Washington Footballs.), his opponents were very good(The Clemson defenses he played had AJ Terrell, Isaiah Simmons, Dexter Lawrence, Clelin Ferrell, Shaq Lawson, and Christian Wilkins, and those are just the first-rounders. If we expand to ""Starting somewhere in the NFL"" you get about half the team.), and this result of bad team vs. good team meant he didn't have any other options so he had to make magic happen himself. On a lot of those scrambles, he spends a lot of time looking for someone to get open before taking off and running. He didn't run because he was unable to throw, he ran because his targets were unable to get open/his blockers couldn't hold up against an entire NFL first round rushing the passer.

Both of those fly in the face of all the cliches you heard about Lamar coming out of college, and if I could see that as a producer for a sports show, there's no excuse for professional scouts and GMs not to be able to see it when seeing it is their entire job.

That's not to say that Lamar was perfect coming out of college. If he were, then even as much badmouthing from agents as he got wouldn't have pushed him out of the top ten, and we wouldn't have had to turn into Navy's offense in 2018. He was absolutely a work-in-progress as a rookie, and any team that drafted him to start day one would've been asking for failure. It's also not to say that anyone could predict him turning MVP in year two, even as high as I was on him I thought it'd be at least four years before he was anywhere near this level. 

But it is to say that the evidence was there that being an average, startable passer was well within his ability, and the upside from his physical gifts to add onto that meant the sky was the limit on his potential. The fact that so few coaches and GMs managed to see that tells me that either they didn't bother to watch the full game film, or they did and didn't bother to analyze it beyond the surface, which is damning.

***tl;dr*** Lamar was a puzzle that required some work to figure out, but if you put the time in - which you really should do when it is literally your job to do so - then it was clear he was capable of being an NFL QB, and the fact no other team saw that is a damning indictment of 31 other scouting departments that for one reason or another saw a WR when they put on his tape. I remember how loud Simms was about Lamar being a stud that year, shoutout to him for being one of the few people who took the time to figure out that puzzle.

Agents really convinced owners and GMs out potentially keeping their jobs. WoooOOoOOoww. I'm so upset for Lamar. Calls into question all of the players drafted. If you don't have a top agent, you don't have the connections to a top spot."

"I've noticed that Browns fans are by far the worst towards Lamar. Notice how not even Steelers fans talk that much trash about him.

I even noticed this last game how damn good he is at screens now, which wasn't the case in Louisville.

 Dude works his tail off and Baltimore has created an environment for all his talents to be fully realized. I hate so many people skipped on him, but I'm damn happy for his career to be on such a supportive team. It makes his hard work shine even brighter."

""Its like a shitty version of Groundhog Day. The Browns sputter out right before halftime. Give Lamar a small amount of time...and of course he scores six with seconds left. 

How the heck has Lamar Jackson become a better pocket passer than Baker Mayfield in the same time frame? I was really stoked two years ago, idiotically believing that long term, the Browns were the only team in the division with a quality QB for future. Pittsburgh has an obese, ageing rapist. The Bengals...LOL. The Ravens...why they got a kid who is going to get his legs snapped the first year and can only run. This has to be the Browns decade! 

Somehow Lamar keeps expanding his game whereas Mayfield...well he certainly does a lot of commercials. I hope he is investing his commercial money as I don't think Mayfield has a future in the NFL as a QB.

How is it that the Ravens can find TE's that can make better catches than OBJ? I don't even want to look up what they cost combined compared to OBJ's contract as I think I will have a stroke out of anger. Have the Ravens ever had a shitty kicker? Billy Cundiff? God I would give my first born to have a kicker of the quality of Billy Cundiff. 

Its like the organizations are polar opposites. HOW DOES CLEVELAND DO THIS EVERY YEAR?!?!

I didn't expect them to win. I expected them to compete and for once show improvement. I just WANT IMPROVEMENT!!!

GOD I HATE THIS TEAM!

Go Browns. I will see you all on Thursday."""
"Oh man that was good 

I need a cigarette now."
Its more fun to respect competition then blindly hate. Ravens vs Chiefs is shaping up to be the Raven-Patriot rivalry of this decade.

I wonder why? Also the ravens aren‚Äôt doing him any favors by dropping him in coverage. He literally went into coverage more than they let him rush the passer. People hate on him a lot but he can‚Äôt get sacks if they don‚Äôt let him get after it. And he‚Äôs on a tag and won‚Äôt be able to put up any film. Sucks for Judon.
Maybe he wants to focus on football and not garbage twitter followers/comments? IG is probably good enough for posting and communicating
"[Yup.](https://www.reddit.com/r/ravens/comments/ihme7f/did_judon_delete_twitter/)

I think he's changing his image, now that he has a kid."
Social Media is an abyss.
"Deleting your twitter account has nothing to do with football. I deleted mine a few months ago too. However you‚Äôre right about how much he drops into coverage, doesn‚Äôt really help him show his worth as a pass rusher. He‚Äôs a damn good all around linebacker though"
People underestimate how valuable he is. Last year our defense was paper thin and *Judon was literally the only pass rusher.* Which meant he was easy to schematically take right out of the equation and he still put up some numbers.
"Probably because of how toxic social media has become, most of the ravens have made their IG accounts private permission for comments and no story replys"

"It was interesting to see that according to Mike Sando's QB Tier list, NFL coaches and executives still rate Watson over Jackson. 

It seems like Watson's issues get excused by his sub-par coaching and team, while Jackson's accomplishments get excused by good coaching and his athletic talents. 

For the record, I like Watson but Lamar is clearly ahead of him."
I think he‚Äôs good but not great. I also think he has boneheads for coaches and a FO that isn‚Äôt doing him any favors by trading away one of the best WRs in the NFL in his prime for an injury prone RB who has seen his best years behind him
We still haven't seen what Watson does in a season without Hopkins who is probably the best WR in the league. I think he is being overrated by many and you need to consider his lone playoff win to be a fluke since Josh Allen basically gifted them the game. But of course the agenda will be Bill O'Brien is the one holding him back when he will play bad.
"I think Watson is limited by his team and coaching. Not as good as Lamar and Mahomes, but I bet if he's in Reid's offense he would be in the same tier."
"I dont think its unpopular here, and maybe mixed with other subs. He's a good QB, dont get me wrong, but I agree, I wouldnt put him anywhere near Mahomes, Wilson, or Jackson. 

I think this year without Hopkins will really tell how good he really is."
"I agree, it doesn‚Äôt make a lot of sense to me. He is clearly talented, but he hasn‚Äôt been able to put it together on a consistent basis the way the others in the group you listed have. I don‚Äôt understand the love and money he has gotten."
tbf to him I think he was totally unprotected behind that line last year. Plus his HC is awful.
"Ive been a fan of watson since he was at clemson and believe he could be maybe just below lamar and mahomes if he was in a different situation. Lamar and mahomes have taken their teams to a new level and deshaun hasnt, but he does have by far and fucking away the worst coach and front office of the 3"
"I think he‚Äôs good, but not great. He could‚Äôve been much better by now if he had a better coaching and weapons around him. He probably could‚Äôve been as hot as Lamar in a system that‚Äôs more designed around him, but I‚Äôm not sure Houston has the brain trust to figure that out."
"I think it‚Äôs about to become more and more popular. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as good and he‚Äôs always had stacked talent, now his boy Hopkins is gone"
Watson does deserve to be in that group
"I dont think hes put into those conversations because of talent. 

I think hes there (for the most part) because along with Lamar and Patty hes part of the next generation of QBs.

Drew Brees to their Brady v Manning if you will. not the best example but I do think he'll have some success"
"Absolutely disagree. Watson is amazing. The Texans have allowed so many QB hits and Sacks in the past 3+ years, I think even the best of QBs would struggle behind it"
"This isn't unpopular I don't think.

What's unpopular is taking it a step further and saying that he doesn't even belong in that next tier and without Hopkins he doesn't really offer much than slightly above average play.

Obviously thats yet to be proven but it's been my thought since his rookie year. He has gotten bailed out on so many bad throws by Hopkins. Until I see him do it without Hopkins I can't in good conscience rank him above or in line with the likes of Rodgers, Brees, Brady, Tannehill, Dak, or whoever else you may put on that next tier down after the top 3."
I like Watson and think he is a great QB on that level. Very talented and often creates something from nothing. Hard to succeed with a bad o-line and BoB. Even with those obstacles they should've beat KC last year in the playoffs. Completely choked that game away. I feel bad for him if anything. How do you give Hopkins away for peanuts and then spend that money on cooks and Johnson. Just abysmal FO decisions
I blame it on BoB
Yes it's unpopular because it's wrong and a dumb opinion.
"He reminds me a lot of early-career Andrew Luck. People would act like he's the new face of the league, but he's only better-than-average.

Watson has a ton of potential, but potential doesn't make you elite."

i‚Äôm too used to ravens past. i was waiting for a loss every game of the 12 game win streak
Nah this team is driven they aren‚Äôt gonna be listening to any talking heads on TV
"Yes, but I'm superstitious and weak."
"I‚Äôm still nervous for every game, tbh. The anxiety keeps me humble üôÉ"
"Nah I think I'm done being nervous in the regular season. We finally have a team capable of carrying the load on both sides (if the defense sucks Lamar can easily hang 30+ on this team, if the offense is stalling I can see the defense containing Watson).

The annoying part is we could win this game 27-17 and analysts would start asking 'Are the Ravens starting to slip' lol."
"No. In the short run, any NFL team is dangerous, the games are notoriously flukey, and everything could come together either against us or for us. But in the long run the Ravens are a championship-quality team."
"It's always good to be a little nervous about teams like the Texans. Teams that aren't flat out bad, and that have the capability to surprise you. Like, they have talent, and that talent can show up for any given game, but the coaches can't make it gel from week to week.

That being said, I think our D is gonna feast on that O-line."
Could be a close game or could be a shutout.
Some analysts are predicting this to be close. Stephen A and Mike Vick even called for the Texans to win
I‚Äôm always nervous. No matter how good we looked last week I have ptsd from the boller days and Flacco‚Äôs inconsistency days.
Hell no im predicting that too cuz its happening
Nope
"10-7, both lines lookn suspect for the Ravens so far."
"I‚Äôm nervous because ofc I want this team to win, but I also don‚Äôt want Watson and Watt to start off 0-2. Deshaun is amazing, I just don‚Äôt know why he had to face two of the best teams in the league in back to back weeks. 

I just want a close game, regardless who wins"

"Jim Rome said that Kyler Murray is a more explosive runner than Lamar....


People are crazy üòÇ"
"Kyler is a great runner. Should probably run more often. But the stratosphere that Lamar is in running the ball is different. Kyler is lightning. Lamar is a fucking nuke running the ball. Just fucks everything up. Your eyes, ankles, soul, etc"
I didnt know jim rome was still alive üòÇüòÇ
It‚Äôs Jim Rome. Dudes a clown
what the hell is wrong with people
"Well, his runs are more explosive but thats because his runs are almost exclusively scrambles. These will inherently be bigger than designed runs. 

HOWEVER, Lamar is still more explosive. But I can see why someone would say that about Murray's running."
"Now Lamar isn‚Äôt running enough, you say?"
"He just seems more explosive because he has shorter legs and therefore sorter strides. Makes him look SUPER fast! 

Lamar with his longer strides just looks like he's almost coasting as he's running (IE look at Randy Moss)"
"This season sure. Overall, no way in hell. Lamar hasn‚Äôt really gotten it going yet on the ground. But I think that‚Äôs mostly by design. Teams are terrified of him gashing them for big gains so it‚Äôs been a huge part of their game plan. But this offseason he focused on getting better at passing so he doesn‚Äôt always have to do that and so far it‚Äôs paying off."
I guess by some measures he arguably might be. I feel like he can hit zero to sixty in a straight line a little quicker maybe. But he‚Äôs nowhere near as elusive and doesn‚Äôt have the same change of direction as Lamar does.
"Maybe, but Lamar‚Äôs vision and elusiveness is the best a qb‚Äôs EVER had."
even if true it only means they are both explosive af
"Everyone just flocks to the new shiny thing. üôÑ

They‚Äôre both awesome, but Murray isn‚Äôt the open field runner that Lamar is."
If you compared him to last year Lamar than you're absolutely right. Something about this year tho (granted only 2 games) where he just hasn't been running at the same level as last year.
Rome is a very excitable dude.
"Explosive runner? Lamar wins.

Explosive offense? Sorry guys, but Kyler has insane receiving weapons and a pretty good RB too."
"Seems like the lack of pre-season games/contact may be catching up to some teams with the insane amount of injuries today. Hope everyone on both teams, both sides of the ball can come out of today‚Äôs game fully healthy."
"Don‚Äôt go on r/NFL today y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs looking like an obituary page in a newspaper"

I think we downplayed the loss of Yanda
The O-line is booboo tiddy fuck today
PIT/KC going to feast on our Oline if we don‚Äôt get it worked out.
Brown is straight up getting over powered at the LOS. He gets knocked back 2-3 yards instantly.
Yall acting like OBJ is not playing against JJ fucking Watt
Averett looking like Chykie Brown
LJ jumped on the pileüòÇ
[deleted]
8 minute drive needed here
"What‚Äôs it like to root for a good team? 

-sad nyj fan"
YES. The truss is STILL enormous.
At first i thought it was lamar that took it then i was like why is he not running way faster lmao
Big Trusssssssss
THATS MY RUNNINGBACK
MI2 going fucking mauy thai on the logo is the funniest shit I have seen today lmao
Earl who?
I love this team.
I just want a Lamar bomb to the endzone and im good
CBS show some god damn replays. What the fuck?
Grumpy Lamar gonna stunt next week
Tuck is definately happy today
Shoutout to Jimmy smith for not hearing his name at all today
I don‚Äôt deserve this. What did I do in my life to deserve being this happy every Sunday?
JK has such a bright future
I like Dobbins. I just think he's neat üôÇ
DOBBINS IS FUCKING LEGIT
"That Dobbins run is gonna make it look like we curbstomped the Texans with the run game today when that's not exactly the story, lol."
Its funny to see players on the other team surrounding lamar after the game. They are such big fans of him üòÇ
Man fuck all these injuries today. Wtf.
slay kweeeeeen slayyyyyyyy
"Tough time for his first bad throw, I think he had the TD"
The sound of the ball being kicked in an empty stadium is so satisfying
lamar has to take the space and get the easy first down. I know going for TDs is nice but on 3rd you gotta secure the first
3 man rush lamar should have scrambled that time
Marlon the most underrated defensive player In the game. No one even acknowledges it
It looks like LJ got in
Marlo and punching the ball out. Name a more iconic duo
"[Marlon's new sponsorship deal](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/819OuxQ09ZL._SX425_PIbundle-4,TopRight,0,0_AA425SH20_.jpg)"
Not the LJ who I thought would score today but I‚Äôll take it
"Fort isn't a HOFer. And he may not be on the Ravens all that long, but fuck if he's not a great story and an awesome pickup. Love that guy."
LJ + LJ = SB LV
"Somewhere, Ed Reed is smiling"
"Yeah, Marlo and Marcus are going All-Pro again."
I love MP JUICEMAN
"Marshall yanda if you‚Äôre listening, if Jesus can come back from the dead you can come back to play in the NFL. Marshall pls"
Refs are babying Texans
Holy fuck they're really trying to get Houston back in this game.
"Move Marlo into the slot, Jimmy & Peters to the outside? 3 best corners on the field like last year. Don‚Äôt want to see Averett out there."
Late to the party but wtf was that illegal contact call? Why didn‚Äôt the refs just give them 3pts
I don‚Äôt like how Much Lamar is getting hit in the pocket so far this season. PROTECT THE FRANCHISE
"Honestly thank god for the LJ fort TD...otherwise this would be an uncomfortable 13-10 lead.

We get the ball at the start of the half. Keep up the faith, Flock."
Harbaugh: mask tastes good üòÇ
Thank God for Tucker... where would we be without him?
averett stinks but that was a hell of a throw by deshaun
Get averetts trash ass off the field fuck
"Trade or sign another CB, Averrett cannot play"
Bench Averett play Jimmy
"Offense needs to turn it up a bit. Defense is going to be a little gassed, long drive."
"[Jesus Christ, I had no idea Fairbairn was this good. ](https://i.imgur.com/rpMyI2y.jpg)"
I was wondering why Lamar looked so slow until I saw the 2-1 on the jersey
[deleted]
Ingram: HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
"We all feeling a little anxious with the game, acting like 30pts aint our base lineüòéüòéüòé"
Stanley isn't known as a run blocker but holy crap was that great
Where are all the 'GreG RomAn is TrYing to Be tOo cUtE' comments?
# BIG TRUSS NO LITTLE TRUSS
Why is Ingram always physically abusive to opposing teams' logos lmao
BIG RB. NO LIL RB.
Team looks inconsistent asf and we still drop 38 & 30 SCARY
"Mahomes is 13/28. 

wat"
I sprinkled the old bay on my natty right before that drive. Good luck charm? I think so.
Tavon Young‚Äôs injury is gonna be a hit to the secondary üò≠
Love that Harbs trusts Lamar.
I‚Äôm a little disappointed with how little we‚Äôve run Ingram tbh.
"SHOW THE REPLAY OF THE DQ

why is the broadcast so bad about showing replays today"
When‚Äôs the last time Tucker kicked 4+ FGs
Really puts into perspective how fucking incredible our team is that I somehow feel disappointed with today‚Äôs game ü§£
DOBBINS! only if you could broke that off for a td. ü§£ü§£
DOBBY IS FREE
Pick your poison of which RB you want to fuck you up
Wannabe Lamar runs to get wannabe Tucker in position for chipshot field goal
Wonder how some of you fairweathers would've handled the Flacco regime lmao
why do i even come to this thread when we're not winning by 40.
"The ravens didn't finish with 200 yards rushing


>!JK YOU FRICKEN MORON!<"
Important to remember we are probably the best Offense in the league. Every team is going to bring their best effort each week. Lamar making good decisions today. o line needs to give him more time.
"Don't forget to switch to incognito browser, guys, we about to watch a whole team get fucked by a beautiful black man"
Useless Broncos
I still don't understand how Ricard missed that block on 2nd down
That jet sweep with hollywood went so bad lol
Fuck these indoor stadiums with concrete floors
"We‚Äôre only 13 minutes (real clock, not game clock) into the game, and my anxiety is already sky high"
This play calling is weird as fuck
What is going on right now? Is the offense not in sync this game??
"OK, all these designed Lamar runs... Why?"
It's points I'll take it
Remember last year guys it was 0-0 against the Texans late into the 2nd quarter. We then won 41-7 üò¨
i miss yanda
I‚Äôll take that instead of Watson getting sacked and then starting our drive in our own half
EARL WHO?!?!?
THICC RICC
Heh. My wife just called the last 2 plays.  I married a winner.
No crowd noise being pumped in? Pretty sure I hear crowd noise...
Gonna be a close game but we got this
I swear Hollywood looks like a kid playing with adults üòÇ
We‚Äôre playing okay. Just a few miscues here and there. No worries
That's a fucking touchdown
Marlon Humphrey is literally ‚ÄúOne Punch Man‚Äù hahaha
that's a fucking touchdown
Dude LJ Fort. I don‚Äôt know how he‚Äôs so good but he is.
"Thanks for cutting LJ Pittsburgh!!

Edit: Trading"
robbed the rams
"That's Mr. MPJuiceman, sir"
I LOVE RAVENS FOOTBALL
Peter's is an insane ball hawk.
The O Line is worrisome.
These fucking refs hahaha
Cobb was being a fucking bitch
"they just fucking gifted the Texans a field goal to keep them in the game, what fucking bullshit"
Trash refereeing
"On some drives we look Elite, other drives we look lost lol"
Bills beat the dolphins by 3 and now Allen is leading the MVP race? Bills fans are so special.
"RBs need to be involved in the offense second half, Texans gonna keep getting to Lamar if the playcalling revolves around Lamar dropping back on 90% of snaps. Way too predictable."
"I know we are up two scores, but it doesnt feel like.  Offense is off sync and defense is struggling to stop Watson.  Not to mention the refs helped with two bs calls at the end"
What the fuck is an illegal double team block?
"Hello, OLine?  Can you please show up?"
Peters almost stripped the ball
Fire Averett into the goddamn sun
Not having Tavon in there is a liability. Hope he‚Äôs alright!
Harbaugh looks pissed
Week 2 ppl calm down
TRADE #93 HE SUCKS SO BAD s/
Somehow held them to a FG. You want to see frustrating? Block the kick
[deleted]
ROUNDHOUSE KICK THE LOGO
ROUNDHOUSE
What a fucking play
When in doubt TRUZZZZZZZ
No little boi
HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
##WILDCAT ON 4TH AND 1 TD
"We want the chiefs 

We want the chiefs"
That Brian Billick offensive genius finally coming to fruition. I knew he had it in him.
[Mark Ingram becoming Chuck Norris](https://twitter.com/RealPavetexRob/status/1307813273589481475)
Calais Campbell probably reminds offensive players of when they first saw California redwood trees. #shallnotpass
Fairbairn ain‚Äôt half bad
Horrible spot! WTF
Andrews held that block and that was a TD
"Sad news to report. Patriots' RB James White's father was in a car crash today and did not survive. His mother was also in the car and is in critical condition.

White's father, Tyrone, was a captain with the Miami-Dade Police Department.

James was told and is inactive tonight. - @AndySlater"
Fuck the Titans
I wanted Mandrews TD but I guess
bruh Dobbins is fucking unreal
Fucking Chargers choked
We have so many weapons its hard to involve them all. Miles Boykins looks really good so far
Just because we haven't scored 2 tds yet doesn't mean the sky is falling. This will be a close game.
"If we blow out the Texans it'll be because they're bad, yet if the steelers go 2-0 it's all about how they're back. Just like the Browns when beating up the bengals"
This poor guy is so injury prone üòï
tavon and injuries is an iconic duo i do not enjoy
I remember when we had Mark Ingram.  Those were the days.
Roman trying too hard
Patrick Queen is everywhere! Wow! The dude is so fast
Jihad Ward has 20-20 foresight
I love y'all but these comments have me SERIOUSLY questioning y'all's knowledge of the game.
Imagine not converting on 4th and 1 in your own territory and the opposing team scores a touchdown
I feel like Boyle has been stopped inside the 5 like 4-5 times now in his career.
Ofc the best Heisman house commercial is the one with Lamar in it
Lmfao these dudes can‚Äôt get set and a play off in time with NO CROWD NOISE. Texans are bums lol
Gotta start sacking this dude
Justin ‚ÄúHands‚Äù Tucker
Hey guys FGs give us points too. Some of the people in here are wayy too spoiled
Someone here just called for a Marlon type of play.  Good job honey.
One punch man Marlo
Marlon is so good at punching the ball out
Humphrey was destined to be a Raven.
Marlon Humphrey is like the one punch man of the NFL
Man LJ has been a beast for us
That‚Äôs a fucking TD
"Baller ass play, so lucky to scoop Fort"
LJ Fort is a damn good player he was only a journeyman because the rest of the league didn‚Äôt know how to use him .
Get Marlon the Brinks truck!
Man if we had a pass rush we‚Äôd be nastyyyyy
I audibly yelled holy shit
Even Peters looked surprised that he got that as he got up lol
Petition to change Marcus Peters nick name to MP grape juice man
HAHA why is MP wearing a winter hat in Texas in September. Love that guy.
So the wide receiver can just barrel into the corner and get an illegal contact?
FUCK OFF REFS
"every time i hear number 23, i forget who the fuck it is

then remember why i dont remember every time

averett is just erased from my mind"
These refs are actually so trash
Why is Averett on the field when Jimmy Smith exists and Brandon Carr is a FA
What the fuck is that?
These refs are actually missing chromosomes
What a gift of 3 points. Man.
"That was some bullshit, bullshit calls meant to give the Texans come points smfh. I hope we come back out and destroy them üòà"
"Grade A bullshit, ref. Texans should thank them for the 3 points"
Everything about that drive was horseshit officiating
"https://twitter.com/TorreySmithWR/status/1307799585994223617
lol Torrey vs. Pollard"
JK with the Ray Rice type crawl.
Offensive line is getting exploited today. Not good moving forward.
Damn our O-line blows today...
Phillips is gonna lose starting position I bet. Dude is not great.
"That kick was reminiscent of the game winner in the playoffs against Denver. Same distance and looked the same.

Also how the fuck was that not Pi on Andrews?"
O-Line looking shaky but we‚Äôll bounce back
O line looks atrocious today
"We have arguably the best offensive tackle duo in the league, but the interior O-line is looking like a big liability. That just can't stay the case moving forward."
Too many FGs today.  Roman has to get away from drop back pass plays down field and run some quick slants draws or SOMETHING to slow the rush because our O line cant
Should be 27 - 7 SMH
Clay Matthews is at home watching our abysmal pass rush
Russ Wilson looking like Lando Calrizzian. üòÇ
My name's Anthony Averett and I use cable
Get Averrett off the field.
Averet giving Chykie Brown flashbacks
Shocker. Averett getting bitched as usual
"It feels like we're playing so bad, but we're still up 13 with 1 quarter left. I am becoming very conscious of how spoiled we are"
"If they get this its still a 10 point game, just need to pound the rock"
I love the home crowd boos when there‚Äôs no home crowd
A long scoring drive would do a lot for us right now boys. And the great llama still need to tack atleast 2 tds to his stat sheet.
"Bill Polian finally got his wish, Lamar lined up at WR"
BIG NUTZ HARBZ
BIG BOY NO LITTLE BOY
Tucker got a lot of fantasy points this game too
"TOOOOOOUCHDOWNNNNN RAAAAAAVENNNSSSS

AND A BEATING ON THE TEXANS LOGO

TRUSS"
This is why we will always be that team to go for 4th down
Chiefs are looking very soft and very beatable today. Love to see it
How did Fort miss that sack
"It's crazy that this is an ""off day"" for the team"
If KC loses to Herbert's first start
I think that's a good challenge. Lamar might have gotten it.
Aaaaaand unclench.
Was against the decision but I can‚Äôt be mad with the outcome
"I'm calling it, defense with a garbage time INT."
This game was just so we could get JT some reps
Dobbins is gonna be a superstar
Yo Dobbins is wild for real
JK but he ain't Joking
"Love watching Dobbins. Speed to get to the edge, tough enough to bang through the center, and good contact balance to break tackles. The future is bright"
man it‚Äôll feel like an eternity until next monday
"So, they just forgot about Tucker? ‚ÄúButker best in the league‚Äù"
I'm going to run that play on my wife tonight.
I much prefer when the Ravens reach the end zone instead of the texans. Perhaps the Ravens should do that more?
"The Ravens are playing very well for my birthday today. Just a few observations:

- I'm liking a lot of Jackson's decision-making. A couple high throws (esp the throw on the dig route that was caught by the jumping WR), but overall he's been good.

- Averett is not a starting DB. He's committed a couple dumb penalties and left his assignment open a couple times.

- I like the DL pressure on Watson. Still stunned he got away from a sack.

A solid 7/10 performance.

The illegal contact calls were pretty ticky-tacky calls. I saw a little bit of contact on the one replay that they showed on the first call, but I would've not called either."
"""how are we beating kc next week"" as if they aren't struggling against the chargers right now. 

they're obviously the team to beat and will be tough to beat, but some of you need to chill."
How is this trash o line going to stand up to KC next week?
Wtf is this play calling rn...
Wish we would run it more...
Decent drive sucks we didn‚Äôt come out with 6 but miles better than our first drive.
Patrick Queen is everywhere and I fucking love it
Wish that ATT girl was my friend and nothing else.
HOW DID HE GET UP SO FAST LMAO
Way to make up for last weeks fumble Ricky
Lamar's about to bring me back from 40 points down in fantasy
###GOT UP LIKE A MAN POSSESSED
Lol. My boy Ricard ain't letting that ball go for anything.
That cat commercial was terribly awesome.
"We need to trade for a real pass rusher tbh

An edge"
The only time we get anything remotely close to a good pass rush is when we scheme up a blitz that gets a us a free runner to the QB. We don‚Äôt have anyone that can beat their blocker.
Annoying. Hope the defense can clean up a bit like last week too. Watson's obviously better than Mayfield though
Watson is good guys we are not playing against Baker
Bless u Tucker
We fine y‚Äôall. Even when the offense looks out of sync we‚Äôre gaining yards and getting first downs.
Fruit Punch.. is back!
He totally scored there!!!
Marlo has mastered the peanut punch
fuck kiko alonso!!
We ask for turnover we receive. We ask for TD we receive I love the Llama era
LJ Fort.....most under-rated Ravens FA signing ever?
"Defense is nasty, I just wish we had more of a passrush."
"LJ Fort is the Ravens defensive MVP so far this year, who would've thought"
Quick reminder that LJ Fort WASNT EVEN ON A TEAM this time last year. DeCosta has a knack for finding talent where no one else does
Chiefs are losing. I just wanna see that team become human.
lj fort consistently proves to me why he deserves to be my new favorite linebacker.
I like that from Harrison.
MP JUICEMAN HE GOT THAT JU ICE IN HIM
Fruit punch straight to the juice man! 2020 no fly zone baby!!!
Bro this defense is nasty
Holy fuck that was beeeeeautiful
I would pay to have a live stream of Marcus Peters mic‚Äôd up
"It‚Äôs just the Browns, right?"
WHAT A CATCH!!!
jesus h christ i love this goddamn football team
That pick might have been the best catch so far this game
"Man... that INT was incredible. All hands, full extension & against the grain while going to the ground?"
Give me MP juiceman over Ramsey every day of the week and twice on Sundays
"okay justice hill in a commercial lol, random."
What an interception...  holy hell. MP Juiceman
get ronnie out.
How long would it take Marshal to put on 100 lbs?
This game is a good example of badly we miss Yanda. Not only his blocking ability but his line calls as well.
Good guy Marcus Peters lmaoo
Pussy ass call
"Our pass rush sucks, but to make it worse, they can‚Äôt tackle whatsoever. We miss 90% of our chances at sacks which are already rare."
Sorry but these are just some bad calls. Not too upset with our D this drive.
WTF just happened?
What the hell is happening
These fucking refs. Wow
How much BoB paying these reff to keep his job
That‚Äôs such bullshit
"What the fuckkkk, these refs üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
Still up by 10 AND we get the ball to start the 2nd half
"The ravens are going to have to dial up some quick hitters. The texans are sitting deep like they did against the chiefs. 

Lamar gotta look for his checkdown. 3 sacks at the half against this defense is keeping the game from being a blowout."
Is it part of the (defense exhausted = fresh Dobbins in) gameplan or why on earth isn't JK getting any carries?
Man I‚Äôm so happy to have Ray rice back
"How was that not dpi, mckinney never gets his head around"
Where‚Äôs our illegal contact call?
Its like we're fucking shocked they blitz everyone on 3rd downs. They've been doing it all day.
Can Greg Roman realize they're blitzing those situations and get some designed out of pocket throws?
Maybe we can finally get some pressure
"Averett did something!

Edit: Nvm"
"Averette giveth, Averette taketh."
Why the fuck do we have Avrett covering cooks? üòë
Someone has to gif Queen jumping on the pile
Queen looking extra and I like it!
"Me: How are we going to beat the Chiefs with this o-line and without Tavon

Also Me: -looks down and sees that Chargers are up on KC 17-6-"
"JJ Watt, again, is good at this football thing."
Ingram really just spin kicked that wall lmao
I can‚Äôt believe that worked LMFAOOOOO
LOL thought that was Lamar
NO LITTLE BOY
NASTY
This game has felt like just a fucking grinding slogfest. Can't believe we are up by as much as we are. That fumble return was huge
Did Ingram just karate kick the Texans logo?! Merciless.
OMG that play design was so fucking good too. Roman showing off.
"what blocking on that play, I will want to know what lamar did out there tbh"
The Force is with us.
"That TD took Watson soul, you could see it as soon as he seen the TD"
Lamar and Hollywood on the bench there is so fun to see.
Why did they kick?
time to run that clock out
Now that I feel comfortable that we will win I will give props to Justin Reid. He has been very strong for the texans in these first two games.
He definitely got it
The Gus Bus is in full service!
What did Blacklock do
Hey guys pro tip: stop going out of bounds
No idea why Gus and Ingram didn't just fall down in bounds.
Can‚Äôt wait for Ravens wired this week just to hear Ingram after the 4th down TD
Dobbins isn't human
"That was a stumble away from a touchdown

Dobbins' future is so bright man I am pumped"
I can‚Äôt tell if the Texans totally don‚Äôt give a shit anymore or that was a truly phenomenal run.
JK ain't kidding
Guys guys guys WE ARE SO LUCKY. What a team we have üò≠
"Good win. Tavon Young injury sucks, but given what a bloodbath this sunday was I think we got off light."
"About Tavon Young:

>By video, worry for ACL injury. His day is done and maybe season. Too many of those today. 1 is too many. - @ProFootballDoc"
Sometimes I wish Lamar would run
I am scared for next week
We miss Yanda
"Everyone is downplaying how good Watson is. Dude is a great QB, he is gonna make some good plays against any defense"
"Go Ravens, fuck Pittsburgh!"
"Back up QB gives Steelers trouble

Steelers Fans : ‚ÄúBen is back!!!‚Äù

How are people picking this team to win our division?"
"""NFL contractual obligations"".....  Let's GO RAVENS!."
Tavon exhibiting his all-glass body again
The fact he was able to walk is a good sign
Who‚Äôs Elizabeth? Patrick is the only Queen I know
This sub was moaning 90 seconds ago.  We're spoiled.
"Lamar is doing everything, the team need to WAKE UP!!!!"
Lamar almost made that work. Insane.
Something seems off
I kinda forgot what a fourth down felt like
Solid drive
"Gotta use these RB's more

Lamar can do it himself but he doesn't have to"
Still fucking got it
"Henry Cavill's like 40 and MBB is like 16, who TF did the casting for this movie? The age gap is absurd for siblings"
so that's how that feels....
Well its a good thing Watson didnt get sacked now
that's my QUUUUEEEEENNNNN
Patrick Queen ROTY no doubtttt!
Houston decided the Cleveland fake punt worked so well last week they thought they'd try their own dumb play in their own zone.
LMAOOOOOO
"Now, run the ball please."
Poor Nick. He almost gets there every time. Then somebody else scores the TD
Good to see Ricard getting involved
I was watching Ravens higlights from 2018 and Nick Boyle was one of the like 3 main players who are still on the roster
Ricard making it up for last week!
James Harrison fan duel commercial. Greatest thing I‚Äôve seen all day
There is no fullback in the game that didn't start off in baltimore that would have made that catch
Imagine getting scored on by a defensive tackle
Damn guys this the season with the worst injury bug to the league. Half the niners are injured and Saquan Barkley had to be carried out the game with a knee injury. Damn I really like Barkley and his season might be over in week fucking 2
Any updates on Tavon?
Pass rush is fucking ass wtf
Pass rush needs an upgrade asap
Texans run a pretty similar offense to ours
That's ok.  Will get it back
Everybody calm down. Our shoutouts are fun but these dog fights make the game so much more exciting
Texans are playing a lot more physical imo
They always try to jinx Tucker smh
Let's have a stop here
Y‚Äôall. Chill out. We‚Äôre winning. It‚Äôs early. R-E-L-A-X
Humphreys right hook is legendary
Challenge?? That's a TD!
FRUIT PAWNCH!!!
It kinda looked like he scored there
my fantasy team would really love this to be a TD.  Thanks Tony!
I do not see how Fort was down
They‚Äôre going to rule that a TD
I don‚Äôt see where he went out of bounds
Lmao give LJ fort some offensive carries!
Fort looked scary af running that ball
to think the steelers didn't want Fort and his massive fucking biceps?
"Wow, Fort looked amazing. That scoop, the carry, the eye for blocking, the dive at the end. 

He must have played lots of offense in high school or something. Looked natural out there. 

Also, that was a TD."
I love overreacting at the slightest hindrance but also screaming my throat out at play like this. Being a ravens fan is so fun
See y‚Äôall? R-E-L-A-X
Little known fact.  LJ stands for Lyndon Johnson.
"don't get me wrong i'm always happy whenever we get a TD, but you just love to see a guy happy on the sideline. happy for you fort."
Fruit PUNCH!!
Take in we found out about LJ Fort at our joint practice with the eagles last year. He impressed and we stole him from their practice squad. Now he's absolutely balling
"‚ÄúJustin Tucker with another kick. He‚Äôs getting tired!‚Äù

I love Kevin Harlan."
Thank GOD we finally woke up üí™üèæ
My god what have we done!
GOOD SHIT PETERS LETS FUCK EM UP
God I fucking love our secondary
I almost yelled REEEEEEEEEDDDDDD!
"Holy shit 

These defense is scary"
I‚Äôm ready for RG3
LMFAO imagine taking jalen ramsey over marcus peters
This is the greatest day I‚Äôve had since last Sunday
Fruit Punch and Juiceman
We are going to be getting some bandwagon fans this year aren't we? I haven't seen a Ravens team this good in fucking years.
Damn OBJ is getting manhandled
We need to get Yanda beefy again and get him suited up.
"WTF is happening with this line?  At least Stanley is walking it off but fuck man, Yanda‚Äôs absence is hurting us."
Please be okay Stanley üôèüèª
"What is our o-line doing? 2nd last year, today we look like 2nd to last... Come on now"
What a bullshit call on Averett
Someone fire up the ‚Äúbull shit‚Äù chant
How the fuck do they miss that hold on Judon jesus christ
Averet is horrible man
That was a bs call. Averett getting targeted
Those are some shitty penalties. How the heck can a receiver just bowl somebody over and get the flag...
Why did the fucking clock stop? What???
But they didn't have a t/o and didnt spike it?
"I‚Äôll take a 20-10 lead on the road while getting the ball to start the 2nd half, but definitely had a couple missed opportunities. 

Shoulda scored off the Peters Pick, Oline needs to play way better, but overall a great first half"
"""non-traditonal quarterback play"". How traditional we talking because I'm sure Lamar is more throwback than most"
"The texans have turned the ball over 3x yet are only down 10. They held the ravens to 2 field goals and sacked them out of fg range for a third. 

This may sound weird but the texans' defense is actually doing a decent job while sticking to their game plan. Stop the run @ all costs, get the ravens to 3rd and long & hunt. 

Good thing our defense has been opportunistic & our offense hasn't turned the ball over. 

W/ all of that being said, the ravens could win this game going away if they get their ground game going. Tire out the texans' defensive front & this game is done."
"fuck yeah lets run with Gus More

*next play hit behind line of scrimmage*"
He didnt play that ball? Am i crazy?
Was that not PI? The defender wasn't looking for the ball
How was that not PI
Orlando Brown hardly even trying right now :(
So thankful we have tucker
How was there no PI on that throw to Marky Mark bruh
I like running that clock down. Let's keep doing that.
Damn man 4 sacks wowwww
"You know. I understand we are winning and everything.

But these refs need to call penalties correctly. If that was the texans that would be PI on us. Give us a break"
Chances we see Fluker next game?
We are good but I feel like this team needs a wake up call
Wilson looking like Pablo Escobar lol
Get Avrett some help.
Averett is so fucking bad
"I‚Äôll say it again, Averrett needs to be OFF THE FIELD"
Stop letting them hang around
Wow. 4th Q already. Our first drive was amazing time killer. Now got to get them off the field on 3rd and long.
Hold em to 3 here and put em away next possession
Averet out there giving me sharese Wright flashbacks
Queen jumping on that pile was a real Ravens move. Love this kid
Hopefully we follow up with a nice long drive for a score to ice it
"Lmao who yelled ""oh my god""?"
Seeing Baby Yoda made me feel a little less anxious
I dont think Watt played in our game last year.  He has been the difference today
#MARK MOTHERFUCKING INGRAM
#BIG BOI NO LIL BOI
*tears* **thats my running back**
Hahaha that kick in the EZ haha
"BIG BALLS HARBAUGH
BIG TRUSS INGRAM  
WOO WOO
SIX POINTS"
Lol Hollywood trying to bully through two guys for 3 yards and a 1st down was kinda funny. Especially when Mark breaks a 30 yard TD right after it on 4th down.
"Only way I would have loved that more were if it were a direct snap to Ricard who then threw a TD pass to Lamar because why the fuck not, Lamar needs to add ""Not bad for a Wide Receiver"" to his resume."
BIGGGG BOIIII
I fucking love that creativity in the play calling
You say big truss you get a big upvote
I thought that was lamar lol
"We scored 30 on an off day, against a competent opponent. We aight"
Feel bad for Watson get my guy a real franchise...
Elliot is loads better than Earl at blitzing
Alright 99yd TD to Hollywood GO
Score again
"I don‚Äôt mean to alarm y‚Äôall, but the Chiefs just tied with the Chargers"
Good challenge. Low risk high reward. Even if he  doesn‚Äôt get it it‚Äôs just a QB sneak
Why did 90 get ejected?
Any have a gif of what got that texan ejected?
"Lamar, Humphrey, Peters, Ingram, Tuck, Queen, Andrews, Hollywood all killin it

But yo. It feels so good when our support guys are making monster plays. Fort obviously, but Gus bus making big moves, Snead has been a monster anytime the ball‚Äôs been near him, Boykin making some HUGE blocks, D line getting TONS of pressure. I love this team..."
Pass rush has been better in the 2nd half
Daaaamn JK!
‚ÄúRides him down like a rodeo cowboy‚Äù O_O
"Seriously not fucking fair to have Ingram, Gus, and JK(and Justice Hill)"
Next week‚Äôs game is going to make me drink heavily
"Well, a rookie threw for over 300 on this D. Hopefully Lamar can do the same."
No pass rush is going to be the death of this team.
You guys are honestly the worst sometimes. Holy shit.
T young is made of phone chargers
Not again Tavon :(
Good thing we have CB depth
"god damn... feels so bad for Tavon, hopefully he's good"
There's going to be sooooo many commercials
And the Sunday of a million injuries strikes Baltimore
[deleted]
Queen's got a motor on him.  Good.
Queen was a great pick up never gives up on the play
Run the fucking ball
Offensive line does NOT look good so far
"Even with the O-line woes and Tavon injury, we can all take some chicken soup for the soul and watch Tucker work his craft."
Where can I get that face cover that Harbaugh is wearing? Looks like the MD flag but with Ravens colors
Tucker still fucking has it
Offensive line needs help
53 won't hear the end of that
"Don't forget y'all, this is exactly how the game started last year. We won no contest 5 times over. Chill"
Ward is too big for that shit üò§
Hey only we can do that!
LMAO DUMBASS BILL OBRIAN
GREAT pressure those past 2 plays. Now turn this into a TD
Wallstreetbets
If they're going for it on 4th and 1 on their own 30 you know they're scared
Just remember last year when we played the texans we started slow
##yas queen
off topic but how the fuck did the cowboys win their game
WHAT AN AMAZING CATCH BY PROJECT PAT
I feel so much better now lmao
Okay be honest who had Picard picked for a TD
CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES COME ON
lol imagine giving up a receiving TD to a defensive lineman
What a catch by ricard. Wow.
And y‚Äôall were worried in the first half.. trust in Lamar
KC is getting beat by the chargers
Gonna need to answer those short TE passes over the middle.
"Our pass rushers, especially unblocked blitzers need to play with discipline in the backfield and stop blowing past Deshaun every time"
"I‚Äôm out of beer 

This is a tragedy"
"Ordered some DoorDash sushi - If I die, I die"
Where is JK?
Still fuckin got it!
Glad we're getting points but wish we could be turning those into TDs
#GOD I LOVE HUMPHREY!! THAT'S A TD
THE MARLO PUNCH IS BAAAACK
THAT WAS A TD WTF
MARLOOOOO
You know what im talking about to JuJu!!!
Marlo with the punch!!!
Thats a td
MARLON FUCK YEA BABY
Fruit punch baby!!
"That bounce off the fumble was perfect for Fort.

If this gets upheld the Ravens better make it count"
Marlon's punch is legendary
"Even if it‚Äôs not a score I think we can punch it in from the 1, hopefully with JK, cause I flexed him in fantasy lol"
Give that man his touchdown!
They're reviewing the turnover. Can they change it to a TD if they see it?
That‚Äôs a touchdown
"PAY LLAMA, PAY HUMPHREY, PAY STANLEY"
Our secondary is SCARYYYYYY Marlo with a big forced fumble
"The way Marlon punches the ball out so well reminds me of Peanut Tillman.

FBI Officer Tillman is currently a 2020 HoF nominee.

All hail King Marlon"
LJ Fort was such a good pick up
I was surprised the broadcasters weren't calling out that it was an obvious TD.
Linebacker unit is looking very solid
I like when Kevin Harlan does our game
Defense woke up! Just how I like it DIRTY!
MARCUS PETERS! LEGENDARY
Peters grew three feet on that dive
JUICEMAAAAAANNNNN!!!!!
My god this defense ya'll
JUICE JUICE JUICE
Defensive Play Of The Year right there
Holy shit I think Peters just pulled a micheal jordan and grew six feet for that pick
Dear lord what a catch
"But muh defense... 

You people are so impatient"
Has juiceman always been his name??
What a pick!!! Dudes a bonafide stud
Hope Tavon is ok. :/
We are almost too good of a team. everyone is going to start hating on us
The talent on this team is absolutely disgusting.
I‚Äôd like to apologize for my doubts when the game began
"I literally yelled ""OHHHHHH"" when Peters got that INT."
O Line might be the only negative this half so far.
"can watt

like

*not*"
Love how the FG target line CBS makes for Tucker is at like the 45 lmao
Stanley down noooooooo
Dobbins can‚Äôt block
Buying offensive line 10k west varrock bank
offensive line has room for improvement.
This is like worst o line performance I‚Äôve seen since like 2017... they got 3 sacks on Lamar not even fucking Aaron Donald got a touch on Lamar last year
Shitty playcall considering how bad the line has been
Averett has not had a single positive play his time here
How many times can Judon fly into the backfield and whiff man
Thanks refs...
Wtf why did they give them extra time?
Refs are the best players on the Texans.
Houston clawing and scratching to just stay within 10
Suck a nut refs
Before that last drive I was just thinking how the refs have been pretty decent thus far this season. After that drive WHAT THE DAMN HELL REFS YOU PIECE OF SHIT
Officials kinda lost the handle over that last minute.
offensive is a bit shaky. Defense are killing it
Offensive play calling is absolutely embarrassing. When did we bring Marty back?
i know you guys think we need to win this game by 50 but i just want to avoid the injury gods at play today. i will consider that a win.
pollard acting like a clown on twitter again to no one's surprise
We‚Äôre playing okay considering everything. O line needs to step the fuck up no more sacks
should we rotate Fluker in at RG?
"I'm just gonna say we still adjusting to lack of pre season & fans. I mean these 10pts don't feel great to up by, but its not like we down 8pts to a rookie qb right nowüòè"
We scored 20 points on a playoff team in their stadium. We're doing more than fine
"the ravens: put in a run 

this sub: i pretend i do not see it and continue to complain about throws."
Just had flashbacks of Ray Rice.  Dobbins is money üí∞
Ahh you got me short of the first. JK
Long ass drive
Shouldn't the defender have turned for the ball?
Awful O-line man smh
That was a close one there Tuck
still fuckin got it
I wish this game was more like our last matchup
This O-Line needs to get their shit together quick
Didn‚Äôt realize we were playing SF‚Äôs all-world D-line today. Embarrassing.
this OL play is pathetic
"This O Line... smdh.

What was that, sack number 4?? 

Need to get that shit straight."
Oline was shit week 1 also....They had terrible grades ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Queen is fast as hell
Don't even bring 23 home with us. God awful.
Of course it was on Averett. How the fuck is this guy still on the team
plz get averett outta here
Averrett getting absolutely demolished here.
Patrick leaping on the pile lmao
"Look I get being homers, but the fact that a lot of people can't respect what Watson does is kinda sad. He's playing a great game so far. They better not win or I'll probably join the blind homerist discussion, but at least give respect where respect is due."
Averett has singlehandedly put bend don‚Äôt break back on the menu.
Need to put the nail in the coffin on this drive TD and games over
Not sure why you‚Äôd go for 3 here
Alright same drive as the last one and let's go home and get ready for KC
Deshaun looks sad lol
I just creamed my pants
What a fucking play call
WATCHING IN MY HOTEL ROOM ON STUPID GAMECAST AND HOLY TITS IM HYPED
"I love that we went for it on 4th there, great call and great execution!"
Ok low key was like wtf is this wildcat...I‚Äôll sit down
2/2 on 4th down conversions.
i can't wait for ingram's post game at the mic
"Watson's having a decent game today, will give him that."
Do we have any update on Tavon? Haven‚Äôt heard anything from announcers
THA J O K E R
I truly do not understand how some analysts had Deshaun Watson rated above Lamar going into this season
Good challenge.
"Good challenge here. Don't get it, we can go for it on 4th and we burn a time out (Which we may not need). Get it and it's a 1st."
Challange it man he stretched out it should be good
Go for it. All aboard the Gus Bus.
#BLEED THE CLOCK
All aboard the Gus bus
gus Edwards is the rg3 of the rbs lol. show up to close it out
Gus is a starting RB
GUS BUS LETS GO
Theeeeeee wheels on the bus go MOVE BITCH
Why did this guy get DQ'd?
Stop running out of bounds
That's like 80 seconds that should be off the clock Roman fucked up
"The two sweeps were really crap calls. Regardless, points are points. GG Houston!"
Why did that player get ejected? I didn‚Äôt catch it
The shots of the Texans sideline makes them all look depressed
DOBBY!!!
DOBBINS!!!
JK just ripping off 40 yard run like it‚Äôs nothing!!!!
"Man I wish he‚Äôd of scored on that, would of made flexing him worth it"
‚ÄúRides him down like a rodeo cowboy‚Äù.... wat
"I almost feel bad for the Texans. After getting pounded by Ingram and Edwards, Dobbins comes in and absolutely gashes them."
YABBA DABBA DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Can we talk about half time adjustments both weeks so far? Especially the Oline this week. RBs have had great vision but Oline just blasting holes
2-0! Bring on the Chiefs
No lie the LA stadium looks amazeballs
Ok. That dude kicked three 58 yd field goals. Two in a row after an ice timeout.
Sometime my inner masochist wants tucker to kick my balls. His amazing leg caressing my scrotum would truly be sensational
People are acting like the Texans are a bad team. They were literally up by like 21 or something against the Superbowl champions in the playoffs last year. This game isn‚Äôt going to be like last week.
with this o-line the Steelers might have a fucking field day with us gah damn
CBS production has been very poor today
"This sub is spoiled as hell tho. Why the hell are some of y‚Äôall complaining when we‚Äôre up 10 and getting the ball to start the 2nd half on the road? 

I‚Äôll take this shit every week!"
This subs annoying if we aren't crushing the other team
"What the FUCK is our offensive line doing? They're traffic cones right now for the Texans. And oh boy, Stanley might be injured again. Just great. Here comes another game where Lamar has to do literally everything for the offense."
Talk about keeping a team in it at the end of the half
Refs gave them 3 points
Texans are such pussies for taking a FG. Although i guess it was fourth and 15.
Oh I see. The Chiefs are clearly going to win lol
CBS needs to hurry and put this game on lol
Damn Judon almost had him
"I'M FUCKING DONE WITH TAVON, LETS DRAFT SLOT CB"
A sight all too familiar to us flock:Tavon young making a great defensive play and then limping off the field.
"The number of big names going down to injury today has me quite concerned for our boys, and even more so now."
They should ban turf!
Please fucking run
what are they cheering about? a helmet to helmet hit? lol
Today is fucked I‚Äôll die if Lamar gets hurt
Lamar showing elite composure rn
"I get that the Texans are running 8-man boxes all day, but do we only have one rush from an RB so far?"
I miss Yanda
Playcalling reminds me of the bills game. Too much trickery. I guess we're putting it on tape for the chiefs but... w/e
Both O lines look terrible. Dshaun must be use to by now
"Dang, nice moves Watson"
Big props to Ward for letting that sack go and avoiding the horsecollar - had both hands inside the jersey at the neckline
Good gracious what a freaking escape by Watson
Already in fg Range sick
Let‚Äôs go! Joker SZN
Tells you what they think of their chances today that they‚Äôd go for that.
GOOD SHIT ELLIOT
Lol. Bill O'Brien is fucking stupid
At least the Texans failed on that 4th and 1
Hell yeah!
"man , my stream is sloow"
Let‚Äôs get ittttt
Lamar really making project pat work for that td lol. Great play though
Pat looked like he's made of rubber
Is is me or did Joker just play that like E dub and force Watson to call timeout
"Wait, there‚Äôs no crowd noise? Then where is all that cheering coming from???"
Damn it.  I hate when they get first downs
"Wow that was sloppy, no pressure and left WIDE open"
Pass rush is garbage when just 4
We need pash rush right now.
Who's fault was that on the deep pass. Elliott?
That's fine. Respond right back
Wheres the pass rush?
I hope the downers here realize in the game of football both teams usually give up a touchdown or two a game. Not every game is gonna be 45-6 calm down everyone
Fuck off Baker we don‚Äôt care about your book club
Lamar looks unbelievably calm out there. Amazing how he continues to get better.
I hope we invest in the online next year. Hate seeing LJ run for his life.
Sam Koch can secretly throw. Tucker can secretly catch. I think we found our next QB/WR duo
Mr. Automatic!!
We aren't sneaking up on anyone. Texans are facing 0-2 and they're ready for us.
How perfect is it to have a Fort on Defense?
No fucking way this team is incredible
"Damn, thought he was in lol. Glad we got that all the same"
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT D!!!! LJ FORT!!! MARLON!!!
That's a TD.
LJ taking over the game!
I love Marlo
Marlooooooo!!!
This game is about to get ugly. Can‚Äôt help but feel terrible for Deshaun. He deserves so much better
Fruit punch!!!!!
"Pay peanut, holy fuck. What a play by Fort. They‚Äôre gonna show that all week."
"Yeah, that's going to be a TD."
Definitely a tuddy. Awesome stuff. Pretty sure Judon got blocked in the back on the rush too
Tuddy all day üìàüìàüìà
Goddamn. The defense does *not* look sluggish.
TD confirmed!
I love Marlon
Lamar Jackson Fort
Dang Harrison is FAST
WHAT A PICK
I‚Äôm gonna nut
#GOD I LOVE OUR CORNERS
WE FEASTING TODAY BOIS
BALLHAWKIN PETERS WOW
#MP JUICEMANNNNNNN
After a slow start... RAVENS ARE BACK BABY! MP Juiceman in the house baby
Marcus F'n Peters!
Dude should be a WR lol
Let‚Äôs fucking go Marcus Peters!!!!
**Juiceman!**
Defense rolling now
About to be back to back years of having two all pro corners
HOLEEEEE FUCKKK WHAT AN INT.
Deshaun looks scared against our D just like last year
MP Juuuuuuiiiiceman!
HELL YEAH D
YALL HAVE NO FAITH
"I‚Äôm so fucking glad we‚Äôve got peters, for a 5TH rounder"
"MP JUICE MAN! they thought it was sweet, but it was really sour!"
This is a championship type defense. Turnovers are strongly correlated to Super Bowl runs.
Ravens MVP Kaare Vedvik
Dear god. I remember like 6 seasons where we didn‚Äôt have a single WIDE RECEIVER that could make that catch
Lamar just felt bad that Watt hasn't had many sacks lately and wanted him to feel good. Good guy Lamar man.
How much farther back is Tuck‚Äôs FG target line than other teams?
Weirdly poor pocket presence there from Lamar. Had an opening to his right but twirled into that sack.
Ronnie stanley is hurt
Yanda come back
Ronnie pls
Online is awful today
Lamar having Louisville flashbacks with this O line play today
Anthony Averett is def our worst corner
Why does it take literally our entire defense plus a couple camera guys to tackle Watson?
Averett needs to be off the field right now
Lmao fucking bullshit call
Omg these calls
That OL is not ideal
Soft as shit call
Levine & Averrett having shit games.
Fucking home job
Jesus christ Averett is piss poor per the usual. Is their no free agent or practice squander out there?
Seeing Averett out there is giving me flashbacks to last years Browns loss. God he is awful. We need Tavon back.
What the fuck is that call????????
What in the world
"I‚Äôd rather have Canady than Averrtt, he‚Äôs just horrible"
What the everloving shit is going on with the refs on this drive?
"I think we're a bit spoiled. It's the NFL, we're not going to dominate literally every play/drive of the game. We're up 10 at the half, KC is down 8. We are an elite team, but we aren't perfect. Let's not lose sight of that."
Refs fucking called shit illegal contact then stop the clock .
Not getting points off of that turnover is rough
Either flag us or keep the clock running wtf is a 4 second add?
I‚Äôm mad but I‚Äôm also just plain confused. Wtf rule are the refs invoking here?
blatant hold on Judon right after the wiped sack
Can someone get the oline motivated? Can we make some running lanes and get these backs going strong!
We seem off. Offensive game plan seems off. Without the Def TD it would look a lot different at half. Hope we can adjust at half and settle some. These guys don't look like they can play with our guys. We should run them out of the place.
We get the ball after the half. Just have to settle in more. We know we have the talent.
joe flacco > kirk cousins
If they're so disappointed in the run game how about running the ball more lol
Boykin  is much improved
Harbaugh sucking on his mask looks so weird lol
Is Dobbins hurt? Is he active?
‚ÄúExciting even when he gains one yard‚Äù
"When I drink stout, we play questionably. When i drink tequila, we play consistent as fuck. I know what I must do, boys"
teams are doing a better job of closing off the amount of space Lamar has to work with
Oh you thought he was down? JK!
Wow what a play.  Shades of Ray Rice vs Cinci years.ago
how was that not pass interference?
PI?
4 sacks today?  O line butt today
Yo o line is straight trash
Roman needs to run some screens
Tucker out here doing trick shots on his FGs now
23-7 sounds a lot better than 23-10.
Really need to rally that OL during this defensive series
Taking a second to to admire Tucker.  That FG was beautiful. Close but most would not have made it.
They are abusing Tyree and Brown whew
Ravens should have swallowed their pride and brought back Osemele. Oh well.
If this stream drops audio one more time I‚Äôm going to report it.
Everyone bitch in about this team even the play calling is fine we are not KC down 11 to a fucking rookie
Watson is a tough mf to bring down
Nanny McPhee seems to always be getting in the backfield today. Still goin strong
OMG Averett is garbage.... how do you give that up!?!?
AVERETT is literally so fucking bad. Please cut his ass and start tucker.
Picking on Averett bad.
Averatt is just getting demoralised
Averette is ASS
Yeah get Averett off the fucking field
"avarett is not good, i agree. you just have to feel bad for the guy though. will be picked on all game ever since both marlon and MP caused turnovers."
Averett consistently gets beat ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Damn what a throw Watson
oh fuck off Trent Green.
"Lol @ PQ leaping on top of everyone else

""This is MY pile!"""
They fucking dogpiled him LMAO
It looks like we put in Jimmy for Marlon and gave Marlon slot duty back while Young is out
"Averett is showing why he's the 4th option. 
It's not that he sucks, it's just that he's not a one-half and two option on a starting defense."
This drive has felt like forever
ohhhh my gawd
Now let's just grind the hell out of them for 10 minutes and end this with a TD
Mando!
Not sure why but I've got respect for JJ.  His brother (although good) seems like a dirty player.
"Watt has played really well, credit where it's due."
BIG TRUZZZZZZ
BIG BOI NO LITTLE BOI
INGRAM
THAT'S HOW YOU 4TH DOWN IT BABY!!!
GOD I LOVE THIS TEAM SO MUCH
With the roundhouse kick lmao
"ERRYBODY GET IN HERE, WE DID A RUN BLOCK!!!!!!!"
Kick that fucking bull! Let‚Äôs fucking go
So everything‚Äôs back to fine again üòÇ
Dis that dirty biiird gameplay I was promised.
Someone link the replay....   Plz.
[Harbaugh balls for calling a play like that.](https://i.imgur.com/U1x9Jko.jpg)
That was some tomfoolery play and I live for it.
"Dang, so many big name injuries today"
Why do I feel like 17 points still ain't enough? Must be that Cowboys/Falcons game from earlier. (Plus I'll never count out Watson.)
Lmao @ Hollywood dancing menacingly towards David Johnson
A Lamar TD pass to Hollywood to end this game would be absolutely pizza pie for me
JOKERRRRRR
he's the Jokaa Baybeee!
DeShaun gonna make some money he keeps this up.
WARM UP THE BUS
Here comes the passrush
Time to feed those running backs
Unpopular opinion: We extend Ingram for 2 years.
". . . lamar throws a somewhat wobbly pass for a touchdown and lamar gets roasted, and mahomes finally ties the chargers and he gets ""wow just wow"""
20-3 career start? Not bad for a running back
KC is scary. But at the end of the day is just about getting to the playoffs and being hot at that time.
Texans damn lucky. That was an inch from being a touchdown.
Jeez I forgot we play KC next week. Huge game
"Yeah challenge the spot, he reached that fd"
I like this challenge. Looked close and we can just use it as a timeout to figure out things anyhow
Assert dominance. Go for it and go long to Hollywood.
Thats how you do it.
The fake fake
big dick harbs
Gus is a gamer
Gus could legit be a #1 on a bunch of teams
"This is why you pound the rock. They know its coming and can‚Äôt stop it, easier for oline to runblock than pass block too. Gus has earned more touches"
Lightning McQueen leading the team in tackles again! LOVING this guy
"Please explain, why is this player disqualified?  I don't understand.  TY"
"TICKETS PLEASE.


 The bus will be departing soon."
Replay of foul?
Anybody know what just happened?
I want Harbaugh's neck gaiter.
Why do they keep running to the sideline? Cmon.
Can't believe we didn't throw once on that drive.
I hope the people saying go for it aren‚Äôt serious
Super Bowl Confirmed?
Thank god for that graphic I would‚Äôve never known that guy won MVP
The ravens have generated 22 pressures today
DOBBINS YESSS
JK
Run of the day!!
"Dobbins: Drop the taco judon, get in the freaking bus"
DOBBINS!!
Next week is gonna be a crazy game
Texans have no heart left. They do t give a fuck lol
I want a Lamar touchdown
"Oof, if KC loses to LA, they're coming here fired up lol."
"Ooo I‚Äôm so hyped for next week 

LETS GOOOOOOIOOO!"
Here we go with the refs...
Dobbins needs to learn how to block
Play calling seems to be a lil too cute right now.
I don't like these play calls. Things feel very conservative right now.
Hollywood be frying niggas man lol. Butt ass. Ass naked out there
Who the hell just said Marlon needs to wake up the d with a big play? Damn sorcery
"O line needs to step up, but not as much as the officiating does. I don‚Äôt know how you miss the TD live when it‚Äôs right in front of you, and then the 2 illegal contact calls and the absurd pause to give the Texans enough time to kick a FG is just inexcusable shit. This crew shouldn‚Äôt get another game this season."
Anyone concerned about the score is a 2019 era new Ravens fan
O line is officially the weak link of team
r/TexasCuckoldCommunity
some of you became fans of the ravens last season and it shows.
"I‚Äôm not sure where all of the chastising is coming from. These gameday threads are literally all just hot takes. It‚Äôs what you came here for, and it‚Äôs just the nature of these threads. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
it‚Äôs kind of depressing without crowd noise
Defense was pathetic that drive
"ravens 20

texans 7

refs 3"
"Averett, Shareece Wright, Chykie Brown, Maurice Canady, and Dominique Franks are the same ‚Äúgive up a 10+ yard catch on 3rd down‚Äù corner, change my view"
Let‚Äôs Fuckin Feast!!!
Broncos keeping it close üëÄ
"LOL, Denver is really pushing the Squealers."
"Looking at all the injuries this week, I hope our Ravens will be safe"
You had one job Denver :(
Thank god we play the giants at home. MetLife field  is ending everybody‚Äôs season
jimmy gets by with a lil help from his friends <3
Good shit Jimmy
Great 1-on-1 stop by Jimmy
"Good start, let's get it"
I swear the biggest cheat code for our offense is 5 wide but we barely ever do it smh
I love how long NFL commercial breaks are
Is Tavon Young made of glass
Wow well its our turn i guess what a terrible day for injuries man
Looks like he came down on that left leg and the knee just flexed out to the side.  No bueno.
"He was limping off, I bet he's ok"
Someone spiked the NFL‚Äôs Gatorade stash with bone hurting juice apparently
Young is made of glass
Could be ok. Fingers crossed
Yaaaas queen
Queen is gonna be a BEAST
Fuck I thought the ball was out but it was just Johnson's red shoes
How many times am I gonna have to watch mahomes play cornhole smh
Run the fucking ball
Lol run plz?
"Does Lamar's balls look zippier today to anyone else?  Like last year they looked solid, but today the just shoot out."
Apparently everyone in here thinks they would be a better OC than Roman
The Oline doesn‚Äôt exist today
I miss Yanda
Yanda plz comeback
What the fuck is our O-line doing right now? The Texans are using them like turnstiles
Why do teams still use Turf. Jesus
Can Lamar not hit the hard ass fake field with his throwing hand? Cool thanks.
The Texans are playing great defense.
"On 3rd & 7, why do we have 3 players running routes underneath the sticks?"
Texans are playing well. Don't forget there's another team on the field. We looked good enough
What‚Äôs up with the fans on here making crazy takes after 2 drives? Same thing happened last week but for the defense.
Damn everyone in here's a better play caller than Greg Roman I guess from the sound of it
that was impressive by Watson to break free from Ward
Ward just got daddied
Jesus what a hell of an escape.
Earl Who?
Fantastic fucking stand
Holy fuck what a terrible decision
"It pumps me up that our offense is so good teams have to take shots like that 4th and 1, and our defense is tough enough to shut it all down"
Lmaooo that was a ballsy move
JOOOOOKER
Opposing teams feel the need.to be aggressive with us.  Just like the Ravens when we played KC.  I don't blame them going for it.  Risky but it has to be done against high scoring teams.
"great clean stop

we got to punish these stupid decisions, let's get 7"
"If we don‚Äôt get 7 off this, imma be pissed"
"So, our offense is so freaking scary teams are running bad 4th downs in the hope they keep us off the field. Feels damn good."
Fuck yes
THAT'S MY BLOCKING TIGHT END FIGHTING
pat Ricard what a unit
BIG BOIS GOTTA EAT what a play by Ricard
What a snag
PROJECT PAT
Great catch
Pat really redeemed him self from last week there.
_My erection enters the chat_
Going for it on 4th in your own territory is a bold move against this offense
Awesome catch by Ricard but poor Boyle can never get in the endzone
"CAPTAIN RICARD, MADE IT SO"
Hopefully Tavon can come back this year
CMON JIMMY
Fuck that was a nice catch by Ricard!
yasss it's Lamar
Seahawks gonna bring Cam back to reality tonight I think
That's a big yikes
That‚Äôs on Elliot
Smhhh
I never understood why some underestimate Deshaun.  He's one of the best QBs in the league.
DUUUUV
Ingram heard y‚Äôall talking shit
Put Tucker out there in the slot
Going from Joe to Lamar feels illegal
"Holy shit, Romeo Crennel still exists!"
i love this belichick commercial lolll
Feel like he couldve picked up the first
"Clean game so far. No penalties, no turnovers, no sacks? Or pretty close to none.

Any turnover is gonna be big."
D needs to step up. No pressure at all
I swear i saw someone comment that we need marlon to force a fumble literally a few minutes ago
WHO NEEDS A NATIONAL GAME WHEN YOU GET KEVIN HARLAN
How is that not a TD?!??
That‚Äôs 6 come on!
HUMPH WITH HIS FINISHING MOVE
UNDER REVIEW????
LETS GOOOOOOO. AWESOME
That‚Äôs a TD
I really need Harbaugh to challenge this for my fantasy
Bro imagine thinking you‚Äôre gonna beat the Ravens while giving up defensive touchdowns ü§£
Let's go Marlo!!!!
Thats a td boys
Humphrey graduated from the peanut Tillman school for DBs in case anyone was wondering. Head of his class too.
Pay marlon!
All Pro Marlo üíú
FUMBLE TD!

Goddamn that was an effort at the very limits of human capability for Fort to get that in there.  Amazing!
Tucker practicing his bending techniques on these kicks
"Mega hustle from Fort!

All right defense, don't let up! Should be well rested after all the TV breaks and reviews."
ya know arizona looks great this year.
Queen in coverage over a wr??
MP!!!!!
Interception!!
FULLY ERECT
This Team is fucking good
HOLY FUCK PETERS üî•
Marcus fucking Peters
JUICEMAN ü•§
WHAT A FUCKING PLAY
MP JUICEMAN!!!!!!!
I love MP Juiceman
HOLY FUCK WHAT A FUCKING PICK
MP GRAPE JUICE MAN
OOF
Oh my word
OUR DEFENSE IS HUNGRY!!!!!
JUICE
MPJuiceman looking like Ed Reed
What a game so far after that slow start
JUICEMAN
Our elite corners showing out today
So what EDGE we trading for?
"TD, halftime, TD, game"
Now it‚Äôs time to step on their throats and end this before the half. Let‚Äôs go boys
"Let's gooooooo.

Chance here to pull a Belichick Special. Double-dip before end of half and we start the 3rd with the ball."
"MP ditched his man in the flat and double backed for the snag. Such a sneaky fuck, love it."
Holy crap that int was fucking beautiful
Peters took a page out of Ed Reeds book with that int
Watt is destroying OBJ
I want you all to just take a moment to appreciate this special roster of guys we have right now. Don‚Äôt take it for granted.
I miss Yanda :(
Not today Watt any other day is fine...
Not Stanley üò±
Online playing like total dog shit today.
oh fuck oh fuck not stanley please
Averett is a bum.
Are you fucking kidding me?!
Queen is an absolute beast
Averett is such a fucking liabilty
Fucking Averett you know he‚Äôs going to the sideline
LOL WUT
WTF Averrett is allowed his field what a joke
"Fucking dammit, you can't let deshaun do that."
Having not seen Averette for awhile I completely forgot how TRASH he is
Wtf just happened
Houston a bunch of pussies
Not worried. Couple of gifts from the refs there.
Lol that‚Äôs bullshit.
"That one weak, and simply wrong, illegal contact call on the sack made the whole drive happen, but that doesn't excuse every other play. That was awful"
Refs were dogshit down the stretch. That illegal contact on the sack was soft as fuck.
This Texans team is so trash. We're keeping them in the game. God it must suck to be a fan in Houston
That was legit. You can't delay the game because the ref fucks up. Same thing as moving the chains. If they aren't set the refs can pause the game because *they* fucked up. Not the other team
Dear God I hope uncle Eric is on the phone calling someone to play corner next week.
"I‚Äôm still really confused why the refs gave them a free timeout, not suspicious at all"
We're up 10 but only have 5 rushes by rbs. I understand letting the defense pick their poison but you can't just allow them to get us out of our game.
"Hey Greg, think you're gonna run it more than 5 times in the second half?"
Pass protection has been crap.  Need to run some draws/screens or roll Lamar out to slow them down
Did Dobbins get a single snap in that half
"Once again, the coaches are forgetting that the Ravens are a run-first team..."
"Anyone else want to see some more 2 TE sets and JK Dobbins in the 2nd half?

We need to slow this pass rush down"
Also our D-line has gotten pretty good pressure but Watson‚Äôs athleticism is phenomenal
Don‚Äôt know why a lot of you are angry . Deshaun is going to make plays he‚Äôs arguably a top 5 guy and we‚Äôre so lucky D hop ain‚Äôt playing with the Texans anymore. Texans are bound to make more bone headed TOs and bad plays we got this Guys.
It‚Äôs never worth to return kickoffs anymore because all of the flags and the small likelihood of actually getting past the 25
Maybe the Gus Bus is like the Texans kryptonite
"Ah yes, the Ol' Akron Pros"
Dobbins staying up after that contact was amazing.
"Dobbins: aw jeez looks like you got me 

JK"
That was Ray Rice like holy shit
Jk ray rice
Good read and play switch by Lamar
Dobbins good.
Wow. That‚Äôs was Ray Rice chills man spooky
Obvious PI.  Dude could be kissing Mandrews.
How was that good coverage?
Excuse me I forgot. What does an o-line do?
"Scaring me there, Tuck."
That was SNUCK in there damn
thank god we have tucker
almost had to burn down a village there for a second
Llama gonna need some ice packs after this game
Ok wtf is going on with our o line
"God won't allow Tuck to miss, i swear."
Missing Yanda so bad
This IOL man.
Dude. If our line is this bad -- CALL DIFFERENT ROUTES. Spread them 5 wide. Call a screen. Do literally ANYTHING different. Jesus.
I would really like Fluker to start at guard for now. He wouldn't get bullied in the run game.
Well it's a good thing he overthrew that lol
Wink bout to send some heavy pressure on the right side
I do think we see Fluker at RG next week but ya'll saying Brown Jr. Looks bad and Yanda made him good have apperantly forgotten who hes going against damn near every play. Id like to see a Tackle playing next to a rookie guard that doesnt get eaten alive by JJ Watt
Even with that sack Watson looks like he‚Äôs covered in oil lmao
why is Averett on the field
FUCKING AVERETT
Averett cant keep up
What a fucking throw by Watson
"Cut Averett, he‚Äôs always the culprit"
Averett needs to be cut
Picking on Averett alllllll day
Averett sucks
Can't let them get more than a FG here with the amount of penalties and TFL we have had. Let's shut it down.
Avarett is already playing garbage time.
Please bench averett asap
Line is starting to get pressure.
"Queen be like, ""I want the tackle too!"""
we need tavon back man
"Yeah, we do not have to do this Averett experiment. Just play Jimmy."
i miss lamar </3
Man I hope we can pound the rock and burn some clock on this next possession
I love wink's scheming. Fuckin 8 defenders on the LOS.
We need to put the Texans away now. This is the way.
"Lol, people are still roasting Averette üòÇ"
Herbert has 3 more completions than Mahomes and 125 more yards
Cactus Jack sent me
"It's early but our OL just doesn't look the same in the run game. Yanda retiring & skura not being 100% are 2 reasons why. Both opposing defenses have sold out to stop the run as well.

As the new OL builds cohesion, i think they'll start to dominate on the ground again."
Did Lamar just reverse Summersault
**Snead has the need for Speed**
"I really like Snead IV.  He shows up every game for something, and that was a tough-ass run after catch."
Murray runs so weird
Kyler Murray has me worried if we meet them in the SB. He's so much better this year
"The best part about Lamar is how much he just loves the game and everyone included, breaks two tackles falls over the guys, gets up helps them up and hugs both of the texans players"
This just in. Lamar Jackson sandbagging so that he could play a full football game
INGRAMMM
HELL YEAH COACH LETS GO FOR IT
So much for eating clock but fuck it LETS GOOOOOOOO
Not bad for a RB
He just Cobra Kai'd their logo.  Dayam.
HELL YEAH COACH LET'S GO FOR IT
CANT HANG. THATS FUCKING BALTIMORE FOOTBALL RIGHT THERE
Ingram was so hyped üòÇ
THAT‚ÄôS how you do a 4th and 1
ROUNDHOUSE
üòÇüòÇüòÇ He busted roundhouse kick!
WE SOME KIND OF 1920S FOOTBALL SQUAD?
Absolutely amazing blocking should be game LFG
"INGRAM I LOVE YOU

Roman and Harbaugh, what a play call, hats off!"
BIG BOI RUN
The hays in the barn!
We own this bitch
"For all the problems with the O-line, we‚Äôre still firing on all cylinders, and beating these Mfer‚Äôs handidly."
I love this team!
I am suddenly a wildcat fan. But only for one play
"Just when you thought this offense has done it all, 4th down wildcat for 30+ you have got to be kidding"
"let's get a 3 and out, we can basically end the game."
[deleted]
Lets gooooo D
When Deshaun has time he is absolutely surgical
Calais there showing why he is great.
Elliott has been playing great! Safeties have been refreshingly good these last two games
STOP TURTLING D
Yeah we can't play like there's 2 min left
The pressure today hasn't been bad honestly.
Geeeeeez Elliot
JOKER
Is Watson blind lol. I don't think it could've been more obvious that we were sending the house
Please eat the clock
Not to be greedy but another Lamar TD would really save my fantasy team
Gotta tighten up that coverage and pass block a bit better for KC next week. Other than that solid display of football for us.
"Down by 17:

&#x200B;

KICK A FIELD GOAL"
how are you *not* going to go for this?
How the fuck do they not show a replay? That‚Äôs absurd CBS.
That was a crazy play call
lmao i'm so glad we want to demoralize them and go for it
that scheduling does suck for houston. i agree.
Hope Houston destroys the steelers next week
Now we are just demoralizing them
Gus looks incredible right now.
"Chargers about to score a TD

They on the 3"
Damn Gus is the closer
Gus Bus is so good
"Having Gus is almost dirty, we run Ingram and Dobbins all game. Then we send in Gus against a completely wore defense."
Did anyone even see what got 90 ejected?
235-105 on the road üò≥
Cunningham has a done a good job containing Lamar. Credit where it‚Äôs due.
Running out of bounds on back to back plays.. not smart football
lamar TD here pls
in the least weird way possible deshaun watson has got some smooth skin.
Kick the fg go up 3 and let's roll it out
"If we score another td, I'm gonna be 1 point off on the lucky guess thread. That's gonna suck."
It‚Äôs crazy to think about how we haven‚Äôt lost a single game since the browns week 3... might change next week but a 15 game winning streak is insane
I love Kevin Harlan
JK Dobbins is electric!
"GET HIM DOWN

LMAOOOOO"
Yo that‚Äôs gotta be demoralizing as fuck
DOBBINS
These little flashes of JK's ability makes me hyped for how he is going to develop in this offense
Ravens have 223 rush yards. Texans held up until the 4th and then boom
We almost have 4 guys with 50yrds rushing. Wonder if thats ever happened before?
Mahomes just picked up 3rd & 20 on a RUN wtf
"Oh god, here comes the Pat Mahomes comeback"
"Settle for a tie, cowards"
"Fuck the chargers 

We‚Äôre gonna do it by ourselves"
Lamar 37 for 46 398 5tds

Our O Like is playing like shit but Lamar is so good that he‚Äôs only been sacked once
"whew i feel so much better after we didn't score a touchdown on 100% of our possessions.

lol y'all need to chill."
Is Watson covered in oil?
"The Texans player placed the ball, and then the ref kicked it backwards. I guess that means they get a free timeout to get a FG."
Meh. 10 up at the half. I'll take it
"Our O-line couldn't block a light breeze today, let alone a D-Line led by JJ Watt. What the fuck are they doing?"
GET AVARETT OUT FFS
Bro fuck this announcer saying that was a penalty but the shit on Andrews wasn‚Äôt.
God Mahomes is going to fucking expose Averett
Niggas keep trying to tell me Edwards is just a product on the offense.. dude is good
"Probably the most ""human"" I've ever seen Lamar play"
This was the weirdest blow out ever we had to try hard for it. A lot of the other ones felt effortless
The Hay is in the barn!
I know our play calling has been questionable and the o-line sucks today but shit are we spoiled with so many people complaining about not blowing out a good team
The other team is still allowed to score guys...
"Fuck this call it a tie and try again next week 

Save the knees"
Tavon can sneeze and get hurt
18 games in 4 seasons for Tavon if he's out for the season.
"Literally the same start as the Browns game. Go up 10-0, have a shitty defensive possession

Tell me what‚Äôs next?"
This offensive line is so bad
Play fluker and mekari
We need to put a big hit on Watson. We‚Äôve allowed him too much time and space to build confidence
"Kinda feel bad for the Texans right?  Schedule hard af.  KC, us, then Pittsburgh next week.  Damn"
"Not surprising they picked up that 3rd and long on Averett, get him off the god damn field"
30 to 13 but I feel like we've been playing pretty bad idk lol
"Steelers have a lot of game left, the TV will cut to our game at the start, won't they?"
Steelers really blowing this shit lmao
Broncos fucking suck
"Well, if there‚Äôs anything we learned, it‚Äôs that the Steelers defense is overrated"
"Something bad teams have in common: Not blocking obvious free rushers, haha."
Steelers almost lost to the Jeff driskel Broncos. Spooky
Hope Ingram goes off today
"Strap yourselves in, here we go."
Kevin Harlan let's gooo
Campbell just reached out and grabbed that runner.  Otherwise he was going at least several more yards.
"lol way to hold em Jimmy.

Jimmy say ‚ÄúHeeelp!!!‚Äù"
Always hated jets sweeps
Levine is just the best
"Ahh, Lamar should've probably tried that 5050 ball down the field on the right hand side."
They‚Äôre clearly scared of Watt disrupting the rushing offense
Welp there it is
Tavon looks like he‚Äôs in a lot of pain
NO TAVON
FFS we were just talking about avoiding injuries. Thankfully he seems to be ok
"Goddamnit, who put knee-breaking shit in all the fields this week?"
Tavon pls no be hurt
Meanwhile LMFAO Falcons. They are the biggest choke artists in the NFL.
Walk it off young one
I had a bad feeling the rampant injury bug that‚Äôs been hitting the league would bite us today :(
"Fucking week 2

*edit: i mean the amount of injuries around the NFL has been rough this week"
It'll buff out.
Anthony Averrett....
YAS QUEEN
Queen with the hustle
Why aren‚Äôt we even trying to run the ball?
Oline looks like ass
This o-line play is terrible
Rip tavon
At least he can walk that‚Äôs good
Hollywood could have blocked watt and was like lol no
All these injuries today has me fucking spooked for the Lamar running game
Maybe our front office will dial up some trades or something for the O-line on the level of how they re-tooled the defense mid-season last year.
We had a slow start to the Texans last year and still put up 41
Always said  O line is overrated. The reason why teams don‚Äôt get sacks on the ravens is because of Lamar
Let the Ravens gain momentum. They're just powering up
"We have 3 stellar RBs, for sure dont hand the ball off once in a quarter."
Let Lamar get a feel for what they are doing and he will adjust a bit
Okay that was impressive
"That's it, I'm getting a beer."
This is going to be a VERY fun game. Battle of crazy athletic QBs
*evade 100*
"Deshaun ""Lamar Jackson"" Watson"
That was honestly best case scenario because it could have easily turned into a horse collar.
"come on, don't be shy, slander the ravens defense some more."
Can‚Äôt give the ravens offense great field position. Getting a TD here would be huge
why do teams always try dumb ass 4th down attempts on us? hilarious
Hell yea boys. Let‚Äôs get 7.
Watson loving the jump pass
BoB is such a dunce
FUCKING HUUUUUUUUUUUGE
HELL YES DEFENSE
how idiotic lmao
That was not a good decision. Two weeks in a row teams getting too cute on us.
This game is already waaay better than the Denver Pittsburgh game.
Front 7 looks light years better
We just got the ball within Justin Tucker field goal range
It was actually a good thing that no one wanted to tackle Watson on that play
"Man, with all the speed on this offense, Boyle looks sooooo slow"
YOU OWED US THAT RICARD
"Feel better now, boys?"
Ricard!Oh yea!!
Lamar 2 td run yes
Love this drive
PATTY RICARD THANKS BOB
TOUCHDOWNNNNNN RAVENS!!!
Great play from project Pat!
Much better play calling. Lock clockwork when we on.
Thank you sweet lord baby Jesus
The Texans wanted to be us so bad by going for it on 4th down
Has Dobbins played a snap today?
"flip over to the WFT  at commercial just in time to watch Haskins get pancaked

edit: scary terry appears"
Bill O'Brien MVP
"Good shit, Ricard!"
"First td

More to come"
"Imagine using analytics and probabilities to get an edge in a football game only to see the effort benefit the other team. Congrats, you're BoB."
"I haven‚Äôt heard anything about it, so I‚Äôm assuming Clark still has the Green Dot?"
Our run D is looking decent
"Also, I do hear crowd noises pumped in. Do you guys not hear it?"
Hell of a blown coverage.
yuck
Double fuck
"If Watson had time, that was a TD."
Does anyone know what Pacific time the game is
Need the offense to come out big this drive let the defense get some light under their feet and get back on top of things
This pass rush is gonna suck so hard next week.
Tavon being out does actually hurt us
Ate a whole wedge of triple cream brie and it‚Äôs got me fucked up
Fuck Earl Thomas bum ass for costing us 15 mil this year
"Bro, Ingram takes a fucking beating when he has the ball"
"Oh my god, if Lamar starts working voice inflection into his repertoire -- that's it. Call it. The man's in total sheriff, Brady/Rodgers territory."
Lamar to Tucker is now my ultimate dream play to see recorded in a regular game scorebook officially somehow
"All I want this season, besides a super bowl, is a Tucker tuddy"
what cant tucker do
Hollywood!
"Hollywood Brown making catches like he's 6'9"""
Let‚Äôs go! Is it just me or does Hollywood always land funny when he goes up for a catch?
Fuck running he‚Äôs gonna be Lamar Rodgers from now on
Tucker for wr
Doctor my Eyes just saw a pass from Jackson to Brown.
lamar throwing way offscreen? it's going to hollywood
That was a fucking zinger to Andrews but good defense
Little too much on that throw
MARLOOOOOOOOO
"ALSO, FRUIT PUNCH!!!!!!!!!!!"
Did I just say I want a TO?  YES I DID!
MARLOOOOOOO
YAAASSSSS GIVE ME THEM TURNOVERS
"WHO IN HERE SAID WE NEEDED A TURNOVER TD, WHAT A PREDICTION!"
Humph punch!
BUILD THAT FORT AND WATCH IT STAND
Marlon üòàüòà
Humphrey is such a beast
Marlon>Jalen
He‚Äôs in come on
Texans can't be serious...
It‚Äôs not a TD!!?
The ball hit the pylon before he went out!
Oh wait we don't have to challenge because all turnovers are reviewed and they review the entire play. This review will end with us kicking a PAT
Lamar Jackson = LJ. Fort McHenry is in Baltimore. LJ Fort Illuminati confirmed?
LETTSS FOCKIN GOOOOOO!!
üî• üî• üî•
"The wink defense has nasty punches, Peanut did it all the time too"
All these great players we're going to have to pay üò≠
Went the bathroom... guess that was a mistake.
For you Ravens fans to give some context here. The WR that caught the ball does this so often. He gives us flash of hopes and then does this and now will not play for the next 4 games probably lmoa
"thank god, that def looked like a legit TD"
"I'm surprised, but I'll take it!  TD!"
Thats a touchdown!
"LET'S GOOOOOOOO RAVENS!!!

üòà"
"Houston blaming lack of energy on lack of crowd noise, pretty sure Houston would be silent regardless after that last TD"
Marcus motherfucking peters
bruh
What a catch
Holy fucking highlight reel.
I think the D heard the shit you all were talking.
MP JUICEMANE
MP JUICEMAN
MPJuiceman!!!!!!!!!!!
That's a catch by a mile
"good afternoon  Houston, the juice man is here."
OH YEAH DON'T FORGET WE HAVE A DEFENSE!
Juice man!!!
We starting to heat up!!!!
WHAT A PICK
Marcus gonna start clowning themüòÇ looks like Lamar ain‚Äôt playing in the fourth ‚òπÔ∏è
M P JUICE MAYYNNNEEEE
MP JUICEMAN
MP Juiceman! God we are so lucky to have two stud corners.
People still try to act like we don‚Äôt have 2 of the top 5 corners
MP JUICEMAN MP JUICEMAN MP JUICEMAN
Turnovers win games. Turnovers lose games. We on the right side of those TOs
GIMMIE THAT!!
 JUICE MAN JUICE MAN
YESSSSS WHAT A CATCH
LJ Fort and MP masking our oline getting manhandled and the lack of a pass rush
Td here and after the half and cruise lol
EAT
"We are fucking scary, I love it"
Bud light guy needs to brown bag that beer
Lmao they making deshaun watch the pick
We don't stop the clock for out of bounds anymore?
I love Peters so much
Gotta feel bad for Watson honestly dudes just going to end up like Andrew Luck
I fucking LOVE Peters and humphrey duo. Keep them together!!!
MP stands for Magic Powers with how he caught that o.O
"We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs 


We want the chiefs"
"Unfortunately for the Texans, they're stuck playing the Ravens on All-Madden difficulty."
"Man, OBJ is having a rough start to the season. Garret last week and now Watt"
I'm not used to seeing Stanley and Brown getting pushed like this
Well that wasn‚Äôt good
Stanley no
Fuck it.  Let Tucker try it from ther e
What the fuck o-line
O line pls
So I guess Stanley now has injuries to 3 parts of his body.
We can't lose Stanley. That could be devastating to the offense
Do we actually have an offensive line?
Ok the entire o-line needs to step up NOW without Stanley
Can Yanda start eating again - maybe he can make a comeback for week 4 or 5. Just need him to get in lineman shape
The o-line needs help. Idk why edc thought a third round rookie was gonna fill in for yanda.
Lmao an interception and the Texans are gonna score
Bullshit flag
AVERETT IS FUCKING TRASH
Again? Come on
LEARN TO TACKLE
What shit way to end the first half.
Averted shouldn‚Äôt even be on the team anymore
Rather have Levine play corner than Averette
Remember when Averett jumped over the fumble in KC and missed the ball entirely
"Our ILB is our best pass rusher, good lord"
"Shit needs to be said in the locker room, shit needs to be said"
Damn. Our o line looking like a bunch of beanbags
Huh???
WTF was that
we stayed really healthy last year. you get some soft spots exposed if guys start getting dinged up
Why did they give them time....
"Fuck off, come on"
O line needs to be addressed ASAP
fucking unreal
Actual BS but whatever
Offense is just not getting it together. Defense keeping us in this game. Let's hope oline can get it together and Lamar comes out angry in the second half to put together a TD drive.
"This O Line... Chris Jones and the Chiefs are gonna be licking their chops looking at this on game film.

We need to get this shit straight."
[deleted]
Thank fuck Lamar can throw cause the run game has gone to shit
When they stop the clock to call a penalty which ends up getting declined dont they have to impose a ten second run off?
Boykin is a tight end now I guess
Boykin's not a TE
"Lamar‚Äôs composure today >>>>

But I‚Äôd like to see him scrambling to avoid those sacks a little more. Bully them into submission"
These announcers called DeShonn Eliot a C and Boykin a TE so far
Watt is a legit superstar. His presence is felt this game.
"Gus, AKA the Bus."
"The OL isn't helping, but the playcalling has left a lot to be desired so far"
This is exactly why we should keep feeding the running backs
Our backs are the best downhill runners in the game
omg close up of Harbaugh eating his mask
FEED GUS
We had 3 lead blockers on that play and 3 players on the defense were around lamar unblocked within 3 yards.
Ray rice flashback
Need I say I'm throbbins for Dobbins?
Amazing play by dobbins staying up
I want to see a bomb to Hollywood lol
Dobbins is such a great pick
Way to go JK
Ray rice vibes
andrews almost got a hug for a td
That's a PI if the roles were reversed
Yeah the O-Line is a worry.
Dude Hollywood was wide open
pi
"Andrews wanted to moss him so bad, I would have nutted"
"i have faith in phillips, but he's just not it yet."
Phewwww. ‚ÄúStill fucking got it‚Äù
This fucking oline already
o line is booty
Tucker really scared me there
O line.... stand between the rusher and lamar pls
I miss Yanda
Thank God for Tucker
Offensive line straight dog ass
Orlando let that blitz right in untouched smh
"""STILL FUCKING GOT IT"""
Is our OL bad or is Houston‚Äôs DL good?
The Oline is lookin like Swiss cheese.
"Just seeing how close he can kick it to the upright without touching it, that's all. Totally intentional."
"These field goals are killing me. Total yards edge  and +2 turnovers, we should be up a lot more than 13."
It can‚Äôt just be the loss of Yanda. Somebody on that offensive line has regressed.
Tucker just tucking it in
Ngl I'm scared Lamar's gonna get hurt if they don't fucking block for him. Lamar getting hurt could potentially end the season
Orlando brown looked good playing next to yanda last year but now holy shit
We aren't used to winning and it not being close... In all honesty the team needs to overcome and pull through games like this. This is what sharpens our blades
I hate looking in this sub and everyone being so negative when we are up two possessions
McPhee almost blew that up
Watson just fucking go down jesus christ
LOL there were so many humans in that pile
Our front 7 is going to wreak havoc against a less athletic qb
ANTHONY AVERETT NOT ANTHONY EVERETT.
Averett. Jesus Christ. Do your job
Get Averett out of there bruh
Averett suuuucks.
averett shows up just to get fucked next play
Averett is a horrible football player
Averett is pain üò´
What ever happened to Iman Marshall? Has he been injured?
DOG PILE!
Do we have any other corners aside from Averette who could sub for him?
This drive is giving me agita!
Guess I'll take it. üòÇ This team kinda playing like butt and drain the quarter for +3.
Can someone explain to me why Bernard Pollard hates  Harbaugh? [Link](https://twitter.com/crushboy31/status/1307799103192141827?s=21)
i‚Äôm ready for one of the cb‚Äôs off the practice squad. averett has been trash since we drafted him
We jumped boo
"Prince Amukamura is a FA üòè

Yeah, he's too good to be a fourth corner though"
"Oh look, now they have a manageable 3rd down..."
Lol who laughed there
Great job D!
Good stop
Houston out here trying to throw on Humphrey. Good way to not score touchdowns.
Long TD drive please. Even a long FG drive would be nice
Still pissed off they replaced Jake from State Farm into a handsome and fit man. I miss the old one ü§ß
We need a long fucking drive like it's nobody's business.
Jackson is so entertaining to watch
Slippery like a rain drop!
she is so fine
"Slippery as a raindrop.

Poetry"
I need a HOUDINI play
"Did not know bout Andrews diabetes, huh that‚Äôs crazy"
JJ chill...plz
Jj Watt is not a human being.
Lowkey forgot how good JJ Swat is lol
LETS GO
LET'S GO!!!!!!!!!
FUCKING INGRAM!!!!!!!
I FUCKING LOVE THIS TEAM!!
What a call G Ro
The ravens are my favorite team
bruh my jaw is on the fucking floor lmao holy shit
Was that a direct snap to Ingram?
Best blocking all day! What a time for it to come!
Dagger.
BIG TRUZZZZZzzz
INGRAMMMMMM WHAT A PLAY GOD DAMN THAT WAS SEXY
2-0 baby
What did that net do to you Ingram?
"GRO is a handsome, husky genius"
YES SIRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
"What a clean run, jesus. Gotta love Ingram"
MEET ME OUTSIDE THE BANK....when we get back
"Damn, Jake from state farm buff af"
BOB so mad he took the mask off
"Still 10 mins to play, let‚Äôs get a TO"
Texans are known for having a bad oline and we have given Watson lots of time
"Watching the ravens play prevent towards the end of games always infuriates me, it‚Äôs so bad"
BLOCK THE FG PLZZ
Deshon > Desean
SACKED!
I traded Sammy Watkins to my buddy for Hollywood like 20 mins before kickoff and now Watkins is hurt holy fuck I just got that one off
Props to Faribairn for also staying clear of the illness affecting nearly all kickers this year and being pretty money for his team today
"https://twitter.com/ravens/status/1307813744194523136?s=21

Bruce Lee"
"Damn, easy on my QB fucker"
clock killing TD drive here we go
God I love football
We going.
[deleted]
Good thing the refs couldn‚Äôt see that blatant hold from Andrews üòÇ
Not a bad challenge.  Gives them a TO to go over 4th and 1.
Knee wasn‚Äôt down
Good challenge if don‚Äôt get it it‚Äôs basically a TO
He got it
how the heck didn't they spot that as a 1st lol
God we are lucky.
Yup. Houston's done.
Gus fucking ramming them
Time to load up the Gus Bus
THA WHEELS ON THA BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND
gus bus!!! ride the man!
I know these are garbage time yards but I love Edwards
Damn gus showing off
MakeüôåüèΩGusüôåüèΩbusüôåüèΩtheüôåüèΩstarterüôåüèΩ
Gus bus taking us to W street
Gus lives for the 4th quarter
Blacklock.... Dude is lucky he has an L in there
They just ejected Blacklock!
"Imagine having like 5 guys we trust to run the ball, Amazing

This fucking team guys"
"Member back in the first quarter ‚Äúomfg were gunna lose‚Äù 

R-E-L-A-X"
"Gus ""7.9 YPC"" Edwards"
Can they stop going out of bounds üòÇ
"Ok, so it was a 5 minute drive with a FG. Still works."
Wasted a minute dumbass outside runs there
Another week it feels good to be a Raven
I like the implications
pick 6 coming up
Houston sports fans all collectively gathered outside the stadium as you can hear the boos
RGIII TIME!
So who‚Äôs our player of the game? The whole team ? Felt like a collective effort
ITS RG3 time again lmao
that will just about do it yeah?
#J K ALL DAY
Oh yeah. Dobbins is gonna be nice.
JK
Holy shit JK
I‚Äôm so fucking hungry for next Monday
"Who screaming ""get down""????????"
RIDE EM DOBBINS!!
Dobbins is a great open field runner. The turf monster almost got him there but he was crazy in college
Pray that Greg Roman doesn't try and fancy it up
Lamar looks a half step slower since he bulked up. Overall probably a good thing but we may not see another Bengals type play.
#RAY RICE
Watson a bitch begging for flags like that
Hey Jk maybe block somebody
"Listen I had a really hard week, I'm gonna need you guys to chill with the doom and gloom unless we're down 20 points in the last 2 mins of the fourth."
Looks like we're feeling the loss of Yanda
SERIOUSLY. PASS DEFENSE. WAKE UP
71 was way up field on that. Is he eligible?
Poor tavon young is made of glass
Brown won on that route. Gotta give him a chance.
FRUIT PUNCH
What‚Äôs the point of having Ingram if we don‚Äôt use him. Can‚Äôt just deep ball everything
"Got the best CB duo, but also the worst CB in the league to balance it out"
WHY ADD time!! This is rigged af
.....pass interference 100%
Refs robbed us of 7 WTFFF
"# Danny Lee Jesus ""D. J."" Fluker please"
"Don‚Äôt get me wrong I love our usual offense, but this type of offense hits different"
LETS FUCKING GO BOYS AND GIRLS
Dobbins is new but he should of got that block for Lamar coulda been a 1st
Tavon just can‚Äôt stay healthy
That dude is fragile as fuck. Jesus.
Stupid drive but points
Ok the missed tackles were probably just Martindale playing 4D chess for good field position.
Anyone else think this defense could be historically good?
COMPLETE TO TUCKER!
We need to run the ball
Was that a catch?!?
Oline keeping the Texans in the game
Opening gameplay was bad this game. Texans got rocked by the chiefs run game. We came out passing. The biggest downfall of this team is game planning and play calling. Same shit happened last season
Nice to see the refs only robbed us of 4 points instead of 7
We keep scoring and have no turnovers and everyone is screaming at our offense
Should have kept Carr
"Let‚Äôs go offense, let‚Äôs put a nice drive together."
Why are we running outside the tackles right now? Running out the clock is far more important than scoring.
Run the score up
Bob paid the refs smh
damn. refs hate you guys too? must be an AFC north thing
"I know we're winning but there is plenty to improve on right now.

Lamar had an open run lane for a first but instead threw it off-target to Hollywood in the end zone. Lamar in general is accurate today but his pocket presence is off.

Line is trash. Both offense and defense.

Offensive play-calling is off-rhythm. No Dobbins. Little Andrews. Extremely poorly done chance at end of half to capitalize on Peters's pick.

We better come out with a fire under us."
If they dont go for it they‚Äôre throwing in the towel.
"I‚Äôm more worried about staying healthy that I am winning this one. I mean, I want the dub but want everyone to finish the game healthy even more. These 1pm games have been brutal with some huge injuries."
Unrelated but can someone explain the Bills hype to me? They had the easiest schedule ever last year and this year they've scraped by the Jets and are losing to the Dolphins. They're a slightly above average team at best
"Aww, Denver finding a way to screw it up"
Fucking denver
okay rsvens time to reclaim first place
"Me before the season: ""Denver with the help of talented rookies such as Jerry Jeudy and with Drew Lock as QB will be a legit contender for the playoffs!""


Me now: :/"
"Ok, can we just end this trash Pittsburgh game and get to our coverage?"
HELL YEAH CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS!
I'm so afraid of todays match and not because of the match up but because of all the injuries around the league. Like people dropping all over the place smh
I love being in the zone for the game this week and not having to jump through ten hoops to watch the game.
How are y'all watching the game? Any streaming services?
It is really good to hear Kevin Harlan
Purple and White is such a sexy combo
"in other news, herbert is starting"
Here we go
"Hey, do you guys think Mark Andrews will be a Raven long term? (To buy or not buy a jersey)"
Good 3 and out there
3 and out baby!
Imagine punting on 4th & 1.
We suck at sweeps
Let‚Äôs fucking go
Get a turnover and get that momentum going
"Alright, we can just start the game for real now"
Time to wake up guys...
"cmonnnn Tavon down, nooooo"
And hes gone again
"FUCK

At least he‚Äôs walking"
"Oh no, another injury :("
Oh Tavon :(
Fuck tavon young hurt again
"Oof, that definitely popped out slightly"
"Call Ed Reed. I know he's bored and not doing anything right now. For old times sake, Ed."
Dude if he is injured again idk how we can keep him next year
"Knee sprain? Lets hope, be strong Tavon :("
Tavon Young is injured again god fucking damnit this guy is so frustrating to root for.
Maybe tavon will be ok
"Ok. I'll admit it. Through 1 game plus a quarter, I was wrong about Queen. Dude is a stud and I can't wait to see him develop."
YAS QUEEN
QUEEN KEPT FIGHTING
">DT Brandon Williams is dressed, but backup Justin Ellis started the drive and just went out for Derek Wolfe. Something to watch. - @jonas_shaffer"
Anyway I can watch the game without getting DMCA notice? My mom got one for last weeks game and it freaked her out lol.
Where was the protection?   (I like JJ Watt except NOW)
Who remembers 2013 when we were literally ecstatic for first downs
Terrible play
That guy with cleats same color as the ball got me excited for no reason
Lol are we gonna run the ball?
"I hate the head to head flag, but how was that not a penalty?"
NICE block by boykin
"Guys we will adjust, remember last year when we played them?"
rUn ThE bAlL
Guys.  Its the first quarter.  Calm. Down.
That was a good throw
"Fuck it, throw it to Andrews every play. No one can stop him."
"lol he did not need to hurdle at all though, just go around"
The CBS broadcast is fuckin awful. We keep missing the start of plays.
Where tf is our O-Line?
Boykin again!
Looks like Boykin might have a day
Alrighty... I am scared as shit üòÇ
Big first down!
We're rolling now
Dobbins? Ingram? Gus?
The way Lamar throws is art
Well at least doubtful means it‚Äôs probally a knee sprain and he‚Äôll be back at some point.
We don‚Äôt run the ball anymore apparently
O LINE GIVE LAMAR A SECOND PLZ
Pound the rock
"I get so worried when Lamar runs lol, I feel like his mother."
Lamar i Iove you
"Roby is out there headhunting wtf, every single tackle he's going headfirst like Shazier"
Holy fuck free rusher on every play
Why is Hollywood in the backfield?
got tipped i think
Flat
"Take your points, brick by brick"
Jesus fuck
Bruh
just a nice job my deshaun. he's a more likeable big ben.
I miss Suggs
"It's one thing to get outran by Watson, but to get stiff-armed by him? Come on lol"
Ravens D  just got Lamar'd.
"Gotta be honest, that was impressive"
He's greased up with oil and butter
"Gotta get him down, but honestly that kind of pressure, no matter how experienced Watson is, has to rattle him on some level."
"Can't believe he wasn't whistled down, I think Ward let go."
Queen is the smart one and not going for the kill to make him throw it out
how tf did we let him go lmao
fuck lmao Watson is legit
Gotta stop this here
Fuck off the field fuckers
lol I love our guys but he made us look silly there.
bruh did they just call Elliot a Corner?
Any known streams for the out of towner's??
"I get Watson is slippery but damn, dude. Tackle the man! You practice against Lamar!"
Big oof
What call was that
Bob things
FUCK YEAH
Bill O'Brien gonna Bill O'Brien
D is playing their asses off. We aren't sacking but the pressure is for sure getting there. DBs doing the damn thang too
And this is when we pile on. That was a mistake.
Wasn‚Äôt Queen I don‚Äôt think
Fucking Bowser got thrown like a toddler üòÇ that is not how you get the big money extension
"What in the fuck was that call?! I mean, go Ravens, but damn. So dumb."
Wink def knew they were gonna go for it and took the timeout
Great screen play
nice set up on the screen
Lamar is throwing darts!
"Interesting to see if Dobbins gets the touch here at the 1.

edit: gus bus"
Man I thought he was gonna get there
Boyle looked so dejected that he didn‚Äôt get in
TOUCHDOWN RICARD!!
Ricard making up for last week
TOUCHDOWN RAVENS!
Cool.
JuSt RuN tHe BaLl
Solid drive Lamar throwing lasers
yoooooooooo
WHAT A CATCH DAMN SON
Thank you BOB
Richard is Dat Boi.
Damn.  Akins a big dude
"Come on, defense! Work hard to get Lamar the ball back!"
"Wake me up when the playoffs start, this scrub Watson won‚Äôt be there"
A moving pre-snap defense will typically be a good one. Add the talent in and you‚Äôve got a great defense
Whose the person out there responsible for coming up with m words to rhyme?
Where tf was Marlon running
Llama looks sad üòî
fuck
"FFS you gotta get ahead of that throw, they just got 36 yds"
Wake up D!
Come on let‚Äôs get a TO
This is bullshit
Fells is killing us.
ugh no thnk u
Okay yea that definitely should‚Äôve been an ineligible man downfield
Defense forgot how to defense
I miss Tavon already üòî
Baker belongs in a book club.
Levine out of his depth back to back. He should only be a special teams player.
Mark Andrews time
Can anyone comment on how the chiefs are looking?
was that Duvernay's first career catch?
Jackson is such a pimp
Who gets ball at halftime?
"Looks like this year Lamar is going to be much more of a passer than runner.

More practical but not going to lie I‚Äôm going to miss the nutty rushing attack."
Coaching adjustment - Lamar doesn't always have his mouth guard in when he's handing it off. Defense can easily key on that.
Hollywood!!
"Nice catch, Tuck!"
"we need some trick plays to get Tucker in at wr. 


/s odviously"
HOLLYWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
Lol Justin Tucker the legend
##HOLLYWOOD
"HOLLYWOOD.

Massive first down! We need a touchdown here."
I get the feeling they wanted Ingram as the vet to be the primary ball carrier against a Texans D line led by Watt and out for some revenge from last year.
Am I the only one noticing Mark Ingram being open asf on those fake runs where he goes short to the side????? Like why not even try that
"Fun fact, I still have to mute the TV when JT kicks. I know he‚Äôs Mr. Automatic, but I‚Äôm still scarred for life from Hauschka (sp?) and Cundiff"
"lol, Fox for Cards-WFT just called Watson vs Jackson an NFC showdown."
"I don‚Äôt understand why Dobbins hasn‚Äôt been in more, he looked good last week. I hope they get him involved in the second half"
Fuck I love Marlon he‚Äôs always forcing fumbles
Harbs had the red flag in his hand. Challenge coming up?
OH LORT LJ FORT
#FRUIT PUNCH
MARLON HUMPREY PERFECTED THE PEANUT PUNCH
Of course it was Humphrey who punched it out!!
Punch Master Marlo
Hold that ball tight when Humphrey is around!!
Looked like he got in
HOLY SHIT!!!!???!!!
Snowball is about to get extra snacks tonight!!!!
"Aaaaand. HE'S SHORT BY A YARD! Damn, Kevin"
Whats under review?  To see if its a touchdown?
Td
Yo that Wendy‚Äôs pretzel burger looks sus
Can someone explain the fruit punch to me apparently I missed a meme
BLANKET FORT
Ok everyone take a breath now. We got this.
More good news: Chiefs are getting cooked by Justin Herbert
üíúüñ§üíúüñ§
building the fort in the end zone
We‚Äôre taking no prisoners
"I‚Äôm glad that we‚Äôre getting the train going, but can we just appreciate that it wasn‚Äôt Dan Fouts that was officiating when this happened?"
Buy Von Miller for the low EDC
We gotta knock Watson on his ass
Charles Tillman looks at Humph highlights and probably smiles
Fucking Peters.
YOOO

#MP JUICEMANNNNNNN
MP JUICEMAN
**MP JUICE MAN**
YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAHHHH!
MP FUCKING JUICEMAN!!!!
My god is that clean!?!?!?!
WHAT A PICK
ODELL IN SHAMBLES JUST GOT SHIVERS DOWN HIS DANG SPINE.
The defense has finally woken up haha
I might cry guys
Y'all thirsty? Have a damn JUICE BOX!
Get that sorry offense off the field!
What a fucking catch by MP juice man! Most receivers couldn‚Äôt make that catch
Ravens need to PAY Lamar.
That. Was. Incredible.
Marcus Peters is a fucking hawk
What a pick!!!!
Holy shit
I wanna see hollywood in open space more
STUNTIN ON THESE HOES
MP JUICEMAN!!! LET'S GO OUT THERE AND GET A TD BEFORE THE HALF
Woooooo
WHAT A FUCKING PICK
PICK 6 SHAWTY!!
Our defense may not be our all time best but it is fun as fuck
Score here then get the ball first in the 2nd half.
Watson tried to break that tablet
MP JUICE MAN
PETERSSSSSS
Hey Deshaun! We ain‚Äôt the fucking Chiefs! You ain‚Äôt throwing that shit easy on us!
Watt's just damn good.
Too many sacks smh
I know it's JJ but OBJ is getting burned.
QB1 is pissed at that line
"J.J. Watt is great when healthy, Lamar Jackson is not bad for a runningback.... tell me something I didnt know."
Orlando Brown is getting bullied
"Where is Jackson's protection? Dang, JJ Watt is good.  And handsome."
JJ Watt is good relax guys
AGAIN! WTF
"Fuck I'm filthy with our oline. Weak, weak, weak."
My god this oline lmao
I'm cri
At least we get the ball back at half
Man our OL is struggling today
"LMAO pathetic protection.

Gotta call faster routes if they can't protect Lamar better than this."
Please stay healthy
Greg Roman forgot his specialty is running the ball.
They are pinning their ears back. Need to call a screen pass or draw to ease that pressure
FUCKING FINALLY
"it's okay to miss watson once, he's crazy slippery. just stay on him."
"if the oline showed up today, we'd be up like 30"
Where's Jimmy Smith? I hate having Averett out there
"The O-Line has been atrocious, but god bless Lamar and understanding that he can‚Äôt give the ball away."
"DEFENSIVE

ROOKIE

OF

THE

YEAR"
Bruh how we about to let Watson do this and get momentum going into half.
Averett more like ayy catch it
Anthony come on man
Very nice sack
"Get Averett outta there, dude is a liability"
Please let that flag be on Houston
"They're blitzing every play, just start calling screens until they soften up"
averett is not very good man
You would never guess Averett is a former Alabama DB by looking at his play in the NFL
What the ever loving fuck was that bullshit
"So....it's still 20-7. Right?

üòë"
"Damn, only up 10 with a fumble return td and pick."
Put in Mekari or somebody on the line we need some stability there
"We made good adjustments at the half last week, let‚Äôs hope we do here."
Why we passing so much? Where's the run game?
"Up 10 at the half despite a shakey Oline/Run game play, and we get the ball back? All is good"
Definitely too much passing in the first half as well. We got 3 good backs gotta get them involved.
Fuck off refs
Refball
Wtf was that call?
Can't show the replay because nothing happened
Did they start pumping in crowd noise this half
"Today, our kicker became a WR and one of our WRs became a TE"
Gus Bus!
BEEP BEEP IT'S THE BUS
The Gus Bus has NO brakes!
Y‚Äôall weren‚Äôt ready for the BUS
So whats going on with Dobbins? Doghouse? Injury in Pregame? He had gotten 0 touches
Best this century üòé
We finally seem to be getting the running game going
DOBBINS
Holy Ray Rice Deja vu
i see ray rice
THERE'S DOBBINS
"Way to get us a first down, Dobbins!"
He looks so much like Rice
Dobbins is special yall
He wasn‚Äôt even looking at the ball
dobbins using that rice arm
Just had a realization about our time of possession on this drive. Unreal.
It's nice having ray rice back
"This drive has officially taken half the quarter.

Let's end it right, boys."
OL....geez man.
Jesus Christ line
Philips is killing us at RG
No PI??
Oof that was close
HOLY SHIT TUCKER. GOT ME WORRIED
I get we are up but this o line is really sad today
"Nailed It!  

&#x200B;

47-Yd Field Goal for Tucker"
Man what is up with our o line!?!
Tucker playing with us lol
Phillips is fucking shit
Oline is worse than dogshit
Bozeman is our best lineman at the moment (Stanley a close second) and that makes me suuuuper nervous
Lamar needs to throw it to the check down  . It might be a difficult throw but it‚Äôs the only option
cmon defense step up and get the ball back!
fuck yes
"Brought the house, and it fell on Watson like the Wicked Witch."
"B-Will getting pressure, I see you big boy!"
Bowser has been amazing so far
Watson is so good jesus
That was a good throw.
Averett sucks
WHAT THE FUCK
We can‚Äôt do better than Averett?  God damn that mother fucker sucks
Oof. Amazing pressure. But Averett not quite there.
That was a fucking beautiful pass
I‚Äôm so sad about Tavon
Lol
Has Hump even allowed a completion?
"Line needs to get better at picking up their assignments.

I know yanda is gone but this has been an inexcusable amount of missed blitzers."
Can Watson not set his feet and throw anymore? He does that high-school jump pass even when there's no pressure lol
"I know we have a 10 pt lead but it just doesn't feel like it bc we can barely stop the pass and the o line can't pass block to save their lives. And before you ask - no, I'm not a bandwagon fan from last year."
We need a touchdown
Houston‚Äôs wr corps is all-in on blazing fast #2‚Äôs lol
Get 6 sirs
Points or bust on this drive
Any news on Tavon?
"If you ignore the fact we are up and only look at the bad plays, we are playing god awful. /s"
Own td game over
Is there a way we can run the clock for 14:10?
SNEAD!!
NEED4SNEAD
GOOD JOB SNEAD
Nice to see the Ravens having multiple receivers with decent hands
remember that flacco era game where jj watt basically singlehandedly destroyed us? i can't remember the specific year.
"Man, JJ Watt has been an absolute beast today"
i really don‚Äôt care for plays to ricard
GO FOR IT!!!
Going through his reads.
Get em!
go for it
Hell yeah coach let‚Äôs go for it
WHAT A CALL!!!!!!!!!
#INGRAM YASSSSS
"LETS GOO

I have no idea what happened on that play BUT LETS GO"
NUT
G for it
BIG BOI
HOLY FUCK LETS FUCKING GO!!!
4 and 1 TD Letsss Goooo
Oh FUCK YEA!!!
Line did their job there nicely
"BIG BOY

BIG FUCKIN TRUSS
Wow.  I'm going to need to see that a few more times.
BIG BOI NO LIL BOI
BIG TRUZZZZ
W I L D C A T
YEEAH BABYYY

MARK INGRAM 4TH DOWN TOUCHDOWN!!! LET'S FUCKING GOO
Little shot of our boy Hill there.
OH HELL YEAH!!!!
Fuck yeah boys and girls!
Dick hard
LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!
This fuckin team man. Man United and the Thunder suck right now but the Ravens are giving me LIFE
Chiefs about to drop an **L**
There goes our offense big truss wooo wooooo
Not sure I‚Äôve ever seen a play blocked that well.
Thank you thank you thank you
Anyone just see that dropped pass in the KC game? Lol
Clay Matthews had 8 sacks and is still a FA @EDC
I feel like there‚Äôs a decent amount of holding not getting called
THATS WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT
Another sack!!!
Theres the sack
JOKER
JOKER SZN
There we go DeShon!!
Finally starting to feel good about this game (Pls football god don't jinx us)
Let's eat some clock.
"Lol, KC is not taking that L."
Boyle gives up on blocks so fast
Amazing tackle stopped a touchdown
What a freaking tackle. I thought he was gone.
Jackson had the whole outside and ran straight into the defender
Kinda disappointed that we didn't take that to the house lmao.
"Well, at least we're still terrible when it comes to challenges."
Yo again I ask where can I get that neck gaiter Harbaugh is wearing?
Good win obv but you gotta feel bad for the wasted talent in Houston
"Fake punt.  Sam Koch TD pass.  

I'll buy a Koch jersey immediately."
I feel like Stanley not having a good game....is this true?
Gus Bus is sneaky big
"I gotta say, Edwards looks a heck of a lot more explosive than Ingram so far this year."
GUS THE BUS
I heard Gus was once called the Bus.
Damn Gus Bus is fucking doing it today
Gus is going to get paid next year.
Gus Bus> Jerome Bettis
THE BUS LOST ITS BRAKES
RUN UP THE SCORE ON THEM
"you know what's an improvement, last season lamar had trouble keeping an eye on the play clock, but this year, he seems to be in complete control."
Boze on that play tho üò≥
Gus is so damn talented. I hope we don‚Äôt trade him
These timeouts.... yikes
Lets see JK run it down their throat!
"Still think Gus should be our 1. I love Ingram, but Gus is my man."
Jk in the doghouse for something. What he do?
Chargers up 3
Lets get Lamar another passing TD
lamar jackson TD coming up
running out of bounds Lamar?  hmm.
"Also I was thinking this earlier, I don‚Äôt think JK quite knows the playbook yet and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs not playing as much. But I‚Äôm just guessing"
Props to the texans LB‚Äôs they‚Äôve been keeping up with lamar for the most part.
Why we extending the game lol run up the middle lol
"This was a gutsy win, but our blocks were so low-effort"
Today was a good day to have Tucker on your Fantasy team.
Rg3 time?
Anyone else just get a big ass smile looking at Lamar on the sideline?
GG GUYS LETS GOOO
Remember when people in here were just saying how our defensive pressure is awful?
Dayum
Lol we really out here adding insult to injury like this? üòÇ
"43 yards from 3rd string rb, yes please!"
glad we came out of this game with a W and mostly healthy.
This is tough for Houston. They haven't looked that bad these last two weeks but they seem like they have no heart left. Two games back in the division already too.
oof not gonna be able to physically watch the game next week gonna have to listen on 98 rock dont have ESPN anymore
LET'S GOOOO 2-0
lol game over!
Chargers/Chiefs likely going to OT (if the Chiefs don't win outright).
Can we make sad Texans a new meme?
LOL he really called a punt there huh
The crowd noise in this LA game is annoying. Like an annoying constant buzz
Our oline is straight trash
If Lamar made that pass his haters wouldn't shut up ü§£
Tavon injured? What else is new.
We aren't playing particularly well today. Guess I'm spoilt by our great play in the Lamar era.
"Laughably bad play calling here.  Yes, our line is bad and will offer no protection, so why aren't we dialing up a short pass or a draw?"
Dobbins needs to block
"Another day, another Tavon on IR"
Whelp there goes Tayvon Young
I'm pretty sure Tavon just ended his career. I really hope I'm wrong.
Holy shit we look like ass today.  Andrews is the only consistent player
Lamar is carrying us rn lol goodness
Is the field super shitty? Lamar keeps slipping.
"I know deshaun is good, but you have to get a sack there. Embarrassing"
Lmao tucker!!!
Tucker is a new WR
Put tucker at WR!
‚ÄúJudon is getting close though‚Äù -someone who told me Clowney sucks cause he doesn‚Äôt get sacks
Now our OBJ is acting like a homegirl.
Time for Fluker at RG
The next Texans completetion raven's reddit is going to call for Bisciotti to sell the team
Amazing how these announcers really forget about the person who got this mobile QB trend started with Cam.
Do not go for it if we don‚Äôt get it.
Miles Boykin is such a good blocker
‚ÄúBest in the league‚Äù???
Averett is fucking trash. What the fuck was that
Tavon‚Äôs just going to be one of those guys isn‚Äôt he? Fuck.
Can we trade for JJ Watt at halftime?
Online is having a hard time yes but it seems lamar is picking the wrong of the two holes every single time which is extremely uncommon.  Though no real blame on him considering he usually Always picks the right hole.
"Didn't get promoted?? BUY A CAR!! 

WE DEFINITELY CARE ABOUT WOMEN AMIRITE FELLAS?"
Well that was flat
Come-on rookie! you got to make that block
"First drive - Lamar scrambled during a 3 man rush. He usually stays patient at that point. 

2nd down play reminded me of the bills game."
Come on Matt. Gotta make that play.
Tavon is made of fucking glass man..
Every fucking year. Poor guy
Mahomes playing like shit today.
Mahomes is 2/8 for 14 yards after 1 quarter? I mean they'll almost certainly still win but that is pretty wild.
"The Texans are going to gain some yardage but make no mistake, there is absolutely nothing there for them right now anywhere on the field. This is some vintage ravens defense so far."
TUCKER
Damn. First bad pass from Lamar.
Seriously.  Fuck this week.
Fuck our o-line is terrible
Extremely lucky to be up by 13 now
Temper tantrum!
"Well, just make the ref fumble and they‚Äôll add time for you"
"The defense ended the half with a penalty filled choke job, think the same thing happened last week but we escaped without giving up anything"
I‚Äôve seen a lot of BS officiating in my life but giving time back to the opposing team so that they have enough time for a fg? That‚Äôs beyond ridiculous
Dude was open.
Shit coverage by Queen
Why the hell was Queen playing at corner?
Was nervously waiting for a flag there on Marlon
"I never watch broadcast TV except during football season.  Damn, these commercials suck.  Even worse during an election year."
Imma need Mandrews to go off these next 7 minutes to hel my fantasy team
That was so risky
##Put Gus Edwards in the Ring of Honor
"Props to the Oline, they're winning the battle when they know what's coming."
"There's no reason for Lamar to carry, let alone go out of bounds there."
Take 3.
Run up the score plz
Ferguson can‚Äôt even get off a running back bro
imma be honest... don‚Äôt flame me fellas... I think Baker‚Äôs commercials are funny.
This play calling is trash
"Honestly. It's not ""spoiled"" or ""annoying"" for wanting to have the team mix up the plays. Use the running backs we have. They can help"
Mahomes will eat this secondary alive. We're going to have to blitz 6 the whole game.
Broncos üëÄ
Please broncos üëÄ
steelers bout to lose to a back jeff driskel
I really hope this game finishes before our game starts
At least theres no way for this game to go into OT
Still not over
will the Steelers play against real football teams this year besides us?
Man this game sucks I can't wait for Lamar to put 60 on the Steelers. FTS.
Broncos choking again ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Fuck
"Every time I see a score that shows the underdog making a game interesting, literally within two minutes of me turning the game on, they fucking tank and do something stupid."
Had to switch over to the Washington game. Really can‚Äôt sit through this Steelers game until ours starts
Ravens game day boys. Let‚Äôs go!!
Damn Steelers always getting lucky against awful teams.
I‚Äôm watching Sunday ticket. Where‚Äôs the game?
Oh yes Harlan is commentating Im so happy
Texans won and elected to receive- they know if they give the ball to Lamar to start they‚Äôve got no chance.
All the homies LOVE Kevin Harlan
We are off
LETS GO
BOW SHIT !!! HOL UP ! MOVIE
did CBS fuck up and not show us the first 2 plays
Nice 3 and out to start D.
PUNT
3 and out!
HELL YEA JIMMY
Smith did his job there.  Nice.
Nicely done Defense!
Harrison is already starting? Wow thats crazy!
I love it when teams receive first
"R A V E N S 

RAVENS!!!"
"whats up my dudes, couldn't watch last week so this is my kickoff today

and to make it all better, it's kevin harlan on the call

lets fucking go!!!"
F***
LET'S GO D
No tavon
Jesus christ man
"Tavon again, oh no."
Oh God no Tavon
Welp
Tavon pls
Goddammit tavon
thats not ideal
Oooph bad landing
FUCK
üôÉüôÉüôÉ
FUCK
"That did not look good - gotta feel for Tavon man. Second year in a row. What a terrible day for injuries, but not a good way to start."
What even happened there?
what a surprise
Hopefully it's just a knee sprain
The falcons are having the hardest 28-3 flashbacks right now
"Fuck man, was so excited to see him play this year w/ MP and marlo"
Id rather see Jimmy outside now and Marlon in the slot
watson does have good escapability. that was nice pursuit.
"Good pressure there, and nice play by Queen"
Good DEFENSE!
Good job D
PUNT
LFG
Finally they got him down
"Not a sack, but I'll take pressures all day, everyday."
Hope my dude Young is good. Wearing his jersey that I never wear too much and of course :(
Ok shake off the last drive and get some momentum here
I like how we've already touched the qb more than we did last week.
Come on guys  you need to have faith. Have faith in my bobby
Let's fucking do something now
Ditched my wife making Halloween decorations to watch the game.  Im in trouble.  But don't care
Watt is just good.
What the fuck offense??
78 you awake??
Run the ducking ball
\#FFS WE GOTTA PROTECT LAMAR
MANdrews
MANDREWS!
JJ is gonna be disruptive lol
Andrews there we go!
"Nice, but no need for the hurtle there, Mandrews."
Helmet to helmet
handrews do be looking like white drake.
Those first few offensive plays were an hommage to our pre-Lamar days
Gotta love how the Texans PA people accidentally made the fake crowd cheer during a big play for the Ravens haha
Literally zero runs lol
Have we ran the ball at all yet????
The o line is looking like an issue early
Big boy Boykin.
Good play Boykin
God the people in this fucking game thread man. You would think we would be down 21 by the way people are talking
Hell yea Myles
Offensive line needs to wake up
Let‚Äôs go Miles!
Run. The. Bal..
Yes Boykin nice slant
How bout our runningbacks take some carries...
Has anyone seen our o line?
"The o-line looks awful, what's going on?"
There he is!!
Now this looks like the ravens offense
Is stunting happening?!
Oof that injury report does not sound good
We rollin now boys. Don't forget the Texans are still a good team
Is Tavon done for the year again? That would be devastating for him
They aint running the ball cause our interior line had some trouble against Cleveland Last week. How ya'll think they will do better against the Texans d-line who is 10x better than Cleveland
>Ravens cornerback Tavon Young (knee) doubtful to return - @AaronWilson_NFL
Damn it.  Need Young
lamar's doing a good job avoiding injuries so far
O-line has been hot shit. Lamar keeping the drive alive every play
Both tackles seem confused
Nice route by Boykin.
Lamar such an escape artist
"Finally seems like the O is getting a rhythm, but it'd be nice to get the backs involved."
What a run
"Shame Lamar got caught there, they faked out Watt real good"
"I like the 3. Definitely wanna see more running plays to our RBs though. Can't complain about the drive though, D is holding it tf down"
Both defenses came to play today
TACKLE!! And damn Watson is strong.
Damn dude I hate those plays lol
"Dang, is DS greased up??"
PUNT!
Sneaky Watson
Credit to our secondary for holding it down through that 3rd down
Are you serious Ward?
We have to finish these tackles guys.
Sack that MF goddamnit!!
Bruh the play clock was on 2 just let it run out
Watson is really good at breaking tackles
Watson just too strong?? lol
So this is what other teams feel
FUCK YEAH
Want that face covering Harbs has. Anyone know if it's for sale?
#DEFENSE
Thank you very much
Horrible call by Texans
LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!
thats embarrassing
AW YISS. MOTHER.FUCKING. ##PRESSURE
Queeeeeeen
Lmaooooo
LFG
GET YOUR FUCKING WEAK SHIT OUTTA HERE!!!
Let‚Äôs get a TD here
RECEP-BACK
Oh yeah I like that
Ingram took a hell of a shot and didnt even flinch.
Haven't seen a screen in years
"Goes for it on 4th down in their own territory and doesn't get the first...

*The connection to your peer has been lost.*"
Reminder. We were only up by one score at the end of the first quarter of last year‚Äôs Texans game. Then we feasted.
Wasn't our score something like this after q1 against Texans last year?
"That was... a strange move by BoB. No fans, low energy, 3-0 game. You just manufactured energy for the Ravens, man! üòÇ"
Dunn is a big boy
Bozeman block was fire
Bob is glad he has a mask on to hide his red ass face rn
i have it on good authority that greg roman read all of your complaints. tyfys
##yasss screen
Boyle just can't buy a TD
Omg Boyle almost!
I thought that's was 6 for sure
I'll fucking take it
Gotta lead him just little more Llama lol
WE JIVIN NOW
"I‚Äôm happy to see Hayden succeed today, but we‚Äôre still good without him"
TOUCHDOWNNNNNNNN
Good Work patty
üòçüòçüòçüòç
I‚Äôll take it lol
Nice job ric
Juiceman pick 6 plz
RECEP-BACK!
"I say Texans, you say fuck em, Texans"
What's the rule again for blocking kicks? Seemed like a lot of Texans lined up on one side.
Anyone from AZ know why our CBS isn‚Äôt showing games today?   It‚Äôs three hours of paid programming in place of the game lol
"Come on, D!"
Pass rush needed desperately
Seeing lineman just standing around as a play ends give me war flashbacks to middle school and I love it
Fuck
oof. Marlon abandoned the TE. was he expecting help?
who's man
"Double, awful yuck"
SMH
Fuck
Alright. Get one back
"Ok 

Let‚Äôs go"
It's really disappointing that Ferguson or Bowser aren't starters at DE/OLB yet. We need a serious upgrade in those positions.
ibm WATSON hahahahahaha
"Need a touchdown drive here.

Texans are a good team, Watt is back and we're in their house after blowing them out in ours last time."
"Marlon tried to pull a Peters and jump the outside route, ended up handing Fells a first down"
Levine showing why he stays on special teams still after this whole time
Lamar is sharp
Duvernay!
Lamar's throws just look so much more crisp this year.
DUUUUUUUUUU
DUV
Love Devin
Beautiful throw.
Where‚Äôs JK
How come our fake hand offs look a lot more fake this season...?
Interesting that we're not trusting them deep yet.
Yeah man it‚Äôs not as easy for us to run to the right without yanda.
Jk time
Lol Tuck
I fucking love this team
HOLLYWOOOD
HOLLYWOOD!
That's an easy 26 yards
Hollywood always seems so close to turning those jets on
Holly
üé•üé•üé•
Tucker is automatic
I‚Äôll take those points thank you very much
I wish we were running as much as we were play action(ing)
"Now this might be hard for you all to understand, but JK might not be a good matchup against this d line. Also, he'll be much fresher later when the d is tired"
YESS I STARTED DST
I JUST CREAMED
Just when y‚Äôall were losing truss
Hell yeah. Let's punch this one in!
I think he's in
Humphrey the Hammer
I liked that.
That fucking punch
Marlo is that motherfucker
Thanks for the ball Houston
FRUIT PUNCH!
HUMPS GOT THAT PEANUT PUNCH IN HIS BAG!!!!
"LETS GOOOOO. Also, how the hell did they miss that hold on Judon??"
LJ FORT
Oh come on ref give him that td!
That‚Äôs a TD baby!
LETSSS FUCKKIIIINN GOOOO
HELL YEAH!! I‚ÄôM WEARING MY HUMPHREY JERSEY TODAY TOO!
Fuck yea
ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME
Fort TD lets go Fort!!!
Let's go!!!!
Wow I didn't realize Fort fumbled that after the score. Almost pulled a Mosley
Hollywood was gonna let Deshaun eat shit into the bench lmao
HOLY SHIT MP JUICEMANNNN
What a grab by Peters!!
FUCKING PETERS!!!!!!
great catch
That shit was beautiful
What an INT!!
HOLY SHIT that pick
WHAT A FUCKING CATCH
You love to see it!
that was a beautiful catch by Peters
 Peters!!!
That was an incredible dive!
MP JUICE MAN!!!!!!!
I love our secondary :'-)
MP JUICE MAN!
Now we gotta game goin
Announcer should know it doesn‚Äôt matter if it touches the ground as long as he‚Äôs in control of it when it does
Fuck he could have been a wr lol
LET'S FUCKING GO!!!!!!!!
I‚Äôm just picking up on it
What's up with the lack of deep play attempts? Is it because of the amount of pressure Lamar is under?
Can we get some fucking protection for Lamar? Please?
"Jimmy‚Äôs turn, please?"
"Watts still got it, dang"
F***
Can we actually protect Lamar?????
Watson looks like he wants to end it all lmao
Why aren't we running the ball?
We're making the plays but the Texans are manhandling some guys out there. A lot more physical.
Fuck
Rare bad play
He looks OK
Holy shit... bad goes to worse.
Not stanley...again.
Please be okay Stanley. We need you
No reason to call such a play on offense. You know our o line can‚Äôt hang on for more than a few seconds so there‚Äôs very little chance our WRs can run a longer route. Need quick hits not long slow developing pass plays come on
Stanley doesn‚Äôt look too distraught
Alright defense no points let‚Äôs go to the half
Roman needs to play all to their strengths. Gun the whole game.
Wouldn‚Äôt a pick 6 be fun here?
Terribly managed drive there. That was a chance to really put the Texans up against it.
Such a weird game
Anyone got any O-Line players for a 5th rounder?
This new overly pass happy play calling along with our struggling OL is really pissing me off now
"Oh, yeah we can get sacks too, baby!"
Shocked that we were actually able to tackle watson there
There's the sack we needed!
QUEEN
Bowser deserves a contract extension over Judon so far
I got excited for a sack but nvvm
"Judon needs to break down and tackle, he keeps diving and wiffing"
Bs call
QUEEEEEEEEN
Averette is bbq chicken
Ofc a convenient penalty
Can we fucking tackle? Jesus Christ
Defense shitting the bed now...
Home game clock operator is friendly
Nice referee escort on this drive
"Okay, ref. What are you seeing? üòÇ"
What‚Äôs the noise I hear in the broadcast?  I thought they weren‚Äôt pumping crowd noise at the stadium.
"Put Jimmy on the outside man, this is why we signed him"
"We just rushed 2, wtf?"
We need to chill tf out
What in tarnation
We adjust and get the ball back next half. We're still up two scores people
"As long as the line play is cleaned up next half, we should be fine"
"6 point swing cause of that sack. Oh well, still in good position."
This is defensive battle imo neither of our lines are holding up.
Chest pain? WTF is that lol
"Not apart of the local market and the CBS game for my area is the chiefs game. Fuck me I guess. 

How is the game so far"
What is pollards beef?
"Damn, that Washington/Cardinals game is speeding! They're already 5 minutes into the 3rd quarter."
We knew oline would not be the same without Yanda
Stanley is hurt and looks like it and Brown jr. Is getting embarrassed by Watt. We need to do something.
omg bullshit flag
üôÑ
great job Boykin
Boykin TE?
"""Boykin the tight end"""
Wait Boykin is a tight end?
boykin just chilling where he needed to inbetween
Did Boykin play TE in college?
There is a reason they keep calling pass. They aren‚Äôt able to get enough push on Oline.
GUS BUS!
Where is Dobbins?
Nice run gus
Let‚Äôs get the Bus chugging baby
THA WHEELS ON THA BUS GO ROUND AND ROUND
THE GUS BUS ROLLS
Da busss
Love Boykin ‚ù§Ô∏èüò©
GUS BUS let's get that run game going!
Lamar has been deadly with his voice today
Now we running
Dobbins might not be a strong blocker yet
Keep Gus in over Mark rn if we‚Äôre just gonna act like JK doesn‚Äôt exist lol
"Gus is a beast for bit DLs.

Even if JK is an everydown back I love rotating power and speed backs"
I love Seeing Gus getting physical
JK!!!
That was some terrible blocking lol
JK!!
JK Rolling
Dobbins you fucking stallion.
I like that Dobbins
Love that second effort by dobbins
"Dobbins giving me Ray Rice flashbacks

Get JK'D"
Looked like Ray rice
Dobbins has received a target from his coach. Dobbins is a free RB!
AMAZING PLAY BY DOBBINS
Dobbins fresh in the second half.  Let's get it
jk had has  the hand like ray
"Orlando Brown, I love you man but you are getting eaten alive against Watt today..."
Fucking oline
**UGH O-LINE**
Obj is getting worked.
"I want to see an option play with Llama, Dobbins, BUS, Ingram, and (fuck it, why not) RG3."
Can our OL block?
"Where is our o-line today? Texans D is not good, yet we are getting manhandled"
Really not liking our O-line play
Kinda fucked up that you can‚Äôt challenge a no-call
"Damn, you could see the shadow of the ball on the goal post as it passed. Hard to get closer than that without hitting. Still the GOAT"
"Man I miss Yanda. His presence made the two guys next to him better, and it's showing these first two games."
Dont think Phillips was as ready as Harbs thought he was. Skura is playing slightly scared it looks like which is to be expected coming off such a serious injury. Bozemen has held up decently though.
Start Fluker and start Dobbins.
Lamar ran straight into that sack. Phillips picked up the stunt pretty well tbh. Still unsure about him  but that one wasn't a miss
Come on D make a play! We need yall
Eww Ray look creepy af in that pic lol
13 pt lead not bad
Come on defense tighten up
there we go
nice!!
BIG BABY
That tackle holy cow
Nice tackle Averette!
"Thank god we sacked him, Cooks was wide open"
SACK
"Yeah, both of these o-lines are trash today"
23 powned
What the hell did Watson do to piss off his own Center this much?
Jesus Christ deshaun is a beast.
How
That was a great play god damn
Nvm lol
How did that throw arrive?
Come on man
I thought that one was PI
This ad is worse than The Champ is Here. Very 2020
"We need to rally back on offense next drive. Go down field, take time off and score a TD. Field goals will win it but we want to win with confidence!"
Stills smiling at humphrey like he even came close to catching it
Need a stop here. Defense needs to show some fire.
Goddamn it Calais
Nice hold
"We drained 15 minutes of game and kept the margin 10.

I consider this an absolute win."
Noice
This is the way.
"Run the ball, convert with Mandrews on third. Get it done! Letssssss gooooooo!!"
"That, right there, helping up the opponent, is what makes Lamar Jackson an awesome human."
Willie pinballing through the D
SNEEAAAAD
Slippery as a rain drop!
Watt is definitely showing up today
I'm so conflicted. These are two great plays but they are moving down the field faster than my fatass when it's meal time
I want 2 td passes by lamar
Gus is freaking unstoppable
Fuck it go for it
Damn I wish we had a big physical WR like Boldin used to be.
OMG YES
Mark ingram or Lamar jackson? I can't tell
"And this, too, is the way."
BOOM!!!
INGRAM!!!!!
WHAT A PLAY CALL!!!
Let‚Äôs goooooooo. Dagger!
Let's fucking gooooo
God I love Mark Ingram!
NO LIO BOI
FUCK YEAH!
I was questioning not getting 3 there but lol @ me.  That was awesome.
30 YARDZ BABY!  Biggg TRUZZZZZZ
THATS BALL GAME BIG BOI!
Mark Mf Ingram!!
HAHAHA FUCK YES INGRAM STILL GOT IT
**INGRAM**
YESSIR
LMAOOOOOOO
Drink to that my brothers!! We can relax now
"What a call, thank the football gods it worked or it wouldve been a terrible call. Am I right boys?"
DER D
Holy shit one of our lineman got their ass handed to them on that last play.
"Make em work for it D, nothing fast"
Ughhhhhh.... this what yall dont need
Is it me or is Ward getting no push on that left side?
Elliot is the enforcer out there.
Cmon defense game ain‚Äôt over yet
Not sure if Texans looking good on offense or our defense not on point
I hate this prevent d we're playing
That was actually a really good route by Cobb
Is tht a humphrey sack?
Gotcha!
Deshon szn
I‚Äôm glad we‚Äôre getting to play a game this physical and seemingly close. Defense needs to fight through the rest of this quarter.
LET'S GET THAT SCORE. GO RAVENS
I really enjoyed the Ingram TD with Lamar at WR and a RB at QB
"Ah, here comes the Pat Mahomes comeback"
I need some GUS in the 4th quarter.
[deleted]
How is Mahomes so good
Chiefs looking at our game so they gotta come back lol
Great stuff. That Ingram run was chef‚Äôs kiss
That would have been six if it wasn't for that tackle.
is Jah Reid available?
Damn Mahomes that was a crazy pass
Just no reason for designed Lamar runs in the fourth quarter up 14.
That's a FIRST! WTF REFS!!!
Go for it!
"saved the touchdown

daaamn"
Fuckin Mark needs to finish that block
Send it
Seriously
Big truss here on this call.
I haven't been watching but I assume Herbert's been balling
"If it ends up being short, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to go for it even though we‚Äôve been very successful in the past."
Let‚Äôs go for it coach!
Challenges make me anxious
Ez
Was that ball game?
WFT coming back a little~
Gus is so fucking good
This dudes got balls the size of Texas
KC roughs the passer on a 3rd down play where it was an incomplete pass
Wind that clock!
is Ingram not fit to play?
They have hardly played Dobbins today
Guys the Bus!!!
Boykin blocking downfield is awesome. Kid is the unsung hero of this run game.
GUS BUS
Gus for MVP
"chill edwards, i can only get so hard"
"fuck it let's see a strike into the endzone here, Brown or Andrews"
Ejection!
Was that #90s second ?
Did the Chargers bench Tyrod for Herbert?
"Gimmie another Lamar TD for fantasy purposes. Would prefer rushing but will settle for passing, I'm not fussy!"
Somebody stay in bounds
Buried
CHUCK
"Ugh, that's Kevin Harlin. He's totally obsessed with me üòè"
"Fuck it -- play action Lamar to Hollywood touchdown!

.../s. Kind of."
Texans quit on themselves
somehow chargers let Mahomes scramble for 21 when they needed 20.
GOOD JOB TEAM
Tavon Young likely out for season...
Few bad plays and we trash again. GTFO fake ass fans.
O-Line needs to get their shit together man. We should be up 27 or 23-7.
"Guys, it‚Äôs one bad drive. Reeeelax"
And Tavon might have torn his ACL again.   Another sacrifice to this Bloody Sunday in the NFL.
Not sure why we‚Äôve completely abandoned the run. Ingram and Dobbins just not getting any touches on two drives already
Trash ass offensive line
Blatant fixing by the refs there.
RGIII has the best smile
I don‚Äôt think people realise how good Texans D is. We can‚Äôt be super human all the time.
I told you guys o-line was gonna struggle. Those of you who downvoted me owe me money.
Just bench Lamar too risky to play him this week. Everyone's going down
pls run the ball
"Trash first drive ,"
"Some guys just have awful luck. Plays in 2nd game since 2018, gets injured again and it doesn't look good."
"Young injured again, big fuckin surprise"
"Dude, Andrews needs to stop jumping."
Just protect the ball pls Lamar
Might want to consider shuffling up the o-line. Looks terrible
"Texans are such a dangerous team. Glad we took the points there but... dang, a TD would've felt great there."
We left our tackling at home
Thanks BoB
Not looking great
Elliot looks slow there
"Where are our corners? This should be an easy strap up man coverage kind of day by Marcus, Marlo, and Jimmy"
I'm really starting to hate the fake crowd noise about as much as I do laugh tracks on network sitcoms.
"LaMaR cAn'T tHrOw

-haters"
Hot Take. Duv is going to be our next Jacoby.
Nice catch by tucker
Nice pass to Tuck
"Put Tucker in, he'll get a td"
I feel like the offense is being too cute rn
"Two possession game after the refs gifting them 3, lmao keep helping them refs they need it"
Hope our O-line shows up for the second half...
Y‚Äôall need to settle down lol. The world isn‚Äôt going to explode if we don‚Äôt score 3 touchdowns per quarter
Everyone is blaming the OL for that sack. That sack isn't the OL's fault.
They‚Äôre just driving up and down the field smh
"This game is far from over, especially if they stay uptempo and we play prevent or some nonsense."
Excellent block by Bozeman!!
GO FOR IT
Run the fucking score up fuck RG3 lol
I hate when lamar takes knee‚Äôs because it hurts his rushing stats. Dudes gonna take like 50 knees this year and his ypc average will drop a bunch
why was Queen outside guarding 1 on 1 like that?!?!
I honestly expected more from us. Big ups to the Texans for making us earn it.
"Greg Roman you dumbass you need to run, kill clock, and hit the field goal but no you wasted the turnover and now Stanley is injured"
[deleted]
"Man we could see the makings of a bad Oline in the browns game, but now it's really hurting us against a bad team."
"I'm glad the refs can just give free timeouts whenever they want

NFL hates us cause we love our players and support BLM"
Y‚Äôall always gotta complain about something huh
Unpopular opinion but I get a lot of entertainment from some of the content on TikTok I'll be sad to see it go
I could care less what they did before the game. I don‚Äôt need a kneeling update every week on what the team did and what anthems they did or did not stand for
"Ugh,  4th down :("
The interior oline is still weak I see
Dammit Tavon Young just can't stay healthy.
He can never stay healthy!!!
Tavon and injuries man
"Well, we resigned Jimmy Smith to a one year prove it kind of veteran deal and he yet again can't make the field.


Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Averrett is in instead."
Another year our return game doesn‚Äôt exist lmao
"WHY SRE THEY TRYING TO KILL LAMAR, CALL A FUCKING RUN."
"The o line has regressed so much, what a damn shame"
Llama gonna run out of energy by the 2nd quarter RUN THE DAMN BALL
Ready for dubs for both my Ravens and Lakers today
"I'm sad I have to miss the cards and chiefs game because I'm focusing on ours. But at the same time, we the best, so am I really missing out?"
"i don't hate mahomes, i really like him, but i do hope he lays an egg in his game because why on earth is this not the national game."
TUCKER WITH THE GODLY CATCH
Marlon Punch-free
"This is why you run the ball, to freeze their ends and give yourself 3rd and shorts. The play calling hasn‚Äôt been good. This game has been all our defence. Our only td came on a 30 yard field. The offence needs to establish the run, idk why we keep passing on 1st and have given dobbins 0 carries. Last time we abandoned the run like this was the playoff game"
There are going to be problems if they bring this play to Pittsburgh
"We don‚Äôt need Yanda, it‚Äôs week 2. Chill."
Refs trying to bail out the Texans and make this a game.
We‚Äôve played very sloppy and still are up 20-7. We need to wake up now
Learn to wear a mask you fucking ancient zebra cunt
"Any way we can realistically improve our pass rush this season? Like, who we can trade for or something?"
"Not sure how you make that play with him shoving you like that, blatant pi"
You guys are new to Lamar Jackson if you think this O line punishment is new to him. All that chaos is way too familiar to him.
AVERETT with a good play??
If young is out for a while we really should trade to get someone other than everrett
cant have those mistakes right now. Make a play d
Awful throw
Not good for Lamar.  Stay inbounds.
Man do we have the best 1-2-3 RB lineup in the league or what?
The Gus Bus's gas mileage/battery range just went up.
The bus is just working them right now
GUS BUS....CHOO CHOO MOTHERFUCKERS
"Where was Andrews all game, wtf?"
Is Stanley still out? Yall Oline ain't holding it down like normal.
Yooo why is Lamar not bailing out?
"This shit is fucking rigged, FFS!"
Texans are just one good drive from making this a one-score game.
Time for some Texan bbq!
LET'S GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Hey all!  Getting excited and annoyed b/c CBS dc has not switched over yet .
Anyone have a stream link?
Wait is this happening
Will they wait until the squeelers game ends to start ravens game?
Pit lose soon

Squealers still blow
I called out of work for this

"As a new fan, are the Texans good or is it gonna be another blowout?"
I too am looking forward to a robust game of football
Oooo got the home jerseys on
Ah ok here we go!
"Watch them fake it lmao
Edit. I'm surprised they actually punted it knowing that they have BoB"
"Ahh, yes. Now I get to see what a good team looks like."
LET'S GOOOOO LAMAR. LET'S GO RAVENS!
"Run, run, run the ball."
Let‚Äôs get the running attack going again
Those numbers are insane
The fucking zip on that ball.
LFG
LETS GOOOOOOO
It‚Äôs weird hearing the NBA 2K guy announcing football
Atta Boyyyykin
Bruhh
28 TDS 1 INT JFC
awful
Are they even pumping in crowd noise? It's so quiet
FUCKKKKKKK
F
Great
Fuck today
Man
Looks serious
It has to be worth something that he didn‚Äôt get carted off and got up pretty quick
Well he was due to get injured in the preseason.... so this is par.
The knees are compromised today
Averett is ok
Good stop
Get ready to watch Averett get burned
Queen is a king
"great stop defense, pray for Tavon!"
Queeeeen
Long live the Queen!
Monstars
Hope Young is Ok.
Let‚Äôs go O
What's the most important piece on a chessboard?
ProfootballDoc thinks it‚Äôs an ACL injury for Tavon https://twitter.com/profootballdoc/status/1307781548364578816?s=21
Lamar scores  2 td in 6 minutes
Are we not allowed to run today?
Ouch
We're getting close to blocking these punts
bad start for the offense
"Ugh, we NEED Ronnie Stanley..."
Not pounding the rock!  The Hell!!!
Nowhere to go on that play
Ugh
One first down. Let's go.
FUCK YES
Lovely block
Mandrews
Man loves to hurdle
Lamar is my dad Andrews is my papa
BEST TE IN THE LEAGUE
I fucking love Mark Andrews
There we go
Anybody got a working stream?
Nice block by Boykin.
Fucking Mandrews
Lmao y'all have lil truzz
I don't get the play calling thus far
Boykin with a man sized block
Bless you Mandrews
That's more fucking like it
Wtg Mandrews. Now let‚Äôs run.
RUN THE BALL!!
RUN THE BALL! HARBS!!! >:(
Is ingrim hurt?
Did the rbs suit up today?
How was that Roby hit on Hollywood not a flag for leading with the crown?!?
Andrews really need to watch the hurdling. He's going to get hurt
Mandrews hurdling brings back bad memories
Mama there goes that Mandrews
RUN DAMMIT
I love boykins block there. How come we havent ran the ball a single time except for the sweep? Running backs?!
Uh run the ball bb
O-line looks baaaaaad so far
Roman you are really confusing me here
Wow. What a throw. Also Oline...how about a second or two?
Did not like that landing from Mandrews.  Me no like helmet hitting ground hard.
Isn‚Äôt Lonnie Johnson the guy who misspelled his name on his SAT?
MAndrews! Nice block by Boykin too
Are we just passing vs AFC south teams or what?
Beautiful run by Lamar there.
Lamar nice!!
FINALLY A DECENT RUN
Cool.  Cool.  I think they just needed a series to remember that not every team is the the Browns.
Boykin has much improved
"Fuck, Young's done for the day probably"
Ravens marching!
YES Slants to big body receiver finally!!!
FUUUUCK. Poor Tavon
T Young knee problem....no dah
"Well crap, Young likely done for the day"
"FUCK,  we need Tavon"
Classic lamar right there. Love it
gus almost plowed through that tackle
Tavon Young best nickel CB in the league for 1 game you get out of him a year
Llama is showing off
"Yes, but slide FEET first Lamar..."
Omg lamar is so fucking good
Hold my breath every time he goes face first.
a cleanse of pallet after watching my man burrow try to be lamar lol
Lamar is good
"love gus, even on 3 yard runs"
Good drive by the offense. The defense is getting some good rest with this drive.
3 in a row?
No one went to pick up Lamar :(
lamar fast
Any decent slot corners available? Losing tavon‚Äôs a big blow to our depth
Broken ankles!
Cunningham is pretty good it seems
I miss Yanda
Hollywood wants nothin to do with Watt lol
Go for it!
ITWT
we don't seem to be using the fake handoff look that we used a lot last year.
A lot of new fans were not here when every game was within 3 and came down to the last play I see lmaoooo
Houston would have 7 on the board of we had just picked Baker up in the draft. Shit.
Its early in the season they are showing some looks for upcoming teams to study
Defense make a play
Everybody. Don‚Äôt care anything else but please stay healthy until the chiefs game.
How is Lamar so young!!!
Run D looks good
But yeah let JK/Ingram run a little
Stuff these fuckers.  Get um off the field
"Least we forced the 4th, no 1st down. But Jeeeeeeezz we need better rush"
"I know tackling Deshaun isn‚Äôt easy, but that was awful"
Really suprised that wasn‚Äôt blown dead
When did the Texans pick up Russell wilson?
"Shit, I was so stress. Lucky he got out so many tackles, he should've thrown it away like 20 times that play."
Fucking make the tackle
YES
hell yeah!
DEFENSE
"Lol, Watson had no chance"
Big oof
Bill o'brien... wow
Who had the QB pressure?
Trust BoB to make a horrible decision
Let‚Äôs go boys!!!
"Unrelated, but where can I get that neck gaiter that Harbaugh's wearing?"
I‚Äôm gonna need two TDs to Hollywood for my fantasy team.
I know nobody cares about fantasy but I just traded Watkins for Hollywood minutes before kick off I'm stoked
BoB is gonna BoB
There‚Äôs my Ingram
Angry Ingram.
Texans had a mini bye everyone chill
Jk dobbins td incoming
This is a nice drive.
Ram this one in like it's Jenna Jameson.
There's Ingram
Lamar's a gunslinger.
TUDDER
hot damn
Alright D let‚Äôs get it
"D just punked em hard, forced the T.O."
Why did the Texans decide not to pump crowd noise?
Wide open
Too much time!!!
Whew.
Just like that
False start??
Damn
Fells eating our lunch
Burn the clock and get the ball back next half and double up on scores
Those passes to the TE who is so much bigger than our DBs....really hard to stop even with perfect coverage. Dunno what you are even supposed to do there.
Pls respond rn Offense we‚Äôre fortunate that BoB is an idiot
Stream?
Offsides
"Damn, first flag?  Clean game"
Let‚Äôs get it!
DUVERYAY
Jackson‚Äôs ability to turn an aggressive blitz against them is just fun to watch
Yes.  Need more Ingram!
We got this
"Move those chains, move those chains, move those chains, HUAA!"
Oh Boy!
Tuck with the catch! Goat
That was harder than it needed to be
Lamar and the receivers are playing great
lot of open receivers down the field.
"Man, he juuuuuust barely got Hollywood"
Damn.
Fuck
Awww
Tucker is so damn good
that show actually looks good to me
Great special teams play by Board
Where the hell is JK DOBBINS TODAY
"This is a good game to get out if sync. Texans are really good and if we can grind this out, it might show some of our coaches and players our deficiencies before the game vs chiefs."
And just like that we run away with it
LET'S FUCKING GO DEFENSE
AND THAT'S HOW YOU GET BACK D!
"FUCKING COWARDS, GIVE MY MAN HIS PICK 6"
FUMBLE TD LETS FUCKING GO!!
"Long Texans drive here for a TD to end the half would be... bad! Let's get hype (for the first time this game), defense."
Just thought to myself we could use a fumble
üòçüòçüòçüòç
Fruit Punch is in season
...
please let this stand
FALCON PUNCH
You love to see it!
MARLOOOO LETS GOOO
hey thats a touchdown
LET'S GOOO
Our defence just played right.
He ain't even step out!
MARVIN FOR DEFENSIVE MVP
WOO
Nothing to review here. Ravens ball üôÑ
Thats a TD right? Looked good to me
He made a football move after catch the ball it‚Äôs a fumble.
Marlon is gonna get his bread soon
TD!
I called it!
td.
Ahhhhh yeahhhh
Let‚Äôs go!!!
Big Willy!
Let's do it again
If tavon is out do we sign TJ?
Herbert  winning against mahomes lamar best qb mvp
Fuuuck yes!
Can't let them score here. Need to go for the throat early
LFG
LETS FUCKING GOO
Watson slightly overrated!?!?! Hmmm....
End it here
No one even close to open
Guys when did Ed Reed come back wearing 24?
Watt is just fucking terrorizing is god damn
Got damn O Line
JJ owns our line when we play in NRG
brown kinda stopped onn watt a little  early
Need to get OBJ some Boyle help
Brown gotta move his feet there
"""FG Target Line""  Is that corrected for Tucker?"
Let‚Äôs get enough for at least a fg
"I like a TD here, but if we only get 5 yards and a FG I‚Äôm happy"
It‚Äôs JJ Watt. Dude is a fucking beast. Not surprised.
Oh God
I MEAN SHIT O LINE
"Man, O line is getting torched"
Fuck
CAN WE NOT
"Don't ruin our chance to see tucker kick a really long FG. It's not fair, JJ."
What‚Äôs with all the pass plays?
"Damn, why Yanda"
God damnit
Dobbins missed that block.
Bro our Oline nooo üòû
FUCK
He looks fine
"Ronnie pls be okay.

We love you ya big bear!"
Not that the online has been stellar but that was an all out blitz
Ronnie Stanley‚Äôs ankle again
No points for them cmon stop them here
Offense hasn't felt as dominant on the Texans side of the field as I'd like to see.
All these people crying about these sacks but lamar ain‚Äôt drop the ball most qbs would have dropped that ball
These TEs are killing us.
Finally a sack!
Looks like the Texans woke up
Cmon defense...
Obviously I'm not a coach but if they're rushing the linebackers and we have very fast WR why don't we run them down the middle?
I hope Stanley is okay
ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"instead of clock running out, now it stops."
Dammit
Averrett is trash. I don't want anyone to convince me otherwise.
Int calling it by clark
Averett is a fast frank walker
okay didn't see the ref kick it. i'll allow it.
Thats fucking crazy
Still blame the lack of a rush.
Bull shit
Skura is just a shadow of his former self. Absurd to play him in the condition he is in.
Just saw a local political commercial that was [LITERALLY this](https://youtu.be/SW-JocxB15U) but with wrestling techniques instead of guns. So so dumb.
COLLUSION
Great protection there
Wow the line held up lol
"Lamar had time, he needs more"
Cunningham is everywhere
Roman run the damn ball
Hey guys a run!!!!
GUS THE BUS
He really do be looking like a bus sometimes
"Ok, as much as I've been loving seeing Jackson's upgraded passing abilities it's nice to see some running too!"
 This is why we should be running
HONK HONK
THE BUS IS ROLLING
Gus running mfs over!!!
The Gus bus stops for no one
"If there werent other guys around, Gus would have 100% broken that tackle on his previous run."
"Ingram might not be as fast as he used to, but he still runs hard"
Played WR at Notre dame.
Always forget how explosive Gus is
Gus should get ever 2 yards to gain even time
"Look at that stat, fuckin beautiful.

These Ravens are something special."
Lamar doing work with the snap count
I'll take that
Hollywood deep
Lamar tapping into that Brady/Rodgers energy. Get those free yards! Make them think twice about jumping the snap count.
Gus doesn‚Äôt get enough recognition man
"&#x200B;

Lamar making ESPN Highlight  Reels"
are you all happy you got your planned run with lamar now?
JK IS IN
KEEP HIM IN YOU FUCKS
GOOD JOB DOBBINS!!
I love that from jk
Damn I can't believe he stayed up for that.
"Fucking right dobbins

Thats some rice shit right there"
Sick tackle break JK
atta boy Dobs
Nice fucking play dobbins
Way to stay on your feet jk
Nice job!
DOBBINS. Making plays
"Oof, Lamar..."
Let's go jk
FEED JK
What offense are we running?!? Air Coryell?
I'm not looking these called qb runs. Haven't worked well but once
Finally got Dobbins involved!!!
GOOD SHIT JK
JK!
JK out here turning cbs into fools
JK lol
What a catch and run
Is something wrong with Ingram?
Jk but we ain‚Äôt joking
Exactly what I'm talking about. No way we let gus go with JK. Perfect 1-2 punch
reminded me of another 27 with that
"When our run game is working, we are almost unstoppable."
That was a money throw.
:/
NEED A TD TO HOLLYWOOD HERE
Dobbins is so fucking good
McKinney turned pretty freaking late on that one
Jesus fucking Christ online is total shit today
Gimme 3
SMHHH
i want an o-line plz :(
Where's the line...
 Pain
Line looks fucking awful
God damn this o-line sucks
Whew close one there Tuck
Shew that was close. Good time eating drive and points at least
Is Ronnie playing or is he still on IR?
Bruh it‚Äôs 2020 why is James Harrison in commercials
Our line looks a bit slow processing stunts. Hopefully it improves as the rook gains experience and these guys get more playing time together
Queen go zoom
Our running game hasn‚Äôt looked good that last two weeks
McPhee looked 24 there!
He down.
How tf does Phee still play songs hard
Watching the ticker 49ers lost a few players today eh? Jesus
ah fuck
oh boy.
We need to get this oline together and need an actual pass rusher with some speed.
Almost.
"1 offense TD feels bad, hope we can get one more and sure up the game"
Calais noooo
Fuckk
We finally stopped their offense
yesss baby yoda
"Ok, that was the hand-off deception I've been missing so far."
Be careful Mark üôèüèΩ
Thays mah boy
[deleted]
Hell yeah In fg Range
"Lol, everyone thought Washington was gonna be good this year"
here we go long clock burning TD drive
I love this announcer lol
SNEAD
Perfect.  QBs draw and quick slant to Snead.  That‚Äôs how to slow down the rush.
I hate when they say shit that jinx us. Don't talk about the damn no turnovers!
Dobbins wide open on the dump off
Line is really struggling with those interior stunts.
Thats what you get when you don't wrap up for literally no reason.
GO FOR IT
Oof he needed a few big Macs for that
Llammmmma
5 wides go for it
Fucking right!!!
Fortune favors the bold.
WOW WHAT A PLAY CALL
THE BIG FELLA
Wildcatttttttt babyyyyy!
BLACKJACK 21!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
THAT'S HOW YOU BLOCK
LMAO WOW
game
The road to 2-0
Hell yeah let's go for it coach!
Hit that bull Ingram!
YEP
LMAO let's fucking go!!!!!
BIG BOI SHIT
LETS GO MARK!!
Poor Giants.
Alright D. Please no points
[deleted]
Cmon D!
Come on defense dont do that
Marlon Humphrey a slot CB?
Jesus another obvious missed hold
apparently Sammy Watkins suffered a  *possible* concussion in todays game.
Can we keep playing aggressive? A lot of time left
i would not wanna be watson there and have campbell fall on you
Bowser in coverage?
Another sack whiffed.
How did whoever that was miss that sack
That block by project Pat on the Ingram TD... Amazing
I'd like to see the O-line and the RBs get some real-time chemistry going for the rest of this game. We're going to want/need it at some point.
Justin Reid is very good
Damn that was a clutch stop on Lamar ngl
go for it
Surrender Index is gonna flame us hard if we punt
"Anybody know if the neck gaiter Harbs has is avail for purchase? Can't find it on any of the main sites (NFL Shop, fanatics, fansedge).

Also, solid overall game! Go Ravens!"
Look like LLAMA said I‚Äôll do it myself lmao
"Not worth it, that‚Äôs how Mahomes got hurt"
The cardboard fans are kinda creepy
"I wonder why lamar doesn't have audibles like Mahomes does. Yknow how Mahomes says ""35"" to signify snap it on 2? Lmao"
I want us to score 7 more! I don't want to see us let up. Let's make a statement that even on our off days we're better than most AFC teams.
Let's make it 37!
GUS
Score again
One more score and put this thing to bed.
Can we just start with the Gus Bus from now on? Like let the man ram that Dline a bit then swap in Ingram & Dobbins to get loose on em then let Gus carry the team home.
Wildcat Dobby
Did he hit Lamar late?
its not an officials timeout...they were waiting until the ejected player left the bench area  before resuming play
Uhhh? Okay?
"buh bye, bud"
Lamae ts plz
O line got it done on this drive
Lamar td plz
"Well, now it is time for KC.  It is on!  Big Time!"
Go ahead with your bad self Chuck Clark!!!
David Johnson single-handedly stripped the ‚Äúsack daddy‚Äù monicker
Gg
"Someone said 90 was stomping Lamar's head, is that true because wth"
Best back drafted this year
Did we play Gus so much as cover for the Chiefs?
Dam we make it look to easy
Now I just want them to put in Justice Hill to get his pounding in against the Texans
WW
How do OT rules work again?
Bowser is looking look so far he‚Äôs been very active in these first 2 games always seems to be around the ball maybe 7+ sacks this season...also Boykin on offense but LJ has so much weapons
Tavon Mr Glass Young SMDH
That wasn't great. Let's just hope it was a rusty start
"Man, I‚Äôm hoping it‚Äôs rust, but our Oline hasn‚Äôt been good. Squeelers will eat this line alive..."
This is a closer game than it should be. Weird play calls and a shaky O line really not making me feel good
[deleted]
I fucking hope nobody falls injured here
Damn
"That series was uninspired, lol."
It didnt look like anything even touched him.
Tayvon Young hurt again? Wouldnt be surprised.
Roman calling this game way too cute. Run the god damn ball on first down.
roman passing too much just like in the titans game
Boykin is such a good ass blocker
Sometimes I forget how spoiled we are with Lamar
Lamar needs to start sliding feet first
Need stream plz.  My power went out. No direct tv for me :(
Boyle's block game needs help
That wasn't holding?  Ok
Yea I've lost hope for this offensive line.
Oline doesn‚Äôt look good
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/028/539/DyqSKoaX4AATc2G.jpg
Why make the Texans do anything? Why not give them 3 points and call it halftime?
Rushing is not working at all which sucks
Boykin the tightend
Play calling is horrendous
I really want to see Fluker. Just to see if he can make a difference. He looked good last week.
"Fuck with out those turnovers our defense really isn't that good. So many wide open targets, no pass rush, can't finish tackles in the back field, letting deshaun finish plays, things that will not pass against playoff teams"
Has there been an update on Tavon?
"Lol Houston fucking sucks, so mad there‚Äôs a 7 seed now, they may make the playoffs"
YOU CANT PARK THAT BUS
Great block from Boykin!!
Oh yeah boy! Let's get that run game working!
"We're getting lucky with the turnovers tbh, this defense is suspect"
Little off today. Texans D not quite that good.
"Throw short on 3rd. Flacco, is that you?"
We‚Äôre also up 13 points so yeah while the O-line play is frustrating I really doubt we lose this game.
I‚Äôm very nervous for this game. Our pass rush is god awful and watson is a magician. I also think our run defense is lackluster. I‚Äôm nervous for every game though. We‚Äôll probably win by 3 scores lmao
Fucking hell Tavon Young Mr Glass needs to be cut... He doesn't do anything for us besides leave us hanging
Why the fuck can't our defense play defense right
This is probably the least hype I‚Äôve been for a Ravens game in a while lol
Can someone PxP?
"clearly lamar took notes from kyler murray, the GOAT of getting out of bounds. r/nfl had some great advice."
OBJ getting used and abused by Watt
defense looks shaky
"Haven't caught the game today, but from what I've seen a bit it seems Lamar is a bit off and so is the line"
"The fact that it takes 50 people to tackle 1 person is concerning, otherwise good D! xD"
Can't believe we're winning a ~~home~~ game 30-16 in the 4th quarter and these dorky ass doofus' in the booth spent more time talking about other teams' QB's
Sorry ass pass rush
Does anyone else think Watt is a huge douche?
never was a fan of T. Young. dude is too small for a CB
Watson sucks....Big money for medicore play
Do we want the Chiefs coming in after a loss? I can't imagine them 1-2
are we going to see RGIII?
"Idk what game y‚Äôall are watching. Oline looked much better that drive. Held the pocket for Lamar on most throws and had good run block. The only bad play was the sack and they blitzed.

So many casual fans."
Gonna be honest. Lamar has made the OL look worse on a number of plays. This is looking like the steelers game. He's seeing ghost rushers.
Our defense. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
"I hope they don't try to draw a pentaly.

You could pull that shit with cleveland, but this defense is way too disciplined to do that."
where to watch?
Lamar carrying rn
Bwhahahahaha
Been watching RedZone during commercials and all I can say is Andy Reid must really hate how he looks in a mask to go with the shield again.
Where was marlon going lol he just got up and ran the other way
Offense looks sluggish today.
jj watt make the executive decision to start juicing again.
"Man... the pocket was good, there. Lamar ran into a sack"
So sad that there is no ravens football next Sunday
Smh
Why are we not running?
Fade me
"Can‚Äôt take a sack there, NGL, i was thinking hand it off and try a long fg. Lost 3 points."
anyone else just watch peters get fucked up? lmao
Wow we give our running backs the ball and it works who woulda thought
Lol go for it /s
Shit. Gotta punt imo
lol random challenge
Why the fuck Is BoB calling timeout
Beep beep BUSSSSS
GUS BUS!!
Feed the bus.
Wheels on the bus going round and round right now
THE BUS
Pat is such a boss
These refs are so fucking incompetent
Is it sexist if I say Melanie Collins is hot?
If we lose Stanley....... next week is a done deal loss
Lamar is panicking in the pocket . We NEED the o line to step up to calm lamar
Too much Lamar running.
"What is Lamar doing? Do you see the blitz? Get out of the pocket, dude."
Can you guys not start blaming the refs? That was an obvious penalty on Averett. He sucks.
Shades of Roman's playcalling against Tennessee
Tavon Young...going to be a meniscus or ACL
Who is this play by play announcer? Pretty annoying
There is no way they were snapping that ball. Waste of a timeout.
We should have at least tried the hard count before throwing the challenge flag
That‚Äôs shameful how did they possibly not get Watson
Is it me or has Calais just not looked like his pro bowl season last year?
How are we beating KC next week
These dumbass mistakes are going to doom us
All the hype just for 2 3 & outs by both teams üòÇ
Aww go for it
"Honest question.
How can we afford to pay Stanley 22mil when the other 3 or 4 positions on our line are so bad against good pass rushes.
Wouldn't it make more sense to trade stabley, draft a o line piece and pay someone who commands less 12-15"
Jackson needs to do a better job of handing the ball off on the read option
Is this an unpopular opinion? I don't really think Proche is that great as a returner
"Imagine being Lamar Jackson and instead of scrambling you collapse in the pocket.. SMFH

Edit: thanks for the downvotes, but yall know I'm right"
Stanley hurt now. Dude is so weak.
What team is going to trade us for a corner this year? Cause me thinks we need one
Terrible Kick!  He almost missed!
Alright. That State Farm commercial was pretty good. Lol
[deleted]
We‚Äôre going to get Lamar hurt. We need to stop doing designed runs for him when it‚Äôs not necessary and he also needs to slide
Going to lose...

Can't wait for DeCosta to snag some great OL for a 9th round pick. That's where the team needs it the most. Thankfully Lamar has been so calm in the pocket

""
BoB trading his #1 target is still baffling
I sorta feel sorry for Watson. He‚Äôs so legit and is with a  coach/GM that is gonna waste his youth.
"I like watson. He's got great pocket presence and can extend plays.

BoB is just a dipshit ruining his and jj watts careers"
I feel so bad for him
"I've loved Deshaun since he was at Clemson, and he deserves so much better than he's been given in Houston. BoB is on-track to waste a once-in-a-generation QB's career just like Indy did with Luck, and it's a fucking tragedy."
That trade of DeAndre Hopkins was epic stupidity
He looked so dejected that entire game.
"His talent is being wasted.. He deserves better than what he's getting!!!
I feel bad for him.  I can never talk bad about him.."
He should‚Äôve never re-signed with Texans. They are gonna waste his career.
That's life in the NFL somebody is going to lose
I'm rooting for him fr
The game thread was so shocked over how evasive he was. I hold my breath every drop back. I really don‚Äôt get why people think he‚Äôs overrated.
My mom laughed louder each time they showed him frozen in rage and said it needed to be a meme
"I wouldn't have signed the extension if I was him. Even if he outlasts BOB, chances are the next HC won't be significantly better and the organisation will continue to mismanage the pesonnel around him."
"#The rules are simple:

* **Submit a player/coach/position group**, preferably **in BOLD** to stand out easier. Add stats/reasoning if you want.

* Make sure your nominee has not already been submitted. 

#**Previous Weeks**

* Week 1: Lamar Jackson

#**This week's nominees are...**"
"**Marlon Humphrey**

Right hook from Marlon swung the momentum completely and the Texans never recovered."
"**MARCUS PETERS, MARLON HUMPHREY, LJ FORT and PATRICK QUEEN**"
"The Runningbacks!

Ingram with the swifty 4th down TD

Edwards with a bunch of backbreaking runs 

Dobbins with the nice 44 yard run to get us over 200 again"
"***Justin Tucker***

He didn‚Äôt need to score a game winner, but we haven‚Äôt given him the opportunity to often (thankfully). 

His consistency is easy to overlook and take for granted but he kept the distance which is crucial as we play best with a lead. So even when the offense couldn‚Äôt get it done he got us some guaranteed points."
Tucker for always being reliable!
"Gus Edwards.  That drive was the backbreaker.  

Don't get me wrong, defence made plays like crazy, but it was that drive where I wrote 'Game over' in my notebook."
"#Marlon Humphrey

Led the team in tackles (6 solo + 1 assist) and the clutch forced fumble"
"Lamar Jackson.

Im 100 percent convinced he makes this offensive line look decent. If its any other QB we would have given up 10+ sacks. Put Fluker out there at RG and help Orlando. That right side was ABUSED today"
"Overall, Gus. But Fort's play really turned the tide in our favour and he flashed in other plays as well."
"Lamar. Dude kept so many offensive drives alive, especially in the first half. His stats are good but he played so much better than they say."
DEFENSE ^(^Other ^Than ^Anthony ^Averett)
DeCosta for gems signings like Fort
MP Juice Man
The Bus That Couldn't Slow Down
So many people here are posting about the running backs but how about my boy **Patrick Ricard** blocking for all of them and opening up some massive holes to run through? Not to mention his layout goal-line grab for the TD!
The Gus Bus. Making no stops and taking no prisoners since 2018.
Team
Defense
defense!
All running backs
Defense: Made plays when it mattered and held our lead
While we had a good game and good players. The O-Line got pummeled today. Albeit some of those were because of Lamar running around but still. Gotta hold them boys back.
"Everyone for sure. Lamar being Lamar, all the running backs putting in work, MP and Humph being great, Tucker not missing as usual. Not much to criticise other than you know who"
"Another **team win**

Humphrey killed it, Lamar did great, Ingram had an excellent run TD, jk with a game killing run, gus controlling the clock, fort picking up the fumble, Juiceman with the int, elliott stoping that 4th down and a sack.

Everyone played well and still we got stuff we know to work on."
"**SECONDARY** (not named Anthony Averett)

Marlon and Peters played lockdown coverage all game, and each came up with a backbreaking turnover. Elliott had his first sack, Chuck kept everyone in position, and Jimmy played well in his limited role."
"LJ fort, looked like a rb on that pylon extension. That defensive TD is what first allowed us to pull away and we didn‚Äôt look back"
"DEFENSE

Whole squad effort.

PQ looking like royalty. Marlon swinging harder than Myles Garrett. LJ Fort taking it to the house. MP Juiceman out there pickin like it's apple season.

I thought some of Lamar's throws were a bit shaky today and OL was slacking, but that's why this is a **team**. Our receivers made plays, defense stepped it up, and as always Tucker gets it in.

*Lamar wasn't bad by any means, and did a fantastic job dealing with the pressure of an incredible Texans D. I meant moreso some of his passes were just on the edge and required good moves from our receivers. The Ricard TD that was a bit low comes to mind. At this point our competition is only ourselves and perfection is the standard we go by üò§*"
Peters
Defense....does that count?
MARCUS PETERS
"Offense: Gus
Defense: Fort"
Greg Roman. Gut punch with Ingram wildcat completely demoralized the Texans. They were shell shocked after that.
"Lamar and the run game?

That OL, in particular the right side did them no favors. Lamar was super fucking comfortable under pressure like usual and was on point even though he couldn't go deep like he wanted. Gus, Mark and JK (albeit late but man that fucking run was electric) were on fire"
"Fort has fumble recoveries in back to back weeks and this one he turned on the jets, Let the big man get this one"
Running backs
**Gus Edwards**
"**Defense**

Lots of good plays and turnovers from them. Took a while to get some sacks but they eventually came through."
Running backs
Going defense on this one. Creating turnovers and getting pressure on Watson.
RB's
*Gus Edwards*
Peters
"**Marcus Peters**

That was a great interception.  You could give it to a bunch of guys as it's a true team effort this time, but I'm fine with spotlighting Peters."
"I'm going to say Boykin.  he didn't have the best game statistically, but his presence was felt on the field, at times he was invisible last year as a pass catcher. run blocks well."
"Ingram,  for the roundhouse kick and fooling a lot of us thinking that Lamar got slow somehow."
"I can't pick just one, so I'm going with...Our Pro Bowl CB duo.

**Marlon Humphrey** & **Marcus Peters**

I don't think Marlon allowed a single completion and both contributed to turnovers. Plus the Peters INT was thing of beauty."
"LJ needs some credit

Of course it's a team win, but Fort did a total tempo shift with the scoop and score. 

Humphrey, Lamar, the game plan, JK ...they all work. They always work.

Fort's instincts and good angles and pure footballin got the game going the right direction! 

Lf'ing J Fort"
The entire defense
"**Marlon Humphrey**

The punch. Played great coverage all game. And was bringing the energy. The way he attacked the lead blocks on one of the plays had me HYPED"
Marlon Humphrey and Patrick Queen
Marlon Humphrey/MP JUICE MAN
"One half of the best cornerback duo:

 Marlon ""Fruit Punch"" Humphrey"
"I vote for the secondary, they did a great job slowing down Houston‚Äôs WR core and allowed our front 7 to go to work. Marlon had the big forced fumble, Peters that ed reed like interception, and Elliot with that sack."
"Gus Edwards, Marlon Humphrey, Marcus Peters, L.J. Fort, Lamar Jackson and Calais Campbell are the players of the game candidates and the Emmy goes to.....

....... L.J. Fort"
"For me, it would be the cornerbacks, and Tucker obviously."
"Marlon Humphrey. Forced a fumble that led to the game-breaking TD, and made Fuller non-existent."
Wink martindale- For the second year in a row he had the perfect game plan to stop deshaun Watson. Coverage was excellent and he devised a good blend of blitzes so Watson had no time to throw.
Marcus Peters. Channeling Ed Reed on that pick...
[deleted]
233 I think before the kneel downs so I think we ended up with 230 total
"As far as I know he is an impending free agent after the season. . . 

I feel that we have to retain this guy. He‚Äôs fit in well with the scheme and Lamar, just wanted your thoughts on retaining him for next season"
"Honestly hes amazing, but RB is the one position where we can lose a guy due to our depth. Ingram, JK, and Hill are an amazing trio if Gus leaves. Just depends on how much money he wants"
"Give me Gus over Hill. 

Haven‚Äôt really been impressed with Hill."
Yeah he‚Äôs worth more to us than he is in a trade. Next year it‚Äôll be JK and Gus 1 and 2. Cut Ingram to save cap space but maybe he‚Äôll resign/restructure on a cheaper team friendly deal.
[deleted]
He‚Äôs a RFA next year
"Gus probably gets a deal on some other team, we dont have the cap to go for him. We probably pick up a RB day 2 or 3 if not another UDFA. It is sad but with c ap dropping so much and the paydays we have to make he doesnt fit in the books."
"I‚Äôll say Gus is a killer late in a game, with the fresh legs we provide him."
honestly for the future i‚Äôll take gus over ingram cause mark us getting old
"I really think EDC would be amiss to not resign him. He's a great 1b - 2 back and his 1 cut power style REALLY fits us on 3rd and short.

He's got great vision between the guards and fights for yards.


I'd really like to resign him to a deal similar to Kareem Hunts. You then match him with JKs contract"
"Gus is a RFA.. prolly pull 3-5mill/yr in free agency.. 

Ingram is gonna cost 6.33 next year.. can save 5 mill with cut.. but can prolly pay him whatever we would have to pay Gus to keep him..

Justice is gonna be cheap still.. 

Probably trade Gus to the Jets to replace Bell.. extend Ingram.. keep Hill and Dobbins.."
I saw Ingram shaking his head and talking to someone on the sideline on his last run. It‚Äôs pretty clear mark thought he shoulda scored but it seems like Gus is more worried about contact or just doesn‚Äôt have the elusive necessary. No one may have notice but mark points to his head and you can tell it‚Äôs regarding Gus not being a very innovative or creative back.

"As bad as this sucks for him, we gotta restructure that contract. Paying him lots to never play a full season."
3 missed full seasons now?
"Really feel for the guy, hopefully Averett can step up because he was getting dotted up all game"
The best ability is availability.
"Well, he only has season ending injuries so I didn't expect anything less"
Dude needs to retire
"Tavon is a great player but at a certain point out for the season just becomes who you are, 3 of these now idk how much he's got left"
Are you fucking kidding me. That's just shy of 2 full seasons missed in two seasons.
Man Tavon is such a baller CB. He plays way bigger than his size and was an incredible find. I wish he would get rid of whatever luck is plaguing him.
So can we go get Carr back from the Cowboys practice squad? I dont want to see Averett on the field trying to stop any of the Chiefs receivers next week...
Time to restructure that contract
Come on....god dammit
What else is new
This sucks
Really unfortunate for him
Fuck this!!
What team is tanking? so we can pry their slot corner away for a 5th
I feel fucking terrible for him. Can't even imagine what he's going through
"I'm not sure he should be cut next year right off the bat, but at this point we've got to plan as if he's not in the depth chart."
bro he‚Äôs good but he gets hurt so much he‚Äôs missed over 30+ games now he should retire
Dude can‚Äôt catch a break. Next man up
Hate to say it but he can‚Äôt be relied on. He shouldn‚Äôt be on the roster at the start of next season.
"FUCKKKK, this one hurts"
"It certainly seems destined that Tavon Young & DeShon Elliott are not supposed to play together. Whenever one *is* healthy, the other one is injured. Ever since Tavon's contract extension, he has played a grand total of one full game. That signing sure looks like one of DeCosta's worst decisions as GM, right up there with the ET3 debacle!

It is a shame, because he is a pretty special player when available. However, it feels as if he has been injured more than Jimmy Smith & Lardarius Webb combined (I'm exaggerating, of course). Yet another reminder why Brandon Carr should have never been let go! Too bad they had to learn this inevitable, predictable lesson the hardest way possible!"
">On February 21, 2019, Young signed a three-year, $25.8 million contract extension with the Ravens, making him the highest-paid nickel-back in the NFL.


Can't predict injuries but this hurts"
Really sucks but hes gotta get cut next yr. He was one of my favorites on D too
yep i knew he'd get hurt he gets hurt every year
Should have resigned Carr. CB getting super thin
This is probably the end. Sucks so bad. Really liked the dude.
"Couldn‚Äôt watch the game live, how‚Äôd it happen?"
"Anyone know how much we‚Äôd save? Wasn‚Äôt his contract right up there at the time? I feel for the guy, but with zero production we need that money for Stanley/Humphrey/Andrews etc"
5th round pick for The Jets best Cornerback...incoming!!!
"Well that sucks. And with the cap being extremely tight next year, I can definitely see him being on the chopping block. 

It's a shame, but I think he's going to end up being one of the great ""What If's"" in team history."
They gotta cut him at this point. It's every single year
Cut him forever who cares how good he is if he is injured for 50% of his career
"There absolutely cannot be any other franchise that has ever been more ravaged by constant injuries to secondary members than what our favorite team has gone through for approximately a decade-plus! But hey, who cares about a guy that never missed a game in his career, just let him leave. I pine for Brandon Carr over Anthony Averett, but those pipe dreams are long gone!"

Talking about this guy like hes 1 of a kind üòÇ

Yeah I usually love Romo but that was just a stupid statement from him.
Wish you would've posted the context. No idea what you're talking about.
"As much a I love to hear the goat getting respect, butker is literally the next one in line for career % after him. So one of a kind, no, but not many as good as him. Tucker just happens to be better."
"The main issue is that the Ravens don't have to settle for those king attempts very often, meaning Tucker can't show case his skills as often."
They all want Tuckers spot but they can't have it
The chiefs sub really believes his comments to like no one could ever hit a 58 yard fg lmao
I'm fine with that. Let them forget Tucker is the Ravens best kept secret in the NFL
I mean he‚Äôs paid to talk about the teams and players he‚Äôs there commenting for.
Whats the big deal? Let em enjoy their win..They didn't disrespect Tuck..
I think we are taking this too personally.

Trade for a db? Sign a free agent? Or bring a guy up from practice squad? Give me your thoughts
"If we base it off history, we‚Äôll probably trade our washing machine for Jaire Alexander"
Sign Lamar Jackson. Right now.
Jimmy will go to CB and we‚Äôll likely promote from within at reserve safety. Levine will play a lot more in dime packages.
I mean he was out all of last season too no?
Once Carr goes back down to PS (I think he was pulled up against this week) I say we sign him on Monday and bench Averett.
"We play football. 

I mean Young was out all of 2019 and 2017. We played the Chiefs last year with Carr, Averett, and Canady and lost on a 3rd down conversion.

Dude has been balling these last 2 weeks yet gets no love. Keep doing your thing 58
He gets no love? He gets lots of positive praise.
There's literally an LJ Fort appreciation thread on the front page you loon.
Pretty sure every Raven knows LJ Fort.. I think I have even been able to forget he was a Steeler..
Can't believe we got him for free via the Eagles lmfao
He definitely gets noticed. He's a great veteran presence and off ball LB to compliment Queen and Harrison.

Aww man.  It‚Äôs devastating for the kid.  All the talent in the world and the body just can‚Äôt hold out.  I can‚Äôt imagine the frustration.  Cut him a break.
"No need for this IMHO. The guy has played well and hard for us and rehabbed from multiple injuries. 

Not his fault that hes hard luck. 

Sometimes Im embarrassed by my fellow fans."
Bro delete this.
"As we are used to being delighted with over 30 pts per game almost every week since last year, however, today, the o line being out of groove almost costed things on offense and if this would've happened against a better team there's no doubt we would've lost this game.

I like to focus on the fact that the game was won and that's all it matters, but it's becoming a serious concern that the offensive line will start affecting play calling and what can be done on offense.
The offense wasn't able to take any deep shots or call any deep, long developing plays since the pass rush was too intense, which immediately took an effect on what Hollywood and Andrews bring to the table, Ingram struggled a lot at beginning, same with Lamar which seemed to bump into sacks since the guys in front were literally being pushed back. I'm hoping since they'll have an extra day of rest this next week they can clean this up otherwise the Chiefs defense can make life difficult for them (Not that they're an elite defense but they're pretty damn good if given the opportunity and their opponent is caught slacking)."
What's most important is how much better Lamar's passing is. He's throwing absolute zingers all day.
"Good points, but most teams don‚Äôt have a Garret/Watt wrecking shit either. Those two are elite talents.  Let‚Äôs see what happens against more pedestrian lines before sounding the alarms."
"I know I'm not the only one when I say that this felt like the least rewarding win we've had in a very long time. Hardly feels like a win at all, and to me, that's because of everything you just mentioned above. 

It felt like the last two seasons with Joe Flacco and Marty, nothing but dump offs and a few check downs. Our line effectively ensured that Mark Andrews, Brown and the rest of our textbook Corp was effectively out of the entire game. 

Oh, and also, where the FUCK was Dobbins this entire night besides his 40 yard scamper in garbage time??? Did he have a bad week of practice or something? What gives?

Also, we are NOT going to be win like this against the chiefs or Washington with our line so suspect."
I felt at times Lamar was doubting himself on the rush attempts. A couple times I felt he was in two minds.
"Unpopular opinion: The OL wasn't as bad as it seemed on passing plays.

I thought lamar ran into 2 sacks and was indecisive on a third. Unlike week 1 & most weeks, I thought lamar was feeling too many ghost pressures while not reading the leverage of pass rushers which led to sacks. For instance, tyre Phillips had his man blocked on one play. Lamar scrambled in a way that allowed the DL to uncover and sack him. Tyre went from doing a good job pass blocking a guy to ""allowing"" a sack because his qb ran into the defender's path.

The Texans did a good job squeezing the pocket with their ends. However, we've seen lamar move brilliantly in the pocket in situations like that in the past. Today, lamar looked like the lamar we saw in the steelers game last yr. 

Also, I thought jj watt in particular was great at readingand attacking the mesh point.

Either way, lamar still had an efficient and productive day. He is a great player. I just thought he made the OL's job harder than it should've been today in a few instances.

The OL's run blocking on the other hand wasn't good in the first half."
""
"Honestly, there‚Äôs no one who consistently gets the short end of the stick as much as Tyrod. I really doubt Herbert doesn‚Äôt start after that performance. Sending all positive vibes to him, but man just terrible luck in his career. 

Selfish: Would love to have him back in Charm City if anything happens to RGIII"
He looked terrible last week and Herbie looked real good today. He won't be the starter
Tyrod is not good. He is a backup.
If anyone watched it breaks my heart to see Boyle apparently doesn't get along with Humphrey.
"I think it‚Äôs just a joke between Marlo and Boyle, cause if I‚Äôm not mistaken Marlon always calls him a ‚Äújerk‚Äù and maybe Boyle gets a lil hurt from it, but I don‚Äôt think they DON‚ÄôT get along."
Haven't seen it but who cares. I have disliked a lot of coworkers over the years. You can't like everyone
I think it‚Äôs a mixture and of things. You‚Äôve got a quiet ass white guy around a bunch of hype high energy black guys. Their energy doesn‚Äôt match at all. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs as big of a problem as it seems tho.
It didn‚Äôt seem like anything to me
"Unpopular opinion: Marlon strikes me as the kind of guy I would hate to be around every day.

That said he's a baller ass corner so who cares what my perception of him is based on limited social media insight."
I honestly felt so awkward watching that. It really seemed like Boyle and Andrews hated Marlo.
Why what happened?
"Man its the first I'm hearing about it, but we don't need to more beef or drama in the locker room after the earl Thomas shit"

Bruh these bandwagoners are something else
"Dude....were not invincible. Texans have strengths and weaknesses just like we do. They have playmakers, guys like JJ watt are destined to make an impact. Relax, we'll be fine."
Naw still feels like a win to me nephew
"My god man.  The browns have Garret.  The Texans have Watt.  Those two are game wreckers + the rest of the talent on those lines.  Ravens O-line isn‚Äôt elite, but it‚Äôs certainly not time to sound the alarms yet."
Found the fan that didn‚Äôt sit through 2013-17
Duv didnt score
"We are 2-0.. I doesnt matter if you win by 1 or 30...A win's a win. As a matter of fact: How does a win feel like a loss? ü§îü§îü§îü§î
You fans need a damn Snickers.."
"All those problems and we still won by 3 scores. Which tells me we will probably be okay.

Also Duv didn't score."
"the opponent is allowed to make plays, they are professional athletes too"
"If out-gaining our opponent by 100 yards, controlling the clock, and doubling the scoreboard is getting exposed... expose me 14 more times. We just took 3 knees inside their 30 to win fella. Sober up."
Chill it‚Äôs week 2 ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"Man I literally just sat here watching the game and said out loud.. I still can't figure out how to feel about putting up 30 pts a game consistently.. it's such a change from every year ever. No matter how bad the o-line play was, or how lethargic it seemed.. you still gotta bring at LEAST a 30 bomb to stay in touch with Lamar..so far the only teams averaging that besides us is the Packers and Seahawks, and most likely the Saints after tomorrow..

Then you look at the defense and the Packers and Hawks are giving up 22.5 pts a game vs our 11 pts a game.. next best defense is the Raiders giving up 15 a game..

Point is.. we are the most balanced team in the NFL bringing the most explosive offense with a TOUGH defense, neither has to be perfect and can give a little which is what you saw the last two weeks.. Garrett and Watt both did what they get paid for.. some of the best in the game.. on offense Chubb and Hunt are gonna get their yards on ANY night.. Watson is gonna make plays and try to win.. but nobody is putting it all together like we are right now.."
you can't fault the O line for giving up the hits to lamar by JJ. JJ is a top echelon defensive player who is capable of making any O line break down. it just is what it is. they'll get better but i'm certainly not gonna fault em for not being able to stop jj watt.
"Holy fuck.....

We got some fans on here actually complaining about the offense. Not that they played poorly, just that they didn't play good enough, despite scoring 30 points. Like...I honestly never believed that day would come. I'm an old school Ravens fan, I remember production like this was rare and appreciated. So I'm a little shocked at some of the posts I'm seeing. It's not in big numbers, yet. 

But I would like to remind old and new fans just how good we have it right now. Old fans that are complaining, remember boller and streaky flacco. That's all I'll say, new fans. Take it easy, it's 33 points. Against what I consider to be a good team, so hopefully this post puts some of the complaints I'm seeing into perspective. 

We are lucky to have Lamar.

Edit. Furthermore, the chiefs didn't do too well on offense either. More perspective for you."
I'll take the W any day of the week.  You play to win the game!!!
"Anybody that saw Boller and Flacco must literally thank their stars to have Lamar Jackson as QB right now. He is far and away the best football player in the league and let's just be thankful we have him. Flacco was streaky sure but when he stunk, he was a lot of wood under center. Literally."
"I was at work thinking ""huh off day for the offense"" then I thought ""huh I remember when we beat the Bills like 13-7 only a few short years ago."" 


Bandwagoners, man."
Agree with you but offense didnt score 30 pts. Just want to credit our D which in those days you speak of were also like our offense too! Today the D scoop n score reminded me of those days..
"We played a smart game, managed our lead and ran out clock

It may not have been big explosive passing plays, but it meant we didn't take any risks and maximised our chance of winning the game."
New fans are insufferable. Kids can't appreciate shit
"I'm happy with the comfortable W, but am concerned about IOL play and still have questions about our passing game. We did not necessarily need it today, but I still want to see what Boykin and Hollywood got. We might get a chance next week with Kansas City."
"It‚Äôs football, let‚Äôs be happy that we are getting scores from every way possible: Rushing, Throwing, Defensive turnovers. Well oiled machine"
"Honestly I‚Äôm fine with it. Shows that as a team, we can win different ways depending on how the defense is playing. Browns want to stop the run? Lamar throws for 275 and 3 touchdowns. Texans want to stop the big plays? We dink and dunk and run our way to the win. 

And it‚Äôs only week 2. We‚Äôre 2-0 while not playing our best."
Only real complaint is too many sacks. Never didn't have the lead to complain too badly.
"Idk about others but personally I was concerned just bc we saw what a well-oiled machine we were last year and we still came up short. I'm not ungrateful that we can finally expect the team to handle lesser teams, but I just get worried what will happen we go up against true championship contenders. Those teams will exploit your weaknesses"
I‚Äôm happy about the offense they are top 5 in the league just concerned about the line it‚Äôs getting Lamar killed.
"Most years, a lot of teams don't gel until after 4 games. This year, with no preseason, it may be 6 games. I'm happy with the progress, though, and look forward to more."
The bandwagon is real
I'm almost positive I heard him say he would've voted for Russ for MVP last year but he lost his ability to vote because he didn't submit his ballot the year before...... Essentially ruining Lamars unanimous mvp.  Ive spent enough time listening to him praise Pittsburgh as is. Now that.
"He is a spiteful, hateful, SOB that has consistently hated on the Ravens. Just listen to that chicken neck fuck call a Steelers/Ravens game and you'll understand that he is uber biased POS. That is the reason why I don't trust PFF one bit."
"I‚Äôve found I really like Tony Romo, Jim Nanz.

Edit: Charles Davis"
"I believe a few people voted Russ all-pro but didnt dare vote for anyone else for MVP, I don't think Collinsworth was one of them though. 

He is hella biased in his commentary though for the team he prefers."
And he would have been the lone idiot. There was no one last year that was even remotely close to Lamar. There is just no arguement to be made for anyone else.
What can you expect from a sad and ringless former bengal? A team who‚Äôs only job is to spite the AFC division leader.
"People who think MVP just means ""Elite quarterback with the worst teammates"" are wrong and stupid and bad."
chris collinsworth reminds me always of the gimp from pulp fiction.
Lamar is still better then Wilson.
"Yeah, I heard this too and was like what?? Then he was laughing like yah I WOULD have been that one guy.. oh well

Bah"
"Besides all the comments here about bias, my biggest beef with Collinsworth is he's shitty at his job.  He'll say stuff like ""That looks like a catch, but I don't know what a catch is any more.""  Dude, it's your fucking job!  How about you look up the goddamn rule and learn what a fucking catch is!

Edit: If I told my boss, ""These JavaScript libraries keep changing, I don't know how to code anymore."" I'd be fucking fired."
Hey wait as an old time fan I love Chris Collins Collinsworth and he has always always had the ravens back as much as a color guy can.  He called both our superbowls before we even got to the playoffs

Lamar was voted a unanimous MVP. I think he got his recognition.
"Lamar got plenty of praise once the season was underway last year. He was unanimous MVP.

Russell Wilson is arguably the best QB playing right now and he's a good dude. Deserves every bit of it."
"If you're going by that broadcast, than yea, Collins would suck Wilson's dick dry if he could. But right now, Wilson is dominating. His numbers are ridiculous. 

Praising one QB is not a knock on another."
"> lamar never got this type of praise even when he was going on a historic run last season, never this type of adulation, 

Lol wut?  Did you not watch the games or follow the media last year?  

Yes, a lot of people are saying that it's Wilson's 'turn', but his play so far has been worthy of being considered.  It's a long season, and if awards were given in the preseason, the Browns would have won the Superbowl last year."
"People were all over Lamar‚Äôs dick man.

"Russell‚Äôs that good, though."
"Let's not have conspiracy theory crap here please. Once the Ravens beat the Seahawks last year, it was nonstop praise for Lamar last year or did you just conveniently forget that?"
"Maybe you‚Äôre looking too into it, granted Russ was receiving a lot of recognition last season too and rightfully so he was doing great too. But Lamar did unanimously win MVP, there‚Äôs no more recognition than that, and you‚Äôd see a highlight of Lamar posted every chance the NFL could post it. Russ is just playing insane at the moment and hopefully he can continue, cause he‚Äôs a baller and a great person."
"Lamar was unproven at that point, and announcers/media just play it safe. They know Russ is great, so they don't have to really face the music if he ends up playing poorly enough to lose MVP or MVP Votes. 


Of Drew Lock or Haskins came out this season playing like Wilson did, they wouldn't get the hype from media people because the media people do not have much to work with from other seasons.


Lamar did get hype pretty early on though."
"Dude. There are MANY other players in the league who excell. Russell Wilson is playing incredibly well right now. The dude is making insane throws. His production with the O-lines he‚Äôs had is amazing. Lamar is doing Lamar things, he was the Unanimous MVP last year, it‚Äôs ok for other people to get attention. 

The media slobbed on our knobs *all* last year, Lamar won player of the week I dont know how many times. Like yes, Lamar has faced adversity for how he sounds but this just seems like a bit of a stretch to me."
Lamar never got praise? What is this man talking about? He literally got the MVP lol
Let‚Äôs not be like Seahawks fans last year. There is no reason to shit on Russ to try and prop up Lamar. Let Russ get his well deserved hype and focus on the Ravens.
"Little known fact. 

The announcers are supposed to talk about the teams on the field at the game they are assigned to."
Wilson has earned it for the time being.
"Lamar was the talk of the league all last season. Russell Wilson has been in the league for a long time and is finally getting credit where it's due. He deserves it, he's an excellent QB."

I thought this was the best play all day!  Even the receiver thought he had it.  You can see him close his hands in anticipation of the catch and Juiceman snatched it out from in front of him.
That‚Äôs a straight Ed Reed play. Make an amazing catch and immediately get up and look around to see where he‚Äôs gonna run for a TD. MP is just a baller man.

"After 2 weeks, this guy has stood out for me.

He looks so fast.

Can‚Äôt wait to see his progression throughout the year."
"He had a lot of good plays yesterday, including some that won't show up on the stat sheet. His coverage on the TE on the early 4th down play that led to Ricard's TD was great; that was a pick six if Watson makes a better throw. And I counted at least twice when Watson could have scrambled for an easy conversion on third down but Queen took a good angle and cut him off with his speed. 

Zero stats on all those plays but each potentially could have altered the course of the game.

He needs to work on playing downhill and David Johnson shook him to get wide open, though Watson overthrew him badly. But he was billed as being really fast and really smart and so far we've seen that shine through."

"That can't be right, when you sort it by division we're leading because we have a division game in hand and better conference record, then when you sort by league we're ahead of them again and best in the AFC."
They aren‚Äôt according to the NFL App we are first in the AFC.
That‚Äôs not even true nor would it matter at all if it was.

They changed it to a free coffee on game days. So you still get a fee one but it‚Äôll usually be on sundays now.
I'm from SC and we used to get like 1.99 glazed dozen donuts after Panthers win. Just so happened they made the SB that year and we haven't had it since
"Do you see the Qb we have now? 

He looks like he only plans on losing 1-2 game a year.

So to answer your question, yes!

Go Ravens üòé"
It‚Äôs free coffee on ravens game days now. I got mine yesterday üòé
Does anyone have info on this guy for the Texans? He was all over the field in the game yesterday making shoe string tackles against 2-3 blockers with no backup. Probably saved over 100 yards of offense. I saw 2018 3rd rounder but we should go after this guy for our team. Looks like a straight playmaker. Wears a good number too
That play where he fought off Andrews' block to tackle Lamar in the fourth was nasty. If he doesn't a) break past a man 50 pounds heavier than him and b) tackle one of the most elusive runners in football then Lamar was going to take that 80 yards to the house and we'd have gotten a nice half-quarter of RGIII.
"Definitely had a good game today, but he got juked for a touchdown by a rookie RB last week.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W2F9DNnkpVA"
It was crazy because that dude kept up with Lamar most of the game.  Every time he tried to turn the corner for a big gain he was right there!
Yeah Reid looked good. As did watt and Hargraves.
"So now we're gonna ask EDC to sign every player that has a good game vs us?

Smh"
And Justin Tucker putting an end to the dumbass debate Nantz and Romo started. Still can't believe these guys acted like Tucker didn't even exist
[deleted]
It's a new kicker every year that someone says is better and then by the end of the year it's clear that justin Tucker is yet again the best kicker in the league.
"Man, I want to like Romo but he's got no love for Baltimore"
"Meh, Tucker‚Äôs suffering from the MJ effect: he‚Äôs so damn good for so damn long, the media‚Äôs rushing to find someone else that‚Äôs close to Tucker‚Äôs level to generate clicks. Other kickers have tried to claim the prize of GOAT kicker, and they‚Äôve all fallen, one by one.

Plus. Tucker‚Äôs got it easy now with Lamar (and Harbaugh embracing analytics on 4th downs.) He used to have to m kick 50+ yd field goals 7-10 times a season with Flacco. He only had ONE last year with Lamar starting every game. That‚Äôs insane."
"I love how personally we are taking this. You may insult my mother, and you may insult my children, but you will not insult my kicker and survive this day!"
"i would be okay with Ravens v Chiefs games just being a kicking competition. No game, just 2 special teams units going at it."
What was the stat the announcers made in game? Like 64 field goals in a row when the distance is under 40? That's some legendary stuff right there.
How insecure are we that we are hoping an opposing kicker misses kicks so our kicker looks better. Let Tucker's performance speak for itself. I hope Butler makes multiple 50 yarders and Tucker just out kicks him. Besides Butker misses too many XPs to be compared to Tucker. His FG kicking is very good but his XP% is league average.
Idiots do as idiots see. Fish in a pond syndrome.
"Apparently Chiefs kicking unit have been caught possibly cheating.

"30 minutes of him and cam just saying big truss 100 different ways, sign me up"
"Cam Jordan is hilarious and one of my favorite non-Ravens, I don‚Äôt know if the internet is ready for this lol"
I really don't listen to podcasts.....but I'm going to 100% listen to this
Thank you lord two of the funniest giving us the content that 2020 desperately needs
I need this in my life.
Fellas the podcast is pretty good. First episode was Kamara. He talked about having to play hurt under Nick Saban and he just couldn't. Talked about junior college and how it was a horrible experience. I like Kamara a lot. Cool personality but he doesn't show accountability for his actions. Nothing is ever his fault. The Hollywood Brown episode dropped today and Ill check it out tonight.
"I don't wanna sound too entitled. Ravens won but something was off. Was it because the Llama got too many sacks? Or Llama didn't throw dimes like he did against the browns.


Something feels off."
"Lamar‚Äôs passing was still great in this game.

The issue is the offensive line. Lamar is not getting a clean pocket, and the running game is getting very little help.

Outside of a few games, we have a very easy regular season schedule. The team is talented enough that poor O-line play will not sink us. But if this is not addressed in time for the postseason, then we‚Äôre in trouble."
"Interior of the offensive line is a liability.

Outside linebackers are also avg, at best.  
Every team has its weaknesses, those are the most glaring ones that I see after 2 weeks.

I just hope the line doesn‚Äôt get Lamar injured."
"The interior is a problem.  There's a mid-level prospect, a guy recovering from a major knee injury and a rookie in there, whereas last year the rookie's spot was filled by a sure-fire Hall-of-Famer.  Stanley is also playing injured, but the sack he gave up yesterday wasn't his fault.  Lamar just chose the wrong lane and ran himself into that one.  Brown struggled with Watt, but Watt is also the toughest test he'll have to face this year.  Man is a mutant.  

There were a lot of pass plays called, but the Texans threw a lot of eight-man boxes up there, so as much as I don't like it, it was still the right choice.  In the end, this was a classic Ravens game, with the run game and defence being the tools by which we won, even though the pass game brought in some big plays.    

I really didn't like their goal line moves in the fourth though, with around five minutes left.  Instead of just lining up power, they used outside runs that went out of bounds, including a Lamar run which was about the worst possible play in that situation, because either Lamar has to go out of bounds and stop the clock or has to take a big hit.  In a three score game its not the end of the world, but setting bad habits is never good."
"I feel like Lamar should be changing the protection at the line more by now. Even though some of the sacks Phillips and Brown straight up got beaten.

But I think we were Ok. Poorly is a stretch. Texans were playing not to get blown out and go 0-2. Most teams know about Lamars speed now especially the Texans after last season, they locked on to Andrews all game long and  [Zach Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zach_Cunningham) job was basically to get to the sideline before Lamar if he scrambled. That man was dead tired by the 4Q thats why those runs started coming in Chunks and the end. The first 3Q was Houston playing on all Madden and it still wasn't enough to beat us. They were so tired they're lucky we ran out of clock if that game was 5 mins long it might have ended 50-16"
"Here is exactly why it feels like we played shitty, especially offensively. We only scored 2 offensive touchdowns, one of which was only a 34 yard drive that was set up from a turnover. 

Here‚Äôs why we shouldn‚Äôt worry. We had 8 drives (excluding the last one that was just to milk the clock out). 5 of those drives we went at least 58 yards. Yes 4 of those 5 drives only ended in field goals and not touchdowns, but the Texans D is a top half D in the league with some top playmakers, and really did their homework in shutting us down near/in the red zone. Then of course we had the 34 yard drive TD, which only leaves 2/8 drives that didn‚Äôt come away with points. Us scoring on 75% of drives is an even higher rate than last year, where we averaged scoring 58% of drives. It still fields weird because of the more FGs as the breakdown of this game was 25% TD/drive, 50% FG/drive when we averaged 40% TD/drive 17% FG/drive last year."
We had 16 rushing yards in the first half. We finished with around 230 rushing yards. This both greatly excites me and greatly worries me.
The offensively line play has been poor. Yanda is missed.
We didn't run the ball early in the game. Lamar had his runs but we didn't feed the running backs. It always feels like we aren't as efficient if we don't run the ball early in the game.
"Oline definitely is our weakest group, especially the right side. Good thing is, barring injury, they should get better as Phillips develops as a player and they work on their cohesion, but yeah, no Yanda hurts us bad."
"The offense line was bad and while they ran a lot in the second half when they were up a bit, in the first half they forgot their strength is still running the ball.  LJ was running for his life."
"As others pointed out, the OLine isn‚Äôt what it was last year. And it‚Äôs not just about the rookie. The whole unit just doesn‚Äôt look as good compared to last year. Nothing to panic about just yet, though. Chiefs next week and Washington (whose DLine was amazing Week 1) the week after will be a good test.

Also, maybe it‚Äôs just me, but it seemed like Watson started to find the right guys to pick on in coverage, especially when Tavon went down. Queen, Averett, Levine, Elliot, all seemed to me like they got targeted often in coverage."
"Would just like to point out that the stretch of dominance where we demolished the Texans, Rams, Jets etc all in a row was not something you should expect to see again for a long time. 

Great teams find ways to win even when they aren't firing on all cylinders.

With that said yeah this team very clearly needs help in the interior OL and secondary depth. We've still got guys on the team we could try and fill those spots with and I trust EDC to make moves if we continue to struggle."
"If the oline doesn't get their shit together, we're not going to be opening up the deep game this year. Lamar needs more time to throw. 

But at the same time, he's been getting blitzed at a pretty high rate. He needs to recognize this, and either make a shift, or stop standing in the pocket to get drilled. If Watson can roll out and avoid a sack, surely the best running QB (maybe the best runner) in the league can do the same."
O-line needs to be taken care of
The O-line will need to improve.
"Yeah to add to what everyone else is saying, yes we have played poorly but despite that we‚Äôve still had double digit wins and really actually dominated. Once this team starts to gel and play better think how scary they can be."
The interior O-line is not playing well as everyone mentioned. The good news is that since we have such an amazing QB it hasn‚Äôt affected us too much since he is so good at escaping and running to the outside. If we had any other QB we would have been struggling to get any yardage the whole game.
"Can anyone say they're too surprised to see the hole left by Yanda... I mean really? 

Guess which side most of those sacks came from. 

I dont think it's an issue we need to be too worry about. Like yeah, there is a weakness there. But it's not downright a hindrance like other teams oline problems. Hell the texans oline was worse than ours. Watson took 13 hits yesterday."
Definitely our offensive line looked off
"Pass protection was bad this game. You're definitely not alone in that.

We also initially was having issues with putting pressure on Watson (though we got to him a lot in the second half) and with Tavon going down, our CB position look thin af again"
Does anybody know why we put tyre Philips in immediately? We have DJ fluker who's a vet. Tyre needed to sit for a little at least. It just doesn't make sense to me.
"They certainly did. I felt the air of melancholy as I woke up this morning. Typically after a Ravens win, I feel energized and happy. We played very poorly in all phases. To give up 16 points to the Texans and score only 33 is pathetic by our standards."
Expect one of two positions to be filled very soon via a trade by EDC. O-line and/or CB.
"You're not wrong. Stat watchers claiming we ran all over em didn't watch the game, we put up 100 rushing yards in trash time, until the 4th we were struggling bc o-line. If it weren't for the turnovers the game could have gone very different. D deserves a lot of credit more than anyone IMO."
"Some of those sacks should be attributed to Lamar holding the ball too long, but Tyre Phillips is a huge liability at RG, and Skura and Orlando Brown are a bit shaky around him."
Not every game is gonna be played perfectly. There were multiple changes to the offensive an defensive lines. There‚Äôs going to be a period of adjustments...posts like these make you sound like patriot fans when they don‚Äôt get their way.

"Hey Flock,

I haven't seen any information about whether we signed someone and/or brought someone up from the practice squad to fill Tavon's roster spot. Anyone have info on that?"
Like it or not Anthony Averett is next man up.
Ya as soon as I wipe my ass I‚Äôm gonna give John a call and see wtf is up
Judon in the slot.
Clearly gonna give averett a chance to fail and if he gets murdered by mahomes i would expect a trade
I hope Averett can play decent in the slot. That‚Äôs so important for our defense because IMO it is a waste of our best player by using Humphrey in the slot. I don‚Äôt see why Averett can‚Äôt become a decent nickel. He‚Äôs fast as shit and has been in the system for 3 years now. To me it seems his biggest weekend is tracking the ball in the air down field
[removed]
I don't think they make a move on a significant talent unless it becomes a habit of Averett getting torched every week
"I think what you're asking isn't necessarily who is replacing him on the field (Averett & Humphry in the slot). I haven't heard/seen them officially place him on the IR, so they wouldn't have added anyone else to the roster yet until that move is made."
Jimmy and MP on the outside Marlon in the slot averett on the 4th
"I‚Äôm expecting us to go with Marlon in the slot, Jimmy and Marcus on the outside against Mahomes. Anything else is too risky. They will put Hill in the slot and absolutely destroy us like that if we do anything else. 

The next couple weeks I think it‚Äôs worth seeing what we have with Dorsey and Bonds. Think we‚Äôll still see some of Marlon in the slot, and some Averett on the outside too, but we‚Äôre all of a sudden really thin at corner outside of our starters (counting all of Jimmy, Marcus, and Marlon as starters. 

If Dorsey and Binds aren‚Äôt passable, which I think is likely, I‚Äôd like to see us make a move for a slot corner at the deadline."
"If you are talking about just sole roster spot - it is EDC's way to wait until the last second to make the changes, since they are 99% bringing someone up from PS it is a super easy transfer so he is going to wait until monday afternoon to make the transaction so the chiefs have to take some minutes to mule it over that much closer to game time.

At this point it could be Alaka (ST) or one of the 2 slot corners we have in PS -CB Terrell Bonds or Khalil Dorsey which are both more of the slot archetype.

As for who is going to step into his role on the field - it very much is looking like it is going to be Averette with a possibility of Smith moving back to outside corner and Marlon going to slot again like last year but it seems like the FO is committed to trying to keep Marlon outside, Smith as more of a Safety and Averette as a Slot.

Now people have been complaining about Averette being picked on so far, but if you look at it out of the vaccuum teams have a choice of throwing to: Marcus Peters (ball Hawk), Marlon Humphrey (Falcon Punch), or this other CB.... the other CB is almost going to get all the looks. I think Averette looks worse on the eye test just because we have been spoiled with the last couple of years of having 4+ really good corners so even just taking a step down to good looks bad.

"Big Brain Wink - planting that billion dollar seed in Mahomes' agent's mind so his next contract extension will be higher than the entire salary cap, thereby eliminating the Chiefs from fielding a team."
üçª Respect that. Ravens and KC has next level QB's
You don't need to know how to split an atom to pick on Anthony Averett.
Sounds like Bellichick's strategy last season - talk up the competition before embarrassing them. Let's hope it works out that way and not the way it did when he talked up Lamar.
"Ravens DC Don ""Wink"" Martindale on Mahomes: ""He's at that football IQ level of Brady, Manning and those kinds of quarterbacks. ... They could have paid him a billion and I'd still think he's underpaid.""

I'm trying to nitpick at his performances to find some tangible differences that will knock him down a peg... but I can't.  QB vs QB, I'm not ready to put much weight on their postseason records just yet.  It's a team game.  Neither is out there throwing stupid interceptions causing their team to lose.  It takes a village to win.  All that went right for Mahomes will also go right for Lamar in the post season.

I truly hope these guys become the next Brady vs Manning, going tit for tat for the next 10+ yrs.  It makes the game that much more entertaining.  I want to be deathly afraid of the Ravens.  The gif wars have been fantastic.  But the comments that a few people leave sometimes are borderline cringeworthy.  95% of the script is hilarious for both teams, but you have that one guy who needs to nitpick on the 5% and get all defensive, mainly over a stat.  

I love Mahomes.  And I'm loving Lamar.  I wanted to paint him as another Michael Vick or Cam Newton... great, but not legendary.  But he completely won me over last season when he wore the white sleeves and glove after the skin color comments.  Gangsta move which made me a fan.  Hoping for both QBs to make highlight reel plays and for a nail biter of a game.  Will make the AFC Championship rematch In January that much more drama filled."
The same to you sir. May our otherworldly quarterbacks continue to dominate together and entertain against one another for years to come.
Most of us feel the same.  You can appreciate both QBs.  What a time to be a fan of either team!
Much love man. Mahomes arm and football iq is unparalleled so is Lamars athletic ability. Both make great plays and have great arms.
"I think Lamar mahomes and Russ are the top 3 QBs and any order of them is acceptable IMO, I‚Äôm just happy all three are so likeable I‚Äôm rooting for mahomes every other day except Monday and the playoffs"
"truzz Chiefs ü§ûüèΩü§ûüèΩ may our QBs stay healthy and have long, entertaining careers"
"Same here.  I want to hate Mahommes but I just can't.  These 2 QBs are changing the game and hopefully they have a long but friendly rivalry.   
Keep the gifs coming.

"He‚Äôs the only priest I‚Äôve ever loved - what a great back. If I recall correctly he had a similar injury to Bo Jackson. Are there Chiefs fans trying to claim Suggs as our own?  That‚Äôs absurd. I guess we could do the same with Joe Montana.

Edit - now I see what you were talking about - that is a funny picture of Suggs."
>:[
"This isn't Koolaid or hyperbole. It is simply a fact. Lamar's incredible electricity running the ball blinds people to his otherworldly skills in passing the ball and seeing the field and leading the offense. All his weapons save Snead are rookies or on rookie contracts. Not so much the other supposed QB competition. What Lamar can do (demoralize and devastate opponents) nobody can do. 

Sure some can throw a flier every now and then, that highly paid receivers can catch and win a game for them, but consistently nobody can take over a game like Lamar Jackson. His humility, work ethic, dedication to winning, focus, athleticism, ability to make no name players pro-bowlers, the way his teammates go out to bat for him and his sheer talent make him incomparable. You just need to remove those jaundiced eye glasses to see it. 

By season's end he'll be having his 'Say my name' moment to all the naysayers/doubters/skin color bigots and the rest of the Polian fan club members!

Why wait folks? Just say his name now! LAMAR JACKSON! LAMAR JACKSON! LAMAR JACKSON!!!!!"
"You're definitely the biggest Lamar homer on this sub lol, but I love it, hope you're right on all your posts"
I know this is just hyperbole but it does feel like we‚Äôre only seeing the tip of the iceberg when it comes to how he can perform.
"I really think he‚Äôll end up as an all time great. This generations Steve Young, but faster."
"Lamar can take over a game. But so can Mahomes. Ive seen him do it. Does Mahomes have more talented and distinguished receivers yes. But Mahomes and Lamar are neck and neck. Obviously I choose my QB but you are discrediting Mahomes. 

Side note I really wish ET wasn't such a bitch and just bought into the culture. Hes still probably the best free safety in the world. We went from a mostly cover 1 defense to a cover 2 or 3 the moment we lost him. Clark being versatile and smart as fuck makes the loss less noticeable but if we didn't have Clark we would be exposed in the secondary even if the 3 great corners we have still healthy played perfectly."
Yea...he had a solid  year. I wish it would‚Äôve worked out.
"He could just be a pocket passer and he would be one of the best in the league. Dudes a phenomenon, and still under-rated."

"I remember reading a scouting report on JO coming out of UCLA saying something to the effect of ""Ogden is so dominant that he could play most games with a cup of coffee in one hand and not miss a beat."" Pretty goddamn accurate summation of the man's NFL career too."
On top of how talented and dominant he was it seems like he's one of the chillest and nicest guys around. I saw him at the stadium on the lower concourse in the beer line for some random November game a few years ago. I was about to go say hi and ask for a pic but a couple guys got to him first and I didn't want to start a line or commotion and bother him. They showed him on the jumbotron later in the game and he was in fact just sitting in the lower bowl with the rest of the plebs. You have to be down to earth to be a guy so instantly recognizable and sit with the fans without any privacy.

"**\*\*Long Post Warning**\*\*

With our upcoming game against the defending Super Bowl champions, I was reminded of a conversation I had with a coworker back in 2010 about the Ravens.  He wasn't a fan, and he was constantly talking trash to me about that year's team, and how they weren't as good as their record, etc.  We played the Saints late that season, who were coming off their Super Bowl win the year previous.  They were 10-3 coming into the game against us in Baltimore, and meanwhile the Ravens were a strong contender at 9-4.  The Ravens won the game (it was an excellent game, I recommend trying to find it or watching the highlights [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQBtvIFO-2w), seriously the Lance Moore catch is one of the craziest I've ever seen).  I remember throwing it in my coworker's face--here was proof that we were a legit team, knocking off the defending champs.  Was it empirical or definitive? No, but it felt good either way.

So I decided to look at the history of how the Ravens fared when they have faced the defending Super Bowl champions, and then I did it for the rest of the league as well, to see how the Ravens were in comparison.  Had they played more/less games against champs, and how did their record compare?

To start, the Ravens have played 10 games in their 24 seasons against the defending NFL champions.  In those games, we are 6-4 in those 10 games, with an average final score of 23.1 - 20.3 Baltimore, though the variance is quite high (with a few blowouts both ways).

In addition, to try to account for the Super Bowl hangover, I looked at the record of the teams coming into their game with the Ravens.  Some teams fell off after their championship win ('06/'09 Steelers), while others rebounded strongly and contended again ('04 Patriots, '07 Colts, '10 Saints, and last year's Patriots).  All in all, the average winning percentage of the defending champs going into their game with us was .696, or about the equivalent of an 11-5 team.  The variance was much lower in this number, as the vast majority of teams were at least decent-to-pretty good.

Then, I decided to do the same for all teams during two timespans: from 1996-present (since the Ravens have existed) and 2002-present (since realignment AKA the entire existence of the Texans).  For the Ravens, this did not matter, since their first game against a SB Champ came in 2004, but it did have a bigger effect on other teams.

[Team Records Vs. Defending Champs \(1996, 2002-Present\)](https://imgur.com/a/h5LU8ax)

As seen above, no matter which time period you look at, the Ravens are the 3rd best team in the NFL in playing against defending champs, in each case behind New England and Kansas City (whose pre-2002 numbers are helped by a sweep of the woeful post-Elway '99 Broncos, who ended up 6-10).  As you can see, most teams did play a high level of competition though, with only the Saints facing a losing-record defending champion on average.  Most hovered around the 11-5, 12-4 range, exactly on par with Baltimore's opponents.

We also see a level of dominance by the AFC, with the best six records against champs coming from our conference.  This is partly due to an edge to AFC Super Bowl champions in this time period (15-10), and therefore more opportunity to pick up wins for teams in their conference.  And while the usual suspects like the Lions, Jets, Redskins, and Cardinals are near the bottom, there are also some interestingly good teams there, speaking to their relatively recent rise/return to prominence (like the 49ers and Texans).

So what does all this mean for Monday night? Absolutely nothing, these stats are of course completely meaningless, just like the Lamar's history in primetime games or Mahomes' record against us.  However, they were fun to put together and hopefully are of interest to someone.  And, to go back to that 2010 Saints game for just a moment: That was a game in Baltimore against a high-flying passing offense, led by a quarterback who had just won Super Bowl MVP, meanwhile the Ravens ground game was led by smaller, powerful running back who wore #27 and caught balls out of the backfield, and our defensive lineman wearing #93 was swatting down and intercepting balls at the line of scrimmage.  Coincidence? Well, yes, obviously.  But also, maybe not...



TL;DR: Ravens record re: returning ring-receivers? Resplendent, ranked right in rear of recent rivals.

Nate Burleson is the Truth. He calls it as he sees it. This was a great analysis of Lamar's spectacular anticipation on his throws. Leading his receivers to an area where he is going to throw the ball and not vice versa. That is the hallmark of the really great pocket passing QBs. This reminds me of the time when MJ added the fadeaway jumper to his repertoire and became unstoppable.

Such freezing cold takes as: if Lamar loses Monday (at age 23) there‚Äôs ‚Äúno practical way‚Äù he will ever even his career record against Mahomes.  Or focusing on how the Chiefs haven‚Äôt given up many QB rushing yards in 2 games but ignoring completely that they have been gashed in total rushing yards.  Smh. Do better.

Browns are over .500 for the first time in 6 years by barely beating the 0-2-1 Bengals and only winning by 2 scores after being +5 in turnovers against the WFT.

Bengals are 0-2-1 losing to Tyrod Taylor and a missed field goal, losing to the Browns while Burrow was pummeled or running for his life the entire game, and just tied against the 0-2-1 Eagles.

Raiders decided they are who we thought they are and won't end up really competing for the division against KC. Chiefs gonna cakewalk through their division and will probably lock up their playoff spot by week 10.

Fuck our purple bros for choking away the Titans game.

Tomorrow is probably the most important game of the season for us must win no excuses we‚Äôre at full strength. It‚Äôs time for Lamar and our team to shut up the narratives that we still can‚Äôt get it done in important games. Idk if this is a legacy game for Lamar but it‚Äôs no doubt going to be very important for seeding later on.
Still 3 and 0 and the Ravens have a tough game tomorrow.

50/50 chance
"The odds aren‚Äôt great, but they‚Äôre in our favor!"
55/45 ravens
We‚Äôre probably the only team in the League that has much of a chance.
"I'd say that this is our best shot since the Lamar-Mahomes era started. I didn't pick us last year or the year before, but I'm taking us in this one - with a convincing victory."
"I think the Ravens have the best shot. Our linebackers can‚Äôt tackle for üí©. If the ravens run outside, they will control the game and wear out the good defenders we have. Will be close early, ravens will have the opportunity to pull away at the end. Lamar could choke (unlikely), Mahomes could destroy you (more likely) overall should be fun but I expect to be sad tomorrow. Go Chiefs!"
I'm going 45% chance. I'd give them the slight edge
"I think it‚Äôs a lock... we‚Äôre better, we‚Äôre home, we need it more... of course any given Sunday.... but we are better in almost every area. Ravens by 14"

1) Both teams defenses step up and make this a lower scoring game than is being predicted. There will be flashy plays, but not crazy scoring. 

2) Lamar will throw 3 TD passes, all to different WRs.  

3) CEH runs all over our defense, and Mahomes will make plays with his legs as well. The secondary will clamp down however and limit the passing totals. I say the chiefs will run for over 100 yards, but throw for less than 250."

"Jesus man... Chiefs fan here and first wanted to say I'm sorry... hitting midlife myself and have been unusually paranoid about things like this (or cancer), I figure it all part of the mortality game, but god damn I didn't even know fatal insomnia was a thing.

There are a lot of sports fans who are of the opinion that if ""you're not first your last,"" and having watched Andy Reid and Alex Smith play VERY good football but not win it all for several years in a row created a huge divide in the fanbase over here... I was happy to be above .500 and have a legitimate shot at a super bowl with a little luck every year (edit: ok, maybe just to playin the AFC champ. game lol). Other fans were ready to run the entire administration out of town... which just blows my mind. Some fans have lived and died without every seeing their team win it all! and selfish people are happy with that as along as their team doesn't come in 2nd place. Maybe I'm a sap, but one of my first thoughts after we did win was ""damn, I wish more people got to experience this... football doesn't want or need another dynasty team.""

I'm truly sorry you don't get to see Lamar get his ring, I'm pretty sure he will eventually! However,  I'm also VERY happy for you that you got to see some championship teams in your lifetime.

In hindsight: This wasn't meant to be a ""just be happy you got to see them win"" post, far from it, and I hope you don't take it that way... just thinking about the extreme joy that we can get from such silly things like sports and wishing everyone could be onboard with the love like the Ravens reddit fans have been this year and last, and probably before... you folks have been great."
"I'm so sorry man. I've seen you comment so much on here and I know how much you love this team. You deserve so much better.

God bless you fr."
"Coming from a Steelers fan, I'm sorry to hear this bro. I don't know what all I can say, but I hope you find some form of peace in however long you have left. I'm sorry you have to go through this."
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear this man. I‚Äôll cheer extra loud for the Ravens in your honor.
Fly high raven bro Ill meet you at ball so hard uni soon stay strong friend.
Bless your soul my friend. I hope you and Mo watch the Ravens win it all in heaven. You and your loved ones will be in my thoughts. God bless you man.

"fuck dude, maybe on the other side you can be a Raven or go haunt the steelers"
I'm speechless. I don't know what to say. Just know that all of us are thinking about you and hope you find peace.
"Shit man, I don't know what to say. I don't know you personally but I've seen you around here for a long time. If there's anything that can be done to help you go out with a bang don't hesitate to reach out. Try to keep your chin up brother."
Godspeed brother
We need to get the Ravens organization to see this somehow
I‚Äôm so sorry man. I don‚Äôt know your story but I hope that you can find peace and enjoy whatever time you have.
Hey man do you have people in your life to make these last few weeks/months great? Go do things you never thought you‚Äôd do like sky diving or something.
"This is horrible man. I‚Äôm extremely sorry. If there‚Äôs anything we can do, please let me know. Shoot me a message even. 

My deepest condolences."
Damn man. Hope they get you some great game wins to go out on. Flock is here with you!
This is terrible. So sorry to hear this. You've always been a lively contributor to this sub. After reading skme of your comments it seems you are mostly at peace with this. I hope you are able to comfortably enjoy the time you have. Rest easy
Have fun on the other side. Sorry your time in this one is ending earlier than you thought. Go Ravens
"Godspeed dude, flock forever"
So sorry to hear buddy. Enjoy what‚Äôs left the best you can.
My dude :(
"I am so sorry to hear about that. Hopefully you‚Äôll get to see some fun ones before you go. Idk what you believe in, and I don‚Äôt want to disrespect whatever that is, but I believe that you‚Äôll get to watch us win the Super Bowl right next to Mo. üñ§"

Play like a Raven everyday from here on out, bro."
"Very heavy heart for you, bird bro. Wishing you the absolute best for your time left and you can trust that if lamar doesn‚Äôt get one for you to witness this January, Ill pour some out and celebrate your memory when he finally does"
Does anyone have OPs contact info? I got in touch with the team and want to pass it on. I‚Äôm a little worried because I haven‚Äôt heard back. Thanks.
You still there Ravens bro?
"Idk If you'll ever be on here again, but I just wanted to to know that people here were thinking about you.

Gos bless man."
Fuck... sorry to hear this bro.
"Fuck that. I am so sorry dude, life just aint fair. Surround yourself with loved ones"
I‚Äôm praying for you. üòûüôè
This sucks and I‚Äôm so sorry. Don‚Äôt know what else to say. It‚Äôs just not fair at all.
Best of luck to you. I hope you enjoy your life to its fullest. I'm pulling for you
I don‚Äôt understand how hard this must be. Can you tell me some of the symptoms if you don‚Äôt mind? It‚Äôs so crazy to think there‚Äôs someone who literally can‚Äôt sleep

"Yup, we looked like shit on Monday. We played bad and our weekneses were exposed.

But it's time to move on. Id rather we lose in week 3 to the best team then in week 20. Let's lick our wounds, learn from our mistakes and go kick some washington ass. 

The loss sucked but we will be better for it when we meet again in the playoffs. It's good to be the underdogs anyways. 

On to Washington."
"Right.. I think people are dwelling over this too much or had way too high expectations. We lost, it‚Äôs part of football. The Chiefs are truly an elite team and it came down to a couple very key plays that decided the outcome. We didn‚Äôt play the greatest game but it was still winnable. 

Learn from our mistakes and move on. Don‚Äôt dwell on the past. 

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre on to Cincinnati‚Äù"
"Yup, the chiefs kicked the shit out of us and we looked like total ass on Monday. 

Gotta lick the wounds real quick and move on. Let‚Äôs stomp those guys in the playoffs and focus on the task at hand - fucking up the WFT."

I laughed
"Stop, stop, he's already dead"
"The Steelers haven't won anything in 10 years and even then it was a AFC Championship. Stop embarrassing yourself, Ravens-Steelers is barely a rivalry - look how boring the Week 17 game was last year. We had our third stringers in and still beat your team down - your team was so bad it didn't prepare us enough to take on the Titans two weeks after. 

The Steelers look like a formidable opponent this year but please stop lol."

"Great, now pass to him."
"This guy needs to be starting, good things happen when the ball is in his hands!"
"Thanks Devin, very cool"
big dev go zoom zoom
"If Duv, Gus, and Tucker hadn't contributed their blips of happiness, I would have probably punched a hole in the wall Monday night. Still feeling sour this morning."
Dev Duv is gonna fuck shit up when he gets snaps on offense man
Is that a 21 or 27? God that‚Äôs an awful font
That‚Äôs a 3 minute mile sustained üò≥
"I want to see Duv on on side, Hollywood on the other. Lamar slings it to whichever one beats their corner. Rinse and repeat."
Him and Proche combined in college had less drops than the Ravens did during the Titans playoff game. Please give them reps on offense
He‚Äôs fuckin zoomin
"I'm super pleased by what Duv has done so far. Catches every pass throw to him, decent yac, got fuckin burners.

Proche has looked decent on the punt returns too, besides that one mistake last week with the punt"
Whos in the NFC
"What‚Äôs crazy is that as fast as he looked on that return, it makes me realize just how fast Mostert is. Mostert is the fastest ball carrier in the NFL this year, over a full MPH more than Duvernay."
Bro he ran over 20 miles per hour? What in the fuck...
Hook‚Äôem!
Duvernay has the potiental to be better than Hollywood for this scheme. My man runs like a running back and not afraid of contact at all.
Trade Boykins for anything at this point.. I get Andrews is struggling a bit but he‚Äôs been an absolute steal for us and given more time can stay an elite TE. Boykins has been trash and simply can‚Äôt run routes
"Tower, this is Ghost Rider requesting a flyby."
Interesting
That was a screaming fast return.
Maybe he should be on the field more
"Please let him start at wide receiver.

Great hands and electric speed. This is the kind of guy our offense needs."
We gotta get him and Hollywood more involved in the offense. AND NOT SCREENS we suck at those
"Yeah, and y'all still got curb stomped by Mahomes."
[deleted]
"I mean, to be fair, Wink was blitzing with corners when they had 3 WR‚Äôs that can outrun any LB in the league."
They tried everything under the sun and nothing worked. Terrible analysis.
"It was clear when we rushed we weren‚Äôt found to get to the QB. We sent 4 we sent 5, no luck. We should have dropped more men back and got more physical at the line. I get we needed some padding cause they can beat us hard over the top. But we needed to be physical."
This is a coaching issue. I‚Äôm not going to freak out yet until playoffs but something isn‚Äôt right with the game planning. No way all our players coincidently have their worse performance in the same game - 3 times in a row. Head coach is to blame for this as offense and defense looked awful.

"You know the rest

Nice quote from Jeff's recent [article](https://theathletic.com/2103903/2020/09/30/ravens-need-more-from-front-seven-big-game-narrative-and-more-observations/) 

I was among the gloomy fans who think we have no chance of beating the Chiefs if we beat them again, but this is a comforting memory"
"Whilst it‚Äôs comforting, we can‚Äôt ignore the fact there is a trend to the games we lose. And when we lose, we lose hard, on both sides of he ball."
"So much of the offensive woes are on coaching, it‚Äôs not even funny. Stick with the run. It was working all game."
"I get the point he is trying to make, but the team was keeping up with Denver in the first half. Flacco threw the pick six at the end of the first half in the redzone. It's a 10-14 point play. Flacco also chased the defender to the endzone. Although the score didn't show it, we knew we could hold our own against the Broncos if we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot. We won that playoff game cause we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot like we did a few weeks earlier.

The game from Monday night was a whooping. But I do think we are close to catching the Chiefs. We were so close to getting Mahomes so many times. If he holds on the ball .2 seconds longer on some of these attempts then we get sacks/fumbles/interceptions.

The offense also played horrible and we were somehow down a TD in this game. I think we have plenty of time to get better and prepare for KC in the AFC Championship game. Andrews played his worse game of his career. He opens ip everything for us. If he plays well then Hollywood can get deep.

The Chiefs dared the Ravens to beat them by throwing the ball. And honestly, Jackson was okay. The drops were horrible though. If our guys catch the ball then the defense can't put 9 in the box. If they don't put 9 in the box then we'll run it down their throats.

Plus, NO ONE will believe in us, which is EXACTLY where we love to be in the playoffs. This Chiefs loss is a good thing long term."
"Don't even have to look back that far. We got obliterated by the Browns at home in all three phases last year early in the season, then we turned around and beat them 31-15 in Cleveland.


You replay these games 100 times and you get 100 different results."
"Pre-facing by myself being a Pats guy fuck me fuck me BUT I have been following Baltimore since my best friend became my friend (he is all about it and TD Bank is a lot of fun) and have been subbed here for... I think 2 years, basically since I stopped lurking. I said it in the nfl sub but I think there was a lot of glitching and misfire-this team is still great, one game won't ruin that. Adjustments, film, tidying up the gameplan and I think the Ravens come out on top next time. It just looked like they weren't completely in sync-just a letdown game

&#x200B;

EDIT for paragraphs"
"I went to the that game with my Dad, it was the most I ever spent on tickets for great seats as a gift. I‚Äôll never forget, we had virtually no offense the first half until we marched down the field in a 2 minute drill before half. In the red zone, Flacco throws a pick sick and runs all the way down the field chasing and falls on his face virtually in front of us. Luckily, the next game we went to was the opening of the playoffs at home against the Colts üòà"
"This kind stuff happens all the time. Another instance that comes to mind is  2009 when we lost to New England 27-21. As we were driving down the field (hopefully to score the game winning TD) Flacco hit Mark Clayton square in the numbers only to for him to drop it for a turnover on downs. Everyone expected the playoff rematch to be a nail biter, except we dominated instead. 

Anything can happen between now and any playoff rematch (should that happen). And anything can happen in that rematch."
"Maybe we just do better as underdogs, we suck when we know we have the advantage."
"Yes, they also fired that hack of a OC Cam Cameron to give them a spark"
"And then the ravens were forced out of there home stadium for the first game after their superbowl win, as the orioles refused to change scheduling. The ravens were then shut down in Denver by a good number of Peyton manning touchdowns."
"If we beat the Titans this year, or at least lose a close game playing our brand of football, then that would be pretty comforting"
"Not trying to be a debbie downer, but we were so banged up heading to that regular season matchup. Like 4-5 starters in the divisional round game didn't play then. You can't say the same about last Monday night."
"Last home game Ive gone to - still remember that Pitta touchdown :,)"
Yeah I‚Äôm hoping the coaching staff and the players have a big chip on their shoulder after this loss.
"No offense to Jeff but that's an absurd and revisionist take. All the typical over-reactionary fans were claiming the sky was falling after that game but those with half a brain saw it was one errant pass from being a tie game at half against the Broncos. I knew Joe and that team could compete with anybody and they did. 

That said it's only week 3. Those who didn't get caught up in the hype knew this team has a few weaknesses and a loss was a pretty reasonable outcome on Monday. I certainly didn't expect it to be as lopsided as it was but much like that Broncos game you could tell there were a few key moments(Andrews and Brown combined missed out on a half dozen big plays by a few inches) that could've really swung the game. 

I'm actually more confident in this team after week 3 than I was prior to the season. We're showing last year wasn't a fluke and it's still a fairly dominant squad. If we face KC again we'll have a solid chance at winning."
"While this is comforting, let‚Äôs not forget that we played the Broncos again during the NFL kickoff game where Peyton Manning put up 7 pass TDs on us."
"I was there, Ugh. The Broncos picked 6 ran it back to the endzone right in front of my seats and I watched poor Flacco face down in the turf after trying to chase him down. lulz. We got 'em in the playoffs though!"
this is total speculation. what if the gameplan was to be very vanilla on offense and spastic on defense? to the point where the film is useless if we meet them again in the playoffs?
"Seriously though... I can't remember a QB who undergoes more scrutiny after losing to a tough team. Did he have a horrible game? Absolutely. But it happens to all the greats, and if there is anything to be learned from that loss it's that the coaching/gameplan needs to improve to make a serious run."
"There are a lot of people who planted their flags awfully deep claiming Lamar Jackson would never be a serviceable quarterback. He's given them precious few opportunities to crawl out of their caves, but they never miss a chance to beat their drum.

I don't see it from analysts very often but I see it on /r/NFL all the time."
"The Chiefs went 12-4 last year. The Mahomes-led team was beaten by IND (Week 6, 13-19), HOU (Week 7, 24-31) and TEN (Week 10, right after he came back from that nasty knee injury). 2 of those teams were in the playoffs later.

Yes, teams get the L occasionally, even the best ones. Perfect seasons are rare in the NFL. We had a historical season last year, it's almost impossible to repeat that.

1 year ago we got our ass whopped by the fucking Browns. We'll get over this too."
He is the only quarterback I've seen not allowed to have a bad game.
"Well to be fair, Mahomes is the best quarterback. And it's not even debatable"
"Drives me crazy that Mahomes had a super mediocre game last week where he missed multiple throws and allowed the dismal Chargers a chance to win the game last week.... but we heard nothing about how MAHOMES ISNT THAT GOOD or LAC DEFENSE EXPOSED MAHOMES!!!!

The next week, Lamar has an off game and the ravens still play well enough to compete with (one of, if not THE) best teams in the league.... and hot take artists come out of the woodwork to bash him.

Shits annoying as hell"
Because he lost in an ugly way. Brady faced the same criticism when he lost to the Chiefs in 2014. Sometimes Reid just has the perfect gameplan and runs over people
I blame Mahommes rapid ascension to greatness. That set the standard for Lamar especially after winning MVP last year.
"Not a Ravens fan but a big Lamar fan/believer (as should everyone be). I think it's because there are some people who are biased against his style of QB play (run first, super athletic). It's like in baseball when a knuckleballer who throws a dozen amazing games but when he has a bad day and gets hit hard or starts walking people, some come out of the woodwork and say ""There's that damn knuckleball, of course it doesn't work""."
People like to be right on there draft analysis‚Äô.
"Exactly. Lamar is still young. Pundits expect him to be perfect just because he's talented and wins a lot. He has grown a lot in his very short career already, so there's no reason to believe he won't get beyond this.

Let's also not undersell the Chiefs. They are a very well constructed and coached team. Mahomes is otherworldly and he has the extreme good fortune to have an offensive genius for a head coach. The Chiefs are going to replace the Patriots as the thorn in the AFC's side for the next generation."
Because when we lose we don't just lose we get absolutely wrecked.
"I definitely think you‚Äôre on to something. I have noticed them slam Russell Wilson for the next couple years after the second super bowl. Maybe I don‚Äôt remember correctly, though."
I feel like its partially because of how futile we look when we lose. It's kind of confounding that we look unbeatable 95% of the time then like an 0-16 team 5% of the time
"Outside this sub no one think Lamar is the best in the game. Not last week and not last year.

Mvp, for sure, deserved it, but not the best.

And for your question, idk if half the QBs in the league had such a bad Performance in their career. I know for sure PMII never did."

"People acting like we lost a playoff game.  last year after losing to KC, the Ravens went on that absolute tear. Losses humble players and I feel bad for Washington this Sunday, cause I can see the team taking their frustrations out on them"
He‚Äôs posting this because he knows everyone is freaking out about a loss.
"It isn‚Äôt about how you get knocked down, it is about how you get back up"
"TRUZZ. It's only Week 3, definitely got a lot of time to correct everything. Take this loss on the chin and move on, that's all we can do. One week at a time, we'll see KC again down the road."
"On one hand, we definitely have some issues we need to get ironed out if wanna win the super bowl, on the other hand, it‚Äôs the Kansas City fucking chiefs. Losing to them isn‚Äôt something to get fussy about. 

We just gotta fix the issues we had this past week and we gonna be Gucci. Simple"
I love this team and I have faith in the players. Less so in some of the coaches but hope I'm wrong.
BELEE
It‚Äôs hard having faith that once playoffs come we will magically find the solution to beat them ?...It‚Äôs a personal problem and scheme problem...we need more rushers to at least generate some pressure...Calais and Wolfe are good but not nearly the versions they used to be..we need a premier pass rusher to help the secondary they can only cover for so long ...also watch for Deshon Elliots progress because that could be another weakness if it‚Äôs not fixed or addressed
"Lamar Jackson is the only football player that has so much universal bias against him, that he is never allowed a poor game. Yet, he'll persevere and become the greatest football player to lace up."
"Can we talk about the expectations on Lamar in just his second season as the full time starter? I can't remember Joe Flacco having these expectations even after winning a super bowl. Flacco was drafted higher you would think expectations would've been higher he didn't have a good playoff game until 2010. I think a lot of the Lamar criticism is over dramatic, Baker is inconsistent and its cool. Sam Darnold is a walking turnover its cool. Josh Rosen is on the Practice Squad NBD. Josh Allen also imploded in the playoffs, its cool. There are 13 games left i think we'll be fine"
"People keep throwing that Lamar is 0-3 against the Chiefs at us not taking into account that the 1st game was Lamar‚Äôs what, 5th start? The offense was still a work in progress after switching from Flacco that year. Lamar has also never had a true home field advantage in these games.

Not saying we didn‚Äôt get our ass kicked, but the panic and criticism after a week three loss has been crazy. Glad Lamar has the right attitude, we will be fine!"
Lamar Jackson unfortunately will never be as good as Mahomes
[deleted]
"Holy fuck dude, clean out your email."
"I believe this team has okay rushers but we severely lack anyone who gets off the line with urgency. I believe our Edge rushers should try to time snap counts (with no crowd noise) in certain situations against very good teams (kc,Pitt, etc). If it‚Äôs 3rd down with 7/8 yards to go on the edge of field goal range for opposing team. At worst we‚Äôre in 3rd and 2/3 yards which skews to our strength as interior defenders stopping the run, or man press corners."
Timing the snap based on count is how you jump offsides. Watching the ball is drilled into pass rushers heads since rec league football
Make sure to DM Judon

"Yeah I honestly don‚Äôt think Roman can make a passing game without an established run. Until he proves us wrong, our pass offense has always been ass when we don‚Äôt run the ball, so if Harbs wants a balanced offense, start looking at younger innovative OCs instead of old guard OCs"
There are other schemes (than two ugly screen passes at the redzone) to be more productive in the passing game. A curb stomping rushing drive killed by two weak ass passes. And they panicked and settled for a FG at 4th and 3 in front of the goal line.
"I get that you don't want to be predictable on first down, but when you pass on first down and it doesn't get positive yards you're stuck passing on the next two downs most likely. The only way to slow the Chiefs is to keep Mahomes off the field. Ingram, Dobbins, Edwards, repeat. The OL wasn't helping much, but then you have to design plays to get the RBs into space."
John Harbaugh would be great in politics. Completely avoids damn near every question.
We run to setup the pass... until we don‚Äôt. And we look fucking stupid.
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to blatantly say they abandoned the run. That just throws shade on his coaching staff. Hopefully they realize and will change how they play calls when down. 

Also, start Gus."
"had a horrible thought that i hope is untrue:

greg roman is our offensive dean pees."
"If we continue to shift from our offensive identity every time we go down by three points, then I can't see Greg Roman being here much longer. It was the same issue we had in 2012 with Cam Cameron before Hue Jackson took over. I think that if it does happen, it'll be in our Week 7-11 stretch where we play the Steelers x2, the Patriots, and the Titans. We've got nearly two seasons of game tape now to showcase how important establishing the run is in this offensive scheme.  The statistic of us not winning any game after losing at halftime is because our OC panics and won't get back to the basics of this team."
"It's cool to want to be more productive in the passing game, but you do that when you can afford to.  Not when you're having your anal cavity excavated with your skirt down like a little school girl."

The difference is they get all the DBs moving around then dump a screen to kelce. In our case Andrew would just drop the ball.
We can‚Äôt run screens to save our lives. We also suck at jet sweeps for what it‚Äôs worth.

"For anyone curious, Marlon Humphrey is currently graded as our best pass rusher (73.9).  Jaylon Ferguson is currently our highest graded EDGE/DL pass rusher (65.6)."
I‚Äôve noticed our pass rushers also missing sacks in the backfield. I don‚Äôt expect them to make every sack but we gotta clean that up a bit
"This is one the small handful of issues that were obvious weaknesses on paper all off-season. 

The Ravens planned/had to rely on a few players stepping up. It hasn‚Äôt happened anywhere yet. 

Interior OL. Pass Rush/OLB. MLB. S. WR. 

The defense has a weak OLB and inexperienced MLB Corp. Its something that will have to be addressed or will cost more games. There are no star players on the team except Humphrey, Peters, Campbell. 

The OL and WR continue to cause issues stretching the field."
I really wanted us to push harder for Clowney
"We are one elite edge rusher from having easily the number 1 defence

But without that, we are forced into blitzing a hell of a lot and we still aren't getting there. Our secondary is great but can only do so much

We have to be looking at trade targets"
"Turns out relying on Judon, a 34 year old( who‚Äôs still playing amazingly, just clearly not the same pass rusher) and all of our late round draft picks on D will get eaten up by good teams"
"This is why we should have drafted one, if not two. In previous years we'd always have someone else developing in the background in case the starters left or regressed, but now the pipeline has run dry and we're in trouble."
"This was obvious last season, the offseason, and now."
I thought Bowsers been playing well
Clay Matthews is available and honestly he didn‚Äôt have a bad season last year
"Am I the only one that thinks the current unit can improve with more experience?  I mean, if you think about it, we have two new D-linemen, two new rookie linebackers with no offseason, a replacement for an injured corner, and a new safety with no playing experience. So many new guys with no offseason.

You look at the Chiefs last year and they weren't great until toward the end of the season when the defense started playing better.  There's still time for these guys to gel and improve before it really matters.  We have a really weak schedule this year, so I'm sure the defense will look good on paper moving forward, but at least that gives guys time to develop without it risking our playoff chances.  

We're probably not going to get the 1 seed, so it doesn't even matter if we lose the division to Pittsburgh as long as we make the playoffs.  We'll be playing in the divisional round either way.  Honestly, with the mentality of this team, I think we'd perform better if we came in as an underdog instead of a super hyped up juggernaut."
"Yeah our pass rush has been fucking abysmal. Turns out if you have a bad pass rush last year and you do absolutely nothing to make it better this year, it's still gonna suck!

On the bright side, Calais Campbell and Derek Wolfe have been pretty solid at stopping the run for us, so there's that..."
Oof
"Oh yeah but Judon wants 16 mil a year. So glad we franchised that guy so we can say ""yeah, no"" next year."
"Bring in Matthews, or Suggs?"
This is why we can‚Äôt play from behind and this is why we needed clowney dammit.
Everything is find on our defense we are just missing the Edge guy that blows up plays no matter how well it's defended or designed. I remember watching Suggs blitz in his prime! Change the protection all you want it won't help.
The trenches need to be the #1 priority this offseason.
"We knew this before the season and hoped the coverage would make up for it.  The interior rush actually feels stronger now but any real pressure is coming from the blitz.

It's unfortunate, but for once, the developing guys just aren't it and we also already knew Judon wasn't the answer for the kind of guy to draw doubles."
Still has me wondering why we didn't even draft an EDGE with all our mid-round picks
LOL.
Our lines in general unfortunately.
Oof
Calais looks like he's been our best rusher so far. The grading is odd.
Ill just leave.. In EDC we truzz
*psych
"Bowser and McPhee have impressed me most as pass rushers, not so much in coverage. We need to finish in the backfield though, I understand Watson and Mahomes are great at avoiding sacks but it‚Äôs damn frustrating being *that* close and then they wriggle out"
How did this happen? Weren‚Äôt we supposed to be 16-0 and shit?  Decosta has no idea what he‚Äôs doing
""
"That 14% drop rate against the Chiefs is... what the fuck? How do you account for a 10% drop rate increase like that outside of a team-wide mental collapse?

I really just don‚Äôt understand how the whole team can fail all at once."
The idea that the steelers are a top 5 team when their opponents have a combined record of 0-9 is stupid. They havent played any decent teams to earn a top 5 mark.
What cowherd said about it pretty much sums up my feelings.
"I‚Äôm just bothered by the fact that when they‚Äôre leading they seem on top of the world and unbeatable, but once they‚Äôre behind everything seems to fall apart and they go full retard. That type of shit does not lead to playoff wins"
"We're 2-1 and lost to the defending champs in week 3?

season over just pack it up"
The quick hits tweets #2&3 at the bottom are interesting.

I apologize if it's too long of a pod, but my boy was my guest on here, also we're gonna spank Washington"
"Just incase some of you dont remember back in 2012. Ravens got stomped by the Broncos who were one of the best teams in the AFC. Considering this is from the point where flacco played terrible. So the point is, dont despair over losing to KC because if we meet in the playoffs again, its a whole new game."
"They also fired the OC, Cam Cameron that sparked the offense"
"In 2000, we went a month without scorning an offensive touchdown. I think we even won 1 or 2 of those games."
Payton Manning had like an 8 game win streak against us before that game
We also got stomped by the Texans that same year
Facts we have so much talent this year also
"A whole new game which we lose again if we continue to ignore the issues we have. Simple as that. We can roll out and win the next 13 games, but if we don‚Äôt learn to compose ourselves and figure out why we shit the bed under the spotlight, we are one and done yet again."
"But is it? Because it‚Äôs been the exact same result every time we play KC and the same result when we fall behind multiple scores. We can‚Äôt generate a pass rush, what makes you think that changes come January? The team isn‚Äôt built to come from behind. Don‚Äôt use that one example from a pathetic Browns team with piss poor coaching staff to try to say they can come back from a deficit, they just can‚Äôt. 

If they can‚Äôt win at home in January, what makes people think they‚Äôre gonna go on the road, probably to KC, and pull out a victory?

Regular season wise, they‚Äôre fine. They‚Äôll still win 12+ games and win the division. But there‚Äôs no reason to believe when they play the Chiefs again, or a playoff defense, that they‚Äôre not just gonna fall flat again."
[deleted]
He seems a lot happier than I would expect. Probably due to Marlon signing an extension (?) or maybe he feels like the monkey is off our backs or maybe he‚Äôs happy we get to play Washington this week. Or maybe none of the above.
"I get it we lost, but I don‚Äôt seeing us lose more than 2 more games the rest of the year.

Let‚Äôs enjoy this, a lot of teams would love to be us."
Getting their collective shit pushed in by the Titans didn't doe?
I mean I hope this is the case and not just talk. I think he didn't want to tip his hand or throw anyone under the bus in his responses.
So it took 3 years to finally get it? I‚Äôll believe it when I see change.
""
Well that definitely wouldn‚Äôt suck
"If they get him for Tre White numbers instead of Ramsey numbers, i'll be soooo happy.

likely will be closer to Ramsey, but he'll be worth it"
" Not only is he our greatest pass defender, he‚Äôs also our best pass rusher this season!"
"I was so wrong about humphrey when we drafted him and I'm so glad to be

I wanted Reuben Foster or someone irrelevant iirc"
"Not a ton of cap savings, so not likely an a move for a big trade. Might help something smaller immediately though."
"Hell yeah, let‚Äôs fuckin go! Marlon has earned every bit of whatever he gets. Shit even if he ends up being the highest paid in the league, it‚Äôll end up being a steal in 2-3 years."
Time for Marlon to get that elite pass rusher money
Super pumped if true
Imagine how great his outfits are gonna be when he starts making way more money
Any source...?
I hope it's true. Marlon needs to be a Raven long term. He's probably the most well rounded corner in the game due to his elite coverage skills and the fact that he hits and tackles like a backer.
100% deserves it
"Big if true. Smart to do Marvin first instead of Stanley because the CB market constantly resets itself higher and higher. LT market generally stays stable for a few years, although the recent Tunsil contract did reset it quite a bit higher than it was before."
hopefully he‚Äôs fucking insane and deserves it 100 percent
Thank God I can finally buy his jersey
"Good, I hope so.  Out of home grown talent I have been saying the last week or so, Humphery, Stanley, and Bowser are the three we need to focus on this off season.

Edit:  With Bowser, we have 5 OLB, 4 of them are up for contract this year, leaving Ferguson, Ward, Judon, Mcphee, and Bowser.  We can't let our entire edge group walk.  Mcphee is older, Judon is asking way more than he is worth. Ward we should definitely try to keep, and Boswer.  Bowser would be way more cost effective than Judon.  But this is a group that needs addressing this year.  

Also, we should try to extend Andrews, I forgot about him."
Great! He deserves it!
Yes yes yes yes yes.
Very happy to have just purchased a black 44 Jersey.
"It's like the Ravens saw Judon against the Chiefs and said ""well I guess I know where Marlon's money is coming from"""
"Keeping Peters and Humphrey together for a while is great. Next, Ronnie Stanley."
wow. good call man
As long as its not Judon...Humphrey deserves it and Judon can go get paid by Cleveland like Paul Kruger or something
Why not Stanley first?
What about Stanley?
"Question, if it is indeed Marlon is he going to get payed as a slot cornerback or outside ?"
"Unpopular opinion, he should not be paid as the best in the league, i would like to lock him up and i think has an amazing skill set including perhaps the best forced fumble skills of a CB in the league.  That said, he gets away with a lot of holding, and sometimes doesn't get away with it, and I think if the deal is longer term into the point where his skills diminish that will be a mistake."
"Can anyone defensive minded describe what it is that The Chargers, Titans, and KC were doing to make Lamar so panicked? 
Are the Safeties and CB doing anything special or are the LB? Is the DL following any special scheme?

And what‚Äôs the fix? (Besides handing the ball to Gus, of course)"
"Both teams said it wasn‚Äôt so much Lamar as they just knew where the WRs were. KC said they new what general direction our WR and TEs were gonna be after a PA, and set up their zones accordingly. It‚Äôs tough for any QB to throw the ball when the defense knows where it‚Äôs gonna go"
The Bills did a better job then the Titans or KC of slowing us.
"The chiefs literally threw everything they had and the kitchen sink at us. They designed all kinds of crazy plays and trick manuvers, as if they were saving it just for us. They will probably come to regret that later, I'm not saying the chiefs weren't better. I'm saying that you don't just draw up a game plan like this so early in the season. 

You gotta keep the best tricks available for the grand finale, if anyone understands what I mean."
"I don't think Lamar was really that panicked, do you?

Just nobody open and he kept having to scramble because our OL is turnstiles"
"The Chargers game was because they knew whether it was a pass or run based on Stanley's  stance IIRC. Marty didn't change anything up between that game and the regular season Chargers game that occurred about a month before hand. The Chargers just straight up knew what to expect pre-snap.  


The other two games are more of a result of abandoning the run absurdly early and putting the game on Lamar's shoulders. The problem with that is that Lamar doesn't have a good Receiving Corps and didn't have one last year either. The run game was so good last year that they could mask it for the most part. Andrews is the sole possession receiver on this team and that shouldn't be the case. The passing attack is limited because we basically have Brown, Andrews and Ingram.   


Brown isn't the type of receiver to be put in a move the chains position, he's mainly the intermediate-deep threat option. The team needs an AB/Julio/Brandon Marshall type of receiver."
"Consistent pressure only blitzing 4. 

Look at our defense, to get pressure we need to send 5-6 guys. Good QBs can then see 1 on 1s and make tough throws. 

But when they get to drop 7 to defend Andrews, Brown, Sneed, Boykin and a spy things get tough. 

Our Oline needs to be better. I think when we domimate running our Oline gets credit when its really Lamar who should get credit. Our O line is a tad bit overrated."
"Our play callers choke in big time games..  When they don‚Äôt call it well, it leaves little room for error and if our **young** players don‚Äôt execute in those limited opportunities then things just don‚Äôt work out. It also helps that they don‚Äôt have to worry about the run as much as we tend to ditch the run the second we go down by any margin.."
[deleted]
I think we should be proud how far this team has come since 2018. There is a lot of improvements we can make but I still love my ravens!!
Why wouldn‚Äôt you be? We‚Äôre one of the best teams in the league.
2018?? Try 2015 if you want actual pain
"Appreciate the positive post. 

I think it shows how unbelievably we spoiled we are as  fanbase that ONE loss to the best team in the league - even though it WAS really ugly and raised some issues - has everyone this upset and panicking 

I look forward to Lamar and the boys hanging dong on the WFT next week and restoring the good mood among the fanbase. With WFT, Bengals, and Eagles coming up next, we have a great chance to be 5-1 going into the first Steelers game. I hope we make it happen."
"It was one game. Anyone who thought that we would actually go undefeated was kidding themselves. The only teams that can get out to that big a lead on us are the Chiefs, the Seahawks, and maybe the Packers. For my money we're favorites against every other team. Everything is going to be fine."
"I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt jump ship, but would you say you‚Äôre more concerned going forward/less confident?"
""
">he like taco bell and twitter

Ngl this got me good"
I‚Äôm searching for Mark Andrews hands too
I was raging at Judon all game but that offsides call was bullshit. After watching replays he perfectly timed the snap.
Dude isn't that good..he is a worse OG Pernell McPhee that went to the Bears.
"I wish the Ravens would get Anthony Harris from the Vikings. He‚Äôs solid and won‚Äôt cost much. Also I‚Äôm
Biased because I went to HS with him."
Thank God we didnt get stuck in a long term deal with him
The chicken chalupa bandit!
I really don't understand what happened to him between last year and this year.
"I never agreed with paying Judon, he‚Äôs average at best"
üíÄ
Should've paid Za'Darius
Stole 17 mil and ran
hopefully he'll show up soon if not then he'll be gone after this year
You could add Tyus Bowser to this list too. He keeps getting pressure but can‚Äôt ever make the sack. I‚Äôve literally counted like 6 or 7 sacks he should‚Äôve had.
"The interior o-line needs addressing and a WR needs to be added too but a top pass rusher (assuming one is available)  might be the team's biggest need. 

Judon will hit the market next year and some team will overpay. Hopefully, the organization gets a 3rd or 4th round comp pick in 2022."
He had a great sack.  Too bad he was offsides.   One game guys...calm down.  KC is really good.
"Just seemed to run full speed at the line and over run the play or do nothing last game, Not that anybody played well but hes been really bad in a contract year. Wish we had not tagged him and went after clowney."
You have shitty friends.

"These hot takes are getting ridiculous. We lost a game y‚Äôall, were not in rebuild mode."
"Mark Ingram is making like 4.5 mil a year first of all, and he had a great year in our offence last year. He was part of the best rushing offence of all time, and is a great leader for our young guys. That is why we have Mark, he is cheap, effective, and a good leader. He may have lost a step, or is just struggling a bit compared to last year, he certainly hasn‚Äôt been bad though"

what on earth is laces on leather and why would anyone care what they have to say?
This dude claims he‚Äôs a Ravens fan. Loves to shit on Lamar and he‚Äôs secretly a Flacco apologist
Yo can Lamar just lose a fucking game without people thinking he‚Äôs a bust. I don‚Äôt hear this same stuff about Sam Darnold.
The reason i put the pic is because this post is on an account ran by a ‚Äúravens‚Äù fan
"Didn't he beat the pats, seahawks, 49ers, rams, etc. last season?"

HELLLLL YEAHHHHH
THIS IS HUUUUUUUUUUUGE
"My exact reaction - ""Holy sh- WHAT THE FUCK."" Glad we decided to fucking pay the man."
I bet Snowflake's happy.
Remember when we drafted him and we all thought he‚Äôd be a no name special teamer? Fuck I love our front office.
LETS GO MARLO
"4 up, 4 down baby!

Let's gooooo!"
"damn Marlon, where the Bugatti dealer at?"
For what he brings to the team that‚Äôs actually a really reasonable contract IMO!
idk that's a lot of money for a pass rusher that can't even get home/s
Big play Marlo!!!
Stanley next
YESSSSSSSSSIR
Best news of the week by far
Dicks out lads
"Glad to have him and MP. Just curious where this puts us cap wise. Im assuming this doesnt hit till 2022 as 2021 is last year with rookie deal. 2022 we will have MP on the books for 12 mill and he will need an extension, and assuming we give ronnie 20 mill ish a year that puts us down for 50mill tied into 3 players. Lamar is gonna hit 2022, so if we are using mahomes as a barometer, that is somewhere near 40-50 million per season. 4 players at 100 million with roughly 170 in cap space. is 70 mill enough to fill out a roster? Obviously we will have to keep busy in the draft, but maybe we can figure it out.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer- Not saying Ronnie, MP, Marlon, or Lamar arent worth the money. Just looking at things in the future optimistically."
"Definitely worth it. Easily the best defender we have on the team. His versitility, toughness, and opportunity making abilities are top notch."
"All Pro Marlo.

&#x200B;

Well deserved."
He‚Äôs our best pass rusher this year. Glad we paid him like one!
"I'm new to NFL and the ravens, is this a good move by the Ravens? How good is Humphrey"
Hell yeah! This team is going to keep kicking ass for years. Pretty stoked we're going to see two AFC teams basically running a solid dynasty for the future.
"I‚Äôm happy for him, but I thought he would get tre money and not Ramsey money. Deserves it tho."
"A lot of money, worth every penny. First extension is done. Now get Stanley"
Thank god we got him for a longgg time
trying to find numbers but struggling. this is less than ramsey but more than tre white annually right? so well deserved
Not all bad news this week
"caw caw brahs, is this a great deal for us?"
How much guaranteed?
Marvin!!
I've been wanting to get one of the Nike Elite jerseys with #44.  All they have is a size 60.
Let‚Äôs book up Ronnie Stanley next please.
So proud of our boy Marvin
"That's a lot of dough, but I've never seen a cornerback as physical as he is."
"Anyone else see this as a pretty team friendly deal when you look at it over 7 years (including this season and his 5th year option). He got paid, but he didn't hold their balls to the bandsaw and get every penny. I think he want's to be surrounded by talent."
"Very happy, but salary cap hell's a comin'.  2 mill a year more than every CB except Ramsey."
Noice I can buy his jersey without being horrified that he‚Äôll leave
Aye bag secured üí∞üí∞.
"anyone who has a good understanding of our cap situation, does this make it difficult to extend Lamar and Stanley down the line?"
MARLON BAG CHASING YESSIR
"Roll Tide, Marlon!"
Marlo getting that bag
[[Video] Marlon Humphrey Gets Emotional Discussing Extension](https://www.baltimoreravens.com/video/marlon-humphrey-gets-emotional-discussing-extension)
Thank you Jesus thank you Lord
Glad he got his bread. He only turns 25 next year and could easily still be here to sign an extension when this contract is running down.
"Damn..... my boy got paid $$$$ Love it, big truss"
"Well, looks like I'll be getting a Marlon jersey in the future."
"Sadly, he is all but impossible to resign in Madden 21"
"Due to the Titans-Steelers game being postponed, they may move the Ravens Steelers game to Week 8 (where the Ravens currently have a bye), so the Titans and Steelers can play Week 7"
I would love this. Give us a week off before Pitt
And the Steelers get the week 4 bye.
This is great for us we get our bye week the week before we play the Steelers and on top of that the Steelers will have to play AJ Brown when they play the Titans (which was pretty unlikely this week).
Bye week before the Steelers game instead of the Colts? [I'll allow it.](https://media.giphy.com/media/146heXDX89mUgw/giphy.gif)
"This makes a ton of sense but I haven't seen this anywhere official yet.  For the time being seems like a reddit theory.

Could happen tho."
"I expect the bye week shift to W7 and Steelers/Ravens in W8 to be the outcome.  The Ravens had 2 big scheduling disadvantages this season:

1. They play 2 teams coming off a bye (that should never happen, as I have written many times).
2. They play the Steelers in a road Thursday game.

This scheduling change will create more relative fairness between the 2 schedules this season.

Steelers fans hate this and are saying the Titans should simply forfeit, but that does not meet the competitive balance needs of the league.

The Ravens had a week 2 bye forced on them in 2008 when Reliant (now NRG) in Houston was damaged by a hurricane.  Rather than play the game in Baltimore or at a neutral site (as has been done for wildfires and other weather situations), the Ravens played the last 15 weeks consecutively and trounced the Texans in week 10, 41-13."
Id be mad if I was a steelers player having to play 13 straight weeks because of a Titans fuck up.
"We all are guilty of these from time to time. I'll go first: many seasons ago, after a couple of terrible games, I remember declaring that we should cut Flacco and tank the rest of the season to draft Johnny Football."
"I thought Lamar was going to turn out to be Tyrod 2.0, only being used in trick plays and wildcat and stuff like that.

I'm extremely happy I was wrong."
"I genuinely thought Lamar would light a fire under Flacco and he would ball out and continue to be our QB for the next 5 years plus. 

Glad that didn‚Äôt happen, as much as I love the guy."
Thought Alex Collins was the future at our RB position. He was really good for us for about 2 years but i think the off the field things messed him up
"I did not like drafting Marlon, or Lamar at the time. On the Flip side I loved drafting Elam and Perriman I am so glad I am not the GM"
I wanted baker at 16. Fortunately hue jackson was dumber than I expected and baker was already gone so we got the best qb in that class
"Wasn‚Äôt too excited about the 2018 draft class. First, taking Hurst over Ridley irked me. Was happy about Lamar as I was ready for Flacco to be replaced. But other than Lamar (and I wasn‚Äôt even THAT pumped about Lamar, just happy we took *any* quarterback) I was not excited about anyone.

*How dumb was I?*

Edited to also add: I thought Trestman was going to be great, I thought Hollywood was going to be Perriman 2.0 when he had injury talks already going into rookie year, I thought Matt Elam was going to be a godsend, I thought the Ravens were going to steamroll the Titans in last year‚Äôs playoffs, I thought Ronnie Stanley was gonna be worse than Tunsil

Edited again: I thought Tim Williams was going to be a premier pass rusher for the Ravens some day LOL"
I was pissed we drafted Lamar. Then after his first year was still pissed because he was so inaccurate.
Around 2015-17 I started to doubt Harbaugh and occasionally called for his head. I got really annoyed how reluctant he was to fire our shit OC and DC from those years and was tired of watching us dink and dunk passes with Flacco those years. Really glad we stuck with him and will never doubt him again.
"I thought Arthur Brown was going to be a lynchpin of our defense for years lol

Bonus stupid opinion: I thought Kyle Arrington was going to be the missing piece to send us on a Super Bowl run"
There's a LOT of players I thought would be great for us simply because they'd turn out that way for me in Madden.
I fiercely defended both Billy Cundiff and Lee Evans.
Really wanted Marlon Brown to be a better receiver than he was.
I can‚Äôt think of one being overly dumb just had high hopes for Elam and Perriman but for some reason my dad thought Kenny Young was going to be a superstar
Flacco should not have gotten that extension after the superbowl
I was sure Kenneth Dixon was going to be a star :(
I thought Harbaugh was mentally checked out at the end of the Flacco era
I thought Marlon was a dumb pick.
I thought we should‚Äôve put Flacco back in once he got healthy in 2018
I was an Alex Collins truther
"I thought Terrance West was gonna be a staple in our offense for years. (He went to Towson, homer bias)"
"I've got a few:

1. Walked out of the NYG game in 2016 'officially' done with Harbaugh.
2. I threw my hands up in triumph when Ozzie nabbed Elam.
3. Similarly, I thought Brooks and Jernigan would be great Ravens for years."
I thought we should‚Äôve put flacco back in during the playoffs... only for a second but I admit I did
That Flacco was still good from 2015-2018 and he didn‚Äôt have the weapons he needed
"I was pretty convinced KB could turn it around a be a real QB for the Ravens. I wasn‚Äôt alone and remember logic like, ‚Äúhe missed 6 games his rookie year, so year two is basically still rookie year‚Äù"
"In 2014, I REALLY wanted Shanahan something fierce and ij 2015, I wanted Adam Gase even more than I had wanted Shanahan.

Whoops..."
I thought for years that things were going to click for kyle boller.
I thought that the gigantic failure that was our 2015 season was solely due to injuries. everyone would get healthy and we'd be legit super bowl contenders again. 2016 and 2017 were rough.
"I thought lamar should've started day one. But he obviously needed some time to learn and adjust.

I wanted Zach Baun or Aj Epensa this past draft but it doesn't seem like any of them are even playing"
I thought Terrance Brooks was taking Baltimore by storm lol
Stoney Case was gonna be awesome
"When we drafted Ronnie Stanley, I was mad about it."
"I HATED the Ronnie Stanley pick. I wanted Tunsil all the way and was livid we let him slip. 

Well shit I‚Äôm glad I can laugh at that. Both great players, no doubt but we got a solid onep"
Shareece wright was decent.
I still have high hopes for Tyus Bowser... though 80% of that is because of his name. (20% because we desperately need a reliable pass rusher.)
I thought Jim Leonhard was going to come back for another run after his best season with us. I was wrong
I thought Troy Smith was the future. He won the Heisman after all!!!
"I'm sure you'll call me stupid for this take but Ed Reed was on a whole different level than Ray Lewis. Ray Lewis had immense talent and his leadership abilities were second to none, but Ed Reed was probably the most talented player that has ever played for us, and may only be second to Lamar depending on how his career plays out in 10 or 20 years time."
I had really high Hope's fpr Perriman back when we drafted him. Boy was I wrong
I preferred Troy Smith to Joe Flacco for a long time. Probably until we let Troy go.
""
Chiefs fan here. Marlon deserves this. Great player. Congrats to securing him for another half a decade. Let‚Äôs hope he stays healthy and keep delivering good performances.

Yeeesuuhhhh he wore this in the interview yesterday
"This is pretty awesome looking, but I can‚Äôt help but think of the ravens podcast interview with Matt Stover this week. He talked about how you have to plan so carefully with your money if you want it to last you and yours. It‚Äôs a great listen. At one point he mentioned how the NFL used to have 2:1 matching for retirement investments, and how many people didn‚Äôt bother to take them up on that because they wanted their money now and didn‚Äôt want to think about whats down the road, literally giving up an immediate 200% return on investment. 

I know Lamar is due a big paycheck soon but you‚Äôd be shocked how much stuff like this burns through money, like the rolexes he bought his O-Line. Most of these guys‚Äô careers are over before 30, and whatever you‚Äôve earned has to last a long time. 

I know I‚Äôm sort of a party pooper here but I want these guys comfortable and taken care of with smart decisions financially. 

All that being said, to Lamar can I borrow that for like a day?"

"Hey all, Chris here from the Ravens ReCAP podcast. As I'm sure everyone here could attest to, it took a little bit to get over the loss to the Chiefs. While the Ravens have had a lot recent success, dealing with the losses gets a little bit more difficult.

We could throw out names all we want but if there's one thing I've learned with EDC as GM it's that we never know who's actually on the trade block until they're traded.
Not much. Gotta hope bowser and Judon continue to improve. Maybe Madibuke can provide a spark.
Melvin Ingram the Chargers aren‚Äôt going to extend a 31 year old pass rusher and if they aren‚Äôt in playoff contention at the trade deadline then they will likely trade him away to get whatever assets they can recoup.  My issue is that I think they are a playoff team so I don‚Äôt see them trading Ingram away.
"I was thinking maybe get suggs back. 

Not to actually play, he's too old for that but maybe to help mentor up our young linebacking core. We have a bunch of young pieces who we've invested serious capital in but it seems like we've been having trouble developing them over the last couple of years (excluding mosley). 

Is it at all possible to bring him back as a coach in some form? I'm only getting this desperate because in terms of other players to trade for or sign there's nothing whatsoever."
"The pass rush wasn't the problem, the problem was Mahomes escaping pressure and making plays outside of structure. There's very few QBs that can do that, and Mahomes is close to unstoppable when he brings his A game. There's no need to panic and sell the farm because we lost one game. Now we have it on tape for when we meet up in the playoffs. Let's just calm down, we were never going to go 16-0."
"Only trade target I think you could realistically grab midseason is Whitney Mercilus. Houston's 0-3 and could easily head into midseason at 2-6 or 3-5, and Bill O'Brien has consistently been a complete moron when it comes to trades.

Other than that though, I'm not sure there are any big names that really stick out in my head right now. There may be some unexpected midseason name that comes out of nowhere kind of like Peters did last year, but if I look at teams I think will start a fire sale and pass rushers on those teams, Mercilus is the only name that comes to mind, and I don't really know how much of an upgrade he is from Judon."
Ingram to a contender as a rental or Gus/Hill to someone looking to build for next year. We don‚Äôt need 4 RB of this quality when we have other obvious holes.
"Cutting judon is not a possibility as we wouldn‚Äôt save any cap space. We can trade him but he‚Äôd be an overpaid rental. If we don‚Äôt trade him we wouldn‚Äôt really have the cap space to sign a big name to help out. If we make a package deal we could potentially pull something off.

If we wait a couple more weeks and Minnesota doesn‚Äôt seem to improve, we may be able to package some draft picks and go after Ngakoue. They gave up a second and fifth for him and are 0-3 so they may want their picks back. Their bye is week 6 or 7 so if we wait until then he‚Äôd cost us around 5 mil in cap space but we‚Äôd have to resign him for a big contract or we‚Äôd be giving up draft capital for half a season of playtime.

At this point our best bet is to relook our blitz schemes. Judon is not rushing the passer as much as he should be. Maybe another few weeks will get our dline meshing more. Don‚Äôt forget they‚Äôve only played 3 games together so far.

We also may have some trade value in our backfield. I like our running backs but thats a position that if you sub too much its hard for any one player to get hot. Gus(yes i love gus too) and judon may be a good package to a rebuilding team in need of a strong rb2 and an olb they could resign for a not massive deal. The chargers could be an option. Maybe the redskins. Minnesota has no money. 

Ngakoue would be my pick though for a trade target."
We should trade Mark Andrews and Snead for Cam Jordan.

"Yes I think they are. This has been like the preseason for Fat Ben, which is exactly what he needed."
‚ÄúNobody cares/work harder‚Äù type of situation.
Their schedule is cake.
"I‚Äôd put $500 on them not making the playoffs, or maybe safer bet is not winning a playoff game since they have a cake schedule but are gonna crumble under any decent team they play"
"only scratched the surface of the season, still a long ways to go, a lot can change"
Yes they definitely are
Steelers looking pretty sus right now.
"Eh ...

You play whoever is on the schedule. So far, they're undefeated. They're who the Ravens have to get past if Baltimore wants the division right now."
1-9 now baby lol
"To be honest, they are always contenders. They have great coaches and players. These may have been easy games, but they won and got it done. Steelers have often fallen to lesser teams. 

I do feel we are better, but they have a fantastic defence and an offence that can move the ball."
the answer: no

This would give us two weeks to prepare for the Steelers.

Do you use that fist on your mom when your stacking her box?
Just saying the OP is a bigot.
"Ravens fan here. And I want to say that being 30, I‚Äôve seen some incredible QB‚Äôs & players. I grew up loving both of our Ravens SB‚Äôs. I loved the Mile High miracle. I loved seeing Brees fling bullets and I‚Äôve been a huge closet packers supporter since I was little! Aaron Rodgers is one of my favorite QB‚Äôs ever. Although fuck the Pats, I loved the Brady v. Manning battles over the years. And I was young enough to see some of Montana‚Äôs awesome moments. 

Now Lamar, Russ & Murray are ushering in a new hybrid of QB and I‚Äôm super ecstatic to see the evolution we‚Äôre moving into. But I will say this: #15 in KC - Patrick Mahomes is a fucking freak of nature. He‚Äôs literally insane and i can‚Äôt articulate how much in awe I am a lot of times seeing him play. I love my QB. But I know his shortcomings. I‚Äôm a realist. 

What‚Äôs worse is he‚Äôs vested our team on multiple occasions, which is frustrating. He‚Äôs such a phenom to watch against other teams and he‚Äôs such a fucking heartbreaker every time we play him. 

The truth is we‚Äôre going to have to defeat Thanos to get to the last dance. There‚Äôs no fucking way around it. Sorry if I seem to be rambling. I‚Äôm just venting. But at the end of the day, I know we‚Äôll easily be 13-3 or 14-2 again. But the truth is we have to overcome this hump in order to secure another ring. 

I have high hopes and lots of optimism for our future. Lamar will get better. And we have to learn to relax and play from behind. The only way from here is up! Thx for listening to my ted talk."
I thought you were going to vent?
"The truth is, after rewatching the game, it‚Äôs a combination of things more than just Mahomes. Andy Reid is a god damn wizard. 80% of the successful plays run by the Chiefs were schemed successes. All Mahomes has to do is stick to the game script and on those 10-15 plays that aren‚Äôt schemed successfully, if makes them right on 50%, they are impossible to beat. So that 7-8 plays a game that Mahomes really destroys your team‚Äôs morale or can make or break a game outcome"
"Mahomes is the best in the NFL, and when his career is over he could well be the ""Michael Jordan"" of the NFL


But, in that loss he wasnt that amazing. Our pass rush was tame, we tried playing man coverage but stood off them because we were scared of the deep threat (because no pass rush)

He made a lot of easy throws to open guys, we made it too easy for him"

"If you were looking for the bright spot against the Chiefs, it was probably the OL play:

1. 4 sacks allowed (3 charged to OL)
2. No QH and only 2 pressures
3. Low total of missed blocks (15 for the whole line)
4. Bozeman's streak of 13 straight games without any share of a sack was broken"

"i personally think that no one is devaluing themselves more right now than mark andrews. there is a direct correlation between mark andrews' games where he leaves his hands at home and lamar's off games (AKA, when he's hitting andres in the hands). if i had to name one player (not coach, because if it's coaches and players i'm blaming roman and harbaugh) to take the blame for the titans game it's andrews. and honestly, he's up there for blame for the chiefs game as well. if he wants to be up there with kittle and kelce, he can't drop balls that hit him in the hands. lamar didn't play well i agree, but if our number one target can't catch a ball that hit him in the hands . . . you can understand why lamar couldn't string something together."
Don‚Äôt forget that Lamar is young and has time to grow and improve his game.
Lamar is not going to put up MVP caliber numbers again this year with that OL.
"Yes he will get elite QB money but if he loses again and doesn‚Äôt look good doing it then it will obviously bring the number down somewhat. 

I doubt he gets Mahomes money, nor should he, but it will be more than anyone else has ever gotten. Will be interesting to see how he and Dak compare."
He is getting mahomes money barring a career ending injury
"Watson gave a good barometer for if this happens. If he does progress and wins a playoff game or two, then we‚Äôll be in the Mahomes neighborhood. 

Gotta say, I haven‚Äôt been this bummed and deflated about a loss in a while. I don‚Äôt think the Titans was even this bad, to be frank."
"I worry more about the affect on Lamar's mind. If he gets labeled as 'can't win the big games,' that can get in his head and become a self-fulfilling prophecy."
""
Gotta give them credit.  They definitely got our offense out of sync.  I still think Lamar gets jitters in big games.  He was missing throws that he normally makes. Hopefully he can grow out of that.
"This doesn't really mesh with what Jackson said after the game - I thought I saw him say that the Chiefs used the same approach the Titans did, but that wasn't really the case. Chiefs were more aggressive with man coverage."

"Even beyond the optics of this incident, how can the NFL continue to allow coaches like Andy Reid get away with only a face shield?  Numerous studies concluded that face shields do nothing to prevent transmission of COVID.  Heck, even the neck gaiter that Harbaugh is wearing has limited efficacy.  

They need to mandate effective masks and require they be worn at all times."

Maybe the refs should have actually done their job right. That tripping call was absolute nonsense.

But the ref was not standing near Harbaugh, and refused to go over to the Ravens sideline to speak to him. AND, the call was utter bullshit. So, sure- fine him for pulling down his mask for 15 seconds while he disputed a bad call. Don't make it sound like he was being malicious and trying to spit on you lmao"
"NFL Referees Association Executive Director Scott Green voiced strong disapproval to NFL EVP Troy Vincent about \#Ravens coach John Harbaugh pulling down his neck gaiter to yell at officials Monday night and demanded the league take action, per sources.

The NFL declined comment.

"How bout the refs running around with their mask down before and after making calls or going to the replay booth..

How bout not call phantom tripping penalties that was so obvious the commentators for the game had to go out of their way to mention how much ""experience"", the officiating crew had Monday night..

How bout not call phantom offsides penalties..

How bout stop making games about the refs and let the teams play each other..

Fuck outta here"
If they fine Harbaugh then they should fine every ref that takes off their mask to announce calls

"Everyone knew this season was going to be a mess going in, but I'm not going to be mad about having a bye week before playing Pittsburgh tbh"
"TBH it's Pittsburgh who should be maddest. Their bye week has now been moved and I'm sure they had already planned things around it, and now we'll be coming off a bye when we first face them."
"Is this bad for us? Steelers have to have an early bye week which fucks their schedule/rest late in the season, and we have two weeks to prepare for them instead of one week"
Moving our bye up one week is hardly fucking our season
"Supposedly the Patriots game with the Chiefs got delayed to Monday because Chiefs players tested positive too..hmm

Edit a chiefs practice squad QB who was in close contact with Mahomes"
"Everyone should mentally prepare for the real possibility this season doesn‚Äôt complete.

The nfl had so much time to plan and did nothing"
Why do we assume that everyone who gets COVID is some kind of irresponsible moron lol

This is a good thing. Now we play the Steelers off of our bye and they have to play like 13 games in a row lol
NFL really screwed over the Steelers. Now we‚Äôre gonna win by 40 instead of 30
Fuck the Steelers

"Having that week off, especially for Stanley is great"

"Because of the Titans Covid cases, our bye week has been moved to week 7. What are your thoughts about this change and the 5-6 though games that we‚Äôll have from week 8 to 14?"
We get steelers at home after a Bye. Thats cool and the steelers have to play 13 straight games. That really helps us in the division.
"It doesn‚Äôt matter.

but the fact that the Steelers have to play 13 straight games definitely doesn‚Äôt hurt us..."
Week 8 to Week 14 will define this team the same way it did last year
"I would have preferred the later Bye to be honest, I feel like the rest helps more.  But at least we can have an extra week to prepare for the Steelers and get folks healthy--we need our line in tiptop shape against their pass rushers."
Extra week prepping for Steelers makes the change worth it

"If the colors were reversed, these would be sooooo cool. I'm not the biggest fan of white shoes but these look dope nonetheless."
"I love that these are so nice and that you could grab 2 pairs

I like... My hokas are about worn this season and am in need of another high mileage shoe...
One shoe each?

"This is a 12-minute podcast where cohost u/DPRees8 and I introduce 5 statistics each which tell the current story of the Ravens in terms of the past game, next game, or season to date.  

We're trying to come up with shorter content alternatives to the 1-hour plus offense, defense, and know-your-foe pods.  To that end, I'm open to alternatives and happy to consider shorts or other regular pods that include the r/ravens community."

Oh ^word
"I reckon they will be inactive. Not so much of an issue if smith doesn‚Äôt play, but Stanley being out is a slight worry. Regardless of Washington missing two great defensive players, they still have a good line."
Stanley is literally always injured.

How hasn't this guy been banned yet? 3-4 days in a row of obvious troll posts...
Metlife Stadium is more of a threat to the Ravens than either the Jets or Giants are.
Don‚Äôt bring our friends the Jets into this.
Its karma for what happens on the baseball side of things.

"Really cool analysis. Always had a soft spot for film breakdowns, love seeing just how much impact something most fans might not think much about has on the game!"

"1. This is a copy cat league, like the video says, and team use a ton of similar plays all the time.

2. Your title is not at all what the video is saying. The only thing they are really saying is Baltimore used motion during the snap a lot last year, leading the league with the Rams at 4th. Since, McVay has used motion during the snap more, so they are now 2nd in NFL. That has more to do with the personnel they have rather than exactly play calling, and the Ravens are the ones who created it or perfected it. McVay is just smart and saw how it helped the Ravens and increased its usage, but spoiler alert, so did every other team in the NFL, including the Ravens"
I hope we're stealing Andy Reid's plays. That fullback shuffle pass up the middle on the goal line was a thing of beauty.
"This isn't anything new, the Patriots were running the Baltimore blitz schemes all last season and they got deemed the best defense in the league by everyone"

Is this the heir to Jaleel Scott we have been seeking?
Why is this such a bop?
Wtf this is pretty good.
Why do I actually like it
Throw it on a dime
LMFAOOOOO
I still want us to call him RT3.
I‚Äôd love if we started putting Trace in some when we get out of reach ahead instead of just RG3. My PA in-laws hate the Ravens but are the biggest Penn State homers it would make their heads explode.
Lmao it‚Äôs actually pretty good

Some old song that was made when he was at Penn State blew up and its become a meme on tiktok for some reason

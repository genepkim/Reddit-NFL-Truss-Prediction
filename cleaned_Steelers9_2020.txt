better be the pubic kind i dont want no eating crabs
ah yes the classic sunday rsteelers boomer meme
dont eat the crab dip

thats sweet never seen this one where did you acquire
i have like 40 different towels but not this one good find
pro tip for anyone with a large terrible towel collection get yourself a towel rack with a thin bar buy a bunch of curtain rings with the pressure clip on them voila cheap and cool looking way to display all of your towels
boys i need your help i swear i thought i heard the game was moved to 430 eastern time but google still saying 100 i needed to know what time to get home by thanks
so having watched the history video wouldnt it be fantastic for the steelers organization to make an app for fans attending road games to have a synchronized team managed official playing of renegade over everyones phones obviously it wouldnt likely be heard on the sideline but the road fans would be going crazy together at the appropriate time and would certainly be singing together loud enough to be heard
this is very cool

just uh make sure its ready for action in 4 hours
this is awesome this will probably be the towel i get my dad for christmas this yearthe last few years ive started a tradition of getting him a special themed one for each giftgiving occasion
i want to be the very best like no one ever was
amazing finally know what i can get my dad for christmas thanks for sharing
game is at 1pm
i got this towel last year when i realized the terrible towel that i had was one meant for kids i guess it makes sense since i did have it since i was a kid
got the 2005 polamalu jersey on today trying to channel the polamalu power
i saw this towel sometime last year and knew i had to have it
can someone please explain the hype behind renegade i get that its 42 years old but we could just as easily just play some good ol fashioned ragtime music if we were going for age

mason he tried to knock mason in the head not duck
it was mason he bonked
a he hit mason rudolph not duck

b why do you care what coverage other teams get

c hes still one hell of a talent who got a huge contract and is a key piece for the browns while putting up great numbers

d lets move the fuck on already

edit alright since  his dumb ass comment ill do this here


yeah i mean ray rice was a hell of a talent too and a key piece of the ravens he did the exact same thing myles did just off the field so why didnt everyone move on your argument is stupid and youre negating the fact he tried ruining rudolphs life by suing him because he wanted to save his open ass and claimed he was called the n word johntron3000

alright lets do this then

garrett had a fight during a game where he hit rudolph in the head with his own helmet the whole thing was televised live and every moment captured on footage to be reviewed a million times by a billion people he was ejected from the game and suspended for the rest of the season

he made his claims about why but nothing ever backed it up and he dropped his lawsuit even rudolph has stated he wants to move on and put this shit behind him

and you want to compare that to ray rice beating his girlfriend unconscious by punching her repeatedly in the head and then getting caught on hotel security cameras dragging her knocked out body back to the room in an attempt to cover it up only to get caught and charged with assault which he lost in court only to luck out with criminal charges being dropped because the dumb ass girlfriend went ahead and married him then he turned around and sued the ravens who had to settle out of court in a wrongful termination suit where the settlement hasnt been disclosed but its widely believed he got pretty much everything he was asking for

these arent even remotely close to similar issues and youre a fucking clod if you think they are one is a domestic violence case that was taken to court and then other was a fight during a game

no shit people moved on from the girlfriend beating asshole who tried to cover it up but still talk about the guy who had a nasty fight during a game

its 2020 get the fuck over it holy fuck
why are you paying for the browns rent in your brain who gives a fuck what social media accounts have to say about football players
probably because he plays football and is very good at it

i think at the end of the day we all knew this was coming im just really happy hes able to walk and be able to be a father to his kids would love to have him in some type of coaching role in the future if he isnt already in one
its a shame his football career got cut short but all in all its just fantastic that he was able to recover the way he did and get back to a rather normal life
and the start of a coaching career

am i right
in the end im just glad he was able to walk he had an incredible career and though cut short i hope he can be a coach or pursue something else in the future

i just wish he couldve kept playing cause he was a hofamer hands down
id love to see him become our defensive coordinator

has he even been at a game this year i either havent seen him or they havent put a camera on him
since lamar jackson was named starter the ravens are 220 when they lead at halftime and 06 when they trail at the half hopefully our offense can get going early
i dont have any doubt that our offense will come out swinging baltimores stadium is far less intimidating without the crowd behind them our d containing jackson is what im most worried about make him throw from the pocket and we should win this game handily
well we never play a complete 4 quarter gameso they need to compete all game no just certain quarters
pic 6
221

god damn hilton
damn hilton and gilbert are gonna hurt but thats just the nature of football at least weve avoided any major injuries besides bush steelers 67 ravens 3
this is two straight weeks for hilton do we have any idea what is wrong
oh man so were probably gonna see a lot of allen at lb today cant imagine we want spillane or vince trying to spy lamar maybe have edmunds drop lower into the box gonna be an interesting situation to monitor thats for sure

no dangerfield or hilton is a major bummer especially hilton i am big sad
big picture gotta have hilton healed up and ready for the rest of the run if hes not good to go rest it and see where hes at dallas should be a pushover so he could potentially chill for another few weeks
watt active
called it that hilton wouldnt be playing that was what sutton was saying stay tuned about on instagram

hilton and gilbert both being out are gonna reduce the effectiveness of our ability to blitz and consistently bring pressure on the quarterback keeping jackson contained is going to be much more difficult but i still think weve got the defense to get it done

thankfully the schedule gets easier after this but we got a long ways to go until we get a week off and even then we gotta earn it
hilton fuck me man
hilton is kind of interesting because he practiced and traveled with the team
imo people need to chill about hilton and find comfort in sutton hes a lot better than he gets credit for
i feel like not enough people are mad about dangerfield their returner has already taken one for a td and with watt banged up and dangerfield our were gonna have some problems on special teams

lets hope bos can kick it out the back and trey edmunds can help fill the hole

this was created by a bot for issues or suggestions please message nfl changed a lot during the offseason so improvements will be made during the season
post game thread
i havent worn a jersey all season were undefeated so my jerseys will stay in the closet
as is tradition im making chicken wings for any game vs a birdbased opponent
anyone else noticing that bud and tj are specifically seeking jackson even when he doesnt have the ball wearing him out and giving him pressure i presume
am i the only one with crippling anxiety right now
not even sure we can blame the defense theyve got to be tired being on the field for so long this is all on the offense
steelers fan is going to become a preexisting medical condition
tj really stopped a read option designed to confuse and stop him specifically
it looked like claypool got it back
stop with the heyward shit thats a legal fucking hit
offense needs to get a long drive so i d can rest were lucky its only 147 honestly
the steelers are just doing the opposite of last week play bad the first half then demolish the 2nd half
the fact of the matter is boys if we dont score more points than the rat birds we lose
considering how outofsorts weve looked today being down 3 points is not all that bad
so next time we want to ice the kickers lets just send 12 on the field lol what the fuck is that rule
well they really need to address that rule can you imagine if boswell missed the second kick steelers lose by one because the ravens penalty took an extra point off the board you know thats coming at some point right has to everything that can happen in the nfl eventually does
dont worry guys i saw you a minute ago hating our 60 team cause of an ugly half
im so pissed this drive should be over
ebron fell for 5 minutes lmao
watt is honestly the most incredible player for us kid is a generational talent and i daresay will have a better career than his brother
motherfuckers i have gerd this shit is not good for me
gg steelers yall outplayed us fair and square see ya on thanksgiving
he was still fucking in bounds are you fucking kidding me
i picked a bad day to give up sniffing glue
these gameday threads are something else

claypool has been nothing but solid game after game and now everyone is calling him a bum rookie for one forced fumble
berrys first punt fucking cut him

second punt meh

third fucking aussie legend
why do people insist that one half of football means more than 6 whole games ive seen multiple people say clearly that us and the titans just arent the real deal because look at their first halves today oh but lets just dismiss the first six games because theyve only played one or two good teams blah blah blah teams dont play 100 their best in every half even if we lose this game does not mean that we are worthless or that our season is over we have to lose eventually if we lose to a 51 ravens team in baltimore after they had a bye week and are fresh and we had a physical game against another undefeated team the previous week so be it its not the end all be all even if we lose this game we still can split if we take the game in pitt
i dont get it they should just count the point and keep it pushing if we missed that extra point wed get punished for their penalty
thats gotta be something that is reevaluated as a rule how can you basically ice the kicker without calling a timeout by putting extra players on the field
literally beating ourselves right now
ravens are legitimately gonna have 400 yards rushing from the same 5 plays

i should go take dumps more often

a pick and a td

watt gets held like a motherfucker and the refs never call it man smfh
no foul on the play the qb was ben and not lamar last year
time for another three hour heart attack

go steelers
what the fuck he was in bounds this is such horseshit fucking vegas called
the ravens calling tj watt dirty for that lmao
lol watt yelling at butler
missing 3 dpis on the same play by the same player is kind of impressive
lmao idc it took forever gives our d more rest
spillane has been all over the ball today really like what were seeing from him
my ravens friend is complaining about the refs as if their corners havent been hanging on for dear life like a clingy girlfriend
guys its the first quarter please we all reacted this way against the giants and texans relax
did we just beat the ravens to go 70 incredible
real talk i hope hes ok never wanna see anyone go down
how the hell are we still in the first quarter lmao
if i see another motherfucker say rudolph
damn tj yelling at butler
think on this the steelers have gone an entire nfl game without scoring a td
ben literally has 4 completions at half like what the hell
clear dpi that theyve called against us every single week
have to rekick due to ravens fuckup yeah thats fair good rule right there
thank god we have a magic receiver tree in pittsburgh that we can just pluck from when we need a new one
chase you beautiful man you

i mean uh

go steelers
you may think we had a sloppy half but the ravens have 110 penalty yards and 2 picks theyre their own worst enemy
ah leave it to baltimore to boo the injured
baltimore has the trashiest residents
what was romo referring to when harbough pointed to his head
its time for some splillaning
refball what the fuck
hes still in bounds
oh my fucking god a penalty for tackling
they changed the unnecessary roughness penalty from minkah to heyward so dont hate on minkah
just sucks that the steelers biggest offensive crutch is they literally always start off slow we need them primed now
so many fucking commercials lol
holy shit 3 turnovers already this is going to be quite the rollercoaster of a game
thats the reason why we pushed him out of bounds
when he does that tip toe shit and they call bs roughing calls when a guy pushes him out

what is it that you can do
i love going to the ravens thread and seeing how watt completely meant to do that because hes a dirty player
that was literally an accident nothing dirty i am sorry hes hurt
i like how the defense is yelling at each other but the offense seems totally ok with shitting their pants
lmfao that baltimore culture
im just going to pretend that this is a reverse of the titans game
why do people call lamar jackson likeable i fucking hate that dude
offense needs to wake the fuck up defense cant stay on the field all game
not having alualu in the middle is really hurting us so many of their runs have gone straight up the middle
ignoring the dumb shit pessimists here there were like a dozen plays that half which clearly showed they had an extra week to prepare this is steelers ravens baby hard to win at their place theres no cute stats in these games we are down 10 get the ball and had played an atrocious 1st half offensively we score any points out of half we make them nervous lets go
these refs should be fucking embarrassed
juju was so good that drive
tj fucking sack him dude wtf are you jumping for
holy shit man why doesnt ben just run shit all the time let him pass 80 times and give conner eight runs its fine just let the man do what he does best
apple watch just told me to breathe
this is the heart attack inducing football i signed up for when i pledges allegiance to the steelers
good game friends
outside of the spillane pick 6 this game has been disgusting to watch
everybody shitting on ben needs to remember how abysmal last season was like how short is your memory its still light years better than mason

and fuck we might get mason today so i hope youre happy
this sub is fun sometimes we are facing a really good team who are surpremely good at running the ball and somehow we are completely perplexed that we are not stopping it honestly our defense has played well its a rough team to guard against but time of posession and field position has made the job for our defense entirely impossible

so far this game is 100 on the offense and it aint even close
ravens fans saying throw tj out if the league lmfao delusional babybrains
if that is a foul quarterbacks should be forbidden from running the ball
that dumb ass call will cost us so fucking stupid
just like last week ravens get bailed with a penalty and drive down the field
drink every time theres a questionable penalty for either side
didnt he get the ball back why dont they show the replay
time for the tried and true benjuju 90 yard td
today is the day the pittsburgh steelers will give me a heart attack
that was a 34 yard punt by berry welcome back i guess
lamar tip toeing the sideline because he knows if he gets touched near it its an automatic 15
hate to see it hope hes ok
hoping for a speedy recovery for stanley that shit looked brutal watching him on the ground like that
i dont know about yinz but after an injury the game feels so somber
i really hope lamar keeps throwing those dumbass passes while hes going down so our defense can rack up some ints
i dont think their d is outplaying us necessarily i think were just beating ourselves on offense
interesting to see tj and butler getting hot
peters with a headbutt and another ravens jumping in should be a free first down from us but the refs gonna fuck this up
judon getting ejected for trying to pull away from his coach is some shitty luck for him but fuck if i care after that heyward penalty
our best offensive play has been a ref a getting punched
guys the ravens are a good team relax we will adjust we are very much in this game
no points from our offense weve barely even been in ravens territory

i dont care how elite our defense is you dont beat good teams with lousy offensive outputs like this
jackson is a mediocre qb but fortunately for him hes really good at running
alualu was way more important than i thought
defense is suffering from lack of offensive production hard to be effective when youre on the field 85 of the game because your offense goes 3 and out every possession
0 points in the entire half by our offense pretty pathetic display right now
shame haden didnt have control that pick would have been huge
tale of two halves last week to boys lets see if the boys can turn it around
am i crazy or has 12 men never been a dead ball foul if a 12th player is still running off the field when the ball is snapped they let them complete the play and then you can decline that right serious question
i dont give a shit if ben never throws a long pass again


death by a thousand short passes for these ravens
i just want to say screw you guys who said we werent contenders one half does not define a team
i switched from the minkah jersey to my troy at halftime
like i told you guys this is purposeful they are bending not breaking on defense containing the ravens do you know why this is why mistakes will happen eventually lamar has to throw do things hes not comfortable with by containing them its gonna look bad on the stat sheet but we are containing them the missing ingredient was our offense moving the ball keeping our defense fresh yall need to listen to me more often
great drive by buggs too that pressure on 2nd was huge
tj trying to tear the ball out every play lmao
this is on the offense for giving the ball back with those lousy play calls gave these bums momentum
lol some of yall need to chill steelers arent going undefeated this is a close nfl top 4 rivalry game on the road were holding our own and can still win
juju was the baddest man on that drive light work
claypool and juju making me happy
ben and no huddle is the best offense for the team
love juju not many guys anymore who lower the shoulder like that at wr anymore
ravens fans booing an injury that helps them


what
i can breathe again
it was crazy glad we won just breath and have faith people cry so much here
this is the type of game where not having our bye week stolen from us would have been nice
when will the steelers beat a good team
got my fav steelers tshirt on that i havent washed since the season started

6 pack of lager yuengling of course at the ready

the same order of 18 hot wings extra crispy from the same place that ive ordered every week this far enroute

ive done all i can
lmfaooo we scored before our opening drive
he wasnt out of bounds
he was still in bounds
wtf
if lamar wants to fight for extra yardage then hes open to getting hit bullshit
he pushed him out of bounds
thats call is so soft i cant even you could swaddle babies with that call
i hate free tds that should have never happened
damn it that flag could totally change this game
rough start for the offense
looked like claypool recovered and it and was then down by contact 0 chance they get it right though
tj is zooming after lamar dude im ready for a big hit
cmon guys legit 30 seconds ago you all said we were the worst team in the league

see why you have to watch the game
this game is crazy bro still 5 minutes left in the 1st quarter
i pove you bud
please just string a drive together if for no other reason then to give this defense a rest
hey lets keep running the ball since its working so fucking well either run it up the middle or throw it deep down the right side only two plays we know apparently
i wanna shit in fichtners shoes lmao why not just punt on third down at that point
someone on rsteelers needs to start practicng punting good grief
hate to see it i hope hes alright after this game injuries suck
never like to see a player hurt that really doesnt look good
never want to see injuries no matter what especially not to a really good player like stanley
is it just me or is this game more adds then football so many fucking adds
this offense looks really bad oof
the bungles are up 100 on the titans
maybe if our defense wasnt on the field the entire game we could adjust
damn tj just looked angry af
that headbutt is super illegal
the ravens committed like 5 penalties there
lets see how this is djs faultwith 5 ravens there
dionte gets headbutted twice and gets flagged ok
yes give a mobile qb a full half of the field
how much would having a bye before this game helped us
im legitimately surprised were only down by 7 give the guys a breather at the half and hopefully coaching staff can adjust
we have this dynamic slot receiver named juju smithschuster and i wish wed fucking utilize him
come on guys we may be down but were not out big ben is never out

believe

its the ravens guys you knew this was gonna be an ugly dog fight its definitely ugly but were still in it

lets go
jesse james caught that ball
d misses alualu
tony sounds like he wants to kiss lamar
why doesnt he ever just miss
second half adjustment

offense pls
the fact we are only down 10 is impressive considering the way they are running all over us
410 24 yards holy fucking shit
the offense should physically carry the defense to the locker room give them a foot rub and carry them back out so they dont have to walk a single step
and then actually show up the second half
even romo thinks that was a penalty
a 51 second drive are you fucking kidding me
how we going to keep our receivers off the field and put samuels in the slot
they have no idea what they are doing this ravens penalty helps the ravens
thats dumb kick should just count
the ravens fuck up and we have to kick again
lamar is the best player on our offense
we deserve a few of those with these ravens dbs playing like dirty pigs
juju going the distance fighting for yards
what black n gold team was in the first half
taking shits work boys lets go
is conner most improved player this year


serious question
i honestly feel were due another 2 turnovers from lamar i just have a feeling he cant fuck with this defense
some of the people in this sub are fucking pathetic
apparently the steelers offense just decided to take a bye week from one halftime to the next they look like theyre back to work
glad to see offense has gotten together and is finally making plays great job juju for making that 14 yard play
watt with the third down clutch stop
wish those counted as sacks
tj watt is justso good
randy fichtner and throwing behind the los name a better duo
just checked the bengals titans score did steelers hurt tenns confidence or should we be worrying about the bengals
this will change the whole game a stop would have been huuuuge fuck
if the refs are in this thread it just want to remind you that one team struck a ref and the other did not
ju ju literally carrying the team steeler for life right there
lmfaoooo ravens fans crying about refs gtfoh with that lets go steelers
no runs that whole drive classic big ben
i could watch a claypooljuju duo the rest of my life
ben is night and day from the first half to now and i am not complaining

completely commanding the offense like he should be
ok so this is just heart conditioning for playoffs boys crack a cold one and chug every stop our collective drinking can will a turn over
steel curtain on 4th

commmmmmmmeeeeeee oonnnnnn
this sub reddit is soo negative holy
this is the game right now we couldnt stop them all day when it count i am nervous
oh mammma im in fear for my life
good punt berry
are these fucks booing heyward
this game won for you by the defense
what did tony romo mean by that
maybe claypool lost that ball but i dont think ive ever seen a receiver get up and scramble for the recovery so hard he pounced on that ball
so can you just ice a kicker as long as you want by putting 12 men on the field
guys idk if you know this but this game is tied lets chill out
im so hyped holy shit
already dying as they keep slaughtering tyson alualus name
political ads gonna kill me today i already voted i should be able to opt the fuck out
spillane
what a horrible call even heyward hit him while he was still in bounds this is so soft and also refs just trying to help keep the game competitive
if a quarterback doesnt want to be hit like that they should stay in the fucking pocket
i never see minkah go crazy like he did after that flag which is saying something
if the plays fucking dead blow the whistle its the refs fault he got hit and we got penalized
penalties to keep them alive bullshit man
this is gonna be a long game if the refs keep throwing flags like this
cant beat a good team with stupid turnovers
that ball must be really fucking slippery
injuries suck but duprees side just got easier
i think its time for jujus annual 95 yard td
bad play call on 3rd and 10 then a worse punt
imagine have a punter that can punt
i never understood bringing back berry if you wanted to get rid of colquitt thats fine but you know berry sucks why not try someone else
look at his sideline fake thats why that penalty earlier was bullshit
seein big guys go down just breaks my heart flashbacks of banner
i hope hes okay
damn hate seeing injuries like that
if they called half of the holds against tj no team would ever make it past the 50
refs couldve called that late hit but ofc not
why is samuels ever in he is no longer in the rb rotation and he never caught better than connor
god if this offense isnt gonna score they at least need to move a little bit we are getting killed with field position
we run the ball on 3rd and 10 but not 3rd and 3
why is jaylen samuels getting snaps
this is fucking ridiculous ben has to be better period
dropped pass killed us our defense is gonna get gassed
at this point im relieved that our offense is getting off the field so our defense has a chance to score some more points
our defense is going to be gassed in the second half
good news is that weve been outplayed and are only down by a touchdown
time to turn up
watt screaming at butler on the sideline
ravens committed three personal fouls on one play and got called for one
maybe well win by default when the whole ravens team ends up having to leave the game
tale of two halves last week maybe itll be the same this week
how did we stop henry and then let the rat birds run all over us
just gotta get to the half without them putting any more points on the board outside of the titans game weve been great at halftime adjustments and the biggest issue is the ravens running it on us

were still in this
lamar has thrown basically two interceptions we need to focus on shutting down the run and forcing him to throw form a pocket and then collapse it
i cannot fucking stand lamar
was tyson this good
fucking snead little toothless sewer rat looking motherfucker
watt looks kinda done right now
i have not experienced this level of frustration this season i hate it
hard to deny that the defense doing 90 of the work today is killing them right now
defense is gassed
four straight quarters of the offense looking like hot garbage
steelers have stacked 2 bad halfs in a row now
right down the middle from 51 in the rain unbelievable
dont see how anyone could be mad at the defense so far given the fact the offense hasnt even possessed the ball for 10 minutes yet shit the defense has more points than the offense
as bad as that half was we are only down by 10 make adjustments score with our first possession and we are right there
fuck mt bank


sorry i had a mortgage with them once assholes
whoever took their bumble jersey out for this game put it away please
1st play in the half juju wide open over the middle

next 3 plays none of that same look
ball right back where the dpi should have spotted us
nice zoom in on bosgod admiring his kingdom
gives our d more rest take ur time refs
as bad as we think ben is playing hes still playing better than lamar as a passer
keep driving juju


those are little things that dont show up on the score sheet
juju got a lot more out of that than other receivers would have
claypool motion continues to steal away a lb or safety and opening up that bit extra of a hole not sure how you defend that if you cant win every 1v1 up front
fichtner the mask goes over your nose
imagine if we could have last weeks first half and this weeks second half
good adjustments so far in the second half looking to be a typically tight game
roethlisberger and smithschuster 2020
make them throw
tj motherfucking watt
im getting such a fucking hardon from reading all the hopeless and distraught comments in the ravens thread omg this is what sustains me
aint going anywhere lamar cept to the bench
the amount of times they play a screen on a 3rd and long is genuinely frustrating
without that totally unnecessary juke that would have been at least 10 yards instead of a quick 3 and out sad
diontae was looking open on those last 2 plays
great fucking sack
dont want to flex this game well just keep it going till 7 either way
jackson is great for sure but were making it a lot easier than it needs to be for him
318 and 222 easy stop you think not with the pittsburgh steelers secondary
you dont let antonio clowns cousin score on us
romo his knee is out dumbass
defense gets 3 tos 7 points and many many qb hits against a very dynamic qb and offense

galaxy brains on this thread this 1 in the league defense of ours is terrible
two feet in not two parts of the same leg am i wrong
another free pass wow pass coverage virtually non existent in this drive deserved punishment
nopewe changed our mind on that penality
dont throw a flag if theres not a penalty
another big ben drive we should do this more often lol
did he just say that boswell moved ahead of franco for all time points
claypool

and juju made that drive

and ben in the clutch
its like most of you have never watched a steelers vs ravens game everyone needs to chill
too much time left this game is far from over but beautiful drive against a very difficult defense they could play like this all the time
this is the worst game the front 7 has had in years so bad today
i feel like im watching a fucking game of madden with some nerd spamming the same two glitch plays over and over
i miss joe flacco i swear to fuck
everybody play renegade now
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
everyone play renegade
come on boys bring the fucking heat finish him
lamar turns it over a 5th time on this drive you heard it here first
ravens fans booing stay classy you sons of bitches
i miss two weeks ago when we kicked the shit out of cleveland
did anyone else here the baltimore fans booing cam
minkah comes up big on the final okay thats what we traded for baby
uhhhhh never doubted pls dont check
lamar slaps the steelers defense this bad boy can fit so much 5yard runs in it
if buggs doesnt say whats up doc after a sack we should trade him
what a great game i hate great games lol
the game hasnt even started yet and im already stressed out
omg you are joking me
lmao what a start so happy for spillane
night train spillane lets gooooo
spillane bitch pick six to open it
ok that was absolutely beautiful no other words for it
he was still in bounds even with haywards push unbelievable
and they ignored the holding of course
im not over that bs call lamar literally put his head down trying to go for extra yardage
oh good were back to covering wide outs with linebackers
todays the day i will have the heart attack
why the fuck does ben never get rtp calls for such flagrant fouls
pretty sure claypool recovered that
lot of game left no need to stress out
man that dobbins outside run is where it hurts to lack a bit of that d bush 44 speed in the middle
thats why everyone here has to calm down we got this
pay that man
we have to keep bud next year
this game is going to be fucking crazy
run on 3rd and 10 wtf
lmao good thing we got rid of colquitt when berry can only make two good punts in a row
berry still isnt a good punter
idc if we waste a 4th rounder on a punter please fucking get a competent punter
start a movement for the steelers to bring in pat mcafee
thats fucking why you have to hit him to get him out of bounds
this why we hit lamar theyre on the sidelines
thats why you hit lamar on the boundary
damn i hope stanley is ok
stanley is not looking good fuck hes in a lot of pain

thats their second linemen down or did i miss an update on philips
damn all of watts weight on that leg that does not look good at all
jfc playing oline is so rough man on any given play somebody could fuck your knee up and it just happened twice in a quarter
shit idc who you play for it really sucks seeing these guys get hurt
ravens thread can suck dick tho for blaming tj bless the big man
classy of some ravens fans saying fuck tj watt break his legs absolute asswipes
anyone whos saying that was on purpose needs to go get their head checked smh
these peeps have a lot more composure than i would if i exploded my ankle or knee in that fashion lol
the time to sign a 99m contract is always last week
fuck man tj is always so close to getting a sack
wow a 50 minute 1st quarter
you cant double team everyone on this front

tony romo
oh the stress is real today should not have eaten all that chinese food already mistakes were made
its nice to watch the game in between these commercials
okay offense your turn toexist
thats a late hit out of bounds on the ravens thats the same thing we got called for come on refs keep it consistent
apparently tj is dirty because hes so good he gets to and hits lamar on every play damn the ravens sub is making a solid case for dpoy
decent punt

but jesus our offense needs to click soon smh defense is gonna be gassed to shit by second half
d is tired and its not hard to understand why
his first read on every play was wide open
this team needs to wake the fuck up this is on the offense for not putting any drives together
watt getting held like a mf
not on the defense ben has to stay on the fucking field for longer than 2 minutes

get your shit together o
the d is tired theyve been on the field all game

if we can get the offensive play calling figured out well be fine we should be shredding this defense
im not blaming on defense offense needs to hold the ball and do something so the defense can rest
its not hard to see whats happening this is like the steelers of last year no offense to speak of and the defense will play great until theyre exhausted from being on the field way too damn much
watt getting sassy
watt is pissed christ would not want to be the guy who has to block him lol
seeing watt eat keith would be a highlight
bungles beating the titans

theres that
peters fucking headbutt dj kick his ass out
judon should have gotten 2 flags but like the refs would ever do that buh bye trash player and trash fanbase keep wishing injuries on our players
well at least from this distance berrys short punts are kind of a perk
bruuuuuhhh you fucking serious bens elbow is banged up this game is fucked
damn that wouldve a nice pick great effort by haden though
i still love you haden great effort
not having bush available to keep lamar in check is going to kill us
why do the steelers always give up third and longsits so frustrating ffs
make lamar throw put pressure on him for gods sake hes almost turned the ball over 3 times throwing
losing alualu is very evident they are destroying us with the run
this first half was depression personified
baltimore is such a run heavy team how the fuck are we not stopping it
i stand by this team
outside of two plays the steelers were completed outclassed that half
please please please let us have an actual drive to start off the 2nd half im so fucking sick of watching lamar jackson
defense cant stop cause their tired they been on the field the whole game
completely uninspired play since spillanes pick6

thank the lord we play two halves hoping for a better performance after halftime from our good guys
theyre so worried about surrendering the outside to lamar and the goons that theyve allowed everything up the middle
lets not forget that baltimore got a bye week to prep for this game

we had to play a very good titans team last week
pretty pathetic that just alualu being out turns the steel curtain into a regular curtain
just keep the drinks coming
i think the steelers made a choice on defense to try to contain these guys to some extent and if our offense were moving the ball at all it would be working we are bending but not breaking i think thats the strategy today they are tired theyve been on the field all day the offense needs to get it going my problem with the offensive coordinator who wont be named is that its a rarity to see us struggle for a half and then make adjustments on offense we dont normally go into a funk and then break out of it later in the game but ben looks pissed so who knows maybe we tear them up in the second half
i can see our offense coming alive but the ravens are built to win with leads theyre just going to keep running all over us if ben struggles even a little i dont see is coming back at all pls let me be wrong

edit that drive by ben might have been his best drive this season holy shit picked apart that defense with ease
i like seeing juju cover the ball with his life gives me a sense of security
how isnt that a pi
how the hell was that not dpi
bad call aside the offense fucking blows
woodley with the int
i just switched my bleach back for whiskey maybe we can work our way down to a nice beer
coach t playing 4d chess trying to see how hard of a game we can win by not showing up for an entire half
i know its really simple but i really like seeing the communication on the bench between juju and roethlisberger thats what we need win or lose
highsmith best draft ever
this penalty doesnt make sense
jesus lamar is good hes been instrumental in nearly every point scored
hopefully the whiney manchilds turned the game off at half so that this thread can be tolerable
passes are not crispbut they do the job
please score a touchdown this drive
that was a great gain on 2nd and long
as much as people shit on it the dink and dunk fucking works against team like the titans and ravens
juju playing like a 1 receiver this half
can the people who kept complaining that we are not contenders shut the fuck up
ben picked up someone elses helmet in the locker room and cant hear fichtner anymore
the cream rises boys
juju so solid
football is weird
this is why i hate when fans give up at halftimr its like theyve never seen a football game
here we go steelers here we go
that play by juju to get us to the 1 was sick
wouldve been a pick if he was looking at the ball
lamar cant play when hes rattled
lets gooooo tj
tj waaaaaaaattt
i like the complete whiff by the rb expecting to hit watt lol
tj motherfucking watt
watt dpoy or riot
randy bet on ravens this week
diontaes body language is horrible lol
lol 3rd and 14 please dont give it up defense
this defense lifts fucking weights
buggs spillane sutton have really stepped up after injuries you love to see it
why the fuck is the middle empty
busted coverage twice on the same drive
the fact that he even got that wide open is just as bad
the refs will give them this were due for a fuck you call
we couldnt even get a defender in the camera shot lol
this defence is either making big plays or giving up 30 yards
yuh challenge deez nuts ho
three fucking plays three times theyre wide open what the fuck is up with our defense
oh were picking up flags now but not on the bullshit late hit on cam
of course ben doesnt get a call he hasnt his entire career
bro the ravens are legit such dirty fucking players
jim nantz has no idea its the games against losing teams that worry me most with this team just look at most raiders games and the jets game last year
juju was born to wear that uniform
fuck tony trying to say claypool had hands to the face
unpopular opinion we need to sign juju over any other wr he provides that tough possession wr play we havent had since hines
juju making some tough catches
rookie of the year on god
juju is that drive
lol i love elliot staring to pick juju up then getting reprimanded by his teammates
can we talk for a second about how hilarious it is that new england is garbage now
oh mama
this kid what devils bargain did we make in order to have the endless well of sick ass receivers
steelers are awesome and patriots suck what a time to be alive
vermont checking in now that the patriot interference is over claypool
i was wrong about juju dude is a fucking baller ill admit it big fucking drive from that dude right there
bens head has been removed from his ass this second half
browns lose again
okay defense lets see your magic 1 last time
id really like a pick 6 here
lets go d time to prove why were one of the best in the league
the next 7 minutes will be the longest hour of my life
juju understands the nature of this rivalry you can tell with how hes playing
has our d not realized they keep running it
one more score for us and we win
ravens going to walk right into the fucking endzone fucking trash
its wild how horrendous this rush defense has been theyre literally getting whatever they want
we desperately need to hold them to a field goal
biggest play of the year coming up
heyward is back very refreshing
now stop them please my heart cant take anymore
start renegade lets fucking go
everyone play renegade
could be huge road w this is a brick in the road to 7
holy fuck i am so god damn nervous
i think one of these weeks i will legitimately pass away during a game
heart rate elevated
baltimore is a trash city
nfl is rigged if they put more time on this clock
here we go

now where are my pills
need a ten minute touchdown drive to start the second half defense has to be gassed lucky to only be down by ten hopefully the staff can make some miraculous adjustments
tony romo shut the fuck up
everyone talk about claypool bein big but juju is grown
can you see the difference when ben is calling the shots
holy shit rravens is actually calling watt dirty for that he rolled over backwards and barely got his ankle unbelievable
why is anyone mad at heyward lamar wasnt out of bounds and you play to the whistle
lol ben with a whooping 410 for 24 yards this half
fortunate to only be down 10 need to make adjustments

turn tj watt loose having him only key on the qb is a waste of his instincts and knowledge trust him to make plays

ravens are playing a ton of press man on the receivers so dial up the motion and dial up the tight formations
fuck the ravens fan base booing our injured cam heyward gotta be kidding me
yesssss fuck you ratbirds

we da kings of da norf
minkah earned his keep on that play
gonna make a sacrifice today a late breakfast is currently being cooked involving pancakes eggs hashbrowns bacon sausage the works

gonna be skipping out on that to stick to the winning formula of chinese food good weed jerseys on the dogs and me and a victory preroll on standby for tomorrow morning after work

i fucking love breakfast almost time to go pick up chinese food though
so they just mentioned on the pregame show that ab is going to be living with brady and brady has taken it upon himself to be responsible for making sure ab shows up on time for meetings practices etc im thankful the drama is no longer our problem but id kind of like to be a fly on the wall to see how that dumpster fire works out
missing this game had to move birthday drinks from next week due to the impending uk lockdown go steelers
steelers need a zero turnover game to win
robert spillane pick six
couldnt have asked for a better start
lets goooo
lets gooooo
lets fucking goooooooooooo
spillane you fucking beast
night train spillane
yall owe spillane an apology rn
ngl but that was the last thing i expected to start the game
jacksons first pick six too
spillane putting on a show for a contract somewhere
first ever pick six by lamar
i go to get water and see we got a touchdown what happened lol
did they say that was lamars first ever pick six

perfect start
i just scared the living shit out of my dogs with that one jumped out of my seat screaming at the top of my lungs trying not to dump my chinese food

holy shit i needed that im sorry pupdogs
my stream literally loaded up and the first thing i saw was the the pick 6 wonderful
horrible call
hes a runner not a qb
thats not a penalty he was still moving forward and in bounds
bullshit he was still inbounds when hit if youre going to run youre going to get hit
bullshit

fucking lamar was fighting to stay i n bounds
the most elusive qb in the league was still in the field of play fuck that call
he was in bounds
how on earth can that be a foul thats not even close theres no excuse for that
so you cant tackle a ball carrier when hes still on the field okay got it
good to see the ravens already getting bailed out by bullshit flags

so eager to see how many more of those need to be used today
its okay defense looks solid we cant have these stupid penalties
fucking penalty was a killer
im so glad that lamar is getting babied but watt is getting held every play
refs should get deductions from their game checks if they make soft ass calls or miss obvious penalties im tired of this shit
defense is taught to play until the whistle blows


the whistle had not blown


jackson is squirrely if he breaks free from one tackle and you pull up to avoid what they are calling unnecessary roughness hell rip us for a huge gain
this should be a roughness penalty since our guy was hit inbounds
killing ourselves god damn it
well this is fucked already
fucking kill me
i gotta stop checking this game thread my stream is about a full minute behind
so were in the most important game of the year and we come out and force a pick six right off the bat then proceed to just make mistake after mistake im very angry rn
everyone in this thread is so negative dont understand that its a part of the game and weve been through worse and came out better
why you guys freaking out in the first quarter
man i hope we dont get our d gassed early and stop ben getting into a rhythm
holy fucking commercials
there you go bud
gonna be one of those games
bud dupree
wow my butthole is puckering
yeah boy give up that ball jackson
pay bud whatever it costs
the football gods giveth and taketh away
this thread is so confusing because of how behind all the streams are i just watched the strip sack and look in here and everyone is just now complaining about the run on 3rd and 3 even tho i know im watching it live i still get confused and feel like im the one behind sometimes
how about a 9 minutes drive here
overthrows are better than ints but man if ben can just get his touch back they would be so much more dangerous
what in the fuck is this play calling a draw on 3rd and long i swear to god this shit is so frustrating
u seriously run a draw on 3rd and 10 play aggressive
we need to get a fucking punter fuck this bullshit man
guys jc missed the read on that draw he takes it outside he gets the first
run on 3rd and longits the steelers way
3rd and 10 so keep to the ground

fichtner you sit every time you take a piss dont you
sorry guys my peewee coach was calling plays that drive
still fuming about that 3rd and 10 run complete giveup call in the biggest game of the year if thats going to be their approach to this game theyre not going to put together a decent drive
shit like that is why you have to push jackson out of bounds
at this rate both teams are only going to be playing back ups
i hate to see injuries to anyone fuck that sucks except for burfict fuck that guy
damn its crazy to see a massive guy like that writhing in pain bless the knees
thats a bad injury fuck
god damn thats not good poor guy just signed a 5 year extensive for 112m hopefully got some guarantees
2020 is the year of nfl injuries damn
damn i feel for stanley smh this game has been hard injury wise and its only near the end of the first quarter christ
fuck man you never want to see that hope stanley can bounce back but that doesnt look good
this is a super long 1st quarter
ravens fans are really blaming that on tj so dumb
jackson was in the grasp that play shouldve been whistled dead and that wouldve never happened
jesus at least stanley got paid this week
brutal for stanley hope he can come back okay
man edmunds was in position to intercept that
lamar is reckless when he throws man keep up pressure and hes gonna make more mistakes we just need to capitalize
lamar makes some bad plays when hes pressured hes too cocky and tries to force it
at least itll be the second quarter so offence can start playing
defense gonna get tired real quick if offense doesnt pick up the slack
he got pushed outside flag maybe
late hit on mccloud he was almost out of bounds
i feel like weve had the ball for 26 seconds this entire game so far
how are yall not catching a fucking football straight in your hands
offense will wake up and unleash hell in the second half such is steeler football we only get one good half a game from the offense embrace it
samuels gives us nothing on offense really think if we had a preseason he doesnt see the roster
listen im no football genius but samuels washington and ebron all getting targets before juju does seems like bad game planning
rip this game if defense needs to be on the field 85 of the game
gus edwards isnt walter fucking payton guys
the offense has got to do their job our d is getting gassed already
yeah this looks bad our defense cant keep this up for four quarters if something doesnt change on offense this is going to get ugly
minkah lit him up surprised lamar bounce back up that quickly
the defense has been on the field the entire time because we cant move the ball
que this thread turning into a dumpster fire lmfaooo
alualu being out is very apparent were getting murdered up the middle
were missing alalu bad right now
watt pissed
tj doing what i want to do every week

scream at butler
pouncey giving me heartburn with some of these snaps lol
if i have to choose between tj and butler ill take the guy who doesnt consistently put linebackers on wide receivers
if this goes against the steelers
let me guess ravens sub is saying the steelers are dirty for that lol
even if it was an accident if the roles were reversed people would be calling for the steeler who touched a reffs head
this is reminding of me of that niners game where they sucked ass but we somehow sucked ass even more even with all the turnovers we got
on the bright sidethe defense finally got a chance to rest
i meannnnnnnn if the titans can come back after shitting the bed we can right right
i legit feel like im watching the 2019 steelers right now
how do you fumble a ball 4 yards away and still retrieve it that easily
nvm thats not a pickfuck me
im getting jesse james flashbacks
oh thats incomplete
theyll overturn this
we just need to make lamar pass cant keep getting gashed by the run
they do the same rpo every other play
bud is getting eaten up by the option he doesnt know where that ball is going
if only we had alualu absolutely killing is with these rpos
why cant every game be against the browns
i found a stream to watch this but wishing i didnt
holy smokes tomlin youve got your work cut out for you in the half
we are getting thoroughly dominated on both sides of the ball
3 ravens with 50 rushing yards this year

also that runwe just gave the best kicker in the nfl a chip shot at least by his standard
offense needs to score opening up the half only way they can get any momentum going
thank goodness for the clock running out lol i honestly dont know what the halftime adjustment is this reminds me of the ne games where belichick would seem to know everything we were going to do before we did it
game is still manageable we need to get our shit together though
ben with a whopping 24 passing yards
could be a lot worse than being down 10 with our offense getting shut out
cant go fucking 3 and out leaving this locker room we will not win defense is already winded like i cant believe weve been on the field for a total of 5 min lol
could be worse could be the 24 patriots
coach cowher has a good point more no huddle the raven speed is blanketing the receivers and keeping the pressure on ben hope to see some adjustments cause doing the same thing that failed and expecting different results is you know
did he need to tackle him for that to be counted a pi ffs
thanks refs
did samuels pay off fichtners debts or something
these fucking refs
offense is straight ass
so they acknowledge possession is an issue then proceed to get off the field in 44 seconds
did tomlin fuck all the refs wives or are they just blind
starting to get hard to watch
bens just lobbing mortars down the field lol
really no flag there this game is so aggravating

whatever still early in the half hopefully defense made adjustments to stop the run something that we shouldnt even be having problems with lol
thats it sign white lamar woodley to a five year extension
lets gooooo steelers
thank fuck
why doesnt the offense throw to the uncovered receiver everytime
fuck we needed that so bad
nobody touch bens right arm
liking where were at right now a lot
in spite of all the negatives were only down by 3
lamar is going to throw one more pick it is written life is a simulation
spillane is filling in quite well
how in the fuck do i stop these text messages about voting


fuck its everyday i tag them as spam and they just use a new number
spillane is legit honestly i was frustrated with the amount of big plays bush was letting up im not saying its not a loss to the defense but its not completely fucked right
ebron makes some incredible fucking efforts hes becoming a god to guy for big ben
great catches on this drive
juju what a man
let ben call his own plays from now on
guys i changed into my james harrison bumble bee jersey at half time i dont think im going to wear any other jersey the rest of the season
fuck anyone who ever doubted our glorious leader
leadchange
a lot of halftime hot takes lookin real stupid now
thats the kind of offense i like seeing

lets fucking go
holy shit this game has swung 3 and out time boys
you like that
onner
how the fuck do we have the lead
tony is too good on the commentary
i feel like juju makes at least one of those stay balanced and scramble for 5 yards and a conversion plays every game
told you we always play good at least one half
all the fair weather fans sucking bens dick now
where all those negative naceys pir defense is awful we are already out of this game
conner really started working for his money
at some point one of these fumbles gonna be snatched up by the steelers just a matter of time
spillane has really been doing a great job
there u go watt there u fucking goo
thats a great play tj
that count as a sack
watt is a monster
this second half is a completely different game i am happy one more solid offensive drive and ill feel damn good
i started drinking ic light when we started coming back i have to keep drinking it i fucking hate ic light tho anything for the team tho
bengals up 24 7 on the titans steelers hangover for the titans
that was a bigggg 3rd down stop hopefully we can get some points even a field goal
he couldve ran 90 yards
playing against the ravens the refs and the field
mcfarland is still running if he had just gone left
maybe dont play mcfarland when youre that deep
buggs really turned it around this half
thank god just two more hours of this game
are they playing prevent or something

whole middle of the field is open
this 3rd and long defense is so bad sometimes is it because of the reliance on pressure
theyre too busy chasing down lamar they let everyone else open
hes out


let them lose a challenge
knee is out thanks for the to harbaugh
hes out but just run the same play again youll get it
tomlin level challenge there
4th quarter starts then all of a sudden our d cant do a thing wtffffff this hot and cold defense drives me nuts
we start dominating in the run game and the secondary decides they should just leave one guy uncovered every play
that 3rd and 14 really killed us
tony really wants this td jeez
theres always that one drive where our d just seems lost out there but they repeatedly come through when it matters lets not completely give up on them already theres a lot of game left
this is going to stand if not im going to need to get a new coffee table
i think romo is a ravens fan
could romo be any more for the ravens in this game
his knee was down but out of bounds
our coverage is dogshit
i swear the way they cheer they are local ravens announcers
its not a steelers game unless you have at least 3 heart attacks
nothing new they never give ben the late hit or roughing the passer
ebron is a man amongst boys today
good to see the ravens getting flags
man i really like mccloud a lot hes so damn fast
pats losing with 30 seconds left
lets run maybe once
juju the fighter
i love juju so much
juju with a whole lotta heart
lets go juju we have to sign him to an extension love how he played steeler football
hurt ben is best ben
nice drive ben
please d give us another turnover
they just cant cover claypool and i love it
ok d


give me one more clamp down baby
i love juju
wow boswell moved past franco harris on the all time steelers scoring list
i dont think we had a rb on the field once that drive
ok were up 4 defense needs to hold here too much time on the clock have to punch them in the mouth here
started claypool last game and diontae this game but idfc lets win this game
that drive was pissed ben
dont like how much time we left on the clock but ive got confidence in our defense to go out there and get the stop
8 plays 80 yards 0 running backs
the back two quarters of the titans game and the front two quarters of this game our offense has been not great

love to see us turning it around here
this game is going to give me a heart condition
juju is our number one wr he may not lead in targets or yards but he leads with his toughness and by example hes channeling his inner ward today
we need a stop here
defense i fucking beg you to get a stop
get a stopppppppppp
in other news browns lost to the raiders
theyre gonna have to play this 4th down this play decides the game imo
ohhhh mama i can hear them a comin and i dont have very long
peak pittsburgh vs baltimore right here the all 22 tape of this game is gonna be super interesting bc it looks like we are just running a 43 especially on this last drive
pats and browns lost again thats something
ohhhhhhh mama i can hear them a coming and i dont have very long
we did it reddit renegade for the win
we can not be punting out of our endzone
great game it was worth losing 3 years of longevity
should not have ran it up the middle but what do i know
of all the times we dont use a screen pass lol
we need derek watt back
are they fucking booing
losing cam is not ideal hopefully hes ok
fuck all those booing trash pieces of shit
baltimore fans are fucking retarded hes totally faking it to give them a timeout and put time back on the clock
ravens fans booing an injury stay classy
why boo someone whos hurt
wheeeeeewwww stay classy baltimore you fucks
holy fucking shit how did we win
fuck the ravens
damn son

70

and it wasnt easy
fuck all the negative nancys we live for this shit 7 0 motherfuckers renegades mount up
70 fuck the ravens
perfect throw my ass romo you just said it was the wrong read
snead got laid out talked all of that shit all game
i hope heyward is ok
that was exactly the game i expected to see from these teams this is why we watch
that fucking penalty was a game changer
ref assisted tds piss me off so much
10 points is insurmountable with this impotent offense
classy fucking raven losers booing for a free timeout fuck the ravens and their shit fucking fanbase
blast the renegade
im not gay but when i see juju sometimes i wonder
steelers still havent beat a good team
turned down a bunch of plans today to watch this game on my couch the exact same way i did last week

here we gooo
give lamar credit perfect throw cams penalty was huge though
connor is legit the only offensive player whos showed up today
refs why are you giving them calls


one of their guys hit one of your guys
im very glad were up 4 and not 3
romo is usually good hes a clown this game
4 plays in a row someone is wide fucking open this is fucking ridiculous tomlin need to get on thete ass
the inability of the defense to be able to get a stop on third down is so frustrating this has been a problem all season but a nightmare today in particular
strapping into the game thread like mr bones wild ride
god damn im already nervous
rain game lets fuckin go
deep breathes deep breathes
lets gooooooo
lets fucking goooooo1
lets go spilllanneeee
nighttrane spillane
but spillane is so much slower
holy spillane

are we back to being the lb kings of the league
nice lets keep this going and fuck those rat birds
tj is heading straight at jackson every time smart
he was inbounds when he got hit
dude what an absolute joke of a call
horseshit
horse shit
hes just pushing him out of bounds refs wtf
so were playing against the refs too
what a shitty call
pussy league
thats ridiculous
our defenses biggest weakness is penalities but that calls bullshit
that penalty was fucking bullshit
bs call
bullshit call
lemar is a runner in bounds that means he can get popped refs
weak sauce refs trying to make this game close
100 in bounds shouldnt have been a penalty but hes going out of bounds why even try and lay a big hit youre about to get off the field its 3rd down
i hate the refs more than i hate the ravens
and time for a fumble
should have been off the field already
honestly that penalty really hurt but it looks like we are controlling jackson
bullshit drive gotta keep the foot on the pedal regardless
fuck you refs
well that lead was short lived what a load of horse shit for that 15 yard penalty
who let those footlocker employees on the field
lol imagine if they never called that unnecessary roughness so dumb he wasnt even out of bounds
i cant stand nfl refs
if the refs dont give that cupcake call this game is over ravens team isnt built to play from behind
flaghappy crew today
clearly this game is going to be annoying with all the penalties
i see i see today will be a day of penalties
well shit
fuuuuuuuuuuuuck
rookie mistake kiing ourselves
two huge mistakes simply cant make mistakes like this in a big game
im gonna just do some h fuck this game
i better see tomlin fuckin screaming at this team
damn there have been so many stoppages in this game at this pace we wont finish til like 500
big bud
man we have to find a way to keep bud
lamar jackson exists
steelers d im about to end this mans whole career
alualu down son of a bitch
holy shit alualu and diontae hurt is really big
this shit is why you dont freak out every time something bad happens we can cause fumbles and recover them too
eat bud eat
thank you bud dupree and vince williams

phew
bud
fucking love these games

dang offense need to keep the drive going and give the d a break
a run on 3rd and 10
offense looking shaky it seems like we cant figure the defense out just yet
randy wtf was that
a run on 3rd and long
can they move the ball down the fucking field ffs
and a shitty punt fantastic
sick run on 3rd and long deep in our own territory awesome
oh berrys punting again lol
should have just punted on 3rd down or taken a knee if youre going to be that passive
what the fuck is this playcalling seriously second half titans and now this awful awful offensive playcalling
glad to have berry back
jordan berry fucking sucks cock
can we just not have a punter and go for it every 4th down
looking like our defense is going to need to be stout we have two takeaways but the ravens are moving the ball and we are not
that was an easy holding call
terrible hold on bud
lamar tiptoes like that and as soon as we nail him that draws a penalty lmao
lets not call holding at all
damnit man i hate to see injuries on either side
3rd sack
defense is monsterous

hate injuries though hope the raven is ok
fuck dude hate that for him and the ravens
thats a tough loss stanleys a good olineman
thats awful hate seeing these guys in so much pain
fuck man these injuries on both sides
this looks bad hes been down for a while
that is not good for the ravens fuck
they have an air cast for stanley and they are bringing out the cart not good
prayers for stanley that look like it fucking hurt
hate to see someone get rolled up on defenselessly no doubt some ligament damage in that knee hope hes alright
broken ankle for sure that was ugly
3 sacks already forced fumble pick 6 good job defense
fuck these commercial breaks holy shit
ravens going crazy saying tj did that on purpose rn like no he did miss lamar on purpose fuck over your tackle
i didnt want this game decided by injuries or refs bull shit
defense is carrying
as much as i feel for stanley im really happy he got his money when he did no doubt hell come back and continue to be a great player but now hes got the money to back him up
defense is ballingoffense is still on the bus
oh man im just waiting for us to pick one of those lobs jackson keeps doing
longest quarter of all time
lamar jackson gets punished

commercial lamar jackson commercial for nfl 2021
dang those passes are usually picked they got so lucky
half the ravens sub is saying how dirty tj is lol
lamar is making some bad decisions with those throws when he goes down hopefully we grab one for another int
defensive battle so far

steelers offense about to score a td right now
how was that not a late hit out of bounds i mean if you go by the standard of the earlier call against us
we have to lead the league in dropped balls
if the ravens can catch these the steelers should too
ben has every right to be pissed rn our receivers hands are butter
finally good punt
wow we actually had a good punt for once
at least the play calling was okay execution sucked on that drive though
giving the ravens this many chances on offense is so stupid
sigh we live and die by ben always hes gotta start throwing better if we want to win this
robert spillane is our best offensive player so far
heal up alualu
ugh we should be up by 2 tds by now wtf is up with this offense
alalu is needed badly
this is the most predictable offense in the league why are we struggling so much its either a run or playaction every single fucking play
wow they cant stop anything
hopefully were able to make some good halftime adjustments for defense and offense can wake the fuck up
time of possession must be like 101
jackson got fucked smacked by minkah
time to answer bitches
the offense needs to do something or its over
this is on ben and the play calling
i miss tyson alualu
baltimores backup olineman are dominating at the line of scrimmage
at least now the defense has a chance to catch their breath and make some adjustments lets hope ben can get into his rhythm weve been a second half team for a while now except last game of course
only down by seven offense needs to wake the hell up and put some points on the board still a lot of game left and its not the first time weve had to make a come back
pretty clear how dominant alualu is in the run game
defense has a td and fumble offense needs to step up
guys we knew this game wasnt gonna be a walk in the park
we reaaaaally need to get it going on offense
watt is pissed
aside from 23 big throws ben has been good his wrs need to step up
nice knuckle ball ben
keith butler yelling at watt makes me want to fire him personally
damn tj was screaming
we have to throw the ball if we want to win
this is steelers ravens football
at least this is giving our defense a little extra rest lol
really out here punching refs
judone
even if the hit itself was unintentional he took the risk by getting involved in the scuffle so i dont feel bad for him
offense get it the fuck together christ
to not get points there is horrible
our offense is god awful today and this is coaching we clearly had no gameplan today
fuck this offense is anemic
thank god the refs took so long to discuss so the defense can get a little rest
got any more of them defensive points
ben always plays bad at mt people saying to bench ben is ridiculousrudolph wouldve thrown 2 picks by now
these goddamned political adds every break are just pissing me off
not the elbow fuckk
not the elbow please god no
lets see what pissed off watt does
lets hope coaches make adjustments in the half and we come out swinging
goddamnit we really needed that
i mean he has control
no way that give us that
idkkkk dawggg thats lowkey control with one hand
need those 3rd down stops
why dont the ravens ever get called for fouls
lets go offense in the 2nd half cant just let the the d keep us in the game without repaying the effort
thats like 3 near turnovers by lamar luck just isnt on our side
the fact that we are only down a touchdown is a blessing alone good job d
if that play was made by marcus peters wed all say it hit the ground
half time adjustments then we will be okay
how many fucking commercial is even legal for a non us resident
carving us up like a thanksgiving turkey thats what happens when your offense cant sustain a drive
whole defense is staring at lamar while fucking gus edwards rips us apart
tj was within 5 yards of lamar surprised there wasnt a roughing the passer call
stop the run ffs
oh look spillane 34 yards behind his assignment
tucker always makes those

i swear to fucking god if we put rudolph out there
what an embarrassing end to the half
we got wrecked that half ngl was not pretty
if we put rudolph our there im throwing shit at my tv
we should be down by 30 or so that first half was completely garbage
being down by 10 with the way the offense has looked is better than expected
our offense is single handedly destroying our defense a 3 and out at the start of the 3rd might just kill the whole game
if it werent for that pick six it would be 170 we need our offense to wake up
only three passes with positive yards in two quarters the steelers usually exceed that in one drive
who had spillane outscoring our entire offense d didnt look great but not much they can do with they way the offense is playing tomlin better fire these guys up
just some stressful pittsburgh steelers football baby
i feel like our offense is just too soft for physical teams like baltimore
if we dont start spying lamar hard in the second half something is very wrong
miracle to only be down 10 need points on this drive or its going to get rough fellas
thank fuck no rudolph
having grown up in western pa but not being there since i was 18 now im 36 and getting lucky to have a pittsburgh area stream today seeing that edgar snyder and associates commercial brings back tons of memories
yep were fucked shouldve been dpi but who am i kidding
thats on the refs my god
bad passes and no flags
that is a fucking joke
refball
no flag are you fucking serious
how is that not pi
can someone let footlocker know that some of their employees are attempting to ref a professional football game
refs doing us 0 favors today either
wow right in his face no flag
i know i asked for less penalties earlier but what the fuck
it shouldnt have to come to this but i think dj has a much better likelihood of getting a call if he keeps trying to fight and run through it rather than just throwing his arms up
oh fuck these refs cant have lamar lose again hes hyped as much as mahomes
so offense comes out and does the same exact shit good job coming up with something at halftime
welp that drive was supposed to breathe life into us here comes another 1000 baltimore offensive drive for a touchdown
he has to keep playing you cant veg for the flag during the play
holy shit thats some of the worst ive ever seen they missed three three different opportunities to call pi okay fosho refs
honestly the steelers deserve to lose with the way they are playing
must score a td now
i have no idea why baltimore is throwing a single pass
ben looking like prime maddox
wow awesome break for the defense rest momentum
i hate when lamar smiles after getting picked
takes a freaking crossing route damn thats hard to have in a game plan
lets build on this momentum boys
fuck the doubters
do you hear that its the winds of change
take the kick dont take points off the board rn

edit nm i didnt know the kick didnt count cause the refs are slow af
throwing that shade nantz
wtf why do we have to kick it again
i grew a beard waiting for the extra point
if it was a ravens penalty why do we have to kick again
we still in thissomehow
all that achieved was that our kicker got iced when we are getting rewarded with a penalty
ben is sleeping on the field he needs to get fired up
lamar is our biggest playmaker right now
another pick come on lets go
fans is this a nfl game or the twilight zone

steelers yes
renegade


stop the run they cant pass but they will try to run
gonna get a spillane jersey
holy shit we forced a 3 and out
i might need to get a spillane jersey this fuckin man has won my heart
spillane has made some big plays for us this game he is gonna get paid by some team after this season guaranteed
spillane is playing some great football in place of bush
fucking finally
haha steelers doing the flacco gameplan to the ravens
im not above running the joe flacco offense just throw it up and hope for pi call
looking like a completely different team this half
ben is taking over this game now


let him free coach
im guessing ben started calling the plays
claypool pushed while out of bounds no flag only for their star qb
fuck yes juju
jujuuu
smh just run the ball now we wasted a timeout
just run the ball please
i love juju unselfish and gives his all
why not just bring in our fb and pound it in like any other team
back in the lead boys
thats good stuff
keep this going
great adjustments
here we go steeelrs
fuck the ratbirds
td conner
and suddenly its a whole new game
tale of two halves keep it up and bring it home
incredible drive excellent adjustments
alright defense make lamar make mistakes and make the ravens throw the ball
dont look no farther baby im back here
that claypool run is almost like a read option
lets go d make lamar throw it
just let ben run the offense please
defense has to keeping playing the way they have and offense needs to keep this long drives up
look what the cat dragged in our fucking offense
have yall chilled out some now
of course my dish network screws up in the middle of the game its bad enough cbs screwed up the broadcast last week
god these games are literally going to fucking kill me
im the steelers v titans first halfsteelers v ravens second half and i have directv

and im the steelers v titans second halfsteelers v ravens first half and i have cable
bengals elite maybe we have beat a good team
wtf are the titans doing bruh
sooooooooo clooooooooose
fuckkkkkk recovering that wouldve been huge
almost had another pick there
the rules for turnovers suck lol
god the ravens should have like 3 extra turnovers
love me some highsmith
we cant get cute tho
t jaayyyy
the defense is heating up and the offense is awake look the fuck out
the rat birds are fucking rattled i love it
if we start getting conservative now im going to sack my refrigerator like it banged my gf
if he didnt trip he has a huge gain
stays on his feet and thats the longest offensive play all day
man he had room if he didnt stumble there
ugh pls no 3 n out
lol titans are getting worked by the bungles
diontae is frustrated
god the defense is really gonna have to step up again with this field position
well that was a wet fart of a series
our defense is gonna have to be the side to win the game today clearly
there we go buggs
buggs is playing well too
who is this imposter that definitely wasnt a punt from jordan berry
buggs suggs
buggs energy is what we need rn
that wasnt a screen i dont blame ben for getting rid of the ball you have to be careful on that part of the field the play was dead pre snap because we didnt get the right protection call in which is extremely tough against that double a gap look though
even if we somehow lose this game im satisfied at least we didnt keel over after they were owning us in the first half just stop the run against these guys and theyre chump change well kick their asses in pittsburgh
4 year sacks streak thats insane man
absolutely inexcusable to give that up
time for this sub to go back to shitting on edmunds
roll out the red carpet on 2nd 22
what in the fuck is this coverage thats twice now
glad he never learned to toe tap
i want to get off mr bones wild ride
our defense plays better when were losing
fucking secondary is wet cardboard right now
so we gonna leave them wide open on every play
big divot from the knee on the line
look guys the secondary sucks because theyre selling out to stop the run and considering the first half its been worth it
dont forget romo was a cowboy
what is this the commercial bowl
ravens really gonna score 3 tds in one drive lol
they called it not a catch if its close its not coming back
4 man zone is useless when youre all 5 years off
defense completely shit the bed this drive
pls ben dont listen to randy this drive
defense is gassed offense has to do something fg td anything
honestly were lucky its even as close as it is ravens have made it hard for themselves by turning the ball over so much steelers defense hasnt done anything but blow coverages and get lucky with bad throws the steelers really could be losing like 3010
shut up romo cbs has the field mics turned to 11
lamar gets that call every time
if that tb12 or mahommes that would of been ejection
ebron is having an awesome game
i hate that playcall even though it worked out for us
its only 1 yard we can do this
frantic ben is the best ben
juju has heart
juju has the heart
juju is back baby
short play short play flag thats how we move the ball boys
hearing the words new england patriots fourth consecutive loss would almost make it not hurt so bad to lose this game

hearing them and winning would be sublime
there it is claypool
thats my qb
claypool jersey being ordered today
air canada
lol thats how open claypool is when there are no penalties
time to fire up this fucking d
good thing we benched ben and started planning for the draft like the people on this game thread wanted
what a response need the defense to hold them off
clayyyypoooollll love this man
why must every ravens game be like this
that td means nothing if we cant stop them now
juju has been so damn reliable we need to keep him
defense now has to play like they get paid to play the game
dupree needs to stop doing half measures
that pitch run is killing us no answer
stop somebody
we need to shut them down right here
man they are working the clock and trying to make this the final drive
no not cam
fuck me not cam
oh great now hayward is banged up fantastic
i mean the defense was always bound to have a humble pie game but did it have to be this one
we need a turnover
blitz let lamar make a mistake throwing it he will
alright fourth down
they are going to try to get us to jump
heyward back only was a cramp it seems
defense take my energy
does anyone have any spare blood pressure medication
theyre definitely gonna go for it theyre not gonna kick the fg
this is the biggest two minutes of the year this d needs to show their the best there is
i dont think i can handle this
one more stop
jackson is someone to be afraid of and heres why hes stopped
i will take back every single bad thing i have said about the defense if they make this one stop
classic steeler heartattack football lets gooooooo
im not sold on lamar jackson until he proves he can be more than michael vick dont get me wrong he is good but eventually age kicks in and you slow down will he be able to be as good when he has to rely on his arm more than his legs
im not sure what made me happier the stop or seeing 97 back on the field
omg omg omg i had renegade cranked and was flying the towel i cant believe it thank you buggs
okay boys its heart palpitations time
who no fullback
cmon berry need a great punt
time for the last minute heart attack
where the fuck is benny snell in that situation
please jordan berry i know i talked shit but this is so important
why the fuck do you run it up the middle when the box is stacked as shit
intentional grounding you pricks
come on be okay hayward
oh fuck cam
i hope heyward is ok
fucking soft coverage man fuck
record heart attacks for me in this game
ugh not cam heyward
trash ravens fans booing
booing an injured player classless
win or lose its going to suck if cam is hurt badly
i cant believe it i didnt expect to win that game

thanks minkah for being there
yes ravens boooooo your tears sustain me
but pittsburgh hasnt beaten anyone good
that how its done ugly as fuck but i love it i love it i lovit
minkah with the great pass breakup
jesus lets go but if heyward is done for the year were fucked
70 complete control of the afc north gotta love it
wow next week 80
7 0 motherfuckers
get fucked you rat bird pieces of shit

kings of the north 70
romo needs to stop chugging jacksons dick like seriously hes had 3 ints today and a couple close fumbles
1 penalty deflated all the air in this teams tire fucking shit
dont want lamar to get hurt but love to see all the hits on him
this thread be like throw in the towel 610 here we come

like the steelers ravens games dont always go this way
every time big ben touches his elbow the entire steeler nation holds its breath
only thing lamar can do is run
hey tomlin can we change our game plan after this half thanks
down 10 and youre all ready to say the season is lost

yeah it was a bad half shit happens they can adjust
im going to die in my fucking 40s from eating pierogies drinking beer and watching steelers football
blatant pi no call keep getting gifted the game ravens shit
they even make a ravens penalty sound like the steelers fucked up
if we miss this im killing people next time i play among us
did we go back to ben not calling the plays again that 3rd down play was sus
i think they are going to run out of commercials
seahawks fan here thank you so much i have hated the hype around lamar jackson for the longest time pittsburgh to the super bowl you guys are earning it
fuck donald
dont forget the only reason why the ravens have any points is because of the refs
jesus christ the whole defense just decided to watch lamar pick up that first down

someone steps up we might get that fumble
anyone shitting on big benya moms a hoe
tony romo will not stop sucking off the ravens even after we score
over reacting betas up in here chill if we win following adversity itll be that much sweeter relaaaaxxxxxxx
oh no stanley is a stud doesnt look good
i dont know what happened to stanley but it looks nasty

wishing him the best
the ravens sub is a joke they think tj did this on purpose
when conner is the most effective player on your offense you know you have a problem
his ability to only punt 30 yards came in handy there
insane how easily they can convert on 3rd down
fuck only lamar could fumble forward like that
guess were hoping their offense gets super tired running all over us
argument for it is his hands dont move and neither does the ball hes got control
jackson cant keep that up hes been taking a lot of hits this game
defense is really getting dominated by backup offensive lineman running backs
the tomlin haters are crawling out of their caves

edit moms basements
the looks on bens face are really scaring me he cannot get hurt
idiot ref being unable to cover his nose with the mask
win or lose steeler v ratbird football is always a good game
i could watch jackson get sacked and intercepted all day
ngl but im pretty terrified
lamar about to be exposed yet again looking forward to it
folks im scared
i have worn my color rush harrison jersey every sunday this season i should definitely wear t today right
lfg
very very nervous today
i dislike the ravens
big play spillane
spillane yo self
great start
inject this into my veins
what the fuck this dude is an animal lmaoooo
my pecker is so hard right now
getting browns game flashbacks
spillane baby ahahahahahahaha lets go
suck my dick lamar pick sixxxxxx
spillane wasnt that the 2nd time in the last three games weve had an opening drive pick 6 as well
ahhhhhhhh lets goooooo
i wont jump to crazy conclusions off 1 play but


pittsburgh goin to a supabowl
spillane is a legend now
oh man that was beautiful
lets fucking go
lets gooo
someone called it a play where defense would score points who was it
spillane the goat
spillane

how much do you love this guy

undrafted player
watch spillane have a breakout year i already liked him as soon as they put him in this year
spillane making his presence known
spillane lets go
that was neat
spillane huge
spillannneeee
maybe that gigantic hit on derrick henry turned spillane into the dpoy like in a movie
bob spillane killer bs renewed
ghostface spilla
wtf we scored a touch already
spillane took next man up pretty damn literally

love this man
spillane the goat
wow fucking awful call jackson was trying to get more yards

what the fucking fuck how
fuck it pick him again
fucking refball
ref what the fuck
that was not late
ravens already getting bailed out
lets make jackson afraid to hold onto the ball today
oh the refs i love how much you hate us
what bullshit lamar wasnt even out of bounds yet
he was in bounds
thats bullshit
so if he was on the hashmark no problem


but because he lands out if bounds its a penalty ok
what a bullshit call
fuck the pussy ravens
game plan is just hit lamar every play whether he has the ball or not and im okay with it
hes dancing around in bounds and not out yet when we hit shoved him out thats bullshit
soft as fuck
shocker the ex qb thinks that was a penalty
fuck refs
they have lamar down every play someone on him he cant run
refs keeping the rat birds in this
this is why i hate these penalties we should have been off the field but these refs screw us on a clean play in bounds with no blown whistle
fuck the ravens gifted a fucking touchdown
come on defense lets do this thing
4 minutes into the game and im cracking beer 2

soon to be 3
i know im late but that call was such bullshit were not allowed to hit players who are inbounds now
butt tackle 2020
who the fuck are you trying that shit boy

not sure who that was yelling it at jackson but that was great lol
the world would be better if refs didnt exist
why do we always have to be pittsburgh with stupid decisions the where out

we need one guy just keeping eyes on lamar
how much the refs paid today
shocking first play a run next once again
makeup call
fuck get your shit together guys
fuck
ok defense needs to step up
i thought he managed to get that back for a second
beating ourselves
because i am a steelers fan im going to over react this is fucking bullshit forreals though
if you dont love that you dont love afc north football babeeeey
so question not saying this is what happened but perfect example

balls on the ground for a fumble there is a clear recovery by a guy before the pile gets there and when the pile is done the other team has the ballwhose ball
its gonna be a nail biter boys buckle up and grab another cold one were in it for the long haul
gotta stop giving them 46 yards per rush
i like the way we are hitting jackson on every play
they said the ball is slick out there today theres no reason for our defense to strip a ball too
ravens fans already blaming tj for the injury lol
im not liking the success of ravens first down plays
both lead blocks massive holds no call
this is going to get ugly
alualu fuuuuuck
bud is a fucking animal
fuck yes dupree
defensive game it is
lets fucking goooo
tyson is a huge loss damn
offense has to have a nice long drive please no 30
of course alualu and diontae are hurt
bud dupree was on that ass
you know what i noticed with that claypool fumble is that we got a matchup advantage there dont be shocked if we go back to that later on peters
so i am angry at the bullshit heyward penalty dont get me wrong
but man this feels like a 2010 game
im gonna have a heart attack this game
bud brought a buddy
we gotta get some more efficient runs on this drive we cant win without a big game from conner
how far up your own ass do you have to be to make an ad like that fedex one
am i the only one that yells at the tv for ben to fucking hike the ball lol
i know their d is good but we look fucking horrid
ben doesnt seem on same page with his receivers when he throws the deep ball
a fucking run on 3rd and 10
someone pls explain to me that decision to rush on 3rd down there wtaf
are they even trying to play offense
run on 3rd 10
buckle up this is gonna be a tough one
why run it there we have to pass the ball on 3rd and long
my mom can do better play calling than this
run on 3rd and 10 wtf is going on im definitely not feeling great rn their offense has moved the ball a lot more effectively than ours has so far
the defense cannot carry us if the offense is gonna be this bad also classic shit from berry
a short run on 3rd 10 is so typical
how is that better than colquit
does anything make these threads angrier than a third and long draw play
lmao a draw on 310 why r they so scared
of course the offense comes out looking like dog shit
wtf was that
lol a fucking run really
jesus christ we need a punter
after that run on 3rd and 11 both eric ebron and ben shrugged their shoulders in disgust towards the sideline likely complaining about a running call on 3rd and long a randy fichtner specialty
theres gotta be better punters out there resigning berry is a joke
theres the classic berry we all expect
good thing berrys back

right guys
yo dude what the fuck was that punt
does the front office believe that berry is the only punter in the world
oh yeah fucking beautiful dont even try on 3rd just to have an absolute shit punt
jordan berry is lucky he has a job with us
this is such a weird game
i have a hard time believe it that berry is one of the best 32 punters in the world
fuck jordan berry
was colquit really not better than 34 yards
missi matthews reports tyson alualu is doubtful to return
bud was held wtf
that hold on bud
i get why you wouldnt wanna risk anything on 3rd 10 inside your own 20 against this defense but were gonna have to improve a lot offensively and were gonna have to it fast because our defense has basically been on the field the entire 1st quarter and as great as our defense is youre not going to last especially against this physical offense
ben can pooch punt 34 yards
have to be afraid hitting him anywhere near the line because of those refs
no hold on bud or anything
it amazes me in a world of 7 billion people that we cant find one person who can consistently punt a football 50 yards
tuitt killed 2 people on that sack
bud held on two straight plays
notlikethis
so many injuries today man
is stanley the one that got paid
hope stanley is ok
injuries just fucking suck hope for a quick recovery
feel bad for stanley looked awful
hope hes okay as much as i hate the ratbirds its terrible to see someone get hurt
broke his ankle damn
i hope stanley will be ok
that injury does not look pretty
that looks bad prayers up hate to see it cant tell if its ankle or knee but the ankle looked loose to me for lack of a better word
ffuuuu get better my man
thats fucking awful
so many injuries so far i hope we dont see many more sucks to see guys on either side hurting like that
dt alaualu doubtful to return

fuck
its nice to hear he at least got paid if its a bad injury fuck i hate knees
god must be looking out for stanley though sucks he got injured but at least he got paid literally a day before this happened
just getting to a device just wanted to express that unnecessary roughness penalty that gifted them a td was some bullshit
god damn i hate seeing people get injured hope stanleys season isnt over
oh fuck the replay of stanley looked terrible hate to see it
speaking from experience getting rolled up like that is hell wish the best for stanley
oh my that fall looked terrible you really hate to see that hope the dude is alright
these defenses on both sides are mucking this game up and i love it
goddamn lamar fucking with our sack numbers
i was worried about this game but so far i think they match up well against the ravens offense needs to get going
if the offense doesnt start doing something were gonna be in big trouble boys
defence adjusting nicely

need a long td drive
classic ravenssteelers game hard fought football
now why wasnt that shove a late hit out of bounds
bengals are up 10 on the titans the hell is happening today
fire haley
so we have 3 sacs this game
lets go getting some passing plays in
catch the fucking ball
is mason rudolph back in
i do not understand those passes from ben
the offense hasnt been passed the 35
what the fuck is this offense doing 4 plays 3 plays 5 plays
lets just skip to second half steelers
to the untrained eye it looks like the offense is stalling early on


tj watt is asking for this moar sacks
so much for flipping the field big chunk plays are hurting thats like 4 so far
theyll never call a hold for our defense every team we play gets a little help
what was all that about being 1 ranked defense and all that i know the o isnt giving them any chance to get a break but really
ravens already have 100 rushing yards come on you gotta make the stops
down their best tackle and still running down our throats
run run run more runs

fucking stop the run

our offense needs to fucking move the chains and give our defense a breather
man we are getting shredded this game we have to step it up baltimore is controlling regardless of the score we have by far been the worse team so far
love that every year we get our ass beat by 10 yard passes because we run a zone coverage then come out the next year and run the exact same zone coverage
he tried to play it off but jackson got pegged there
defense is getting gassed offense has to figure some shit out or else this is going to be a long game
ben and the rest of the offense needs to step up rn
without that stupid fumble by them they would have had 21 points already too easy
all run plays wow
we need a long drive on offense to give the d some time to rest and make adjustments
it would be nice if ben pulled his head out of his ass and responded on this next drive
i cant help but think if the refs didnt gift the ravens first drive this game would be different
offense has been trash for 4 quarters now

the offense better step it up because the defense is getting tired from always being on the field
keeping jaylen samuels on the roster is the worst decision the front office has made in the 21st century
alualus absence is proving to be bigger than imagined
alright time for the offense to burn the rest of the clock and move the ball down the field to put some points on the board before the half and then get it back at the start of the second half for another good drive give the defense a good rest and let them come back to kick ass in the second half on a banged up ravens offense
this is some intense fairweather fans in this thread its not even halftime down by a score and everyone is acting like the sky is falling
dont matter if lamar turns it over if our offense cant get it together this game is over

shit reminds me of the rudolphhodges offense smfh
wow tj is upset
wtf is butler yelling at tj for

what the fuck is he supposed to do when they got arms wrapped around him
was that watt getting hot
conner is the only thing thats effective right now
was that watt and butler yelling at each other on the sideline
ben has been off on the deep ball for much of this year hope he and the receivers start to click more consistently before the end of the season need that as a threat and weapon in the playoffs against the better teams
our offense is so stagnant
throw judon out what a turd
dj has like 4 injuries whats he doing getting in a fight
they can go anyway with this

fucking body slammed our guy on the ground
lmfao fuck the birds
lol good job judon
these announcers sticking up for guy
see ya bitch boy
i dunno if that was intentional
go home judon youre drunk
peters is a trash player get him outta here
this game is now canceled
conners giving us some good yards
juju in the shadow realm
3rd down time for ben to try to throw it over the mountains
our offense is pissing me tf off
just turned the game on how are we doing
what the fuck is going on
come on same scheme saw it coming no one can get open
out of fg rangenice
how does ben get so many balls batted down bro youre 65
would be cool if ben would stop sucking
some things never change love how bad our play calling is on offense
offense has really killed the team today
ben fighting off a defender to recover the ball is so fucking cool
offense is stagnant
its ok not a great start but lots of football left


steelers defense clamping down


offense wearing down the ravens d
d must stop them getting points before the half
i see the steelers went into the locker room at halftime in tennessee and just never came back out
youre allowed to call timeouts in the first half and they dont carry over fyi tomlin
where is the discipline arent these men supposed to be paid to do this
fuck here we go bens elbow
no no no no no no no dont you dare say big ben is injured
fuck fuck fuck please god no ben
time to get the drinking bleach out
offense has to change we cant even get into field goal range
really worried about ben rn i think his elbow is bothering him not good
it would be great if our offense scored a fucking td before half time
they gonna run the ball 20 times for 5 yards each
holy fuck its like henry winkler watching old game film in the waterboy oops im just gonna drop the ball then pick it back up before anyone realizes whats going on
seems a bit like were refusing to adjust i like that were trying to contain lamar but we have to let our olb get in the game and let them blow up the mesh point and take a chance on a corner or safety maybe on a blitz tackling lamar
i sucked at flag football could never grab the damn flag
fuck nvm
never gonna give us this
fuck we needed that int
yeah that should be a quick review
it never slipped out its just a finger tip catch
hell of an effort by haden so close
thats kinda tough obviously i want it to be a pick but i would not be surprised at all if its overturned
thats control with his hand please please please
refs have been dumb so far maybe theyll fuck this up in our favor
please dont overturn it please dont overturn it
i mean if that was baltimore i would be screaming incomplete though
pretty sure this gets overturned
ughi was so hopeful for an interception
we know whats coming and we still cant stop them
lol we cant stop this rush attack its insanely depressing
they are so fucking easy to read why dont they just stop the run clearly our secondary is outperforming the front 7 today
lmao no turnover give up easy 10 if the ravens just ran lamar every play wed still give up 10 per
tomlin has the power of god on his side
4 yards 5 yards 9 yards 5 yards our defense just isnt doing anything
they run on every single play
it feels like we have had the ball for about 5 minutes of this half
i mean if we hold them here we can be fairly happy with this half we have played like dog shit havent had the ball on their half like at all and we are only down one score and we get the ball to start the second half

so all in all it has not looked good at all but as disasters go this aint the worst one yet we need to come out swinging on offense in the second half though
im so sick of the penalities granted that one wasnt against us im just tired of hearing the refs and all the interrupting
will we give up 400 run yards today
theyve run the same play 5 times can we please stop the run
alualu out mondeaux in no wonder we are getting ran on
get to half down by 7 and we are fine deep breaths wasnt a great half make the necessary adjustments at half then here we go
that is embarrassing
watt is gonna be gassed
youre fucking kidding me


snead fucking snead
tomlin better do something this team looks awful
were making dobbins look like emmitt smith out there
24 whole yards in the half good shit big guy
around the league

what the fuck was that
defense played pretty well considering they were the only ones on the field the entire half
we had a great splash play on the third play and baltimore has blown us off the fucking field ever since embarrassing second half will show what this team is made of
i will never give up hope
offense looks inept defense cant stop the run one of those games ill drink earlier for
our offense needs to get some long drives going the defense cant be on the field that long
offense hasnt been this anemic since the duck and rudolph show

ben has been off all game and the playcalling has been atrocious
verizon really needs to get it together theyve been turning on 5g today for months now
all in all ill take only being down 10 after that half only way to go is up
recognize whats going on adjust and lets come back and kick ass this second half i know the steelers can do a lot better than what theyre showing us right now
well at least were only down 10 that has to be viewed as a positive given how badly weve been dominated
i hope tomlin is ripping them a new one in the locker room
it aint over yet but 179 rushing yards in one half is pretty bad
offense gotta find a heartbeat soon
open this shit up
no cutesy screen plays stretch em
so no flag
how isnt that a flag on the ravens
refs have fucked from the start
refs helping the ravens out some more unfucking real
now i know how browns fans felt two weeks ago
does the db need to punch d johnson to get pi
interceptions from spillane and highsmith just as we all expected
if we dont turn this into a td were in trouble
fuck it gonna win the game with only the defense maybe a punt return as well bens only td coming right now
lmao jackson is such a bad passer
where was jackson looking at lmao
fuck
yes
thank fucking god still concerned with how little rest the defense is getting
lets fucking go finally
starting to feel like a different game now
fuuuck thank you for a spark defense
we are still in this but my god our defense has scored pretty much all of our points
holy shit our offense actually did something
good teams capitalize on turnovers
more rest for d i guess
they playing renegade thank you cbs for giving us powerrrrrre
lamar is scared man
we need to be ready for the run they are not going to throw
how about we make sure lamars passes
lamars really the only reason this game is close lol
wtf was that horseshit they potentially got rewarded by having an extra person on the field why dont teams just always put 12 guys on the field in situations where the other team has little to no incentive to go for 2
im glad im not the only one who thought that penalty benefits us not at all belichick is gonna have to add that one to his playbook just throw 12 guys on the field to ice a kicker
spillane is playing very well today
great play from spillane
switching to the 4 up front is looking good also fuck you romo
i think we just need to keep the defense fresh offense at least needs to get us first downs
awesome play for spillane
love to see spillane step up when given this opportunity
spillane has been unreal for us
he almost called lamar the reigning superbowl mvp
eerily similar start to the 2nd half difference this time is the ravens 3 and out wasnt saved by abs call
lmfaoooo ben doing the flacco special
fck an mvp ben only cares about super bowls
ahh pulling a flacco on baltimore

warms my heart
make the ravens secondary pay
so that was less dpi than the one they didnt call earlier jfc refs come on
good job conner been running well today
juju muthafucka
great job juju
juju great fucking effort
juju
i dont know why we dont pass to juju more often
juju is a beast
juju bringn it
juju acting like a monster
lets go who wouldve though
just run the fucking ball down the middle lol
lets go baby
james muthafuckaibg conner
steeler football
god i need me some pepto
unreal we are winning
now 3 and out on lamar
good thing i picked the wrong day to stop huffing gas lets go
defense needs to get another stop now
this is how a quarterback impresses people take notes lamar
no matter what happens the rest of the game coming back after such an abysmal half of football is great for the teams confidence and mentality
switched houses at the half think its working
ah so close spillane
wow if only the grass wasnt wet
fuuuuck so close to another turnover
that was fucking beautiful by watt
watttttttttt
big stop beware of the fake punt boys
holy shit watt
fucking aye defense lets go
i want more lfg
atta boy wattttt
121 tj watts
i wonder why tomlin didnt throw a red flag he slid out while holding the ball on his hip
i love juju so much but im starting to wish i got tjs jersey instead no shade at all tho
hell of a play by watt
much better stopping the run one long drive pls
fuck yea this momentum switch is what we needed
any word on alualus injury
it would be nice to have a punter like the ravens
plays like that is why we keep tj on the payroll no matter what that looked too good to trade or not pay to see on our side
we still have another 3 hours in this game
did romo just lose nnn on air
would had been a big run if he could keep his footing
this field is wet garbage
awful play calling and drive on such an important drive of the game deep in your zone where you dont want to punt ravens offense will have great field position
they damn feet dont work
wtf was that play call
well that was fucking ridiculous
the no huddle is working greatwe better go back to the first half offense
wtf was that glad we dont even want to try keeping the pressure on
dont feel like we played that drive with much urgency
james harrison with the big hit lets goooooo
what the fuck was that
throw it past the chains please even deep in our own territory
lets go pass rush
buggs came to play baby
buggs is popping off
im feeling a forced fumble and recovery by the steelers on 3rd down
is bugs the alualu replacement
4 sacks lets go
trash ass fucking coverage
can we play fucking football and stop with these goddamn commercials holy fuck
glad to see that flag whew
hard to believe we have the leagues best defense lol
thank god
nobody even treid to tackle him
whew that was close
fuck you baltimore
holy shit secondary are you playing this series
two busted coverages on nelson
good call would have been a sack if watt wasnt held
dope just gave up a 3rd14 now a 2nd22 i think the d has been drinking their own kool aid
fucking spy lamar inside the 20
bro what the fuck where is the coverage
our defensive coverage is non existent
what the fuck is with all these busted coverages
the defense is on the field too much offense needs to step up next drive
white paint out of bounds
oh yay refs are gonna give it to them since they challenged now
i guess tony toe tap didnt teach his cousin that move
two blown coverages is wtf type of shit they doing
right knee is ob literally left a divot on the white paint
i swear ive heard a footsame knee does not equal two feet
no way thats a catch
you have to feel bad for the dline when our safeties keep pointing at clouds smh
no way they can overturn that
okay so even though that is outwhy is someone wide open like thats literally 3 plays in a row now
they go for it on 4th yall think
two words indisputable video evidence
at least they lost the timeout
what happened to that secondary from last season
as i said our offense has to win this game for us
zone at the goal line
damn i hate the ravens
how does our def go from looking like a top def and then a few seconds later like the cowboys def
fucking can we do any fucking coverage fuck
why tf was tj watt in coverage
right now we need a clock eating drive 9 mins and a td
d shit in their hands and clapped that series
goddamn ravens games are always so close
crazy catch by ebron
like they would ever call roughing on ben
that totally was a late hit

nice catch ebron
ebron gave me a heart attack
lions fans turning in their graves at that catch

bills are about to win coz newtown fumbled in the redzone
lets go juju way to go
juju is the man
juju is a beast of a receiver
only way to stop us pi
juju can really get yards with 3 dudes on him
we need to keep slinging it downfield their secondary is handsy
mapletroooonn
mapletronnnn
lets go chase fuck yes
mapletron is big dick football
mapletron clappin cheeks
you absolutely love to see it
now defense just needs to not shit the bed again fucking please man
i want the drug they gave ben at halftime
nice pass by ben
now if the defense can make a quick stop thatd be huge
defence
good concept for the red zone but that ball needed to be a dime and it was
that was huge juju was tough as nails on that drive now time to drop the curtain renegade
defense do your damn job now
cmon defense we need yall motherfuckers right now make us proud
praying for a nice tj sack on lamar to close this game
best rivalry in 21st century nfl
defense please go win this one
please defense please get a fucking stop
do refs make halftime adjustments too they missed so many of the same calls theyre making in the second half if they could just somehow be consistent there wouldnt be so much room for arguments of bias or bad calls

loved that drive and the end result but i wish it could have been pure football regardless of if they were good or right calls
this is the most crucial drive for our defense please for the love of god lets get some stops
lottttts of time left
good guy jackson please hand us another turnover plz
i mean lamar gotta be tried by now finesse this fool
time for a minkah pickhe is overdue
our defense is fucking garbage this quarter holy shit
make lamar throw it
if defense doesnt get a stop were gonna be on the ben 2 minute drill ugh
3rd quarter defense come back bby
go back to stopping the run
wtf is this a college offense
they dont even need to pass
theyre really about to just waltz into the endzone without passing the ball
no no no no no no not heyward
heyward hopefully just stallin
can the offense and defense ever do well at the same time
this is why you cant keep the d on the field for the entire first half they are beat and gassed
theyve been in every game no one has really been up on the browns except the ravens they arent a pushover in the division anymore

the fuck we destroyed them
is our plan to let them score a td really fast so we get the ball back cause this sucks
they are straight rawdog bareback assslapping our run defense
i dont think you understand how difficult it is account for a qb that can run like jackson too many options and you cant just blitz youll get torched
its third downnnnnnnn
get a stop
biggest play of the game upcoming
one more
this games stressing me out
i meanthis is just classic
please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop please stop
steelers sell out on the run and jackson throws a pass a middle schooler could throw better for a firsttd
oh mama
these games age me
worried about this 4th down
shit bens face just said it all
bruh my heart is going to pop
i would send the fucking house here either get them off the field or let them in the end zone letting them pick and choose their shot from inside the 5 with the way theyve been running the ball likely means you are getting the ball back with about 45 seconds left and no tos instead of 155 and two tos
im shaking omg
this reminds me of the 20 seconds before a powerball draw
currently renegade
another heart attack game
thats my d
get fucked lamar
buggs man
lets fucking gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
fuck them ratbirds lets goo
my styx song worked he screamed right when we smothered jackson
one first down come on
dont you ever doubt our boys again


renegade is on
please keep the ball safe
need one first down one
first off fuck all the fans that were talking negative shit and are celebrating now two i love minkah fitzpatrick
inb4 chase ends this game on a sweep


the most obvious run ever
if derek was playing we might have made that
come on berry you fuck do something
not shocking that the offense isnt gonna get it done putting it back on the defense
hold on to your butts
stand up and get your towels
it just feels like we fail all the time in short yardage like that unless its benny snell usually oddly enough
currently renegade again
if theres such a thing as a prevent offense we just ran it
pretty decent punt
picked a good time to have his best punt of the year
give it to claypool to run not conner
grounding
berry showed up for that punt and pool got free
punt it you cowards
wtf
wtf defense
broooooo what the actaul fuck
cam heyward is quitly playing a great game
thats the worst thing that could have happened
how do you leave him that wide fucking open
theyre gonna put time back on too dammit
4 endzone shots fuck
stay classy raven fans
an injury and more time unbelievable
expletives expletives
please god just a charlie horse
classless city
lets go defense lets go
hope cam is ok
wooo fuck you rat birds and the gift td
yeeeeessssssss
70
wow wow and also wow
70 good game ravens
we did it
oh my lord my heart is pounding
70 gang
holy shit we won
how we won is beyond me
my hospital bill is gonna be crazy from all of the heart attacks this team gives me
what a win
minkah fuck yes
my heart rate is 121 bpm lets fucking go
321fuckbaltimore
great game really glad we can close game like this
ravens fans gonna be pissed about the time but fuck em
if you dont like that you dont like the top half of afcn footbal
you would think after last year that our team wouldve gotten a backup qb
i will orgasm if we go up 2817
cant have dumb fucking penalties against the ravens theyre too good
you guys blaming cam are fucking dumber than the official that called it
oh right this is why we cut berry in the first place
see how jackson tried to tip toe on the sideline and try to get extra yardage thats why you finish the play and push him out of bounds that call was so fucking bad
tj just forced the reigning nfl mvp to make a rookie mistake
wow weve been horrible since last games second half
i cant tell if this is a sub for steeler fans or a steelers hate group lol
bye judon fuck off
this offense hasnt looked right since the claypool game
i forgot just how boring the ravens are to watch they literally run the same 5 plays over and over and over and over and over

explains why most ravens fans i know dont watch the games
its funny that the defense is keeping us in the game and theyre not even playing very well
this is the type of game you miss devin bush
good lord i cant wait until this election is over
after taking the first half completely off our offense should come out fresh
ben called that whole drive beautiful
romo that wasnt even close wtf are you saying
fuck romo never really heard him so impartial during a game before
they are running the exact fucking play 3 times in one drive and we do fucking shit against it butler is just lucky that he has one of the most talented front 7 otherwise he wouldnt have a job
butler weve tried nothing and were out of ideas
bomb it to mike wallace
watch us lose to cincinnati lmao
fuck injuries i dont care who you are
i havent given up we gonna destroy these rat birds next half
ill never ever forgive how much you guys constantly shit on ben roethlisberger
must be nice to have garbage refs on your side
rub bens elbow with a boston cream pie donut and get on with it get him a coffee to go with it
if ben gets hurt again our 60 start wont mean a fucking thing i think this off season we need to search for the next qb up because i really dont think mason is our guy
i cannot wait until tucker retires
i would love us to come out in the second half and kick some fucking ass shut these half time mother fuckers the fuck up romo and nantz as well bunch of ravens dick riders
i retract anything ive ever said about respecting baltimore if those are the kinds of fans you inspire youre no better than the bengals
fucking what he was inbounds
here just to say fuck the refs should have been a punt and steelers ball fuck the refs
this game just got started calm the fuck down
offense looks flat as fuck
an nfl player has to catch that
how many fucking balls has ben had batted down this season jfc
ravens fan here judon fan as well that shit was weak as fuck deserves to be ejected i love the jawing and physicality but that was dirty and unnecessary where is the respect
ben is having an off day at the worst time
i cant watch if we have to play rudolph
ben elbow watch
we needed that bye week for bens elbow
did we even watch the chiefs tape vs these guys
damn couldnt you be at least consistently wrong and give us that one
i keep telling myself this wouldnt happen if bush was in but deep down i know thats not truem
d has no chance against a rested ravens offense if our o cant keep them off the field
man if you want to see some dramatic people this is the place to be
i called ben hot trash five minutes ago i apologize
are d sucks if it was any other defense the score would be 280
buggs is hopping around lmao
buggs built like a fucking towtruck lets goooo
romo begging to make that a catch
i seriously hate hate hate keith butler i hated todd haley but i had butler more always in fuckin zone
no call and not roughing the passerlate hit fuck off refs
alrighty fellas go lick the light socket to get the hreat back to normal see yeah next week 7 and 0 fuckers
ive finally sat down and have stopped pacing
cbs blacked out the midwest for packers

anyone got a stream link

alright back with chinese food fuck breakfast smells so good walking back into the house got a really good sativa ground up this week dogs and myself are in our jerseys and a victory preroll is ready for tomorrow morning

to the extreme
its time
lets goooooooo
i havent been this hype for a steelers game since the playoff game vs jacksonville back in january of 2018 dont get me wrong i love watching the steelers play but this matchup has a different feel than just another regular season game
im not watching yet but you know the deal

fuck the ravens

here we go
lets fucking go
spillane

night train spillane

lamar rattled


hell run less

tone setter lets go
suck it baltimore
i guess he is pretty decent in coverage
damn he got wheels
wooooo great start boys
i jokingly predicted to myself that the first play of the game would be a pick six for us

well i wasnt too far off
so happy for spillane
robert first round talent spillane
spillane dpoy
did we get lucky on watts hit
i like that start seriously couldnt have started better lol
seeing lamar be trash because hes a shit passer pleases me
spillaneeeeeeeeee
killer bs 20 bob spillane bince billiams bud dupree tj bj watt bam beyward
im so hype and its 1 min into the first
please sir may i have another
boohoo lamar got tackled
omfg
heyward wtf dude you gotta be smarter than that
bullshit call
bull fucking shit
refs dick sucking the ravens
refball no fun league
that was weak
total bullshit
holy fucking shit ref ball
bullshit its not sunday if the refs dont fuck us
cam needs to not fucking do that out of bounds i think the titans rubbed off on him lol
are refs just ass this year
oh come the fuck on
refs fucked
same ol refs
soft ass fucking refs
looks like another group of refs trying for more screentime than the players
its gonna be like that fuck it no mercy
refs expertly playing the role of patrick in the patricks wallet meme on that call
in a game of inches lets punish the defense for trying to prevent yardage via tackling
dude fucking a theyre going to score off of a soft ass call in the hardest hitting rivalry in the league
hes very mobile
that was almost the sanchez butt fumble
this drive should have been over how disappointing
why you cant keep giving away bullshit penalties
alright offense lets fucking go
having no coverage linebackers really showed on that drive
fuck man our defense shouldve got off the field but we have to get a stop on 3rd down come the fuck on
oh look our linebackers covering their receivers cant say im surprised
real convenient that larry hogan decided this was the week to let fans back in to stadiums in maryland
well 77 and our offense is just seeing the field here we go
guys give heyward some slack hits are fine on lamar want to shake this young guy up im fine with the hits teach them if they want to pass its going to hurt
that touchdown shouldve never happened heyward needs to be smarter and vince williams needs to never cover anyone
anyone have a gif of that penalty
i feel good man the ravens didnt earn that shit our d is dominate just a stupid penalty
i dunno thought vince was in good position just a helluva throw
cant win with all these dumb ass penalties
alright lets get this offense rolling now
refball
imagine naming your team after a fuckin bird lmao
finally a fucking penalty on baltimore
it looked like he got it back
i think that was repaying for the bad heyward call
must have talked about ball security all week
fucking fuck
so its gonna be one of those games cool
ahhhhh claypool wtf
well fuck come on dudes
smh ravens games are always this kind of frustrating
ravens dude didnt have possession of that on the ground
steelers penalties and turnovers

thats how you lose a game
lets go good game today we still got this if it aint hard fought i dont want it
i hate injuries
fuck that wasnt what i wanted our first offensive possession to be though ravens threw a pick on their first offensive drive too
yall players streaming video games and uploading tiktok videos has nothing to do with their performance on the field give em a break its not like theyre doing it on the practice field or during film study as long as its not illegal against teamleague rules or can cause them or others injury their free time is their own
haden clearly held down field
that play right there is where we miss bush
i hate people freaking out over people freaking out in first quarter

us shooting ourselfs in the foot is not new news instead of capitalize on teams mistake we give them opportunity and always make the game 5x harder to win
love seeing our entire secondary getting held down the field
lets go
dupreeeeeeeeee
pay that man
lets go boyyyysss defense stepping up
suck a dick weak hand lamar
this game is fucking wild already 3 turnovers in the first 10 minutes
thats it boys im buying a bud dupree jersey
very clear fumble
bud saved us
bud please god may we resign him
deep ball to juju for 95
fuck yeah boys
a gift now do something with it
bud fuckin dupree
lol theyve played like 10 min and 2 huge guys are out
oh my god yes a fumble and recovery
lets flip tthe script now boys lfggg
saved by the bud
fucking finally lol good awareness on edmunds fighting by his man on that recovery
romo in shambles after lamar has terrible pocket presence
no punts allowed
thank fuck

today is not going to be good for my blood pressure is it
these game threads are so damn toxic not even a quarter and this thread acts like its time to clean house and rebuild steelers have a tendency to start slow we all know that a few bad plays doesnt make a team bad yeah it can kill you but the steelers are pretty good when it comes to winning its never safe to count them out especially in the first damn quarter
what is that playcall
huh
what the fuck was that
3 and 10 run it up the middle brilliant
imagine how good wed be with a good offensive coordinator
what the fuck
whats going on with our offense cant move the ball
garbage punt
why are you guys surprised with the playcalling lol
terrible punt jesus
oh wow terrible punt
lol that punt wtf
guess were gonna rely on our defense to do everything this game
our defense has been on the field a lothope they dont get tired
this playcalling is killing us
why we running on a 3rd and 10
how have we just not had a punter in decades
what kind of pussy ass playcalling is that
fichtner needs to be looking for another job this offseason the amount of talent hes squandering with his bullshit play calls is embarrassing
i knew berry would fuck us god dammit
god berry is such a cunt
i think he shoulda went to outside on that
why cant we find a fucking punter
why can you get a real fucking punter jesus christ
what absolutely terrible playcalling so far
steelers and awful punters name a better duo
3rd down

draw play
my kingdom for a punter
is there literally no other options at punter
berry is definitely back
this offense looks like they arent even trying
offense needs to amp the fuck up defense cant be on the field the entire damn game
are you actually fucking kidding me a 3rd and 10 run has like no chance of success
why can we not figure out a punter colquitt wasnt a god or anything but berry scares the fuck out of every time its either a 30 yard short or long line drive giving them a decent return thats if he doesnt fuck up the snap
thats the berry we know and love
another 30 yarder from jordan what other choice do you have berry
the defense needs to stop the run on first down
what a blatant holding again on dupree you only miss that on purpose
thats not a holding on dupree though
mannnnn these injuries on both sides blow
and he fights going down no more fucking roughing on this guy

if your going to fight you get what you get
jordan berry at it again i cant believe we brought this guy back he blew so many big punts last year
raven injury looks bad hope hes okay
heart goes out to the big man
and tuitt was being held on that sack eff these refs man
ronnie stanley down on the ground
fuck injuries man
these linemen dropping like flies dang
fuck fuck you dont want to see that terrible
ouch that looked painful
3 turnovers and 3 injuries in the 1st quarter
too many injuries
112 million dollars
damn i feel really bad for stanley i hope hes ok
thoughts go out to stanley no matter how much i hate the ravens i never want to wish injury upon anyone
fuck that didnt look good hope stanley is okay this field is fucking people up today
my girls sister planned out gender reveal party for today i really fucking hate to miss this game but hopefully well find out if i have a future steelers player today lol
ouch getting rolled into is never a good situation silver lining is at least he got paid hope for a speedy recovery thats a tough loss
this is why we need a punter our field position always sucks
defense is on fucking point wow
this just going to be a defensive dogfight
alright someone brew some espresso for this offense
incredible defensive performance on that drive to keep them out of field goal range now its time for the offense to collect themselves and put together a good long drive have patience folks
now if our offense can get the wheel turning
the defense has been perfect this quarter apart from one brainfart just to bad it turned monumentom
this offense needs to getitingear pull your heads out of your asses and at least grind out some first downs the ravens have a kick ass defense but you guys are pros too
hope our offense wakes up now
lamar about to run for his life
d is playing well enough to win we need a scoring drive here
where was the late hit flag on mccloud for that
that snap was digusting
how about that late hit or do holdings and late hits only count if you can call them on the steelers
that snap was sus
that snap
our offense looks terrible today
we just need a long drive give our defense some rest
our offense has got to wake up
gotta put some maple syrup on those gloves
offense looks rough so far
lmaoo this offense is depressing so far
baltimore really had 111 yards in the 1st quarter wow
who gets the ball after the half
over thrown come on big ben you gotta get it together defense cant do it all
nice punt berry
offense needs to figure something out here
im feeling some defensive splash right here no 100 million dollar man upfront boys will eat
man cannot win on defense alone
get a stop and start with the ball not inside our own 20
3 drops already on the game sheesh ravens getting lucky this game with ref ball and the rain
defense is gonna start really getting at jackson with their line down two people and depth is gonna be a problem for them today
defense is ok right now but how long u til it gets tired from the offenses ineptitude
i really wish we had devin bush for this game we need his speed for a game like this
well i made it 3 minutes into the second quarter without drinking
without alualu they are winning at the point of attack
see it doesnt even matter

berry
i feel like by the time this game is over im going to need to take a shower
2 o line subs and theyre gashing us on the run
alualu being out is hurting big right now
maybe if our offense can be on the field for longer than 20 seconds our defense wouldnt be so tired
offense needs to help the defense out for once and give them a long rest
wtf happened to our supposedly best in the league run d
good lord how are these gaps so huge
offense has to do something defense is tired
defense getting gassed now
defense is tired offense needs to step up
ohhhhh were in trouble
bud isnt fast enough to contain lamar like that
offense has to be better d is balling out as per but offense cant sustain a drive to kill clock could be our only downfall this season
if we could fix the play calling we may actually be winning

3rd and 10 you run 2nd and 3rd two straight pass plays team is being coached by monkeys with headsets on it seems
one day fichtner will not be the oc and ill be alot happier
defense cant stop every drive their getting worn down
they threw one pass on that drive
cant wait to watch our offense do absolutely nothing now
a long scoring drive would be hype rn
defense been on the field all day cant really blame them offense needs to look better
ok lets see if the offense can respond before we give up on this game
what can your expect when our offense has only been on the field for 5 fucking minutes
41 yards on offense is something
alright offense the defense is doing plenty right now but they have to be getting gassed please do something
offense cant stay on the field to give the d a break

this game is over if we go 3 and out on this next drive

the announcers are actually praising lamar for being hithuh
welp at least they earned that one hopefully that wakes the offense up
if ben doesnt make something happen this drive were fucked cant expect the defense to play 45 minutes
defense is getting tired offense really needs to sting together a drive now
theres still a lot of game to go it wouldnt be steelers football if your heart wasnt in your mouth the whole time i have faith
if we cant get long drives on offense their offense is gonna wear our defense down need to put together a long drive right now
one long td drive here and everything is essentially tied up its insane how one sided this feels for being so close
where is our offense
looks like we have rudolph or duck out there right now lol this offense is stagnant
can our offense do something please they have 10 more minutes of possession than us our defense isnt gonna be able to do shit if they have to be on the field the whole game
im buying spillane jersey this guy plays his heart out almost smoked the goal line gap again
its a one score game and so many comments are just toxic af is it because the fair weather fans have returned now that we are undefeated and havent watched a ravens steelers game in a while
whats up with the run d not watching
the offense needs a long drive to let the defense rest as flat as the steelers have looked on both sides of the ball 1414 at halftime is a winand very fortunate
i have an idea how about throw it to someone not covered by peters
ben has to stop going for the long balls
ben looks rough
pay james idgaf hes the only one doing shit
romo ravens scored a td

this sub wow romo sucking the ravens dick
watt is gonna murder someone when he gets back out there
stop running it on second and long holy shit
conner youre too good for us
its just gonna be off setting penalties
give us that call it was back and forth until judson came in
they can go anyway with this


and you think this is a good thing romo
theyre gunna fuck this up
holy crap
get em out of here good
he punched him
ill take it
marcus peters is a prick throw him out too
good job dumb ass judon
peters is a fucking bitch
based refs based refs
obviously not trying to hit the ref but he still hit him
bye bitch
what a dirtbag lol have fun watching the game
swinging at an official is easily the worst thing you can do in this game
hell yeah get judon out of here
bye felicia
number 99 for baltimore can gtfo
juju ju
this game has very little throwing the ball
enough with the running
that wasnt intentional ill take it but i dont feel good about it lol
imagine not flexing the cowboys eagles snf game for this
we suck today on offense
sweet lord what is happening with this offense
ben and batted passes wtf
stupid penalties
ben is looking awful today
ben youre too old to break out of that
we need a wr1
feel like were playing new england
good punt again berry wow 23 today
god fucking damn it
offense needs to figure out their fucking issues this is pathetic
finally get plays in ravens territory and do jack shit with it
offense is really not looking good today hopefully we can get it together after the half
well at least he didnt throw into triple coverage and get picked again
can we go no huddle
at least were punting well
holy shit this offense looks awful plus its making the defense play worse since they cant get a dam drive going
good punt at least
we cannot allow a score here
ben johnson juju need to wake the fuck up
ficthner too
offense literally hasnt done anything besides hurting the team well at least the defense had a little time to rest after the scuffle
so are we gonna turn it on and have a completely different 2nd half for our offense we get the ball first still waiting for us to have more than one or two games a season where we are on point the entire game
run the damn ball conner is making moves
missi matthews says bens elbow is being looked at helmet is off
any chance we get out of the half only trailing by 7
wow this is frustrating
need to get off the field on 3rd defense probably gassed because this offense looks as bad as last years still completely unimpressed with the ravens steelers would be in control if they could get a first down every now and then
where would we be without this defense man
damn so close
incomplete fuck
nothing like a moment of false hope
they will reverse it unlucky
not a catch
dammit
good attempt joe almost had it
man they should give it to us its secured against the side of his hand
i dont see steelers keeping this
no pick good try though
hot damn that was almost a crazy play my heart says theres an extremely small chance here but i know my head and logic say nice try get em next play
ah damn good effort anyway get off the field now

respect haden saying his hand was under it when it really clearly wasnt haha
they ruled it a pick initially hopefully thats enough to not overturn it doubt it tho
they aint gonna give us this no way
ok need a stop and we got a chance at points
offense needs a lot of adjustments in halftime
this is fucking pathetic
10 yard run on 3rd and 6
whats a stop right
have many times can they do the run up the middle or lamar scramble consecutively
let me guess lamar run
lamar is making mistakes dont fucking back off now
hold them to a field goal and get things fucking right in halftime
theyve been running it all game lamar hasnt had any luck throwing so they run it put more pressure on that run game
poor edmunds on that play not sure what youre supposed to do when a pulling lt gets a full head of steam on you
id love ot have a mobile qb like murray or lamar take a risk on their throwing ability but hardly any teams can stop a mobile qb just rarely works
we are getting ran on
lamar cant throw stack the box spy him and make him win with his arm please
wattb is ignoring the runner and going after jackson every time
this is just frustrating to watch they are killing us up the middle
we cant stop this fucking run
there we go


make this dude throw
keep the game to 7 points and wake the goddamn offense up
and another first lmaooooo
thats a forth
getting dominated what an awful game
too easy
sure leave it in the hands of that kicking machine tucker
if we get out of this half down 7 we would be lucky this game is not over yet
alright all we have to do to block the kick and run it in

edit fuck
at least we get the ball first next half
we fucking suck today
sooo this is what i was worried about in previous the game wasnt solely on bens shoulders today is a game we need that and so far is been disappointing
i dont know what needs to fucking happen at halftime but something better happen our offense has been garbage
offense looks like trash and we cant stop the run great
please big ben be okay
its damn near impossible for our offense to play worse so it can only get better from here
ben ringo ringo ringo guys they are fucking blitzing to the fucking right

ravens yes
time of possession 2009951

d is gassed
jesus christ ben 24 yards something is wrong
ready for the turd quarter offense

im just hoping for a recordbreaking comeback in the 4th at this point
injured ben dangerous ben
elbow looks okay
juju baby
tied for fewest pass tds in a half is kind of a dumb stat
im really confused about some of these decisions big ben is making samuels obviously isnt catching that
clear dpi
no flag
wow where the call you call bs all day then let that slide wtf
how did samuels play rb and te in college if hes not going to fight for a ball like that
ref is looking right at them
oh yea and these refs fucking suck
refs icing the game if theyre gonna let them do that past 5 yds were cooked
that possession was less than a minute pathetic
refs thinking about sunday dinner
ben is throwing as if we still had ab these dudes not even close
well our defense is screwed
tough to win without offense should have been dpi but 1st and 2nd down playcalling is off
honest question what the hell are we gonna do if ben cant play we know our backups are awful
at least the nfl is doing the right thing to promote voting i love it
highsmith
fucking huge int make them pay
now fucking score
if we settle for a fg i cry
who needs offense with a defense like that



for reals we need both
anyone else still see lamar woodley every time highsmith is on the field
ravens are so fucking ass lmao
highsmith kinda smurfing today
we needed that so bad thank you highsmith
holy shit thank fuck they gave us that
defense gonna have to win like last year
personal foul steelers not letting the ravens win this game going away the result of the play is negative eleventy million points and a trillion dollar fine all steelers players are retroactively ejected from every game ever played
oh hell yeah
ebrooooooonnnn
fuck yes exactly what we needed
ebron bitch
the defence is straight dragging us along like we are fucking going
danny smith has so much gum in his mouth he cant even keep the mask on
big ben with that big dick energy
its gonna be a long night for me working a 12
were back in it this is a hard watch turnovers injuries everywhere
our best offense is the defense
so when weve forced them to beat us through the air lamar has given up 14 points take a hint butler
odd the ravens are still throwing when theyve been running all over us they want to keep giving us the ball then fine
spilly with the stop
we needed that 3 and out for reals
spillane playing lights out really like this kid
spillane at thanksgiving 3 years ago

what are you going to now that college is over

im going to try to play in the nfl

ok rob
ebron is carrying us on offense
lets go ben find your groove
regardless of the outcome we can rejoice in our defense making lemar look like shit
so are you guys gonna stop hating on ebron now
finally we get that call
about time they called it
good job claypool getting open
looks like the offense is back from their 4 quarter break
gotta love flaccoing the ratbirds
fair weather fans are real quiet right now
this is great clean playing
samuels would have dropped that
juju fighting for that you love to see it
score a td
what a catch juju
conner i need you to move forward
lamar cant play without a lead
drive it in
lets gooo
juju does so many things right
yall still want ben benched
were still in this shit
lets fucking go
i already failed nnn
lets go this what we wanted from the offense because we know they can move the ball
back in the lead bitches
offense finally got it lets keep it going
all hail the king of the yinzers
werewinning

second half boys
love me some halftime adjustments
offense looks way better in the second
win or lose i love how these teams always match up so well with each other rarely do you see a blowout in these games
lol the unnecessary spin move
fucking night train spillane is my hero
fuckkk me
lamar just juked the shit out of a ghost
goddamn it get the ball ugh
ahh so close
so many close turnovers today
fuck grab that ball
someone explain to me why its not pittsburgh ball spillane had it going out of bounds
its thirrrrrdddddd downnnnnnnnn
cam heyward sighting
how is that not a turnover wtf
great fucking stop
good stop
big stop lets go
finally we stop on 3rd down
tj is my dad
buggs starting to get into his role also fuck mondeaux
wattttt
great play by watt
ravens getting too cute with lamar
that counts as a sack right
i would love a long drive for a td please
tj watt is unbelievable
sack 4
now were seeing the steelers defense we know
wheels too fast for his own good there
dont juke yourself dude
damn he juked so hard he threw himself to the ground the rookie will learn
he had all the space too damn
wow i always forget how tall villanueva is
our defense will have to win this
what is that playcall
cant go 3 and out fuck
of course our offense doesnt do shit
fucking joke of a play call there
actually a good punt as well
3rd and 9 and pass the the los is our thing
that was one of the better punts from berry
dont mess this up
atta boy buggs
the line jumping to block passes is really messing with jacksons timing
lamarmake him see ghosts
our defense is good
thats what we love a qb sack
3 quarters down 1 to go finish strong fellas
i can think of one streak that continues
finally they realize that good things happen when you cover jackson
buggs is coming up big after being inactive in place of a refrigerator last week
awesome way to finish the 3rd
fourth sack of the game baby
infamous steelers 3rd and long defense
how do you just ignore that wide open
how are they allowing that shit
edmunds getting burned like clockwork
are u fucking kidding me
edmonds come on bro gotcaught flat footed
what the fuck the bengals are beating the titans 247
edmunds you got rekt
edmunds had been playing well and was starting to earn himself some credit with steelers fans and that all just went down the drain
hell yeah take it back
hypothetically what do you guys think about trading for gilmore
praise be to the yellow flag
flag yes holding
why are they wide open
wtf is the defense doing
2nd and 22 and they get 24 smh
they hold tj worse than that on every play and no call so whyd they call that lol
im absolutely mind blown that they actually called the fucking hold for once
what the fuck is going on with the blown assignments
this defense has suddenly turned into the seattle secondary
gives over 20 yards on a run
steelers and ill do it again
bruh why is everybody open
this pass coverage is embarrassing whats happening
jesus fucking christ can we stop long distance first downs
come on defense we got lucky there
the knee hit the stripe no td
we need to stop busting coverages in the endzone
they cant overturn this one
they cant overturn that
ya thats out knee in the white indent pretty clearly not enough to overturn to a td
didnt we have a play like this last week it was to be two separate body parts it cant be a foot and knee on the same leg by rule that should be out
too inconclusive to overturn it
thank god lamar cant throw an easy floater
harbough can suck my left nut
not that it mattered
damnnn we got this still tho
our fucking secondary
every play that drive our secondary fucked us how was every so open on every play
why are they playing so far off the receivers if they lose theyre gonna look at this drive they had so many opportunities to get off the field
pathetic
come the fuck on
this game is way too even
this is why its pointless arguing about a td call on second down theyre just gonna score again anyhow
i dont get how pit lets brown of all people wide open in the gap
i just dont know if its blown coverage bad scheming on our part good routes for baltimore or what but our secondary is getting blown apart the last few plays
the zone on this drive has been pathetic wide open on the three biggest plays of the drive

no man coverage thrown in at all when lamar is struggling mightily
that touchdown only happened because of 2 huge mistakes by the secondary so dumb
dont blame this on the defense theyve played relatively poorly but our offense cant stay in the field
why does our secondary suck horn
we need a good 5 to 6 minute drive to grind their asses down into the dirt this is just getting started tomlin needs to have a fucking talk with the secondary or he needs to mix it up
that 39 yard completion on 3rd long was a back breaker
who was minkah guarding
pass interference no doubt
the stadium sounds like they are definitely breeching covid capacity protocols
roughing the passer call for ben no way
lmao of course we dont get that call
thats a late hit
need a long drive and a td here no fgs
ebron has been a good addition so far
what a fucking pick up ebron was he is coming in clutch
even the defender expected ebron to drop that
bruh peters has been all over our receivers all day
woahhhhhh that looked like it hurt
great hands ebron
refs trying to get control again w these flags ravens starting to get a bit chippy on defensewe gotta stay smart and not retaliate
my stream has fallen so far behind i dont wanna look at the live comments lol
the refs found their glasses
jujuuuuuuuu
juju activates man mode
about time they fucking helped claypool out theyve been all over him the whole game
bills beat new england dynasty over
you love to see it
juju
thats fucking steeler football juju
once again ravens dbs are a bunch of pigs
love you juju
juju you fucking baller
claypool reminds me of young larry fitz

even down to the big cheesy smile
i love all the flacco specials ben is utilizing
yes
claypool
mapletron
remember when it was flaco would just throw it and hope for a pi haha the tables have turned
the penalty is as good as a catch
claypool baby this offense has come alive
what a route
leggo
do your fucking job d
mapletron
claypool
tf has this offense been all game
you can only stop him for so long
i will have a heart attack if this game goes into ot
juju moves the chains and mapletron for the td love it
so steelers game plan for the season has either been play a great first half or a a great second but never both
whew im worried about bal working the clock and coming all the way down the field on us we need a big stop this drive
lets put this game away d
juju reminding ben of hines claypool looking more like the legend mapletron every game
just need one more big play on d
seriously where was this ben first half and we targeted juju once for 30 min wtf why
come on steelers hold them hold them hold them
fuck the refs and fuck the birds oh my god
defense please get a 3 and out
please defense please stop them
defense wearing out
that damn pitch play got us twice
time for some devils lettuce
td built by juju and closed by claypool we need jujus brute force to get the ball forward against these guys
come on defense what the fuck
what the fuck is defense doing shit man wtf
same play same result
are we really going to let them run down the whole field in 3 minutes
steelers need a stop or turnover stat
come on defense you got this step up big and get a turnover
this defense is unrecognizable holy fucking shit
why are we playing prevent defense with 6 minutes to go
just stop the run
our players gonna have tire treads on their jerseys from getting ran over all day
need to force a turnover or its over
that 3rd quarter defense has gone missing damn
and int would be nice right about now
never anyone covering the pitch
another 20 yard play
s t r e s s
just let them score fast please
the same fucking play over and over again and we cant make the fucking stop
whole defense seems gassed
oh my god the fucking pitch for a third time this drive
theyre getting exposed hard and it sucks
haha gaping hole romo got one for the ravens
run d is non existent today
how are we getting run on
man we need someone to stand up
were gonna be like the 15 run defense after this game
nooooo dont be hurt cam please
so predictable that they would eat the clock and march down the field
steelers pretty much passed every play on their drive ravens running it gotta watch for that pass though its coming
tick tick tick
a pick or fumble and recovery would be nice rn
one more stop boys lets go
theyre going for it
baltimore is really draining the clock so the defense needs to step up
ravens gonna try to bleed clock here
one stop one more fucking stop is all we need
holy shit biggest play of the season so far coming up
aight big moment for d coming up
one more stop lets go d
come on defense lets stop them here
buggs has been playing well today
one more stop lets go d
they had a guy open there thank god lamar didnt look for him
fuck these cunts love 4th and short situations
a turnover on downs would be pretty cute ngl
oh man one of those situations where if they get the first down you have to let them score

cant let them run down the clock
this game is making me sick
you cant tell me there wasnt anyone better to sign then 99

he must be the owners nephew or something
crossed fingers and toes for this one
play of the game coming up
this next down will be fucking huge oh come on defense help us end this game right here
quick someone sacrifice a pierogie and iron city
4th and 3 2 mins

dont jump
always has to be an ass clincher huh
i dont care who beats them but dont let jackson beat you with his legs make someone else make a play
we know the rpo is coming
this team is not good for my heart
this is play of the fucking game
we dont usually do well in these situations but fuck history lets get this
im not saying the season rests on this stop but i would like to see them get the big stop here
i cant breathe
i feel like im gonna have a heart attack
bengals beat the titans holy shit
lets go
were gods among men
holy fuckin shit

lets gooooooooooooooooo
suck it lamar and the rest of you ratbird bitches
yeeeeesssssssssssss
just need a first down and this is the ball game

run theeeee ball just fucking go old school and boom a punt with berry on 4th
oh mama
first down basically wins the game come on connor bust one up the middle
you better run it 3 times and punt if necessary
keep the foot on the gas please
our team lifts weights
heres the heart attack right on cue
uhhh they cant win with a field goal tony thats why they went for it on 4th
lets fuckin gooooo
spillane has been incredible this game
hold on to the ball at all costs
i played renegade
buggsy
im out of market and the lions game ended just in time for me to see that stop hell yeah
whos got one more yard in them
please get the first down
2 yards away from this game
diontae johnson finally got me fantasy points
a fg doesnt win here tony
these spots have not been generous
that may have lost us the game
fuck they have one last chance
im fine with that play call defense needs to step up here
and now im not so optimistic fitchner wtf
oh my god the heart attack continues
if we win this game thanksgiving is gonna be our seasonif we beat them again primetime thanksgiving night 1 seed on the linestatement winwowlets go i dont like itbut lets go
if this punt isnt 45 cut berry before hes off the field
oh god jordan berry please do something good here
well sub 1 minute offense and they cant keep running it inbounds
do we have nothing remotely creative up our sleeve for a situation like that
alright one more stress test
nice punt pls now
no block here pls
big berry
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
this game is a heart attack
romo shut the fuck up
just boot the shit out of it berry please dont fuck this up
fuck im so nervous
52 seconds on the 37 not very good for them
wouldve loved to see at least a claypool fake jet sweep on that one
i wanna see them bring out mondeaux as lead blocker for a short yardage situation again i think he really could work more often than not
intentional grounded it to avoid the sack
good punt
phenomenal punt
them off a bye us off a tough game we have played quite good to be honest
can someone explain why that wasnt intentional grounding
anxiety intensifies
we need a minkah pickpatrick on this drive
was hoping for intentional grounding
grounding wtf
just get them down i want to see that clock run off
fourthh downnnn lets gooooo
romo trying to defend that terrible pass
wouldnt be steelers football if it didnt almost cause me a heart attack
thats fucking grounding cunt
fuck me
nononononononono
freaking snead
oh no
fuck
f u c k
heart rate is elevated
if we lose this game i dont know what ill do
imagine allowing a huge play like that in that situation lmao
are you shitting me
i got a bad feeling bout this
shut this shit down
tjsack him
thats bull they shouldnt be adding that much time to the clock

edit good they didnt add anything
dumb as shit that they charge a timeout and add to the clock bullshit
i really dont like the soft coverage in the middle and fuck man cam killing himself for this win
not good losing cammotherfucker
cue the steelers game induced heart attack once again
ok last play
fuck them booing flying skunkrats
321win
70 you dumb cunts
hey hey hey goodbyeee
waving to the baltimore fans
wow what a gamethat one took a toll on me
all we do is win
we got away with one hard
i was about to fucking die right there
undefeated baby letgoooo
did we deserve that probably not will i take it happily absolutely
why were raven fans booing during the injury
bittersweet with cam injured really hope hell be back in a couple weeks
its overr
what situation
another week anothe heart attack hopefully cams okay
here we goooo
why must these always be like this
told people to relax have faith in this team
idgaf minkah has regressed this year no matter what anyone says
steelers 7 refs 7
vince on a small agile receiver smart
yall need to chill its the first fucking quarter lol shit happens

that play was telegraphed how did we not read that jackson was going to run that to his right
yo i just heard from scientists that if lamar jackson scores a td on this drive he likes pp
lets see how the sub is doing

oh its the typical steeler overreacting thread got it
wtf he was still in bounds
ravens celebrating after they are gifted a td
lamar got the superstar treatment 100 there teddy bridgewater wouldnt get that call
really bad penalty call there if jackson is still in bounds you can definitely push him out and if two guys are falling out of bounds and one steps over the other that cant be a penalty either refs blew that call hope we dont lose by seven or less
what a trash start since the int
it got stripped good defensive play scratch it off claypool
f injuries
fuck i hate injuries bless all the knees
i dont want to see any negative injury comments please guys
i was going to post something wholesome on the ravens sub they are calling tj a dirty player fuck them
jeesh bunch of people in ravens sub want tj to break his leg
man this sub is so weird if youre watching streams feels like everyone is on a different play
this is embarrassing
somehow this will be on us
fuck the ravens am i right
holy fuck our offense sucks only reason we have points is from the pick 6
this offense is hard to watch rn
everybody calm tf down lets get a stop defense
i cant do this thread anymore for the rest of the game heres to a bounce back and a win in the second half
we live and die with bens arm
notice baltimore got it going once alalu went out

yeah theres where my 1st round draft pick is going next season
i fucking hate justin tucker so much
fuck justin tucker is good
run all they want but they only scored 10 the other 7 were off a completely wrong call on a failed 3rd down
ravens 180 yards rushing and had the ball 23 of the first half
complete failure on our part but we are only down by ten
if we can come out and score and our defense can get a 3 and out we are back in it
good vibes will help
grab that towel and wave it high
sorry but a team that had trouble with the steelers rush prior to their starting tackle going out doesnt just magically get better theyre holding like fucking crazy not just jersey grabs but completely wrapping steelers up
never give up hope
thank you buggs for ensuring we will likely never see mondeaux getting first team reps this season
romo willing on the ravens
imagine if that rb didnt trip and ran for 50 yards
oh god now romos talking about jacksons legs hes gonna cooooom
so when the ball leaves bens hands and then he gets hit its not a foul but when lamar is in bounds and cam hits him out it is

these refs are garbage bruh
claypool just keeps drawing the penalties not the great catches but ill take it
i will be so glad to not have to see political ads next weekend
juju has such a hines ward vibe to his game and i love it

a true steeler with his physicality and high energy
how do you crush barkley and henry and then let baltimore run all over you
these classless twats are booing cam
why are you giving up a 30 yard play on 4th down fucking just give them a 68 yard completion if they want
romo and nanz in shambles
two weeks of my poor fingernails
win is a win wasnt pretty hope hayward is ok
we took the virus head on

stares at 100000 new cases per day
61 wouldnt be the end of the world its in baltimore expected to go 11 with them us winning in pit
so many bitches in this comment section the steelers rarely get blown out relax and enjoy the game
where are all the its over people now yin are awefulmy quiet
once again minkah out of position in fucking no mans land
awful call
thanks refs
its tied refs 7 steelers 7
looks like we have to beat the fucking refs today too
claypool our herofucked up welcome to the nfl rook
looked like claypool recovered that
why arent they replaying it
dude conner has some shit vision like just keep following your blockers into open space but hes like nah lemme just cut it inside into a pile of defenders
fuck you berry tomlin and danny smith never get held accountable for this yearly pathetic punting game
am i the only one worried about how state farm is making all these nfl quarterbacks out like they are totally fine bribing their way into getting perks no one else does
lol this is steelers vs ravens yall expect to score 30
say whatever you want this is an entirely different game if thar single horseshit personal foul isnt called every aspect of the game changed
kick judon out of the fucking game my god
i hate marcus peters
so glad ben doesnt fucking care about this game s
man what is up with ben today this is so unlike him
our offensive gameplan and execution is complete dogshit so far
we are absolutely fucked if the offense doesnt come out looking entirely different in the second half lucky to not be down 3 tds right now
oh great now ben is banged up thats just fucking fantastic
banged up ben incoming now the game begins
we need to make a trade for ryan fitzpatrick if ben is injured in this game we have zero competent qbs as backup ben gets hurt seasons over
as long as we can keep them from scoring we get the ball back after the half
lmao you know its coming and cant stop it
snead is such a little bitch
i hope we can adjust at halftime ive never seen this pittsburgh team all year and i never want to see them again wide open fields all day i miss bush and tyson
just a soft effort look slow and unprepared against an opponent they should stylistically bully inexcusable
drinking a seltzer thats how fucking pissed i am rn
roethlisberger is a fucking embarrassment today
so we lose a point for their penalty
im worried that something is up with ben i hope something didnt break in that elbow
im sorry idc what anyone says lamar jackson is not a sustainable strategy at qb long term
i cant look at lamars hair and not get angry i just want to cut it off
we will not give up on america or the steelers


we will keep rebuilding our offense and defense
llama jackson is garbage
also fuck yeah for the browns getting their ass kicked
titans look sus
mcfarland what the fuck bro i dont care how fast you are if you slip it makes it pointless
wednesday cant come soon enough these ads melting my brain
foot knee of same leg doesnt equal two feet down iirc
honestly week in and week out we put up numbers that make you think the coordinators are doing well but how much of it is just talent keith butler looked abysmal before we had 10 first round picks starting on the defense the play calling anytime we have a lead is horrendous there is essentially no lead that is safe between him and randys play calling randy has been great for our redzone production but holy shit does it sometimes seem like its only working when ben is going 5 wide with no huddle
stop calling him mapletron he already has more rushing and rec tds than calvin johnson did his rookie year he is on pace for more yards right now too
kick the field goal you cowards
booing an injury grow up
keep them out of the end zone
those people who are booing are douchebags
all you negative losers gtfo
there were a bunch of times i thought we had lost that game but we did not 70
pittsburgh shitbirds
roughing call was such bullshit
i see the comments about the ravens thread calling for tjs legs for that injury i live in ravens country and let me tell you they are vicious
by the way our other quality win is getting clowned by the bengals
til romo is a ravens fan
romo is looking for any reason for the steelers to lose fuck him
were gonna whoop their asses
nervous is an understatement here we go
ive alternated my mean joe jersey with my big al one so im hoping it keeps the juice flowing and no i havent washed them gotta keep the luck and good energy in them
alright motherfuckers were here


who ride
we got romo again yay
may the football gods bless the knees and ankles also can i not have a heart attack this week thanks
i believe
idk how many more political ads i can handle
wtf its 3rd and 6 game over pack it up

ezzzz
hell yeah
robert spillane the truth
spillane
lets fucking gooooo

devin bush lldbush11 1s

spillane you bad man
tj just keeps getting to lamar
dumb play
lmao what
god damn tuitt is gonna kill someone today hes hyped
what a fucking joke
tuitt brick wall
terrible call
stupid
lol what a garbage call
he was still in bounds bullshit
fucking blind ass refs
eh soft league
refs cant let us win by too much
weak ass call bruh how
terrible
what a load of shit

at least refs got time to make up for that bullshit
ref just happens to have the initials lj
every penalty should be allowed to be challenged
dammit man
no holding on watt are you fucking kidding me
hes hearing footsteps already
bobby spills still goat in coverage thats a fuckin wideout on a crosser cant win em all
no holding call
refs came really early to play they are about to score 7
hit the qb 15 yard penalty
man that was just a bad matchup on coverage
ok we need to march right down and score
good officiating on that td
i see christmas came early for baltimore
refball wins again

lets hope the refs bail us out and i cant wait for the ravens to lose their minds
love how were handling the rpo with someone just going straight to lamar with no hesitation
i swear the refs have flags at a ready when someone runs back a kick so annoying
i know its low hanging fruit or whatever but it cant just be me that thinks lamar jackson looks weird like he reminds me of a pug
okay can we please not have williams and spilane in man to man spilane made a great play on there first drive but come on now there two biggest plays were because of that
call that block in the back but not 2 obvious holds ok
these fucking refs bruh
come on with the penalties my fucking god
third game in a row where a defensive penalty resulted in the opponent scoring a td smh
oh fuck off ebron
penalties are costing us so many opportunities we have to get better at this
dude almost fell from a ball to the knee
peters tugging on his jersey then complaining
makeup call thank fuck
what a shit pass
refs taketh refs giveth lol
so many annoying and unnecessary penalties hate nfl refs
seems like that might have been a bit of a makeup call lol
looks like the zebras are trying to decide the game today
i think claypool got that back
hold onto the damn ball you moron
hey everyone i just tuned in what happened with the penalty on third down was it damn the d messed up or was it refs say were not allowed to avalanche the fn ravens and be 70 heres some fuckshit
holy shit claypool hang onto the ball
goddamit claypool
goddamnit man what the fuck
yikes come on boys
im going to have a heart attack today
fuck
ugh
so its gonna be one of those games
here comes the heart attack
alright boys take a deep breath clear your minds and fuck their shit up
1 turnover each team
score is tired
ravens with possession in our territory
welp this is going great the heyward penalty really killed all the momentum from the pick 6
shit happens hes been great otherwise not worried about claypool bouncing back
jesus what a time to tune in literally just in time to see the ball get stripped and a turnover

fucking hell this dont bolster my confidence

still got faith though lotsa football left to play
is this the first game we have played in the rain this year if so we just gotta settle down
fuck was hoping for no injuries
minkah wtf run forward or dont run at all
im really kinda hating all of this right now
thats the exact type of play bush will be missed on
defense needs to come up big
alualu hurt
lets goooo
huuuuuge
diontae johnson made of glass
dang lamar made that mistake
secondary getting bullied
fumble
lets goooooo
yess bitches
alualu fuck
i was never worried easy fumble
take your fuckin medicine
bud
ofy
bud
thank the steelers defense always bailing offense out
does that count as a sack
my stress level already through the roof still 5 minutes left in the first quarter
get the ballll
ok bud
exactly what we needed holy fuck this game is gonna suck
please
wooooo hell yeah bud
buddd
thank you bud dupree
this game boys weve got a full day ahead
i warned my boy not to start lamar today lets go steelers we got this
regardless of how you feel about spillane you cant say that guy isnt out there giving 110 every play
its only the first quarter i simply do not have enough alcohol to deal with this rollercoaster of a game
this defense makes my dick hard
will have to be a long long drive from here
3 turnovers halfway into the 1st quarter
time for some classic fichtner 3 outs
that bad playcall worked thank god
wait wtf they have fans there i thought the ravens announced no fans all season
connor looked fastttt right there
just punt the ball now lmao
diontae johnson is really going to become a what if story isnt he
pathetic
run the ball on 3rd and long smh
stupid stupid call come on
fuck that fichtner what a garbage call
theres a classic shit punt
thats my punter
why the fuck would you run it there
how many delay of games are we trying to get
did ben change it to the run
did they seriously just fucking pussy out on 3rd and fucking 10
please draft a fucking punter they are very important players
well the offense looks absolutely trash

not much different from last year so far
thats the type of punt that got berry cut
mm love me some giving up offense
oh great berrys back
not having a punter can easily costs us a game due to terrible field position
the offense will get it together defense just needs to hold up on this possession
what was that playcall and what was that run
im so happy we have berry back to put the ball sideways
even romo making fun of our play calling
we need a punter this is embarrassing
we brought this motherfucker back to punt couldnt find anyone better
i guess the defense will need to score because our offense is useless so far
shit offense
remind me how much were paying berry
jordan berry with the 6 yard punt
what a shit series

1 pass to claypool overthrow miscomminication or bad route or something
2 busted play check down for 1 yard
3 run up the middle for 3 yards
4 34 yard punt
the outside runs have been killing us
team has to settle down
this dude is being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to kick the ball out of bounds
so berrys punt was even worse lol
this is by far the worst 1st quarter ive seen and were tied goes to show you ravens suck
bud dupree held so bad there
dupree was mugged on that last play
god damn bless the knees
guess ill go out in the backyard and start practice punting ill even do it for 150 grand a year
hold on dupree but ok
hate seeing a player hurt tho no matter what
they were literally holding duprees jersey
lmao did he really try to throw the ball as if he wasnt already flattened on the ground sorry lamar but thats a sack
damn dude ronnie is down hard on that one
this game has been tough to watch so far
ouch no no that looks awful and hes a great dude
keep getting hits on lamar
afc north
ohhhh that doesnt look good
jeez that hurts to see
damn injuries are never good regardless hope hes ok
yikes broken ankle
bud keeps getting held
oh shit that didnt look good on the replay
damn thats a season ender
there goes an acl i hope im wrong cuz hes a hell of a player and i dont want to see anyone go through that
alualu out
not making a joke about an injury but fuck if something like that even has him just a step behind the rest of his career that is either terrible timing by the ravens or the absolute best time for stanley contract wise
ahh shit i hope he aint hurt bad looked like he was in a lot of pain tho

damn best wishes ronnie

damn dude this is the really ugly side of football guy does absolutely nothing wrong and just an accident leads to a terrible injury hope hell be alright and its nothing serious
i legit just screamed when i saw the replay damn that sucks total accident hoping for a quick recovery for him its a battle for the north
well i hope stanley is good to play again some other day
defense is playing well but hopefully the offense can have a long drive here to give them some rest
damn id like to see those picked
our d line is going to go crazy now
i thought that was gonna be a minkah pick 6 how long that was in the air
plays

pit 8 bal 22

top

pit 402 bal 1058
this d is doing an amazing job of taking away lamars first read and then he panics
defense shouldve made lj pay for the silly throw instead of taking the sack
flipping field position is just as important as scoring on this possession the offense needs some space
ebron and third down fucking iconic
you dont get that penalty rook
samuels needs to retire
our offense is looking horrible
that was toooo high ben get in your grove man
i swear moncrief passed his no hands genes to everyone on the steelers
ok that one was on ben
why can they run on a 3rd and 10 but not on a 3rd and 3
samuels should never be on the field
wow 2nd and 3 two chances and not even one conversion
shoulda had that
why are the playing 38
wish they could catch the ball
j samuels has to make that catch
the fact that were even tied right now is a miracle
2 really bad drops so far
good punt
offense is utter shit today defense is gonna have to score all the points at this rate
i dont think their defense is beating us it just seems that were out of sync dropped balls off target passes not following blockers cmon lets tighten up
honestly ben first pass was gold that samuels dripped but honestly has been very avatage today
in a series that is usually decided by a td or less it sucks the offense isnt humming yet but we are still in this game
our offense has not been good this entire season against capable defenses ravens are a capable defense
not sure if playcalling sucks or everyone is just playing like ass seems like a bit of a and b

hopefully we just saw samuels last snap this game tho
we need to start moving the ball to give our defense a rest
have some faith in 7 to figure it out this ravens d is really good its gonna be a dog fight
i know mesh takes some time and the were blitzing but we were in a condensed formation against press man on 3rd and short also i dont think there was a robber because of the pressure the brought theres not a better situation to run mesh i dont understand the decision to throw and speedout to a receiver thats getting jammed hard of the line if ben had been on target that mightve even been dangerous
so much for field position
flip the field and immediately let them run it for 25 yards junk
okay we literally know theyre going to run we cant keep letting them get what they want on the ground
wow this is just horrible man our defense lets them get good field position our offense doesnt do shit ravens get good field position continue the pattern
these games are usually always close defensive battles i dont know why yall are down talking our offense so much this was to be expected this week its going to be tough to get momentum on either side
so much for flipping the field
defense is understandably gassed offense needs to figure it the fuck out
running on us


wait


thats illegal
need to get alualu back in
idk what the fuck our game plan it but it needs to change now
hard to even blame the defense they have to be exhausted
dline is getting worked by an oline missing two starters
wonder what its like to get multiple first downs on a drive

were going to lose this game unless our offense fucking does something and the defense forces 3 and outs
how can my mood change so drastically in 55 minutes
please adjust something
we need to do much better if were gonna win
i know its cliche but if not for the turnovers the defense is getting worked hard by the ravens
we should just fucking rail lamar when he does that shit take the 15 yards but scare him off of doing that shit
we have to stuff these plays
if only our offense could move the ball like this
the defense cant play the whole damn game perfect we need to put more points on the board
yikes
they are beating us off the line
i understand the one thing we dont want is lamar in space but i do t love the gameplan of our olb just taking lamar all the time either i believe we have to have them spill at least sometimes and rely on safety to fill or have and ilb on blitz around on a dog to fool the qb
we getting rekt rn come on defense
hit him again
not a good series for the defense but spillane is looking like troy being all over the field
we are missing aluala
alright here comes our answer on offense


buckle the f in
let ben run the offense we need to move the ball
defense has to be exhausted offense actually needs to put together a long drive to give them some time to recover
the ravens have proven they can gash us we havent proven the same need the passing offense to come out swinging
damn the ravens are moving the ball with authority the steelers offense needs to get their confidence back
that was a hell of a drive unfortunately
3 and out on offense coming right up or will this be the turnaround doesnt feel like its coming today the whole team looks lost rn
what do you expect from a defense that has had to be on the field the entire damn game
need to get more than one first down on a drive
offense fucking do something the d is tired
dude the sad thing is they basically just ran it 80 yards on us for the score were not even trying to make lamar pass to beat us
everyone stay calm the defense is just gassed the offense needs to adjust and sustain drives
2nd half team dont worry guys lol being down 7 is jot bad at all
matthew mcconaughey says a whole lotta nothing in those stupid lincoln commercials
i have a good feeling about this next drive
offense can turn it on now lets get this done
need to put together a drive here
getting ready for three more run plays
another 3 and out coming up what the fuck are we doing on offense
our offense is not together today
good job connor
ben rudolph cant tell the difference rn
these snaps are concerning
i love conner tho hes running hella good this year
worried about a bad snap
thats the third bad snap by pouncey today the fuck
ben wtf is happening
deontae was defending himself
whoa
give one to washington because you have to and five to baltimore
literally punching a ref lmaooooo
fuck off judon
how has peters not been been ejected for two fucking headbutts absolute joke
there was pushing and shoving on both sides they should have just let it go unless the penalty is specifically for shoving the ref
can number 99 beat up fichtner too
hahahha thanks for that
how bad was the intentional contact with an official stuck listening to the radio
dirty birds
there are so many fouls on the play we cant sort it out all players ejected both teams forfeit
holy shit judon got tossed
at least its a rest for the d
alright now we need to actually start completing passes cause were not gonna keep getting bailed out by the ravens being stupid
anyone seen juju
mans just punched a zebra wtf
removed
be smart and please capitalize off this
fuck the ravens
judon on his own sideline acting like hes getting taken away by the other team and bam
offense please take advantage of the penalty
whos the dirty team now get the fuck outta here rat birds
batted ballbig ben special
yeah he wasnt intentionally going for the ref but im not going to cry for him
if we win this game i cant wait for all the ravens fans saying it was because they had three starters out
decastro soiled himself
ben pls bby wyd
this game is getting chippy
this fucking offense
what the fuck happened why were there like 3 personal fouls and an ejection
im not having fun right now
this is bad
yeah our offense is utter dogshit ill be back after half
fucking might as well be last years offence
our offense looks like the fucking jv team
we gotta work on those snaps today jesus
trade up for justin fields maybe if you get a gm drunk
come on defense you are our offense now get another 7
roethlisberger needs to just turn it loose last fourish quarters he seems to be holding onto it longer than he did the first 45 games it wasnt sexy but it worked get back to it
elbow
great ben is hurt
playing like cold dogshit today
hopefully this is just the inverse of last week where we were amazing in the first half and ass in the second half maybe well come out and be beasts in 2nd half

honestly i dont understand why the nfl just doesnt play man straight across the board yeah wrs are good but its still press jam that shits still hard to fight qbs also have to be absolutely perfect on the play
jesus man
oh my god thank you haden
tj was scary
ah well ummm that might get overturned
jesus christ were really putting rudolph in
man we needed that pick fuck
joe haden
nope
faaaack so close
of haden makes that catch put him in at receiver
haden
my biggest takeaway is jackson is very beatable in the throwing game but were getting killed in the run
we wont get it
in this weeks episode of what the fuck is a catch
the ball didnt move even after it hit the grass
i havent been able to watch the game whats up with people saying ben is hurt what happened
do it refs i dare you
you know thats the play call how can we not stop it
you know exactly what is coming there and you dont stop it
go man to man and load the box for the rest of the game
were playing like ass even though they lost 3 starters what the hell is with our team today
ravens are running through them like shit through a goose
ravens more physical today
ravens have 167 running so far thats terrible
not going to win games when you can only score with your defense these guys need to pick it up
defense needs to make adjustments to stop that run not sure how they would do that maybe add a qb spy but the pass defense has been fine that run defense needs to start stuffing them dont get me started on the offense
well 2nd half is where its at hopefully they can muster something and stop the ravens run game b
i really miss tyson man
jesus christ
well this will be good
mother tucker
im destroying myself with scotch for this team im doing my partgif
hell lets put dotson in there at nose it couldnt hurt at this point
we need to come out hot if we run 3 straight times fire randy during the game
well we only played one half last week so maybe were flip flopping it this week and well show up in the second half
the titans are down 717 on the bengals at half as well
offense needs to come alive in the second half cause they did fuck all in the first half and we are relying entirely on our defense who cant do another half of that

come on half time adjustments weve been in this boat before and come back
ravens down 2 o lineman and are still running the ball at will this is scheme well see if we can make the right adjustments at the half
man up outside stop the zone and crash the middle stack the box its not fuckin rocket science fire butler
please please adjust i feel like our gameplan is scared of lamar granted somewhat rightfully so but please let our playmakers on defense attack lets spillforcefill a bit against the read option
but all that wont matter if our offense doesnt step up unfortunately theyve done absolutely nothing so far it felt like the d was on the field the entire half have to be more creative in the pass game and audible according to what they show
pretty painful to hear 17 unanswered points might just turn down the audio for the second half at least this way wont have to hear romo drool over the rat birds
i never thought wed go undefeated almost wouldnt want to either but the way were losing is the real concern
i think we went through our entire 2deep at nt in one half
juju
first down are those legal
i pray to god we win this game
and just like that were gonna punt
1st play good play call we changed it up
2nd play here we go again
why even play samuels
pathetic bruh
jesus fucking christ
work back to the football samuels
throw down the field holy fuck
ben is 1 for last 8 now
love how samuels is in for some reason
why is samuels in
im also tired of these rainbow sideline throws
im shocked we didnt shank the pint at the rate this is going
okay i try to stay positive but with the fucking offense playing like this there is a 0 chance to come back
flag
to me david sepulveda was the last decent steelers punter

edit not david daniel
id prefer to bomb it on 1st down not 3rd
yeah no ref bias here
hope defense is ready for another 20 minutes on the field
quit bitching and try to make a play
so back on the defense then dear lord
berry scary
well we held it for 50 seconds baby steps
not gonna get the pi call when ben throws balls like that
this is so frustrating
when did we start playing joe flacco football lol
this offensive game plan is horrible not sure why these personal packages with j samuels is getting so many plays its not working coach
fuck yes
lets get some points now fuck sake
if we could just score we would be dominating
our defence is making more yards than our o
perfect field position baby
woodley with the int
oh god just kick a fg now
lamar doesnt understand that hes only good at running
lets gooo you fuckers
thank the maker for our d
steel curtain keeping us in it lets go o
do something now offense
good guy lamar jackson is trying so hard to give us this game and our offense is like nah bruh
please score
forwards conner
lamar gonna lose the game for them if he throws
ravens never gonna throw again
james conner detractors should have to watch this game every time they say he is shite bc he is our bellcow
what a gift get points boys
let bud walk we got highsmith haha
i feel much better for some reason
will lamar will us to a victory best player on our offense today
the rook and spillane here to save the day
alright boys we got a game again
we scored thank god
alright lets go back in it
bens arm s
i have no idea why they let him throw especially when we cant do anything to stop the play action
guys well be ok
why is lamar always laughing
this is the same game as last year

d made plays offense didnt get off the bus
man they just let ebron walk that in
finafuckinglly
shit my stream cut out how did we get to the 20 last i saw we were punting

edit thanks fam hwg
yes
rated e for ebron
they will run every play stack the box
do not go for fucking two
bruh this years draft class are such studs
now its a game thank you
steelers d 14 points

steelers o at least they didnt fuck it up
they are going to run butler
cant stop boz with 12
go for 2 win the game 1817 because fuck the 2nd half its gonna be a completely miserable slogfest steelers football
lmao what
its a new game boys
thank you they havent really changed up a lot coveragewise post snap so far so lets just read the coverage an call a play they show cover 2 we attacked the seam mike had to carry it that left the the crosser wide open
why do our games always take so long
ben didnt even raise his right arm for the touchdown
just gotta say wtf is mcconaughey still doing lincoln commercials for
its pretty stupid to me that the kicking team essentially gets penalized for the defenses penalty shouldnt have to rekick that
that touchdown is why yshallow cross is the best play in madden and is unstoppable if you know how to run shallow concept
come onnnnnnnn i gotta leave for work at 330 i wanna watch the game lets fucking gooooo
defense needs to force a damn 3 and out already
another ravens ol hobbling
the refs are ruining what could be a great game
its thirrrrrddddddd dowwwnnnnnn
tuitt has been tremendous today
spillane is playing well again
great defense 3rd and out
spillane is holding his ground though
a well rested defense looks nice good job spillane
i bet dbush is so fucking pumped for spills and how well hes been playing keep it up 41
cmon ben lets put something together here
omg a 3 and out yesssss
forwards conner jesus
now thats a good start to the half
we got this
spotted the handshake with rayray these games can get dirty but i enjoy seeing the mutual respect you just dont see that with the other two
jesus they hang on our receivers every long pass
thank you ya fucking zebras
glad romo not a ref
i love refball
large benjamin warming it up
spillane being undrafted in 2018 and being waived multiple times in 2018 and 2019 just doesnt make any sense now
wish we could get the running game going ill take whatever though
this is much better so far
using the joe flacco special in baltimore love it lol
their db are all over our wrs
that first td was obviously big on the scoreboard but also huge for the offense psychologically
ben just take the short pass trying to get greedy the moment you get some fucking success
get rid of the fucking ball ben
i think ben was trying to throw to ebron right before the pocket collapsed
so they can just flatten our receiver like that with no penalty
i like how ball secured juju is playing
screenshot request the splitscreen with happy ben running the offense on the left and glum lamar fuming on the bench on the right
just a reminder that people were saying to bench ben
if they want to keep giving these short passes keep taking them dont get greedy thats when bad shit happens
great effort by juju
holy shit juju way to muscle through
thats the effort we need
line up
what an effort by juju
we need to keep juju
ugh hate time outs in close games under stable call though 5 wide at the end zone is sketchy
lets go boys
qb sneak
that was awesome juju
i thought you could snap it during substitutions and draw 12 men in the field
connnorrrrrr lets goooooooo
fuck these rat birds
hey they let jc finally get his td
lets goooo lead
thats why you dont give up hope
cmon ben
conner strong
boom suckah
yes lets go

were back baby
yep its a ravenssteelers game
please let us hold on to this lead
keep this up guys
keep it up defense needs to keep forcing turnovers for us to be successful
there it is now all is right in the world
i love what im seeing
well boys i know it was a tough first half in here but our boys really came out hot in the second half lets hope they can close it out now
is it just me or is conner miss few holes


also again just defend the running and make him pass
lets go baby

time for complimentary football
wow who woulda thought at halftime
lets go
god fucking dammit tj
fuckkkkk we needed that
fuck we were so close to getting that
damnit another near turnover we didnt get
lets get this stop
fuck i thought we had that
bengals
damn that was so close man
spillane gotta pick that one up on your feet love that guy anyway
how is that not a recovery had it pinned against his body and left arm touched out before he lost it
lets go d
no sir
this pleases me greatly
bde tj
amazing steelers d
tj is a treasure
thank you tj read that rpo perfectly
killawatt
damn that was a good play by tj
watt scoop that play out quick
comon offense keep it goinggg
ok offense lets keep it going
take a shot every time ray liota with chantix is on and you wont get drunk
ok lets close it out o
tj gets off the line so damn quick and just completely dismantles plays before they even have time to confuse the defense

love to fucking see it
he had so much room
the field is greased
thats 6 if not for the turf monster
is hollywood brown playing in this game i feel like i havent seen him at all yet
no bueno so far damn
gotta drive gotta drive
oh shoot we coulda got a first down there
lord have mercy
so much grass in front of him
boy how you gonna just fall over lol
we knew that blitz was coming


fuck
lets hope our d can hold them
ben
f me in the a
not a terrible punt
is todd haley back
what was ben looking at there
turnover coming up i can feel it
time for d wins championships thing
lol jesus fucking christ
an actually good punt
one moment it is hope for the offense the next sadness existence why
lets go
bugg juice babyyyy
its thirdddddd downnnnnnn
buggs really impressing me in the pass rush reminds me of hargrave been better against the run so far in the second half too
buggs
fuck
unpopular opinion but that was some pretty bad defense
wow that issuper annoying
you gotta be kidding me
how do you let him do that
zone fucking coverage
edmunds wtf
how do you allow that to go open
what an epic fuck up that was a game changer play
what the fuck
uh o stinky
go predict your winning score predicts in the jersey giveaway thread
that holding call saved our fucking tits
flag saved us lmao
thank god
finally got a holding call
finally they have been holding all day
spillane has been money today
romo preparing the noose after that td got called back
what the fuck defense is this fitzpatrcik what the fuck bro
even the worst qb can hit wide open receivers
lol we get saved just to give up some bs
wide fucking open come on defense you can stop this shit turnover
holy shit d make a fucking stop
minkah has to step up in our secondary man has been invisible today
behind many an amazing play is a hold just like that glad the refs saw that one
raven receivers are always wide open
why even stop them
streaming this game on steelers radio with the lag time versus the nfl game page is stressful
lamar legit refuses to throw the ball outside of the hashmarks how do i realize that and we dont fucking realize
secondary babies what is you doin
were getting lucky af
i think he got that
ehhhh not enough to overturn
lamar airballs

zone defense isnt by it
maybe instead of sending the whole fucking team at lamar butler should balance out his defense a bit
f romo
romo smoking crack cocaine
i thought you needed an ass cheek in to count for two feet not a knee
no way thats a td
td probably coming regardless
idk if theres enough to overturn there but the way this drive went its a td
come on minkah
well at least the ratbirds had to burn a to on that challenge
what the fuck are these clowns doing if they arent covering anyone
wide open yet again 1 receiver standing wide open
d was given so many chances and they couldnt take advantage
why cant we cover anything
theres almost 12 minutes left we have this
i hate zone coverage
alright ben time to fucking turn it up here
romo is turning into madden always making bs comments to instigate controversy madden would always interject shit like i dont know about that one a tickytack holding call there barely holding ignoring that there are no degrees of holding and if its holding a little or holding a lot its a 10 yard penalty
that was hideous
need a long drive now td with minimal time left go o
that coverage has more holes in it than a meth junkys grin
lets go offense
alright lets go big benjamin back to work
if this offense wasnt absolute ass in the first half were crushing this game right now the offense has been decent now so hopefully itll pick back up
my problem with minkah is hes literally standing in no mans land guarding no one at least put your hands on somebody
fucking titans dude
im so fucking nervous
ofcourse there fucking isnt
how is that not late
last 4 bal offensive plays

lamar td run called back

next play allow snead to get all yardage back

next play upheld incomplete td pass

next play td to hollywood brown

sweet

good effort ebron
weird time to go for a hurdle but ok
keep this drive going
finallly a flag
dirty birds
mccloud got wheels
mccloud 9

8 ravens penalties and 3 turnovers and were losing hate to say it but the ratbirds are a good team not many can have that many woes and still be in a game

pouncey picked up juju like are any of these smaller bothering you
keith you better not play prevent fucking defense with this close of a game
claypool to ravens fans
having a sinus migraine this entire game has been so fucking painful and got another 45 minutes left
stuff them here
cmon defense
ravens are going to complain about the refs if they lose even though all of them were good calls minus maybe one of the pi calls however the refs missed a pi call so it evens out
dont start this again plz
we cant let them waste time and score
thats gonna be a long as drivefield goal max d
defnese cant stop a runny nose
fuck those runs working too well
we need that rookie to spill the ball
how are they able to run so well
dobbins must be build like a brick shithouse
fucking hell

the faster we let them score the more time we have its a must
we may get last possession in this game
what the fuck

fucking garbage
cool just let them run all the way down the field
pathetic defense

265 yards rushing exposed

lamar ran that ball too many damn times
gotta think were gonna throw here right
ran for 265 cool thats 1 yard and 4 turnovers short
run the ball run out that clock lets see how the ravens handle it even when they know whats coming
we win if we get 3 yards
we have to get a first down
spillane having a great game
spillane is my dad
need to run here just to bleed clock
holy shit we got away with one on that mcdonald jumping before the snap
ravens will have a full minute
shit
fuck fuck fuck fuck
fuuuuck at least they have no more time outs
fucking hell the balls on these cunts or the stupidity to call a throwing play lol
fuck me gimme a great punt berry
they have plenty of time my heart cant tke this
can we ever close without dramaso 2020
why run it up the middle
why not put the ball in bens hands there those short yard passes on third and short are his bread and butter
im so happy that we play the terrible dallas defense next week that will be easier on my heart
berry needs to earn his spot here with this punt
so how many options can you run in 50s
man would have loved to see the claypool sweep there
shart my anus is clenched again
jesus 50 seconds left after a jordan berry punt my heart
why is it always like this at the end
whys it always gotta come down to the last plays
if we had a better punter i would feel a lot better about this
pick 6 to end this game please
blast renegade
54 seconds too much time
good punt berry
this is still too much time i feel like
berrys best punt in a long time
my fucking heart
i always know i expect an asshole clenching game but man am i never prepared
big punt aussie

come on defense
how the hell is that not grounding
berrys best punt today perfect timing lol
nail biting intensifies
at least a decent punt
ok berry good punt

my godgoing to er
70
that was so fucking close to a penalty
ahhhhhh
lets gooo
the march continues
minkah almost with a pick there
one of our guys waved at the fans lmao
lets fucking goooooooo
what a game
harbaugh was looking for helmet hit wasnt one
whew
sweet holy baby jesus
god damn snead got crushed too
woohoo still undefeated
thank you minkah
jesus fuck how disconnected are trumpublicans from reality
steelers 7 refs 7
is diontae capable of even thinking about being healthy for a week he makes james conner look like the most durable player in the league

this is all our offenses fault idiots can barely pick up a first down
oh my god some of you need to shut up being so dramatic we are 60 and tied with a very good team on their home field its not the end of the world let them make adjustments
shoutout to the worst offensive performance ive ever seen

fuck the play calling fuck the execution

conner is the only one who deserves to be on the field for the offense right now
big ben will get it going in the 2nd half



i didnt like bulter and tj screaming at each other
lets have some faith people were undefeated for a reason
some of the worst takes ive ever seen in this thread at halftime
man getting old is weird no clue who tf j balvin is and no pressing desire to find out now get off my lawn
what the fuck has minkah been doing this game
intentional grounding is a 10 second run off this should be over
fuck the ravens
bullshit flag
i want that smile wiped off lamars face
butler has to make that adjustment lbs on wrs will not work bc lamar will see that shit
refball scores again
so that pick 6 was completely nullifiedmay as well have had a three and out only difference is our d had to be on the field longer
unnecessary hit from cam but that roughing call is so weak on an elusive qb who is fighting with a db to stay inbounds
this game thread is fucking morbid for the first quarter
holy fuck dude how can you even have a job if you call that on 3rd and 10 most fucking coward play ever
ravens changes format a little bit

romo god these ravens are just so good like holy fuck oh my god ravens youre soooooo good night
oof no more injuries please
for how big of a tire failure that quarter was were somehow tied
no flag for us getting shoved at the sideline there unlike crybaby lamar rayray was out of bounds
2nd and 3 no run plays 3rd and 10 and you run it and yet we wonder why we havent made a super bowl in a decade
chill out everyone this is a typical steelersravens game
tj needs to stop head hunting and go after the ball
very atypical steeler game which is not what you want from a 60 year but also what you expect from a ravens game for better and worse
turd quarter has evolved into turd half
other than the turnovers this is like us vs ten last week but were the titans this time

time to get it together
holy shit tj and fichtner are arguing beat him up tj
peters is a bitch
x200b

x200b

judon is gone for touching the refereetime to hit taco bell and the showers
hate that they keep saying it wasnt intentional didnt know they live inside judons head
why cant ben throw it over the dline anymore he gets deflected a ton now
lmao this sub though
come on d strip sack pla
they keep getting lucky on those near turnovers
that whole side of the field was open
why was there no one covering jackson on that play
one week our offense is great the next we need to get rid of ben you guys really are turds
i fucking hate the ravens so much
i wad pissed this game wasnt on my local channels after keeping with with the firdt half online im now happy i cant watch it

id be frustrated as hell if i could watch it
playcalling has been absolute trash on the offensive side of the ball doesnt seem to be a real rhyme or reason to any of the calls
i really hope this offense grows some testicles during this break there is too much talent for these shortyardage nobenefit plays
i said if we dont score to start the half were losing

we are losing especially when we didnt make any adjustments at the half
thank god lamar cant throw
they may win the game but lamar jackson is ass and will never win anything
who trying to play among us
this is the worst nfl game i have ever watched going to be about a 6 hour game
god dammit conner that was a first
good on conner but i think he couldve picked up the first there
some of these peoples streams are 2 minutes behind
i got faithi got faith
edmunds of course
its like the defense is trying to undo everything theyve already done
fitzpatrick not looking too good today
lol at the idiots saying d has been garbage today
why would the right knee being down in bounds matter left foot knee was out
raven fans are fucking retarded calling it ref ball but denying their second drive was kept alive because of the refs lmao
if they get yards for 1st down you let them score
dont expect it but this would be an incredible stop
fuck our defense
come on we just needed not to give a big play
lets fucking goooo
undefeated you motha fuckas
lets goooo minkah makes the game winning play
if you aint undefeated i dont know how you feel
bad penalty already on the game two hand shove when lamar is inbounds grow up baltimore crybabies
im surprised romo is able to speak so clearly with the ravens dick in his mouth
his knee is clearly out romo wants it to be a td sooo bad

this is the first game all season where we are playing a good defense and it is really shining light on how are offense is still lacking
refs fucking handed that shit to them
1 why is jaylen samuels getting snaps

2 jordan berry manages to flip the field so thats a win on the drive as far as im concerned
i miss charlie batch
so i guess the defense just wants to watch lamar run
lol we not good on offense anymore
4 straight quarters of trash offense no excuses for that
through the first six games steelers hadnt given up more than 104 yards rushing in a game

baltimore has 179 at the half
what the actual fuck 3rd and 9 and a fucking bubble screen on our own fucking ten
buggs cant stop the run but he can make to the qb
damn it now cam is hurt and we wouldnt be here if they had just put the game away with a first down
minkah went off today
ben did what he needed to do and avoided any turnovers on his part our defense was tired and sluggish in the first half but made every stop we needed to in the 2nd half played right into our strengths and made 8 throw to win he cannot do it

70 lets go boys
so the out of bounds line for qbs is like a yard away from the actual out of bounds line
fuck off tony
ffs romo get baltimores cock out of your mouth
bitch pigeons got nothing on us
he wasnt going anywhere what a dumb hit by heyward
that bullshit unesseccary roughness bullshit gonna bite us in the ass later in the season isnt it
you can feel the tension through the screen in this game rudolph is wisely not wearing a helmet
got extra downs because of a push out of bounds not a hit a push
i see a lot of people defending cam hes smart enough to know that theyll call that every single time lamar was wrapped up by two defenders already headed out of bounds hes gotta be smarter
ill give anyone 100 to drive here and murder me right now
cant believe they didnt show the replay clay pool had the ball back
last i heard we were supposed to have a good run defense
deonte johnson hurt again
such pathetic offense i dont care if their defense is good or not
how hard is it to find a punter these days
shitty play call followed by a shitty punt get berry the fuck off the team he was cut for a reason
jeez you hate to see these injuries
losing stanley is huge
fuck hope hes okay
damn that sucks
ravens fans are literally rooting for tj to get injured in their game thread right now
note to real steelers fans stop looking at the ravens game thread they are trash wanting watt to be hurt for their own lineman causing the stanley injury
anyone else notice how the commentators are heavily biased in favor of the ravens theyre really getting into how and what the ravens need to get done on d and offense the steelers get the ball so the ravens
missing tyson bad
alualu out really be hurting
were banged up and tired the titans fucked us hard
still a bunch of football but lamar is getting abused
defense is exhausted you cant expect them to be out there 247
offense hasnt done shit since the first half of titans game with all the receiving talent its a disgrace
eject his dirty ass
peters looks like a bitch here
hahahaha see ya punk
offense is terrible
why is ben shit rn
ben whats going on man youre better than this
this offense is inept
this offense is just not good theyll go as far as the defense carries them
god i hope we adjust for once at half
ben is having a tough time today
oh cool another dumbass nfl player takes a manageable 3rd down and ruins it with a dumb penalty
i cant even discern an offensive game plan its just bad
there goes being number 1 in the power ranking even though every realistic steelers fan knew we werent really number 1
oh no ben please no
alright if this what were gonna get from ben and that elbow isnt gonna hold up then we need to look at qbs in the draft
ben playing old
alright so what was wrong with ben before the play that made then massage his elbow
post jesse james thats a catch
fuck dude i dont want to overreact but if bens done do we go get a qb this is a super bowl team and rudolph isnt the answer
lamar is very predictable why hasnt our d caught onto this yet
30 minutes of football without our offense being even close to score points not even close
fuck you tucker
what a terrible first half were lucky this game isnt a blowout
they can get a field goal from their 8 with almost no time on the clock we cant get a field goal starting at our 30 and a 15 yard penalty
why can we stop the run everywhere else but not with these guys we gotta get fired up and on the same page and come out of this half with poise and intensity lets fucking gooooooo
disappointing half but we are only down 10 offense needs to get it into gear to have any chance
need to change up the front they leave watt and dupree unblocked and just have 5 oline on 3 linemen let watt crash down and put minkah on lamar or something
could somebody religious pray to the patron saint of second half adjustments for me
we all know how good jimmy marlon and marcus are but you have to take the shots
we have so many weapons at wide receiver give our guys the chance
im concerned about bens lack of deep ball and tipped passesand all the receiver drops so many drops this year
steelers must score first in the 3rd quarter then we will have a punchers chance
this is a continuation of our offenses inability to score going back to the 2nd half of last week i think that bens right arm is hurt and its showing
hopefully if we lose they can at least take their frustrating out on former punching bag andy dalton next week
my money is bens arm is injured he is not zipping anything right now
wtf he held him the whole play
can you no longer challenge pi
fuck the refs
great a 45 second drive just what our gassed d needed
if our offensive game plan is to hope for pi then just pack it the fuck up
offense flat out sucks today

punting team sucks as well

not giving up but 6 0 means nothing when your division rival makes you look like a high school squad
cant take that sack
tomlin should have challenged that call
goddamn tj
terrible play calls someone slap the oc
fuck we need than that from offense our d is gassed
buggs bunny
who wouldve guessed we not only have 1 nt better than hargrave but 2 alualu and buggs have looked great this season
thats what we think of your streak ratbirds
omg they finally called holding
stop playing zone you stupid fucking coordinator fuck todd haley
wait youre telling me we cant win games if we play conservative once taking the lead
what the fucking fuckin where the fuck is the coverage
right knee was out stfu romo
fucking great job d pathetic all drive
ohhh little cousin with the ab celebrations cute
were gonna have to beat the ravens and the refs thats just how it is
bullshit sure protect the braid wearing guy he must be a girl right
come on defense get the ball back asap
alright lets renegade the shit out of this ravens possession
our defense is really ass since the 2nd half against tennessee
could the real steelers run defense please show up please show up
protect the ball these guys are notorious for punch outs and we know they play dirty
were the only team that wouldnt be able to get that first down
fucking idiot fans cam being hurt helps the ratbirds
goodbye baltimore
nice play of minkah
lets gooo 70
minkahhhhh
man i just hope cam is okay
seven and oh baybeeeee
fuck all the haters i stand by this team period
fuck the ravens yes
removed
anyone who thought spillane could replace bush with no noticeable dropoff is really stupid
that stupid unnecessary roughness penalty changed the entire complexion of the game
romo has been real annoying this game
stop putting unathletic ilbs in man on wide receivers
penalties

steelers 3

ravens 1
this team has serious fumbling issues
that looks roughjust a day after his extension too
spillane may be a blue collar gym rat lunch pail working class steeler football cerebral scrappy high football iq kind of guy but right about now i really miss bush

can we just stop ugly ass lamar one time
steelers have been garbage the last 4 quarters
man ben looks like absolute shit today wtf
really hoping lamar jackson swallows dick in the postseason again
james connorleveon bum
sorry guys that first half was on me i never should have tried to watch the game
could romo stop sucking off the ravens
obligatory fuck trump
first game im really excited for and that is usually a sign for some bad fuckuppery on the steelers side
looks like the ravens will be hurting on defensive line depth today so i wouldnt be surprised to see a strong focus on the run game once they are worn out also a great way to get claypool involved to some explosive gains and try to eliminate the effectiveness of their secondary

ward has been pretty good for them as well at olb and hes inactive today too likely to bring in yannick so should be interesting to see how their defense measures up today
blessed 2 weeks in a row with west coast coverage just easier not to have to fool around with a stream
death to the ratbirds
ingram is out for the ravens today we may see a steady dose of dobbins who i know a lot of reddit steeler fans were clamoring for during the draft we took chase claypool instead
curious to see what effect the weather will have
wtf is up with the cbs feed
im very nervous about this game ravens coming off a bye just seems so unfair
saw a rat bird above my chamber door dont worry i put it on the fryer and had a late night snack
ravens remind me of paul johnsons georgia tech teams when they were really good 0914 they run the ball well and cant throw but theyre stupid efficient
lfg
lets go boys
here we go boys i stand by this team

the kings of the north
here we go
little boy jackson vs big ben
lets do this shit
lets fucking beat their brains out please
holy shit that is a wet field that kickoff barely bounced at all

damn it they got off the field

and now they get to go again
bull call man

i fucking hate tony romo

fuck
i feel like this is going to have to be a tit for tat game we have to play every quarter for sure
fucking stupid
fuck
damnit hayward
really wish the nfl app allowed picture in picture viewing
well win with or without penalties
bince on a wr is a tough matchup
damn they were off the field
lets go boys ravens had to do all that for a tie game bens time
spillane is looking like a vince williams replacement hes just not a devin bush replacement bush is the second most important player on defense after watt
jfc
ugh ball hit him in the knee
no personal foul for us connor got shoved near the sideline crybaby ravens
fucking ebron
refs think were here to watch them today
what an awful throw its gonna be a long day if you cant give the defense some rest ben
ebron come on
topstreams is buffering so much fml
so now they start getting penalties and putting themselves in the hole
live by the dragon


die by the dragon

our first offensive drives have been slow excluding last week this was to be expected
gotta turn this around defense cmon
we got lucky on the call on the interception also on the flag on pass interferences and still we fuck it up not even mad at it anymore this is us

lamar pick comming up
at least he knows how real this shit is now
we always shoot ourselves in the foot
hope hes okay
why no replay on the fumble
just checked it its a stupid stream not worth it use the nflbites
welp
guess someone pulled a hammy
no holding on edmunds
holding wtf
spillane is so slow damn refs ignoring the holding
look i know the refs have come up with some bullshit but since the first drive we have just not looked up for this game some shit needs to turn around quick
bush would have been there
lets goooo
forgot my steelers jacket at home today fuck hopefully nothing goes wrong
you can tell their balls are wet
turnover battle gonna win this game
nice
karma is a bitch
3 total turnovers half way through the first quarter damn
oh baby
lets gooooooooooooooooo
ok all is right again shit field position but ben is getting us in the end zone here
three turnovers in the first quarter we got ourselves a street fight today boys
please stop making me have to blow my liver out
2nd sack
damn this has been a really sloppy game by both teams
love to see the defense get those turnovers but right now im more worried about the offense getting its chemistry back if we dont at least flip the field ravens are back in scoring position again
i wouldve already had 3 beers by now if i wasnt on shift fuckin hell
that deep pass aint it
bens deep ball has completely disappeared
what a run on a bad call
the best part after seeing the replay is it appears that lamar didnt even realize the ball was gone at first
romo talks too damn much
what happened to this offense
what is that playcall
impotent drive
handoff up the middle on 3rd and 10
all that for a draw play
oh yeah a run on 3rd and 10
what the fuck randy
we playing sloppy football
they are playing everting up close in the box wtf kind of dumb call is that
that was terrible
we are better off going for it every 4th down
funny when teams run it on 3rd and 10
the fuck is that playcall
defense out there what 9m so far
why the fuck did we just run the ball
draft a punter in the first
ah bad kick too tsk
in no way is berry better than colquitt or literally any midget soccer player
berry didnt lose a step
thats some spineless 3rd and 10 right there
jordan berry is the danny green of the nfl bricks everywhere
fucking berry
should have called a timeout they werent ready stupid stupid stupid
did they say its raining looks like both teams having trouble handling the ball
i wish just once the ravens would have a shit defense
should just go for it and throw an interception down the field better than watching this aussie fuck kick
just see what the defense can do with the ball if the offense doesnt want to play
why did he just stop and look at him
i still cant believe that berry is the best we could do at punter
you kidding me sack the guy
oh nooooo
wtf his knee
i guess theyre just not calling offensive holding this year bud getting hooked like woah
dude is effed
did they call a flag on that sack what is everyone complaining about
oh no carts of that nature
that sucks
it really be your own teammate throwing people into your ankle
oh thats probably broken
that shit is broke
ohh shit thats awful that looked horrible
yikes a leg isnt supposed to bend like that
i dont root for injury thats too bad for him just unlucky
alualu is doubtful to return i hate seeing all these injuries hopefully stanley isnt hurt too bad
feel horrible for snead
of course it had to be tj to accidentally fall on him ravens fans want his head
ravens are going down like flies clearly not intentional on the steelers part ravens better not try revenge
happy he got paid
ouch terrible injury
diontae came back in the game but i didnt see if he was hobbling or not anyone get eyes on that
i am glad he just got paid hoping for a quick recovery
thats sucks to see hopefully its just a scare sprained ankle or something
ok get a stop defense
3rd and 18 oh boy
almost but great stop
obviously points would be stellar but id settle for flipping the field here
is diontae johnson still out
shoved out of bounds wheres the flag
late hit 15 yards pls
ben thrown lasers in like seconds
two drops
the ravens biggest defensive strength is their dbs correct
ben
sigh
try to pin em berry
rain is killing us i guess
its third and fucking three short quick pass fot a first


fuck
so far were making too many mistakes gotta get that in check right now t
jackson has never won a game that mattered cool
finally a good punt 47 with no return
oof play calling is rough
ben missed conner for a woulda been at least 10 on the 2nd and 3 totally uncovered in the flat damn
what a game
i get nervous anytime the pocket collapses and ben still throws i always think hes going to smack someones helmet
we gotta get some offense going just pathetic
well we never play good for two halves so at least were getting the bad half out of the way early
lol can we stop the run
defense is getting tired
offense isnt doing anything and the d is getting tired
bend dont break
well that fucking sucked
why are we fucking abysmal
jesus christ defense watch the ball
you know i was dahn giant eagles and i got some swiss cheese

never thought id jinx the game
no alualu is really showing
this is where bush wouldve made a difference imo
the hell is that blood on spillanes arm
run game killing the d
goddamit tysons presense is very much needed
we gotta stop the damn run
watching the defense get gashed on run plays makes me the opposite of happy
baltimore running the ball well with backup lineman in
fuck
buggs is getting absolutely abused lol and spillane has got to start staying clean on some of these runs dont need to come crashing down hill every play
any update on diontae
they are playing with us with ease rn
guyyyyys patch the holes this isnt defense this is swiss cheese
we need to stop the run badly
well this run d looksabysmal
wtf bud doing
i dont like that
ravens are running on us like no other team has find an answer boys
offense needs to get their shit together
more than one hundred yards fuck
the one time we dont run at him he keeps it
ravens going for a 400 yard rushing game
edges have been watching lamar and the one time they dont
come on defense what are you doing
fucking hell
our offense needs to pick it up
steelers need to answer

the offense needs to do something this drive
man i hate teams with mobile quarterbacks
did our coaches stay in pittsburgh
what do we think guys 3 and out or 5 and out here
if at any point the offense decides it would like to start playing that would be cool
would like to see benny snell here sometime soon
not even worried i expected us to be sluggish in this game
weve given up 125 yards rushing and were only half way through the second quarter
hire todd haley
offense lets go lets put some points on the board
theyre too afraid of lamar that they are just straight up ignoring the running backs the dline is getting bullied
ben wtf was that
johnson what the actual fuck
the offense cant keep our defense off the field
man they are charged
best run of the day
thank god he wrap both arms around the ball
nice throw ben
wish we would nickel and dime them since ben cant hit it deep
good thing thats big ben snagging those snaps
is this game just going to be 1910s style all running or
guys we score here tie it then get the ball at the half take the lead and let our defense rest and play at 100 everythings fine
there ya go conner
and theres a three straight running place i called
this is too fucking predictable
thank god thank you jc we need that
yes lets run the ball and get some play action going
ok thats a start lets see some nice pass plays now
i couldnt tell what happened on that pass was is deceptively far from johnson or did he simply fail to turn and look for it
thats at least 2 bad snaps from pouncy
has to be offset right
bye bye
bye judon
to the showers bitch
losing judon is big
i love refball
classy
i know that was unintentional but damn you gotta be in control there lol
wow im surprised that the steelers are only trying to run
i missed it kid woke up why did raven get ejected
oh shit losing judon is fucking huge loss for them god damn that was stupid
bens throws are so low
just get the 1st down
here comes a run
im fucking pissed
pouncey blows today
is this the first time weve played a good defense
wimpy fans smh
what doofus in the stands is wearing an elite flacco t shirt the fuck
did i miss a play wasnt the 15 yard penalty an auto first
wow ben looks like ass today
ridiculous
atleast we gave the defense a rest
with all these blitzes this is the one time i wouldnt mind a rb or wr screen holy shit the offense is garbage today
wake tf up offense
man this is really hard to watch how many punts in a row is that
maybe we can get another pick 6
onya jordan
what the eff happened to all the presnap motion and short quick plays that keep the defenses on their heels wtf is this game plan
sheesh seems like the steelers offense is shook mainly ben his passes and command of the offense is not right thankfully as i type this there is still a lot of football left to correct the mishaps
its the whole offense really dropped balls miscommunication bad throws bad blocks and playing against a scary defense
steelers are a one half team well get it in the second
crazy day
offense playing scared
do we have offensive plan today
still can get the score before the half
offense lookin doo doo
well lets see what kind of adjustments tomlin can make at half time were still very much in this game need the offense to give our d some help here
our defense just watching lamar sprint for the first down and not reacting this is so bizarre
x200b

x200b

goff drunk or what
its so obvious lamar is keeping the ball cant believe we didnt have someone that just focused on him
we spent the week watching the great pumpkin on repeat
offence is really stinking up the joint
so we are just going to let them run it 3 times and not stop the clock
maybe i am just paranoid but its hard not to be when you have a 40 year old qb but when i see roethlisberger getting his injured arm massaged on midfield i cant shake the terrifying feeling that rudolph will be under center after the half
fuck ya
what a fucking int
definitely not a pick
no pick
not an int
you know the other thing is ben isnt playing well but this game plan isnt doing him any favors i mean at least try to force a 5050 ball to claypool
that wont count unfortunately
he has the nose
haden you gotta catch that
haden
even the camera work in this game sucks
not a pick lol
fuck sakes
damnit so close
it doesnt move
damn it
again at least its a breather for the d
damn we needed that
this is a tough one he doesnt have traditional control but that ball doesnt move when it hits the ground could go either way
joe finger tips haden
let that ruling stand or so help me ill just wanna cry
so can the refs be terrible and keep this as a pick we deserve some refball in our favor
just got here wtf going on with ben
i think we all knew ben couldnt go an entire 7 games without an injury
cmon boys cmon more of that
itd be cool to get this call but hadens catches are always 5050
am sad
i think if there was no mid air adjustment by haden you have a higher chance of that being kept as a pick
i mean
god damn it
defense is optional
moving the chains so effortlessly too bad man
damn
illegal formation by sneed cannot be running forward before the snap
god hes so good i hate him so much gotta respect it tho
why did nobody follow the man in motion
does our defense forget how to tackle when playing baltimore
they can only do one thing guys

good pressure watt
bless tj man hes just such a good dude
embaressing
we got this
offense has to pick it up
our blessed mother of half time adjustments please dont fail us now
lucky were only down 10 were trash right now
bengals pulling away from the titans wtf lol
baker is being baker this division is between us and this other team
down 10 we get the ball lets go
remember josh scobee
weve come back from worse but i dont know if weve looked worse in the first half and still come back
defense move cam and tuitt in a little bit

offense go empty with 19 1118 13 89 85
why do i feel like that fg was the nail in the coffin for us offense please wake the fuck up
three points in four quarters and like 200 total yards oh yeah at least three turnovers if not four
how much time did the steelers have possession in the first half

release the kraken
offense started moving the ball looks like ben is calling plays makes sense
i love these post wall sideline reporters with their awful voices
get jaylen samuels off the fucking field he does nothing
juju making it look easy
i cannot believe the ravens fell right into that trap where we pretend to not know what were doing on offense at first


the fools
even though i currently cant watch the gamelets go
what the fuck was that big ben
ben has been so predictable
clearly our offense didnt adjust during halftime
1 completion in 8 passes yikes
go for the down distance

defense had 45s of game time rest
holy fuck berry you are so trash
me at the start of the drive this is a td drive1
giving it to stinktown aint ya refs

f this offense
open up with an empty backfield it works never see it again on the drive
its time for a sack fumble defense
why are we not giving conner the ball at all hes the only thing thats worked on offense so far
please just commit to staying 5 wide
just get juju conner and chase the ball in space and let them make shit happen

this offense is completely disjointed
lets go highsmith
highsmith omg
thank god
finally
that right there
defense doing it all once again
just what we needed
lets fucking gooooooo huge
oh we have the football now can we do a thing please

love this team please lets go already
lamar woodley
there you go rook nice play highsmith
me and my brother sometimes watch panthers games fuck this feels the same
score you bums
well thats ideal
im surprised jackson has the green light to throw a pass at this point
lets fucking gooooo
yeah the rook
lets go
just kick the field goal now lol
touchdown
thank christ
thank you defense again
lets go d
hopefully this flips all the momentum
lamar is such a bad passer its hilarious
gg lamar giving the steelers the ball back because of how bullshit that no call was
there ya go boys
some mvp throwing right there
we gotta capitalize of those mistakelets gooo
there it fucking is highsmith fucks

ill take it lol
snag
hung alex with the play
thats what i like to see
there it is
alright defense we need some more of that
oh that feels nice
weve got a fucking ball game boys somehow
lets goooo fuck the ravens
thats realistically 3 picks on 15 attempts wonder if theyll abandon the pass
holy fuck he was open lmao finally something good happened and two plays in a row
big momentum swing
ben is 615 so maybe work on that next drive
lets do some more of that starting to get back to that feeling i had in the first minutes
big ben robotic arm activated
are you fucking kidding me
at least that gave our defense a rest
need a 3 and out
lamar is keeping us in this game
have the ravens had a penalty called on them yet other than judon punching the ref and other stupid ones like 12 men on the field that dont even matter
bud crossed the line
a 3 and out holy shit
that looked better
robo cop
never has a 3 and out made me so happy
lfg
a stop lets go
spillane is the shit
spillane has made some plays
huge drive upcoming for us
whew got the stop offense needs to start pulling their weight now
alright offense lets do something please
if i was the ravens oc id just pull out the triple option playbook army uses and borrow plays from that
spillane playing good football today
alright lets shift the momentum in our favor now come on boys
charge down the field
i feel like the offense has been very uncreative today
ebron balling today
lmao a 1st down run i am shocked
we havent seen any jet sweeps huh
boy that field must be stupidly wet
oh my gosh dpi finally
ebron didnt realise he burnt his defender and didnt go for the yac
wow they finally called it
i like them using ray ray more
hey did you know lamar was mvp last year i had zero clue
bro wtf johnson had no idea what was going on lol
wow that was interesting
i think the empty set is working better
crazy what a difference having your offense makes
this is the offensive drive i like to see
dj didnt even know what to do lol
ughhh throw it away ben
here comes mapletron
dammit ben get rid of it
all ive done is tell you that youre right and i even gave you a gold star so far youve tried to tell me that youre an nfl ref a psychologist and now you are a special athletics trainer who was on field and determined specifically that diontae johnson would have had zero chance to catch that ball on that specific play your resume is ridiculous champ you really probably are a modern day renaissance person whats it like to be perfect maybe ill get there one day too and be just like you
get juju the fucking ball more
i dont understand why conner is running the routes he is running
lfgoooooo
just run the damn ball up the gut lol
fucking great catch fighting for the first down
juju with a grown man catch getting the first
juju strong
god i hate wasting timeouts
just punch this shit in please
i missed this drive what the hell did we do
lets see juju yardage gain conner not so much we might be on to something here
hell yeah
why is the mo in baltimore gold in the endzone
lets fucking go
i vote ben for oc
defense finally got some real rest too
lets go
what are we doing can we prevent an aneurysm from me please
a 3 and out please
the ravens center always snaps the ball like a madman lmfao poor lamar
defense
what happened to alualu
titans really losing to the bungals lol
tomlin doesnt do secondhalf adjustments
nooooo
man he is slippery
jesus lamar tried to get tackled for 4 yards before we did it
luck of ravens
wtf why did he throw that ball away he had it
that last steelers drive had 12 more yards than the o had the whole first half
3rd an long damn right
revenge of the steelers
great stop d
oh my god i literally dont care that carvana invented car vending machines like theyre so proud of it
why didnt we challenge spillane
a nice 7 minute drive please
stay up mcfarland that wouldve been a gain of at least 9
didnt mcfarland trip last week too mans way to fast for himself
romo is savage
mcfarland did that last week

jook himself into the ground

why throw it behind the line of scrimmage
shitty field
dammit man
not ideal
there is a jersey giveaway in the threads go cast your prediction
james harrison popped him
great time for another turnover
where is the cat with that offense
feeling a int this drive
man im surprised that dude got back up
damn already at midfield
gahhh at least 1 first down would have been good there
watt does it again
what the fuckkkkk
that was a decent punt
come on defense get a turnover please
buggs my man
sacksburgh
good shit buggs keep that up
4min left in browns raiders 4th quarter left in this one

is alualu hurt
biggy biggy buggs

buggs keep eating my man
wow just wow
oh right theres our secondary
edmunds got torched
seriously on nickel he gets that open
bro he just walked past two defenders
edmunds
shit hold them to 3
worst defense in the league on 3rd and long not even close
unbelievable
wtf edmunds lol
they are kicking a field goal
takeway is thay spillane has hella hustle
just drop everyone into coverage on 3rd and long how does he get that open thats 6 if lamar doesnt underthrow him
how what the fuck
edmunds and haden are the weak links
blast edmunds into the moon
fuck me
fuck man
fuuuuuuuuuuck
fucking tebow all over again so bad it works
how tf ugh
thats what 7 plays over 20 yards
fast guy is fast
holding
holding muthafucka
this team is so fucking frustrating holy fuck
thank god holy fuck

thank you jesusit is sunday
you gotta be fuckin kidding me
im nervous

holding chief
son of a
spillane has seriously looked good hes not brian urlacher but hes really been fucking good he looks legitimately athletic repeatedly
2nd and 22 oh boy
yeah fuck that beat us throwing the ball jackson you bitch
bend dont break
ha bitch holding
hold em to 3
wtf is going on
so on like the 10000000 time they finally call it
what the fuck dude
where is our coverage
we got lucky af and we let them wide open again
where the fuck is the defense holy shit
pathetic
22 yards


fucking how
what is that secondary what the hell
defense is exhausted
how is willie snead playing like a fucking allpro
all of a sudden our d cant play coverage
wtf are we doing this isnt us being tired anymore this is just mental errors now
still the worst secondary in the nfl that hasnt changed
i fucking hate zone coverage so much
good holding call love it more
okay defense quit with the big plays good lord
standing in the middle of the field with no one within 10 yards in any direction interesting
heres the scary thing if the ravens take the lead our offense will have to win or lose this game
our secondary is very subpar
offense gotta do something this next drive
3rd and 14 and yall do this
holy fuck they are cooking this defense with ease now
the middle doesnt need to always be wide open
jfc wasted the holding call are you kidding
what the fuck is our defense doing
sneads talking like hes good lmao
youre fucking joking 2nd and 22 is automatic
i thought this shit was cleaned up
so ridiculous im screaming at the screen to cover sneadand i dont know shit can we at least have a bare minimum of professional football on every down fuck
incomplete
way to try and strip it
go ahead and waste a timeout
out
no way thats a catch
so since the offence woke up in the 3rd quarter our d is going to fall asleep
looks like a stands call to me
dont get how you overturn that but its a challenge they never make sense
enough to overturn
looked out never know what zebras will do
3rd blown coverage this drive
we need to score again anyway maybe this wakes them up
clearly out
not a catch
does the knee replace the other foot being down in that case
no way to overturn that
lets go defense
wide open after all that
how about dont play zone then
fuck
blown coverage fire sale
just fucking play man in the redzone against lamar
please do not come out throwing screens
son of a whore
defense absolutely clueless and out coached today
need to score here
balfimore is still a top afc team lol its normal that the game is this close
that was a huge hole in coverage
i swear to fuck if our play calling is ass again
secondary needs to practice more they look lost
that was an awful throw too
just take the damn 25
this is a great game
this is afc north football
hey whatever happened to vance
smh
eazye
ray ray
extreme face masking
nice facemask
fucking ratbirds
im fine with a few positive yards each down
that was closer to vintage ben
nice
kinda scared about a long drive here ravens could easily retaliate
these deep balls to claypool aint it
i kinda didnt want to get down the field this fast lmao
romo wearing purple tinted glasses
they almost got 200 rushing yards lol so much for number 1 rush defense
ravens are really handing us this one
juju ward

does lamar have the ability to go on a game winning drive
damn just needed 2 yds
ew
close out these games my heart cant do this
come on berry you fucking muppet pin it deep
its so weird to me when coaches dont pass there so what incomplete whats the difference between them getting it with 140 or 1
we need a berry 50

they are going to try to block
theyll get the ball at our 45 with how trash berry is the defense has to be perfect here baltimore can score on any play
4 and out
play call not on connor
should have probably thrown that ball but hindsight and all that
yes berry
for once in your life dont be a disappointment jordan
good boy berry
this is absolutely the last team i want to punt to god damn nail biter
oh god i do not like this amount of pressure on berry
oh please no



alright get it ready again when the time is right you crank that shit
decent punt
thank you berry
dislike that up the gut run entirely
not bad berry
do not play prevent defense
keep them in bounds
i feel like pittsburgh has murdered at least a thousand people with these damn heartattack games
just keep them inside
thats grounding
breathes into a paper bag
grounding
at least they ran the ball and chewed up some clock better than an incomplete pass with 140 left
how is that not grounding
grounding
id feel a lot more comfortable if we had got that first down
at least they have to throw
please hold them please hold them please hold them
grounding
thirddddddd downnnnnnnn
dfence

lets fucking goooooo
all you mother fuckers complaining about ben if he goes out i am blaming you and reminding you of your idiocy for every bad qb play the rest of the year
washington wants to deal haskinsso if bens elbow is fucked we should call them hes for sure better than rudolph or duck
wow i came in here for some nice discussion but all you guys do is bitch

1 refs have made a bad call for both teams
2 romo is the best broadcaster
3 its the first quarter
that penalty was so dumb man gotta be better against these fuck heads
this is all on the offence being useless
this sub cannot accept anything other than perfection huh
bruh he didnt even lose control
we are down 7 lol this team is still in it yall need to calm the fuck down
this is where rookie wide receivers let you down trying to do too much
damnit claypool
broo can we please stop wasting first down with a run every fucking time
hire todd haley
god damn it hit him make that rb masquerading as a qb pay for his charade
i see some people in here blaming the wrs sure but have you seen some of these passes lol
that pick 6 felt like ages ago ravens are making us look like were in 2019 again
spillanes pick six is hiding the fact that we are getting dominated right now
were imploding were not playing clean football
this offense is pissing me off beyond belief i want to fucking scream ben is so atrocious
ravens rbs doing to us what we thought henry would do to us
hope we play better on the rematch game on thanksgiving dont want to lose my appetite for my late evening 3rd and 4th plates
alright that was not what i expected after that pick6 and last weeks start but were still in it altough a 2nd half opening td is urgent d is getting tired the way this half went unfortunately it got called back but that haden pick was sexy nonetheless we got this here we go
boys as long as ben is healthy we have a chance whats with the hate today even if we get smacked were 61 relax big game but i remember week 2 last year that feeling the year is done when ben went down just be greatful we have 7 and were sitting at 60 also only down 10 fans on here are crazy
what is with all these shitty rappers with shitty food orders from mcds
romo is fucking embarrassing himself
3rd and 14 and 2nd and 22 fuck you defense
dad whats a secondary
you know what i hate when ben knows that hes playing like literal shit he then starts acting like hes injured or that theres something going on
refs vs steelers awesome claypool clearly got that back
yall are nothing but doom and gloom over here jesus theres so much game to play settle down
theres where spillane kills you in coverage trying to manup
fucking bullshit dog shit fucking penalty
why are we putting linebackers on wrs
why is the nfl gifting all of our opponents points
lol back to the old days where we playing lb vs best receiver
stupid fucking penalty on heyward thats what happens
i cant get over that horseshit penalty fucking killer
why tf would we have vince on boykin on 3rd and goal lamar didnt even look to see if he was open he just threw it right when he saw that mismatch
heyward with not a smart play its a bad call but no fucking reason to give them an opportunity to make a bad call
these must be the same refs from the titans game
welp this game turned on a dime
maple fml
bush being out for season will hurt as in such big games a lot bush would have got that tackle for a 4th down
defense cant stop giving up big yardage plays its a problem
dj runs 3 routes and hes out again and its not the injury he previously had

hes made of paper
whats wrong woth ben overthrown everyone for last 6 weeks
why do we do third and long bombs or run plays
if thats the play called on third down and 10 against this defense just cut out the middle man and punt it on third
the run on 3rd and 10 makes sense there the ravens were clearly going to bring pressure and you could see ben completely reworking the play to take advantage in the holes that they opened up in the second level by blitzing if conner bounces outside there then its a first and the idea was right to take advantage of what they were being shown a sack in your own red zone hurts so much more there
well that was a good 122 million investment
i hate injuries
biggest game of the year and the game is tied 3rd and 10 and youre starting to lose momentum what do you do a draw play of course
thats an expensive injury
holy crap ebron caught a pass
this rain favours baltimore much more fml
i thought we had the best run defense
steelers always have a good half and a bad half hopefully this is the latter
concussion protocol
why does gus edwards only play good against the steelers
one stupid penalty changed the entire complexion fucking stupid
defense just got bullied that wasnt even a competitive drive
holy fuck if the offence cant produce this drive its over
wheres cam heyward at hes been completely invisible other than taking a stupid penalty resulting in 7
bunch of fuckin babies in itt its a one possession game in first half
ok guys time to lose your shit first fire butler post wins a plate of jumbo
this is a game we needed devin bush for having a quick mike lb is an essential to beat this team
if this possession ends in a punt were in trouble
bro wtf i hate marcus peters
baltimore showing its class
offense is looking rough
ben looks like straight dog shit
this game is so annoying
another pick 6 cause defense is the only way were scoring with ben playing like this
why have all of our snaps been so bad pouncey isnt what he used to be
ben sucks cock today
ben has been horrible today pull your head out of your ass
here we go back to asking the d to save the day the ravens d so far is too fast too prepared and too hungry one more td by the ravens could lock it up good thing its sunday cause im praying right now
imagine how scary the ravens would be if they had a good quarterback who could pass
lamar could have went to the parking lot got in his car and still driven through that hole
hopefully ben is ok

but i would rather see dobbs than rudolph if ben is hurt it would be mason though
thank god we didnt try to get a serviceable backup
bens elbow issue makes me angry that we havent done shit to upgrade from the backups we have
injured ben is best ben
no catch
great job calling a timeout tomlin what the fuck did you do during the review
and another lamar first
i hate watching this game how tf do you let them get that
why cant we stop the run
lamar cant be stopped at all
10 yard run on 1st and 15
i hate these fucks
down 10 at the half would be a miracle fully expecting a touchdown here
i am sick of having watt just key on the qb every play its a waste of your best defender let him use his instincts and make plays
can we please get a fucking stop now here comes the fg or worse
217 at halftime would not be good
everyone needs to breathe
absolutely fucking pathetic coaching and execution
losing alualu pretty much ended this game
god damn it tucker is a fucking cheat code i hate him
heyward penalty is scarring me
is 24 yards passing the lowest ben has ever had in a 1st half
the offense needs to turn things around or the rat birds will put up more points
took a shower to wash the stink off new half hopefully we turn it around
our receivers are doing their jobsbesides that 1 drop our pass pro is stepping up ben needs to shape the fuck up
why is samuels in or even a first read he is utter trash
why does jaylen samuels continue to see snaps or targets
berry sucks
big ben always just chucks it on 3rd down
johnson wasnt even trying to play the ball it was dpi but youre not going to get that call when the wr literally gives up
were on the road in shitty weather against a ravens team who had two weeks to prepare lets not overreact here
forwards conner jesus christ
is it just me or does the momentum still kinda feel neutral
fuuuuuuck yes nice work offense
i know we all want to win but i really hate our fans being toxic on the first half when the game isnt lost yet its frustrating for everyone and then reading hate comments just makes it worse lets trust our team to make big plays
do not start with this bs again
tony romo loving this stroking em a bit
please get a 3rd down stop please get a 3rd down stop
theres that classic defense
the hold is what created the play great call
the only reason jackson has been able to do that all day holding finally called
you know were bad at drafting in the secondary when everyone on draft day said we reached for edmunds
hell yeah ready to watch these refs just give this to the ravens
okay lets go o
baltimore scored too soonexpect us to come backand jesus the lamar jackson 3 int trash gimmicky qb love needs to stopjesus its annoying
man minkah just looked completely lost out their that entire drive lets go o
man steelers are lucky today
man this juju kid we should through him the ball
renegade


what is happening with this defense
fire keith butler
fucking hell man our d fucking packs up and goes to lunch every time our offense puts in some work disheartening as all hell
this sub needs to quit it with the fatalistic bullshit we are having the best start to a season in most of our lifetimes chill
if they get the td we can tie it for ot with a field goal
lamar jackson youve been figured out you frog face fuck steelers d
when the fuck is our bye week
fuck yes
70 motherfuckers
fuck you ratbirds
70 youll never sing that
jesus christ 70 im so scared but also happy im a glass case of emotions
he would have caught that if it wasnt for minka
seven and oh how nervous i am
lamar lost that game
minkahhhhhh
minkah
7 and fucking 0
that was stressful
i was close on my prediction that we get 5 takeaways final was 4
its ok guys tomlin will make one of his signature halftime adjustments and well lose this game by at least 35
why are they showing idiot donald trump ads
the refs will call this every time heyward should know better
wow maybe the betting lines knew something we didnt didnt think it would be this one sided especially surprised how bad our run d has been
johnson has a shit attitude honestly its come out a few times this year and i hate when receivers completely quit on passes to try and get a call
who the fuck is j balvin
our defense has been ass since the 2nd half against tennessee
jim nantz is a dickhead
that field goal will lose us the game i love my black and gold but if they dont show up in the second half its plain over
you would think tomlin would know after 13 fucking years baltimore never dies
i have a bad feeling were about to lose this game by a big margin havent had that feeling all year
about the only thing good from this broadcast so far is seeing the att girl and how i want to wreck it
does lamar jackson have the stupidest hair in the league
this looks like the rudolphduck offense
cant wait for ben to go 3 and out again
i cant wait to see who ben overthrows next
ben is playing like total shit
so maybe another pick 6 our defense is basically our whole team today

jesus fucking christ its not like theyre gonna run every play why would they do that
jackson can just throw the ball on the ground as he runs through open field to fuck with us and we are doing nothing about it
how do we let that happen we know its coming every arm chair coach saw that coming yet we let it happenagain
defense has been playing well offense needs to step the hell up in the second half
yall need to stfu lol we are down 10 points with half of the game left we are a 2nd half team relax
wtf these deep passes are not working stop doing them every time ben had a guy open in the seam
ben fucking sucks today well games not over yet but this is on him today and if the titans had come back last week i wouldve squarely blamed it on ben then too for mind numbing decisions

he goes through a two or three game stretch like this every year hopefully he gets this out of his system now and we can move forward but this is ugly
even beer says to vote lmao
fitz is not having the best of years
isnt minkah supposed to be a top safety in the league dude has resembled swiss cheese for us this year smfh
would love to see this defense under a coordinator who isnt a complete moron
this is prolly reactionary but id be down to just get darnold and use bens money to pay dupree
if that was conner he wouldve ran straight into the wall
wobble ball come on captain fat fuck
im not giving up on ben rn but who do you think the steelers are gonna do about the qb situation
our defense cant stop anything
another week another embarrassment in some sort against this team
muting romo for the second half
if big ben is having doubts about his arm i think we should try and get fitzmagic for cheap i really dont trust rudolph if ben goes down
edit or just trade for darnold as the jets are trying to get lawrence
our defense is not as good as we thought
these refs are unimaginably against us today
ten fucking players couldnt get one player down holy shit

meanwhile a finger tap will bring conner down
its time for captain fatfuck to lead his men
how about a trade for fitzmagic
if the steelers lose this one with 3 raven starters out shame on them
got the defibrillator ready
bince in coverage
ravens for sure gifted that td
god that penalty was so stupid
that ones on casey took all the life out of the defense
wtf ebron
elite
ebron is so so unreliable
calling that the joe falco
joe flacco move lol
that was pretty uncatchable this rivalry is ass when the refs take over makeup call
kill me now
fuck my life
thats steelers football baby
defense on the field way too much 1st quarter going to be tired out real quick
looks like its gonna be a long half because as we know we can only play one half of good football
get a fucking stop defense dammit
diontae johnson cant stay fucking heathy
fuck man tyson doubtful
come on ben
why are they running oh wait ok first down
same old first quarter offence dont stress too soon
why did we get rid of colquitt i thought he was doing fine
shouldve stuck with colquitt smh
crazy thought but im willing to bet our offense is still in the scripts dj going out fd everything up need to let ben start calling the plays
why arent we trusting the run game on 1st or 2nd but then run on 3rd and 10 playing some dumbass ball right now
fuck


i hate injuries
he got dakd real talk
is ben okay
this offense is dawg rn good defense do
offense looks badddd
jeez is our rush d that bad without alualu
what happened to the run defense from weeks 17
alualu being out is killing them
it may be tied but we absolutely look like the worse team
maybe i dunno stop somebody
ravens are just a horrible matchup for us its pretty obvious
lmao is this the steelers defense or a big 10 defense
this is a fucking joke
alright have to stop this weak ass turtle bullshit now
78 with the bear hug to open the hole on the td just disgusting reffing
now this was the most humiliating drive ive ever seen against our defence holy hell was that embarrassing
this offense is probably the worst ive ever seen
peters is a dirty bum
are offense is playing worse than the bears offense
suspend him for the season
offense is absolute trash today
ben should keep throwing only deep balls because hes nailing them every time
leave it to the ratbirds to hit him in the elbow
64 yards

lol
im not ready for the reindeer time
would love to see the time of possession difference holy fuck
jackson giving up the ball some more but luckily he was falling toward it
remember guys steelers deferred stay hopeful


this defense is trash today
hahahahahahaha another first down
this is hilarious at this point what the fuck
cant even keep him in bounds unfuckingreal
they beat the brakes off us that half not going to lie
this is depressing watching these guys get bullied this first half
i cant believe were only down 10
the steelers need to give my boy juju some targets
is tomlin going to bother adjusting or is it going to just be harbaugh again
i wouldve like to see ben out there once after that whole elbow holding tackle
200 more offensive yards than us
unnecessary roughness pushed juju out of bounds s
unreal thats ball game
this offense is so boring god
fuck everything
inc inc inc punt

way to come out swinging
that looked like some pi curious ravens fan here at work trying to watch the game is bens elbow fucked
who let lamar throw the ball
i swear to fucking god ben if you dont put points on the board with this field position then you need to retire mid game
we would be blown out if not for lamars passing
i will honestly be so proud of this team if we lose by less than seven
fuck off romo
review that shit tomlin god damn
damn white woodley couldve caught that
we ended their streak mfers

edit
like how idiot down voted for me pointed out we ended the ravens quarter scoring streak
lamar the slug it doesnt rhyme but its fun to say lamar sluggg
sack lunch
we all know lamar keeping it and scramble please keep a eye on him running

goddammit
jesus fucking christ why are guys wide open minkah is fucking lost
our d is getting smacked around this quarter
lmao they still got the td nice
spillane blew it
this defense got so many chances lmfaooooo and they still broke
we just gave up 3 tds in a row
minkah shitzpatrick fucked every play and yet again blows it
we are completely incapable of playing with a lead unless were playing cleveland and its frustrating as fuck
this will be the biggest drive of the defense right here right now stop them
lets go defense
stfu romo
this run defense is some madden cheese
fuckin gashing us and eating up clock

disaster drive
romo he was wide open lmao
oh fuck heyward
my heart skipped a beat there
fuck my fucking heart
thank fuck
devin who
come on rookie know when to get down

todd haley is a fucking legend compared to fichtner
fuck you america with your whore commercials you sold
umm why does this look like last years offense wtf
baltimore isnt going to pass until they have to sell out to the run lamar jacksons arm isnt a threat when it is a 77 game
if the offense doesnt score on this upcoming drive were getting blown out
wow a second team oline is dominating our elite front 7

this is fucked
the two turnovers not withstanding the ravens offense is having their way with the steelers defense its really not close this game is 2 plays away from 210 with the ravens driving the ball to the 2 on the turnover this game is close but it wont be for much longer
romo is a pussy ass bitch
everybody hating the offense its deserved but rememberthe ravens defense is really really good too
lol their up by 7 points and its the end of the world
who is 7 and what has he done with my hall of fame qb
god please not rudolph
stil got mad faith but cmon boys after psu last night gimme something
thats a catch thats a catch
pathetic the most obvious play call ever
i know its early but i dont see us winning this unless we see a big change in the second half
its fucking pathetic we are giving up points on this drive
this is fucking ridiculous
fort and 15 allow 10 we miss bush and whoever thinks spillane is enough to not trade for an ilb is blind
dont know how were gonna win when our offense has done just 64 yards all game when lamar is going 64 yards almost every drive
not panicking but man do dobbins and edwards look great for the ravens theyve got good depth at rb connor hasnt been terrible but would love to see mcfarland in weather conditions like this
ill get a jersey for anyone that predicts the winning score lets go

edit also whoever predicts our offensive and defensive mvp

edit 2 steelers win
one of my dogs is such a dick hell come out from under the blankets looks around sees where the other dog is laying and then decides he wants to lay under that blanket like i should move her for him
god damn we need to lay some more heavy hits on him
nice now bal has to score a td
theyve got over 250 yards rushing on us man i fucking hate this team
just go the fuck down rookie mistake
i feel like juju mustve told claypool all week hey man they fucked me last year by knocking the ball out watch out for that its almost like they dont learn
conner is just an average or perhaps slightly below average running back he doesnt play smart enough to find good lines doesnt have the speed to be elusive doesnt have the bulk to be a truck idk i just dont and never have had confidence in him
ravens have the 30th ranked offense and were getting waxed on defense

lamar is so fucking overrated
tony romo is a bitch
shut the fuck up romo
looks like an int to me

lamar is the only reason were in this game all these runs and short passes keep them from scoring big
ben deserves to lose i hesitate to say the steelers as a team because the entire offense stalling is almost entirely on ben
this d has been a dumpster fire this game
this fucking dick head cant get 2 yards smh
offense is literally useless and ben knew the blitz was coming 217 before the half with how bad the d has been
i dont give a fuck what you guys say our defense is not that good
week after week we can just not get out of our own way there is no more frustrating team to watch in the entire nfl
why do we suck so bad how tf are we 60

lets face it its hard to beat a bettercoached team

doesnt matter who we have on the field
look for claypool to get plenty of targets last week dj got 15 targets juju got 14 targets claypool got 1 target that was a plan to get juju and dj going

this week against the ravens claypool will get his chances
looking for ravens to use a lot of jet sweeps with duvernay today to try and keep our run defense off balance itll probably get them some chunk plays early but well adjust and prevail
guys i wore a safety jersey every game this year troy or mink but i was sick last week and didnt wear a jersey in bed what do i do
is there a steaming site where i can watch live in upstate ny so buffalo is all i get on tv
my cbs screen is frozen other channels work fine anybody else dealing with this
would love if we could have some 430 games so i dont have to watch from work every week
ah yes rocket mortgage thats why i dont just get a bigger place because i didnt know how easy it was

thanks rocket mortgage
here we go
god i hope for a repeat of them standing around looking at each other while time runs out

that was a single greatest ending ive ever seen
here we go steelers here we go
first time ever its lamar vs ben
force them to throw tue ball jackson wont beat us with his arm
omg i love it
omfg
robo omg
yes after that lie of an incomplete
robo cop
lets fucking go baby
s
lets fucking go
oh man
holy shit spillane
i cant stop cumming
what a start baby
lamar about to have a loooooong day
next man up mentality
lfg

spillane is such a great replacement for bush hoping he keeps it going go stillers
lets fucking go
okay haden thats fine
3rd down
jackson is not gonna have a good day taking hits like that regularly
locked up boi
lowered his shoulder
any online stream link

refocus fellas lets hold to 3 here
he is so fast lol

vince are you looking at all
so maybe double their only receiver
spillane slip or was that a pick
welp time to see which offense we get the aggressive or conservative one
yeah its not going to be an easy win
we know what to do
real stream somewhere not scam betting sites
lets show em ben
anybody got a good steam
ba god thats penalty flags music
ugh
this game is quickly taking a turn
no replay of penalty
can we cut ebron this offseason

low but gotta catch everything
hh look another dum dum that just cant help himself hitting people in the back genius nfl players abound
i love a makeup call
penalty bowl
damn ebron
fucking ebron
live stream link anybody
his hands were behind his knee he kneed the ball
wow that is annoying as fuck
make up call lol
damn it
sloppy game jesus christ
i need to get the steelers some osage orange monkey brainsmonkey balls to peel on the sideline sticky hands for sure its not stickum its just a snack
time for another turnover
peters and humphrey really just gonna put on a show today huh
i get it its only the first quartervbut it does suck that we had them in the perfect situation and then cam had a stupid penalty and then the defense got carved up and the offense immediately turns it over after two ugly plays yes its the first quarter but had an advantage and gave it up and look like shit right now hopefully they can get a stop and the offense can give the defense a breather but this has not been awesome so far
fuck dude already in the red zone
pathetic
bush makes that tackle
thats fumble come on
our players do know this is football right theyre allowed to hit the ravens its not baseball
who didnt see that play coming people in scranton saw that coming come on
lets gooo
well well well
what they say about dj
mulligan i guess lol
alright fellas take your time and play smart smart football here
woot
aaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh im freaking out right now wtf
we the north
this is gonna be a crazy game lol
incoming coaches challenge
so todays definitely one of those take your heart medication even if you dont need it kind of days
alright just gotta get a good drive here boys
start callin him lamar turn it over jackson
no running game at all
jesus ben
atta boy jc we needed that
everyones getting injured this game
why are we in molasses so slow o
miss the first of our offensive drives because of the stream what was our turnover
and no good punter either
colquitt wasnt that bad
ughh he could got the first if he went out

dafuq are these play calls
come on guys
damn
bring back colquit

bad punt smh
getting crushed in field position
looking flat as fuck
why cant we find a good punter
jesus
awesome thanks berry glad to have you back
was the ball wet or does the punter suck
fuck jordan berry
thats the jordan berry we know
can we please draft a punter
jesus fucking christ this team
im pretty sure that play call was because the team wasnt lined up properly
it looks like the defense is going to need another offensive score
give it time ben will get hot
if conner cuts outside its a first down
i missed that whole series cause my feed froze but it sounds like i didnt miss anything amazing lol
and the running back takes off
if fichtner called that then hes a moron cant play stupid calls against the ravens you just got the ball back for fucks sake
poor linemen
hes done
definitely broken hope he recovers fast
flipping between this and the vikings game been some bloodbaths out there
decided to watch this game at my parents house my dad wanted to watch on delay so had it recorded now he just  the goddamn recording so not gonna see the first 13 minutes of the game what did i miss
squished his ankle into his shin
just bad luck as fuck seriously on the other hand didnt lamar throw that pass
fuckin ouch dude
fuck man i hope he makes a full recovery thats tough
id like to see some good field position for the offense before i say they are garbage they have been bacccked up
fuck we cant get that going
jackson is scared to run on us i think
love how much ebron is involved
enbron is more good than bad
come on offense get it going
sigh
this offense looks bad
decent punt

finally a decent punt
get samuels out jfc
is johnson n injured
i was reading that how the ravens play they really screw with timing thats what it looked like on ben washington
jaysam gotta catch that
offense will pick it up in the second half
i wanna die
wow
have to do better on offense
defense getting gashed now
yeah this is the sign of a tired defense were not looking good
alright this needs to fucking stop
offense needs to wake up and do something already youre gassing the defense
yo why are yall playing so far back vs the run like youre scared of lamar throwing
it would be nice if offense could fucking perform
ugh
bud caught fucking cheating inside
this is brutal
our offense needs to spend more time on the field the defense is tired
where is our d
oh great
absolute domination so ugly
great
we have to figure out something different with baltimore this shit just isnt going to cut it either today or in the long run
i knew this was going to a tough one
maybe offense will wake up this drive they dont get aggressive until they start losing for some odd reason
time for a long clock killing drive
this is fucking ridiculous
ben has no accuracy today
here we are once again boys defense doing its job and the offense sucking ass once again
what was that throw
i never thought i would be so triggered by a picture of jerome bettis throwing a pass
this offense is doo doo today
damnnn i thought he might break the one either way well take it still a great run
yes go that way
wtb an offense
pouncey baby what is you doin
wow another deep pass to the right sideline we literally only have 3 plays
do they have any offensive plan

its run play or deep ball
pouncey i know the ball is wet but get it together
we may need to runnit more haha
theres been some rough snaps today
lets run the quarter down
attaboy james
thanks ratbirds
man no one needed to be ejected
whoopsie doo
nice one judon
this game is ugly smh
lmaoooo
later gator
lol nfl players are so stupid hitting a ref lol
zebra dies
adios judon

theres no room for that bullshit
you gone judon
wild
wow awesome great
another pass batted down
great throw ben
fuuuuuuck
decastro is good but he jumps so much lol
this is such a shit show
pathetic
were a basically playing without an offense right now 2 of the first down came because of penalties thats pretty much it
had the audio muted who all got ejected
this offense is trash right now
welp this doesnt look to good
offense is so out of sync and it starts with ben
lets get it together boys
were playing scared zero confidence
this team needs to get it together because they definitely dont look like a 60 team
ahhhhhh
it will be interesting to see if the play calling improves once we go no huddle the game plan on both sides of the ball feels way to conservative
tuitt is playing well
god damn it fuck today
jackson trying to help us out again
64 total yards of offense lmfao
whew this game is rough we better come out slinging in the second half
they are literally just doing the same thing over and over again
lamar dropping the ball again
lets fucking go
there we go haden
lets go big joe
not a catch
finally probably wont matter bc our offense isnt gonna do shit
joeeeeee
what a pick
how does lamar get 1 yard there
that hit the ground but then they gave bush that one last year so i dont know
i would say no but really close
joe ducking haden
give him control
ah fucksakeeee
u could see either way

ball moved
come onnnnnnnnnnnnn man
if they give away another 3rd
i would be happy about the stopped clock but we might have to put our trash offense back on the field
fuck
keep fighting d
i s2g if this is for pushing him out of bounds
and we let him rush for 10
were looking helpless out there
i am really disappointed so far its totally ok being down at halftime but the way were playing is concerning cant really stop them and without penalties cant getting a first down without big adjustment we will lose this game without a doubt
is alualu ruled out what happened
just happy only down by 10
how come were not seeing the matt canadas influences in the offense no more
hopefully we can make some adjustments and the offense can come out and out up points first thing and keep this game in range
yikes
disgusting
yuhhhh im excited
here comes a 3rd down fichtner draw

defense save us plz
disappointing
even harbaugh thought it was pi
lamar is so bad at passing
ill take it
thank god defense
lmaoo
lmao
defense fine well do it ourselves
little did they know the ravens gain penalty resistance when you activate the flac dragon pi card
god bless this defense
there we go d is keeping us in this
i dont get the 2nd down call were just running a stop right into a guy and ask a nonreceiver to make a contested catch like that jaylen couldve set that edge they were giving us the run and we would gained the five yards we were trying to gain with a low pass
100 runs in the future
the running back turns it over again
well the dpi should have been in that range so it worked out
atta boy d
please dont waste the int
come on you steel bastards
better score boys no field goals
it took a year or two longer than i thought but jackson will not win anything if there isnt drastic changes
lets fucking score please please please please please
well hopefully the d can bail us out again
if not well shit

fuck jc good try
the offense never looks like they know whats going on
i have a thread for a jersey giveaway go predict everyone
fuck the ravens
we have such a good receiving core its not a big leap to ask ben to do this at a minimum for our passing offense
there was 12 on the field there
wtf happened
yall really thought we were done smh
i trust bens eyes
okay that was weird
how can we run on 3rd and 10s but not sitting a yard away from the goal line
lets fucking go boys hold this lead

steelers football is back
here we go the second half 7 is here
damn that endzone call was great
big stop here boys

yaaaaas
here we go steelers
lets get some more points on the board and make lamar start to have to throw it
things are lookin up
so close
i missed the 1st half and while i like watching regardless it sounds like my heart should be thankful for not dealing with the stress
tony mac keeps his feet there and we pick up 25 damn

well commit some dumb penalty and give them 7 or 8 tries at the goal line
same leg in doesnt count
i think the call stands
no good biotch
3rd down
be inconclusive
oh boy more stress
way too easy still
without a fight we gifted them the td they got everything they want wtf is this secondary
fukkkkk
fuck
hes supposed to be covered
the frick defense spillane just gave em points
no coverage at all
massive meltdown gave up huge plays not even in the screen
im cool with this three point difference right now because it means all we gotta do is kick a field goal to ties it while if we score again a field goal still means they are behind

were in great shape right now

offense needs to step on the gas all the way though
lmfaooo thats another awful deep ball for ben
of course not fuck u refs
ou fuck off

peters never turned around made contact shouldve been a pi
better not pick this one up too
hows that not a foul if heywards hit was
romo is obsessed with claypools height
face mask
heads up by claypool help push
great fucking work juju
flacco special baby
oh fuck yeah we love to see it
way of the flacco
flaaaag
finally
lfg
ily juju
i did not think we would take that first with a bubble screen
juju is tough
pass interference bitch
my power went out fuck man
ravens secondary cant handle the wrs
need a td on this drive tying it up w how baltimore has been able to run the ball is asking a lot of our already gashed defense

juju looking like hines ward on this drive
no turnover
juju is such a solid part of this team you have to appreciate him
way to bounce bank
thats my boy claypool
lets gooooooo
man we need to score and leave a lot of time bal will want to run it down and bring in tucker for a kick
come on defense
yurrrrrr
lets go baby
nice work
please dont let up
lets gooooiiooooosojdwnaoudnw
guys im out of ic light what do i drink now to help the good guys
well today was a good day to start claypool and ben double points on that drive

on the last scoring drive can someone explain how the peters coverage on claypool wasnt another pi he never turned to play the balljust jumped at chase to impede the catch
who was that that whiffed and flew by
are you fucking kidding me defense
this defense is pathetic
uh whats happening here d
offense does good so defense has to give up come on
love fitzpatrick grabbing him by the heel
come on
wtf
man our run d is getting exposed big time today
wow defense this is fucking soft theyre just running down on the field on yall offense gave them rest the last drive and theyre allowing this to be done
theyre now measuring their rushing in miles
im nervous
they are going to kill us with the clock
man our rush defense is making me so sad today
pathetic
fucking wrap them up youve had plenty of time to rest
i know one thing well have mike hilton for the rematch

what is romo talking about
come on defense its all on the line right now dig deep and get a stop please
this game felt like it was lasting forevernow it feels like the end is approaching quickly
please
sheesh if we dont stop them on this play you got to think we are going to let them score a td to allow our offense a chance right
what happened to cam
if they get pass the first down marker then let them score
if they convert this theyre going to run it 3 straight times i promise you theyre not trying to leave us with any time left to get a score

oh my godddd
gutsy throw
of course we cant get the first
a 1st and we win
ok jordan need a good one here
fuuuuck
sigh
if they win its only coming from a busted coverage or big lamar run all d has to do is not have a colossal fuck up he cant pass on them when theyre doing their jobs
my heart cant handle steelers football
why not have someone at fb there
how ironic were relying on berry to help us win this game
queen can ball
ooof

do not go for it
here comes the fake
59 seconds please
thank you based berry
im predicting lamar jackson throws another int
why wont we use a fb i know watt is out but use someone else
here comes the prevent
im not at all confident in our defense right now to not give up big plays last linute against the butterflies
nice
interception incoming
what a way to sweat my steelers ml
fuck man
ok 1 stop down 3 more to go
tell me thats not grounding
well tomlin just caught a fine
our 2 minute d is not solid fuck
none of this prevent shit
let them have those
come on guys
my poor heart

cmon
this is fucking insane
no time to respond

omg heartattack
lets gooooo
what a game
steelers win
holy shit my poor heart
lets goooo lets fucking gooo
holy shit
what the fuck
lets go 70
my heart is still racing
we get it modelo you want us to vote blue
hopefully its just drama queen ben and this isnt a career ending reinjury

fucking horse shit fucking piece of shit call fuck these fucking retard refs
bad penalty but it was technically a penalty dont want it called dont do it obviously it was on heyward and not fitzpatrick either way i dont think ive ever seen a less impressive touchdown drive i still think we are in the driver seat and the ravens have shown me next to nothing on offense i still dont like the fact that we folded even if that were a terrible call lets see so far im surprise by how jackson looks so unimpressive

for those of you who know me i miss most of last year not just football but life it was months on end in the hospital so i never got subjected to the lamar jackson hype this is really the first time taking a good look at him and i dont know what everyones talking about yet
okay keith butler can you stop telling the olbs to always go after lamar they are getting 46 yards per rush
if we have to put rudolph in i stg


we shouldve went and god jameis
fire keith butler man
this is fucking pathetic play by this team they look like they dont deserve to be 60 last week was significant theyre lucky to have won that game and i dont care who here wants to debate it
bens deep ball is horrible imma be honest like its not even in the same area code as these receivers
217 incoming man ben looks like a guy on the last season of his career last week he looked like he was in his prime
ive been saying to trade for a backup qb but the homers here didnt want to hear it
hayward is stupid lamar is like 8 yards from a first down and minkah is pushing him out and here comes cam body slamming into the pile
pathetic those were gifted points shouldve punted already cam better make up for that penalty
we missed bush big time that drive spillane is so slow
at least our qb isnt as ugly as lamar jackson
were literally 10 minutes in and these fucking retarded ass refs have already gifted the ravens a touchdown and a fumble recovery
thank you tuitt
does tony romo ever say anything positive about the steelers the dude is a dick
yall are crazy lolol last time im ever coming here its a fucking touchdown jesus christ

is ben trying to make excuses already
can the refs at least put some lube on before fucking us
i think all of us knew going in we were going to lose just by how many was the question
dobbins should have never gotten out of bounds clock stoppage if you willfully go backwards to get out clock runs
randy fichtner needs to fucking go i put this performance on him and ben
so we really are a fraud

edit didnt think i need to put a s
that was the worst defense ive ever seen us play in the last five years
just let them score now defense will not win the game
thats why you run on second down fuckkkk
spillane looked slow as shit but a pick that bad it doesnt matter
heyward and the refs really gave it to them gg
how many times are we gonna let jackson complete passes hes a shit passer lmao
oh were fucked
id say were even on ticky tack calls after that pi
big ben is playing like ass so far
for fuck sake if you need nfl players to tell you to go vote please youre too stupid to vote
by far the most overrated rushing defense in the league we arent good
so early but im so close to turning this off this is justso bad
you all forgot about road ben he just plays worse on the road
if im correct is this the first time weve been down this season
im not having a good time
it should be 217 baltimore easy maybe we needed a game to get back to reality
literally horrible unbelievable
yall really saying bens done right now these game threads are obnoxious
embarrassing first half
haters
lmfaooo edmunds got clocked
that replay didnt make edmunds look too good lol
romo must be heartbroken
shut up romo
folks need to shut up complaining about romo
hes calling the game being played and hes one of the best at it not his fault steelers played like ass most of the game
lets go for it
hate to say it but pool has fumbled quite a few times just got lucky every other time
okwhen do we talk about ben being underwhelming all year
steelers defense is garbage today
once upon a midnight dreary we are never weak nor weary

we will choke these jokers with a trochee till their cheeks are teary

but yall dont hear me all should fear these

well forever be better youll never be near we your team is as eerie as beverly cleary
holy shit devin bush who
thats what happens when you have a rb try and throw the ball
vince covering boykin bruh
linebacker on boykin
they needed a bullshit personal foul penalty definitely not stressed
fucking vince williams again
idc what yall say this is on hayward right now
god i hate refball
classic flacco how the turn tables
dpi i was only holding him a little
fucking hell steelers
need to stop the penalties they cant continue and still win the game
i cant wait until lamar keeps it on a read option and gets murdered
thats our league best defense guys
if we dont pick this up im returning all this scrapple and apple butter i bought
all you fair weather fans go away its raining and windy today dont know how its going to blow but were here for it
hey big ben how about expose these motherfuckers and throw long and accurate
smh bens deep throws are just not it this year
bens deep ball looking like ancient history
beautiful pickup by conner needed that breathing room for big ben to work
come on bennn
i wonder what options there might be next year for qb and then an oc since we wouldnt have to appease the two time
our poor defense man
intentional grounding
man dont put our game in the smaller window to show me a game ive decided not to watch cause i wanna watch this game

wtf every pass should go either juju or chase thats it
hold em for an attempt at three
fucking ate a hit there go the mink
this is starting to look really bad
i cant believe this is 147
lets see how far fucktners playcalling gets us behind before opening up the playbook gives us a loss where we just run out of time
ok dial up a quick 3 and out so we can see the d be tired again cant wait to see this genius play calling
i really just hate anytime romo talks btw such an anti steeler fuck
why is there a penalty its heated on both sides put some warnings out and move on
bye felicia
ejected
we need some hard running
berry about the have his longest punt right into the endzone
great a false start remember when i pointed out this offense couldnt hang
what in the actual fuck is this offense today
offense looks like fucking garbage
ben kinda suck lol
oh god please no dont let ben be injured noooooooo
if we could get a stop on 3rd down id be so happy
if we dont score on our opening drive of the 2nd half were losing this game especially if we go 3 and out
nope
why cant we get stops everyone knows what theyre doing running the ball qb draws and all that bs stack the box and make him throw he cant throw the ballwhat are we doing why is this so frustrating
its a fingertip int
nooo inconplete
of course not why would it be
dont do it refs dont you do it
incomplete
the way he rolled over and had a perfect one hand grip makes me think it should be an interception it wont be though
why tf did we call a timeout
we need the boat
what is going on with our run defense today could it please show up
i understand committing a player to lamar every play but when its that obvious that he handed the ball off come on
theyre moving the ball so easily man
holy fuck keep him inbounds
ok that was a garbage half lets come out and win the second half and well see what happens we need points preferably td on opening drive
not sure but i think this the end of our undefeated season
refs sus
lamar jackson is such a bad qb
will the second half be different

the eight ball says not likely
well at least none of bens passes were that bad
lamar is such a shit qb but everyone tries to praise him as a god because he can run the ball

he cant fucking throw lol
our defense sucks fuck this stupid cry baby sub
ben is washed up
god i hate this limbo of thinking if ben is okay
jaylen samuels really is a waste of reps
nantz is such a pos
nicee
if we dont fumble or throw an interception its at least tied which is more than i expected after the first quarter
wait its pronounced feekner ive been pronouncing it as fickner for two years i feel like such a dick
if we win this game ill be happy
wooooow went to change a diaper and came back to see us in the lead hell ya
is only our side of the field slick
i wish we wouldnt call stupid fucking plays at our own 10
this is how we blew it to the titans and eagles letting your foot off the gas
i for one am disappointed we didnt do a draw play on 3rd and 9
putem to bed buggs
buckle up
tuitt has 8 tackles 3 tfl and 2 sacks hes out here trying to be aaron donald and i love it
wtf
bruh
edmunds is the worst s weve had in a very long time
this secondary is full of talent but plays horribly as a unit
can we trade nelson to the browns that way hed do the steelers some good
another busted coverage wtf brown was wide open
we got very fucking lucky
do the steelers know theyre allowed to cover the middle of the field
i dont trust our offense to do anything
thank god we have the refs on our side today
okay penalties are really helping our offense haha
fuckkkkk just part the seas and let them get 7 we need the clock on our side
around the league

holy shittttt we did it im about to cry dude
ok so i basically turned off the tv at halftime and didnt watch and now we pretty much won lets gooooooo
good game steelers what color ribbon would you like with this gift wrapped win
so if we dont fumble or throw an int the worst that can happen is a safety giving the ball right back to us
you run the ball but you cant make it so easy to predict where its going
berry due for a shank after some solid balls but lets see if he can pull out some secret kicking magic from down unda
fake it
connor is kinda doodoo
thats way too soft defense right there
this is why i dont like giving old guys alot of money
lets fucking gooooo
lets goo
fuck yes
easy game
removed
oh ofcourse im playing like shit let me rub my elbow and blame it on that
harbaugh is good at proving hes the best coach in the division

hopefully some different team comes out next half
minkah blows
at least were blowing it now rather than up 277
indisputably the worst secondary in the entire nfl
cam going for an oscar
wow ben is garbage bruh
i dont think the steelers are an elite team to be perfectly honest
how the fuck are these commentators employed theyre fucking justifying the behavior of the ravens and what he didwell hes just trying to get away from being wrapped up face palm not once did they say how it was shitty to come in as the 3rd man and grab the offensive player not once did they denounce the play just justify the garbage the nfl is a joke
this is all on hayward
our coaching fucking sucks what is this gameplan bruh
heyward penalty is really gonna cost us the game
only shot 26 3s a game not exactly a big sample size also yeah he is limited athletically he isnt that fast in bursts its why his defense is a massive issue he struggles to move from the post to the perimeter athleticism isnt just jumping
aside from only lucky pick six our defense cant stop lama
defense is going to be gassed soon essentially a 4 and out otherwise theyve been on the field 8m so far

damn lamar really is goated he took that hit like it was nothing gotta tip your hat

ben sucks rn
question to anyone who thinks this offense is better than the one of the past few years with bell and ab what are you smoking
i hope im wrong but i think the train stops today guys
thats a catch fuck you

score is honestly favorable to us
buggs is gonna be the one to sit on burrows leg calling it now
we dont need a coverage lb right

this drive is on heyward

we should start thinking about drafting a new qb
bullshit call but the standards for a pick will always be higher than a catch
that was clearly an interception but ok
thanks hayward for that useless body slam really helping your team out there
being thoroughly out coached
they tell you to vote until they hear who youre voting for we live in a society
nearly lost to the titans and playing losing football against the ravens doesnt bode well for a postseason run look more like a one and done team against good units
i honestly dont know how butler still is employed
that call is justified cam came in too hot calm down boys
minkah looked like he was out of position good play by them unfortunately
better settle your shit down cam
very stupid heyward
nice vince williams and spillane burned for big plays

thanks keith
wait are you guys really thinking that was a bad late hit call jackson wasnt even moving i have no clue what heyward was thinking
ben with the flacco special lol
straight embarrassing
bruh connor playing so shook rn
man i hope tony romo loses his ability to speak
oof thatll rustle your jimmies
they are far better them then us to be honest right now
were getting ass fucked this game should be 217 ben needs to pull a drive together and give the defense a break
cam and ddc costing us 10 pts wtf
this o line is terrible
yeahhh i think were toast
and they fucking convert awesome
on god lamar is just toying with us lol
guess i did good starting the ravens defense in fantasy today

ah those silly steelers gave me a glimpse of a hope those bastards
bruh ben is hot trash today

edit this did not age well
ben has no killer instinct today its over if the ravens score here
stop crying for penalties our doofus qb trying to play hero ball throwing the ball 30 yards on third down probably trying to prove some writer or fan wrong who doubted his arm in the offseason
its actually dumb how shit our offense is
this defense fucking sucks tackle the motherfucker
we need tyson back or some kind of depth we need a speedy lb and we need to fire keith butler like yesterday
i feel like year in and year out the ravens always beat us on the ground
thatll be game wow


we all knew going into this game who the better team was im surprised its still this close tbh
bens arm has looked sus all season so im not sure im too surprised the opposing teams have been mostly ass



if you needed evidence that were not actual contenders re watch the first half running on 3rd and 10 says it fucking all
lots of complaints about the refs here take off the homer glasses thar was a good call and a stupid ass move by heyward wed expect the penalty if that happened to ben as well
jesus christ can he hold onto the fucking ball


lol at ben taking up 25 of our cap
fuck you refs
i guess we were just playing trash teams
its not so much the fact were playing like shit thats pissing home off its the fact that tomlin fichtner and ben probably all think their game plan is working and wont adjust anything in the second half
fire keith butler already for fucks sake communication errors are unacceptable
that was def unnecessary roughness idk what u guys r saying
well this is about to end the whole damn season
earl thomas is no longer here lets put rudolph in
lol this d is so overrated
the ravens are just better than us without big plays we wont be them
when it comes down to it only quality team weve beaten this year is cleveland tennessee is showing today that they were not nearly as good as the 50 start suggested cleveland is good but they are also young and still have a ways to go to be contenders so im not hanging my hat on that one too much

dont get me wrong im not saying were shit but our inability to move the ball on offense is showing me that whatever the record might say we are not in that kcbaltimore upperechelon of the afc

stfu antonio romo you sparkly cow girl fuck
our defense is so ass man
outside of the first defensive drive this has been pretty yikes so far lol
wow we suck today huh
the ravens season died in one quarter lmao
harbaugh owns tomlin i dont know why i keep convincing myself we will beat them
this team is a joke today man fuck
center of field minkah fitzpatrick sucks
fuck that was a td
td
our defense is pathetic lmao flashback to 2017
lmaoooo fix is in
we fucking suck man
all your down votes cant take away the fact that ben hasnt thrown a ball today like a pro

sadly we have ben for next year as well
why did we put a linebacker on a wr
why the fuck is vince williams covering receivers
ebron with the dropsies again
flacco special
compensation maybe
ugh come on boys
this is the worst vince williams has ever played
i dont get hype at all when ben throws a deep ball smh
cmon connor thought you were getting your juju back
is hodges at qb
imagine literally giving up on this game by running on 3rd and 10
it aint steelers ravens unless somebody gets carted off
what happened to our vaunted run d
our injuries man
nice job haden diving for the legs just wrap up son fuck
yeah so our defense cant stop the run that was the ugliest drive against the run ive seen all season consistent pounding and pounding and not a response in sight

with the offense doing absolutely nothing something has to drastically change to win this game
wait when did he contact an official

ehhhh i dont think that was a good call

edit i guess he did but it wasnt really on purpose i thought he shoved him or something
this offense is miserable
how about we give hobbs a shot to
mix it up with running
this thread haden didnt make that circus catch hes washed up cant believe they even let him on the field
i could go either way he definitely had it gripped in his right hand but the ground was likely a factor in his control
where is cam heyward
late hit again
we look like the cupcake team facing alabama
this is fucking pitiful i just dont even know what to say
you can clearly see the blocks happening for lamar we just need a half time break to recuperate
64 yards of offense bad

defense getting worked over foe the most part 164 rush against 3 third dow conversions in that drive bad

only what 6 plays in the ravens end bad

where do we draw optimism from
watching jordan berry makes me want to kms
im happy i started ebron in fantasy today
get rid of it ben
dammit
pls conner dont fumble
buggsy yeah
lets go buggsys now lets get off the field on 3rd down
lmao holy fucking shit defense
welp goodbye undefeated season
fuck mondeaux
hahahahahahah just give them 7
tomlining
do they want to win

jackson is a monster
three blown coverages gives them the lead cant say for sure who was at fault for two of them edmunds pretty clearly at fault for the 3rd and 15 but spillane williams edmunds fitzpatrick and sutton need to get things sorted out

hopefully offense can give them a long drive so that they can take a look at it
terrible towel is waving high
no one has scored 30 on this defense right would be a huge less if they dis
jesus just let em score
so are they kicking a fg or going for it
give it to connor
conner is so soft
lol a minute left for this offense rip
decent field position for baltimore
im gonna take the ball out of my star qbs hands and have my swiss cheese d win it
our defense is fucking useless bro
ravens will end up with 15 seconds here watch
lets go
great finish to the weekend
holy shit
make more tiktok clay pool
couldve had a chance to start 140 but nfl players like cameron have to put on their low iq demonstrations week in and week out
they are clearly so much better than us we dont belong
this game is lost you just have that feeling
we expect more from a veteran leader like heyward
why have replay that right hand has it the whole time
god damn it sure looked like ben wishes he had just retired
the ravens have a huge coaching advantage on both sides of the ball and hc
i hate to fucking say it but we need to get kepernick if ben is out long term
being frustrated at their offense

steelers ravens

i come in peace
anyone still wanna act like this team doesnt look like shit
good thing we are trailing at halftime to another really good team before the deadline we have time to unload the whole team for picks seasons over

ben isnt the answer he looks terrible as usual but the fans still back him
claypool hitting the rookie wall now
this wr group cant hold onto the fucking ball to save their life garbage

oof looks like the rats are the far superior team
tomlins steelers defense always ultimately exposed

romo is fucking ass

this team fucking blows
ugh defense letting up too many big plays this season
before the edmunds haters show up lets gamble and put a ss on a wr1 1 without any help and the pass rush not quite get there in time

in shortgreat passtd was earned good for them lets fucking fight back
well im about as mad at cam as ive ever been lol hes earned ia pass but that fucked over our advantage so badly
fuck cbs in southern california for not airing this game
our defense really getting waxed
removed
going about as wellnas expected smfh
that is control
doesnt move
have they changed the rule on dpi challenges or did tomlin just not want to challenge
had to shut off game once the steelers went 1st and then 3 and out what happened
defense is gassed chasing around this wr acting like a qb and three running backs their offense is fucking gimmick bullshit
just let them score and lets go 2 minute drill
i think we should re evaluate this entire organization if we lose this game sure ill always bleed yellow but if we lose to some washed up ravens in our division game we should reconsider this fucking coaching staff and team
removed
thanks decastro you fat fuck
ravens have the best secondary in the league they make a lot of offenses not named kansas city anemic
credit that td to cam heyward
hope hes out for the game and back for the next
this team simply cannot hang with the ravens
is there any chance we can dangle money in front of dak or are we broke and stuck with the two time and his boy randy next year too
ok we look like the bengals now

who tf j balvin
absolutely fucking trash defense
this defense cant keep up our offense cant move

gg this season is a bust without bush
conner isnt the guy
tomlin gotta go
wheres mason
fuck cam heyward

damn a gift heyward gotta clean that shit up minkah had him wrapped up clean refs called it right tho
this team is garbage
is juju worth a new contract
their defense is clearly better than ours their offense is clearly better than ours their special teams is better

this team cannot hang we need to try to rebuild something new

yeah this game is pretty much over playing like last years team on offense
lets re evaluate if tomlin is a good coach or not if he loses this game im just saying
removed

cut that fucking defender who did the late hit why is he on our team fuck him i hope he gets corona

tomlin has got to go if he loses this fucking game i swear to god hes on the hot seat
gifted that win by the refs at the end


those numbers are dropping after this game unfortunately
im watching pregame and they just said the ravens had the number one defense in the leaguewho is lying
i said another steel curtain era is emerging i hope they keep it up
i dont need this during no nut november
one word trudat
az checkin in lets gooo
our secondary needs to improve tbh
probably not anymore
dont post this kind of stuff b4 a game
the off is taking a day off so far

are you from the future
well done nathan
hmmm what do you know
your buddy should do my bets for me
i dont want to have to take my laptop to my bfs man cavegarageshop cuz its raining off and on
506sportscom has coverage maps
nflbitecom
hey all dont have xm or sunday ticket this year and i gotta work this afternoon is there any way to stream audio of the game through my phone im in ny so i dont know if thatll be an obstacle or not and tv stations here wont show the steelers play because the bills are on at the same time

go steelers
i usually go to the steelers website in chrome open the page as a desktop page and stream radio through there
go grab yourself the iheartradio app and try for a local pittsburgh broadcast theres a few i think

edit nvm sorry iheartradio doesnt have the rights
nflbitecom stream it

steelers app has a radio broadcast
wyle in pittsburgh is great they broadcast the games during the week check out wdve from pittsburgh for lots of info and talk on the steelers thru the whole week you can get both channels audio on iheart radio wyle gives it live and theyre a few seconds ahead of the game on tv for live streaming to watch ive become fond of sportsurge i know nflbite is good but for some reason ive had issues with it


when i see things like this i just like the thought that a ravens fan actually purchased a terrible towel like they googled it put in the credit card info and clicked order to get the iconic emblem of their rival
a good omen for us but it is pretty funny you gotta admit

ok ben i am ready kick those ratbirds in the ass
not necessary burned on the field
chinese knock off jersey
tubbo
do it
yes please
what platform do you recommend to watch the game when it isnt broadcast locally
nflbitecom
im using nflbitecom in nyc
steelers app
sportsurge always seems to work well for us

olines gotta have a big game against campbell and ngakoue

pretty sure they only get 1 game this weekend not sure why but chargers need to be broadcast bc theyre the local team
i missed the pick 6 cause theyre not showing a game its weird that they arent showing one of probably a half dozen games that they have on right now
the real crime is that this wasnt the sunday night game over the raging dumpster fire of an nfc east showdown
because the rams have a morning game only that game can be broadcast regardless of network
anyone found a way to watch theres a stream link for vlc in the about of this subreddit but it doesnt work at least on android
no bodys gonna mention that shape in east texas someone drawing the map got away with some shit

good thing you werent watching rex ryan on espn sunday countdown
we spanked his ass more than the ravens did back in the day hes still just a little sore about it

dude has absolutely stepped up in that role last week he shut down henry at the goal line and has this gem today next man up

hate to see it likely a broken ankle
i was making those noises when somebody got hurt and you feel it and my mom came to my room and asked if im ok
sad to see but theres 100 million reasons that suggest hes gonna be ok regardless
speedy fuck that take a nice slow long careful time recovering no financial incentive to do anything else already got paid the longer he drags it out the worse it is for the shitbirds you dont want to see the injury but that ship has already sailed now that its happened i want to see maximum damage to the franchise as a result

this was worth its own post
doesnt look like ben has any plans on showing up this first half guess theyre leaving it to connor today
fair enough but it looks like the offense is trying to shake the analytics

i am no expert but why does our defense look so hesitant with trying to stop run today why was tj yelling at keith
you have to gameplan to stop lamars legs so that will leave gaps open
alualu has been out since the first drive i think teams were averaging barely 1 yard per carry when he was on the field
defense is the only thing functioning today they cant carry the entire game
gassed out
theyre running straight up the gut lamar doesnt even seem to be reading the option just handing it off up the gut our d is spread out to defend the option ravens are pounding up the middle with alualu out and a big body on spillane vince has been scraping outside for most of the 1st half i assume hes been aside to take away off tackle and to cap lamar to the outside bud tj are keying lamar on each run too which also takes them away from pinching inside

like juddysteel says maybe its time to crowd the box more with the safeties and risk passes being completed in the seams and also lamar keeping and taking it wide

lets see what adjustments are made but usually butler doesnt really do too much adjusting on the fly he just wants guys to execute to solve problems
we need to come out of half with a long drive for a td bud and tj need to get back to hit lamar on every single read option and we will be right back into the game
i think the real issue is we need to bring the safeties up more lamar doesnt have the time to throw deep balls if we bring the dbacks up then lamar cant get rid of it quick allowing more big plays for the defense
theyre waiting to see if lamar handed off the ball or kept it they need to just attack and trust that the other guys in d will do their job
its because you cant sell out on following the running back or lamar because both can take it for a run so our defense hesitates trying to read which one has the ball this is why baltimore won so many games last year it confuses the hell out of defenses
last time a watt was yelling at his coach he got fired maybe butlers gone s
the dline is so fatigued we need ben to get on and stay on
this is a winnable game still we need to get that offense going i agree we need rhythm
story of the game is the ravens d is far theyre playing really well fitchner needs to make some adjustments no defense can be everywhere at once he just needs to find the soft spot ravens o has adjusted nicely with inside power runs to take over the game against what we were doing
tell that to ben who couldnt culminate a dump after eating taco bell right now im getting so pissed why dont we have a qb spy every fucking play to make sure lamar is on his ass and not 20 yards up field sick of this garbage play to your opponent skill shit they are doing garbage as shit better put something together after halftime
no shit

even if we lose spillane has played great so far today
dude a pick six fumble recovery forcing incomplete passes and being there for crucial tackles are just a few of what hes done today id say this deservedly so
bobby spills with a thriller of a pick six
spillane gave his heart and soul out there tonight dudes got my full respect
ahhhh hes not fair spillane train choo choo
love watching him play
spillane is my dad
why did they use a pic form when he was on the titans practice squad lmao
looks like jesse from breaking bad but on steroids
buying a spillane jersey right now this man stood up and helped secure 70 those were big shoes to fill too
thats one hell of a neck
remember everyone cried that he wasnt gonna be good enough and we desperately needed to sign an ilb
imagine the inside duo of devin bush and robert spillane no disrespect to bince but hes getting older
ngl i thought he was a borderlinecamp body bum when he first checked in for bush after he got injured but man am i happy to have been incredibly wrong about that

dude can really ball
ill upvote if we win
probably the best player on the d today imo
he has played well today making the tackle after being beat was huge hes no db but im comfortable with him out there lets go spillane
bob spillane killer b confirmed
the past two games he had one crushing tackle in each including destroying tns rb today interception for a td and a fumble recovery at the end of the game keep seeing mark madden say something negative about him not being able to replace bush maybe he isnt replacing him but hes doing a good job filling in for him
balled out this game
already saving for the jersey
they showed him on the sidelines with one minute left and he was still talking about the pick 6 because he said i was watching myself on the big screen the whole way in
daddy robert
decided i was gonna wait to add a flair until it was a good good fit i will now leave this forever
ayo mark madden hit spillane with the hes slow amd hes white goodbye

eat shitcrow ya jagoff
that should shut down linebacker trade talks
lets make it an award party
put some respeck on sir rob
hes a cheat code
look at that neck what an absolute chad
when can i expect a spillane flair
bush sitting at home like

just kidding but seriously spillane killed it today good for him
rob and minka party
i always find it fascinating when i pop into the game thread and read about how bad spillane sucks and he is always 4 steps behind sometimes i wonder if i am watching the same game than the opinions in that thread
i feel like this guys gonna take binces job in two years
this may not be a popular take but spillane has made more plays in two and a half games than bush did in the first four games i really like this guy
linebacker
hes played very solid filled some big shoes
my boyyyyyy
mad respect for this guy left everything on the field
ol freight train spillane coming in to ruin your day here we goooooooooo
i figured spillane was angling for another first class upgrade with that performance
roboooooooo
bobby got dang spills
when i first saw this guy on the field in week 1 i thought he would be our new resident why is he on the fieldguy but he has definitely earned his spot and will hopefully be wreaking havoc next to bush for many years
dont know football just saw this while scrolling by but my god the absolute neck gainz on this guy

absolutely corey taylord
hes been so much better than i anticipated
he looks like one of those symmetrical photos you can take in photobooth
im a wait and see kind of guy let him play better teams before i believe in the hype kind of guy i can officially say im a believer now this man balls out
watching him play all i glcould see is him wanting to prove he deserves that job i was pumped
what will mark madden think
him stuffing henry at the goal line is still my favorite play of his
hes from my hometown nickname is robo like the cop would love to see that carry on
lets fucking goo
im in
stud
upowerfuljellyfish1

lol
he has really stepped up hopefully bush is being a good sport about it
dude he went off today
kings in the north
yes sirrrrrrrr
spillane has killed it for us dudes a stud and earned his first class spot pick six yea big stops yea
spillane runningbacks all over the field
would you think he might make bince expendable in the offseason hes a hell of a lot cheaper and it may allow us to keep dupree
looks like trt abuse
hes a great addition i hope he gets a long term deal in the offseason
kid is working his ass off got exposed on a few plays but he has more positive plays than negative and thats all you can ask for
do you think bush has to worry about his starter spot next year
dumptruck
motherfucker better be flying the plane home this week
dudes face looks like its one side mirrored
fuck him
removed
no we are not playing well
in the ravens subreddit they are saying the opposite lol
romo is great and hypes teams that play well he was slobbing us for the browns annihilation two weeks ago
oh no the national commentators dont love the steelers as much as i do this sub every single weekend

seriously who the fuck cares if it bothers you mute your tv and turn on a radio broadcast of it
no not at all


love homemade primantis with kielbasa and hot sauce toss an egg on there hoooo
your mom the is the mvp that looks tasty af
random story but during the steelerspackers super bowl my dad made them but severely overlooked the fries and they were very dry to this day he brings it up as a disappointment but i still enjoyed them
thanks mom
you must be in california
alright im jealous of this

my bf has always kept his in his toolbox in his garage last year mice nibbled at the corner of it i hope he didnt trash the whole thing and throw it away one does not simply throw away a myron cope terrible towel

hahahaha beat me to it 7 wins to start 7 trophies at the end of postseason lets freaking goooooooooo
i loved this game we had blood grass mud on our jerseys that is my team grandma is so proud of our fight
but we still havent beat any good teams
it came at a cost

heal up heyward
will never not upvote this image
if we continue to win we need that tomlin headbandconvertedfacemask in canton

edit post win shock poor grammar
fuckin slugfest but we held on and now 70

fuck your 4pt underdog vegas
so are the ravens a bad team now or are the steelers finally good
i will never get tired of the smug tomlin face
e n c r o a c h m e n t
rat birds shit pigeons call em what you want but i call them the baltimore football team undeserving of a mascot 70 motha fuckaaassss
as a ravens fan what a game well played steelers too many mistakes on our end

see you on thanksgiving
i failed no nut november to this game
another heart attack but its another win
lets go steelers
someone called them bitch pigeons the other day and ive stuck with it since
these last two weeks have taken years off me my heart rate hit 200 during baltimores final drive

totally okay with it
after ebron td i saw lamar beat his chest like im here dont worry boys i said to myself we are gonna win this shit now we have to face all the good teams around since apparently we have only played crap

but damn heyward at the end
crazy game hats off to the coaching staff for the halftime adjustments
lamar sees this face before he gets sacked by our front seven
last week we badly outplayed tennessee and turnovers almost killed us this week we get badly outplayed and turnovers bailed us out you could tell baltimore was coming off a bye week ready to play
i see the photo i upvote and go about my day
today is a good day

though the offence left serious questions and almost gave it up that last drive defence did really well considering the firepower the ravens have is pretty stacked

get a first down ice the game fail to do this see the ball back in ravens hands i mean wtf guys that was sloppy af

nevertheless the team showed immense resolve to come back from behind on the road to snag the win takes guts to tough it out and with them its always a slog but the wins are so much sweeter for it kings of the north 70 onto the next one
yeah but no respect next week for rankings probably still 3 because they will excuses like they allowed the ravens to rush so much or they allowed two big passes or whatever
i will never not upvote this picture
dear god i hope you guys win the super bowl
this picture has never not made me laugh
like the one good thing about 2020
they havent beat anyone good
i am still scared of kc
based
shakes ativan bottle

running low
been wearing this face since the end of the game wife kicked me out of the house because im so happy fuck the rat birds
ill allow it
lets fucking gooooooooooo
literally came here for this
while is was not pretty it doesnt have to be in the nfl one thing matterswins the steelers have had 7 opportunities and they have 7 wins period ill take em any way we get em

a wins is a win 70
ravens complaining about penalties which i dont understand there may have been 1 or 2 bad pi calls but they were iffy other than that i didnt see any other sketchy calls thoughts
stairway to seven
all this after a bye week well done win on the road
i swear to christ this picture never gets old
ravens did amazing and wouldve beat the steelers if lamar jackson didnt throw so many damn pics

steelers were always going to get charged that timeout utterly disgusting and the fans at the game should be ashamed
theyre ratbirds fans what do you expect
i said are they really booing and injured player how new england of them
he hurt his knee on the last series so its not a surprise that that same knee is still hurt
to be expected in baltimore fans are classless at best
classless baltimore
it seemed like it was a small amount compared to how loud they were earlier youll have those fans but it ill give baltimore the benefit of the doubt
literally saved the ravens 2 seconds idk why they were mad
its kevin durant all over again
worst part is he would have been doing them a favor by faking an injury steelers wanted the clock to run or you know tomlin couldve called timeout its not like we were losing and out of timeouts

not just bad form but terrible understanding of the rules and strategy of football i would hope such a limited crowd would filter out the casual fans with low football iq
1 there are classless fans in every fanbase yinzers do stupid shit every year too i agree it is classless if it was targeted at cam tho

2 i can understand the rational of an emotional fan in a tense game booing when players fake injuries to take advantage of the clock all of the time in professional sports some are even taught to do it that wasnt the case here obviously but audiences get way less info in the stadium than we do at home they might not have realized he was struggling before
i got downvoted in the rnfl thread for making this exact comment
they thought he was faking to slow down the tempo i guarantee that boo happens in every nfl stadium
tbf i think that they thought he was pulling some bullshit to mess with the clock as nfl teams have been guilty of in the past i dont think they were booing him because he was cam heyward injured steeler but i could be wrong
shithole fanbase for a shithole franchise
they probably wanted the refs to call offsides for him being behind the line when baltimore snapped should have been a 5 yd penalty and free walk into the endzone
ah they stopped once they realized he was hurt and not gassedpretending
like i commented earlier about what i heard on the radio a flock of crows is called a murder a flock of ravens is called an unkindness that was definitely an unkindness on that flock of ravens fans
they thought he was momentum stopping
im assuming they were blaming the refs for the decision to not add time on the clock and the refs not taking so long
they could have been upset that he ruined the momentum they had just gained still no reason to boom him as he is being helped off the field by two teammates
shitbird fans do it best
its baltimore one time a guy was snorting meth in the stands
faking is not something cam would do and it did them a favor gave them a time out and an additional 40 seconds to pick a play
it was classless and clearly he wasnt faking to disrupt their rhythm the steelers had nothing to gain from spending a timeout there when they want the ravens to have less time on the clock and one less down and we would rather have cam on the field for that last play than his backup every time
i think this is an overreaction fans at the game dont have the same information as the tv viewers i dont think they were booing him because he was injuredfaking there are a number of reasons they could be booing because they didnt know what was going on once a few start booing everybody does even if they dont know what they are booing for

we won who cares
wouldnt expect less from the ratbirds aka shitbirds

ha at first i thought the 0 was a roll of tp
see ya on thanksgiving for seconds ratbirds
the amount of rat bird fans complaing about the refs is so funny maybe if lamar could trow the ball then those calls wouldnt of been so consequential

lol not a chance there a few bad calls each way worst call i saw was the 15 yardunnecessary roughness on minkah in the first quarter jackson was inbounds with no whistle and heyward pushed him and jackson out of bounds i have no clue how they called 39 for a penalty that was on a 3rd down stop to keep the drive alive
bitch pigeons just couldnt cover claypool if they didnt take those pis they were all going further lol
does anybody have the clip of lamar jackson missing a wide open mark andrews by a mile in the 4th imma need that for future petty endeavors
i mean if the ravens werent horny for committing pass interference then it would have been out receivers that bailed us out

now they get a shitty team next week thats its own challenge
i loved the last dance so much it was just jordan being like this random ass dude slighted me so i decided that we would win
lets fucking go
this might be one of the biggest wins in the past few years because it tucks the division safely away for the time being and puts us in the playoffs drivers seat which i dont remember the last time we occupied late in season
its just the giants

its just the broncos

its just the texans

its just the eagles

its just the browns

its just the titans

its just the ravens we are here

its just the cowboys

its just the bengals

its just the jaguars

its just the ravens again

its just the redskins

its just the bills

its just the bengals again

its just the colts


its just the browns again

its just the lowestseeded team in the afc playoffs

its just a team in the afccg that lucked out into being there

their undefeated season has an asterisk and they didnt play anyone good all year
its been the shitty teams what has always been the pain fortunately we survived the giants on week 1
whos the good team we beat
ravens did amazing and wouldve beat the steelers if lamar jackson didnt throw so many damn pics

didnt get to see the game because i live in ca but foook yeahhhh
charlie what u doing in muh steelers reddit
charlie in the steelers subreddit lets go

we should sign that lamar kid from baltimore looks like a good rb and could also come in for some gadget plays
he has a high fumble risk tho
not bad for a running back
looks like hes droppin the ball a lot
remember leveon wanting to get paid like a wide receiver with this guys rushing numbers hell probably want to get paid like a quarterback

straight cheesin

must be nice to have good dental coverage
saw that


if theres any reason to wanna be rich just look at those teeth

he has good teeth
go steelers
when you realize lamar is going to run it with 8 seconds left
ravens did amazing and wouldve beat the steelers if lamar jackson didnt throw so many damn pics
this clown gave up some massive plays over the middle today fooled and third and fourteen and second and twenty two by willie fucking snead

hail to the king baby
ah king of the north
yes
arise

duke of ellington

count of basie

earl of hines

cab of calloway
yes now it is appropriate to celebrate being first in the north 2game lead half games dont matter with a headtohead left to play with bal in the bag as a win feels like much less hubris than posting it last week
of course this should be posted after every win over the ravens
i know were undefeated and all but idk how much more my heart can take watching them in the last 5 seconds of a game thats the third near heart attack ive had this season
youre sposed to be able to feel your heartbeat in your spine right
yeah me and the old man say the same we need shock paddles installed downstairs
before the game i was 24 years younger than my father now we look the same age thats what this team is doing to me this season my beard is turning gray and my widows peak is getting worse every week
i am still trying to find my heart in my stomach as we speak
its so exciting and i love every second of it
third dude ive had a near heart attack for every game expect the blowout
i have a wheelchair i sit in i dont need itmy bfs son found it in the trash i sit in it out in the garage with my bf to watch the games cuz its comfy today i thought i was really gonna need it lordyat least it was easy to wheel over the the fridge lol
if i can put up with covid risk for seven months i can put up with three hours a week of steelersinduced heart palpitations

i will say it until he truly proves me wrong if you make him throw it they will lose hes an incredibly gifted athlete but the guy cannot win with his arm the chargers and titans have proven this in the playoffs the chiefs have shown this in the regular season if he becomes a better passer he can be great until then he will win some regular season games but he wont get far in january
mr jackson is a great athlete and a true sportsman a good person of character i really admire this kid im happy the steelers have figured out how to beat him if he stays healthy hes going to get better as a passer and that will be bad news for the afc right now hes trying to do it all himself and the coaches are letting him do that because hes an amazing talent
big truzz
the steelers havent beaten anyone good

beats undefeated titans

beats ravens in baltimore
had the game in his hands at the end


twice
it was the refs
big truss
butter fingers

ah man

felt like a playoff game in the 2nd half excellent battle

i got the potatoes
gg prayers up to the big bopper ronnie stanley
great game man cant wait to see yall again in a few weeks
i can wait to see you again i dont need another heart attack
we aint miss on the king
its all in the game baby
its not a steelers v ravens game if it doesnt come down to the wire
this is actually pretty damn funny
best rivalry in football and it isnt steelers vs ravens if it doesnt come down to the wire see you in a few weeks


people in this sub were saying we were lucky if wed win one game fake fans i tell ya idc if these games were close we played mostly consistent football since the beginning of the season



damn haha i kinda liked those videos glad that he has no reason to make them though haha
his videos were lame just said topical things in a funny voice days of our steelers was the only good thing because he was a fan
hello rsteelers

here is the link for the week 9 reddit nfl picks the top 10 from this week and the link for next week will be announced on wednesday no more picks can be made after 1000 pm on saturday night good luck


hello everyone

the week 9 leaderboard is out i will post the week 10 link on tuesday or wednesday go to

to see everything
cooper rush garrett gilbert do not instill a lot of fear that being said i was at hines field week 14 december 8 2002 vs the houston texans when we lost 246 i will carry that emotional scarring with me forever 2 pick sixes and a fumble scoop score texans had 47 total yards the stillers had 422 we need to take care of the ball if we do not beat ourselves we go 80 for the first time in stillers history
report today is that ezekiel elliot is pussing out of practice hell probably half ass it on sunday too thats why the cowboys always suck under expectations theyre a bunch of soft front running bitches jerry jones does not know how to create a winning atmosphere he thinks its all about him and what he can buy who he can sweet talk who he can bully who he can blame jerry confusing himself with what jimmy johnson was able to accomplish for him is the biggest joke in the nfl
valid concern its the nfl not college level playing field salary cap etc that said it would take some monumental fluke occurrences there is a reason why 135 underdogs dont win straight up very often i expect them to cover and win by 20 but its not hard to envision a garbage td ruining them spread
yeah but we have ben at qb now and an elite defense
havent won in dallas since 2004
lost a super bowl in this stadium
head coach is guy who beat us
underperforming against shit teams in recent years
if we want to be elite and be looked and taken as super bowl contenders we have to dominate this game
glad im not the only one very worried about this game and the steelers habits of playing down to bad opponents

so does that mean that cam is playing then

edit and what about buggs
if vance got the covid from the ravens ima be pissed

damn bat eating ratbirds
on the bright side this is the perfect week for anyone to be missing as much as we suck against historically bad teams this feels beyond impossible to lose
if vance is out it means i get to see some action from my hometown dude zach gentry
ill be happy if buggs can play would really not want to see mondeaux out there full time
these are all huge guysdamn
i hope we can essentially treat this as a week we can rest our injured guys playing the nfc east is huge for us this year since we had our bye week way too early
perfectly fine with this no disrespect to the cowboys not really but we should beat them handily without these two need those two for the second half stretch so get healthy
ill be surprised if mike hilton plays



my brother said before the draft that we would take watt and i was like nah he is just a name there is no way he can be anywhere as good as his brother we wont take him

never been so happy to be wrong in my life
taco charlton
i dont know if im happier hes a steeler or that hes not a cowboy lol
i was kinda hoping wed draft an actually good corner that year but i was still satisfied with watt at the time and excited for his potential now hes an irreplaceable star on this team and a very close second place for my favorite player on the team behind minkah

can you shop a mask on there too the man has paid enough
uh oh king george iii lost in the end though if the steelers dont win the super bowl this year i blame you

no wonder they aint finished counting yet fuckers eating a whole banquet hope the other states give the counters food aswell
thats cool
superrrrr late repost
so i live like 2 miles away from att stadium in arlington tx and regardless of how their season is going cowboys fans are still talking like theyre gonna blow us out this sunday and theyre still the best team in the league i mean whats new anyway i really hope this isnt one of those trap games and we shut them up even before the first quarter ends
howdy im a pittsburgh native living in san antonio and a few of my coworkers are already trying to place nomoney bets with the cowboys victory

but you know8 0 coming
i live in baltimore trust me its not fun loving the steelers here
i live in dfw and all my coworkers are saying the cowboys are going to get worked and if its bad enough they are going to stop watching at halftime
i live in fw i havent heard a single cowboys fan that is confident heading into sunday
i feel your pain i am just down the road in fort worth i hear the same things
if any 2 fans are interested in going to the game and sitting in the boonies please pm me it is cheaper to buy tickets in packs of 4
eh look up cowboys forum on google most are saying we are gonna blow them out

yeah the diehards in person are just trying to convince themselves i dont know lol


does he really have a 99 carrying rating in madden christ im glad i didnt get it this year
have you guys noticed that these young qbs refuse to be sacked and will try stupid things to do so
this is actually kinda funny jackson really stunk up the joint last weekend
the more i think about it the more i think the steelers defense won the game everyone was talking about how lj gave us the game but if the steelers didnt have their defensive presence he wouldnt make the mistakes

the steelers defense capitalized on qb and offensive flaws to help us get the w so the steelers d won the game for us
reminds me of a tweet i saw with video the text of the tweet was baker mayfields stats with a bunch of flame emojis the stats were awful and the video was him dancing in the endzone and the audio was clown music lmao
lamar jackson dpoy its not even close
someone post this in rravens
madden curse strikes again
lamar is really really good at avoiding big hits besides the tuitt sack his biggest pop was running into his own guys ass
man he was really bad last week
lamar woke up feeling dangerous
bahahahah
i live in baltimore it was glorious out at the bar for this one
usavethisvideo
uvredditdownloader
song name
represent
that man is clutch
now set it to yackety sax
the madden curse is alive and well
i love lamar but are defense is better
quality shitpost
they should try a punter or wideout at qb you never know
man this is such a massive roast i love it
stop theyre already dead
bro steelers fan here idc what anyone says lamar is a quality qb i have always believed that why all the bashing
killin it here we go

great edit
it didnt take the league long to figure the ol cromagnon man out
ive seriously never seen fans puff their chest after win like this before my god lol get yalls shit off though im nowhere near being a ravens fan either
i obviously know that ab isnt on the steelers any more but he will probably always be mostly known for being a steeler thats why im posting here

anyway what do you guys think of abs legacy as a receiver personally i think he deserves more credit than he gets im pretty confident in my opinion that he is one of the greatest receivers of all time is he the greatest of all time probably not but the argument that he is isnt that crazy is he the best in the last 20 years now were talking i know this opinion is unpopular but i think ab iswas the best receiver of the 2000s but either way i think he should be listed in everyones top 5 but for some reason people dont give ab the credit he deserves when ranking receivers

people forget how dominant ab was and the fact that he virtually showed up every single game since 2013 when he started to play like the real dominant receiver hes known for there were only two seasons where he didnt average over 100 receiving yards per game started obviously not including 2019 and this year brown also has the most consecutive 100 reception seasons with 6 the next most is 4 im willing to bet there are other stats that show how dominant and consistent ab was but thats all i got right now in the end i dont even think someone can rate ab based off of his stats they need to have watched him even highlights will do in order to realize how dominant of a receiver was

meanwhile it seems like most nfl fans cant hide their boner for julio jones nowadays im not even confident that jones is the best receiver right now dont get me wrong hes an elite receiver but hes still overrated i think most people would disagree but i think ab was better than jones when ab still played for the steelers because he was much more dominant and much more consistent at the time on the other hand julio jones was struggling to score during some seasons but i dont know maybe it actually turns out that i have a boner over ab

so i guess my question is where do you rank ab on the best receivers of all time list lets go from there

tldr ab is much better than what he gets credit for even though most people agree that he was a great receiver
if he didnt go batshit crazy and fully played out his career i truly believe that he wouldve been considered at least top 3 alltime and idc what anyone says ab was always better then julio
i hate him lmao but he was on pace to break all types of records but it also has to do with ben throwing the ball i dont think ben gets a lot of credit for what hes done imo
i dont believe this is a hot take at all i thought he was considered a top 5 all time receiver and best of his generation though hopkins and julio arent far behind
i want to say yes but i think he needs a few more years to considered one of the best also just a side not he has never ever played with a bad quarterback that is not saying he isnt an unbelievable talent i am just making a point
ab is by far and away the best offensive skill position player that i have ever seen on the steelers in my 26 year steelers fandom a team whose storied history has 9 offensive hall of famers
i cant wait to beat tb in the super bowl and watch tb and ab fight its going to be magical
no fuck ab

i fucking love coach
looks like this is mostly from the sb xliii season and damn what a good season that was chills watching coach and woodley micd up for that last defensive play
we take this man for granted a lot of the time what a special person we have in mike tomlin and with how young he is we could realistically have him another 20 years just so much passion every game
id go to war for this man
so many good ones in there thank you coach t

roethlisbergers arm looked pretty good on that td pass
offensive coordinator randy fichtner took a different approach

you mean ben telling him to fuck off while he worked his magic

our new qb coach seems to be bringing a lot to the table all those jet sweepmisdirection runs are helping immensely
this is where experience matters amiright brady manning big ben etc give em the reigns and let them read and react to what theyre seeing on the field
you better put some respect on three screen passes in a row then punt randys name
dont forget to give him credit for the fabled 3rd and long rush

so blurry you should have said you painted it

at first i was upset this even had 20 upvotes because its so terrible now i kind of hope it gets upvoted to the top of all time because its so terrible

thank you

when it says video unavailable click watch on youtube

i would love to know why the mods in rnfl  this
but what did he feed them
i had a feeling minkah had a part of it what a classy guy
doing christmas shopping but i am living in the cleveland area converting my brownie girlfriend into a steelers fan i know gods work honestly looking to buy quality steeler jerseys for a lower price

anyone have any good suggestions on where to buy online links appreciated
as a canadian i would also like to know we seriously have the shittiest selection for nfl merch where i live winnipeg we have lids aka jersey city and they only have two players per team for jerseys a few crappy nonnike shirts and like 1 style of sweater then theres another sports store but its legitimate 95 nhl shit nfl shop canada sucks too

i could order from the us version but then im paying 240 for a jersey thats otherwise only 149 so damn frustrating
people gonna hate but ive bought multiple jerseys off of dhgate for like 2030 bucks max and the quality is decent its 100 not on field quality but unless you are a jersey snob who cares for the price just make sure the seller is reliable i can provide pics if needed just dm me

only downside is they are from china so you gotta wait a month or 2 for the jersey to arrive
somewhat related anyone have any good tips getting classic player jerseys i really want a casey hampton but theyre impossible to find


i stumbled across the website searching for a ryan clark jersey i havent pulled the trigger yet but i will soon kinda the same prices but more options

if you want cheap you can try dhgate i have heard mixed reviews but jerseys are like 30 so i suppose you get what you pay for like most things i hope this helps and bless you for converting your girlfriend
ive bought 2 jerseys off this website they look pretty legit pretty happy with what i got ive ordered a big ben color rush and tj watt jersey wwwsteelersplayersshopcom hope this helps
my best friend sells them cheap good quality look him up on facebook brian burden he has some on hand i believe

til playing football is illegal
i dont think this is an actual news item but even if it is that hit was worth way more than the sticker price and his heaviersalaried teammates or probably ownership would never let him pay a cent of this on his own
i thought his shoulder was enough payment
the article cites dale lolley as a source but the link is dead and when i went on his twitter i find no mention of this anywhere i also cant find any mention of this when i had a quick google just now

seems like misinformation to me
reputable source i am not seeing this anywhere else
for what thats the real question
this has to be fake news
the article doesnt really say anything more except he was fined 4000
sounds like fake news q is a steeler fan
did he forget to say sorry
so the nfl is just on a fine the steelers spree huh back on top and here they go with the bullshit again hopefully this is fake tho as the comments are saying that was a clean hit
are you fucking kidding me
thats some bullshit
from that vantage point it looks shoulder to body how is that illegal
come on really it was just two good football players trying to make a play seriously i bet henrys agent complained to the league about this bs
holy crap im excited to see us play on thanksgiving this is going to my favorite holiday of 2020
cooked ratbird is not a substitute for turkey
im naming my turkey lamar in respect of this game

well boys im headed to dallas though technically fort worth this sunday i know every single bar in dallas will be airing our game as much as id love to see some texas tears up close id much rather twirl some terrible towels in the company of the black and gold this week let me know if you know any good bars in the area
this is what i always douse yelp and search for steelers in the city you want then within those results search for steelers in the reviews sometimes youll find if people claim it as a steelers bar

woodys tavern looks like it might be promising
woodys and flips are the two steelers bars in fort worth there are also two fort worth steelers clubs and they both have facebook pages with more details
former keller resident flips off 35w becomes a huuuuuge steelers bar for games watched our thursday night beat down of the titans there a few years ago
i figured everyone would say either the bengals ravens or browns if i just asked for their least favorite team im curious to see what other teams we dislike
patriots their fans are insufferable many of them say im not following football this year cause they are losing
i actually dont hate the ravens tbh theyre a respectable organization

outside of the division though probably the patriots not only cause of brady but their fanbase is the most insufferable bunch ever
dallas sucks
just wherever tm brdy is
besides the patriots who have fizzled since brady left id say the cowboys super bowl xxx was my first football memory and i know a guy in my legacy fantasy league that is a diehard cowboys fan and hes my nemesis so the cowboys
being a steelers fan in new england makes it easy i hate the patriots with the passion of 1000 suns
i still have a sore spot from when green bay beat pittsburgh in the super bowl
new england is the only correct answer here
always hated the broncos
any team that calls themselves americas team
bears i was 17 when i went to the game we lost in chicago and got spat on by a bears fan and since then i fkn hate the bears
houston oilers

chiefs i went to the playoff game where we won off boswell kicking field goals and the fans were so nasty the worst ive encountered
ive disliked the saints for a few years now seem like such a cocky team and then cameron jordans comments on ben sealed it
seattle
im starting to really dislike the titans there fans are awful
how is no one mentioned jacksonville fuck those cunts
seahawks

i live in seattle and their fair weathered fans who know nothing about football but act like every year theyre the best team in the history of the nfl and if they dont win a super bowl its cuz of some outside factor never their fault fuck i hate then
pats but veterans stadium had their own judge in the basement so
patriots double patriots because i live two towns north of foxborough
dallas or new england
the cowboys mostly cause of the fan base in my area
ravens since i live in baltimore but since you said outside the division i would have to say cowboys
hate the ravens with every ounce of my beingoutside the division i would have to say the seahawkstheir fans are the most ignorant and obnoxious group of morons ive encountered
patriots
1 patriots
2 cowboys
3 packers
cowboys and patriots

fuck the cowboys

fuck the patriots

i respect the cowboys

i respect the patriots

but fuck the cowboys

and fuck the patriots
packers rodgers is a smug asshole with a super punchable face
eagles
all the teams
patriots no doubt honourable mention to the cowboys
pats
f da patriots
new england dallas and currently the buccaneers wherever the bandwagoners go that stop watching the games when the teams get bad i hate those fan bases
id personally say the eagles some philly fans are super obnoxious plus i dont like their head coach at all
patriots and cowboys

also a cameo from the greatest steeler qb ever
upcoming boomers ready to attack him for not working out right now

its a whole new experience with that song on
its so much fun seeing them in person my first game at heinz field was also against the bengals i had not known the significance of renegade to the team until then
castine represent
this is amazing i live in the uk and am determined to see the steelers play i love this video x
awesome vid repping bangor area here
have they been doing renegade in the stadium this year with the small percentage of fans
im literally like 20 rows below you in this video it was an awesome game
goals live in indiana and havent been to pittsburgh yet someday
i was at that game two rows from the field it was incredible
i still need to see my first steelers game in person i was planning on going this year until everything went to shit
goosebumps without fail every time
isnt that heinz stadium lucky bastard
im from hawaii and i go to a game every year
i sat in almost the exact same seat for my dads birthday


john conner terminator 2 was an epic movie
more like dan showing how much he knows about football again
same dude who ran out of the back of the end zone without knowing it i dont see why espn lets him break down tape dude doesnt even have the awareness to know where the sidelines are
the jets had a fb named john conner unsurpisingly aka the terminator when dan was playing hes probably having nam style flashbacks
come with me if you want to win
i heard some analyst call ben roethlisbunger
hes on pats show sometimes and i think he has the worst takes while being the biggest douche of all tv

coach t is one of the funniest coaches behind that serious persona for the media

we dont deal with point spreads and things of that nature

this is the way
this will be one of the first times ill really be mad if its close people tend to forget that bad teams are professionals and can compete any sunday but the cowboys are not a bad team the coyboys are hot garbage and an embarrassment stephen a voice
hmmm nah we would definitely let it get to 2820 but then dallas would give up a strip sack or pick we go up 3520 and then the game runs out
i feel like this is gonna be reverse steelers trail 2410 start of the 3rd cut it to 2420 5 minutes to go in 4th defense gets to and steelers score a touchdown to win it 2724

dallas should be an easy game considering their record but somehow this will be drama
anytime steelers are playing and its an ugly game i feel better about their chances of winning like this is the steelers were talking about here i can remember when winning games 9 to 10 was the norm
i had anxiety reading this
this game will not be close
not against this busted ass cowboys team its gonna be a 387 kind of game now at the bengals this could be dead
on
or we just lose too thats a possibility as well
listen i understand the whole playing down the competition narrative but the cowboys are on their 4th starting quarterback
remindme 48 hours
is there another way
just scored 2 tickets for the game tomorrow
steelers will be leading 213 at halftime book it
then you say to yourself i was never worried
not only will the cowboys be on their 4th string qb their defense is also ranked literally dead last in the nfl on paper theres no reason this game should even be close the cowboys suck out loud

we had it bad last season but at least we still had the 6th best d in the league and we never had to find out who came after ben mason duck on the depth chart they must be a special kind of miserable in dallas right now
why even watch the game if youre going to spoil it like this
i predict we lose at least one of the next three all classic trap games
you guys are hilarious this game has the makings of a 533 debacle
i am sorry to hear about your friend and his bad life choices i wish him the best and a speedy recovery however yah he isnt wrong haha
if its seriously that close against this dallas team then we have massive issues i mean i get how we are but shit calling this years cowboys a dumpster fire is a compliment i realy hope we lock it up and blow the doors off them for once
lmao apt very apt
ya know one of these days we wont take our foot off the gas and win by 50 maybe not tomorrow but one day the best
ezekiel elliot with the majority of td or what
ezekiel elliot with the majority of td or what
no joke i literally had a dream last night that we were up 240 and then it became 2423 and we stopped them on 4th down to win the game
this hurts lmao
playing down to competition only to barely escape with a win at the end such is steelers tradition
steeler fans have to live shorter lives right
knowing the steelers ive been nervous for the cowboys but at the same time i feel like were a different team now and wont do that
bruh this is basically a ripoff the titans game anyone can predict this
this team is different we played inferior teams all year up until tennessee and went 50
now that got my heart rate up
so hoping they stop playing down
the cardiac steelers
the cowboys wont even score 10 points they run like a high school offense right now if dak was playing this would be a possibility but they are worse than the jets right now the eagles are dog shit and they covered 105 against them even with wentz playing like shit if we dont win by 20 ill be amazed
probably watches urinatingtree
id say its more dallas gets off to a 140 lead because stagnant offense turnovers and penalties its 176 end of the 3rd quarter 179 5 mins left ben leads a drive and ties it 1717 with 50 secs dallas gets a big kick return and kicks a 46 yd fg to win
i will boo the ravens i think
redzone for me
steelers duh
haha west coast time is weird
seattle and buffalo and colts vs ravens
redzone channel all the way i love when we get an afternoon game and i can just binge the morphine drip of redzone for 3 hours
i have a redzone free preview for the month so im going to make the most of it since i dont like watching ravens games
thats clearly the early game of the day potential afccg preview lets see if the colts can put lamar in a box and make him throw the ball lets see if the ravens can pound phillip rivers and expose him as an old man
west coast living so sleeping in
furiously masturbate until the steelers game
living in indy im forced to watch the colts
colts baltimore so you dont have to change the channel
i am also booing the ravens
im gonna watch redzone
booing the ratbirds

haters will say its fake
just out of curiosity anyone got the numbers ats
yeah but what were the scores in those games i bet all of those wins were something like 3128 and it came down to the wire
and heres how most of those wins come steelers go down by multiple possessions and look like shit against a bad team come 2nd half steelers start slowly coming back and then they make a couple big 4th quarter plays to barely escape with a win yinzers pretend nothing bad ever happened all because we beat a shit tier team
i love tomlin and ive maintained for years now that hes the 2nd best coach in the league to be fair though the narrative isnt just about losing to bad teams it is playing down to bad teams not to mention the narrative was in part born out of the unleash hell in november comment which was in 2009 and thus not part of this
i wonder how many of those wins come from divisional rivals because the steelers take those games more seriously for sure even when the browns and bengals are having a bad year

and to make a good comparison for them playing down to bad teams they tied the browns when playing the hue jackson coached team without mayfield and yet just destroyed the 5 win browns a couple weeks ago the playing down to bad teams thing isnt a myth but it doesnt guarantee a loss either
this isnt whats funny tho im pretty sure i saw that were only like 250 ats when favored by 10 usual steelers heart attack games as pittsburgh dad likes to say
what about when theyre only favored by 9 7 i imagine it gets a lot worse
thats because people know not to favor us by 10 or more points
thats really not the point but ok if tomlin was even 500 against awful teams he wouldnt be coaching

most of the time ben bails tomlin and the steelers out against bad teams and 5 years ago it was ben brown and bell bailing the team out

you can go through the seasons and see how many close games the steelers have had against bad teams the tomlin apologists never cease to amaze me its always some excuse or some cherry picked stat

our offense is a little too good for us to lead the league against the pass should be plenty of garbage time yards for opposing qbs trailing big in second halves this year this isnt a 2008 steeler team situation where the defense had to be on top of its game at all times because our rushing and passing attacks were both below league average this defense will get to play just keep it in front of you while we nurse the lead pretty frequently this year hell we already are we can score with this team

and our division is specifically a little too good at running the football for us to pace the league in stopping that

the great defenses dont necessarily have to lead the league in every category thats a function of how your team is performing on both sides of the ball they just need to be able to step up when it counts and weve already proven this year that were absolutely elite at that
what did this look like last week before the debacle at baltimore
well this did not age well did it

ah shit hope the staff member is ok and that this doesnt affect our players
ah fuck just please make it through one more day
ah fuck we have done so well
hopefully its the assistant janitor that works overnight
steelers official statement
i say this with all my heart

fuck baltimore
breaking nfl fines preemptively steelers organization 1000000 just cause

guess f5 friday continues
any teams left that havent had any covid news
hello bye week
this sucks especially after getting fined for tomlins lax mask shenanigans covid aint no joke
unmmmm
hello tuesday night game bet we play tuesday so we get 3 days worth of negatives which is made easier by the sunday night flex if the bungels if that game isnt pushed to monday to follow


aaf legend i will be slightly sad when they beat his ass
steelers win 2827
rip
ok but how long will he be in the game for will he be the first qb to get pulled for shell shock
seems like a good athlete and has some moxy to his game face however he seems to stare down his target andor engage in preplanned look offs like justin herbet like the typical college starter who cant adjust to the nfl

conclusion hes going to get rekt
ok so dont play amari cooper got it
cooper rush lives another day
cooper rush spent all week saying hail marys and it worked
removed
please leave politics out of the football subreddit a lot of us look at these to get away from all this
nah its offset by the eagles
trump 2020 you cant cheat your way into the presidency

mike tomlin 736 90321 the 3rdbest success rate of any nfl coach during his 13 years in the league

chuck noll 725 13752

bill cowher 723 10239

but tomlin plays down to his opponents
dread it run from it steelering arrives all the same
i think the playing down narrative is overblown but per steelers depot the steelers are 64 in games in which they are a doubledigit road favorite under tomlin so theres a little something to it
removed
hard to say claypool has only went off when dj has been injured even this past week he left early with a hammy and can back in later aside from that steelers have 3 wrs that can dominate targets depending on what the defense gives them if you really need to pick between them take a look at shadow coverage reports look to see where the opposing teams top cbs tend to play do they travel or stay put
if johnson is healthy play him if not claypool dj gets insane targets from biggums
start dj if hes healthy then hope he stays healthy during the game if at the start of the game dj is already injured start claypool if dj gets dinged up during the game and claypool goes off thats just shit luck

and youre right this isnt allowed
i think the switching off has been more coincidence than game plan the only game where i really see the two players production tied to one another was against the titans when they decided to shadow claypool with logan ryan so dj got filled in with targets

id generally lean dj most of the time
dj gets the snaps when hes healthy since claypool is still a rookie and claypool has fumbled twice recently if i remember correctly if dj isnt healthy claypool gets more snaps thats about all there is to it
i agree with northtop we are going to take what a defense gives us we have juju washington johnson claypool and ebron plus others like connor mcdonald mccloud we just have too many options i dont know there is a safe fantasy play for the steelers on offense right now except for maybe connor and even then he gets tds vultured at the goal line
comes down to which wide receiver being double teamed really
our wr group is stacked this year we have 4 wrs who could be 1s on other teams washington more so 2 on most but still this leads to teams having to choose to double 2 of them of course that leads to 1 popping off 1 week and then when the next team doubles him the other pops off the next week and then the cycle continues

they are literally a practice squid


edit i see it the mistake i stand by it
thats huge for the steelers zeke was the only threat on offense

cowboys gonna tank hard now
cowboys playing xcom over here keeping all the veterans back and sending in just the new recruits to get slaughtered on a mission that is clearly gonna get everyone killed
so sit the starters after the first half
this sucks whos going to fumble now
if our defense doesnt pitch a shutout itll be slightly disappointing they better not let up until the clock hits zero
ohhhh boy
this is not a trap game were going to murder this team
longterm with the way they keep having injuries honestly its probably smart for them to sit as many starters as they possibly can
i almost feel sorry for dallas

but i dont

i dont see how they surpass 150 total net yards tomorrow

edit this didnt age well at all yikes
hope he plays hes worth 2 turnovers a game
honestly the way zeke has been playing theyre probably better with pollard
now theyre just making it too easy
im still genuinely unsure whether pollard is worth picking up id have to drop damien harris or mike williams

edit thought this was rfantasyfootball my bad
we should just treat this like a preseason game at this point no reason to risk serious injuries to any of our starters
i saw the photos of who we had getting on the plane i didnt know half of those dudes i think the org is fully expecting a halftime blowout and throwing in backups haha

ive gotta cop some of these
ive got these bonus endorsement they are also my most comfy masks
i have the same ones wear them everyday
i have the exact same set
thought it was a bad tie at first not that i wouldnt rock it if it was or anything
i dont even wanna know how much this must have cost

it would suck seeing your brother get cut off an undefeated team
i strongly disagree with wisniewsky move i thought was at least a great backupanyway they know better than me what to do
stefen wisniewski and trey edmunds have been waived

avery and jayrone elliott were added to the active roster

demarcus christmas signed to the practice squad

antoine brooks made the game day roster

didnt expect the stefen news there but imo thats an endorsement to dotson i assume edmunds will circle back on the ps as well
sucks for wis but i dont think anyone including the fo expected dotson to be this good so soon
does this mean edmunds is on our ps kinda sucks if he isnt
im still wondering when will avery play probably in the inactives list would announce that
this is the way
i think the wis cut speaks more to his injury you dont just cut capable backups that can play multiple positions
why the hell would we release a starting olineman seems crazy to me that he doesnt even have value to the team as a backup especially given the injuries weve had there

edit yinz are right i forgot he only started week 1 because decastro was out still hes a quality backup and those arent always easy to find

i love juju i feel like if we can keep this group together we will have a top 5 wr corp for years
i feel like with jujus side businesses and sponsorship deals hes more likely to take a team friendly deal to stay with a staff he knows and likes while staying in a city he knows and likes with a team he loves

i feel like after this season conner is a free agent and i dont think he hang onto washington long term either despite my wishing we would

its gonna be interesting to see what the team looks like come preseason time next year
was doing some reading on this fine saturday and stumbled across this from gerry might be worth a read for ya

lots of debate around juju returning but perhaps he takes a backloaded contract gonna be a tense offseason
when juju had that big catch and run for a first down at the 2 yard line against the ravens did you see how he protected the ball with both arms hes learned his lesson on ball security
i really like the comparison of juju to hines

i would be absolutely stoked if he embraced that role
i think its more likely that we cut washington loose

i like the dude but hes gonna be a rotation player behind juju diontae and chase if he wants that bag he wont find it in pittsburgh
he already pretty much said that he knows the grass isnt always greener
juju is smart to be working with endorsements and numerous other entities for supplemental income ofcourse a new fat contract is sweet but he may not need it which could be good for us
yeah so fuck off mark madden
if he can come well below market value we can keep him but its really this first year that makes things so stupidly difficult with the cap room
been saying this for a long time now he is an ideal steeler character guy the type of guy who gets multiple contracts here
it would be nice to keep juju hes just so darn likeable and his play style is perfect for pittsburgh he has a lot of endorsements so he could theoretically take a team friendly deal and stay with us if he prioritizes winning and culture over contracts i wouldnt blame if he did test free agency though with that being said i also really appreciate james washington too hes a good ole boy and a hard worker claypool seems very similar so far and claypool is the best athlete of all of them dj is the only one that worries me personalitywise but hes still thankfully no ab except for having exceptional route running

theres 2 ways i see this going if juju walks we roll with claypool dj and washington as originally expected if juju resigns on a team friendly deal i could maybe see us trading washington it really depends on what juju wants to do and who else can be resigned bud is still playing himself out of our price range and i could see hilton being let go with the way sutton is developing although his deal is ending too as he was drafted right after conner
hes going to need a team friendly deal
i watched one of his twitch streams one night and someone commented and asked him to join seattle and he just laughed at it and said theres no chance i play there i feel like hes happy where hes at and a solid chance we keep him
i been saying this for a while now juju is literally the second coming of hines ward tough crafty reliable blocker always smiling and having fun his value goes beyond just his contract no way the steelers let him go
if they give juju and conner buds money im going to be pissed thats all i have to say on the matter
how even if it was something like 12 per we couldnt afford it and he will likely get more than that
i just dont see how it gets done unless juju comes in really low like even if he took a tyler boyd style extension that may even price him out of the steelers market so hell need to take a teeny signing bonus and something that has big nonguaranteed money down the road

i still think it could happen but im guessing that he may get overwhelmed by an offer
i love this team so much so i hope they get a ring this year some key guys may be gone next year but at least well always be able to remember this squad as champs
well this makes me happy
im hoping he stays but with claypool and johnson being studs not sure if steelers will pay him what he will want
hes either going to play wel and price him out of pittsburgh or play bad and they wont want him he gone
i hope he retires as a steeler
more worried about bud leaving than juju i would hate to see him go anywhere else
we have the benefit of having a qb that is retiring in a season or 2 so we could back load his contract another thing probably worth mentioning is the steelers arent the only team in cap hell right now
this is dulacs opinion and based on almost nothing

juju evidently wants to stay obviously the steelers want to keep him that does not mean the money is going to work out
mark madden in shambles
dont get me wrong i love juju but even if he doesnt resign with us ill think well still be fine because we have other young talented wrs
call me crazy but i think we are going to see more players l move to establish good situations and play them out the players who are signing mega contracts are resigning rather than opting free agency
juju the real mvp
what we have 4 other receivers who are just as good week to week if i was juju or the steelers i wouldnt resign
idk most cali boys i know usually wanna move back to cali
id be interested in what his market would look like wise i think its safe to say dj is our 1
i dont even worry about it because we could lose the whole corps and tomlin will just draft another couple pro bowl wrs next year
hes gone not for any flowery reason

hes gonna get 1 money from some team desperate hes not going to get 1 money here cause we get so much value from others

same reason bell left ultimately


but maybe we could tag juju
so juju over dupree basically
theyll offer him a similar contract that ab got his first time when they chose ab over wallace

his numbers dropping have been a blessing cause if he was balling thered be no way we could sign him
if he doesnt break the bank i want to keep him hes the next hines ward
i love juju but im not sold on him as a 1 and as well as the steelers draft wr factoring in the drop on the cap thats coming i think the steelers might pass on him unless he goes way under market
love me some juju his attitude has been impeccable this year
i guarantee you our fo opts to pay bud dupree first if theres enough money left over then juju gets paid wr has never been a priority does no one remember cedrick wilson he was literally the reason antonio brown happened
dont speak so soon

weve been known to treat stars poorly
steelers cant afford him without shredding their defense

sorry juju wont be here next year so make the most out of this year

i fucking love how unified this team is and that it isnt about just one player
i believe what he meant to say was lol thats alex highsmiths replacement not minds take it how you want to i am back
spillane appears to be an awesome human on and off the field glad we got him in the burgh
question is do we think hell keep his starting spot or will williamson take someone elses spot
what is the point of having a backup on the roster if when it comes time to use them you need to sign someone else serious question
ive seen the espn app send me a notification that a steelers staff member not clear who and whether in contact with the playerscoaches has contracted covid and that the team is working the nfl on contact tracing i cant find that piece of news now any news if our game tomorrow is in jeopardy

x200b

im in europe not getting steelers news on tv and just wondering if i missed anything i wait the whole week for sunday to see my steelers play i dont want corona to take it away from me again
lol if the nfl continued with thursdays game with packers and niners you bet theyll play our game

they dont really care about being proactive at all especially now that we dont have a bye week to move around anymore
were playing no worries
other teams have had staff and players test positive and still play this isnt a titans type situation
at this moment there are no worries whatsoever as with everything in america 2020 that could of course change at the drop of a hat
were playing but if it comes to it im sure perfectly fair goodell will rearrange the schedules of 6 other teams to help us out

ive looked at this for five hours now
tj and bud have more combined sacks than 9 nfl teams
aaron donald needs to come back home
outside of ogbah they all have one more game played then the black and gold note sure if any of those players missed any games nor will i be looking that up lol
damn check out jpp staying relevant must have some crazy medical bills or something
i feel like the answer is obvious but im fairly new to the nfl so can i ask why they count sacks in 5 decimals rather than whole numbers
aaron donald a defensive tackle leads the league in sacks my goodness
them being three in a row looks so aesthetically pleasing
wait so they have 6 sacks a piece 666 the mark of the beasts

stephon tuitt is the best player on our defense and possibly the entire team
hey guys is this good because it feels good
im also happy to see jason pierrepaul continue to succeed despite fucking up his hand on the fireworks incident nice to see guys succeed after mistakes like that
we are also number 1 and 2 for tfl
those numbers are about to sky rocket i just hope that who ever the cowboys start can enjoy being put to sleep every 3 downs
i think were gunna have a good team this year 2020 doesnt totally suck
something something correlation does not imply causation yea this is clear evidence of having a fantastic defense and qbs in the rest of the league should get a little nervous having to play the steelers
why are the colors different on tuitt
so if my math is right thats 185 sacks combined from just 3 players on the same team incredible
oh yeah brother
rip gilbert
ooooh weeee we got some bad boys
i have to admit im kind of sad that dalton isnt getting the start tomorrow itd be nice if our 3 players moved up on the list by sacking ole red

7 of the 10 people on the list played the giants
ya know everyone says how theyd love to have jj watt and im over here like nah aaron donald is the man
47 in 5 a sack
the boys are buzzin
now if only we could start drafting dbs well at we do defensive lineman well really front seven and wide receivers
now if only we could start drafting dbs well at we do defensive lineman well really front seven and wide receivers
this number about to skyrocket today
aaron donald is a different breed best football player alive
its fucking beautiful
thats not how ranking works two people can hold number 1 there next number is 2 then three people hold 3 after that the next 4 tied hold number four

at this point i almost feel bad for the cowboys

almost
the dankest timeline
bro what the fuck is youre username
what are the odds

elliot watches spillanehenry hit nah man still hurts
thats only because hed like to play in a game after this one
jesus our fans go nuts when we win a heart attack gamei cant imagine what cowboys fans are going through

long john silvers
alincoln
jj watt doesnt start with and l and isnt silver
watch philly make the playoffs at 610 phillypittsburgh super bowl pennsylvania gets the lombardi either way but we all know which city will be having the parade
lombardi here comes 7
just get them a win tomorrow
a silverplated loss that doesnt sound appetizing
limousine im sure the state has a few of those already but okay why not
does it perhaps rhyme with party
it might be silver but it starts with a dub
took me too long nice title
im sure those frackers would like some food for their families gotta love how out of touch seth mcfartin is

is he playing today i feel like this game would be a good warmup game for him
hes been activated and hes going to dress as an emergency backup so well get a look at him in a steelers jersey but the most strenuous thing hes likely to be doing is sipping gatorade
i doubt it barring injury maybe in a complete blowout situation

hes been virtual practicing all week and they dont really want to play someone they havent had a good look at in real practice if they can avoid it
i dont believe hes cleared covid19 protocol yet to be activated for the game he should just be on the inactive roster for the day

the recent roster cuts and moves were to make room for him but not so he could play today next week is the earliest he can actually take the field for us i believe
likely not this week ive heard a lot of next week though
from what ive heard he is a faster version of vince williams and he barely posted faster that spillane in the 40 spillane is 4 years younger and is an unknown commodity with regards to his talent ceiling avery has been competent and above avg as a run stopper kind of meh in pass coverage like vince and spillane id rather have spillane in more downs a guy who is playing with house money and has nothing to lose and everything to gain from playing well i think barring a colossal screw up by spillane that avery will be the backup for around 3 games while they try to coach avery up to play as our coverage capable ilb so long as he shows more in practice in coverage he will take the majority of defensive snaps with spillane working in as the backup

that was fun man a trip down memory lane i forgot about a lot of those names specifically the tight ends
man talk about a walk down memory lane kimo von oelhoffen i feel old
in that 2004 season the cowboys went 610 it was part of six year stretch from 20002005 where they had a losing season four times and only made the playoffs once until romo came along

in case anyone was wondering whether the nailbiter win over a bad team was new under tomlin or if its simply how all professional sports play out the occasional game with a blowout like the steelers and browns game a couple weeks ago does not change the rule
oh man this takes me back to when espn game highlights were real recaps of the game not just a 30 second highlight reel and the final score but actually letting you feel the highs and lows of the game
terry glenn shes wide open

thats so awesome
got to see this game in person it was great
i was just listening to these old nfl primetime songs this morning i love them
so many chill bumps
jerome bertie now up to 2 yards per carry on the season
this was the game i knew we had something special in ben
vts fumble was on 3rd down at about the 50 the debate was whether to close out the game with a first down or play it safe punt and have the steelers have to drive from deep in their own end

normally trying to get the first down and finish the game out is the right call but based on vts history theyd have been further ahead to keep the game out of his hands and run the ball
i remember this game
this title hurts to see eight hours late
dang big ben is old

roethlisberger 2020
heyward

watt

2020

you will never be loved like you will be loved by the city of pittsburgh and steelers fans
call me the united states cause i want to put more money into our already strong defense
hell end up cut since nobody will want to take on his contractthink texans can get out with little to no dead money
hypothetical whats the most you would give up for him if you did not have to be concerned with the salary cap

i would do it for a 4th with possiblyandisaypossibly talked into giving up a 3rd
kevin i know we dont typically do this kind of thing but i know that you know that we all know the window is closing i saw the trade up you made for bush we watched you trade a first round pick for fitzpatrick we never thought you would do it but youre all in on 7 as are we now i am asking you again please go get this man

fuck the cap
there is no way we trade for him with his salary next year there is a good chance no one does imo since his salary isnt guaranteed texas would be better off releasing him and letting jj be a free agent maybe then we can sign him to a i just want a championship kind of contract otherwise we cant afford him
could we collect the whole set
175m cap hit next year you can get that down a good 1012m with an extension but that requires a pretty long back loaded extension for a guy who will be 32 by the time he plays a down for you
i would love to have jj

id love to keep bud even more
it was my understanding that unless ben retires theres no way wed have the money for him
eh what position would he play exactly
dont do this to me dont give me hope
someone photo shop a steelers jersey on the watt family picture they took when they played the texans
fuck it tell him to lose weight and line him up at olb when we lose bud next year none of it makes sense but 2020 makes me want the fucking gratification of it all
jaromir jagr also should have retired as a penguin
how about all the watt brothers sign up some team friendly deal im sure the family is financially stable make a deal with tj derek to take a partial hit ask jj to take a hit and give them 2 maybe 3 years to see what can be done
yes pls
the watt trifecta
soon we will have all the infinity stones
ben really needs to take a huge pay cut
it would be awesome but do we really need him who are likely to lose on defense next year bud defense is still going to be stacked again feel like we can make moves on the other side of the ball that would help the team more
salary is the big deal with jj those claiming hes washed or where would we put him dont know what theyre talking about

firstly i guarantee jj ups his game especially if his little brother is on the line talking shit about how hes better brotherly rivalry is a thing and jj hasnt had a terrible season despite showing no interest in the shit show that is the texans

secondly something i havent seen brought up we could offer a 3rd to have the texans eat a majority of jjs contract on a signing bonus texans are clearly going to be rebuilding so i doubt the cap hit hurts them too hard given theyre 11 mil under the cap and will be pushing for rookies they already signed watson and i doubt johnson remains on the team who is a 11mil cap hit it makes things more complex to do it this way but it makes sense

the reason why jj would be nice to have if tuitt or heyward go down we really dont have the depth to mask their production everytime tuitt goes down we feel it helping the rotation with heyward tuitt and jj means theyre all much more fresh ingame and less likely to be injured longterm from a high snap count while also providing legit relief in the case of injury personally i see this as an absolute win if we can get jj here without having to eat his cap space long shot but its a legit shot
i would much rather he went to another team on a 2 year deal and sign him when hes done with that team at that age he would be a solid backuprotational player which we need a lot more than a solid starter
cool but theres no way well have the cap space to sign him without getting rid of enough highcap players that the team becomes a noncontender
why we run a three four
packers need a de he is going home not the burgh
trading for jj is a waste of most likely draft capital and cap space
no great player but hes always hurt and past his prime
we dont have the cap but it would be nice to see
the thought of winning a sb with his brothers and having that forever with his family has got to be a big draw for himi dont think he cares about doing it by himselfhe would have to take a massive pay cut which also doesnt seem like a big deal to himso maybe but green bay is probably at 85 to get him
imagine the glory of our defense
would we even have the cap space for him
im a texans fan and i want watt on a contender he deserves it and it would be something if all 3 watts were on one team
we arent allowed to talk about thisaccording to folks on hereshhhhh
come on home sir
we are much better off using the cap to keep bud juju and pay tj like the star he is

the king in the north
he needs a bigger codpiece for his gigantic balls
exquisite
appreciate the challenge flag in hand
yup thats my coach in all his glory
hopefully this season has a better ending than game of trones did king of the north
we need to get this on the sidebar of rravens
i think every player has been featured in this

what does the title of the post have to do with the article
we are good this year but i feel a touch too inconsistent to win a super bowl we have had incredibly good halfgames and horrible looking ones i feel like if both the offense and defense were in rhythm for a whole game even 3 solid quarters we could beat just about anyone seeing the very best of some of the top contenders such as seattle green bay kc titans ravens i think we are capable of beating all of them and weve beat two by the skin of our teeth if we are firing on all cylinders with the team we have
i guess this article can tell the future already giving us the win vs dallas
pretty damn good id say
we should be considered the clear favorite were more in command of our division and our destiny than any other team in football and our team is so well balanced that a couple random injuries hurt us less than they hurt most other teams

for all the whining you hear locally about oh woe is us were so inconsistent go watch some of the other teams you think of as elite just as a hint to the kind of inconsistencies you can expect consider if any other team were even more reliably good and consistent they too would be undefeated

every team has hits and misses what sets us apart right now is the fact that we have so much talent that usually when we suffer at some phase of the game for a while one of the other phases is there to pick us up were pretty much the only team in 2020 for whom that is the case
please make this game over quick i have a lot id rather do than watch a game in which there is even a glimmer of hope

thanks
just watch the 3rd quarter youll love it youll start thinking your team is a legit super bowl contender
really have a feeling this will be much closer than anyone is realizing
real fans watch disappointing games through

we had to put up with the infamous duo all last season
sorry thats not how we do things in pittsburgh
yeah i smell a trap game pleas no
just dont watch the game if you have better things to do im a ku fan i dont even bother wasting my time with their football games
cowboys fan you obviously havent watched much steelers football our mo is to get a lead by the end of the half and have the opponents needle us until our lead is only by three we will force a fumble with a minute left at our 20 and win
tell mike to throw in the towel early
this is aging well
i think until jerry jones gives up gm duties the cowboys r going to struggle to be a true super bowl contender
sorry not sorry thats steeler football we make things close for no reason but you guys are still in playoff contention


i have one of those too
ive been wearing a sweatshirt and a home juju jersey since week 1 and we won every game i didnt have the sweatshirt on for the first half of last week put it on and we won so ill keep wearing that shit lmao
thats awesome where did you get it
could you imagine beating brady and brown in the superbowl
that would be amazing but i dont think i would be alive to see it because i would have died of a heart attack during the afcg against the chiefs
and 5 coaches that either played for us or previously coached for us
only after beating bell and the chiefs in the afc championship
bucs retirement community in florida nonetheless

pittsburgh west became the villages south
not anymore

love it like how it has the same texture
i have one of these as well and let me say this before it even gets asked its very breathable one of my most comfortable masks to be honest it has a softer texture than what it looks like highly recommend
where do you get this
how can you post that and not tell me where to get it your a monster
here for anyone looking
i wear mine all the timeand i live in northeast ctin patriots country ive put up with so much of their fans shitnot so much this year

hes probably gonna bust a nut today on the field by accident
bro no you need the postnut clarity
reminds me of the running back from blue mountain state lmao
if he stays course by the end of the month he will be the leagues leading receiver quarterback running back kicker returner tackler and commentator
watch him start aggressively dominating the next few weeks
a stronger man than i but we knew that already considering i post on reddit and he is a steeler
rip defenders
definitely doubt it
i do not endorse this

wait im just realizing their presidents name is dick ass
was this you
mehnot bad for a running back
facts

why 2 months where did you order that from
no dont wear it wait till after this game
well lets all hangout here until we get some action
rivers just had a chance to replicate big bens td saving tackle lower stakes obviously but instead completely fucked it up add it on to the list of reasons ben is the best of that class
my favorite stat so far steelers opponents are 15 the week after playing the steelers the only win is the browns over bengals ravens are losing today

think about how badass we are that we literally cripple teams for an extra loss losing to the steelers is basically losing two games
every week i hope the steelers win and the ravens lose so right at this moment im a colts fan
refs gotta bail the ravens out again
did anyone see that ravens call dont want to ever hear those motherfuckers cry about refs again
i know were all watching the ravenscolts game and rooting for the colts but can we get love for the panthers right now them beating the chiefs would put us at a solid spot for the first seed in the afc right now its 143 carolina so things are looking pretty good
stupid ass ravens getting a strip
imagine banking on phil rivers to win a big game
the ravens are excellent at ball stripping we need to replicate that
ravens have a major steelers hangover zero rushing yards in the first quarter lmao
lol ravens would be getting blown out if it wasnt for that fumble td
kc and bal down

would shape up nicely for us
my hot take for this week was the ravens and chiefs both lose
dez and jesse james werent catches but that is

yeah ok
just saw the fucking ratbirds ran back a fumble for a td to tie it
baltimore lol
jake luton wtff
always fun watching the ravens get their asses beat
keep it up indy
is it best for a raven loss or colts
well recovery for allen
does anyone turn the ball over more than baltimore holy cow its too predictable
i dont believe in rivers whatsoever but maybe he can not fuck up something for himself for once and beat a top tier team
redzone time
holy hell lets go panthers
lets go panthers
dilemma i want the ravens to lose but i also know someone who is a colts fan and the thought of them being miserable gives me great joy

perhaps a tie keep that ravens browns comparison going

also are the bills gonna topple the seahawks today
live by the sword die by the sword
every minute that passes in these games we look better and better
ravens and chiefs both in trouble today lets prove why were kings of the afc today lets gooo
chiefs and panthers just traded missed field goals
was anyone else under the impression this was a 1pm game since last week ive got footblueballs right now
panthers just hit a fake punt on the chiefs and it was a beauty

edit td carolina
one of my steelers gcs is legit debating whether to watch charli or dixie damelio tiktoks as good luck charms for the game
we have a steelers discord
the wft is cursed if youre a qb
the upside if the ravens win it makes the steelers defense look even better because at least we held on
snr is reporting that juju andor chase claypool were dancing on the dallas star at midfield
k bills look utterly terrifying

wholesome content can confirm
what a cutie my daughter is expecting our new steelers fan granddaughter in a few weeks cant wait to see her in all the new steelers gear i have already bought for her here we go

nuts are a good source of healthy fats so i dont see why anyone would be concerned with cutting them out of their diet for a whole month
doubt ab will either

hes just waiting for his comeback

i perceive that you are a prophet
told my wife the aame thing a couple weeks ago
from your lips to gods ears
that would be the cats ass right there
ill just take a super bowl man
ben rides off into the sunset happy he can finally pig out on those oreos and have those late 2am buffet sessions at eat n park with no more restrictions or judgement and assume his final form mega fat fuk worlds laziest man

nah running backs run forward
big oof now

the og tb12
touchdown


damn not dereks watts
definitely nothing unexpected
glad to see hilton out and we got reggie watts out again i see
no real surprises im on board to let hilton and watt rest up here
so whats was the point of cutting nix he played great for us had one injured season then we cut him to sign a guy who barely plays and has only played 3 games at best

furthermore we cut edmunds who i expect to end back on the ps who is the only thing close to a backup fb we had goddamn dude

this was created by a bot for issues or suggestions please message gdtbot nfl changed a lot during the offseason so improvements will be made during the season
post game thread
so were just actively treating this as a bye week got it
if he makes this im shotgunning my beer

edit mama aint raise no bitch ill brb my yinzerz
that shouldve been a flag

but claypool shouldve 100 caught that it went straight through his hands
weird once ben starts play calling we move the ball almost like our oc is a bottleneck
there is no rule that the qb cant be the oc also
whoever got the false startmvp
dear bens knee please be okay i cant take another play with rudolph
thank god

steelers qb ben roethlisberger sustained a knee injury and was taken to the locker room prior to halftime to be further evaluated he is expected to return in the second half
how is dallas not getting flagged for jumping the snapper
so everyone knows the first few series of a game are scripted offensive plays everyone knows we struggle the first quarter of games until we stop using the game script so at this point if the only way we score is when ben can do what he wants why do we have a offensive coordinator
78 thank you very much for your service but lets not get ben killed when hes already on one knee

good int but damn it i wish minkah would have just gone down in the end zone
maybe the defense wouldnt be gassed if the offense could stay on the fucking field this is so stupid im tired of people telling me fichtner is anything better than the worst oc in the league its not even worth replying to you retards who still believe this shit when i point out shit like how ben changes the plays at the line or just straight up audibles out of garbage fichtner playcalling you tell me thats not a knock on fichtner actual fucking retards who argue with me on this sub about our incompetent oc

watch all of a sudden ben will start calling all the plays and the offense will be able to play football and people will tell me fichtner did a good job this shit is exhausting its the same shit every week
whatever age i die i want my family to know i would have lived another 20 years if i wasnt a steelers fan
help us juju youre our only hope
second time theyve gotten away with launching
the insurmountable 30 deficit fire everyone complete rebuild incoming
ben about to come out on those aaron rodgers drugs
i want to see some replays on this guy jumping over because i have seen that shit called so often
people are saying to chill but why this is fucking humiliating we have no offensive play calling and our defense is getting bossed by an aaf qb even if it isnt even the second half this is fucking embarrassing
wow ben is calling the plays and now we can move the fucking ball fichtner is so good right guys fucking morons
hahahahahaha made a fucking 59 yarder from boswell is good

please let ben be okay
miss a 54 make a 59 2020 in a fucking nutshell
lmao yall gotta stop overreacting if claypool makes that tough catch or the refs actually call pi wed be winning already its all good
you youngns might not member the good ole days but back then when the ben got hurt his passer rating received a 50 buff from badass mode activated

this is the most vintage game ever
this is by far the worst weve looked this season makes sense its in a game that we were prohibitive favorites
down 130 yall ready for run run incompletion because i sure fucking am
its funny how predictable this is starting to get we need to get it together its starting to get embarrassing
prediction ben comes out in the second half lights up the cowboys score 3513 steelers
i feel like steelers underutilize juju every time things start going to him big plays are made
everyone all week has been saying trap game apparently no one listened
i dont blame that on boz the cowboys were fucking in there
oh ye of little faith kneel now before your master the burger of roeth whose knee though composed of putty shall support great heaves of mightiness and downward touches galore

bask not in the glory of steeler nation this day for ye who have forsaken the black and gold deserve none of the fruits of our labor

cower in your corners ye faithless cursed be your names
pack it up boys seasons over

s
i cant do another season of rudolph seeing him at quarterback makes me want to puke
please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben please be fine ben
ben better trot his big oaf ass into that field for the second half
the cowboys scored 22 points combined in their last 3 games already have 19 on an elite defense
oh fuck thats not boswells fault

so anyone want to apologize
bruh that was the fastest quarter of football in history
give it to me again harder this time bos probably
59 yards a new record congrats to boswell and the steelers roy gerela must be happy
juju needs to stay
twice now dallas has jumped over the longsnapper isnt that illegal
its time

defense

its time

show this dallas qb what the fuck pressure means
3 pats would slap right now
boswell is entitled to a miss with how the rest of the team is playing he has been strong the whole season
how much could we pay a cowboys player to just run towards our sideline and break randys fucking legs
funny how our 2nd string qb never looked as good as their 4th
happened to watt 3 times but whatever
1st and 10

no 1st and 5

scratch that 1st and 15
you are without a doubt the worst 70 team ive ever heard of

ahh but you have heard of me
areare we getting these kinds of calls now is this how it feels
i wanna see a watt strip fumble
thats a chip shot fg to go up 8 points on a team with no timeouts what in the absolute fuck are they doing
what a game from minkah
im sending the county of allegheny a health bill for 2 heart attacks in one week fuck me
can ben just call all our plays fichtner is so trash
run on 2nd and fucking 14 fuck you randy
tj watt at least has showed up
keep buggs in send mondeaux to the bus
i cant figure out how anyone looks at rudolph and thinks the future
put dobbs in rudolph sucks
im not watching mason rudolph play football for the next 8 weeks
god im getting flashbacks from last season with rudolph at qb please ben be okay man i dont think i can see this garbage for the entire second half of the season
alright its halftime bless everyones and most importantly bens knee cowgirls are still trash heart attack whole second quarter as is steelers fashion we can do this lets riiiiide
guys dont worry im a pt he passed the lipshitz test hes fine
cowher telling it like it fucking is haha
holy shit we sent dupree and he got home rather then getting beat in coverage its a god damn miracle i really hate butler
that was a time consuming drive in fact most of the cowboys drives seem to go on forever we have maybe 4 possessions left at this rate
need 4 go for 30 0 steelers need to work on their math
looks like ben is finayseeing the bad matchups on juju
how is the ref going to call that holding when the dallas oline is literally wrapping around tj and dupree
who even had time to block he ran 5 yards
can anyone explain to me why they arent calling the leaping over the ls
are they going to call this guy jumping over the center at all
hard for boswell to make a kick when you have froggy hopping over every time
wed be up if it werent for those two blocked extra points

defense needs to make a stop on this drive and offense needs to at least get us in field goal range to put this away

this has been utterly ridiculous today
i thought you couldnt jump over the long snapper why is that not being called genuinely asking
id prefer a td with under 20 seconds i dont trust a field goal with that dude breaking through every time
we do this every fucking week


relax
why am i afraid of a 4th string qb making a 2 minute comeback
why would you not kick a field goal
a win is a win is a win
thats the worst ive ever felt after a win i think
chill its the first quarter

chill its only halfway thru the second you are here

chill its only halftime

chill theres still a quarter left

chill ben has a great 2 minute drill
please god dont make me watch a whole second half with rudolph under center
i literally just said out loud watch us run a pussy ass draw play on 2nd and long and wouldnt ya know it

lol just imagine steeler fans that we are in the playoffs and we are playing a team like the chiefs and decide to be running on 2nd and 14
yinzers say fire oc when 70

imagine thinking fichtner has any right to be the oc of a 70 team our offensive play calling is consistently ass
i expected nothing less and yet im disappointed
im not even mad i think we all expected this
defense got bailed out lol cooper wouldve had the first down if he doesnt fall why the fuck are they playing zone
cant wait to run the ball here we go fat fuck randy
massive pi and defensive holding no call
offense works when fitchner isnt involved
its amazing how well we move the ball when we let ben just do his thing
if mike tomlin was wearing his sunglasses like the first 7 games of the season we would not be having these problems
why dont we let ben run the offense all the time honest question the difference is insane
ill take ben in a wheelchair over rudolph in the second half
i dont care if we get blown out as long as ben can come back
if boz makes this ill name my firstborn after him

edit huh boz summerlin has a nice ring to it at least
this place is so bipolar right now and i love it
if ben didnt go in the locker room its tied mason sucks
whoever false started deserves a raise
in boswell we trust

x200b

59yd field goal is good
mason rudolph observationtoo much air under his throws very little zip
this game aint over until all the votes are counted
we are so good at making qbs who have never had any significant snaps look like they are seasoned vets with a couple rings lol

still a one score game im not panicking but i am very annoyed with the playcalling and sloppiness we should be torching this scrub defense
cant even blame bos on that one
is there some kind of higher force at work here
center in fg formation cannot be touched no
what the hell is up with these missed calls you cant use another person to launch yourself over the line im so over this game
we just arent going to call the penalty for pushing the center down while jumping over the center wtf is wrong with these refs this is like 101 there should never be pressure over the center
damn those missed extra points are looming large
i thought jumping the line was a penalty
this is it ben we believe in you fuck fichtner and do your thing
jesus is this how important alualu is to the defense
if we cant put up 20 points on this abysmal cowboys d how the fuck do we plan on winning anything in the playoffs this is a serious question
i could go for one of those game winning drives about now
renegade still playing wife is telling me turn it down but im yelling at the d to turn it up tequila brought me here
can someone please explain to me why we dont kick a fg and go up 8 points
not kicking the field goal was dumb as shit even if boswell missed it or it got blocked theyre not returning it for a touchdown and they still get the ball at the same spot they did
man the announcers are really on the side of dallas
fire the special teams coach if you dont trust his unit enough to kick a 30 yarder to put the game away
my heart has exploded and my liver has erupted this team is killing me fuck it 80 baby
yall its still q1 lets relax
jesus you guys are soft lol
highsmith is going to be a draft steal i think
2nd and 14theyll never guess a handoff

yeah theres a reason for that
i really hope all you fitchner apologists are watching right now
why is haden back there
huh who would have thought this could be a classic steeler trap game well pull it out but it wont be pretty
fire keith butler

i mean he should have been fired after the jacksonville playoff game but i digress
everyone else i cant believe the 16 cowboys are beating the steelers

steelers fans par for the course
this run run pass predictability is getting old how the hell does the front office not see this how can they turn a blind eye to such horrible oc
ive been watching the steelers since i was 5 and they do this every year but god damn does it piss me off every time
its crazy how much of a difference we play when big ben calls the plays versus when he doesnt
hey these passes are working lets run a draw play 3x in a row
halftime adjustments
1 let ben draw plays in the dirt again
2 dont suck
wow they simply wont call dpis
boswell baby what is you doin
sometimes it just takes a few wacks to get ben going kinda like an old tv
queue the 2nd half knee bracepleeease
bens blood has got to be more than 75 painkiller at this point
not only did ben will his team to a td while injured he used the injury to bait the cowboys they thought he was going to continue to get it out quick and he used that to bait the double move unreal
things we learned rudolph is still bad
thats the most pittsburgh thing i could ever see
how many injections is ben gonna get at halftime
boz misses an extra point misses a 54 yarder drills the 59 yarder the man is good at redeeming himself
god i hope ben is ok i cant handle mason the redfaced qb again
the missed kick told him exactly how to adjust the irony
roboben better walk outta that tunnel for the second half
how about in future games we deactivate mason and activate dobbs
yay pissed off ben coming out if the tunnel go time
call me crazy but having bud and tj play middle linebacker doesnt seem like a super effective strategy
is our goal to allow a field goal on every drive
that gimpy knee fuck off nancy
anyone thinking this team was going 160 isnt aware of how hard it is to go undefeated in the nfl add in the fact that our bye week got moved to so early in the season and you can see its fucking amazing that we got to 70 now im not saying we wont come back in the end here im just saying maybe temper your expectations a little
a pissed off big benscary stuff
3rd and 4 better bomb it sounds about right
we trying to get ben killed we saw what their pass rush did to the eagles and it feels like we completely didnt prepare
just 4 safeties and we are back in this game
tony romo can you believe it if this is the game they lose

all steelers fans yes
honestly im not saying were gonna lose yet but if yall didnt expect this game to go this way you aint been watching steelers football for the last 20 years
we have to find a way to resign juju just have to
why the heck did half the line not stand up for that kick
i thought you couldnt push off the blockers to try to jump the line
i though you couldnt jump the snapper anymore
special teams can fuck off
shouldve just stayed in the endzone
why did he run it out
im fucking hyped but minkah you got to take a knee there 20 yards of field position and now were backed up
minkah and juju doing it by their fucking selves
this is the drive for our offense to show we are 70 cant go 3 in out right now
as hard as ive been on this team for today its hard to win more than 7 or 8 games when youre undefeated still theres no reason for this to be a heart attack game against such a bad team
pick 6 from our d please
i thought you couldnt jump over the snapper on field goals
can we please not allow a 14 play gilbert led scoring drive
why do the steelers to this to us
i cant get over romo saying that was a good call to not kick the fg
tj being held by his fn neck
i need to train my dog to dial an ambulance just in case i happen to be watching one of these games with no one else in the house
never had a doubt lets fucking go
yo bengals fan here boswell is elite someone please rewind their dvr and find the clip of mike tomlin pointing at and congratulating boswell after he hit the 59 yarder and broke yalls franchise record
maon scans the field from the pocket like me looking to buy my wife the right tampons at giant eagle
if we lose this game alot of it is on fichtner this offense is pathetic 9 points on a 26 team

should of been a flag for holding
how dare that inferior team score on us first

we must enact absolute punishment in response to these inappropriate actions
i just want ben to yell back no the next time a screen is called
randy fichtner is shit
imagine coming out as a big road favorite and just not completely sucking shit every single time

it must be nice
this offense runs a whole lot better when it isnt hamstrung by rustbelt randy
cbs shows all look universally terrible always
ben needs to trade helmets with kam canaday or sean davis or something so he cant hear fichtner anymore
25 yards in the first quarter against dallas practice squad defense i mean sure i guess because me being frustrated means im not a steelers fan
touching moment guys this is my sons first trap game he doesnt understand why we are playing so badly they grow up so fast
today is god damn birthday and i want is to stay undefeated lets go dammit
has success passing
call two consecutive run plays for no gain
slow starts are frustrating as fuck
seriously absolutely fuck keith butler tj needs to give him a good slap
actually insane that this team has had so many weapons on offense this decade and cant find a decent coordinator
why do games like this happen every goddamn season man lol
2 scores down to a team with a scrub qb if youre a pro youre embarrassed
someone just unplug randys headset and tell ben he can have first crack at the buffet afterwards if we win and well be fine
let ben cook it up meth lab style
fuckin pi
did the cowboys just unlock mid season injured ben hope he is good that sucks
how are these pass interferences not being called oh yeah theyre not being committed by the steelers
now youve unleashed injured ben you fucked up dallas
and thats what happens when you let ben call the plays and not fichtner

ill say it again fire fichtner
guys i fucking love ben roethlisberger
missed pat indoors you got to be fucking me
good thing we learned from last season and invested in a good backup qb
we really could have used our regularly scheduled bye two weeks ago thanks titans
oh i didnt miss rudolph
this is what life without ben looks like
how could anyone forget how bad mason is you watched last season right
mason rudolph on my tv is giving me ptsd
mason rudolph spends his offseason training with limas sweed
this game is a meme
boz see 54 yds was too short a field
the false start was a strategic move
was that really a franchise record long fg
let me miss this pat and kick a 59 yarderboswell probably
ahhthe strategic false start to kick a longer field goal after missing a shorter field goal

just like they drew it up
good job on boswell there since he got iced like three times lmao
how can the the cowboys have a 4th or 5th qb that can throw a ball but the steelers cant find a second stringer that can zip it mason floats it w zero power he sucks put dobbs in
ive been searching twitter for updates on ben i found this from burt lauten the pittsburgh steelers director of communications hope hes right



steelers qb ben roethlisberger sustained a knee injury and was taken to the locker room prior to halftime to be further evaluated he is expected to return in the second half
cowher still one of us
they said ben is expected to return
remember to thank the titans for fucking up our bye still a lot of season left to play
this cowboys team is pretty good especially that brady guy
being down 1 possession at this time isnt bad given how this game has played out now its on ben and the offense to answer
this is where the o starts doing pittsburgh things lets fucking go about to be 8 and 0
like where the fuck is our offensive line today
big al almost got him killed
honestly baltimore was less painful to watch at this point last week
3rd and 4 try to chuck it for 35 yards when we havent hit on a deep ball all game big brain fichtner
this is the laziest tackling ive seen all season
cant wait for us to come out and run 2x then chuck it deep
outside of the fumble dallas has had a long drive points on almost every drive
can you believe if this is the game that they lose

literally every steelers fan called it
juju is the answer
i dont give a fuck how ugly it is

a win is a win we got this
canaday has been getting blown the fuck up off the snap
juju and ben are the only ones on offense who came to play
i truly dont understand how thats not leverage
i wish i could be as shit at my job as danny smith and not have to worry about being fired leave his ass in dallas
minkah fitzpatrick the goat
wish theyd just kneel in the endzone for the touchback on those
almost shit all over the floor when that flag came out oh my god
i have worn a jersey for every win this season today i didnt wear one for whatever reason i put one on right before the interception by fitzpatrick im so sorry everyone wont happen again
tony who gives a fuck if it was open handed
wish we had 2 more points rn
really missing those two xps right now
at least we have a return guy that can hang onto the ball
eat our dick dallas
would it really be a steelers game if our blood pressure and heart rates werent elevated x3 with our assholes clenched drenched in sweat watching our defense save the game yet again
steelers football and heart palpitations name a more iconic duo
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
yes you overreacted when we were down

its ok i forgive you same time next week
lol if steelers lose tomlin bout to get lit up
why do 15 out of the 16 games every year have to be heart attacks
pittsburg dad is gonna need cpr
a field goal sure would be nice right now
dumbass decision tomlin thank you minkah for the win
best use of a first round pick ever
tf we really gotta do better so these games dont come down to the final play all the time
i cant take anymore of these games this team will be the end of me
and here i was looking forward to a stressfree sunday
why leave the endzone
catch the ball dammit
romo king of understatements cowboys get away with a little bit of a hold
i know that probably couldve been a penalty but id like to see claypool go get that ball
highsmith first sack
my goodness some of you lol
pathetic
now this is steelers football
you have to love that run play on 2nd and 14 truly astounding play calling
no idea why this team gets complacent against teams like this its absolutely ridiculous
run run pass punt that sounds like a randy special
every week i bitch about fitchner and every week he continues to deliver subpar offensive playcalling we have all this young talent and it feels wasted for so much of every game

glad to see were back to our predictable run run pass
worst 1st quarter of the season
can we just let ben call the plays donate fat fuck randys paycheck to something
romo reading this shit like a book
running on 2nd and long has a massive gap compared to passing in terms of epa the steelers have done it twice on two drives with benny snell noless and punted two plays later each time

only six teams in the nfl run less often than the steelers in that spot and three of them have mobile qbs which clouds the numbers

im not overstating it when i say that specific playcalling tendency is one of the biggest thing that stands in the way of steelers offensive consistency
supposed to be the easiest team to run on in the league right
zeke looks stoned out of his mind on the sideline
8 completions in a row into 3 straight runs for a yard and a hald
somehow a 4th string qb is secretly lamar and brady combined
this is steeler football
if your new welcome to the trap game
about to go down 100 to the cowboys looking bad in the process
havent scored in 110 minutes of game time 4th choice qb who is starting his first game yeah i dont know why i didnt see this first half coming

hopefully we can make some adjustments soon to counter this
im not worried about the outcome yet but i hope these guys are thoroughly ashamed of themselves
all the veteran steelers fans are just vibing we freak out in the second half if shit hits the fan
damn much respect to dallas for that holy shit
do we want to play today or what
broncos fan here yall are not gonna lose to the cowboys so chill
that was a long ass commercial amazon lol
dallas stacks box


steelers lets run up the middle
bens calling plays and were moving who woulda thought that
after this two minute warning i want a quick td strike to claypool or juju make it happen
flag are you fucking kidding me
didnt know you can tackle someone like that before the ball arrives
are you fucking kidding me with that no call
what the actual fuck is going on with the missed calls jesus christ that was a fucking mugging on chase and that was a huge fucking miss on that hit on ben
this is what happens when ben starts calling plays ladies and gentlemen
ok that drive convinced me that randy sucks and ben needs to be the oc
boz has been demoted to boz demigod
ya know other teams get roughing the passer calls for a lot less than that doublesided hit ben took but its ben and the steelers so we dont get those calls
a wounded animal is the most dangerous especially when its cornered big mistake dallas you should have killed him
how is mason still so unprepared
just practicing for that 59yd kick
best false start of all time
boz missed from 54 but hits 59 lmaooo
ok boswell you can get back to town nvm

thatll do boz thatll do
well thats a career long i believe
i am sorry i doubted you bosgod please dont forsake me
longest fg in steelers history
please for the love of god let ben be okay
bosgod
the ice your own kicker with a false start so he gets an extra practice kick just like they drew it up
1110 level iq play there knowing your kicker is going to miss so you intentionally false start

next level stuff
please just let bens knee be okay please
if pittsburgh was a pokmon

ability slow start
cowher restraining himself very well from punching that dude while he smack talking the steelers
if theyre letting ben back in they ought to put a brace on that knee
why are watt and dupree getting matched up against cooper and lamb
80 looked so easy but now it looks like an unneeded battle to the death
all things considered weve given up one shitty td and then a fg off a big special teams play and this fg

need the offense to show up
ok ben get a td now for reals
play calling continues to be garbage no doubt it was making rudolph even worse
are the refs actually going to call pi in the 2nd half
we only needed four effing yards not 40
dallas 6m fg drive

steelers 3 and out
3rd4 doesnt mean bomb it 40 yards
well at least berry is doing well
really need to start throwing the check downs
jesus that was a massive hit on ben

fucking hell ill be disappointed but ill take a loss if we leave this game fully healthy
how can we manage to always make bum quarterbacks look like jesus in his prime
3rd and long sure let them just easily run it
theyre leading us by 10 min in top precisely because we cant stop the rush worth a shit
thank god mccarthy is a pussy and kicked the fg
defense is gassed cant keep up tackling is garbage
steelers look severely outcoached today who knows maybe the loss of a bye week is catching up to them but the effort and game plan is pathetic so far
this isnt a clunker against a 610 team this is an embarrassment against what barely can be considered an nfl roster super bow caliber teams dont have games like this
cmon need some audibles to throw their rookies off
bens mvp run starts right now
juju has been open all day but have been wasted by all the deep throws glad they finally see he is getting open
juju was the whole drive good shit
can they not protect the kick
thats when you know its just not your night lol
boosting on the long snapper is illegal isnt it
ffs what are our st doing today
seriously did everyone forget how to tackle in the last week
shouldve kneeled that one
thank you minkah very cool
kinda wish he hadnt run it out lol
minkah pickpatrick
oh it wasnt a punch yeah his arm was just swinging for no reason
all i know is that the villain in football movies had neck pads
claypool was open too dammit man
those fucking extra points
we should be up 1 right now
we need a count on how many balls ben has had knocked down at the line this season its like an astronomical amount
kick the ball out please for the love of god
watt sack coming followed by watt interception coming
its time for a tj watt strip sack
mongo like tackle
ok ben do this you got this youre a hall of famer this is what you do
2119 is the final
now all we have to do is keep a 4th string qb out of the endzone and it seems like a fucking impossibility lmao
apparently you gotta game plan for gilbert who knew
oh great zone defense time
bend dont break bend dont break bend dont break
i honestly want to know what happens when we game plan against bad opponents
oh mama im in fear for my life from the long arm of the law
sometimes the steelers play like a drunk person whos trying to demonstrate they are not drunk
were gonna win on a pick in the endzone with like 2 seconds left because thats how things work
cam heyward is my dad
ugly win but please remember the chiefs barely beat the panthers 3331 today all nfl teams good and bad are still nfl caliber teams the difference is that the best teams always find a way to win
why the fuck didnt you kick a field goal
serious question why didnt the steelers just kick the field goal and go up by 8
why didnt they just kick a fucking field goal
oh man theres that feeling again
how do you not go for a fg
i know boswell has been ass today but u kick the fg and youre up 8
in no world do you not kick a field goal there
why the fuck didnt we kick a fg
why didnt they kick the fucking field goal
if they steal this tomlin losing a lot of goodwill
whatever happens not kicking it was a bad call 8 point lead gives you some leeway boz missee it were in the same situation
once more d once more
steelers taking years off of my life
2 weeks in a row minkah with the game saving deflection he had himself a big game today
why does this team want to kill me in my mid 20s
rudolph throwing with the velocity i throw tennis balls to my dog in the back yard
nothing would be more steelering than beating the ravens only to lose to the dallas cowboys
damn after one drive yall kill me
i swear ben acts like hes hurt to fake teams out then he starts dropping dimes big brain ben
yall really have no faith bunch of knee jerk reactions instead of looking at the big picture down by 4 into the half is nothing even if rudolph stays in hes got more experience than gilbert with a wide array of weapons and the top defense in the league at his back

tomlin is king of 2nd half adjustments justchill
psa you cant decline a false start as the play should have been dead before the clock starts
anyone else upset seeing someone run around wearing 99 and its not brett keisel
what a fucking trainwreck

dallas had only punted once with a fourth string qb this is why the chiefs got rated ahead of us
gameday meal chili paneer and gobi manchurian indochinese fried rice and flatbread with paneer
3 beers in at the bar lets go
plz for the love of god dont fucking play down to the cowboys just play your game with no injuries and gtfo
jesus can i wear sunglasses kicking in that direction
highsmith making splash plays already love to see it
tj has the fastest time off the line ive ever seen
the 2nd down play call what a bold call
steelering in progress
run run short pass absolutely brilliant fitchner
ok its hard to be mad on a macro level at a team thats 70 but this is an absolutely pathetic start
even dionte johnson looked at fitchner like wtf is this on that drive
ben for oc 2020
omg these yinzers want to fire a coachcoaches off of a 70 team
mccarthy has like 4 chins its kind of impressive
that was really superb discipline from the dline and lbs very good awareness to be able to tell they were just trying to draw them off
for everyone that didnt notice on that punt return with haden returning the defense was on the field i guess in case the cowboys tried to do something funky on 4th inches
zeke looks like a fucking ewok
im not a rb but sometimes i feel like they need to just keep ring instead of wiggling all around
someone remind fichtner that james conner exists
man this run game is worrying oline losing big time
65 240lb qb with a yard to go

lets go in shotgun rather than sneak it
i miss jerome bettis
mondeux is fucking trash
classic trap game

fichtner apologists all over this sub most predictable play calling in the nfl without a hof qb operating it our offense was anemic since randys playbook is dogshit even with a hof qb operating it its hit or miss
they are literally playing with us this game is everything i expected

looking forward for halftime adjustments because thats embarrassing right now
huh looks like dallas got mvp vick in disguise as their qb
you can tell these guys walked in to the stadium thinking this would be any easy win
i really hope this isnt going to be another steelers special against a fucking shit team
why can this 4th string qb execute long drives but our team cant
this thread is always so depressing
i really didnt want to believe this would be a trap game

how do you look this bad against a 3rd stringer
stop putting watt in coverage
must be our annual play down to the opponent game
so we keep covering wrs with lb huh
why the fuck is watt on fucking lamb
why is watt given that assignment
what the fuck defense is this are you fucking serious
tj watt covering a wr on third down
why the fuck is tj on ceedee
playing down to losing teams classic steelers
why the hell do you have tj watt covering and not pass rushing i honestly dont understand
why cant this team ever address the basic problem or thinking they can beat bad teams by just showing up and not being prepared against them
someone help me explain how we arent even blitzing and yet we leave a dude wide open in the end zone make it make sense
3 attempts to get 1 yard and we cant get it

our running game really is garbage
why the fucking fuck is tj watt on lamb instead of breaking havok on the ol
are they still people defending this play calling its just funny at this point i am so fucking disappointed so far it doesnt matter being 70 or 07 this game preparation is terrible so far
what a shitshow
the epitome of steelers football baby
cant be mad at that play dallas showed up to play and so far we havent
getting out played and outsmarted im pissed off
everybody in here acting like they expected differentthis is a steelers special
you know what fair play on that punt return shows a good use of a trick play unlike we are used to when we call fake punts etc
i know we are notoriously a second half team but jesus
trap game fuck me we are playing like horse shit
we are being outplayed in all 3 phasea
ok guys this upcoming drive is the drive
on the plus side berry is absolutely boomin the ball
welp time for another run run pass 3 and out
i still think we win but this was predictable and we can put to bed the idea for the time being that we are as good as the chiefs and it doesnt matter right now anyway what matters is who is better at the end of the year and clearly we have a lot of room for improvement which is actually a very nice thing to say about a team that is 70
0 points in a half is unacceptable no matter who youre playing let alone one of the worst defenses in the league
if for our offense to be functional ben has to make up plays in the huddle then randy fitchner isnt being effective
lets just let 2 minute ben be 60 minute ben instead and have randy take a vacation
no pi

no hands to face on the dt

are there refs
lmaowait what that isnt pi
everyone knows that hurt ben is best ben
great job ebron
bens gonna have the aaron rodgers post game interview my knee
we needed that touchdown but the cost on bens health this drive is too much
ben starts calling the shit he knows he can do with a tweaked knee

randy exits the picture

td
boswell bruh come on
jesus christ boz
see flair
ben and boz secretly swapped knees during replay
lets fucking go ben way to be fucking tough
so healthy ben is trash but 1 legged ben is the goat
ben plays the best when hes a little banged up
pump fake automatic td
ill take hobbled big ben over mason any day
i wasnt nervous until now if we end up with rudolph second half we are most likely fucked
fuck i do not want mason in there
i love all of yinz but calm down 1 this is steelers football so its not over till its over and 2 its going to be fine even if we lose were still a great team id rather lose this game than lose ben or have another starter out
if the refs make the correct and obvious pass interference call on the claypool long pass ben doesnt take that hit and injure his knee on the next play
rudolph looks like hes lobbing horseshoes instead of a football
dear god rudolph sucks
active dobbs next week pls
dobbs couldve at least scrambled and made a play
we really need ben to be ok
who got their online phd and wanna early diagnose this bitch
ok time to sign fitzmagic
is it too late for fitzmagic
haha 59 yard attempt shot now
watch boz make the 60yd fg now lol
luckiest false start ever
boz fucking god

have my kids
bozgod wanted a challenge
not gonna lie im fucking stunned he made it from that far lol
boswell fucking redeemed himself holy shit
bozdemption
tactical false start
of course boswell gets a 59 yard field goal congrats to him
just hope bens knee is good
great job wizard of boz

now really is ben okay because we need him so bad
is ben ok
rudolph still trash then good good
i actually like dobbs better than mason dobbs has a way stronger arm mason throws ducks no pun intended
steelers seem to stalk their prey for a while then strike no half heroes
everyone lend big bens knees your energy
dont usually get on randy but his play calling has been sus this first half
hes backkkkkk
i love bens willingness to play through injuries but he is going to have a shitty retirement dude has broken and torn everything
i hate how moody this team makes me lol guess ill watch a drive or two and see what happens hope ben isnt trying to play through anything serious
x200b

it is a proven fact the more beat up roethlisberger gets the better he plays
am i stupid or did romo just say that cooper had a juicy ass
why havent we utilized the new lb at all i thought he was good in the run
im glad minkah stayed home on that play
feels like the d has no sense of urgency
stop dropping dupree and watt in coverage fuck me
lmao getting absolutely destroyed by a 26 team with a fourth string qb playing in his first game
let us not forget this very good cowboys team is fighting for first place in their division no shame in having to struggle against them
finally bud nice
all yall who were talking shit before this game knowing full and well the steelers love a good trap game you did this to us

s
cowboys in their last three games combined 22 points
cowboys today 16 points in 23 quarters
last thing we need is ben getting knocked around more just let him call what he sees
i bet randy called every play on that drive
3rd and short better bomb it out
wide open conner down low instead take a terrible hit and throw a shit pass
villanueva needs help hes gonna get ben killed
bens gonna be sore tomorrow
anyone who is at all surprised at this performance must be new here
is ben really the only thing keeping randy employed here
how many times can we have a lb guard a wr
are we playing against tom brady what the fuck is this
how do all these 3rd stringers always turn into tom brady against us
getting absolutely carved up by an aaf qb is such a steelers thing to do lmao
my boss is a cowboys fan and he was expecting the worst for this game but i told him dont worry the steelers will find a way to disappoint me
none of us were joking when we said last week that we would make this guy look like brady
the effort isnt there dallas wants it more frankly they deserve it gotta show every week
cam sutton scared to make the tackle smh besides haden the corners playing scary make the tackle missing hilton right now
its so easy for them they are doing whatever they want with us making zero adjustments
im not sure if the offense or the defense should be more embarrassed just pathetic
were playing a 4th string qb yes but remember butler is a moron nothing but zone constantly dropping dupree and watt in coverage and getting zero pass rush
wow so they cant score and they give up 615 in one possession

not looking good our d is not good against the run anymore
while i do like watson as a qb he is a terrible actor and that aws commercial is unwatchable
its like this team doesnt even care about the one seed they talk about how the super bowl is the goal and yet they play down to every opponent

the defense has been completely exposed by this point its not good enough without bush
dallas studied our game plan and we kept it the same because we underestimated them we studied their game plan and they changed it even if we win this game is obnoxious
god damn i want dallas to choke bring the game back already
sigh shooting themselves in the foot
steelers arent even trying anymore
god bless juju man
i think we havent won a ball game in cowboys stadium yet correct me if im wrong
niiiiice juju okay d time to step up
for the 4th quarter lets stop playing like clark kent and put on our superman outfit
juju cannot be a cap casualty next year thread
yet another game where once juju is targeted the tides turn
he walked right through the center
special teams today
0 boswells fault the first one was on him but that defender waltzed in and bos had no shot
do we have a special teams coach or are we just winging it
just kick the ball out of the back of the end zone you dumb fucks
i feel like we ask this almost every game how does danny smith still have a job hes never been anything more than average and pretty consistently a breakdown awful game once a month
fuck this special team play they are cost us this game
give me a competitive loss im cool with that but we get this shit all the time
fuck zeke and fuck this gilbert guy jam their dick into the dirt
minkah ffs go down for the touchback
x200b

minkah fitzpatrick so goood
m i n k a h
minkah doing a lot lately
shoulda stayed in the end zone
bout time for a 98 yard maple td
why didnt he fall in the end zone adrenaline
another juju 97 yard td
dear baby jesus in a tux let the good guys got get a td
wheres the guy who said fire tomlin and cut minkah
juju 90 yd td
so that was a 19 yard return for minkah
come on steelers you gotta pull through cowboys have the worst defense in the nfl dont let the cowboys win ffs
i swear there are people on this sub who downvote any comment that mentions the name cowher even if something completely innocuous and factual like bill cowher was the coach like time pittsburgh and dallas played in the super bowl its as if they think even acknowledging that we had a coach prior to mike tomlin is somehow a criticism of tomlin like that scene in the lion king when scar lost his shit over people saying the name mufasa
wheeeew we got lucky there
you would never know claypool was a rookie by the way he runs his mouth out there
i love refbal
really wish we had made that extra point
defense needs to stand up and destroy
we should be winning thanks to special teams gaffes
man claypool was wide on that 2nd down
that papadia looks gross
defense is going to be crucial this drive
tj with 3 deflections today

tj swatt
sack this fourth string reject
great now someone make a goddamn play
everybody take this commercial break for a breather and get your heart ready for anything
their 4th stringer is a million times better than rudolph
on one hand were in a great position to take the lead and win on the other hand this game has been ass
feed juju
this might just be a renegade moment coming up
we are getting bailed the fuck out this game
didnt expect that from ebron
ebron is a monster
fuck of course we dont get the 2
fuck ok this is all defense now
chuckles

im in danger
quick shout out to the refs
oh mama im in fear for my life
from the long arm of the law
lawman has put an end to my running
and im so far from my home
oh mama i can hear you a crying
and youre so scared and all alone
hangman is coming down from the gallows
and i dont have very long
lets go defense
defense still playing soft we are getting burned in zone and man2man
getting destroyed in fantasy ill gladly take the l if it gives us a w against the cowboys
really wish we had those pats
two types of fans in the world

me twirling my terrible towel in the living room screaming at the tv

my wife sitting quietly on the couch with her terrible towel over her head and eyes cause she cant watch this haha
tj watt is the true dpoy it might not show in every stat
cammmmmmmm lets goooooo
i would just love to have one sunday where i can relax and have a nice blowout
you could almost hear cam say i aint losing this shit as he went through the line
very concerning to be this close to a 26 team
why tf do you go for it
wtf tomlin wtf
no field goal to make it an eight point lead wow
why not kick the fg and go up 8
what the actual fuck what the actual fuck
yeesh and now not kicking the field goal is a big issue after 1 play
a field goal makes it an 8 point lead theyd need a td and 2 point just to push ot why the hell did we not do that

absolutely awful decision kick the field go up 8 and take more time off the clock with the kickoff
holding on tj lol
lol if we lose this is all on coaching
dont stop the count
like what the fuck guys this was supposed to be a second bye week
lol minkah there again wow
x200b

steelers stay unbeaten

win 2419
i gotta say everyone anouncers and other fans pretending this is shocking you could see we were gonns do this from a mile away
minkah
same exact play as last week with fitzpatrick
game ball to minkah holy deja vu
my heart needs a bye week
can the refs call a hold that guy nearly killed tj
i hope this means 2 weeks from now were going to slaughter the jags since weve now had our trap game
the toll on my heart these past 3 sundays might need to visit the docs
i just want to point out that i still want to pick updraft a real ben replacement the idea that if ben goes down and were stuck with rudolphdobbs after the amazing season weve had thus far is scary af
bens deep ball has been off all year
if this drive doesnt show that randy needs firing idk what anything means ben is doing everything himself on one leg
i went pee and missed the td guess ill just listen to the rest of the game from the bathroom
this game thread is a dumpster fire of negativity already we have the best team in the league but a real shitshow of a fanbase at times
were already in the 4th stop the count
if this sub coached our team we would be 07
got to catch that
bro you gotta catch that
catch that bro
claypool shouldve had that one not on ben
claypool has to catch that
as long as that stuff is called evenly im okay with it
i hate this damn allstate ad i keep thinking its gonna be inception related its not im disappointed fuck you allstate
interviewer what went into the decision in making gilbert the starter

mccarthy i just thought about which guy i would miss the least
fuck i forgot to play renegade before the game its my fault i was doing homework im so sorry do i play it now or what
this thread does not believe in the power of positive thinking
with that lb alex highsmith sack pittsburgh has registered at least 10 in 65 consecutive games which is the longest active streak in the nfl the 65game streak is the longest in regularseason franchise history
fucking conservative i see
stop with the shit play calling
we got an update
fucking annoying play calling
steelering intensifies
fucking hate randy sphincter
can ben just go hurry up in the first quarter
so um can i start to worry now
i wonder how long its going to take randy and the two time to break down this formidablecowboys defense

like if we fire randy does the two time walk away or something is that why he has to be here
can ben call the plays
colquitts not doing that
randy you fucking donut
these run backwards 7 yards and dump the pass off 3 yards and loose 4 yards plays need burned out of the playbook
that ad for irregular heartbeats was literally made for steelers fans it had to have been
i hate how our playcalling just feels like guessing every week how do we not have a plan to attack one of the worst defenses in the league getting stuffed two drives in a row the start a little embarrassing
tuitt just like casually pushed that lineman out of the way and walked up to tackle the running back
so when do we turn the d loose to brutalize an aaf qb
i swear if we lose to the fucking cowboys
etrade if this is your idea of

me well it is now
omg youre telling me when we are aggressive and pass we move the ball im shocked
mcfarland as a third down back why
offensive line is getting no push
why are they having so much trouble running against a team with a piss poor run defense youre crazy if you tell me this isnt a trap game
im all for getting mcfarland some plays but you have to have you best players on the field until its out of reach

3 and 4th andt 1 and you dont have conner out there
mccarthy alright theyll punt it here an why is the offense still out there timeout timeout theyll actually go for it timeout
only randy fichtner could be outcoached by mike nolan
why are we incapable of dominating its honestly inexcusable
offense weak as fuck again its a legit problem right now since the 2q of titans game theyve put together like 5 solid looking drives
ive seen this trap game coming weeks in advance
fuck mondeaux
same failed run 3 plays in a row we have so many pieces on offense that we can be creative with wtf fichtner
get mondeauxs bum ass outta the game
i dont want to see us run the ball with anyone but connor
what a waste of a half
i am straight up not having a good time
hey can we play like an undefeated team now please
typical steeler football play down to a team who should be 16 fucking dumb something has to change with this offense and not like the d is doing us any favors
so we put our best rush defender on a burner of a wr
tj watt guarding ceedee lamb
their o line seems to be getting away with an awful lot of holding so far
watt should not have been on lamb
they cant score againt the eagles or the fucking football team but they score against our league best defense what the fuck
i said to take tj out of coverage after gilbert ran to his side of the field the first time he was in coverage next time hes in coverage they put him on ceedee for a td lol butler is a fucking idiot i swear
we play to the team against us no wonder why we are playing horribly its dallas
maybe theyll wake the fuck up now
this is pathetic
3rd and 7 you gotta make sure your best passrusher is in coverage on a receiver
crazy idea on 3rd down lets rush the passer with the best pass rusher in the game rather than have him be one on one with their fastest wide reciever
meh were a comeback team
this game is making my hangover worse
coaching staff clearly treated this like a bye week and thought they could fart their way to a win
the offense starting off slow more often than not needs to be fucking addressed

whether its play calling or tempo i dont know if ben is that much better calling is own plays just fucking let him
where the fuck is conner
spent all week looking at memes of our record instead of watching film or preparing
im just here for the over reactions
why the fuck is our best pass rusher covering a wide receiver
ok the fun is over get your heads in the game
ahhh wondered when the annual fire everyone game would come
if yinz seriously didnt expect this to happen you havent been watching steeler football for the past 10 years

typical trap game just substitute browns for cowboys itll come down to the wire like always
can ben just say fuck fichtner and go off script now please
if you dont love this then you dont love steelers football
thats a better throw than any of the ones roethlisberger has made today
what in the blue flaming fuck are we doing
i mean that was a sick play lol
cant wait to go down 170 and then do run run 2 yard pass
randy got the perfect run run dump off ready to go
what a fucking embarrassment no life out there at all
that one was all luck stop playing padded zone you fucking cocksucker this is all on butler and fictner
got to score on our possession
why cant we just beat the cowboys what is it about this fucking team
imagine this is the game where berry actually punts well for once and we fucking blow it
im almost more afraid of random backup qbs than i am of mahomes and lamar
lol im not hating and keeping it 100 we will not win shit in the playoffs if we are this fucking conservative its like the playcalling is for a rookie who is playing his first nfl game
dont forget that dallas will get the ball to start the 2nd half this could be a 3 possession game pretty soon
ahhh

the classic slow start to a shit team and a nobody at qb

one of these games

fucking great
i truly do not understand how tomlin can see how well this offense plays when ben is calling the plays and how effecient they are and then just give play calling duties back to randy let randy draw up the plays let ben call them
the long throws just arent there this season
pulling his jersey the whole way
tony romo hates us and its obvious
so apparently you can hold receivers now and it is just fine fuck these refs in the ass with a rusty rake
pouncey is garbage today hes getting destroyed all game
why the fuck isnt that a penalty
i dont need this random cowboys equipment manager arguing for an incomplete call lmao
ben a gangster lol
ben playing better with 1 leg

wtf
the lighting in that stadium sucks ass
ebron coming in clutch on third down
holy shit its like we have a hof qb with how many passes we keep completing

someone tell randy
thats my fucking quarterback
ben 2 minute

classic
finally all it took was hurt ben
robotic ben activated
amazing when ben is hurt they start calling smart pass plays and stop with whatever the fuck they were doing before
big shit from big ben
bosgod is now just boswell
thats what happens when ben is calling the plays


but also


oh god
no boz no
im worried hes done for the rest of the game after watching that locker room walk
of course we miss the pat
boz misses and ben goes to the locker room
locker room hopefully nothing serious i certainly hope he didnt pull a carson wentz in 2018 and go out for the year to score one td
and a missed xp we always do that too in these trap games its really weird that it even effects our kicking game as well
people on this sub will legit say fichtner had any hand in making that drive work

hey the truth is he didnt
pissed off or hurt ben is always so methodical if he stays in we can expect a few more tds
you know we are about to get a turnover and see mason in the game to end the half because that would be perfect irony for them working out that bruise on ben early
sorry kia that was a 180 once you land any further spinning is irrelevant
i really hope ben is ok i dont think were gonna manage with out him
2 yard passes are back in the menu boys


its the only thing on the menu
minkah master of being in the right place at the right time and thats awesome
maon lucky as hell that wasnt a pick jfc
just run it up the middle and call timeout i have no faith in this turd
i hope big ben is okay and can come back to the game
yeah fuck you rudolph
trap game
the absolute wad of gum from the steelers specials team coach i forgot his name lol
holy shit
wizard of fucking boz
sorry boswell i take it back
sometimes penalties are a friend
that false start gave boz an idea to where he needed to aim all part of the master plan
no more punting field goal every 4th down
lmao boswell just had to get warmed up
maybe we should just false start every extra point and let him kick from 55 indoors
lets fucking go haha thanks for the false start
boz does not miss three times in a row
boz gotta buy cam dinner now
oh ye of little faith in the bosgod
bosgod giveth and bosgod taketh away
youre forgiven christopher
come on halftime adjustments i love me some pittsburgh halftime adjustments
man rudolph sucks ass
lets all just appreciate the bozgod
can someone perform the lachman test on ben please where is our pt at
somehow we are only down by 4 pts hopefully big ben is alright and we can get this dub
can we just give dobbs masons uniform
dont care about anything ben needs to come back
ok so ive calmed down and i think ben went to the locker room early for a brace or injection and did not expect to get the ball back it will be fine
id ben is out id want to see dobbs next week i thought he was better than rudolph
id rather lose this game than bring back ben if hes not 100 that being said pls be ok ben
a why does everyone think ben is done this game he went to the locker room early because there was only a minute left in the had and every minute counts when it comes to pain management

b i dunno if you guys are watching the rnfl game thread but so many people dont understand the rules on a false start
they just said that ben is coming back
big ben revenge tour incoming
it doesnt matter what the opponent record is steelers will almost always play close games win or lose
he doesnt even have a limp lets go
ben walking back onto the field
big ben what knee
bens angry cowboys dont like him when hes angry
minor injury ben about to take this game to the next level
looks like it was just a tweak no limp and hes not wearing a brace either thank god now lets stop being cute and put these cowgirls away
id rather have dobbs as the backup over mason at least you get a different look with a mobile qb
nice play by minkah there
minka gonna rip that dudes leg out
we are looking porous af
to be fair dallas is coming off of their 4th consecutive bye week
did romo just say you see the juicy ass
gilbert just stared death in the face there
this is the steelers defense huh getting torched by a 4th stringer from the aaf
how many steelers does it take to bring down a second string rb
this is the trap game isnt it
i dont want to see this d vs kc
we are literally lining lbs up in man coverage on wrs on the majority of plays not zone mismatches

their oline is doing a really good job
why arent they blitzing this guy every play and putting pressure on him hes a fourth stringer lets see him perform under pressure
cowboys are just playing a very clean game they had the one turnover but other than that nothing of significance i dont even think they have a penalty besides an offsetting one
we keep playing one too many linebackers
21 point second half incoming
bens comming out in a leather gimp suit
dont worry guys i changed sweatshirts
the steelers always start slow this season for whatever reason

we still got this
remember gimp ben is the best ben
td to tie it and then go from there
those 1 yard drag routes

what are they expecting there thats not even a short passing run game play
34 time for a long pass
i hate this fucking stadium going all the way back to super bowl 45 have we ever won here
what the actual fuck are these playcalls
another god damn 3 and out
3rd and 4 bomb
im in pain too ben im in pain too
does ben need to bring out the boot
well that drive was underwhelming as fuck
man i was hoping i could just chill do some cleaning and casually watch the game

but now i am glued and will be surprised if we can win this we look like garbage in every phase except special teams bc of boz fg and berry punting pretty good
has dallas punted yet maybe once
i am not having fun
this is what i thought derrick henry would do to us
wtf was that tackle
theyve already run for over 100 against us man i miss alualu and hilton
a field goal here ends it our offense has been so bad they wont overcome a 2 possession game
we are getting fucking embarrassed by a fourth string qb let that sink in guys we are also against one of the worst defenses in the league
this game is increasingly unpleasant to watch
get in his fucking way and make a god damn stop sutton
were so lucky that theyre just taking fgs and essentially keeping us in it
we aint deserve this one guys
shades of ryan mallet fucking kill me
even if we win this doesnt look good at all talk about getting exposed
dude even if we come back and winthis is fucking pathetic
ok ben gunslinger time
thank god mccarthy has no balls
why are they seemingly so consistently bad against teams with losing records what is up with this shit
dallas has had the ball 10 more minutes than the steelers so maybe maybe the steelers have 3 drives left i dont think they score on 2 of them
weve been relying on talent to bail out our dumbshit coordinators the past decade this is what happens
i honestly think its time to move on from ben the league has to many dynamic qbs if we had a justin herbert we could easily beat the cheifs our defense is just gassed from carrying us
claypool is a rookie but still you gotta catch those
juju is fucking money cash fucking money
choo choo smith schuster
ok juju

lets go
juju is putting this team on his back
juju better get the game ball this week
in juju we trust
defense please please please just stop dallas
jujus back baby
juju ate that drive you love to see it
all my friends hate 94 on the cowboys
nice call taking the penalty yards on the kickoff
those two points may come back to bite us
you cant really blame boz for that the long snapper was asleep at the wheel there
how is that not leverage
instead of 3 we need 7 again we love self imposed pressure
he jumped the long snapper what the actual fuck wheres the flag
he pushed off the snappers back what am i missing here why is there no flag
imagine blaming boz for that pat
imagine blowing out a team youre supposed to blow out ool
hope bos doesnt get his kickoff blocked
everyone on special teams needs to lose their jobs
fire danny smith
steelers putting the special in special teams
1 thing goes right 50 others go wrong lol
wow thats how you take the wind out of our sails
ok lets fucking pull it together now
gg steelers losing to pitiful cowgirls after beating almighty ravens week before who couldve predicted that
best defense
why are we getting killed by a fucking 26 team
dst is taking the week off
this is fucking crap
just kick it out of the endzone another points causes by the st
just quit now
could we not zoom in on someones eye
one team thinks they should win one team wants to win
why not just take the touchback
minkah you should have stayed in but fucking interception when we needed it
minkah fitzclutch
well at least we got the interception i guess
ben to juju for 97 theyre due
minkah is the best thing to happen to the steelers since big ben what a fucking impact he has had in one and a half years
jujus due for 95 yard td
we do good when i have the game offso do i turn it back on after that pick to watch
minkha was a neck gaiter guy even before covid og
ok time to prove their metal shake things off and put together a 98yard drive
it is mind boggling to me that nfl wide receivers drop passes right to them
might as well make ray ray the wr1
please gimme a 86 yarder to claypool or juju
wow really bens never had a 99 yard td drive deebo did that in one play
shout out to dallas for giving up every penalty possible this drive
eject him
guys im gonna stick my head up my ass and hide under my bed lemme know when were done thx
refs are doing their best for us
jim nantz has been consistently wrong jesus
no one blocking crawford man
pats are actually gonna cost us this game
could really use those two points right about now
wed be up right now if it wasnt for those damn meddling extra points
crawford made it across again lucky we got that fg off our special teams is straight trash right now
lets see if our defense can hold its a one point game with time left
my mom is a cowboys fan and shes being absolutely insufferable
steel curtain time not black and gold buttercream cupcake time
that papa johns ad just raised my cholesterol from looking at it
maybe on this drive the steelers wont play the swiss cheese zone and the cowboys cant pick up 15 yards at a time
that cheeseburger papadilla thing looks fucking vile
if there was ever a time for the d to force a 3 and out
this team is going to destroy my liver
defense getting another turnover here
remember the time the stillers make people have heart problems
1 stop please

lets go defense
come on ben defense did their job lets take this w

lfg
some respect for 99
finafuckinglly a stop
d did their job lets finish it
i am actively playing renegade steelers boys act accordingly
connor take an early flight home or something
really appreciating the clutch refball here
another lucky break for us
saved by the refs
roughing the passer for ben is this really happening
lmao this win is gonna feel like a loss
ebron thats a big guy to be hurdling people
too much time
welp up to you defense again lol
man now we arent gonna make our 25 point streak

s
i have faith in the defense i have faith in the defense maybe if we chant it it shall come true
alexa play renegade
now the defense will feast bud or tj will strip sack and seal the game
claypool needs some serious work on catching still
fuck way too obvious on that read big ben

we left too much time on the clock if our defense cant get it done here then thats it
hold em defense theyre one dimensional now
lets go defense
another int please
defense take my energy
after the catch is killing us
keith butler rn okay guys lets not change a damn thing soft zone no matter what
man we need tyson and hilton way more then anyone wants to admit
worst matchup of the season and somehow the most stressful game so far
keith butler is the guy you play in madden that runs cover 4 show 2 on every single down
its not a steelers game if we arent having heart attacks right
it aint over i still have faith in our defense
tj watt have my fuckin babies
this game took 10 years off my life
nice i knew this was a win the entire time
ez win no doubts whatsoever
this garret kid is tough though i can appreciate his game today
i am going to impregnate my wife with twins and name them cam and tj
so probably that should have been a horse collar
this fucking team lmao
championship teams always find a way
kicking the fg wouldve so much more beneficial
why dont you just kick a fg there
tomlin is a fucking idiot
what the fuck
kick the fucking field goal
why didnt we go for fgup by 8
waitwe didnt just kick the field goal
what the fuck i still dont understand not kicking a fg someone please explain
i mean i can understand maybe being hesitant to kick the fg given the fact that some guy just gets clean through right up the middle every single time but why is the alternative the slowestdeveloping running play in history

like randy i need you to queue up a run where we run horizontally 8 yards before trying to get upfield
idiotic not to take the fg there its almost like tomlin was butthurt that the play to claypool didnt work and he stubbornly stuck to his guns
you cant coach scared you have to trust your kicker and your blocking to make that kick to ice it
a field goal shouldve been the playcall
field goal wins game wtf
kick the fucking field goal fuck that reasoning romo gave
this game should be over
this week has been the longest year of my life
they forgo the opportunity to make it an 8 point game and then give up a thirty yard catch on first down jesus h christ
what was smart about not kicking the field goal
theyre just not gonna call false start on that rt are they
yeah you have the possibility of blocking the fg but also consider we cant run it on short downs
holy shit wheres the holding call
imagine if we were going to at worst case scenario go to ot if they scored a 2pt conversion
wheres the hold on tj
the most 2020 steelers finish
this is some major deja vu with two completely different quality of opponent lmao
no reason for this game to be this close
didnt we see this last week
lets fucking gooooo
andddddddd stillllllll undefeatedddd
minkah player of the game god damn thank you so much
same exact ending as last week why do they do this to us
god minkah you beautiful son of a bitch
being a steelers fan has literally taken years off my life
every game will end in a goal line pass bat down
minkah again that was ugly but beats the alternative 80
they said yall enjoyed the ravens ending wanna see us do it again
the most steelerest finish dishing out heart attacks and aneurysms

this team is keeping cardiologists open single handedly
team of destiny

the fact we have 0 points against this defense after a full quarter is super concerning
the fact some of you guys are saying trap game just shows we arent that good i dont give a shit you dont play this bad against a team thats 26 with their fourth stringer

this commercial is longer than any of our drives so far
rudolph is not the future shouldve traded for a vet to sit behind ben until we drafted his replacement mason cant read a defense to save his life throwing out routes and check downs doesnt win games
im not as worried of rudolph playing as i am about rudolph listening to randys play calling
well this all hinges on ben coming out or not

thats the game
see what happens when we dont drop dupree back in coverage
its pretty obvious now that alualu is missed massively
lets not act like the officials are the cause here peoplewe all knew this was going to happen
we couldve been up by 8 and it wouldnt have mattered if they scored a td dumbest decision of the season to not take the fg
our offense only does well when ben calls the shots please put randy on thin ice
guys guys hear me out i have magic doritos last week against the ravens we were doing shit until i started eating my delicious naco chips and our defense finally stepped up and we came back this week were doing garbage i grab my doritos in last resort and we score 2 td i wont let yall down
yall are some miserable motherfuckers
this is bad the steelers will never win another game in the history of their existence fire everyone and fold the franchise
holding defense

hey awesome

illegal formation offense

aw man
if ben isnt able to return do we make fire tomlin posts now or do we wait a few games


s
offense stop sucking

defense stop sucking

fucking dicks
im worried these commentators are gonna choke on dallass cock soon
was that not a tackle out of bounds
god i hate that this game has to come down to this but lets get it done an ugly win is still a win
i really dont want this to come down to the defense having to make a stop they havent all day dallas has moved the ball with ease and only stalled in the red zone again theyve punted once
this has to be the least fun 80 team to watch ever
also can romo not openly root for his old team that was terrible just a terrible as starting 26 how about them cowboys
captain fit fuck
ben lamar jackson roethlisberger
theres the obligatory double coverage long ball
calling a draw on 2nd and long should be a penalty
bro how do u drop that
mapletron gotta bring that one in through both his hands and he short armed it a little
this is gonna come down to the last possession in the 4th isnt it
good no call said no one ever

i really hope we dont make this 4th string qb look like brady
lets go defense make some plays
i feel like the steelers game themselves out of competition sometimes oh we watched last weeks footage so lets scheme like this to stop it never accounting for the other team to address weaknesses just come out and play standard steeler ball no gimmicks just normal schemes and force them to work around us now we just chase our tails this game should be an easy win and i think by the end of it we will all relax but these trap games are legit
nelson you gotta run towards zeke my guy you cant wait for him to run past the first down marker
whos surprised anyone
if we lose my friend whos a cowboys fan is gonna talk so much crap to me lol
i dont like the way this game feels
you cannot stop garrett gilbert you can only hope to contain him
hey this is our bye go easy now
theres the first of many sacks today
gilbert yelling at cooper already lol
run run pass punt
whats with all these run plays
great play calling lol
the spread worked all of last week and were back to shitty screens gotta love it
i think ill come back for the second half
some great play calling to start off
lets just let ben call plays again
god a 3 and out
shut up tony romo
its fucking ridiculous that we all knew theyd look like this and they still do
awful playcalling
fuck randy fichtner
lets get ben some empty sets and let him call the plays for a bit shall we
it feels like the steelers do this shit on purpose
from now on thats how you punt berry
love me a steelers screen on 3rd and 16 inhales and exhalesreminds me of home
screen run 2 yard pass i hate when we get cute
lmao i fucking knew as soon as cooper caught that first catch we were gonna lay an egg its alright well get it going
i know it gets said all the time but ben should really call the offensive plays with randy acting as an advisor this offense looks anemic at times
dude what the fuck how do we keep doing this shit year after fucking year
throw the ball past the chains and dont wait until 3rd down to try it
imagine thinking we can compete in a shootout with kc
lol this dude is a one read qb he should not be looking good
well that was a fucking awful quarter of course i expected the 70 steelers to beat a depleted cowboys team but so far we dont look like we want this game
imagine running on 2nd and long often enough that its a tendency that teams can prepare for

how is randy fitchner still in gainful employment
joe haden returning punts thats interesting
why haden
haden hm interesting
ah haden was back cause steelers had d on the field when cowboys made that late switch
you know its bad when we can so clearly tell that ben has taken over playcalling
i hope mcfarland is just gettin snaps because they want to

havent seen anything about conner
did we have haden catch a punt as a bit lol
where is connor wtf
why run it again
conner may have had the 1st down on the pass and would have gotten it twice on the runs
they need to just forget about draws why cant we put a blocker in the backfield
boswell was booting 60 yarders in warmups why are we not kicking this
if conner is hurt they havent said a damn thing yet
i swear all these crime shows are the same the commercials put me to sleep
is conner hurt
put a fullback in the fucking backfield you stupid cunts
thats fucking disgusting garbage
jesus christ wtf we had 5 straight completions and cant get a yard running it up the gut 3 times
hey you know how theyve stuffed every fucking draw lets run more draws someone hire a sniper to fucking ice randy please
andddd still no push
trap game
dude fuck fichtner
what the fuck
lol always playing down to a team that they should be massacring classic steelers
fichtner blows
fuck randy fichtner
3 draws for 1 yard lets do it again randy just let ben call the plays
99 is awful
it didnt work the first two fucking times so why the fuck did you run it the 3rd god someone needs smacked upside the head
of course mondeaux would fail
im shocked mondeaux let somebody run right past him shocked i tell you
getting ran on by a 5th string qb
are we playing against lamar
how are letting fucking garrett gilbert run the ball
if we could stop running the ball out of gun on obvious run playsthat would be great
we could stop lamar from running but not gabbert
we always suck against the cowboys no matter how bad they are and its infuriating
why cant we play full games ever
missing hilton so much
i see we have decided to play to our opponents level today
99 is the worst player on our team
with reaction times like that tj watt might have a career in drag racing after football
pathetic absolutely fucking embarrassing
can we all double check that we are doing the same gameday traditions that we did last week one of you is fucking up our win karma
ok were far enough into this game that im starting to get worried
i knew the steelers would underestimate garrett gilbert
mahomes is going to fuck us into oblivion
bruh the false start was obvious there
lmaooo and now we have to climb out of a hole
our offense is consistently measurably worse when fichtner is calling plays than when ben is doing it at the line how much longer do we need to see it for
im so embarrassed rn
lmao tj watt on lamb big brain butler
this istruly pathetic
false start x2
trap game trap game
do not put tj on a wide receiver
our secondary is bad bad
lmao its expected offense non existent for 8 quarters now and and the defense getting embarrassed by a fourth string qb
why is watt in coverage so much every time he is in coverage the edge is never set
well done boys somehow making the cowboys look like the undefeated team

truly impressive how we can fuck this up even by steeler standards
make him beat us with his arm
puts a de on ceedee lamb
i had low hopes coming into this game third road game after tenbal bad team had trap all over it

but didnt think itd be this bad
this is such a fucking joke every steelers fan whos been watching this team for the last decade knew this shit was coming every analyst who hasnt that 135 made sense this is fuckin disgraceful
time for some more predictable plays hell yea
just once id like this team to just absolutely destroy another team i dont care that were 70 we are not better than the chiefs if our offense cant be consistent enough especially if we meet kansas in the playoffs
run run pass
this has to be a joke
thank god for the block in the back
great offensive gameplan i mean truly what a fucking great job by this coaching staff to prepare this 70 team against a 26 one
guys if we already lost just leave the gdt lol
falcons fan here is it okay if i cheer for yall today since i dont care for the cowboys and their millions of bandwagon fans like lebron james and other celebs that are only fans of theirs because of the cowboys 1990s teams
brosthis is straight up bad lmfao
that was a great play by dallas no matter what you want to say that was a ballsy call
yeah this is headed in a very wrong direction steelers are literally not winning a single part of the game
cowboys playing like its 2016 steelers playing like its 2019
i warned you all that we would blow this

we are
the standart is the standart
lol this is the cowboys super bowl and the steelers are still in the locker room
why cant every game be like the cleveland game last month
just need a ben turnover to end the half
we arent gonna score this half
the secondary is not communicating at all

they didnt pass that off 2 guys go with the 1 receiver
ray ray return td manifesting it
man i never thought id say this but at least with todd fucking haley this offense could put up points get rid of randy let ben call the plays this is said almost every fucking damn week this is absolutely pathetic that this offense continues to do jack shit in the first half of games fuck off
everyone needs to step the fuck up
open up the steelers offense stop being so conservative
nice stadium design lets put huge gaps in the building to blind the players with the sun
can someone smarter than me explain why ben doesnt just no huddle the offense all game

fichtner is so uninspiring as a play caller
we dont play down to teams thats just a myth
fichtner needs to be on the unemployment line how does he keep this job with anemic performances every single week
we need the absolute hell beat out of us if we want to be competitive whatsoever later in the seasonplayoffs this team is way too complacent
this instrumental version of the show must go on by queen is actually pretty awesome
this is fucking embarrassing even if we come back and win this game this seriously hurts our reputation since its on national television
only passing plays from now on please
dj looks like ab out there with his quick shimmy cuts
now we are picking up some steam is ben calling the plays now
sometimes i think ben and randy dont even talk before games
deep breaths guys its still early and were holding them to 3s on mistakes have faith
were never going to get a flag today are we
so first half play calling has been shit again
hurt ben activated
defensive pi and roughing the passer on back to back plays fuck these refs
the hilarious reality that i would take onelegged ben over mason or duck 1010 times
the need to go to shotgun might save this drive
i see some urgency with that big ben hit
everyone worried about ben must not have seen him play injured hes gonna put up 500 yards and 5 tds
hurt ben is the best ben
there we go think the injury woke up the team honestly
i think they gave ben that eskimo water from the waterboy
steelers had all of bens lower body joints replaced by bionic parts years ago

youll never convince me otherwise
fuck even boswells sucks today
what the fuuuuck boswell
this game is fucked
everything sucks
hurt ben is best ben
you choose now boz
the defense is not the problem 10 points in a half not counting the 3 that came from a botched st effort you take that

the offense scoring 6 in 29 minutes fucking problem
now shut up
was ben calling the plays on that drive
get the injury boot of doom
oops boz
jesus christ boswell
of course he misses the extra point
boz bb wyd
ben will be ight
id take a loss go to 71 with ben rather than go 80 and not have ben
fuck the fucking cowboys
pour some tussin on it let it get into the knee
fuck lets hope its nothing serious that hit ben took looked bad
that missed extra point has officially retired the killer bs
i dont understand why we dont let ben cook weve been moving when he throws cowboys are stopping the run
come ooooon that miss is fucking huge
bring out the boot
ps and ts ben is alright i cant watch mason play qb again
boswell too used to shaping his shots to account for wind at outdoor stadiums
thats disappointing but boswell has been absolute money this whole year just how the ball has been rolling today its not our day
welcome to the trap game enjoy your stay
i think ben is really hurt this time guys
fuck here comes rudolph
tony romo should not be allowed to call a cowboys game
minkah fitzpatrick
fuck i hope rudolph has a redemption
ill shit my pants if rudolph scores
damn wish we had ben this drive
captain fat fuck we need you
glad our defense is always there to make big plays
i missed those 15yd per attempt from rudolph
i just got back to the tv why is mason in the game
oh my god i dont miss last year
an offset penalty is a win for dallas it chews 20 seconds off the clock and just results in a mulligan
run the ball and timeout holy shit this pass is gonna get extended to 0
glad dallas called that timeout think it would have been delay of game
why is pittsburghs backup worse than the guy dallas signed this week
mason rudolph looking like mason rudolph
if ben is out that extra point could have been huge
boz god please
just a dumb low percentage play with an awful qb why not just get sure yardage running the ball
make this and you are forgiven for the extra point miss sir
i wish this was like wwe and the lights went off and ben came back out by gawd thats big bens music
redemption time boz
i just came back from dinner to see rudolph tanking like its 2019 somebody please fill me in
boswell looks like hes in 10th grade
does mason rudolph not have any arm strength 38 year old ben has more zip on his throws then mason does
are we icing our own kicker
nailed it yes boz
bosgod works in mysterious ways
bozgawd
lets fucking go boz
boswell taketh and boswell giveth also fuck our first half game plan
bosgod fucks
bosgod i never doubted you
lets fucking go 59 yarder
that was a fucking perfect kick congrats boz
this is why you dont mail it in and take weeks off players get hurt
i forgive you boz
boswell makes up for that missed extra point
thats why hes the goat the gooat
why not hail mary
boz god
what a kick hell yeah boz
boswell
at least ben got some extra time in the locker room
the wizard of boz

praise be
bosgod giveth bosgod taketh away but mostly giveth
wait i thought it was illegal to leap the oline on a fg
i like to thing the false start was on purpose
haha rewarded for being terrible
the velocity on mason rudolphs throws is alarming
cam wanted to boost bozs confidence with the false start to make him kick a harder one thats a true leader right there
ben can have both of my knees for all i care just please be ok
i really dont want to watch lame ass rudolph for the second half sure hope ben is able to come back or we just do wildcat plays or somethingidk
i can not do another round of mason rudolph
why does rudolph only float passes just bullet it
yo im at the game any update on ben
stop dooming guys
heart attack half coming up baby here we go
he said just like 5g it just got real
not even a brace on large benjamin
ben will be back
hes walking back out
the commentators during the half time show just said ben will start the second half and just tweaked his knee
ben likes to be dramatic
ben is the toughest qb in the league that man is a tank
x200b

x200b

ben iced up his knee and is good to go
come on defense get us a stop
i didnt think tyson was such big part last week and this week showing he is
i really enjoyed the first 7 games this one not so much
bruh if i see 99 in on one more play i swear to god
3rd and long please just play it safe and drop everyone into coverage
so no adjustments during halftime surprising
i hope fichtner is out here taking notes because outside runs work better than inside runs
just shit my pants
ok boys gut check time
there is a lot of time left to flip this game around stay positive
what are we doing where is our defense how the hell is dallas with a third string moving the chains
i feel like were locked in on featuring diontae today
we are so ass lol
maybe well wake up in the 4th quarter once were down by two possessions
another 3 and out

ben gets tagged again
i am straight up not having a good time
where the fuck is our line jesus we are swiss cheese letting them fuck up ben
yeah theyre gonna lose to this trash ass team like wtf
lol damn av
i am so fucking sick of those plays on third and less than 5
i feel like maybe we just go for the first down there
check down is wide open and ben decides to sail it fifty yards into double coverage
berry the best player on the field for the steelers so far
i told you ol is garbage today
is randy calling the plays again
just dont see us winning this one were not there today
manifesting that they play renegade in side att
ol is getting beat in the trenches ben not getting enough time to work i guess the titansravens games back to back have taken a toll on them
the whining in here is extra special this week the team is on its third straight road game and had a week 4 bye we just need one big play to switch momentum
3rd and 4 you say theyll be expecting the short playhail mary
can we force a 3 and out for once
even if we win this game the media is gonna trash ben
wtaf
can we get one 3 and out
man it would be nice if we could stop them
cant wait to sleep the next two weeks on the bengals and jaguars too
completely outcoached
they about to pop out a fumble
very considerate of the defense to give ben plenty of time to rest
were beat up tired and on our third straight road game all of this shows
this game hurts us bad no matter what this is crazy
noone has shown up today

just a piece of cake for dallas
im beginning to think this defense is suspect
this team feels different in a bad way since the titans game im hoping this is just a rough patch and they right it by the end of the season

id be okay with losing against the cowboys if we can figure it out by the thanksgiving game
i cant recall a time that weve looked this weak on both sides of the ball just cant get anything going our way
their oline is playing really well sadly
watt and spilane on lambfire butler
they play like fucking pussies omg
make a fucking stop
its really cool that we keep lining lbs up to cover their extremely talented wrs
10 years later and mike tomlin vs mike mccarthy in this building is still not a good thing
im disgusted by how little pressure weve been able to generate they have backup fucking linemen
how many times do you guys think keith butler is gonna put linebackers on receivers im thinking 60 billion times
blitz on every play not like they got much to lose at this point
dunno how you go from top 3 defense in the league to what looks like bottom 5 in one week
we make lamar struggle but gilbert grape is tearing us apart
our cheeks are getting clapped by a 4th string aaf qb
literally just whiffing on tackles absolutely unacceptable
son of a bitch
what a flat performance these guys walked in too cocky
score on our next possession or this is done
death by a thousand cuts
tip to butler figure out man mismatches if youre too stupid to then stop running man coverage every play
this shit is embarrassing maybe it lights a fire and we stop being so fucking complacent
we need to dink and dunk the fuck out no more deep shots because ben cant hit those
this is your reminder that gilbert was used as a corner to cover amari cooper in practice and were making this scrub look like joe namath
psh we got this
lads im not feeling good about this one
terrible coaching on both sides what a joke such an embarrassment
why does a 10 point deficit seem insurmountable right now
idk if i can have any faith left if this drive isnt a td
20 yards biggest gain so far damn
there you go juju
lead us to victory daddy schuster
i keep saying it and no one ever agrees but juju is our best wr
when all else fails juju is the answer
i love juju so much so fucking clutch when we need him

juju saving this fucking game what a player pay him all the moneys
theres the steelers i was expecting
lets go juju
pump fake td the ben special
fuckin love you juju
juju ben boswell and washington are the only ones who wanna win apparently lol
juju should be getting at least 15 passes thrown to him every single game makes no sense that he doesnt
god damn it canaday
juju built different
should have went for 2 smh
canaday is dog shit
outclassed in special teams today
lol man wtf
are you fucking kidding me
thats insane wtf should be down by 2
i have no words
canaday wanna block
special teams bad
juju for touchdowns
my opponent in fantasy this week has bosgod so i have that going for me
it should be 1917
oh for fucks sake
how is that legal
idk why their special teams is blowing through our line so far this game
they are making up for no fans with twice the ads

d is gonna get a 3 and out and well score another td
how are people blaming boz for that lol
danny smith is gonna be chewing a few extra pieces of gum over the next week special teams has been atrocious tonight
special teams have been trash
boswell needs to learn how to tackle from pat mcaffee
just getting murdered on special teams
you cant make this shit up
this is so deflating
of fucking course
steelers havent done a damn thing right all game
heads need to fucking roll if we lose this no excuse
from here on out just kick the ball out of bounds its clear this squad is outclassed on special teams
wtf is this game i want to believe we are sb caliber and then we do shit like this
tomlin needs to clear house at the coordinator level all three are holding this team back
can our defense fucking do anything

i go to feed my dogs super quick after we get a blocked extra point again and they are knocking on the door of the red zone

holy shit were gonna fucking blow this huh
what the hell happened to our run defense
special teams has cost us 2pts and 2 great returns
this game is so deflating tom brady is getting a 4 game suspension
did we finally play a good team lol
coaches are so bad
2 special team plays completely fucked us
lol undrafted rookie free agent shutting down this defense
its obvious that were missing bush anyone know if williamson is active
how is our defense shitting the bed against one of the worst offenses in the league lead by a fucking fourth string qb in his first start wtaf
minkah
lets fucking goooo we needed that
well 90 yards to take the lead

98 yards to victory
but he could take a knee right
have they called a single penalty on dallas that has mattered
now we have to score we cant stop dallas at all on offense and we need to force them to throw or something but even that feels hard
thats our first round pick
dont do that dont give me hope
thank god for fitzburgh
im sure randys playcalling will be perfectly reasonable on this drive
i liked what minkah did there only because hes proven to house call consistently hes got the ed reed greenlight
tony romo is so hard for the cowboys
big ben fuck it diontae down there somewhere
we have to make a statement with this drive
a lot of people here forget how many games bradys won by 3 points on trips to superbowls
saved by the fucking flag
i love refball
wow we got saved
eject the bastard
well thats 2 calls that went our way lol
get ejected
what the actual fuck is this game
this is too much stress from a 26 team where do i file a complaint
wtf is nantz talking about
damn im sick of romo
youd think tony still plays for the cowboys
it actually wasnt that bad he was trying to push away his hand but from the other angle it looked like he was going for body
is miami good at playing football


or is miami bad at playing football
that azmiami game looks like a banger
every snap announcer try to guess what bens doing and is wrong every time jus shut up dude
gotta go for it since they arent calling the leaping shit
im surprised how off the o is today
half quarter to go also known as an eighth to go
alright down one lets get a stop and win this game d
one or both of those extra points woulda been mighty useful
this is where our d has to make a play and not after dallas goes into our redzone
time to put the clamps on em boys
block fucking crawford how the fuck is he consistently jumping over
thank you holy fuck
aight d had time to recoup lets get a stand here
come on defense we need you to get that ball 1 more time
defense gonna have to come up with some more magic
this is the drive the defense can dictate what conversation were all having this week
lets go defense
oooooooh he said redskins
make em punt once guys
i would have never expected us to only have 1 sack at this point in the game
can the run d just look like it did two weeks ago for one drive one drive
finally mondeaux
the mandeauxlorian finally did something
boswell fg to win it
this is only their second punt
lol second punt of the game from a fourth string qb
i wanna watch the game so bad but every time i turn it on bad shit happens
if we get a td we should go for 2 right
this game has taken years off my life but we are in good position to pull it out
the luckiest flag ever
again the flag coming in clutch
holy shit the zebras are practically handing this to pittsburgh but also fuck you dallas for taking cheap shots at our quarterback
hit the qb in the head and its always been a penalty
i absolutely hate that rule but it is in fact a penalty and ill take it
holy shit what a lucky break those first three plays were trash
its crazy the refs have to help a team thats 70 against a team thats 25 mindblown
that boy diontae moves like jelly on a sunday morning
you want the td here
a lot of time left on the clock
hahahaha oh shit ebron
leap frog ebron
mario jumping sound
go for it
ebron is my best friend
big boy ebron
lets goooooooooo thats typical steeler football right here
that fucking hurdle
ebron
hopefully that doesnt bite us in the ass
alright defense its now or never
too much time dont trust anyone right now
gotta scheme juju open there today is not claypools day
bababooey
dallas had 3 timeouts its not like we were going to run that whole time off
x200b

roethlisberger has over 300 yards 3 tds and 0 interceptions
lol getting ptsd from 2016
anyone else just laughing hysterically about this game
mondeauxs play cant be overstated
my heart bro
claypool needs to hit the jugs machine tomorrow im no nfl receiver but i think he needs to catch some of those
p u c k e r t i m e
also watching this and the miaarz game side by side has been a trip
weve played with fire to much this year
couldnt give us a break this week has to be a nail biter its the steeler way
anyone else getting mad annoyed by tonights commentary or is it just me
they have 3 great receivers dont gamble on pressure too much focus on stopping their receivers cam and tuitt can get pressure on their own theyve got 3 timeouts still they dont have to just go to the sideline
wasnt there a meme earlier in the week that basically called this
billcowherletsgogif
anyone want to meet at the doctors tomorrow
blitz him every snap
god shit joe
game saving play by haden
one more stop
heyward and tuitt
this play decided the game lets go
fucking finally
letsss gooooo cammmmm mmmyyy mannnnnn
lfgggggggggggggg
i hope i wasnt the only one playing renegade
cammmmmm goat of sacks and false starts
cam mf hayden
cammmmmmmm
steel fucking curtain
steel curtain baby
i fucking love cam
renegade
every fucking week
shut your fat mouth mccarthy
r e n a g a d e
i love this team but holy shit im getting gray hair because of them and im only 21
i knew we would win this game this is normal steeler football
ahhhh i got it now fichtner sets us up with horrible playcslling in first halves so this team gets used to working from behind for wins i see whats going on here
i feel like heyward is our best closer watt is awesome but i feel heyward is the most likely to make the huge play on the last drive
imagine the dread of a 5th string qb getting spun around by cam heyward into a tj watt sack
does anyone know a sub where i can do a prehealth checkin before watching games just want to make sure i dont have a heart attack before the next one

thank you dallas for winning this for us
this and last weeks game have been too stressful for my ass
what was that
what the fuck kick the field goal and win
holy shit that was dumb
why didnt we just kick a field goal there
why not kick the damn fg
i dont know about that i woulda liked an eight point game
that was dumb
hahahahahaha i want to fucking die
if we were gonna go for it then why not take a timeout and carefully come up with a play
not only no field goal but we go to the side wtf
i love connor but that play with him is retired would literally rather throw it
i cant believe mike did that what a total and complete idiot stupid fuck
going for it seemed really dumb and then after losing 3 yards i realized it was really dumb
theres been horrible examples of end of game time management all year i didnt expect tomlin to provide one kick the field goal
i dont get it
just kick the fg go up 8 let them score 6 and the 2 pt conversion that was the dumbest call in a long time
sunday and praying thanks steelers for always keeping me right on this day of the week
imma chew yall out about taking shit on tomlin in the post game thread watch
we should have iced this game twice
come on d just pick it off and end this nightmare game
not kicking the fg was the dumbest thing
remember when we blew out the browns
missed holding call
tomlin is great for tv ratings keeps other teams in the game until the very end ill give him that
just like last week can we do it twice probably not
i dont agree at all with romo take the points and go up by 8 you at least buy yourself room with the need for a 2 pt conversion
omega hold on tj
how do they not see holding on tj watt almost every play
these last three games have been appropriate for the steelers as they induce heart attacks
watt in the full nelson
juju looking like bart simpson on the bench
minkah
minkah again
eight and zero
lets gooo
we need to learn how to play better in the first half we are causing ourselves so much problems but good win
80
jesus fucking christ i cant do this every week
this game literally took years off my life
we almost lost to aaf legend garret gilbert
another minkah save
doctor woke me up after my heart attacks 80
cowboys make one play and everyone already believes all hope is gone im out see you guys after the steelers win
now to watch the steelers turn their qb into tom brady
ben thought he could take an off day calling plays but randy proves hes too incompetent for even dallas
the standard is the standard we dont prepare for teams with losing records and things of that nature obviously
mason rudolph is not the future
i cant do another half season of rudolph i just cant
i think juju jinxed this game he posted a tiktok of him dancing on the star before the game
here comes fucking garrett marino again
alualu come back bb
how can juju have all this energy with all his tik toking
what this game is truly about romo
why are you the way you are steelers
butler is calling one of the worst games from a dc that ive ever seen just zero adjustments an absolute fucking clown our coordinators are
romo really been sucking the boys dick today and its been annoying
they jumped again
can steelers please score a td so we dont have to see another fg attempt
if they can stop the ravens in this situation they should be able to stop the cowboys
claypools hands looking like clay bricks
so is this another character building game i think its time to really address the inability to play a full 60 min game itll catch up to us some game
mason rudolph was ranked 3232 of qbs last year and we still refuse to find a replacement
reports coming in that the cowboys are demanding the refs stop the count and not count any further touchdowns theyre officially declaring victory
at least biden won
also all of you hating on tomlin this first drive fuck out of here
damn 1 drive on each side and already bitching about tomlin

yall are something else lol
oh no were losing by three fire tomlin we suck sooo bad
this was the most predictable game in steelers history
i dont think this is shocking anyone coming off a game against baltimore always playing down to competition classic steelers really
hire todd haley
the two top teams in the afc got a little turbulence today
really hope we arent stuck with rudolph after ben retires
i feel like rudolph isnt even that bad its fitchners bum play calling that really puts this team in bad spots
ben expected to return for second half per lauten
defense looking like shit rn
this defense will miss dupree
good work d you finally stopped a fourth string qb

well stopped him from getting a td
a deep ball on 3rd and 4
hey guys our number 1 defense hasnt forced a 3 and out today
smith shuster is washed some clown
why did he take that out
im so sick of diontae dancing stick your fucking foot in the ground and go upfield

why not kick the fg make it an 8 point game why would you trust the offense and even going for it why run a fucking counter my god
imma need a bump of cocaine to come down off this game yall

man fuck the colts cant get shit done that interception call that went for the ravens was a terrible call incomplete pass
i dare these mfers to give alex smith cpoy over my guy
damn colts shit the bed
kinda pulling for the panthers to come out on top against kc so we can be consensus 1
plz dont play down steelers
im still nervous
i am very nervous unsure why

lets be honest we all know why
how can the cowboys win today just be the 1975 bears

thanks tony
ben best rb in afc north
bruh fuck the deep ball
i hate the deep sideline passes
boy are they excited about dicks

we know
there was contact but that went right through claypools hands
little hold still gotta catch it with hands on it
claypool should have caught that
i am mentally preparing myself for this to be a stressful game but i expect us to destroy expect the best prepare for the worst
still dont care for the dive and draw plays over and over again but relax guys lol this isnt a big deal yet at all
so the defense needs a timeout in the first quarter against the cowboys ps offense fuck
yes hit him low and toss him across the first well done
i didnt know we needed alualu so badly
wow what an effin joke williams was held so obviously and no flags
yall the cowboys are excited and we arent give it some time
wow alualu really mustve been that important
so this might end up being that game
i guess they show up and play the second half this week
were looking like dogshit so far lmao
yeah i guess i will crack open a beer
this guy reminds me of brandon weeden
great coverage bince
whats on the back of inces arms
can we get this redzone d the whole game please
now block the fg lol
no td for you
tj just a hair away from causing that fumble
thank fuck for tj watt
why doesnt that stadium have blindsshades for those windows
i understand everyone here wants us to demolish cowboys wo giving out any points but we just have to accept the fact that we rarely blow out anyone
even if they only got three that is a good drive for dallas and a good start to the game for them they chewed up a lot of clock time and came away with points dallas loses the game if they let roethlisberger control it but if they can keep this a low scoring slow paced game that keeps the clock moving they have a shot
yall acting like we are losing 400
wtf is this conservative bullshit
just gotta say when i first tuned in i was like why the fuck are steelers in black and gold then i remembered dallass home colors are white then i felt like a huge dumbass
16 yds to go lets throw it behind the line of scrimmage smh
what in the fuck
lmao what is this offense these last several games didnt look good 2nd half of titans was only ok last week now this i know its early but it looks just as bad
that punt was dope
our oc is no better than our punter
2nd and 14 hand the ball to our 2nd string rb fucking lol
good fuckin punt tho
these plays are fucking garbage whats with these piss ass short throws and rushing on 2nd and 14
worst playcalling ever wtf was that
wow berry looks much better although the dome probably helps
clutch punt
lads im getting some ruff vibes here
hey ben you want to start calling plays again maybe have dobbs draw up some ones youd like too
benny snell runs on 2nd and 10 and 2nd and 24

neither of those play calls is defensible and both end up with a punt after a failed 3rd and long
our offensive coordinator is the issue and its not even a debate
berry holy damn bro
not the best play calling
great play calling so far
lmfao just lmfao ive seen this shit before
i stand by my previous statement we do not have an intermediate passing game
i dont feel like we are taking this team seriously
looks like this is play like ass first half and play fucking amazing second half kind of game
defense take my energy
i feel like randy wants to start every game bad on purpose
it seems i prematurely shit talked berry
this is 100 the start of the game i expected so im not even mad
this is why ive been nervous about this game tomlin coached steeler teams against shit teams is always an adventure its only 30 so not a lot of panic yet but man if it isnt trending towards it
out of all the games this is one i shouldnt have to be stressed about
jesus fucking christ whos calling the offense today big bens 7 year old son
everyone freaking out until we get a turnover on d real quick
the defense rn is like oh so its going to be one of those games
bens deep balls just havnt been there we dont have a deep threat id much rather take ben over anyone but man it sucks not to have it in our arsenal
honestly garbage playcalling by randy so far i have faith itll shape up
id like a pick 6 here please
gilbert throws better than lamar
if im mccarthy i go for this you win this game by taking risks
garret peyton tom dan marino brady manning gilbert
so when do we just promote ben to oc
they would have had it kind of dumb not to go for it
tomlin we purposefully looked like shit in the first quarter

checkmate cowboys
fichtner fans will say weve scored 25 in every game this year without acknowledging the fact that his specialty is 2 yard runs and screen passes
joe haden as the return man interesting
the play calling in that quarter sucked
haden for pr what
did something happen to ray ray
where is ray ray
anyone got any insight why would haden be returning the punt rayrays okay right
steelers vs cowboys and fichtner
why the fuck was haden back there lmao
if im 26 theres no chance in hell im punting right there thanks dallas
i think its pretty clear at this point that the steelers are feeling out what the cowboys are capable of on both sides of the ball they are giving very simple vanilla looks on offense and defense and the steelers simply havent turned up the volume yet when we start seeing more creative looks then im sure the momentum will swing almost immediately i agree with the majority of the sub that we should in fact be coming out swinging but quite simply put we are still in the drivers seat ride the wave well be fine
damn you guys see johnson burn diggs
mcfarland looks like the emoji in that picture
haden probably is the returner when they go safe or are trying to be ready for a fake he used to occasionally practice with the return team when we were at uf probably got the job by default
3rd and short time to throw it over the mountains
stop running the ball pls
as a former terp

mcfarland is only 58 what the fuck
jesus christ fuck off with this stupid ass play call
im guessing conner is hurt
wheres conner lol
just terrible play calling today
this is so fucking embarrassing
theres 0 urgancy from our sideline just playing backups playing down to our competition its so sad man
randy fitchner go fuck yourself
update from my last comment three consecutive runs with no gain after passing works randy is calling plays again guys
why are we so hell bent on running the fucking ball
running game isnt working at all better run it on 4th down
ben goes 66 and we run it 3 times in a row
fire randy fichtner now i swear
we ran the same play twice what are we doing
mondeux needs to wrap up
a run up the middle didnt work the first time lets try it again
99 is a bum
wtf are we doing
fichtner maybe if we run it up the middle three times itll get two fucking yards no fuck
1 fuck snell


2 where are the fucking holding calls
wtf come on 3 shots to gain like a yard and youre running the same play 3 straight times nice
why cant we ever look like the better team against anyone
i usually talk about playcalling as well but the ol has been fucking garbage in the run today
mondeaux being on the field at all is a great of telling your opponent you have no real interest in winning the game
we do not look like the better team right now
lmao
ben take over playcalling again please
fire randy sphincter
fuck this shit
fichnter holds this offense back so much
this gameplan is maddening
insert do something meme here
i still have hope but daaaamn we cant do 4 quarters of offense or defense
maybe they realize were playing a football game next drive
good to see we overlooked the cowboys
can we play like an undefeated team for once
butler take tj watt out of coverage you fucking idiot
guess i shouldve started the dallas defense in fantasy
take mondeaux off the field please
mondeaux needs to go back to golden corral
this is a coaching issue were obviously the far superior team and yet were playing exactly how they want us to
lmao you truly have to laugh
chiefs can handle the jets easily but when it comes to us we look embarrassing we arent winning a super bowl
this is embarrassingly embarrassing
time to unleash hell
ill check in on this after halftime maybe ben will send randy packing by then
maybe well do the opposite of what we usually do and instead give heart attacks in the first half and play mediocre before smashing 24 points past them in the 4th quarter
dallas barely had 10 in their last 3 games

lol
that was pathetic
why the f was watt on lamb
wow
sucks that out talent bails out shitty coordinators
how the hell do we drop 8 and leave him that open in the end zone
great refereeing refs go fuck yourselves
can we not put out best pass rusher in coverage covering their best receiver
christ im having a melt down already
please tell me more about garrett such a cinderella story
the worst start all season wow
why do we insist on dropping tj watt in coverage on 3rd down
i trust we will win the game but this looks pretty fucking bad
steelers just love playing down to their competition dont they
no way we lose to these fucking bums
do any of you understand zone defense
just so so disappointed that we still show up completely unprepared for these games ive really got to give up expecting us to get over it
this team is why i have trust issues
score here quick stop score again before the end of the half
gah our offensive playcalling just blows so much so hard to get momentum when we are doing shit like running on 2nd and 14 and giving up on drives passing 2 yards on 3rd and long
in a way im actually glad this is happening because now theyll stop using their trash run plays and just pass the damn thing or get creative i mean he cant just keep running hb dives right

right
does butler not trust his corners to call man coverage getting out coached big time
i think everyone is over reacting were still gonna win like we did against the ravens
i am not surprised in the slightest bit
how do you people make it through games being this emotional lmfao
stevie wonder could see this coming
man defense to actually make gilbert throw people open nah linebackers on receivers again
we def didnt take this team seriously
conner was okay this whole time and we didnt use him fucking once last drive
how bout we start playing different personnel they got a receiver on a lbpass rusher almost every play tj has 3 coverage snaps alone already lets just go to nickel or even bring in a dime backer and play with a bear front and stop dropping our outside backers in coverage other than flats at least for a while
youre telling me conner was healthy and had nothing to do with the last drive wha in the fuck are they doing
five wide call the play at the line lets go
i love the steelers

however i hate randy fitchner
lol will you guys calm down theres a reason we play all 60 minutes
so randy are we going to continue the run run pass
actual good punt by berry and that happens anyways
cant blame the coaches for the execution on some of these plays
imagine what the chiefs will do to us
still a 50 yard play at least
this is the super bowl for the cowboys
pathetic
i put the game on 5 mins ago and its already infuriating come tf on theyre 26 for a reason
dont worry guys ill turn off my tv and well get going im taking this one for the team
im not even mad this is laughable i think well be fine 2nd half as per tradition
slow starts mean bad prep for the week coaching issue not player issue for sure
hmm cant tell which team is 70
not surprising at all been like this for years
like 5 blocks in the back glad they chose one
cowboys might as wel go for it we cant stop them
mike tomlin special coming up
anyone freaking out yet or is it still too early
whats the point of having watt practice all week just to fucking pull him he came on the plane it just makes no sense
eagles held them to 9 and washington held them to 3
i would kill to have competent coordinators watching other teams coach well every week is frustrating
this team has always been so nonchalant with lesser teams shit is ridiculous
brah i am not having a good time right now
the way this game is going is so eerily similar to the 2014 game against the 18 jets we go down like 13 or 170 in the first quarter and a half and go on to lose 2013 im having extreme dejavu
stop running the fucking ball the oline cant do it your running backs cant do it just stop fucking doing it

running on first and second down and not getting a first down is a losing gameplan
i know this is going to sound stupid but could playing towards those giant stupid fucking windows with the sun glaring directly into the players faces be playing a part in our piss poor performance so far or is it poor play calling and execution
this drive has to end in a td
looks like im getting fucking sloshed
run through the air were good at that
good shit juju
juju looking like hines ward on that one
ben get drunk before the game
lmao ben is so mad
am i the only one that thinks ben calls the plays everytime we are able to move the ball decently
bens deep ball is so trash so far this year
big ben needs to fix up on these long shots ffs
its crazy that i expected dallas refs to call the pi
steelers vs refs
there is this clear delineation between playcalling interesting
lol these refs are pieces of shit
wheres that guy who made that mason rudolph coming in
today thread fuck that guy
bens staying in thankfully please dont let this year get any worse
x200b

well it is halftime ben can put some ice on that kneee and come back better than ever
i swear to god yall
ben is hobbling

why is he still in there
injections for ben incoming at halftime
im willing to donate any body part ben needs i cannot watch rudolph again
ben shake that shit offfff
take ben out wtf i rather lose this game than lose ben for four games or the season
damn ben threw that with some anger lol
chase bailed him out there lol
ebron might be my favorite offseason addition this year
hurt ben has entered the game dallas is fucked
wouldnt it be great if did this all game
i count two penalties that the refs missed against the cowgirls
bionic ben is best ben
gimpy ben td pass
all my homies love james washington
theyve activated bens trap card
ben is king
yessirr
thats my qb
if half injured ben just the thing this team needs
bens pump fake still elite after all these years
legendary pump fake
missed pat srsly
ok

so it takes ben to get smashed and his left knee fucked to get serious

and then there is the boz
and he missed the pat this is swimming in fucking headaches
oh boz god cmon man
now that is a lunch pail guy
are you fucking serious
alright back on track a little
ben is washed up pull him
ben might not be able to throw deep right now but he can manage a drive when he calls the plays
worst half of the season by far wow
but were still not out of this just yet
oh boz
god fucking damn it
i love my drama king ben
wtf boz
one of those games probably gonna come off of the foot of boswell to end the game and redeem that missed xp
ben in pain is a focused ben now time for the d to wake up steelers are only a picksix from a tie
wow top to bottom theres some disappointment definitely one of those games when bos is missing the xp
i just hope this means a second half of banged up ben

hes next level when hes hurt a little
wouldnt say no to a pick 6 before the half
an injured big ben is better than a healthy big ben
why can we not just play well
watch it again kids not on boz
who knows if it was boswell or if jordan berry messed up the hold
release the red zone reindeer
this game isnt over its not gonna surprise me if they bring it back like they always do but goddamnit is this so frustrating that they do this shit all the time against teams they should not be losing to
people sleep on ben as a football mind hes not just backyard ben this is somebody who knows the game and has truly developed
nice throw to get the td but that dallas defender literally held claypools jersey for 6 or 7 steps before tackling him down totally missed call blown by the ref
its so predictable defense is swiss cheese until the red zone offense is terrible until ben starts calling play at 2 mins left
i just constantly flip my opinions with this defense i mean ben being potentially hurt means the d will need the win the game but can they they gave up 13 points to a 4th string qb but on the other side have dominated some games i cant read this d
i think theyre just using the extra time to get him in there and evaluate i think ben is good
i still love me some bos he only had one bad season for us and every kicker is bound to miss here and there
lol oh no here we go with mason
just kick it now lol
rudolph elite lets go
rudolph pls bro
lol ben come back please
i know rudolph is higher on the depth chart but did we ever decide if he was better than duck
1 what a defence

2 lets go rudolph the redzone reindeer
im over here like mason is fine but i still dont think hes our future
just get a field goal pls just get a field goal
its absurd the cowboys are allowed to get away with those windows
masons floaters gonna get our receivers killed
turnover great

mason not great
not mason rudolph jesus
mason throws passes that get our wr murdered
thank you juju for coming down with that
so lucky for juju
i thought we were done with this clown
shit got barely 1 play
why is mason in the game
they couldnt get 5 yards with mason
wonder if randy is gonna bust out the samuels conner wildcat duo

things are already going pretty terribly
imagine if we went after andy dalton as a backup
tf was that god mason sucks
lots of whacky shit in this game but the fact that the steelers cant run the ball against one of the worst run defenses in the league is the most ridiculous
isnt it easier to kick in a fucking dome
damn yall must be some new fans
fuck it go for the 59 yarder
bosgod
praise becam heyward
whaaaaaaaaat
ok boswell youre forgiven for that missed extra point lol
not to take credit but i sent him my energy so youre welcome boys
boz redemption
bahahahaha he made it lolololol
bosgod again
wowwww holy shit boz
and totally redeem yourself
cmon ben
new career high
ok 4 point game ideally ben comes back in the 2nd half leads us to a comeback and we get out of here 80
bozgod with the boomer
atta boy bozzy
misses extra point
makes 60 years fg
false start op les go
we needed one good thing to take to the locker room and thats boz making a 59 yard kick his bitch
thats my bosgod
bos is like ben i guess lol miss the 54 but nails the 59 by a lot lol
can you now use the snapper as leverage i feel like that happened both attempts unless i saw wrong looked like he used our guys to jump up the middle
what happened to ben i missed the game up until now
i miss charlie batch every year as he set the standard for backups he is only 2 years older than brady wonder what he is doing
burt says ben is expected to return
ben expected to returnpraise his knee
lets calm down about ben if ben was in danger of missing time i dont think he would have stayed out there
love that coach still has faith in his team even after all this time
please be okay ben
ben expected to return per dve
im too drunk to know what to expect so someone tell me how to feel rn
roboben revenge tour incoming
i think we bring more blitz pressure in the second half
so glad bens coming back but the steelers gotta atleast make dobbs qb2 after that showing
ben if you win this ill promise to stop referring to you as the two time
we gotta get into nickel too many wrs covered by lbs
gilbert looks like steve young out there compared to maon
this brady guy is pretty good
we are getting killed in the secondary
gilbert is picking us apart
bro garret fucking gilbert is bending us over the fucking barrel what is this
watt blew that one
the offense has been rough but the defense today is far more disappointing for me
a sack would be cool
idk what evil spell the city of baltimore has put on his but our run d has been trash since then
so yea our defense as of the bush injury or second half of the titans game has not been the same
sure we ended up with wins but havent played well down to down
good to see they made absolutely zero adjustments at halftime getting absolutely fucking dunked on by a 4th string qb
fg miss would be nice
im glad their kicker is automatic this game
dupree out here likesame old shit shit just a different day day

out here tryna get it get it each and every way way
i still fail to understand why we run base against 11 personnel especially when they have pollard in not that hes bad just more of a change of pace than a run you over guy
need a new plan offensively whatever we had coming in isnt working
just saying slay the spire and celeste are on crazy good deals on ps4 and theyre pretty relaxing to play while watching games on my phone especially slay the spire if anyones looking for a fun game for multitasking
lol them saying lets see what ben looks like after the injury we already saw what he looks like 44 and a td so dramatic
im stuck outside away from the tv whats the update on ben
the blocking on that reverse play was trash at best
berry is booming the ball today
our d is going to have to win it for us again
just take the yardage needed for the first down were down one score we dont need a home run
this o line aint getting isotoners for christmas
our offense collectively has low t they need some of that gel you rub on your shoulder
al pounce decastro chuks idk what the fuck yall are doing but it needs to end here
i feel like im in the twilight zone as much as i know this teams performance in these games i said no way not this game and here we are
need defense to step up for us please
defense splash play to save the day coming i can feel it
wtf happened to this run defense
this run defense is a joke what the fuck happened
come the fuck on
poor tackling
best run d in the league right there
almost no pressure on their qb
tj getting that cock punch fist ready
we have got to tackle
what is life if not to lose trap games
we cant stop garrett gilbert garrett gilbert is unstoppable garrett gilbert
this guy picks apart our secondary like tom brady
this is just complete trash on defense remember when the steelers used to eat rookies and first time qbs
gtfo out of zone
getting torched by a 4th string qb
whats that yet another fucking lb in man coverage on a god damn fucking wr
that clocks just cruising away
1st down tfl
2nd down make it 3rd short
3rd down easily give up a 1st

rinse and repeat
so were just not gonna make a stop this drive
hurt cam is out here playing better than our whole dline
watching these defense and im feeling like ive never seen these guys before
feels like one play we put our foot on the gas and the next we take it completely off and start pumping the brakes

getting whiplash over here
i guess we arent the 1 run d anymore
defense sucks dick until these fucks are already in fg range
dont give me that ol bullshit sutton
fucking dog shit
tomlin cant beat teams with losing records
why must they always do this shit every fucking year
this is weak so far plenty of time left
greg zuerlein is dad dicking our 70 team
we have time
only 10 points but what a miserable fucking game

the defense and offense need to come to life and stay alive these little jolts of life before going limp is clearly not getting the job done expected us to phone it in today but this is ridiculous
still plenty of game left i believe
just shut up romo
hard to blame our defense when our offense cant stay on the field two weeks in a row where our offense is virtually nonexistent and our defense suffers for it having to stay on the field for a long time with little breathers in between
lol cant wait to see a 50 yard bomb on 3rd and 1
wont be the first time tomlins been out coached by mccarthy its easier to understand with aaron rodgers at qb though
can we play offense already we cant give garbage teams hope you know cowboy fans will never shut up about this one 4ever
steelersdepotthe steelers are 64 as doubledigit road favorites under mike tomlin per pro football ref last loss was to raiders in 2018 xray machine gate

64 when you are big favorite is not good
fellas we cant lose today and give mr big chest the satisfaction
more shortintermediate passing please
got to catch that
juju is the only bright spot in this game
juju lets goooo
protect juju at all costs
juju got the hot hand feed him
now can we have bionic ben tear this shitty defense up
juju
thank you juju
jujuuuuuu
juuujuuuuuu

omfg

i love juju
pick 6 lfg
not boswells fault but why take the personal foul yardage on the kickoff thats nearly guaranteed touchback help the guy kick the extra point
bruh wtf is happening
hahahahahahahahahahaha
why the fuck not
looked like he was running out of bounds
cut everyone on special teams tomorrow
jesus christ all three phases are brutal today wake up call
i think the specials teams is a little bit of a problem again
danny smith needs to go
why can we not stop them
i look away for one second
elite special teams today
our special teams arent very special
already in the red zone
lol danny smith just knows how to ruin my day
stop playing goddamn zone defense
our special teams have been an absolute strength this season and today they decided to shit the bed wtf

our defense is legitimately unrecognizable today
this game is all about momentum and we keep fucking losing it every time we get some
this whole team has been playing shit
just do a touchback
we deserve a loss here
juju why did you dance on their logo before the game seriously a lot of this seems downright unlucky

aint gonna shit on my team love these guys but im over here like
mmmmm idk he looked like he stepped out there
only win if we get a turnover just no mojo today on d
fuck this game lol
this bandaid rushing defense is so bad man theyre gonna get toasted for another 200 yards today
pretty much everything has gone wrong today so
where did our defense go
i swear if we find a way to lose to this fucking hs jv team im done
heads need to fucking rolll on monday
14 point favorites i knew that was a stupid line
here i am thinking were gonna win 343 today

minkah you beauty
half the distance from the 2 lol
lets gooooo hyped for the pick but wished minkah just took a knee
ok well shit


lets fucking goooooooooooooo
big time play right there
98 yards to go boys
incoming safety


what else did hell have in store for us
fucktinyromo
stay in the endzone you fuck
dont run it out
a pick is a pick
minkah clutch as hell
lol ill take that penalty
whooooo thought we were getting robbed
pass run pass i mean lets try it
he keeps it a one score game and runs it out and yall bitch calm down either way we needed that badly
minkah needs to go the fuck down why running out of the endzone just 20 yards out of the window

but glad we have that beautiful safety
really surprised they let gilbert throw in that spot a fg is a 7 point lead
time for a 90 yard juju td
12 minute touchdown drive ez
my fucking heart im gonna die
i dont even know how you call hitting a dude in his chest a blind side block
lets just go ahead and win this fucker
diontae has a shitty catch radius
everytime i look up its 3rd down
for the love of god stop passing to johnson
ray ray save the day day
thank fuck ben took over the play calling
its uncle ben time
never had a 99 yard drive


didnt he throw a 99 yard pass to juju
if they are gonna keep giving us these 56 yd passes keep taking them
snipsnap snipsnap
every time i turn it off the steelers do something good so im leaving the game off youre welcome
yo he just straight punched him
haha nice composure dickhead
i like claypools fire but getting involved in every altercation is going to lead to a penalty on us at some point
cant believe we need the refs to win this
of course romo wants to go down and protect his lil cowboy
cowboys been buttering the ball during changeovers
bad take on tony acting love or macfarland was holding his facemask am was pushing him off so thats dumb
i think the refs feel bad for us
holy fuck
tie game oh wait
good going chris
please fire danny smith crawford has ran the same play 3 times and he hasnt stopped it
we desperately need a real running game
lets go defense
im fine the unnecessary roughness call but to act like he shouldve been ejected goes against the sport of football
strip sack comming up spillane easy
somebody want to stop that guy from getting home on every kick attempt or what
thank god this was a touchback
tj unleashed
see yall at the hospital
make a fucking stop
this dallas offensive line of backups has out performed the steelers dl and ol
all that just to give up the first in a sec
great stop mondomondu
brett fakesel makes a play
how come zeke only looks good against the steelers
i swear some of yinz are so pessimistic
all things considered gilbert is playing well today
come on ben you got this
clutch ben time
thats what we needed

offense needs to put points on the board and torch the fucking clock
big ups to romo for the blazing saddles reference
some say nantz is still saying their punters last name
slow drive for a td would be greaaaaat
did ben and boswell bet against the spread or something lmao
i need a t shirt with mondeaux in a print like the mountain dew logo
bold prediction were gonna come out in 5 wide formation
steeler heart attack football
this is four down territory until we get to the 20
cmon ben lets go offense lets prove were 1
everyone play renegade
lets go offense
so special teams our achilles heel
this game
his feet cant catch
how many drops does claypool have today
bens throws have not been good today a lot of lowhighbehind receivers
thank you refs omg
why have we abandoned the run
we are getting bailed out by the refs
finally call it
ref does not want us to lose
i am shocked they called that for ben
3 great playcalls randy thanks for the call refs
bailed out nice
tomlin looks like hes about to lose his goddamn mind
i hate that call but ill take it lol
yesss i love refball
if we win this it will be almost entirely as a result of the variety of penalties dallas has accumulated
so many drops
thats a garbage call right going backward and flails his arms super weak
cowboys sub must be up in flames right now
were gonna take a lot of heat for being bailed out by flags
feels like ages since we ran the ball
thats allll in
and the mail in ballots put us on top
thats a heck of a lot of time to leave hopefully the d can pull through
thank god get this two and then d play your asses off

well fuck still i like our chances to prevent them from scoring a td defense will ball their asses off as long as butler doesnt go full retard on the play calling
jumped right over that lil gnome
lets fucking go
ebron baby
ee ee eeeeebron
leapbron
nice hurdle how often do you see a hurdle for td
too much time left they needed to waste it
everyone blast renagade right now
pump renegade into my dick veins
im sorry i ever doubted this team im sorry
my fucking heart is not enjoying this
blast renegade
so this has gotta be a record for least amount of extra point conversions right
we need to go to juju in those situations man
cutting the zone coverage like butter come on now
anyone else have heart palpitations today lol
we never do things the easy way
a lot of you guys are way behind
the last thing i wanted this game to come to is a defensive hold they only punted 2 times
everyone have renegade on standby
lets go defense
ok time for tj to get some
any chance we can like maybe not do this against the jags and bengals
maybe dallas will just kick a field goal
i miss guys like rod woodson carnell lake and troy polamalu
lets go defense
give me either a defensive td or at least a turnover forced fumble by tj or bud or an int by minkah
it should be 2719 right now the blocked xp and missed xp is hurting so bad right now
gimme that sweet sweet strip sack
a w is a w ill take staying unbeaten over anything but damn this should never have been close

a damn 4th stringer

and now a flag fest going against the cowboys where my cowboys fan coworkers are texting me they helping the steelers refs vs cowboys and shit
fuck me catch that
think you guys have it tough im the only steelers fan in my house while everyone loves the cowboys
lets go defense lets go
punt it you cowards
clutch haden
nice wrap up joe fuck yeah that was biiiig
thank god for joe haden
that was almost a td oh my god
lets gooooooo
thats fucking defense
lets goooo

cam has earned every penny of his paycheck
lol mccarthy so red right now hes lookin like andy reid fuck you dallas
the defense always pulls through

cameron basedward
fuck yeah heyward
cam motherfucking heyward
letsss goooo the comeback
calm down its not over yet we need a 1st down
wdkoswimamqkqwkwowoooooooooo
this is the way
im sending my cardiologists bill to mike tomlin
the win is gonna make us forget that our secondary is bad and the run game is like i dont even know
gilbert fucked cams wife i can clearly see that now
the secondary needs to step up next week though with cincinnati coming off a bye their worst starting receiver is aj green at this point which is saying something
ball game
we got away with one there big non call on heyward
cam is that man
god this game is so good
hats off to gilbert kids a gamer

that being said here we go i never doubted them looks around nervously
lets go offense
wtf just kick the fg
just take the fg there wtf
why the fuck didnt they kick
kick the fucking field goal
wait why didnt we kick a fg
why would you not go for the fg
should have taken the points tbh
uhhhhh just kick the fg wtf
no fg what the fuck
wtf go up 8 omg
romo is 100 on point here cant risk a block as st has been ass cheeks
if we lose someone deserves to be out of a job
why not kick
why did we not kick that fg
thats on coaching

why would they not kick it am i missing something
there is no reason to not take three there
i feel uneasy about not attempting the field goal there
that may have been the dumbest play in the existence of football
im in shock at how dumb of a call that was
why the fuck does this happen every god damn week
so that fg call kinda of makes sense theyve been close to blocking just about every kick lol
goddamn the fucking lovehate relationship i have with this team
there is so much fucking wrong with this team
its like want to lose this game
tony is so fucking biased holy fuck
please d please youve been called countless times but we need more more
ok why does conner look like his dog died is it because we couldnt run against the worst run defense in the league
what the flying fuck was that decision not to take the field goal i dont care how shaky boswell has been we are giving them a chance to win this game
someone tell me why we didnt kick the fg
is this a replay of last week
honestly if im them i feel pretty good about gilbert after this game
well it comes to one play just like last game
not this situation again my heart cannot take more of these
please d your name is called once more
lets go defense
here comes the heart attack
dont believe they didnt take the field goal
i am so scared lets get an int
how do you miss that chokehold on watt
good lord i dont need this in my life right now
even if we win this has been pathetic
end it with a sack come on
lets go defense
jesus h christ
thank u minkah
thats the ball game
fucked that cursed stadium get the squad and get out of there
another week another heart attack
80 babyyyyyyy
80
holy shit i cant keep doing this every week
mad respect for gilbert 80 baby
steelers football baby
this team is going to kill me
wheeeeeeew that was too close shouldnt have been that close to begin with
ben is all of us lol
and of course its minkah
thank god the nfl ratings arent chosen by a committee
minkah does it again
10 hart attacks how bout yall
team of destiny or using up all our luck
140 bpm
i love this fucking team best start in franchise history
we lose this game any other year holy shit
first time ever 80 ugly as yo sister but still a w
fuckk all you sorry ass fans doubting boz and then praising him a second later
gotta love how tomlin and butler get exposed by other teams lining receivers on our linebackers going on 5 years now no corrections
trap game engaged initiate maximum steelering i see us winning by a field goal the steelers are out to kill off all older pennsylvanians
steelers absolutely deserve to lose this game
alright motherfuckers lets do this

80 its go time i want a good clean game and i want our boys to get pulled in the 4th

who ride
why do we have to waste a to every 1st quarter
you guys just attract negative energy
we look bad guys
watt in coverage on lamb brilliant
this team is so talented but has the worst coordinators
tj on a wr what could go wrong
this game has been so predictable of course the steelers play like shit after beating a good team always play down to the opponent
nothing like a long commercial to remind ya how much things suck right now due to the ongoing global pandemic that amazon is making record breaking profits from

thanks amazon you fucking suck
fichtner is a plague on that offense the difference between bens play calling and his is night and day fire that man tomlin he is killing your team
woke up from my mom texting and asking me if the steelers were undefeated and i knew something was up
hopefully ben is just get a pain shot and will rest up and be out there in 3
goddamn itthat play should have never happened if it werent for the non call on pi on claypool
does rudolph hire people to come on here and defend him

hes obviously one of the worst qbs in the league
did romo just say juicy ass
lol butler is really an idiot bud dupree on cooper really lmao
im just straight up not having a good time
well if we hold em for three then a touchdown ties it

offense needs to be on this second half these flat performances are killing us
getting outcoached on defense trying to stay in base in 3 wr sets then dupree is covering amari cooper
any given sunday its a one score game lets get the w here we go
they may as well go for it we cant stop shit
steelers and playing down horribly name a more iconic duo
idk how i thought we were super bowl bound
alright guys heres where the momentum shifts touchdown here defensive stop another touchdown
chill its the first quarter

chill its only halfway thru the second

chill its only halftime

chill theres still a quarter left you are here

chill ben has a great 2 minute drill
fine free play but come on ben please do better make it a jump ball at least
ah yes 1st and 15 from a 1st and 5 delightful
our special teams is straight ass
we have to keep juju and bud at any cost idc how you get it done just get it done
well it was nice to go 70 had to end sometime
god we needed that biweek
this is gonna be one of those games where the score makes it look closer than it actually was
down at the 2 lord give me strength
hes usually a great announcer but romos homerism is getting on my nerves also bc were losing lol
imagine having 2 extra points
okay at some fucking point you gotta just stand up and not let these dudes jump over the line
mondo only pawn in game of life
i dont want to be negative but man i really wanted to run and keep the clock going down
we all know this is coming down to the last play its the pittsburgh way
calling it 300 yard second half for ben
why are we letting a 5th string fucking keep this alive
guess we just dont get any pi calls this year

this has to be the trappiest of all trap games
defense wakes up when theyre already in a position to score lol
i can tell by the first drive with two bombs thrown when we never throw it deep that we overlooked this team lol
hire todd haley
playing down to the competition the mike tomlin special
conner wouldve gotten that first down
you wouldnt think this was a sub of a 70 team just from reading it lol
death taxes and playing down to a trash team
the chin would be foaming and spraying spit all over players by now
offense better wake up this upcoming drive
thank god this half went by fast and is almost over
what an interesting commercial
its like they remembered ben can throw the ball
good things happen when you throw who would have thought
im going to start sending my cardiology exams and blood pressure bills to the rooneys and steelers front office
we are so much better in spread and ben calling plays
where the fuck has this offense been and why isnt it ran more
please dont be acl
most pittsburgh first half ive ever seen
lmao rudolph is awful would be nice to have a competent backup qb to buy some time if ben can come back
incredible from sutton man hes so good it feels like he always shines and gives us a spark when everything is dark it sucks they get the ball to start but i hope we found what we needed to clean this game up
overall terrible halfbut were right back into it
ben ill give you my knee if you want its kind of fat but its young
losing to the cowboys and keeping ben safe would hurt but i think making sure hes healthy is more important than trying to go 160
i dont understand why we tend to make backups look like brady is it cause the other coach tries to keep it simple and we plan for difficult i dont understand i guess dallas doesnt have much to lose either
this offense is so fucking bad cant move the ball or score on the worst defense in the league
can tomlin try to wake this fucking team up or is he just gonna continue to stand there and say nothing ffs
the steelers offensive line cratering this year has been the biggest issue on this team full stop
3rd and 4 lets chuck it
fuck this offensive line theyre awful
bens deep ball looks like trash this year get fucked randy terrible play calls for yet another 3 and out
cant understand it why going for bombs on situations like that man we are in a lot of trouble
3rd and 9 so dallas will get 10
so who else have the cowboys beat just so i know what company well be a part of
come on boys it aint over til lizzo sings
how did it not occur to ebron that he couldve been holding there
pay juju after this drive
that type of shit is exactly how you lose these type of games
im talking to the supreme court right now about massive extra point fraud
maybe go for 2 next time
fire danny smith
fire danny smith
fire danny fraud smith
we are the imposter
just fucking down it in the endzone god damn
shouldnt have ran it out but thats just being pessimistic hell yeah minkah
hindsight is 2020 but i want minkah running that bitch out 1010 times
swear vander esch punched him
fuck outta here lve you fucking injuryprone neckpad wearing bitch
vander esch probably still pissed about the election
eject him
if he threw a punch eject his ass
i know dj isnt the biggest guy but he picks up like 2 more yards there if he just keeps running
refs gonna ever call leverage
does anyone else get worried about boswell getting mental issues whenever he misses a kick his fault or not
pittsburgh finally flipped
this is the unit i want out there to win it for us lets go d
im scared u guys
pick six time
dont stop the count
i know tomlin won you a super bowl and everything and still kept you winless but honestly what the fuck was that call not to put the kicker in
ha you fools captain fat fuck plays better injured
id rather have david decastro be the backup qb than mason rudolph
stop calling it gimpy you motherfucker
fuck you jim nantz
also why why why do we always go for it all on third down we needed 2 fucking yards ben cant throw deep but keeps doing it we have maybe 3 possessions left at this rate
i predict we only lose 453 to kc
imagine only having 9 points against the worse defense in the nfl
bionic ben has returned

im sorry but mason just isnt the guy wish theyd realize that
waaaaahhhh my favorite team didnt do everything perfectly the season is over
lfg steelers
well ravens and chiefs are going to win
rivers is so bad
lets just take care of business and hope for no injuries
please dont let this be a trap game
3127 ugly win but still a win
i hate that this feels like a trap game
lets get this dub man
hate when were forced to wear our black jerseys on the road fuckin cowboys
walk in yo trap take over yo trap lets go steelers take over the cowboys stadium
let this mike tomlin coty campaign continue
favorite wing flavors thinking about making some korean wings at halftime
expectation blow them out let mason play in the fourth reality every game gotta be sweaty
one job panthers you had one job today
fuckk it started snowing here gotta go fire up the plow i guess this is a radio game fml pray for me the first plowable snow of the season
ok boys hopefully this is one we can just sit back and enjoy
alright romo lets keep this unbiased eh
tony had to get a little ravens dick suck in they really should have lost to the ravens
is this three weeks in a row with romo in the booth
outstanding analysis there romo isnt every defenses goal to be like the 1985 bears
giants fan here pls fuck the cowboys in the ass so hard that they tremble in fear when u guys play in the future
lamar jackson who
rampaging rhino rumbles downfield
is that lamar
dad speed
speedy ben
rumbling ben
rumblin
ben realizing the nfl rushing title is still in play
like a fridge falling off the back of a truck at high speed
romo just hates ben
and they say lamar is the better runner
lets not do that ben
man thats way too risky wtf
holy pickable ball
gunslinger ben baby
fuck claypool you gotta catch that
claypool wtf
lets throw a low percentage pass to kill our drive
great throw ben
mapletron probably shoulda had that though despite the hold
no flag though looked like big holding
jesus berry is ass
um no call there
thats def a foul
shouldve come down with that but also shouldve been a flag
im conflicted i want former longhorn qb garrett gilbert to succeed but i want the steelers d to play well
cmon chase
wtf was that though the offense had momentum then 2 deep shots outta nowhere claypool shoulda had a touchdown anyways but odd calls
gilbert is going to be the next goat and it starts with this game lol
ok ready to see the defense dominate
i hope zeke doesnt have a good day
i really want to know what our success rate is against the pass on third down that has to be a low number im sure of it
need to welcome this gilbert guy with a sack
lol everyone can calm down
we should take a deep breath lol it will be fine
we dont concern ourselves with opening drive touchdowns and things of that nature
start choppin at that ball elliot is known to fumble
damn were really out here making the cowboys look better than the ravens
so our run defense just went out the door last week
its like the defense doesnt ever want to play for a full game
im less worried about gilbert as i am about our run defense rn
that was dang good coverage vince
high smith baby
ok ok ok
bince
did zeke lose 1015 pounds
highsmith is looking realllly good
nice held em to a fg
i dont think theyre gonna score in the red zone on us theres no space
chill people
at least the sack streak continues thats 65 consecutive games
nothing to see here just some early game steelering
the steelers are the 1 seed in my heart every year
vanilla playcalling
steelering is back on the menu
shit playcalling so far
now this is a good looking offense
ok this playcalling is not doing it
alright lets quit with this lax ass offense it gets annoying
someone wanna tell fitchner its not preseason
2nd and 14 run to bleh snell 3rd and long a 2 yard out screen pass

back on the fire fitchner train
ah my steelers
hell of a punt holy shit 57 yards
if you dont love this you dont love steelers football
ok berry ok
oh boy randy fichtner makes me real frustrated lol
shaping up to be classic tomlin road game against a bad opponent
hell of a punt by berry
did the oc not watch tape on the cowboys
what a punt
jordan berry the goat
sadge
two absolutely tired starts for this offense what is going on
hopefully were only doing this to lure them into a false sense of security
can someone explain why punters dont audible to a pass when the gunner is left unmarked
running on 2nd and 14 is peak offense
running on 2nd and 14 i just cannot believe it
back to our regularly scheduled programming of steelering
why is it that every time we play a historically bad defense we always looks like total shit
i smell a pick6
is this a trap game i thought that was supposed to be the bengals game
aint nothing tuitt
still 144 left in the first and im on beer 3 steelering
i would enjoy winning this game just so tomlin can already have his 14th season as hc posting no losing record
1st q 74 offensive yards for dallas 25 for pittsburgh
lol check out haden being a pr love the versatility of the defense playing special teams
good shit joe
haden
that was definitely not part of the plan whats going on with our sideline
whats wrong with rayray
ok that looks like a ben play
i dont think i want starters returning punts
joe haden
lets go mapletron
the crowd sounds like theyre rooting for us
there you go cc
atta boy juju
ring the bell
love the check down to rb there
go for it
god we really just cant beat up on bad teams
rushings just not doing it
run game aint there right now
i heard that the cowboys have the worst run defense
why tf are we struggling
steelers doing what mccarthy shouldve done youre a two td underdog and 26 with a fourth string qb you win this game by keeping roethlisberger off the field that might require risks but what do you have to lose
wheres connor
where is james conner
are we playing a ton of backups its the only explanation for what im seeing
strange to use our scatback in short yardage situations
what a fucking joke
embarassing
yikes
they really cant get a yard running the ball this is sad
where the fuck is conner
why run that in shotgun
cant run against a terrible dallas d fucking lol
run 3 draws in a row lol
this team fucking sucks against bad teams plain and simple what a terrible fucking call

this team needs to wake the fuck up christ
fucking fichtner
cool cool fucking cool
how fucking stupid can you be
whats the point of having a fb if you dont use him
why is the smallest dude running on 4th and 1
only the 70 steelers could make the cowboys look like a competent team
you gotta be fucking kidding me same play call
not giving that to conner huh
in the fucking shotgun without a fb when you need a half yard love it
playing down to competition absolutely no one couldve thought of this
theyre a fucking professional football team too you know you cannot play this absurdly fucking stupid and expect to beat them just because theyre 26
another fucking draw are you fucking kidding me this is all you came up with after that time out randy just go ahead and fire yourself
shitshow
and an uncalled facemask
mondeaux is ass lol
stop running the ball
i still dont know why monduex is playing on this 5 star defense makes us look weak on his side
bless watt
fucking play the game jesus christ
what the fuck are we doing
look they have the number 32 run defense and we cant run it on them for fucks sake
gilbert running on us better than lamar did last week
99 sucks
lol we are letting gilbert run on us more than lamar
lol what the fuck is happening
pittsburgh what the fuck are you doing
gilbert has more yards scrambling than our whole offense
steve fucking young out here guys
we all knew this would happen fucking steelers
i wish we wouldve traded for a dt instead of lb
what is going on
mondueax so fucking slow and out of position tries to swap sides and gives that free scramble
team has clearly come into the game without the right mindset they thought it would be a cakewalk
dallas using the baltimore strategy run the fucking qb
god this sucks to watch
randy fichtners useless ass is going to single handedly be the thing that costs this team a sb run
this is not looking good
gilbert on the run after realizing watts not on containment
were gonna go into the half with the score being 06 arent we
what is going on with our defense
did the steelers even get on the plane for this game
let ben call it already jesus
im not stressed about the game as a whole but this is absolutely unacceptable if we want to be taken seriously we need to be able to play to our potential
i thought it was just a coach that had covid

whole team seems to have it
move the ball downfield with ease by passing only to lose it by running the ball
we could use a turnover
lets hold to a field goal please
this is pathetic
guys good news i think all the pre scripted randy fitchner drives are all over
lmao definitely looks like the typical steelers trap game
you just have to assume we wouldnt be able to slow down the elite talent that is jim gilbert or bob or whatever his name is
tomlin on the sideline while losing
making gilbert look like hes an mvp candidate
overreacting
whos this trash long haired white guy we have
lmaooooo this is pathetic why put ourselves in this position
steelers steelering nature is healing
defense looks clueless out there
time for a tranquilizer
what the actual fuck
were getting cooked no oil or butter
what the fuck is happening rn
so we arent defending the pass at all now or
we have two more rookies on bad teams coming up in the next two weeks time to turn things up and make a statement for the rest of the game rookies standing in the pocket and fearlessly making throws is not the image we need bring on the pressure and tight coverage we gotta keep people afraid of this defense
what the fuck
wow i cant even
time to get absurdly hammered
wtf is happening
wrong team scored a touchdown
take it easy well be alright
defense needs to make some adjustments we are shooting ourselves in the foot
such is life
im just as surprised as yall are
not sure why theres always an open receiver what is up with our coverage choices

our defense will adapt so im not worried yet just some questionable choices so far
this game fucking sucks
fack
of course they break their no touchdown streak on us
what the fuck
i think we all had a feeling that we would be playing down to them to some degree today
we got this relax
welcome to steelering dumbasses
how does the secondary have such an insane drop off from last year
seriously zone coverage isnt working play to your strengths
x200b

why are the steelers making the cowbys look like a decent team are the steelers intentionally stooping to their level

this is pittsburgh steelers football beat the ravens then get our asses kicked by some 26 team with a randy qb
gilbert has 4 more rushing yards then we do as a team 28 be 24
watt in coverage on ceedee lamb haden slipped on his turn around to the sideline

thats tough
alright boys you fucking awake now
im not stressing this is a classic steeler slow start but they never arent frustrating as moving away from pittsburgh and realizing that the pittsburgh left aint a thing anywhere else
that was their first td in 3 weeks they have already scored more this half than in their last 2 games combined
is conner hurt where is he
lol i love how we knew this was gonna happen
i hate being able to predict the future
this team isnt winning shit with watt vince covering wr and screen passes or run plays on 2ndlong

ffs were losing by 10 against the worst defense in the nfl and a qb who hasnt played in 2 years and elliot isnt even playing well
remember when pittsburgh was down 177 last week in baltimore everyone should chill out they adjusted in the second half and played better
well lets hope butler doesnt vince williams on keenan allen like last year where he just kept doing it all game


i dont think ive seen watt on a wr all year
butler and fichner cant gameplan their way out of a paper bag
chinga tu madre 30 veces keith buttler
god we get it garret was on a practice squad you dont have to say it everytime he fucking does anything
i wanted to believe the days of playing down to the opponent were over

god i hate being fucking wrong
they managed to snag a qb off a local high school team so we gotta tip our cap to that postgame interview
the steelers receivers posted tiktoks dancing around on the field instead of warming up
not that our defense is playing to their standard but this offensive showing is just sooooooo bad both playcalling and execution
run screen pass deep throw punt
no intensity at all in defense blitz like you always do on offense stop running it every play jeez open up the field
well hopefully being down 10 makes us start throwing more
pain
last thing we want is a stupid romo report who even let this clown call a cowboys game
well pull this out i believe just romo needs to stop filating his old team for 5 seconds
once again the problem is that the offense is absolutely useless and cant hold onto the ball for more than a few minutes the defense is gassed

the offense needs sustained drives for us to win
hello offense you there yo
so conner could have played that 4th down
anyone saying the game is over obviously hasnt been watching this year sure butler is terrible but once the players start checking down on what theyre seeing on the field well start a takeover
run run pass what the fuck
lol we suck
yeah

offense is a big ass problem
are you fucking kidding me what is this stupid ass play calling
i didnt remember ordering another run run pass
worst defense in the league and we cant get a first down
the fuck is this shit playing like we dont give a damn
offense looking just like last week in the first half
oh my fucking god stop running plays that will get 5 yards at most
we have the best wr core weve ever had and a hog qb throw the ball
jesus christ tomlin grow a fucking pair stop wearing the defense down to the fucking ground
the steelers have never gone 80 in 1978 we went 70 bottom line lets find a way to win this game still
block in the back
outstanding play calling and execution

we now need a freaking turnover against awful dallas
what the fuck just happened
roethlisberger looks like shit
jesus fucking christ

run run pass go fuck yourself fichtner
what
oh man
our special teams coach would never be this smart instead we got haden returning punts to throw them off lmao
i mean lol on that special team play but i kind of wish that would become a trend make punts a little more exciting
this is unbelievable
are you fucking with me
this team is so poorly coached
they fell for that high school harry shit
time to wake up boys
i knew this was gonna be the game where we do this bullshit
danny smith is a useless cunt
what on earth is going on
dont worry guys were still going to win this game well hit our rhythm
we got lucky this bum slipped
once the field flips and out offense and defense dont have the sun in their eyes then things will turn around
fuck keith butler
there is still a second half hopefully we adjust
not so excited to see our offense trot back out
only 2 score game still just i would feel a bit more confident if we had 1 score in the first half against these
welp if youre gonna lose a game its best to lose a game that doesnt really have any affect on the conference or division i suppose better get some points on this drive
canada needs to be oc idk who needs to call the plays on defense but it shouldnt be butler but at least he they only got a field goal
how fucking bright is that flashlight
supposedly this dallas d is historically bad yet they look like the 85 bears
my tennessee vols were up 130 at the half last night lost 2413 keep the faith lol
this would be a disappointing and heartbreaking start if it werent so damn predictable for the steelers to play down to a 26 team with a 4th string qb
why cant we have nice things
in a 2 possession game on a steelers team that typically makes the required adjustments at half i think everyone needs to chill out
long commercial
wake up offense lets get some points before the next half
absolutely no fucking way yall want todd haley back lmaoo
look for whatever reason we cant get our offense going if im fichtner get ebron involved start by throwing the ball to the middle of the field and build some momentum
open this fucking playbook call out all the shots we are in survival mode
oh thats right we have receivers
oh were throwing the ball now
getting so much more yardage passing it so watch go back to running three in a row
randy ficthner has to go as oc demote the man back to qb coach or something
oh wow looks like ben is directing the offense what a shock that things immediately start clicking
let ben call the plays

its obvious from last week and so far today that they need to let him make the calls

im tired of screaming at the tv my dogs are hidinglol
he overthrew him by 5 yards

this game is a fucking disaster
just not on the same page on deep balls throughout most of the year
if that ball is catchable its pi
oh shit right on bens leg
youre good ben walk it off
lmao tackled before the ball hit the ground okay
this is fine
so uhremind me who our back ups are for qb
injured ben best ben
honestly just lose this game but dont you dare lose ben
bad getting worse with ben holding his knee
holy fuck how was that not penalty for a low hit
ben is honestly a warrior wtf
wow what a grab
hurt ben is best ben
alright can we start beating the christ out of dallas now that they hurt ben
injured ben is best ben
ben is a tough dude
whats with all these missed pis
holy shit claypool
fuck is that the same knee he had meniscus surgery on in 2016
sick pump fake by ben
big changes the game
hurt ben best ben
ben going full kobe right now
i see you washington
finally a td
td baby
the most necessary of tds
uhhhhh boswell
wait wtf chris
ben shook that off
fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
lets go
not like this boys
if our team could step tf up i wouldnt mind just letting ben rest for the next couple weeks until thanksgiving tbh
fuck did we ever need those points before the half
give that man enough painkillers to kill a horse
great route by washington
fuck why boz
fuck sake bos
if you told me before the game that it would be 136 cowboys at the half my exact response wouldve been makes sense
vintage ben backyard football there hopefully this is just his usual playing up of an injury and he comes back slinging dick after the half
see what happens when stop running every play
did they wake up walking boot ben
he looks like hes hobbling still
you guys remember the raiders game when box missed a couple bad ben was hurt and the xray machine was all fucked up
what the fuck boz
be easy on him folks boswell wanting to fuck off today like everybody else
he probably just needs to take a shit
yeah sure miss the xp why not
who is our backup qb still mason
well this game is going exactly as i expected it
is this gonna be like the 2015 playoff game when big ben comes back to lead one final drive
anyone remember when ben tore the meniscus in that leg and couldnt plantthrow on it thats my worry
well time for bitchner to start calling the kindergarten version of the playbook cuz he cant think rudolph is good enough
this scoreline makes me anxious with my name
this is like the denver game back up comes in and tears it up but we manage to pull it together in the 4th quarter when were about to win half of you motherfuckers are gonna be all man didnt have a doubt
new drinking game take a shot every time romo says outstanding
come on ben we need ya
can we please get a turnover
gotta love those obvious pass interference calls just flying right by all the refs 3 or 4 plays with some very bad pi
why are dupree and bince out there playing coverage when neither of them are any good at it
defense finnally
come back out ben we need you
minkah just go fucking forward man you lost about 15 yards trying to get more yards being fancy
god bless this defense
glad to have the ball back but the steelers d should not be celebrating
right into minkahs arms
wake the fuck up defense you have no more chances offense isnt going to pull its weight
just saying i called the turnover and now mason 1 minute offense
lmao rudolph oh no
wtf was minkah doing on that return he had 6 blockers in front of him
fuuuuccckkkk
fuuuuuuck not only is mason going in but were back to fichtner calling plays
someone go tell ben
mason fucking rudolph
ffs rudolph time
i dont want to see this fuck out here lmao
minkahszn
mason has had his helmet on for 9 weeks waiting for this he hasnt showered he hasnt shaved he hasnt brushed his teeth
fumbled it right to him
where the fuck is dobbs
get ben back out of the locker room
rudolph vindication time
fuck rudolph
masooon timeeee tdd
never forget when that thug garrett tried killing rudolph
great now randys calling plays again
rudolph picking up right where he left off with the 2 ypa
idk if i want boz kicking after that xtra point lol
good tracking by juju
ju ju lets go
wasting as much time for ben to come back in
rudolph more like boodolph this guy fucking blows
see ya next year if its mason for the rest of the season
ive got very little confidence in mason man
just kick it you cant trust mason to both throw deep and get the pass out in under two seconds
bring back jalen samuels check offs
come on boz
earl thomas permanently concussed mason
boswell wtf
damn tbf that was a really long kick
huge little mental mistakes romo
boz u bastard
wtf boz
bos come on man we gonna need you now
boz if u hit this i fucking forgive you

boziness is good
fuck it lets goooo
ill take it
sometimes its great having my steam 45s behind i see your comments and get the news in advance and then get to watch a pivotal play stress free
wish dobbs was active at least hell make some plays with his legs if ben cant come back
500 iq play there
bosgod thanks for the false start
does ben come back after this
the upvote party today should probably be for the golden leg of the legendary bosgod
boz right now not today old friend
what did mason do through the entire offseason
lord im having heart issues i fucking knew i shouldnt of tried to break in the bud jersey this game
if ben doesnt come back its a wrap
praise be
seeing mondeux fall on his fat fucking belly trying to sack gilbert hurts please take him back to the ps
i thought we picked up dobbs on our roster
ulemieux4u i think i need you to throw out that prayer to the patron saint of second half adjustments again
rudolph is soooo bad

jfc
romo started throwing during halftime and should be warmed up and ready to roll for the second half
so if mason starts second half and gets hurt who takes his spot
adam crowley on snr says ben is expected to be back
really hope he is actually okay and they didnt just shoot his knee full of codine
59 yards holy crap
the man is walking
whos going color for our game is it romo again
im guessing it was just a bone bruise or hyperextension when he first hurt it it didnt look too serious anyways a torn ligament would leave him either on the ground or limping a lot worse than he was either way he looks a lot more comfortable now here we go steelers here we go
til cedric wilsons son is a cowboy
to be fair it took that miracle of a punt return to even get 3 more points
my liver and heart cant take this im a healthy adult and the steelers and big ben are driving me to alcoholism and a heart attack
ok minkah lets do it again
we need a td out do the defense


come on its time for some spillaining
cowboys have been blown out the last three games and here we are
its still weird to me to see other players wearing other greats numbers 92 99 and to a lesser degree 26
halftime the best time for a poop
i fucking love ben the day he retires will be a dark day for pittsburgh they really need to get a qb
thats right minkah
good tackle fitz
please get a stop here
god we make bad teams look like top 3 teams after how many years how has our front office not fixed this
can we stop dropping dupree and watt back in coverage
defense just giving up a long drive so ben has more time to recover
defense is gassed
to all the people that were saying its just the cowboys why are you scared lmao here you go
anyone else worried about chuks as a run blocker he rarely if ever gets any real push on right side of line
we are making the cowboys look so good
imagine getting man handled by fucking dallas smh
so undisciplined
totally playing like the number one team
jesus fucking christ
youd think we were playing against brady
please get a stop we are getting worked by arguably the worst offense in the league
this run defense is elite
if we dont stop 3 and 13 bro
great tackle
3rd and 13 has been automatic in weeks past
okay okay even more rest time for ben and held them lets see this
alright lets tie this shit up
our defense needs to play disciplined
keep ben clean lets get it out quick to our playmakers
can we get the run game going please
yikes who whiffed on that tackle
why is our o so impotent
badly need to not have a short drive
of course we start with three and out
at least berry brought his big boy leg today
aaaaaaand we had a three and out
why did the rams let zuerlein leave was it a money thing
lucky that wasnt picked damn
dallas wants to turn it over defense will adjust
need a sack fumble here
bring in kdot at this point hes a fucking baller and fresh
need a turnover boys minkah it happen
d needs to sack or pick gilbert to bring him back to earth
bro everyone and their mother knew they were gonna run it with pollard there stop the damn run
what the hell are we doing with our linebackers
this is not the same team since we lost bush
damn we still play washington dont we
the tackling is garbage today
are you fucking kidding me
can we fucking tackle
we gon lose
what the fucking tackling
are you serious
we fucking suck
how the fuck did he miss that tackle
whats missing here for the d is it that devin bush isnt playing
this is tough to watch
come force turn over right here
steven nelson burnt toast

doesnt matter if they get no gain a yard or a loss because the very next play the defense falls asleep
lmao right down the field were well well on the way out of this one
anyone else remember when we were 721 and missed the playoffs hopefully doesnt happen this season
zeke rubbed himself down in ky for that
oh for fucks sake
hahahahahahha ok im gonna go watch 90 day fiance
garrett gilbert is joe montana confirmed
getting diced up by an aaf qb
this guy is playing how i imagined mason would be



instead mason plays like mason
why do we always suck at tackling
i wanna get excited for these tackles for a loss but we keep giving up stupid shit like this for big gains

this is frustrating as fuck to watch
we are getting outplayed and out coached
we really miss alualu
were literally just giving them first downs
completion after completion after completion dallas has had all of the time this half but 110
this just proves that the dline cannot have bad games and our coordinators are shit

that was a good play here comes a big play for the cowboys
4th string qb absolutely shredding our defense right now
3rd and long worries me most
mike hilton please come back soon
dallas redeeming their coupon for one free game tonight
wow this kid is picking us off we look horrible
the quintessential pittsburgh trap game saw this coming as soon as the baltimore game was over
we make gilbert look like brady in his prime fucking christ
lol this is a joke
oh my god
fuck it bruh lets go home lmao
what the fuck
sutton fucking stick your nose in there
yikes going to lose to the cowgirls thanks a lot steelers now we have to hear all the cowgirl fans
defense has given up man
embarrassing
we look terrible
just gotta laugh at this point
ok tomlin we get it you still like to lose to sub 500 teams
fucking oklahomas in practice this week
soft ass secondary players and slow linebackers
this game and last week just show how much of an impact alualu has hope hea healthy soon
the defense has made one good play all game this is fucking brutal
now or never here we go baby
we stink
im embarrassed
why am i so excited to hold an aaf player to a fg drive
hey if we could you knowscore a td here and then actually hold on defense that would be great
man i really wanted this team to be the first steelers team to start 80
why is it we are always in this position and come back for the w or our opposition is in our position and almost comes back to beat us but we get a lucky stop idk why but i think we got this one in the bag just steelers being steelers
everyone here predicted this would happen i thought yinz was joking though
i cant believe it either tony
71 against a 26 team

seriously hope i look like an absolute idiot afterwards
if we lose this game they wont let us hear the end of it
just throw to juju every play lol
juju puts his heart in every game

i feel so bad rn
yup here are the steelers i know and learned to put up with it was fun while it lasted
really hope we dont run run pass punt this drive
honestly weve been subpart weve only won our last two games due to luck and this game is exposing us
cant do that
timing was just off

that was huge
fuck me we cant have anything good
just when we get something going gotta do something stupid
literally what the fuck
i guess were allergic to extra points
lol shouldve just went for 2
of course we have a td when i go outside to smoke a cigarette i would stay here if it wasnt this cold
fuck the cowbitches
they almost blocked the 59 yarder too lol
this fucking game
its all about momentum and just about every time we think we are gaining we fuck things up again and give momentum back to them feels like we are fighting an uphill battle this game
defense playing styx in their heads rn
lol so will this be the first time we get a 3 and out on the 4th string qb
cant overstate how critical those 2 misses are
some joker on dallas musta yelled andys comin
if i have to think about any bright side to this game everything that could go wrong has gone wrong and were still only down by one score
st sucks today 2 points plus that long kickoff return which costs us even more points pretty bad
saving our first 3 and out for the 4th quarter lets go d
i think our defense got a good rest hope that blocked fg doesnt disrupt our momentum
should that not have been a penalty
embarrassing
oh fuck me running dude
our special teams are special
special teams is a fucking joke
son of a mother fucker
just fucking shoot me
oh fuck off
hard to watch
fuck me
oh boy
bad special teams always haunts teams in the playoffs
fuck this fucking team just boot it out of the end zone for fucks sake
this game is shit
just not their day
pick comming up haden pick 6 now
i turned off the game as a sacrifice to the undefeated gods my my sacrifice not be in vain
two missed extra points means we have to got be looking at some scorigami here
fire danny smith
of all things fucking special teams
and thats how you piss a game away
once romo said the kick was perfect i knew
our special teams has been terrible today
fucking pathetic
what the fuck is this game
wide open cause vince cant cover yet no adjustment
bos if youre going to try to stop somebody dont just sort of wave your arms at him
are yall really about to lose to a backup qbs backup qbs backup
playing like a bunch of chucklefucks
and a wide fucking open receiver to start the drive just in line with what i expected
i havent seen special teams play this bad in years this is ridiculous
fuck this shit

wellllppppp i give up this game was not meant to be
thats the game
fire danny smith into the fucking sun
fire danny smith absolutely inexcusable play by special teams today
fire danny smith straight up fucking clown

wow just slicing through our defense today
damn this make shift oline really dominating our defense
our defense is playing like the 2019 version of our offense god fucking damnit
love it when guys just forget how to tackle
alright we can come back from this lets go defense stay positive
tomlin shows no expression to fire these guys up
i wanted us to lose a game or two so im not upsetbut watching this is just making me lose my vibe man
flag for fucking what
of course theres a flag
great pick but dont bring it out
one score game we cant get an extra point to save our lives today

oh of course theres a penalty why wouldnt there be
ok whatever fuck edmunds we good
it is time to come back my dudes
lets go minkah shouldve stayed down but we needed a big play
feed juju
now make the int count boys
the fact we still have a chance to win shows how bad the cowboys are
have the steelers gotten a sack today
anyone remember that stat by juju 2 97 yard touchdowns
thanks minkah for coming up huge but you should have taken a knee when you had the chance
minkah definitely has a home here in pittsburgh future franchise player
those missed boswell xps really looming right now
jesus come on now do you want to win
really no reason to hype that bama lsu game this year going to be a blow out by bama
theres some breathing room
body slam out of bounds is fine now
bens in his zone
go for the first on 3rd and see what happens i was waiting for a bomb
7 points and take lot of time off the clock please
nice chokeslam oit of bounds there damn called less than that a penalty last week
td on the way
find juju
i was convinced they were gonna get a safety the way this game has been going
kind of interesting how dallas wasnt flagged for a late hit outofbounds there while pittsburgh was last week with lamar in my opinion neither should have been flagged
holy shit dj caught it
these formations come from canada
hobbled ben healthy ben
fichtner ill fucking do it again
conservative but efficient good plays here
is that like 3 or 4 straight throws to the left lol its working
99 yard drive bens idol is elway thats music to his ears
my asshole is so clenched i could cut diamonds with my sphincter
i like this 4 wr set with ben saying fuck it to the run game
that was a forward pass
the monkeys paw curls
fuck me
sure why not

edit ill accept that
refs saving ass
that was a gift
make em pay
i dont understand this obsession with running empty sets and telegraphing the fact that its a pass play every down when were needing a score
of fucking course

edit saved by the flag
the refs finally make a good call
yo i used to like lve what a little fucker
i dont like needing red ball but i wont complain
we gotta get lucky vs a 26 team lmao
claypool does not take shit from anyone
tree needs to bring back weekly videos on this team
i was just lookin at you and you were just looking at me
dont even get why he got hot headed made a solid stand up tackle there
way more fighting going on in this game than i expected i know were technically rivals but our rivalry hasnt really been very relevant in awhile
mcfarland did kinda start that but lve cant be throwing punches there and costing his team
well everything is going our way this drive we gotta score now
beers on him if we win
half this drive is dallas penalties lmao
thats not a punch come on guys this is football
that was fortunate
im cool with the cowboys winning it for us
thank god the cowboys decided to shoot themselves in the foot
mcfarland got his hand in his face only because he was literally humping him dude gets triggered and throws a punch what a cunt
i like romo and i understand his bias but he really has to tone it down a bit lol
they need to do something here went all this way and now theyre struggling
3rd and 8 run time
cmon boz please
that feels like a cleveland coaching decision
not having that pat hurts
pls boz
boswells favorite number is 21


5d chess bitches
does the d have gas left in the tank
show em who you are defense
canaday got beat again is he hurt hes usually solid
those extra points we have to pull through on this
were only down a run or a goal or something
praise be
come on defense get the ball back please
bosgod is infallible and im pretty sure crawford is actually aaron donald in a cowboys jersey
all i ask is that our defense looks like our defense for this one fucking drive abysmal today otherwise
i dont wanna see this special teams unit on the field again kick the ball out
were missing bush in the middle of our defense they are picking on spillane today avery williamson was a big addition
crawford is getting through that middle on the snap every fucking timethank god we got 3pts defense time
guess im blacking out before 8pm tonight
with the way special teams has gone this game im not confident in a field goal for the win
please kick the ball out of the end zone
finally they kick it out
wed have the lead with those two xps ugh
cant make a stop
can they just get one damn stop
of course we dont stop it
id be curious to see a study of which sports fan bases have the worst heart problems pittsburgh has to be up there given our expectations year in and year out

no ones gonna talk about it but lots of credit to the cowboys ol
this has to be the stop now
we cant keep being gashed up the middle
welcome to the game henry
blue wall means push zeke with a big man
he mondid it
good thank christ he overthrew it
give it back to us
lets goooo its fourth downnnn
thank fuck for that overthrow
mondooooooo
gilbert dude finally looked like a cast off reject bum
mondid
he finally did something
good hands ray ray
like what the fuck happened this week
lucky lucky miss cowboys should just go for it chances are in their favor
lets go offense
everyone make sure to call your health insurance provider to let them know to have an ambulance on standby for the inevitable heart attack that is about to ensue
lets fucking go offense protect the ball and move it down
eat up the clock score here and we win
deep breaths everyone we dont need more heart failure
99 needs a black visor
absolutely have to go down the field and waste most if not all of the clock whether a fg or td preferred obviously we cannot leave time on the clock
now go get the td to put us at 25 points and keep the streak alive
can someone explain this to me isnt pushing off lineman to boost yourself over the line illegal like didnt they change that because of troy
come on you bastards score
claypool catch the ball please
catch the ball man
how many drops is this
ben throwing too low atm
i like claypool but dude sometimes just cant catch shit even if it hits his hands
another drop by claypool
ooo hes gotta catch that
fucking claypool man
claypool really looking like a rookie today
ugh were gonna lose because of a missed pat
what a terrible play
claypool has been bad today
we got bailed
i have to believe they are just fishing for pis right
ben got one

he really got one
claypool has to make those catches hes been off tonight
what terrible offensive play calls why the fuck are we going for it all
refs didnt call a pi so they gifted us that thanks
i cant wait till the refs won that game comments
dallas penalties are keeping us from loosing right now
i will take that cheap penalty
make them pay
best part about being a top team is getting the top team calls from the refs thanks nfl
i hate that call but ill take it
the fix is in
ill take it but what a bad 3rd and 10 execution
run it and kill some clock
a win is a win
getting bailed by penaltiess booiss

thats one of the luckiest things ive ever see happen in a game like this
diontae
stay in bounds
diontae you shifty fuck yurrrrr
way to go down instead of risking a fumble
losing to one of the worst teams in the leaguebeating them and having boys fans complain about the refsits a hard decision
stop getting out of bounds fuckers
run the ball
can i get a touchdown amen
well

fuck this game

but its nice to be close to taking the win here
why did you run outta bounds
theory the steelers play down to competition so often because ben plays best under pressure when he feels rushed when he does hes a hof qb when he doesnt feel rushed hes a mediocre qb so weak teams stick with us and sometimes pull it out
td baby
have we just abandoned the run game
x200b

touchdown
claypool in bounds please
lets fucking go baby never count us out
get hurdled you dumb bitch
ok ebron that was sexy
now

the question is


does gilbert have the gusto here
mvp ben
now can the d hold
claypool needs to catch holy shit
ooooooouuuuu
go for 2
i wish we wouldve taken more time off the clock
awesome job scoring but way too much time left
lets go d
ill take it but thats a lot of time left defense please
can we not all out blitz
ebrontosaurus
claypool youre 64 and like 220 how are you getting bullied like that on the goal line bud
defense usually unfucks themselves on these putaway stands


usually
a stop and theyre gone come on
this is looking like that game against the terrible raiders about a decade ago when we let bruce gradkowski drive the field
home run kick this ball out
all signs point to game winning drive by bum fuck gomer pile huh
should have went down instead of scoring please defense pleaseeeee
please dont let zeke run straight up the middle
cmon defense please stop them
lets go defense
come on boys
nelson with a second missed tackle that i noticed
hey google play renegade on 100
our special teams have been playing a little special today
no one expected gilbert
come on watt strip sack
d d d
anyone gonna buy some of this stuff advertised i might buy mcdonalds and thats it
the steelers have given up less than 20 points despite the offense being mediocre for most of the game thats a decent performance
sutton ughhhhhh
im gonna be on blood thinners after this
so close ah
you gotta pick that
alualu must make a huge difference
show me the steel curtain
lets go defense
lets go defense lets go
okay d i promised my first born on the last drive but you can have my second born this time
itsss thirrrdddddd downnnnnn
bobby spills solid in man coverage on a quick receiving tight end in a big moment hell yeah
let go d keep it up
not in the grasp there
just hold them off for 2 more downs and were good maybe
wow im amazed he got that out before going down
alright yall i think its renegade time fire up those speakers
haden saved that play wow didnt expect that pass to go through at all
one more
please sutton
everyone play renegade
haden you animal
not ruled down on the sack oo

how was that not whistled
watt finally gets home and cant finish

well he just finished it there
like 3 holds on steelers there obvs
holy fuck
haden you have been redeemed
omg
omg ty god
yeah boys wooooooooo
ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh get fuckkkkeddd
huuuuuge when the game matters
thats our fing defense right there
waiting 58 min to do that
cam heyward stud muffin
sacked his ass ohhhhhhhhh yeah
yessssssss
80 you stupid bitches
that was a filthy bull rush by cam lmao grown man strength
lets goooooooooooooooo
80
thats a pretty late renegade they played there
cam and tj
remember that people whined about this d all game
lets go yall we did it
bend dont break
same time next week guys
major props to garrett felt like we were playing tom brady for some of that game haha
cam fucking heyward
hayward playing in a youth league
what is this madness how dare we show up in the 4th and win it did no one tell them they reversed the script
why does team have to play with my heart
you absolutely love to see it
wheres the dude with the doritos i think you saved this game
lets get a fg to preserve the 25 points streak
heyward is a beast that last sack was amazing
our hearts did not deserve this punishment ill take it though but heads need to roll here there is no reason this should have been as close as it was our offense has some issues it has to sort out but i am confident we can get that sorted before next game lets go baby
game aint even over
i cant believe we pulled this stupid game out of our ass
i accept tj as my daddy
were lucky we have star power one or two players play every week the rest relax if they all would step up wed be unstoppable
what the fuck
just try the fg jesus hell

why not fg
why did they go for it
i miss the days where we couldve picked up short yardage with a strong run game
are they trying to lose
what was the fucking point of signing derek watt
no no no no no please
that needed to be a fg wtf
kick the god damn field goal
why the fuck did we not kick it
we dont deserve this game
wtf
why in the hell do we never qb sneak
why did they do that lol
this has been the worse run blocking game ive seen in years
never go full retard
why didnt we kick
why dont you just take the fucking 3 points sure they can still get 8 but takes the td and the 2 pt conversion this team just trying to kill its fans hearts
why did they not kick a field goal
p u c k e r t i m e ii
questionable if we end up losing this game
fucking idiots watch dallas win now because of that
but i thought we won the game already
come on defense please hold em again
thats a catch i think
field goal
you dont win games with that fucking shit even if we win thats the worst call ive seen in years
lol mike was literally just shaking hands on the sideline like it was over
your st coach not being able to figure out why you cant get a kick up is an indictment on the coacholine and st
the only reason not going for a fg makes sense is because crawford is running through our line like theyre not there otherwise retarded lol
why
this is insane why didnt they kick a field goal and make it impossible for them to win even if they managed to march down the field im so confused
why not a fg theyd need a td 2 woth zero timeouts
okay 3rd born but im running out of future kids guys
steelers should have at least tried to pass for the first down
if they lose because they didnt kick that field goal
lets go defense
tomlin did that to try and stick it to a rival or something like that
im not sure why our run blocking is so bad but its really become a problem
dear god dear god lets gooooo defense
my this is amazing
i dont like this
so why didnt the steelers attempt the fg and instead go for it am i missing something
blatant hold on tj that will never get called
fucking heart attack team
hey i havent watched a lot of football but im confused why steelers were not able to take a knee to run out the clock under 2 minutes can someone please explain to me i have seen teams do this before
i feel sick
we didnt need this late game drama
holy shit headlock on tj is totally allowed
i dont feel comfortable
i cant even sit lol
lots of heart attacks happening
holding
cant help thinking if dak was playing we wouldnt have been close here
were literally just letting them get wide open and letting them catch it
lets go defense
just need a sack
lets go defense
i hate every second of this
exact situation as last week
i cant breathei cant breathe
lets fuckin go
bud was almost there
phew that was too close for comfort
waaaaay to close
put claypool in
thank god
hoooolyyyyy shit that was messy but ill take it
fuck yes thank you god
sphincter relaxing
get the fuck in
fitzpatrick again
never a doubt s
minka was worth 3 1st round picks
i cant take this
aaaaaaaand unclench
your gonna get beatbut you dont want it to be to the cowboys
breathe a sigh of relief
that was a terrible game
80 baby ugly but still great and kings of the nfl record wise not sure if my heart can take 8 more games like this season
holy shit i need a drink or should i say more drinks
history in the makinggggg
two drives in 30

this sub season over we fucking suck gg fire tomlin

yall are children
i get that he used to play for them but could romo make it anymore obvious that hes rooting for the cowboys getting mad annoying
can we complain now i hope so because our team looks like hot dogshit right now and it isnt getting better
stop the count stop the count
3rd and 4 so lets throw a fucking bomb
im prepared for 3 straight losses with this performance
he threw a punch fuckin toss him lol this wasnt a big deal from either guy
2 missed xp are going to cost the game
dumbest thing tomlin has ever done
i dont know if its james connor or the run blocking but our rushing has been anemic lately and it really isnt helping at all
and thus begins a new streak of not getting a touchdown on the opening drive

should of had that mapletron
that just went right through his hands
claypool has to be kicking himself after that drop
this guy be like tom fucking brady out there
what the fuck
trap game time baby
everyone getting panicky either didnt watch last years offense or are likely new fans
playing down to shitty teams

this is the way
i am wholly unconcerned at this point
rsteelers be like tomlin is on the hot seat right now
i can hardly come in these threads anymore with how reactionary everyone is it is so much more stressful games last hours dudes chill out
ok tomlin i see you play conservative right out the gate on a practice squad bold
play to lose classic fucking steelers
difference between us and the chiefs imo
all day ive envisioned admiral akbar screaming its a trap im not being negative were still an amazing team and no one needs to be fired but i really wanted to come in swinging and punch them in the mouth
looks like ben told randy to sit down with his coloring book and took control of the offense
you know how theyve stuffed every single draw weve tried so far lets run more draws
yeah lets go in the gun with our weakest back on 3rd and short
connor is hurt sucks it had to happen to the most durable back in the league
sometimes i just feel bad for our defense offense just trots out there only to do nothing and expects the defense to just bail us out
i live in spain but the s is silent
god our secondary is absolute trash this is absurd to watch
jets fan here does ben not look jujus way at all anymore ive seen like 34 times hes wide open and ben doesnt even seem to looking for him just curious because i think hes still great thanks dudes and fuck the browns
bruh why the fuck is watt covering lamb
fichtner and butler make me want to gouge my fucking eyes out
i hate our coordinators we win in spite of them
im late to the party what the fuck is going on why is tj playing coverage downfield instead of murdering this 3rd string idiot
the steelers and playing like hot garbage on the road against the worst teams name a more iconic duo
i have never been less surprised by a bad start in my life there has never been a more obvious trap game in recent memory
at least theres no heart attack if its a blowout silver linings
this game will hinge on the fact that they didnt get 7 on that drive
thank god he fucked that up because otherwise he would have had the first

what the fuck is going on today
i just love how quickly everyone in here is turning on tomlin yall sound stupid af
15 says next possession plays out as run run pass kick
know whos not surprised jim steelers fans who have read this book before
you give mason or duck a competent oc those two look like qbs last year

arians saved the 2010 season when ben missed those 4 games by letting charlie batch and dennis dixon make plays

todd haley put landry jones in a position to succeed against new england in 2016

i dont think fitchner excels in the essential death sentences those two were given on paper those games
injured ben best ben
please bring out knee brace ben knee brace ben has 10 super bowls
rudolph blows i told you guys he shouldnt be on this team fucking dent brain
if big ben doesnt come back at the half we are donesky
still think dobbs and duck are better than mason
so let me get this straight fichtner has us throw check down passes all game

we have a backup qb whos ass and were at a 54 yard field goal range and we throw no check downs
they had nearly a minute and this is what they got god damn it
said a prayer for boz and it paid off
if ben is hurt we are fucked
were going 97 with rudolph
were 70 and ben finally got his first tweak of the year its over for everyone now limpy ben asshole destroyer
i hate that a majority of our games are heart attack games when they shouldnt be
defense has gotta make a stop and get the ball back to the offense
why was dupree on cooper
activate hurt ben
im oddly at peace 7 hurt his knee hes about to go super saiyan
3 and out good stuff
can we get ben to draw up his own plays again
this offense is a joke today just wow

its either or and we cold today
classic trap game smh
the ravens exposed our run defense
theres that elite rush defense
ok thats enough getting kicked in the teeth wake up fight back
hey lots of time still to play
weak flag there
this is so on brand for the steelers i can always expect the steelers and wvu to disappoint me in games they should easily win
fucking hilarious
why the fuck wouldnt u take the penalty on the try
we look terrible
our defense is absolute flaming dog shit
were losing to a 5th string qb
on the bright side in terms of tiebreakers for playoff seedings its best to lose to an nfc team
stupid energy bringing that out of the end zone
wouldve been nice to kneel it down but whatever i guess
i hope the two extrapoint attempts dont come back to bite us
he really just punched a rookie
that fucker just punched our man throw that bum off the field
this is the year of tipped balls for ben
take a broom and jam it sideways up my fucking ass
imagine if you just tied the game 33 instead of going for a pointless 4th attempt
why does this team gotta pull this shit so much theyve had one blowout and most of the rest have been close the defense also hasnt shown me anything to say theyll be able to stop dallas fucking aye
defense cannot get to this guy have we actually sacked him yet
goddamn zeke is ugly as fuck
thats a fucking bullshit rule but ill take it i guess
its an nfl rule you cant hit the qb in the helmet
they left too much time on the clock though
our defense finally did something
10000000000 coaching fuck up what an atrocity
i swear tomlin is a fucking moron kick the field goal
what a garbage coaching decision 511 on third down and you think thatll work
sometimes you gotta take an l to get knocked off your high horse
tomlin is an idiot why not kick the field goal
okay ive been thinking about this more i actually get not kicking the field goal but since theyre expecting run on 4th and 1 why not try your luck at passing clock stops either way but damn i just feel queasy
again if you were one of those people saying fuck this teamyou know where the door is feel free to close it behind you
got to love watching the steelers cause they make ever game exciting they could be playing again a middle school team and it will be a 1 touchdown game
so we drop this game


takes all the pressure off of being undefeated


continue to win super bowl as scheduled


its called strategery look it up
next week we will lose to the stvincent middle school practice squad
this is turning into a game thats going to come to haunt us come seeding time
lucky im sure well win in the 2nd half but this is pathetic one half a game where we play terrible
too bad our 3rd 4th string qb wasnt that good last year
sorry guys i went to get ice cream and missed the first hour of the game im back now so well get back into it
dude why does tj still jump when a qb tries to throw it fucking hit him
looks like no second half adjustments for our defense
on that gimpy knee when we return
i bet on you guys for the first time ever and this is what happens i think i did this to you
if dak was healthy the cowboys would have already blown this game wide open
we still going to win
ebron makes mistakes at the worst fucking time
of course boswell makes his career long by 6 yards while also going 02 on extra points makes perfect sense
71

would take that at the start of the season though
the steelers offense has been dependent on getting pi calls for huge chunks and making the dbs back off the cowboys have done a great job of either covering cleanly or just not getting called
if you dont like this game you dont like steeler football
bens deep ball is super inaccurate change my mind

holy shit we are a terrible 70 team this is so fucking bad our staff is unable to make any significant changes to our gameplan when we need to fuck this
calling it right now were still gonna win this game and all you fairweather fans can go fuck yourselves
can ravens fans quit bitching about the refs now since they got handed a w by them this week
rivers is honestly so useless
claypool has to get that
can we please pick up a punter in the free agency 34 yards to the 15 hes awful
wow was not expecting that keep
and none of this is even the least bit surprising
why tf does the defense look so confused crazy how we can look so sloppy agaisnt inferior opponents

literally playing like we have the lead with how conservative this is pathetic is a word that comes to mind
yep dont even attempt to get a first down
ok fire fitchner and let ben draw up plays in the dirt
someone should tell the steelers that losing games like this is why they never get the first seed
ben needs to do what he did last game and punt fichtners shitty game plan to the curb and start calling his own shots
when was the last time we had a fat head coach
this team absolutely needs todd haley at the helm
steelers have a history of wearing down teams


people come out psyched to play us


theyll tire out
how predictable was this game lol
hey so i dont actually give a shit if roethlisberger loves being in shotgun on third and a yard he needs to be under center
everyone fuckin relax
steeler nation on suicide watch
trap gaaaaaaame
whenever 99 is in bad things happen
tomlin pull out the backups put in starters and open the playbook we need to put these fuckers down holy shit
wake the fuck up its the 26 cowboys

this team is such a fucking embarrassment
getting out coached by mccarthy right now not a great look
2020 is finally reversing were returning to normalcy again
i think mike tomlin needs to be fired

s
playing down to competition as always
someone wake ben up hes missing the game
we dont play down to our competition
fichtners gone rogue guys hes gonna run em inside until the cowboys quit lmao
yeah were losing
kill me
if we lose to these fucking bums then bitchner needs to be on the hot seat we play phenomenal against good teams but we run non stop which doesnt work against one of the shittiest in the nfl fuck off fitchner
i ask you now can we panic yet
you guys wanna score before the half or nah ben probably
ben is throwing this game so far looks bad
i like how ppl defend randy fat fuck
that one handed nonsense was stupid washington
wheres the guy who said how long till ben fakes an injury
why dont steelers just run shotgun spread and let a ben do this all game
how does boswell miss an extra point indoors
missed pat and ben in the locker room could anything else go wrong before the half
rudolph hasnt missed a step with the 1 yard passes
honestly dont understand why dobbs isnt second string
boswideleft
did we ice our own kicker
fuck you haters
it annoys me that my hulu feed is 3045 aeconds slower than reddit so no drama in this 59 yarder
that was the luckiest shit ever but ill take it
we are fortunate to only be down 4pts if ben wasnt coming back id be seriously worried
captain fat fuck leader among men being tough as nails
can haden defend a pass
things are not ideal at present there are still two quarters
come on td drive here
much respect to big al and all our troops
just get a first down for once holy shit
we fucking suck
tf can we please stop a 3rd and long fuckin trap games
how is this offense murking us in time of possession
why not go for it when they have been stomping all over us ill take it ig
i hate games where we travel west especially if its the damn raiders
yes tony i can believe this is the game were going to lose
ben is ass today
out of bounds should have stopped the clock
i wish brown was still here to complain about not enough targets
juju is still the best receiver on this team and hot take it isnt even close
shoulda gone for 2
boswell 02 on extra points 1 missed field goal

1 60yard field goal

wtf
imo

its obvious this team came in thinking this week was going to be a cake walk from the dropped passed to missed blocks to the passionless defense thus far no one including myself thought this would even be a competition i hate the playing down to teams moniker butdamn if it aint true
worst undefeated team in history
steelers look 07 not 70 my stomach is in knots watching this team right now holy fuck
this front 7 is an embarrassment
defense has been ass since the 2nd half against tennessee
i dont understand why dbs do that just take the touchback you arent ed reed
int is great but you really really gotta go down in the end zone there
i just yelled no pittsburgh at colin come on dude
thats 3 flubs for nantz dude needs to get it together
trailing a 27 team by one score in the 4th and the defense makes a momentumswinging interception on the goal line to give us a chance

if you dont like that then you dont like steelers football
whats gonna be close lol he threw a punch
vander is a bitch
yeah the only reason he isnt getting tossed is because it was open handed
lol our offense is so bad
if only claypool caught that td in the beginning of the game this game would be so different
will the defense be shredded like cheese this drive probably but i have hope
cant even beat the 26 cowboys
their backup oline is outphysicaling our guys
d line has been bad since alula i cant spell his name got hurt
holy shit mongo made a play
come on ben cant let this asshole team beat him a third straight time and likely the last time hell play em
so weve got to find a way to score while draining the clock hire me steelers i have it all figured out
weve gotten bailed out on two shitty calls wow were not normally this lucky
when the refs bail out brady when the refs bail out big ben
claypool is making countless mistakes today
just keep them out of the end zone no chunk plays
ebron is the next heeeeeeath miller
tony romo is deflated
ben is praying im praying were all praying
i have a bad feeling that they go right down our throats
maybe we didnt kick the fg because bosgod has been a bit shakey
we choking hard than that defender choking watt
boswell you stupid bitch
permission to be a steeler fan for the day im trying to hook up with a steelers fan and she is diehard i was given specific instructions not to show up until after the game but she kept messaging me irate messages about the way the game was going so now were watching the game together and discussing damn near every play and why everyone did something
patrick mahomes is going to eat up this buttercream defense in the playoffs

the 70 steelers are going to lose to the 4th string led cowboys absolute laughing stock in rnfl and we deserve it
now these are the steelers i know
seems the consensus is the same anyone want to start a changeorg petition to fire fichtner

were 70 after beating two really good teams in back to back weeks we have a slow start and everyone wants to burn everything down lol you fucks make me sick

yall do realized the bucs barely beat the giants right shit happens its the nfl well be alright well make adjustments and win this game relaaxxxxxxxx
i dont get why people are blaming tomlin bens accuracy has been shit

blame ben
we are so fucked if ben goes down he is the only reason our offense can do anything
damn didnt realize boswells knee was injured too
omg im not even a steelers fans and i hate these refs you aint gotta throw a flag for every play just let them fucking play
to all the rudolph haters please relax yes he looks unpolished but it took 20 minutes to get ben warmed up
lol were down 7 to a 26 team
3rd and 4 better try to bomb it 40 yards
im about to shut this off they fucking suck and if they cant beat the 26 cowboys then they dont deserve the playoffs
our defense sucks again
19 points on this best defense in the nfl fucking pathetic group of players
should have went for 2
yall fucking suck lol cheer up
really vander esch punch him while hes on the ground fuck you
were gonna lose by either 1 or 2

i dont disagree with not kicking it i hate the play call pass it or sneak it
panthers and chiefs is only a two point game
would be a classic trap game but theyre on their 4th fuckin string qb have to think our boys can pull the dub even on the 3rd straight away game
lets do this steelers its going to be a good game for anyone out there looking for a live match stream without need to register check out this link and enjoy d
we go up 4214 in the third ben rests 4th d rests a couple guys oh shit cowboys score 3rd td of the half with 2 mins left get an onsides kick cowboys drive down to 4yrd line tj steps up gets 5th sack of the day steelers win
well this is gonna be spicy
currently my local cbs station is down just my luck
honestly guys i know we are all thinking it might be close but im feeling a 40 pt win
we got romo again nice
x200b

tracy wolfson has wayyyyy too much makeup on
i know everybody is saying this is an easy win but weve seen how these kinds of games have gone as steelers fans lets hope we leave dallas with a win a healthy team
romo is still sucking raven ass from last week
lets go boys
looks like a steeler home crowd
let me guess 3 straight conner runs
sitting down for a very relaxing game im sure
lets gooooo
the lumbering beast
damn it ive been watching at my parents house who have actual cable the last few weeks and now im watching on the cbs app and i forgot its a full minute behind the rest of you jagoffs
lamar who
big ben the mobile quarterback keeps on truckin
ben

hopefully he outrushes elliot
conner should be able to go over 100 yards in this game run or pass pick your poison today
love me some steelers third down conversions
messy
hell of a shot but fucking damn near picked

my heart was not ready for that
picture quality on gamepass is so bad today for sone reason
damn it
pi
thats was a hold but its cool dont call it
i guess the only silver lining is that the claypool drop equals out the cowboys int drop
no need to tackle gilbert he can do that himself
tj with the opposite assignment today
lets go d
hulu tv is such a whopping piece of shit if youre looking for a cable alternative please just pay the extra cash and go with youtubetv
tj watt is gonna kill someone today
tomlin has seen enough
theres nothing else to talk about but gilbert
defense picking up where it left off last week
what happened to pine richland yuppie dinnuci
wtf defense
defense needs to put in more effort this is lazy and they can do better
we are steelering
well then dallas moving the ball with ease early
wow this is gonna be a long night
ok lets hold for a fg and hopefully thats a wake up call
were gonna be fine dallas is having their best drive of the game
this is where teams realize inside the redzone theres not so much space with this d


holding them to a fg
sacked
took long enough
yessirrrrr
bend dont break
bend dont break
rack em up sack em up
ok the defense did their job now its your turn offense
getting stopped by the cowboys d very fascinating
our playcalling is sooooooooooo inconsistent
nice run play what a surprise
run run pass
not a fan of the play calling on that drive at all
love watching this absolutely fucking love it lol
fantastic offense so far boys good thing youre playing the cowgirls
offense looks great against this stellar dallas defense
defense is gonna have to do all the scoring
why am i wasting my time watching this
alright boys let em have it

you can have it
too early to booright
guess we have to wait for the 2nd half to see steelers offense
this offense needs to shape the fuck up this play calling is fucking abysmal
imagine relying on ur defense to beat the cowboys
lets go berry
so time to go nohuddle
were off to a bad start
berry has been eating his wheaties
smells like randy sphincters doing
good punt lets get the ball back
whats up with this play calling let ben cook
rabdy is a fat fucking moron
offense can not afford to start off slow almost every damn game sooner or later its going to bite us in the ass
this medical ad hitting a bit too close to home

literally me anytime the steelers play
lol oh man this fucking team
gilbert is 34 ben is 14
id sneak it i hope they dont though
alright time to score
joe
why is haden catching punts
joe hayden does punts
wait joe haden on punt return
mapletron
i was confused but i guess they left the d on in case the offense ran a play
ben at work
yes claypool
this is good let ben play
now were cooking
mcfarland snatching ankles lol
that is hadens 3rd career punt return 1st ever with us
is conner injured
the best 26 in team history
mcfarland tried to get fancy there
wish he would have kept going instead of cutting back and forth after the first cut he coulda gotten 2 more
what happened to conner
what happened with connor i thought he was healthy
fentanyl fichtner
where is conner
god damnit
didnt get it

are we secretly ass
snell had that one game im over the guy
we are throwing at will lets run it four times in a row
even if connor is hurt why isnt snell in
96 is killing us right now
ughhh why are we running up the gut twice with mcfarland
orakorafor got wrecked
what a stupid play call
yeah take conner off the field on 4th and 1genius
what in the actual fuck am i watching seriously offense
our line is asleep
sneak the damn thing
we make shit so fucking hard its unbelievable imagine if we have someone that follows the kiss formula
no conner lmao
is conner hurt
where is connor
meh worth the risk dont know why our running offense is so ass today though
this offense can suck my fucking asshole
ugh
if youre gonna run the ball on 4th and less than a yard why the hell would you line up in the shotgun
contain lamar but eat shit on gilbert
offensive line is absolutely garbage in run blocking
what the fuck is this playcalling
ben shouldve taken that
holy fuck i had a massive headache before kick off this is frustrating
running up the middle didnt work

randy yeah just do it again anyway
this is depressing lol
fuck mondeux
it was 2nd and 3 right
might actually fall asleep during this weak ass game
classic
out run blocking is fucking embarrassing
gilbert jackson
henry mondeaux
i missed the first quarter is conner hurt why arent they running him on these short yardage situations
i thought mondeaux would have went back to the practice squad
3 runs in a row going nowhere wtf its head scratching honestly
are you fucking kidding me
classic steelers against a dog shit team
thats fucking horrible play design
offensive play calling is awful today
just wow
99 bad
nobody told me we were playing kyler murray
lamar gilbert here
offensive line is ass right now
lol wtf is happening here
gilbert playing like vanilla vick
are you fucking kidding me
out hunting whats the summary so far thought wed be up at this point
i knew wed give up a lot of yards to lamar jackson but were seriously going to give up yards to garrett gilbert
this is so sad
such a fucking hold on watt
watt was damn near tackled
they will have to start accounting for gilbert as a runner
cant run for 1 yard cant make tackles cant contain qb
keith butler is actively trying to take tj out of the game
vince williams man come on
we really need to get a solid hit on gilbert hes playing way too comfortable atm
chiseled adonis called that we would play down to the cowboys its in our blood
lmao cowboys are getting hyped about getting a 1st down
this is embarrassing
is this aaron rodgers
can we get back to blitzing out of man coverage
what the fuck
big groan
well this is fun
wow fucking terrible
of course
absolutely pathetic
lol we didnt even show up today
haha fucking trash team
for fucks sake nobody covering on top
jesus fucking christ
pathetic
they always lose when they travel west
jesus fuck
seriously put tj on lamb smfh
no more zone please
damn against the cowboys
false start wtf
dallas fucking dallas
good lord
how the fuck is this happening
bruh
were going to lose this one of all arent we
why im not surprise
why

embarrassing
should tony romo recuse himself from the game since he played for the cowboys
getting outsmarted so far

we need 7 points this drive right now
lets just get some points on the board 10 is chump change we got this
both randy and keith need fired they hold back both units immensely
when do we get nervous guys when they go down 24
we just look tired man
false start was so bad everybody stopped playing
disappointing but not surprised
put claypool in coverage on d man we might get somewhere
tj against cd genius
can we stop playing down to competition this ish has been going on for to many years
i wanna say im surprised but im really not
we make backup qbs look like tom brady every goddamn time
maybe this damn cowboys td will open their eyes theyre playing like trash today
ah theres the steelers i know and love good to see nothing has changed
feels like the steelers are experimenting why the heck is tj dropping into coverage seems like every time he does a chunk play occurs
i dont want to hear anybody defending either of our coordinators
not surprised hopefully we look better after the half
the entire oline false started and no flag rip
i am embarrassed to be wearing the black and gold after what ive seen so far
conner back with instant impact
time to wake up and put 7 points on the board offense
oline getting bitched right now lol
run run pass excellent
is this our play down game
crazy first string rb runs the ball better than the 3rd string
if we 3 and out here
fire fichtner
oh my god

stop playing the same fucking play
3 and out against dallas
terrible throw ben
this is making me fucking sick
defense needs to make some plays
im sorry dude but diontae will never be a 1 or 2 wr insanely inconsistent
why cant we just sling the dang ball
what the fuck man
the fuckin kinda foofoo fairy fucking toss was that
bad throw
could we stop running it up the fucking middle
ahahahahahahahahahahahaha
please god not a 3 and out
die randy die
im about to turn this shit off and enjoy the outside
lolololololololololololololololo
i cant believe this shit
its happening

its happening
i want to die
fuck me
man this shit is just irritating
this is embarrassing

its probably possible to argue that weve got some of the worst play callers in the league imagine not having randy as oc
lol holy shit that was a good play by the cowboys
fuck that was a great call by the cowboys
of course
we will be fine haha
3 and fucking out sad and pathetic
another 3 and out
another fucking 3 and out who said our defense was better than theirs
hey diddle diddle two plays up the middle

maybe next drive well open it up probably not but we can hope right
stunning and brave performance boys
saved by the flag
that was a great punt return
lmao
dont worry its all part of the plan to give the cowboys false hope
i hope someone says something at half time
no
wow just wow
christ
fucking horse cock
i guess if were going to be exposed its best to not do it against the ravens or titans disgusting anyways

the memes are manifesting into reality
lmao
this is my worst nightmare
time for more alcohol
hahahaha block in the back
even our special teams is being outcoached
i shall be passing away
plenty of time to get our shit straight
ok ok on the bright side that punt was a heater bad coverage tho
they have got too cocky sitting at 70
we caught a break there
great work bince
if that guy doesnt trip the convert 3rd and long
guys im not a steeler fan but i made a huge bet on the steelers to win

should i be worried yet
we need to score here lets see hoping fat randy aint calling plays here or else we go into half 13 down and they get ball second half not looking good
alright jokes over time to get at least a fg and go in with some momentum and shut them out 2nd half
i cannot handle this it hurts
ben has to step the fuck up and we need to keep 30 off the field i dont get why they always put mcfarland in and then abandon him as soon as he has a conneresque run
bens accuracy has been horrible this season how can you expect the defense to be good when theyre on the field 90 of the time
cant keep keep calling run run dump need some better calls
i wonder how much that ad costs purely in network time not production or any of that
any given sunday
we need to play with some fucking urgency now this is now we are in danger of losing this game mode get to work you boys
regardless of what happens the rest of this game this team needs to learn how to not be jekyll and hide between halves of football this team is either dominating or cant fucking beat a jv football team
i feel like we never get juju involved until the 4th quarter
i dont know why guys but im getting an urge to buy a flashlight from amazon
we need a run run pass drive here
dink dunk
backyard football time
i like the momentum were having rn
if we score a td on this drive well win this game
why didnt he just keep going to the sideline
finally a little something happening
side note justin herbert a real one
if we just stop giving james conner the football our offense will put drives together
bens deep ball is shot
fuckfuckfuck
ouch

x200b

ben please be okay
and ben is injured
just tuned in and im shocked how the fuck does this happen
another overthrow how many does he average per game
here comes the fan favorite rudy
sowhy was watt covering cee dee lamb
most of this offensive line needs replacing
holding claypool and leading with the head on a qb
someone needs to be fired offensive line coach fichtner someone
oline didnt show up today against a team that cant stop the run and hasnt got the qb latley
not mason no please god
i blame this injury on all the dumb fucks in here saying ben is trash and should be benched
ben bby maybe rest a series
oh boy
gg boys
we need points here
that looked painful
hurt ben is best ben
johnsons jersey get ripped

and thats not the sort of shot you want big ben taking hopefully just knocked the wind out of him
injections for ben incoming at halftime
hurt ben best ben lets fucking go
sucks to see it but that was incidental not really lawrences fault
activate dobbs i dont think mason is ready after last season
get the walking boot asap
ben limping throws a nice pass thats injured ben for you lol
never question bens toughness he beat the ravens with a crooked nose
anytime ben takes a big hit i get super stoked to know we have maon back there to lead us into oblivion
just tuned in bow bad are we eating shit knew we were gonna have one of these days but didnt expect it v dallas
holy shit mapletron
hurt ben is best ben
ben out there through sheer force of will
shit
get ben some painkillers
pulling a greg jennings against the cowbows
god damn is there a human alive tougher than ben
hopefully a knee brace at halftime helps
at least if ben needs to miss a few games there is time to heal and we can afford a few losses
thank god
helmet to helmet he better be fined over that

ben keeps on doing it td washington
yep ball is gonna be high now that his plant leg is hurt
lets fucking go
best receiving corps in the league right there
wow
lets goooo
there we go
fuck yeah
washington
i love how ebron is so willing to go for the stiff arms and fight defenders for extra yards
there we gooooo
oh come the fuck on make that
offense deciding to show up lets gooooo
way to go boswell
fuck
thats not good
i guess all it took was a slight knee injury
missed pat seriouslycome on
keep passing give ben the ball and this is the result
damn boswell we needed that
hey look we did a thing
par for the fucking course
oh oh
that hopefully just the beginning lets go
when it rains it pours
would be tight if we started out dominating like we totally could be so that ben could just chill in the second half but nooooo also wtf bozchoke
the cowboys qb looks like someone who would play a qb in a lifetime movie but has never thrown a real pass
washington is slick as fuck on double moves especially with bens pump
the outcome of this game wont be decided by the players it will be decided by the courts
tough sob there
where is the advil and tums
were this is the worst possible out come for this game fuck
i think that mightve been a bad hold
ben has one leg
wait did all the fair weather fans stop crying now
well at least boz wont miss for awhile now
did they finally call a holding
i feel like hes gonna come out with a knee brace and deal with it play the rest of the season with the brace and then have surgery after the super bowl
the hell was that romo cbs lmao
yeasss
bens like shit already
ben no pain no gain roethlisberger
fumbled right into his hands
holy shit minkah
attway mikah
lets gooo lets tie this game going into half
lets fucking go
the ball is just attracted to fitzpatricks hands
minkah you beauty
quick someone go get ben
someone go get ben
this year i can die with a backup you really want to play an 8 man box with a threat like claypool deep
uh is ben still in the locker room
fuck wheres ben i dont want mason
kill me
cam sutton
wheres that guy who said fitzpatrick was overrated
rudolph time
maon should not be on the field this year
aww shieett here we goooo
fuck bens in the locker room
mason time
mason rudolph oh no
come on we are down to a 26 team
that was so sick
loooooolllll
oh god mason dont turn the ball over please
geez i thought fitz was gonna run the wrong way for a sec
ball
wow
god i dont want mason in
quackers now
what is this game
he floated that

i swear of he throws a pick 6
so we could have tied this and now we have to try not to turn it over
wait does this mean that rudolph is coming out
oh yea now this is steelers football
fitzpatrick has regressed this year
oh rudolph
mason the goat rudolph will score a td for us
rudolph with your nose so bright give us the fucking dub tonight
rudolph has to watch those floating passes easy to pick off for 6 the other way
show us what you got mason
i like how that never touched the ground cant even complain the catch and no football move lol
minkah

my dude
hello
oh no rudolph
hahahaha fucking mason
hopefully mason has had enough time to pull himself together after the results yesterday
thats exciting just went right into his hands
the battle of the back ups
my my my how the turn tables michael scott
no way rudolph expected to get into the game
what if this is the beginning of the mason rudolph era
ima have to blame the sun for this half
fuck these refs smh
why do people think mason for one drive would be bad hes always good his first few drives lol
so many steeler fans in the stadium they r cheering for that
just run it
mason out there without his chin strap all the way done

these pop balls are gonna fucking make my heart explode today
jujus spidey gloves
where can i bet on josh dobbs losing a wildcard game for us this year just like go down to rivers or what
4 yard pass and time out dont fuck this up
why did dallas spend a to there
replay the down christ
juju channeling his inner franco
lol
also wtf was rudy throwing to holy hell it looked like a dunk attempt
i forgot how bad rudolph was
come on boz
i would attempt a field goal boz can hit 54 yards
no arm
ok that replay of the hit on ben looked bad
he freaking sucks still
lmao
and of course mccarthy still believes in icing the kicker
geez bad football
so fucking early good lord
sigh
fucking sun
holy shit what a leg
boz
holy fuck
wow redemption
boswell youre amazing
yo what the fuck
fuckin right bos
reverse jinx success
he made it wtf
why are you calling a time out
lets go baby
well thats one way to make a record
he did it
boswell that ends well
you beautiful bos
what a fucking legend the wizard of boz
my hopes that this game would be done before my shift starts in two hours are dwindling fast
bosgod is an awesome god
thank you bosgod
that was interesting
boz fucking nailed that one
lol he makes it
god damn bos
love a franchise record
keep rudolph away from boswell dont want him to rub off on him
fuck yeah boz fuck yeah false start
what is this game i just i just cant
were gonna have to come up with some one read quick passes for mason this half
dont think that ben should come back if injured were 70 and its be pretty difficult for us to not make the playoffs need to play the long game here we also need a better backup plan than mason
now that we got some points on the board we better not play like the usual 2nd half steelers
if last week for the steelers is a yardstick its already over for the cowboys
2nd half steelers here we go
so what 4 or 5 field goals in second half from bozgawd
well this game has unfortunately pretty much gone the way i thought it would except for ben getting hurt just had a bad feeling about it too bad i didnt bet that waysigh
defense still looking bad
damn that oline isnt letting tj get through
run from it


dread it


2020 arrives all the same
minkah is magic
man gilbert out here throwing darts
wtf we wouldnt call that play and why it works
is dallas 4th strong qb better than andy dalton i think so
lb on cooper again
lmao dupree on cooper next level matchup
theyre doing whatever they want
jfc
this is so embarrassing omg
theyre still giving them too much space on the ground man
they never call holding for us
how they did both miss
lol whos 73

edit ahhh never mind its carlos davis
we need alualu back
tj bad play
defense looking pedestrian
im so confused with the defense right now such a weird look at times
theyre entire game plan revolve around quick passes to spread out the defense and avoid the huge pressure were getting just gameplan for that guys
the wrs need to start getting massive yac with a gimpy ben
well thats not gonna do it
just end my suffering and beat us already
turnover is gonna get us back
someone please say sike
should be a steelers jersey for williams now
i know he was open i know if ben isnt rushed he probably nhits him but why are we doing risky shit when weve looked like ass
its a td game and second half this year been our thing most of the season we got this
lets make some magic happen defense
pick 6 here would be lovely
what the actual fuck
look at that box count is that a joke

four o lineman and two defenders lined up on them no wonder we cant stop the run
mental check out so far
is it the play call or can they just not stop pollard
what happened to our run defense
cant get a 3rd down stop
is cam getting doubled need a fucking play
did the only prepare for elliot and nothing else
3 lineman and 2 defensive lineman on the 1st down run

bad math again
this is seriously unacceptable
what kind of crap d was that
just like last week large chunk plays on third down difference is the offense was ok last week
if youre gonna just hand them yards may as well just lay down and give them the td and skip the middle man
holy holding batman
pollard looking like prime adrian peterson
this is stupid just stupid
our defense looks weak as shit
random is probably the best ever description i have ever heard for farves qb style
so our run d is pretty bad without tyson it seems
lol nelson
more zone god i hate butler
steve nelson is fucking garbage
the pittsburgh let em break every tackle steelers
i wish any of our backs had the holes these guys are getting
steve nelson scared to tackle zeke lol go for the legs bro
itchin for a int right about now
vince williams dropping back in coverage is my favorite thing
this is just exhausting
yo these games are getting painful we have gotten dominated 2 weeks in a row
everyone who put money on the cowboys looking like absolute genius tonight
cant force a single third and long
fucking coaches and leaders not getting this team ready to play
dude theyre just marching down the field
oh look another lb on a receiver
im in so much pain
damn steelers make me feel like a fool every week
just remember we got 2 more bad teams up next and ones record is extremely deceptive
this guy is really picking us apart
its been all game where linebackers have been on wrs come on guys change something
heartstoppinguuugh
gilbert looks like a hero
we are getting embarrassed
are we doing some avant garde shit with our linebackers like i feel like bud and tj are getting used weirdly today
well this sucks
they should probably start playing man d and get out of the zone
they are wiiiide open everywhere on the field its so easy for them to score on us even for a guy who threw like 6 nfl passes in the last 4 years
lol smh
wtf
come on
no fucking way
this is fucking hilarious
pathetic
push them back for fucks sake why do we let them fall foward
i hate to be pessimistic and theres a lot of game left but we are simply put not playing well what can i say
the tank is almost empty after two tough road games
ive never seen such bad tackling lmao
im used to them giving up 3rd and long to passes

but runs

thats new
let ben call the plays
why not why the fuck not
yikes
might as well just take the defense out on 3rd down
averaging 25 points a game so lets do that now pls
i still have hope
have to get a td on this possession
its not funny tony
99 has to walk home right
can you guys stop with the even we win this its pathetic it isnt a win is a win and keeps our lead in the north not all our wins have been beautiful you take wins how you get em period
i dont understand how the announcers are always surprised like this doesnt happen every single year lmao
love how juju fight for yards
alright alright right juju with someblocking me likey
oh yes juju
good play by juju nice block by chase

better no ot for us lets win this
steelering requires to do something very poorly after someone else does something very good it is what creates the balance
3 and out 3 and fucking out x4 we win 31 24 done
dotson didnt move at all the entire play get that undisciplined shit out of here
minutes since baker mayfield commercial 5 0
lets go guys positive vibes def needs to do their thing here we go

unfuckingbeliveable

st has cost us this game today jesus
are you kidding me
special teams has been garbage today
this team is dumb
stop trying to look cute holy shit
this is fun
pathetic
what the fuck is up with this
holy shit all 3 phases
how come in all kicks there has been a dude in boswells face
no fucking shot
its the same play how is that not covered
so fucking stupid
steelers with another great special teams play
this game is cursed af
defense just had to stop here but lets set them up in fg range
we are fucked piss off
dammit layne left his lane
pathetic
you have to absolutely shitting me
special teams really is special
idk why were trying all this bullshit
fuck this shit
fire danny smith tomorrow get fucked
lol jesus christ
our kick return d is usually good no
if we couldnt not keep letting up big plays thatd be great
we are being outplayed in all 3 phases lol
special teams are looking short bus special what in the world
we dont deserve to win this
jesus fucking christ
welp gg bois
holy shit
how did he get 5 yards out of that it looked like he got lit up 2 yards in
tomlin you fucking asshole
stop letting them run ffs
zeke running through our defense ive seen this before not even gunna get my hopes up
special teams fucking us feels oddly nostalgic
why act like a real team why why

defense and special teams were disgraceful today and no adjustments in sight
what the fuck richard
i get the offense sucking but whats going on with the defense today
as guess the guys needed their clock cleaned today maybe theyll show up ready to play football next week
lets go d lets hold em to 3
im straight up not having a good time
good thing the defense blocked that wouldve been a td he was open lol
it was nice having defense for 7 weeks
worst coordinators in the entire league across the board every side of the ball
defense couldnt stop a peewee team rn
make a fucking stop here please bail out this st unit

fuck
i play renegade and the steelers get a stop
figures there would be a flag
well that was needed
lets gooooooooo
all good after the pick
how bout a 95 yard drive
best thing to happen on that flag tho
nance is glitching today second time he said dallas when he meant pittsburgh
minkah washed lmao
its juju time
lets fucking go
thank you minkah
well that just means we gotta go 99 yards and waste most of the clock doing it lets go
i feel like our qbs are fighting over who can make more dumb throws

i kinda like it
momentum shift lets do this
a stop is a stop this was a very important drive for dallas
tj is the only player ive ever seen kneel in the endzone
shotgun when inside the five
cam made that play
come on diontae you have been jv for 3 games now
man i had high hopes diontae but hes been disappointing me
mccarthy needs dat absolute unit mask
wear them thin
id like to see some running but it wasnt working earlier so i really cant complain
tony romo knows football
need at least a fg
diontae is so good at evading tackles
nantz has been making mistakes all night
that le has been so close to offsides this whole drive
its been one of those games
les go
hahahaha fuck you dallas
based refs i love refball
oh thank fuck lol
jaylon just saved our ass
fuck me sideways with a belt sander jesus christ
well that worked out for the best
phew
phew
conner looks rested
cmon theyre tryna give us this game
thank fucking christ
you chuckleheads in here acting like rudolph can be as good as ben are delusional if you think he could put together a drive like this

only thing he has in common with ben is the ability to fumble
lmao cowboy fans pissed
cowboys imploding
lol the music starting and getting shut off
lol are the cowboys imitating the bungles
the come back kid
ill take that
oh my god enough penalties i want this game over before i have to leave for work

i gotta start getting ready in like 20ish minutes come on
does romo have his contacts on inside out how could he not see the punch
jesus christ this whole dallas team can rot but thanks for the penalties
good to see the cowboys self destruct
we might win today but going 5wide on every single play is not sustainable wtf is up with our running game we need to get it on track pick a guy and stick with him
love it
lve with a punk ass move
got away with another one
got me yelling obscenities at my tv
the fuck they trying to claim holding onto his facemask you cant grab with your forearm and wrist
ticky tack penalty but ill take it
lets go offense
ridiculous
ill take the fg here
cmon bosgod
x200b

mr automatic chris bowswll
boz god
fg it is then
boswell playing so well
ghaut
bro who is this crawford dude sheeesh
atta boz
lets go d
im a novice when it comes to special teams but there has to be a way to account for a guy thats constantly jumping over the los
i want this ball so far out i cant see it
dial it up
has avery williamson been playing today
good fucking knock
renegade
bosgod not even gonna give them a chance to try some bullshit on a return
they say that the team who wins the turnover battle wins the game but boyohboy last two games and 6 takeaways still doesnt leave much breathing room
thank god boswell boot that kick our special teams wouldve blown it
another pd for watt
i know refs have helped a few times this season but i defo feel that usually thats not the case for the steelers so im really not complaining
our d line is literally made of saltines
one 3rd down stop is all i ask for
sure doesnt feel like weve only given up 19
course they get it
holy shit he actually made a play
mondo cool
4 minute fucking drill
bring us home big ben
they man to man and good things happened

waited long enough
that was a mondo tackle

i dont want this to come down to a fg attempt they e been way too close to blocking every kick
romo with the cave man insult to henry oof
where are they finding all these punters with these foreign names one team has a scottish guy another has an australian guy i think is it because of a soccer thing maybe something to keep in mind when we replace berry
i just wanna say joe is a beast he called that run play out and pointed henry in the right direction
here we go steelers
offense take my energy
were losing and throwing 1 yard passes lmfao
turnstiles up front cmon big guys
claypool man

defense please take my power
we just need the d to come up big like last week
2 missed xp still loom large should be up 8
our defense wont let em score a touchdown
cowboys coach is gonna have a heart attack after that call
you know what this reminds me of 2014 when we took the lead and glennon beat us with a last 30 seconds touchdown please hold them off d
that felt like a dirty drive but that jumping td was awesome
our d got this

cam heyward you big beautiful beast
easy never had a doubt we wouldnt win

80 lets fucking go
big dogs eating
i am iron head
boom
fucking rights
monstrous cam
thats the big play we needed boys
lets fucking

goooooooooooooo
love that big d
dallas hc has no neck bruh
did we win
best start to a steelers season in history 80 mothafuckahhhhhhhsss
holy fucking shit
watt said its time for you to go night night
run three times kick the field goal since we cant seem to make an extra point and yeah this was ugly as fuck
thats funny

heywood set em up and watt finishes him off

80
so many close games our problem seems to be our defense is weak regardless of who the other quarterback is
like last week we played like utter dogshit but still got the dub very enticing for the future
this is the way
can they just please stop playing these kind of games just once i mean are they trying to kill there fan base
not a win yet remember cowboys v falcons
just do a td easiest solution haha
our d showed up
qb sneak
so im going to assume everyone was having a pucker of a time this game
wtf tho just take the 3
well fuck more stress
hmm
isnt crazy how once we started pressuring the qb he started making mistakes
lol running to the outside with conner
wtf was the logic there

banking on another blocked fg
what the fuck are these cunts doing
wtf was that
why not kick a field goal
why is ben scared of qb sneaks
whyyyyyyy
is there any reason we didnt kick the fg there
st has been so lack luster im not mad
wow kick the fucking field goal you idiots
lets go defense
come on defense
im in a nightmare and i cant wake up
omfg
man yall could very easily eat your words
not like this brooooo
decastro looked like a flailing fat boy out there
i dont know if i can physically clench my asshole every weekend boys lets fucking go
if youre that worried about the special teams fire the fucking coach
what da fuck goin on
defense please
there is no fucking way
why
what the fuck was vance doing he walked right past a cowboy and blocked dd
hes out of bounds
just kick the fucking field goal you stupid motherfuckers
lets go defense
such a fucking shit take by romo why the fuck would we do that
dawg
please d please
jesus h christ
dude absolutely fucking disgusting fuck randy
does derek watt not have a role on this god damn team
did we learn nothing from the vikings
im so confused
wtf
omg are we gonna lose this
playing the prevent
lets go defense
this is killing me
i wouldnt have gone for that but i probably wouldve snuck it if i did we havent been able to run all day
someone needs to grill tomlin on why a fg was not attempted he better not give some lame answer like we want our offense to win it there
were gonna lose this
omg omg omg omg come on
this is the way the world ends this is the way the world ends not with a bang but with a dumb ass call to not take the 3 points
wouldnt be a steelers game if it didnt end with a heart attack
after i just made a joke shit tf
how many times have we been stopped on 3rd4th and 1 this game kinda sad
how is there not a view of that straight down the line
if we lose because of that
is this game 2019
lets go defense
its thirrddddd downnnnn
deep breaths fellas woosah lol
god terrell i love you your a hokie but do not run full speed like that at a receiver with how theyve called this game
2 more
007


no mista bond i expect you to lose
you know i wouldnt be on the verge of a heart attack week in and week out of tomlin wouldnt make stupid decisions like not going for the field goal
rear naked choke on tj seriously
lmao they gave them a chance unbelievable
fuck it im playing renegade again for the whole remainder of the this drive this is too intense
i think the though process on the fg was to avoid them blocking it for a touchdown return or something still a debatable decision
cmon defense

coming down to last play like last week with our defense on the field
prevent d
alright now it comes down to 1 play
1 more stop
fuck please
you gotta be shitting me right now
ahhh there we go
lets goooooo
whew my heart is still beating so fast
aaaaand thats a wrap
he fucking body slammed watt stupid cowboys
over
ill take it good night
i hated that
jesus man not a pretty win
thank god
lets go
lets go
that was much closer than it needed to be holy shit
lets fucking goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
pack it in boys this one is a win
minkah again
321omg win
i just wanna say for fairness that the hold on tj was flagrant but the refs have given a lot of help this game steelers shouldnt have put themselves in this situation anyway

edit nvm lets go lers fuck the cowboys
holy shit they were playing deep
wow 2 weeks in a row
never in doubt boys
jfc my heart
cant there just be a normal game for once
winsburgh
nearly had a heart attack tho
ben has like a dozen o faces
we find a way
80 baby we did it
never doubted for a second
messy win omfg
damn 80 steelers are fire this season
i can sleep now
the steelering has began
stop fucking crying steelers fans
washington johnson and its not close
favored by 145 losing 130 classic tomlining
to all the annoying fans that are saying fuck thai team you are no longer allowed to root for the steelers if and when we start winning this game and any other game kindly fuck off and root for another team
if we dont put points on the board before halftime this game is over
im going to go grill burgers this isnt worth watching
knew this would happen
im gonna burst a fucking blood vessell
so 70 down 2 scores to 26 fourth string qb dont ever tel me we dont play down to opponents again this is the definition of playing down hell its playing worse
these guys need to just look in the mirror at halftime for 12 minutes just look at the mirror and figure out who the fuck you are because what im seeing on the field today is horrifying
ben shouldve hurt his knee earlier
so were back to boswell hooking shit left again
boswell having a shit game lets see if he can redeem himself with a 60 yarder
if ben is out im turning it off
steelers fo need to be questioned why they didnt bring in a qb
was that a tiny jersey grab yes was it egregious enough to warrant dpi on an overthrow ball absolutely not

furthermore that was not a tackle leading with the helmet on ben anyone who is not an idiot can see that the helmet made contact with him as he was lifting his head up incidental contact

quit whining and start playing
this game is annoying
our line is embarrassing without tyson
come on claypool
second time hes done that team is just dead in the water and not reacting to anything
ugh take the touchback my dude

too much traffic
christ cant even get a fair interception without a damn penalty

nantz you idiot its the steelers with the takeaway

youre insane if you think were driving 98 yards and scoring a td lol
yo what the fuck was that vander esch you dirty fuck
romo is a cowboys apologist man
fucking romo waffling thats a fucking punch
i guess bos doesnt like xtra pts lol
only positive was fitzpatrick everyone else was a negative
lmao when the coaches have more trust in boz hitting a 60 yarder than mason throwing a td
all i can do is just smirk at how shit we are today it is laughably bad
all setup with chinese food dogs and myself are in our jerseys got a really good sativa testing at 245 ground up and a victory preroll on standby for when i get home from work in the morning

lets fucking do this
why we wearing black on top
like we didnt know this bullshit was going to happen
lmao its the first drives for both teams and the steelers rarely have looked good in the beginning of games lets settle down now
optimal steelersing going on right now
whats the point of having a great wr core when you dont use them so tired of how boring we always start out
2 runs and then a dump off pass with 16 yards to go

talk about confidence there
3rd and 15 huh steelering
i so wish there was a hotline we could call so we can voice our opinions to someone inside the steelers organization
hows it feel that our steelers thread looks exactly like the ravens thread earlier have some class
tomlin special shaping up
if your heart is aflutter now how will many of you handle q4 have a beer or two or three as it is often the best antidote
i say punt our offense cant do shit lol
we look like absolute trash
lol ben is already calling the plays randy is so fucking trash
looks like ben has taken over calls
enough mcfarland already we have better rushing options on short yardage
tipical steelers playing down to their competition
cut 99 at halftime please
lmao were fitting outplayed by a fourth string so far 30 yard bomb on drive 1 30 yards running here

meanwhile our offense looks like the browns
tj watt covering lamb
ooof please let ben take shots now
absolutely fuck keith butler
im actually more worried about this game than the ravens game
fichtner calling dumbass plays where we cant convert on 3rd and 1 4th and 1 and butler is having tj cover wide receivers

i dont think our coaches gave a fuck about this game this week
god forbid we let the best pass rusher in the league put pressure on a fucking 4th string qb lol
were getting cooked by a team that lost to washington by 3 scores lol
steelers look exactly like a team playing their 3rd straight road game during the second half
of the season
the only undefeated team in the nfl with an inarguably no 1 defense is losing to a third string qb if we lose this game remember that
what a fucking break that was
steeler football is infuriating sometimes
i fucking hate steelering i dont even know who to blame this whole team is to blame
imagine if we were facing dak it would be 500
we deserve to lose this game imagine being outcoached by one of the worst coaching staff this season
everyone here why is romo sucking the cowboys dick

also steelers
somebody give the sideline a call and give them a heads up we are playing today
ah yes the annual ben shit the bed game against a garbage team
im shocked the spread for this game was 14 points lol this is typical steelers
look i get we played two straight physical road games against tennessee and the ravens but this game is pretty much the football gods balancing that by handing us a w and we refuse to take it
its fine guys now im watching the game i was out and about before but now im watching
its painful watching them wait until theyre behind against a terrible team for them to start clicking on offense
ben cannot throw a deep ball for shit
no deep accuracy dear god
fuck romo man
just tape it up
dobbs should always have a hat because if he isnt better than maon i will print out the pdfs of the gameday programs for the entire 1996 season and eat them with hunts ketchup piled on top of a heap of skyline chili and crabcakes
how is mason rudolph on an nfl roster
50 seconds and 3 plays to get like 5 yards

and they cant do it lol
oh your mother offsets
give me josh dobbs over mason rudolph any day of the week
i am fucking sick
just put dobbs in and throw it in the inzone you have better odds of making it
pittsburgh kickers arent built for kicking that far heinz field is notoriously difficult to kick long field goals at
why the fuck did we not bring in jameis winston
i take it all back boz
i havent checked the rnfl game thread i assume theyre shitting all over us lmao
tj limping god stop doing us like this
our o line sucks this year
really 3 and out
this game is tied if claypool doesnt drop a sure td in the first half yall need to chill

nice of cbs to do an av tribute on a day where hes having an abysmal game
losing in the trenches on both sides of the ball smh
they are going to fucking fg us to death at this rate make a fucking play defense
third string rb 5th string qb
fuck the titans and the nfl for fucking us into an early bye week
the defense looks so inept this has been a current trend this year

wonder what the issue is
remember this is a fourth string qb
can we just play cleveland every week that game was fun
shit defense
we are very fortunate to not be facing cooper rush tonight mike mccarthy is merciful
pathetic
the only reason we are in this game is because of bad play calling by the cowboys
kick the fg you know the steelers wont score
no bye harsh schedule three weeks in a row third week on a road game no injuries pls
60 minutes so how does the military intend to distribute a covid19 vaccine to over 300 million americans

military chemtrails

60 minutes wait what seriously

military absolutely weve been doing this sort of stuff for decades now

60 minutes why are you telling us

military we perfected a memory wipe drug thatll be part of the covid19 vaccine standard stuff be glad you dont remember the summer of super diarrhea

60 minutes
thats another pass right through claypools hands
ju fucking ju
are you fucking serious
another missed pat really been that kind of day man
special teams has killed us today
our special teams is a joke
this really is the tomlin special
only we could shoot ourselves in the foot
the steelers are losing this game because of special teams
worst special teams in the league
most likely underprepared for a much weaker opponent and just not our game today thats all nothing truly to freak out about
i remember in the cowher days he would start every training camp with a day devoted to nothing but special teams seeing the way dallas is winning this game through special teams play i wish more modern coaches would put that kinda emphasis on special teams play
i really believe we are frauds
im not usually one to want to fire coaches but whoever decided to not kick it into the end zone can pack their things and go
the mistakes this team is making right now are just hilarious lol
did anyone think we were actually gonna win today
oh ye of little faith i knew we still had a chance it isnt over yet
minkah is fucking disgusting
why in gods name would you run that out actually a really costly play
why not just fall down in the end zone
this will end with a punt
anyone else think he should have kneeled it
love minkah but i would have loved him to get a touchback
who are the cowboys playing today thought it was the steelers
that shithead threw a punch ejection
vander bitch
what the fuck is his problem
did he throw a fucking punch
vander esch threw a punch

fuck that get that cocksucker out of there he threw a punch
this fucking oline man
lol we really bout to lose because of the missed fg
were playing like we only want a fg which is weird considering weve missed a bunch lol
leaping is illegal
boyfriend walks in this is close huh

me just as i expected

another game where were up by a few scores and breeze to a win would be fun instead of raising my anxiety week in and out huh
this is bullshit nfc east is a power house this year
stinky poopoo
risky not calling fair catch
i have a feeling boswell gonna have to come in clutch here hope im wrong
we got a bs call


ill take it
lets goooo respect bens space
we really celebrating the refs helping us against a 26 team
a gift a fucking gift
thats the first one for ben in 5 years i think lol
weak but legitimate call
tbf the calls have been reasonable in some cases they just feel like dog shit bc weve played so bad and everyone hates the undefeated team i dont agree w all the calls but overall refs just suck in general so
omg theyre only going to win this game bc they have more points at the end
claypool dude
that was a weird conversion attempt it was obvious that he was throwing to claypool come on ben youre better than that
claypool isnt playing bad but he hasnt made any plays on some catchable balls
holy fuck defense
are the cowboy wrs covered in grease
my apple watch just told me to take a minute to breathe haha
this one is for all the infants in the game thread
a father teaching his son a lesson
80 boys
eat it dallas
classic cocky steelers come on man
i dont hate going for it but why run the ball outside
stop the count now
we did not deserve to win
incoming pick 6 from ben
that was some cute playcalling exactly the kind of thing thats caused us to steeler games against scrub teams
oh man elliot is already averaging 2 ypc we lost game over lets just forfeit now

s

these game threads are pathetic
i fucking hate rudolph so much
so now the steelers finally showed up to play the game right after i pitched a bitch on this thread like 10 minutes ago roughly i have been mostly a lurker on reddit for over 3 years i have only posted less than 50 times total ever hell maybe less than 30

i dont count or even pay attention to updownvotes karma etcetera i couldnt give a fuck less i wont even engage in an argument on here i dont have the time or headspace

but believing in superstition maybe i should post on the steelers game day thread more often hmm
how bad is it that im ready to turn on this team they deserve to be scrutinized this is dogshit from them
fuck the cowboys and fuck all you fake steelers fans who give up on the team before the games over every week
these announcers are annoying af
no lie the yall are overeacting people are as annoying as overrators lol
if ben is hurt we can pack it in for the year i want no more of the mason rudolph experience he tried his best to shit away that possession
its happening
i hate it here lol
our defense is going to give up a td this drive lol
sure do love the 12 wasted timeouts per game we always have
were losing to dallas guys seasons over
best case scenario we win by a field goal
worst case scenario we lose a trap game and get the undefeated monkey off our back while also continuing to be the underdog in all games moving forward
bench snell already hes not a power back he was a fluke back hes 3rd string now
this might be the single most pathetic performance ive ever seen in my life it is inexcusable for a socalled elite defense to get worked by a team that hasnt even scored a touchdown since october and the playcalling on offense wouldnt even be innovative in 1945 absolutely abysmal and everyone associated with the team should be ashamed cant believe i wasted an hour watching this crap off to do something more important like slam my fingers in a door
im not saying just tomlin but coaching is a problem
like derek watt was the biggest waste of cash imagineable dude hasnt played more than 1 game i think
my bad everyone i took the steelers in my survivor pool
and their defender leading with his head for the extra shot on ben just awesome
all we needed was ben to break his knee and we are all good
ah 2018 boz is back
shew i gotta admit it cowboys fans are entitled to their anger right now thats a shitty way for a half to end
idk what everyone is talking about this dallas d is as good as ours
1 sack im insanely fucking disappointed man
if we dont have the easiest schedule in the league were 43
giving up a 9 yard run thats fucking pathetic
watch for a fake dallas has nothing to lose
claypool with another drop
ab in tampa bay seething rn looking at juju
did we figure out how to keep juju with the cap as it is or nah
we always rally in the end baby
missed 2 extra points but made a 59 yard field goal lol

is it too early to panic now am i overreacting
reminder dallas has only punted once all game

this defense is only elite when they earn or luck into a couple of turnovers
its like every good play is met by a bonehead play i love minkahs aggressiveness but the play there is to get the fuck down and get the touchback
johnson tries to do too much after the catch and ends up doing too little
i really hope boswell doesnt lose us the game in the same game he made a franchise record
this game feels so gross
you have been awful today defense it wont matter if yall make a stop right here
headline tomorrow pittsburgh has until 5 pm est to clear 125m in cap room after signing zebras

suck a dick jim nantz
im surprised that people are surprised that wed play down to one of the worst teams in the league it always happens lol

why i was so confused about media members calling this a blowout coming in that never happens
afc championship game chiefs 100 steelers 0
lets win this for biden and harris
im down to fire fichtner win or lose after this game

if you think about it if we dont score this first half including the first half last week thatll be an entire game that fichtner calls the plays and the team has scored 0 points all the points last week came in the second half when ben started calling plays

seriouslyfucking fire fichtner
lol coaches didnt prepare us on all three phases
this thread is worse than the game somehow lol
so fucking done steelers look like the 26 team here so fucking done

whole team is fucking lazy and tomlin is literally just standing there doing nothing i havent seen him speak a single word all game meanwhile mccarthy is over there actually coaching
that was openhanded dudes

i hate the cowboys too but that was clearly openhanded
id say stop the count but im pretty sure very team has made that joke at least 40 times
lets play down to the cowboys woo
im so worried that this is a trap game for us smh
waaaaahhhh waaaaahhhh my favorite football team isnt doing everything perfectly theyll never win another game again
calm down its the second quarter you guys act like our season is over like fucking chill
tomlin doing it again overlooking opponents and not planning enough for the one were playing
nothing has changed kaepernick
guess roughing the passer penalties arent a thing anymore
and now you people see why tomlin was under scrutiny in years past stupid decisions like that keep him from being a mastermind of a coach what a stupid ass decision to let them back in the game by not trying an easy field goal
bidens america made bens knee weak
romo is such a little bitch its insane
play down to your opponent the mike tomlin way
oh and thanks to the yinzers who voted cheeto man out in pa
wow dropsies
another deep sideline incompletioncan we cut that shit out maybe some rub routes or something
im worried
seems about right
the renaissance of garrett gilbert
just watch this 4th stringer pass all over us because our defense doesnt know their coverage assignments or zeke mad dogging us
defense is garbage since the 2nd half against tennessee
its only one play
holding on vince williams
beginning to smell a lot like trap game
what is this horrible play calling people told me its time to forgive fichtner
what the fuck are these play calls is fichtner and the team trying to lose what the fuck
i love it run run pass punt everytime until we get an almost unrecoverable deficit
fire fichtner now kill him vote him off do whatever but fucking christ just get someone who doesnt run on 2nd and long
romo is salivating right now
this is vintage perfectly aged delicious rare exquisite steelering
why do we always play down to our competition why
maybe stop running it so much
any one else feel like we are watching a dallas commentary on cbs fing romo
holy crap phones are so expensive i thought the flip phone looked cool but its like 1200thats almost as much as i paid for my first car lol
i swear to god randy fichtner gotta fucking go
i would have personally did an end around with claypool on that one or at least put him in motion to unstack the box in the middle
kick the fucking fg
we are being outplayed on both sides of the ball
okay now im getting mad
the standard is the standard
i know theres been posts disproving the steelers lose to bad teams thing but like
just tuned in and wanna ask
what the hell is going on with this team
i am going to go throw up
stop the count
this team is a fucking embarrassment to watch
we are getting blown the fuck up by the cowboys right now
worst secondary in the nfl still proving it
welp seasons over s
its the second quarter i swear to fuckin jesus if i hear someone try to cal for tomlins head imma lose my shit
leave it to us to be embarrassed by a fucking 26 team what a fucking poor effort by this team so far fuck our offense
ive been saying all week to myself that this is the trap game well here we are
if we are going to loose then let them hang 60 on us
this must be our bye week
i was having a great day until now fuck off
why do we lose to lower teams
the whole lol everyone need to relax haha right fire tomlin s is so old as this point getting upset about predicable collapses against horrible teams is not an overreaction its completely legitimate
im embarrassed by this steelers performance right now
this shit is a joke lmao
so is it gonna be 170 at halftime or is our defense gonna man up and only give up 3 to this elite garrett gilbert led offense
lmfaooooo
lmaoooooooooo
ben is playing like hot trash right now right after i said this last week he threw a td against baltimore so bare with me
i wish i at least lived in pittsburgh but no i live in texas and im going to get shit on tomorrow classic man
im gone me when we wake the fuck up
hay subreddit en espaol porque decir fuck y no vayansle a la verga no se siente igual
its allll goood chill people our d will pull it together and save us
literally dont let fichtner call another fucking play this game we were favored by double digits and now were down by double digits as bad as the defense has been theyve held them to 2 field goals when they couldve had more this shit is on fichtner and his patented 3 and outs

trap game anyone fuck we need to right this ship before halftime their guts are wide open
it as if we thought this game was a win before it was played our steelers have not shown up yet
stop the steal
this is on tomlin
based on this threads supporters we should just go ahead and put duck in there and see what happens
anyone that says we dont play down to competion is wrong im still confident well win but this is not the first time this shit has happend
the real steelers are waking up baby
grabbed his jersey and arm no call dirty hit on ben classy dallas
well this games done if ben is dead
if we put in fucking mason rudolph i swear to fucking god
now that ben is hurt we will be better this is the way
astros cheated
fuck
that throw was reassuring lol
and just like that its 7 points screw you dumbfucks calling the game in the 2nd q
of course boswell misses
ben looks like hes hurting but eh i guess its not effecting him too much

rudolph redemption arc
minkah where tf were you running
so ben has been saying that dobbs has been helping him see things on the field yet hes inactive and we are stuck with fucking mason
td to juju please
probably a hold and they are out of fg range
damn rudolph just looks lost out there
sorry guys ben went to the bathroom so im in gameplan is not letting anyone got me with my helmet rudolph probably

reset the clock
why the fuck dont we make dobbs the two he was always better than mason
maybe we shouldve invested in a fucking backup qb
i think we need duck part 2
is there anyone in free agency we can sign to play qb can we trade for fitzpatrick
boswell gonna be good from 63 yards
this team is playing jet ball what the fuck in a taint lickinnbasket is this
this is pathetic
just end the fucking half jesus
can someone fill me in im not watching is ben out
if ben is hurt that is just compounding what has already been the worst day of my life so far
it would be nice if he was actually consistent
what are we thinking that injury was mcl sprain
perhaps the worst half of the season injury notwithstanding run defense still suspect butler too ignorant to understand that pressure needs to come up the middle when everything is a quick pass giving snell and mcfarland burn instead of conner too many ridiculous decisions by this staff
face the reality that at some point this year we will have to rest ben a game even if he finishes today
we are not that good lol
butler is handicapping watt jesus christ get rid of him
lol i hate it here
jesus this is painful
can we just run slants and rub routes and curls and things why is there no intermediate passing
classic trap game
this is honestly embarrassing for our defense
we cant stop the run we cant tackle no wonder we are losing this game
yeah this is a loss
its almost the 4th
we cant stop the run of course you go for it
these guys looked gassed man
we have them right where we want them
time to fucking score
are we suck
its hurry up offense the rest of the game

need 7 a stop and 7 and its over they can do it will they
boo boo smith schuster callgod
backyard football time
well being undefeated was cool
wow he just missed
mapletron get some syrup on those gloves
lord why yall blaming chase for that second drop ben threw it a mile behind
1st and 15

they better not run it here
somehow we are still the live betting favorite
why is cam on the field
quit selling cereal and make touchdown
oh fuck a flag
this is just fucking comical at this point with the kicking team
i never got over my extra point anxiety from bos bad season and its through the roof tonight
special teams are special ed today
if you think about it we could be 16 with how some of our wins went lol
ah here comes the special teams regression weve been waiting for
02 on extra points with a 59 yard field goal surely this is the first time that has ever happened in history right
steelers are 05 vs these refs in the last 5 games
all 3 of our coordinators are having a shitty game ficthner has the offense looking like a dead corpse butler has the defense playing the worse matchups ever and danny smith got the special teams shitting the bed so hard its the biggest reason were losing right now

but somehow were still in it and will win this shit
special teams really trying to lose this game
for all the whining about randy were gonna lose this game on special teams lmao
we are frauds
the secondary is badim tired of people thinking its not
like i said this team fucking sucks cant even beat the cowboys
every time this team takes a step forward we take three back
fucking fire the special teams coach
its over
edmunds making dumb fucking plays nothing new

jim nantz doing his best lou holtz impression right now
eject him
are you fucking kidding me vander esch
he just threw a punch clear as day romo
man id be wasted if i took a shot everytime the steelers got a bailout call
throw his ass out that was a punch
fuck you vander bitch
wtf he punched him lol
vander esch playing dirty as fuck
dirty as fuck right there
lots of deliberation considering he just hit the guy in the face
used to like that kid fuck him
i swear its hard just to catch a break
renegade time yall
i am smelling a spilane stopturnover
have the steelers run the ball once this half
smells like a trap game
only good play he has today mondo still trash
lol yall ready
relax
guys i dont give up hope easily but i am scared that were gonna make a critical mistake
please dont let this come down to boz i like him but he has been shaky today
we are so garbage lmfao
lmao 3 and out
obvious call

hands to the face of the qb
ben got an rtp call its a miracle
gonna buy a ref jersey after this game
the fact we need the refs to hand us the win against the cowboys is pitiful
cool lets play baby shit soft zone thatll get it done
lol we have been unbelievably lucky and still barely winning they are on some shit ass qb and our defense suddenly sucks dick we look like the jets
all they needed to do was run run run and kick a fg make this gg dude drive down yjr field with no timeouts
great teams find a way to fucking win
breeze of a game never in doubt
dont try a fucking field goal
if they lose im done with this team that is absolutely ridiculous
tomlin is an idiot for not kicking that
at first i didnt think it was a catch until tomlin threw the challenge and now im thinking it definitely was
refs giving dallas a free timeout to rest and make a play with that review
yall up in here acting like that fg was a gimme
thank god but seriously fuck you tomlin
thank fucking god dude jesus christ we in no way deserved that shit
fuck my ass with a rake we did not deserve that but holy fuck my voice box is ruined
no trap no trap no trap no trap
panick


for real chill the fuck out its not even an important game if we do lose
so should i start playing renegade now or
30 its over going to watch a movie or something
is it just me or did that little skirmish this week between fichtner and ben result in ben having less control over play calling ben looks uninterested and like he isnt trying today because these arent his plays probably isnt true but i just feel like ben is petty like that
we stand zero chance against kc
it is so obvious when ben is calling the offense
seconds from turning off this is embarrassing
herr derr stop being negative this early herr derr its only been amount of series herr derr
im not sure what hurts more that its happening or that we fucking knew it would happen
were losing to that fat fuck mccarthy
if we lose im protesting
im gonna unfollow juju if we lose
that lazy snap missing a play before 2 mins encapsulates everything weve witnessed thus far
im so tired of watching us air the ball out lmfao bens deep ball is the worst in the league
take him out of the fucking game this game is not worth ben getting injures
there is the capn fat fuck pump fake and wtf boswell
were so fucked
get outta town boswell
thank you dallas for taking the penalty
on behalf of all of us we would like to sincerely apologize to chris for any remarks made about the missed extra point

we cant stretch the field and i think defenses are starting to catch on to it big bens deep ball lacks accuracy and power fuck it sucks so much to see age and injury bring one of his best attributes down like this
2 games we cant stop the rush our defense is being exposed
our defense sucks
you guys still think were a sb team
christ even when they start moving they just fuck it up come on already
this game needs to be a wake up call for tomlin regarding our offensive play calling this shit can not slide if you wanna make a deep playoff run
im actually happy we might lose this game lol maybe itll make people stop acting like were the best team in the league
right i mean ben is better then our second and third string but imagine if we had a lawrence taylor we would dominate for the nest five years only challenged by the cheifs in our division
we gonna lose arent we
not sure if anyone is a penguins fan here but this is kind of like when the pens play a no name goalie on a bad team they just get outplayed
selfish not taking the knee
romo is such a homer piece of shit today
we should be down 10 instead of 1 so this is as good as we could ask for with how this fire of a game has gone just need two more stops and one more score lets get it
mondeauxxx is so bad
lets run it 3 plays in a row theyre used to passing at this point
fuck everyone that says we scored too quick i have faith in our d god help me
are you fuckers gonna let them back in the game like really

note this is only as accurate as nflcom when the bot triggers
this game as all the makings of a classic tomlin choke job lets hope it doesnt happen
yall were real cocky this week i said this would be closer than predicted
damn man i really thought we wouldnt do any steelering this game i guess im the fool
this is why mike tomlin deserves criticism he has consistently lost to the worst teams in the league
i expect apologies from everyone that told me i was overreacting
was wondering when the real steelers would turn up
yeah we are losing this game might as well take a nap
serious question what qb are available around the league or trade options
too late to trade for fitz lol please be ok ben
and this defense wanted to be considered one of the best of all time
get sutton off the field that was an embarrassing effort on the tackle
if it isnt over 50 yards dont let boswell kick today lol
the commentators never cease to amaze me with this justification for bullshit behavior every week they just try to justify these obvious personal fouls hope the steelers score a td on this drive to stick it to them
defense is not 1
one of the worst 80 teams in nfl history

5th string qb if we lose we are pathetic
an aaf qb is shredding us
told myself i was gonna play through and beat super mario 64 sunshine and galaxy before playing through super mario odyssey finally had it in my backlog forever and every time i would get into it something else would come along that would distract me by the time i returned to it i forgot what i was doing moon locations moves get rusty and i just die a whole bunch losing all my coins

just restarted odyssey again and realized age of calamity drops in less than two weeks

hopefully i can finish odyssey in two weeks lol

hey romo if you would shut the fuck up that would be real great k thanks
the only positive in this game is that now i dont have to worry about winning a sb now i know were not making it
this defense is absolutely fucking pathetic from top to bottom the biggest steaming pile of dogshit cant stop anything
connor is so fucking trash and we keep trusting him to do 4th downs
i dont care that we won the decision not to kick that field goal will forever be a stain on tomlins career what a total shit show barely beat the 26 cowboys
concerned about our depth on d line and playing down to competition but trying to stay positiveshades of mike glennon are dancing in my head
damn buffalo ravens tennesse and kc will all most likely win today gahhhh would have loved to build a bigger afc lead
i thought this would be the first game i wouldnt be nervous i was wrong
anyone streaming it
crackstreams isnt working right now
damn that was a ballsy kick would have been dope as hell if he made it
x200b

tony romo is calling this game

x200b

hmmm
cowboys deferred we get the ball first
here we go
gilbert alright coach any advice before we get this thing started

mccarthy greet death like an old friend

gilbert
so weird to be in black
finally
seeing a toooooon of towels in the stands i love it
lot of us dallas steeler fans in the stadium today
party time boys
mcloud so shifty
why are we wearing home jerseys
my opponent in fantasy has johnson juju ebron and the steelers defense im conflicted to say the least
look at ben run
lmao ben good job
my man got wheels
i could listen to romo all day

wheels
lol with our luck we are going to be the only team that doesnt rush well against them
ben with the pace
bens arm is definitely stronger lol
s p e e d d e m o n
chase gotta catch that but the o line is getting a good push so im encouraged

at work right now if we score tell me plz
as long as they consistently dont call pi it actually helps us

less flags means less opportunities for them to get bailed out
just tuning in what happened on our first offensive drive
fucking hell come on guys
anyone have a radio link
williams wasnt held
hahahaha they are marching down the field fuck this
itsatrapgif
anyone got a link to a good stream
not the best start here
i wish they wouldve just started ben dinnuci
alualu was literally our key to stopping the run without him we get shat on
why fucking why
oof
leaaaague leeeead
blitzburgh
lets go ben
rudy rudy
damn that ben stat is mad
something tells me we didnt take this game seriously during practice this week
ill be damned
their defense is playing better than ours their offense is playing better than ours

this is bad
wtf is that drive
we are punting better every cloud
sigh
love me some steeler football lol
im kinda worried a 57 yd punt means we are going to get a 30ydr at some point this game lol
berry fuckin upgrades boys
awesome run blocking so far
no huddle please
michael jordan who who
wonderful play calling
um what the fuck
we are just feeling them out offense and defense will make adjustments its always this way in the beginning of the game remember its not how you start but how you finish
lets go defense
too soon to call the trajectory of this game steelers have been a second half team all season but dallas is getting the start dallas needs to keep this competitive
steelers been pretty good on 4th down this year
excellent d
lol cowards
wheres ray ray
got a stop thats all that matters
why is haden taking the punt
at least the defense is showing up now offense needs to get in the game
romo talkin trash
is that like when chad johnson wanted to kick a field goal
mcfarlandd himself there
there we go much better
here we go
can we get some points this drive
there we go
claypool wanted a whole lot more than just 14 yards
lve almost fell there lol
dont let those knees be exposed boys nfl might fine ya
mcfarland is looking good
here we go
theres there short passes i wanted
gotta go for it
not even close
fucking fantastic
when tony mcfarland runs it reminds me of happy feet when the little penguin dances funny
take the points
its different
go for it
go for it
why mcfarland
really


run up the middle



are you fucking kidding me
thats my team
what the fuck is this play calling three times the same play
yikes
ol playing weak as shit
what a play call
fucking weak
god dammit
pathetic from the offense
they know you are doing that so why tf do that
line up in the i and run it down their throat
just have ben sneak it next time
offensive line needs to get its shit together theyre 30th in pass block win rate and 19th in rush block win rate so far this year and as teams start squatting on the short stuff thats going to really hamper the offense
nice job ficht
youre blowing it
mother fucker
not surprise
hindsight is 2020 but we should have taken the points
also you should tie the game there
fuck
three fucking runs up the middle in a row of course
is someone on our coaching staff paid per shotgun snap
braindead saw that coming a mile off
lmaooooooo
wow
well hopefully that makes us abandon the inside run
damn it
yeah lets just run the same play we ran that didnt work at all sounds like a good plan
oh my fuck
wtf is going on this is embarrassing
those yards are about desire
facemask
my coworkers asked me why i was worried about this game all week if only they knew
is it the second half yet so our offense can show up
this is very embarazzing
lamar is that you
steve young
lets get a turnover
do we not know what a fucking spy is
so have people worked out we cannot deal with a running qb
i guess cowbays are allowed holding
why is mondeaux playing
i cant fucking stand mondeaux
cowboys got a good game plan
can we stop running the ball its clearly not working
yeah just let him run to the end zone if you want
honestly rooting for gilbert at this point its ridiculous
the big problem is the o line is getting blown up every play
tj watt
i should have known as a longhorn fani should have known always be a weary of a longhorn playing in texas
blah blah blah
fuck keith butler
wiiiiiiiiide open
wide open again how
no false start
lol fuck this team
why was watt covering lamb
wake up time
how is he that open
false start
what the hell is going on
okay offence can we get going now instead of the latter half of the 3rd quarter
heyward is conner williams father dragged him along for the qb pressure
lmfaooooo
jesus christ
yikes
watt covering lamb thats an interesting defensive scheme
nightmare start
like im not even mad i knew we were gonna get trap gamed
still not worried but butler is a fucking dumbass
this team better get it together with all the shit they were talking all week
alright this is how were doing it today sweet
so we use our smallest back on 4th and 1 and use our best pass rusher in coverage on third down am i missing something here
did the staff member with covid have the entire game plan with him in quarantine
was starting to think theyd do a browns and keep trying what doesnt work
both sides playing bad what the fuck is happening
this shit is not surprising at all unfortunately
run run

pass

seriously
not surprising but also calm tf down lol whole game left
its like were in a whole new playbook
hopefully we start taking this team seriously and play like its all in the line theres still time lets goooo
run incompletion draw punt
stat line is crazy rothlisberger 69 4 yd avg gilbert 69 94 yd avg
throw the ball
can we stop with the 2nd down runs jfc
oh my god stop with the fucking draws
gotta have some faith yall
wheres that guy in this sub that said steelering isnt a thing
run run pass
3 and out omg lol
wtfffff
unreal
what is going on
i think weve ran like 20 jet sweep plays over the last 3 weeks and only handed it off like maybe once or twice
have ben make the play calls fitchner is clueless
lmao
amazing
that was a good play by them
fucking trap game
oh my fucking word
yeah not a good throw thats on ben
this is a fucking embarrassment
jfc
why are we running so much its not working
fucking bullshit man
i seriously wanna cry
unfuckingbelievable
what the fuck
yeah this is pathetic
what the hell
okay punk these fucking pricks
our offense is painful to watch and sadly our defense so far today is too
embarrassing absolutely embarrassing
this looks like a dump show
bruhhhhhh diontae wouldve had the first down on that wtfgotta lead it ben
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
cool cool cool
ill tell you now this offense is going to cost is theyre very bad in 8 qtrs and getting worse it feels
i hate that i love this team
lol
fuck this
jesus christ
i think the game plan is not working maybe time to adjust
i hate everything
okay randy enough up the gut stuff
holy fuck
soeveryone got hammered last night
why was haden returning a punt anyone know
yeah tomlin special even if they pull it out
bro how
so flat to start this game bout to get reamed out by tomlin at halftime
of fucking course
what the hell just happened
we were getting wooped by the the cowboys
yikes
dive dive drag is every drive
if we give up a touchdown here im gonna cry
why are we like this
lets go d turnover time
this is hard to watch
vince is a beast
what in the world
i love tomlin most weeks but im so tired of this shit happening it cannot be overstated how predictable this happening is the steelers are known for doing this shit and it costs us big every single year we didnt make the playoffs last year losing to the jets we didnt make the playoffs the year before losing to the abysmal raiders and lost the one seed year the before that losing to an abysmal bears team if we lose today i guarantee it will have a huge effect on playoff seeding
ok now will the real steelers please stand up
awful hopefully 2h is a diff story
sigh i have the steelers in my survivor pool this week need a comeback come on boys lets rally
good thing nfl games are forever long ways to go in this one but no points here and im gonna need a fireball
please just a heartbeat
what in the actual fucking fuck man
no reason to play conservative anymore
good start to the drive need to score here
dj so slippery
not a big fan of todays game
oh fuck ben
oh no ben got hit hard
nooooooo
shit motherflinker
f you see kay
fucking hell
offensive line needs to get their heads out of their asses
when i was in iraq they had bad company come out to see us

thing was bad company was touring in europe at the time

the guys coming out to see us were people who had randomly played with bad company for various things over the years one of them was the same age as me

i still think about that
fanfuckingtastic
such is life in the national football league
holy shit ben come on
no no no no
head hit
fuck bens down
just when you think it cant get any worse
ben is a warrior
ben should be pissed
ebron
this game keeps getting worse
im scared
gimpy ben is peak ben
oh no
here comes banged up ben
big boy ben legoooo
big hit just needs like a min to recover
ben sit out a few plays cook up some heat then turn it on second half
ben what a warrior
yeah boy
washington
anyone know a place i can watch
wooooooo
attaboy
we need our defense to step up here big time
yessir
boo boo ben

james worshington
bens a goddamn warrior

noooooooo
washington james washington 7 foot 20 washington
i thought it was the right knee
bro did anyone get off the plane today
i wanna cry
could be rainy and breezy golf next weekend
we got lucky lol
vikings fan here how many games this year has ben r missed due to injury

eta thx i thought he had problems dont watch many steeler games fuck the cowboys
good job cowboys you just pissed of the steelers
this defense is playing way too much zone thats why theyre getting carved up and leaving open guys everywhere
oh well hello
ok lets hope its a bruise now defense lets pick it up
lololol
lets get 3 out of this

bens in the damn locker room though
so whos qb now
wait didnt ben go the locker room now what
was that sutton with the strip lets go
and now mason has to play
rudolph time baby
mason rudolph is in guys
oh dear god its mason rudolph
oh gawd
great d but ben is in the locker room
2019 part duex
ben
is this a nightmare
turnover
mason time bitches
hello mason
can do without the team photo op when theyre playing like this
if cowboys punt its rudolph time boys
dont kill us mason
come back ben pls
he has zero zip on his passes
sutton on some g shit that was so sick
you haters need to calm down a little
i put up my tree already rudolph take my energy
they probably didnt expect to get the ball back this quickly
field goal is fine herejust dont fuck it up rudolph
lmao how lucky can you be
rudolph will be 15 improved this year
hey this mason guy is pretty good s

lets pull santas sleigh
wtf
incase everyone was wondering rudolph is still a checkdown machine
ben is out thentime to switch to booze
coming back on a hold
fuckkkkk
wish we had jaboo
did he even warm up
i think i would prefer duck as the back up
yup rudolph still sucks
rudolph is a bitch
could we be any more obvious that we were going with a screen on that
of course mason wants to be a hero

run the ball
bos pls be god
wow
lol boswell
what the fuck bos
throw a hail mary
what happened to ben
im just happy we stopped the points dallas could a potentially had
in bos i trust
great kick
lmaooo
boswell why
letsgoo
longest 2 seconds ever
what
lol boz
bosgod
fuck yeah boz
there we go
this is farce
atta baby bozgod
hahahahahahahah oh my god
lol
id have bet my house he missed it good on boz

2020 keeping up the weird streak
holy fuck
holy fuck
boswell lets go
bozgod
out of the loop why was big ben not playing
dong shot
bosgod
whats the news with big ben
whos our 3rd string qb btw is duck still there
second half
why did boz not dance on the star after that kick
thank goodness
i stepped away at about the 2 minute warning did we get a pick or something
amari cooper doesnt deserve his madden x factor
i expected 5 sacks in this game weve gotten 1 and close to another
tackling is hard
our defense like butter
still nothing man
this team just didnt show up to play a winning formula this is just ridiculous
tony fucking pollard
i guess this is the bend not break d
its like our defense is still gassed from last week
ebron is not great at blocking
need a stop so bad
if they score on this drive its over
i need a dub got money on this to top it off lmao last leg of my safe parlay i shouldve known though lmao
its time for renegade
the one time we actually play for the pass there
might as well just let them score at this rate
i swear im about to go destroy something this is fucking pissing me the fuck off
where the fuck is our run defense today
sick
i cant complain about that one thats just zeke making a play
lol i thought they were prepared to not play down
great job 97
wrap up and drive
wrap up and drive
its alright they will get the first down on this
vince cannot cover
why the fuck do we keep dropping tj into coverage
feels like teams have been able to move the ball pretty much at will all season outside of cleveland
these defensive schemes with all of the lbs 5 yards off the line need to go
zero pressure on the qb
theyre just not getting much pressure dupree or watt needs to get home
can we play a nickel im sick of seeing lbs sitting on wrs in coverage
getting single blocked by backup lineman
everyone play renegade in 321
im about over sports
yes spillane on lamb

cal heyward is such a beast
the team thats playing right now sucks so bad lol
a sack right here would be great
seriously im out of words theres no excuse for any of this
motherfucker
good shit 97
short
im scared
if ben cant get us a dub here criticism probably valid love the guy but these things force you to ask questions
theres no sugar coating this shit this is fucking awful
how in the fuck did he beat baltimore and tennessee back to back just to come out with this
i thought we were very bad against the run last week because of the defensive game plan to contain lamar

but it looks like that game was not a one off
rudolph was dogshit last year but i genuinely feel like we had more of an intermediate pass game this year it feels like this year its a deep ball 40 yards down the field or a 2 yard drag
last two times we played them we trailed by 10 in the 4th and ultimately won
only thing that makes sense for the ds performance is that the cowboys chose a guy who hasnt started in like 3 years hard to gameplan for someone you dont know
with how our o is playing we need a td in the first couple plays of this drive because our d also isnt giving us favors we cant keep having dallas waste 6 minutes of the clock
i want to die
lets go was all juju that drive
thank you juju
juju is the big winner on that drive
he ruined that db lmao sent him stumbling to timbuktu
cowboys get yet another one on us in the trenches
of fucking course
of course
would be nice if we could stop somebody
wow randy gregory was dumb there youre still winning dude
hope he doesnt miss the kickoff
juju tried to pull the to celebration
we cant have anything nice today
makes me fucking sick
my one gripe with special teamskicking blocked fgspats shouldnt really be considered misses sometimes they are the fault of the kicker but most of the time the kicker cant really prevent that like if you put tucker on a team with a weak oline he would miss a lot more from blocks not from lack of skill
feel like that should have been reviewed he was close to stepping out
unreal
out special teams is absolutely destroying us what on earth
if we lose we deserve it
you have to be fucking kidding me
this is one of the worst special team performances by any team i have ever seen
tomlining
just fucking kill me now and put me out of my misery
offense check defense check kicking check add special teams to steeler failing today
cant even watch
this coaching staff is just so fucking stupid sometimes unbelievably stupid
lmfaooooo gotta love this team
so many blocks in the back on that return
guess my pooping mojo is gone
jesus fucking christ enough already
told yaaaaa we arent that good
just kick it out of the fucking endzone my god
this is unbelievable you pooch kick it to the left side and dont cover the left sideline wtf
this game does not want to be won
lol what a fucking nightmare
this team is going to be the death of me
what the fuck
shouldve traded for gilmore
this is really embarrassing man wtf is this
reminder this is a 4th string qb
im very worried
special teams is so dookie
hold them to 3 and still need one td anyway come on
thank god lets goooooo
lets goooo minkahhhhhh
please not us
flag
god dammit man
thank fucking god
phew
pain
fitzpatrick
we can manage that lfg minkah
make them pay
thank fucking god
at least no score for dallas
we took big advantage of their olineman dropping out of the race ill take it
anyone think romo is doing a good job tonight
rtp please no
holy shiiiit pleeeaaase
fitzmaaaaaaagic
woooow i wish minkah would have stayed in the end zone on that one but hey well take it
whos ball
also watch a reply terrible call holy shit i dont usually like to complain about refs but weve been hosed
that wasnt a blind side
refs have been so bad this game
great work
99 yard mvp drive
you just know this somehow has chris boswell 50 yard gamewinning field goal written all over it
moving the ball well here
why can offsides be declined but not false starts
fuck man smh
well well welllllll
not like this
thatll do smh
no
oh my god
incomplete pass
jesus christ
im back boys only 2 inches of snow
oh christ
bs call lol
jaylon smiths arms are huge
hold fuck now they want to call penalties on dallas
fuck you dallas fuck you romo
they just want to keep the game interesting they do this every week
super bowl teams will find a way to win


no matter the circumstances
lucky here
what a disaster lol
wow my heart
jesus fuck that was terribly thrilling no me guesta
at least the refs are consistently garbage
phew cash it in boys
if this is on mcfarland

get him out
dallas losing their minds
lve

thank you
what the actual fuck
catch the ball ebron sheesh
we got this
ebron you dropped it

dont stand there like you the man
claypool had a lane there why did he toss it to ebron

ben feels uncomfortable throwing left and i think the d knows it
lets get a safety
cant believe im saying this but our pass rush is too slow
lets go defense
our defense and special teams to blame today

seeing mccarthys mask makes me uncomfortable
johnson is so bad once he catches the ball just run straight
johnson baby
djjj
holy fuck diontae
great play dont score too fast though
wow what an ugly set of plays i dont know why ben cant hit anything beyond 15 yards anymore when his arm is still a cannon glad they finally called something when ben gets hit for once
just torch the clock kick a field goal to win it and call it a day

my fucking heart

i thought they were gonna challenge that
get conner in the game man
keep the clock running please
stay in bounds claypool
diontaethats my guuuuy

deeeeeeejayyyyyyyy

goddamn it stay in bounds lol
stay on bounds
why didnt mccarthy challenge that wow a gift
run the clock
just spike the ball so they cant review
physically im tired mentallyemotionally im drained
lfggg boyssssss
did i miss something happening to conner
eric lebron
ebron jump
lets fucking go
i need to change my pants
do not at all let them have a chance to run this kick off back
should have stayed in claypool
ebron 1000 iq play
tony romo literally called that play lol
ebron i just hope scoring quickly doesnt come back to haunt them gotta trust the defense though
we are so fucking lucky this week better get our head out of our ass i dont want to see any positivity after the game
going for 2 is the best option
its happening
ebrooooon
nice but too much time on the clock
go for 2
boss move
leaaaap
stay in bounds claypool
ebron
fucking right
go for 2
go for it
ah fuck
lets go d get fucking nasty

ben a little lower there buddy
one d stop and its done
i trust our pass rush to end this game keep bud tj out of coverage please
lets goooooo deefeeennnssse
time for the d to get up
man we needed that
we miss the 2 point and this thread already calling it a loss and we should fire tomlin lmao
thank fucking god
lets go defense
we finally have the lead now all we have to do is keep it
god this team gives me anxiety lmao thank god ebron is ridiculous now the defense has to pull out the nipple clamps on em
so a pass to the corner of the endzone wasnt an option on that play it was all inside slants
not pi
whats eating garret grapetj
of course
is conner hurt or benched
good idea to blast the kick out of the end zone
my facial expression during this game is about the same as that progressive sign guy i am just dead inside
welp not a good start
should be working but had to get in there after that ebron td

how was todays game tho
sutton gets those man
that was almost it
one stop please
lets go defense
sutton still could have caught that
how was that not blown down lol
same thing next week boys
lets go defense
he was in grasp
never in doubt
the defense finally gets the pass rush going
lets fucking gooooo
cam murdered that lad
lets goooooo
defense took my energy and used it well
weird game
and thats how you treat the fourth string qb that should have been happening all afternoon
i mean with the fouls they called probably should have tried to protect gilbert
i knew we could do it
cam is a bad man
we dem boyz
fuck yes
cameron just lifters that dude
ive never been so happy to be wrong still not the way you want it to go
thats my shit
cam lifts weights
hugeeeee stop d
you love to see it
never worried not once obviously the standard is the standard
lets fucking go

tj
oh sweet baby jesus
just protect the ball
we were all so fucking mad before lmao
tj watttttt

cameron heywardddd
ill take it
ugly win is a win
what a turnaround

didnt lose in the trap game

if you took the points tough break i dont blame you
tony romo can suck a dick
cam said please sit down
now the real question is why tf were we not blitzing this guy the whole game defense played so conservative
defense really hasnt been that bad two tds given up two takeaways two sacks i dont like the amount of rushing yards tho
the steelers are the comeback kids
lets go
barring some flukey bullshit it looks like we preserve our win streak and our 25 point streak
wtf are they doing
go for it
why
what are they doing
the offense can never just end the game
oof
why no field goal
watch that cost us the game
hold on what the fuck
cant get one yard okay
jesus christ my heart
what the fuck
there a chance well ever see romo coach
horrible decision
romo has a good point there
mothfucker
fuck conner
lets go d
pls god
why not shoot a fucking field goal lmao
im like fred sanford about to go to elizabeth over here watching this team should be an olympic endurance sport
always heartburn
ok defense take my energy 1 more time please
hes out
guess we dont get the useless accolade of 25 or more for the first 8 games
jfc come on
wow
stupid stupid decision
every game gotta be a nail biter huh
i think he tried to slide a little early
this is why i didnt say anything yet



here we go
why not
lamb is going to be a good one
jezus fuck
um
they just cant make it easy
please go please
wtf why
wtf kick the field goal
fuck seriously
of course is coming down to the wire
how does that happen
fuck this play calling fuck it unbelievable
can we just play the browns
i just dont get how a field goal isnt kicked there and if you go how is it not a sneak
wtf is going on
why the fuck
jesus lol i dont know what the problem is specifically but this run game gives me no confidence
oh jesus christ
cmon cmon please defense clutch this up please
his heels landed out of bounds
oh god
tf
i think my butthole has actually closed up at this point
lets go defense
stupid motherfuckers
come on defense get another sack
afraid of a pi call
lets go defense
didnt we just do this
please no
romo just willing the cboys
yo i dont feel good about this
edmunds

doesnt even try for the ball there
lets go defense
do we play renegade again lol
lets go defense
that the hold lol
prevent defense
we are getting held like crazy no calls
they gonna score
the time the time
wheres the hold
lets go defense
holy deja vu
well lamar failed with this opportunity lets see how gilbert does
oh thank god
win
wow
lets goooo

every steelers game
hell yeahhhhhhhhgh
i was wrong by 1 point
cant wait for the next two games
lets gooooo
80
this team gives me more scares than any horror movie ive seen
can i get a hell yeah
lets goooooooooo
if we lose this game i dont wanna hear shit from anybody that were a sb team
were down 130 against a team thats 26 with a fourth stringer oh and were supposedly 70
is this the day where our season basically ends i dont care if we go 160 or 97 with rudolph we wont score a point in the playoffs
no chance he has the distance
lol if he couldnt make it from 54 yards he prolly wont make it from 59

edit damn homie proved me wrong lmao
so bens injury looks reeeeeally likely to be and lcl injurysprain depending on the severity grade 1 he could come back if its higher than that idk if you can play through that and he would be out idk whether him playing on it was good or not as that may mean its either completely torn and he couldnt feel any pain or its a low grade sprain and he is just a beast
our defense is overrated i dont wanna hear any of you optimistic people claim we are a great team both sides of the ball were inconsistent and not that good
i love that no one is defending this bullshit its q3 and they continue to allow the cowboys to drive

this is a loss they cant play on offense or defense ive lost faith in this team over one game like fuck you cant even beat a fucking 4th stringer ridiculous
shut the fuck up you bastards that was a good call
we have zero intermediate passing game
youd think we were 26 according to these comments
explain this field position they got called for an illegal block in back at around their own 20 so the ball should be on their own 10

x200b

edit they just showed the replay it was the dallas 15 yard line penalty is supposed to be from the spot of the foul not the end of the play so it should have been half the distance and ball on about the dallas 7 they were off by like 60 yards
i called that long throw dumbass ben he cannot complete the long throws
rudolph is fuckin terrible
rudolph sucks rectum
losing 136 at halftime to a team thats 26 with their fourth stringer playing take it as you want but we arent that good
steelers couldnt beat my sons pop warner team due to steelering our coaching staff is absolute trash this is getting old
they are going to fg us to death because our offense is absolute trash
this team fucking sucks lol
is this game thread more dramatic than usual or has it been that long since weve had a bad game
ive seen enough dionte for one season
wont win any playoff games with this offense
were really about to lose to the fucking cowboys
i know it looks we are gonna win but i have a really bad feeling about this
no fg attempt what a fucking bum ass coach
god damn i miss zeke on my buckeyes

snatched defeat from the jaws of victory today boys dont even care that we won the asterisk next to that win is larger than the fucking numbers good lord i hope they figure out the play calling and special teams because that shit is gonna bite us in the ass again
play stupid games win stupid prizes dallas

shouldve just let the man kick
gonna make a scrub look like a god
trap
its insane how we manage to waste timeouts after a few minutes every single game awesome
smh this defense
people at work said i was crazy when i said this game would be closer than it needed to be and we would likely drop it
this is about what i expected typical steelers playing down to their opponents
faking an injury should be a penalty
3rd and 13 dallas about to get a td knowing the steelers
room sucking dallas dick all day like he did baltimore last week
silver blue man bad


black gold man good
we can realistically lose out
i thought this year was different but its the same old steelers we may still get a first round bye but its one and done in the playoffs
looks like all the critics were right
our defense is fucking garbage
my godddddd this is sad
this is why i was worried about this game we dont travel west well and normally struggle against the cowboys
sutton give me a break you pussy
oh chase thats the second today my dude
you gotta catch that
man ben just doesnt have the deep ball anymore sad to see
boswell taketh
missed 2 extra points but made a 59 yard field goal lol
vander esch always seemed like a bitch to me
that was a gift get off the dudes face mask
i really dont trust boswell but holy shit
i dont know if i trust boswell to hit the game winner if it comes down to that
theyre gonna run this 1st down and then torch us over the top
our defense is so bad we blitzed and couldnt get to him and we got bailed out by the overthrow
cowboys trying so hard to lose but we wont let them we built different
were gonnna lose the game
they didnt deserve this game at all id be pissed with that roughing the passer if im a cowboys fan
the refs looked really good in the 4th quarter vs the cowboys
if we made one pat and hit that fg it would be game over thanks boz
71
real steeler fans here smh
i hate to say trap gamebut
ben vick lol
i hate romo lmao
why throw it into double coverage ben is so inaccurate on the deep ball
gonna be one of those games where we hate catching the ball eh
damn mapletron just dropped a td
and so it begins
lol here we fucking go
here we go
what the fuck
hef fucking brady
i think my minkah jersey is cursed the d seems to play sloppy every time i have it on take it off and boom they play better sigh
lmao gonna be a long fucking day getting worked by this team because our defense has zero killer instinct
pittsburgh d what the game started we thought this was sunday night game we better get a sack
we made the stop cmon lets go people
did ben tell out what the play was gonna be there
this is sad lol
yall need to stop worrying only 3 drives into the game come on now
mccloud must be injured
about time ben started calling the plays
is conner hurt again why isnt he out there i literally just traded for him in one of my fantasy leagues
sometimes i look at randy fichtner and i think yes

but most of the time i look at him and i think why
uninspiring
honestly we were overdue for a classic trap game what is this a 4th string qb
this is the tomlin special
jesus christ can we get our shit together
70 is a fluke huh i mean come on what are they doing
can we just never play another toilet team ever again besides the browns and bengals
every stillers fan feeling like cassandra right now
dont why anyone thought we were going to blowout the cowboys i mean we only beat the broncos by 4
pretenders
this is normal dont worry
um
thankfully for me my happiness died when virginia tech lost to liberty yesterday you cant hurt me this time steelers
there was a false start
cowboys gonna run up the score lmao ben getting to break records
neutral observer connor looks like hes running in slow motion he isnt good
lol cowboys showed up to play
true steelers game right here
bro what the fuck
wow fml
ok maybe we are gonna lose
what the fuck is this commercial
im so fucking tired of this
i guess ben likes to fight from being behind
ben has no deep ball this year its sad
ben only throws bombs nowadays to bait dpis
and now we are fucked gg guys
the wheels on the bus come falling off falling off falling off
lol
why is it when we tank the entire fucking team tanks
fuckin boz come on son
freaking boz
lucky we are not down by two scores
just play rudolph and sit ben if he isnt badly hurt fingers crossed he needs to rest for the bengals next week this game isnt worth it
lol holding end of half
he has the velocity of a dad at a tailgate
no zip behind that rudolph pass
fucking grabass
let me guess holding
juju saving mason there
no ben no chance
jesus could mason have thrown that any slower
who the hell called a turnover forcing mason to finish the half
bring in dobbs
why didnt juju run straight he literally ran into the left to try and truck a defender
this is sad bout to be losing at half time to a 26 team lol
thats too far for boz
for once in our fucking seasons can we just play a garbage team and not fucking play shitty
why do teams still do this dumb freeze the kicker shit lol it does nothing
fake fg
2018 boswell back on the menu
lets drag this shit out longer
just throw a hail mary
cursed score
boswell can make fgs in shit conditions but cant make an extra point inside a dome on artificial turf wat
boz should heave it to the end zone on a fake
curse the gods
fire randy
ill ask again can we please get a turnover
bud is not having a great game
outplayed
does tj have a limp
lol if gingers had a soul that dude in the stands just lost it
i really want to know what are percentage is on the deep ball this year
embarrassing
they arent gonna win this game playing like they are theyve shown they dont know what the fuck theyre doing its the fucking cowboys the fucking cowboys
terrible in virtually every aspect punting is the only positive
plenty of times guys i know it hasnt looked like it today but this is a top o for bottom d
cowboys the new raiders to us
thats gonna cost dallas i feel like
we got this leggo
for anyone who cares about the spot on this game the steelers were 135 favorites hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
does they not know the steelers cant dominate inferior opponents
i just remembered steelers had a decent cordinator and our offense looked fun this is debatably the most boring and bland offense in the nfl
holding on ebron smh
jujuuuuuuuuuuu
juju is rockstar
juju smith schusterrrrr

fuck this special teams coach leave his ass home trash
turning off see you next weekend gang
this game is fantastic
this is a debacle
bruh what
fucking danny smith
please fire danny smith the special teams play is pitiful
are run defense is trash without bush
which team is 26 again
youd think that youd want to avoid kicks being returned when playing a team with john fassel as the st coach but were the steelers so we need big brain plays
what fucking team is this

i swear that we dont practice for bad teams we think were to good and just ignore them im fucking over this kind of play someone needs a foot in the ass and it needs to start with our coaches
seriously what are we doing on defense this entire game no pressure no run stop no pass stop its crazy
fucking flag
game over
great now we get it on the 1 fitz couldnt just take a knee
get your shit together nantz
ftlog please let us make a deal for the jets first round pick
game over
vander esch is a bitch for that punch
what a piece of shit wtf
lets run the ball a little
vander esch just tossed a punch
possible ejection
yo wtf vander straight punched
thad castle losing it out there understand why bms never won a natty with him as captain

alex moran for life
what does outside the numbers mean
actually cut this whole special teams unit they almost blocked that shit again
we cant stop them
the blitz just isnt working surprisingly this qb is picking it to bits
this isnt good
plenty of time 3 time outs and 2 min bens moving the ball all we need to fg
ik they let those go and ik ab def did it a shit ton but i hate how coop only got separation there cause he pushed off
i actually have a heart problem so i think this might be my last steelers game
fuck you clay poo
cant win em all
of fucking course ben throws it poorly

edit it okay
3 and out typical steelers
how are they not calling the grab and shove on claypool there
announcer i cant believe it

me either i cant believe it lets not shit away these 4 downs too
yes throw 3 straight balls to the guy who has dropped almost all of them today lol
right in the face
that wouldnt get called 15 years ago but it was to the face so i agree with the call in 2020
man i love the steelers and all but that roughing the passer call is horrible for the league
claypool needs to catch with his hands not his body
dont know why juju isnt getting targetedthis isnt chases game right now
claypool couldve reeled that in thats like the third catchable ball he didnt handle
almost want to claim randy is calling good plays we just cant execute but fuck randy anyway
if i were a ref and a coach came up to me and started losing his shit all the time id flag him i get being grumpy but damn have a little composure
we dont deserve this win if we get it that call on bens facemask is technically correct but holy shit is that a bail out call
do not trust our defense
scored too quickly ive seen this before
cumshot baby
we sucked ass today but got the dub all that matters
oh look were running it
80 you fuckers hahahahahhhhhhhhhhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
im not relaxing with this down to special teams
im fucking done
tomlining
watch us lose on a tebow to demaryius thomas slant route
whyyyyy
heel was out of bounds
if we lose it will be on tomlin alone
lmao incoming td and tomlin wont say anything meaningful about that decision
cmon tj
thanks for the heart attack tomlin
every fucking week
im ashamed right now
hahahahah none of the fucking steelers look like theyre gonna win hahahhaa
yoooooooooo
our defense is so fucking overrated
hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah hahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahhhahahahahahahahahahhhhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
our defense is so bad we are not the best defense in the league
yup 100 trap game incoming
this defense isnt good
dont worry guys some crazy ass splash play will happen to save these sorry ass coaches from being blamed for how awful at football they are
ben shoulda retired so we could have gone and got someone with this defense
so boswell is making 59 yarders and missing multiple extra points in a game sounds like harrison butker
pathetic tomlin absolutely pathetic
does the steelers defense know the word consistency play well one week and play like shit against the fucking cowboys of all teams

edit as soon as i said that there was an intmy comments never age well
is it just me or does johnson suck once he catches the ball he tries to do way too much
lmaooo we really bouta lose
lmao this team is a first round exit
why tf do you not call a play before the 2 minute warning little shit like that is just stupid
please stop playing down to the competition
maybe ben should fucking practice more during the week this wasting the entire first half shit is garbage
apart from awful play calling i know this is unheard of on the forum but ben has been slight avarage just above duck and rudolph but thats not saying much we should go back to short passes for 34 yards out quick and just tied the shit out of them
i dont see the issue were playing like a tomlin coached team
probably gonna be a three and out here because why not lol
fuck this cracka claypool go beat his ass
this is the worst defense weve had this decade
refball
we dont deserve to win lol
steelers are so bad fire tomlin fire fichtner fire rooney fire heinz fire the allegheny and fire the primanti brothers and ben should retire
this is a one and done team
strength of schedule finally showing
i just want one bad season so we can fire this entire garbage coaching staff
we should trade for fitzpatrick even if bens okay lul
tank and hopefully we can get a low teens pick
typical game thread yall know teams dont go undefeated right
fuck that white fool
the sad thing is this isnt even the least bit surprising if this steelers team cant beat this absolute dirty toilet of a cowboys team just pack it up for the year cause theyre not beating the chiefs either
absolute meltdown what the fuck
that was a fucking false start
having mccarthy as hc looking fucking sexy rn
im so fucking done
mike tomlin will not win coach of the year because for some reason he cant beat the absolute worst teams in the league this game is over in the first half for good coaches instead we are down two scores to a high school team
hahahahahahahaha
romo is royally pissing me off
chick fila advertising on a day theyre not even open lmao
maybe thatll wake your ass up ben
ben cant throw deep anymore no one in the league will respect it
take him out
we arent that good
that looks like that outside of the knee looks like an mcl
special teams defense offense all horrible all fucking terrible
duck dynasty

is hodges still with the organization
this team needs to get its fucking shit together this is so fucking ridiculous
wait why didnt dallas just decline the penalty
good teams dont lose to shit teams take it for what its worth
yikes losing to the cowgirls
still think well win
wtf chase
claypool more like claypoopypants
what the fuck boz
when we lose by 2 i might cry
this team fucking sucks horse cock
we lost
we cant score here offense is terrible and well be at the 5 or some shit because minkah wanted to run it for some reason lol
how did rudolph do
claypool you bum

call me crazy but i go for it
stupid motherfuckers take the field goal seriously
we dont really deserve to win this one so whatever happens happens
i want the steelers to win but that was a bullshit unnecessary roughness call
yep were steelering already
and so begins the steelering
we always play down to our opponents
mahomes is going to pick this defense apart im really not looking forward to it
this dude is better than ben
its the nfl youre going to concede some points no matter what im not super worried about the defense just yet

im a bit more concerned our qb is washed and were stuck with his buddy oc
worst coaching in the league always shows in these type of games
classic tomlin coached team underprepared as usual
59 yards ahahahahaha just go for it instead
edit fuck ok then
should the steelers have drafted jalen hurts or jacob eason to replace mason rudolph
may as well onside kick it because tomlin and butler are morons and cant stop a nosebleed on defense
nice ball at the 2 yard line we aint driving 98 yards
off topic but our team needs cheer leaders
yeah my brother and i are both yelling at them to stop celebrating youre losing to the 26 cowboys you have zero room to do any celebrating
ive been pissed at pittsburgh for voting in joe biden but if we go 80 ill forgive the city
removed
its funny to see the tomlin apologists squirm its never tomlins fault as much as i hate seeing the steelers lose watching the apologists reach to blame everyone but tomlin is quite comical

tomlin develops the game plans with the coordinators you doofuses
i said the super bowl hope was done once bush was done for the year thats looking pretty accurate at this point
tomlin should be fired for incompetence if they lose this game there is no way you worry about a guy blocking a fg go up 8 and win the game
lol here we go the mike tomlin special coach the team to try and coast and get eaten alive by a shit team
cmon tomlin tell me you prepared this team
doesnt matter if the steelers come back or not the defense has big weaknesses that they cant make up for and theyre coached by a jackass who doesnt know how to use his best players i dont see how this team can stop mahomes or score enough to keep up with him any top 10 qb dismantles the secondary

mike tomlin thinks this is acceptable
he just missed a 54 why not do a hail mary
interception from ben is kind of our way now or juju 50 years run after catch to fumble
say what you want but my negativity is a game winning formula lol its like it kicks the steelers into high gear
this is what i get for thinking that 100 was possible after beating the ravens i should have known better

steelers gonna steeler
wow we fucking suck
lmao someone tell me we are a super bowl team
im sorry but tomlin is at fault for what ive seen so far i love the guy but theres no reason we should be down 10 fucking embarrassing
not a sb team

oh shit is it 30 seconds left in the 4th no stfu cry baby whiners
about time we lost tbh
thank god we have a defense lol that 70 is a bit misleading offensively last week and today weve been dreadful might have had more offense last year and thats saying something
sit ben rudolph got this
we need a new kicker next season
we suck
how in the fuck does offsetting penalties not result in playing whatever the outcome of the down was
so we are gunna believe he can make it from 5 out lol
im happy but the false start on a kick rule is dumb
remember when people were saying this team was special
lmfao fuck this garbage i have to go watch arizona v miami at least that game is a real fucking game
claypool looking like a bum this game
if we win this they should take it away because we dont deserve it lol
literally 1 step forward 2 steps back every play this team that showed up todays not getting past the divisional win or lose
johnson has no moves at all this dude stinks
this team is so fucking overrated lol
told you guys we arent that good
americas team is going down
steelers will win by 50 lol
elliot continues to run all over us
terrible
fuck
lol i cant believe he they just marched 65yds good on highsmith to hold it to 3 but i am dissatisfied
remember in the water boy when they are playing in the bourbon bowl and in the first half and louisiana defense is dominating the muddogs because they are reading the football for dummies that coach kline uses thats how it feels when fichtner gets in 2nd and 3rd and long defense knows exactly what play he is going to call really annoying we have so many weapons wish we could do some imaginative plays more
jesus
this special teams has no idea what theyre doing
dont let fucktner call a fucking play again
enjoying seeing antmac out there a lot
its happening
is conner hurt
yikes this is big bad
they are dominating us
why do i feel like we didnt prepare this game whatsoever
we fucking suck
this is pathetic
fire everyone
garrett gilbert was signed two weeks ago off the aaf and the cowboys have a historically bad defense and the the cowboys o line only has 1 starter in
you guys are mad at what im saying but cannot deny we do not look like a jv team
i wonder when were going to wake up
bengals and jags next two weeks after this we couldve started 100 smh
welp here we go wondering when we would shit the bed against a bottom barrel team in classic tomlin era steelers fashion we were a bit overdue for it so far this season but looks like here it is
we look like a fucking high school team
stop letting fichtner call the plays now jesus fuck
wtf
hahahahabahabababababahahahahahahahajajahahahahahahajahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahah
hahahahahahahaahhaa if we lose randy should be fired
garbage
if you watched this game and were told one team was 70 and one was 26 you would not be surprised if you were told which team was 70 vs 26 you would be shocked
no block in the back on that what the actual fuck
someone definitely needs thrown out on their ass this is fucking so fucking stupid fuck this team
what the fuck lmfao
he cant even hit a drag route
guys have some faith

maybe i just never noticed before but are there more commercials than normal this year
if hes hurt the seasons over
get him out
they best draft a solid qb in the offseason
we have mason if we need him
if ben is hurt trade for darnold now
boo boo ben
worshington
would have been nice to have some plays like these 25 minutes ago
lol fail on all three phases today of course hed miss the extra point lofl
the gasp i just let out
that should not have worked
cmon rudy
probably holding
that was lucky maybe
calling blocked fg for td now

edit glad it was wrong just felt inevitable
i hate his stupid face
what is this fucking josh scoby
nobody should be surprised
hahahahahaha
oh mama
announcers on my stream saying ben isnt coming back
bro wtf
this defense sucks all around but the run defense is particularly egregious
steven nelson needs to be cut wasnt even close to tackling zeke
lol pitiful today i guess they need a loss to come back down
so the defense was other teams playing down to us noted
whoever sent ben in early needs to make an apology to every steeler
i believe it tony
okay backyard ben time right guys
neil odonnell
right through the wickets
hey bince make a fucking play
fuck sake
of course
juju worrying about his celebration
well we are losing in all 3 phases especially special teams we are gunna have to own this if we lose we looked pretty flat all around no excuses
i wish i could take back all that effusive praise ive been heaping on this run defense i feel like a damn fool
fuck these refs man
fuck my ass minkah
now they gonna call pi lmfao
why is ben telling receivers what to run how do we have 0 plays
ejection time
personal foul fuck dallas
vander esch dirty bastard
man should they go for this
maybe stop blitzing the qb
our cbs are atrocious tonight
our defense is not the best defense in the league please stfu if you actually think it is
dpi
fucking whew
i think dionte was out of bounds therebut im happy about it
stop being a crybaby tony
too much time im nervous
fuckkkk defense
defense get your shit together

i hate tony romo


is anyone really surprised ive said we arent that good lol do not be surprised
removed
boswell josh scobee
this team fucking sucks nobody defend them they can hardly even beat the cowboys

tomlin may be the dumbest head coach on the he fing planet hes rah rah af but my god is he dumber than a sack of bricks got soooo lucky
i think im willing to accept ben has no deep ball anymore
this offense is embaressing
removed
tonight on days of our steelers


but wtf is wrong with ben
this would be the worst 80 team in nfl history
james connor fucking stinks
remember when all you guys were coming at me for saying we arent that good defense is overrated offense sucks and we arent a sb team
we are not a 70 team
rooneys should honestly just throw about 15 million a year at lincoln riley and see what he says tomlin aint it 3 playoff wins in a decade with a hof qb time to go
who knew that garret gilbert would be playing decent
ben is faking the shit out of that injury
imagine if we had a coach that knew how to make games easier
if mccarthy can do this with a 4th string qb and terrible team imagine what he could do with this steelers team
putting the game back into the hands of our bottom tier defense gulp
why the fuck would they take the penalty lmao

alright i get it they had no choice
fuck you claypool
fire tomlin at half im not even joking this is not the type of mentality and culture we need on our team
this is going to get ugly soon
hahahaga
best d in the league stayed in the locker room
let the playing down begin
fucking cowards
wow were really not that good lol i do not see us beating the chiefs or seahawks

im just chilling today wanna win but dont matter either way lol
fucking bums i guess they are taking the week off
can we just take the l and end the game here save us all some time
tomlin did absolutely nothing to prepare this team i see probably told them it was a guaranteed w

we are not a super bowl team
cancel the season
im gonna switch off
landry jones sighting
why the fuck didnt we get jameis god fucking damn
terrible throw
boz going back to his old ways does not fare well for us this reminds me all to much of the raiders game
our run d has been really questionable recently
how did this team beat the ravens and titans lol
another ben overthrow
hits a 59 yarder

misses two pats
bens accuracy is worse than helen keller throwing the football

3rd and 10 automatic conversion incoming
wtf boz
cut steven nelson please
boswell is so garbage lol

ive been a steelers fan for looonnngggg time and when the inferior team gets big plays off early we take a l ive seen it too many times but lets have faith yall
unbelievable
do you all realize that the coordinators meet with the head coach every week and talk about the game plan its tomlins fault it always is
season is over
seasons over
watt has been a worthless addition
thas gonna be a hold on us edit nm glad im wrong just expect them to call shit on us always
fuck mike tomlin
you guys are all saying it was a bad tomlin call cause hes black s
theres people out there that still think mike tomlin is a top 5 head coach lmfao
ben looks bad as usual
i think those tomlin apologists and truthers might be quiet after tonight
we are the worst team in the nfl
we are not that good


i dont think weve ever deserved to lose more than right now
nobody is going to say anything about the bs roughing the passer that was called on ben but the horse collar on gilbert was a legit play gimme a fucking break how can you be this obvious as a ref and get away with it
now elliot begins running all over us we are so fucked

just call the game man give us the loss for a bye week id rather that than watch the rest of this shit
boswell just made me break two of my controllers dumb fuck
i hate mike tomlin
guaranteed turnover touchdown for dallas right here
tomlin is a bad coach
they continue to run all over us how sad is remit their third string qb can have a td in their opening drive and ours overthrows receivers and kills the drive
you guys look like hot garbage tonight
see you guys next year
ben bailing tomlin out again 13th year now
its not the players tomlin just sucks
this game is over our offense cant stop with lame incompletions and their qb can complete those

our season is over
put in mason this game is over anyways
should have declined bitches lol
cowboys fan here refs won this game for you which is sad cause were absolutely terrible

good for you man

i hope you both enjoy the experience cheers

my wife bought us tickets for this game but then covid happened i hope you guys had a blast
youre a good big bro

what a game wow at least it wasnt a blowout for yall

how do two brothers end up fans of different teams very curious lol
rae you roys brother
my brother is raven fan

i know its a cowboy hat but this has major tips fedora energy

love the jersey doe
never too early for christmas
james conner having a bit of a look there
from pittsburgh moved to foxboro ma haha i held my own as a steeler fan moved to denver i still hate the color orange to this day lol now im in new hampshire its so fun to see how many steeler fans there are all over the us and world love it
go steelers
try israel

the cowboys always wear white uniforms
because everywhere is a home game for us
cowboys home colors are white and steelers away is also white
because we own the cowboys
i googled this once dallas always wears white at home so the opposing team wears their own full colors it was an ownership decision back in the day so that fans in dallas didnt see the same exact blue vs white every home game
home team gets to pick their jerseys
cowgirls always wear white at home
removed
because its 3rd and 8 and he likes the extra cushion
two super bowl rings not a single season of his career as a starter without a winning record a slam dunk hof resume and an undefeated record this season all by doing what hes good at

thats why
i mean if claypool had 1 more step on him thats a td and he just trying to show off his bionic arm
defense should be trying to prevent a 1st down so it should be a good opportunity to take a shot riskreward
rather it be thrown over than under
better than an int
big ozzy osbourne fan
because our play calling is fucking retarded as shit for the first 2 quarters every fucking game we like to play down to opponent skill and play catch up dumb as shit



this looks like it is it out of stock rn though
that looks like the color rush hoodie
moin moin meister
are you in pit now

try these official stores if so

dm me if you need a hand
removed

view poll
there was a slight hold but he has to make that play anyways ben put that in his hands doesnt get much better than that
still shouldve been caught
no it was decent coverage and then it just went through claypools hands
removed

its the first quarter lets relax lol
this is embarrassing as hell

some times i wonder if randy finds his plays on madden rookie mode
relaxrelax
lmao right
im tryin lolol gooosefrabaaaaaa
right its like goddamn just play steeler football and theyll be fine its like watching the election every sunday heart attack calm heart attack calm need some blood pressure medicine just for game day
yeah fucking pathetic
this is designed pkaycalling to throw off future essentials games

houston wont be cutting watt theyll trade him
we dont need a dozen half assed posts on this
i could see this only if jj watt realllllly wanted to play with his brothers and thought we pyle win a super bowl next year conspiring with his family to get an organizational wink and nod to know they will trade for him and then jj not show up to camp and force a trade trade to steelers for a 4th round or later and then jj negotiates an extension and renegotiated his salary to lower than bud wants if we somehow go all the way or even just the afc title game bud will be out of the realm of affordability given our other signings jj would basically need to be had for 67mil a year at absolute maximum


run run pass kick
i hate randy with all my life we would be the best offense if ben called the plays
i mean we use the puff puff pass at my house so
there is no bigger myth in football especially in the modern game than run to set up the pass especially nowadays with all of these rpos where youre just trying to get a numbers advantage
ben throwing passes on first and second downs

steelers fans why run run pass
im fine with run run pass if you dont go with your rookie who is 58 208lbs and use your actual starting veteran rb who is 61 and 229lbs dont sub players before you have the game secured
i want our oc to be fired ben is a better oc by miles we were so efficient when he was calling plays the oc sucks he is awful i cant stand him
still dont know why they didnt kick a field goal at the end
lol its pass pass pass right now wtf is going on
just run the 07 patriots offense quick pass quick pass quick pass bubblesmoke a surprise run another quick pass and then chuck one long
this isnt even what happened idk what fucking games this sub watches i feel like im in a different reality on gameday half the time
conner hurt btw
why do they have to wait till the second half to turn it on though its like okayi guess we will play some football now
the offense is seemingly stuck in mud almost every game until the team gets behind or ben is allowed to go nohuddle and dictate the playcalls and pace

if i wanted to watch runrunpass id watch a kent grahamled steelers team
pass to lead run to win no need to fabricate balance that isnt going to be there
dunno it gets us into a hole where we go with an empty backfield playing ben ball which im alright with
and why on the 4th and 1 last offensive play for the steelers do they do a sweep run run offense wasnt working at all short passes were working for the most part clock is going to stop for change of possession regardless so incomplete pass is inconsequential if youre not going to kick a field goal at least do what brought you success the whole game
can i say 1 thing tho idk if it is ben or fichtner but the fuck it chuck it deep and pray for a dpi wasnt working for us this game
removed
not happening we always blow easy games we should win
i mean id like it if that happens unfortunately the steelers love to play down to the competition no offence
tbh i wouldnt be surprised if we win by like a last sec field goal

every game man love that catch up football and love playing down to opponent skill call stupid fucking plays until halftime then randy sphincter decides to do his job and call a decent play or three
damn i forgot the steelers have never overcome a slow start to win a game in franchise history were fucked
amen
what if we fired randy fichtner
they have a long history of it i actually like dallas chances of winning and that sucks to say
removed
there are 2 and a half quarters left relax
too busy making tiktoks

here for the downvotes of course

adjustments at the half is where our coaching staff will get this fixed

shouldnt have to but that is what will do it

damn i needs that in my life amigo
those shitty tshirt people are just getting more clever about how they push their shirts around

dont we usually pick a player with the same number of days as their jersey numbers for these things or did you pick mp because of pick 6s lol

edit nvm i forgot basic math the pick 6 idea wasnt a bad guess though
my body is ready lol
lamar jackson
well he has a few pick 6s
damn i thought the message was kaare vedvik were 6 and we traded him for marcus peters essentially but the 24 thing works too
what happened to that guy that was doing everyone that wore that number everyday
woohooo
removed

welcome to the owners of useless running back merchandise club

signed an owner of an alex collins jersey
why would you think justice hill would be any more than a change of pace 3rd down option
he could still be great man maybe hell be like a change of pace god like sproles
buy low sell high this is just another buying opportunity
3rd string running back didnt hold his value im surprised

uhh do we really allow any shitposts here now i mean come on the only link with the ravens is your jersey and the video quality is garbage
this is a ravens subreddit the only thing ravensrelated is your shirt and i am not sure that qualifies
get off my lawn

im anxious as always about the opening game being a divisional game harbs is 93 on opening day and were usually very well prepared and i bet we come in with a chip on our shoulder since they ran all over us last year in week 3

i think we get the win but ill be more conservative and say something like 2413 but would love to see a beat down like 393
browns fan here i think the 8point spread in favor of your team which will prob go down a couple points as we get closer to sunday is fair there are a few reasons why

our brand new lt jedrick wills has reportedly had a tough time in camp granted he had to move from rt which he played at bama and he was going up against a fullyhealthy oliver vernon but he will be protecting bakers blind side im not sure if i like that going up against your pass rush
in addition to wills foibles c jc tretter has been battling injuries through camp as of today 97 hes back to practicing but hes the anchor of our ol and if hes not ready thats going to be a problem

we have a solid starting four on our dl but lack depth i expect to get a good pass rush going against your ol but i dont expect it to last into the 2nd half

our lb corps is easily the weakest part of our team only takitaki is a known commodity with mack being out if your rbs or lamar make it to the 2nd level that could spell trouble for us

losing s grant delpit was a huge blow although i would think that hes technically an unknown commodity as a rookie having harrison step in takes a load of that weight off but after harrison im not sure how good our safeties will be our cbs are money though

baker has been inconsistent most of these inconsistencies have been in the early part of camphes since smoothed out the rough edges and he looks pretty good nowbut if he struggles again like he did last year the game could easily get out of hand

new coach and offensive scheme with not otas and preseason this is gonna be difficult to streamline we might do better in the 2nd half of the season if stefanski is worth his salt and we avoid major injuries but i dont expect our offense to be ready beyond the first couple scripted drives we are as talented as anyone on offense but its going to be an uphill battle to gel on time

let me know if you have any questions and ill do my best to answer them
ravens are gonna win big

look at our recent week 1 score lines absolute domination over the past 3 years

cleveland has a brand new coaching staff that had a shortened offseason yikes

clevelands defense is a massive liability billings opting out will hurt an already weak run defense many unknowns in the lb and secondary expect a heavy dose of ingram and dobbins

chubb will get his yards but i think ultimately our defense will limit him and the play action

final score ravens 38 cleveland 10
3117 ravens
the only chance they have is to this part is not getting published on reddit
3413 ravens
stressed for this we always seem to struggle against the browns and as always they have the potential to be good this year hopefully this isnt the year they finally click
just got goosebumps im so glad football is back
i shouldnt have watched this bc im all pumped now
blood bath
good write up my man thanks for this
ravens win 4214 lamar throws 3 tds and 300 yards
3320 ravens mayfield with a late 4th quarter td to make it look like less of a drubbing lamar throws an int at one point but is otherwise the mvp of the game
ravens dominate 3510
can anyone send me a link to stream the game tmrw

its just harbaughs usual rookies to the back of the line thing having patrick queen be the day one starter is quite unusual for him
hollywood was listed as the wr3 going into last years season debut

he then had 150 yards and 2 tds in week 1


this depth chart means notbing
this depth chart was put out by the public relations team not the coaches harbaugh wont even tell the media who is starting at right guard on sunday hes not going to break down the order of every position so the other team knows what to expect this is just something to create buzz and keep fans interested until the season starts
i really wouldnt worry about the 234 spots on the rb depth chart at this time playing well will move you up
harbs doesnt like depth charts
these arent official depth charts just the ravens media making them
this should explain it
also surprised to see snead at pr since hes only returned one punt in his entire careerand only 3 kr too
i wouldnt read too much into it this chart has moore listed behind hollywood and hes not even playing yet also i feel like dobbins may be in that pass catching te3 spot on some plays
proche isnt listed as starting punt returner but he is definitely going to start there by all accounts he won the position battle
deep depth
fantasy owners in shambles
fluker at rg us more interesting probably means phillips starts lol
this offense runs on such a rotation i dont think it will matter also telling other teams who to scheme for is silly
depth chart is made by pr team not the coaches
hey guys just wanted to open a discussion and see what the flock expects out of jaylon this year im super hopeful that he can take the next step in being an edgesetter hopefully mcphee can help mentor him and help him become the pass rusher we all hope for
jaylon ferguson and miles boykin are the two nonrookies whose progress this season will likely define us well be a good team even if we get very little from those two but if we can get breakout seasons from one or both the skys the limit
i expect him to have 2 more quality seasons then put up 15 sacks in the last year of his rookie deal then sign elsewhere see z mcphee kruger etc
fergunsun missed a good amount of training camp with an undisclosed back injury i dont expect him to get more time snaps at olb then bowser or mcphee at least for the first couple games but he will see more snaps at olb then ward
per wink jaylon came into camp in great shape wink had said last year that jaylon didnt really get into pro shape until about halfway through the season i think the offseason additions of campbell and wolfe will help get him more favorable matchups and oneonones this season by year two the game generally starts to slow down for guys and they usually make a sizable jump in productivity i would wager jaylon improves this season and has around 89 sacks
this year i expect nothing of him develop get a few snaps dont embarrass yourself and ill be pleased that being said i mean develop i expect the kid to break into a starting role 12 seasons from now
my conservative hope for ferg is something similar to bowser last year around 5 or 6 sacks but kinda streaky with maybe one or two big splash plays that make a casual fan go who the hell is jaylon ferguson
hopeful but not super optimistic
honestly i dont expect much more than what we got from last year hes still fat as hell and theres been nothing coming out of camp that he adding any other moves to his arsenal i want him to succeed so bad but im not gonna get excited until i see something on field

i really wish we had a preseason lol
seems like the ravens tried to do some funky trade of clowney maybe they didnt see jaylon stepping up in practice or maybe they thought getting clowney was too good to be true
ferguson got a lot of playing time as a rookie and was not good most 3rd rounders dont pan out and i think its very unlikely he does

cmon now
cant do much with logos because of copyright and trademark

sooo can someone smarten me up on cap stuff here if we traded for him from the jags wouldnt we still be stuck with the contract or would the jags eat some of it thus making this a thing where jags are buying draft pics
imagine if edc got us hopkins and clowney this man already stole 2 all pros he almost did it again lol edc is always ready to make something happen
basically the jags would pay him more money up front and then trade him to use for a high draft slot effectively buying a draft pick from us other leagues do this nfl has not allowed it
even if it didnt work out i love edc thinking outside of the box
coming from a casual ravens fan who do we have such a good relationship with in the jaguars organization

ravens seem to always be linked to their players and have traded with them with campbell now

is this a eric decosta thing
well at least he wanted to come here time to move on and get ready for those browns
this confirms hes not good enough to overcome the cap hit wed take
all this is telling me is that were gonna be right back here next fa
still dont know why nfl doesnt allow sign and trades like these its a winwin for both teams jags get draft capital but eat a portion of cap for clowneys bonus and ravens would get clowney and hed take up less cap
im not too keen on clowney anyway i dont think he hustles on defense which is our culture on that side of the ball
this year it makes sense to carry more cap into the season never know who might opt out or be ruled out due to positive tests smart to keep a larger emergency fund
no cap
soooo we can think judon and a pick
in this thread downvote anyone that thinks we could have used some edge help or anyone that calls out what a massive circle jerk this thread is
if they really wanted him they wouldve made it happen pretty frustrating that its always the ravens almost did this or almost did that and almost never the ravens did that

hot takes get clicks dont take it personally
whats crazy to me is the blind faith in big ben hes 38 years old coming off a season ending surgery and was trending downwards even before that i might actually be less surprised by joe burrow balling out or baker having a resurgence than ben being good again
its actually crazy to me the lack of confidence nationwide in this team 124 team minimum
cowboys winning the super bowl is just weird
lol chiefs the only team in the league with more than 11 wins these writers are really trying to get those last preseason clicks
as if bruh
no way wed lose that many games
dude you can find a reporter to say anything people arent doubting us
see im a browns fans who likes to visit here and shoot the shit here once and awhile always come in peace even i know that the ravens are the best team in the north at the moment big ben has to prove it that he can stay healthy and that he still has it you cant pick against the ravens until another team proves to be worthy
sons of bitches
we all should relish being a underdog it makes it that much better when we kick the shit out of every body in the division fuck the brownsthe steelers and the bengals
the way it should be let them sleep
i like it better that way


week 1 will be presented by the new pairing of ian eagle and charles davis
fouts was really good from like 882000ish he would sometimes drop gems that no one else could even approach about how plays develop too bad we have to get old
not related but i never understood how kevin harlan isnt the 1st slot with tony romo but especially how he isnt even the 2nd slot dude is arguably the best playbyplay commentator in the business right now and hes on the 3rd slot for cbs that gets the boring games no one watches however because of this he got to call lamars spin on the bengals that made that play even more legendary
gerry the hard g sandusky or no onemaybe romo and sharpe
best news of 2020
also the fact we are getting announcing groups means football is back dude i officiay got excited its browns week
that really was a friendly reminder because i completely forgot about this
real shit
thank the lord
loved him as a qb after the colts left

fucking hated him as a commentator

anti ravens motherfucker
sucks too bc fouts is an all time great best san diego
qb ever old age a bitch
best sports news of 2020 maybe
why tf was dolphins pats picked for nantz and romo over us lmao
ion eagle sounds like a ship from star wars that could make the kessel run in 9 parsecs
this sub hates him too he was loathed at rchargers because he would try to be so unbiased he came across as charger hating and he seemed to really have a problem with rivers after he broke all of fouts records but why does rravens hate him too
thank you god for your eternal kindness
charles davis is my favorite love that well more than likely get him more than once a year now
i much prefer dan fouts over madden guy
are there any other atl ravens fans on here im looking for a place to watch the game whenre im not going to be the one dude in purple sitting at a booth alone any recommendations for a bar or even a watch party community in the atalanta area if theres not any already would anyone be interested in started our own
hudson grill midtown in atl is home to watch parties for a group called ravens nation south but i dont know if theyre doing watch parties this season
hey atlanta friend im in marietta and ill be steaming crabs for opening day if you want the authentic experience let me know

disclaimer i do have a newborn so you might have to deal with crying that said drinking and crab eating will be done


to this day best game ive ever watched
this one of those plays that you will remember the exact place you were until the day you die haha
denver ravens rest of the audience
damn i got so drunk after that win what a game
i was positive it was going to be a 5th straight year of heartbreak in the playoffs before this ill never ever forget this play and how crazy me my brother and my friend went
has it at the 20
as a ravens fan in broncos country watching this play and winning the game was pretty tight


best view
i think the guy who dropped his jaw is an accurate depiction of the denver fans
i could just be a happy clapper but i remember being so confident that flacco could pull it off really wish i wasnt a uk fan and could enjoy it with it my pals but if sunderland ever win something in my lifetime im sure itll be wild
i remember getting up to turn off the tv before that series but then i figured if something big happened i would want to have seen it
why you gotta do this fam
where can i find the clip of this play with the baltimore announcers saying has it at the 20
live in denver and was watching with my broncos fans friends fucking incredible
this will always be a great memory i can share with my dad by far the most exciting moment ive ever experienced watching sports
one of the greatest moments ever in any sport fr tell me im wrong
i know i was that was xrazy

i didnt even know they made a new lamar pop just ordered lol
nope and same for ray lewis

hope its not a pay league because youll get creamed
yeah youre gonna have a bad time lol
week 8 is going to be a tough one
wouldve been cooler if you got ingram and rg3
is this a meme
week 8 gonna be a struggle

because the nfl did not want to allow us to be that powerful
whats the downside to sign and trades extra paper work

the best thing to come from this was the people who said this mattered and lamar was a shitty thrower switched up and all of a sudden said the pro bowl didnt matter when lamar won the game mvp
thats my quarterback
i want to do this

this is actually a good looking fantasy team rg3 is a wasted bench spot imo though
gl ur bye week lol
i have hollywood and andrews also lol
i thought so too but i wanted to get him in case of injury or covid for a spot start or two i viewed him as my handcuff for lj
crap i forgot to add robert woods as my flex
i remember reading a post not too long ago here about someone wanting to start a league with people from the sub is that still happening or did it already happen ive been trying to join a league with people who arent total strangers for a while thanks
id join if we can set it up to draft tomorrow
same
ok everyone i started a group chat with everyone on this and another post of mine

obj is actually the no2 receiver in cleveland after all
he let humphrey shit all over him last year too
they dont call it the cleveland steamer for nothin

that should be objs new nickname
the no jumper podcast and adam22 are absolutely garbage never trust shit they make up
not sure if i believe this seems like a shitpost
aint those the same hoes who said they fucked the entire 17 suns team bitches be lying
oh odell be worrying about the wrong browns i guess
browns fan here just stopping by to make sure this news was being used in our rivals sub to its full advantage saw a cleveland steamer joke carry on
makes sense that he went to the team called the browns
true or not i really hope marlo uses this to get in his head on sunday
you guys think obj catches the shit with one hand or two
idk she backpedals as soon as the host says you did it kinda sus
what a going on ere loool
listening to those birds chirp was painful tbh
he must have some german roots in him


hes also admitted on air that they get assigned sides to take in order to make for interesting tv

spoiler every program does this sports or otherwise in a week brandt will be for us winning the super bowl its just how tv goes
quick to the pitch forks
hot takes get views and free promotion on reddit like this
yeah but where did the homie schrager have us
real question is did dangelo hall predict lamar winning another mvp is he even on the show
who cares if you get worked up by every negative comment out there sports in general isnt for you
come on kb youre better than that
dont care
also picked the squeelers to take it all this year its just about appealing to large markets
byle krant
that punk kyle brandt is a perennial lamar jackson and ravens hater last year he bit his tongue several times having to give props to lj and the ravens but you could see his discomfort now hes out of the closet in his hate for lamar jackson he is like this typical racist punk who is too scared to be open about it but keeps letting out whiffs of racist drivel so we know who he is
i recently upgraded my cpu cooler to an nzxt z63 which can display any gif on itsadly the only ravens logo version is just the head wiggling left and right
dimensions any other parameters i should know about number of colors it can support stuff like that i guess i could just google it but lets make it interesting here

if you get me those ill think of something
just did a build with the z62 subscribe
when i had just learned how to use after effects i made this one its simple but maybe its what you need

bonus
surely theres a gif of lamars run against the bengals
does it need to be a logo i have one insanely high res gif from last season but it isnt the logo i think its marlon clapping at a texans pkauer but id have to check also have lamar with one of his jukes against seattle thats pretty hd

we would have scored 70 points if we left him in the whole game the man just couldnt miss that day
man i pray we get a super bowl this year to shut up the haters im just glad the season is starting soon though this extended off season has been torture to wait through
crazy thing was he barely ran the ball that day
i love this man more than i love myself
thats my quarterback
after that game i told all my friends hed be mvp they laughed and said the dolphins were bad so i couldnt base my call on anything
couldnt watch it
you mean one year ago today mexploder89 fell in love for the first time
man lamar is cool
my girlfriend lives in hereford right outside of pa and im wondering if i can watch the games on locast without having to purchase game pass
its baltimore county so i would assume so
you could just stream them online pm if you need sites the subreddit got  i havent had cable for a decade and have never missed any game i wanted to watch
its balco so i would assume yes
of course
pretty sure you can even get the games in lower pennsylvania
they have electricity up there now
clay matthews and cam wake are still on the market and we have about 16m in cap space right now not including the expected et3 grievance which i believe will drop us to 12m

would it be more worth it to get a team friendly 1 year deal on a veteran pass rusher or is it more worth our while to let the cap roll over for when we eventually have to pay our young core
both are washed
lets let bowser ball out and work for his payday this year
id rather have suggs back than either of those two
too many big inhouse contracts on the horizon me personally id let it roll over
with the uncertainty around the cap next year and the need to pay stanley humphrey and lamar id say let it roll over since we didnt draft an edge we desperately need ferguson to develop this year
right now ill let the cap roll over we have a very good team i would just let the young guys get more experience
we dont even need those players lol
im for letting it roll over cap is expected to shrink next year and we have some key players that we will want to try to sign
everyone puts too much weight in people being veterans
if last season was any indication theyll roll with our guys until they prove they need help and then well make a move
the trade deadline is still open and injuries happen so nobody should be too much in a hurry to spend what little bit of cap that is left let the process play itself out worst comes to worst if money isnt spent it can be next year in a year where the cap is going to be reduced
let it roll over as it stands but if somebody gets hurt i wouldnt hesitate to give either a call
rolling over cap space is dumb a dollar of cap in 2020 is worth more than a dollar of cap in 2021 because the salary cap except in extreme circumstances inflates

im a simple man i see a dragon with a lombardi i upvote
super stoked that we getting football on thursday in light of everything thats happened and then over the moon that the ravens play on sunday

four chuggas is the correct amount of chuggas before a choochoo
seems weird we are going right into the regular season with no preseason games
i see him throwing bombs to perriman after he darnold gets benched in week 6
my jersey is in a pile at the post office 15m till i pick it up

lj8 every gameday whilst in seahawks territory lets goooooo

edit im wearing it and i feel sexy
this was one of the best days of my life as a sports fan i won on this day
and on gameday we post art modell
were gonna shit on them
wait what there has been so much going on this year kind of not paid attention to the dates getting pushed around and whatnot week one is this week
stunt on these hoe ass brownies
happy that nfl is back

and as always nervous about a ravens game

20 years of this and i still feel wound up before the kickoff

normally id say we crush the brownies but not any more we beat them but i say only by a field goal
elite photograph
lamar jackson is going to light up the nfl in ways its never been lit before lets go
im going duvernay just to get weird with it
patrick queen since hes starting in the middle of the d
jk dobbins
queen will have the biggest impact throughout the season but is what dobbins will play a huge role for the last third of the season
easily queen i mean he could have an average season and still lead us in tackles
if were getting weird with it ill go with phillips winning the rg job three weeks in and having the biggest impact by solidifying the line
queen is the only one starting so him
patrick queen just as a product of being the starting mike but i can see jk getting the bulk of the attention especially if ingram goes down

can confirm
good times
wait dolphins i know the line so does everyone else

fuckkikoalonzo
as a fan of both always hate this game

im sorry who
he was always kind of a jackass i dont miss hearing from him or mdlaw whatever
i immediately unfollowed after he said that if he had that opinion about the movie then thats fine hes entitled to it but my god learn to read the room
i watch basically no movies and didnt even know who chadwick bozeman was until he died seems like he was a great dude though and fuck this guy for just being a contrarian asswipe
i guess if you dont get fired for being terrible at your job for years eventually you get fired for something dumb
yeahhhh i unfollowed him a while ago hes basically a closet racist

flacco tied for 6th in all time playoff wins too found this one here
thats wild brett favre threw 30 interceptions across 13 games then theres brady with 35 interceptions through 30 games
im not surprised that flaccos on the list given how we frequently we made a moderate to deep playoff run the first 7 seasons in his career but dilfer made the list trent defense told me they only need 3 pts dilfer
flacco just went into another gear when we got into the playoffs
also 30 johnny u
the grading system seems kinda whack and arbitrary tbh mostly volume stats randomly thrown together
bottom line everyone above flacco is or will be in the hall of fame


edit plenty below him too
not mentioning ravens legend steve mcnair

bastard
playoff wins are quadruple weighted
flacco is better than ben
unitas at 30 is fucking criminal

thats my qb right there go get that lombardy lamar
those oakleys are nice

big boi no lil boi
for ever ever
suggestion photoshop andr 3000 to rg3 after all they do kinda resemble each other face moles included then youll also have rg3000 standing beside slightly behind playing backup to mr jackson aka big boi no little lil boi
if i had lamar this year i wouldve done this instead i went more general and shopped jameis winston onto larry davids face on the season 6 cover of curb your enthusiasm i call my team curb your interception
mine was im lamarry ms jackson last year this year its big truss

take a look yall img4346jpeg
hell start at some point this year darnold isnt great and gase is gonna get desperate for his job at some point
look at how they massacred my boy
hopefully jets dont get a playoff berth
lifelong baltimore resident just moved to fl to be closer to my mom she lives about 30 mins south of orlando looking for good suggestions on how i can watch the game covidpermitting of course
sport surge
im a ravens fan in fl too rnflstreams used to be the best option for outofmarket fans but they got shut down last year sportsurgenet is the way to go now
nflbitecom
bilasportnet
if you live in an apartment and are unable to get a direct tv satellite theyll allow you to get just the sunday ticket app its like 60 a month for four months and you dont have to have direct tv


its weird not seeing yandas name on there
is the ravens pr chart again
exciting to see patrick queen as a day 1 starter hes in for a tough matchup from nick chubb but can hopefully show us his talents
little surprised to see chris board above malik harrison on the chart but otherwise pretty straight forward
im a bit surprised were only carrying 2 tes given weve be doing a lot of te sets


i guess we do have 2 more on the practice squad
the browns 1 wideout allegedly cant wait to be shit on by the ravens during the week one matchup


edit thought id include my source
yepp 13 of the cleveland steamers is ready to get dumped on who doesnt fancy themselves a nice chest poopy
top quality literal shit post
they should change the name on the back of his jersey to steamer
i mean come on
we do not kink shame except if he has a good game against us
a true 2 receiver
obj plays both sides so he always wins if the browns win he gets to enjoy the taste of victory if he loses he gets to enjoy getting shitted on by his opponent
this is the ravens subreddit

lets not talk about the lil homegirl and her kinks
why else do you think he allows marlon to shit all over him every chance he gets eh
obj eyein his girl on taco tuesday
im sure most are joking but for those who think this is serious i dont think someone like an ig model who has had a stint with 6ix9ine and a child with chief keef can be taken as unpretentious and truthful





but then again fuck obj and this would be hilarious if its actually true
obj has a pretty great response ngl
why do you think he sign with the browns guess it wasnt cus of jarvis
we have been



i would say the opposite that its one of the weaker groups weve had in quite some time our strongest of this decade is probably 2010 2011 or 2014

we really need to moderate what gets posted
source i wouldnt be mad though he was a baller at iowa
what
yeah no


i like the chairs
like the table but hoping that tray doubles for rolling during pregame

is it weird that im not as hype probably because no preseason and im kind of worried about us living up to the hype lol
not gonna watch thursdays game

heck yeah bought my big truss shirt i cant get enough ravens shirts
that big truss shirt is outstanding i might have to pick one of them up
thought they couldnt get the rights for big truss so it became truzz
fire designs if im being honest
for me its always terrell suggs i would always be excited to watch and see what he was going to say or what he was going to do
ed reed he continued to find ways to amaze week in and week out
ray lewis something about the squirrel out of the tunnel always got me so hype
this year itll be yanda for me he was one of the few lineman that was actually fun to watch
todd heap
jamal lewis running behind ogden on the left side was amazing to watch
reeeeeeeeed

with the way this team is now in his heyday
crazy
dennis pitta
all these flacco posts lately got me missing the dragon
beyond the most popular choices in lewis reed suggs id probably go with ngata to a certain degree webb
jermaine lewis
torrey smith dude could fly
my favorite all time raven before lamar came into my world was cmac he was an absolute monster some of those seasons 03 he was the best corner in the league i hated the way it ended with him here it was nice to see him do some pep rally stuff last year though
reed would be my first choice but lots of people picked him runner up would be boldin dude made some amazing catches
matt stover i never ever thought at the time we could have a better kicker in the future but man oh man stover was the only offense on this team for a long time
ray reed suggs obviously

but also q jacoby and torrey pitta flacco ngata mcclain vonta and more

there have been a lot of damn good players on this team
throwback choice just cuz i wanted to go a different route then everyone else

jarret fucking johnson

never a splashy guy but always doing his job and always in position miss you jj
ray lewis it was like going to church
the greatest trio of ray ed and suggs
i feel like you should just say exclude ray and ed because those are all time nfl greats who doesnt miss watching them outside of tbose two i miss suggs especially when steelers week comes around and anquan

absolutely love it i want that one
thats amazing

zero out of ten for timeliness of post and creativity of content

this is really a repost bc i posted late last night asking if anyone wanted to start a quick fantasy league among the great people in this sub i remember seeing something about exactly this a while back and have no idea if anything came about that

i have two people who responded to my post from last night so i need at least a couple more aiming for at least 6 or whatever the minimum number is for a traditional draft

come join
what site
which site when is the draft and standard categories or ppr
im down if its on espn
ill join if theres room
ill join
started a reddit group chat with you guys and two guys from another post of mine

the narrator here sounds like dave chappelle playing clayton bigsby
thats all lmao
hehe the browns move finally makes sense
how much would it cost to fill a section of mt with pictures of cartmans mom
ol dirty beckham
obmj
i just want the best of peters trash talker rn
hes only played for two teams who opponents shit on every week


honestly so true
does anyone actually argue in good faith hes a bust or just point out that he hasnt played well in the playoffs yet i dont think those are the same arguments
home playoff game

point stands but nobody is slighting lamar for not winning a sb

also we dont focus enough on the fact that last year was his first full season
if josh allen loses the first playoff game he has this season will he get the same hate as lamar
for real does nobody remember peyton manning early in his career
man went 142 in his first full season and led us to the number one seed who could possibly say he is a bust
im hip it pisses me off literally no one has this much pressure to win a fucking playoff game than lamar any argument against lamar is invalid and biased af hes not the best qb in the league but people expect him to play like one like what
big facts
speak for yourselfsas they hate in him for no reason like speak for yourself had a segment where they said is it super bowl or bust and they all said bust like chill out hes 23
worst part about this season after last years game against the titans the ravens could go 160 but no one will care until we win in the playoffs
legit played 2 play off games in 15 seasons and people hate his record is 204 2 loses in playoffs and hes a bust many qbs have not even made playoffs dalton has never won one in his career anytime someone hates lj i know they cry themselves to sleep at night
people call lamar a bust im a chiefs fan but that boy is good
whos calling lamar overrated we need to strap them to a chair and hook there eyelids open and make them watch last seasons film
sounds about white
nobody thinks lamar is an overrated bust and if the do they dont know football
if i had to guess folks are salty about that titans loss at home but damn his record and stats are still
bruh nobody says this calm down
to be fair people said the same thing about peyton manning when he threw 1000 ints his rookie season
no one is saying lamar is a bust right now hes on the cover of madden ffs this victim complex is boring
be careful with those mobile qbs a couple of clean shots from nfl defenders will change anyones game plan for good cam wasnt the same after his mvp season thanks to the broncos d in the first game the year after
so ima season holder i know in july they announce cancellationrefunds etc and that they may allow up to 14000 fans is there any more info on that like to get single game tickets think they mentioned season seat holders would have preference how when theres more ticket holders than available seats
no fans for first few games
wonder if we can do a massive tailgate outside of the stadium to lend our voices thisnmight be counter productive tho



what did blocks did u use
beast

this made me chuckle well done
the only hard hit i remember from last year was when boyle blew the block along the sideline
its always funny when people say just keep hitting him he wont run anymore like yea thats the hard part you cant hit what you cant catch

bruh this is just an oakley ad as far as i know hes not allowed to wear any tinted visors on gameday
this is an ad
he cant wear the training camp one during games no player has ever been allowed to


i love the bank but it is a little nondescript compared to some other stadiums

like look at how absolutely beautiful camden yards is the bank is my 2nd home but its not exactly very special to anyone who doesnt already love the ravens
this is fine with me rather have a great atmosphere in a basic stadium than a basic crowd in a great stadium
yeah probably theres nothing that outstanding about it
theres nothing wrong with the bank and if anything the ravens should be commended for extending its life with all the recent upgrades theyve been making to it

its only fault is that its old it actually kind of blows my mind that its the 10th oldest stadium in the league right now and its only 22 years old and was built before the stadium arms race kicked off in the midtolate 2000s

at any rate we have one of the most exciting stacked teams in the league led by a generational talent at qb we dont need gimmicky stadiums when the product on the field is so good
mt bank construction cost not including renovations 220 million dollars

allegiant stadium number one in this list 184 billion dollars

sofi stadium 5 billion dollars

looking at the numbers im good with the bank for however long they want to continue upgrading it new football stadiums are just so absurdly expensive

i fear what will happen if bisciotti dies or sells the team but hopefully that wont be for a long time
stadium 6510 home advantage 9510
my dad and i went to the ravens vs falcons a few years ago and their stadium is an otherworldly experience
seems about right if its just about the building itself
we have the best stadium in the division at least but yeah
i had a decent experience when i went to the bank the stadium was what youd expect though it wasnt special or unique
seems ok to me been driving by it every night on the way to work and every morning on the way home for like the last ten years lol

if odell wanted to be shat on he could have just waited till sunday against marlon

who is this

apunter you say yeah we dont need one of those
i love koch
goat
need this so bad
remember that super bowl scramble in the endzone unfff epic koch
opinion sam koch is every bit the rock star goat at his position that justin tucker is
im starting my training now to be able to handle 6 wildcard games in 2 days between pregame shows post game shows and the games we could looking at 32 hours over two days
so fucking excited

why is there only a 18 yard window for mid range touchdowns

do special teams tds count

longest td should be 119 2050 51 or something that gives the shortest tds the smallest range and the longest tds the largest range its called the red zone for a reason to have the shortest range end 5 yards outside of the red zone seems weird maybe even 115 1640 and 41 i dont know the distribution of nfl touchdowns by yardage but 125 and 45 seems completely arbitrary

been running this for 5 years now usually see more than 5000 predictions from fans from all 32 teams and get some interesting information out of it here is last years preseason prediction survey

in 2016 the cowboys had the highest homer bias score 68 and the seahawks followed closely with a 65 bias score as the rest of the league was on the cardinal bandwagon both won their divisions

in 2017 i poked fun at the jags bills and rams fan bases all of whom had 70 bias scores calling them delusional many were huge underdogs coming into the year i was left eating crow as they all made the playoffs

i cannot find any reference to this in 2018 but i know i did one

in 2019 the titans scored the highest homer bias score ever of 80 and vikings came in second with 75 while neither won their division both over performed in the playoffs
this will be very interesting to go back to mate im a ravens fan and have backed them to win only a little fan bias there ha ha but there are some absolutely fascinating match ups and scenarios to play out this year again thanks for putting this together very slick


i know it hurts but its very unlikely we keep all of our young core lamar is probably the only one guaranteed to get his next contract
if we can somehow keep the big 3 lamar stanley humphrey we should be in good shape for years to come
if andrews expects to reset the tight end market hes sorely mistaken the gap between kittlekelce and the rest is pretty pronounced if he wants money to reset the market i say the ravens make the hard decision in letting him walk because we are a tight end factory anyways
i think it ends up being closer to 35 for lamar 18 for humphrey 22 for stanley and 1012 for andrews no way he gets 15 mil per year
i know this seems heartbreaking but this could more doable than you think

in 2022 after the covid dust has settled we can expect the cap will be a fair bit higher than the current figure of 198m maybe 2021 takes a step back or experiences no increase but when we get into the meat of these big contracts in 20222023 lets assume the cap is up to 225m

98m for our big 4 contracts divided by 225m 43 and this is assuming totally flat contracts they will naturally be at least a little bit backloaded to account for increasing cap the actually would likely be more like 375ish

currently our top 4 cap hits judon peters b will stanley 30 of our cap

so 30 with most of our impact players on rookie deals vs 37540 if we pay our top guys seems like a reasonable shift im too lazy to look but im guessing plenty of teams with veteran qbs are in that 3540 range

if we just negotiate the best deals possible spend the rest of the money very carefully and continue to draft well we can totally do it
lj stanley and hump are the only ones id bet that are getting resigned


andrews and hollywood would be a tier down


the ones id be shocked if we resigned in 13 years are peters orlando brown judon brandon williams and ingram for various reasons

he better take a shit on obj first
watching the bills pay a better player less money and now knowing well have to bite the bullet sucks heres to hoping the combination of marlons love for the team and his smaller ego help us get a more reasonable amount

id love to see him play his whole career with us but if contracts like this and mosleys are out there it doesnt look so promising

i thought this was the church of lamar
theres already rbeleers
go on
apologies if this is the wrong place for this please redirect me if im being dumb the wiki is very outdated re nyc bars

1 horsebox is closed looks permanent
2 is mustang harrys showing games outside tried calling and cant tell if theyre open or not
3 have also heard jojos philosophy central bar may be options curious if folks have heard anything about the potential for watching outside there or elsewhere this season
4 big truzz
really hoping horsebox aint closed for good just moved to manhattan last year and absolutely loved going out there for ravens games my friend said she she saw a for rent sign in front of it recently which isnt a great sign

im just planning to watch at home because i dont know of any other ravens bars in the area but if anyone can shed light about those other spots might have to check it out later this season
whats up fellow new yorker and ravens fan checking in here hoping there is still some kind of way for us to root together safely
update kent ale house just told me via phone that theyll have outdoor tables and all the games on sourced the spot from an old post in the nyc fans of baltimore ravens facebook group no giants game till monday night so may be easier to get a table etc ill be in a babyshitbrown lamar jersey if it works it works come say whats up
hey guys i thought it would be cool if we had a post every friday about exciting position battles that will be happening with each weekly opponent for example odell marlo miles garret stanley etc it could be cool to see each players stats what they are good at and their weightheight comparisons

x200b

i thought it would be a fun idea but to be honest im not sure if i have the time or football knowledge to even create such a post maybe a few sub regulars can recommend someone to help create these

x200b

what do you guys think thought it would be something exciting to look forward to each week

thanks
im excited to see baker mayfield vs chuck clark supposedly kevin stefanski has implemented a new offensive system that simplifies reads for him to make it run faster looking forward to watching clark try to crack it
good idea for a weekly thread

i think the matchups im most excited for are

hollywood vs denzel ward can hollywood popoff in his first game back huge hopes for him this year

front 7 vs browns run game browns have a great rungame i feel pretty confident well win the game in the end but the performance of wolfe campbell and williams back at nose tackle will be fun to watch very curious to see how our revamped run defense will hold up patrick queen as well of course
im most interested in our lbs vs their tes njoku and hooper vs a lj forte and queen rookie i think that their wrs are talented enough to limit our dbs helping the short passes that should test our lb corps
stanley vs garrett is a big one

ahhhh im so amped for the season to finally be here
why does this look like a miniature lmao
this is dope he looks like an action figure
what is this an mvp for ants
is there anywhere selling that jersey id love one or twenty
has anyone made a really sweet looking printable schedule that i can hang on my wall this season thanks
i just use the one from the official homepage direct pdf link

nobody says that while mentioning he did that while sitting on the bench for a game as well as several 4th quarters
this is quite friendly thank you
not bad for a throw run guy
this is thank you
this is quite lamar thank you
this is quite a reminder thank you
he did this in his 1st full year as qb sky is the fucking limit sorry that didnt come off as friendly
but hes 02
yessir
ill drink a cold beer to this
lamarkable ian eagle
guys i found out something interesting

in 16 years of football big bens highest total passing touchdowns was 34 tds

in lamars first full season he threw 36 pretty neat right
another reminder that lamar threw for more tds and less ints than tom brady as well
this
this is quite an accomplishment
this does put a smile on my face
im getting very friendly vibes from this post thanks op
wh0a
not bad for a running back
and the fact the 2019 team set the record for most rushing yards ever and lamar still had the most tds lol
when their afraid of your run it leaves the passing tds wide open
the hell did everyone here just read the ringer article
cue the mahomies lol
who were you you magnificent bastard
idk if this season is ready for him
fuck yeah i am itll be posted on sat 9 pst on time belee dat
shit after making us a laughingstock he better be

edit whats wrong with what i said his post is the reason a lot of us got clowned
fuck that guy
thats my fucking qb
could have left out the chiefs bit but im with you 193 is my qb goat
hot take we can go 97 but if we beat the chiefs well be in the super bowl
but has lamar ever won on a wednesday afternoon in mexico didnt think so
hes 203 bc he went 71 and 132 rg3 started vs steelers
just here to remind you all that hes 02 in the playoffs

counterpoint jackson lamar

mvp
i concur
lamar jackson
lamar jackson
from now on all caps when you spell the mans name i was think is suiting for him on this sub
best eva

in harbaughs name amen
if any teams fans are not optimistic and excited at this time of year whats the point but taking off from where the ravens were last year with all they added in between how can you not believe this team was built to kill it and they are so much fun too lets take it further
and pray for healthy players
i dont know why but i just dont have much excitement for football this year i just dont really care

tight

letting cj walk is looking like the right move between injuries last year and opting out this year guy is flat out not worth 17m per year to a team that develops lbs well we have too many high cost positions to lock up in the next 23 years to throw that money around
queen is made for what most people think lbs are going to have to be in the future which is essentially coverage first players in the middle of the field harrison is probably better suited to the physical game so it should be good to have both

the mosley thing i disagree with i think weve built a stronger team by spreading out that money to guys like peters and campbell
is this a hunch or do you have a reason for thinking that also letting cj walk was 100 the right move if we paid him we wouldnt be able to pay humph and stanley i loved cj but you dont pay an ilb that kind of money
we start two inside linebackers and their skill sets compliment eachother perfectly i could not disagree with you more on all counts cj mosley is definitely not worth 17 mil a year when we need to pay lamar hump stanley andrews hollywood orlando etc
letting cj walk was ultimately the right decision i think he wanted bobby wagner luke keuchly money while not being anywhere near them as for the draft were weak as hell at lb and its way important to stack talent and depth there compared to te if both malik and queen pan out theyll probably play together anyways
you should tweet this at jeff zrebiec and have him call this take stupid
really cj mosley got us into the playoffs in 2018
harrison was certainly a safer pick than queen but queens ceiling is significantly higher than harrisons based on his performances in the sec championship and cfb playoff games which is why he went so much higher its a completely different situation to hurstandrews there was basically no consensus on the 2018 te class and plenty of people had goedert andrews or gesicki as te1 that year but almost nobody had anyone except simmons and sometimes murray over queen this year
well we got the better end of mosley leaving hes barely seen the field since he left

i disagree with you on queen and harrison but i guess time will tell
i think a lot of people dont realize how good queen is the dude is a stud the next great ravens defensive player
we couldnt pay cj that much sadly im sure it was bittersweet for him now we just pick him up in a year or 2
i sorta agree i think queen is a project player harrison is more pro ready
i agree leek was an absolute steal i saw him play live his instincts were crazy good and he was a student of the game on the sideline

gotta use the original not the ttg one
is there a link

also id like to add art modell was the best thing that ever happened to that garbage franchise and terrible city and the more you blame him for your losing culture the sweeter the art tag looks on our second superbowl jersies
i also find it hilarious that the steelers and other franchises stuck up for cleveland when art wanted to move the team but pittsburgh and the rest of the league was radio fucking silent when irsay ran out of town in the middle of the night in a blizzard literally lied to everyone on local news im not moving the damn team a team with 3 nfl titles and 1 super bowl victory vanishes overnight literally nobody outside of baltimore cared when it happened why should we care about clevelands announced move not to mention the whole 12 year wait vs 3 year wait thing

commissioner tagliabue came to the negotiating table and helped cleveland as opposed to comissioner rozelle who approved the colts move without question rozelle later wrote in his autobiography that it was the worst decision he made as commissioner

baltimore and cleveland both filed imminent domain lawsuits to keep their teams history when moves were announced you can figure out on your own which city got screwed and which city got to keep their history

the colts used johnny u and footage of baltimore in their uniform release video a couple months ago and switched to the old number font and horseshoe worn in baltimore when did we wear browns unis oh thats right never

we are still being slapped in the face with the colts move to this very day while cleveland owns their history outright the baltimore colts history is locked behind an indianapolis vault and we will never get it back cleveland fans need to stop crying youre lucky you even have a team
pin this shit mods
after the latest odell beckham news i think a more appropriate name would be the cleveland steamers
i go into every season feeling indifferent about the browns theyre honestly so pathetic year in and year out that i cant hate them

but then they get odell my favorite player in the nfl before lamar joined us and i had to sit there watching baker constantly overthrowing and playing like shit then they had their only good game of the year against us and treated it like the super bowl

i cant think of a city more deserving of the browns than cleveland im so glad that no matter what ill be able to tell my kids about ravens super bowls even if they never win another in my lifetime something a browns fan likely wont see i dont know what it would be like to tell my kid we picked top 10 every season
theyve stepped on rakes with firstrounder after firstrounder
i approved this reminder
hell yeah baby i have a special kind of hatred for browns fans i wish them absolutely nothing but their continued misery for as long as they exist they celebrate pissing on a mans grave
see yall sunday

ps i love the ravens i just love shit talking
im feeling really rude today so lets just say it we here in baltimore with the colts leaving are like when your girlfriend breaks up with you so you go out and find a nicer smarter hotter more successful girlfriend the browns over there are the exboyfriend who lingers around the exgirlfriends life keeps on reminiscing about what could have been while she has definitely moved on and eventually gets a new girlfriend who is definitely not an improvement
ive always said that if cleveland does make a super bowl run it will be the most unimpressive thing ever like youve had how many top 5 draft picks in the last few decades the nfl is almost designed to gift you a lombardi at this point but they still lose
this is the way
in life its important to carefully consider your opinions examine your biases and do your best to understand the viewpoints of others however sports are supposed to be about fun and blind indulgence of emotion

in conclusion fuck the browns and their fans forever im glad their team left art modell was glad the team left every player who has ever suited up for the ravens is glad that team left
guys that shit was 20 years ago who gives a fuck half the people on this sub werent even alive before the ravens existed as a team

but fuck the browns caw caw lets go muhfuckers
cleveland clowns
and me the only bucs fan lurking most likely
ive always been a fan of drew careys you can now officially shut up speech at the browns home opener after they returned to the league

they got a brand new team and you could already hear the frustration in his voice
i just want to say that i love the browns i love the browns so much that i also love the ravens no animosity for the past thats dead

ps i also like the bengals those craptacular rascals
but i hate pittsburgh i hate the penguins the steelers the pirates i dislike that black and yellow color scheme so much i dont even like the iowa hawkeyes
this is a legendary post

i try to be more diplomatic

we took your old shit team and turned it into a champion if you dont fix your house someone might do it again with your new shit team
my response to a browns fan complaining to me about the ravens is oh are you mad because it was unfair baltimore had to give up their illustrious history and dope uniforms but you were forced to keep your dogst colors id be mad too
one word brilliant
the cleveland steamers
friendly reminder that the team we stole was objectively bad

they were below 500 when the move was announced only one of the teams they beat had a winning record the teams they lost to werent worldbeaters either106 det 106 buf 79 hou 610 ne 412 jax so they couldnt even beat bad teams they were mediocre atbest in nearly every statistic at that point too bottom five scoring offense bottom 12 scoring defense bottom five in yards allowed bottom 12 in thirddown conversion rate worst third down rate allowed on defense i can go on

the 95 browns were plain bad and those were the real belichick browns not the 115 94 browns the teams they beat in 1994 were 79 onaverage and the teams they lost to were 106 onaverage the 1994 team wasnt good it was mediocre and got an inflated record courtesy of getting four games against the bengals and oilers two teams who won a combined five games and drafted 1 and 3 it wouldve been 1 and 2 if not for the expansion jaguars

pretending that the team wouldve followed the exact same trajectory just a little further northwest if they had never left cleveland is nonsensical maybe marchibroda goes to cleveland but given the part his old baltimore connection played in the fit i doubt that billick probably wouldnt have given he was their top choice in 1999 and he turned them down its not like he was snubbing them to join a powerhouse either we were 610 in 1998 he specifically didnt want to be in cleveland and that 2000 team doesnt happen without billick sure you have ozzie but that team can be as talented as you want it and it doesnt matter a bit if you have a bad coach

the stolen glory narrative is bs cooked up by people who without football for three years had nothing to distract themselves from the depressing reality that is living in cleveland let them have it theyre not worth the effort of convincing otherwise
week 1 is going to such a fucking good game see ya there ratbirds
we need the pic of art holding the lombardi in here as well maybe on gameday
wow this is mean
art totally fucked them over but who cares fuck cleveland its funnier that way
good to see ravens fans are classy as always
for a team that went 142 last year you guys sure do think about the browns a lot
fuck art modell

removed

ah shit here we go again

lets fucking go fuck the browns
i really want to see what the shiny new d looks like against chubb
butbut i have chubb in fantasy
see ya there

at some point this isnt just a meme anymore this is honestly pretty hilarious
is it even a meme if its 100 accurate at this point
fuckin lol
wow good luck to the rest of the afc east youre gonna need it
the new york ravens
who woulda guessed lol
humble brag to when i almost predicted this when he was released
of course he does
this is getting a little weird tbh
of course lol
its like a meme inside a meme
of course he ends up with the jets was there ever any doubt
its only right
honestly im thinking the jets personnel must be terrible if our cast offs are getting practice spots and playing time whos scouting over there and why havent they be fired

i still get ptsd flashbacks to the london jags game
building on a great 2019 season the ravens can almost sweep the afc with a chance to have a win against all but the chargers they will also have an opportunity to save an abysmal 2016 season that resulted in 3 losses to nfc east teams a potential 2020 record of 265 is amongst the best in the league

heres a link to the original post on rnfl

2019 record 2011

wut
cant believe the football team beat us last time
kings of the afc alot of the rest is just because we havent played them in a while

ravens north
jfc its really absurd how many ex ravens they have the new york sloppy seconds
knowing how bad their wr group is he can probably be a starter up there
and so the cycle is complete
of course the jets signed him
of course lol
theyve got jaleel scott
hold onto something and brace yourselves the leagues fucked tbh

proj 226

lamar literally didnt hit below 25 all last year but whatever
how did you not get ingram
only other time ive seen someone do this they ended up 013 but best of luck to you
trade for ingram also someone in my league did this last year and it wasnt the worst
it is bold to be playing pollard when the cowboys are probably going to be throwing the ball with all those wideouts and with zeke taking goaline snaps but i guess he could help in a ppr league
whats the bench look like though
i do this every season i like to see how the team does each week
its my first time doing an nfl draft and drafted 4 or 5 ravens players people in my league said i was dumb but idc cant imagine drafting other players over them
i love you
you maniac lol please post results
bold move
you will be lucky to win a game
thanks for sharing your shitty fantasy team with us


breeshad permian is their 1k receiver just watch
had no idea he played here in iowa at all wow

at this point the jets are basically just that knockoff toy you get at the dollar store
gonna be weird seeing lamar in a green jersey 10 years from now
soyou played on the ravens huh


youre in
mom can we get the ravens

we have the ravens at home


ahhhh yes the new yorkimore jetvens where exravens go to be able to spend their janfeb at home with their families
ravens north
the jets are loading up on old ravens
lol was it bart scott who started this giant migration to the north
why does my most hated team pick up all the players of my favorite team and they always take my favorite players too
remember when phil savage was running the show in cleveland and he took all our castoffs
smh
pretty sure they signed him because another receiver got indicted lol

im a guy from the uk and after watching some shows on netflix wanted to give the nfl a go i selected the ravens as the team ill be supporting watched quite a few of the games from last season

really excited for my first season
every ravens game freaks me out i dont care if we play the worst team in the nfl i still get super nervous
lamar jackson
yesssir
truzzzz
going to work will be awesome if we win but if we lose
been watching the nba so much lately its really its been great but nothing can compare to the nfl here we go again guys being nervous for 17 weeks straight
i am so excited wow
hope youre ready to watch the most exciting player in the league every week big truzz
big truzz fuck the browns
for week 3 well ship yall some burnt ends if yall ship us some crab cakes
lets fucking goooooooooooo
best of luck were prolly gonna get thrashed but im hoping we can at least make it interesting
you can tell lamar is slighted in this pic
on the hoeshe shall stunt
the look in his eyes that day

melts my heart
the best football player weve seen in generations lamar jackson

hey that looks like what well be shoving down your throats tomorrow
rent free lmaoooo

edit he dmd me too so definitely rent free
what is this supposed to be maybe it doesnt work on the phone app good job good effort


theyre making fun of us for our post before the titans game last year where someone said something along those lines
the forth top comment is i hope they dont st the bed lmao
gross
they had one on there about eating birds or something gave me a good laugh this morning
i love the browns fans calling us shit fans lol like were horrible people

fuck ohio you all still support fracking and coal mining you dumb shits
i love this so much nothing better than browns fans talking shit when their reciever wants to get shit on im so happy football is back
of the three ravens chasing there two off the team one playing offense lol
shit fans of the shitty shitcolored shitnamed team with a receiver who likes to be shitted on talking shit

what else is new

homegirl about to get shat upon all afternoon

lmao wtf
im getting so pumped for this game i can feel it in my bowels
lol this is so funny holy shit nice one man
i cant wait to see jimmy vs obj part 3
lmao remember the rnfl thread about this incident people were calling for marlon to be arrested

when the fuck did he sign that helmet before or after his surgery ir
75 to drive to brooklyn isnt worth it to repair the bullet holes in my car

edit people from northern aac know whats up everyone else thinks this is mean brooklyn is a fucking mess lol its about 5 blocks of blue lights and police activity

so unreasonable browns aint scoring 10
looking at how we handle nick chubb tomorrow will tell us a lot about our commitment to stop the run after d henry
whoa whoa whoa still repping madden 20

me too lol
2420 ravens win this one i have ingram andrews and edwards scoring
ill lay it out for you as truthfully and strategically as i can the ravens will struggle tomorrow and come out with a 556 win lamar jackson has another perfect passer rating game with 6 tds thrown and 1 run
anyone else expecting another highlight tape of hollywood catching bombs and going the distance
the browns have a depleted cb group hollywood mandrews are gonna go off i think we start with the pass to set up the run
my prediction was 4214 ravens win lamar gets 4 passing 1 rushing tds
690 5 for lamar 3 for rg3 and 2 for tmac

koch tuck succesfully go for 2 on the last td but the play is ultimately deemed null due to an illegal block in the back by ravens team mascot poe
no theres no way we are scoring that much sorry

2414 ravens
hi all with chris moore and justice hill out for the game how big of an impact will this have on our st unit
moore was good at downing balls on punts deep in the opponents territory but id imagine some of the young players step up to fill that role maybe proche hill i dont think will be missed as much you also have to remember harbaugh was a special teams coach and we have tucker cox and koch who will for sure do their parts
maybe a slight impact on punt coverage as most of the kickoffs go out of the end zone now
im working on one and i wish i could get some feedback on whether or not its hq enough and if im being too pointed i dont have any super premium tools or editing experience so i dont know if joining in will help represent or lower the quality and make us look bad
if john harbaugh were here because hes everybodys dad he would say trust yourself im sure whatever you will come up with will be great
im sure itll be quality if you want pm the gif to some people if you want feedback
dude you got a post to the top of our sub so im stalking your profile looking for dirt of course you should post are people going to talk shit on the quality yes its going to get torn to shreds do they really mean it or should you care no gif wars online are one of the funniest purely entertainmentdriven phenomenon ive ever witnessed anyone who shows real anger over a gif or admonishes someone for not being a pro animator is a piece of shit anyway being a part of a stupid subreddit rivalry instead of just commenting makes it that much better so who cares if its not going to win an oscar ive had gifs flop a couple times but ive never considered not posting
im just stocking up on popcorn go get em

bro the mo in gold is such a col touch for the end zones
poevid the covidcorvid
did they build him the nest in the mos rows
the funny thing is the plague mask looks like a raven
frosted flakes
fuckin hell i read that title as everyones favorite covid
kinda wish we made a head for poe that was a plague doctor mask to wear during this season

i think shes messing with you by making ome of them steelers colors
am i being bucked i just see an imgur banner
bet you could fit a beer in the purple mug

found this in my fb feed this morning i thought they were tracking me and knew everything about me fuck their ai trolling me
and intercepting my boy vince young on top of that mother fuckers
2019 5910 over the dolphins
2018 473 over the bills
2017 200 over the bengals
i wouldnt be too hopeful for this we normally have a really good preseason that smoothes in a lot of starters already i always feel like we are more ready for a season then others and we dont have that this year
this reminded me about 2017 the year of the shut outs that was a crazy year shut out 3 teams but then the jags put up 44 on us
dont jinx us
were 93 in week 1 under harbaugh outscoring opponents 339174
mega jinx incoming
jess


odell the type of dude to order the poopoo platter at the chinese restaurant
oh no lol
im a browns fan and this is hilarious
oh hell nah

yea i respect it lol thats how i feel about mahomes and the chiefs
i dunno i think the guy who tried to do a flip off a patio table and landed on his head is my favorite browns fan

found it
perhaps i have treated you too harshly
in all fairness coolest browns fan is an outrageously low bar
based browns fan based browns fan
i dunno no browns fans should be truzzed
nah coolest browns fan is the guy that did the writeup for the ravens players in the rnfl top 100
browns fans arent even that bad anymore tbh they were obnoxious last offseason but im not trippin about it now
sad that that constitutes a cool fan
what a gentleman
he gets it
nah he just has him in his fantasy team
haha they mean in a safe myles garrett isnt banned again way

time to flex on these hoes
coolest browns fan

thats like winning an award for the best tasting piece of poop
what is going on seems to be a few wholesome and respectable browns fans coming out of nowhere



holy shit i am so fucking excited for this game
i just saw that the down vote icon on the browns sub is a ravens logo

he will probably be a gunner in place of moore right
per transaction wire ravens promote db jordan richards from practice squad to active roster for sunday have option of activating two players chose just richards it appears why not just activate two can only be done with any player twice without exposing him to waivers
expected move especially with chris moore recovering
im just here to boast that i recently called this during a thread discussion about the potential callups to the active roster

i am considering between the black gaiter and the black polyester mask same price both on nflshop website has anyone got either of these or even both and can recommend one
ive heard that from a medical standpoint the gaiters may not be as effective but that was from a single story i heard on tv a few weeks back so i dont know how accurate that is
as an alternative option i got a regular fabric one from etsy for around 10 there are a lot of different options
i ordered the 3 mask set a week ago had 2 day shipping label on it and after i ordered it i got a message saying it would arrive october 8th so dont expect them very fast

obj to marlon inbox tonight so uhh you gonna be with judon before the game tomorrow
odel stevie beckham
hes our 2 receiver at least get that right
hes wr 2
the long wait is over time to spread our wings all over the world and dominate again
hmmm premature
op is a pedophile see all of his comments defending cuties going to rewatch your kiddie porn after the ravens game

dude i want the shirt this guy is wearing so bad anyone know where i can find it i tried googling around and didnt come up with it
im liking your content already dude its john harbaugh whos our bomb ass coach jim is good too
state of the ravens as steady as a solid state drive of several terrabytes fast furious and unshakable
did anyone order a cutout on here i was wondering if you have received this code that the website said they were sending out to show where your cutout is sitting
i also havent heard anything yet
lifetime ravens fan here ive always closely followed the team but this year with quarantinegraduationstarting a real job i havent kept up with the team through the offseason why do i need to know going into tomorrow
to fuck the steelers and expect some new starters on our defense highlighted by calais campbell elliot and wolfe earl isnt with the team anymore yanda retired and hollywood is healthy

caw caw mother fuckers
marlon well be reuniting with his son odell
fuck the steelers fuck the browns and odel likes to eat shit
earl thomas was almost tolerated
you should know that as always the browns are shit given this fact dont be surprised if you see obj rolling around on his teammates
cheer loud stand proud

id rather we go 115 and win the sb than go 160 and lose in the postseason
of course while 160 is a possibility im like 99 sure were gonna lose at least 1 game due to complete sheer luck another close one and a 3rd where we just play like ass to finish 133

lmao my older brother is also a cowboys fan i always love busting his chops about them too hes a great sport about it and honestly i got into football because of him people love shitting on cowboys fans but all the ones ive come across irl are really chill and fun people to talk football with i have a soft spot for the cowboys because i grew up watching woodson smith and aikman and idolized those guys as a kid he was the one that told me about ray lewis and ever since 1998 i started watching ravens football and got hooked
this is great content smells like truzzmas already cant wait lets goooo
my brother is a cowboys fan too
and to all a good night
belee dat
a quote from my high school coach he played for the baltimore colts
i have the ravens defense and lamar jackson for my fantasy team you guys think thats a good choice whats the word on the ravens defense respect
this little stag bar in dundalk had a few old colts pouring drinks and sitting around dying

your job playing football is to hit the other guy so hard he cant remember his mothers face failing that try to make it so he never walks straight again

i miss those guys watching pop warner games between the falcons and the packerstheyll never be the dundalk dynasty to me you fuckers

lol this is getting outta hand
howdy ho


view poll
the fuck is the weed option sir
other have some beers watch highlight videos and tug one or two out

im in ca so i have to wake up before 10am to find a stream the sooner i go to sleep the sooner santa brings kickoff
quite well i am sure
bowling ball
i literally didnt sleep last night dont think it was a direct result of the game this happens about 12 times a month for me but the excitement didnt help
add deep breathing

i miss this meme so much
update this with shades lamar
ill be tuning in from dubai
we just gotta own this meme now i definitely plan on telling all the fans that made fun of us for losing that they just got stunted on every time we whoop somebodys ass this season
this is my favorite video that captures the essence of the ravens browns relationship
this image is cursed now
its almost time
yes yes yes yes yes
not gonna lie this one is cringe

all i can think about is the on these hoes we shall stunt post right before we got embarrassed by the titans

does anyone know where to watch the game out of state also i think the nfl would make a killing if the sold each game as a payperview like service the nfl sunday ticket is way to much

this stopped hitting after i saw a picture of lamars head edited on crying to a picture of derrick henry in one of the 1000 times this offseason the ravens stunt on these hoes copypasta got reposted

maybe we need a new meme just a thought
cant fucking sleep too pumped

dont use a dead kid to get attention on reddit bad form

yes we know anything is possible this is a bad and useless comparison though sorry fam
man outta all the people you compare lamar to from the nba its russell fucking westbrook the dude who was getting cooked left and right by alex caruso and kyle kuzma all series long this year the guy who hasnt made the 2nd round of the playoffs without durant since 2016 when the made the wcf to choke away a 31 lead its an embarrassment to be compared to russell westbrook

this mp4 version is 7462 smaller than the gif 306 mb vs 1206 mb



beep im a bot faq author source v112


video

well duh lamars breaking the shit out of defenders ankles
fun fact mike tanier the author was joe flaccos math teacher


caw caw mother fuckers

jimmy in mid season form
already damn
hopefully its just a cold muscle sort of thing and not an injury under the surface
concerns me cleveland has two very good tight ends
here we go again
standard
i dont think ive ever seen this before injury report on the morning of a game i doubt he plays honestly
just put him on the pup list see ya week 7 jimmy

its not the football season without jimmy being hurt
this is not ideal who the fuck would we have play dime safety
we usually get him at least the first quarter of week 1 until week 9 this is a new one
our defense is noticeably so much better when jimmy is healthy really hope this is a precaution and not something more serious
god fucking damnit
new update says he is out on the field testing himself out and he was seen smiling with the coaches afterward i think he plays
ive had back spasms before and i can say that jimmy is not playing today with a good amount of confidence ive had countless injuries throughout my life and the back spasms were the absolute most painful thing ever
ah shit
and so it begins

x200b

ps we dont need no stinkin carr
we could see a lot of double a no not arn anderson today in other words the receivers may be blanketed in coverage but theyll still be completing passes over him because he seems to lack ball skills every time i watch him it wont be tony jefferson in 23 getting burned this season but instead it might be anthony averett amid his third number change in as many years previously 28 34 respectively i really hope he has improved in the awareness area of his game since he otherwise appears to have all the necessary tools to be good
this is precisely why they should have still brought back brandon carr you know its a given that you cannot count on jimmy smith lasting through an entire season until today tavon deshon have actually never even played together in a regular season game how long before several more of the perennially injured dbs eg the aforementioned pair plus averett are unavailable but hey why sign a guy who has never missed a game in his career when we can have a bunch of injuryprone players at the db positions
i also saw geno stone inactive who dafuck do we have for depth for fs
hes active
hate to hear this but thankfully its the browns and not chiefs i want a healthy jimmy sit a game if you need it

1 lamar
2 will
3 stunt
4 on these
5 hoes

check
the baltimore ravens will win if they score more points than the cleveland browns
so the boxes are

1 stop the run

2 get first downs

3 get turnovers

4 avoid sacks

5 avoid turnovers

hot damn i think they solved it guys if we do this every week we could go 190 this year
i want the baltimore ravens to win today
i too would find it most acquiescable if the baltimore ravens were to reign victorious in todays match
lamar jackson will be the ravens quarterback today
samsies
yes
i would also like it very much if we won today
i want the cleveland browns to loseand i also want the blertimore footbirds to win as well
when the baltimore ravens win so do i
no shit though the league shouldnt even be playing because of the pandemic


karma farm much

darth lamaul
shoulda made the saber color purple
questionable with back spasms
lmao he didnt choose to be injured
maybe he will still play
yeah jimmy how did you let your back spasm

because thats totally how it works
no he is gonna have this problem all year
the trainers will know how to handle it our secondary will be fine either way
this has been a thing since his rookie year and apparently even in college at this point i dont think he can really do anything about it
if this happens i will be pleased and i may even say yes that is good
how could you say something so controversial yet so brave
sure would be terrible if the ravens did that twice but the browns kicked 5 fgs
do the things score the pointssports
mood
i am pleased with what i see so far
when i see the ravens score football points i say yes

when i see the browns score football points i say no
many many times

sees opponent in ff has mark ingram

except for him

love you mark but lamar andrews and marquise scoring them would make me happy
i have a bet with a steelers fan for best season record loser is servant for the day i know my boys in purple wont let me loose this bet
tugs braid agreed
this would be cool tbh
marlon fucks sake

he is the next aaron rodgers

now open for hot takes
most likely buck allen
im guessing ingram
wouldnt be shocked if its sonsy
edc he earned it
earl thomas iii
calais

love the purple and white combo
im sure the boomers on facebook are having a field day with this one
you guys should blow out the browns it will be 3114
its amazing how much things can change in a year last year i got downvoted to hell for pointing out that hayden hurst was racist af on twitter now hes off the team and were all mostly finally opposed to racism

raven fan from california
i dont get this someone kindly explain wheres the avacado

big trussssss lil zack kitty lol
thats a football face if i ever saw one


lamar jackson
ive always had a man crush on lamar lol
lamar jackson
in the flesh

this logo isnt cursed
these look amazing
we dont talk about cakes here

this seasons for mo
thoughts and prayers are always with you guys
i want lamar to stand in the middle of the o while celebrating a td
i love this so much and honestly would love for our endzones to stay that way forever
i hope the first raven who scores in that end zone does something in tribute of mo cant wait for this game
you guys are also doing the fan cutouts lol i thought that was just a weird thing us bengals where doing
i know it cant happen but i hope they keep the gold mo long enough that i have to explain to my grand kids why those two letters are in gold

im a sports radio junkie and man his passing hit me hard and i never even metsaw him
for moooo
when did that happen


hey yall moved out of maryland sad at the end of march took for granted easy access to our ravens

planned on going to a local ravens bar for games but not advised with the pandemic and i have no sunday ticket i see a certain subreddit has been removed that i would utilize in the past

any help for a bird bro today

nflbitecom
which one works best
i live in ct now and i use nflbitescom as my stepping stone to streams every week



reporting in from rhode island
congrats pops thats a good lookin boy ya got there
future te
hell yea brother
yessir ravens all the way
good man keep breeding soldiers for the army of the black feather
thats my nephew
this the type of wholesome content i signed up for
your kid has only known victories so far

i cant wait for marlon vs obj part 3
is it even ravens season without jimmy on the injury report glad to be back boys
hope jimmy rests well we need him week 3
when did madboogy get injured that was a surprise to me
glad to see no surprises here we are leaving safety depth really lacking by having stone inactive though

im going to assume whoever downvoted this picture were obviously steelers fans
i dont know if this is your real hair but if it is its freaking beautiful
im fully expecting to cry when i see the mo in the endzone

still missing mo so hard and hoping hes pumped to see his first ravens game
man i had to read this twice to get what you were saying and oof it hit me right in the feels



yes
well dont fall asleep now
i thought id receive an email with a code or something saying where the cutout i ordered was has anybody heard anything
wondering the same thing i finally got a serial number but no clue where to check frustrating
i havent seen any in the stands i wasnt really looking for them but the stands looked pretty empty

edit yup they are there
i emailed today to see if we could find out where exactly theyll be have you heard any thing
what the hell is this business with cutouts
anyone know where i can stream audio of the game without video ive got a long drive to do today and would like to listen to us dismantle the browns
98 rock app
wbal as well

hollywood fit cleannnnnnnn
matching mask is a great touch
hollywood gon make me act up
lamar 3000 and little boy

otaro alaka szn
honestly the majority of the group i dont feel uneasy about especially vets like campbell and wolfe there

i also see the law firm of harrison queen having a big impact today
gonna be so interesting seeing how the run defense has improved today
pro
til dj fluker is on our team

i wanna see our queen get atleast one sack today
fellow ravens fans i dont have the option of seeing the game today on tv if anyone finds a livestream during the game i would greatly appreciate it now lets go kick the browns to the bottom of the standings go ravens
if youre in the baltimore media area or any other media market where theyre showing the game check out locastorg they stream local tv
nflbitecom
did you find a working one i used the link on the nflbite discord and it worked pretty good had to change to another stream at the start of 3rd quarter

watching red zone as we speak
sportsurgenet has some good streams
nflbitecom
in oklahoma unfortunately i cant watch it


pound the rock and eat some clock

no receivers over 100 but we have 400 total yards of offense mark jk and andrews score tds we win 2717
woke up early excited for the game mowed the grass and did random honeydo items but dang still only 10 am what the heck grab a beer and wait for the ravens game now 6 beers in i am wishing for the game to start


tyre the next marshal yanda phillips
thats a win he must have been really impressive to beat out a proven veteran in fluker
intriguing
nice i think this guy has a real chance at being the best value of the 2020 ravens draft
thats really interesting he must have absolutely crushed it in training camp
we have 5 rookies who have made an impact in the first game think about that

calais campbell is a gift had that super eloquent explanation of why he kneels kneels and signs the anthem tips two passes one leads to an int and gets a big tackle all in the first 15 minutes im in
he protec

he attac

but most of all

calais smak
yo we really just drove 99 yards in the time it took me to microwave easy mac

hayden hurst just made a fantastic diving catch

wishing him the best
love the jt announcer comment

so whens jt in range exactly

i guess when he pulls into the parking lot hes in fg range
idk why you guys are so optimistic

we havent scored all season including any of our preseason games our offense was practically nonexistent
hollywood has been absolutely disgusting this game

like true 1 wr level of disgusting
calais already one of the best ravens of all time
zrebiec marlon humphrey had his helmet back in his hand wasnt in on that last play but seems to be ready to go back in

thank the lord
i think lamar is still mad about 4025
we demand a 160 decibel laugh track in the stadium every time the browns fuck something up
mark andrews is on the same level as kelce and kittle dont me
bruh llamas ability to stop on a dime is insane
in the browns thread they are still saying lamar cant throw lol dont troll there its just fun to observe
anyone else hear still fucking got it lmao
all things considered baker mayfield is actually pretty good for two children in a trenchcoat pretending to be one adult
td confirmed tucker good back to baker bashing
i wonder if theyll let me do that stadium cleaning job in a couple years

baker mayfield on the sideline after the first half
lamar looking like 505 million
decosta is looking like a genius today with dobbins and queen playing great today
holy shit browns sub is in full meltdown mode

lol
ravens are a top 1 organization
10 points off turnovers getting the ball to start the 2nd half ill take it
fully erect fully erect
what a pass to hollywood 46 yards
that pass was beautiful and outside numbers too clearly lamar practiced improving there a lot
clear penalty on judon what a stupid play
99 yards fuck you kyle boller
lol mayfield out there thinking hes lamar
hollywood has such a quiet 100 yards
mark andrews is on pace for 64 tds this season
those 2 plays by calais are setting the tone for the defense early i thinks hes definitely going to be the leader of our defense
im old enough to remember when the ravens were a bust about 30 min ago
dobbins is a free elf
the browns twitter account hasnt tweeted in over an hour
the energy level on peters is insane and contagious
dobby never meant to kill dobby only meant to maim or seriously injure
the best thing about today is lamar just stomped on them for three quarters got a 152 rating but hes gonna be mad at himself for ending the day on two 3 and outs and that is gonna fuel him to keep getting better because thats the level of competitor he is thats my mvp
queen will keep the lb legacy alive for our amazing franchise
the lack of crowd makes it seem like a bengals home game
kickers like seibert make me appreciate tucker even more
how many 4th quarters will lamar miss this year
odell said coach when i said i wanted to get shitted on this is not what i meant
do you dare fuck with john special teams are what i cut my teeth on you ignorant whelps harbaugh
why run a 2 minute offense when you can run a 43 second offense
bowser is having the best game among the edge defenders
the browns will finally put it together this year nflmemes
peters basically fortnite dancing over a crying obj is the best thing to come from this game so far
was that queen hes had a pretty sharp game
dobby is a free elf
calais campbell looks like a huge terrifying baby
this no dan fouts thing is pretty cool man
i sat jk in fantasy ama
i really hope ronnie is just out to be cautious
the fanbases may hate each other but i always like seeing the players themselves being friendly after the game
shout out to the browns sb nation site dawgs by nature

two of their journalists picked the browns to beat the ravens on the road week 1 after losing week 1 gamesfor 15 years in a row
bro you let it roll from the 20
last year lamar looked liked lamar so far this year lamar looks like lamarprime rodgers
i think lamar could legit repeat as mvp god damn hes making this look too easy
the 2x mvp ohhhhh boys its comin
browns fans thought kitchens was the problem lol
calais batting more balls than the os
reminder that the browns took baker first overall and lamar fell to 32
patrick queen is a beauty forced fumble on chubb to setup fret field position and did very good the rest of the game
anyone else just constantly upvoting in the game thread lol
even when the browns do something good they still mess it up
lol they still missed the xp
smart play lamar its okay to be inches short no reason to get blown up
still cant get over the fact that we have all these rbs and we fucking gave it to ricard
99 yard drive friends you just love to see it
patrick queen has 1 sack and is leading the team in tackles so farlooking good
imma be honest lamar looks better then last year and thats fucking insane
need4snead
i have to say i enjoy it when we win going away when we get and stay ahead by a lot

my blood pressure is down
i am nicer to my family when they ask who is winning
i just pet the dog hes a good boy
pq is not playing like a rookie
let sam koch play qb for a series
i hope they show more baker mayfield commercials its his best play
i agree with everyone that there are holes in the defense that i think they could work on but the defense held them to 6 points you cant overlook that
more like kareem cunt

rekt
lamars precision is amazing so far
pay lamar whatever the hell he wants idc
so lamar is still pretty good huh 99 yard td drive and 35 second end of half td drive no biggie

hollywood with over 100 yards at the half lol
glad to see humphrey back on the field regardless of flags tbh
lamars so good man what the hell
fluker is looking solid just let ronnie sit out the rest of the game and get healthy
with no fans lamar is just gonna think every game is in the dolphins stadium and put up 60 every time
patrick queen is the man i am buying his jersey right now and worrying about my finances later
delay of game on 4th and 1 when youre going for it the blunders theyve made today are on brand
harbs the game is over take lamar out just tempting fate rn
even up 386 lamar still pissed when it doesnt work out for 1 drive
cleveland 016 for openers jesus christ
letting rg3 play after lamar puts on an old fashioned ass whopping some things never change
it must suck to have high hopes for the season and expect to show out on opening day only to shit the bed so badly youre playing the other teams backups in the 4th quarter then again if youre the browns youre used to it
its nice to have a lead like this these 4th quarters can serve as preseason games for the rookies and guys that dont start
ravens rookie report jonasshaffer

patrick queen teamhigh nine tackles sacks forced fumble
jk dobbins two rushing tds
tyre phillips starting rg
devin duvernay 32 yards per kick return
malik harrison four tackles one pass defense
i got a medium pizza for the whole afternoon and ive already eaten 75 of it
is calais the best football player ever i swear i have no evidence to the contrary so far
since the titan game i havent tuned into anything football related heart was too broken im ready to heal now
judon is overrated pretty good pass rush but has never done much against the run game
remember that bomb that he threw to hollywood week 1 against the dolphins kinda looked similar thats our guy
too many mistakes guys too many mistakes
anyone else notice how much more active these game threads are compared to the start of the season last year crazy how much bigger this sub got in 1 year
damn queen fell down he woulda murdered baker just now
gotta give odell a pass he got a lot of shit on his chest right now
my dad it would be a nice if they got a field goal before halftime

ravens touchdown

me they like to exceed expectations
lets face it lamar jackson just doesnt have the skill set to become a good nfl qb

they should try him at wide receiver
i can see it now during halftime

boomer ravens are only up by a little baker has him right where he wants them

cowher something something something big ben something
i love fighting with people on facebook who are mad that the ravens kneeled
lamars worked on his passing hes not even to his final form
1583
remember guys everyone solved lamar last year
a lot of shitting on baker today but that graphic from earlier really put it into perspective for me personally 4 head coaches 4 offensive coordinators in 30 games no one succeeds in that situation no one improves in that situation

browns did this to themselves they ruined a qb with a lot of promise
i cannot stress how much ive missed football this sub on gamedays
people actually thought the browns might win can ya believe that
lets go free agent money is paying off early
that was an awfully big truss
i love that lamar seemed content to just throw it away instead of trying to extend too much take the 3 and go up two scores
the no fans shit is gonna be a wet dream for kickers dude
again our outside rush and edge setting is trash

this is why we dont pay judon and go get a real olb who can edge set and pass rush
smart move its ok to be short here
good job getting out of bounds but thats a first down
so far we just look sloppy which is ok i guess considering no preseason however the dline has looked inconsistent at best and needs to get their act together fast
loved everything about that drive dobbins looking fresh and lamar shared the ball with every receiver so awesome
i was just peeking at the browns thread and someone said they could have gone on a 500 yard drive had they wanted to lolol
rivalry through the years but it has been dominated by baltimore hell yeah it has
mark andrews on pace for 64 touch downs this year



dedicating this season to the mario 64 rerelease
i love andrews but i wish boykin would have made that td it was a perfect throw by lamar
cant wait till this team drops 50 on washington i hate washington
browns went from potentially being one score difference in the half to obj dropping a wide open pass missing a field goal and then the ravens proceeding the score a touchdown while getting the ball in the second half

well done browns
yo hollywood is over 100 yards already goddamn son
cheers to a great first half of football everyone
if we think about it browns have one of the most disruptive db duos and lamar is still absolutely melting their defense
takitaki with the tackle tackle lmfao
lol browns fans who said lamar couldnt throw and is 02 in playoffs
everybody complaining about pass rush and we get a huge sack
freddie kitchens is loling right now
hats off to baker for getting his money from commercials if the browns are smart hes not getting a second contract
i know rivalry and fuck the browns and what not but holy shit bakers regression and not living up to any amount of initial draft hype is staggering browns may start looking at drafting a new qb

hes just awful his oline cant even be blamed this time hes just not good at football
patrick queen at 8 tackles 1 sack 1 tfl and now 1 ff i think we made a solid pick truzzzzzzz
rookies look sick great draft
somewhere ray rice nods in his approval
loving this draft class queen and dobbins definitely going to be my first jerseys
i think they are keeping lamar in since there hasnt been any preseason games this year
deshon elliot lost his damn mind
sandusky just said stefanski is not using his timeouts we appreciate that no reason to prolong the obvious
so i like all our rookies
great american comeback

200000 dead and counting millions unemployedcant wait to get the cheeto out of office
browns man whyd cleveland want their team back again
we need to sign tony siragusa back
damn lamar breaking ankles again lmao
holy shit lamar that was bang on
rookie mistake by proche
this is a joke right some sort of procheprank
can we get uancientfrosting6461 banned why is he here
what a catchhhhh good lord credit where credit is due too bad obj didnt do it or wed see that replay every day for the next month
just a good catch cant be mad at that
oof young just got screwed on that catch matched up against a guy a foot taller
lmao i love the waving tube men all over the stadium
69 yards in 35 seconds
notes ravens good browns bad
but is lamar jackson an elite ficus tree in a painted terracotta pot
as a fan whove been following since the dilferwrightboller days i still cant believe the offense i see on a weekly basis now if youre young consider yourself lucky watching the show
imagine if pat didnt fumble the ball it could have been 316
this is the offense that flacco rice q torrey mason pitta heap jamal mcgahee boller all died for

channel their power into one ultimate lj8
peters better have a mic you know hes talking hella shit
so that guy made a onehanded catch 46 years ago and still considered a top wr
these scrubs really love grabbing face masks
marcus peters straight dxing the browns obj really thought he was going anywhere with the browns
harbaugh lookin like a star wars bounty hunter or something
why the hell do they keep facemasking us
best qb in the nfl fight me
lamar is basically micheal jordan
they gona have film on lamar this year
the att girlmy first and only love
quite a debut for ravens firstround rookie patrick queen he has a teamhigh eight tackles a sack and now a forced fumble aaronkazreports
alright boys we got him i love patrick queen
can we just hang 40 on them im tired of the week 4 super bowl making cleveland think they play us tough
jk rolling
ok lets put rgiii in per usual
its always nice when the opposing team loses all hope and just starts running out the clock for us
anyone else reward yourself after ravens game even though we had nothing to do with it like im telling myself i get chipotle tonight
im getting a little upset that lamar is still in the game
god this incredible ljax continuing to shit on teams so hard that the 4th quarter is just irrelevant
to be honest we need to thank the browns at this point for only doing running plays its free training on it
lol wtf elliot is so weird
10

get fucked cleveland
thatll do pig thatll do
cleveland alright weve got them where we want them at the one yard line

lamar you fools you absolute buffoons
calais campbell is an absolute unit even when kneeling
campbell looking like a game wrecker
baker being baker i love it lfg ravens
great to see mayfield in midseason form already
lamar got that ed reed genes
browns d line is top level tough matchup for our young o line chemistry and reps well get there hopefully
our defense is so hit or miss one second i think were the best in the league then the next second im wondering wtf is going on
lamar cant throw
judon u fucking idiot
holy shit queen is lightning speed
shouldve caught that punt rookie
odell is enjoying getting shit on
that drive was pure bliss
dobbins is a free elf

did those assholes really just show jamal in the browns shirzy
did they just show j lew in a cleveland uniform dont ever fucking let me see that again
queen was going to kill his ass stay on your damn feet
such a weird game feels like cleveland is down 3 but i feel like we should be up by 20
this is why i will not tolerate lamar slander
mandrews is the best te in football dont me
patrick queen w 5 tackles and a sack love to see it

harrison got a blocked pass too
nice to see john brown doing well in buffalo
mp juicemane told the homegirl to sit the fuck down
browns players really love grabbing facemasks huh
the browns need to lay off those facemasks thats three today
browns special teams is going to get a talking to after this missed pat missed fg fake punt failed and two facemasks when kicking to baltimore oof
taki taki with a tackle tackle early favorite for best call of the year
the baltimore ravens currently have 69 rushing yards
feeding the snead
lamar came down from a higher league
lamar jackson is my dad
lamar is here to save us from 2020
190 here we come

lets overreact
god damn it feels good to be a ravens fan
mandrews is elite

humphrey is elite

stanley is elite

lamar is elite
my best friend redskins fan bet me 30 the browns would score 30 points against us cant wait to buy chicky tendies with my money
queeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeen
this is the beatdown i needed today patrick queen
i dont want to overreact but queen will be a hofer
queen already way better than peanut
i will say this for baker mayfield it looks like hes lost some weight
jesus lamar dont do that shit to me almost gave me a fucking stroke
master has given dobby a sock

dobby is free
thought lamar got rocked there but 23 destroyed his own team mate
calais is blocking shots like dikembe mutumbo
our offseason additions have played great today were so blessed to go from ozzie to decosta
baker is trash perfect cleveland qb
i sorted the comments on the browns sub by live and found the factory of sadness in to be in perfect working order
stop drinking john and take lamar out
it doesnt make sense man the browns have consistently been garbage but their fans are the loudest shit talkers of any team ive ever seen
looks like the browns player twisted lamars knee on that last tackle
lmao i love hearing the on field chatter
think about this were probably seeing less than 25 of the playbook tonight this is more like a preseason game than anything
you know your team is deep when you cant choose your next jersey

im leaning toward humphrey but jk duvernay dobbins brown boykin have made choice harder
is cleveland just accepting the loss with the runrunpass for the last two drives
mos watching his first ravens game today
shout out to phil simms picking us to go to the super bowl
i live in az calais cambell used to frequent a panera near where i work he looks a lot bigger in person
not dan fouts
ravens games always take a few years off my life due to the stress lmao
was he running toward the mo section
mikemikemikemike

hump dayyyyy
mandrews
hes a man such a mandrews
mark andrews and calais campbell are dudes
i dont think theres enough to overturn this
this shouldnt be a question at all clear td
the most accurate kicker in nfl history

i love that every single time
im fucking laughing hysterically fucking clowns
you know a fake is obvious when a out of shape dumbass like me on a couch can tell its coming
taking bets for cleveland fans to start saying fire stefanski i got before week 3
i just dont understand the process of deciding to fake a puntif you make it you still have to go 60 yards against our defense if you dont make it and we score a td this game is over they got lucky
like stefanski harbs is a special teams coach why would you fake it so early its 3 free points
defense getting manhandled this drive
defense needs to regroup we need an edge setter
they outta review that looked pretty close to a first
im so mad draft heads really looked at his tape with a straight face and said he couldnt throw fuck them seriously
run d needs serious help
this game thread is bipolar some of yall have bigger issues
4th and 41 they should go for it
you have to catch that shit dude
does hollywood look blurry on anyone elses screen
hollywood cooked his corner like toast and got like 8 yards separation
dobbins with the first of many
10 plays 99 yards
ingram is such a great teammate getting hype for a young player in his position
okay so this draft class is looking like one for the books theyre sick
that is just a picture perfect drive holy fuck
lamar bailing out punt returner by marching down 99yds
that drive was like a sitcom intro where every player gets to say hi love seeing everyone get involved
99 yard td drive love to see it
thats cool browns put us at the 1 yard line

just more points for lamar to rake up in fantasy
queen charging in there like a heat seeking missile and knocking himself out in the process lmao
llamas hungry hungry for some goat
anyone know who was the nfl mvp last season
that was such a surgical drive by lamar literally picked them apart
hollywood already with 101 yards in the 1st half
what a drive clinical at every level ravens looking scary good
lamar jackson has a perfect passer rating
hollywood is on track for roughly 10000 yards this year
keep feeding hollywood dude is killing it every opportunity he has had
cant believe i was worried about playing the browns absolute scrubs
lamar has a perfect qb rating through the first half
just a good rush you hate to see it
went 3andout pack it up lamar is washed guys everyone was right smh s
i absolutely love mp juice mans energy hes such a fucking asshole i love it
worst part of no fans no boos on bad calls
did someone order some juice
stanley questionable to return my stomach is in my asshole
friendly reminder that the browns could have taken this man first but they went for baker mayfield
waiteveryone told me lamar cant throw
its fuckin automatic for this kid holy shit
2020 ravens offense is looking wild
the defensive approach of stop the run stop amdrews make lamar throw to the wrs just got jacked
lamar is literally on cruise control right now hes not even running really
we are so fucking spoiled imagine having to watch sam darnold or mitchell trubisky every sunday no thanks

is this sub being moderated trolls not trolling today being down by 25 sure shuts people up
browns got that wap

weak

armed

pendejo
i for one embrace the new bowser memes what a fucking game hes had
bengals browns thursday night haha
i disagree about benching lamar give him his reps
did queen force that fumble
fumble and a sack by queen today love what im seeing
yas queen
how the fuck were we even able to get queen and dobbins in the draft
i feel for gus but man dobbins is for real
jk throbbins
justice hill watching jk dobbins and ingram lock up rb12
between chubb and hunt cleveland seems like they should be more dangerous i think its all scheme
man campbell is one big dude
ich liebe calais campbell
campbells going to have a pick six before the end of the year
why is jackson still in
painfully obvious illegal block in the back missed call
good edwards still a beast
rg3 baker

jaleel scott obj
foh with these trump ads
i dont normally post in other teams threads but i came to say i was so freaking wrong about lamar decisive confident athletic i wasnt one of the dbags that posted all over the place about him but i certainly thought his initial success was due more to the situational awareness of his coaching staff wow was i wrong deep ball touch quick hitters and if you can stop that then you have to account for his legs stud for sure
thanks for all the wake up calls guys were pretty awake
the ravens media team is easily the best in the league its not even fucking close
lol fuck the browns
i have a confession guys

i really really really hate the cleveland browns
i think im gonna change it up this season instead of smoking a bunch of weed during the game im going to smoke a fuckton of weed during the game

will let you know the results
fuck covid the bank should be rocking
lets fucking goooooo
let the humping begin
baker mayfield already getting a headstart on his redemption journey back to 21 picks
holy fuck put mayfield in his place wooo
he really was trying to toss it at first blush i thought he just fumbled at ingram thats some ed reed mojo there
holy shit
how the fuck do you leave lamar jacksons favorite target so wide open
mama there goes that mandrews again
lets fucking goooooo touchdown confirmed
cleveland clowns
yo this shit almost seems unfair browns are getting spanked
oh my god i forgot about garrett dont touch my quarterback
watching red zone did the browns really try a fake punt from their own side
i enjoy when the browns run a fake punt run on their own 30 i deeply enjoy it
browns d looking good runrush wise our offense looking good though for being the first real game im super happy with how we look so far
oline looking rusty
pretty sure i heard a player yell youre the fucking guy after tucker kicked that one love having the goat kicker on our squad
henry is licking his lips rn
damn i miss freddie kitchens get him back
donk
what a shitty defensive performance that drive was
nick chubb scares me
i really dont understand a reality where judon doesnt know better than that
judon cant make big plays so he makes dumb plays instead
lot of rust gotta get through it we need a signature long td drive here and finish out the half up 11 we get the ball to start the 2nd
browns look so bad right now lol granted we look rusty but they look absolutely incompetent rn as a chubb fantasy owner im pretty mad theyre using anyone but him baker looks clueless out there and im rooting for the cocky fuck
ok pat you redeemed yourself
yall need to remember that a lot of these players are literally kids and without a preseason mistakes are going to be made
boykin is a fun name to say
cant even describe how happy i am to have this team back holy shot
ive got a need

a need for snead
i am respectfully asking that the ravens go ahead and put this one away now i have homework i should be doing
ngl if the browns were a bit more consistent theyd be a really scary team their blitzes are insane they are going to fucking eat stationary quarterbacks just penalties and miscues holding them back
marlo was on the field lmao why they saying hes questionable

they showed that highlight of mason rudolph why exactly
browns game thread is a treat

just read dont comment dont be a jerk
huh go figuresolid running game and controlling the clock if only we kept this identity in the fucking playoffs
ladies and gentlemen many people still consider that guy the best wr in the league
im loving how jackson is scrambling to find his receivers and not just taking off on the run really showing progression
69 yard drive nice
mark andrews is just shitting all over the browns
lamar jackson
bruh im at work retail busy market street nobody in the store rn and i just got a complaint from our neighbors lmao yelling lets gooo too loud by myself
69 yard drive nice
man i missed football
adjust andrews rating ea
were gonna see some rg3 today arent we
stoned enjoying my sunday go ravens
browns have a kicker problem and also a problem scoring and also a problem stopping lamar
god its so crazy to be a fan of this ravens team after being a fan during the kyle boller years lmao ive never seen a ravens offense like this been a fan all my life
tuckers house is beautiful
my heart i got worried about stanley and lamar
koch i havent seen you in like 2 years
wait i get to play sam koch probably
that was a shit series to start the 2nd half
75000punt
i love petersso much swagger
thats at least 2 near picks weve missed today this defense is gonna be nasty
this team would be absolutely deadly with a healthy von miller on it
i enjoy that marcus peters comes from the terrell suggs school of who cares if everyone outside of baltimore hates you respect
jeezuz that was a laser from lamar
why didnt the browns just follow the titans and chargers playbook
mv peat
i feel the need the need for snead
this is lamars world were just living in it
lamar 1620 get it dude
what an absolute perfect pass lamar i love you so much
lamars stats are going to regress
its a good time to be a ravens fan
need to get hollywood that td
not trying to be spoiled but the pass rush sucks
your first down is in another castle baker
i guess well see rgiii later today
tyus bowser has had a few really nice plays today
bowser looking like ravens typically do during the last year of their rookie deal
sucks we gotta wait a week to see if we are actually good lol
haters this is why lamar doesnt have mahomes stats he dont ever got to play the 4th quarter
thanks for the ball lmao
patrick queen has had a few highlight plays today
i fucking love when our new guys get involved and excited queeeeeeeeen
i love seeing queen look so happy falling in love with the ravens like the rest of us
from the browns thread

my dad pretty soon and those cardboard fans are gonna start leaving
ohio fans so conflicted right now jk all day
bruh dobbins is eating
jk dobbins is the man
stunt on these hoes
doritos commercialbrady polished his helmet
payback for last year bitches
someone making a truck backing up noise picked up on tv
odell gonna request a trade
o line looking a bit rough
love lamars intensity up by 32 and still wants to get his guys moving downfield
ah yes keep these graphics up with the browns im almost there baby
maybe if baker wasnt too occupied covering all the fucking seats in a stadium individually he could have actually picked up a football during the off season
gotta love happy beers on a sunday
ah yes my blood pressure has been too calm for too long lets fucking gooooooo
that anthem was beautiful
what an incredible job by those kids on the anthem
calais almost got a pick in coverage
thats a clean pick yea hump
humphreyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
marlon humphrey is the greatest man alive
marlon loves a interception
somethings just never change huh
lets fucking go

up at 3am in australia to watch the game and loving our defense in the early showings
pick babeeeeeeee
thats some wink magic right there make no mistake baker had no fucking clue hed be seeing calais campbell in any sort of coverage today
calais campbell is a baaaaaad man
browns had a decent drive going glad we stopped the momentum
3rd time in last 5 games with driveopening int

lmao
hmm guess lamar hasnt been figured out

strange
lamar almost missed him because he didnt expect him to be so damn open
lololol fuck cleveland
good god i love making the browns look stupid
not even mad take the 3 points easy
has the nfl finally figured lamar jackson out s
still fuckin got it

chubb giving me ptsd
wheres that improved d line
hold the fucking edge it is all the browns do against us well make them run inside
a little worried that we seemed to have abandoned the blitz our defense was built on those cover 0 blitzes last year hopefully were not scared to run them now without earl but id expect to see it over the next couple drives
lots of new parts in this d remember
there will be growing pains with two rookies starting at ilb
even when the browns do good they still manage to fuck something up
hayden hurst just made a huge catch for the falcons
this tiktok commercial can fuck off
hollywooooooood
god damn what a throw
i love how you can just tell when lamar throws it that its gonna be good you dont have to pray while the ball is in the air you just know its gonna be good
that play works in madden 100 of the time too lol
im sick of fucking cute plays just give it to a runningback
god i forgot how awful game threads are
3rd and 41 thats browns for ya
love you queen
3rd and 41 god bless the browns
that was much better defense well done
do these announcers not sound like theyre reading their madden scripts or what
proche please
horrible move by proche
marlin hurt shoulder is questionable
lamars arm though
lamar cant throw
what surgical drive from their own 1 yd line
thats an nfl looking dobbins right there
10 plays for 99 yards this is what team work looks like
thank you ne for dobbins
ravens were like were gonna give you guys good field position lol jk
as a british fan your commercials are wild
lets get this ball back
marlo is back
good job odell now youre at 0 yards including your 15
its crazy to think that darnold might actually get benched for joe this year and there are still people who think hes better than lamar
obj shooketh
obj dropped that like he likes deuces dropped on him
seibert might not be let on the plane back home to cleveland
lamar is evading pressure and punishing it with his arms he looks really good out there
why do they pretend like mahomes is so much better than lamar
fucking beautiful clock management
god that fucking drive we are so lucky to have lamar
lamar looks soo much better and hollywood is on his way of becoming a great number 1 receiver in this league mandrews looks phenomenal as alwaysoffense sans that fumble has been firing on all cylinders
looks like jk is the guy already
i hope we turn up the fan volume the stadium is too quiet
that was a good defensive play
what is the pxp comments
not super worried about stanley if it felt serious he probably wouldnt be standing on the sideline
is it just me or does lamars passing look so much more refined
i hereby announce my vote for jacksonandrews in this years presidential election
the touch on that throwchrist
lamar looks better throwing than last year his ball placement has been ridiculously good
mvp mvp mvp
last year week 1 i was full of questions about lamar this year i had questions of if he could keep it up in 5 years i expect lamar to throw a td every throw hes just non stop getting better
neeeeeed for sneeeeead iv big willie edition
this is a slaughter
lamar just makes it look easy
damm another game where lamar doesnt have to finish the 4th
lamar mahomes
75 completion percentage 3 tds not bad for a quarterback

30 yards carried pretty shit for a running back
honestly fuck earl thomas
i didnt think it was possible lamar jackson looks miles ahead of where he was last year his accuracy and touch throwing the ball is impeccable hes throwing the ball like peyton manning while keeping the mobility of lamar jackson
i see this is finally the year the browns take the division eh
obj has been horrible drops mistakes penalties why is he even out there
i for one am a huge fan of baker mayfield i hope this is their qb of the future and we get to see him many more times
how long before obj has a meltdown on the field
a good old fashioned 15 yard 2 and out love to see it
me wtf whyd we give chubb so many extra yaroh fuck yes fumble
patrick queen has arrived already goddamn playmaker
score one more time and take lamar out please along with rest of the starters on o long season ahead rest up for the long haul this is enough practice save energy for real teams
queen is great
lj fort got hired because of the browns gameand now he is destroying them i dont know what it means but im for it
heard a very clear fuck yeah after that play having no fans in the stadium really clears up the audio lol
fucking lj fort im glad he made a home in baltimore steelers really fucked up on not resigning him
chill lamar
master has given dobbins the ball

dobbins is freeeeee
the browns hit each other harder than they hit lamar
dobbins what a fucking steal he was
27 never looked better
im about to nut jk dobbbbbbbbinnnnss
jk is in on my fantasy team yall need to belee more
things you love to see it

rg4th quarter
are we gonna see rgiii
hopefully ronnie is ok thats the only thing i care about right now
brown be nimble brown be quick

brown is telling the browns to suck his dick
dj fluker is awful i really hope stanley is okay
i feel like if we tackled mayfield like that it would be a flag

colts lost to the jacksonville tanks lmao
rg3 take us home
lmao our rbs are so legit its not even funny i love our back stable
game number one of lamar sitting whatd he have last year 4
not the first time this week objs been shitted on
wink kneeling invite his ass to the bbq
not a ravens fan lamar is so fucking good dude is a better magician than doctor strange
lol all you band wagoners shittin on big truss
i think i need to see a doctor my erection hasnt gone down in 24 hrs
checking in from vancouver british columbia big truss
fuck the browns
brooo this has been the longest hour of my life holy shit its been 12 o clock for weeks it feels like
well the browns coach doesnt look like a complete moron so thats an upgrade for them i guess
my truss has literally never been larger than it is right now should i call a doctor
ingrams got his game face on
fuck you cleveland
baker mayfield getting the browns into form early
humphrey campbell
hump
fuck yeah
dude humphrey is always in the best spot for picks like we know he is great but he seems to always be there for deflections
humphrey is our 1 receiver atm
ich liebe calais campbell
calais already coming in strong 2 knockdowns one leads to an int im so ready to see what this man can do all year
the ravens d now leads the league in interceptions and passes blocked
i just remembered that yanda is gone fuck
not bad for a limited edition hello kitty plush keychain
the lack of fan noise really sucks
that was a ridiculous catch
what a snag by mandrews
well im rock hard
mandrews
im glad that throw was a little high thats going to look sooo much better on the highlight reel
it was a catch even though he did lose control of the ball he regained it inbounds
i wonder if browns fans are still gonna say they have our number when lamar advances to 31 against them
whats there to review thats as obvious as day
mandrews what a catch
were going to the super bowl
its way too early in the season to be asking the existential question of whats a catch
i took a dump and it looked like the browns logo is there a problem should i see a doctor
does baker realize these games count
get that shit outta here

i knew it was coming lmao
i am laughing so hard
one of us yelled you not built like that sounded like levine lol
gonna remind everyone this is the first real game action for both teams both offenses are going to be rusty both defenses are naturally going to play better
browns already looking stupid on the first game of the season
tucker is so automatic its amazing

i keep forgetting how blessed we are to have such an accurate kicker when i watch other teams i cringe at their kickers since they miss so often compared to tucker at least
this browns d line is looking good ngl the offense naturally needs time to adjust its normal
yikes gotta do better on run defense
runs set them up we need to stop the fucking run
we cant all be tucker
blown coverage ugh
linebackers have to fill gaps and play sideline to sideline
even when the browns do something good they manage to fuck it up lol
we got turnovers on 23 possessions so far theres no need to panick chubb and hunt are two very good backs
not bad for a runningback
god i love hollywood
why try to be fancy we have ingram and lamar ffs
horrible result but its not completely his fault just rust
scoring is going to be a problem for the jets lolllllll
this is where we are really missing the crowd noise
4th and 41 lmaoooooo browns
i stand corrected on that penalty hurting us browns have managed to brown there way back to their side of the field and got nothing off the initial turnover
i dont understand why he didnt catch that punt
marlo questionable with his shoulder
dumb simple mistake after another
coulda shoulda woulda downed that earlier

that 4th and 41 drive is still one of the most beautiful drives ive seen though
marlon has a shoulder injury and is questionable to return hopefully its not too bad favorite player
smart to go back to ricard you cant let one funble early ruin a whole season
hollywoods looking great
dobbins aint no lil boy
jk sighting could be the start of something fellas
99 yards inject this shit into my veins
what a fucking rebound drive and give the defense a chance to rest up amazing lamar didnt rush once either i dont think
i need to see that ingram jk dance again someone have that
what a beautiful drive by lamar n company lamar looking even better as a passer wow
our rookies are
ray ri i mean dobbins looking good
lamar looking very good
god damn its such a good time to be a ravens fan
99 yards in 10 plays
any update on marlon
shades of ray rice
jk but he aint joking
fun fact that 2001 miami wild card game featured george w bush choking on a pretzel and nearly dying
i really wish they would stop with this monstars shit
so weird with nobody in the stands
damn that a a great catch
holy fuck what a catch
ok that was a good catch by njoku
damn good catch though
all things considered i think its comforting to see the offense actually putting it somewhat together

some of these offenses are looking rough
pxp summary of last sequence the browns browned
obj had a lot of shit on his mind thats why he dropped the ball
snead has really been a great addition to this team glad we have him
man obj is really playing like hes got something on his chest
guys im straight up having a good time
this is the first time i have ever said it and meant it but lamar is the best qb in the game
and coming out of half well take 8 minutes on 75 yards rushing to get us 31
lamar jackson
absolutely nothing has changed since last year with our offense
baker mayfield is like what the hell just happened
like a hot knife through butter
lamar looking like a back to back mvp here
im poppin a natty feels good boys
do the browns know theres a game
mvp mvp mvp
lj looking sharp today hollywood is a game changer now hes fully fit too unreal start to the season
got that 1583 at halftime
ugh i hate the patriots but like cam newton
holy fuck another rodgers bombs away td pass
defense tightened up late in the half i hope those early big rushes were just the d brushing the rust off
last season was legit the funnest season ever as a fan man it feels good to pick up from where we left off
seems like the defense has stiffened up a bit not sure how much of that is just on the browns having to abandon the run for the most part as the lead grows but well see

queen doing well so far got in on that sack and is leading the team in tackles so far harrison has been a mixed bag when hes in had that tip that shouldve been intercepted but also horribly misplayed the long chubb run early on solid overall though

lamar is just carving them up rushing offense really hasnt done much with just 60 total yards which im sure in shocking the media right now

score could be even more lopsided if we didnt have ricards first and last run leading to a fumble
are we going to have a game thread for love island
can we appreciate the epic hair of wink good lord that is majestic
lets hear it for a cbs game without fouts
i dont watch football a lot my favorite league is nba but god damn lamar jackson is my favorite athlete ever hes so fucking good
hate 3rd down penaltys
refs tryna make this a game so bad
goodell pushed the make this game closer button
refs deciding that marlon is no longer allowed to play defense
enough with these flags refs wtf
obj playing like his kink
just gonna leave this here for anyone who needs it


obj you suck
the one thing i did not realized would be lost by having no fansthere is no noise in the officials heads when they make bullshit calls on the home team there will be no home cooking this year in the nfl
up 246 let stanley rest and hope hes ready for next week
bro lamar looks great passing
wait do people like actually say with no sarcasm that lamar cant throw
mandrews has no business having the hands like this
snead iv deserved that one because hes been quietly having a very good day
ian eagle is a gem takitaki with the tackle tackle love it
fucking dimes again
perfect season start lets gooooo
thats my mvp
i love seeing beckham cry like this
need for snead underground 2
heavenly llama hallowed be thy name
a live look at rbrowns
obj loves shit so much he plays for the browns
the commentator pointed out that the browns pass pro has been good imo it has been great

the browns offense has severely underperformed
mayfield is abysmal
bowsers redemption
just do this 17 more times
what a makeup play lets go bowser
bowser power
objs career is in the toilet
mission accomplished weve made baker look so bad their fans wanna trade him
mark andrews has taken over the position of iron dick on the team
first bad pass all day ill take it
god damn this team is good
dude pistachios are good i just got with the no shell bag
alright lets get hollywood his td now
score one more td put in rg3

edit wear some oakleys
also shout out to fort mchenry with the rexovery
i hate it for mark but jk looks way better
jk dobbins td hes racking it up
jk you friggin moron
lamar paid dobbins back for his block
is it premature to check the barn and see if the hays in there
thank you 31 teams who passed on dobbins
23 on the browns absolutely rocked his teammate holy shit
great final pre season game to tune up cant wait for the real season to start against real teams
is this team good
labench jackson
alright its rg3 time
2020 friendship has ended with jk rowling you are now friends with jk dobbins
my favorite part of that drive a browns player makes a tackle on boykin for a short gain on second down and some browns player is yelling fuck you look at the scoreboard before youre going to talk
as of right now the ravens have outscored week 1 opponents 8916 in 2 games blowing loads faster than me at 16
my favorite shot of this game was slow mo baker rocketing the ball into ccs paw while getting rocked from the side classic
i love lamar and thats why i want you to take him out john
dont look now but washington might knock off philly
keeping lamar in makes some sense with the lack of preseason games i could understand why hed be in
good thing odell is used to getting shit on
this is just dumb take lamar out
is that not a tackle below the knees
ricard has been a lot of negative yardage this game
wheres the flag for block in the back
not that it matters but how do you not call that block in the back
game 1 done and done
why was that not a roughing the passer on lamar that was a tackle below the knee
anyone else have to do a double take whenever someone says jackson instead of lamar
return game has looked good too proche and duvernay

a lot of fun today need to do it again the next two weeks
already cant wait until next sunday
lol someone gif that
gus is so fucking good x4
hurst 3 catches 38yds vs sea i think he will put up better production as the season progresses
1 afc north baby
cam newton is looking good enough not lamar but no one really is good for him i dont care how he plays for im a cam newton fan
last years opener 59 points

this years opener 38 points

clearcut offensive regression time to start over s
rip mo gaba this is for you my man
but but i thought that nick chubb was the ravens kryptonite
fuck im clenched
run the ball run the ball and then run the ball
ready to start the last season baker mayfield plays as an nfl starter
ahhh game threads cant wait to see the over reaction all over again miss these things the nba ones were cancer
odell super excited for marlon to shit on him once again
in a weird way this is the calmest ive ever been before a season opener not because the browns will be a cakewalk not because were a shoe in to win this game but because we have lamar jackson
lets fucking go
i moved out of md a few years ago and forgot about the you save less when jack says yes guy lol
did they shoot fireworks because it looks smokey
this doesnt feel real
pick six from mpjuiceman incoming
nothing would make me happier then a baker pick on the opening drive
fuck outta here baker
lmao baker the bust
holy shit campbell is a monster in the field
campbell and humphrey already iconic duo
thats money well spent on campbell
campbell showing up big on the first defensive series
baker is trash
oh yea thats what i like to see
campbell u fuckin beast
calais campbell is the truth
wheres my mvp
we are eating brownies today
we back babay
calais in coverage is some controlled chaos shit
campbell such a beast what a fucking fleecing by the gm
bro im so fucking mad the stream cut off literally before the interception
wait the rookie is starting at rg
lamar has been hanging with reed

1 dimensional qb right
lamar and andrews picking up where they left off last season
great snag mandrews
a andrews is going to get a hell of a payday
i love the baltimore ravens football team
mandrews holy shit what a catch
i aint know we had mr fantastic playing te for us lmao
picking up where we left off week 16
that was a great catch but lamar panicked seeing him so wide lol
i fucking love mark andrews
2 shoulders and 1 head thats possession easy
amazing catch that one got a little bit away from lamar but still touchdown
looks like he regained possession from his body didnt hit the ground
thats a catch
good thing mandrews has them thicc thighs to keep hold of that catch
was that pitch an illegal forward pass it obv doesnt matter but idk why lamar even tried that
if that catch is ruled not a catch the replay official should be needlepoked in his ball
i have a serious question that is somewhat off topic for what reason do we have security guards watching the cardboard cut outs lol
ravens

ravens
calais campbell is already making his mark im fully here for it
i forget that baker is still a young qb he looks like a 45 year old car salesman
what a terrible call cleveland
lmfao fucking browns
wtf lmao why would you do that on your side of the field
i fucking love this team
i will say browns run d doesnt look bad
more like scottish hammered
oline gonna need to step up a little more
in tucker we trust
ill enjoy watching this browns line against the steelers and bengals
oh god here comes my chubb ptsd
browns are running a high pace need a stop
no pass rush again and even when it does they hold
hm have we tried not getting stiff armed into oblivion
terrible series
run defense come on
fucking embarrassing do better
board has gtg strictly a special teamer like chris smoores
piss poor defense on that drive
two turnovers and everyone saying the defense is looking bad one bad drive is all we good
uhewhodoubts not 50 but you called it lol
hollywood fucking killed that route
lamar cant throw
buffstreamz and nflbite dont work for me its just an infinite loading spinning circle
ugh what a blow pass to hollywood wasted
you cannot take the ball out of the best player in the leagues hands to give it to a fb
i feel like the lack of preseason is showing for some guys
why the fuck do you give it to ricard over ingram and dobbins
run defense is looking quite weak so far
cant stop the run no pass rush
dline is mia rn
so much talent on offense and ricard gets the ball never liked that stuff
can we please fix the run defense
mayfield could make a sandwich and still have time to throw the ball
im just happy to be back in these threads watching everyone freak out

football is back baby
its always matt judon fucking hell
judon stays doing that why
i was mentally prepared to get mad at the ref but lmao yeah judon that was dirty
that was dumb
god damn i do not like judon
judon with his boneheaded play good for a few of those
sacked queen
3rd and 41
3rd and for fucking ever
pq speed
proche what the fuck
3rd 41

some things never change
3rd and 41 not many plays for that
wtf was that
im not understanding why he didnt field it
gah wtf proche
why would you not catch that
marlon coming back in next drive had his helmet on
jk dobbins bout to go 98 yards
sloppiness from no preseason is showing on both sides though with the browns its hard to tell if its no preseason or lol browns
boykin got sent fucking 5 yards forward with that hit lol
lamar has leveled up
lamar jackson is the greatest of all time
dobby is a free elf
jk all day
this drive is calming
dobby came to rescue baltimore ravens
cleveland is gonna stop us herejk lol
jk all fucking day dobbins
i have been excited to see dobbins all offseason welcome to the nfl kid
lol just walk 99 yards like its nothing
remember 5 minutes ago when the browns were happy they had the ravens backed up at their own 1 yard line good times
holy fuck we are actually terrifying
the patriots traded for half a season of mohamed sanu so the ravens could draft jk dobbins
lamar surgical
this is wild everything we do works feels weird to be a fan of this team right now and i cant even explain it
99 yard drive god damn i love this team
odells father is back
if dobbins can keep that up he might just take the 1 back from ingram who actually hasnt looked all that this game so far
beckham is so overhyped you love to see it
lol beckham

ok now miss the fg
good catch odell
if that was a turd obj catches that no doubt
wide open drop

hard right shank kick

just cleveland things
siebert is going to be collecting unemployment on monday
people miss field goals justin tucker would never
man imagine if we get a td here too
hollywood looking crisp
the only thing good about baker mayfield is his commercials
brown got 100 yards already ahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahah he is going to have a monster year
keep going lamar im almost there
that all happened in 45 seconds of game time
mandrews

no

manimal
i have chemistry homework due tomorrow but this is more important
69 yard td drive

nice
as soon as i saw we had 40 seconds with 2 tos i knew it was 7

honestly amazing everytime
2 minute drill na 1 minute drills
get these boys the fuck outta here lets go
i always forget how nervous i get and how much i over react i love football
ravens tripling quadrupling up the browns score love to see it

oh wait i made a math mistake
were so good man
our offense is absolutely lethal at the 2 minute drill at least against the browns they cannot handle it
dumb question is rg3 still on the team as backup would love to see him in the 4th quarter
i dont know how but i somehow got cmc and lamar in fantasy and i think those are the only 2 players ill need
i predicted hollywood to have 165 i think i might get that one
lamar loves fucking up cleveland with less than a minute left
i still cant get used to having an offense that can actually move the chains consistently
not bad for a running back
shoutouts cam newton fuck the pats
lamar missed that hot read
koch still top 5 in the game
good blitz by them credit where its due
hot take buying a jersey of a 42 yo qb who hasnt won shit for your team yet is a waste of money
oh look more flags on 3rd down and another dumb fucking penalty
no replay of the non existing pi
homegirl obj
the browns best defense is these flags
wtf is with all these flags
rgiii in the 4th
rip to that browns defender that said lamar wasnt aaron rodgers lollllll
andrews is really gonna have a kelcekittle type year isnt he
dear santa claus

mark andrews has been very good this year please give all my presents to him and lamar jackson thank you

sincerely
thaddyg
snead snead snead
perfect throw
god i wish there were fans there the whole city would be vibrating
shitting on these browns
get fucking destroyed
lamar is throwing dimes
did snead cut his hair or just tucked in helmet
i wonder if stefanski will even last the season
he aint turn into aaron rodgers
sheldon richardson of the cleveland clowns
i love when lamar shows out when he aint even running the ball just like week 1 last week
this is why i wish my non ravens fans friends would just watch our games how can you tell me lamar cant throw him and mahomes are changing the game just passing the ball

the amount of comments in the browns thread saying lamar is so much better than baker is actually making me feel slightly uncomfortable im not used to that
this lamar jackson guy is pretty good he could even be mvp someday
weird its raining inside my apartment now
aaron rodgers 2131 210 yds 2td 0td

lamar jackson 1620 252 yds 3 td 0 td

looks like sheldon richardson was right lamar wont be turning into rodgers anytime soon hes too efficient
fucking right nice legal clean put you on your ass tackle
marquise brown the first 100yard receiver of the 2020 season before halftime ledyardnfldraft
too many passes getting through our zone
oh god averett is on the field
great sack lets go
bowser made up for it instantly
love bowsers persistence on that play
the browns are just shitting all over the field and im pretty sure odell is into that sorta thing
bowser has looked very good all game and earned that sack
do we drop 40
lamar getting 3 more tds for second mvp season

lets do it boys
even the fake fans in the stadium are getting hoarse from cheering the domination
the jackson andrews connection isnt fair
mandrews is cheating dude is out here catching footballs with 3 arms
is it just me or is the run blocking a little rusty or is ingram looking rustyor both
yikes lj dont force anything we good
first bad throw all game for lamar
do we have a status update on stanley fluker completely missed that block and forced lamar to run
i have no idea what that throw was lamar but its all good
lamars playing way better than mahomes was vs the texans
did queen strip that
fumbalites
i bet cleveland is wishing these browns would move too
this fort will stand strong
queeeeeeen
one of the things i actually like about not having fans is i can hear the defense go wild when they make a play the wooing and jiving makes me so happy to hear haha
holy shit im so excited for this season man
these rookies looking
thank you seahawks for passing on him for another linebacker
my wife and i are doing jager bombs for each ravens td one more and we each might die im hoping for 3 more tds this game lol
queen is a stud
browns getting shit on so hard obj is gonna ask for the tape later
dobbins with a key block before the td

kid is perfect for this offense
rg3 time
good stuff give ingram a rest and let dobbins get some relatively worry free reps
dobbins is our fucking guy
i love it from dobbins
lamar needs to chill w the contact but hes a baller what do u expect
2 for dobbins 2 for mandrews 1 for snead fucking amazing
dobbins needs to start
i think we found our new rb1
my guy dobbins out here being a fucking stud
386 you love to see it fuck the browns
dobbins is great but i still think they will do a two headed running approach with ingram
dont troll the browns thread but its funny af to look at right now
bring on the jk memes
you think we might see rg iii
browns might see lawrence at qb baker is so bad
whats the browns excuse this year then no prep cos of covid
obj is a bitch




super star dropping gimmes left and right plus add the attitude of a spoiled flag football player who thinks they are the star of the show
anyone else want to see 50 points
want a smile today check out rbrowns

thats the most obvious block in the back ive ever seen and they dont call it imagine the score without these refs
cleveland is down 32

cleveland run ball
rg3 and leaving some of the rookie receivers in love to see it
didnt realize rg3 was only 770 yards from 10k on his career hope he gets there eventually
backups in must be a blowout browns blow ass
odells hair is justin timberlake circa 1999
im proud that so many of our players are kneeling stand up for what you believe in theres nothing more patriotic than peaceful protests
jackson brown 2020
judon you always do some sus shit
yall will bail on anyone after a single play
im a big blm supporter but wow the nfls ad is cringy football is a microcosm of america lol what
baker is so bad and all the browns sub is blaming odell what a toxic and slightly racist sub ahahahahaha
thats why myles garrett is a star browns good but garrett is really damn good
havent had a decent returner since jacoby
rip mo
for mo
rip mo
mo loving watching his first game

rest in peace
why the fuck are we just letting the browns line obj up with averett on every down
dont mind me im just looking for that browns fan on twitter from last week that told me lamar isnt a great passer and that the browns were gonna show us up on sunday
so i was working at aldi this morning and the amount of customers wearing lamar jackson jerseys today made me very happy
with no preseason i am bracing myself for a whole lot of who the hell is that guy lol
god this is going to be so weird with no fans how will we hear 7 nation army
checking in from edmonton alberta canada lets fucking go boys
god it feels good to post in a game day thread what a year its been huh

whats crackin bois lets smack these brownies

go ravens
lets fucking goooooooooooooooooooo
rockin that white lamar jersey lfg
i get so nervous before ravens games and i kinda hate it but here i am again regardless
lets fucking go
lets have a nice clean injury free game my boyos
it would have been cool to see the browns and ravens unite like the chiefs and texans did but oh well lets get this dub
uh is anyone elses stream sill saying the game will start soon
im so happy bmore is back

im so happy football is back

yall im so hyped man lets see what weve got
defense first campbell gonna get a sack
the defense said enough slanderrrrrrr
campbell bringing that trevor pryce action
tip drill lets go humph
lets fucking gooo
nice scoop hump
was that clean
fuck yeah marlon
god i hope baker plays in cleveland for a decade
campbell didnt even need to reach for that knockdown
im wet
here we gooo
hahahahahahahahahah
marloo lets gooo
lets fucking go
bust
calais already making an impact what a player
campbell was the key player on 3 consecutive plays
go head big trusssssss
devin duvernay first nfl catch
ed reed flashbacks


td mark andrews
bruh i love it but bruh
mark andrews said sorry for that interception against the titans ill do better now
i knew he was going to mandrews fuck yes
lamar taking lateral tips from ed reed
mandrews baby lfg
wowowow
mandrews with the snatch by his manly mitts
one hand looks like when im playing madden
what a catch wish lamar didnt make it so hard but we have our first highlights boys
andrews goes up for it reminds me of the td he had against the browns at the end of the first half last year
that was a very nice catch

bad throw my jackson tho he was wide open
thats a td he retained control before his legs touched out of the back on the end zone
no doubt thats a catch
andrews looking like hes really been working on his catching skills last year that might have been a miss
baker looks a tad nervous
another commercial unnecessary
show no mercy i want to crush the browns with everything theyve got
man i cant find a stream for this shit anywhere
good play fort
freddie is that you
i know the browns are trash but what the hell are they doing
the ravens were not surprised by that call they saw it coming from a million miles away
levine saw that coming way before the snap
i love you browns never change
fort obliterated that play
if youre going to bring that fake make sure your punter can take a hit
are we gonna have to make any long drives this game lmao
he absolutely got scottish hammered there
honestly if im a browns fan i like that play youre at baltimore need some momentum you wanna set a tone early with the new coach
you can almost hear the looney tunes theme on that one
all good were up 10 already im not complaining
2 possession game early well take it
im more excited to see the defense now tbh
damn well tuck is money
goat kicker
like our runpass selection so far hoping lamars shaky td throw was just a little rust
the defense looking amazing so far especially the rushing d

wanted a td but live to fight another drive and get some type of points on board
wait if the refs are wearing masks how are they blowing whistles
remember we have no tape on this offense
very poor effort on d that drive need to tidy that up
really bad effort from the d that series
run defense on the edge is still a weak area from the team
typical cleveland lmao
that was some awful defense
post lolol
our olbs are still our achilles heal exactly why the ravens dont want to pay judon top dollar not outside pressure no contain hope we can clean it up but started just like last year
browns clown show on special teams tho
oh my god i think we have an actually competent returner again this is amazing
duvarney fast af excited for these kickoff returns
nice throw by lamar and route by hollywood
x200b

lamars accuracy lqqks good to me
give hollywood a raise
gimme them ankles boy
that pass thoooo
hollywood
oh im ready for hollywood
hollywood
so that ricards last carry ever
well fuck still not super worried but fuck lack of preseason games leaves us and every other team im sure with some things to iron out
well he wont be getting a carry again this year
what the fuck ricard
defense is eh so far
glad to see they fixed the dline
7 ypc run defense looks like shit
fuck im still so triggered by that fumble
i imagine some big personnel changes for week 2
didnt judon do enough of that last year
of course what ravens game wouldnt be complete without a stupid penalty on a 3rd down stop
judon you moron
bruh wtf judon
marlon please be okay
3 and 41 thanks browns
yas queen
3rd 41
3rd and 41 thats some browns shit right there
can we get a marlo update
is marlon ok
yaaaaas queen
pick that damn thing up
think they might fake it here
catch the ball what the fuck
and youre fired
hopefully marlos shoulder isnt too hurt
sloppy drive hope humphrey is ok looked like an armhand injury but there wasnt much contact
pxp great catch a run by boykin like 20
we resigned ray rice
man miles boykin is one seriously huge guy for a wr
liking this new 27
loved the sidearm from lamar
yall fucked up letting this man fall
bad run jk
theyre working outside of the numbers in a way they werent able to last year good sign
willie wanted it so close so weird without the long hair
that was damn satisfying to watch
we really have 3 running backs that could be starters at other teams
i repeat jk all day
excuse me tucker that was like 4 inches to the right of the middle tighten up now sir
lamar just put up a masterpiece of a drive geez
u cant mob with the dobb
woohoo dobbins
i love this team
the magical world of jk dobbins
great drive using the pass to set up the run
pxp 30 yard pass from mayfield to obj from 25
damn fantastic catch
i like that theyre closing down the run a bit
tackling is definitely preseason level
queen was boutta have baker seeing stars baker lucky he slipped
who the fuck just missed that tackle on hunt
gosh those browns uniforms are ugly
nice catch odell
old cold hands odell dropped it
lmaooo browns need a new kicker
hahahahahahahahahahahahaha
i think the browns might be in the market for a kicker do we have a guy we could get a fifth for
kicker is shook
rwatchpeopledieinside
lets get another we need to blow these fuckers out
i cant believe we have an offense that will get points out of this i love it
pxp jackson to brown at the browns 36 to no more raven tos
stefanski just opened his first bottle of whiskey after being sober in quarantine for 8 months
hollywood has over 100 yards
brothers lamar is the fucking mvp
lamar wants to throw for 6000 yards this season just to show up the haters
flashbacks to last years 2 minute drill against the browns
bro i might cry im so proud of this team
lamar is dotting them up
hey guys lamar is pretty good
you love to see it al
lamar jackson the concept of a quarterback
is it me or has lamars passing gotten better he was always good but he seems more accurate
absolutely fucking clinical god you cant do it any better than that
league mvp got better lol league fucked
the old double dip last score first half first drive 2nd half
fuckin lamar
clock management on point
andrews joining the kittle kelce tier this year book it
fuck we scored 33 points a game last year sheeeeeiiiiiiiiittt
browns in 2min drill 0 pts
ravens in 2min drill in 35sec 7 pts
we have been sloppy as hell and we are on pace to win 4812

we have come a long way
ravens lost a fumble in the red zone too lets gooooooo
andrews calling his agent now tell em to bring me my money
mark is so good cant even think of another te who he reminds me of him and lamar are gonna have long careers together i hope
nice
im sorry all of you loyal ticket holders missed this half i cant wait until the shit is over and were all back
gus and jk time
lamars been great picked up right were he left off last season
stanleymarloandrews and llamathats 1billion in cap there
hey guys pass rush is easier when the offense is 18 points down just watch
lamar jackson
we told the league lamar was gonna be on an unfinished business rampage they didnt listen to us
yeah that couldnt have gone any better
did bill cowher get old notes or something almost every stat he just read was wrong including the seahawks score
big truzz big difference between class of the nfl and a gutter team
we can end it right here with a td lol
i dont want to ever hear shit about mayfield being a good qb ever
dobbins played all three downs looks like theyre already giving him the nod
gotta id that blitz lamar its all good though lets keep kicking ass
p queen has been dope flying all over the field
lets just leave beckham uncovered let the air penalize him
damn thats a weak ass call
ref ball time
the fix is in
you guys cant even blame the refs lmao that was an obvious hold for like 15 yards
could this be anymore obvious the refs are helping the browns
lmfaooo odell
refs playing better offense than the browns
crybaby beckham hahaha
lmao tell me more about how good obj is
juiceman
i love juiceman and his energy
okay nvm thanks refs
lol so were basically back to where we were at the start of our first drive of the half
not stanley not lower body injury pls
what a catch
mandrews to the 25
the browns having a quarter of our points in the 3rd quarter is a sign that the world is slowly healing
mark andrews
mark andrews would not be able to play in a previous era he spends so much of his time with both arms up in the air climbing the ladder twenty years ago hed be on his way to the morgue making those plays
touchdownnn
i just wanna say i am so happy to see skura out there after last year dude is a warrior
browns fan here at least i have mark andrews on my fantasy team and i bet on the ravens
beautiful pass
mvp
lamar throwing absolute dots
need for snead baby big truss woot woot
sneeeeeeeeeeeeeead
gorgeous touch pass lamar is on another level man
just imagine having 6 points and it doesnt even come from 2 succesfull drives
well yall think we should put rg3 i want to but i also want lamar to stat pad for my fantasy team
that read and throw was sublime
lamar is the coolest man on earth
another season of lamars stats taking a hit from resting 4th quarters sigh
the most impressive part of this game isfor the most part the browns have done a wonderful job shutting down the designed runs for lamar and there still about to lose by 30
it is mid 3rd quarter and lamar jackson has a perfect passer rating
juice is dying for a pick 6
elliott thump
jesus that hit was vicious
marcus peters has been great
hunt 100 deserves to get splatted on every play
jokerrrrr
earl who
wow the joker holyyyyy fuck
pass rush is going to need some work
the lack of pass rush is a major concern going forward
i mean if nothing else this game is pissing off odell an odell pissed off at baker is a good odell for us
marlon chirpin all game is funny to hear with no fans lol
bowser
nice make up play bowser
lfg bowser lmao browns
bowser
your first down is in another castle
obj shoulda just stuck with the giants
leave lamar in just stack stats
how many catches does mark andrews crotch have today
fuck the browns say it with me
mayfield is so fucking badjeez i feel bad for cleveland for having such a talented bunch of guys but garbage qb this was an easy win for us and we didnt even look that sharp
do you guys remember when obj wrecked us on the giants a few seasons ago now he looks like a second year 71 rated receiver thats good only in madden how did they manage to fuck him up so bad lol
i will forever love ingram but he looks a step slower this year
love seeing the shield on the field again
we are gonna have to work on facing the blitz offensively
why did lamar throw that there lol
we really have the best kicker and punter in the nfl its almost a shame we dont get to see them more
ball out ravens got it
im not mad about that pass cuz it was 3rd down it would have been an arm punt lamar knows whats up
aaaaaaah
is that 2 ff for fort
was that queen our rookies are having a day
im not turning us off
chubb chokes finally
im so stupid for choosing the pats d over our own d fuck
thats my queen
queeeeen yaaas good 1st rnd pick
yas queen
queen
lj fort is ballin out there today
pq leading the team in tackles 1 sack and 1 forced fumble baller
love being able to hear the players well someone down there mp going hoo hoo hoo after the fumble
patrick queen baby
patrick queen is his name
just want to point out that lamar and mayfield have the same number of completions but mayfield has thrown 10 more passes
queen is such a stud what a great pick
queen

the most powerful piece on the chessboard
someone more talented that i am please make a patrick yas queen t shirt
in the words of jon snow hes my queen
lamar slide
all of this talk about pat queen and with good reason he is great but can we talk about the monster game of lj fort dude has been amazing today
throbbins for dobbins
td j k dobbins
i like what i am seeing from dobbins
take lamar out now
rgiii time coming
lamar you gunna give me a heart attack
how many times do i have to say this jk all day
its rg3 time baby
jk but he aint jokin
game time game over lets go ravens
jkkkkkk
fluker has a lot of mass
idc what anyone says dont act like this is just a warmup the browns have a solid team with countless playmakers we are just that good
the elite jk dobbins sittin on my fantasy teams bench awesome
the only way the browns will ever be good is if they move out of cleveland change their team name burn all of their uniforms and other cleveland related memorabilia erase their history and pretend that non of their players coaches or staff ever stepped foot in that shithole of a city
no mercy

we want to see tears
dobbins two big plays in a row
why is chiefs vs chargers considering a bigger game than ravens vs texans
you pass on 3rd and inches
let mcgoatly get his reps in
who was beeping in the background like a truck backing up on the penalty
whos worse baker or odell
i want lamar to just ruin their day even more but i also want rg3 to be able to score a tuddy on the browns tough call
solid preseason game here cant wait to start week one next week
is it just me or is getting delay of game on a 4th and 1 when you have chubb pretty much unforgivable
maybe baker should just go back to mowing the grass at firstenergy
gotta be close to rg3 time at this point
tough day for patty
pat having a rough day
this literally a talking point from madden haha
its a 4 man rush cmon man
rg3 isnt warming up so lj might stay in
well we made it 34 of the way through the game until we started hearing excuses for the browns
skura is a beast love having him back out there
break out the oakleys
u just love to see that graphic there
yo baker you aint lamar
lol baker
that whole team looks so defeated
rg3
its crazy how much i hate baker and the browns but im kind of rooting for burrow and the bengals
gusto bursting up the middle
clevelands line looking pretty strong tbh
fluker and phillips instead of stanley and yanda though
this seems like the longest game ever
where are these washington fans coming from i dont give a fuck theyre going to beat philly

fuck the wft
thats the sad thing about all of this how many people is mexican food holding back

glad that aint the case with the dirty bird living off the crab cakes
first game of the year first win of the year
remember the flacco days where wed have 10 points going into the 4th quarter
lamar just go out man we dont need extra hits
proche man fair catch bro
what a dumbass shouldve caught it
ok its really weird seeing not tom brady as qb for the pats
mo
this one is for mo
all offseason the media has acted like the browns have pros in charge now yet down 386 in the 4th quarter theyre running the ball and grinding clock some things never change
im here for the overreactions
that throw did not need to be that difficult but damn does it feel good to have guys that can reel it in
that feel when u actually have a fucking wr1
i dont understand roman sometimes its 31 just go 5 wide they cant stop everyone and lamar
that doesnt happen with moore back there

cmon rook you got this

am i crazy to think washington without a name is kinda sleak i think they should keep football team
looks like phillips is getting the start over fluker very surprising
damn they got alicia
i love this uni combo
welcome back everyone heres to a great year
palms are sweaty
ive got a prime rib on deck football is about to start fuck im glad its back boys
fight fight fight
fuck the browns
checkin in from the uk
hoping for an injury free win

even the flyover is on without fans surreal
one more commercial break lets go
its one o clock and the nerves just hit me hard
yes we deferred
lets go
lets gooooooooo
lets gooo
that gold mo in baltimore warms my heart ngl
tucker looks more leantoned like he was never a big guy in any sense but he for sure doesnt look like he has a dad bod
damn i really wanted to see lamar to start the game but queen and cc going to eat rn
good shit calais

baker starting 2020 like baker do
thats it im getting a calais campbell jersey
humph there it is
yup run it down their throats
baker is so bad hahahah
pls someone help me find a free stream for the game im a stranded ravens fan in texas
holy fuckin shit did we actually run a wr screen
that was scary
looking like a madden play
dobbins looks just like rice physically in pads kinda wild
dont scare me like that llama
how in the world that was a better pitch than i ever even saw reed make
mandrews
good fucking snag
oh my god mandrews
lets goooooooooo
mandrews
woooooo what a snag
just an opening drive td nothing special hohum
that catch lamar a little hot on that throw needs to settle down a little
mandrews back at it
i picked lamar on my fantasy big w
woo that catch
what a start
he caught it with his pee pee
2020 is getting better already
thats a td no way theres enough to overturn it
not nearly enough evidence to overturn that
what are they looking at its not even close
mandrews baby lets gooooo
how come we arent pumping crowd noise
anyone having problems with game pass
im just sitting here smiling eartoear footballs back babyyyyy
that guys is like knock off donald glover
baaaaker here baker baker baker baker
stuck at work go ravens
can do without the mahomes statefarm commercials lol
first defensive stand force a turnover
first offensive drive march down the field for a td

oh yeahits all coming together
my stream sucks

is it against the rules to ask where people are streaming from
damn baker jackson with that juke lol
fuck off the field
browns fan here gg ravens maybe next year
that was just funny
imagine being that dumb lol
lmaooo same ol browns
what the fuck was that
its too early to panic brownies
tavon is back my dudes
get that weak shit outta here
lmfao
browns being browns
special team dreams
lmao clowns
what the fuck are the browns doing lmfao
mmm couldnt ask for a better start
lj fucking fort im buying his jersey
freddie kitchens has entered the chat
i hope freddie kitchens is laughing his ass off right now
lol browns you fucking idiots you never try a special teams fake against us
browns gonna browns
its ok ill take the fg
oline gotta tighten up
automatuck
still fucking got it
still just the 1st quarter people
chubb still an issue
new ravens fan here i hope we go all the way this year
lets get a sack pls
our pass rush fucking sucks they so slow
browns fighting racial injustice probably just cost them at least 80 of their fanbase
run defense looks sorry
malik harrison looking jittery hope he can shake it off blew contain on two big runs now
we fell asleep on this defensive series letting them run all over us
malik harrison is lost out there his angles are all off
b o n k
that was way too easy a touchdown pathetic coverage
how embarrassing
even when they get a touchdown they still find a way to be dissapointing
solid return
hollywood
hollywood
i saw a comment a few minutes ago asking where hollywood wastheres hollywood doing hollywood things
hollywoo
fuck what a throw and catch
ah so thats what its like to have an actual kick returner duvernay is fast
they dont trust lamar to throw
where the guy who was bitching wheres hollywood
look at the patience omg
literally pin point
ho shit hollywood
god damn what a beautiful throw and catch
hollywoooooooood
lamar is just fine
healthy hollywood will be lethal
started after a bullshit spot on that lamar run
not great
we are rusty
we got a little too cute there i feel but this isnt any sort of hole we cant dig out of in any sense we just have to take back the momentum now
cant you just run with your back
hold on to the ball its a one yard push you idiot
pat aint getting a carry the rest of the year
so annoying when coaches go 400 iq and dont give the ball to our literal best players
run d is just bad rn
if we could hit mayfield once that would be great
this d has been to or bust so far
im still steaming about them not having richard lead block
mayfield has enough time back there to cook a full barbecue
a lot less blitzing this year a lot of playing off guys
marlon saying hello to his son
here comes shitboy
oh how ive missed this board imploding when the team doesnt steam roll every play
judon
ffs can we get rid of judon please
are you fucking kidding me judon
well that was a disastrous 5 seconds
omg humphrey no
can we cool it with the beckham cam no one cares he hasnt done squat
same shit from judon
this defense has been garbage today
just hope marlon is fine
judon playing like shit maybe its good we didnt give him that contract
dammit judon what the fuck
cant they program the crowd to cheer when calls go their way would make it seem more realistic at least
yaaaaaas queeen
3rd and 35 hahahahah
lol are they just racking up more punting room
been a while since ive seen a 3rd and 41
aww so close to a pick still a good defensive stand though
what an abortion of a drive by the browns o this is what happens when you try to involve odell
3rd and 3000
3rd and 41 lol
4th and 41 is the most browns thing ever
about time the fucking d showed up
2 rookies back to back plays
almost made it 4th and 50 lmao
bruh new returner next time
i hate stacking mistakes
hope marlon is okay
cb marlon humphrey shoulder is questionable to return


lamar 99 yard run
ravens are not where they were last season not surprising given the off season but worth noting they have to get it together to challenge the already rolling chiefs
marlon is fine hes going back in luckily
butthole clenched the second ricard touched the ball lolll
pxp ricard for 8 on a sweet side arm from lamar
ok that was pretty so pretty
99 yard drive
it is so strange to not hear the stadium erupt in cheers on a big first down
im so damn excited to see hollywood this year fully healthy he just looks better
offense is looking great besides the fumble run out as much as the clock head into half with a 10 point lead and run it back after halftime
hollywood 7000 season
im throbbins for dobbins boys
god damn i still cant believe i can relax as a ravens fan when we are on offense
i miss sneads hair that was our biggest offseason loss
gotta love a 99 yard touchdown drive
99 yard fucking drive baby
td jk for real though td
ray rice 20 lfg
td j k dobbins
gotta love seeing a guy make his first nfl touchdown what a redletter day for him
every second dobbins reminds me more and more of a bigger ray rice
dobbins is gonna be a problem
i cant believe that the entire browns defense is made of friccin morons

get jkd
td congrats jk
that had to be brutal for those ohio statebrowns fans
rookie punt returner allows the ball to roll to the 1 good
99 yardstheres my offense
first of many for dobbins
love you llama
dobbins earned that touchdown on this drive
outside of the fumble our offense looks great
what a clean drive we looking good
the speed on this team
thats a 9 yardplay average lol were playing fuckin madden
is this pxp shit worth it to anyone im already getting side eye from my wife for spending the whole time on my phone and not watching the game with her

side note my wife is awesome and gets irritated if im not sufficiently present during ravens games
99 yard drive is super encouraging
offense looked great 99 yards rookie td 3rd down conversion almost everyone has caught a pass today too
i dont mean to sound shady but it looked like obj started to run the wrong way before realizing and turned his ass around
marlon take my left shoulder pls
doing a good job of containing chubb today

knocks on wood
damn i forgot how long nfl commercial breaks are
why does david njoku always have good games against us
our dline making their front look like early 90s cowboys o line
queen was so close to a second sack there
anyone know who punts at half
our defense is only going to get better after this game we got a bunch of new guys who never got to gel through real competition give it a couple weeks well be 1
patrick queens explosiveness is amazing he will be a nightmare for qbs
oshit dropped it
oh my god that kick
they brownsd it lmao
odell is so shook against this team lmao fuckin bum
rip their kicker lmao
as much as we shit on them you gotta love the browns
sighbert
browns lmaoooooooooooooooooooo
let kareem hunt kick it
what can we do with 41 seconds
honestly being a browns fan would be terrible
every day thousands of people wake up living in ohio existing as browns fans poor fucks
the browns somehow every year exceed my expectations of how inept they can be makes me so happy that im a ravens fan
i love the browns so much they are so entertaining
guys lamar looks amazing like i knew we knew this would happen but lamar looks amazing please someone inject it into my veins
bad day for browns kicking

hhahahahha
hahaha hahahahaha
theres a dumbass browns fan in here downvoting posts
browns have to be cursed
oh you just hate to see it lads
guys just got back from the browns sub and its on fire love it
lamar was looking deep just now and settled for snead
its like god too hates the browns lol
i think its absolutely laughable how the browns are literally shitting the bed and the announcers are praising them for hanging in there browns gonna brown
im loving how we are throwing this damn ball its so satisfying seeing him do something they say he cant do
llama looks sharp as hell
lamar is a fucking machine bro
lamar jackson
marquise brown is elite
lamar to hollywodd looks so fucking good
lamar is surgical
hollywood with two feet obj landry
lamar is so fucking good what a blessing
what do you define as close for justin tucker
12 sec for this offense may as well be 30
i still cant believe this guy is our quarterback
notice how much room lamar has and hes still throwing the ball
putting on a fucking clinic
touchdownnnnn andrews
how we pay all these ppl
omg they are good
pxp td ravens to andrews
my first born will be a child named lamar
lamar and throwing a td to mandrews at the end of a half against the browns name a more iconic duo
is it too early to say lamar is the goat
how are they gonna figure out who to give mvp too hollywood or lamar
rock paper scissors
mandrews
what a fucking throw
thats not a boy thats a mandrewssssss
mvp
not bad for a running back
damn baker looks defeated lol
fucking hell i love this team
at least 2020 is just like every other year for the browns
69 yards
there we gooooo
best te in football
oh hi mark
lamar
wow lamar just wow
lamars been accurate but the ball itself has looked great all spirals all day
lamar took a couple heavy hits in the first drive and since then they basically said fuck it we will let him sling it

im hoping this actually opens up more rushing lanes
im super sick today this is the best medicine ever lfg boys
bye brownies see you later this year
calling it andrews beats his td total this year already well on his way
lamar is dicing the browns defense up on every single drive this is going to be another fun year for the boys
hahaha yo baker take notes
baker drawing blanks
cant revamp a turd tho
cleveland still bad
i am finally starting to relax and there is a whole half still to go
new guy is so much better than dan fouts
not a good blend on the redwine tackle
now stanley

can we like

not
alright cant score every drive lets see if the d is more locked in
that screen to dunvernay worked we should do more things like that
refs just trying to keep cleveland in this
odell is 14 for 16 yards
bull

shit
i really hate how defensive holding is a 5 yard penalty but an automatic first down
refball coming to save their sorry asses
refs what the fuck
run d gotta stay good
stop marlon

edit andor refs
holding on marlon was definitely a good call pi is questionable
obj with back to back flops classy
these refs missed the browns holding though
just stop
more fucking flags
damn they paid the refs off at ht
3 first downs from flags so far on this drive what the fuck d
refs stop
i get we meme that beckham sucks

but beckham might actually be trash lol
i was like beckham caught a pass wtf thats not allowed and then the ref agreed
juiceman
mp juice man
mp juice man
pxp was wrong on the guess pf face mask on cle
lets ice it out end it now
stanley is hurt
when did stanley go wth
somehow the browns being run by overconfident and clueless ivy league guys is just very fitting
browns fans are turnimg on obj and baker already
shit stanley
ronnie stanley
wow that was amazing for both lamar and mark
its just an ankle injury relax
maybe stanley is just taking it safe since were up quite a bit
willie snead touchdown
jesus lamars passing has improved even more
need iv snead
lamar has dots
need iv snead
lamar just makes it look so easy
wet willie catching tds thats game
today is good day
he is the truth
so jacksons probably got one more possession before the bench him right
hes so good x4
its the browns
browns fans is shambles

so nothing new
stream froze the second lamar released it feels bad
snead is pretty good when he isnt the main wr threat
and brown just waiting on his 9 again
drinking my enemys blood
were killing these fuckers lmao
lamar just sitting on the bench like

man cant believe i have 4 incompletions and we had to punt once
ok is it getting close to bringing in rg3
yall lamar is kinda good
judon very quiet today
half of bakers throws have been out of bounds because hes running for his life or has nowhere to go
baker has thrown more to his sideline than his receivers this game
imagine this teams secondary with the four man rush of the 2014 ravens
joker holy shit
joker smoked his ass
elliot oh my
omg deshon
earl whooooo
earl would never
browns and falling flat on their face in the season opener name a more dynamic duo
pass rush is the only weakness still nobody is beating their man 1v1
peters is proving me very wrong so far hes looking like a great cb regardless of the safety
pass rush still needs to be improved clowney wouldve been nice
thats like the 6th time a defender slides next to baker and cant tackle him down
when we got 6 dbs in they never complete a pass
fuck it send 2 firsts for chase young

we cant afford 2 really good players may as well just get 1
s a c k
tyus bowser makes up for his mistake
great game for bowser thats really encouraging
if we dont find a pass rush by week 3 that games gonna be 5350
tyus playing just like hes in a contract year
bowser makes up for it
we are dominant
dunked into the ground
ill respect baker there for trying his best on that into the monster blitz wellplayed by bowser just sticking to him and wrapping up
holy hell
nintendo man with the sack
baker is a fucking bum
hell thats why we got that big mf
god damn andrews is balling out here
only meaningful thing obj did this year was showing up in drake music video
its gonna be sad having to see some of the guys leave theres no way we can hang on to so many elite players
well thank god burrows and baker are better than big ben like espn told me
sam koch sighting
yall calling 3 and out
i like odell but i wanna see him have a melt down for the greater good
hahahahahahhahahha
dont make fun of the fumble make fun of the play call why are they running down 25
were monsters
start sitting people for the 4th yeah
we got this right
i cant fucking wait for someone to break down queens film
i legit had just made a comment that queen had been mostly quiet

well then
gunpowder gelatine dynamite with a laser beam
i enjoy patrick queen
call stands seven nation army chant
lj
jk lead blocker extraordinaire
vintage jackson
two for dobbins
yea ingrams lost his job lol
the rooks put in full effect
rg3 time
holy shit i dont think we could see a better performance from our rookies debut
time for rg iii
2nd td for the rookie
i may have made a mistake taking ingram over dobbins in my ff lol
rockhard
my apologies to edc for questioning him taking jk in the 2nd round
jk will be the starter soon
havent heard phillips name much todaygood thing for a rookie ol in his 1st
the vision on that run just creeping along behind the line until hes in the end zone

dobbins man
bro elliott just delivers straight shots
any news on stanley
damn fort had the pick
shrunken hulu baker today sad
did he just call him johnny utah
all right now let rgiii in
i feel happiness again
still no rg3 surprising
man the ravens are making it easy to love them
ricard wut r u doin
illegal what
im liking the drone shots of baltimore showing more than just the inner harbor
why isnt rg3 playing rn
how do you not call that a block in the back on the gunner
i like being aggressive and all but i dont get the playcalling on that series at all
x200b

put rg3 in
im cool with still passing the ball but empty sets with an og playing at lt come onat least have a rb to help protect the blindside
duverney is like our secret weapon that nobody knows about because we never need to run the ball

edit oops meant throw
i expected it to be a little closer than this
haha stefanskis like you mean we gotta run another play
gus bus
gus the bus
gus the bus
good to pick up this win today think the next 2 weeks are gonna be rough especially week 3
whats the ou on rgiii sightings this year
what a good win boys good revenge game by the fluke that happened week 3 last year next week i fully expect us to blow out the texans they dont have hopkins to bail them out and their o line is horrendous feel bad for watson next week hes going to get clobbered by our monstars
hay meet barn
how is devin doing
gg
gg
onto houston
mo
shoutout to harbs for letting everyone be themselves


im crying lmao
who all cant stand that tiky tok connercial
fifty yard pass to hollywood trussss
for everyone overreacting please dont this is the first game this season with no preseason with a shortened training camp too relax folks
beckham little fucking pussy bitch
should i walk my dog now before the late games this is over
mos rows give it up for the big man
holy shit enough with these flags
our pass rush sucks even our blitzes are hardly getting any pressure one of our very few weaknesses but its a big one
i had hope for fluker but hes bad as a tackle
boykins cuts arent sharp enough he needs to drive his foot in the ground and get upfield

that lamar pass looked inaccurate but i dont think it was
judon is a non factor i was saying this end of last year he is not worthy of anything above 11 mil
why the browns stay in the locker room they hate unity
what the fuck is happening with our run defense lmao
browns gonna brown lmfao
bruh how u gonna be a professional nfl kicker and missing routine 25 yard kicks even when the browns find a way to play good they mess up
oh how far weve come it would have taken us 2 drives to get to 10 plays both ending in punts back in the ending flacco days
the proud ravens tradition of not being able to fucking wrap up continues in 2020
pxp i have something ive got to do around the house while watching he game cant do more pxp the joys of unpacking from a move
rip mo
get that super bowl for mo
baker might be the 4th best qb in the division maybe lower
browns coaches put on your fucking masks
i had to miss this game to go to a dumbass meeting summarize this game in 5 words or less
its like watching a horse stuck in quick sandyou appreciate how hard they fight but you just now its not gonna end well
i really hope the run blocking this game is just the guys getting used to working with each other looking pretty poop so far
honk honk its a bus bitch
ravens cowboys sb now thats interesting
glad to be back

we are eating brownies today
lets fuckin go
wtf happened to buffstreamz and sportsurge cant weatch the game anywhere
i know its a small sample size and its very early in the ravens season but im worried about how easily they moved the ball against us
calias campbell leads the league in passes defensed truly unprecedented
death taxes marlo with a pick
baker off to a good start i like it
yo why did hodge dodge the ball like that
sports surge down anyone got a link
duuuuuuv
watch duvernay boys
calais campbell is the best defensive signing in years
duverrrnay first down
i like seeing rookies do things
damn we dont need that right now with lamar
hes fucking fast
guys our team is going to be fiiiiiire
ogunjobi is underrated in his contribution to the browns
damn lucky as fuck lol
my stream is so far behind i was sitting in anticipation of the duv 1st down play was nice
that was ugly lmaoooo
lamar josh allen jackson
jarvis landry with the purple hair join us were down
lamar ball security before the toss scared me man
haha wtf was that lamar just playing gta at this point random shit
lamar just hold onto it and keep the first down safe
see lamar trying to do his best reed impression
andrews have my son
classic ed reed okey doke

couldnt have asked for a better start
andrews looks like he lost some weight dude is a beast
cleveland in shambles
lamars been playing too much madden trying to flip the ball in the air
the new fox scoreboard is ugly as hell was hoping theyd dump it after the super bowl
only one drive but i loved the play calling
force a quick turnover then capitalise great way to set the tone early
lets keep it rolling
struck first blood lets go
campbell really dropped into a zone and played it perfectly on that last int hes such a versatile player so glad we have him
i could listen to charles davis all day
tavon young is back
lets go tavon
3 and out
good coverage 25
lmao
that punter got cracked
lol browns

being behind a minute for this stream sucks lmao youre all having fun before i notice
way to see that presnap levine
browns gonna brown
browns are browning
justbrownsthings
that was the most browns shit ive holy shit im still recovering


fucking lol
cant get a stream to work at the moment what happened
a lot of respect between the players
would have rather had 7 but ill take 3
browns already in midseason form i see
its ok lamar we also have justin

harbaugh
i thought fluker was announced the starter a week or so ago when the depth chart came out
we just struggle against chubb
i knew this play was bad we were confused
wake up defense
ooph thats some preseason tackling
i dig the browns helmet addition looks good classy way of showing respect

man first time i use classy and browns in the same sentence probably the last time too
oh boy we need some run d week 1 jitters hopefully
buck allen has a touchdown lmao
we still cant stop outside runs
chuck is taking some terrible angles on these run pursuits
yikes thats where we miss a suggs type player so strong against the edge run
thanks to this fanbase for being so nice and welcoming
good series by the browns lets hold them to 3
baker is so goofy looking when he moves around
wow wide open
damn it that was a golden opportunity
ran to set up the pass classic strategy
doink
lol
doink
so browns much fail
you aint tucker lmao
thank god he missed
if they are gashing us like this in the run game then were gonna need a lot of fuckin points
d fell asleep on that drive come on man get that shit together
i like this guy
dont look now but do we have a serviceable returner
holllywooooooood
duvernay has been pretty nice so far
wow duvernay is a savage i love it
we got us one in duvernay
hollywood
what a fucking dot
what a throw
hell of a throw
hollywood
what a fooking throw
bomb boys are back
holllllllllllywooooooooooooood
thats the offseason work there
consider you hoes stunted upon
hollywood
wooooow
hollywood
wow what a catch by hollywood and also by hayden hurst
holllyyyyyywoooooooooooooooooooooooood
hollywood
i think this is the best thing about this team now if we have been a little shaky we have guys like lamarhollywood who can take back the momentum
i luv this offense so much
hollywoooooood
damnit ricard

really way too fancy we have like 4 rbs give it to them
why hand off to ricard
ofc its garret hate that guy
fuckkk
he never had a good grip on the ball
fuck
thats not ideal
pat
god fucking dammit
god fucking damnit
not really ricards fault the oline got blown up
defense gotta answer back
the power and experience of ingram outweighs the surprise of handing to ricard imo dont get cute
all good truzz
id like to see us put some fucking pressure on baker
this sucks but we are rusty af the fact we are still winning is good
damn this is actually a good game not one punt yet
give edwards some carries
im fine with never giving ricard another carry there thanks
ingram edwards dobbins lets give the ball to pat ricard
89 yards a play from chubb isnt the look d pick it up
fuck man defense has got to stand up
lamar shouldve hd the ball not ricard
our run defence is so suspect
im really hoping this is just rust and not what our dline will be going forward we seems ill prepared to fight the run and our pass rush seems mia
where has odell been in the bathroom
our pass rush is still our biggest weakness
odell beckham might be the biggest wasted talent in the league
common judon
dumbass judon
yep thatll do it killing me judon
you have to be fucking kidding me not marlo
judon what the heck
judon with the dumb as fuck penalty right on queue
x200b

matthew body built by taco bell judon roughing the passer penalty
jfc
of course its judon
that was dumb as fuck
and theres the stupid judon penalty right on cue
fuckk what happened to humphrey
what the fuck judon
averett is in gg
defense looks shit guys
not humphrey wtf
not humphrey
i was doing my nails in my room and came out to watch the game right before our field goal im sorry i jinxed the team
i just want to go back to that 3rd down fumbler for a second are you fucking kidding me roman we won motherfucking 14 games last year never handing the ball to a fullback in short yardage what a terrible face call
good call obvious facemask
id rather lose by 40 to the browns rn than lose marlon
oh man that shouldve been a pick
me

internoooo
3rd and 35
why do we play down to the browns level
come on clark wtf
a sack
clark needs to hit the jugs machine
baker is still garbage love to see it
get on the ground bitch
come on chuck you gotta have that
oh we needed that
3rd and 41
lol
just need 41 yards for a first
yaaaaaas queen
3rd and 41 if theres an illegal contact penalty ill shit
turnover hurt but the d stood up it could be worse
good job d
lightning mc queen
judon lucky the browns didnt want to take advantage of that stupid rtp
harrison looks nice
pass rush looks so much stronger than last year
humphrey please come back
3rd 41 ya love to see it
haha haha what is this game
see what happens when you let your punter punt and dont doom him with a run
wtf
baker gets dumped bro i thought that was odell
thank god for gus
99 yard td drive incoming nbd
what a great call to get it right back to ricard love that coaching
the farve sidearm
the passing game looks amazing rn
im liking this drive
we are so deep at rb
keep rowling rowling rowling
kids a fucking stud
dobbins looks like a star
meanwhile the washington football team is showing why their fans chose wrong
j k all day
that is a response right there
lamar looks better if thats even possible
get yours dobbins good job kid
jk
our rookies are already making plays
lets fuckin go jk
very encouraging to see the offense move the ball so crisp we make a mistake but come back and rectify it

and fantastic to see the rookies balling it out today
dobby

sock

collision course
way to go dobbins that was a great drive only thing i wish they used a little more time but if the d can stand up we might be able to score again before the half
the neon lights on baltimore
every shadows getting famous
in some backyard in some plastic chair
hoping these cigarettes will save us
here we go again here we go again
dobbins is elite
that is what ive missed all offseason
how many different rushers and receivers that drive gd
can someone explain why we use judon in coverage so much
jersey mikes is decent for a franchise hoagie place
any word on humphrey
i hate that i have to watch this on stream stupid corona and the bars all i get is jetsbills and phillywash
queen must play with 150 gravity
pxp drop by beckham for what would have keen a 3rd down conversion seriously 2 hands right in front of his face no defender on him
lol odell
good
hahaha
thank god
lol
what a treat their kicker
missed it suck it
gg browns kicker keep up the good work
browns fans on suicide watch
lol browns
lmaoooooo
why do we hate the browns again they seem to be our greatest ally hahaha
browns are gonna brown
lmaooooooo just browns things
imagine practicing with one hand all the time then missing a wide open catch on a crucial third down
hahahahaha how could you leave that 2min drive with 0 pts
dont to forget to thank god we have tucker and arent the browns
lol obj and lol seibert
takitaki i think ive eaten that fish
this game has been a lot closer than the scoreboard suggests the browns keep failing to capitalize after several great plays
the big thing im noticing is that our receivers are catching
dont worry siebert everyone cant be justin tucker
good job hollywood lamar looking sharp
bro its week 16 all over again
lamar is fucking surgical today
i love that even with masks on the coaches still instinctively hide their mouths with call sheets
this is exactly what i wanted to see from lamar
our guys are getting wide open lamar might throw for 4000 this year lol
lets get a td folks
yeah
yeah well kick the xp


mandrewsss
mandrews again
b2b mvp
and we get the ball after halftime fuuuck me
thats a grown ass mandrews
lamar have my children
mvp
manfuckingdrews
that play calling was top tier
lets go boysssss thats my freaking qb
ravens hit the browns hard to end the half yet again
i love the car dealership things
andrews
69 yard drive nice
the rest of the nfl is so fucked
havent missed a fuckin beat lets go
same old sorry ass browns
lmao browns 246 you love to see it
did cowher just say something about this being the preseason
what the hell happened to obj he used to have stickum hands
um guys watching redzone at half and every other stadium is 10x louder than our stadium why
lol thanks cleveland
i really like dobbins in his limited action looks very explosive and quick
pxp great punt locked in the side at the 20
hollywood has 100 yards with a 20 yard average
stanley pls be ok
man we could have ended this game with that drive lets go d
did something happen to ingram looks like dobbins is getting all the snaps
stanley having his left anklefoot looked at on the sideline
theyve gotta expect the blitz on 3rd and long dont know why the keep motioning the rb out keep the extra blocker or have lamar roll out
is it me or does obj just look like he doesnt care
browns last won a season opener in 2004 sad
omg these pass interference calls
can we just stop with the flags what the fuck
beckham getting sond dude couldnt catch that shit
lol beckham sold that
that ball was not catchable at all
at least we can stop the run
meh not the worst hold couldve been uncalled
i know they just got two penalities but they cant be serious rn lol marlon is on his ass
x200b

baker mayfield has a beer belly
wow wtf refs
pxp awesome pass coverage for inc by bowser
humphreys might have to choke a punk soon
hell yeah calais
nice break on that by bowser
i fucking love these graphics ripping the browns lmao
omfg stop fucking holding
what the fuck
are the refs tryna make this a game come on
enough with the penalties
jesus fucking christ refs
refs have cleveland 75
can we notplease
tavon no baby why
tavon literally held that dude down the field lol
the browns have done nothing to keep this drive going our defense is the 2nd best offense on the field today
clean it up fellas
ha beckham
pxp throw away after good pressure
lowkey amazing to me that the browns have been gifted so many penalty yards and they still havent gotten north of midfield
mp juice man
mp juiceman
mp juice man
pass rush is showing up finally
good play peters
mp juice man
odell getting clowned today
juiceman
beckham had to play db there
fluker coming in something happened to stanley
hey guys stop bitching all of those flags were legit so blame the players who are committing the penalties not the fucking refs
turning into a penalty fest
browns fans are experiencing the actual abuse part of the cycle of abuse right now
juiceman
facemask all over that play
peters so close to picking that too
ah que mi sendejo pendejo
refball
stupid plays by defense but respect got 3 separate stops in the same drive didnt get demoralized
lets see if were totally fucked with fluker at lt
landry was carving us up and they just decided to ignore him to try to please obj for the rest of the game
stanleyll be alright ice up
andrews what a pass
oh that was perfect
fluker holding his own
andrews is a cheat code
lamar to andrews does not miss
mandrews is a god
andrews is the anchor lamar needs
browns really will never be good lol
snead td
lamar
thats my quarterback lol
bro lamar is a god and people still hate
jeeez lamar this is a good start to my week
sneeeeeaad
zoo wee mama lamar jackson lookin hot
i am going full kekekeke at browns
lol browns why does this team get hype
great to see lamar come back so strong after such a disappointing end to last season premature but already looking forward to seeing lamar go off this year in the playoffs and take this team places
i really respect the browns d line the secondary not so much if the ravens hit their blocks then lamar is going to work some magic
prayer circle for marlon ronnie
even his throwaways look stupid
oh shit they remembered landry is their only good receiver
cant wait to watch bengals vs browns on thursday night
did lenny moore pass away they did a montage a few minutes ago then didnt comment on it
my gawd
marcus peters is one more big play from laying someone out with some sweet chin music
omg
that was a strong safety play
obj gettin pissed lmao
the joker sighted
s m i l e
i feel like the browns biggest problem was they tried to force it to odell so much the last few drives landry seems to have our number pretty good but of course odells personality gets in the way of the team
oh wow elliot did something
damn it i hate when they get first downs
earl thomas shines deshon elliots shoes
dude ran right past mayfield lol
defense out here trying to make sure lamar gets another drive smh
wtf is this 3rd and long wide open zone bullshit
guys this is preseason week 1 we still have to play 3 more preseason games before we can see how teams figured lamar out by watching an entire year of tape on him
can we get them off the field please
thats a pass rush nice play to get yards
odell just looks dejected
humphrey gonna make this his breakout in the media year fucking boss
baker is literally too stupid to just throw that away i love it lol
b o w s e r
bowser is quietly having the best game of his career love to see it
bowser that is how you make up for your mistake
man if we could get a consistent pass rush itd be a wrap thats the only thing i feel is a little lacking from us
were rolling now boys
unfortunate time for obj to put up a stinker
big monsters named bowser and destroying tinyen with mustaches

name a more iconic duo
finally some pressure
makes up for the penalty woooo
one more td and then rg3 time
bakers going to be looking for a new team come february guarantee it
wtf is that tua razor commercial
bowser has looked really good today
alright your team is pretty good god damn
defense looks damn good right now lets go get another one lamar
that tua ad was cool
andrews is a stud
browns fans turning on mayfield in other game threads asking for keenum lol
mandrews hands too good
i will say in defense of our pass rush maybe its possible the browns actually have a decent oline or maybe its just rust
browns asking if they can forfeit
drop 40 for mo
dj fluker has been solid against myles garrett

fuckin nuts
i hope ronnie is fine for next week because our offensive line isnt nearly as good without him also obj is getting exposed in his pass protection
did they just say someone was out due to a lacerated liver
nice
fumble recoveryy lets gooooooo
ust
browns gonna brown
lj fort the gift that keeps on giving nicely done big dick decosta
im enjoying this
what did queen do i missed it
the yahoo app stream started playing tons of baker commericals haha
queen legit put himself in front for droy
that was a mans strip right there
not enough there i hope to over turn
queen
queen
queen good
feel bad for ingram today hasnt really been able to breakout today
lamar good
almost added a rushing td to the resume
jk not joking around
jk no were not kidding
rgiii time
lamars like a cat
dobbins is having a heckin first nfl game
fuck the browns forever man 38 points isnt enough
surprisingly the rushing offense hasnt looked particularly special today
wow what a run
yes sir
another td for the rookie
this organization man top to bottom first class lets fucking go
fml i started ingram he still my boy tho
its bob time baby
baker looks like he plays exactly like that manlet from the hulu commercials
is the ravens browns stats broken on the nfl website it still shows 00 score for me
campbell is kinda good
big boy knockdown
wow baker is ass
anyone streaming this game through some service what can i do to watch this on an xbox
i want a tub for hollywood
i got to say those drone shots of the city are really nice
hey guys quick question who has the green dot for the ravens defense is it chuck clark
illegal what these refs
so many rigged calls
crack back block in 2020 are you kidding me
take out the starters it aint worth it right now
up 32 and that hit we should probably have jackson take the rest of the day off
i always super trust 15 yard calls when they dont show a replay
jihad ward has played as well as anyone on that line
lol colts drops one to the jags
jeez edwards almost busted out
bus
can you place a bet on whether stefan kevinskis gonna be fired before or after the season ends
edwards still looking explosive
daydream yes please
i dont love those toss plays i feel like it takes the cutback ability from the back so the defence only has to defend half the field
my stream has been booty since the half stanley ok
obj crying on the sideline
10
any word on stanley injury im seeing ankle questionable not much more is it serious
w
nice game boys
that was a lot of fun
i love marvin humphreys more than some family members
im so jealous of you guys you chose the last guy on the board for 2016 draft qbs and ended up with the best one one is a back up two already have turnovers and sam has 3 3 and outs lamar already has a td lmao nfl scouts suck
hahahahahahahahahahahahhaah were still allergic to defending the run
starting to get a little worried about our run defense hopefully its just first game jitters
now i know why edc wanted clowney
llama laser to hollywood
pathetic 3rd and short and taking ball out of lamars hand or ingrams
jk you friggin moron
onions onions everywhere
mos watchin from above
baker may suck at football but at least hes a great dancer
thats the second time andrews caught a pass with his penis
take the starters out
with no preseason expect lamar out there all game gotta get live reps in
put rgiii in
get my man rgiii in for the forth i like watching him do well and i want lamar safe
fuck trump
why are political ads even a thing
this game feels long
baker laughing during the anthem

lamar has started games throwing a little high sometimes hell bring em down next drive also andrews continues to be one of the best tes in the league
anyone have a free link to watch
hahahahahaha
missing that extra point is just browns football
dude i was like who is already down there of course its hollywood
ricard is great for blocking and check downs he shouldnt be running when weve got ingram gus and dobbins
pls score offense im already stressing hard after that to
duvernay proche
yall really be whining too much
would simp for dobbins
elliots gonna need to learn fast
there seems to be a lot of fake ass 2019 era new fans in here gdt was never anywhere close to this active before
why am i still shaking with anxiety and its only the first game of the season oh thats right were ravens fans
these niggas are different lets gooooo
mar gotta call that blitz out next time
hell yea god bless moe
mo
super bowl for mo
i wouldnt mind a lil rg

lessgo
i know its wrong to say but kinda glad hill out for this game never really felt like he was anything special excited to see what dobbins does
i dont like the lack of audience but its cool how there not being an audience makes it feel like more a personal fight between the two teams that about to start
we back lets go flock

why are we wearing white when were the home team
tucker is pumped up

the downside of no crowd is that we cant shout baker the bust after every aborted drive
ay what up anybody got a stream

we are eating brownies today
jets had a 3 and out before i even pulled up the stream guess im joining you all for most of the season to save myself from sadness

just cleveland things lol
fort killed that play singlehandedly
lolololol idiots
you know co caps going to come up with that
im growing to like this stefanski character
fucking lmaooooo

lolbrowns
that was a really dumb decision for them if im the browns i try to kick it to the rookie and try to pin us back
hahahahhhahhaaaaaahhahahaaaa
stunt on these hoes
looool browns
lmao guess theyre getting it out the way early
our defense lit
props to lj there for killing the blocker and then the punter
wtf on their own 30 and they lost yards lmaooo

ingram didnt cut inside there

fort

what a play
that black visor is so fucking sick
damn o line looking a little weak rn hoping its just rust
oline showing some growing painsrust
jt money man
the cleveland miscue
ugh offense isnt firing the way id like passing game needs to be better
anyone got a different stream than crack stream im getting 5 fps on 90 download
jarvis landry is so good man imo better than odell
why are we still running lamar up the middle
cant watch the game hows the defense looking without earl
brandon williams was held so obviously refs dont wanna throw flags
marcus peters loves whiffing on those
dont like to see that but i have faith baker will fuck something up shortly
having no pass rush yet again bruh wtf
run defense and tackling very poor rn
tackling tackling tackling
yo elliot got fucking blown up
zero rush

what did we pay judon for
still cant get to the qb it seems
no pass rush no run d
wtf the d line is not living up to the hype
miss communication lead to this bend but dont break
hunt just kicked us in the chin
run defense gettin worked early
tackling looking very suspect
oof fooled them completely
you can actually hear the players talking with fans
that was a great play call by stefanski tbh
lol still the browns
lol
brownies lol
thank god the browns are the browns or id be a little worried
come on guys all baker is good for is commercials lets answer here
devin durvernay is gonna be very good

ick lets take it back boys
its so surreal to have no fans there
what the fuck was that were gonna let them back in the game with our mistakes
i wanna see malik light someone up
that sucks
getting too cute with the play calling when you have the best running team in the league
terrible play why ricard
this team has always loved making dumb mistakes to let cleveland stick around
twidling my thumbs trying to find a way to watch this stupid game

why does the nfl make it so hard id frickin pay but directtv isnt viable so i cant do sunday ticket blarg
d needs a stop here
i cant watch but im on lunch can i get a quick recap of how we look
i know this seems bad its week 1 no pre late padded practise stuff like this is expected hell browns did it
there is no pass rush what so ever
run defense is some shit
our dline is unable to do anything right atm
is odell playing
goddamnit dont whiff on that
b washington is not doing anything
could tell that was going to landry the second peters peeled off to cover hunt
not on marlon buddy
80 yards already on the ground
odell beckham sr getting in some quality time with his other son jarvis
i swear one of mayfields presnap calls was pringles
we need some pressure on mayfield
their ol looks good we cant get pressure on baker
hope edc got matthews on the phone
welp
dammit
fuuuuuuk didnt need that
i hope hump is ok
judon with another boneheaded penalty smh
bruh moment
well this is quickly going down hill
4th 1 and we give them 15 yards nice
whyd we resign judonguy is soo dumb and just a loudmouth
and our best cb hurt cool
honestly a fair call gotta be more cognizant of that
no no no no no no no no no no no no no not humph fuck no not averrett
make up penalty
thatll do it ill take it dumb play for judon for dumb play from odell
if marlon is out put jimmy outside not averett
good job mp
our line is going blown up every play
time to choke obj i see
whos wearing 23
chuck nooooo
comeon clark damn where is reed
why are we friends with the browns
in his hands oh clark
clark that was a gimme
clark why
judson shit i just gave up 15 yards

obj i gotchu fam
queen
3rd and forever is nice
queen shit
d finally waking up
there we go d now no stupid penalties please
implosion we all expected to see at least one today lol
agghhh chuckie looks like obj played decent defense there
thank yall for the pxp
if they convert this first down so help me god
queeeeeeeeeeen
thats my queen
no binehead penaltirs
brownest drive ever
3rd and 41 lol
marlon is questionable to return
ok pat
and that momentum went right back to us
3rd and 41 lmaooo
3rd and 1000000000
browns recover fumbleaaaand then do some browns shit
if they get this i swear to god
caribbean queen
do another fake punt browns
smhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
are you kidding me this is a good game right now if not a little silly xd
fair catch
any word on humph
the scottish hammer got them flowing locks
i love football boys
marlo questionable to return
looking like there was no preseason for sure lots of dumb mistakes interesting to see how browns have mostly contained lamar will probably mean lots of 1 on 1 downfield which has obviously already worked out for us
no matter the outcome of the game if humphrey is seriously hurt it is a major l for our chances this season
marlon is questionable he looks fine
wasnt lamar good at throwing deep last year i thought his biggest issue was outside the numbers
he went back to ricard nice
white jerseys purple pants looks really sharp
that boykin catch
brown was out in space on that one
damn boykin looks fast as hell
protip for anyone using nonus game pass with a vpn south koreas internet infrastructure is fantastic
lamar is dotting them up right now
pxp hollywood wideopen across the 50 lamar with a great pass after a scramble and bad rb running into lamar
you cant spell lamar without a r m
side arm pass

miles boykin

nice
woof that was a sexy little flick to boykin
boykin is my favorite raven just think theres so much potential
boykin big things this year
finally we see some dobbins
great fuckinf drive
give it to gus
pxp 2nd and 5 dobbins like 10 to the 25
jk
lamar carving up the defense
pxp ingram for 2
jk up the middle
jk all day
please just fix the run defense
you get a catch you get a catch everyone gets a catch
lamar is a generous qb he makes sure all his children mouths are fed
nice to see all of our targets being used
that last connection to brown showcased the chemistry lamar and marquise developed in the offseason brown adjusted
jk dobbins touchdown lets go
feed the snead
99 yard drive lfg
duck yeah jk
dobbins
jk all day
dobbins wears that 27 well
nice form getting across the line without the knee going down td and pat lol browns
it should be criminal we got such a great rb in jk
we have our man guys jk is it ingram gonna be our clutch starter and jk is the goto love this rotation
i may already be married but im gonna have to warn my wife about dobbins
beautiful
the magical jk dobbins with the tudder
jks first td
alright all is forgivenfor now lets go
great rest for the defense to run their 2 minute drill now
jk
that was a drive
jaykaaaaay
thats it baby first of many welcome to the team jk
jk dobbins a player so great we named an island on the magothy after him decades before he was born
keep the ball rook
great job rooks
speed team
time for a joker interception
was that jamal stiff arming ed reed
gang gang gang lol
pxp 2m warning after no gain run
marlo back in thanks talos
why did it have to be marlon tt
just got here how has everyone looked
hows the joker doing
pxp jump ball to nojokeu over tavon to the baltimore 31
i wonder if this game would be different with fans at the bank
defense really struggling right now
run defense is doing good this drive
the fuck was all that
thats like the 3rd time elliot was way too deep
just keep them from getting 7 points
im a jerk but im laughing njoku oughtta go over and give him a quick lesson
fuck yea lmao
lets go
2 dropped ball
brownsydrome
man couldnt even hit the kicking net
and lmfao clowns
cleveland is a special team
lmao obj
hhahahhahaaaa
home girl should have used one hand lol
i think they shouldve gone for it since we get the ball and still have 40 seconds left 2 tos anyways to maybe move with

guess in the end they get fucked because they miss lol
obj career will never be the same
pxp jackson to sneed at the 41 to
oh shit when did they add the preseason game back in
65 yard td to miles boykin incoming
love to see it
yesss willie hes been v consistent
extra special teams
lololol
browns and shitting the bed name a more iconic duo
wooooooooow
oof feels bad for the guy
that could have been a really nasty hit on the browns own players ahh i cringed a bit
oof if they were playing anyone else id feel bad for them
hahahahahaha
brown is having a day
yea hollywood
pxp awesome slip out of a pass rush by lamar pass to brown at the 15 or 20 andrews at the 10
lamar doesnt have accuracy
llama with the sideline dart noice
i lovw this team
we are already in tucker range
fuck the browns
goddamn the lamar to hollywood connection gets my blood pumping
why is justin tucker so sexy im not even gay
llama out here throwin darts lfg
dawg lamar is making strikes
the passing game looks filthy rn
lamar so accurate
hollywood is really turning into an anchor in the wr position hes showing up all over the field
lamar makes it look so easy
shiiiiit hollywood is amazing
hollywood 100
pxp 12s left after incompete
i cant believe how sharp the passing game is right now week 1 is off to a great start
10 in a row for my goat
you guys are slaughtering the browns holy shit
i really like charles davis hes a fun guy
chunk plays now
commentary jinx on 10 straight comp
jacksonbrown connection is nice
boykin you dropped it
mandrews x 2
andrews again woooohooo
mandrews the ball magnet
the beast strikes again
methodical
andrews is having quite the day
andrews x2
lets gooo
perfect ball
browns might want to cover that andrews guy
i am still coming to grips with the ravens having a dynamic offense
mandrews with 2 tuddies
back to old trusty for the td haha
i love this team
cant wait to see rg3
i drafted lamar 2 overall in fantasy

no ragrets
touchdown raveeeeeeens
lets go
same old browns
fight on you baltimore colts oh wait
i love this team
that was as perfect of a drive before the half i have ever seen lamar just tearing them apart hollywood making the laid and mandrews putting the cherry on top
snead is poised for a sneaky good year think he was put in a bad spot last year like duvernay but think hes gonna mostly be a gadget player to start
fuck the browns though
that bright red suit with a blue shirt doesnt work
pxp flag on ok return face mask on cle
pxp dobbins smacked on 3 yd run
dobbins starting second half
pxp lowbehind throw to boyle incomplete
thats the only part of our game that gets me nervous hopefully duv is solid
can odell just be traded so this saga goes away he doesnt fit in
oh shit i forgot about rg3
we needed that drive but lets go defense
what a fucking punt
some of these amplified sound effects are hilarious


the browns player going eurghghgghh trying to run back that kickoff was hysterical
stanley looked hurt
im feeling an interception this drive
what the hell is pxp
he didnt want to make excuses but just so you know literally everything he did wrong was because of the injuries
we really have odell beckham sr on this team
thats my queen
pxp waaaaay overthrown to obj deep flag
odell looks like he wants to walk off the field and retire
keep trying marlon odell
bullshit
ok idiots stop
and all the flags
bullshit
lol refs
pxp 1y run to chubb
odell sold that if you cant catch you can always flop
was that even remotely close to catchable
obj is just getting pissed because his potential hof career is going down the drain in cleveland
run d is starting to look better
beckham playing like a worse torrey smith
okay that first one may have been there but that second one was fucking bullshit
humph making a couple small mistakes might be his usual physical play style or making up for his shoulder
bruh
so much bullshit
pxp holding on young for a free 1st down on 3rd and9
browns have to get back in this game somehow
what was that tavon
run defense looking better
what pity flags now

edit dangit tavon
i see so they can tackle our dl but we cant touch their wrs all of a sudden
thats a soft call they both had hands on each other
defense really shitting the bed keeping this drive alive for them
cleveland yellows
defense stop being so sloppy with these penalties
what is you doing young
obj getting pissed
refs trying to keep the game close i see
terrible call my god
haha no field presence by the turd lover
besides the queen sack and judon roughing penalty have we even touched mayfield
bowser balling in the contract year like clockwork
surprised the refs didnt give him that like they gave him all those bullshit flags
ferguson was on his ass
great stop peters
pxp 3rd and 10 pressure to inc thanks to peters on obj
you know odell is heated
ferguson looked pretty surprised that he went free lol
peters wasnt too far from hauling that one in
great pressure by ferguson
i love mp
finally
juiceman
mp juiceman
juiceman wanted that
these flags are bullshit wtf refs
lol is obj just the ultimate heel
nvm that flag helped us lol
refs u were so good 1st half what are you doing
stanley is questionable to return
everyone i bet on getting their asses kicked so far thankfully i laid off the ravens lol
stanley injured marlon banged up dont like this these two are irreplaceable
that pile on the last sack it looked like lamar was worried about stanley when he went back hope he didnt get rolled too bad
ronnie is fine not worried
stefanski realizing how bad cleveland is
stanley is out so the oline is about to get eaten alive
my gawd mandrews
absolute dime
mandrews like a motha fucka
damn andrews is a beast
omg what a throw
big boy no lil boy
andrews is a fucking man
thats a nice ass pass
i love how mark does the salt bae for a celebration
lets see andrews get a 3rd td
mandrews
mandrews
lamar going mvp again
lamar to andrews is such a fucking insane combination
stanley being questionable is a kick in the dick
mark andrews is a bad bad man i want to get his jersey but last time i did they left the team cj
andrews is elite af
protect mandrews
fluker did well there
we dont need stanley to kill the brown
fuxking dime
stanley being questionable means its nothing serious long term probably
sneaaaaaaad
lama so good
god i love you lamar
mvp mvp mvp
need for snead
fluker playing well
snneeeeeeeeeeeeead
snead
yoo
not bad for a rb
pouring it on now boyz fuck yea snead

lamar jackson
how shit are the browns
lamar looking realllly comfortable in the pocket
i know hes a llama but hes also a goat

but these are the browns
jarvis landry is just a good football player
our pass rush aint shit whew
lets go elliot
browns hold
mp is hyped the fuck up i love it
jokerrr
he was such a locker room cancer
took almost 3 whole quarters to talk about it

im impressed
more like kareamed hunt
jesus hunt almost had his head ripped off lol
pads are popping now baby smart plays lets go no penalties
honestly i love our team
its 4th down you know they are trying to get you off sides how do you fall for it
lel

browns

nice sack but mayfield should have gotten rid of that looong before he hit the grass
tyus lets goooooooo take his lunch money
big oof
browns gonna brown
doo doo browns
this is so good
sorry mayfield mario aint saving you from bowser
does anybofy know how i can watch this game apparantly i cant on hulu
thats the 2nd dick catch by mandrews
bro we had to stay down for this team fr
night and day without yanda we gotta gel before kc to run effectively
batting an int out if the safetys hands lol

thats a classic browns gfy
bad idea to throw that but meh
oh boy that was dangerous
not sure what lamar was throwing at there
lamar im calling
stop right now
little stuff like that id like to see lamar grow on but meh didnt cost us
whoa lamar lets just chill now youre acting like baker on that play
lj trying the arm punt out
woof lamar i love and hate that bad decision but i love the fact that hes trying that hard to score again
fumble lol
browns gonna brown
lets go
im so happy that the turnover didnt even get me excited just one long high all game
more tds
queen
lets go
gotta feel bad for that browns olineman getting chubbs knee right in his back just ouch
i think if you sync them up side by side hes not down

i dont know why they dont show that stuff live
im gonna go ahead and say i was wrong about queen hes been pretty excellent so far after the first couple of plays forcing a fumble vs chubb is vetlevel play
gentlemen what a pleasure this season will be
i like the ravens
lamar almost td what acceleration
dobbins for two lfg
jk starting week 4
its rg3 time
i hope proche gets some snaps
this is how you come back from that loss
what a statement
tick tock motherfuckers
elliot has been delivering some serious punishment today
okay garbage time is gonna be awesome without fans you can hear these guys just having fun out there now
elliott and clark looking pretty good back there
great stop
why does google need ads
was the dunkin donuts deal for a free medium iced coffee on ravens game day with the app
lets get it
lamar still out

love this shit
marquise hollywood brown today

56 101 yds 202 avg
why
lol week 1 has been great for a few years now also whenever we play miami
where are these deep shots we wanted to take this year
what was the flag on cox
ferguson is very active
what a nice play by chuck on that faked the drop and timed it perfectly
come on rg3 show us what you got
they look so surprised every time we blitz lol like you gotta expect it at this point
the bus
gus bus
gus
that doinked pat really tripped them up
love the odell shot
perfect opening game boys so happy to see what our boys have been working on
gg boys lets keep it rolling in houston
foh with that blonde ass hair

let duvernay field everything proche is a joke
lamar jackson
crowd noise sounds so fake
where the hell is hollywood
doink
weird off season give our d some time
lots of time for our d to adjust but theyre looking disorganized talented but lostsloppy
get the 1st damn it
deep ball wow what a play lets go


starting to shut down the run but letting too many of these big pass plays
mandrews is legitimately underrated in the league who are you taking over him hes like a kelce clone but younger
browns special teams coach is not having a good time right now
yesss willie
bro i was just so happy and you hit me with this
mo
we need more pass rush
lets see rg3
yea ingram is gonna get fazed out
very little gus the bus today
the new d line is largely underwhelming
defense looks like dogshit
lamar throwing away i wanted to see show maturation as a passer and try to make the passing play would love 7 but points is points
i miss the purple jerseys guys were home wear our colors please
why are we playing 15 yards off nick chubb
calais campbell was definitely worth that 5th lol
dangerous as hell but thats a td if ingram makes that catch
the browns d line is really good though
is queen even on the field
defense gotta tighten up
duvernay poppin off
shit thats a huge momentum shift
x200b

thanks patrick ricard
if i dont see someone absolutely destroy mayfield soon
fuck judon

garrett looks scary and their defense is solid
thought there was a hold
looks like queen got caught in the scramble
d line still isnt there
damn chubb
i forgot how good chubb is as a running back
omfg
harrison way out of position on that run
chubb gashing the defesnse
i really hated that run somebody needs to do a better job on backside contain

both defense and offense look rusty tbh only special teams looks 100
defense clearly didnt jell yet
lol siebert
defense needs to communicate better lead to the long chubb run because campbell wasnt set
i dont know this is pretty shitty field position us
forgot how to stop the run there harrison misplayed that long chubb run so bad on the edge
hollywood

duverney is showing me something early
hollywood
excellent pass
bombs away
boom
hollywood
hollywood
holy hell we finally have a good kick returner
hollywood holy fuck i love the sight of that
mvp
hollywood
ive always wondered how that works when you have the ball out is it not considered forward progress until youre down when are you considered down when you step out or when the ball crosses the sideline
i never worry about these 3rd down situations anymore because i know we have 2 plays to get a yard and well good luck stopping that defenses
fuck
a healthy hollywood is a scary man
damn
damn ricard
fuck
fuck man
heart just hurts
pat are you fucking kidding me
lol wow
why even have that formation make it so obviously a run up the gut
yea no preseason is showing we look rusty
even ricard was surprised by that
what happened i just flipped back from
the eagles game and the browns have the ball
fuck
and thats why trying to get your converted dt more involved in teh offense is a bad fucking idea
what the fuckkk

obj has been real silent today
all i ask is to get out with a win and no injuries its week 1 we will look better soon
mayfield has all day damn
oof really worried about our run d
shit play call but that was god awful play design too against how that dline was stacked up didnt matter if it was ricard or anyone else you cant expect to hang onto the ball when you have half a second to secure it
holy fuck that whiff
god fucking damn it why ricard whyyy
landrys good odell is trash lmao
fuck no landry
the announcers want the browns to be good so bad they sound low key disappointed every time they fail
you cant call yourself the monstars get gashed
they targeted elliot on that one
judon is frustrating dude should be better or am i overreacting ugh
someone needs to step up on the inside sooner or later
good couple stops
first flag of the game
everytime i see jihad ward out there the run d looks better
well damn
cmonn judon
can someone do a play by play
are you kidding me
wtf judon

x200b

damn wish that would have floated to peters instead
we are just bantering at this point lmao
pxp deep sack by mcphee for 6 edit maybe p queen
beckhams halfhearted attempt to swat that ball was lol
you know for a guy who runs his mouth odell sure is a nonfactor on this offense
stefanski looks like brad stevens and i fucking hate it
queen
chuck noooooooo
yesss always nice to see mayfield get sacked
lol its only like 3rd and 36
obj on the field
harrison making a great play in man coverage
goota hold on to those chuck
great play harrison unfortunately clark is afraid of getting tackled lol
nice tip by malik but why did wink put him on beckham
lets go queen

watch for the fake
brain fart
had to change a diaper what happened to marlo
is that a permed mullet
any live streams
cant you block the fielder on those
very bad decision proche
wtf why would he leave it that far out jesus
marlon humphrey shoulder is questionable to return
its easy to get caught up in a play by play basis but i think overall we arent playing that terribly im not calling for any heads yet
pxp 2 yard run on 1st and 10 from the 1
lack of preseason is really showing

chuck with the easy dropped pick

proche with an absurd choice to not field the punt

pat with a bad fumble on a worse play call on 3rd and inches
ricard redemption
air we go pat
anyone else thinking baker is looking really awful missing receivers all over although weve been in position to make plays hes just putting balls out of anyones catch radius
this is expected we had no preseason well figure it out were obviously the better team offense is moving the ball and will continue to just need to give the defense rest
that was slickkkk
boykin sighting
thats just an mvp we have right there friends
i know the jets are fucking putrid but god damn letting buffalo put up 20 on you already
there you go project pat
that was dope
i like that boykin
hollywood
god i love lamar
thank god he held onto it looked kinda shaky on that catch
lamar just doing mvp things
offense moving well
big boi boykin
offense is looking great
big man ricard fighting out there
beautiful sidearm on the run
scorching down the field
lmao that gus edwards thing turned out ok
making it look easy
the is the offensive i like to see
hell of a play by lamar and boykin
llama out here just having a good time
pxp dobbins gets 5
were marching down the field and gonna get in back at the half love it
nice back to back run
are are the baltimore ravens actually throwing to set up the pass
roll with the hot hand
did they ever pan to section 146
yesss willie
brown is playing more aggressively i love it
forgot about willie sneed
early days but dobbins looks way quicker than ingram
hell yeah now give it to ricard

s
sneeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaad
pxp jackson on a great quick pass to snead for 20ish inside the 5
what a good fucking drive looking like normal again
willie snead inside the 5

hollywoods route running is disgustingly good

ravenstream on instagram for those who cant watch it cause where your from its better than nothing

smh i thought we were done with these damn commercials
lets get some points and we get the ball coming out the half time to step on these losers
this playcalling is terrific so far
out of bounds but still nice throw
lamar to marquise

i love it long time
llama to hollywood looking good
lamar is putting on a fuckin clinic right now
hollywood looking like a wr 1
lamar looks even better than last year
this offense is awesome
hollywood almost got a 100
all of our receivers have looked so incredibly wide open on these last couple drives
hollywood already with 100 yards
pxp 15 s left after jackson pass after scrambling from decent pocket
love it lamar could have just tucked it and run twice in a row but was patient moved and made a pass
wtf lamar lmao
imagine being born in an era where you could witness tom brady lionel messi and lamar jackson all at once
just kick it
pxp inc w 9 left boykin couldnt get a hard catch for td not great route running
2 for mandrews holy shit

wait a minute is campbell on the field goal team
touchdown ravens
69 yards nice
that was a really pretty arch over those defenders
goddamn that was a perfect drive

for real for real that was some brady shit
is denzel ward playing
with a lead lime this look for duvernay and dobbins in the second half
lets get a few more and really take these fuckers hope away
right where we left off
cleveland has a great special teams lmfao
anyone having problem on sunday ticket with the game now being blacked out second half
the 10 dollar tastemaker tho
football gods decided they wanted to see the ravens defense
stanley is the second worst injury we could have imo
thank god humphrey is back
i sense an int
gonna bail them out
oof
fuck
i love seeing odell be absolutely garbage every time we play him
boooo bad call
regardless of the penalty marlon looks incredible
pxp deep but flag toward objhumph
hump gives and takes away he playsike that every down
come the fuck on dude
humph cmon mannnnnn
goddamnit humph enough of those
pxp pi on humph
well if he didnt hold it was probably a touchdown
penalty was there fair call

edit the first one not the second
thats just bad play by marlon hes always handsy sonitd expected but man
its a surprise were this much ahead with this defense playing how they are and shooting themselves in the foot
defending obj flag
is this football or soccer
only the browns could have that chart with a 1 draft pick
can we stop gifting them yards with these penalties
alright alright we got the flags out our system now lets play some ball
pass coverage has been pretty damn tight
good shit tyus
love that were containing chubb this time all right let the jokes come in
pxp big rush mayfield scrambles flag after inc
hoe lee fuk
what the fuck with these penaltys on 3rd down
ok they can gtfo with the penalties now playing sloppy
unreal if this is against us
come on
ok thats the first holdingdpi penalty called on us that was actually worthy of being called
pxp mayfield 9 yard to obj 9 on scramble
lol hodge just ran into him the whole way i guess defender doesnt get his field anymore
how long are they gonna keep them in the game for
can we get off the fucking field
lets burn clock
refs doing everything they can to keep baker on the field
that was a hold too weve gotta play more disciplined
defense needs to work on fundamentals expeditiously
yo whats up with the flags it cant just be the defense
lol okay odell dont complain to the refs theyre ur friends
ravens dbs just marching them down the field for free
uh that looked good that was some bs
bruh why are the refs helping the browns
chuck with the big brain push
just a dumb play by a guy whos supposed to be the best doing it
uh how was that not a catch
no flags
meanwhile there was a blatant hold here by the browns
genuine question how would you reestablish
guys fired up
juiceman almost had it
petersnicee
my man peters
juiceman is da man
damn i wanted him to fake it again lol
attago marcus what a play way to stop the bleeding
damn the flags are getting out of hand
on that mfs ass get out of here bum
these refs are irritating
juicemannnnnn
lmao you can hear marlon scream at that pbu
more flags
cut these flags out
lolz
thanks browns
on them good job
honestly how do you fix the browns if you became the owner tomorrow what do you do
ravens lt ronnie stanley ankle is questionable to return dj fluker has replaced him jamisonhensley

run game isnt working but lamar is still throwing well cant believe it s
how long till we need to pay mandrews
i forgot about sneed
good lord
i love bb
that subway commercial was filmed in the town i live in
if we stall them out yo

nah our corners playing a lil aggressive
i love the hype peters brings to the defense
browns run the ball on 1st and 20 lmaoo
he spill shit
yooo
bringing the lumber
im sick of these zone throws we are allowing
bring in the lumbar is one way to put that
is bowser finally showing something

man the players really love the joker theyre so hype everytime elliot make a play
im tryna see malik harrison take hunts head off
geez lets just shut then down
did juson swing miss a clean sack of bm
can we guard their tight end
why are we dropping judon in coverage
gotta get off on 3rd down shit is ridiculous
swallowed hunt second he caught it
its that cornerback blitz right not covering that well
is judon playing
baker da faker
ill deal with the pass rush
time to run run run
fuck off the field shit stains
god damnit you can not take that penalty
s
king koopa
bowser finally cleaning up hes gotten back there a few times
the ferocity of bowsers attack there was awesome to watch
lets gooo
lotta bad games today
heads haging on the browns side
bro andrews does it every time
browns fans calling for keenum now
g ro is doing an excellent job getting everyone involved hats off to him
lamar has just absolutely dissected them
lets go
damn
lamo that lamar fake
boyle is playing like a boil
i like how aggressive our corners are playing
ill take the calls

ok but these refs tho

looked like a browns player touched it after it bounced
20 is a dumbass

easily would have been picked by guy behind him
lets get some pass protection going next series
koched that one
fumbleeeeee
lets fucking gooo
hoooooo

lfg
poor mitch looks abysmal
lol i love it
jc with the assist
honestly i cant even really see the ball come out if this gets reversed i wouldnt be too pissed about it
rgiii time
ok lj
you know what i havent seen today that jackson to ingram maybe its a handoff maybe its a keeper and sometimes you have no idea which even watching on tv much less the players on the field
fort queen baby
wonder what we need to do on run blocking to help ingram see some room
a b s o l u t e e a s e
jk dobbins
beating the hell outta those boys
gotta get down lamar woo

rg3 going to get a td
ravens are too good not even fun to watch

campell looking strong man
rg3 time babayyyy
twotone obj
im sorry uorangeforeign yeesh
we did it bois
im not sure our run d has improved
for those that care hurst has done almost nothing today
people saying our edge defense is fine and we dont need clowney wya
ingram is looking slow jk is a beast so far
come on harbs you dont need starters in here to finish this they dont need more practice against these clowns
wtf lamar cannot take free fucking shots
lol 4th and 9 and your fucking offsides
wtf lamar
anyone have a stream link just realizing nfl streams got banned
lets get hollywood invoved
lesss goooo
they gonna rob us this one
anyone have any free stream links for the game i cant find anything
what was cambell doing on that one
goddamn we look weak af on this drive
guys first game we a bit rusty
i always forget extra points are something other teams have to worry about lmao
could have lowered the shoulder to get it but gus can punch it through
ahh welcome new bandwagon fans chill the fuck out
i cant find a link that works without signing upanyone here who is out of area successful with one yet
pxp ravens drop a pick on 1st and 29 tip and chuck clark dropped it despite 2 hands
malik is looking good
i was not a big fan of the dobbins pick but i will admit i was wrong he will be a great rblove his vision and burst
seibert is officially one of my favorite players now good god
siebert is so bad
browns just keep being browns
schiebert is a champ missing out on 4 points now
welp browns gonna brown
smh i dont like that start
come on guys
pxp mayfield low to obj inc humph was in there maybe peters
pxp flag is holding on humph
wtf refs
humphrey if you could stop marching them down the field that would be nice
ref ball soft ass penalties so many teams hold constantly and get no calls
nobody gets that we had to go through the disgusting stewage of 3 years having to drain the gunk of retiring players and nobody and getting joe flacco the fuck out of baltimore i hated those times and even thought about switching i aint going lie but my boy lamar came in and changed everything he the truth and the the way the front office sculpted the team around him is so telling that they trust the gladiator the nfl gods sent to us so many teams skipped over this man so many teams doubted this man and still doubt him but through wins and loses ill forever stick with him man
the browns are going to win the division baker is the real deal they have a beast backfield lamar cant throw the ravens are overrated and cant win a playoff game


jk you friggin moron


lets go ravens
the real nonpr rb depth chart dobbins ingram ii gus the bus justice honestly ingram has not looked impressive let alone explosive at all today age may finally be catching up with him albeit i sure hope not
please bench lamar
washington has made it a two score game 2717 with 325 in the forth remaining sorry but i hate philly as much as i hate pitts
oline has to be better why is dj fluker not starting
run defense still weak i see smh
defense did not get better during the offseason it seems of course right after i type type that there is a pass deflection and then a sack

pxp return on punt to 35
im done with this team 30 plus years of embarrassment obj is not the right fit baker is mediocre but to be blown out in 2 straight openers just cancel this team
i thought the dbs were the strenght of this defence
can we sign a veteran safety like earl thomas
maybe uh maybe we shouldve signed clowney
defense looks like complete shit
did chubb get faster
queen looks terrible
baker mayfield is a poor mans joe flacco
were lucky that didnt end in a touchdown
fucking midget cant even get the ball over the los
anyone have a decent quality stream sight
that little run out of bounds made me happy lol first year lamar tries to fucking spin past 9 people there
stream
marlon humphrey showing up on a lot of plays
omg chuck almost
dammit that was a great kick
pxp brown catches on a comeback but moving the wrong way only got a few
whos 49 who tripped
classic browns
odell dropped the ball how could he
lol chuck
cleveland gonna cleveland
pxp sackson on 3rd
pxp chubb for 3 good tackle by queen good sign for him
bruh
pxp obj was our before pass so no catch
pxp flag on return probably block in the back on gunner
next td players need to go down and kiss the mo letters

first truly awful pass that lamar has thrown today

he shouldve used his legs more on that play rather than tried to make that throw
time to watch cam 1411 6 mins left
surprised we didnt run more tbh but whatever
huzzah 10
i guess judon was supposed to just fucking levitate over mayfield
ummm players are up on each other with helmets off remember there is still covid out there
id rather have earl over judon sometimes bro
come tf on boykin
damn the browns suck

but some obj garbage time for my fantasy team would be nice
lol no discipline
fuck
i bet the browns kiss girls than they kiss boys than they kiss girls again
i feel like during the pregame huddle harbaugh says

alright special teams be ready to completely screw up at a pivotal time as usual ok lets go
fuck a shoulder and humphrey checked out of the game fuck the browns
we looking like that dean pees era defense
typical stupid ravens play
good win now if no one gets coronavirus we should be good for a first round playoff exit
can yall just stop man i just wanna see a winning browns team man

ouch
mahomes is about to light this defense up like a christmas tree week 3
i officially do not like campbell

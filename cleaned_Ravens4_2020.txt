man that crowd noise the tailgate atmosphere the energy in the stadium tonight will be electric
its pretty fucked up that its under these circumstances la was a ravens home game last year though basically
i never realized our locker room was that slick

zrebiec adds

with madubuike and washington inactive ravens have only 4 dl active campbell wolfe williams ellis shows you that they expect to be in sub packages most of game ward and mcphee can also both play inside
washington saw a gigantic drop off in terms of snap count from week 1 to 2 so this isnt super surprising also why isnt madubuike playing most expected him to be fully healthy by now is that not the case
ravens inactives qb trace mcsorley rb justice hill wr chris moore ol ben bredeson dt justin madubuike dt broderick washington s geno stone terrell bonds and khalil dorsey to make nfl debuts

amen

they wouldnt have posted it if it were a limp
diehard chiefs fan from va hoping to watch an epic game the ravens fanbase has been awesome this week im absolutely looking forward to the afc championship game
great to see so much respect between the fans of these two teams go ravens

hes been a great teammate he has accepted his role as a backup even though he wants to start and done everything asked of him and been awesome in the locker room and as a community guy im glad he is a raven he got a raw deal in washington
mcgoatly has entered the chat
i feel like its a bit unfair the one time mahomes comes to baltimore there are no fans but i last year we made that statement against ne at home at night in black feeling like we win 4324 and just shut up the league it could be close but i i really dont see us losing unless the defense allows 35 plus
after listening to the film study baltimore podcast im expecting duvernay to get more involved tonight hes impressed every time hes touched the ball so far
prediction 1 my nerves will be shot

2 ravens 41 kc 17
we break these chains
looks like there are fans obviously not a lot though
agreed

you should also delete reddit since trolls might read this post and dm you the score maybe even delete this post just be safe
i tried to do that for an orioles playoff game a while ago went full electronic isolation didnt look at my phone all day got through 7 hours and 40 minutes of my 8 hour shift and then someone came up to me and said i cant believe the orioles won




lotr dorks unite
holy crap i cant stop moving and talking

my only wish is that we could all be at the stadium rocking the shit out of it

next year

lfg
im a caged tiger over here feels like playoffs
lets goooooo
have a beer or nine itll chill you out

if the game is really close i have to watch from the hallway peeking around the corner history has proven this helps the ravens
my friend and i made a pact today to drive to tampa if we get into sb i talked to so many ravens fans who went to the last one they didnt even buy tickets just partied their asses off with ravens fans from across the world
telling the kids to quiet down so i can freak out
i love how much mahomes lives in caw nation heads

for real though heres to a bloody good game

gut feeling tells me we will meet again at the afc championship but at arrowhead or mt
relax buddy you gotta be able to make it to the end

its almost like having more points is important
i hope the losses stat is reversed as his career advances
quite interesting

this

shit that looks great my friend eat up
that looks amazing
its beautiful
hell yeah
pulled pork on the bottom layer brisket in the middle
nailed it
lets not all start posting our game day meals
removed

lets get it on

guess that settles the kicker debate
this aint unfamiliar territory its obvious in all our losses

1 it starts with a stalled drive from a bad play call forcing us to go for 3 when tds matter against kc
2 then our d gets exploited in outside runs which opens up intermediate routes because we keep stacking the box
3 we blitz and rush 4 and cant get any pressure
4 momentum builds and fucks us and we play from behind and lose turnovers
5 repeat for 60min
my bedtime is 3410
at least tucker settled all that nonsense about the best kicker in the game ill cling to that like a life raft
at least butker looked like shit and we proved who the true goat kicker is
jackson needs to work on his mental game point blank no focus just frustration
71 was held
bruh why the fuck are we playing so scared play calling has been terrible defense doesnt know how to tackle
defense is gassed because offense cant give them a second to catch their breath cant even make tackles when we should be stopping them in the backfield
the fake crowd noise is atrocious my god everything about this game has been terrible
ill paint my dick purple if we win this game
judon is actually useless
the only one who was effective at stopping gus edwards tonight was greg roman
romans play calling is brilliant and idiotic at the same time
that flag really derailed our entire drive fuck
chiefs fan here that tripping call was total bullshit you guys should be in the red zone
andy reid is embarrassing martindale right now
why is the crowd noise cheering when the chiefs make a play
the most concerning thing to me is not necessarily that theyre getting dismantled by a superior team its that theyre getting dismantled in exactly the same way they did in the playoffs nothing has changed
they claimed to treat it like another game but switched up their whole offensive and defensive schemes this week
andrews did the same shit vs tennessee
sorry ass oline how the fuck can lamar throw if he has no time to throw the wr routes take too long to develop when it does develop lamar is already sacked
that was a brilliant drive with a really bad 3rd down call at the end could have been 7 either way lets hope the defense gets the ball right back so we can try again
im a die hard but this looks waaay too easy for kc this is a major disappointment for the first half
i honestly dont want to see anymore of the showboating and goofiness when were beating shit teams this team gotta prove to us that they can win when their nuts are on line
fuck off mark andrews you aways would catch that in every other game but this one dude
judon you need to go from body built by taco bell to body built by a proper nutritionist so i dont play like im about to have raging diarrhoea
lamar was pissed there was a commercial timeout
lamar jackson haters going to have a field day hes admittedly looked atrocious tonight as a passer
time to come back and win from behind gonna give patty mahomes a taste of his own medicine flockgang
andrews with the real momentum killer thats 3 tonight hes dropped
watching lamar have to juke 3 dudes while patrick just gets a leisurely stroll for a first down is fucking infuriating
im not worried about this teams ability to win games and go to the playoffs again this year but we will not be able to ever get past a playoff game if we keep doing this shit during the big games
weve given up 9 catches including 2 tds on blitzes and the quarterback can easily scamper down the field well time for another blitz
touched seven yards in the backfield and still got a yard strictly because of missed tackles
the fake crowd noise is god awful lol
this feels exactly like the titans game dropped passes and dumb play calling
whats up with mandrews cant seem to catch anything tonight
you want to be considered a topflight te you have to catch that
2 am in poland i should be asleep cause school is in a couple of hours but fuck it ravens are more important
why the fuck did the fake crowd applaud that
me upvoting literally every comment in this thread as theyre posted it aint much but its honest work
remember in the first drive where we ran all the way up the field than started throwing every single play like we were panicking after going down 3
they cant stop the run and we pass 3 times why
were making plays on defense just not stringing them together
chill your dicks ravens bros were in this its fine
were out there looking like the baltimore jets
im just going to point out ingram has 4 carries at halftime 6 for the entire backfield why do we change our game when we play good teams
winks brain right now yes they stopped our first 99 blitzes but there is no way theyll stop our 100th blitz
i think they need to practice tackling this week
cant wait for judon to get overpaid elsewhere
i dont get how the entire game the middle of the fucking field is so open
its like they know what were doing on defense and perfectly countered every fucking time
lets look on the bright sidetucker is still the better kicker
chiefs fan here

i want to send my apologies to the kicking god whose name is tucker i shall never mention butker in the same vain as him ever again and if i do it will undoubtedly be in jest
positive outtakes thus far
calais campbell is a more than welcome addition and fits in nicely
butker the best kicker in the league thinknot
weve found our return man in duvernay
its only week 3
its like gro tries to get too fancy in big games and show off

just run the fucking ball
yeah this playcalling is actual ass this team was so far from ready we deserve every ounce of criticism
if lamar comes out the second half inspired im pulling the receipts out for every one of the fucks in here talking shit
ive seen better tackle in a fucking bass pro shop
they arent winning this game but just give me one sustained offensive drive after a 3andout just prove theres life there
the only thing thats going to make this worse is hearing the media jerk off mahomes the rest of the week
fuck man andrews is going to be killing himself for dropping that lamar is playing leaps and bounds better this half so far
these fucking commentators get andrews more involved he has 4 fucking drops
call one fucking penalty on them for fucks sake
blitzing works fine if you actually have good pass rushers lol
greg roman needs to stop being an idiot and abandoning the run
im donald trump and i stole money to pay for this commercial
utter bullshit tripping as your being knocked to the ground ok
that drive was never going anywhere after that horseshit tripping call
pessimists can fuck off lol its not gonna be an easy win lets get our shit together refs havent helped
this is good practice for the playoffs get down early lets see what theyre made of
passing offense in big games consists of lamar jackson rollouts and passes to mark andrews
why is there audible cheering when the chiefs make a positive play on offense
remember when judon was supposed to finally break out hes a 15m hole in our pocket and all the viable tradefree agent alternatives are now off the market yay
were honestly lucky to be down only 17
is it just me or doea this year feel like were so worried about jackson passing that we forgot we have ingram gus and dobbins and jacksons legs that first drive said it all in what its capable of we know the boy can pass but fucking damn run the fucking ball
im not gonna overreact about our players sometimes people play terribly but i really do think we may have reached the ceiling with roman its very clear to me that he has no idea how to call a game when not everything goes according to his little script
we are a very specifically built team we will never win a shootout against this team have to rush for probably 250 yards and keep mahomes off the field
clueless people gonna look at the box score and roast lamar but what more can he do hes putting the ball right in peoples hands and they cant catch it
how the fuck does it take 3 quarters to realize this is how we win jesus fuck
marcus peters pick six next drive is the best timeline
do coaches not read any news at all when game planning honest question i can understand if they wanna drown out the noise or something but literally all i read leading up to tonight
chiefs are bad against the run
chiefs are good against the blitz

so what do we do wedont run and we blitz

chiefs oline is getting away with some pretty egregious holds
i officially fucking hate kansas city
this is the one year that home field is not relevant tho
its games like this that really make me miss sizzle
all you bandwagon fans smh
a desperation rb screen got a first down with a ravens defender on their back is exactly how id describe this game without using any foul language
they paid that woman a lot to say trump cares about people like her and she still wasnt convinced
judon is just a guy nowhere near close to top contract worthy
wow i guess the refs already know whos winning
imagine if corona hadnt hit this year and we actually had 70000 screaming fans in the stadium
well roman time to prove youre an offensive genius learn to play from behind or gtfo
lamar take my energy
lmao that was perfect timing from judon
our defense looks like it has no idea whats going on
3 points against a bottom 10 defense
jackson missing andrews dropping roman calling badly this is what happened in january
at least no one has to watch this in person
id take a first down at this point
anyone else feel like we should be doing a pseudo hurry up the rest of the game
bench ingram and stick with gus hes doing way better
we wouldnt be in this mess if romans shitty play calls hadnt ruined the 1st half
fix the issues like last year

and come prepared for playoffs

dont let this happen again and again

when its bad its bad
greg roman needs to chill if were down a score and not abandon the run ffs did he not learn from the tennessee game
everyone relax it is early no risk take the 3
lol people freaking out like 7 min into the game jesus calm down and truzz
cant say i agree with that tripping call that totally killed any momentum on that drive
i cant read lips but im pretty sure lamar hates tv timeouts more than we do
what is this playcalling

ran all over them first drive

come on
wtf did the chargers do that we couldnt
why the fuck is the crowd noise cheering for the chiefs
do we just like not want to beat these guys or what seems like we have a completely different mindset than normal when we play them
so slow and sluggish right now need one hell of a team talk at the half
dude these crowd operators are guessing as much as our defense is
we spent all week doing this stupid ass gif war just to get our cheeks clapped on primetime

edit thanks for the gold
going to jerk off i need the endorphins real quick
im straight up just not having a good time right now
we just cant beat kc doesnt help everyone is choking this is ten all over again fucking garbage
greg roman is a big issue for this team i dont even blame the d so much they shouldnt be expected to stop the kc offence when theyre out there constantly this is tennessee game all over again the run was working brilliantly at the start and you abandon it
im starting to think lamars 04 when trailing by 10 stat is on the fact that any time were behind roman changes our identity completely we can never just play our game when it matters
a psychology problem this team cant handle the pressure of big games
endmaddenmonopoly
tucker is the only one prepared for his matchup lol
since the half our defense has

1 forced turnover

2 stopped on 41
i do be yelling too loud in buffalo wild wings
andrews more involved he needs to find his fuckin hands first
they keep scheming up rushes for judon and they uh arent working
well they were back in this for a minute or so
we wont win a sb until we have a pass rusher who can take a game over
did the ref even report him as eligible
we wont miss yanda

we dont need clowney

im glad we resigned judon
12 carries between our backs outside of lamar

this game is unreal i cant believe people will got bat and defend our play tonight

horrible playcalling horrible qbing bad drops from tes ingram never followed his lead blocker judon is a piece of dog shit and the rest of the pass rush cant stop a fucking a power wheels at 5mph

seriously though imagine giving a browns qb a national ad spot before hes even had a winning season again
well tucker the goat confirmed as if it wasnt already lol
we look like we did in the playoff game against the titans
does roman get weird in big game
what the fuck was that tripping call
holy shit that woman looks like boris johnson
establish the fucking run kc run d is not good we drove on the first drive what the fuck did we quit running for get your shit together o come on
ok sound crew shove that crowd cheer right up
wont lie the sound effects got me figured a flag was thrown or a fight was breaking out
imma pull a pats fan move here were throwing this game on purpose so we dont reveal our hand during the playoffs 7d underwater backgammon from harbaugh

unpopular opinion calling people out as like theyre arent fans because theyre upset about the way this game has gone is shitty none of us expected want this game to go this way god forbid we be upset
how many dropped fucking passes is that we just keep shooting ourselves in the fucking foot fuck
atleast we win the kicker battle
lamar made every single play on that drive deep short run read option he didnt miss a single one hollywood andrews obj im expecting better but if lamars found his groove then ill still believe until the clock hits 0
i still dont expect to win but not folding at the half is huge
imagine building your defense around trying to let matt judon get to the qb

lmao even when you do that he cant get it done
honestly wouldnt be mad to trade judon midseason atp
we literally cant tackle
maybe we need lamars mom to tweet about keeping with the running game see if its as effective as pats mom tweeting
its absolutely disgusting how we abandoned the run game so early
this has been incredibly frustrating but its the beginning of the season and weve got 13 games left
im going to have to stay off of rnfl and twitter this week
lol judon isnt getting paid by this team
this is exactly the titans game all over

dropped balls bad offensive play calling terrible play by damn near everyone

its time for lamar to be the leader and make something happen this is not about skill this is about playing in the big moments and this team has shown that they arent big enough for it this is a mental breakdown
letjudonwalk
not my best kicker in the league
you take a shot at the king you better not miss
best kicker in the league for sure
tripping

whore shit
that screen was a td if not for campbell being so damn tall
they keep doing screen passes and we have done absolutely nothing to stop them
man thats a good football team weve got to put something together on offense now
lamar is pissed off about the commercial break lmao
bring me some pissed off lamar
im an eagles fan but i just wanted to check in and ask what the fuck is that color commentator talking about blaming lamar for that absolute perfect pass to mark andrews

chiefs 13

ravens 10

ravens get a 3 and out get the ball and proceed to throw 3 times 3 and out no runs no runs from a top running team in the league

greg has to go this is showing to be a pattern i said we would not run the ball 10 more times once we were down and guess what we have run it 1 time since
more exposedtrumps taxes or ravens defense
i knew we were fucked when everyone picked us

i hate that shit so much

only issue with lamar era is the hype never feels right for just about anybody
lamar take my energy
marquise brown has been quiet

so has literally everyone else on the team except duvernay
i love andrews but hopefully at contract time decosta just has a compilation of his important drops playing in the background lol
no we dont need to get mark andrews more in the game hes shitting the bed right now
im glad were driving but why wait until the end of the 3rd to start running and getting meticulous


fuck it though i like that were fighting finally
stop right here

put it in your minds its going to happen

then touchdown

jt game winning field goal because he is the best in the league

no weapon formed against us shall prosper
judon has had his name mentioned a grand total of zero times tonight
chuck do me a favor and force a fumble again
theres really no point in judon being in the game just add another db
give marlon all of judons money please
judon is not playing like someone worth all that money
if judon wasnt going inside every fucking time and just held his fucking edge this drive would be over fucking goddamnit
this game would be different if we had 1 player who could beat his man 1v1 in the pass rush
every completed chiefs pass is wide fucking open i need some fucking answers
chiefs become the new steelerspats gotta beat them to get where were going
pound the rock it seems so obvious why didnt we run it more and set up play action play calling seemed off but im no pro maybe the coaching staff sees something i dont
yall will be back better than ever
pain
everything goes wrong against the chiefs and in the playoffs its the same every time why they look like a 88 team out there right now
judon flat out doesnt wanna get paid
i hope the ravens get crucified for this one feel every piece of this if they wanna do anything worth a damn they gotta acknowledge what the fuck just happened this was some clown car shit
riddick is honestly obnoxious i know we look bad but ffs stop glamorize over the cheifs its not fun to listen to at all

i paid more income taxes than donald trump
wait american networks can show political ads that are straight up slander wow
wouldve liked 7 but we know the run can work i expecting a 40 yard td pass later on
i didnt see any illegal hands wtf
is this your best kicker in the league
best kicker in the league
feels like the titans game already
down by 3 coaching staff full blown panic
this is how a bad decision from the ref can kill everything

plenty of football left
refs literally killed that drive with that bs tripping call
that penalty killed our drive
weakness being exposed no pass rush without blitzing judon is not the guy
so glad we got campbell dude is a mountain
if we can hold them to 3 it will be a win this drive
campbell is dominant doesnt get enough credit
has tyus bowser missed like 6 sacks so far this year i swear he gets pressure but qbs shrug him off like a fucking twitter hater
not even mad thats amazing playcalling it really is
im straight up not having a good time
remembering why i dont usually hang out in game threads here
on these hoes we shall stunt
drop counter 3
judon was not off sides
i legitimately have a migraine from this shit show
why do we always completely suck against mahomes embarrassing
im so happy that this game is in week 3 lol
andy reid is just closing his eyes and picking plays now lol
the sound guy hit the wrong crowd noise button lol
wtf is this crowd noise
at least the kicking debate is settled dude has one good game and says hes better than tuck the disrespect is unreal
still cant get over blitzing our best corner on 3rd and fucking 14
lamar has been bad no doubt but holy shit no one can catch a pass no one
yall remember when we set the season rushing record then completely abandoned the rushing game for no fucking reason
which one of you fucks forgot to wear their lucky underwear
stop abandoning the run for the desperate pass we run the ball we play action off the run its what we do god i hate when we play desperate football slow it down wear out chiefs d give our defense a break fuckin a
the chiefs are just having a party out there

that one hit me
thank fuck for tuck
andrews it like the avatar when the ravens need him the most he disappears
if i was writing the headline tomorrow for the sun butker misses an extra point and a field goal as justin kicker proves dominance

and then the piece about the game
has to be 7 on this next drive
this game could have gotten really ugly look at where we are now we got a chance
meep meep its the fucking gus bus
wait youre telling me running the ball with an offense built to run the ball against a bad run defense works
mandrews is having a bad day you hoes aint loyal he could have overworked his forearms at the gym trying to get ready for yall and now hes too tired sometimes you hoes need to stick by your man when hes having performance issues
we need a humphrey or mp pick here
is whoever is controlling the crowd noise drunk
we had them three times that drive and just gave it up because wink loves blitzing so much when it doesnt work at all against mahomes
wonder if wink will ever stop blitzing even though its blown up in his face literally every time
watching judon play makes me so thankful we have decosta as gm didnt hand him that multiyear deal and we have the cap to burn this year glad hell be gone and well be 13m richer next year
is holding not a thing anymore
we are the hoes being stunted on right now
idc whats happens these final 8 minutes i better not hear anybody say butker is the best kicker in the league
people need to take into account the fantastic play calling by andy reid he is carving us up with these creative play calling wink is outmatched
this o line needs a lot of work
losing yanda was brutal
our defense was on ice skates the whole game its good we have somewhat of a cupcake in washington next week to regroup i do understand anything can happen in the nfl before someone jumps down my throat
i dipped on the game and learned that red dwarf stars will burn for 10 trillion years you know how fucking crazy that is wow
10 of 12 on 3rd down conversions this defense cant get off the fucking field
frustrating game but the season is young and a wake up call was needed still love this team 110
our rookie lbs got exploited tonight that was probably to be expected but they will learn from it and will be better
i dont want anyone fired

but

harbs has to sit down with his staff and go off on their game plan in big games the fuck is roman thinking abandoning the run game when youre down by 3 for fucks sake man

i really hope he lights a fire under their ass because its not the first time this happens
on the plus side i can drink some more
this play calling by roman sometimes is sus
get trump off my fucking screen
wasnt offside perfectly timed
love the ravens ill watch every week however im not lying when i say my excitement wont recover until we prove this shit isnt in our dna
unpopular opinion if i had to choose id choose being up 17 at the hald over being down 17 at the half just my humble opinion
im glad we got this l early on lamar can learn how to play from behind and get better at no huddle we shouldve never abandoned the run too many drops andrews dropped td wouldve made this game different i still believe in this team remember what happened last year on our early loss

dont like that 3rd down play call and i love seeing tucker nail field goals but i wish we had gone for it on 4th as well
hell yeah take the points no need to leave them on the table going for it on 4tg on your first drive could be a momentum killer if they stop us there
best kicker in the nfl lmao
butker is the best kicker in the league
best kicker in the league
bro oh my god ive never been happier from a missed xp

were so petty lmao

you aint tucker
this ref is tripping
refs need to be investigated for gambling after this game
well this is a shitshow all comes from that tripping call
that was such a bad call we have to calm down and play our game
that call was a fucking drive killer
absolutely bullshit penalty but our pass protection has to be better
that tripping call was a drive killer but also dont love following up with that bubble screen
this refs gale boetticher sounding ass voice is starting to get on my nerves
calais is just a lifesaver
if the defense can ever start finishing their sacks we will be dangerous
i pray to god this is our worst quarter of the game
reid is putting on a masterclass rn as a playcaller

justin kicker best kicker in football
justin kicker indeed
i hope people realize how beautiful of a throw that was to andrews right off his fingers
what are these fucking playcalls

reminds me of the flacco era need x yards throw it x 4 yards downfield
greg who the fuck is mark ingram roman
oh wow didnt know these refs had time space powers to see judon was offsides by a fraction of a second
run the ball for the love of god run the ball

keep it simple roman
im so happy i cleared my entire day and schedule to prep for this game
why do we always hear that chiefs are weak against the run and then we cant run the ball maybe our oline issues are worse than we thought
the sound effects are awful hhahahah
im ready for this comeback
lol youve got to be kidding me is this our first game of the season
the fake crowd noise is not doing it for me
terrible coaching not running the ball on 2nd and 3 will cost us the game
nice social distancing in the secondary
welp trolls are going to start poorin in now gl mods bye yall
harbs better lose his shit during halftime
judon i dare you to get a sack
we need a safety guys like bad
remember when this sub got butthurt cause marlon said that this teams identity was to choke in big games

here we are an offseason later and nothings changed
i completely stand behind our boys if they say its better for the team to have earl out but god damn can we bring in a competent starter to take his place
dude im so fucking sick of judon i obviously dont know the play calls on d but i swear every time mahomes scrambles out of the pocket or buys time its cuz judon keeps coming inside on his rush

also wtf was he doing covering hardman i love wink but stop fucking dropping judon in coverage its useless
we might want to consider signing clay matthews
is our playbook really just this bad
wtf happened to everyones hands tonight
defense needs to pitch a second half shutout at this rate need 45 sacks and other insanity to make that happen
andrews blowing it on the big stage again
only thing that can make this night good for me is seeing that thicc att chick
this is the titans game again andrews and hollywood not catching anything directly affecting the drives and we then try the dumbest screens and try to force mark ingram in runs
bodies in the inner harbor be like at least i dont have to watch this ravens game
there we go now get a td
defense showed up to play now time for the rest of the offense to show up mark andrews please find a new pair of gloves
if we win this i might become religious again
can we get 13 some more snaps on offense please dude is a playmaker
gus is rb2 stop downplaying my man
gus edwards would be the starter on most teams he deserves 1015 touches a game
update the ravens have reportedly discovered that gus edwards is indeed alive and are now attempting to play him
mark andrews td and preventing that bs td hardman scored on 3rd and 14 wouldve been incredible right now this game has been a real stinger
every fucking 3rd down its the same shit lmao
for as much shit as weve given judon hes literally been right on the snap count all night im still pissed about that first offsides call
we cant fucking stop these guys
judon trash comeplete non factor all day
the fucking holds bro whatever
ummmm block in the back are you fucking kidding me
how have there been no holding calls againt the chiefs all night
literally zero pas rush and judon wants 20 million
sad just a sad game all around you dont expect to win this game but this is just pathetic all around chiefs are amazing but the ravens wanted to pull another titans game

all they had to do was stick to the run early they got cute and tried to pass pass pass you cant let mahomes have the ball like this you cant stop him
its crazy how everything works for them and nothing for us still time left but im hoping we bounce back from this not only in this game but the rest of the season
man if i was lamar i wouldnt be getting christmas gifts for anyone on the line this year
hey wink this is what a pass rush looks like
gus not in that series there was plenty of time panicked confused in a daze all night
cant expect lamar to be a successful passer when hes under pressure every throw
rip the guy who bet 1k earlier
yandas being sorely missed this game lamar has no time
could be worse we could be the jets
it feels like a death by 1000 cuts rn
we were only down 63 and we completely abandon the run frustrating as hell
we need to learn how to handle adversity and build up some mental fortitude this team players and coaches are too used to winning this mentality will not get us a super bowl team needs to wake up
50something yards passing in a game is not acceptable
how many big games did we win last year i dont get yall saying we never show up

other than the 2 playoff games and the chiefs games we have won every big game like what are you guys on about and then the fluke browns game too obviously

sure the playoffs were bad but there has been plenty of evidence we can bring it big shit fucking happens

edit i get the playoff talk though

dont get me wrong there

but regular seasonwise it doesnt make sense
why did we stop running the ball after our dominant first drive
brutal loss

on the bright side maybe the bandwagon fans will fuck off
is our defence too slow or is it an optical illusion it felt like they couldnt catch anyone all night
wheres this lamarbrown bullshit chemistry we heard so much about
imagine if lamar had the time mahomes gets every play
i think you seriously consider the risk of signing ab riskreward ratio has changed now that you know how badly you need a dominant wide out
please cut judon this offseason
i mean on the one hand you can kind of forgive the refs for assuming judon had to be offside to get there given how shit he is at rushing

on the other hand that was clean as a whistle and fuck the refs

edit and for good measure fuck tyreek hill
mahomes has 260 passing yards in the first half we have 35

weve rushed for 71 yards in the first half 70 came on the first drive

this chiefs defense isnt elite its not even well above average were playing scared and the coaches had us unprepared to play at every level offensively and defensively
21 were fine well go into the bye 61 today showed that were not on kc level but theres plenty of season left to play hope this loss leads the bandwagon fans to buffalo or something
lol he missed
best kicker ladies and gentlemen
tucker is the goat
only down a fg lets goooo best kicker in the league lmaoooo
well ends that debate
alright boys and girls bring the ravens luck for me tonight gotta get rolling on law school apps that i procrastinated on

x200b

stunt on these hoes and fuck the refs
guys duvernay might make me forget jacoby
tripping
these refs suck holy shit
that boyle penalty killed that one and it was bs gotta shake them off tho
someone should foul the refs for fucking tripping
fucking tripping
i cant remember the last time i saw a tripping penalty
i love campbell
can yall have some

t r u s s
does anyone else think that our fake crowd noise is more quiet than other teams fake crowd noise
i hate this ketchup loving fuck god damn
we actually need a game like this where offense needs to come from behind
just simply outschemedoutcoached
it feels like the ravens defense is just chasing but have no idea what the chiefs are going to do on offense
duverney has burners
tucker 4

butker 1
just wait for devin duvernay to develop more as a wide receiver and play full time in the slot for baltimore lateroundqb
here we go duvernay i can not explain how much i thank you
lets go and get a fucking touchdown boys
lamar got pissed about the tv timeout
that was a nice ass throw wtf announcer
why arent we running anymore this is the same shit we did against the titans we went away from the record breaking rushing
this is exactly what killed us in the divisional round trying to stay away from our identity
why do we keep running routes behind the sticks on 3rd down
come the fuck on mark lamar couldnt have dropped it in there any better tf these announcers talking about
get the throw down it was in his hands
that didnt look offsides to me it was really tight but the centers arm was moving youre allowed to go at the snap right
jesus christ receivers can catch the ball
thats just a perfect ball nothing mp can do about that good coverage
if it wasnt for that return this is a blowout
and here comes roman to force lamar to throw 60 times
glad we put mahomes back on the field after going 3 out without using any of our 4 fucking rbs
chiefs needed all of regulation to put up 20 on the fucking chargers last week
the d is gassed because we wasted the last offensive series gotta have an extended drive here to give the d a break
that flag on judon was fraudulent he and mcphee timed the snap perfectly
this terrible play all started with that terrible tripping call
justin herbert threw for 300 last week against this d no idea what the hell is going on
this is fucking practice for kc absolutely embarrassing
mahomes throwing to guys with 510 feet of separation
mahomes like any qb needs to be hit to be rattled this is just some random defense to him
offensive play calls are horrible in a big game again its like watching the titans game all over again 2 yard passes on 3rd and 7
our defense is literally fucking brain dead im done with this game
embarrassed on national tv cool cool
another missed sack lol
i liked it better when we were underdogs at least the trolls were funny then
this is a pass rush issue 100
but hey we have the best kicker right
mark no handrews
i mean boys idk what to say thats positive i guess its only week 3 theres a fuckton of football left to go anything can happen but fuck man not another game lost like this this feels worst than the titans game honestly because it literally feels like were stuck in cement and there is absolutely nothing we can do
andrews is chokeprone in big games too anyone got heaps number
purple acting sus
what a waste of memes
honestly it just feels so lazy like even when were tackling it just looks and feels lazy as fuck i dont know whats going on
i just wanna go back to being the underdogs we never play like shit when we are the underdogs in big games in our whole franchise history
remember when the thing about us was we played down to our opponents but showed up during prime time
props to andy reid exposing our weak lbs in coverage
shout out to everyone who wasnt satisfied when we basically blew out the texans last week tonight is how the ravens used to play a few years ago at least this game will get rid of those people with unrealistic expectations
im not even sure if were even playing the same sport as the chiefs
at least we have washington next week
being critical of the team is not being a fairweather fan and tonight is the night to be critical
regardless of the outcome i love my team and im only disappointed because i know they are way better than this
just when i think im out they pulll me back innnnn
i love hollywood and glad he got the first down but he needs to stop running backwards does it too much
that whole drive wiped out fucking andrews and fucking brown jr
that drop was fucking heartbreaking

football gods twisting the knife huh
kill 7 mins for 3 points awesome
the ball is probably covered in andy reids hog sweat
we need a ducking touchdown
pound the fucking rock
here we go lamar show them ur cock
mark andrews best go do some coke in the toilets real quick
get everyone some fucking cocaine for this drive
why do we ever take edwards out
held the chiefs to no points in the 3rd
why didnt the clock stop he ran out of bounds
its almost as if we shouldnt have stopped running it after one drive
mahomes get your kermit sounding ass off my tv bro
i havent sat down this whole second half just pacing around my living room like a maniac
i dont know what was worse football our second quarter or any 4th quarter involving the atlanta falcons
why would we go for 2 what
nick boyle with the chad move of actually catching the goddamn ball
our blocking te showing our receiving te how its done
dont do this to me mahomes

please have mercy

i cant handle a third one
man if we had actually run the damn ball in the first half this is a completely different game
chiefs fan here great second half so far ravens see yall after the game
put in gus on defense
god its me again
mahomes is a god but damn his receivers are always open lol
blame of the game goes to judon imo
the ravens d is like me in madden blitz blitz blitz blitz blitz blitz blitz blitz
block in the back
their tackle has better hands than our receiving te
lmfao a left tackle just caught a td the fucking left tackle the chiefs have fucked wink martindale in his ear hole this game
terrible game from both wink and roman
lmao cool our d doesnt even know whose eligible
honestly looking ahead this is a gut lunch and we have to get real pass rush than can set the edge as well

its killed us in every loss

we blitz our dbs because theyre our best players

we need to stop derrick henry ceh nick chubb joe mixon

we cant right now and thats our achilles heel letting zadarius walk was a stupid move and tagging judon was too couldve just drafted better players than him
its the regular season we were the best team during the regular season last year and it got us jack shit may be better to be the undergo going forward
judon just hit free agency not worth half his salary
were gonna win 3734
our oline has been completely exposed they cant protect at all
orlando brown has had a terrible game
what the fuck is no one fucking blocking
time to ignore reddit and all sports media for the week its going to be a miserable time
lamar literally takes one read and has three dudes in his face every single play oline and pass rush needs revamping bad looks like trash
i think that the first person who says that defenses have figured us out should be banned from this sub
im so excited to see how this team performs after this loss
lamar said something about big games there on that last shot of him he knows what people are going to keep saying
maybe spend the entire next month practicing third and long maybe just maybe practice peters pressing a receiver instead of trying to get a pick on every single play maybe practice getting someone else to blitz instead of your top corner
lol tackled in the back and still gets the first
we need to run the ball 40 times a game minimum
79ypc as a team

23ypa jesus as a team

an average of 23 would be horrendous in the run game nonetheless the pass game

this is a disaster
it isnt the end of the word chill out it could be worse it could be 2015
i know 2710 looks bad but take a moment to realize that the score could easily be 273 if it werent for a kick return td which research shows mostly comes down to luck

somehow the score doesnt even justify how thoroughly weve had our asses kicked thus far
can we get a we have the best kicker ever upvote party going anyone
i wish i only paid 750 in taxes
yall are acting like were done
eat shit trump
i 100 guarantee ravens come back to win this

x200b

it is written so it shall be
the ravens dont always choke in big games we beat the pats and the rams last year in primetime we beat the seahawks and 49ers in close games relax people its week 3 you are all sounding like those annoying ass patriots fans
the chiefs are the new patriots theyre already hard enough to beat but then they have refs helping them too like wtf
fack you trumper
wheres the hold
the refs are absolutely plowing us
yo when were bad we are fucking terrible
still fucking fuming at the andrews drop that was a perfect throw catch the fucking ball that is what youre paid stupid amounts of money to do
lol someone said fire harbaugh yall are actually so stupid
this offensive line is bad and to be fair kc threw the kitchen sink at this game and wedid not thoroughly out coached
they need to run that shit they couldnt handle the run
tucker 3

butker 0
gonna be a long night if our defense keeps letting tyreek burn em
butker aint tucker get the fuck outta here
ha got nervous in front of the goat
hahahah that was worth giving the touchdown to see him miss 2nd most accurate my ass
dont ever compare this kid to tucker again
best kicker in the nfl my ass lol
run the ball roman better not shit himself like the tenn game keep running it until they stop it
these refs are garbage
come on bank personnel dont be shy play the bullshit chant
this is an awful start that 1st and 20 playcall was one of the worst things ive ever seen
hey refs they won the super bowl they dont need your help to stay competitive
refs are gonna take full control of this game smfh
i forgot how many soft fans in here its been 2 series one bad call and some sputtering and i see people saying they are throwing in the towel cmon we got this shit its 4 points
everyone chill with the doom and gloom posts already
116 years of experience at making bullshit calls
come on guys get a fucking stop here
were gonna need some turnovers from our d
good shit campbell mahomes getting wide open receivers tho
ok put that quarter behind us
why are we trying to strip the ball instead of tackle the ball carrier
lmao this thread this feels like old ravens pats games well come back still only down 3 with 3 quarters to go
will the chiefs ever get called for holding or anything for that matter
we need a marlon punch fumble rn
the reality is the ground game has worked but a fake tripping penalty making it 1st and 20 takes that away
this is bad my dudes
whole defense is getting exposed gotta give credit to the mind of reid but damn this sucks
are we trying to go down 10 to prove a point
have a bad feeling we are about to get spanked the energy levels are weird like the titans game way too tight
yes the defense isnt playing great but a lot of the credit has to go to the chiefs play calling that touchdown and the double fake screen then pass to the tight end are almost impossible to defend
holy fucking shit please dont resign judon

tucker

undisputed goat
all that genius playcalling for a return td counter must hurt
that 3 and out was sooooo needed they need some deserved rest on d now
run the fucking ball holy shit
remember when the chiefs couldnt stop the ground game on that first drive
why the fuck is greg roman such a fucking nuthead when it comes to the chiefs were down by 3 but hes calling plays like were down by 30
im pretty sure that judon was actually right on time but i cant blame the ref there its a really tough call
refs arent even using lube tonight just fucking us raw
ive never seen the ravens play scared smh the chiefs are officially in our heads
holding
yeah not much peters could have done there
hows that not holding

fucking refs
was i the only one who saw snead and boykin run at each other or am i tripping
looks like the key to beating the ravens is shut down marquise with physicality limit the rbs and pray lamar is off with andrews
fire the stadium sound guy
the fact that judon thinks hes worth big money
we need big adjustments after the half
puttingonclownmakeupjpg
hahahaha what a fucking waste of a day off
why are we running a corner blitz with our best cb retarded
elliots better than earl its all good like he had to go but these takes were hilarious
ok im sorry but yall calling us negative need to just stop there is zero reason to be so tolerant with us playing this bad its one thing if the score has been super close the whole game but this is getting outrageous
matt judon just runs as fast as he can around the tackle and tries to get to the qb and completely breaks contain he does it every play
15 million for judon to not get a sack
why the fuck didnt we call a timeout why are we rushing ourselves

offense looks awful defense looks terrible not a good game

this gif war was for nothing
this game reminds me of us against the jaguars in london its that bad
holy shit guys wtf andrews cant even catch a garbage time catch
i mean at least their kicker fucking sucks
andrews drop at the end was the icing on the shit cake
the chiefs dont even have that great of a defense oh lawdy lawd they better get better after this horrendous showing
whats sad is they dont even look somewhat competitive they look awful
5 dropped passes and we abandoned the run game immediately after the game we 73

inexcusable the playcalling has been the worst tonight i mean i just dont fucking understand why they would abandoned our bread and butter but this is this is fucking stupid terrible fucking playcalling
i really woke up at 2am for this shit huh
oline is soft
both sides of the ball need to play absolutely lights out to even have a chance at this comeback sorry boys i just dont see it tonight
well at least we arent the falcons
i dont even wanna bother checking twitter rn i just know were getting roasted by everyone
im
were literally down the same amount as the week 3 game last year lmao
its the hope that kills you


what were all thinking
at least were dominating on special teams
im optimistic the missed pat and fg will work in our favor
give dobbins the damn ball you drafted him in the second round for a reason
p s andy reid is a very good coach hes going to have them come out in the third and go for the kill shot
hey its just 17 points

feels like 30000
i hate blaming the refs but as soon as that bullshit tripping call came in i knew exactly how this game was gonna go
lets double our passing yards at least this drive

not asking for much
seahawks fan here ravens are my afc team because of family you guys have got a whole half left dont stress it youve got this
oh my god running works
now well run it when we dont have that kind of time titans all over again
when did mark andrews forget how to catch
man andrews is looking like complete and utter dogshit
i never keep up with commentators and who is who but these guys are absolute trash almost as bad as whoever is running our fake fans sound
2 possession game but fuck man that hurts
i swear whenever we have an off game everyone is literally off
fuck andrews man teach this dude how to fucking catch
death taxes justin tucker
at least we know who the better kicker is now
this is tough to watch hate to think this way but the coaches and players do not seem able to get properly prepared and execute in big games
andrews hands are bricks tonight 2 for 7 targets missed at least 2 very catchable balls cant best the best when our studs arent doing it
lj fort is our diamond in the rough
gotta admit that was a really dumb call by kc there thanks alot
love you mandrews but time for some tough love llama dont look that mans way even if hes got 30 yards of separation
please dont drop fucking passes here
i want to see devin duvernay and jk dobbins on the field
the steelers defense is better we getting lit up by a future hof they got lit up by jeff driscoll lmaooo
if we stayed with running the ball this game could look very different
if actually ran the ball the first half this chief d would be gassed the fuck out right now
clock doesnt stop when going out of bounds until i believe 5 min left in each half

just fyi
one score game get the fairweather fans the fuck out please
friendship with andrews ended boyle is my new best friend
boyle can catch thank god
you know it aint andrews night when lamar looks for boyle in the end zone
just about now is when marcus peters comes flying across our screen and takes it to the house
sucks for the folks who already left for the parking lot
is wink physically capable of not calling a blitz
judon gets owned on the blitz wink calls another heavy blitz and gives up the edge mahomed runs for easy 1st down i am shocked i tell you
judon poopoo
the third down conversions are killing me
oh no we suck again
another issue with playing the wrs so far off the los is it give mahomes so much room to move if he breaks
holy fucking shit soo should have traded judon to some sucker team and signed clowney
need a turnover or buttkiss miss
imagine if we played half decently in the first half fuck
why does that play work all the time when every team but us does it
almost no chiefs pass is contested at the point of the catch
completely out coached every trick play has just destroyed us
cant wait to watch that play on repeat for the next week
ravens are straight up getting outcoached and outplayed drops questionable playcalling penalties absolute choke job
all im gonna say is lewis reed would never
imagine getting paid 17 million to have 5 tackles so far judon is such a bum
matthew just because i keep getting pancaked doesnt mean i dont deserve to be paid like an elite pass rusher judon
i will riot if we resign judon
are we do we have an o line
the fuck happened to our line man
entire team played like shit except duv and tuck
why do we continue to shit the bed in these big games hopefully this lights a fire under the teams ass
this might have been one of the sorriest showings ive seen them play from all aspects other than duvernays td return i cant think of a single thing that went right pass rush nonexistent offensive line nonexistent run game forgotten pass game atrocious as usual pass defense way too weak
let this be a learning experience gus should be getting 1015 carries a game minimum dont abandon the run

oh and also we desperately need a pass rusher a safety and ol help yes weve gotten outcoached but dont let that overshadow the serious holes we have on this roster that will continue to get exposed against elite teams if theyre not addressed
i got flashbacks to the titans playoff game throughout this one just seemed like we were on the backfoot almost the entire game but the ravens gave us glimmers of hope throughout
well i guess this was better than sitting in the stands at the titans game trying to moderate on my phone
im gonna feel really bad for washington once all the anger from this loss comes to fruitionshame we abandoned the run
at least the browns didnt do this to us
chiefs defense is no joke and lamar still almost had 100 rushing yards he missed that pass to hollywood throwing it short but thats 1 bad throwits going to happen

i thought the defense was much more to blame i feel like the chiefs didnt punt the ball all night this is supposed to be the best defense in the league
give credit where credit is due these are disgustingly well done play calls
lamar just had a bad night no way around it big games seem to be a struggle for him honestly thats scary but we still have plenty of season left
what the fuck is wrong with some of the people in this thread its a disappointing performance from a lot of people absolutely its not a fun match to watch but greg roman must be fired 8 is a running back were a national embarrassment and need to rebuild were 224 with jackson roman were playing against the goddamn chiefs its true were not playing nearly as well as we expect but some people need to get their bandwagon asses out of here or calm the fuck down
this feels like the titans game again
alright so if youre gonna shit on this team after basking in our victories over the past 2 years you can fuck right off


those who will stay lets root for this team to at least make it a one possession game by the end of the 4th hopefully good things come from this team after this first half beating weve taken so far
imagine being hyped a whole week for this

lets destroy the football team
blame of the game is andrews anyone who says otherwise didnt watch the first half
that was not a good call at all
seems like we got hyper conservative on those two pass plays oddly enough
we were running all over them why tf we passin on that 3rd and 3
butker has a poster of tucker in his bedroom
greg roman cannot get cute with the play calling this game
ill take a lead to start the game
a little known rule you might not know is that holding rules actually dont apply to the the kc chiefs ol
tucker butker
and romo said hes the best in the league
better than tucker lol
buttlickers reign as 1 lasted a whole week lmfao
fuck this ref
oh its going to be one of those games refs
ah i see the refs have decided early on that the ravens are not allowed to win this game
these refs suck lol watch them penalize tavon again
harbs unhappy and rightfully so
harbaugh is a god damn hero
thanks refs
alright lets go d put mahomes on his ass
are we trying to win without making a tackle or what
campbells a big boi eh
alright campbell earn that money
regardless of how we defend this drive were getting 5 wide on 1st down next drive playoffs roman
defense is having their aggressiveness used against them someone needs to calm them down
we need this type of game how things are going will only make us better for the season
i need lamar to put on a mixtape show next drive
we better be drafting a pass rusher next year
jihad ward is always making plays wolfe never is really think we should stick with ward
outcoached again
wooooooow theyre clowning our defense right now shit
best defense in football

the chargers held the chiefs down for 3 quarters longer than we have so far
how many screens can be thrown at us before we learn to stop it
devin jacoby duvernay
all you hating fucks get out
our poor defense tho lmao
justin kicker might as well be his name lol
im glad we brought jacoby jones back
now everyones going to act like they werent saying we were dogshit i love this fan base six days a week but fuck you guys are annoying on game day
fuck it offense runs thru duv tonight
defense gets no break time to wake up
justin kicker is back
run it down their throats
even lamar is sick of all the commercials
excellent job by proche there most ravens past wouldve faircaught that
duv was flying
joe biden will raise the price of peanut butter and the only thing standing between us and alien invasions is tonald drump
and we abandon the run for no reason
3rd and 6 throw it 3 yards every time
fucking hell roman dont give up on the run so god damn quick
perfeft throw to andrews there tbh
man fuck greg roman every fucking time he does this shit
finally the new fans can get a taste of real ravens football
roman and shitting the bed against the chiefs name a better combo
poor decision making why are we throwing 3 downs for fuck sake im having flashbacks of tennessee run the motherfucking ball
3rd down throw short of the sticks classic ravens football
why did we stop running it calm down guys and slow the pace
really love this play calling passing has always been our strongest hand who even runs the ball anyway
50 year old james harrison would be an upgrade over this pass rush
feels like the titans game these balls need to be caught help a qb out
we are playing one of the worst run defenses in the league we had the best run offense last year we kept four rbs on the roster 3 active tonight and we have the most electric running qb ever in the game why the fuck are we passing every fucking play
im tired of watching mahomes pass the ball 10 yards down the field and roman is calling this dinkdunk bs
that was a clean jump
why do we always look like a peewee team against the chiefs
not timed no hold call ok im drinking kool aid this is some bullshit lets overcome but some rough things happening
judon wasnt offside wtf
i need a replay of the judon offside penalty
juiceman played that well hats off to mahomeshill

sheesh
so whose ready for 3 straight passing plays and a threeandout
were making the chiefs look unbeatable even though they have rice paper run defense why arent we running the ball
theres that goddamned play again they need to fucking stop it
wait the chiefs are allowed to have penalties
this is laughable
they are going to have to at least pretend like they can throw deep to hollywood
holy fuck why did i hype myself up for this shit
harbaugh had better give this gaggle of fucking pillocks an absolute bollocking in the dressing room

this is fucking ridiculous
are you kidding right now seven passing yards
were being exposed theyre walking over our defense and containing our offense
im sure i speak for all of us fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuckity fucking fuck
yay everything we call isnt working
this is so much worse than the score fuck this is bad
oh no titans flashbacks
its just 10 points
its just 10 points
its just 10 points
holy shit that tackling is awful
play calling hasnt been the best but yall are bias as fuck if you cant see that lamar looks like shit right now
this isnt even the titans game this is the fucking chargers game with shittier defensive play on our part
ok yes this game is over the way were playing but dont lose hope when the baltimore ravens shit the bed it is a collective effort these arent bad players and this is not a bad team we just didnt prep and got our teeth kicked in this one is on the coaches for their soft ass play calling
fairweather fans out

not fairweather just pissed
we are free as fuck right now bruh i know mahomes is fucking legit but christ man he almost has 300 yds passing before half time where is our elite defense
absolutely nothing lamar can do about that ridiculous that he gets sacked that quickly when theyre only rushing 4
why do we miss every potential sack
this might be the most humiliating first half ive seen in nfl history
please go back and watch judon on that second down play

trust me do it
is ingram out

why do we always abandon the run in high stakes games

its what got us here
just like the titans game pathetic had chances in the first quarter but instead they decide to be cute play scared not catch balls and play with a defeatist attitude
judon is the guy who wants get paid like a top 3 guy but he wants to shitdick half of his plays fuck him
mahomes has someone open every single play
we keep blitzing a blitz beater and expect to compete on d

defense hasnt been the problem today inept offense but good lord stop shooting yourself in the foot
fuck greg roman
well at least we are showing tucker is the better kicker
good thing butker sucks
hahahahahahahahahah debate over

at least its clear as day who the best kicker is
we get embarrassed on national tv but at least tucker wins the kicking war
well at least we will walk away knowing tucker buker
that drop summed up the first half pretty well id say
is it just me or do mandrews hands just fucking disappear in big games
steve what jumped out at you about the first half

extremely long silence

same man same
i talked so much shit at the end of the work day fuck gonna pay tomrw
hey its only week 3 gotta improve a ton obviously cant win every game gotta play the half of our lives to win
young needs to fire his hair and make up crew
i feel like the offense could score on every possession here on out and we would still lose defense getting torched
wow we are making his chiefs defense look like the 85 bears defense out there wtf
it makes me sad how old berman looks
the last time we won a game after trailing at the half was against the browns in november of 2016
shit night for sports

stars are losing and the ravens are losing this sucks

edc needs to have a cometojesus talk with harbs and the coordinators this big game bedshittery must end then he needs to get on the fucking phone and make something happen re pass rushers

windows in this league are super short and realistically we cant afford to be the manning colts if lamar is going to run as much as he does though i know we have been pulling that back a lot as that reduces his shelf lifehow long we have him for
is it time to consider dropping roman if this continues where he pisses himself and completely abandons the run if were down at all this is the titans game all over again or the week 4 browns game or the chiefs game last year if were down at all abandon the run and call the most predictable dink and dunk passing possible never mind that lamars been one of the best deep ball throwers the past two weeks when he panics youd think we were in the marty flacco era with how spineless and predictable it is having at least 34 drops certainly isnt helping
harbaugh or roman shit the bed not calling at least one timeout during that fumble drive we had three and were moving the ball effectively could have used one to save at least 15 seconds and set up a game plan for the rest of the drive
i still dont get it how do you march down the field running the ball and then just abandon it entirely they could not stop the run
i changed jerseys so were good now guys dont worry
mahomes is about to drag wink martinsdales wife on the field and fuck her and he wouldnt be able to stop that either
if the offense wastes this fumble and doesnt get a td i might crg
its crazy our dbs force more fumbled than our fucking dl and olbs lol
we shouldve paid zardarius smith
did lamar just double his pass yards
1st down accomplished
hollywood what are you doing dude
hollywood fucking stretch forward my god
catch the fucking ball andrews fuck me man
andrews ffs when you touch your own balls do you drop them too come on
at least we have jt got a game again defense time to play big
it should be more than a 14 point game honestly based on how were playing
again lamar has not been good tonight but holy shit mark andrews has been awful
jesus christ andrews fucking sucks tonight
i see the mark andrews from the titans game has appeared
everyone wants to talk about how lamar doesnt show up in big games its mark andrews who doesnt show up swear every time theres a big game he cant catch
this is why mark andrews will not get paid like he wants to be
defense is gonna need another takeaway probably 2 if we wanna win this game
andrews needs to undress and sit on the bench the rest of the night seriously im not just venting here
lamar aint the problem
i hope lamar has the patience to not fucking lose his goddamn mind on andrews for royally fucking the game
can mp stop covering from fucking 10 yards away
lets goooo come on
7 here and its a ballgame
that andrews td wouldve been great right now but i still believe
can we stop blitzing please

mahomes is gonna keep making good throws even under pressure hes too good focus on putting the pressure on receivers so we can get some picks or at least stop them constantly driving up field
freaky l about to wake up i feel it coming
these commentators are horrid get andrews more involved are we watching the same game he drops everything thrown his way tonight
we need to go for it on any fourth that is 4 yards or less
da wheels on da bus go round n round
is this the endzone
no this is the redzone
well how do we get to the endzone
number 35 bus
gus is the best rb on this team
keep ingram on the fucking bench
uh why did the 3rd just end lamar went out of bounds
i swear the announcers look like they dont want the ravens to come back
boyle slamming his meat on the table lets fuckin gooooooooooooooooo
boyle doing a mandrews impression
friendship ended with andrews

now boyle is my best friend
friendship ended with mandrews boyle is my best friend now
big dick nick will go hard
so mad that andrews didnt hold on to that td now
im gonna fucking weep if we pull this out im really proud of this team already
whyyyyy is there so much andrews hate tonight lol i get it he dropped a couple balls but yeeeeesh you peeps are ruthless
legit though that was picked almost shat myself

cmon boys lets go
dont blitz tell your 4 guys they need to get nasty
ive seen fewer holes in a fucking pineapple dwelling sponge our secondary is ass
i just want this man to be sacked
i think im just angry cause mahomes is so good
all judon does is fall on his face whenever he rushes the passer

the dude is useless most overpaid trash heap in the league
were doing all this scheming for judon and hes still not getting home
im generally a matt judon apologist but the guy could not possibly be playing any worse
judon not getting paid this offseason
why does our rush fall over all the time
deshon elliot is not good
judon more like judoff amirite haha pain
give me a fucking break god damnit lose the game on that 3rd down conversion and a td to a fat fucking ol kill me
our d has never played well against the chiefs lets just be honest this is the 3rd time theyve choked against them
wink has the adjustment of a speeding freight train endless heavy blitzes even though mahomes has been eating them alive all game long youd think hed learn at some fucking point and adjust its like im watching a madden defense
man welp atleast we were hyped as fuck for about 10 minutes
there is zero reason that drive should ended in a touchdown with the chances we had

pitiful
how have they not been called for a single hold this game
is that coach ted lasso available
at least we won the biggest battle of this game tucker vs butker
also its pretty funny seeing the steelers fans in the rnfl thread they actually think they are the better team after playing some of the worst teams in the league
why is jackson dropping back 10 damn yards each play i get trying to give yourself space but jesus
this o line is an embarrassment
our oline is a huge problem
our oline can make judon look good
welp thats game if this kind of loss had to happen im happy it happened in week 3 but we have things to improve upon its like the browns loss in week 4 of last year its not that im pressing panic its that i think there are adjustments to be made luckily i think the team and coaching staff can do it
we need to get over this mental big game barrier as its the same narrative each time lose identity play from behind and make mistakes
lamar has to hit that pass he missed brown on that destroyed all hope
i think we can still win a shit load of games this year but winning against the teams that count is where im concerned we cant beat machines blitzing him if we have the pleasure of playing the chiefs in the playoffs we cant do this shit against them man do i ever hate matthew judon
dont understand why we played so scarred in the first half
definitely should be 51 headed into the steelers game thatll be a good barometer to see improvement
blame of the game 1horrible play calling 2judon cant be max and be a non factor unacceptable
dude literally had someone riding on his back
the chiefs screens have worked every time against us every attempt the last 3 years
so did this team forget how to tackle
hard for lamar to look good when he has no time to throw hard to get a completion when your wrs get zero separation hard to win with a running offense when behind
lamar doesnt have a bad arm we have awful route combos i think he could make mose of these throws that mhomes has made tonight
my biggest anger tonight is the amount of zone coverage we ran tonight we have the corners to matchup zone coverage against mahomes is a death wish
losers formation never seen that one before nice last punch to the nuts to end the night
hopefully the football team becomes our punching bag next week
when we didnt go 4th in the first i knew something was wrong
gus wasnt even part of the picture thats a problem
they didnt call any holding thats cool i guess
at least all these fake ass fans can hop off the bandwagon
this is another step of growth for the ravens being able to come back from these types of games i have confidence in spite of the first half that theyll look competent in the second half
outcoached everywhere but special teams coaches learned exactly nothing from the titans loss abandon the run when you are down by 3 points blitz every single 3rd down and never get a stop
so the defense was terrible lamar was terrible andrews was awful oline was terrible worst part was the coaching dreadful coaching

my biggest fear is that this team cant handle adversity were 27 games into the lamar era and there has never been a single defining comeback moment this team gets down its over also judon sucks also andrews randomly decides to suck at inopportune times he was awful against the titans i worry this team shrinks in the spotlight all of them including lamar
wow this trump ad is just fucking lies
jesus christ as a chiefs fan that was an abysmal call there
how much did they get to be in that trump commercial
big hold by the centre gotta call those
ill never expect this team to beat the chiefs or win a playoff game until i see it happen we shouldnt be getting embarrassed by the chiefs every time
lets never have a gif war again
tucker cant miss kicks if we dont get into scoring position butker has already missed two checkmate motherfuckers
the chiefs are not the falcons i cant see them giving up a 3 score lead theyre too disciplined and too good they wont get complacent
mark gus edwards ingram and orlando ronnie stanley brown
they took queen out the game
matt judon is worthless
their playcalling is miles ahead
i swear baker mayfield has more commercials than he has wins
does hearing commentators talk about truzz make anyone else mega cringe
why didnt we run that shit
why would you have andrews block on a pass play on 3rd down
got way too cute at the end of that drive bleh
we needed 3 damn yards they couldnt stop the run just run it twice
this defense looking bad right now
a lot of money to judon to not be able to fucking set an edge
hahahahahaa shank
fuck yeah tucker wins already
haha remember when this guy was better than tucker
best kicker in the league
well were in the same position the chiefs were a few minutes ago
people acting like we aint playing possibly the greatest offense of all time yall need to calm
tucker still the bestno arguments
aint it nice to have the best kicker in the nfl
what is this feeling being stressed by a regular season game im already stressed
he was the best kicker in football for literally a week lmaoo you know where to find the

at the bank
saints fan here ravens are definitely my afc favorite always love seeing mark ingram play lets get that win baby
what the fuck are these calls
these calls are bullshit
damn harbaugh is furious
x200b

john harbaugh not happy with the refs understandably so
thats a really bad call
thats a fucking block

fuck off
tripping what a bs call
its clear that the nfl thinks mahomes is better for the league and these flags are proof
drop dead ref crew
abandoned the run already forced to pass
offense is looking off and uninspired again just like they did last week despite actually doing ok
well the refs did their job to take our edge off
greg is shitting the bed hard this drive
couldnt protect against a 4man rush fml
what a bullshit call
why do we always try to be fucking cute against strong teams
and the refs stop the drive with a tripling call
one bad call ends in disaster
calls have been down since week 1 and now they start getting flag happy on the biggest mnf game probably this entire season
these refs are always out to get us when we play them
chill mofos its 10 min into the first well figure it out we need these kinds of games
the nfl is treating the chiefs like the patriots now fuck them and fuck mahomes
jesus yall gotta relax it might actually be good to get the team some experience playing from behind with pressure on and harbs is the king of halftime adjustments so just breathe for a sec lol
obviously some bullshit calls by the ref but we still look like shit regardless id rather our kick in the teeth come week 3 against mahomes than in the playoffs again tho
at least humphrey came to play
just stop blitzing it doesnt work against mahomes
yes play 10 yards off of kelce

brilliant strategy
lb inexperience is gonna make screens an issue and reid is a screen king
i think that tackle by humph was the only time so far we were able to tackle a chief with only 1 defender lol
the defense isnt doing great but at the end of the day not many defenses do good against mahomes

the offense on the other hand needs to get their shit together and look like theyre playing with some confidence
we probably would be ahead if it wasnt for that bullshit tripping call
judon starting that late hit bs again
goddamn we look sluggish as hell lets gooooo
peters better come up with a pick to make up for playing like garbage right now
having no pass rush will be the end of this team why didnt we go after clowney
you guys are the least fun when we are losing literally 34 of the game left
judon with that late hit again i hate that shit
at least last year we were rocking mahomes duringafter the throw hes been mostly clean all game save for screens
their play design is so creative
we have to get a td this drive or this is gonna get out of hand
chiefs play calling so far has quite literally been flawless need to make some adjustments the multiple options plays are really throwing us for a whirl
holy shit i never want to see anyone laugh at another thread being negative again
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv
finally some life
lets go we needed that
the new jacoby jones
jacoby flashbacks
justin kicker
justin kicker is back for the ravens
justin kicker is right
d gonna be gassed tho
cmon defense
i know its extremely pessimistic but the defense getting gassed and then having to go right back out after we scored a quick td like that worries me a bit

hopefully the morale boost offsets that
havent seen shit like that since jacoby jones
only thing our defense has to go back on the field and i know theyre already tired
love to see it taken to the house but would also like to see the d have a moment to catch its breath
got the fucking stop boys
all

part

of

the

plan
that return td did a lot more than give us 7 points rejuvenated the whole squad
ravens force a 3 and out
nice catch on that return dont ever fuckin do it again
proche wants his now our young rookies hungry you love to see it fuck a flock hater baby whoooo whooooo big mf trusssss
we need to get proche and duverney more reps at receiver theyve been nothing but productiveeee
uh someone should tell steve levy that devin duvernay isnt back there fielding that punt because that isnt even his job
okay lamar finally woke up
this game alone had better punt and kick returns than we did all of last season lmao
inozziewetrust
the donald needs to raise his own fucking taxes
i swear its like we just decided to stop running
flacco flashbacks 3rd and 6 we throw for 2
abandoned the run again
god the offense just went 2018
the offense doesnt feel relaxed not in sync they like us here need to focus
i would just like to point out that we are still averaging 10 yards per carry and we are refusing to run the ball
roman once again abandons the run

why arent we running
we didnt even run once wtf
ah yes call a 3 yard cross on a 3rd and 6
getting tennessee vibes from this game
i dont like this playcalling
3 passes in a row yeah that worked so well against the titans too
establish the run game
2 drops in a row when we marched down the field on the first drive with all runs what the actual fuck is going on

this is literally the titans playoff game
this is exactly how we lost that playoff game

passed too much no one caught a ball defense got tired and got beat
abandon the run drop passes and throw short of the marker sounds like a recipe for success
shit play calling we were running it down their throats earlier why
kc has one of the worst rush defenses in the league

hey lets throw it on 3 downs in a row
why this team starts panicking and abandoning their main strategy whenever they go behind is beyond me smash mouth offense only works if you continually pound the ball
this is just like the titans game we abandon the run for no fucking reason and start digging the hole deeper when theres no reason to roman gets spooked as soon as were down by anything at all and abandons our bread and butter
andrews drops a 30 yard pass and roman calls some bullshit on 3rd down again
greg roman all you need to do is call normal plays its 2nd and 6
greg roman one quadruple coverage special coming right up
thats not offside thats perfect timing
peters getting pooped on
just bench judon
did they not have brandon williamss jersey
imagine paying judon more than the league minimum
cant blame all this on the defense the offense looks worse
the guy controlling the fans needs to run the dfence chant not the boos
thats what happens when you punt to mahomes n company and dont capitalize
we are just getting beat on all levels but special teams
what a bullshit offsides
the refs shit is bullshit but lets not act like our defense is playing well now were gonna come out and throw the ball three more times then were in trouble
can duvernay get us another td

because our wrs and tes cant do shit for us at the moment and roman seems to have forgotten about the run game
that was an amazing pass credit
run the goddamned ball
the run was working stay with it
tough to rush the passer when youre getting strangled every play
judon didnt move until the center snapped it was close but i dont think thats an offsides
we are a running team run the fucking ball
run the ball 6 min drive score 7 down by 3 at half our defense hasnt had a breather all night greg is probably not gonna run it 10 more times this game it is absolutely ridiculous
bad calls so far imaginary hands to the face tripping and offsides on judon
wtf is this offense
yikes what happened to our offense
all of lamars passes have looked off not good
snead and boykin took each other out on that play
this offense is built on the run why are we not using it more often were only down ten run the damn clock down score and then come back after halftime this is so frustrating to watch get ready for the 4th quarter almost comeback
ravens realize the chiefs get the ball in the second half right
we have more missed tackles than yards on offense
lamar looking pretty average tonight
unfortunate but this team disappears when even a little bit of pressure is on them they dont have the grit or the leaders like the 2012 team did
in comes the people that cry about us being negative when we are looking like ass rn
my god run the ball stop abandoning it
why is literally everyone except duvernay playing like trash this is embarrassing af
ravens have lost around 20 straight games when trailing at the half dont see that changing
being down is our obvious weakness when were down we dont run the ball for some reason and it really hurts us
can they stop with the freaking cheering noise wtf
stop being so down this is the sb winning team we are an amazing team
i get we cant entirely blame one person but what is with roman and not knowing how to call plays
everything about this game is awful holy shit
i hope harbaugh absolutely lays into this fucking team in the locker room at halftime we are getting completely embarrassed on national tv and were supposed to be the team that can beat kc
its only 10 points guys things can change but i understand the complaints not looking good
this is not baltimore football lamar looks like hes alone out there and the defence is playing scared not physical at all im so confused as to what the fuck is going on here
why blitz 44 we are playing fucking stupid
3rd and 14 and you blitz your best db

only martindale

dude is clueless
incoming huurrr durrr why are u guys overreacting bitchstfu were getting blown out
you

cant

blitz

mahomes

please

fucking

stop

it
dale and greg need to do laps around the whole stadium until we say stop
judon is ass
people can keep karma grabbing with the its not over yet or theres still plenty of football left nonsense but the defense has quit and the offense hasnt done shit since the first drive this game is over
i just dont get it were literally unrecognizable against the chiefs
im bringing out the wine if they score again
jesus fucking christ we have to lead the league in most times gently caressing the qb without getting a sack
the chiefs defense is not good how the fuck is our offense this bad
playoff litmus test and failing on all cylinders lol
cant wait for the comeback attempt that amounts to nothing lol
thought the chiefs d was supposed to be trash wtf is this
were getting outcoached
what the fuck

no juice at all defense playing soft and scared offensive play calling is worse than shit andy reid outclassing our coaching this is embarrassing
mahomes isnt even looking for 1st down at this point lol hes literally looking for a td every play 1st down is an easy alternative if he finds nothing for td
butker is officially on fraudwatch
lmfao get fucked butker
tonights silver lining tucker is leagues above butker and its never been close
win or lose at least the media will shut the fuck up about butker
this is why clowney was needed but i guess we didnt need it
does lamar have something wrong with him i mean seriously this is real bad maybe its all mental
whole team needs a snickers
what the fuck mandrews has had like 4 balls hit him in the hands
well harbs is coach of the year so lets see what he comes up with
why cant anyone catch the fucking ball
lessons learned from the first half defense needs to wake up offense needs to get their shit together butker aint shit tucker is still the goat
the chiefs know our offense is shitting the bed so they can just chill and take deep shots down field its worked so far
can we at least make it close please
how about we run the ball after halftime
christ i am not drunk enough for this shit
maybe this will be like the browns loss last year make us realize that hype doesnt win games and actually play good football
greg roman taps head cant let the chiefs get a good run defense if you dont run the ball
i really dont care if we lose

i just hope we show up we deserve some sense of good plays for once

please
something i have noticed our team reads way to many headlines we need to have a ravens cabin and make these guys live with no fucking internet so they can stop googling them selevs and watching talk shows say shit about them all the time focus on football stop getting in your head and making big games these massive deals i cant see why we play so soft against teams in big games like this other than the team just sitting and watching first take and undisputed and thinking we already w0n we are sooooo g0od
why is thatwhen we are behind we just give up
andy reid is working us i mean at least its week 3 but holy shit this is a red flag
removed
id pay good money to absolutely snap steve levys jaw
cant wait to do literally anything with this ball for the love of god please
thank you chuck for being a competent safety
its not the break we deserved but is the break we needed
gotta score now
we need a td on this drive if we want to win
didnt learn a damn thing
how did yanda leaving make the left side of the line so much worse
illegal snap how in the fuck
what the absolute fuck
why the fuck is romans passing so fucking predictable and conservative when were down this playcalling is embarrassing as fuck by roman nothing but screens and dinks and dunks if youre gonna throw let him stretch the field
stick your arms out
ngl i kinda forgot lamar can scramble like that with the amount hes been passing
how was that not illegal contact from hitchens leveled ingram downfield way before any pass
oh look at that running the ball is working

entirely different game if they stuck with the run jesus this is so frustrating to see this working so good in the 3rd quarter
wait you mean kc cant stop the run didnt we see that on the first drive
this is a fucking joke
we only need 5 more from tucker and we win we got this
2 7 minute drives for 6 points
how do you let yourself get a false start on 4th down
i miss yanda
not gonna lie mark is my guy but i still get annoyed at him shouting at lamar in the browns loss last year for a bad pass seeing as he makes so many inexcusable mistakes
andrews with two bad drops just like the titans game please show up in big games mark thank you
incoming pick 6 lehhgooooo
okay so we dont stick to the run game early when we go back to it the passing game opens up when the passing game opens up our receivers te cant catch nice
why is everyone wide fucking open
btw now i understand how annoying it is when a broadcasting team sucks off lamar theyve had mahomes dick in their mouth all night long
run the ball
it aint over this is what happens when you stick to your identity
pls start a comeback
fuck yes defense
thats what im talking about now can we please put up an offensive touchdown
my word defense did something lets get 3 more on the board
if we win this game im ordering a lamar jersey 5 seconds after this game ends
jesus fuck wolfe literally looked like an animal there i was scared of him from my home
it honestly seems like theyre try to fuck around with us i really hope it bites them in the ass
im telling you if they wast the next drive with passes im going to board a plane come to baltimore and tell them not to do it again
i really just want them to come back and give them a game that would give me so much more faith in this team than i had at halftime
get him involved he drops everything thrown at him
im fully prepared for the inevitable mahomes patented fuck you he has the past 2 times to shatter me
unleash the gus bus
theres 16 minutes left in this game and you need at least 2tds maybe snap the ball with more than 3 seconds on the clock once in a while
defense finally getting turnovers

offense is getting back to what made it good

oh yeah it all coming together
run the fucking ball with gus bus where has this been
why couldnt we have this play calling in the 1st half
i thought the clock was suppose to stop
glad we decided to remember how to run the ball when its late in the second half
imagine if

the chiefs blew a 2710 lead
how come we always bring out this guy only at the middle of the 3rd and he immediately starts tearing up the field
ride that bus
playing like shit in the first half was all part of the plan now we have them where we want them andy reid is playing checkers while harbaugh is playing 8 dimensional chess
to nobodys surprise we break out the heavy personnel sets and start running our way down the field its almost like were a runfirst team or something
thats our pass catching tight end nick boyle
toooooouuuuuuuchdown ravens
boyle staying late tonight to give mandrews catching lessons
were down 7 lets fucking go defense get a stop cuz theyre about to hit us hard
game would be tied if it werent for all the drops in 1st half
yes the other white 80something tight end
it literally feels like the chiefs have played a near perfect game and we have played a terrible game yet were only down by 7 with a quarter to play
boyle stole andrews hands
i need a marlon strip and i need it now
yo these blitzes are fucking telegraphed to em
even when we get there he makes the play mahomes may be the best qb ive ever seen fuck him right now but respect where its due
this fake crowd noise is grating
matt judon is terrible
i want judon off this team so bad
again judon non factor would prefer another guy with a hand in the dirt covering kelce or in a soft zone all better options than wasting a body blitzing a guy who will just run past judon every time
judon is a moron
i miss z
we need to stop doing these fruity fuckin blitzes w judon line him up on the edge and contain ffs
looks like your body being made by taco bell isnt helping you eh judon
the amount of miscommunication on a long week is killing us how do you have an extra day and leave dudes wide the fuck open
judon has to be the worst player to get franchise tagged
lol left tackle even scored
lol they are seriously trying to embarrass us and its happening
its incredible to me how wide open everyone is
out coached all game
our defense man just getting schooled
pass rush continues to be imaginary
titans game ptsd intensifies
gg chiefs id rather it be you than the steelers good night all im too pissed off drunk to watch the rest of this
holding offensive line no penalty first down
coaches need to look in the mirror kc came with a creative gameplan while our guys went through the motions
as pissed as i am it is literally taking some sort of ridiculous performance from the consensus best offense ever to beat us like this the refs have surely made some bad calls but i wont blame them for this game greg roman needs to pull his dick out of his own ass and actually create a game plan
not a ravens fan refs are a serious problem in the nfl this season it was a miracle the bills won yesterdays game absolutely fuckery by the refs no appreciation for small market teams
oline cant block for shit
lamar has played atrocious
what the fuck was that lamar
yanda where have thou gone
lamar has 0 time to pass
welp bring on the football team
i miss yanda
thats not on boykin
we can only play with a lead
even ronnie stanley out here allowing sacks
bullshit effort by the oline this game they always look like crap against kc and for no good reason either
we should try having our d line protect lamar when theyre out there no one gets to the qb
love the guy but thats on lamar both sacks he could have escaped forwards but he felt the pressure and panicked backwards into a sack
they made the chiefs look better than they are like the chiefs are good but the ravens outplayed themselves so many times they didnt stand a chance im so irritated
the sad fact of the matter is every year the ravens say this year well prove we can win big games and not choke and then they lose big games and choke
if we had a true 1 better oline and one quality pass rusher wed be a true threat
crazy how many times this dude catches in the middle of the field
terrible gameplan terrible play all around be better next week
drove all the way up the field our first drive running the ball then nothing
judon gets paid a lot of money
sooo we all saw lamar pissed because they called a bunch of slants all game and only gave him 5 chances to throw it more than 15 yards right there are holes on the roster but offensive play calling from the beginning was awful we are a rhythm team and never let lamar get in rhythm in the beginning running then nonstop passing will never work and i dont know what happened to our defense hopefully edc reacts like the cleveland loss last year and makes some magic out of free agents gotta be able to get some peoples practice squad players
go ravens onto the football team
trump raised my taxes

wow theres really people deluded like that out here for trump
here comes everyone on this thread imploding
play calling is shit idk why theyre playing so timid do what you do best pound the rock
oh fuck that commercial especially now
refs only like to call holds when they feel like it now
that was on lamar hes looked off all night
i really think kc is just in our heads we cant seem to get it together in this
just a brutal game for us incompletions because guys arent getting there in time mark andrews drops a beautiful ball in the endzone and then brown jr false start so we have to take the fg not our day of course lj will get blamed
yeah this one is over hopefully all the youre not real fans if you notice mistakes people will learn to shut the hell up and listen when fellow fans try to tell them the bad patterns we see obviously forming in thr first half
see yall next week talking like you never doubted the team
shitty oline and pass rush will be the death of this team really shouldve picked up clowney
i dont care if we go 151 this year when we get to the playoffs im expecting us to lose the first game ill expect us to lose in the playoffs until we win
were gonna slaughter the washington football team by 40 next week and its not even gonna be satisfying lmao
positive is that its the chiefs negative is that jesus fuck this team cant show up to big games no way we beat these guys unless lamar gets out of his own head
this team will never eclipse the 2000s defence with judon starting
i see the chiefs have truly reached the upper echelons of the league no holds ever called on their line thats how you know theyre for real
some of yall cant handle being down in a football game lmao
no holding on the tyreek hill run

soft hands to the face call to give them first down and steal our momentum

refball baby
refs stopped that drive for us horrible call absolutely awful
i think joe bidens going to raise my taxes
flag touched our golden boy 37 yard penalty automatic touchdown
lamar is the only qb that has to prove himself every fucking game
its getting real hard to disagree with the people that say were frauds when we keep shitting the bed in big games
50 shades of titans playoff game horrible play calling putting us in this deficit will make us abandon the run even more 21 chalk it up
sign ab and clone ed reed
tripping horse collar just giving the chiefs every bullshit fucking call
somebody get andrews a jelly bean or something
mannnnnn i realize the chiefs are likely the best offense of the decade but the defense must step up in these situations and they still dont reminiscent of every ravens season
yanda retiring is looking like a bigger lost than we thought
holy fuck our coordinators are retarded
third down conversions have killed us
can everyone please vote for biden we gotta get trump out immediately
letsgooooo
fuck em up boys lets gooooooooooooooo
can the analyst stop picking us
im nervous
lamar jackson
run the ball run the ball run the ball

after that run the fin ball
who rockin their black llama jersey
big truss
400 yrds rushing bet
fuck that play call man
that play design sucked no one even ran to the first down marker
that floating pocket play never seems to work theres never enough reads but roman seems enamored with it in the red zone
points are points against a powerhouse like this you take anything thats given
running on 2nd should have been an obvious decision but if we can rely on our offense to consistently run the ball like that then its game over even if we didnt get a td this drive
i dont give a shit about anyone proving shit wrong about pocket passing run the ball win the game throw 25 times for 4 tds rinse and repeat
well that was an incredibly shitty third down call
wow this is some ass defense
whelp that was too easy
that was really bad really bad
bum
wompwomp
lmfao
oof butker atleast it was a pat and not a fg
but butker was the goat s thanks he sure is
defense looks like total dog shit
that was so easy this guy needs to hop off the chiefs nuts
better than tucker my ass
best kicker btw
buckle up buttercups its gonna be a bumpy ride
god damnit already irl full of people saying we fucking suck and are going to lose these are the fans that piss me off the most
like bro why cant i just sit at the top of the stadium
there ya go refs its ok to be wrong pick that flag up
fuck these refs are they the replacements from 2012
i cant stand this refball bullshit man
dude that call is fucking bullshit
were playing refball tonight eh
tripping hahahahahaha
yeah get ready for this shit all night
bullshit call
let em play ref
what a horseshit call wow
refs calling the game tripping
refs always call some bullshit when we play kc
what the fuck are they doing
x200b

nearly a fumble by jackson loss of 9 yards
alright lets get our shit together
gro is smoking something right now throw the ball downfield involve playaction dont always move the pocket and take away half the field i dont even know why youd spread it without the threat of a rb run in the backfield
team needs to calm down
hate to say it but the chiefs d is looking way better than ours at the moment
that first penalty killed us
honestly the only thing that will make this even is a drive ending holding call
run the damn ball
just run the damn ball goddamnit
i remember gg comments in the 4th quarter back in the day

now every other comment is gg in the 1st
do we have the best officials tonight no
116 years of experience were calling tripping lmao
embarrassing from elliot
this is so sad to watch
whenever we have a seemingly nice pass rush its just a screen and they let us get pressure
defense isnt as good as they thought they were
man if theres any player i could bring back in his prime right now it would be terrell suggs
miss suggs and jj on the edge
at least the run d is great but the chiefs are like 9010 pass
run defense still alive
sloppy defense thats getting outplayed and an offense thats hobbled by the interior oline

anxiety levelsrisingrising
oh a 3rd and long what could possibly go wrong here
rest of the defense needs to follow humph and campbells leads

offense will be fine just needs to finish in the red zone and what can you do about that terrible tripping call
bend but dont break right
honestly what pisses me off is that roman has not learned after titans loss last year run working great yet as soon as the opposition scores and gets ahead completely abandons it for screens and shit
its not even mahomes we are giving wayyy too much cushion
if only we could clone 3 more calais campbells
that extra day got to them this aint the secondary im used to
god dammit
god queens having an awful game
time to see if lamar can keep his poise and play from behind
man credit to andy reid these play calls are gold
that was just a smart play cant get mad at that
id call this defensive play calling a joke but at least jokes are funny
defense needs to press the gas looks like theyre at 80 need to be 100
good news if we win well all be really happy bc we came back

and its not impossible
sweet play tho
offense is about to feast lfg
13 minutes in the half and you all keep whining god i fucking hate this sub sometimes take me back to this sub in 2012
damn the way he turned the corner on 34 was nice
return specialist confirmed
justin tucker makes that tackle
yall back now yall keep flip flopping just watch the game
thats exactly what we needed
doovernay

rhymes with

momentum
now watch the defense give up another easy td
devin jacoby duvernay
poor defense got no rest though
thats ravens football
that return injected life into the defense
alright matt pro bowler in a contract year judon were gonna need more out of you completely quiet this year so far
m o m e n t u m
easy 3 and out lets fucking go
momentumshifting credit to the defense there
ive got such a boner for this team
lamar needs to lead a td drive here this is massive
how about a nice long drive to end the half with a td
am i drink or does this announcer sound vaguely like joe rogan
endmaddenmonopoly
how fast in devin duvernay his max speed of 215 mph on the 93yard kickoff return for td was the fastest by a ravens ball carrier on a td in the last 5 seasons jamisonhensley
i fully believe all the negative energy released by this sub changed the universe and formed that return td
lol ozzie peeped himself on tv and pulled his mask up
im here to the rescue have no fear guys
hahaha ozzie got caught
ravens play design look sooo fucking basic compared to kc
i dont understand why we are throwing 3 times bruh
devin duvernays kickoff return touchdown wasnt just the first by any player this season and the first score of his nfl career it was also the first kick return td the ravens have had in nearly three years since bobby rainey housed a 96yarder in week 6 2017 ravensflock nflresearch
brown dropped it anyway receivers not catching tonight
can we fucking throw the ball past first down on third down fucking please greg
uhh greg you know their pass d is good and their run d is bad
why do we drop so many balls in big games
what an uninspiring drive really really really frustrating
so were just done running right
apparently block in the back doesnt apply to the chiefs either
everyone dropping the god damn ball
so i guess 3 points is enough of a deficit to abandon the run cmon roman
lets throw passes beyond the sticks greg
didnt run the ball once
why arent we running
boock in the back
yo dawg i heard you liked commercials so i put a commercial in your commercial
why arent we running
play calling sucks but andrews and hollywood gotta start stepping up and making plays when their numbers are called both dropped passes right in their hands
stop fucking getting cute greg roman run it down bruhh
its weird that the chiefs defense looks bad against everyone but us
literally reminiscent of tits game no run ball panic mode roman make big bad make lamar sad
and why are these routes not past the 1st down mark
roman spit the bit no reason at all to depart from a run first offensive after duvernays return dumb plus defense has been on the field too long we needed an extended time drive there
everyone in the world can see we need to run the ball including stevie wonder everyone except greg roman apparently
defense is gassed fucking romans dumb playcalling gets us a 3 and out and now the d is getting boned
defense needs a breather and we pass 3 times and put them right back out there
im so tired of reliving the same game over and over
they gonna call holding on kc tonight
judont
god this pass rush is such a joke
peters is gonna have one of those days when it fucking matters
hold on 71
judon may as well be wearing a chiefs jersey
that wasnt a hold on brandon williams or anything
the holding is so fucking blatant
defense has been cringe worthy
yo were never beating the chiefs
shit defense ed reed would be embarrassed
let me guess we are gonna pass pass pass and give it right back to them cool
i never want to listen to espn commentators again
this offense is going to take off this next drive lets hope we run the ball more lol
welp could mahomes just like not be himself for 5 minutes
guess we will see no penalties on kc this half clear holding not even called on that td smfh
harbaugh needs to make some serious adjustments at the half were still in this
we playing flacco ball
ive never seen someone abandon the run as fast as roman
lamar is having a shit game now how many passing yards does he have 15 or less
im straight up not having a good time
playing like flacco is out there right now
we look awful id be shocked if the chiefs dont get more points before halftime and we have 3 offensive points
man lamar is just a little off all night he needs to settle down
lamar looks like crap
this is a shit show performance
this feels like the playoff game not good
chiefs are dominating this is a blowout without the ko return not sure if its a matchup problem or if we are just playing like dogshit andor the chiefs are literally that much better
lamar had more yards on that opening run than he has the rest of the game unbelievable
legit dont know if i can keep watching this shitshow
jesus our own receivers are running into each other
maybe this team needed to get embarrassed to get the wake up call they need worked last year
7 passing yards with 4 minutes left in the half lmao
this isnt even on the defense at this point theyve been constantly on the field against what could end up being one of the best qbs of all time
its amazing watching a qb who can consistently throw 1st downs
this is looking ugly right now fellas
mahomes cant fucking miss and we have 7 yards
this is 2017 jags london or 2011 jags mnf levels of bad
im about to turn this crap off
lamar just doesnt have it right now just look at mahomes calm collected making the right plays

lamar needs to take these ls on the chin and come back stronger hopefully hell have the it factor by playoffs
am i more upset with us letting kc just throw around like we dont exist or that we cant get anything going on offense

regardless if there arent a bunch of angry fuckers raising hell in the lockeroom at halftime ill be disgusted
we just look bad
cant make a fuckin tackle
just gotta say you all are pretty miz on here
were bad tonight
goes down and ravens play scared still its like nothing had changed at all from last season
same shit they need to figure out how to play while down this would be a good game to do it
lots of missed tackles
dude roman is calling the most basic passing concepts can we get lamar some help we should be running jet sweeps and screens at least once per possession not shallow drag cross and pa on 3rd down
when the ravens game tonight is the only thing that helps you get through work today and then they play like this
dont care if we lose but we must play better that this

this is not us
not giving up but we seriously need to wake up
i cant help but feel like were missing a true leader on defense i know no one could ever match ray but jesus someone needs to get this team pumped up id even take old man suggs right now
3rd and 14 fucking joke of a defense
massacre totally embarrassing unbelievable
thats game we aint coming back from this
are you sure were losing because of lamar
2710 and they get the ball at half
someone tell me why the fuck were dropping our linebackers into coverage and blitzing our corners we need to cover them for fucks sake
i sound like such a hater but judon literally has zero impact on the game such a fraud
ravens have left the chat
no hoes were stunted on this half
but this sub told me deshon eliott was an upgrade from et lmao
why do you blitz your best corner on 3rd and 14 who the fuck does that
use your fucking timeouts
ball game

its gona be 4110 before we get the ball back
i hate the chiefs i hate the refs i hate the coaching one of the games of worse football in my life im not giving up on them but this is looking pretty pathetic
aint even competitive lmaooooo chargers looked better against the chiefs
yanda being gone has fcked us
why are they always so wide open
i said before the game that if we dont win we wont beat the chiefs for the next 2 years its become a mental block for us and a blowout makes it worse
we shouldve taken a time out on that last drive we rushed it
someone needs to take a stand in the locker room at half this isnt acceptable in the slightest
35 passing yards in an entire half lmao
gotta hate when the game is over by halftime
this is exactly what happens every time the ravens get away from their strengths and their game plan

panic lack of execution disaster
we are simply not built to beat this team
i hope everyone gets talked to during half time this is some bs play making and coverage
please make some trade for a pass rusher or o lineman who cares about the price
best kicker
the stanley cup finals are on if anyone is interested
god butker is dogshit
well at least no one is going to compare butker to tucker ever again
at least were winning the kicker battle
if we get anything out of this game at least people will shut the fuck up about butker being the best
butker is just as talented as tucker
at least all the bullshit butker talk can stop tucker is goat
im actually glad were down like this maybe well open up the fucking playbook were basically doing the same shit we did last year its not going to work against elite teams
i havent been this angry since the titans game
same shit as the playoff game completely abandoned the run kc is wearing our defense out
honestly we are lucky its still a game 17 is not that much for how we played
lmao only positive thing of tonight is assker
i love roman but i have little faith in his play calling from behind
did anyone show up mentally to this game players or coaches why are we playing so far off the ball its like were running prevent defense rn why did roman abandon the run again this has been a consistent pattern with roman he shits himself and abandons the run if we go down at all even worse is that the passing is predictable is all hell youd think were being coached by marty with this playcalling i dont think theres much left to be said about the d no one showed up outside of our front 7 minus judon whos somehow more useless than usual today secondary is getting fucking scorched mahomes is playing with them
lamar jackson has 35 yards
thats kinda how the first half has gone pretty much sums it up
we wont go far in the playoffs because if you take away the run game lamar cant come from behind with the pass game this team will win the division but thats it
lmao comical at this point
how is nobody catching a pass everyone ate popcorn before the game
why does this happen to andrews every time we play in primetime
not surprised about the defense shitting the bed ive said the last two weeks it was suspect to many downvotes but its baffling to me that the offense has been this outmatched by what was being called a pedestrian defense
time to drink bugs bunnys special stuff
arguably the worst half of football ive ever seen the ravens play
its just mind numbing to me that this teams greatest weaknesses going into the offseason were a horrific receiver corps and terrible pass rush

please tell me how either of these improved
just fuck my shit up fam
both roman and wink using madden suggested plays
i wanna cry
when lamar turns into vince young when the lights come on
we are gonna come out the half fired up get a sack and a stop then we right back in it just watch
i dont like losing
remember when roman went to interview with the browns right before the playoffs last year
i wonder what fa we can grab to help our pass rush would clay mathews add anything probably not maybe edc can get khali mack for a 5th
my only concern here is that this team has our number theres nothing wrong with losing to kc but we havent looked competitive the last 2 years
im not surprised the chiefs shred our secondary isnt this our second time meeting mahomes

lets get more tape by playing hard and move on
if the ravens dont think they have any haters to prove wrong anymore all they have to do is look itt time to show people how we come from behind please just run the ball
how we play in the second half here is how im going to judge this team going forward if we come back here and make it a close game i will be content even if we still lose if we let the chiefs continue to dick us then i will be worried very much about our super bowl chances
i still like roman but he abandoned the run when the score was 63all it took was for us to go down by 3 points and he lost all faith in the run game that marched us down the field with ease to start the game

all the idiots like to go after lamar for his struggles when we go down but this highlights that roman doesnt handle it well either
remember when lamar broke off a 32 yard run on the first drive and we all had hope sigh
onside kick to start the half who says no
this offense has 3 points
i get that we will take some shit for playing poorly the first half but that rnfl gdt is completely over the top with the hate being spewed at lamar and our team its all other fanbases too its too much
i was hyping this game up so hard pls i dont want to face the music just prove me right
seriously why not just pause the game and have the refs go blow andy reid
that was so obviously not a horsecollar wtf
kc defense good against the pass and bad against the run what does greg roman call 18 passing plays and 10 running plays

mahomes great against the blitz and only stopped by good coverage what does wink do blitz our best cover man constantly

are the chiefs not dangerous enough without the coaches playing right into their fucking hands
weak shit refs
fucking score here ravens fuck

edit score a td
oh please let us take advantage of this
if we get a touchdown then a stop we might have a sliver of a chance
refs didnt fuck us on that wow
wake the fuck up offense
lets hope thats the call that revs this team back into it
finally a break
knowing our luck theyll reverse it
update have no changed shirts and pants in case they got infected by my shirts bad juju
the break we needed if this offense has woken up at all we may have a game

i want to see lamar ascend to elite dragon jackson this drive
lets go now fucking run it down their throats
weve got a serious pass rush and oline problem imo
play calling still absolute ass
our playcalling sucks lol
we keep trying screens they keep getting blown up

can greg roman read the fucking room this is all the chiefs practice against
yeah i dont understand the play calling tonight abandon the run after the first quarter thats not who we are
shits bas when you csnt even snap it lmao
why would brown run backwards wtf
good play lamar
dude any other game brown would have caught that of course not tonight
oh look roman running the ball works you ignorant chucklefuck
now do we see what happens when we run
imagine if we did this in the first quarter
and andrews is having his one absolutely ass game of the year
ffs andrews

4th drop in a single game
mark andrews couldnt catch covid at this point
this is the titans game all over on offense
andrews is absolutely fucking pathetic tonight
andrews are you putting strichnine in my margarita becuase you are literally killing me right now
this team looks so unprepared for this game
receivers letting us down tonight lotta dropped balls
comeback was slim but that may have ended it fuck me
i hope it does i hope harbaugh lays into them
killed some clock and got 3sexy football there
fuckin oklahoma boys not getting it done today what the hell
bro andrews is sorry as shit i dont care fight me
our receivers are being super disappointing tonight drops galore hollywood not putting the effort in on that rocket from lamar just sloppy sloppy sloppy
classic ravens from behind we rolling with gus so we bring in mark ingram who doesnt follow his block behind boyle

couple with mark andrews who cant catch shit in primetime games and then a false start

kick the fg
mark andrews always has a couple of these games last year against seattle he couldnt catch anything he has to fix it that shouldve been a td
marlon humphrey pick 6 plz
this game is like the cursed monkey paw you want tucker to win the kicker battles well sure but your offense is not going to score a single touchdown today
mandrews catches that its a different game jeez boys
why dont we give some targets to snead or duverney those are some more sure hands
i hope coaches fucking rip into andrews he needs to hear it he wants to be up there with the ertzes and kelces but hes a fucking drop machine in big games his drop turned into a pick against tennessee and his drop just now robbed us of a touchdown he needs to get his shit together otherwise hes eric ebronjordan reed tier
its almost like they have an extra receiver every play
queen is having a rough game
has to be the worst game ive seen from peters as a raven also have to disagree with winks consistent blitzing here just rush 4 guys were getting the same amount of pressure was rushing 5 or 6
lets go gtfoh mahomes you ketchupdrinking fuck
marlo embracing his inner ray lewis there screaming at them to get off the field
they was dumb was shit trynna drag they nuts on us
i beleeeeeee
get off the field keep that same energy lets fucking go
this feels like a classic ravens mnf game i love it
our playmakers need to help lamar man
run d looks great and the secondary looks awful i got downvoted for this but we really shouldve tried to make it work with earl being a hardass isnt always a good thing and chuck clark is a mediocre player
we dont need mark andrews in this game lol thats where we disagree
feed the gus bus
whaaaaaaat rungame works
oof thought lamar had the angle
98 tonight 73 last week seriously dude averages 53 yards a carry his career and hes not a number 1 back
we need a td here
i just hate that when were down it takes us about 2 quarters to pick it up
glad we traded hayden hurst to find out gus edwards is legit
can someone explain why the clock didnt stop there lamar ran out of boundaries
if we had just stuck to the run earlier we wouldnt be in this mess
guys my heart is pounding so hard right now it feels like the flacco days right now
love ingram but he been looking way worse this season outside of that texans run
touchdown right here
then a stop
another touchdown
jt game winning field goal

no weapon formed against us shall prosper
this drive needs to end in 7 or 8 i swear
forget andrews jump on the boyle train
thank you nick best te on our team
that was a terrifying pass
damn risky pass i wont complain tho
wait it was boyle who stunted on them hoes
at least one te can catch
where are the bandwagon fans now

never count us out
hate watching this on a delayed steam i cant stop checking comments lol
now just stop mahomes and get another one we can do it boys
juice man getting a int watch
i joined this sub last year and holy shit fuck the people on this sub that have no confidence when things go bad
thats how you execute a drive against the chiefs
time for the defense to earn its paycheck
i hope for lamars sake we make a comeback

im not even mad that we losingbut other than that last drive we look like shit on both defense and offense gotta clean it up

long season though
its 430 am where i am stil here lets get the w
need a defensive score

lets goooo
imagine if we played good in the first half
i love lamar but mahomes is in another league
have we gotten a single sack this game
3rd and long feels like this defenses kryptonite
lol judon is a complete waste just falls down smh
judon is just not good
they called nick boyle for tripping on a pretty identical play earlier neither should be an actual penalty but i mean
wish me luck fellas next third and long we blitz and fail im jumping
matt judon is a fucking scrub
judon fuckin up
dawg this sucks
edwardshelaire is hard af to bring down so friggin frustrating
this blitzing on 3rd is the definition of insanity
judon is so bad man
are they ever going to call a hold on the chiefs ol
hey you guys want to do somethng crazy you want to call holding on the chiefs just once
i honestly believe that were going to have to make some coaching adjustments if we want to win a big game these schemes aint it were playing to their strengths
i will actually pay money for us to stop blitzing
attacked the rookie lb good playcall
clearly the problem is we left madden in allpro have we just restarting the game at the proper setting
a member of their o line has more touchdown catches than andrews
well at least we get to play washington football team next week
it just feels like every time we are in a game we need to win we become a completely different team i want it to stop
we need an elite pass rusher to beat this team if theyre really our obstacle trade what you have to but get it done
im seeing too many times the corners playing 12 yards off they dont have faith in the safeties
bring in clay matthews man
arent the refs supposed to announce that a player has reported eligible not saying it as an excuse just wondering

or does he not have to if he lined up at te i guess
top deolbs blow up plays we are scheming hard to get judon 1 on 1 and hes still not generating any decent pressure
judon is about to get paid alot of money by some poor team next year
someone call in and say youve been diagnosed with covid and was at a party with judon 3 days ago
i cant blame lamar when literally his whole receiving core cut their hands off before the game
horrible call lmfao
refs trying to get baltimore back in this one
thats a td lamar has missed hollywood twice
finally a flag in our favor
honestly id rather just see lamar run pistols
what the actual fuck were these last 2 plays
i fucking hate our o line
when we blitz were fucked

when they blitz were fucked
oline suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuucks
hes running for his life every play
so orlando not even kicking out to try to block the right side
thats not totally on the o line so much dropback gives angles to the rushers shouldve held in the pocket
jackson under pressure every time he drops back
line did nothing those past two plays
we showed some fight in the 2nd half at least still a horribly embarrassing showing
i wish we had a pass rush
center rg and sam rush

make a statement demote tyre phillips start fluker at rg cut or trade judon and make another blockbuster trade

we have to stop this hemorrhaging its not been exploited by three playoff teams and the browns 49ers titans chiefs browns
thank god we play washington sunday lmao
start duv over boykin he stinks
i get that we probably werent going to win but lamar made some really bad decisions in the last few plays of the drive iced it
this is the hardest opponent we have all season s and we were down one score in the 4th im glad this happened now and not when we face kc in january
o line has been playing like horse shit all night jackson hasnt played well but he was able to scramble away from pressure for the most part until that last drive believe it or not it could have been a lot worse
kelce wide fucking open
now what we need to do something because this team isnt good enough to beat kc i feel like we need to give up a pick for o line help and sign ab or something bc this isnt it
listen i like the idea of a punch to the mouth early for this team but the line problems and the lack of rush arent going to get better we need to address that
this is on the third down defense and the entire offense pretty much
i want to believe so badly that we can take this game as a lesson and improve but so much of this game was a failure can we get through the playoffs
cant make a 3rd down stop getting picked apart on these rb flats over and over
buddy of mine just texted me and said if you had to give a game ball to someone on the team tonight who would it be

shit boyle duvernay i dont even know what a sad performance
my probably reductive thought on why we lost this game their oline played much better than ours
our pass protection needs help for real hurting without yanda
how many snaps did duvernay have on offense i feel like he would be good to get involved and we havent done much with him through 3 games
lining up in shotgun then dropping back 5 more yards just invites the des straight to your face lamar has got to step up in the pocket and look for someone open
sorry but jackson cant even be slightly compared to mahomes like not even 1
ab time
may be an unpopular opinion but i am going to be happy with our boys win or lose at this point that first half was abysmal and they showed heart to get back in this thing against the defending champs
best kicker lmao fucking buttlicker
disgusting display of ravens d
fuck trump lmao
i respect the hell out of the chiefs

but this is such a blowjob fest by the announcers with the chiefs
its the titans game all over again the receivers forgot how to use their hands and catch the damn ball
hard to say but this defeated look of offense in a way starts from lamar you wont ever see mahomes look like this against texans last year chiefs were getting fucked but mahomes dragged his offense and annihilated the texans
i know this sounds fucking stupid but a gutcheck loss early in the season isnt always bad now we can forget the stupid fucking hype and realize there are teams above us and we have to improve
whatever rather have this happen game 3 than game 9 or 10 this ultimately should make us a better team no matter the outcome of this game
stop throwing to andrews he cant catch tonight
mark andrews couldnt catch covid tonight if it was thrown to him
eric fisher with better hands than most of our receivers
this guy is muted lmao i can take the criticism but the disappointed dad tone is fucking annoying get off the tv
can we admit at this point the ravens haves big game issues
team needs a lot of work oline and dline are garbage but all you mofos turning on lamar yall some fucking scrubs only week 3
lamar looked awful tonight i love the dudebut fuck tonight was bad
wait a 23 year old quarterback cant beat a former league mvp and the reigning nfl champions might as well abandon the season and tank for a new quarterback guys relax its not like we were gonna shut them out at best we win in a shootout our boy still has won like 80 of his games and clearly andy reid is a play calling genius we lost two in a row last year and yes to the same chiefs and we rolled 12 games in a row beating just as good teams we got this if we lost to the dolphins or the jets thats one thing but we got carved by the super bowl winning future hall of famerpatrick mahomes i aint even worried
looking at this thread id think the score was 280 chiefs
gtfo with this trump garbage
just boldface lies
fuck trump
guys really chill the fuck out yall
i mean refs literally didnt call the chiefs offense on a single thing the whole game
you aint tuck gtfo
playing zone against the chiefs sounds like a recipe for disaster
well maybe a good embarrassment on national tv will be good for them
love the blatant hold on brandon williams
lamar looks flat as fuck
literally the titans game right now

same issues and they didnt learn shit
why the hell did i just look at the game thread in rnfl
we gotta belee boys give me punch turnovers humphrey give me tackles peters give me game boy runs jackson i belee
damn yall act like there isnt a second half chill out
right now it appears were the hoes upon whom stunt has occurred
thats how you kick a medium range fg in case anyone who plays for the chiefs was wondering
the blitz isnt working bc theyre getting held bottom line
id rather brings suggs back than sign judon for anything over 9 a year thats how over this nigga i am
lamar jackson needs to get better at the passing game plain n simple

under 100 yards passing is inexcusable
21 headed to an easy win on paper next week i believe we play gimmies for the next 3 weeks but even if we blow all those teams out of the water its expected at this point but when the fuck are we going to win big games when down by double digits this is why people still dont believe we are legit super bowl contenders games like this define you
tbh i like being the underdog more
i hate this announcer
and now we get more shit talk while everyone sucks mahomes dick even more
why does lamar not call more audibles and look more in control of the line i see him call motions and adjust the rb but i feel like thats about it am i wrong
its about that tiiiiiiiiiime

caw caw mawfuckas
oh good baker mayfield
truzz
its 1 am where im from no way i was gonna miss this tonight is the night we beat the chiefs
tonight im a ravens fan yall got some of my favorite longhorns out there tonight run the tables
lets goooooooo
its 2am here in the netherlands but theres no way i would miss this game lfg
dope intro
dun dun da dun
alright bois whatever happens truss dont let a bad play or two get you down we got this
refs not throwing in shit
i love seeing duvernay in 3

hook em
parting that red and white sea
are you fucking serious run the ball they cannot stop it
fuck i know you want to take the points but its the chiefs we need every td we can get
wtf was that 3rd down play
damn we shouldve ran the ball to pick up the first down there
chargers fan here beat that ass boys
we shoulda ran it
time for d
butker watches tucker in awe
let the kicker battle begin 10 tucker
god why does roman do this we are averaging like 10 yards per carry so why throw it in the red zone
why did we stop running fuck egos run the ball
ok that was sloppy
thats not ideal
worst fucking ref in the league
wrong call there ref
how do you not call holding on that tyreek hill run what the actual fuck
pressure looking good real early hopefully we wear down this o line
that was an egregious hold that wasnt called
the one time we peters doesnt bite it goes for 32 lol
fuck not liking it fellas we are the exact opposite of them good run defense not as good as defense
queen just got picked
god i fucking hate mahomes so much
lmao butker
chiefs kicker sucks thats why we got automatuck
butger sucks
the one thing ive always hated about judon is he never holds his edge
that defensive effort was embarrassing
what happened to their greatest kicker in history
damn they set a pick on queen
happens guys were only down three not 4 like i said long game
best kicker in the league
well its good we established tucker as the superior kicker early on
im fine with the chiefs getting 1 its gonna happen but this shouldnt happen the whole game
jesus you guys it was one fucking drive calm down d will settle in
this ref is a fucking moron
x200b

flag for what
tripping you have to be kidding me this red can go fuck himself
ref ball at it again
this ref needs glasses
christ this league is so soft now
who paid these refs
anther bullshit call
aint this the same ref from last year calling bs calls
fuckin get him harbs
refs controlling the game again
tripping what a fucking joke
fuckin tell em harb
im already so fucking pissed off
harbs is going to get fined and he doesnt care
we gained yards wheres the flag
roman pooping himself just run the ball
well the fix is in
jesus fucking christ
no energy right now
cant stop kcs shitty 4 man rush ok
thanks ref
duverney is quick
thanks refs
one bad call and momentum has shifted just like that
that was a bullshit call im gonna trip someone using my whole body too
tripping is this fucking hockey
yeah like that 100lb girl wants anything to do with 2 whoppers
that call was fucking ridiculous the player wouldve tripped over his feet regardless of what boyle was doing
bs tripping call
letem play for kc

ticky tac calls for baltimore

bullshit
im just hating these dumb flags
chiefs seem to be on trajectory to become the next patriots the nfl loves em
the refs need about 116 more years of experience
tackling was a goddam joke somebody needs to lay some wood
our tackling is legitimately shocking right now not even attempting to wrap up and its killing us
missed tackle by elliott well done
im probably going to be downvoted into oblivion but does the defense look off to anyone else
where is queen in that why arent we running our mlbs for the center
what the fuck are these tackle attempts thats all they are right now attempts
fucking can we make a tackle today
i love how you make a play on defense then you have to look at the ref for a good 2 seconds to make sure it was a legal blocktackle before you can start enjoying the result of the play
dont get me wrong i want us to blow them out but im okay with proving to all of you that we can come from behind
another flag

holy shit refs this is getting ridiculous
defense just looks incredibly bad
why the fuck is he wide open if you didnt rush anyone
welp were finally going to see what our receivers have
defense looking like they need some milk
if the chiefs look this good against us then honestly rip the rest of the nfl because i dont know who else have the quality of defensive players that we have
at least campbell came to play
played them twice before and its the same story every time
im still salty about that tripping call
im a 120something pound female and i think i understand tackling better than this team does
wtf is our defense
stop playing zone d its clearly not working
sigh how do you even defend that wtf
im not even mad thats incredible play calling
un fucking real
jesus theyre giving up a first down every play
are you fucking serious
not much you can do about that play call
lmao going to be hard to get a lead when our defense cant stop shit
we need to respond now or this game could get out of hand real quick
andy reid is completely outclassing wink my fucking god
gotta give it to andy reiddude is masterful with his playcalling
andy is calling a masterful game cant hate on our defense props to the chiefs
well were about to find out what lamar learned this offseason will this be our first comeback
defense looking gassed and outmatched like they did against the titans in the playoffs why doesnt this defense show up against dominant offenses
iron sharpens iron texans exposed some flaws in this d but maybe this eye opener will whip them into shape
reid making wink look like a clown right now
you know i was ganna go easy on this 6 pack but now fuck it
can we please score and can the refs call a fair game
roman is calling this game like hes scared wink like hes an idiot
please get your shit together ravens
i think people are forgetting who we are playing right now this isnt the browns
while yes the chiefs are making amazing play calls our defense really needs to be stepping up thats not even being toxic or negative its straight up facts
do you have the truss
damn we needed that
oh shit
ddduuuuuuuuuuuvvvvvvvvv
everyone get in here
holy crap duvernay is fast god damn
bet these refs are pissed at whoevers turn it was to throw a bullshit flag on us
we can all agree butker is not the best but this just means our defense is back out there
thats uhwelldamn thats a response
i am no longer sad
k defense step up on short rest
everybody was blocking their asses off they arent quitting lets go man
holy shit jacoby jones flashbacks i love it
cant wait for duvernay to be featured in our offense hes for real
huge play by the rook absolutely huge
the sad part is our defense needed a break
ravens defense gotta be like but fuck
we have a spark boys
justin kicker
now defenseplease
duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu1eleventy1
heres justin kicker outerm justin tucker the kicker

thats right
sooo clutch duvernayyyy
justin kicker the tucker
duvernay is fast that is all
if there are any nats fans here this is what fp always talks about you gotta pick each other up this may be exactly what we needed
defense still has to be gassed they barely sat hoping they can bring it
ravens need to stop going for the ball and wrap up and tackle seeing that a lot
make duvernay wr2 plz
please guard kelce
uh ohhhhhhh defense getting their swagger back
m o m e n t u m
jacksons time to step up
come on offense lets fucking get it
nice return proche
special teams handled theres defense did theres offense its time to do ya job
if proche could have hit the jets after the change of direction might have been gone too
alright i think we finally woke up
here we go offense need a td here
special teams playing well so far
please for the love of god greg roman dont be cute
boys i saw it i saw the gleam in lamars eyes its coming
you gotta catch that man
roman wtf are you doing run the fucking ball
can we please run the ball
and just like that theyve abandoned the run already

maddening
whats with the 3 yard pass on a 3rd and 6 is flacco our qb again
run the damn ball
nobody can catch today mandrews normally catches that
fucking absurd a 2 yard drag route on god damn 3rd and 6
a 3yrd cross on 3rd and 6
ice cold offense
wow hate how roman is calling this game he tends to get away from the run in these big games even when were down by small margins
idk what riddick is talking about that ball to andrews has to be caught
why no run ball
dude get dobbins some touches most exciting player besides lamar and gets no love
need to run the ball we have to slow the game down
why does our offense fail to show up during these huge games
play calling is trash
wheres the block in the back
terrible play calling
inagine having track speed and getting tackled by cox
we were getting 46 yards consistently that first drive with the run game and weve run what twice since then
what a day for our top receivers to forget their hands at home
roman is a fucking clown
play calling is sus
god damn we fucking needed that andrews catch
did our receivers grease their gloves pre game jesus fuck
here we go again down 3 run abandoned and chiefs d suddenly looks competent bc of our predictability
3 straight passes against a team that cant stop the run why does roman always piss his pants against kc
such a shame we have zero running backs on this team
leave it to the ravens to have a clear cut advantage over a team and refuse to exploit it run the fucking ball
what i do not get is why arent we running the ball we always play pass heavy vs the chiefs for some reason and i dont get it it makes it so much easier for their defense
i still think we got this but we need better playcalling right now just atrocious
gus the bus is right there mark ingram is right there jk freaking dobbins is right there
how is kelce always fucking open
this is exactly what the playcalling looked like last week in the first half too constant lamar dropbacks and the rbs getting no carries not surprising the offense isnt looking great
always changing the damn offense in big games
honestly wouldnt be that worried about the defense shitting the bed if we would fucking run the ball and keep them off of the field
calais the only one out here trying
judon aint worth shit cant get a sack drop him into coverage he just gives up a first
what a terrible game from judon just shooting us in the foot
i mean theyre holding on every fucking play lol
how was that not a hold
wow ghost offside call and missed holding on back to back plays great ref ball game
pretty clear holding right in the middle there

thats not even on judon wtf
literally their whole oline was holding such dogshit refs
half their fucking line was holding wtf
theyre toying with us right now
offense needs to get started or this will get ugly fast
how the fuck was that offsides still
well if we can stay far enough out of it maybe lamar will give us some of those fancy trash time fantasy points

for real though im not sure if its the play calling or what but offense looks way out of sync
nothing you can do about that last pass but i dont understand why for most of that drive we werent disguising at all it was clearly working


now run the fucking ball
ffs im getting flashbacks to flacco throwing it to boyle in the flat
love these throws behind the line of scrimmage to our slowest guy
ravens look horrible
what are these third downs
jesus fucking christ
amazing play on 37 jesus fuck this offense is full of choke artists
were so lucky this is only a 10 point game good lord
fucking romans play calling im so sick of this shit
man this offense is looking stale
4116 calling it we are nothing this is a national embarrassment
please ravens stop them
repeat of the titans game
why does this always happen against the chiefs i am tired of this stress
our offense shits the bed under pressure
ill defend lamar as long as i live but wowww he is playing like dog shit tonight i think he loses his focus a little in these games
jacksons accuracy has been awful reminds me of the titans game where he regressed to 2018 lamar
lamar and receivers playing real bad right now but lets just keep passing the ball cause lol
lj8 forcing going to cost us
7 pass yards 7
they look like fucking scrubs out there
this game shows how important pass rush is and shows us that judon just aint it
cant wait for our late rally only to fall short at the end
i hate the games like this where when lamar is on target andrews drops it and the next play lamar misses by a foot or whatever and we just cant do anything
7 passing yards
they are gonna run the ball and the clock down score and then score again after halftime lol thats the way this is feeling right now
all that passing and only 7 yards to show for it
the coaches are just coaching a bad game you find yourself staring down the barrel you need to keep the chiefs offense off the field and make it a closer game you know the chiefs start the next half with the ball so what do you do you call a short drive and take away half the field from lamar on third by forcing him to roll out

the coaches did not come prepared today
goddamn this is hard to watch
this is disgusting
we have a bunch of chokers nobody on this team is stepping up no one
coaching is terrible roman and wink having their worse game
lol now were in prevent defense down by 10 is wink tied up in a closet somewhere who is running this defense
seriously fuck the gif war when we meet in january no gif war fuck kc dont get why we are so buddy buddy with them
it could be worse we could be falcons fans
yeah for real hows our meme game gonna be stronger than our defense
atleast i can head to bed early its a long season getting exploited can hopefully help us sure up the rest of the year good night all
roman just falls asleep during big games always uninspired play calling
cant tell whats worse the way were playing or the fake crowd noise its so terrible it sounds like a japanese game show
at least im not that guy that bet a thousand bucks on the ravens today
bro im straight up not having a good time
i wonder what its like to actually use your brand new running back and play him where tf is dobbins
we really need a turnover
wheres the heart of the cards when you need it
ravens have 65 rushing yards on 8 carries
thank god for our special teams td were getting blown the fuck out
3rd and 14 say less give them the td fucking christ this is absolute horseshit
didnt the chargers take these fucks into ot the fuck man
dont talk to me about this defense until they beat teams when it matters they look like shit tonight
god damn elliot got fucking cooked
why the fuck is marlon rushing
lol did we even prepare for this game
kc just skullfucks us every time
earl is somewhere enjoying this
i will gladly eat crow if we make a comeback but get ready for a rout my friends
why is our best corner blitzing
go fucking do something lamar youre choking again
outplayed outcoached simple as that
1st team all pro corner but blitz him every 3rd and long
maybe this asskicking is just what this team needs
i love the people bitching about fairweather fans theyre shitting on our chests and fucking our girlfriend right in front of us we should be pissed lol

this team has a sad trend of choking big games and tonights just another l on the pile
i dont ever wanna see lamar compared to mahomes again until he can win big games

huge ravens fan and lamar fan but this is inexcusable
now thats ball game
aite imma head out
gonna be 3410 before the half now 4110 a couple minutes into the 3rd
fucking done with these shitty ass coordinators
should have taken a timeout after lamars run and get a new play call
why wouldnt you call a timeout why
well thats game before halftime
and im out sleep well boys and girls
why not call time out when they clearly werent ready for the play
someone slit my fuckin throat please take me out of this misery
are we ever gonna use our 3 fucking timeouts or just shove them up our asses
we just lost like 15 yards cuz we cant fucking tackle mahomes
wow cant believe this fucking pathetic
we suck
soon as yall are down a score or two seems like panic mode kicks big time
so no more gif wars right because theyre all just embarrassing to look at now
we won the gif war for this shit
i guess the chiefs are our krypotnite
blame of the game everyone except for duvernay
hope we trade for someone we need a fucking jolt going forward
biggest weakness of this team is offensive and defensive line those are the foundations of great teams just not happening
judon done man and im sure a couple people just got on the warm seat after this game i cant believe i have to drink this one off for the rest of the season
i have to log off reddit and not watch the halftime show its actually damaging to my mental health at this point time to grab the bourbon and pray a little haha
just an all out failure all around offense defense and coaching is just embarrassing chiefs is just a mental thing and that is worrisome
see how theyre airing it out thats how you run a passing offense roman
holding them to a fg feels like winning the super bowl at this point
where is the run lamar becomes an elite passer when the defense bites on play action

if we dont run the play action is meaningless
we have been good at half time adjustments but just like the titans game we arent catching balls we need to catch and we have abandoned the run way too early one of the great things about running is we could have taken control of the pace of the game again and let the offense at least catch up to the game a bit
tucker is putting fear in this mans heart
at least butker has proved he sucks
we win the kicker battle
best kicker my ass at least we get that itty bitty w
well at least we settled the tuckerbutker argument tonight fuck yeah ravens
at least we have tucker i guess
player of the game goes to the wind
loooool kc is this your king

yea were trash tn but holy shit butker is awful lol
im getting irrationally angry over this game i literally cant recall a time i was ever this angry over a football game



hey at least that asshole missed
buttkicker is the only thing keeping me sane this game
were in no position to make fun but butker sucks
if butker would not suddenly suck we would be down 20

and they get the ball
2710 halftime atrocious
lol at least butker sucks
lol mahomes owning us again
putting the but in butker
at least i dont have to hear the butker is the best kicker shit now only thing that has somewhat made me happy this game
look at the bright side from tonightall that bullshit about butker being the greatest is over
i am not looking forward to the trolls this week
the plays that worked for us last year just havent looked the same behind this line

havent been able to find anything beyond 5 yards past los
we cant play from behind its reallly showing
why is it in these games like the titans and this one the receivers just drop the ball over and over and over when normally they are sure handed
im gonna hope we can make this competitive but i am also aware that i am a huge clown lol
whats that 5 or 6 drops
i know this sounds obvious but if you give up a 40 yard td on 3rd and 14 theres something wrong
mandrews struggling this is just bad second half here we come

if this is how the offense plays against the middle of the pack chiefs d im scared of when we play the squeelers
its good to have a game like this in september the amount they will learn and improve from this is astronomical
hi there could our receivers stop dropping the cunting football please
this is like a fucking monty python sketch im expecting brave brave sir robin to line up with his coconut wielding squire behind him

probably would produce more than fucking andrews and hollywood so far
that last play was literally a practice rep against air and we couldnt complete it

comical
we need a real mean mf in the locker room to set the tone for this next half
my head starts to hurt whenever the ravens are losing like this lol
why do we always get out coached in big games
ok google show me how to perform the heinrich maneuver

edit even my fingers are choking lol
good bring this team down to earth normally it happens in the playoff game slow down and play your game we need to learn how to come back from down
harbaugh better be yelling at everyone to get their shit together
the only time that we can even get pressure is when mahomes decides to hold on to the ball a little longer so he can go deep the pass rush has been abysmal miscommunication in the secondary is also annoying
i thought boomer retired
i want to have faith
peters going to get a pick on opening drive truss
time for the ravens to collectively shut these announcers fucking mouths
hopefully is a big reset after the half
matt judon is trash tonight he couldnt put a rush on my fucking grandma
another bullshit call
please say we get a break
ravens ball
big truss
good fucking night
holy shit finally
positivity is back on the menu boys comeback is on pending this offensive drive
please offense im begging you
now fucking score a td
fuck it im back in
the defense finally made a play this god damn offense needs a sustained drive
thank fucking god
gotta go for it if it gets to 4th down
this is fucking embarrassing fuck this theres needs to be a full fucking reckoning in this locker room
lmao just when i think im out they drag me back in
o line needs to step up now defense did their jobs lets go put up 7 on the board
absolutely have to get a touchdown and it does not have to be quick run it down their throats
what is this pussy shit offense
please run the bal
fucking run the balllll
so thats why we dont run screens pain
no more passes for less than 4 yards down the field
what the fuck is that why are you throwing to the guy in traffic 3 yards behind the line
god dammit roman how do you craft one of the best rushing offenses ever and you dont run the damn ball
mark gus edwards ingram
the difference in creativity in offensive plays is really apparent we have a lot of speed so we should have creative plays but we dont
oline in shambles right now
mental midgets
what are we fucking doing good lord
is everyone fucking hungover
i never thought id be so happy to see a first down
a first down
we got a first down
i was about to be furious if brown went back and got tackled there
ab no ill see myself out lol
damn lamar would have had a td there
whoa running the ball works
our line is looking rough people in lamars face instantly
damn roman just realized we have running backs
thank you roman run the fucking ball
oh wow what is this play called where you hand the ball to someone
its almost like this team is its best when we run the ball or something
can we just never give the ball to mahomes
huh whatta mean running works


what do you know the run games works fuck you greg roman
perfect fucking game for andrews to forget how to catch a ball
why does andrews not catch in big game
thats on andrews not even a bad throw
literally any pass lamar throws drop
what the fuck andrews
every important game andrews becomes fucking butterfingers
when andrews is off he is off
what the fuck is going on with andrews
mahomes doesnt have to worry about receivers and tight ends letting him down
andrews couldnt catch corona
at least tucker is consistent
fucking a
goat kicker
so on that drive we had andrews drop a dime dobbins become a scared pussy and spin short of a first down and brown doesnt know how to fucking count fantastic
well that was a lot of effort to spot kansas city 4 more points
thats the third drop on andrews wow
whenever andrews drops a pass hes fucked for the rest of the game just like in the 49ers game last year or seahawks
remember when mark andrews could catch
im sad drunk guys i dont like being sad drunk
mvp tucker
juiceman we need you right now
ive never seen so many wide open receivers than the chiefs receivers when they play us
if andrews asks for kelce money just buy him a plane ticket to miami
and defense back to leaving guys wide open
they literally let watkins have 5 yards of space there
were playing prevent defense down 14
thats what we are built for what were they thinking lol
huge
lfggg
inb4 we dont run the ball lol
thats probally all the stops were getting on mahomes this game we need the offense and special teams to do the most
lets fuckin go were not going down without a fuckin fight
hollywood and andrews coming up small tonight so far lets see if they can not be bums this drive
im feeling hopeful that usually means mahomes is about to pull a crazy play out of his ass
we need a td lets go boys
good for boykin cant even imagine whos covering him get him involved
bus
the bus always shows up
great run but can we play faster we need all the time we can get
bro we need at least 5 more offensive possessions we need to be uptempo right now defense should be ok dont worry about that need fast tds
not that hard to run the fking ball
these announcers are getting a lot of names wrong
whyd the clock run did he not run out of bounds
how did the clock run out if lamar run out of bounds
oh look roman finally got back to running after he had abandoned it dont forget
how fucking hard is it to run the fucking ball instead of forcing lamar into an offensive scheme he isnt comfortable with especially when our main receivers cant catch shit
pound em into the ground
i miss marshall
don life is such a good song
show mark how its done nick
we got a game fuckers
touchdown now we need a stop
regardless 48 passing yards is acceptable
get another stop d show everyone youre the best d out there
it is a game for now
this why boyle got that star on madden
we have a ball game boys come on defence get that turnover
lets get boyle more snaps he got hands
when im not watching the game good tings happen
best boyle cousin

i love you
one stop please
life death and boyle
if andrews wants to get paid big he has to stop disappearing in big games
why the fuck would they go for 2
good job ravens catch you guys at the end of the game best of luck
boyle for te1
boyle has something to say
one more stop please defense has been resting for like 15 minutes now time to step up
lets get this stop d i belee
andrews wasnt even on the field for that play did harbaugh find his doghouse out back
fourth quarter only down a touch lets go d
mp juice man comin
that andrews touchdown would be so fucking good right now maaaan
good fucking things happen when you mix in running the god damn ball

pound the fucking rock lets go
please d please dont blitz you wont get there in time and mahomes will torch insert db here for 6
te bro also watching the game
why would you go for 2 there instead of just making it a 7 point game makes no sense to me
removed
now andrews prove me wrong and redeem yourself bby we couldve been tied right now
now that its the 2nd half its nice to finally see ravens play calling a wasted first half
imagine if we didnt abandon the run game the whole first half after going down by 1 possession
no way the watts really have a subway in their yard i call bs
that was great its a game again defense needs to keel up the pressure a juiceman pick would be really nice right now
this script is all too familiar kc builds a big lead lamar leads us back with the run game mahomes responds and we fall short at the end we need a stop this drive
lets get the stop and tie this motherfucker
please judon play like your contract depends on it
if everyone thinks we are having our worst game and we are only down by 7 ill take that any day lol
mp marlon get us a pick here we need it
mp juiceman please jump a route
i dont care about fantasy at this point get a stop
the way this guy pronounces cehs name is killing me
lmao you know tucker got pissed off when butker was called the best kicker not even giving them a chance at a kick return
oh my god i saw that coming a mile away

how is he uncovered
for fucks sake levy its helaire not eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelaire
wide open receivers
can someone fucking sack this dude
mahomes is fucking special man
matt judon really has 0 pass rushing moves doesnt he
i wish we still had osemele
jesus fucking christ

our blitzes are so ineffective
why do we shit the fucking bed every third down
stop blitzing you idiot
sighreally makes me miss the ray lewis and ed reed era those were the raven days
same thing every game against the chiefs can never get a 3rd down stop
guys lets just keep blitzing that will surely work
the play calling on both sides has been fucking awful
5 yards every fucking down
its tough for us as fans because everything we are doing they have an answer for

other teams cant do this so it makes us feel uncomfortable

we stayed really healthy last season so you didnt have the sort of new players in spots this is queens 3rd game there are going to be mistakes
at what point does offensive holding become so obvious that they have to flag it anyone know
prematurely gonna place blame of the game square on the shoulders of matthew judon and mark andrews
judon owes the texans ots a big check
guys trust me it could be worse you could always be a falcons fan fml
welp im just happy we at least showed some life this game whatever i trust edc to make some moves and fill the holes
looked like some holding on that play
judon plays like an interior lineman somehow

just cannot be bothered with holding the edge like he should
judon constantly on the ground this game
the defense cant stop a nosebleed and kc is holding on every single play and they are just ignoring it
were soooo out coached
theyre just fucking with us now
time to pad the passing game stats amirite
we havent changed anything on defense all game obviously blitzing and having everyone 12 yards off coverage isnt working
who we signing off the street to fix the pass rush any disgruntled bad system star rushers out there to trade for sigh
honestly if we keep it within 7 i wouldnt be too angry upset that we basically shit ourselves in the first half yes
its the same game every time we play them offense shows up late n mahomes does his thing o wakes up n we make a run but d cant hold mahomes down for long enough
something always happens to fucking embarrass us a double pass wr pass o line td run or pass jump pass no look passsomething fucking stupid always rips any hope away ugh we have a habit of being at the wrong end of a fucking highlight
on top of having an overpowered receiving core great offensive coaching and great qb to boot the defense also has to deal with the constant holding
imagine calling plays for judon and he just keeps rolling on the ground did we prepare for this game at all
remember the suggs dumervil pass rush in 2014 that was amazing havent had anything close to that since
gus please
chiefs probably let them back in to feel something
2 biggest takes from this game
1 we need an interior o line men
2 we need some sort of pass rush
cant say enough about how bad these announcers are terrible
honestly we deserved to lose this game roman fucked us over by not running the ball blitzing mahomes never worked and left their receivers wide open to tear the field up andrews drop of an easy catch is inexcusable and sealed the deal that and we cant tackle

horrendous catching is what cost us roman seems to be so set on proving were more than a running team and its costing us if it works it works put your damn ego aside and do what it takes to win
lamar jackson doubters are going to have a field day with this performance hes admittedly looked bad passing the ball and hell be the first to admit it
ugh brown beat him you have to make that play lamar
fucking brutal 2 sacks in a row
get rid of the ball dude wtf is that
lamar having a bad night
offensive line is actually pathetic on that play
someone tell lamar losing 10 yards is far worse than throwing the ball away and in some cases worse than throwing it into coverage
thats the game
mahomes always has magic

we always want magic
alright whos the top o line spec for the draft
imagine if we wouldve went for a touchdown on our first drive instead of going for it on fourth and 23 this game is over now
why did we not call a to and regroup after either of those sacks and instead wasted almost 2 minutes
we need to learn how to play from behind

this is atrocious
lamar looked pissed and not set on every one of those 4 snaps
put judon in at rg
its 4 am here im signing off well be back stronger
ok yall are definitely being too dramatic big surprise here i also was earlier tho so i cant say too much the chiefs literally have the best offense pretty much ever they came with a much better game plan as well just be sure to laugh at all the steelers fans who think their record means theyre better than us surprise their record doesnt mean shit right now fuck you mahomes youre nice as shit but i still hate you and the walrus see you in the playoffs
dont know if i should be worried seeing lamar frustrated that last drive or happy to have a qb with some fire tough night all around especially the play calling

pound the ball against a bad running d eat the clock and keep the ball out of the second coming of christs hands weve been through this already

well bounce back next week
fuck week 3 though every year week 3 has been awful show up next week please for the love of god
not upset about us losing to the defending champs with no fans at home
out coached
ok so seriously major thing when we face teams that could actually beat us like the games that matter we entirely change our game plan and try all this cute shit early and then its too late to do what we are good at like roman is dead ass afraid of good teams exposing us so he tries a bunch of cute shit
brightside we play the nfc east while kc has to play no and tb
stay away from rnfl this week or dont open any ravens thread
i still think the team comes out of this stronger in the end im glad all of the weaknesses weve been murmuring about all came out in one game if you want to take some postives out of this game the mental weakness from the coaches and some of the players really showed in this game onto next week though
im going to be real surprised if ed isnt hands on with this week just like after the browns lost we need that kind of readjustment we are top two in the afc at this point and it aint one
heres what it is stop calling pass plays when we are down by less than a touchdown that is not out game for christ sakes gus edwards is better than mark ingram lamar needs to run more or else he is worse than flacco was i do not know why he isnt running like last year
plenty of ws coming for you guys this season see you in the playoffs
super bowl year we got blown out by the broncos in the regular season so just remember that playoffs are a diff beast
the narrative that the wake up call is needed is either 1 true but fucked how do you not get up for this after the titans disaster or 2 not true and the team just laid an egg and its an l for an ls sake
trailing the whole game and only throwing for 97 yards
ima be honest i want to us do nothing but run on the football team just to get our anger out
alright ravens fans disappointed yes but kvetching wont do us any good well wake up tomorrow and start fresh and start preparing for our game for next week bigtruss ravensflock
this team needed a wake up call lamar really needs to take this week to figure out a way on how he can get out of his own head when he is trailing we know this man can capitalize with a major lead but now its time to work on the long game good game ladies and gents lets not lose hope
these announcers suck ass good i miss gruden
yeah our ranking will fall so damn hard lmaooo
they need to stop coming out so damn easy and chill to start the intensity kicks in waaay too late for everyone i think we need to start thinking about bringing some different coordinators too cause it hardly seems like the team adjusts well enough during games to play better
lol fuck this thread im out buncha fairweather fans should be ashamed
were not playing well but this officiating is complete fucking garbage
dont worry chiefs start the half with the ball
if patrick mahomes can keep playing like this throughout his career brady will no longer be the goat
we got embarrassed by the browns week 4 last year and regrouped and won 12 straight were losing to the best team in football tonight we can get past this
its impossible to enjoy us throttling a shitty team when its in the back of your head that everytime you play a big team you crumble this must be how saints fans have felt
every talking head is picking usthat seems like bad juju
nice no call on jimmy getting held lol here we go
a 3rd down stop would be very nice right now
mahomes always begging for a call
i wish i didnt get so hyped for this game
does judon even give a shit
youre right he is justin kicker
refball
that was not an offside man just because he moves does not mean he is offsides
is holding not a penalty anymore did i miss something
holding smh
judon wasnt offsides refs are just blaming him cuz hes an easy scapegoat theyve been making absurd calls against us the whole night
roman should be ashamed of his offensive game plan so far
why does this team freeze up and start making horrible calls when down why has gus edwards yet again been totally erased from the game because of a slight lead
serious question is lamar hurt weird play calling and hes terribly inaccurate
the playcalling has been fucking atrocious this game run the fucking ball why do we always do this against the chiefs try to play a different game than we are used to always fucking decide lets have lamar stop being the running god and have him shoot out with the fucking main gunslinger in the nfl
judon is the most worthless 17m pro bowler in football history
dont wanna hear another fucking word about super bowl aspirations until this team fucking shows that it can compete with a team in this league that isnt dog shit
the one time we get a home game a prime time home game against the chiefs its with no fans fuck this
somebody kicks three field goals in a row when only 1 actually counted and suddenly hes better than the most accurate kicker in nfl history lmfao
ive seen enough put flacco in
sadly we are extremely lucky its only a 17 point deficit
harbaugh doesnt know how to play lamar jackson when this team is trailing why did they stop playing their game when it was 63 this is horrible
we got absolutely embarrassed at home tonight no pressure whatsoever its surprising theyre not up by more tbh
we got killed so bad we had to bench our rookie linebacker god damn
dear god i do not want to play the steelers with this oline
mahomes looks dialed in lamar looks googly eyed blocking and secondary are underperforming big time earl thomas is a huge loss for this game all that said and we can still pull it together if we get pressure on kc and make some catches on offense
lamar is 04 when trailing by 10 at any point in a game

please stunt on that stat tonight lamar because you gotta be able to come back and win games this is definitely a tall order to complete against kc but at least make it closer and show us the offense can compete

i dont give a shit if we lose looking pretty certain at this point but for god sake show me something on offense make kc d sweat a little this looks mediocre af and not scaring anyone come play off time
holy shit everyone saying lamar is done just start rooting for this team yesterday
we went 121 after last seasons week 3 loss to kc we may have needed this
gg ravens yall got plenty more wins coming up just gotta work out the kinks see you in the playoffs
people have called mahomes vs lamar the new brady vs manning and its absolutely true lamar is peyton unfortunately amazing qb that cant win big games consistently and often gets embarrassed by the other
03 vs mahomes 02 in playoffs lamar needs to get over this regular season means nothing
can we stop making excuses today

why cant we put blame on lamar when he completely shits the bed like this

yes hes my favourite player and yes hes our future but he needs to be better because i dont know whether its psychological or what but he seems to completely regress when were playing the chiefs
were losing by 3 and everyone is acting like were the worst team in the league chill out were very in this game
fuck trump
well thats only the 5th hold and a very obvious block in the back whatever im not gonna bitch about the refs too hard they obviously want their golden boy to win tonight
lamar was just bad tonight guys it happens
im not even excited knowing we will beat the shit out of washington next game i want quality ws against legit teams like last season
lamar is running it

jk
okay im not usually like this but there was so much holding on that play
great drive killed by two cute plays
ill be happy when judons gone tbh not worth money he doesnt seem like hes even trying this year
i blame the white pants shame on who ever decide white was better than black or purple
but but but but they were telling me butker is the best kicker in the world to ever play
someone should let the defense know that the game started clearly they dont know
damn this sub is whiny
campbell the only adult out there
drop ball count 2
im old to remember earlier this week when i was telling myself yeah but we didnt have peters last year
lamar is totally out of it just gotta survive to halftime
lamar getting killed tomorrow not even all his fault but i can hear stephen a now 7 passing yards 7 lol
so 2710 at half and 3410 by 12 mins to go in the 3rd qtr fml
on the brightside no fans means no banshee screeching
dominate the weak teams but choke against real contenders
this game is fucking over wow we are terrible in big games now the flacco curse lamar is only good in low stakes regular season games
im usually not an alarmist but we are getting exposed
lamar deserves criticism for sure but ik all it took was another bad game for rnfl to go back
annnd this is why u dont drink the kool aid the media wants to drive a narrative of a rivalry between our two teams but the truth is they are the superbowl champs for a reason and mahomes is on another level comparison is the enemy of happiness
and now we are going to have those steeler fucks chriping when they barley beat 3 03 teams
i knew this was going be a tough game kc is a great time mahomes is amazing qb andy is a great coach

but come on we gotta play better we gotta complete more passes and move the ball down field
if the ref standing 2 fucking inches doesnt call it then why is the dumbass on the otherside calling it
lets see how creative the ravens are in racking up a 3 out this time

s hopefully
i retract my previous gus statement

i apologize to the bus
im going to have a stroke
id have anyone over judon literally anyone

edit fuck it i will play for free and i guarantee im better than judon my niece hits harder than judon
how is a guy lined up as lt eligible
this is what happens when you deter from your game plan early on nobody panicks and folds quicker than greg roman he shit himself when he got down a score in the playoffs and they go down seven in this game and he immediately goes pass heavy and there is zero talent in his receiver corps

miserable play calling and equally horrific execution all night long
lamar under pressure is not good at all
winning games against garbage teams isnt even fun knowing we wont ever win anything important with this sorry system
its week 3 kc look like the sb champs ravens looking like that team that lost to the titans last year have we learned anything i put this one on the coaches
this is basically the nfls version of the la clippers

house the teams that youre supposed to and struggle to even look competent against the top tier
lamar doesnt have 100 yards and we think our receivers are good enough against this team in january
we need a trade


yanda retiring gutted the ol
the chiefs just wanted this win more edwardshelaire just wont go down and we have looked slow everywhere
everything keys off the run time to bench ingram edwardsdobbins platoon wins lamar magic works in between runs
at least i expected a loss here

everyone played like shit tonight

but the playcalling was the worst and i think its time to move ingram down the depth chart hes just not that good compared to gus and dobbins

big boys
lets get this one tonight
are you watching wbal 11 or espn
big fukken truzz
im always so nervous on prime time because if you shit the bed everyone sees it
the llama so great sammy took his middle name

samuel lamar jackson
what was that pitch crazytown
that late toss had me gasping
good job ingram run it down their throats
chiefs run d is ass
duvernay took that hit and didnt flinch
it is the kicking battle we all predicted
i like kicking the fg didnt look good the last 2 plays
shoulda been 7 but its coo now we know the run works
2nd and 3 and we call 2 pass plays in a row wtf
it was a questionable 3rd down play call but we complained when harbaugh didnt take 3 last time the ravens and chiefs met so i love the outcome of the first drive

so its going to be one of those fucking nights two holds and a block in the back by kc on first play and then this
defense is ass
juice man what you doing bby
what a shit first defensive drive
thats two big obvious holds they havent called now fuck sake
so much for defense
big truss i aint worried
best in the league
alright our defense didnt want to play that drive so we need to turn this into a shootout
butker is the best kicker guys trust me very true and certifiably not false
butker not the goat
damn kicker lmaoooo
that was on judon
too fucking easy gotta be way better
judon is so worth 15 mill
best kicker in the league
we gotta get that one back
im so happy we didnt sign judon long term he looks so underwhelming
fuck outta here with that weak sauce
calais campbell forced that miss
i think this mahomes guy might be good
love this team except for these pass rushers they are just not able to pass rush with 4
did the monstars play a snap last drive like all three on the field at the same time
mahomes diced us up on that drive ngl i wasnt expecting that
weakest point on the defense is definitely the lack of an edge olb presence
really wish the nfl let us do that trade with the jags to get clowney
our kicker won offensive player of the week after 6 50 field goals in a game whats this guy done exactly
imagine we couldve had aldon smith for peanuts
someone kidnap this refs family
wtf was that
love to see refs swallow their whistle on kickoffs and punts more
lol this ref is pissing me off
great job ref
play the bullshit chant for these refs you espn cowards
refball baby this is so fun to watch wow
that was a bullshit call
eagles fan here yes im depressed but these refs are complete ass
refs definitely dont like kc or anything
refs gonna ruin this game
these calls are such bs who tf is this ref
flag flag flag
penalty is a drive killer man
2 killer penalties
jfc can we open up the offense
these refs are fucking yellow bellied pony soldiers goddamn cowards
take the fucking kid gloves off
these refs be tripping
chiefs getting them bradypats flags
harbs getting fined
i hate this fucking ref every fucking time
bs flag kills the drive before it even starts
that stupid ass penalty really just fucked us man come on
jackson wtf are you doing man
they need to settle in playing very nervous
this isnt going our way is it
inb4 flag on the punt
wheres mark andrews plz fantasy he aint run a route
this is painful
yea this is going to be a long night
well this is not exciting so far
why is that trophy floating in midair
when you gain 14 on the first play then get a bullshit call to go to first and 20 its a big difference thats 24 yards and first and 10
if they walk down and score again were fucked this team needs to show some mental strength against adversity
man this feels like its gonna be a long night
looks like were in for a stressful night its been sometime my ogs know whats up tho
big truss we still got this
slow start but if they can get a stop they can come back this was never gonna be easy
keep the faith truss
the bs penalty killed that drive but we gotta get into a rhythm and play our game and not get too fancy
still early in the game guys but im not a fan of the play calling so far
playcalling needs to improve
116 years of experience yeah of being blind
fuck tonights officials bro
experience my ass these guys are clowns
116 is the combined iq
elliot needs to use his arms
derek wolf getting pushed around badly
wrap the fuck up
i have this terrible feeling were not going to stop the chiefs unless they stop themselves with penalties
finally a call that wasnt against the ravens
garbage d
im prepared to be crucified but i think the offenses weakness is roman i love him for his ability to design a run game but jesus christ he cannot call a passing game without pa thats our weakness
this is fucking embarrassing
chuck and averett both deer in the headlights
thank you marlon someone on d makes a play finally
why does he keep calling him eelaire
so glad we never invest in the pass rush so we have to blitz constantly to create pressure
bowser is playing fucking tag not edge
the horrible tackling by our pass rushers makes our lack of pass rush 100x worse
these boys need a tackling clinic
every year we play the chiefs we get fooled by the designed screens over and over again its honestly ridiculous that its the same shit
all they are trying to do is strip the ball
kelce is gonna shred our secondary
calais fine ill do it myself campbell
man this defense sucks when theyre not forcing turnovers give up way too many plays and cant finish sacks

good discipline on 93 there nice
we are fiiiiiiine
cmon boys a lotta game left lets goooooo
i want lamar to activate that seattle supersaiyan mode sometime tonight
big 3rd down here
hmm

here are my thoughts we are respecting their receivers and giving a little too much space peters and humphrey our guys are good we need to get a little physical with them and get tighter coverage with that space mahomes can make those throws all day
defense gotta make a stop at some point they cant just let mahomes move up and down the field i like the batted balls at the line though one more of those and its an int
andy reid is a great coach playcaller this offense is tough to defend from a schematic standpoint
keeping them to a fg attempt will be big here
wheres lj fort i feel like i havent seen much of him
were trying to hide our pass rush struggles by blitzing more chiefs respond by throwing quick passes and screens we have no answer
guys chill out we r down by 3 with 3 quarters to play of course things are not going to go exactly to plan against the best team in football give them time
i dont think our defense is terrible but kc has enough weapons to get favorable matchups and they know where they are and they are getting it

we havent been able to do that on the other side of the ball so far
yeah that browns game last year
zero meaningful pressure
peters 2 fuck ups already
well one team came ready to play
not spending on clowney looking bad right now
lamar has only lost to the browns x1 and mahomes x2 as a starter in the regular season let that sink in lol
why cant we fucking pass rush
lmao of fucking course
once again no defensive discipline they will do this all damn game
embarrassing
ard can our creative play calling show up now lol
in b4 lamar cant do comebacks
lets see if we can complete a pass downfield defense will step up of the o gives us some energy
andy reid is a master
no one can cover kelce
its all good guys everyone knows the chiefs can only come from behind if were losing at half the chiefs will inevitably collapse
damn near perfect play calling by reid long night ahead for the d we gonna need to keep up a drive on offense to let the defense settle down and adjust or this is about to be a blow out by half time if the d doesnt get a break no 3 n out please
i need a cigarette and a strong drink shit
lamar going to march down the field and get 6 here i am looking forward to breaking his 04 after hes down 10 points
i hope we run the ball but knowing roman thats already out the window
dont give up we got this
this is the consequence of trying cute offensive plays against one of the most lethal teams in the league
everybody relax lots of game left
relaaaaaaaaaaax
duvernay is gone
lets fucking goooooo
thats what the llama ordered
holy shit thats exactly what we need
wooooo f u refs
what up
jacoby jones reincarnated
touchdownnnnnn ravens
ayeeeee duvernay
omg wait what
i fucking love you duvernay

mother fucking hook em

there we go
x200b

wow devin duvernay just ran for 93yards and a touchdown
duv shades of jacoby
lfg
hollyyy shhiitttttp
we still here
we needed that in the worse way
our defense couldnt even get a break lol
dude ran a 43 and yall wanna kick it short outta your fuckin melon
been a while since weve seen a kick off return
never sleep on us defense isnt doing us any favors but damn if our o isnt trying to win this game
fuck i got up to piss and missed it
okay very happy with this rookie
lets rock boys wooooooo
big play duvernay
duvernay lets gooooooooo
well so much for butkers fucking pooch kicks
fuuuck yeaaaaahhhh
big dick dev
thanks buttlicker
defense defend whats ours
and just like that its a 3 point game
he needs to be incorporated in the offense asap
justin kicker
will the defense get a stop surely they cant score every drive surely
jacoby jones 2012 vibes right there baltimores kick return game is back
i love justin kicker hes the goat tucker
justin kicker i like it
hit them with the duvernaenae
defense has to step it the fuck up now
tucker showing the young kid how to do a real kickoff
devin duvernay more like devin hester amirite
hopefully thats the spark we needed to get it going
energized the whole team
d is going to need one of those 10 minute drives by the offense
as a ravens fan that td was awesome as a lamar and mandrews owner its kinda bittersweet lol
calling that a no look pass is a bit disingenuous he looked with his eyes just didnt turn his head

still impressive though
finally a bad mahomes pass
big stop lets goooo
yes 3 and out baby
perfect 3 and out lets fuckin go
a stop
they are waking up
that smile on duvernays face when he realized he was going all the way
hopefully weve settled down
3 and out
heres our chance
thank god defense lets go
lets gooooooooooo
that was critical defense needs some more rest
kick return td gave us life
i thought proche was about to break that for a moment too
so much easier when the refs dont fuck you
awesome now run the motherfucking ball
jimmmmmmmmaaaaaayyyy
now we gotta run the ball
man our special teams is great
if proche and duv both get a return td that would be awesome
i went to take a piss and you guys scored somehow howd they do it
nice spin move there by proche
we need to keep it on the ground right here need a surgical drive by lamar like he did against the browns before half time
three and out
lets go boys lets get some damn points
run it down their throats
in ozzie we trust
love that decosta went out and drafted these two wrs with sticky hands and special team ability
in ozzie we trust

always
damn andrews felt the hits coming
catch the ball
what is this shit run the fucking ball
run the ball
lets pass on every play now cuz we are down by 3
run the ball please
run the fucking ball
nice lets just abandon the run game
that was a really good throw idk what the announcers are saying that was on him where no one else was getting it
why no throws beyond the sticks
can we run
where the hell are the runs
how do you not just bury the run right into these soft ass goons

pass pass pass are you fucking serious
lets stop with these underneathhospital passes please
lamar is doing what he can you cant drop that
run the ball wtf
so are we just not going to run at all the rest of the game tf is this playcall
we need to run the ball ffs
why are our receivers hardly running past the first down on 3rd down wtf
why they playing like theyre down 30 and not 3
offense is a little cold but im not worried bout shit
pass pass pass pass just like the playoff game
we are doing the same we did againts the titans we are slightly behind so we are completely abandoning what we do best on offense
these passing play calls have been absolutely terrible
why did the ravens stop running the ball
why are we only throwing now g ro we had 60 rushing yrds on the first drive
why are we being cute just run the fucking ball everytime we face a team were it will be a few challenge they do all this cute shit run the fucking ball
the game thus far is on no one except for greg roman
why dont just at least try the run game
receivers always shitting themselves in big games
alright so the terrible play on first down

a terrible drop on second down

a questionable play on third

i wish theyd run the ball more but at least we probably wont see any more drives ruined by that first down play that they used on three consecutive offensive snaps
feel like they are falling in the same trap as the titans play off gameabandoning the run way too early
run the goddamn ball
and this is how we lost to the titans
same shit with the titans game

passing all the time even when receivers are dropping them and just ignoring the run game
playoff roman
how is this shit not obvious to coaches like you gotta know were running well
how the fuck do you not put the gus bus in there and just fucking pound the ball jesus
why is lamar throwing into 34 defenders there others were open gotta stop trying for big plays all the time build drives
the best rushing team in football too scared to run

weve got 3 damn good backs work em and let lamar make plays off that respect
hey lets not throw underneathhospital passes all day for one we shouldnt throw this much for two our recievers arent built for this
hollywood and andrews need to step up too many drops
i just had a flashback to flacco throwing the checkdown on every 3rd
why are we playing so soft we have two allpro corners
why arent we running the ball
we ran it effectively on the first drive and then stopped cmon man
i dont know maybe cover kelce
keep playing 10 years off of every receiver guys

its working well
kelce just shrugs our dudes off
its not even like lamars throwing bad balls you fucks just aint catching em
wtf is wrong with our pass rush finish a play
for gods sake can the defense just show up so we can stop hearing about how mahomes invented football i love the guy but come onnnnnn
down by 3 but feels we losing by 30
i love my team and im not going anywhere but this is embarrassing
we couldnt sack a statue jesus fucking christ our pass rush is so revoltingly bad
wink is usually so aggressive but he has the dbs playing scared 10 yards off
calais and humphrey are the only defensive players out there today
this broadcast just jerking pat off instead of calling the game
nice fucking holds by their o line right there
classic judon penalty
excited to see what move edc is going to make at the deadline to give us an actual pass rush
goddammit judon this is why youre fucking gone next year
looked like he timed that one perfectly in my opinion
i really hope we dont pay judon he doesnt deserve whatever he wants
how else would judon get a sack lol

so much holding
wow this is getting ugly
that wasnt offsides that was timed
harbaugh getting outclassed also everytime i see a flag i know its against us smh
fuck this shit man this d looks flat out incompetant if they arent getting turnovers
i hope wink and greg roman get a stern talking to after this game
please run the ball and take a deep breath here offense
whole team looks unfocused
i would like to see a slow mo of the offsides call it looked ok to me
our best pass rush is our 300 pound run stuffers mp is gonna get hate bc the ends are ghosts
just setting up lamars comeback guys thats all
it kills me baker is wearing my bathrobe i love that bathrobe
man 75 was holding our dude by his facemask i wasnt sure if it was holding or a facemask but it looks like it was offsetting penalties
team has like 0 fight in them right now
can someone explain why we are throwing screens to nick boyle
this is flacco era checkdown offense holy shittttt
wtf are these passing play calls jesus christ roman
people rag on lamar for not being able to throw us back into a game but romans playcalling when were down is incredibly bad
this is giving me flashbacks to nam aka the playoffs last year
this team is playing scared i dont know what it is but they look legit scared
heres the issue noone can make a play
why are we going 5 wide every 3rd down
damn he broke his collar bone
ljarius sneeds shoulder is messed up

x200b

also he has a very funny name
love to see the o line just standing around looking confused with lamar scrambling with a live ball
great our defense is gassed af
just run the damn ball and let lamar throw from the pocket when we need it these roll outs are resulting in nothing but dump offs
our receivers running into each other fucking terrible offense
cancels my andrews jersey order just kidding im not but whats going on with his catching
what the fuck plays are these you got recievers running into each other lmao this is clown shit tonight
wow this game bout to be unwatchable real soon
what the hell are we doing out there
yeaaahhh this really showing how weak we are to whole damn league
were deadass the celtics of the nfl stacked team but can never get it done
garbage playcalling
the fuck is this play calling fucking roman
i might tap out for maybe 20 minutes we look absolutely pathetic
who would have guessed that a receiving corps of brown boykin and snead wouldnt be effective

apparently getting exposed in the playoff game wasnt proof enough for the brass
itd be cool if we could get a stop
rofl not a single man can tackle
feels like we are playing conservatively we arent doing what makes us good running the ball play action pass then jackson makes magic
what is this ridiculous fake crowd noise
this team needs to get a fucking grip

not a single person is playing ravens football
stil truzz
flat out getting out coached on both sides of the ball
these announcers are even more annoying than the game also the person in charge of crows noise please stop
if yall think this is the end of the season idk what to tell you see browns last year broncos regular season in 2012 etc we drop shit games with the best of them sometimes
i had a gut feeling all day man
our playstyle requires us to control the clock and keep the offense on the field as much as we can something we are failing to do tonight and now we have to do something we havent done effectively yet which is getting back in the game
this is not what i was looking for i dont even care if we win or lose this game i just wanted a good game well get there there is a lot of game ahead of usbut still ugh
judon is pretty useless
i wish we could face mahomes in november instead lol
this team does not deal with getting punched in the mouth well at all its why weve always thrived with the underdog mentality under harbaugh
thats ball game night all
ballgame
wow just fucking terrible
god dammit wtffff
elliot is ass we all knew this for years lmao
i dont understand the texans can play them well the chargersbut we just absolutely fold
welp game over our defense isnt even trying
breathe yall lol
embarrassing
theyre shitting on us
yikes
so what safety are we trading for
earl thomas may have been nice there
i still have hope but
when you rush a corner and a safety elliot cover deep not the sticks
how are you not prepared for monday night football
honey wheres my sleeping pills
god i hope we get blown out now im so tired of us coming out flat in big games we need a wake up call
3rd and 14 lets blitz the best cb
gonna need a miracle in the 2nd half
i dont wanna hear any of those retards in here calling anyone fairweather fans for saying that the team is playing like shit this is ridiculous
greg roman shitting the bed yet again in important games
ill admit we are missing earl thomas
im going to bed
we have more in common with the jets than we thought
greg roman is calling a piss poor game
thats a wrap
wink and company should be ashamed look confused


offense looks uninspired and lethargic
this is a snuff film
like i cant believe this tbh they might drop 60 on us
now theyre running the ball lol
goooooood night
the oline is so bad this year
hah i told my husband we couldnt hold onto the ball for 148 and theyd score again before half i can see the future
were about to lose 5010
theyll probs get another td outta this
will the real baltimore ravens please stand up
watching from the uk rather be asleep rn instead of watching this shit show
just completely outcoached and not ready to play on both sides of the ball did we even prepare for this game doesnt look like it
no one showed up to play today coaching has been horrendous turning that crap off
why tf cant we sack him ever holy shit
the 2nd half ravens will look better then the 1st half belee dat
bruh this ravens offense are killing their defense no time to rest
wtf happened to this team that we suddenly look scared in big games for two years in a row
i miss having a physical defense
our offensive line is shit this year
were completely naked

this is embarrassing im not looking forward to the slanders

you had 3 timeouts what the fuck are you doing
the pass rush is so bad even when sending everyone
stop fucking blitzing
lamar is playing bad but dont like this oline isnt dog shit defense cant generate pressure either
we just blitzed 8 and still didnt get to him and lucky he didnt catch that
what the hell is going on i can only hope that any fans that could have been there have started burning their couches by now
im so pissed
this is going to be a loooooong week ho boy
goodness gracious please stop blitzing
anybody watching the stanley cup
thank god
congratulations offense you got a few more yards all half then your 3rd round rookie got in one play
this the titans game 20 abandon the run got nervous just shit the bed
at least our kicker is still better
we look lost complete mismatch
at least we can clearly see tucker is the goat
can we just fucking blitz 3 contain spy on him i feel like that has to be better than this shit
well at least we can be confident that tucker butker 100000 times over
pass rush is a huge disappointment this year
disgusting first half from the offense good lord
also how bad must cleveland be lol
at least tucker is winning the battle of the kickers
kicker battle won
better show the fuck up in the 2nd half
should walk around the locker room at half slapping each player in the face to wake up
the only thing were winning today is the fact we have a better kicker
better to have a meltdown game sooner than later the second half will be very telling of what kind of team we are i dont even need a win at this point but i need to see heart
why tf we calling timeout with 5 seconds left
yea lets drop every fucking ball in big games
lol nobody can catch what a fucking abysmal first half
wow that drop says it all shitty pass shitty play call shitty catch attempt drop
even if we go into the half come out the gate and score the defense still has to pull its head out of its ass and do their job
embarrassed for the team rn
cant even catch a garbage time 8 yard completion one of those nights damn
i hate everything
bahaha is andrews for real
stop dropping fucking passes i swear to god
keep dropping the passes andrews
harbaugh better go into that locker room and let them have it knock some sense into them
what a pathetic way to end the half

this team is sad right now
our pass rush is just complete ass and no secondary is good enough to keep mahomes contained without a pass rush offensively we cant get anything going missed blocks missed throws and running backs cant find any room
welp the ravens have all the pressure on their shoulders they could possibly have in this game


time to see what were made of
i believe in lamar becoming mvp in his first year starting is a million times harder than coming back tonight
if you told me our only td by halftime is on special teams id have bet my house you were wrong
horrible clock management bad defensive show not to be a fair weather fan but i might go play ps4 lol
this is how the team loses

its the same way every time
yeahhh guys im not feeling so great right now
oh fuck off schefter
offense is way too simple and outside marlon the defense just isnt good enough
so is this what it feels like to be a browns fan
i made ed reed laugh so thats a plus
this is so incredibly saddening im a fan that lives in tx and hardly ever get to catch a game live unless prime time or an off chance 12325 game spent all last week getting hype just to watch this bullshit
ill never understand how we use the same blueprint against good teams and see it go horribly wrong then do it again and then be shocked we got our asses handed to us
honestly roman and lamar need to be the only ones sitting at the podium if they lose this they need to fucking answer to why they shit the bed
and the fuvking chiefs will get the ball ugh
even though im pissed im glad this wake up call came early in the season

the one thing this generation of ravens is that they drink the kool aid and come to games sleepwalking and thinking it will come handed to them
assuming we lose lord knows itll light a spark on this team
alright boys lets come out in the second half and make he chiefs look like the falcons
and kansas city can do anything they want oh man i felt that and it does not feel good
no pass rush

no secondary

no offense
patrick queen is looking like a real rookie today
super bowl contenders dont ever put up 3 offensive points in a half let alone give up 27 this is atrocious trash half
how is that a horse collar
fuck this ref and his car battery
we are getting double penetrated fucked in the ass by both the refs and the chiefs
that is an awfu call my god
the theme of the game we cant do shit but when we do the refs bail them out
that call is number 1 bullshit
wow theyre just playing with us
finally
hell yes
ravens ball lets fucking go
finally thats what we needed
finally something good happened lol
thank fuck we needed that turnover
come on lets get a little momentum going now
wow we needed that
make it a long drive
mother is that hope i see
now is the time to prove we can step up now is when we need to prove to ourselves we can turn games around
man had we put up a couple of 3s those last few drives this would be big lamar better come out with fire
can we atleast score im tired of seeing mahomes torch us atleast make it close im tired of losing to these guys
why do we abandon the run in big games when its working
ill take a 10 yard completion atp
come back to me zadarius
what is this play call
stop with the fucking screens they never work with this shit oline
what the fuck ronnie
i know there are other reasons why were behind but holy shithow are these penalties so one sided
defensive holding yet no call again
no one is on the right page tonight did they even practice its pissing me off
wth is with these screens
wtf is stanley doing this team is so lost
lets throw another screen fuck you
roman gtfo man you suck
when did we hire marty as our oc againtired of these pa check downs we need to establish the run before we can do that
i cannot believe after that 1st half the 1st offensive play they do is a screen lmao
3rd and 1 just run the fucking ball
i cant believe the ravens were so heavily favored
wtf
ravens best defense tn butkers right leg

seriously flock we gotta step tf up
are we sure the chiefs dont just straight up have an open line to all our offensive coms this defense isnt that good jesus christ
cant even snap the fucking ball
holy fuck
lamar looks very human tn
wtf is illegal snap as a penalty
wait theres more than 4 downs if you get past that little yellow line
catches for a 1st down then runs backwards
fucking brown needs to lay out for that catch
honest and serious question why is hollywood always moving backwards with the ball in his hands did he do it in college too
am i the only one that remebers you can dive for a catch or is that just mp juice man
its time to get fuck a hot pocket drunk
gusbus
need to see lamar become a leader and take this game into his own hands and make something happen
espn loves putting together shitty broadcast teams
did that guy just punch gus
this game has shades of flacco era games

except jackson has the running speed to make up for his receiverstight ends forgetting how to play football
our edwards is good too
keep this run game going thats how we claw back run it down their throats
run the bussssss
where was this game
where was this play call the first half
notice how when the chiefs play well is constant praise while when we do well its crickets
wtf is andrews doing
catch the fucking ball andrews jesus
oh andrews decided to fucking have one of those games where he cant catch the fucking ball go home
andrews is completely shitting the bed tonight
mark andrews has to catch those
andrews cant fucking catch covid today
andrews cant catch anything tonight
love you mark but come on thats a little tough but still
mark andrews has been terrible omg
andrews are you fucking out of your mind
suddenly mark cant catch
andrews that was a gimmie
3 drops come on man

are we cursed tonight
come on mark holy shit
i lime how mark makes amazing bull shit no way catches then drops shit like thaf
now you kick it
uh huh thats ravens football right there
and the penalty kills us again
the one thing that never changes
so we have two fieldgoals and a special teams td fucking embarrassment
how many carries ingram has so far 6
yo andrews
great momentum gone at this point go for it on 4th we cant rely on this defence should have gone for it
whats the drop count for tonight
its like the universe is against us

nothing is going right for us
this is weak give up football exactly the opposite of raven football terrible
2 possession game baby







for the next 141 til patty drops another dime
catch the fucking ball you god damn bums
ive never seen the recievers play this badly holy fuck
i love andrews to death but i really dont want to see him get a target the rest of the game he has maybe 34 drops ride dobbins and ingram
its like they literally didnt learn from the titans game
this shouldve been a td we were driving here normally andrews catches balls like that easy and then the false start
andrews has had games like this before sometimes he just cant catch anything its feeling like those frustrating days where when a top receiver went down or had a bad day they didnt have anyone else to go to then it was checkdown city
holy fuck this is frustrating
maybe the narrative should be andrews cant win big games jesus christ dude
any time andrews starts dropping elementary passes i could catch you know its gonna be a looooooong day
lets get mark andrews to a sports psychologist somethings wrong
remember when we were marching on them the first drive of the game and then we threw 2 screens to kill our momentum pepperidge farms remembers this game is on roman
we need a defensive td lets get this going somehow
throwback to last year when andrews dropped like 5 passes against the seahawks smh
defense has to do something here
well it was nice thinking wed win the super bowl past two weeks team cant keep melting down anytime they face elite teams man
on a positive note jt has been excellent as usual
okay we need 5 more turnovers for 5 more drives to stall out in fg range
im sorry guys but andrews is not a top 3 te like everyone here claims the best tes in the league dont drop nearly as many passes as he does
chiefs kingdom is such a stupid name just call it the chiefdom
defense is restedhoping they got it down now
yes lets keep blitzing hasnt worked this far
nice 4th down stop
god i love big baby
dont do this dont give me hope
finally some decent d
whoaaaa finally that is a ravens d line play
good stop lets go offense
the chiefs are handing us a score so please offense like nike just do it
coolcoolcoolcool nows the damn time
there it is
we need 12 yard lets give the ball to our worst skill position player

love it
lets fuckin go
lets fucking go
our defense is begging our offense to do something man
lets fucking ggggooooooooooooooooooo
offense needs to send a message defense stepped up you have to answer now
run d showed up
just as good as a to cmon o
now run the fucking ball
get a damn td lets get this fucking game
incoherent drunk noises
need a touchdown before this quarter ends
lets make this a game ravens
hollywood brown 50 yard bomb incoming
if they run a qb sneak there they convert thank fuck for reid being unwilling to risk it after mahomes freak injury on a sneak last year
how bout some urgency
gus new rb1 lol
its almost like we shouldve ran the ball with gus more
the bus is rolling
gus needs to be our 1 and not ingram plain and simple
gus edwards is sexy
gus buss
run da damn pill
pound da rock
comeback time
feed the bus
lets go boys get your mta passes cause the bus is comin
go ravens our afc brothers are coming back
why was the clock running
i love ingram but gusdobbins should be getting more touches

absolutely gus should be the main runner between the line
one thing i will say whenever were doing badly ive never thought lets give the ball to gus less
if we had jaleel scott here wed be winning
so things start working out when we run again huh who would have thought
i hope we retain gus and let ingram walk i love ingram but this needs to be a dobbinsedwards backfield
this is my first mnf watch of the season this announcing team is terrible its as if they didnt watch any of yesterdays games to talk about them just so generic
big boyle no lil boyle
omg i thought it was picked
nick boyle is the best te on this team
lets fucking gooooo
boyyyyyllllleeeeee
nice catch todd heap
boyle andrews
nick fucking boyle catches that
this is why the clocks didnt stop

whenever a runner goes out of bounds on a play from scrimmage the game clock is started when an official spots the ball at the inbounds spot and the referee gives the signal to start the game clock except that the clock will start on the snap

after a change of possession

after the twominute warning of the first half

inside the last five minutes of the second half
lets fucking gooooooooooo nick boyle
friendship ended with mark andrews nick boyle new best frand
man boyle with better hands than andrews tonight
nicccckkkkkkkk thank god
boyleing them alive
offense is back
boyle andrews jk
one score game
its on now boys its fucking on
lets fuckin go man we arent dead yet
still a long way to go but never say never baby
theres our incredibly reliable passcatching tight end checks notes nick boyle
ayo im shitting right now but did i hear our supposed blocking tight end catch a td
lets goooooooooo

toooooouchdownnnnn raaaaaavennnssss motherfuckers
boyle fucking loyal bois
boyle mandrews
andrews thats how you fucking catch the ball
this is definitely a cursed game if boyle is catching a td
lets fucking go
how come weve never started gus
defense please get the stop here
i swear my eyes dont believe were only down 7
i said before the half we were gonna make the chiefs look like the falcons still holding hope
another dime from lamar someone just decided to catch a god damn ball for once this game
lmao half of yall just hopped back online welcome back
sorry andrews boyle is my new best friend
i watched my college team erase a 15 point deficit in 3 minutes on saturday this game is far from over lets get a defensive stop and tie this
i like boyle more than andrews now i dont care if im overreacting
run it run it run it again then run it once more run it
im already out of nails im so nervous
we got a game it wouldnt be the ravens if we aint get over hyped then nervous then furious then hopeful
we need humphrey to punch the ball out of the chiefs hands so we can score another
gus the bus literally is the kc kryptonite go watch the last two matchups feed the bus
please either a campbell deflection int humphrey karate chop forced fumble or a marcus peters sixth sense int
having our crowd here would be so great once we get momentum we get so loud and our d play so much better especially for night games
we need a pick
can that ball guy be put on the roster dude hasnt dropped a single kick
judon if theres ever a time to show up its now
mahomes int coming i can feel it
patrick queen benched lol
judon is fucking useless
why are we still blitzing lmfaooooo
chiefs just have so many damn weapons
love how helaire keeps getting stuffed
i dont hate the blitzing i hate the loose coverage
blitz or not it doesnt fucking matter because the secondary is also shitting the bed
that was an idiotic blitz
stop saying eelair my ears are bleeding
damn even when the defense gets to mahomes he still makes the completion just unreal and otherworldly
this dude is going to throw for 400 yards
our pass rush is so shit bruh
good coverage by averett thats a new one
this is like playing on all madden jfc
is mahomes using invisalign instead of a mouth guard
mahomes is legit aint nothing you can do with this guy gotta keep him off the field
dont blitz
ffs
judon tripped on his way to the blitz lmfao
lol even though the blitz never gets near him lets keep doing it
too easy man
we need to hold this to a fg even that pushes us into a bad spot but we cant let them get a td
thats game
defense has been abused on these blitzes and we are still calling them
why arent we creative with hollywood the way they are with hill my god hes mind fucking us more than anything smh
how did judon even get the franchise tag bye bye
defense is awful fucking chargers held these dudes to 20 points in regulation
need to hold to a fg
where the fuck is our press coverage
just handing them first downs cant wait to hear everyone suck off mahomes all week
yeah queen is out of the game
is it me or did they just bench patrick queen
still cant believe there was no contain on that run either someone fucked up or wink is on drugs
please hold them to a fg
im honestly convinced edc is going to trade for a pass rusher soon we dont get over the hump without one
why is someone wide open every single play
jesus christ what a fucking hold
the defense got a huge reality check tonight guys better work their fucking asses off in practice
stop blitzing its not working holy shit what are we doing
well what pass rushers are available lmao fucking kill me
stop fucking blitzing jesus christ
i think the only thing i can say good about judon is that he does get off the jump really fast sadly hes trash in that he cant get to the qb
sigh im so over the chiefs the ravens beat themselves
mahomes mom confirmed karen
yeah now we are just getting clowned on
honestly at that point just let watkins score wouldve saved time
anyone whos into college football know of some decent pass rushers
not that it matters because judon has been invisible all year but mitchell schwartz is arguably the best right tackle in football guys incredible
its just getting simple how they are beating us they bait the blitz then get something sneaky
man it must suck to be malik harrison right now although it also sucks to be all of us
holds no we need a fucking pass rusher or two
how many pointspotential points are off the board due to dropped passes
just when you think the afc is open bc the patriots let go of brady we get these guys
andy got bored of dialing up tds to receivers it seems and i guess giving the fb that td wasnt quite enough to scratch the itch of shitfuckerry
someone tell me again why judon was tagged
there wasnt a single positive in this entire game outside of duvs return td
we didnt address pass rush well enough this offseason
so we lose the meme war right this is embarrassing
no weapon forged against us shall prosper
another drop oh my fucking god
suggestion just fucking try onside kicking every time after we score regardless of the field position we cannot stop them may as well have them score quicker
can duvernay be the primary target he catches balls right i heard he did that alot
seems like runs by lamar and gus are literally the only thing working today
even the refs are like here damn
ooof lamar has hollywood on a td there
thats another miss td by lamar

i love him but hes no russ or mahomes when it comes to accuracy on semi deep passes his passing is no where near elite still
lamar running for his life while mahomes just jogs 10 yards untouched
another awful throw on what wouldve been a td
thqts 2 dropped ints qnd thats 2 missed tds
did the feed just skip that entire play
this announcer that isnt louis riddick is insufferably smug

i literally get annoyed listening to him say anything
those field goals instead of touchdown on first drive and andrews drop really hurts right now

really does
where the fuck was this the first half
this o line is trash
since when can andrews catch
pass protection and pass rush we need it damnit
our lines are fucking pants fucking traffic cones
ballgame
not a great game for ronnie stanley
big yikes
our oline is like an automatic door
welp there it is
fuck welp gg boys onto next week
well boys thats a gg catch ya next time
im gonna go drink some soap brb
that was the dumbest play ive ever seen from jackson mindnumbingly bad
whelp cant watch sports talk for another week
how do you come to a game this unprepared to throw against the blitz if youre lamar he seems completely disengaged
you know how they say the texans beat everyone theyre supposed to but nothing else well we beat everyone were supposed to and then some except for the fucking chiefs they make up almost all of our regular season losses under lamar
damn this is embarrassing this game was hyped for being a close game and we end up being obliterated flash back to titan game
watch out for the mahomes trolls
on to the next one boys im turning it off tonight
good night friends i hope tomorrow is better for us all
big takeaways that hopefully our coaches can use the rest of the season to get under control blitz all the time isnt the answer have our dbs check at the line dont go a at from your bread and butter for a whole half of football
dont think you can win mvp when you throw for sub 100 yards on a big stage
at least we won the gif battle
pull a madden and trade for nelson from the colts for a bag of peanuts and a 7th rounder
career high 197 yards against the blitz god damn
how is it not evident to roman that were a run first offense we had the most rushing yards by a team in history last year how is he that much of a bozo
before the season everyone talking about how mich we about to pay stanley i havent seen a good game from him yet this year
vegas loving the under hitting
the only booming hit i saw was hump smashing hardman these fuckers are not smacking anyone to set the tone
never lose hope

our coaches will adjust
well at least we got the loss out of the way
we could trade judon and get something out of him
well that was one of the shittiest performances ive seen by lamar to date hopefully that a fluke
if we lose to washington we will really be trying to mirror 2019
well i dunno what to say
i just needed the ravens defense to not let mahomes get 40 points unreal
thank god we have president drumpf

joe biden will eat our children
we dont need clowney
hey guys i have faith in our boys but this game is looking yikes
things i learned and that were reinforced watching the first half

1 andy reid is an amazing playcaller

2 our pass rush is dogshit

3 lamar and co cant come back from behind

4 greg roman is a fucking hack who abandons the run way to goddamn early

5 tucker is and will always be the goat

6 andrews will keep dropping passes if they are trailing

7 snead and co are not the move for wr

its been a shit night gonna stop calling it now before i lose any and all hope for a playoff win after this shit show of a game if we come backwhat am i saying we aint coming back especially when chiefs have the ball to start the half
guys look on the bright side weve been dominated in the titans game and are getting blown out here in all our other games weve barely even trailed

if our team is ever going to do anything in the playoffs theyre going to have to learn to play from behind or learn to adapt to different play styles this is one game but its an entire half where we will have to throw a shit ton good because we have almost zero experience doing that

remember when our team was actually clutch in the playoffs we played from behind ahead and in all types of fucked scenarios before we threw a shit ton in the playoffs but we also had experience winning in new england with like 9 flacco passes too

winning this game is obviously better but this loss should hurt us relatively less than a normal loss would if we actually learn something from it

didnt he run out of bounds why did the lock run

jackson cant emotionally handle these games yet he needs to get this shit settled down
these announcers are the biggest dick eaters
well this confirms that we choke in big games honestly feels like a coaching issue
fairweather fans out
that was as embarrassing quarter as ive seen in a while tbh
fuck donald trump get this shit commercial off my tv
ref ball predicted that
they marched down the field with no resistance defense is in for a long night playing like this
lol butker v tucker advantage tucker
best kicker in football
lol butker
thats on judon you cant let him scramble
listen im annoyed as anyone but everyone knows when you play the chiefs you play the refs overcome it you can do it ravens
this is bull shit we gotta tighten up
gonna be a long night
dude our defense is getting exposed
lmfaooooo god damn reid and bienemy are so good
i fucking hate andy reid so much
you guys have to relax its early

but yes we do need to respond quickly before this gets out of hand
take ur politics and shove it up ur ass that shit has no place in this thread
that looked very close to perfectly timed


thats not offside
refs are really missing some blatant holds here
i honestly think the chiefs are just this good
how was williams not held there like wtf his pads and arms are in the air
that was definitely a clean sack play lmao signed this chiefs fan
theres still plenty of game left and were only down ten were still in it
everyone get in here they called a penalty on the chiefs
im so suck of matt judon hes absolutely useless
andrews with another drop im missing hurst right now
jesus christ lamar couldnt even hit one guy running a wide open fucking slant right there andrews drops one for no reason

this team deserves all criticism soft as a baby in big games
every time i wear my lamar jackson shirt we get blown out

last time i wore it on game day was the titans game
id rather have our flaws all pointed out early in the season and have time to fix it rather than have it be too late in a critical game
getting embarrassed so early will make us better for the rest of the season


yeah just like how getting embarrassed in the playoffs made us better for this season
theres some type of mental barrier we need to
overcome the chiefs aint even like that
can the announcers fit any more kc cock in their throats
offense finally gets rolling and and it ends with one of our many brain dead olineman getting a flag costing us yards gotta move it
my name is mark andrews and i drop the ball
get off the field get off the field

damn right
in the name of the fucking god why did we stop the running game
can someone smarter than me explain why the clock didnt stop there when lamar went ob
im just getting my hopes up for them to be fucked again arent i
this team is still going 124 but i feel absolute shit about this team headed into the playoffs
yknow what i want cactus jack to send a bullet in my fuckin brain
eric fisher catches better than mark andrews
harbs and staff cant outcoach reid and gang
considering this isnt even a true home game im not mad instead of laying down we fought back and the game is not even over yet we can still win this
look the chiefs are the team to beat and we clearly arent there we have at least 13 games to get there
its all good fellow flock members yeah we got handled but well regroup and bounce back
outcoached
bad coaching bad defense and bad offense just terrible all around
fuck the gif wars always thought they were corny
aight can we get riggedrefs trending on twitter these calls are such bs
maybe lamar can throw passes for more than 3 yards now
this commercial is atrocious
we needed a game like this so that all you bandwagoners can jump ship
look i know this game has been a nightmare and i dont want to overreact but this l really makes the rest of the season pointless they could go 151 and im just not convinced they can get past the mental hurdle of here we go again this sucks
fuck andrews you dont got the swagger of kelce dont ever try to one hand snag shit again tryna make lamar look bad
we all gotta give it to kc that theyre an amazing team currently that got even stronger in this yearss draft
feel really bad for washington this team is gonna be playing angry next werk
yall are a bunch of babies well get through this loss and figure what we need to do for the playoffs
guarantee lamar comes alive with 5 minutes to go in the 4th quarter and everyone here talks about how he actually did good
i see why earl was fighting them
i think were frauds guys
fuck all yall negative ass fucks
im more excited to see us play defense honestly
such a fucking soft call
think its stupid that a 5yard penalty is an auto first
well they just walked all over us hope the offense is ready to play from behind
romo where ya at
take that tony romo
defense is not putting any pressure on pat mahomes we need dlineman
bow to the goat butker
everyone already bitching per usual
thats the worst call ive seen this week and i watched like 7 games lol
this team is way off their game tonight ravens gonna get crushed of this doesnt settle down
lmao yall are so dumb we obviously stopped running because we were averaging a paltry 10 yards per carry obviously the god king greg roman knows best
embarrassing

the world laughs
defense just looks so confused we are really missing young
lol andy reid is clowning in the ravens
outcoached simple as that
this trump commercial is vom
i mean damn this offense is looking flacco esque
this game is 100 on greg roman what a clown he is in these games
that wasnt offsides at all fuck these refs dude
i saw a blatant hold there
so are the refs going to call one fucking holding call on the chiefs or what its fucking bullshit theyre holding our d on the line
lamar looking like a rookie yikes this could get uglier then its already been
some of yall bandwagon fans are serious bitches
why does lamar play like ass against this team their defense is trash
this is hard to watch my god pick it up boys
hey maybe well be in bal again next year with fans oh who am i kidding well be back in kc
weve been undressed and assfucked on mnf without lube
we cant stop them its gonna be 41 after they get the ball at half
ive never been so embarrassed by a ravens game before
no pass rush on defense no pass protection on offense
8 seconds left throw it underneath
butker is no
i believe in football terms this is called an asswhooping
if theres a time to get reminded how hard you have to grind for everything in the nfl its now win the half play hard and get some good tape we will play kc twice this year if we are as good as we think we are its important to push and remain intense shit happens good teams dont just win forever until the superbowl
start throwing the ball and the drive stalls dead

wild
worst performance ive seen in recent memory

mark is looking pathetic
fairweather fans this way


bird up welcome to the worst show on television
feed him
why would chuck clark lineup that far away from his assignment
judon is a fucking waste
i swear i cant wait for judon to walk never does jack shit in games that matter
blame of the game defense
theyre really not playing that bad right now we just shot ourselves in the foot with the early mishaps it is what it is but it feels bad man
mahomes and reid just trolling this mindless ravens defense
andy reid knows exactly what he is doing egregiously targeting our rookie lbs their inexperience is glaring it got our first round pick benched but here we sit with 16m in cap unwilling to spend and admit we have problems
unfortunately lamar is on the shortest leash in the league the very rare bad game is always used as ammo
such a limp dick performance
edc watching this and thinking about which superstar he wants to acquire for a 5th rounder
those last 3 plays were all on lamar dropping back 15 yards sets your tackles up for failure didnt step up the pocket
lamar might finish this game without even having 100 passing yards
im so disappointed in this team what a joke of a performance
judon was not offside refball leads to a td love it
why do people get upset when we call out the team for playing like shit
somewhere earl thomas is laughing
one bad game doesnt mean anything for our season that doesnt change that this has been miserable
why do we never see the coaching staff getting in anyones ass during the games we see harbaugh get pissed at refs but no one ever lays into the players for the shitty performances

im tired of the eh it was just a bad game we will learn from it and get better excuse no go fucking get mad and act upset and show it

tough loss but damn yall sound too negative
97 yards
the chiefs play style is our worst matchup in the league whether thats an issue of personnel or coaching is not something i feel like thinking about right now
we played like utter dogshit on both sides of the ball

on the bright side we played like utter dogshit on both sides of the ball because there is no bright side
hot take our defense is gonna look more impressive than our offense tonight
got the bubble guts
why does espn continually search for crystal def my stream is constantly buffering cancer
makes me happy to see they all predict a ravens win
these car analogies are weird
hot takes

peters gets a pick six

dobbins goes for 100

lamar throws 4 tds

ravens win by 13
ngl nervous but hoping for a good game
just because i find this weird we get a lot of video of mahomes talking but almost none of lamar whats up with that
why am i giddy with butterflys its like a first date
what are you doing to me lamar
screw faker mayfield
i dont care how much we win by i hope we just pull out the w and make a statement that this team is for real and this team is the team to beat we will shut a lot of mouths if we can pull this out
3824 ravens lets get it
man im so nervous havent been this nervous since the titans game just week 3 and the season feels like its going to end tonight if we lose yes im reaching lets just get this dub man
any fans of other teams here that actually want us to win lol
lets fucking go
lets goooooooo
we may not be the best team in the league but i guarantee we have the best locker room in the league
lets fucking gooooooooooioooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
i just hope the flock doesnt freak out here whatever happens tonight remember were playing the super bowl champs
here we go
lets gooooo im turning off reddit for this game see ya folks on the other side
why didnt they go with a paul rudd vs edgar allen poe graphic
lets fucking goooooooo
alright everyone just remember im talking to the sub its going to be a long game 60 minutes it wont stop your but clenching but at least try to keep it in the back of your mind
dope
what a play
love the option there
big boiiii
lamar jackson is elite
no little bois
a 5 minute running drive to the 7 this is why the titans gsme pissed me off we could have run back into it
roman can we throw past the first down
cmon
stupid play
go for it
oh hey get 50 yrds rushing but decide to pass now wtf
nah we should have gone for it
surprised we didnt go for it
they literally executed play to perfection it just wasnt the play there
letting tucker assert his dominance
greg roman getting way too god damn cute again
hate that playcall bro
why the fuck didnt we run
bad play call he was running up the los no chance we were getting a first
you go to the end zone there if youre throwing
if ever there was a time to go for it i guess were conservative tonight
what is that route you need 3 yards throw it 3 yards downfield not to the line of scrimmage argh
lets get this thing back dont even let them passed the 50
big truss

woo woo
run the ball on 3rd and 3 you either get the 1st or its 4th and short fgs arent going to do it today
gaining crazy yards running it every play but we pass on 2nd and 3 and 3rd and 3 i dont fucking get it you cant get down there and not score a td against the chiefs
that was a good drive but we were running all over them i cant help but think if we just run something inside or off tackle we get those 3 yards
bullshit call
not calling any holding on the chiefs it seems
i saw holding refs
fuck me campbell looks like one mountain of a fucking frankensteini love him
just a hair too late i dont care mp you stay on it like that
were they yelling go titans a couple plays ago
fucking embarrassing
best kicker lol
its gonna be a real long ass game if thats what the d has got in it
hahahaha
crafty pick by edwards helaire there fuckin bastard lol its alright well fix it
well looks like the o gotta step it up
lmaoooooooooo
butker sucks butt
elliot already getting picked on man
ravens win by 1 calling it now
best kicker in the nfl my ass
trade judon for a real pass rusher please
we been struggling to get pressure all year seriously should have made a stronger push for clowney
come on lamar lets get a score this drive
whos the goat kicker
duvernay is so electric
wtf refs
we good that tyreek run was inches away from being blown up and they can stop our run

it really cant be stressed enough how much of a difference empty stadiums make there is basically zero home field advantage this season
couldve just said nothing lol
im here to watch the players not yall refs
we couldnt justify the flag to stop a good ravens play this time so i guess well have to give them a fair chance refs
fucking flags
um fucking what
god dn it and we cant even bullshit chant this cunt
these fucking refs theyre gonna be the difference in the game
thats a block
fuck that
andy paying these refs well i see
how is that not taunting
holy shit what a weak fucking tripping call
ah so its a flag fest jesus
already shenanigans against posterboy mahomes and the cheifs
bs ref call 1
i forgot we were watching hockey whos going to the box this time for that tripping
what a dumb penalty call especially given how consequential the result is
this was painful to watch
we look so bad
how many fumbles so far
sad raven noises
fuck man that flag fucked everything
defense needs to put their big boy pants on
michaelscottnopedontlikethatgif
someone was breaking wide open to the left post but our line died
we need to figure this shit out cant afford to fall behind big against this team
yikes
still made about that tripping oh well just gotta get a stop
lets just delete bubble screen out of the playbook
biggest difference in this game will be chiefs getting pressure with 4 and we havent been able to for years
new game plan run every play
there were 9 tripping calls in the nfl last season we have the 1st currently
man i do believe this could be a good game but i swear these refs will ruin that experience
nbc crew is kind of boring this doesnt feel like primetime

edit espn
we got playoff roman gonna be bad if they stick with this
john parry can fuck off
ive never seen the a team get away with holds as much as the chiefs
wrap tf up deshon
ive been excited for this all week
refs are bitching up a storm
ran like 60 yrds first drive then stop near the goal stop in the 2nd drive and now defense just wants to get pushed by a rookie back why cant we just beat the breaks off them cleanly
holy shit our d is weak tn
oof
one day well beat mahomes
we cant keep blitzing against mahomes
jesus just fucking stop them this is embarrassing
humphreyyy what a hit
we are down 3 points stop freaking out
marlon aint playing
learn to fucking tackle
they cant stop them
they are just bitch slapping us lol
no way you could predict it but tavon young being so injury prone is really really hurting us
this team isnt reading at all no eye discipline against a team known for all this misdirection shit
theyre outsmarting our defense
defense is trying to strip the football everytime
another first down wonderful theyre giving us the business
bowser has been great judon has been a bum who would have guessed
bowser and humphrey the only ones fucking trying apparently
finish the fucking tackle
this is so god damn frustrating
why can none of our rushers finish like that was basically tackling
well were about to see if we can come back 10 points
is are defense just giving up come on
what is this shit we have zero defense step the fuck up guys
can we fucking tackle
can anyone tackle a qb on this team how many whiffed sacks do we have this season so far
i swear our olbs are allergic to sacks
chiefs playcalling is elite
imagine how good our team would be if we had any talent on the edge
another penalty
jfc
thank you
damn wish he picked that off
i fucking hate defensive sets that leave wrs uncovered on the line especially a track team like the chiefs for fuck sake why just why
embarrassing
if they get this first down
cmon d gotta get off the field here
lol how can we be this unprepared to play tonight
thank god they decided to run the ball
good news is at this moment the score is super close so we can respond lets do it
cmon d
nobody is completing their tackles tonight
the score is 63 i know we dont look so hot but its literally just a 3 point game its not going to be cakewalks every week relax
wins 14 straight regular season games have won a super bowl in the last decade and consistent playoff team down three to the defending champs and favorites to repeat
wow this is bullshit how dare we be down
bowser sucks
pass rush is a fucking joke
peters getting torched
why are people calling for the 2019 assistant coach of the year who led an historic offense in a 142 team to be fired because we only scored 3 in the 1st quarter against the super bowl champions
rushing 6 and no one on mahomes
this is where you need a real pass rusher simply untouched
this is just sad
run d has been solid enough
of course they would
defense might get 1 stop tonight
yikes 5head play call
the rookie is getting picked on tonight
they look like us usually

hey when we come at the king we best not miss
pass rush has got to get better
shit i think we just got stunted on
absolutely need a td here
literally have to run just to give the defense a break roman needs to calm his tits
this is in lamars hands now
theyre gonna pull that out during a week 3 regular season game okay
who would have thought it would take just one made up penalty would suck the life out of the team
really starting to get worried that the chiefs gonna be the reincarnation of the manning colts for us that one team that always wrecks us no matter what we do
it aint enough
mahomes wont even have to wash his jersey after this game
thank god scott beat sheila dixon in the primary hopefully we finally get a mayor who doesnt go to jail lol
the bogus tripping penalty was huge that being said reids play calling has been on point
jacoby jones is playing tonight oh shit
wait is that legal

justin kicker seals it
some of you loser already gave up

truzz the fucking coach and the team
our defense is gonna die
poor defense they barely had a rest lmao
lessgo kyler murrays cousin
plz dont suck defense
ill drink to that
lmaooooo we made out like bandits this draft
may as well change his name to justin kicker he is the official icon of kicking
fuck yeah buds still need to be on alert with pass rush
duvernay is a playmaker

get him the ball more
wake tf up defense so we can beat these clowns
feeling better
if we can keep them to three or less on this posession i will feel even better
the abysmal period of returning after jacoby is over pls be the answer for real duv
j u s t i n kicker k i c k e r
tucker blasted that kickoff i love that man
the defense needs to get some swagger
looks like were finally snapping out of it and starting to focus thank god for duvernay for saving this game
first step to redemption on d boys
big mac in the house
cmon defense one more stop
they need to keep devin duvernay and marquis brown on the field at the same time snead is slow mb boykins and duvernay will add so much explosivesness on the field at the same time opening the run game and deep ball
i want derek wolfe to make a play
3rd down stop right here bros
good stop d
we got jacoby on the last leg of his career

duv is a fucking rookie
finally a third down stop
thank you
yea d
we just got a madden bailout and it looks like we just got our energy back
big stop
i was waiting for a bs flag tbh lmao
get some d here we go
much better disguise this drive
defense did its job offense needs to come back with some fire now
no flags
stopped whew
thank you
we got a stop
god please no fake punt
anyone remember last week everyone saying we need to get rid of duvernay on returns what are they saying now
not bad proche
i smell a marlon scoop incoming
wow a stop
here we go
need a nice long drive man
great stop
ah man you guys have wolfe forgot about that that dude gave great interviews i hated losing him but the biggest thing that he brought was rapport with von miller so im actually more sanguine about losing him now
holy shit defense you did it
thank you mr duverynay
let see this offense cook
go down the d probably
what a stop
a stop on 3rd down lets go
time to turn this game around

momentum has shifted
i hope they fucking run the ball
come on offense dont let yourself get outplayed by your rookie
i get the run game but we gotta get lamar into rhythm at some point
ozzie
ozzie
yeah ozzie
time to run it down their throat dont get cute g ro
love you ozzie
in ozzie we trusted woooo
ozzie newsome hof player hof gm
the wizard
pls curb stomp the qweefs 49ers fan
where is handrews when you need him
what the fuck are these play calls
short pass plays prior to the 1st down marker what the hell is this the flacco offense
hating the play calling
run the ball
yes lets all run 3 run crossing routes on third and 6 fuck you
tired of these short throws on third down
our offence is kinda fucking us right now
led with the helmet left his feet
run the ball
run the fucking ball
drops bad calls have the football gods just decided we cant beat mahomes
bullied them the whole first possession running the ball havent ran since lmao greg freezing up against good teams again
chiefs fan here im frustrated for you guys that you arent running
is roman asking madden or some shit
aaaaaand another 3 and out jesus momentum killer right there whats the point on having so many running backs and not using them at all
defense gonna get gassed real quick
lamar slinging that rock smh just have to catch that rock to
ok offense is struggling so lamar is gonna have to use his legs more
i just said run the ball wtf
feels like the chiefs offense has been on the field the entire first half
this feels like the tennessee game man lamar isnt playing bad but everyone is just dropping the fucking ball
yeah its not like running the ball worked on the first drive lets just never run it again
greg i thought you were a run first oc please dont become marty 20
alexa play im upset by drake
roman is shitting himself at this point its on harbaugh run the fucking ball how are we not running the ball once in a drive

this is upsetting
playoffs andrews showing up tonight
why are we not pounding the fucking rock come on roman
get back to running the ball
ravens need to calm down pound the rock you beat mahomes by keeping the ball away from him not trying to outscore him
this team puts too much extra pressure on themselves during big games lamar needs to learn to start adjusting plays at los because romans bs is what lost us the playoff game last time and is losing us this one
stop fucking getting cute greg roman run it down bruhh
stop going for the ball and tackle
tackling is so fucking soft
the best running team in football going against one of the worst running defenses in football and they stopped running it after the first drive yeah thats greg roman
in the playoff game we ran the ball like 13 times are they really that dumb i dont understand
damn im gonna cop an x chair looks comfy as fuck
kelce already with 64 yards going to end up with 120
stop playing fucking zone
no pressure just means 10 yard plays every down
we are going to lose unless this playcalling balances out
roman is going to gas our defense if this keeps up lamar for the most part looks sharp but the calls are situationally weird
ran over chuck clark how many times are we gonna hear that this season
defense needs to step it up
like 8 yards a rush the first few drives and we just stopped did we learn nothing its still the first half ffs not like its the 4th
whats with this soft defense
so we need to draft edge top 2 picks
we are playing scared man
wow what do you know they press the receivers and mahomes has to hold the ball and then bail

imagine
wonder where those first downs came from certainly not from running the ball hmmm
7 passing yards man that just sucks
play pressman they need to bump these damn wrs and tes
of course they convert here comes another 6
just like the titans game we are down by 3 and completely give up on the run against a terrible rush def
dude why do our defenders freeze whenever they see a lane to the person with the ball
said it before and i will say it again you cannot win games giving up 45 yards a play
they had wolfes jersey unreal

refs all over the chiefs dicks per usual
tackle the fucker
holding just isnt being called in the nfl this year
outside of the first drive we have not looked good tonight
were gonna have to rely on special teams arent we
we rush 5 instead of 3 there we get the sack this defense aint gonna suffice to get through the playoffs
every time with the chiefs and titans unreal our coaches cant get us prepared or recognize the issues
blatant holding going unnoticed of course
safeties playing 30 yards deep is letting mahomes pick us apart lol
the only way judon gets pressure
20 mil
calais campbell giving some haloti ngata playmaker vibes
judon earning that money and by that money i mean no money
fuck judon man he doesnt do shit but get coverage sacks
thank god we didnt sign judon long term dude sucks ass
can we end the matthew judon experiment please
fucking holding on campbell
lol
nice hold on the center there
totally not living up to the hype ravens falling flat
we cant be losing at halftime fuck
man cant call a hold but call a pretty good timed jump
fuck
why cant we stop this fucking team jfc
i swear if we go for another 3 consecutive pass plays
i wonder if roman knows they can just run the ball and sustain drives
roman dont worry guys lets come out passing
hold
can we run please
we will probably abandon the running game as we always do when we start losing
man our passing game needs to get going gotta target boykin duvernay if he gets in the game because they are loading up on andrewsbrown
seems like the chiefs are our new kryptonite we just cant get it done
can we just call the whole they wont call holding every play i like the way its worked out for the chiefs
hey greg how about a run play this drive maybe two if were lucky
run
the
fucking
ball
were gonna win on god
3 runs and if its a 3 and out so be it
i understand the premise behind people who want to run the ball in these kind of games but at some point you need to see lamar throw the ball 40 times and win a high pressure game ultimately that is what wins in the nfl now a days not running the ball and defense
run it every down
the only reason were in this game right now is because of special teams im sure ill get downvoted for saying it but its true offense has looked like shit mainly due to playcalling but dropped passes arent helping defense looks like shit both in playcalling and execution we need something on this next drive and we need halftime to come quick because we need serious adjustments our defense couldnt stop a nosebleed right now
we love throwing boots back to the line of scrimmage huh
what the fuck is this play calling
baltimore pass the ball to the los ravens
this d is selling out on the run and still getting coverage done
ah

so you call holding on them now
okay now a holding call
lamar has 89 open but under threw him
play calling is garbage but it also doesnt help that no one can catch a damn thing
i swear the crowd noises theyre pumping in are like a kc home game
wow the chiefs have our number right now we just need to survive to the half
stop doing that
we got fans cheering the chiefs at home wtf
jackson is off tonight
my god our offense cant do anything
man were in that mode where we cant do anything right
it seems like nothing is breaking our way tonight
sigh
ugh on monday night football too
everyone us getting the blame of the game lol
of all the weeks for offense and defense to play like total shitn
we punt well
were not playing to our level right now

shit is frustrating
thats basically how this fucking game is going were running into our fucking self
offense looks like hot garbage
lamar looks absolutely awful today he needs to get his head right
turnover here would be huge
our d is gettin sooo tired
offense cant do anything tonight zero energy whatsoever our best play is by a rookie
our offense cant seem to do a damn thing
that first cant come fast enough
less than 20 yards passing and run game has been stopped since the first drive basically the chiefs are incredible but we handing them this one
wolf looks like hes 50
nobody is making plays simple as that duvernay single handedly keeping this from being a halftime blowout
we just a team full of chokers i guess idk anymore
pass protection and edge d are our weaknesses need rg and olb ive been fucking saying this for years its retarded how obvious it is and our team doesnt fix it
of course you take a shot on 21 thats analytics not just me
our offensive play calling is so retarded
were folding like a lawn chair
fuck all of this gesticulates wildly
defense play decently challenge
im not having fun right now
cant tackle lol make have to take a half hour break from this shit we look so sorry out there doesnt even look like half the team is trying
eeeeelaire
these canned in stadium cheers are starting to piss me off
ravens are averaging 8 yards a carry
hopefully the right halftime adjustments will get us back in this game
you cant get coverage sacks without eventually getting to the quarterback
i can take losing a good game but this shit is embarrassing defense getting handled offense looks like like shit this is tennessee all over again they better wake the fuck up at halftime
when a team like the chiefs works over your favorite team you shouldnt be that upset

honestly they have the qb1 in the nfl and a top 35 hc

but jesus fuck at some point the ravens need to take a leap and beat this fucking team
playcalling sucks lamar is frazzled and mahomes is mahomes thats why were losing
mahomes missed yikes its bad im so happy about that
what the fuck
we all know how good lamars two minute offense is
see you guys for the playoffs





maybe
you have to be fucking kidding me
fuck this shit
defense never heard of it
defense is straight up sleeping
this is the kind of game that would have been useful to have played sometime in 2019 before the playoff game eventually you are going to have to play from behind

settle the offense and play our game who cares what the defense does just settle and let our offense find a rhythm
lmao
i saw the future return td
lol wide open
game
stop blitzing marlon
this game is probably over lmao
i dont care what you guys think elliot fucking sucks
there it is its about to get ugly folks
its not over but its going to take lamar going ultra instinct in the 2nd half to win this
looooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool

im dying inside
way to come up small again baltimore
i would not be opposed to trading a future first for a premium pass rusher
this is what happens when you give up on the run and give the ball directly back to an elite offense
so is earl thomas ready to come back or
here comes a 3 and out total of 4 passing yards on the drive
butker is dancing with the devil on these xps
what was elliott doing
bruh we blitz our best corner to get near sacks were sacrificing coverage because of it and were still going to it welp idk about you boys but i for one know what kinda season it will be if we cant generate pressure and fix our communication
guess its safe to say the run game is gone lol
its unfortunate that when we get kc at home in primetime we dont have any kind of homefield advantage because we have no crowd its whack
idgaf just improve before the playoffs
deshon still a liability 10 min later
peters has blown coverage 4 times
i remember last week when i said elliot was gonna get us fucked by the chiefs and got downvoted
thank you earl thomas you fucking psycho
kicking a field goal on that first drive set the tone
if we dont do anything this drive im calling it
please keep dobbins in i beg you
man i hope for a td before half
mahomes is eating the blitz alive

wink guess that means im not blitzing enough

defense nonexistent
pathetic its over
i wouldnt be so pissed if we didnt look so fuckin pathetic on offense if it needs to be a shootout then fuck it shoot it out but we cant even get yards
im glad we got smoked we needed an ego check
lol this is actually kind of funny now
so our pass rush is so bad that we need to have our allpro corner blitzing on 3rd and 14 when i saw that i knew it was a tuddy immediately

holy shit were so trash tn
are ypu fucking witb me
good luck fucking next holy shit im done
gg goodnight
this is fucking pathetic
i was hoping that was incomplete but its definitely a fumble
nah nah lol no
at least he didnt get hurt
okay yeah this is a nightmare
i went back and watched that offside again judon moved before the ball was snapped but he wasnt across the line and you see the ball move i think it was timed perfectly and not the right call
was his arm not going forwards i swear it looked like it in that replay
i gotta take a walk to cool off man
rip me another penis hole
3510 here we come
if they score a touchdown im turning this off
is this a shit show yet
lmao
this games over
there we go imagine if mahomes gets another td here lol
this is impossible how is this happening i cannot believe it
the ravens are looking more like the eagles
wtf is judon doing
great give mahomes another chance at a td
lol judon

you big soft fucking sissy
judon you loser lol bring him down
well this fucking blows i was hoping for at least a close game but nope everyone has to play like shit today
its getting ugly
punched in da mouf
fucking hell oline im so ashamed of my teams effort today every single motherfucker aside from calais campbell has been awful
how the fuck is that not a hold on judon
seriously whats wrong with the core they havent been able to show up in a big game when it counts
at least its the chiefs shredding us early this year not the browns
mahomes getting a tug on his shoulder explains the defense planbook tonight
bring him down judon you fucking pussy
judon is hot garbage shouldve traded him when he actually had value
thanks for ruining the rest of my week roman
i dont get why no timeout during that last drive had 3 with a minute left can take a minute to think through some plays
stop blitzing him it hasnt worked
these are the people i would like to thank so far

thanks for reading my list
maybe our offense is only sucking because jordan taamu is a practice god
we aint winning shit this year or any year sadly
mahomes has a limp
every throw he makes is perfect lol how
i like the ravens
what happened to marquise brown
why didnt we trade for yannick
hey but we have buttfucker at least
better than tucker btw
butker is actually cheeks
do we really have the best corner duo in the nfl does it matter anyway nope
god bless butker for saving us the embarrassment
ay remember when peyton manning tore us a new asshole in 2012
tucker is the king
lol fuck your kc kicker
idiots on here told me elliot would be better than thomas lmao
at least justin is smiling
justin kicker makes that easily
belee
well at least we know tucker is in butkers head
lets look on the bright side guys they could have 31
yooooo now we call a to
lol 35 yards
what is happening this is some seriously terrible game management
dropped one for the road
wtf andrews
truly a shameful display by the entire team
lmao wtf is happening
wake the fuck uuuuuupppp
last year week 3 we were down 17 also we nearly came back just gotta hope for a complete shift of focus at half
bruh what the hell were those two plays lmao
can someone on offense make a play my god
wheres my mark butterfingers andrews meme from last year
its not unfamiliar against kc
lmfaoooo this is why i low key didnt wanna trade hurst andrews has games where he drops everything so it would be nice to have a legit backup te option
that was worse than anything else ive seen all night wide open miss on first with no pressure and no db even close then an uncontested drop mental midgets
35 passing yards not good
what in the fuck was that last two plays you just have to laugh at this point
our team has a huge mental block for the chiefs and the playoffs its so weird
if it wasnt for special teams wed be down by a lot more than 17
i let the talking heads convince me all week that our defense is perfectly suited to stop the chiefs offense what a bunch of idiots myself included
fuck me that was a pathetic half of football
were losing

we dont look good

and now we have to listen to booger mcfarland

this is the worst
drops shit throws and bad defense when we lose we fucking lose bad
what are you gentlemen drinking tonight
ayo do they need new hands
trying to remain positivebut schefter is such a penis
dline is nonexistent
please god can we move to zone coverage with delayed blitzes or a spy i swear wink just thinks he can attack everyone without using his head they are too fast to play man coverage and mahomes is money against the blitz being outcoached
so andy reid is an offensive genius you have to give home credit only way the chiefs come down to earth is the offseason tbh the money isnt gonna be there
why do they keep doing this shit
i think this one is out of hand but i really hope the ravens can show some fight in this second half i think adding a veteran like calais campbell can help us do that
we usually bounce back after ugly losses i think well go somewhere in the playoffs as long as we get shit on just like this sometime later in the regular season
first half is the definition of a bruh moment
honest question 10 more years of prime brady or 10 years of prime mahomes
defense going to need a couple turnovers to have a shot here
man i dont want mahomes to get it back to start the half lol
only hope i have to stay awake for 2nd half is that they basically played a perfect first half and we played the worst 1st half i remember in a long time i hope ocdc can make adjustments we have been embarrassed lucky that fans arent there or they would be booing and walking out what a kick in the mouth
another good comp for this game is 2014 steelers we could not stop ben at all
just signed wink up for keepscom so he can keep the fucking ball out the end zone
this is going to be a great narrative for our super bowl season recap
im gonna just say that this mahomes guy is pretty good at playing football
well we are going to get rocked probably go 151 and then get bounced in the divisional round by some 88 97 team like the fucking raiders
queen is having a shocker
look its judon still doing nothing
throw the flag cuz he limps

since when
thats not even close to a fucking horsecollar
another bad call
holy shit enough with these bullshit calls
haha the refs are so fucking transparent
a lot of us looking like shit is definitely in us playing like shit but it doesnt help that mahomes is really fucking good
need to stop wearing black on white
this game has been horrible to watch
ref ball baby
now they are just simply disrespecting us
yo find his fuckin hood and what car he drives imma throw a fucking flag in that pussy stripes coffee tomorrow am
burn it all to the ground
we need that
maybe lamar can come out there and maybe complete a pass now
100 years of experience with the refs btw looks more like peewee football refs
no one is even covering anymore lmao
cant even blame the refs but they havent been great
huge
we need every break
so thompson is done
need 7 here if we want to make this a game
time for some points down by three scores so nothing wrong with a field goal
what the hell play calling is this
so fucking cute
is roman drunk
yea its ok to critique the team for their bad play but theres no point screaming that the season is over when its literally week 3
i know peters not playing well but god elliot has been bad
did you really draft dobbins to just be in on third downs wtf
they dont even look like theyre awake holy shit
we need to go faster chiefs aint done scoring
dive for it omg
marquise still fighting
damn so close man
in 1353859 other universes lamar lost the ball there or hollywood gave up the first down
got to keep pushing those plays we need a big play
why did hollywood not lay out for that ball
lets goooo jackson
wtf is up with brown
lets get on the board
lamar is so fast im swooning
nobody is fucking open and its pissing me off because lamar is getting blamed smh
thank you for reading my reddit comments greg roman
a wild gus appears
deep penetration lfg
the gus bus never breaks down
its like we are a team built to run the ball
lol now is not the time to be taunting gus
see when gus edwards runs the ball things go well why did it take the ravens so long to figure this out
wait we ran thats illegal
nice i was fooled there
this is our strength

dont stray from it
wow look we are moving the ball while running it
no joke im a pgh fan but went to grad school in baltimore and just popped in to see what you guys were feeling and the upvote and downvote icons are truly hilarious

were finishing this drive with 7
guess they shouldve run it more earlier in the game when it mattered more huh
triple team andrews and our passing game becomes an utter joke
why did we not do this after the opening drive
lets fucking go run it down their throats
this this this even if we still lose kinda big having to pick ourselves up off the mat against a good team is invaluable for this team

we didnt have to do it a single time in 2019 before the titans game and it killed us
ingram has been looking slow all year i love the guy but i think its time he gets passed on the depth chart
andrews what the effin hell
andrews cant catch a cold tonight
this is just like the playoffs drops everywhere

pathetic
every game we lay an egg is when mandrews leaves his hands at home there is a correlation there
fucking catch it come on

you had it just hold onto itffs andrews
damn whats wrong with andrews today
how about our receivers catch a fucking ball

get andrews the fuck out of the stadium
mandrews couldnt catch covid if he wanted to
what the fuck is andrews problem
killing us andrews
no excuse for that drop
what is happening to andrews its not physical its in his head
mannn normally thats a catch for him
can someone get mark a new set of gloves holy fuck
mark fucking embarrassing himself on national tv
love andrews but he drops more passes than any good te ive seen
i miss hurst
that needs to be caught no excuse
hurst catches that
we needed that catch man
fucking add andrews to the table of people that need to answer to having an awful game
fuck that false start come on fuck
lmao andrews cost us so big this game
practice this week needs to be blocking pass rush and mandrews catching the ball 1000000 times
these penalties killing us
fuck
its one of these games i feel like we did a lot of overthinking getting ready for this game

well get em next week folks
one thing we can still count on
can we stop shooting ourselves in the foot
still fucking got it
special teams showed up calais campbell showed up devin duverney showed up i think thats it
tuck definitely fucks atleast
no one on offense came to play no one on defense either
dont forget andy reid iswas harbaughs sensei mental edge times 100
now keep running it no matter what the chiefs do
i had a dream about this
at least automatuck is consistent
shoulda kept hurst
mark andrews is as big of a big game choker as anyone on this team
lamar looked a lot better on that drive play call was good it honestly comes down to andrews dropped td and that false start
i miss hayden hurst
the commentator need to get lamars dick out of his mouth every little thing lamar could have done this or that andrews and brown are off today and boykins is just out there running around
im so upset at mandrews
nothing from mcdonalds is ever going to be spicy enough to make me need napkins for my forehead
the crazy thing is were halfway through the 3rd is it just me or is this a really long game
unless they really believe in gus pass blocking he shouldnt be in the game at this point you need someone with hr speed that can catch

bring gus in for short yardage but on passing plays hes next to useless
so many drops feels like we signed crabtree back on
buck allen wouldve caught that andrews drop
we usually score 30 and lamar doesnt even play in the 4th we can win this but offense and defense need to play better
this could so easily be a 212731 if you give the chiefs their points but instead bad play calls and drops lead us to having 13
can we just give it to duvernay cuz hes the only one actually having a good night
time for another to
at least next year we will have fans 100 decibels makes a difference
dude the cushions in this zone are unreal
defense is lost peters trying to get queen somewhere last second no one in the middle of the field
these blitzes havent worked and arent gonna work tonight
can hayden hurst please come back we didnt mean it man
whats with all the o line penalties jeez
giving 3 guys with 0 nfl starts significant playing time is fun lol
their receivers just have so much space its ridiculous

why cant out receivers ever get that
mp isnt getting a pick six when hes playing with a 15 yard cushion
its literally so unlike us to play so much zone
having a rookie mlb is truly a double edged sword
queen is lost out there
presnap our d looks so confused this needs to be fixed
at least were not getting brigaded
please have mercy and dont go for it
4th down
manning didnt win a playoff win till his 4th year and mj didnt win a playoff series till he got scottie lol man fml im just trynna be positive but its really hard rn
great stop defense
only positive of this game is that tucker won the battle of best kicker
would be nice to have carr and thomas out there right now
lets turn this shit around boys
finally
love the fire from 44

lets score here
alright its td time ffs
touchdown please
oh fuck we held i hate this feeling of hope
fort had a td last week and now this he might be something
lets fucking go need to score here
theres some defense
needed that
its not over yet
cant even play man coverage
i love lj fort
when in doubt the ravens defense has your back for 20 years and counting
wow thats a breakstupid not to punt it deep there
wow kc is coin flipping this game for no reason
wish the offense got their asses handed to em at halftime like the defense did apparently
thats why we got the big boys
you shall not pass
td on this drive lets fucking do this
people shitting all over the defense but since the half thats a fumble recovery and a stop on 4th and 1 thats how you shift momentum
offense basically needs to score a td on every drive can they do it
come on offense get a td please im fucking begging you i want my adrenaline back
greg roman please do something
pp hard
td or bust
i honestly dont care if we lose this game i just hope this team can overcome their nerves in big games going forward
if we cant score a td here our offense doesnt even belong in the same stadium as kc
good throw wanna see boykin show up
get duv and dobbins involved
how do you get better in big games you play in big games
stop putting andrews out wide
i miss lj fort an eagles fan
get andrews more involved lol
can we please get some tempo am i crazy here we need as many possessions as possible
god damn do i love the gus bus

this is why i get so mad when roman forgets gus exists when teams have a lead the guy always delivers
good showing by the offense here but the urgency doesnt feel like its where it needs to be
feed gus
when the ravens are about to come back from a 3 score deficit and have a come from behind victory with lamar for the first time ever
bbboyle
mark andrews is really out here losing his job lol
lmao boyle brought the hands today

they caught a pass
doyle for the td
ahhhhhhhhh
thats it im dropping mandrews for boyle in fantasy
game on boys
get the fuck in boys we can do this
i swear if the defense falls asleep again
yo i knew nick in college and believe it or not his neck was bigger than it is now
cmon defense give me one more
now just for the defense to not shit the bed
give more playing time to the backups they want it
cmon ravens do us a solid and pull this off
im soooo freakin happy we finally turned a drive into a td today will admit that i really didnt want roman to call a pass there but we got the tuddy so i cant be mad
i love this team
touchdown ravens i hope you come back and win this
it was always our plan to trail at the half thus deepening kansas citys eventual humiliation
what do we have to do to get mahomes to not just pull some voodoo shit here
147 lets go
we have 53 yards in the passing game lol thats 1 throw for the chiefs
queen and peters need to get their shit together and wink needs to fucking disguise coverage

lets go get a stop
i want to feel hope but my mind is telling me to prepare for pain
am i faded or did i hear some halo music in that army commercial lmao
thank god for 4 points off the board from butker
youd think with all the improbable comebacks the past couple of weeks people would be more chill

breathe

believe in the men
need is a 44 forced to
i miss tavon
me right now
they pull queen
just a reminder that the chiefs have the 27th ranked rushing defense going into this game
gimme a pick six mp
theres always somebody open its insane
does any team in the league give up more 1st downs on 3rd than us
i only see that happening to us
and another screenshort pass
and then the defense goes full ree mode again
yeah creative pressure is exactly what we need on the most important 3rd down of the fucking game
why are we blitzing when its generating zero pressure
stop getting cute and just get on your man goddamn
i feel a turnover on this drive i sense it in the universe
its about time for judon to make a play he needs to impact the game in some way
why do the football gods hate us
new fuck it tyrek is down there somewhere meme
i swear to god

get a sack
so many near sacks
hahaha judon is so bad who here honestly thinks hes good hes not he has one move and sucks at it just look at 37yr old suggs and hes even better
where the fuck is the zone coverage
moment of positivity because why not averett has not been the reason were losing
diabettus
dont give up the big play get this stop and we can tie
see how we made him overthrow there do that again
bench judon too fuck it
why are we doing the same shit over and ovee
where the contain
hey no matter what happens at least we put up a fight and didnt totally fold plus we could still win
if we didnt blitz there wouldve been someone to tackle him
holy crap please get a stop

its over if we dont
oh my fucking god
ugh you know you have to contain mahomes
awful fucking blitz
bad defense again no contain whatsoever
how was that not illegal motion
fuck you judon fucking terrible
yes blitz in the same gap holy shit you learn how to not do this in middle school football
i wish theyd just get rid of this crowd noise
please stop fucking blitzing all its doing is removing a defender
defensive needs to make a play now sack pick something cant allow more than 3 points here
fucking stop them please
fucking tackle him come on
eelair counter starting now i
defense full of frauds
tyreek hill is literally just faking our whole defense out without even touching the ball
i feel a turnover coming
so heres what kc will do just run the clock down and run a play with less than 5 on the play clock

immediately calla time out with over ten left
this is basically where i expected the game to be one score hoping for a defensive stop late and a last minute drive

i didnt expect a miracle would be needed to get it back to one score
remove judon and blitz queen boom
our linebacker coverages has been lit upppppp
you just cant stop these dudes
and we done sucks when you spot the other team an entire half of football
i love judon but fuck this man is not an elite pass rusher he only has the bulrush
lmfaooo
please stop having everyone open every play please
wow fuck this
wow
damn even the lineman get tds
thats all i can do atp just laugh
we have zero pass rush what in the hell
ugh i hate fucking trick plays
lol we all know they wouldnt allow us to run that play
next will be a 360 pass to the mascot for a td
shouldve just gave it 4 mins ago if thats how it was gonna be
from the bottom of my heart im not being sarcastic i want the offense to hold on every play make them call it
what a fucking joke
there was fucking no one even lined up on that side what the fuck was harrison doing not playing his zone
lets get pitchforks and torches and find the people who wouldnt allow a sign and trade for clowney
that drive was so demoralizing wink is just getting out classed and out secondary is getting toasted
fml if only andrews caught that endzone ball fuckkkkk
crazy to think we havent had a playoff win in almost 10 fucking years
i expect probably one more touchdown play was obviously better in the 2nd but they gotta learn to start these big games faster and stop shooting themselves in the foot
8 minutes to do something
playing like ass but its still a game lets go o
probably a bad call there
shit call again what a terrible ref
not gonna like thats a shit call
thank you pity flag
not a foul
the thing that really baffles me is that not a single player could get open or be schemed open the whole game
lmao that was a bad call for them
its still not over 1 score and one stop
these are the best refs the nfl has to offer lmao
need to get dobbins more involved
hopefully our recievers get yelled at after the game theyve gone soft
good makeup for our nonexistent horse collar earlier ill take it
bad pass from lamar there he had hollywood for a td if he lead him better
lamar come tf on dude he had that dude smoked
if thats fucking holding on us im going apeshit
shit pass lamar come on
did he just say illegal face to the hands or am i tripping
why did we have to do that fucking trash 2nd quarter why couldnt we do this instead
just give us a chance to be in it at the end i wont be satisfied but i think its important for morale
we traded hayden hurst so we kind of need dobbins to be on the field imo
andrews not dropping what is this witchcraft
lamarman wtf dude
depressing and pathetic
bonehead plays are the blame of the game tonight
what is this
sure wish we could have those for us
how about the elite kc defense ugh pathetic
where are our deep shots if lamar has made strides in passing we havent seen a bigger play call since week 1
interesting that kc blitzes work
i guess oline is done for the night or
cant do anything when 2 defenders run free
i know we keep saying run the ball but right now just pass the ball to fucking anyone
this is absolutley pathetic
jesus christ this oline
who the fuck is blocking
i could be wrong but im pretty sure the ravens were going the wrong way for a couple plays there
what even is that route hey could you gingerly just run forward and see what happens
embarrassing
what the fuck
turn it off
pass rush is teeing off
we dont deserve to comeback anyway that drive right there shows that absolutely pathic showing tonight someone light a fire under these guys cause this is bad
lamar needs to get better with his throwing plain n simple
its so dope that we destroy average and bad teams and then look fucking horrific against good teams in spots where it actually matters
thats the game
was boykin even trying on that route
jfc throw the ball to a person
theyre gonna all have to look in the mirror after this one sloppy play
can yanda come back to teach this fucking line to block
learning experience all i can say everyone from the coaches down to the water boys
sucks to lose like this on a big monday night stage but the team will learn from this and will bounce back im hopeful for the remainder of the season
nice illegal contact missed by that official there if that happens while ravens on d its illegal contact 10 times out of 10
if the oline doesnt block for lamar hes gone by week 5
life is pain that is all
id say gg but was it
i think a few absolute bullshit penalties early in the game really fucked everything up
wow dobbins only had 1 rushing attempt
the tackles looking bad but lamar looks like he dropping way back
mahomes with 197 passing yards and 3 tds against the blitz today both are career highs
at least we get to prove were the best team in the league by beating the washington football team next week bleh
all around bad performance tonight i knew mahomes would play lights out but i did not expect our defense to look that bad and the offense to be that out of sync bad combo
that sums up the night two dudes just abandoning kelce
turns out having a tackle who runs 59 isnt a good idea for stopping outside pass rush
gg and goodnight
to those replying points on the board are better than giving the ball back to the team whos been carving them up all god damn night
yo we cant tackle
that graphic holy crap it burns
well that was dissapointing
this announcing team cant get kcs collective cock out of their mouths its unreal
were gonna get smoked boys
biden will raise your taxes meanwhile donald paid 750

lol imagine believing that bs
stop shutting on judon that wasnt even offside
we dont need earl thomas a ravens fan who doesnt know football telling me how deshon elliot is good
how is that lamars fault you retards
did andrews forget his insulin
its funny how quickly everyone forgets what this team used to look like with flacco when we struggled to even beat slightly aboveaverage teams jackson has 1 bad game and everyone goes back to the same shit they said 2 years ago fucking grow up
some of you fucks are acting like big babies the game is only half over how many times have we as fans had to suffer through 4th quarter flacco coming from behind to get the w
goddamn edwardselaire never gets tackled on the first try
a lot of yall are shitting on judon but hes being held damn near every play
we are not good when the big lights are on straight crumble under pressure when facing good teams in playoff atmospheres its not even debatable at this point
gg chiefs this team has a long way to go
chiefs stopped us

jk lol
slippery bois
bullshit flag lmao
flag looked pretty weak
mp aint trying to tackle again
judon is ass
best kicker amirite s
judon just stopped his pursuit on that td
i wanna see harbs rip off the analytical glasses and get the neck vein popping
roman calling scared and refs fucking us this is an l
how do i get mayfield off my television
that was opi full arm extension
these plays are phenomenal
our defense is trash change my mind
wheres the guy who told me im not a fan cuz im frustrated i want his permission to be frustrated now
run the damn ball and if youre gonna pass lets air it out
that looked pretty clean to me
i know nothing about the rules even less nowadays but surely thats a hold on wolfe and a blatant one at that
he jumped sure but offsides not quite the ball was moving by the time judons foot crossed into the neutral zone
not offsides
jesus fuck its like this team has no idea how to play from behind
refs really want the chiefs to win this game god forbid patty has to work for a win fuck off man
is this when trolls from other teams start pooring in
guarantee we throw it non stop again next drive for no reason
well we sure arent gonna run the ball now
roman is gonna make lamar pass all night
dont forget guys the qweefs only win if theyre losing in the second
damn lamar is doing a check down joe impression
we need to pass the ball but we need better passing plays
its gonna be 3410 before we get the ball back
roman is proving he cant make a pass offense
this team just cant hang in big games for some reson
we play like dogs shit when it matters
the fucking hold on 75 there too its getting boring to even watch
yeah this is exactly what i wanted to watch on my birthday
ravens just not caring at all this game even the fake crowd too lazy to distinguish who to cheer for lol
lamars looking like the antiflacco in more ways than one flacco would be mediocre all year and then randomly show up in big gamesplayoffs and lamar seems to do the exact opposite
we just dropped in the power rankings
good night boys
thats what a pass rush looks like ravens

but hey at least youre paying 17 million for judon morons
this team always ends in disaster when they have a big game
judon is so shit
serious question considering pregame expectations is this the worst ravens performance of all time this sounds like an overreaction but im not sure that it is
lamar has been flacco bad
where are all those folks earlier in the game barking about doomsdaying and youre not real fans if youre already freaking out

lmao this shit has rolled downhill so predictably
post the post game thread you cowards
were better without earl thomas
run the damn ball fairweather fans can leave
best kicker in the league get the fuck out of my face with that
lol fuck all yall giving up already its bad but we have a chance

jkits pat mahomes
aight not good as tough as it gets to comeback from

we still got lamar john a great defense against other teams maybe but we got to wake the fuck up right now

honestly couldve been more than 3 possessions
i still belee
lamar really having the worst game of his night against the best team in the nfl dudes getting the pressure get to his head
not believing this is happening

harbaugh is being schooled by andy reid

our o line is a joke we have no pass rush

lamar looks scared and completely undone

goddamn fucking shit
i wanna be happy about this so bad but just watch as we go 3 and out i bet you fuck man i hope im wrong but i think we all know in the back of our minds its very likely
14 point game is manageable just need to get out of our own heads
cant have drives of 7 minutes when were down like this just to end up with 3 points for fuck sake if i see anymore false starts im gonna blow my brains out
the manager of the chuck e cheese has just informed me that my language is not family friendly
gus will be our featured back very very soon
pound the fucking rock
so naturally ingram will get the ball the next 3 runs
fuck fairweather fans win or lose my team fights
pick 6 incoming
i love how weve been getting torched and were down by 7 were gonna win this dont me later
what a fucking dick tease this comeback could have been instead were just going to get roasted all week
just a reminder that justin fucking herbert in his first game ever put up 300 yards on kc
chiefs acting like this is their super bowl with all these trick plays
lol left tackle td embarrassing
a penalty on the chiefs thats illegal
seriously starting to build that big ben type hate towards mahomes
hahahaha what the fuck are we doing
completely outclassed coaching wise and lamar cant stretch the field
lamar looked shaken there harbs shouldve called to when lamar was bitching about something before 2nd down
out coached and out played officially worried about this team in big games now we cant ignore it anymore
just do not show up in big games absolute panic after 4 drives repeat this ideology needs to change man
lamar looked average tonight sam darnold average love jackson to death but mahomes outclassed him in every category even running tonight
frog voice
were frauds wont be able to beat kc until we get a real pass rush
why is this announcer riding the chiefs dick
idgaf i still believe lamar is gonna win us a super bowl hell figure it out the dude is insane
some of yall werent here for the boller era and it shows get the fuck out of here if you dont know how to support the ravens during a bad game ive felt worst during a game with flacco under center
good game all much respect

from a chiefs fan
stop calling yourself a raven fan if your a bigger critic of lamar then fans outside of the franchise im sick of it every time were losing here comes the kids from dundalk with the hot racist i knew all along takes
theres the end of the kicker debate
i havent watched the ravens muchi really like how harbaugh was jawboning that ref not so sure its helpful but its cathartic
these threads get so pissy so quick lol
90 seconds ago this sub crying about being down 1 score and talking sh1t the d

against the sb champs
ravens and dropped passes name a more iconic duo
if they score before half theres no shot we win if we cant beat them at home i dont see how were gonna beat them in the playoffs new year same shit
just love getting embarassed on national tv
lamar needs to take over this game

no more overthrowing his receivers or rocketing shortyardage passes too hard he needs to develop some touch on his balls

but even more importantly step up to be the leader the team needs him to be
even if we lose you still got your ankles broken by lamar pussy ass chiefs
we needed clowney
were laughably bad in big game situations
he has zero time to pass offense in general looks bad
this is basically our week 1 lol first game against a real team that actually exposed our issues so we can fix them
this was a tough loss but we needed it i am very upset but this is healthy
respect to the chiefs they ate us alive today shows the team they need to get to work

fix the o line
get better at defense stop blitzing on every down
make sure andrews works on his hands
another big game another no show by lamar and roman the chiefs could barely sneak by the chargers yet make the ravens look like the browns wrap it up fellas another one and done season incoming

edit yes i know the defense looks bad the chiefs offense is elite and the ravens o cant give the d any time to rest not excusing the play just not nearly as disappointing
its probably too late to come back in this game but the bright side is that the ravens miscues are correctable id be more worried if we were playing well techniquewise yet got torn apart
mahomes is a cocky little cunt isnt he
i always regret coming in here during the game the amount of fake fans who came this or last year just insane i lose brain cells in here
we wont ever win a superbowl with this defensive line and an offense that chokes
there a lot of little bitches in here
the fuck yall keep saying lamar has no time for hes made it work before with no time a lot of good qbs do russ mahomes rodgers dak etc all make it happen even though their oline collapses at times and lets be real ravens oline is one of the better in the league still

lamar has not been an accurate passer even with time the passing stats speak for themselves forcing lamar to throw and boxing him in has proven to be a successful strategy lamar has not proven to win from behind because he literally cannot throw his way to a come back victory hes just not there yet i hope he will be but

lamar gave us one fucking td today he should have had 3 or more if he could improve his accuracy

kc does not have an elite fucking defense stop spinning it for lamar the chargers just took them to fucking ot
awful play call
dont get why you stop running the ball just seems like youre bailing kc out
2nd and 3 and you dont convert still incredibly early and you love to see points but come on man neither 2nd nor 3rd down looked like it had a chance
3rd down play was the right one imo i dont get the 2nd down call though just run the ball like youve been doing if it aint broke
im a colts fan but i absolutely love lamar jackson hes a good dude want him to win a ring or two soon
yo i thought the game started at 830 im dumb
well that outside run issue is yeah
thats bullshit
where was the face mask
defense garbage on that drive
buttkicker
that was a fucking pathetic drive by our defense
best kicker in the league my ass
defense still trash against kc
tucker better
hahahaha butker the best
butker more like bumker ha amirite
queen got picked out of the play so bad
judon has got to go if were serious about this superbowl thing hes for sure not worth 15m
no game day thread on the broncos sub so i guess tonight im a ravens fan at least you guys stand a snowballs chance in hell against the chiefs
that tripping call was bs he fell
we need to demand hussey gets fired for this horseshit
1st and 20 takes us out of our entire gameplan for the drive what a lousy call
fuck you mr ref
the lack of our home crowd really stands out that tripping call was heinous
lot of time left people have some faith d will get a stop here lets go
glad i only started coming here during lamars time cant imagine how toxic a 2015 game thread woulda been haha
heres a tip judon if you actually beat your man its a fucking screen
put campbell on kelce he seems pretty decent in coverage
okay defense get the stop i wanna see it
once they run out of creative screen plays this one is over
greg romanharbaugh need to stick to the basics versus the chiefs theyre always getting too cute and trying overthink the offensive play calling
lets get hype we got nothin to worry about
roman has some of the worst playcalling in games like these its shocking
fuck belichik and his corny ass look
peters having an awful game so far
we just collapse in meaningful games
trade for melvin ingram
throwing a 3yard pass on 3rd and 6 brilliant
andrews why cant you catch it when it really really matters
this offense is giving me flashbacks from 201718 flacco
run the fuxking ball

god damnit dont get into a fucking shooting match with mahomes we ran 60 yards on the first drive and have stopped running the fucking ball
how was that not holding for fucks sake
theyre holding everything
well thats game roman isnt gonna call a run play the rest of the game
holding is not a thing in this game get over it thats just the way the refs are gonna call it
good coverage just a perfect pass
if i see that fat fuck center hold one more god damn time and get away with it
football has to be scripted why do we always have perfect storm scenarios for choking
this offense could not look any more uninspired lamar is also having a bad game
mark androps
sigh im sick of the coaching someone has to go it makes no sense why the ravens forget how to play football vs good teams
im killing myself
judon crashes inside and then loses his motor when he sees mahomes going by him fuckin loser we look pathetic
lamar has missed a few crucial throws defense isnt getting any rest
this is tough to watch boys someone cheer me up
game over embarrassment for the entire country to see
yeah this ones over our offense has 7 passing yards and they have 5 times that in one play greg roman and a lamar jackson lead offense has never been one to come back from behind
we wont miss earl thomas
lamar is having a abysmal game
and now we are the laughing stock of the nfl for a week
there is legitimately 0 safety help deshone elliot has no business playing in the nfl
its not the reason were losing but seriously not a single hold on these past 3 drives
at least we can watch this tucker wannabe completely blow what should be money kicks
we can come back man i just know we can
i havent been in this thread all night but i just want to say im not giving up hope truzz must have truzz
if that last pass wasnt indicative of how andrews and the team has played i dont know what is
andrews with 3 drops and counting hes a bit of a choke artist isnt he
i hope we dont even come out at all in the second half just go home guys you sucked enough for tonight
we got out coached today boys
i love how so many people slept on kansas d after a bad game two for me i knew their d was good enough to hang with us and it would be grudge match if anything the biggest surprise so far is our own defense elliot i hate to say looked a little lost
i think we should pull a sean payton and call an offside kick to start the game
they got the best of us they did tonight was not it for us but im thankful its early in the season just play them tough in the second half give us something to be hopeful about
refs are actually fucking blind
i hope this ref steps on a lego every day for the rest of his life
he said they throwin a party here in baltimore

x200b

lmao ded
fire roman i cant stand his fucking playcalls
pitching a shutout

only have given up 3 points

what
and lamar misses his guy again
you have been visited by the gus of bus say thank you gus in reply to this comment to score 1 million touchdowns
mandrews thinks hes the best te in the league and just booting the easy ones nah buddy
yeah everyone is fucking hungover
asdeidndbfbdkaouwgefehgeczsbczvsvzjdbd
i guess the oklahoma players bring their choking to the nfl
im going to give decosta the benefit of the doubt here seeing as hes only had 2 years on the job if he doesnt get receivers with ball skills who can catch we wont ever win a super bowl with lamar as our quarterback
sign antonio brown
i think as a qb lamar needs to be a bit more demanding of his teammates i mean how many dropped passes have happened not just this game but also against the titans
anyone have a favorite windows installation company got like 4 windows i need to replace
super glad i played the lamarhollywood combo in fantasy 03 it is

gus better stay next year i was sad when hayden left
run this ball down their got damn throat
my final words will be stop blitzing
call me a homer but the ravens played 1 really bad quarter which caused the large deficit i think we could keep up with them if we get another chance glad running the ball in the second half proved worth it so that we have a blueprint when we do fall behind
judon should just fucking take the refs out at this point
mahomes counting the missed holds on big plays
indefensible throw there smh
well everyone i have to say thats it on to washington
salary issue solved lamar stanley humphrey stay judon andrews and obj walk
lamar had a shit game oline had a shit game defense was garbage everything was bad except rbs tucker and duvernay everyone else needs to figure it the fuck out cause we have a short week

tyus cant tackle judon proved hes overrated lamar needs to learn to not take easy sacks and throw it away and we have got to get better at not being so soft in coverage against teams like this
this is why niner fans were laughing at the roman hire lol
lamar is choking so hard sucks to see such a bad performance after two good weeks
last year the ravens were down 17 at half and we were very close at coming back believe in the flock and get out fairweather fans
imagine actually thinking we were the favorites lol
literally on every play the kc offense egregiously holds no flags anywhere or any time

fuck these refs
well one thing is certain mahomes is the real deal reminds me of rodgers in his prime

i dont mind losing to a player of his caliber
fuck this im out was nice watching my favorite team be a national embarassment again catch yall next week when we somehow lose to the team with no name
love this team but do not trust them to come from behind
this is a brutal performance so far
and were done
shitty throws from lamar
some of you guys are trash fans
it sucks were losing but im still happy i get to watch my favorite team play football
ravens about to dominate the second half dont lose hope theyre right where lamar wants em
reveivers dropping every pass like the titans game defense cant stop shit like the titans game team abandons the game plan as soon as start losing like the titans game what a fucking embarrassment chiefs will own us for the rest of eternity
reminder that ab is still a piece of shit
games like this show who r bandwagons and soft ass fans its one game my god playing by far the best team in the league
all you fuckin fake ass fans sayin gg at half i wish you would remove yourself from this subreddit because you have no concept of how quickly football can transition and how effective we can be if we learn and adjust yall have no idea what youre talking about
alright its over

fuck you roman
theres just nothing we can do to beat them nothing even if andrews caught it in the end zone even if we got 7 on the first drive even if the refs called literally anything on kc it wouldnt matter theyd find a way or wed find a way to lose i am utterly disgusted in the entire team
honestly this isnt even lamars fault the rest of our team was just complete dogshit tonight

alright game gnight yall
lamar quit on the team there out of frustration not a good look
patrick mahomes is the goat were a goddamned good football team and he made us look like a peewee squad no shame in losing to him

lets fucking gooooooooooo
ravens
its time
this is the best ive felt before a game in a while lets goooooo
hey guys hows it going happy to be here tonight with u all
lfg flock cant wait to see them boys eat
if i see one more ad for fubotv im going to mail them the biggest shit i take this week
i have too much money in this game
lets do this
its all fuck the chiefs from here on out
the game isnt on local tv you have to have espn
why couldnt this be a 700 pm game i am peaking early
did they end up letting some fans in i heard gerry sandusky on 98rock say something about 250 fans being allowed in i wasnt sure if he just meant familyfriends or what
mahomes is licking his chops of the thought of anthony averett being on the field
im scared
tuck
lets fucking go boys
lets raise hell
llamant
pat ricard is what like 6 foot and high 200s and has a flat stomach


calais campbell is a nose tackle with no gut


what the fuck monsters are these men
he is houdini fr though
lets go game time
and herewego
this slj intro should have been set to gifwars
ublacramento you ready
here we go
and awaaaayyy weeee gooooo
nerves
good carry
lamar looking faster this week
big boi
if it wasnt drawn up that way they need to add it to the book
risky af
duvernay is so fast
this running game issexy
great approach so far use time gain confidence on the ground
wear them out early hell yeah
holy fuck were insane
quick td to mandrews
just run it over and over until kc can do something about it
there run defense is fucking ass rn
kc defense looks soft
is anyone else experiencing a delay in sound watching on cbs
love this drive get 7
they cant stop the run i love it lets fucking go
smash mouth football bb
great run defense by kc
the fuck was that
fuckkk
damn
nice drive
weird to see us kick that
campbell is out on kicks
damn really wouldve liked a touchdown there
did we swap out our playbook that were using for the first two games
here we go lets see what this d got
feel like we coulda just punched it through on that third down
just run the ball until they stop it it really isnt that complicated
should have gone for it
manleaving points on the board
aye we just warming up and john dont wanna get killed being overly aggressive like previous chiefs games
we have the number one defense in the league you take the 3 its not a hard decision
pass protection isnt giving us time to set up plays
did anyone elses feed switch over to some acc espn show
wish we would have kept with the run in the red zone but theres still plenty of football left
show your balls coach were playing the champs cmon
lets hope roman sticks to running when it works and doesnt outroman himself
never understood how a defensive penalty for 5 yards is an auto 1st
god damn tyreek is so fast
now they have whistles lol
jimmy smith on tk im ok with that elliot on tk not so much
pressure has actually been getting there but the secondary is shitting the bed
tyreek you should be in jail
i know kc is good but this is pathetic on defense
do they ever call holds on the offensive line anymore
peters fucked that up
wtf defense
i just want to complain about my friend i got him into liking the ravens he never played football growing up or in college or anything and now anytime i say anything at the ravens should have done i am always wrong sheesh
absolute garbage defense there
lol this guys better than tuck
just walked in smh
what the actual fuck was that
show some balls coach
lol butler missed
well that was awful defense only 6 though lfg
x200b

lol butker missed an extra point wow
chotker
why do we never blitz in the 1st quarter our play calling has been weird in the first halves
not setting an edge come on guys
tucker would never
well hooray its still a field goal game lol
its only one drive dw
well that helps
outside d needs to freaking step it up
i hope we win by 1 point
that edge contain or lack thereof was weak by judon a half hearted spin move and caught way to far up field maholmes walked around him to the corner
that felt like a really weird drive by chiefs we need to have a longgggg drive here with a lot of running
we need a legit pass rusher asap
did we have all 11 guys on the field that drive it looked like 6
i feel like with et3 deep peters wouldnt have to play so conservatively he has fewer shots to get those signature pick6
we really need a lb to set an edge
our defense didnt come close

our offense did but got scared at the end

good drive needed here
hahah we didnt score a td so jt could assert dominance
ref is soft
yeah never mind ref
wtf another flag
good lord that is the single most competent instance of officiating i have ever seen haha
sure is a rocky start so far
sure call that let go the obvious holding sure
ref ball
harbaugh heated lmao
horseshit
this is the same crew who called that awful ot steelers away game last year btw
i hope you guys are as excited about duvernay as i am as a longhorn i watched him catch every ball thrown his way for several years im looking forward to him having a long great career with the ravens
wtf
another fucking bullshit call
what is this play calling throw downfield
wait what was the penalty that set harbaugh off
i see where this game is getting called same as last year
sigh
stop trying to get so fancy keep it together

looks like last year
i dont understand we ran the ball well on the first drive and then we just stop
time to start injecting the alcohol into my veins
they are only down by 3
this team has no idea how to play while behind if they give up another td on this drive its going to get out of hand
fuck i dont want to see baker rn
lets go d 3 and out
d needs to step up here
nope we werent ready

harbaugh needs to do a better job with the young guys in big games we dont have ray and ed anymore to ground us i have never seen us come out looking 100 focused against any team but the patriots primetime game last year
what the heck was with that tripping call are our guys supposed to vanish into thin air the moment they hit the ground or something

at least glad to see harbs saw the same exact thing and having the same exact reaction as i did
tuff enough to have to beat the chiefs if the refs are on their game when you get a call like that against you its damn near impossible we are due a makeup call big time
got behind on that drive and were not clicking in the pass game well be alright everyone take a deep breath
healthy does of red ball being played here cant wait to see a chopping call to complete my 1st quarter scorecard
calais save us
lol giving these refs credibility and they still fucking blow
draft some ols and dls next year otherwise well have the same result for the next decade lamar is consistently running for his life against prime opponents dline disappears when we need them
play calling was bad but we also had 2 almost fumbles defense needs to get our mojo back
if they have so much experience why have they blown two calls
stop trying to rip the ball out and tackle
thats a big boy run
lol queen tackled elliot
so we not wrapping up in 2020
how is he pushing a pile of 5 defenders with no help
need a stop
ok that was kind of embarrassing you got 34 guys on ceh and you cant take him down
fucking ass
they are just picking apart the d right now
nice stunt too bad they cant stop screens
bowser bit on the screen
holy crap an actual call against the chiefs
defense tackle ceh challenge
wtf is jimmy doing he didnt even dive the right way
avaret cannot sit there and wait for him to run towards the fucking line
nice play marlo
hump came to get it on
marlon humphrey
they burned us on screen passes last yr as well
marlon

humphrey
nice stick marlon
i love humphrey
its like our defense cant tackle and out offense is asleep
marlon get that punch in
lol we are getting picked apart
need humphrey or calais to make some big plays
lol theyre going to kill our blitzes on screens lol
could we start tackling thanks
derek wolf getting worked rn
d needs to wake up
love how everyone spends all week hyping everyone up and then shits on them during the game
did he just say bowser is a good good edge rusher
this effort at tackling is pathetic
can mahomes just not
vegas called in a favor from the refs theyre getting burned on the overs need a low scoring game tonight
kelce will wreck us all game
defense sucks
we gotta have the worst team when it comes to finishing sacks
stop

getting

penalties
what is this fucking tackling
this is about to be 133 d need to figure it out and quick
flagfest continues
titans flashbacks
whats decosta doing down on the sideline
petition to give bowser more snaps
frustrating
calm down do your job
im just frustrated because we all know what this team is capable of and its domination for 60 minutes every game
all we need to do is run the ball and finish our tackles and we are coolin
the defence better get its ass chewed out when it hits the sideline i cant imagine ray standing for this tackling
if they dont have someone spotting the rb for a potential screen here then ima kick my tv lol
hold them to a fg then get a td to make it 109
come on d big stop right now
time to respond
this allstate commercial is a weird katamari damacy rip off
time to play angry in the 2nd quarter do it ravens
d is going for the turnovers only time before we get one
if we dont go up 38 points next quarter im literally killing myself several people in this thread
dammit why does andy reid have to be so good theyre tearing us up tn
we need the offense to rise up big time cause the defense cant keep up
of course they pick it up fucking fuck fuck fuck fuck
wow marcus peters head is not in this game
last year no receivers for lamar and zero pass rush

bang up job address those needs front office
fuck we suck
again ravens playing prevent defense is so fucking infuriating
i wish we couldve got clowney
judon lucky to not get flagged on that
blitz never hit home
peters needs pick six to make up for his poor tackling
wtf is peters doing
the d line still cant get pressure just like last year
aeons in the pocket
hold them to 3 or a missed fg
brandon williams making tackles on his back
lol the underneath throw of course
this is fucking stupid
wow
goddamnit
just run at derek wolf

hes getting dominated
wow
fuck man come on
great play damnit
this is what genius offensive playcalling looks like
mahomes is good
where that contain judon
what a play fuck
defense getting dissected
need a td for sureeeee
lj time lets get some points
i dont understand why we never contain the edges and let pressure come from the middle its so simple judon and bowser are not good enough lol
sigh we all recognize our issue and yet we dont trade for a good edge rusher just get rid of judon please
derek wolf is a liability
we look rough
im glad im watching this at home and not spending money at a bar being embarrassed in public
we cant pass for some reason i guess
this is a ridiculously well called game by andy reid holy fuck we looks clueless
i see there are some fans on this thread that dont have truss
ill take that too
no idea where this outcoached bit is coming from mahomes decision making and options are just unreal
they need to push the ball down the field too much dink and dunk so far
their entire gameplan is going after queen with misdirections and screens going to need to give him some help
once again judon if you make it to mahomes its a screen
im just glad mahomes isnt doing in january in front of a capacity crowd thanks titans
crawling in my skin
these wounds they will not heal

lets foukingggggg gogogogogogogooooooo
thats my kick returner
reminds me of jacoby jones
lets fucking go boi
tucker would have taken a better angle
come git some
that is what i like to see
lfg
where are the fairweather fans
jacoby jones 20
now get the stop on the d
seriously i was curious why they kicked short last time and we got it at the 34 figured it was done and they did it again
fast as fuck
fuck i was getting chips lol
edc can claim that td because our coordinating is ass
lets do that every kickoff pls
ill take that
fucccckkkk yeaaaa
sgonna be a looong game
it was all part of the plan
still fucking got it
not good for the defense but i suppose we shouldnt be picky when it comes to points lol
justin kicker
thatll do
get the ball back defense lets go
justin kicker
and hes back for kick off lol
lmao justin kicker makes sense lets just rename him at this point
hook em baby
devin duvernay was such a good draft pick by the ravens
lol ups n downs in here worse then stock market sick play
lol justin kicker
kicker tucker
the d is tired and not very good but come on stop something this time
momentum shifted lets go d your turn
that was incredible
ravens defense oh fucking great
momentum here we go
nice jon son now go cover the kickoff
ok so the announcers are questioning not kicking it through the endzone i think its the right call in general and of course it started with belechick in my observation kick to the 2 yard line and force a return its better than giving up the 25 yardlineusually
i hope we kick it short and stop them and show them how its done
justin kicker returns
truth is im tired of mahomes playing his best versus us
ravens defense with no rest no depth and going back up against mahomes
they may have two tds but ours looked a lot better
big man
andy reid is all about trickery and short stuff i feel like our d needs to be a little less aggressive especially on 3rd down
tackling looks better
please get the stop
unreal
nice stop
three and out boys
finally can we keep that pressure on mahomes please
there we go 3 and out
its time to capitalize
good shit defense there we go
good good good good
finally
lets goooooo defense
tbh i think its kinda cool that the chiefs wrs s are all in the 10s
need a huge drive from lamar and co
kelse wasnt ready
maybe momentum will help but only getting 5 seconds of rest wont make things easier on defense
i like these rookie wrs
disguise made a huge difference there

big props to wink
if we wake up we got this
action jackson time
defense came out pissed
hell yeah man they got a fire lit under their asses
good return
what was lamar mad about just now
yall ready for the lamar show
lmao he didnt even get a first down lamar better
perfect sequence kr td then 3andout by the defense
i wore number 9 tonight after all the butker hype ill take some credit for his so far shitty game

take a shot at the king you best not miss
run the dang ball
ozzie da goat
can duvernay start over boykin please
ozzie the man best be hof bound again
i thought ozzie retired glad hes still in the organization
lol
are we passing to set up the run
run the god damn ball
gator armed it
cmon you gotta catch that lets go guys
roman you killing me fam
gotta catch that
annnnnnd another fucking punt
why arent we running the ball
not one run
nice drop
garbage ass offense
marquise is way too small to be running that route
these guys are scared to get hit
jesus christ
what are these play calls
so were going to stop running the ball
just run the damn ball
dude run the fucking ball roman what the fuck now isnt the time to be marty morniwheg
receivers cant catch and greg cant call plays atm a recipe for disaster
offense looking like the flaccotrestmann era smh
why would you have everybody running cross routes there
we refuse to run the ball
i miss steve smith
starting to think this is why sf ditched roman if we make it to the playoffs and come out looking stale as hell again idk what to even say
hey how about run the ball
i just wish us losing these big games didnt come down to something as correctable as dropping passes and missing tackles
d needed a 10 minute drive got a three and out thanks gro
again run the damn ball its working just keep doing it its so frustrating
its one of those things though we wouldnt be saying shit right now if andrews had caught the pa pass that hit his hands
play calling always goes to shit in big pressure games i swear
so the refs just gonna ignore that block in the back

aight
guys the playcalling on offense is not good right now why we throwing the ball 2 yards past the line of scrimmage on 3rd and 6 i dont like the play calling at all
just run the fucking ball they cant stop it
boykin needs to either get in or get out dude just doesnt get open so he doesnt ever get looks we need a physical wr and thats supposed to be him this needs to be his year
this is the same shit i brought up a year ago and people in the sub tried to flame me roman is a run game coordinator his passing game play designs are literally as simple as they come no imaginationcreativity in the pass game just hoping that lamar makes him right hire a pass game coordinator to help him out or he has to go
6 carries is a joke
defense fell asleep again
so is the d ever going to guard kelce
on 2nd and 6 there is no way we dont get the first down if we just run it a couple of times i dont get this
where tf is our defense
marlon just let kelce get another 10 yards because he was riding him trying to punch out the ball instead of tackling him
we need more designed runs for lamar we were marching down the field doing that the very first drive
back to reality gg
nice to see our hurry up 40 minute offense to try and overcome this massive three point deficit
we absolutely refuse to try and stop kelce
i bet the analytics are saying that we need to pass the ball in order to keep up with the chiefs scoring so we abandon the run
kelce is manhandling us
why are they so fucking open
maybe we can try covering kelce today i mean he kills us every time
this fucking defense
seven fucking pass yards
dont change the fucking scheme we play press man stop with this off coverage bull shit
how are our dbs so far away
we have 60 rush yards and 7 pass and roman is calling all pass plays now
these shoulder tackles are not effective
we need a fucking pass rusher
make a tackle
why is judon in coverage
call the fucking hold
how tf does he get away hes literally a magician gotta respect it
what about holding wolfe
just 0 concentration
how the fuck was that not a hold
why is judon in coverage on 3rd down what the actual fuck
jesus christ
he pump fakes and they lose him fucking pathetic
no contain from the defense
lmaoooo go for the hit not the fake marlon drill him
i hate to say it but mahomes is amazing hope the ravens can hold them to a fg at least or get some kind of turnover
blatant hold fuck off refs
i really need judon to look like he cares even a fucking little bit
and judon covering him why
campbell is such a great addition
theyre gonna convert every 3rd down arent they
the story of this game is the complete masterclass reid is putting on the ravens vs the disasterclass roman is putting on the chiefs
can we just contain
fucking dumbass judon
ugh reids screen nonsense is super annoying
going to be offsides has to be we got pressure
humphrey for fucking dpoty
fucking hell judon
weve got a long way to go defensively
fuck off judon cant get a hit unless its late and cant get there unless its early
matthew judon going to get traded
totally held wolf
this game is ugly
looked on sides to me
judon you gone
pernell mcphee covering mecole harman shocked they picked up the first down
peters not doin hot
lol look at that hold
fuck these refs
ofgoddamncourse the one time we get pressure its because of offside
this is so fucking stupid i swear to god
matt judon is being paid 17m
has there ever been a game where judon doesnt get a penalty
another missed hold lmao
so many pick plays
that was good coverage and hill still caught a td i hope the ravens respond here fast
cant wait for judon to go what a dumb penalty
every play now will be pass
fuckkkk
we fucking need seven here
play to your strengths run the ball none of these defenses can handle this offenses are their best if this becomes catchup chiefs win it
can we run the fucking ball
of course the weekly judon fuckup and it bites us in the ass wiping away a great play by campell because of course reminder were paying this guy like 16m this year for mediocre coverage and mediocre passrush and at least one bone headed penalty a week
why have we abandoned the run
bad tripping and perfect count jump against us hate to see it
so hard to stay focused watching games when they constantly stop the game for commercials
this a mirror image of the titans game fr
no holding calls will ever get called on the chiefs i say that every year
the chiefs look like scoring every offensive drive we need some points here to stay in this game
i want to see wink fight roman after the game in the tunnel
the burger king moment just showed us what we havent been doing since the first drive
lamar hasnt had a defining come from behind win yet as far as i can remember dont give up guys stop being pessimistic little bitches and chin up this could be that game for him
lots of game left but the chargers held these guys to 20 the whole regulation at some point the defense needs to back up all the expectations
why did we draft dobbins
now when they run the ball people will bitch because they get stuffed
what is this lol
we have just given up running the ball i dont understand this at all
stop fucking checking it down
oh lookanother rollout pass to the line of scrimmage
i wanna say throw something down field but we do that and the drop it so idk what to suggest
im trying to figure out why the commercials are always seamless but during the plays my stream lags to hell and back
well at least its not another 3 and out
what is this playcalling
usually thats holding
they called a penalty on the chiefs
i cant keep watching if the play calling will continue to be this bad man what is with all this underneath shit
these passing plays are garbage
what are these pass plays
unreal
can we stop doing underneath routes for the love of god
jesus fucking christ
uggggg
no one can catch today
lamar is wildly off looks like shit tonight
our offense ughhh
this passing offense is so predictable
lamar is way off
so we just not trying tonight i guess
im sad now
that was pathetic as soon as i saw empty backfield and a 6 man blitz it was already over what is wrong with roman
offense needs to figure this shit out or its gonna get ugly
this sucks
that first drive gave me some serious blue balls
this is like the playoff game against the chargers at least the offense could move the ball against the titans
ridiculous run the ball
wth are we doing tonight
can we try and do one screen for fuck sake
the ravens are paper tigers on offense until proven otherwise
this is weak sauce
we didnt give the defense hardly any time
lol what the hell are they doing running into each other
hopefully some big adjustments can be made at halftime
we look like garbage
im sad
our defense needs a break man on the field too often
we arent going to win fucking shit in the playoffs if this is how we show up for big games
this has to be the softest most embarrassingly weak pass rush in the nfl
once again some dude was writhing on the ground and the announcers said jack shit this pissed me off in the broncos game too one of our most important players went down and the announcers said jack shit

and yall need to remember to run and play keepaway from kc
did that say 7 passing yards
judon cant set the edge for shit
judon went inside again im gonna explode
defense is fucking gassed
this is embarrassing defense might as well be asleep
they need to make tackles
the oline giving up to much pressure noone getting open or making a play when called on now kc gonna just run it on us
bruh im stressed
lamar does not look like himself
comeback in 2nd half
just show fucking something
lol what a weird commercial
barry glazer is uh

hes interesting
we need to come out with way different looks in the second half for a chance at this game
i dont care how good our run offense is roman has showed he cant make a pass offense and thats what football is about now unfortunately after this season it might be time to see if we can nab any innovators on the oc side
why does greg roman always want to act like were a gunslinger team too the run was working fine but nope he sees mahomes throwing it all over us and wants jackson to do the same just stick with the run its what this team is made for
juiceman pick 6
hopefully this isnt too bad but its not looking good right now
not a ravens fan but chill still plenty of football left to be played yall are a good team

yall will get to slaughter us cowboys later in the season along with many other teams
nothing is over till its over but im so disappointed in us right now
i feel exposed going into the half pants down junk flopping everyone watching
this team cant compete with teams with a good line with this below average pass russ
i dunno how anyone could watch judon play and think hes worthy of a lucrative contract
so chiefs d was supposed to be trash we were supposed to be the running team what an absolute embarrasment
i dont even give a shit about losing this game because i know we are getting into the playoffs either way its about how the team looks compared to last season is whats killing me
were actually really good in primetime despite losing the playoff game so this is just next level annoying
hate how soft the defense is playing
2nd half the offense has to get vertical fast they are targeting andrews so start to get players like duv or snead involved
play calling is like were playing madden against a better player and scared were gonna lose
good vibes only we know were capable of 4 tds in a half
come on d please
judon actually looks absolutely terrible
bruh
if mark andrews hauls that ball in were looking at a completely different game
what is a defense
excuse me what the frick
what the fuck is this
pain
gg chiefs
wtf
what the fuck was that
game over
we have no chance at this point
well looks like i can just go to bed
yikes
this is an ooof of a game
well pack it up lol
this sucks
who was covering him
why
jesus christ
butkers barely making these fgs lol
is peters high tf he just stopped and stood there
thats just embarrassing
what the fuck was peters doing
that was hard for me to watch
this has to be scripted lol wtf
what the fuck are they actually doing
welp fuck
this is getting tough to watch
this is down to preparation defense did not prepare for the chiefs
pain
why must you hurt me like this
bruh
gonna be a 40 point loss here
i waited all day just for this shit to happen
same old ravens cant make stops on 3rd and long
ok so the bitching should officially start even thousand years ago
welp last 2 i wasnt watching ravens won im watching today soo guess im not watching them live anymore lol
3rd and 14 and you blitz heavy wink is getting his ass kicked again
love how the defense celebrated mahomes overthrowing tyreek the only reason that wasnt a td a play earlier is because pat overthrew his man by a few feet
that pass was unreal knows hes about to be drilled drops it on a dime
i really need someone to explain to me why against the fastest receiving group in the league we put safeties on them and rush with our fastest cb
can we please stop blitzing our best corner please
time to pull out the hard liquor
tbh i more angry at our offense tbh like they were supposed to be the defense tonight
goodnight this team has learned nothing from last year
wow just getting killed
that looked like peters fault he bit up on hill
straight up not having a good time
incredible how trash we look
is it too late to bring back earl thomas
this game was hyped up all week and is over before halftime lmfao
just one game we were going to lose at least one this year anyway at least were getting it out of the way early
we are getting shat upon
well im out guys looks like now im ganna make this 12 pack disappear
2 minute offense lets go
we need a td here
why the fuck are we taking away our best defender from coverage against pat mahomes

i just have no words for this gameplan on either side of the ball
i just hope the chiefs dont get the ball back
this is fucking atrocious roman with his shit calling offenses is colder than absolute zero defense cant hold things down to save their lives we need something here because this just aint it
lamar needs to come back out now
glad this game is week 3 had the same issue last year and edc made some impactful changes quick
this drive is literally the game
cool here we go with 6 yard runs
fucks sake
ok im leaving before this gets ugly
imma rip the dab pen and draw up some plays for wink
thats not a fumble
jesus christ what a shit show
i need the same kinda reaction to this game decosta had to the lost to tennessee and to the browns man this is not raven football
lol inc another 50 yard bomb by mahomes
we gotta get a td to keep this game competitive
too many fumbles and drops
welp
lmaooooooo im done

turning this one off good luck guys next week is a new week
ravens havent made me feel like this in a long time
and now the o line joins the circus
put this on the board with the titans and chargers games
why do all our high stakes games go the exact same way
ok if they can get a td before the half were done
wow
wow
yeah thats a hold
out coached
why were still here just to suffer
what an absolute joke we are im embarrassed i even thought we have a chance
no replay no review
learn how to fucking tackle
you build a good football team from the lines out and we are losing in the trenches on both sides of the ball
they have free runners on every play
at least now its a full team failure
how many times do we get hands on the qb and dont bring him down jesus fucking christ

itd be great if a pass rusher could actually tackle mahomes instead of grabbing at his shoulder
kill me only like 2 people came to play everybody else is asleep
martindale is getting straight up punked
judon is so ass why havent we traded him yet
pass rush is just ass
were just lucky he dropped that
oof just turned on the game were not looking great
bring the house and still cant get a sack
that christ humphrey was there
its almost like thats why you dont blitz 44
how many sacks are they going to whiff wheres the physicality weak
lucky so so gd lucky
at least the gif war was fun to watch
fuck these commentators so annoying
this team still cant play from behind nothing has changed from last year except the secondary has gotten worse
man what the fuck
at least we won the kicker wars
the defence has been bad but the offence has been worse
has anyone played well dear me this is dreadful
he aint no tucker
best kicker in the league fuck off tony romo
defense must be like when the hell will it be halftime lol
tony romo curse
why the fuck does mahomes have like 3 wide open receivers every play
look at that protection man why cant we have that
hey at least we know tucker is the better kicker
at least tucker reigns supreme
lol ar least buttlicker sucks
wow just wow
at least butker is making me smile tonight
so 3710 by the time we see the ball again
were fortunate butker has had a horrible night
throw a bomb
man this chiefs kicker kinda sucks
well at least its week 3 gotta make improvements got cap room
we have to score a lot of points and have our defense give up none better be a hell of a haltime speech
i love deshon and chuck but you simply cant walk 2 strong safeties out there against mahomes and not expect to get fucking bombed lol
simply cant believe this and yet i believe it
that last pass is this game
at least we are winning the kicker battle
kinda reminds me of that game a few years ago when peyton manning murdered us with 5 tds really hoping we can pull a miracle out of our asses this time
justin tucker ftw
wtf was that throw

and another drop by andrews
its fucking embarrassing
and andrews dropped another pass
great hands guys
story of the first half there abysmal
absolutely no pass rush for the past 5 years now and im fucking sick of it
jesus fucking christ can we catch one god damn pass
big game andrews
hopefully this puts a fire under our team
what the fuck are these plays couldnt even get a completion lmao
i think our receivers put baby oil on their gloves before a big game
we are not ready for the big one yet guys
that last play pretty much sums up this entire game
everyone but the wolfpack gets a paddling
fitting end to the half
its just getting ridiculous cant even make 5 yard throws underneath
welp 3 score game ladies and gents
jesus christ they did the same exact shit against the titans where they get behind and then they start passing and their offense goes to shit greg romans has to go if he is going to keep doing this shit
watch our boys will come from behind and win and that narrative will go away
well we look like a joke
play calling has been atrocious and the moment just feels too big for this team really hoping we put up a fight this second half and show some heart
fuuuuuuuuck man fuck
someone needs to get in romans ear pressure passing downs are not our thing maybe if we had a better oline lamar is off tonight but he can still run do that it would be better
boomer looks like ernest borgnine
i need more beer
we need a real miracle comeback here if the defense can get mahomes number and get 3 and outs we could run the ball and grind out some points
we just cant get anything going we need to learn to play from behind
guys guys guys what if there was a miracle just like michael vick and the miracle at the new meadowlands
am i watching the same game as my friend is because i sure havent seen all this pressure and slowdowns on my homes that hes talking about and all this pressure that judon and his highlevel play is currently happening someone tell me if im being wrong here but i have to think my friend has lost his mind a little bit
what would you give if tomorrow wasnt promised
if the defense can get a early stop or turnover on the opening drive maybe things can improve but obviously a chiefs td is pretty much game over
our first half effort reminded me of that song from hamilton

outgunned
outmanned
outnumbered
outplanned

why are we regularly exposed against great teams
we drafted patrick queen for coverage smh
you know what

im glad that this is happening
we need to play zone cover 3 thats the best way to play mahomes he eats up man to man against the blitz they know we are gonna blitz so switch it up dont be predictable
might as well rush 1
queen bruh
patrick queen ran down hill impressive
and it begins again
bullshit
down and distance is just completely meaningless they can get a 1st down at will
we better not sign judon
judon is just so frustrating to watch
queen
our entire team is playing like trash lamar shouldnt be getting the brunt of it were being dominated at every level
honestly its beautiful how effortless mahomes makes these passes look
that qas the shirt not the name plate
oh look more penalties for the team up 3 scores
that is an awful fucking flag fuck the score
bs call
can we penalize a referee
thts a good tackle
matt judon really is a waste of 17 mill great personality on the team but we need something else from the pass rush
kansas city can do what ever they want

stfu dork
bs penalties
im glad im wearing a mask so my colleagues cant see on my face how disappointed i am
he was literally holding the nameplate
how the fuck is that a horse collar
bullshit call
these refs are awfull
and fuck these god damn refs
right now mahomes is so hot he could have a blindfold in and finish the game throwing for 500 yards 89 completion and 9 touchdowns
lmao bullshit call
are you kidding
this is so fucking embarrassing
now theyre just fuckin with us
horseshit
lets go trusssssss

just have to do something with it now
its something
hey we caught a break
if we dont score here so help us god
right where we want them
gotta score here got a break lfg
yessir
back in business
we needed that
oh shit nevermind im staying up
chuck clark
refs gonna take this back
lets just get a nice drive going
this happens every time a game like this happens to us something happens that makes us get hope and it doesnt matter
that might be a game changer just maybe
lets go chuck
td here and its a ten point game against that offense it wont be easy but we can do that just gotta pray romans halftime adjustments get the job done
dont piss away this possession
if we score here we are fucking back in it boys
come on lamar i have faith in you lets fucking do it
why not lets go
i think all the trolls are gone yall
dude what is gro doing
roman run the ball
that play makes me wanna puke
bruh i missed the start of the second half lmao
runs dont exist super bowl is an illusion
run it
run the ball
run the ball

down but you can run the ball and still be in this game
good playcalling

very aggressive way to try to get back in the game
any 4th and short has to be a go now
lmao waste of a drive
roman play calling like a d2 coach vs alabama
need to snap the fucking ball there
run the fucking ball
cant wait for a greg roman fullback sweep bullshit on 3rd and 1
we look like a high school team lmao this is even more embarrassing then the titans game
this is as pathetic a showing as ive ever seen
lol we are embarrassing ourselves right now
did we just false start away the offsides absolute horse shit discipline
did they go to the club why are they so sloppy xd
lol this team is 100 off
we cant even snap the ball properly
wut
what the fuck
ive never heard of that penalty lol
well its a 1st downs a starti guess
oh hey a 1st down
a first down do my eyes deceive me xd
stop with the throwing
god damn this is the worst ive seen this team since lamar took over
holy hell gus edwards is in the game
anyone elses butthole go clench mode on that deep toss
what is this obsession with gus edwards could have used that pick for someone that actually plays
brown running back scared tf out of me lol
move those chains

move those chains

move those chains
never seen a team so unprepared for a game in a long time team seemed like they were on their high horse after beating 2 shit teams news flash u arent as good as you think u r
dive for it jfc
run it omg
thats it keep it coming
thank god
we gotta score asap kc is a fast offense and theyre gonna get another td to clinch the win if we dont score soon
how is that not a flag for the hit on dobbins
if he stays in he scores
lamar takeover starts now
thank god were finally running it
yes gus yes greg roman
the crowd was louder for cehs 1 yard run
almost had brown there for a td
there u fucking go lamar
lamar is getting back into his comfort zone i hope
where is the up tempo come on mix it up get in a rhythm
seeing gus run literally cures my depression
do a little tempo
roman oh wait we have a bus
big guss
run the ball
team non hyphenated edwards
why wasnt this the plan from the start sometimes i do wonder
lmao their dlines getting chippy
ive been saying it all game long go back to the run
this sub wants gus gone and honestly hes our best back imo
i swear if we ran gus every play wed score every drive
greg roman was probably so drunk he forgot gus existed until the second half
would you look at that when the ravens run good stuff happens
completely different team i would love to know what harbaugh said to them in that locker room
yes keep running
its almost like running the ball works
feed him
an offensive linemen blocking without holding the chiefs are shook
fucking thank you
thank you gus
i want to see more of gus and dobbins
i think we should go into nohuddle
seem like we could be a running team
fuck it just let lamar be a running back for the rest of the game
blatant holding there 79
had to give kc the confidence just to take it away and crush em
wtf is with andrews today
what is wrong with andrews tonight wtf
epic bum
oh no
run the ball keep time of possession thats how we won games all of last year
kill me
who chopped off mark andrewss hands today
okay if im worried about anyone in big games its mandrews what the hell
mandrews is killing me
catch the fucking ball

wholly fucking shit
mandrews wtf is going on
id appreciate if the announcers would quit crushing on mahomes everytime the ravens actually do something good
andrews shitting the fuck out the bed tonight
fuck you andrews this is why youre not on kittle or kelces level
you have to catch that theres no excuse when you get both hands in it in the nfl
they need to go for it
id appreciate if the announcers would quit crushing on mahomes everytime the ravens actually do something good
andrews chokes every primetime game
field goals arent going to win this go for it
catch the fucking ball andrews
fuck it go for it
this isnt andrews night
wtf andrews
a moment of silence for the 4th
what the fuck is going on with mandrews thats his 3rd drop tonight
youre trash mark
why do we forget how to catch in big games
drop drop drop drop drop drop
wow
told yall to be wuiet
levey the worst play by play guy
where is mark andrews and who is this imposter
two hands
damn zeus
orlando are you fucking kidding me
wild cat on 4th plz lol
atleast tucker shows up as usual
about the only player that showed up for us tonight
hitting fgs consistently isnt for everyone i guess
to be honest im glad of the false start and the safe points instead of a turnover on downs
for the sake of my sanity im going to imagine that we wouldve have converted there so now we get 3 points
at least one thing doesnt change tucker is the goat
this line is offensive
i think were missing hurst quite a bit
wow andrews and brown just look totally different this game definitely need to develop more targets for times like this duvernay and boykin come to mind
when we lose andrews dropping the pass is a very very common occurrence and its very troubling
what went right that series running the ball what went wrong that series passing the ball
i want mandrews back c
does anyone have the video of the andrews dropped catch over the middle
these announcers are fucking awful they get so many names wrong and dont know wtf theyre talking about
justin top scored for the whole team tucker
i bet 50 on this game lmao
so is andrews the blame of the game at this point out of her just in the talk for it
we cannot rely on our defense to keep getting stops the chiefs are going to score more points
gonna get a pick here
one thing im picking up on is that we arent threatening downfield early and thats an issue confusing them on the run worked sure but they expect that

i say frighten them first with slants and sticks because some of those are bound to work and keep them on their toes then you can hit them with the options and pas and screens but we well be lucky to come away with a w or learn anything from this
lot of game left its going to come down to wink
we need a pick 6 mp juiceman marlon anyone
i dont know who needs to hear this jk its wink why are we playing so far off
its reassuring that the defense still cant cover
does mp understand were playing a football game
juice man has spilled his oj
this fucking sucks lamar shits the bed mahomes does outstanding mandrews really shits the bed kelce looks great
is peters unable to cover a reciever closer than 10 yards
insert always sunny from philadelphia conspiracy meme
tyus bowser dropping straight to his knees like this is peewee dude cannot tackle in this league
queen is finally looking like a true rookie
press coverage plz

way to go d
yuuuuge stop
defense is fucking back baby
yes
the occasional game like this where andrews cant catch for shit just completely dismantles the offense beyond repair

hes far too important to do this
lets go
now that is some defense lets gooooooooo
lets fffcckinnn goooo get that touchdown o
there we go defense
nice 4th down stuff
thats huge we have a chancem
please offense do something with it
also i take back questioning their decision not to go for it im so flustered and cranky right now like you wouldnt believe xd
alright now just dont throw to andrews
this is their opportunity to get back in this get 7 and its a one possession game
wheres my purple dick guy

get ready
just score goddammit just score
wolfieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
could you imagine
need a td nothing else
the offseason acquisitions of campbell and wolfe came up huge on that 4th down stop
here we go two tds lamartwo time for the boys to make up for all the drops and misses
at least something is going right right now
was looking for lj fort a few min ago glad we had him in he makes plays gotta have veteran presence out there
i am asking this genuinely why do you guys think our guys cant catch in big games is it nerves its just strange
chiefs shouldve passed on 3rd and 4th and short our run d looks fine but we cant stop the pass at all
andrews better make up for it now
if andrews could catch this would be a very different game right now
these roll outs just shorten the field if you throw throw from the pocket
tackled him up high but alright
run the bus
gus
gus the bus
gussssss
gus the motherfucking bus
gusbus lets go
god i love gus
keep giving it to gus
its kind of crazy to think that itll only be a one score game if they td here
thank you gus
you cant stop the bus
the gus bus baby
keep feeding the bus
im literally going to ask gus edwards to marry me
gus bus woo woo
tha wheels on tha bus go round and round
gus busssss
gusss the busssssss
up the tempo man we gotta score before the 4th
oh my god running works
anyone peep lamar with that basketball hesitation move
please get a td
gus bus
if only we ran the ball in the first half
gussss
gus the bussss
run the damn ball
keep doing it
for real pay gus edwards we gotta go power run as a our 1
beep beep
it just feels like too much to ask for two stops in a row but we got ourselves into this mess
gus is the best pure runner we have
i love football so much but it makes me a glass case of emotions
hand it to gus bus next play he is the reason were in this
boyle thank you
we got a game
touchdown ravens
we never went away bitch
boylelets fucking go
were in this game one stop
lets goooooooooo
boyle snatchin that ball
tes can catch a pass since when was this allowed
great catch by boyle
nick boyle is new best friend
oh my gosh o

well mutha flocka
boyle lol
ayy ud represent
im fucking jumping
step up defense
please
come on defense we need a huge play
it would be fucking boyle hahahahaha yes my mayne
mahomes is good but honestly im different
wooooo ric flair voice
deep breath
thats what you like to fucking see a bit of fight after showing none of that in the first half
get ready to show the d no wait stop the ball
come on defense dont let them break my heart again lets gooo
defense do yo thang
people are really acting like andrews sucks because he dropped a ball and got to bad ones thrown to him
lets get 3 turnovers in a row pl0x
mahomes ready to fuck it and chuck it safeties need to get on their shit
lotta time left
aint nobody telling me there is no such thing as momentum better play playcalling better execution suddenly passes get caught
power went out in my neighborhoodbut im loving this new life carry on for me flock
boyle showing up after that bs tripping call on him
more steam lets go
get stop plz pretty plz
can we get the ball guy catching kickoffs on offense
how is watkins allowed to block before they make the catch
wolfe showed up to fucking play
please stop them here
please get a turnover d
i just want some fruit punch homies
please get the stop
stop here plz
not even covered pathetic
hehehe were in danger
what the fuuuuuck smith
that was a perfect call for that d not even a misplay
mahomes is too good to keep blitzing
can we stop blitzing 6 people
can we not run alongside a guy for 5 yards before tackling
why does chuck have to sprint across the field to get to his assignment
yeah maybe blitz not every single fucking down
fucking judon again
allah akbar
ceh is a wr we need to start treating him like one
we need to get a turnover asap
we need to stop blitzing
mahomes is something special
basically if youre gonna blitz you gotta make the play sometimes
god mahomes is just too good like it doesnt matter what the d does he just gets off this is so tough i didnt expect a win tonight
oh my god bowser was a half a step late

god damn it
man we had him there

a step too slow
once again what is this bullshit play calling
id love a turnover but could we please get a sack
ravens defense and near sacks name a more iconic duo
come on defense
so just zero ravens on that side of the field cool
our qb contain is non existant
he was staring at averette that entire play lol good d
stop blitzing
fuck
this fucking defensive line is getting abused
marlon humphries
play zone god damn it
aaaaaaah
all i see is green no pass rush at all
didnt even pretend to contain him
i love this defense but wink is a fucking bum the way he calls plays against this team every fucking time
i dont wanna see one more fucking blitz this entire game jesus christ
i just want this bitch to get sacked one fuckin time man
one dimensional defense i saw that outcome 2 minutes ago
they just eating up clock
worst 3rd down d calls ive ever seennn
he keeps getting these little jogs for a first wtf
holy fucking shit stop fucking blitzing
at this point the chiefs could all close their eyes and get a 1st down on this defense
this is some impressively bad playcalling
clock is running here
we need some luck
our defense has been pathetic tonight
how many sax we have boyzzzz judon poopoo
we need a forced fumble rn
call him pat
pass rush non existant
no pass rush
wide open as always
theyre clowning us
embarrassing fuck this fuck this fuck this fuck this
oh fuck me
are we no good at playing man defense
you already know edc gettin some pass rushers
who was fucking guarding him
defense just got embarrassed on that drive
fucking defense thanks so much
their offensive line catching td passes we cooked
they make us look terrible
they really using every trick play against us shades of the titans last year
this commercial for ted lasso got me convinced that we have a soccer coach pretending to be greg roman right now
the chiefs offense screen to the te screens to the fb passes to the wrs behind the sticks passes to the te passes to the offensive linemen the occasional deep pass when youre so exhausted with defending the shit behind the sticks
alright judon were gonna have to take you off the line were putting boyle in instead
fuck getting another commercial in between kickoff and first play
do they ever throw 5 yards beyond the los
reminder that it is the 4th quarter and lamar has 62 passing yards
lmao ingram was called edwards again
sure is a lot of discussion for a penalty on the chiefs that shit gets called with no review for us
now is when he refs make up for the rest of the game when its too late
terrible throw omfg
underthrew that badly
that was a td atrocious throw
just not a great throw
man i love lamar but people are right his outside game is not good
now they wanna give us bullshit calls when the game is fucked fuck you zebras
find out why ward is a db and not a receiver
that should have been a pick
passing game is weak on both ends lamar and the recievers
the refs feel like they are paid to make sure the game is close
now thats a bad throw no denying it should have been a td
one time a receiver gets some separation lamar shanks it ouch
people think lamars skips are show boating but they are just a way to add to a juke
another missed throw was it hollywoods fault again
boykin 1 sec longer on that block bruh
thank you for having hands dobbins
hey andrews held on to one
someone tell roman that this is fine
chiefs spamming engage eight
where the fuck were these hands earlier
hey look andrews caught one
i really like how the ravens are utilizing jk dobbins as a receiver with those slant routes its something that can be built upon as the season progresses
jackson just got lost on that play
god our o line is so weak
hey andrews caught it
that stinks
lamar didnt even look to pass there
this ol is garbageeeeeee
oh ffs you cannot take that sack there
gotta go quick
mandrews caught one
what if this fucking offensive line doing
this is beyond embarrassing
lmao two straight sacks dude its over
louis riddick is in my head dude
back to back horrible plays by lamar
wrong way lamar
wtf is this playcalling they blitzed every down
so fucking embarrassing
what are we even doing now
jackson what the fuck dude
welp onto the next one
joke
wow game over
game over
thats the game
need to step up there no scramble outside
well this has been fun
lamar missed that throw by 5 yards
everybody played terrible this game everyone
at least they didnt get my hopes us just to let mahomes score in 2 seconds
yeah this aint it
we will get them next time boys we had a little life there for a minute but to little to late
probably gg need some crazy collapse
anyone else see that weird ass comercial
i can at least take solace that we didnt have any major injuries
god damn i picked you guys to win as a steelers fan frig
we played kinda bad tonight id rather take this loss now and learn from it to hopefully be better in the playoffs
rat bastard play calling
lets keep blitzing thats worked all night long
97 fucking yards passing
nothing worked us tonight
can we not get a fucking stop on 3rd down
maybe dont go out on a fucking boat partying the whole fucking day before a game
holy shit pats stats god damn
cracking a beer in solemn sadness go ravens see ya next week
griese makes my ears bleed holy shit
cowardly call
i think its time we bench ingram let dobbins have some time because ingram is doing jack shit
we playin like hell lamar got jitters or something we should be losing but fck these refs theyve changed the game and sunk us more that tripping call killed what might have been a productive early drive and mahomes last td pass had the most blatant no call on a hold on b will ive ever seen making this not fun to watch im fine losing to the chiefs but at least make it fair
guys im from brazil you understand when i say this reminds me of the 7x1
honestly the defense didnt even do that bad against these fuckers the offense couldnt do shit
this game felt like a tinder fat fish she invites you to her crib you realize she is way heavier and the whole time youre contemplating if you gonna tap that or not but you tap it anyway and you feel so disgusted the next day
can i just take this commercial break to say how thrilled i am by the antitrump energy in here gives me hope that we might not go full fascist just please go vote
im sorry but lamar isnt in the same league as mahomes after tonight
obligatory fuck tyreek hill
yump this shit is fuckin curtains topkek
lol i knew all the announcers picking us meant wed shit the bed
dog im not american right

at first i thought wtf is this commercial

but the president of brazil was elected exactly this same way what rhe hell biden is not socialist
greg roman has to go now if the chiefs score we will not have 10 more rushes this game
deshon is out of position every play
i forgot how good pat mahomes is theres only so much the defense can do
this is embarrassing
say what you want about flacco at least the man showed up on prime time
hahahahahahahahahahaha
yall need to chill out
whats on netflix
every game lamar has played against the chiefs he has looked worse and worse
hang on a little bit longer guys lamars gonna make something happen just hang on a bit longer
ok boys buckle up we got them right where we want them
lets go i toldyall fairweathers to get out
x200b

lamar jackson has 62 passing yards to mahomes 319 passing yards
number one defense
theyve been holding the whole fucking game

ive had it yea they called that one but thats only cuz the helmet came off complete bullshit calls this whole game
inept passing game if lamar throws a catchable ball there miles has a shot at a td if he throws a catchable to hollywood down the right sideline td instead no points

the passing game has been bad but lamar has been just as bad just being honest
safety cant even stop him from getting the first i miss having a real safety
sign ab im not even joking
ok lets put flacco in
truth time lamar is still not making good throws

in addition to at least 2 1st down plays due to throwing behind we missed 2 tds one was a really low and out of range lob to andrews that he wasnt able to one hand and the other was a bonafide td run by brown that was thrown so far behind him were lucky it wasnt intercepted

lamar has come a long way yes but tonight the passing game was horrendous and lamar has to own that
chiefs fan

may the best team win
run dat ball
lamar proving right off the bat hes going to exploit that defense all night
kc got away with def pi
a little bit of pass interference is alright fuck off
awesome pitch
omfg that pitch lmaoo
nice to see all the couch offensive coordinators coming out the woodwork
hollywoods drop reminded me that our wideouts are shaky in big games
doesnt matter what the offense does if we cant stop them in offense its pointless
flag on a batted ball
it was at his fuckinh waist are you serious
adjustments are needed
is what it is get one back
where the fuck is the defense today
tucker goat
well that settles the kicker convo
hahahaha


lol at other teams that dont have tucker
lol goat kicker
thought someone got a hand on it
tucker best kicker
refball

what the fuck
this oline will be the down fall of this team
were down 3 against the super bowl champs yall gotta chill im sure theres a good handful of trolls in here too
why are we getting fancy too that play to duvernay is just dumb run the damn ball
best refs pursed lips gif here
all this experience and two shitty calls already
that tripping pen was the most dogshit call ive ever seen
first drive went well but we coped out of going for it and the second drive got refballed
were down one score against the chiefs you guys need to relax
idk why we abandoned the run in our first red zone trip
i think its more impressive that warner did it in 36 games back in the late 90s
they are seriously embarrassing us again
peters giveth and peters taketh away
i know we have a wellregarded defense but jesus its been weak these last 3 games too many weak links and liabilities are gonna cost us wins
remember what happened last year when we got embarrassed early we went on a great streak
i dont care that its only week three super bowl winning teams come prepared on week 3
newfans sweating rn
that was a great throw
poor hollywood thrown around like a pin ball
this offends is looking like straight trash
lot of drops tonight not a good sign
drops killed us against the titans too
even if hollywood caught that hes well short and about to get lit up whats up with the play calling i feel like harbaugh always has the worst game plans for prime time games always gets outcoached
anyone else catch ozzie pull his mask up when he realized the cameras were on him lmao thats all of us in public
offense looks like shit defense looks like shit we should be getting blown out
that wasnt a hold
that was perfect timing fuck these refs
not an offside but go off i guess
jesus christ refs call a fucking hold
fuck off judon
i saw some holding on the line
no hold on that one i guess
yea just let them hold
how fucking bad is this secondary today
marcus peters looks like the toast i left in the oven
he does more than rush the passer a ravens fan who doesnt know football explaining to me why we should keep judon
refs dont call holding this year tj watt was held all day during texans and nothing
mahomes escapes the rush while two are holding wolfe then the refa bail them out again with a non existent offside then they score a td gotta love the sequence
what is lamars line right now 4 of 6 for what 40 yards this chiefs defense is not elite roman shitting the bed in another big game
this is not a good defense

wake the fuck up
feels like flacco era
would be cool if we made it competitive at least
guys i think the problem is we looked past the chiefs to the big game against the washington footballers next week
we fucking suck tonight lolbad
did we swap places with the jets or something
is this what it feels like to be a vikings fan good but not good enough
trash defense
oh come on guys stop being negative we are only down 2 scores to the chiefs and both sides of the ball look like hot garbage but stop being negative youre bad fans

maybe this is why sf dumped roman
de costa better be on the phone with abs agent right now
earl thomas would have been nice right about now
jesus fucking christ bottom 5 defense 3rd and 14 wide open we need a new defense
judon sucking per usual
well i dont see any reason to watch the rest of this shit showall you idiots talking this fair weather fan shit are just that were playing like absolute shit right now on all fronts
lmaooooo butker still trash at least
i vote that we take all players out except the kickers and just have them see who kicks better
at least weve found out who the real goat is
its game 3 yall and weve had our most glory as a team that played week 1 in the playoffs not as a bye team perspective
well at least we know tucker is better than buckner

not that there was any question about that
somehow ravens will get flagged during halftime
christ take a fucking knee end this shit and dont bother coming out again
no pressure and lj still misses aint his night
andy reid hates that harbs got a ring first so he always brings it
lol even when lamar is able to get a clean pass the players drop it i wonder how hed play with the chiefs receiving core
someone needs to start breaking shit in the locker room whooping some ass gettin in peoples faces
fuck it hurts to be a ravens fan
who do we want ed dickson
when do we want him now
our recievers shrink in big games man
reminder that they get the ball at the half gg
not even watching the game anymore im just treating this as a post game thread
everyone gonna count us out and we finally gonna be underdogs again
im really about to just watch hockey for the second half
its week 3
lamar cant throw when its these kind of games has to be in the system and play designs cant expect him to go west coast oh well
the chiefs are christian gray and the ravens are anastasia yall can take what you will with that one
i want 52 and ozzy to walk into that locker room at halftime and start calling out players and coaches
horse collar from the middle back lmao ridiculous
weve had some weird ass calls against us this game
bullshit call
not a horsecollar how does the nfl justify this fucking shit
1 good play after getting our ass handed to us for 2 straight quarters


that helps but still doesnt feel good as it looked like the chiefs woulda scored there too
all the bandwagons went to sleep time for the real show
did we trade the wrong te
can we trade back for hurst
when it rains it pours
offense just cant get it together
fucking pathetic mental edge
choke artists all of them except for special teams
gus is out best rb
another fucking time because it seems like hes learning run the ball
didnt lamar just go out of bounds how did the quarter end
we need a stop asap kc offense is too fast and if they get another td its over

stop blitzing mahomes its clearly not working pressure the receivers so kc cant keep tearing up field so quickly slow em down and get in their heads well prob lose but at least this way it could be close
can i sub ray lewis in his prime for matt judon or
this game feels like the inverse of the 2014 patriots playoff game
better coverage and qb spy might have done it
chargers took kc to ot
the tampa bay lightning have won the stanley cup
teams have so much fun against us when it matters i feel like a punching bag
why cant we use dobbins more
is it weird that my mind goes to ray rice everytime i see jk dobbins wearing 27
lamar is playing like a rookie not an mvp
lamar getting embarrassed in big games is becoming fucking clockwork at this point
wtf was that brown
just when i though we hit bottom damn that drive was embarrassing
south park special looks good tho

lmao seen some asshole wanting et3 back
okay so who wants the karma in the blame of the game for saying coachingmandrewsolinedefense
anyone want an eclair
if kc scores a touchdown here we could be in trouble
games over pack it up boys s
chiefs fan coming in peace judon wasnt offsides he timed that perfect
enough with the fake fan shit i been watching since forever this performance is pathetic
mahomes just displaying why hes the best in the league unreal talent
removed

without their kickers mishap and that fluke return td we would be 313 jesus
absolutely fucking pathetic

this team is charmin soft against any team worth a damn
did lamar lose a step i dont know but when 2 guys are running full speed at lamar from the time the ball is snapped i dont know what you expect to happen

the pass pro has been subpar so far

this game is already over
wonder if belichick really did let us have that sunday night game last year
legit kc gonna win every he they want to this year

for sure weve made plenty of mistakes but they are also a better team straight up maybe the best team ever
damn lamar just said something cant win the big game if you read his lips

sign ab
lets not insult the word rivalry the chiefs own us
here come the refs
clyde blocking downfield before mahomes crosses the line of scrimmage swallow the whistle harder refs
so much for the so called best kicker in football
lbs are a liability on this team
we have 7 passing yards refs suck but theyre not to blame for why were losing right now
this shit is embarrassing even when we werent a great team we always showed up for big games idk what happened to harbaugh but the entire team just isnt there for them anymore
guys relax if everyone else in the league can make a big comeback we can to it will be alright its just game 3 breathe yall
bandwagons out positivity back in lads lets go
mahomes is something special
i have zero confidence in a lamar jackson lead offense to come from behind and win this i feel bad saying that but they have yet to do it
would rather take a ass whooping to them now then in the playoffs its whatevs we got time to sharpen up boys hopefully they just go out and compete to win the second half
look these regular season games mean nothing anyways but now at least we get to see the one thing lamar has left to do throw the ball every down and show he can come back from a deficit even if we dont win this game if lamar can show capability to make a game like this close then i will be satisfied
boomer is so annoying my god
okay i can see yall didnt like the ab idea lol
jesus that was a bad play call he was double covered lucky he got the catch
lmao i turned the game off thinking it was over decided that life was pain and i should tough through the blowout and now the games close should i turn it back off
jfc lamar jackson is 1122 with 62 yards this has to be one of the worst statistical games of his career and its against a defense that isnt that good thats pretty concerning even with andrews shitting the bed
legit we should trade for jj watt
lamar is 1528 98 yards
i come in peace i still say this is a preview of the afc championship game well see you guys again in the playoffs
harbaugh chocked as well
greg roman is shit during big games fire him
this game sucks and all yeah but if youre about to get all whiny and negative in here youd probably fit in better in rsteelers anyway

lets not be about that here
lamar has looked like trash in every big game weve had
fucking greg roman man hes the biggest choker on this damn team
this game does not look competitive at all the defense is playing soft and lost af and the offense is looking the worst theyve looked all season i was worried after last week against houston because i really didnt think lamar played well last week but houston just couldnt beat our d this week is confirming my fear the tackling is terrible and the offensive line play is shit its nothing like last season so far
lamar is not throwing well our defence cannot get a stop and andrews cannot catch anything

doesnt look like we will win this
this is horrid go get em next sunday jesus christ hopefully this is a wake up call
lamar has a problem showing up in big games i got flamed for saying it after the titans game but its an actual issue
151 aint even that bad though frfr
i want both our offensive and defensive coordinators out please
its actually embarrassing that the chargers with a rookie qb gave them a tougher game than we did with the reigning mvp
bruh wtf is up with our defense this year
can we chill w the hot takes for one week good lord its a shit game in general it happens
this game is on wink and lamar
gg ravens may we meet again in the playoffs i mean that sincerely
we dont look ready yet again
cant wait for tomorrow and all week threads whining were better than this when we are not

we do not have a pass rush we do not have good and consistent pads protection we play players last their prime like ingram instead of gus edwards

i love harbs but this shit happens in 2012 and he had balls to make a move most likely because ray and ed reed noticed the shit

we need vocal leadership not this hype bullshit

i want a mean ravens team not pussy tik tok hype
removed

the ravens are chokers 100
fuck you roman

if we just ran the ball in the 1st half we wouldnt be in a hole the rest of the game were a running team with a weak o line just run the damn ball and we couldve had a chance
lamar playing like trash today
jesus christ yall suck we can get blown out in this game and that doesnt invalidate everything about this team we were 22 last year and won 12 straight sometimes shit goes wrong on the football field were not just all of a sudden some terrible football team

why are you guys in poland and netherlands i have t left the area in years lol

mo in the endzone
good luck tonight bird bros
nom nom nom
llamaa
yea lamaaa
oyez
that boi fast
that hit was late af
lamar doing his thing im ready
that tackle scared the shit outta me
lamar

lamborghini
lol dpi
fumble jk
wtf did i just watch was that design
nice pitch
was that actually the play design
didnt think he was going to get that good work boys
i love markbut damn im loving dobbins
pound that rock
god damn i picked the wrong time to quit smoking and drinking lol
points are points yah we could have gone for it but if we dont convert thats a wasted drive
here we go shit
yaaaaas queen
we really gonna be our own worst enemy tonight huh
not like this refs
what a shit hands to face call lol
anyone else see that kc linemen on his ass on that last play
was our defense on the field i didnt see it
dammit we let this drive go waaaay too fast d needs to step tf up cuz they scored way too quickly
at least buttfucker missed
ok butker
butker tucker omegalul
ahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
ok i dont know what the overunder was but with that d showing i hope you took the over
hahahaha
welp this is going to be a shootout no more conservative plays please
well get that one back guys
i cannot phantom to lose to the chiefs 3 years in a row man
need a turnover here
all we want to make up for that bs call and the one on hollywood is just them to call the actual holding on the chiefs its all i request
this might get ugly fast
chargers fan here were rooting for you guys i believe in lj
116 combined seasons by refs how many tripping calls were made in that span mewonders
holy fuck can we finish a sack
something has to change are there any free agent coordinators we could use 2 s
ok armchair coaches tell me what we need to do rn
i think were getting exposed
this team needs to get punched in the mouth rather have it now than in the playoffs and they go into panic mode hopwfukly they can adjust and figure it out
that was dirty by judon
our lbs and interior o line is washed
well this is painful why does our d look so flat
oh geez hes just embarrassing our d
queen is getting exposed
andy reid is yawning on the sidelines

hes not even feeling challenged bored out of his mind
calm down everyone yeah we look like shit but this game is far from over gotta get the td this drive
get rid of judon now please
boy we needed that now why is moore wasting roster space
nobody can catch today i guess
good job refs
holding
we getting demolished right now had it not been for that duvernay return td this game would be a blowout
holding
peters looks like garbage tonight
12th man coming up huge for kc
oh wellrefs showed their hand early but our offense is dogshit tonight
chiefs are to the steelers as lamar is to joe lamar gonna get that signature 2011 1 minute drive to win the game tonight
are the espn sound effects driving anyone else crazy who decided static was a good sound effect
throw the ball to andrews
very bad throw
i fucking didnt get up at 2am to see that pathetic team
at least those of us that work early can get some sleep tonight lol
and thats it boys pack it up
catch the fucking ball
defense straight up doesnt care anymore frankly i dont think anyone cares they are just going through the motions
humiliating lol
note for the future
stay out of the game thread when losing see yall in the postgame thread hopefully with a w not giving up
entire team minus special teams look like they spent the whole week watching reddit gifs
cannot wait for deshone elliot to get cut
what a joke this game is over everyone of these guys should be ashamed of themselves
every fucking time
our team they just wasnt about this game if were lucky lamar will turn it on a bit and the game will be close like the last 2 lol
playing against the team that won the fucking superbowl and everyone is acting like we are losing to the browns
people saying earl thomas this earl thomas that yall act like he would of singly handedly stopped that
i just need lamar to ball out 2nd half i dont even care about the win anymore
has lamar only made like 2 passes this game i dont understand what changed from last week when he was damn near flawless
hope coach harbough beat their ass in the locker room
glad this embarrassing game came this early in the season we got work to do

were stil pretenders not contenders
can we win from behind

lets find out
we abandoned the run for drives two and three which i agree was stupid and awful but weve been forced to do so after that since the defense couldnt step up lamar being inaccurate nobody getting open drops receivers running into each other and the fumble killed the last few drives
llama jackson
if i were on washington id be shitting bricks our boys are going to be angry next week
last year in week 3 browns crushed us and we didnt lose a game for the rest of the year admittedly this feels different because we should be a more complete team now
our oline cant protect lamar has accuracy problems when he isnt playing confident frankly accuracy isnt his strength he has a lot of others to compensate not a hater you got to play to your strengths
lets go lets belee
ravens d coordinator makes no adjustments man fucking clown
how is that a horse collar
nice now we can go 3 and out s but only kinda sarcastic
man this ol is shit
please take ingram out and out dobbins in
yup this is just not our night cant catch a break because we are just off
lamar needs to take control of his team and be a leader they follow his lead and he looks dead
i just bet you he didnt step out
mark no handrews
bench andrews now
i think im just going to take myself to bed and hope i wake up to a miracle lol
hey its a 2 score game now buckle in
and people complain about the cowboys being boring to watch in prime time
falcons fan here honestly you guys are my second team but i gotta really ask why didnt you guys draft a wr
sign ab
this team is the biggest pretender in the league
our offense is finally ticking
down by 14 now lets try running it
why did the clock run he went out of bounds
first time they show ravens fans
come on judon time to eat
whos ready for some fuckery now by mahommes
what a fucking joke mahomes single handedly is putting up 400 yards on this defense our qb has what 100
holy fuck this is unfuckingreal already this team would be undefeated in the cfl since they forget nfl is 4 downs instead of 3
game is over after that
damn kc offense decided to stop fucking around and being cute now we cant stop them at all great
defense hasnt played well but it has been moreso schematic imo queen is one of the few that is genuinely having a bad day on that side of the ball

i wont blame the defense for any of this though this is on the passing game point blank roman lamar receivers those are the guys that get blame imo
rookie lbs gonna rookie lb
run the ball
its a fat guy touchdownnn
bad bad pass from lamar bad
lamar has had just as bad of a game as he did against the titans embarrassing and the trolls will be out for sure
goddo i need to drink the rest of the bottle now i still have a little hope left
lamar is making sam darnold look good this week
15 free fucking yards on a drop back you are fucking kidding me right you dont have the down field accuracy for that lamar
this oline is a piece of shit i cant believe we didnt address it better during the offseason im sorry but tyre is way too raw to be a starter

fluker hasnt done good either but ill give him a pass because as far as i know hes battling an injury
i dont think stanley is 20myr good i rather draft some oline and get some rushers
we need to draft linemen this coming year both sides of the ball
total team failure andrews drops 2 huge plays lamar not good coaching abysmal defense lost half the time burn the tape and reset time
it sucks to lose but well be back next week
couldnt even get up for this game the regular season seems so dull and empty i cant get excited for these games knowing that we could easily choke it away come playoff time
knee gutless
silver linings tonight
refs fucking us early tonight
fucking defense is so ass
butker vs tucker debate over
butker better than tucker btw
judon is playing like he wants to leave baltimore next year
its gonna be a red wine and system of a down kind of night
welp its gonna be that kinda night
one of these teams looks like real contenders this year
judon is terrible that is all
judon sure worth that franchise tag right now lol
peters getting roasted
kc the new patriots the crown jewels of the nfl gonna have to beat them and the refs
i dont mind losing to the chiefs because theyre a good team and as someone currently living in stl theyre the team all my friends support and my 2 but damn it i dont want it to happen in a way that has refs negating our good plays with bs penalties
yea our safeties are absolute shit
stupid ass gif wars too fuck every team i want my mean ravens d back not this soft pussy shit
this team looks clueless smh off to next game
lamar is having just as bad of a game as he did against the titans
its one bad game at the beginning of the season well be aight
is lamar jackson the clayton kershaw of football
lamar jackson

mark andrews is the biggest choker on the team
this game is just a disaster top to bottom tucker misses one by the end
we all know whats going to happen here we tie it up and kermit rips our heart out of our chest yes i hope this take ages poorly
hey all yall saying the defense is terrible what happens when the defense gets a turnover now what about a pick six were making them nervous now and thats part of the game so yall dumbasses who dont consider that at all look fuckin stupid
oline buns jackson buns wow
and we expect to beat this team in arrowhead come playoff times lol
dumbass really complaining for a flag when that would give us another shot
idk how this can get worse come playoffs but i feel like it will
lamar is a great athlete but his throwing needs to improve he wont lead us to the super bowl with his average throwing mechanics
honestly someone has to be fired or something this was an absolute joke of a game i get kc and mahomes are good and they are the better team but this was a fucking shambles and im angry as hell
this game was big because if lamar won it would prove he can handle big games but instead it proved he can we have time to prepare him but honestly if we keep playing like this we wont win a playoff game
tackling the legs is for pussies
sad fans on reddit gonna be l i t

lol gg ravens fans
one of the worst quarters of football in lamar era and only down 3 at least
pls stop them right here man offense needs to get back to running the ball they also need to stop calling designed runs for lamar dudes risking the football every single time
kelce is so much better than andrews
mp fucking us today
lamar ugly af
wow so were just booty good to know
lj misses another throw and were gonna blame anyone else
its the regular season everyone relax long season ahead ill take a lamar offense everyday over what we had before him
lamar just flat out bad tn
you guys need some receivers
shouldve kept et locker room chemistry doesnt mean much when youre losing
wtf is wrong with lamar man
jackson cant handle the pressure
orlando brown overrated as hell
the sky is falling in the 3rd game of the season if you fake fans dont want to be here bye you knew we werent going 160 rather get slapped in the face now on national tv than later hopefully it wakes them up
suicide prevention hotline for yall that need it

8002738255

im loving watching our offense but i really want to see how our defense does against them little worried about averret though
i love nick boyle
want lamar to alternate his cadence more
surprised we didnt go for it
ravens should go for it oh well tucker time
goat goat goat goat
what kind of play is that
truzz in the d
play dead before it even began

best kicker in league time tho
we got the llama runningpassing and the goat kicking what more could we need
easy money for justin kicker
how bout that pitch tho
just run the rock they dont want it
watching from my current home in choke central atlanta and am so happy proud and thankful this is my home team
hope our defense doesnt need to go through an adjustment period this week
not a fan of how that series ended two incompletes is fine but those were conservative like we didnt want lamar to make a mistake let the man cook
missed a huge opportunity to cease the momentum there i could have taken a shit in peace
is youtube tvs 2 day free trial cancelable before you have to pay 65 lol
wack
okay that run defense was sexy
like knife through butter
this sucks so far
defense is on its heels
we need to get hussey fired
ughhh i kinda forgot how good kc offense was
come on wrap the fuck up this d is sketchy
uh
does anyone know any websites streaming the game
welp
embarrassing
he missed it
ooooops
okay ill take that
that was too easy
broncosjets on thursday whats the ou going to be 27
not great by the defense but i still like the game plan

im not worried about the defense looking rusty on the first drive most defenses are and were playing the super bowl champs
this how you finish a drive
i stayed sober for this game tonight
ravens just need to pound the ball and run play action deep passes truzz
im calling a mp pick this game he almost got to the ball on that pass he gave up hell get there
cool deal
lets now pound the fucking rock
i hate how this ref talks
how did jackson find a seam there
refs just have a hard on giving us something so they toss the flags
flags flags flags
another flag
refs ffs bs
what the fuck
lol clearly they heard the threats in this thread to the refs family
the virgin face shield

the chad buff
jc
what
dawg this ref is killing us
here comes a flag on us
woooooow
weak af
wow justwow
tripping
two defenders just let lamar run right through em
oh now were calling offensive penalties
i saw zeke score a td with a guy blocking like that yesterday
refs been chill all year then come out of the woodwork just to fuck us in the ass
jesus christ can we not shoot ourselves in the foot fucking frustrating
yeah jon
tripping
fuck the refs
the refs clearly have their marching orders
come on refs
harbs going off lmaooo
weak
wtf
fenton oh jesus christ
aaaaaaaaaaaa
this is bad
ooh fucking boy
that was rough
we got this
fuck hussey
get a stop get the ball back and get back in rhythm
hope we get a make up call man tripping wtf man
from a 13 yard gain to 2nd and 20 fuck that tripping call man
lol these refs suck for all the experience they have
jesus lol what in the world
take a breath keep pounding the ball we just need a stop or two
fuckers cant even tackle now

nfl self promoting the refs like they werent paid to throw the game
elliott soft as hell
tbh fortunate forward progress call
elliott has to make that tackle
bless that false start
so cringe
lord
so cool
yeesh were losing the chess match bad so far
marlo
nice nice
defense looks figured out rn ughhhh hope we can find our footing
i miss the days we used to blast the wind out of people on defense
hump punch
wow
just got burned by andy reid
crappy defense
good play marlo
great hit
our defense kinda sucks
humph punched that one out too
stall this drive her and get points on the board next o drive and its gonna be fine
peanut humphrey
momentum shift
marlon punched the ball out while he blasted that guy into another dimension
guys i feel weird
there you go marlon
goddam it
mess with the hump get the stump or something like that
i dont feel like the chiefs are doing anything crazy our defense just looks lost
god that was a beautiful play gotta give andy reid props for that one damn
bowser what in the fuck
so close bowser
these guys cant even get a sack fuck
ah yes the classic missed sack
our pass rush is just sad
why is kelce sooooo open
faked screen went w the te down the seam
whats a fucking tackle
cant tackle and cant cover
since last week thats like the 5th missed sack
yeah lets leave travis kelce wide tf open goddamn
have to get convert pressures to sacks against this dude
t y u s

b o w s e r
d is showing the issues that were anticipated in preseason pass rush is mediocre lbs and safety inexperience
looks like theyre just plowing over all of our guys
i have faith but they are moving way too easily against us
bro we need stronger players who can thump and pressure mahomes
getting outcoached
we havent made mahomes throw literally anything that wasnt easy or wide open
good pressure again need to get to him though
theyre pulling out the entire fucking playbook
cant let that go away fucking garbage
fucking get him on the ground
oh my god
i was shouting get his ass all last week please dont make me do it this week
we need a turnover
lol this is exactly what steelers felt like playing the patriots for like 10 straight years
these quick shots just eating us
this might get ugly
take him down b1tch
im going to scream
put someone on kelce maybe
finish the tackles jesus
oh so were playing like scrubs huh no wrapping up no sacks got it
defense not playing well
i get that they have a lot of speed but we need to play more up on them
cowards
whats up guys just tuned in how we doing
b i g b o i
finally stopped a screen
thank you
even if we win this game it was obvious itd be close we really need to make a trade on a pass rusher usually i like the mantra of more picks but its clear we have a major weakness and that is keeping us from being an sb caliber team need complete team not just overpowered offense
still got truzzz
protec u our home
who was it that mahomes just shook off with ease bowser
2nd quarter push lamar has had plenty of games where he lights up in a matter of two minutes
too many penalties too few deep balls to hollywood
for the love of god stop them
can we please stop blitzing
we have no answers
no
guys are wide open smh the coverage is way too damn loose
god damn it peters
cant stop shit on third down
fuck are we looking clueless
giving them like an 8 yard cushion
we done
why was no one within 15 yards of a receiver
i dont think weve ever stopped them on a 3rd down the past 3 games
sweet push off
oh cool none of our backers knew their assignment on that blitz fantastic
whats up with that push off
fuck i jwu sorry ravens flock tuning in immediately
push off like shit
we have absolutely abysmal pass rush
welp
wow peters getting smoked again
juiceman needs some more ju ice right now
we cant get pressure also the problem

we literally have not mahomes throw anything that wasnt easy or wide open
need to stop em here
big play here
dang
what in gods name was that
this is so frustrating i took work off for this
getting screened to death
i swear to god im gonna lose my hair watching the ravens and maryland basketball
theyre making pass plays into run plays
uh oh its the dreaded 10 point deficit

well this is fun
offense will get going but for all that is holy stop playing zone
queen out there looking like a true rookie
our play calling in big games still suspect our defense in big games still suspect uh oh i smell another decosta rework coming
sandra bullock in the blind side enters the chat run the dang ball

theres nothing i hate more than teams that completely blow out bad teams with needless points overkilling the score only for then to play like utter crap once they play an actual good team
oh maaab
lets fucking go
just what we needed
i am speed
awaiting the inevitable bs flag that reverses the td
butker is playing terribly tonight
that was the fire we needed hopefully the d will pick up
good ol justin kicker
im gonna go sicko mode
hopefully that lights a fire under the defense
lfg
great now the d doesnt rest fuck lol but redemption from duvernay
lets goooo


d gonna be tired as fuck though
lol justin kicker
the return of justin kicker
please let that serve as a wake up call to the rest of the team
yeeeeee
lets go defense
i know it wont be easy against the chiefs but ravens needs to tighten up that defense
hopefully that lit a fire under the defenses ass get a stop or turnover on this series and were in business
love the smile hope we keep duv for a while
thats it pump that energy into the defense veins
duve was lightning quick there
the former special teams coordinator is showing off for his old head coach
now we gotta stop mahomes fuck me
runs the field has to get back on the field to cover the kickoff

welcome to the league devin
that run just saved this game hopefully we can turn it around and get it together
alright now lets let the defense redeem itself here
all right d time for some action
momentum shift

come on d do a thing
justin kicker tucker
need the d fired up now
fire it up defense
have these black bars on the espn broadcast always been there i just noticed them
my dude rockin the invisaligns
lets goooo build some energy
i wouldnt bother run
at least the run defense has been good for the most part
ok take a break now
ayyyy we got a stop
the nfl apps anti airplay assfuck software made me buy sling tv one of yas remind me to cancel this shit on thursday pls go ravens niner fan
finally we make a damn stop
finally
averett count 1
nice little return might have gotten a little more if he stayed to the outside
momentum swing motherfucker
queen sidelined on 3rd down
lets go
time for a good drive
lets fucking gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
noticed averett on hardman a good amount this game which amused me because the only good quality either of them has is 43 speed
anyone else get annoyed that because edwardshelaires name is so long the stitching on his nameplate makes it look more yellow than the rest of the chiefs players
alright big stop by the d so we need lamar to play his usual game and be his mvp self
man idk why were not pounding the ball
omar comin
alright they finally got that fucking play out of their system
also please run it dont deviate from ur identity
i figured out the gameplan guys chiefs cant win unless by a come from behind victory we are intentionally staying behind so that doesnt happen its so obvious
okokokok switching from black llama jersey to black hollywood
ravens please run the ball
damn on the hands again
andrews gotta catch that man
aaahhhhhh
please run
in his handsshouldve had that one
live shot of a goat
these drops tho
offense picked a bad time to look like shit
gotta catch it that was a good play
offense just looks out of sync
what the fuck 34 routes short of the sticks
drops what the fuck
wheres our running game
cmon make that catch
damn the broncos coach preaches death by inches no that was death by inches were death by miles up here right now
wait i had a bathroom break howd we get the ball back
what the fuck are these play calls man
why are we passing so much
man this is gonna be a long game
quise dropped that before he even got hit what is going on with our guys hands
nothing outside the numbers
why do our pass catchers have more drops in big games can they not take the pressure
andrews has to catch that
run the damn ball play your game
why you no run
what are we the eagles call a run once in a while
lamar really stretching that fieldgood play calling too
wtf is this play calling
i need a fucking drink
this commercial sucks
offense pathetic right now thats now two third downs where lamar threw it to someone who had no fucking shot if its because they tend to pressure on third fine we need to adjust and call more than one blitzbeating route
not liking this play calling
i feel like the st are going to be our difference makers this game
such a joke
stop going for the strip and tackle
they are so fucking open holy shit i could catch a god damn pass out there theres no pressure at all on wrs to get open
roman cant call a passing offense to save his life
this is bull
no defense yet again
kelsey is dicking us hard
10 yard cushions
7 pass yards yeah we need to run
a td here really puts this game out of our current playcallings range
finally some press coverage
gotta get pash rush
how
how was 72 not holding there he literally hugged his fucking helmet
jfc lmaoooo
get a stop here
they need to let lamar run theyre making him stay in the pocket too much
hump got powned
jesus our linebacking core is being exposed
great play by ellis just clogging the lane and realizing he cant outmaneuver mahomes
7 passing yards is not much
defense getting chewed hope theyre embarrassed
that was a travel fucking mahomes man
what is this game
go kill him ellis tf are you slowing down before he even gets rid of the ball
we gonna get anywhere near mahomes or nah
peters kinda getting cooked
holdingggg
defense cant play for shit right now
how the fuck was brandon williams the only person rushing just then
jesus christ this is frustrating to watch
i cant wait for someone to overpay for judon i feel bad for them
holding just doesnt exist anymore
defense is gassed already
zone defense isnt working

seriously wtf is with these decisions
just wow like really what are we doing
when is someone going to cover kelce
how many fucking holds are going to go by without a fucking call
hold on wolfe wtf
id our edges cant get to mahomes in 4 seconds were cooked
wolfe got fucking mugged by 2 linemen
get em
yeah lets rush marlon and clark and drop kudon and bowser
yo the d needs to hit mahomes shake him up a little

were not gonna do shit if he gets to just hang out all night
for some reason hump was in the backfield and judon was downfield great
this is some bullshit
i honestly wouldnt be surprised to see a repeat by mahomes this year
wtf man
are they oiled up i have seen a single good tackle
wtf is roman doing tn
patrick mahomes is quickly working his way up my shit list
why are the chiefs wasting time throwing screens and running our pass rush is awful should run only 7 step drops
we have to stop putting fucking linebackers in coverage do we not remember how mahomes has beat us the last 2 years
offsides judon
smh
thats offsides on judon
were playing so fucking sloppy
here comes offsides
of course judon
of course its judon
uh wtf is this tackling
shouldve traded for ngakoue judon garbage
holy shit get rid of judon please
fuck judon dont resign this bum
has there been 1 flag against kc yet
jesus christ
thanks judon
remember when they called offensive holding
oh man
i am very unchuffed rn not cool guys
meh that was really close
its just so so easy
marcus peters oh my lord
theres so much chatting going on by the defense presnap
excuse me
lmao
great coverage
theyre scoring at will
ayo someone bring judon some taco bell or something he aint playing right
that was the first time ive heard judons name all season
our defense needs to wake the fuck up now
need a long scoring drive to end the half here
why do the chiefs get us so good every time smh

elite team at work lose tonight and win in january
67 total offensive yards were going to need to do a littttttttle better
come on o lets score a touchdown
you guys think theyll expect us to come out passing nah
if i was ever on those fans cams any lip readers would call the fcc
this is why i drink
oh you thought this was going to be easy
wtf was that graphic
need a td here
we are about to call 2 more runs for the rest of this game and lamar will throw 52 times its been literal years since this team has been able to play from behind just gonna be a repeat of the last 3 losses
i never worry until the 4th quarter i have seen us come back from worse than this i have faith it might be misplaced but i certainly hope not
quicksand game you have to play nearly perfect against these guys we made a couple of mistakes and panicked and its all been downhill were a kickoff return away from this being game over already
fucking run
chiefs defense is a good bend dont break defense dont discount that
jackson boutta come out and rip out a 70yd td
look i just want to see the offense look good at this point one step at a time if our offense cant do anything against their d which is not that good what are we doing here
we gotta keep running the ball it was working
wow a run
lamars got his shoulders down he doesnt have his swagger not a great look tbh
our offensive play calling has been terrible in every game i really needed us to win i love g ro but its starting to be a pattern when hes on hes brilliant games like this though idk whos calling the plays doesnt even feel like we have the same oc
please run the ball
playoff greg roman byckkkkk

to abandoning the run
i just did a quick analysis of that kickoff return it looks like an iformation running play that broke down actually really cool looking like a massive oline with double teams and pulls

duvernays quick acceleration and change of direction allowed the improvisation to work
what kinda shit is that
59 for 16 yards passing wtf is going on with our offense
right weve played a bit shit here so far pass calls are terrible jacksons head is going because hes got hella pressure thanks to roman but the thing thats killed us has been the refs and thats no lie between the trip before and all them bullshit holds that arnt being called
chiefs d so rested it might as well be the first drive of the game
these routes are absolutely atrocious
thank god
not my sneed
what is it with the bootlegs all of a sudden
on us

edit wow
roman is fucking out braining himself at this point
just execute
ljarius snead ladarius webb
stop throwing behind los
gus fucking bus run every single play
thank you refs

what the hell is going on
now we run the dive like we were suppose to earlier when it was 0 to 0 that fucking sucks were calling plays based on the opposite situation where in it feels like wtf is going on
andrews is gonna have a special day too huh wtf guys
we need to run jackson more the brilliance of the offense is to confuse their defense
thank christ for that defensive flag
like jesus please let us move the ball
chiefs d is looking top 3 right now why are we so flat
whew lj looking rough so far
yall see our receivers run into each other idiots
our offense looks dogshit

so does our defense

at least special teams is doing good so far
why are we always so far behind with the chiefs ffs
they just look like crap tonight on both sides
defense is soft and flat
offense is dead
defense cant do this all night
they catch everything
we cant stop anything they do
7 passing yards
what is going on right now with the play calling
ravens havent won game where theyre trailing in the first half in a very long time its not looking good
i dont know why we dont run better short passes
this feels familiar its like going back in time 5 years
cant miss
7 yards
might as well give them the score fucking hell
had him 3 yards behind the line and he ends up gaining a yard
who tf is bob wallace
yeah 7 passing yards but there was one time he didnt get to see the field because of duvernay love that i agree he is not playing well but lets give him some room
no heart
this is straight up embarrasing a wet paper bag would do a better job at containing the chiefs offense where the fuck is the fire
the best job in america is the stadium crowd button presser make it twitch based and allow home audience pick the crowd noise
this is how a flat track bully label will start to stick
agent o
our defense failing in critical situations again not sure if its a coaching thing or player thing at this point i mean our edge rush is terrible tackles are wet noodle armed and we are giving mahomes free targets
i mean they score a td here its just going to be a nightmare
switched from the hollywood to the marlo jersey when he makes a play here thank me
im being petty but if we had fans i think this game is 1613
getting slaughtered in everything right now
please get a takeaway
honestly did anyone here expect differently
rush 4 cover more
desperately need a stop
jesus fuck
what a fucking disgrace
judon got his ass handed to him again surprise
shit
fucking embarrassing
lol
who
fire martindale
yuck
yoooooooo
jesus christ
everytime mahomes throws deep i expect a td so that was a relief
pain
i got in turned on my tv and thats the first thing i saw
lol
well at least i can go watch florida and texas play for the stanley cup
fuck me in the ass
im not worried about the score still definitely within reach but god dam we look like trash excluding that first drive
i once said it aint over till its over nah its over pack it up boys
wow
unbelievable bro
game over
that kills need a big play here
how do you get burnt like that
yikes
elliots time i guess
nobody on that defence is on the same page tonight they dont know who got who and where they are going lol
absolute garbage
fucking kill me end my life right the fuck now
dale greg stand up gtfo
juiceman guessed he guessed wrong damn
embarrassing
why marlon why
this blitz really isnt working
welp im done yall have a good night
elliott got absolutely smoked
im done
well this is where earl thomas wouldve helped too bad hes an asshole
fucking bullshit
why the fuck is humphrey blitzing on 3rd and 14 wtf is that call
if they score again i might have to just leave
on the positive this will sit the bandwagoners doen
better run eh guys thatll win the day
i would say that play makes it a game i didnt know who would win but i expected a way better game than this
safety play is trash
cant even blame the refs this time our defense is playing bad tonight
goddamnit elliot
maybe this is a good time to see if there any teams that are willing to trade for a safety glaring hole elliot isnt a starter fuck

offense shut out
must be nice to have competent receivers
these blitzes are working great glad they keep calling them
thats twice weve been burned while blitzing our best cover corner our only stop came when we kept our d simple and just concentrated on the basics
deshon aint working out sucks
yall realize this happens in every big game now right
we struggle to get pressure with our front so we tend to blitz a lot however we struggle to get home even while blitzing

against mahomes nah lol
points on the board here if theres any hope of a comeback
and now its going to be hard to run a lot since we are down so much this isnt good
just doubled our passing yards there lol
mahomes is very likely to be the greatest of all time its a sad reality that this guy could dominate the entire afc for 10 years gonna take a lot of fun away from this fan base
elliot is ass
quick td right hearah
duvernay and tucker are the only ones who deserve to be on this team tn
we just fold against this team unreal
ill see you all next week blame of game everyone
wow a first down
pats fan here trying to feel out what to expect from kc next week is your defense struggling or is mahomes as good as the commentators are trying to make it seem right now
i need a lamar td rn please
oh now we have urgency
this could be extremely positive thinking but kc has won games when down big maybe this is their karma hopefully im right
god dammit
lol
lol
there we go wake the fuck up
wow
fuck me
that play was not a mistake by elliott it was peters bailing out thinking he was gonna jump the cross
jeez
are you fucking kidding
why
when it rains it pours
lmao wtf
holy bozeman just got shredded
cant catch a break
thats it
poopie
21 there it is
pathetic
gg
once they found out the common run routes we didnt stand a chance
pathetic
when it rains it pours
good night all i hope to wake up to a win but for now i feel crappy and the game is not helping
im so mad
there are no excuses but the game just isnt fun to watch if the refs allow such blatant holding as if mahomes needs the help
what a shit performance
pretty disappointed in truzzman tbh not prepared
if i had a nickel for every time judon got a hand on the qb but didnt sack him i wouldnt know how much id have because who uses change
is myhomies 100100 now
i dont know what i expected
run game has been decent this half its a shame we wont see it again
you see roman this is what a good offense does in big games
i cant even enjoy mahomes going crazy in fantasy because surprise surprise im getting blown out there too
oh look what happens when our number one coverage corner is allowed to cover
a break thank god
lol at least butker is losing his battle
lol at least
harrison butker has been one of the only good things for the ravens today
sad to say we needed that miss more then a little
well thats 4 fewer points to worry about
mannn 27pts at the half what is life
2 tuddies and a field goal we good
bro just kneel
lol now we call a timeout
only solace in that half is at least we still have the best kicker
we have to come out strong in the second half only way we come back or at least make it competitive
thats how you go into halftime
someone explain wtf that was
what the hell lol
andy reid just always has harbaughs number completely outcoaches us every time we play
sad thing is they get the ball back
lol the drops and miscues this shit is wack
why can no one catch a damn ball this looks like crabtree snuck his way back onto he team
why cant our offense ever play against this team
awful half one of the worst
wheres snead been he aint gonna save us though play calling is hot garbage
need to start sending humph on the blitzes we arent getting there with him and the trade off on not having him on the back end is killing us
love how the replays show blocking super early on most redzone plays by the chiefs too lol
our players look like they havent run on this field before
so something that lets you piss the bed and not have to sleep in it what a time to be alive
andy reid is making this team look like his insides
lets hope whatever happens this game we fix the obvious issues with this team namely the pass pressure and creating some type of offensive scheme to use when behind cant expect to always play from a lead against good teams
no wrs boo boo ol slow lbs
what the actual fuck am i watching i know its over but shit this is terrible
if mahomes scores here the defense has completely been lost
they keep target ring whoever queen is covering man
sowe dont have a defense
you literally cant defend mahomes some plays
lmaooo
lets go no changes

beautiful lob pass mahomes is too good and its bullshit we cant put any pressure on him
hows that horse collar
thats fucking bullshit challenge it
lol just give them more yards for free

wait i dont think thats a penalty
mahomes is playing on rookie difficulty jesus
this is like watching a game of madden
we cant fucking win because the refs wont even let us fucking play

contact at the line down for a 4 yard gain thats how you lose a game
soft call
bullshit
are we being serious right now
queen gettig dogged
another bad call
yall ready for 3410
why are you even playing those crazy plays in this game this d you can crush straight up
the chiefs are playing with their food we look so lost its comical lmao
they are just fucking with us with all of these ridiculously creative plays its like they know they can do whatever they want to beat us so their just doing schoolyard play designs
look at that we stand still for the first second they are in our head
finally
finally god damn
finally
please
theres that smashmouth defense i fucking know and love
ok im excited now
i forgot about jaylon havent seen him all game
ayyyyyy lets get fucking going then
hell yeah momentum lets goooo
momentum
please llama roman
thank you jesus
momentum swing plz
pump some fucking energy into this team

lets fucking go chuck great clean strip
the refs are fucking with us and the chiefs are just toying with our defense thank god we got that fr because this still isnt looking great
need a td here and 1 more to to feel back in this
lol great first play
what is this fucking play scheme
throw it down the field pussies
lmao
what the flying fuck was ronnie doing
maybe this is why we dont get mnf games maybe they just know we dont show up when there is hype
theyre all over us gotta come up with something better than that
receivers getting killed
there was a receiver wide open down the field on that screen play
nice playcall assholes
i feel like im watching flacco 3 years ago
where is the fucking execution
lmao someone streaking wide open down the sideline of course
thats like the 4th time weve ran the option wtf is going on
i like greg roman but this is inexcusable
why wont they run the fucking ball
thank the freaking lord
we need to keep trying to find creative ways to run it
take those all fucking night
give it to gus and push for the first
terrible
that sums up how this game has gone
holy fuck what
yea its kind of inexcusable at this point
wtf was that shit
wtf
yeah just give those yards back man we look terrible
td on this drive baby
wow
dreadful embarrassing
botched snaps wtf is going on
brown not living up to our hype
first down
hollywood that was catchable
alligator arms
why is brown going over the middle constantly i thought he was suppose to be our deep threat
at least that was a good shot downfield
we need a rg lolb rolb and scb

this shit never changes
hollywood cant slow down there put on the burners and grab that shit
dude hollywood cmon
the fact that brown couldnt get to that ball is indicative of our entire night
nice nice
lets gooo baby
gus hes alive
settle down and take what youre given
demeatrice with the deadly speed
is dobbins alive lol
lamar almost had that edge good play from him
bro use ingram and dobbins more
this is better playing with some balance
keep running
keep it up baby
feed gus rn plz
no huddle 3 rb shuffle who says no
this is more like it chunk plays taking shots lamar looks ready to take over
feed the gus bus
run the ball keep the golden boy off the field
thank god were running it
keep it up
hows that for deep penetration you mfer
bout time they ran the fucking ball
imagine if we did this from the start and not abandon it lol
please for the love of god just keep running it
if only we ran it to begin with
roman just remembered we have running backs
where are the recievers
wear their d down lj
what a block
2018 run game vibes
got away with a huge hold
alright theyre feeling themselves a little bit now surprise surprise pounding it
damn stanley owned his guy on that run from lamar good shit
follow richard ingram
i will repeat until roman learns do we now see what the run does
shit
still dont understand how chiefs wrs are so open and we are having trouble getting consistent seperation
damnit andrews
why are we taking gus bus out
why mark why
wow
who woulda that that as a run first offense we just had to run tha ball to start humming
thats like his 3rd drop tonight
butter hands mark
mark andrews playing like he did against the seahawks last year
andrews is trash tonight not sorry
jesus how many drops does andrews have
i swear catch the ball
come on wtf
i love how not 2 min ago they where saying its going to be a passing game now we remember the run game ohhh thats what they need to be doing
mandrews is such a fucking farce lmao
we look beautiful running the ball
why does greg roman decide to be retarded
gotta catch that
andrews man we needed that
andrews catch the mother fucking ball
show confidence lamar lets gooo
how did he drop that man
any other game thats a touchdown
yard and half and i would still run it into through throat
go for it
damn i miss hayden hurst
go for it
we need to go for this
kinda missing hurst this game
jesus christ you cant put it on him better
where is hayden hurst
just go for it
fuck me bro thats like 6 drops
andrews dropping everything tonight
tyreek hill made that play for mahomes
all game andrews be ashamed
mark andrews aint it
pretty sure thats andrews fourth drop of the night
go for it
go for it
dobbins you had a first if you just kept running
mandrews another drop wtf
how do you drop that andrews fucking butter fingers
not even a question what you do here
go for it here
go for it what do we have to lose
false start are you for real
fucking orlando brown
dumb shit
wtf andrews
alright tucker it is then
go fur it coach
youre kidding
jesus fucking christ
jesus
you gotta go for it
we cant have nice things
when are we going to pay stanley dude is actually consistent and comes to play every game
tuckers 42 yards would be good from 60
need a stop before midfield here
what the fuckkk
thats my kicker sadge
if you didnt know better youd think we were on the road with how many problems were having with the line its crazy
it looked good to show some life but damn man we gotta take advantage of every time we get a stop
in tucker we trust
why tf are our receivers dropping easy balls bruh
so sloppy
that drive showed why we dont win big games we have 2 good offensive drives both were run heavy when we are in situations when we need to pass against good teams were fucked maybe its lamar maybe its roman i dont know but its a problem i dont see going away soon
fuck greg roman let lamar call the rest of the game once again edwards is punishing the opposing d still why is ingram on the field more run the ball run the ball with dobbybus run the ball with lamar fuck throwing fuck it
i mean id say there is a lot of time but i have 0 confidence that mahomes wont just walk onto the field telekinetically freeze our dbs and have the commentators fawn over how weve never seen it before
onside kick
i dont need two heartbreaks this year pls
im in it to the end come on ah yeeeeeeehha
our defense just has no idea whats going on
mahomes can pretty much throw it wherever he wants
put mp at wr
defense aint communicating well at all
why such soft coverage against these wrs seems like every single person is open on a 7 yard curl always
bro thats a lot of yards
you have to press the speedsters theyre open because they get a running start everytime lol
penalties are insane
peters was next to the safeties covering watkins what kinda call is that
dbs are way confused or something and playing scared 15 yards off receivers is just not working at allvthey are drinking and dunking down the field

make andrews and hollywood do catching drills until there hands bleed then continue for an hour after that
why the fuck are we still playing so far off on coverage
would love if our receivers would catch the ball like that
wtf am i seeing are our dbs not elite with high end speed at corner press
what the fuck is this defense

our cbs were playing fifteen yards off and the te was obviously going to be left open during our rush
we cant even complain about how much theyre drooling over the chiefs ravens havent given them anything good to say
so come back come back dump off and sprinkle in the run and thats all they have to do we are better then this
where is lj fort are we running some packages constantly we need a will and mike badly
why is there 10 yards of separation between receivers on each play jfc
ayo mp juiceman theres no juice with that 10 yard gap youre giving
holy shit
lets fucking go
yes ravens d
didnt get it
turnover on downs
now mandrews please to hold the ball
we need a td here
huge stop
made it a game
were afraid of the deep ball so we play off how about we stop blitzing so we can have safeties to help
gotta get a td
whoa they held something
beleeeee
defense yes
can we get in the dam fun box offense
wait holy fuck im hard again
it looks like we may have actually made halftime adjustments hallelujah
lets go man turn up d
run the balllllll
lets bring this within a score jesus christ do something for christ sake
another break
wolfe is a bad man
ok d now o punch them in the fucking mouth
huge stop gotta score tho
watch the defense play lights out in the 2nd half to give us hope but the offense will keep shitting the bed just to twist the knife
great stop ride this momentum to a td and were right back in it
we fucking got a chance boys
maybe try a deep shot to boykin or something
lets get this man
god we need a td on this drive
we get a td here and we are back in this bitch
literally any pass probably gets them the first lol
turn up o
so no more running
run the damn ball
defense being clutch but damn the consistency is still terrible
our offense could be named lamar and the other guys
i dont care if that didnt go for much but damn that was smooth
the bus
fuck yes gus
game on
the gus bus
gogo bus
feed gus
the run is working who the fuck would of thought
the wheels on the bus
gus the mf bus edwardsssss
there ya go gus
i will keep saying it gus should be our starter

theres that slippery llama
here comes the knockout punch
feed gus

we still in it boyz finally playing like the team we are
chiefs aint gonna catch this gus bus
lets go o gotta get it in here
when we lost hayden we lost the ability to go from andrews to someone else when andrews is off that plain ol sucks
big boy boyle for six
there ya go boyle
boyles got better hands than andrews
bus god boyle
boyle boyle oh boyle
fuckin finally
yeeea thats right use the big boys
well we now have like 60 passing yards in this game
i literally thought that was intercepted
do you guys think with mandrews diabetes that when his blood surgar levels get off that it affects his ability to catch my nephew is diabetic and when his levels are off he has little coordination almost like he is drunk
back in this finally
big truss you guys lets go d
one more stop pls
need a big stop here
big truss woo woo
what did i tell yall comeback seazooon
oh god

these armed forces commercials are so weird
cmon d
marcus peters gonna come up huge on this drive i can feel it
eric the enemy
anyone see our coaches grilling our guys on the sidelines like that i havent
big stop here fellas
the funny thing about kcs offensive coordinator yelling on the sidelines is how quickly his mask keeps slipping every time he utters a word
get this stop

or not
if the defence shits their pants here il fucking flip
humps needs a signature of punch out
passing play you know it
huge 3rd down
get the ball back
looked like he almost fumbled there keep at him d
please get a stop
screen
wow wide open
shuddered when i heard elaire because i thought i heard elam
why do yall let this happen
lmao mahomes just eats winks weak ass blitz alive he doesnt give a shit
we need a big stop and of course they do a quick pass and get 20 yards on it
no blitz please
lj fort balling les go
why are they allowed to block downfield during passes ive seen that shit like 4 times
stop here plz
fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkk
confusion in the secondary again the inability to actually be anywhere near receivers is killing us
come on defense hold it together
wink with another all out blitz as if mahomes hasnt been eating our blitz alive at least keep 6 back
please keep running
yeah that was a really rough 2nd quarter glad the team got their focus back

that said going to be tough to come back and win this game
this nonsense weve been doing with judon had not worked all game judon if a non factor entirely
how argh thats just not fair
l
m
a
o
why they so damn open
pain
why are we blitzing constantly
always half a second fucking late
oh look burned again
gotta hold them to a fg and offense better be ready to work fast
son of a biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
yeah board is in for queen
wtf man drop mahomes little ass for once
just 1 3rd down stop pls
why is mahomes making so many calls at the line and calling audible while it seems like we dont call many audibles just motions
this is it d time to make the stop
thank you marlo
hahahaha
if they blitz ill cry
they are gonna get a first down here i just feel it
edit fuck me
if you play man hell just run lmfaooooo
fucking come on
well at least theyre still out of butkers range
youve got to cover the outside if you pressure
3rd 10 and im expecting a 17 yard completion
dont give up another big 3rd and long please
give me a break
of course

yep
these blitzes are godawful
stop blitzing
come on defense
there is literally no way to stop them you have to hope they beat themselves and you cant shoot yourself in the foot
mahomes playing on god mode
td here and this game is over
please no td
now they are grinding on us the way we grind on below average teams
now theyre in fg range its turnover or bust i think
watch the chiefs oline idk if our dline isnt performing or if their oline is really that good
eelair counter 3
why is wink blitzing its not working at all just gifting mahomes easy yards every single time
its heisman time
lol dudes we need one more stop turnover or 3 and out lets go boys lets go
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
qb contain non existent
oh ffs
if humphrey demands ramsey money after this performance
maybe draft a decent pass rusher
what the shit
lmfaooooo
wow
embarrassing
fucking embarassing
were losing this game by a touchdown that shit is so obvious at this point lol
here we stand
i hope we didnt have a sidebar bet with rchiefs
isnt that same play belichick used
quick td and pray for a turnover
we better get vertical quick theres still an outside chance at this game
lamar is now 05 when trailing by 10 clearly roman cant call a game when the run isnt established once again our stale coordinators are gonna be our downfall
the offense and defense cant get on the same page man when one does well the other sucks ass
lightning just won the cup fuck 2020
if not for special teams the score would be 3813
how do you not contain the edge against mahomes its basic shit like that
we should still be able to win the next 3 weeks barring a bad loss
i feel like theyre just playing with us
can we buy a bus pass please
its kind of annoying the returner is halfway off the field before the kick goes in the end zone
eelair counter 4
garbage time here we goooo
what happened to everyones hands today
and theres another lamar awfully thrown pass has marquise for a td and throws it behind him
he had hollywood just gotta lead him more
bad throw
lamar wtf man
finally we get a weak call
he was open
dammit another miss by lamar
poor pass 8
another horrible pass
another inaccurate pass that would have been a huge gain
4am time to go to sleep cant believe i stayed up for this bs
it is an absolute fucking joke that he makes that play but an even bigger joke that he has to make it in the first place
dobbins makes me happy
refs garbage tonight bullshit tripping call on boyle paying no mind to chiefs ol holding judon that nothing call
can i give a hot hot take give jk and gus equal carriesplays and make ingram a specialty back
pick up the pace fellas lets go
where the fuck was this
now we have hands
is tyrann mathieu out because i feel like i havent seen him all game
thats a flaw he still has to overcome he was set on running there no matter what
all out blitz take a shot for real
wait did andrews actually catch something
bro what the fuck
bout time
terrible play call on that down
where the fuck are these short rhythm passes when the game isnt already fubard
go for it
fuck this
rip
holy fucking shit
game
is that on stanley no right
pathetic
well
see ya guys next week im gonna consume unhealthy amounts of unhealthy things and sulk myself to sleep
only thing that can save us is a pick 6
im embarrassed
thank god this game wasnt at 3am where i live at least
thats game
i think its play calling behind it but man i didnt expect the kc oline to work our dline so often
ouch
bench judon please
young team ravens are good and will only get better its the chiefs time
fire greg roman now this is what we get from him everytime we have a big game his career proves that he wont change either
this is like the 2013 manning game mahomes is going for 8 tds tonight and i hope he gets it i hope this shitty team that walked out tonight has the label as the team that gave up the most tds in an nfl game
hate me if you want but lamar is nowhere near the level of efficiency of mahomes thats not even taking in the account the god level tier of play calling
if you dont like this you dont like ravens football
can we trade judon at this point a 5th or 6th round pick would be worth more than his bum ass
baltimore paper tigers
we actually look 100 times worse against teams that are relevant
looks like lamar is already in playoff form lmao
1 chiefs
2 titans
3 bills
4 maybe ravens maybe steelers might be that team
greg roman needs to go
you all are negative as hell this is the sb winning team we dont look great tonight but they are an amazing team stop shitting on our boys you are good times fans and please leave
wow patty really dropping tds to this fucking fatass embarrassing
this is the worst game of lamars career
well prob make playoffs and i wont even be excited
defense cant stop shit
want judon gone next year
so funny lions fan here you guys are elite and still bitch like youre the bengalsor the lions for that matter


hollywoods dropped 2 passes tonight so much for wanting to be montanarice
fire roman
refs arent as bad as you all make it out to be our offense is complete ass just like the last time we played the chiefs just like the last time we played the titans
lamar isnt ready our defense is not as good as advertised and this team has no fucking heart
lamar cant hit the broad side of a barn from 5 yards away right now and yet were going to need him to throw 40 times in the second half
this defense wont get us out of the wild card at this rate of play and we were supposed to have gotten better theres 5 whoke positions and roles we desperately need help at
we are frauds

u hoes forgetting what the last few years of flacco were like
mahomes has 2x more yards against the blitz than lamar has period
you know watching the game on mute is so much better only so much chiefs jerkin off i can take yeah we played bad but even when we tried to make it a game again the announcers were complaining about every little mistake we made
welp this games over
soft soft soft soft

were pretenders and flattrack bullies
best kicker my ass
judon is going to be the reason we dont win a championship
what the fuck was that for dump of to the los when we need 20 yards
this game feels over already
x200b

it is okay girls just need a field goal and touchdown to tie the game
bullshit fucking call
defense is a fucking joke

offense is a fucking joke

can we please start fucking cooking
bums me out to see judon go from pro bowler to this what happened
peters needs to get his shit together for this second half and redeem himself with a pick
ok we need to stop talking shit to chiefs fans theyre invincible we dont compare shut the fuck up
yo anybody dissing judon hasnt watched a ravens game before
can we throw a fucking forward pass jesus cocksucking christ with this team
fraud team lol
et phone home
lmao absolutely exposed as frauds
miss earl thomas
patrick mahomes is the greatest qb of all time i think he could pick apart the 2000 ravens sometimes you just gotta chalk it up to that
receiver drops a pass

everyone lamar chokes in big games
some of you all are embarrassing in here
andrews is horrendous

lamar looks nervous also gus is the best back on the team
so mad at this game but mahomes got that bde in baltimore
people need to calm down lamar isnt god hes going to have bad games hell learn from it and move on
a learning lesson lol
i dont know how some of you guys think we can win we are beat on every facet against them and theyre depleted defense cant match up offense definitely cant match up with greg roman
ive been watching the ravens since i returned to maryland in 1998 its pretty wild to our team battling it out in the regular season with another team to be basically widely acknowledged as the best team in the conference if not the whole league
those unis tonight look sharp
hell yeah i want to see ingram work tonight thats going to be key
so sad we dont get any crowd tonight they would have really supported the boys today just like for the pats game
i was really hoping for all black
bless the knees and bring home the w boys big truss
now run it again
runem down all night
woooooooooo
thats my fucking llama
what a fucking run
llama speed
lamar making it look easy
holy fuck i love our qb
llama run
thats are boi
lamar jackson
woooo baby
i hope we get to see some down field plays i felt like we were lacking those attempts last week
lamar
what a run
aye lamar
hell yeah
yee yee lets go boys
demeatrice
thats good but eat the clock nom nom
just hyped up their dline just to give that up immediately
mvp mvp mvp
yall ever see a lama sprint that fast
if we dont run 50 times this game we stoopid
andrews is lucky he didnt get called for holding there
ah come one hollywood gotta catch that
niner fan stopping by your qb is too good stop it its not fair
he was way out of bounds when he got hit
oof that was on the money
little bit of pi there
hollywood come on bra
i like the rhythm of this first drive
just casually running down the field lets go
lets goooooooooooooooooooooooo
great block by andrews
im fine with that call as long as marlon gets the same leeway
the black jerseys look great like usual
so good at the meshpoint
keeping the play alive and getting the first
big boy
3 is fine lets get it back
plz deshone elliott and chuck clark ball out
nervous nervous nervous
certainly seems like we dont trust our line to keep a clean pocket against this front all those passing plays were roll outs
of course there is a flag
dafuq jimmy come on man
and so it begins smh
here we go
remember when tyreek hill beat us with 1 leg i remember
remember last season when we played the chiefs and went for the 2 point conversion three times and missed every attempt glad we put points on the board thanks tuck
gonna be a long night if were calling those
that was such a bad call cmon refs
kelse was so open i knew he was gonna go there
easy peasy
that lead didnt last very long
defense had no answer
hahahhaa
lol butker
no more field goals
harrison come outside we need to talk
butker who
ok yeah penalty was trash but damn coach you bout to get fined
oh look 0 yards on a scrimmage throw stop roman this is why you were ran out of san fran
dumb fucking zebras
this is some pussy ass playcalling throw downfield goddamn it
2 lamar fumbles already
what is going on with the offense this is fucking ugly
its gonna be one of those games
lol trying hard to legitimize these refs reputation for some reason
lets go boys we got this shit
im not a negative or pessimistic person but we may be fucked lol
miss the real ravens defense
we could be winning rn
lmfaooo
refs you going to call holding
literally the same bullshit as last years game they never throw flags on kc holding ever
judon that was dirty
i mean we are getting some pressure on them but dam best secondary in the nfl and they getting shit on def gonna be an offensive shoot out
we have to pay ronnie marlon and lamar no way well ever be able to afford a decent pass rusher
ball taxi
great pass andrews needs to catch that
damn andrewa and hollywood let em through their hands today
shouldve caught that one honestly throw was great
imagine being in swampy humid ass florida and having to wear a mask all day i love disney world but cmon
holy fuck our defense is fuckin terrible
secondary is allowing everything
3 for 3 what kind of garbage food quality is that
im not stressing down 10 in the 2nd but we gotta step it up playcalling is garbage rn
judons body really is built by taco bell i guess
how atrocious can this team be at this point im not sure which side of the ball is playing worse
finally a damn holding call
they only called that holding cuz it was super obvious
this playcalling is terrible stop moving the pocket holy crap the rollouts clearly arent working
absolutely pathetic this shit is painful to watch
i mean how are we supposed to counter the choker label thats what we are at this point
titans game all over again except instead of henry its mahomes offense is just completely dead and defense cant get a stop
theyre gonna quit you can feel it
this isnt just titans playoffs this is chargers playoffs level bad
i have a feeling were about to find out what its like to be on the other side of one of these massive beatings lol
hahahahahahahaha
oh great roll the mahomes dick ride tape
their o line is holding every play
our defense was swiss cheese last year with earl against kc and yall really somehow thought we were gonna be better and how seriously
i feel like earl couldve helped on that deep pass im not an earl thomas fan but mahomes is torching your secondary
its sad to see that peters is so far playing like he did during his last season for us missing tackles botching coverages i really want the man to succeed
what the fuck was lj doing there just dicking off around the line after that play
no words
fire someone
i thought his arm was moving forward
welp im out boys ill catch the recap later i cant watch this team play this bad
lamar haters are out now even though the defense and greg roman fell asleep
we are down 313 if it werent for a lucky few breaks

this is not a team thats going far in the playoffs at allwake the fuck up coaches and players
so much for elite defense
that kick went in
fuck greg roman 3 and 3 on the 8 we pass

down 3 with the ball 3 str8 passes

we do not have 10 rushes this half

fire greg roman this is ridiculous and cannot continue it is the tenn game all over again
relax those plays were more than likely just to try and get the offense some rhythm
put me in coach
also fuck all these penalties god theyre playing awful
god we are fucking sucking but the refs are making us look a lot worse rn
everyone saying this game is over

keep that same energy
listen the nfl decided that holding didnt exist tonight can we please just use it to our advantage
chiefs defense looking like the greatest defense of all time
no one is happier that were laying an egg than these announcers lol
was that another damn flag holy shit refs
edwards needs to be our starting back looks like age has caught up with ingram
get dobbins the the rock
bench andrews after 1st half whenever he performs like this
come on a false start
please make this stop
any chance we move on from ingram and move forward with the gus bus and jk dobbins
wait why is the clocklmoving
why does he keep saying red area red zone dude
if anybody knows the most about blitzing its andy reid in his eagles days stop blitzing
theres still hope but even if we take the l im glad it was early cause it will be a wake up call
chiefs oline have been unstoppable mahomes has all day
thats just a nice play call right there
so pathetic lol wtf
no weapon forged against us shall prosper

say it
i dont give a shit about bitching at the refs this is their job and they cant call a fair game its clearly biased and a complete fuckery fuck them i call it like i see it
at least were better than the browns
lets not forget we started 22 last season after losing to the chiefs and browns
i dont know about yall but im ready to see more of dobbins
king crimson
hurry up wheres the urgency
wow im so glad our offensive line was ready to play there s
game is still not over but man our offense has to do something differently those last 4 plays were just embarrassing
cant win em all we will be back next week
both dline and oline are fucking trash against any athletic players
how long is this damn ad break seriously
wait there are 23 seconds left
its alright this loss only makes our win against them in the playoffs only much sweeter
were rollovers
maybe this will be the impetus we need for the rest of the season
i like that we didnt try to pad any stats there at the end just let it be over
who are the weapons outside of andrews thats our main issue
every single one of you paid more income taxes than donald trump
this team thought they were too good for ab lmaooo

sign earl thomas
outside observer here it appears the ravens have no ability to play when theyre down they always play like theyre up 3 scores they have zero chance coming back from this unless they start throwing the ball down the field bottom line dont think theyre capable though theyre gonna run and dink and dunk and will lose by 3 scores
where the fuck has calais campbell been
we have the worst o line in the league
everybody except lamar thought it was a fucking bye week i guess

edit okay 20 people i get it im a llama stan and had my llama goggles on
missing earl and tavon tonight
only mistake mahomes made was his wife
my enthusiasm for football this year has died
early in his career but lamar is showing he cant win big games he always looks terrible in a big hype game for the first 3 quarters
so many takes are going to come out after this game and i wont be able to combat any of them

josh allen lamar jackson incoming i cant even dispute it lj is a rb confirmed and ill have to nod my head in agreement

feelsbadman
lamar chokes in every big game he plays

playing scared
defense is terrible
cant wait to blow this first and goal who will it be
guess the chiefs are the warriors and we are the rockets
chiefs have full control of this game regardless of the current score its an l but im not shocked about it
okay this game is over see yall next week
we got this
lamar is booty
down 17 i think this game is over barring a miraculous comeback way too many mistakes and issues matching up with this team they thrive on big plays we cant defend big plays over the top they feed the te over the middle we cant defend tes they have a mobile qb that can buy time we dont have a pass rush and cant disrupt him rushing 4 its just a bad matchup our defence was gassed even after the duvernay td and the offence has had no momentum any momentum theyve had was killed by bs calls and our oc has called a bad game i cant deal with him getting away from the run in these big games receivers and andrews have also played horribly i hope harbaugh make the necessary adjustments in the second half to bring us close
its one game in week 3 of the season some of yall fans need to chill out its not the end of world did you all actually expect us to go 160
lol how embarrassing does anyone think we can change things before playoffs because i dont
lamar sucks in big games
jesus how many fucking ravens are gonna fumble this team has no energy already and romans play calling is dog shit
gg
judon should just be released at this point he more of negative than anything

play washington next week so maybe lamar will actually play good and we can meme about how he stunts on these hoes again
steelers in 1st place


we aint coming back hey humphrey wheres your fucking plane video now
john harbaugh did a great job getting this team ready for this game fucking assclown big game choker
fuck greg roman im starting it now im starting the fire fat greg roman thread
i wish we still had earl guarding the middle of the field
the ravens fucking suck i cant believe we even thought we were good this year
yall give up too easy
lmaoooooo bruh what a fucking joke romans gotta go defense is absolutely dog shit and it doesnt help with headass elliot back there oh yeah cause we didnt need thomas fucking joke of a dogshit team
and thats the gamegod damn this team chokes on cock against real teams
yall miss zadarius now or what lol
we hate paypal

clap clap clap clap clap

we hate paypal
here comes the ref ball
so just hypothetically if we lose today do we accept that theres a track record of blowing big games and if so what do you pin that on a young excitable team a coaching issue
this is too easy smh
we can do this
283
so we just going to lose week 3 2 years in a row now
jacksons lost his head

edit i agree i dont know why im
getting downvoted here it just mutes you for 8 minutes when were supposed to be talking game time
judon sucks so fucking much god fuck him
our defense is honestly full of guys that have been mid to late round picks from our team that our fo always highly touts and then they absolutely play up to their draft status in games lol
out fucking coached
hey guys harbaugh here i need some help tell me what i need to do
im turning this shit off
secondary acquisitions have made literally no difference might even be worse

going for 3 is like kissing your sister
sign earl thomas
fuck dude im an unfortunate jets fan whos in the midst of a crazy fantasy comeback his guys are laying eggs and i have tyreek and andrews do you think andrews is still going to get looks based upon past games or will the ravens cut the bleeding and look elsewhere this game
jk cant hold gus jockstrap
hah eat shit andrews at least boyle can catch
cut judon right now

guy is a 2nd stringer and situational rusher at best
td here and its gg
lamar still hasnt one loss to a team without mahomes
only thing thats good about our offense is our rushing nothing else gg
honestly were still a good team that had a rough day against another fantastic team its just like that sometimes
i mean it i want the ravens and chiefs to trade olines and receiving cores for a day
i forgot the madden curse existed
fairweather fans
yo our rookie linebackers suck ass
pathetic at least knock him on his ass and take the 15 on the ko if youre elliot lol
breaks my heart to see bad defense in baltimore we got a bunch of pussies playing dline and pass rush

plain and simple
im so fucking tired of seeing lamar buckle under pressure
rip ravens 09102020 9282020
dont get me wrong i fucking love dobbins but does anyone else feel like we wasted a pick on him when we had ingram and gus
lamar needs to come back with a new haircut my mans looking like a human cockroach
should never have gotten rid of thomas and carr spent all that money on pass rushers and still cant get to a qb

edit truth hurts doesnt it you fucking cunts
fairweather fans as far as the eye can see
tank for trevor
oh lord its playoff lamar

judon is such a fucking liability better off having 10 players on the field than him giving the other team free penalty yardage
choke whatever
removed

removed
we aint beating this team guys without a pass rush or earl
playoff lamar
ffs why havent we gotten rid of judon yet
fucking fire greg roman this is infuriating theres a reason why he doesnt survive more than 3 seasons with running qbs
is this the madden curse
this team is gonna stagnate so hard lmao what a pitiful first half
if roman isnt gone by halftime we done
fire roman
i guess the chiefs online gets to hold new rule
hollywood is not helping lamar at all tonight bad hands and not fighting for the ball
no weapon forged against us shall prosper
ill be honest this proves that we need to sign ab no consistent outside receiving threats
lamar is so fucking overrated

removed
we dont score next drive we lose
rg3 for the 2nd half this shit is over
you guys be so quick to turn on your team
d has been our weakness for 3 seasons honestly
im going to be travelling to baltimore for the first time in october what are some fairly covidsafe things i should check out while im there

i tend to like the weird side of cities
fast llama
lamars been shovelling like no tomorrow lately
big boi run
run it all day baby
pound em until they stop you
x200b

mark andrews territory
no fgs here
i also cant stand that roll out pass shit lamar is top dog at reading defenses dont cut the field in half for the defense
cmon d
mannnn we walked down the field and stalled
yikes
fuck
oh
jc jimmy

fuck this bullshit
what a garbage call
rvaens defense needs to stop mahomes
lmao pressure is on

we look like we are running in slow motion
other than that i know we will be getting a stop right here on defense
the best officials wow
no way we are gonna win this game im going to be nursing my pistol on my temple
this defense is fucking pathetic son
folding like a fucking lawn chair
we have literally never defended trick plays well not against the pats in that afcc or the titans last year
i really dont want to have to turn this game off at halftime but its trending in that direction fast i dont understand how a defense this talented can look like absolute shit were giving them whatever they want without any kind of fight
can yall calm down now please
butterfingers andrews
we need to take out queen and replace him with levine
another fucking hold
this pass rush is literally trash
wow they were holding wolfes jersey bad
chiefs offense outclassing ravens offense in the first half we dont match up well with this team at all
wtf is judon doing
cut judon at halftime
this is not optimal at all
well this is embarrassing
what doesnt make sense is the fact that the chiefs defense isnt that good theyre ranked fucking 27 against the run weve done much better against better defenses yet here we are
how is it legal for the announcers to blow the chiefs on tv
ugh duvernay wtf was that that was close stay back there
whoa a flag against kc
this aint the titans baltimore
this drive is showing promise
officially shit
im pretty excited to see this team put up an amazing regular season record and then get bounced early in the playoffs for the third year in a row
aside from finding a way to get overpaid what exactly does judon do well
gotta get a stop here and some points before the half

edit nevermind
good night
lol
gg im going off the radar find me crying
if it was already a touchdown and you got to hit mahomes wish humphrey hasnt pulled up make him feel that shit lol
i said 4116 i meant 5510
i told them to hold shouldve listened to me
bozeman has to sit now
we need an oline
wow i forgot its the second half fuuuuuckkk
butker gonna cost them the game lol
fuck greg roman
nothing has gone our way tonight i smell an int from lamar
well looks like i jinxed butker
these dudes dont need masks they couldnt catch covid if they tried they cant catch shit rn
what a garbage first half i had a feeling all day i didnt know itd be this bad
lmao none of these turds can catch
rcatastrophicfailure
mahomes is a complete baby they didnt call a flag until he whined bs the new patriots
why are we scared of running it with dobbins
mark andrews time to go to bench bb
get the fuck off the field andrews im sick of your shit
cmon rook just run into the guy
go for it
it sucks but lamar has one physical guy to catch the ball and thats andrews boykin is a no show hollywood is afraid of contact and thats basically it unless you get lifelong wr3 willie snead involved
yall should sign that ball boy better catcher than andrews
ravens never die
as shit as were playing defense is keeping us in this man
boykin has been mostly a no show disappointment imo
damn gus edwards is always the man when we need him most
were gonna have to abandon the run game at some point there isnt enough time
okay im glad that worked out and all but why didnt we stick to the run there that was a dangerous pass

beautiful play design god damn
you know maybe the game plan should be dont let them get up early maybe we wouldnt be in such a bind right now lol
he has answered every pressure
i just wish for once the defense was ready for the biggest games on the schedule
come on ah yeeeeeeehha
is queen injured
our defense is full of frauds
thats sad
imagine actually letting dobbins play
holy shit a ravens player made a catch
lamar has lost his head this game man
ah yes take a sack with 6 minutes to go in the 4th
why do we wait for the end to play dobby
all lamar has to do is thrown that under yikes
never lost hope

ravens never die
why do we need 3 guys in the booth griese is so unnecessary
even im getting tired of me saying hold
well that was pathetic
games over
hey ho greg romans gotta go
oh theres boykin fucking waste of a roster spot
well lamar did say truzz trump hes definitely playing like a trump fan tonight
game over see you next week
removed
get queen off the field
touchdown lets gooooo
removed
why are we kicking
this team cant ever fucking make me happy
how thats not pass interference is beyond me

on to washington
fuck this defense aint gonna stop them o line is one of the worst roman calling the worst plays
removed
removed
424 and you go for it we have justin fucking tucker motherfuckers
love lamar but if we had russ or mahomes right now we wouldnt even be worried
kc fan coming in peace wow you guys are the real deal pat had to work for his tds tonight for sure hopefully we dont see you guys again
man fuck this team
time for lamar to step up if he cant pass this challenge then we need to start a dialog
ravens tend to look really good against bad average or decent teams problem is against the cream of the crop theyre kinda dogshit
1st half is on lamar play calling has not been great but hes gotta make a play

lamar just isnt a good field general not lookin for the hot route when kc sends 7 hopefully this kicks our ass into gear like the 2 ls last year
boykin is awful looks uninspired as hell and its no surprise lamar has no chemistry with him
our teams sucks we just played bad teams

removed
this is why you need to have fucking fans at the games it should be deafening in the stadium but alas the team pussied out by not allowing fans
why do we suck today
this team is so overrated were still a playoff team but we wont make the super bowl
poll do we have the worst secondary in the league they look horrible
not going for it lmfao
where mark andrews at he washed bro not even running routes in the red zone
garbage offense
refs know were favored to win though i doubt it rn so theyre tryna make it a close game with bs calls lets just be honest here
we are done defense is softer than least year even with above average mcqueen
lmfao
peters getting exposed rn
fucking pathetic
throw in the bench by the looks of how theyre playing the bench can probably do better
this is a repeat of the cleveland game last year not the chiefs game now we suddenly cant stop the run this game is as good as over
lmaooooo
calling it now were getting curb stomped by washington team next week
bring in kyle boller
tbh the ravens usually struggle on the 3rd game of the season for some reason
fuck you andrews
why wouldnt we go for it
marcus peters is such a little bitch
big trus
pathetic good job harrison

i was lead to believe lamar is an mvp talentdid the monstars steal his power
this team is a fucking joke
the chiefs just built different

feeling pretty bad rn ngl the league is right lamar is overhyped and not a great qb cant trust him if we fall behind even the trolls are right mullens might have won this game foles could have won it with this stacked roster
removed
ravens fans and bitching about the refs name a more iconic duo look guys theyre just playing better right now chiefs deserve it lets see how we respond
removed
this game was over before it started ravens are going to win no doubt about it
gg we might be good but we sure as hell cant beat anyone better
its week three and you all act like its the playoffs this game really does nothing for either team this year
they should have let earl thomas elliott sucks
are the ravens actually good or have they just looked good against bad teams but will look bad against good teams
just lamar fantasy owner not believing my eyes i need sixteen points to win have kelce ceh and lamar

fantasy can be so rough

what is wrong with the ravens tonight yikes
game
fuck this team i miss the flacco era tbh
what happened to yalls defense or just mahomes too good

edit guys i was legit curious dont have to be mad at me

looks like my steelers defense
choke artists dna at work
are the ravens actually good at least relative to other afc teams
love the mascot but damn does it look better covered in red white and gold
removed

take out your frustration on me by downvoting my comment youre welcome
i smell an ass whipping
if they score another easy td here then we might as well pack up and go home coaching failing us hard already first down penalty then three straight empty sets weve already abandoned our bread and butter for no reason

great block from him on that kickoff

and can put the ball on the goal line so we can run it back best in the league my ass dont get me wrong he is good but come on it tucker no question

hes matching the current gametime effort
removed
pass rush
its the lack of pass rush ive always disliked the amount of blitzes that are sent it leaves way too many gaps and open wrs
not their fault no pass rush gives them forever to run a route

judon once again is a fucking ghost
should signed logan ryan when we had a the chance
ridiculous
peters is playing soft coverage because thats how he plays to get interceptions but that does absolutely nothing for cuts and stops
not as bad as our oline kc has great receivers but not a very good dline lg is a real problem and jackson constantly under pressure
removed
you guys always come back always lol as im typing told ya
but duvernay looks great
was just texting my brother same thing very sloppy play and as im typing 93 yd td lol but defense is sloppy tackling tonight
we back in it son
judson looks tired already and hasnt done much the secondary looks lost
its over now boys harbaugh has no idea how to coach from behind and no ability to corral the team when they become unhinged well at least i wont be tired tomorrow morning for work like i was stressing about

go back to rbrowns

knew he was special when we took him
shot in the ass we needed right there

our best teams are always strong defenses with game changing abilities on special teams jacoby in our last super bowl run jermaine in the first

if we connect those factors of ravens football with our new high powered offense were going to be scary af
removed

this was the only guy who actually showed up tonight
that man is fast
one of the few bright spots tonight salute to duv tucker gus
jacoby jones regen
hook em
mustve had that talk with ed reed before the game
dunno why i read that as david duchovney kickoff return td its been a long day
highlight of the night for sure
great job sealing the right side
try him in the slot instead of snead
slow ass punter

for real why does roman like to get so fucking cute
welcome to big game greg

roman always changes up his play calling when the games get important
wtf man have we not learned anything from the titans game
go to the fucking game thread
roman is shit in big games
thats what im saying like wtf
feel like jacksons head is gone
removed
removed
waste of their effort imo
removed
we can draft a guy in the 4th round or later to do what hes doing
yes

now i dont think on the replay that he jumped the gun as he didnt go over until the ball was snapped but he hasnt played great this tear
trash
bowser has played light years ahead of judon so far this season judon is goneeee im sure the jets will overpay him
not by us anyway let someone else deal with the headache
removed
we are too busy watching the game to do an intellectual exercise
mvp nuff said
fuck the steelers
removed
honestly just drop in to coverage at this point the middle of the field is fucking clueless
bye judon didnt want to keep you anyways
removed
no we just need a new oc for playoff games and vs the chiefs
we pound the run on the first drive and then just stopped theyre forcing it to andrews and no one is getting open for lamar
yup
i agree 100
removed
like something epic
i feel like that falls on deaf ears with professionals the team is on the hook for their paycheck whether they win or not
he wont same shit different year
removed
defense needs some help stayinf off the field 72 fucking yards on offense is embarrassing
ha this offense doesnt do that
nearly half the yardage on 1 play crazy
theyve just been on the field the entire game and are getting gassed need one good drive on offense to give the d some rest

what a clown lol
removed
ah no no no fuck fuck fuck no no ahhhh

because we need more depth at the
position maybe need to cut young so we can have some that can actually play
removed
the guy has played lights out every week since the trade

the chiefs are best team in the league with the best qb

ill cut him some slack
hes getting absolutely torched and that last td he just looked lost
i am not talking shit first off i am rooting for you guys rest of the season i wanna see us in the afc championship but i tried to tell you guys before marcus peters is a 5050 defender he tries to go for the big plays instead of staying on his man we had to see it in kc as well he was getting burnt as well that was peters downfall he is ball hawk he isnt focused on the defender he is focused on where the ball is going and sometimes that dont pay off
hes been lights out since we got him but tonight he looks like he didnt watch one minute of film
removed

they are rolling over this defense looks horrid
i retract my statement about elliot he has been playing very well since this game

would be first i am be serious it would be our first in a few years

yup absolute garbage looks like the chiefs are playing against an ncaa team
theyre making us look like the browns smh

not to forget chiefs ball to start the half

i actually thought he looked sluggish and little to no effort besides that one play where he shouldnt have gotten flagged youre right he cannot shed blocks to save his life i hope they let him walk im sure edc wont give him that money judon is the type of pass rush that excels when theres someone a lot better on the other end ie zadarius smith
removed
youre not the only one
i dont like anything about judon
hes a average pass rusher that wants big money for benefiting from a blitz heavy scheme smh same problem as last year we cant generate any rush from our front four
with the amount of bullshit calls its unacceptable from a team standpoint couldve given the refs more ammunition to gift another touchdown to the chiefs

that being said im sure the whole defense is super frustrated by the refball
no youre not the only one judon is like a damn child when hes getting his ass beat he tries to play dirty
removed
removed
sucking even worse being on the jets lol

removed
being abandoned because were down multiple scores because we have no pass rush and our corners are playing awful

unfortunately our pass game sucks because our offensive line is playing terrible and no one is getting open for anything but short throws


heads up we all have bad games your team is still a good team just kc is finally playing like kc first two weeks were slow but its week 3 even if this is a loss its not gonna be the worst thing you guys have plenty of season to adjust and dominate i hope to see our teams in the afc championship

lets get it baby

earl gave up a long td to hardman last year too
earl aint fixing the problems we got in this game
no shut the fuck up
chill
lol earl would have helped but unless hes lining up in a three point stance and getting pressure on mahomes wed still be getting shit on
you trade watkins for hardman and its literally the exact same thing stfu
i partly agree but i appreciate your journalism lol
if you think earl would make any difference youre a fucking idiot
i miss him but it wouldnt make a difference you know he is smiling watching this one
so when i make a post about how we are losing and how i need encouragement because andrews forgot how to catch and out defense didnt show up it gets taken down but when you make a post about how we are losing and our defense didnt show up it didnt

judon is probably the most overrated pass rusher in the nfl

he consistently does nothing and gets stupid penalties on top of that
prob get downvoted for this before i make my case i believe we should be losing we are playing like shit lamar is panicking the offensive play calling is erratic and the defense is straight up lost but the score should not be 2710

that tripping call was nonsense and it stole a 1st down and turned it into 1st and 20 it was only 63 at this point that drive could have been points to either tie or pull ahead but it wasnt

the td pass making it 2010go back and watch the centers blatant hold on b williams its horrendous i havent seen such an obvious missed call since the saints got robbed out of the sb on that no pi call

put those together and we should still be competitive not winning not how were playing but our shitty play combined with key ref fuckups has made this unbearable thanks nfl thanks for robbing me of enjoying the game

we had such a good weekgif war was on point both teams looked good coming in then the refs and their advertised 118 years of officiating showed up and had to ruin it

oh and as im typing this we get called for a horsecollar that wasnt bc mahomes asked for it wonderful
theres been around 20 penalties that havent been called on kc
hey look another missed hold shocking
removed
andy reid and spags are dad dicking us right now
were playing very average football and were about to be back in this thing thats a sign of a gritty football team
if you watched nfl news at all you know theres a narrative about how we cant come from behind and get a win i just dont believe that

i think roman has been bad at making ingame adjustments when the plan is not working

all the games where we played from behind we were basically getting spanked when the score was even as well

fingers crossed this game is the end of that narrative
get out of here with this bs post
removed
no one showed up to play tonight except for duvernay it seems from lamar to our pass rush no ones in it to win it tonight
dobbins is averaging more than 6ypc he needs to be utilized more he is looking explosive
such a joke
relax
fucking embarrassment 100 defense was halfway decent considering the offense did nothing and they played mahomes offense and coaching were unreal bad
offensive playcalling has been terrible and our line been getting worked
why do fans on reddit feel like they need to tweet their feelings aloud with their own post every time something doesnt go right
embarrassing how can we have a team that has a bad game

been feeling this for weeks 12 but its really showing tonight ingram is looking slow out there and missing reads

time to roll with dobbins and gus bus imo
give gus the ball

maybe ingram hasnt recovered from last year
i think its the oline gus is bigger and can ram through it even if the gaps arent there

if they dont create good gaps for mark hes gonna struggle
its not ingram to me its the oline
hes not getting many holes gus got two big holes and a blown assignment
he looks slow and hes not bursting threw the holes gus has looked good and we arent really giving dobbins much of a chance to run so who knows about him but i think gus needs to be rb1 for a little bit
hes old

i actually love what im seeing were not playing very well and were about to be within 7 of the super bowl champs

not for long lol a stop on that drive would have been nice

mods can this be  like come on

could be a solid halloween costume
i want a richard thomas trace mcsorely iii jersey
tag your friends

the steelers are barely beating teams by a touchdown or less giants 2616 broncos 2126 and texans 2128 until they beat an actual good team ill be convinced its a 2 team race for the north if that was us yall know we would obliterate all 3 of those teams by 3 tds atleast weakest 30 team rn
that was just gross in so many ways
lol is that edp
those some floppy tits
nsfw please
i mean our wins are the texans and the browns
what exactly are they repeating

thats highway robbery if you got trace great trade for you
he throws dimes
must be from dundalk
they cant touch my deep ball every game im scoring im your favorite qb they call me trace mcsorley
on yahoo mcsorley has a big bump in pickups what am i missing here
que that trace mcsorley song someone made like two years ago

i hope we can play the whole season im worried
i honestly hope we hang like 65 points on them to show the rest of the nfl we angry after last week
were going to slap them stupid but it wont distract my mind of the weaknesses exposed last week
rise and shine mr jackson rise and shine
i expect to win handidly today but like cowherd said that chiefs game left a mark im gonna enjoy however much of the season we have left but im very skeptical
about how deep of a run we can make in the playoffs
bruh its 12 am
im staying positive and ready for some football time to rise and conquer from last week bitches the football team is mad whack no eliteness in dc they dont even get to be considered rivalry even though theyre so close in geography get ready too much hotness incoming
lets hope today that rg3 gets to have his revenge against the football team
i dont want to see any dancing and playing today as we feast on an inferior football team we know we can beat bad teams last week would have been the game for dancing and celebration but we blew it
not this week

im too detached
night homie
yeeees sir game day wooooooooooooooo
gooooood morning ravens fans last week we took a l on national tv and it stung it did but today its time for us to bounce back and drop some big points on the washington football team i want to see the defense continue to get after it too cause some more turnovers and maybe get a score lets go

its not even 1045pm here wtf

we finally have our qb of the future

oh yeah its trace mcsorely time

on a sidenote one of my friends actually thinks he should be a nfl starter simply because of all the hype
big dick decosta master plan gonna get a 1st round pick outta this hype train
can someone catch me up im out of the loop
i dont get it
no way lol

sweet jesus its true lmao theres a god
somebody literally picked him up in my fantasy league last night and i was like wtf did something happen i dont know about lol
lmfaooooo i met him when i was in sixth grade and he was a freshman in hs we grew up in the same place and funny enough a few months ago i got to do a pool wiring job im an electricians apprentice for traces parents
trace mcsorley becoming a meme was not on my 2020 bingo board but i love it
make him active on game day you cowards
official
goddam this stuff is amazing
man these sideline runs are awful loldont jinx us ya yutz
now look i think trace has some great potential and i think hed be a great piece on a lot of other teams like the bears off of the top of my head but i dont think we should be starting him over lamar hot take i know
not sure if being tik tok popular is desired but if so good for him lol

where is everyone one loss and we pack it in f that lets go
i literally and i say this with no sarcasm did not sleep for a minute last night i am hallucinating mildly and my kidneys feel like they are being wrung out like a washcloth holy fucking shit boys we need to get the beers flowing less than 90 minutes to kickoff lets gooooo
i wouldnt call that redemption personally but im looking forward to a win
football team doesnt know whats about to hit them
well stanley is out for this game so guess lamar is gonna be running all day
man why do i already have butterfliesjust please beat the team with no name
if we dont put up at least 60 to make a statement im gonna be pissed s
time to bounce back lets go get this w
its time to bath in the sweet golden light of the win column once again
lets fucking gooooooo

last year we lost to the browns early in the year doesnt matter came back and fucked errbody up fuck em we in this bitch
yeah lets beat football team
nothing better than a game day bold prediction of the day dev duv finds the endzone for the first time today as part of the offense and i think he can find it more than once
just had a cup of coffee and im feeling pretty hyper rn its quarter past midnight here where im at and with 45 mins before the game i hope i dont crash and fall asleep during the game
rev up them fryers theres a football team to roast
time for a stomping i guess
lamar about to drop 60 on wft
lets fucking go gas up the gus bus
the ravens could end another washington qb steering career today people with wft say a poor haskins performance could cause them to move away from him

what are your bold predictions for the day

mine are

lamar throws a perfectnearly perfect passer rating
jk dobbins rushes for 100 or more yards and 2 tds
bold prediction

matt judon gets 1 sack
marcus peters and marlo both get a pick one of them for 6

also i know we all want to see us get back to our bread and butter run game but i feel like lamar wants to address the sub100 passing yard cant throw narrative first which results in either andrews showing his hands still work and hollywood having a breakout game

hoping hollywood has a breakout similar to the dolphins game last year
we have 4 rushers over 80 yards of rushing lamar throws 4 tds
lamar sets a career high in touchdowns throws for career high in yards

bold prediction washington has less than 150 yards of total offense by the end of the game
boykin goes over 100 yards
gus the bus rips one up the middle for a 65 yard td

snead will make a onehanded miracle in the corner of the end zone

judon gets half a sack
washington fan i come in peace our team has had huge issues with mobile quarterbacks i expect the same to continue this week if you guys stop by run game dwayne haskins cannot nor will he beat you our only hope is that we get to lamar jackson early and somehow mess with his head and get him off his game and then we have got to run the ball effectively and a lot to keep lamar jackson off the field
we have 2 running plays for every passing play

aboycandream

what a dumbass at least you get to keep him
removed
not mcsorely he throws dimes
well its definitely going to be a runheavy type of day
concerning madubuike being out all this time will have an impact with how he is going to develop in this league especially when thrown in the middle of the season dont expect him to be a big threat this year just saying wolfe has been know to be injury prone he had arm problems before and seems like this is another reoccurrence we will see and i hope im wrong
just curious what is up with madubuike get injured during training camp really want him to play really needs it as a rookie
even with no young they will have kerrigan who is pretty good luckily there secondary is bad so we should still be ok although i expect lamar to get sacked 23 times today if not more
is it just me or has derek wolfe not had an impact at all i always forget hes on the team and i never see him playing on the field
f


live look at lamar running for his life during the game today
will be good be daaaaamn hope there back soon


i hate to say it but id definitely be fine losing to washington if it meant super bowl

but i also dont rely on baseless patterns so battle of the beltway lets go
nice to know in case we shit the bed today i dont think we will but always nice to have something to hang your hat on in that event
reporterroblang correct it was overtime last two times ravens have lost in washington 2000 and 2012 were in eventual super bowl seasons

github whatsnew
nah no more losing also means a super bowl
why risk lamar health when our starting tackle is out of the game thoughts we can win the game without lamar rest some rbs if you have to
you dont rest your mvp qb 4 games in because a ol got hurt
delete this
if you cant play your qb1 with a player injured then there is a massive flaw in your team
no lol
no i dont think we should ever bench lamar again after the playoff game last year did the pat ever bench brady
this is a really cocky take yall make it sound like washington doesnt have players even banged up their dline is good yea we should win this but there arent guarantees in the nfl
pretty sure this is a troll question
nfl app said he is active now
not after we just got our ass kicked less than a week ago lol
its not the 4th quarter lol

new to football or something who thinks of this

just treat the hat as an unique university of miami and baltimore ravens combination for ray lewis and ed reed then its a pretty cool novelty item to have

fine with me
im fine with this well probably franchise tag stanley and give him a better deal next year
hes gonna get tagged
2 1st

2 3rds


otherwise tag him
just talk to him real nice and tell him we need him but we only have 10 left so just look him in the face and say you gotta stay i only have this much monies
tunsil got a stupid deal from bob and its going to cost us ronnie stanley
honestly if we could get 2 first for him like tunsil i would rather have the 2 firsts and 22mm in cap savings
im confident theyll get it done and marlon needed a contract eventually too so whatever truzz
did fluker get the start loved him as a hawk
damn i would hate to lose him not too often we get homegrown all pro players hopefully we can get something done but players dont like getting franchise tagged
stanley needs to stay consistently healthy before we give him a market reset on tackles
i feel like we should tag stanley hes never misses more than one game and hes always hurt once hes signed long term wheres the motivation to play going to come from


view poll
i posted about this earlier this week he hasnt shown to be the guy so far this season that could always change maybe its just a scheme thing we have 5 players who play edge judon bowser ward ferguson and mcphee only one of those guys ferguson is under contract next year i would rather keep bowser and ward for less than judon is asking for and resupply in the draft
depends how much he thinks hes worth on the market schematically wink just isnt putting judon in a position to succeeddropping him into coverage still rushing with just him while campbell is assigned for a driving push etc but this year theres more talent on the line and judon isnt performing like a 17 mil pass rusher

wink has to revise his schemeswhich he fucking needs to no fucking excuses for his bullshit and judon needs to step up even more with those changes
we should resign ourselves to admitting that hes not worth resigning
yea on 5 mill
wow these results are pretty lopsided pretty clear what edc should do
surprised that no is winning out i thought no would be a shoein for sure
maybe for a couple mil dude has so leverage other teams know hes a fraud
resign
cool great post
i mean i know the llama and the rest of them team had a bad week on mondaybut seriously you gonna rank josh allen ahead of the reigning mvp
eh josh has had a great start lamar and the ravens have had some challenges early total body of work is still in lamars favor but allens first 3 games have been terrific
josh allen is playing better than lamar through 3 weeks its not that surprising
allens stock is at an alltime high while jacksons just took a dip by week 8 or so things will be more clear
based on three weeks hes right

nobody believes allen is better than lamar full stop but based on the 2020 season so far allen has played well in all three games
if its based on this years play through game 3 sims is correct
hes playing a lot better than lamar this year just because lamar was great last year doesnt mean he should always be ranked 1 when hes having a bad stretch
i dont care what he thinks
i think its a coin flip between the two if you are looking at this year allen has been better imo yes they played weaker teams but allen has been lights out while lamar just had a bad performance im typing this while wearing my black number 8 jersey
i saw that on the same segment one of the other analysts said he would drop lamar from the top 5 for brady too brady has had some pretty bad games this season so even if we are solely going off this year its pretty ridiculous

honestly its just absurd the reigning mvp starts with 2 very good starts has one bad game and now they want to put 3 or 4 guys ahead of him that quickly russ i can understand rodgers hasnt been all that great the last few years even if he is a 1st ballot guy so he needs to show this isnt just a hot streak and he is really back to form meanwhile theres absolutely no way allen has proven enough to anoint him over the reigning undisputed mvp thats coming from a guy that has been a fan of allens from day 1 and defended him all the time too
the slander will keep on coming
phil simms is a senile old man

its oline

the pass rush was not great last year and the dline and secondary made up for it plus its much easier to bring in a fa or trade for a pass rusher than olineman

our oline has made our run game look ordinary outside of the second half against the texans lamar also has a lot less time in the pocket than he did last year and most importantly there are no easy or obvious fixes here we just have to hope they begin to gel more as the season goes on
i want to say pass rush my instinct is to vote pass rush but i have this feeling that lamar and our particular style of offense really needs this oline to operate shaking jacksons confidence and forcing roman to panic call has been our achilles heel nearly any other team and id say pass rush without a doubt but i think jackson really needs that line to function and everything else will find a way to gel
its absolutely our pass rush you saw it against the chiefs we have no one guys who can really put pressure on the qb by himself so we have to scheme up blitzes if that doesnt work then teams can try and pick apart our dbs in man coverage judon is clearly not the answer so we have to find a guy this offseason unless we make a trade
all 3 are our biggest weakness rn
the oline is a concern but it feels like opposing qbs have all the time in the world on 90 of their drop backs this season against us you can make up for it when you play teams like washington but like we saw last week good offenses will eat you alive when they are consistently given so much time someones going to get open eventually

fix your sap

pls delete post after you have found your stream wanna keep it off books in case representatives from nfl stop by our mods dont need the added stress

volokitcom never lets me down
he was unblocked he darn well better get the sack unblocked hopefully he can get some more
i could have had that sack lol dont want to hate on judon as its too early in the season lets hope the man earns his nice salary this season plenty of football left
the magician for disappearing has appeared
i was so glad to see him finally be so open lol but yeah he needs to be more productive

me
no
no we dont
naahh love tony he was pivotal in the locker room chemistry but the play isnt there
seriously no no one wanted him why would we
id take him on a 1 year deal if we cant get anyone else

might as well if elliott cant stay healthy
marrlloooo money man marlo jr
didnt take long to prove he was worth the extension lol man is a machine
he deserves every god damn penny honestly hell end up being name the best cb in football
know whose jersey im getting next

definitely with all the players they have to resign i think its smart to look at all options
i think he would have to play great for an extended period ronnie stanley is in the argument for the best left tackle in the league you dont let a guy like him walk imo
yup if stanley is out for an extended period and our offense is moving along steadily with brown at lt that extension gets a little harder for stanley to get
ive personally shit on brown a lot since he lost yanda but if he can play reliable lt for a stretch and resigns for 1215m vs stanleys 22m you have to consider it

even more so if you can tag and trade stanley for a 2nd


damn thats a dope find
i still have that shirt
awesome
id wear the hell out of that
anyone know any website i can watch the game on
stream2watch
volokitcom never lets me down

the end is hilarious lol

llamvp
i think the commentators said it was his longest run td or not
sam koch
bdk
big koch
best punter quarterback in the league
love seeing my last name all over this reddit

let sam koch
7 for 7 no debate qbr of 158
cant argue with that its sound logic statistically speaking f he threw it 50x hed complete 50 passes

someone needs to ask the hard questions about the coaching staff like why are we not lining koch up at qb and letting him airing it out more fire harbaugh put koch in at qb you cowards
no need to change it when youre 100 correct
77 but a field goal qb needs to push it down field toward the end zone
this is like arguing if gravity exists

i can wish it wasnt so but it is
yeah hes great but trace mcsorely also has never had an incomplete pass lets not forget that
been in the league 15 years never missed a pass
if the ravens had sam koch throw it on every play wed never lose a game thats just math
the best pass in the history of all of the passes
if you knew a defense was likely to blitz would it work to bring in the long snapper and move the qb back that far so the rush couldnt get to him
tucker koch it dont matter they can do it all
make sure you put some respect on morgan coxs name we dont want anyone wondering who the third man is
such good discipline to not make it a longer gain smart play
now do judon

check my boy dobbins waving goodbye as soon as he looks upfield
i just love how he can go from full speed to near stop and then resume full speed in a different direction its truly amazing
a thing of beauty
i laughed when i saw how quick he brings the football back to his body when he sees there is another defender
good to remind the league who he is kinda feel like we should still have the most prolific offense in the league with a guy who has the capability to do that
hes speed
that oh shit moment when lamar raised the football in celebration saw the defender closing quickly oh shit and pulled it in quickly
lamar already has like 220 yards rushing over 4 games could this be another 1000 yard season it doesnt feel as likely but its definitely possible
crazy speed
he literally glides on the field
the silence is so strange
perfect pull by bozeman ate up the safety
not bad for a quarterback

touchdown andrews
i was almost certain i was being bucked
oh look another passing td
youre a fucking punk dude
lamar hasnt thrown well in week 3 and week 4

he arguably had his two best performances as an nfl passer in weeks 1 and 2

i know our fans are very reactionary so were going to get posts like this but the real question is will we get more of week 12 lamar this year or week 34 lamar

history suggests the former but you cant deny that the past two weeks have been disappointing
you said i could downvote you all i wanted but there are no enough comments to downvote can you respond to me so i can downvote again please
okay youre downvoted
what pocket did you want him to throw from dude hasnt gotten a clean pocket all year the fact that he can escape doesnt excuse that fact my guy
leading a reciver does seem to be something he can really grasp his passing stats would look so different if he could hit people in stride

you gotta love e dub man not saying we need him but the fact he is ready if it would come to that is awesome
would love him as a coach but i really wouldnt mind him being used just in select sub packages while mentoring our young safeties
weddle is one of my favourite ravens i miss that guy and his energy he gave it his all here and he just missed us being a good team
baby come back

you can blame it

all

on

me
get him as a secondary coach
id love to have him as a coach
somebody give this man a clipboard
id sign weddle to the practice squad just to have him coach our young safeties up
but what if i need him
get him on the phone edc be it to play or coach
as a coach any day and twice on sunday
ahhhhh god im having flashbacks of that 4th and forever to boyd that ran right past mosley and weddle
couldnt we sign him to the practice squad
good dude but no thanks he looked washed last time he was out there
earl will probably end up on the cowboys tbh i think they bring him in when they get desperate to make a push for playoffs
lets bring back victory ice cream monday im game
i want weddle come back and join our coaching staff so badly
is anyone else impressed with hollywoods ability to find open space this season i cant tell if its his speed or if hes getting better against nfl defenders or both but he looks great 4 weeks in
lamar over threw him a couple times he would have had at least one td today
its a combo his speed and his chemistry with lamar he also seems more willing to get those extra yards
once him and lamar iron out the little mistakes its going to be something special to watch
hollywood swinging
he good
both ravens and browns beating up on the nfc east lol
fuck the browns
fuck the browns
the difference is the ravens finish


its not super convincing wasnt to bad either ill take it
i just want to see how we play against another good team dont get me wrong im happy with getting free wins against bad teams where i dont have to stress at all but i wont be confident until we beat teams that will challenge our weaknesses
i have so many mixed feelings on this

good

marlon humphrey turnover machine

i love seeing the three headed running back monster wear a team down over the course of the game

hollywood showed up

bad

oline needs help gotta get healthy for one but id be fine with a trade or something too to shore them up

lamars got a cannon for an arm but the lack of touch on deep balls does concern me

we put pressure on haskins but still cant do it without blitzing we got no shot at beating kc unless we can figure out how to pressure with 4
roman has to get the short passing game with the wide receivers going washingtons dbs are 10 yards off the whole game
its a good thing gilmore won dpoy last year cause marlon is gonna get votes this year

3 turnovers in 4 games is nothing to scoff about
all pro marlo making that entire deal look like a steal with the plays he continues to make every single week also shout out to trace mcsorely with the hold glad to see him getting some recognition
a win is a win still there are things that need to be worked on and ironed out luckily the bengals and the eagles are the only teams left on the schedule before the bye where the month of november will be key in defining what team the ravens are against good competition like the titans patriots steelers and colts
pass rush needs to improve qbs have way too much time in pocket and screens are our kryptonite
good win today but is anybody else worried about the fact that we get almost nothing for receiving production outside of hollywood and andrews i am a bit concerned these weaker teams should be a chance to get duvernay or boykin involved and they both just seem pretty non existent outside of duv kr last week but im talking production through the air there will come a point where teams just double 1 of the 2 and somebody will need to step up and catch some passes even if it means trying to get jk more involved catching out of the backfield
one redemption game out of the way cant wait for cincy
we won by double digits the football team is kinda trash but i still wont forget prelamar when we would only win by a tucker fg
good team w and a great bounce back week going to need if the browns continue to play like they have today
pay humphrey more
it wasnt pretty it wasnt perfect but it was us
solid w against a scrappy mediocre team some bright spots keep stacking ws
feed the bus that is all
ill take the w on the other side of things i believe gus is our best rb and averret is is ok definitely our weakest link in defense judon played well but is nowhere close to earning big bucks yet run defense was the worst performance this game lamar played well also but had some concerning overthrows on a couple of targets good win though and lets move on
should be week 4 my bad
not an absolute beat down but it is a good game the off season is months away we have to get there first i am enjoying the hell out of this team

one thing that pisses me off is that short passes are just not part of our game plan ever why make the line backers move laterally also if you hit a receiver in stride short passes can go for a big gain snead would be a good target teams are playing 10 feet off our recievers they know its always going to be 10 to 20 yards

it also looks like lamar only trusts hollywood and andrews i dont disagree with him
i dont know if its scheme related or receiver related or a bit of both but its worrying the number of times lamar has to move around and wait for someone to get open part of me thinks that teams know all of romans playbook now all our opponents know the route concepts of those rollouts we used so often last year
guess we arent winning the super bowl this year since we didnt lose to the skins team
pass rush needs to be addressed like immediately
still have a bad taste in my mouth after last week win felt meaningless even tho its a win but at the end of the day its better than taking an l next week another free win im assuming october should be the easiest stretch of football weve had in long time washington down cinci next week and philly after that november will be tough as fuck steelers 2x patriots colts and titans
i hope im wrong but this team feels like the 2004 team did luckily for us the 2004 schedule was harder than this years schedule appears to be at least as it looks now but still just has that feeling
how do we stop ourselves from becoming the panthers with prime cam we currently have a defense that is underperforming with potential for big things we have no big name targets and our te is good once they lost the superbowl they were an above average team but nothing special and i feel like thats how weve looked so far underwhelming and waiting on lamar to do something to take our breath away marlo has become the only major bright spot on the defense no discredit to queen but its still early for him

i want sustained greatness not being above average with a few wow plays how do we do that moving forward

i think we need a pro bowl veteran receiver beef up the pass rush and teach the o line how to block on passing downs to sustain time in the pocket
ravens need to trade for yannick ngakoue and sign ab to be a super bowl caliber team unpopular opinion but its what i see this team needs more stars if they want to win it this year
the rg3 pass was the dumbest call of the game we didnt need s first down just chew clock and punt
dallas really outchea haha dont give up
ugly game against a pretty bad football team i agree with jeff zrebeic
31 half way through the season
good win but we didnt play that well at all better offense would destroy us plus brown and lamar need to get on the same page that extra 20 passing yards a game makes a big difference
like others have said not the prettiest win but needed after last week
defense stepped up after a bad game the oline not so much but hey a w is a w any easy game can turn into a trap game and it didnt plus the season is still young
a win is a win but i was a little frustrated how we kept getting carved up by those screens and just did nothing to stop it
missed the game can someone do a tldr im assuming o line was weak as usual
wasnt super convincing but a win is a win

our running game wasnt particularly impressive until the 4th quarter lamars accuracy especially on the deep ball was really shaky in the first half and as per usual our oline was awful

however we found our groove in the run game and most encouragingly lamar looked like his usual composed self after the interception that drive down the field was the best drive weve had all season especially from a playcalling balance perspective

also special shoutout to patrick queen after a horrid display against kc the rookie was everywhere this game and was making play after play my week 4 mvp for sure

on to cincy please get healthy ronnie and please for the love of god start duvernay over boykin harbs

lets go ravens
we seem hesitant to give ingram the rock more than 10 times
football team hahahahhaha
that was a nice bounce back for the team and much needed
let me preface this by saying that ive always loved the ravens and will continue to do so

o we have no oline simple as that id assume almost no run gets executed the way it was called the current success is due to our 4headed monster jacksoningramedwardsdobbins making something out of nothing every other play on passplays there is close to no protection to put it into perspective last year lamar was sacked 23 times in 15 games this season he has already been sacked 11 times in 4 games our passing game is unimaginative and relies on hollywood beating like 7 guys in coverage or mandrews doing mandrewsthings we have no wr threat like boldin used to be and it shows

d where to start besides humphrey and queen were below average we allowed the third most completions in the league and gave up the 6th most yards over 1000 already were playing soft coverage and it shows rushd looks good on paper for now but thats because we were mostly ahead early against bad teams every team including washington has managed to run on us comfortably our passrush is nonexistent outside of judon who isnt necessarily playing to his potential either

conclusion a shift from being a defensive juggernaut to focus on offense more was bound to happen at some point problem being you cant be an offensive juggernaut with a couple of potentially gamechaning playmakers on the defensive side humphreyqueenpeters if your oline is playing like turnstiles
such a boring game lol
610 game
i think the hayden hurst trade is looking bad news right now i think having two te1s mark and hayden and a strong vet te2 boyle was a successful mask for us lacking studs at wr

what are your thoughts do you think we won the trade or atl
i love hurst but that pick we got from it turned into dobbins and id easily take dobbins here
i think the trade was mutually beneficial dobbins will become a future staple in the offense
i think greg roman misses hurst his passing game concepts have never been great imo having 3 tes the threat of the qb run allowed the ravens to get tes open up the middle last yr they did so via hilo route combos over the middle while creating conflict for lbs via play action

the ravens offense lacks spacing imo lamar has to make up the difference by hitting on shot plays he isnt right now its something he needs to develop going forward because the scheme advantage the ravens had last yr is gone
the biggest difference between last years offense and this is the offensive line
im still not the biggest fan of rolling with just boyle and andrews when multiple tight end sets were a big part of baltimores 2019 offense however trading hurst for a 2nd round pick was just amazing value for a player who was basically third on the depth chart

its just that no midround rookie tight end fell to the ravens in the draft and there was no point in trading up for a position that wasnt a need now or 2 years down the road edit i just doublechecked both boyle and andrews are unrestricted free agents after 2021 one of them will likely resign while the other remains to be seen depends on the cap and free agent market the free agent pool for tight ends wasnt the greatest either so the ravens are stuck trying to fill the void of not having a true third tight end in the meantime

besides its way too early to decide who won that trade in the long run the falcons have way too many issues right now that giving matt ryan another weapon isnt going to make a huge difference for a good while
i would take dobbins and calais campbell every damn day
hurst wanted to leave and he wasnt producing on the level of a te1 i dont see him being much better in our system this season
worth it for our rb of the future dobbins shouldve gone round 1
nah
i liked hurst but i dont see how him still being here would address any of the issues were seeing with the team right now
i dont mind the trade the teams issues have nothing to do with receivers and everything to do with linemen
hurst wouldnt have added that much look at his number plus we got dobbins hes made up for that in the run game
just wait dobbins will start to become much more valuable as the season goes on hes just scratching the surface right now

the opening drives were ugly im not sure why weve suddenly decided that the speed option needs to be a mainstay in our playbook there were some drives though where we felt like the same old ravens with a great mix of passing and rushing the dude just outsmarts himself a lot
guy is out smarting himself im not sure why we dont see more slants or drags with our speed guys but what do i know
ive felt like this for a decent minute and i mentioned i think last week but he needs a cocoordinator someone to handle the passing side because he is awful at calling passing plays and taking what the defense is giving him if i see that damned bootleg play again imma lose it
that long pass by rg3 that was intercepted was insane run 3x and punt and the other yeah does not get that last touchdown
he just doesnt change the offense at all this is the exact same offense as last year which most teams have figured out already we need him or someone else to change the playbook as we go you cant have the exact same playbook 2 seasons in a row and expect teams to not figure you out

we need to learn from the chiefs and 9ers offenses we have the personnel to become an unstoppable team if the play calling is great

put hollywood in the slot and andrews out wide alone like the chiefs use duvernay like the niners use deebo and aiyuk
i have to agree i thought this offense supposed to be revolutionary it was last year we have some new weapons this year but its gonna take some time getting the timing down with them
seemed like we were rusty but back to normal after chief loss but it solidified that chief are the afc team to beat right now even though we nearly tied that game we looked like we werent in it this was much better and gives us things to improve on
i noticed the first drive after half we looked so much better cause he wasnt getting cute with the play calls
over our coordinators as a whole tbh
i think its the wrong implementation of a team desire to be more creative obviously we need the offense to evolve be different and show new looks vs last year to grow and develop the problem is that i think greg does this without looking at the situation theres a reason a lot of teams script their first driveplaysyou get into rhythm then you pull the creativity
how awesome would it be to have jim harbaugh as our oc

marlon humphrey says that to get verified on twitter he had to change his fruit punch handle to something more normal marlonhumphrey

but he wouldnt mind if people start calling every punchout a fruit punch
fruit punch and juiceman
trace mcsorley

when will we finally bench lamar
sam koch mustve died or sum
this is sam koch erasure and i am not gonna stand for it

the who
new backup qb

coming into this week i was expecting a pissed off pin the ears back physical game from both sides of the ball its hard to criticize what was a major blow out but at the same time having the football team throw up over 300 yards seems like an issue zone coverage had some major holes lbs drop depth that are going to be scary against a good tight end or slot receiver additionally our run coverage looks porous honestly gonna need more against the bengals

the offense seems to be knocking off some rust i appreciate the effort made in the passing game but the flow and play calling seems off im general maybe it just me
the screens are still gashing us i feel like outside runs are still a problem but id have to go back to verify i know screens are bad just off memory
well im honestly not impressed with the defense as good as lamar is its hard to put pressure on a young qb to consistently put up 30 points every game

on offense what really concerns me is the offensive line lamar is getting a lot of clean pockets and i know hes mobile and that affords the team a little bit of leeway when it comes to line play but if we want more down the field passing hes gotta have a clean pocket to go through his progressions
yeah something feels off team isnt physical enough or something also i feel like im close to being done with boykin hes too finesse for his size
the team has changed but the play calling hasnt
im glad that they came away with a win the team is still a work in progress but im optimistic
this hasnt been received well but people need to take the purple glasses off

we have issues at pass rush enough said

o line struggles but i do expect them to get right as the season progresses weve seen it happen before

now this is what people dont like to hear our receiving corp just isnt good enough its not terrible but it isnt enough

hollywood is our best receiver he creates separation but doesnt do much after that he keeps the defence honest hes our number 1 but he isnt a true number 1 we need a true playmaker someone who is reliable and can bail us out and make huge plays when needed
the rest of the corp just feel like bodies to me make catches in space when its right in their hands pretty much a mediocre group of guys

edit this isnt me bashing on hollywood hes a good receiver just isnt the answer to being a number 1 this also excludes andrews who is always great when he shows up which is most of the time
were winning but it just seems like theres another couple of gears we can go into the running game isnt doing much the passing game hasnt been as explosive the pass defense hasnt been that good

defensively we have a lot of inexperience with the 2 safeties and queen but our corners are giving up a lot of quick easy plays because they play off so much run d looked better today but its washington i dont think they have a feared run game anyway

offensively the passing game just looks out of sync we heard all off season of lamar getting better at deep throws but hes missed an open brown more times than not and every other pass seems like a struggle to complete i think its a lot to do with scheme roman isnt a good passing coordinator never has been the concepts and routes arent as efficient like last year when the run game opened everything up

all in all its a good win but we dont look like the super bowl contenders i thought wed look like this year so far
yall just got used to winning team played good today we cant just demolish every team that we play its the nfl
i think what feels weird even after victories is that we are trying to win like a regular passing team is evident that this year we are rushing less the ball as you might notice we are having a lot of 3 downs and out drives i dont know if this is part of a plan but it is what it is with todays game we sit as the 13th best rushing team in the league
really seems like the team doesnt have as much identity or fire as last year its hard to match last years success but it doesnt even seem halfway there
here is my thought why the fuck did we draft dobbins when we could took a wr or olineman at that spot
idk tho it seems like defenses across the board are shitting out whoda thought the browns would put up 50 idk i think the lack of preseason and training camp is letting some high scoring games go on our points allowed per game is still very good
i think lamars groin is still giving him issues it would explain how his cuts look slower and why his platform seems off for no reason sometimes

i think the o line is still struggling to gel and losing ronnie for a game doesnt help

i think we need a pass rusher who can command attention on the edge down after down

i think were better than weve looked so far but we might not be as good as we were last year hopefully lamar shakes it off the line gets it together our issues on offense are correctable without changing the roster

im not so sure if thats true about pass rush

all in all it was a win but i feel like something is missing compared to last year and that makes me feel a bit nervous despite the blow out
tbh were a lock for the playoffs especially with this schedule weve got

knowing that id rather use the season to just try random shit and see what happens especially in the passing game i know the run game is our bread and butter but we need to dial in our passing game for when were down were not always going to be up 3 scores and we have a very realy problem as soon as were down

i also dont think the starters on offense right now are the guys who will be starting come playoff time i can see some shakeups coming with our receivers running backs and oline i think a lot of the weird play calling and change of personell is because of this
ever since stanley has been gone lamar has been getting sacked more than usual
we should learn how to defend a screen pass
pass rush needs to be better i dont care that judon had however many sacks it just flat out needs to be better

oline needs to tighten up

wr need to not drop passes and lamar needs some work on throwing some

still very early on in the season i always say that we never know what kind of team anyone has until like week 6 in the season
from my perspective i dont watch you guys all the time roman has been figured out this is requiring lamar to hit some deep shots which he cant

when you think about the fact that vick started his first 39 regular season starts and lamar only started 26 of his 35 regular season games it is hella more impressive

edit vick did not start the first 6 games he played
weve got to stop sitting him really pisses me off haha
its so dope hearing the records lamar breaks when he doesnt even play all 4 quarters of most games we win unlike most other qbs
flacco had 7500 pass yards in his first 34 games
mahomes has 10000 pass yards in 34 games

the pass rush did better today i was more frustrated by the poor response to screen plays in large part stemming from the dbs playing way off the receivers on every play
what is it about our pass rushs performance all season that gave you high expectations today
saw he got injured during the game and havent heard anything about him since
he was back in the game after the injury so hopefully nothing too serious
he went back in after it looked like he just got the wind knocked out of him
this seems like the most plausible scenario for the ravens idc if judon got 2 sacks hes a liability against good teams cowboys look like they need defense so they might want
him plus earl so that frees up half of his contract

trade judon and a 2nd for a 3rd trade our 3rd and a 5th for robinson
ill have whatever hes having
dont smoke crack
lmao youd be the second worst front office executive ever after bill obrien
3rd and 5th for arob lmaoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
bill obrien is that you
the bears arent giving up arob for a 3rd
people acting like judon still isnt our best edge rusher
judons over scrutinized at this point hes our best edge rusher lose him and our best edge becomes tyus bowser
if we trading judon to texas id like to get michael gallup in return
nope if we make any trades it needs to be for a proper position replacement for yandas hole thats where this offense is struggling the oline is fucked because yanda is no longer there
am i the only one that watches our pass plays and sees that people dont get open but then watch other teams and they seem to get open easily like i watch the redskins run screens and they are effective but we run screens and they dont work for shit
the only play that i truly hate in this offense is the outside lateral where lamar purposely takes the hit and throws it off to the running back this play is doomed to be turned over its a matter of time
what other teams are you looking at unfortunatley our leading wr is marquise brown boykin has been a major disappointment this year and that leaves willie snead who just isnt an elite level wr
yeah im with you been saying the same thing all year our guys are covered completely i think romans passing scheme is weak this year i dont know much but thats my basic observation
i would love to see a combination of brownduvprocheandrews with hill in the backfield soo many options in the passing game with these guys just think about it quick screens middle screens wheel routes with hill just soo much speed on the field with lamar
we literally are putting up 25 or more a game easily and people are more pessimistic than bengals fans
yeah i was watching the bills game after our game and i was amazed by how open the bills receivers were kinda missing john brown a bit
lets call it what it is ravens played like trash today against one of the worst teams down vote me all you want but its true
am i the only one who appreciates punctuation and capitalization
only marquise brown really gets separation versus defenders mark andrews makes plays in man coverage a lot but he doesnt get open as much or nearly as far

lamar can throw guys open and look down the defense all day but that doesnt mean shit when boykin gives up half way through his route snead fights with a db for 20 yards boyle is blocking or not fighting for separation etc
when will we ever get a true number 1 how come this organization cannot develop receivers to save their life im so tired of seeing bottom feeder teams develop better wr then we can our division has seen some of the best receivers in the past 10 years antonio brown aj green landry obj and we have fucking nothing
we need ab
am i the only one begging him to be bothered by the benching of lamar late in games why does it feel like theyre limiting him late last season it made sense but its week 4 hes getting hit all game anyway
i wouldnt die on this hill when the field was fedex field
sounds like someone had him in fantasy and might lose haha
hes getting hit all game anyway so lets let him get hit more sounds like a good idea
a healthy lamar is better than an injured lamar that padded his stats in garbage time
how is it limiting him lamar won the game the game was over stop staring at stats and being sad that he didnt get the garbage time yardage it doesnt matter
i kinda agree i want to see us use garbage time to get lamar the record breaking type stats 230yds looks better than 180yds

all he had to do was show the dk metcalf from last week haha
the what not to do film is usually just the jets game
his reaction was pretty funny
the legend yanda told him about this listen to the greats lamar
damn
i knew harbaugh would hate it i remember harbaugh chewing out a linebacker in a preseason game for a premature celebration returning a fumble or an int i dont remember who the linebacker was but i think it was a week 3 game against the team formerly known as the redskins
i was very annoyed by that play thankfully no consequences resulted from it hell learn and grow from it
watching the replay a couple times it looks like he was frantically scanning for an opportunity to celebrate but everything was happening to fast to see the last defender until there last second props to those dbs for hustling until the whistle blew could have been a game changing fuck up
yanda told lamar not to do that in his rookie year

first we had the elite dragon

then we had the llama

in comes rg4th quarter


next is big dick mcsorley

now we have sam mr perfect koch

when will people finally start recognizing the ravens as the ultimate qb training facility that it is
growing up i did not spend a lot of time around american football so i am just now learning the rules of the game beyond the basics of touch downs and field goals

questions

i see a lot of criticisms of the defense but it also seems that people generally think that campbell queen and the secondary are relatively strong with the understanding that as a rookie queen still needs some more time to develop so when people are saying that the defense needs improvement is this really focused on the defensive line
similar to the above i see a lot of critique of the wide receivers but have also noticed positive comments about snead duvernay and hollywood brown is this a situation where there are different opinions about the performance of these guys or when people say the wrs need work they are referring to the other wrs who are not snead duvernay or brown
there is unanimous agreement about the weakness of the oline obviously there was going to be risk and weakness there with yanda retiring but why have the gmcoaches not done more to address this are they hoping that the current team will gel and improve or will they be trying to bring in more help for these positions soon

observations

there is an also an almost unanimous agreement on the weakness of the pass rush i do not disagree but i think there are similar if not more severe issues with stopping runners clearly they focused on this after the playoff loss last year but to me it has appeared to continue to be a problem at points in each game so far this season
some people usually not ravens fans are quick to criticize lamar for every small mistake given out oline is what it is i dont think that we would the 3 wins that we have with many other current nfl qbs

thank you for helping out a newbie
1 yeah almost all criticism defensively is against the line because we are to your point one of the worst pash rushing teams in the league and that makes it harder on our secondary because they have to cover players for longer but when we blitz more then the standard 34 we leave less people in coverage and still cant get to the qb so its more likely a receiver will be open we need a outside linebacker edge rusher who can properly play on the edge and win 1v1s against the other team to consistently generate pressure on the qb
2 your second question is tricky we think we have good talent and potential with the receivers but they arent quite on the next level yet while hollywood is pretty good we lack a true no1 that can make contested catches and win 1v1s guys like amari cooper deandre hopkins julio jones michael thomas devante adams these guys can produce no matter the circumstances
3 the third question is i think the other areas of weakness we needed to address in the offseason and because we didnt know yanda was retiring till free agency already started and right before the draft so there was not that much time to prepare we have a bunch of young guys in the offensive line with room to grow and we hope they will but yanda definitely is a big loss
also another point people love to hate lamar for various reasons and he gets the most criticism in the nfl hes not allowed to have a bad game without being drawn and quartered but he will continue proving people wrong and i believe he will bring us a couple super bowls hopefully sooner rather then later
welcome to to flock truzz
the problem with our defense is we dont have any pass rusher that can win by himself consistently which forces us to blitz to get pressure which puts allot on the rest of the defense if the blitz doesnt get home the wrs are just young and outside of hollywood just not allot there as of now and even he seems too have some issues with releases when people get up in his face
good bot
pass rush and run stopping should go hand in hand suggs spoiled us when combined with a strong edge setter we need a very good pass rusher that can also set the edge consistently when called on to do so sadly these dont grow on trees

were not running the table from here playing like we did today and last week our offense is so one dimensional and were fucked if we have to play from behind until proven otherwise defense has been giving up huge plays and our pass rush aint there were so fortunate we play cincy and philly these next 2 weeks so im assuming we will win those 2 but no way in hell do we run the table playing like this
the guys just gotta keep getting those reps in no preseason well be ok all 32 teams have to go through this well get hot like we usually do no worries

the chiefs are the defending champs for a reason they are a complete squad that brought back almost everyone from the championship team plus they are led by the best qb in the game right now they are the nfls equivalent to a raid boss

we got our asses destroyed but thats fine ash ketchum lost plenty of pokmon battles before he became the best itll just make when we finally beat them that much sweeter hopefully on the way to this years superbowl

also fuck the steelers what kind of crack are you on to think theyre even in the same conversation as the chiefs
in the words of aaron rodgers relax
the steelers arent the chiefs

the ravens in the lamar era are 221 against teams not names the chiefs in the reg season

also the steelers arent superbowl caliber they are overrated their offense in particular is average our offense is in flux right now and is probably still better than theirs
its because youre a realist you can see we have issues regardless of us being a good team you can see that this team still isnt quite there to take that next step and win a meaningful game

we may have won yesterday but that team to me didnt look like a super bowl contending team i just hope we can continue to put it together and improve over the season so we will be ready for the playoffs we really need to get better in a few areas pass rush oline and the receivers
it was a horrible performance it happens go through every super bowl champion throughout history and most of them had belowpartohorrible performances during the regular season

truth be told i dont think this ravens team has a passing game thats good enough to go blow for blow with kc their passing game is too efficient and explosive to completely slow down that said anything could happen in a playoff game and the ravens could still go on to win it all there are too many variables to believe one bad dictates a season or playoff performances
cant win them allgotta move on
if the ravens can move on to the next week you can too

move on your negativity is annoying
we dont have 3 te sets now that allows for an extra blocker to give lamar enough time for plays to develop and sit in the pocket to throw with complete accuracy or keep it and zoom past defenders for 8 yards our rpos were crazy last year because we had options and we were unpredictable

but with yanda and hurst gone we are left onedimensional and greg romans playbook isnt that creative or imaginative to figure out once we dont give lamar enough chance of success to relax and run through his reads and options

im just going to say what nobody wants to admit

we are not as good or complete of a football team as we were last year greg roman and his playbook has become stale and predictable and were about to get exposed even more this season if things dont change drastically and soon were in a rebuilding year after this post off season and we may be for some time
imagine how lamar and the rest of the team feels
remember there were simple mistakes that turned that into a very different game andrews dropped 11 points which is uncharacteristic also defences improve and learn more as the season goes on and our young linebacker corps and safeties are gaining the experience they need to use the zone coverages that could deal with kelce hill and watson more effectively our pass rush isnt something that can be fixed overnight but improving linebacker coverage skills make blitzing less dangerous

itll be alright
haha i watched the ravens 2007 blow out loss to the steelers on monday night to lessen the pain against the game we had against the chiefs that night
the ravens bounced back to beat the team from dc can they make it 2 in a row

what are you guys thoughts on this they are atop the division although the teams they have beat arent particuarly strong
the steelers and the browns will remain competitive the rest of the year i think the afcn crown will not be a cakewalk
the steelers are always a concern
every team should be a concern if you go into any game thinking its gonna be easy youre setting yourself up for failure
yes and the browns are too now their defense still isnt great but their offense was firing hard yesterday and im a bit worried about that
yes they always are same with the browns

the cowboys scare me because i just dont think we can keep up with them regardless of how bad their defence may be

that will be a game where we will need to completely lean on the run and take up time
yes have people forgotten why we say fuck the steelers around here
100 the afc north is the best division in football again the road still goes through us though
fuck steelers
the question is are the steelers what their record says they are
of course only a clown would say otherwise
they are our biggest rival they will always be our biggest concern honestly the division title will come down to those 2 games
absolutely on the bright side their offensive strengths dont line up with our defensive weaknesses they dont have a shifty back that can break one to the outside i am not a conner believer they like to attack the second level which is also where we are strong defensively

they have the best defense in the league though i think
if pitt can beat kc in the playoffs pitt has a pass rush and then get obliterated by us thatd be great
nope
as long as ben can stay on the field we must always be weary of the old fat fuck leading the opposition
always
they havent made the playoffs since 2017

anyone who is actually scared of them is too wrapped in the hur dur were rivals bullshit

they have a good defense and a decent offense we outclass the fuck out of them this year
just a few observations i had now that ive slept on it overnight

1 the oline looked a little better yesterday crazy since we were missing an allpro tackle especially the guards im not saying they were leaps and bounds better but i think we saw better play overall against a good defensive front

2 the defense was fine you give up yards in a game thats just how it works teams are targeting our linebackers because they know were weak there though queen was everywhere yesterday im not a huge fan of how far off our corners play but i trust that peters and hump make the play my only concern is how theyll hold up against players who can make them pay on yac how good is marlo my lord

3 the play calling remains suspect sometimes i think gro has fell into this lamar cant throw narrative and feels like he has to prove people wrong im not saying run the damn ball all the time but i still feel like were struggling to find our offensive identity we need some fresh plays that allow lamar to be lamar

4 completely my opinion here but i think lacking a 3rd te has thrown our game off a little as well im not criticizing the trade i think jk pays off but i think not having that third te has made it easier for teams to figure out the play type we know andrews is usually catching and boyle blocking not all the time but a fair amount of the time we need that te who can do it all decently so teams have to second guess it

5 i dont know if its the line game plan or play calling but lamar looks like hes playing a bit rattled with that being said his competitiveness is so fun to watch i remember watching him scramble for like 3 yards on a 3rd down yesterday no way in hell he was getting it but he still stuffed the defender and tried like hell

6 we need pass rush help i think thats universally agreed on however its not like elite pass rushers are cheap or even available i really think we need to take a look at clay matthews as a veteran presence to help

7 wr is an issue hollywood plays well enough but they double him up because hes our only catching threat aside from andrews when hollywood does make a play he is either immediately tackled or has to go down to avoid getting wrecked id really like to see some slants with him and duvernay let them actually use that speed

8 good teams beat bad teams when theyre suppose to and we did i remember the old days where we would of went in and lost by 3 points because we played down so bad i just dont think we will see the level of dominance we saw last year partly because teams are studying a lot of tape and our line isnt the same however be happy about the win some of you all act like we lost i get being upset about the chiefs i do but damn man life is to short the whole doesnt matter cause we cant beat the chiefsa good team narrative is exactly what the media wants you thinking im not saying ignore the teams flaws half the fun of football is talking about how a team can improve but dont rob yourself of actually enjoying the team

just my thoughts more than open to civil conversation about how we think we can improve the team in general have a good day my fellow flock members sorry for any typos
i agree with all of your points

the offensive line did pretty well considering the front they were up against and stanley being out

the running backs do seem like they are getting off to a slow start in most games not sure if that is the play calling with halftime adjustments or what i do think losing hurst hurts right now but will payoff with dobbins eventually and hurst wanted the trade anyway

and yeah lamar doesnt seem to be playing with as much confidence so far this year the passing game has seemed pretty weak and i think a veteran possession wr would help significantly if one was available
i like the wr point while watching snf i saw how sf utilizes their wr letting the young guys make plays the ravens need to get proche and duvernay in as much as possible it is no surprise that the ravens cant produce wr because they dont freakin use them so frustrating knowing there is talent in proche and duvernay that hasnt been seen cause they arent given the chance look at the steelers using their guys this is the biggest flaw this team has and risk need to be taken for big rewards letthemplay putemin
i dont think the problem is with lamar and the receivers i think its with roman being unable to scheme a good passing attack our wrs are constantly running into each others areas running decoy routes and just not getting open quickly on routes roman needs to understand that he needs to call more slants screens and quick rpos to get opposing pass rushes to stay back which will take pressure off the oline its infuriating watching lamar hold the ball while everyone goes deep and nobody gets open he needs to diversify the passing attack or were gonna be in trouble i can already see signs of the offense getting stale and opposing teams picking up on it lamar is good enough that we can play average offensively vs bad teams but vs the elite playoff teams that shit will not work i honestly think if we lose in the playoffs again this year in an embarrassing way we should take a look at firing roman
3 i think they want to get lamar more passing plays in games where were up to identify where he struggles that way they can work on it for situations were down id sacrifice 30 point wins where we only run the ball for 15 point wins where we can improve as a passing team

4 i think having ricard has 3rd te isnt working especially when boyle isnt a great receiver either if andrews is off our 3 te sets become worthless hurst was great at blocking and receiving making him so valuable for that scheme i think you have to dedicate ricard to fb and find a 3rd te that can specialize in receiving that way boyle goes back to blocking and we get a 2nd option from andrews when he gets shut down

6 we need pass rush help badly no one is getting through even when we blitz i really want it to be that judon is being focused in on and thats why he cant get home but they need to shake up the front 7 somehow whether its clay matthews cam wake or even just activating madubuike they need to change

7 kinda leans into 4 where i think getting a 2nd receiving te opens up this offense but i also think they have way too much faith in boykin and snead duvernay and proche should be on the field more to run a chiefslite speed kills offense same with using dobby and ingram in the passing game im so tired of seeing boykin be in 1on1s with a cb and get beat when he has a clear size advantage
hey mr wvu ravens im also a wvuravens fan from jackson county
if the sb was played tomorrow we could win it and thats the important part if we play our best we can beat any team out there its all about how to get the best out of the team
regarding wr they need a yac guy to compliment hollywood they dont need a superstar they need someone who can get a few extra yards after catching a 5 yard pass basically what andrews does but faster and somewhat less physical
we dont have 3 te sets now that allows for an extra blocker to give lamar enough time for plays to develop and sit in the pocket to throw with complete accuracy or keep it and zoom past defenders for 8 yards our rpos were crazy last year because we had options and we were unpredictable

but with yanda and hurst gone we are left onedimensional and greg romans playbook isnt that creative or imaginative to figure out once we dont give lamar enough chance of success to relax and run through his reads and options

im just going to say what nobody wants to admit

we are not as good or complete of a football team as we were last year greg roman and his playbook has become stale and predictable and were about to get exposed even more this season if things dont change drastically and soon were in a rebuilding year after this post off season and we may be for some time

baltimore also has never been home for elite wr1s save little sprinkles of vets in their sun setting days weve always been about elite defense and pretty good running also why our tes tend to do ok as well dont think thats good change anytime soon for wide receivers

hollywood cant catch shitty throws from lamar as a result of the weak line with yanda gone and not enough options or time so hes playing shook

this is not the same team from last year
the coaches didnt suddenly get stupid they didnt forget the success with the pistol last year

the goal isnt to score a touchdown on every drive the goal is to win games capping off the regular season with a win in the super bowl let them try different game plans over the regular season and win let them see and learn let all of our future opponents have no idea what we might be doing from play to play

greg roman was the oc for a historic offense last year not just historically productive but revolutionary built in secret with just him harbs and a handful of other guys in some secret lab in the basement of 1 winning drive he did not become an idiot overnight

lets enjoy the ride while they try different things and force future opponents to be ready for anything
on point 8 im glad this sub doesnt accurately represent the majority of ravens fans in the baltimorecounty area everyone im around enjoys the ravens week in and week out thankful we can have success and rally around our young core the people who continue posting negative stuff the chiefs loss arent actual fans this team is going to win often and for a long time truss
agreed with everything you said especially the lack of 3 tight ends

i want to add we didnt hit our stride until week 6 last year really there is still time also some of you saying that was an ugly win have never watched an ugly win you want to watch an ugly win watch us at the steelers last year now that was an ugly win
someone needs to step up as an impact 3 receiver brown and andrews are great but they need someone else to take attention away from them im hoping duvernay or boykins make a leap by the playoffs they need to punish teams for doubling brown and andrews

lamar has not had a 100 yard receiver not named marquise brown or mark andrews that needs to change
the oline looked a little better yesterday crazy since we were missing an allpro tackle especially the guards

they also didnt have chase young

not to totally diminsh their play against an otherwise solid frontbut thats like us not having suggs or ngata for a game back in the day
i think the play calling can be a major issue on this years super bowl run defensively the offense knows what play were running before the ball is snapped offensively once we are down the play calling goes to shit we need help on this
on dobbins and paying off is there something in blockingscheme that dobbins has had a hard time picking up he looks so dynamic with the ball in his hands definitely seems like he has a lot more home run potential than ingram or edwards at this point surprised he isnt getting more carries yet feels like it has to be about something besides just his ability to run the football
i cant remember the last time gro ever ran the ball in a typical run play twice in a row its so typical 1st down run for 3 or 4 yards 2nd down pass usually incomplete 3rd down and 6pass

i dont like our offensive play calling one bit also our pass rush like everyone knows is baddd
good takes thanks for sharing
wr has been an issue for years
1 agreed they look better when we still have the option to run could be worth looking at a center or guard early in the draft next year significantly worse play all around after losing yanda but they were better yesterday

2 peters plays off the line because he baits qbs it is frustrating until he makes a big play defense was good except against the screen but thats because we have to blitz so damn much to get pressure and the screen is easy to run against a blitz weve been bad at covering screens for about 20 years now

3 playcalling is awful gro created a system where lamar could succeed but at this point we need someone more creative that will use our strengths i said it last week that it looks like were trying to prove to the world that lamar is a good pocket passer

4 i think we could use another decent te but we desperately need a possession receiver hoping bateman or olave is available in the draft next year lamars interception yesterday was caused by an extremely weak cut by boykin hes a great blocker but we need someone to run routes better and be more physical going after the ball still want to see duvernay with hollywood more speed kills

5 agree 100

6 clay matthews could be a minor upgrade without killing our cap but it may be worth being aggressive here a stud on the edge could turn our defense into a monster

7 already discussed this

8 yes but the flaws are obvious and need to be fixed if we want to go anywhere in the playoffs
the only thing i can say about this game is your point no8 good teams beat bad teams when theyre suppose to and we did there was a point in recent memory when we couldnt i still remember the game against the bears and rookie trubisky in 2017 which cost us the playoffs with this team you dont have to worry about these games and that is a m a z i n g

other than that wft is not a team with which you can analyze strengths and weaknesses we still have the same weaknesses we have had for many seasons

bad oline some improvements have been made because of more consistent play for stanley and addition of zeus jr however i think he has taken a step back this season and losing yanda is very noticeable lamar makes up for it a bit but if we want to become an offense that passes more lamar will need a clean pocket

absolutely zero pass rush i get it you can only get those players with high draft picks but this has been a huge problem for many seasons which the front office has not addressed either trade up or buy an fa who can do the job but those rarely if ever hit the market and there is a reason for that clowney was not the answer and neither is clay matthews also for those wishing we had payed zadarius get real we didnt have the cap and he was not the answer either we need a bonafied future hall of fame pass rusher and if we need to draft up to get one then do it

running back by committee this is one of the worst strategies in the nfl or riding the hot hand its fucking bullshit you need a number 1 rb who can run and catch ingram can do both so make him be the workhorse insert dobbins and gus every now and again but ingram is the guy and that is the end of story next year it will be dobbins but enough of this committee crap

veteran leadership we just dont have it im hoping it can be calais because he certainly fits the bill but he is still too new to be the voice of the lockerroom ingram is a cheerleader lamar is still too young i also havent gotten the impression that lamar wants to be the voice he is more of lead by example kind of guy which is fine but he has also demonstrated that he loses his cool and composure in key moments we dont have ray we dont have reed and we dont have suggs i have not gotten the impression from any of the new guys that they want to be the leader you may shrug this off but the lack of leadership is a real thing in my opinion

coaching i love harbaugh but he is not a leader he is a cheerleader it works when there is a source of leadership in the lockerroom but right now there isnt any and there hasnt been any for some time now the players are young some may develop into leaders but it remains to be seen he also gets outcoached in big moments like he did by bellichick in 2014 or how he repeatedly does by andy reid in recent years how the fuck did he not know fischer was eligible cmon man greg roman i really appreciate what he has done for this team we are a way better offense with him than any of the previous coordinators baltimore has had since gary kubiak however he has a ceiling which is currently being met can we win the super bowl with him i dont know san francisco could not wink does the best that he can with what he has got

that turned out way longer than i thought it would go figure our real schedule begins week 8 we have steelers colts patriots titans etc i fully expect us to win every game until that point

tldr same problems we have had for many seasons mediocre oline zero pass rush lack of leadership and limited coaching
blame goes all around first things first wft beat themselves as much as we won cannot look at this game as an indication of anything other than the nfce should be moved to the acc

did not like draft pick with atls 2nd would rather have hurst than dobbins we didnt need to pick up a hb because of ingrams ageinjury edwards performed well everytime he has had a chance and that continues this year edwards has looked like the best back by far followed by ingram dobbins has had one good run we could have found talent late or in free agency for that position

roman needs to be replaced i hope you guys havent forgotten how long harbs holds in to coordinators no matter how many games they cost us it is like our offense from 2013 week 10 of 2018 does not exisit in your minds


romans playcalling is uninspired and not influenced by our strengths at all he rarely makesa team prove they can beat plan a for more than 23 drives before he bails on it

wink has to blitz when we cannot get pressure within 10 seconds with 4 pass rushers something we did frequently with zdsjudon and suggs in 2018 i think pass rusher has been our biggest need for 2 years now

we need a true number one look at the bills josh brown is a fine reciever very much like hollywood but lamar would need to be rodgers accurate to consistantly hit deep balls in such a small window

lamar has played like ass the past 2 games plain and simple hollywood boykin and andrews have all created seperation lamar has been terrible at placing the ball decision making still sound though
i mean stats dont lie koch has a 100 passer rating and tucker caught an 80 yard pass against houston s
why s this is a good take we need receiver help
the only other kicker that can catch that well is kareem hunt
anyone got a link to the tucker catch
nah bro just call the 50 yard line as being in range for a field goal justen tucker can kick those all day

how dope would it be to have a qb and kicker competing for most points scored while still leading the pack in each of their respective positions for overall rating
downvote because you need to learn how to spell corps
this but unironically
not to be the take a joke too seriously and kill the fun guy but koch has actually been the 3rd stringemergency reserve qb in the past when a starter was injured on game day this is already a thing
visit browns and youll find out how their team is one gigantic juggernaut thats going all the way to the super bowl first week of the season that sub was teetering on mass suicide
are you saying their fans have high expectations gtfo that would never happen on this sub
it looks like the browns are going to be competitive

give them a break its been a long time since theyve had something to be excited about
theyre 31 and finally found their identity they have reason to be excited lets not pretend we are suddenly a juggernaut because of one season eagles and panthers were never able to keep up with their dominant seasons so we shouldnt expect to either winning the division is going to be tough this year im excited to see lamar vs ben
they finally realized that baker is just a game manager and they should keep running i wish they paid baker first
heres the thing why should we visit rbrowns theyre 31 for the first time in a long time ofc theyre hopeful
cool

let them be excited an upstart browns team is exactly what we need to be competitive at the highest levels we shouldnt be going into any game thinking its an easy win

this team needs to stay sharp at all times and earn their keep iron sharpens iron
the minute i talk shit is the minute we start going down in flames so good for them let them be happy let our play do the talking
who cares i dont care about the browns as long as they keep that shit on their sub and dont bring it here they can do whatever they want
our kicker is keeping pace with their qb in points scored

their argument is invalid
they beat a bad dallas team they are more juggernot than juggernaut
and im fine with that all i want is that sb trophy this year
they look good this year let them have it are fans not allowed to be excited when their team is good the entitlement and pretentious attitude on this sub after 1 great season is mind blowing to me and not to personally pick you out but this post is a perfect example of it who cares if other people are happy
i noticed it with myself as well im certainly not immune to it and if you wanna see a sub on mass suicide watch you couldve looked here on monday night weve turned in to a bunch of spoiled kids
lmao why wouldnt they be optimistic its their subreddit stop lurking
who cares
browns will be competitive but that defense is ewww right now though i still think it will be ne buffalo tenn balt pittsburgh kc with the colts and browns fitting for the 7th spot in the playoffs
theyve beaten teams with a combined record of 381

relax theyll come back to earth sucks that they dont have to face the chiefs this year though
to be fair they do have more onpaper talent than we do

you gotta be on crack if you think we have single receiver thats better than jarvis landry or obj right now

we also dont have 3 te sets now that allows for an extra blocker to give lamar enough time for plays to develop and sit in the pocket to throw with complete accuracy or keep it and zoom past defenders for 8 yards our rpos were crazy last year because we had options and we were unpredictable

but with yanda and hurst gone we are left onedimensional and greg romans playbook isnt that creative or imaginative to figure out once we dont give lamar enough chance of success to relax and run through his reads and options

im just going to say what nobody wants to admit

we are not as good or complete of a football team as we were last year greg roman and his playbook has become stale and predictable and were about to get exposed even more this season if things dont change drastically and soon were in a rebuilding year after this post off season and we may be for some time
hello all

is there a player that would make an impact that might be available and we have the space for

my hypothetical is jj watt he has 2 years left on his contract owed 15 and 17 respectively but i believe this year could fit into out 13 available due to 4 games already being played texans are 04 and going nowhere fast he has come out as being frustrated who wouldnt be but he is a well liked guy in the houston area lastly we have a 1st round pick for next year where as the texans do not not to mention they are over the cap by 10 mill might be a dream scenario for them moving for watt would be a win now move for sure
dude is so loyal to the texans im
not sure hes the answer im not really sure who is

id like to see a true number 1 receiver again not really sure who
nahh watt still an inside hed go where derek wolfe goes not judon
i dont think giving up a 1st for an aging watt who is usually hurt is a good idea but hell i dont have an alternative lol
we need edge rusher
would not even give away pick 32 for watt at this stage of his career with those contract numbers i think the most realistic target is ngakoue if the vikings continue to tailspin and determine they want to rebuild
we shouldve gotten melvin ingram and i still think we should pursue him

chargers can take it to the chiefs because they have edge rushers who can go 11 with their tackles we have douches collecting a 16myr check
the salary cap the next few years is going to be lower because of covid and lost revenue on top of that we have some big talent that we will need to pay

draft picks will be more important now than in recent memory i dont see any scenario where we trade high draft picks unless we get some by trading our own guys which isnt happening
melvin ingram at mid season they wont pay him and if they are out of playoff contention they will shop him we could probably get him for a 5th
ngakoue minnesota gave two picks to go all in this year they suck they may want to tank and get picks back but i dont really like giving up early picks and wed have to pay him soon itd be basically do we pay stanley or pay ngakoue but it would fix our pass rush
allen robinson wouldve been a good trade target in the off season
baltimore for kansas city i could see this happening might be the missing piece roman needs

there were legitimately fans going to other teams subs saying that they were jumping ship making former ravens fan coming in peace posts it was embarrassing
please remember that this ravens team has better personnel this year for the most part than we did last year while we look out of sync and discombobulated we didnt have a preseason or full training camps and though our rushing attack looks lackluster now with our three headed monster we lost a hof og and are still only averaging 45 less rushing ypg this year than last vs a tougher scheduled first 4 weeks

long season ahead well be fine
i hope more bandwagoners jump ship so we know whos a true believer and whos fake bigtruss
ah yes last season our fans were extremely upset with our run defense against a legitimate running attack its a good thing our season didnt end exactly because of that concern after going 142 and getting a first round bye

after last weeks game im firmly in the belief that i dont take anything from this team unless its against a truly formidable opponent crushing bad teams and lamars counting stats looking great dont mean a thing if we get humiliated in the first round of the playoffs again
i believe this team is still top tier in the league that being said there are areas of concern and acting like they dont exist is just fooling ourselves

our oline is nowhere near last year good sure yanda retiring was always gonna get felt there is no way we would upgrade at that position but it seems like everyone took a step back without him skura will get better since he is coming back from injury and phillips is a rookie so the line will get better

our pass rush still sucks like it did last year we have a defense built around coverage to allow creative designs in the front but it isnt working as we would hope for the chiefs proved they are still far ahead from us and terrible teams are putting up points

our offense also looks like is slower and cant perform as good as it did last year weve seen how the team has to punt and kick more even the fake punt looking to start a spark since the offense looked like it lacked life

that being said with the team not looking that good to the eye they are still putting up a lot of points and the defense is still making plays and getting turnovers which is a statement to how good their floor is and thats something no one ever mentions when they talk bad about the team they will get better because their problems are fixable and we have the coaching staff for that i think we lack pass rush talent so that will remain something to work around but there is no way we lack offensive fire power to feel like this offense wont ever click going forward like some people put it
i would like to say after week 4 last year we signed a bunch of guys and made a trade for mp so ill be confident after we do the same this year if not im kinda afraid
you know there were plenty of good takes in that thread a lot of people saying we need to trade for ramsey we got peters instead somehow a lot of people saying our run defense was suspect and that did eventually bite us in the ass a few different people saying losing mosley hurt us thats why we drafted queen people saying tony jefferson and et3 were struggling both gone

sure there were some people writing suicide notes but there were a lot of takes that looked quite good in retrospect if im being honest
our fanbase is very pessimistic and probably will be for a while i guess god forbid we lose to the steelers or some other decent nfl team

who cares peak at the right time the playoffs we can beat anyone if we play our game well
the issue isnt that we started last season bad and got better why cant we this year the issue is is that the same struggles we had last year are being seen again pass rush struggles a receiving corp that at a little better than average at best absolutely falling apart in a big time game when the spotlight is on us play calling goes out of the window after 5 mins of a game we are trailing by 3 points its these reoccurring stand out elements that have not been fixed which are the biggest concerns if they arent sorted this season will end much the same as the last
were 31 and have a pretty soft schedule just enjoy the ride folks

houston is 04 imagine being out of the playoff hunt already
there are 2 i repeat 2 teams this year that have looked consistently great thats the packers and to a lesser extent the bills every team is going through some shit there are 3 teams who were getting division winning buzz that are at the bottom of thier respective divisions houdalsf everybody needs to just stop freaking the fuck out
we have abysmal pass rush and below average pass protection

just because judon had two sacks and we blitzed less doesnt mean we arent in trouble

we got serious pass rush issues that wont just click or go away when we play above 500 teams

we also are playing an olb at mike who is waaaaay too raw i love queen pick but hes been exposed or out of position quite frequently there were three instances where fort board and peters motioned or pointed his assignmentcoverage and queen didnt do it on sunday

not a major worry hes a rookie without otas but still a worry and hell be picked on by better vets like big ben

i dont think ppl being upset that we didnt address these issues from last year are wrong to be upset these are going to be our reason why we lose when it counts

we need to trade for an olb still cant set the edge to save our life and we have 0 time before a dl gets through causing lamar to scramble

gotta prioritize guard and olb at some point not everything is fixed with ab or another wr like 90 of this sub thinks
the difference now is we know who we are

a good team with a mediocre oline nonexistent pass rush and a gaping hole where a 1 receiver should be

i just dont think we have enough still looking forward to enjoying the rest of the season
glad i sat that thread out lol

gotta say im looking forward to being called out on my reactions in the kc thread when were hoisting the lombardi later this year
my biggest worry for us is how easy the steelers schedule is similar to ours but no chiefs and pats at least the bills are pretty spicy this year that could be a fat l for pit
painful to see the comments on the titans in that thread so true
no i do not agree we traded away a starting te for dobbins he hasnt shown me that he is anything we could not get without sacrificing hurst our 3 te sets are no more couple that with yandas departure and our run game looks weak
ok check it out we blow out teams week after week because we have a beautiful stacked flock on all sides of the field the problem is though that since we blow teams out every week we never get to practice playing from behindclutching close games so when we play teams like the chiefs or the ttans and start struggling we have no idea how to play because were so used to being up by 8 touchdowns and letting sam koch be our qb

in conclusion if we werent so good wed be better
this theory only works if the ravens actually use the three kc games the lac playoff game the cle game last year and the tennessee playoff game as building blocks to get better when playing from behind
been having this exact thought flacco played in soooo many close games the years leading up to his super bowl run

edit to be clear i dont think we lost to kc because of this but the ol ravens were more experienced at winning ugly for sure
the ravens lost to kc because of a disastrous set of play calling from greg roman and because of an inexperienced defense
having experience in close games is obviously unteachable but good teams should be able to stick to what they are good at or adjust and still be just as good thats our problem we cant adjust its one way or the highway we need a lead to be productive when we postbox and go into a sling out match any team could beat us
this is why its way too early to say lamar isnt good playing from behind hes lost 6 games hes literally as experienced in playing from behind as the other first round qbs halfway into their first season
we lost because of defense is a perfect match for mahomes if our blitz isnt effective which we call i believe over 30 of the time then we wont be effective with his receivers the kc oline dont even need to hold up for that long anyways

we lost to the titans because we couldnt run the ball against them nor could we stop derrick henry we are probably one of the only teams who are a run dominate teams more last season when we get behind and our playstyle chews a lot of the clock how are we supposed to make comebacks

lamar is becoming a better passer one who will be able to spread the ball and consistently make deep throws unlike the two he missed last game in the first half but to be fair we kept trying to go deep instead of taking what was underneath
motion to give rgiii first half pt and have lamar come in to close out tighter second half starts


noted from the win over wft including

1 understanding patrick queens up and down day
2 ravens return to effective and balanced nickel play
3 metrics and reasoning for a dialeddown pass rush
4 wahingtons screen game
as i look at the pff grades for all of the first round linebackers chaisson murray queen and simmons they all look the same although simmons is the one getting blistered for it


its just a bad year to be a rookie anything
so what im seeing is that we got an absolute stud who will grow as the season progresses

queen is already disruptive let him get a solid feel for what we do and boom we have out linebacking leader for a few years at least
seeing queen struggle in coverage and knowing his responsibilities in the defense just makes me think how amazing cj mosley was straight out the gate in his rookie year it probably helped having daryl smith next to him
i have full confidence in this team to take back the division and at minimum be the 2 seed we have been fairly ok in the injury department knock on wood our running game is probably more potent than last year and lamar has looked really good throwing the ball


he is

6th in qbr

completing 68

7 tds to one pick

our defense is giving up

186 ppg

975 rush yards per game

our offense is averaging 307 ppg that is a 12 point differential between the offense and defensive ppg average

our turnover differential is 3 as long as we keep that turnover differential positive and keep such a wide margin between our offensive ppg and defensive ppg average then we will absolutely win the division and get a top seed
i think a lot of people are just spoiled by the second half of last year

even before lamar we played super off and sloppy the first couple weeks at this point maybe its a harbaugh thing

remember we were 22 at this same point last year with a bad loss to the browns and a lot of fans thought we were toast

now if were playing like this come week 10 11 then thats a conversation to have
i should be happy with this on paper we look potent and efficient and yet the eye test says otherwise something feels off could it be we have everything in place but the players havent jelled yet or is the play scheme not fitting our talent is it because i was spoiled last year and now have high expectations on how an offense should operate i cant answer this question right nowor wont admit its the third option but whatever it is i hope it gets resolved
i think were gonna have a dominant second half of the season after the bye

haha thats great great block from fluker there by the way
dobbins i have the balljk
that free rusher was going right at where lamar began the play in the pocket you can see lamar sidestep while behind dobbins and the free rusher ends up to lamars left i dont even get it
these guys make me nervous when they start celebrating before they get into the end zone
lamars inner voice

oh yeah i got me a td im gonna celebwhoah whose that guy yikes
that was landon collins who missed that tackle by the way did he suddenly become shit when he went to washington because he was a stud the last 2 years
i think he was asking for the ball but we see what we want to see still a gem
52 what is u doin

justin tucker is outscoring more half of the quarterbacks in the league lets get some love for the greatest kicker of all time

whats your favorite justin tucker moment

edit fixed spelling im a dum dum
justen
when he kicked the football
i still think about that failed fake fg run in sb47 he would have had a touchdown if the 49ers hadnt had the foresight to put patrick willis in the game

nothing bad came of it since obviously we won but it would have been a god tier meme moment and people would still be bringing it up any time tuckers legacy was discussed
i wear his jersey on sundays justin is the goat

but he owes this legendary career to luck

hear me out

week 2 of the 2012 season ravens patriots afc championship rematch primetime snf or mnf cant remember rookie justin tucker has replaced billy cundiff whos 32 yard miss in the afccg dashed the ravens superbowl hopes its a close game coming down to the wire baltimore drives down the field late in the 4th down 2 get close but the pats defense holds tucker comes out to attempt the chip shot 21 yards i think to give baltimore the win as time expires the storylines and parallels are obvious

tucker lines up the pressure is on he kicks the connection between the word field goal and choke is still strong in the mind of everyone on the field

and he does just that he chokes

justin tucker faltered under the pressure his kick sailing wide right patriots defenders celebrating

but the football gods smiled upon him that day the field goal was so short that his errant kick passed directly over the upright and still counted

and justin gets his clutch reputation that he lives up to for the next decade

but if that field goal was one yard longer if a ravens player hadnt churned out a few more inches a patriots player brings a raven down just a bit faster justins choke would have been exposed he would have missed the rookies confidence shattered and baltimore would continue to carry that tag of choker

justin tucker was chosen by the football gods to be what he is today the goat
justen tucker whos that
oh lort

right decision to sit him and heal up against a shitty team

once the afcn really gets into divisional games its gonna be a bloodbath

also really glad we smacked cleveland before they started to get their offense rolling
steelers 30 against teams w combined record 111 im not sold browns against 381 but their run game is lethal im higher on them that steelers to take second but we could have 3 playoff teams out of the afcn

good divisonal games ahheaaddddd
afc north snapshot

steelers are 30 for the first time since 2010
ravens are 31 or better for 8th time under john harbaugh
browns are 31 or better for the first time since 2001
bengals 121 would be tied for first place in nfc east

yes we had a bad game in kc it was bad we didnt play our best football and kc had a perfect game plan against us ok bad game against the best team in the nfl and one of the best offenses the nfl has ever seen it sucked yes but it was week 3

we won by 14 against washington and there are takes out there like we arent as good or theres something wrong or fire this coach hurriedly trade for players etc are we the only team that has fans like this now and the only team that gets shit on for winning by 2 tds its like if lamar doesnt throw 5 tds every game people start freaking out and the media starts thinking theres something wrong

i get we set the bar high last year but we hopefully all remember joe flacco and preflacco years where any win was great and when the team didnt play amazing we easily lost now our not good games apparently are winning by 2 tds everyone calm down pleaseeeee

totally agree when rgiii went in it was a 21 point game what more can you ask for most games in the nfl are decided by a possession or 2 and are competitive being upset that we didnt win by 30 is so unreasonable every team is maybe 3 injuries away from being a sub 5 win team so its not like there are huge gaps between most teams
look im happy were winning im happy i even get to enjoy football playcalling pass rush oline is sus

we need those things to win a super bowl the people who are echoing the same concerns as we were last season minus playcalling and oline are more than validated in their concerns were not saying the sky is falling but we are saying that this shit needs to be addressed or were looking at another 1 and done in the playoffs
dont trash the flacco years 2008 2014 was a great period for this team
marlon humphrey just did a player interview saying that he felt the same way about the game but he also mentioned that lamar told him that we shouldve scored more
we cheer we boo and we praise and we criticize this is what fans do its ok deep breathes dont take it personal its not about you
last year also saw a lot of new bandwagon fans a lot of them are pretty easy to disappoint
frankly i wished we wouldnt blow every team out id rather have close hard fought games where we could actually learn some stuff the team needs to learn to play from behind and in tight situations

we also need to figure out our personnel our rbs seem to take awhile to get going our oline still needs work and our receivers are still shit some people need to start moving down the depth chart

fluker was solid at rt yesterday and i think he should start over obj

boykins just aint it start duvernay and hollywood or at least move snead up

gus and jk should be our 12
when youve been eating prime wagyu steak for 3 months straight and then all of a sudden your given school cafeteria meatloaf its gonna take some time to adjust your expectations

with yanda gone and without 3 te sets to give lamar all the time to make mvp type plays our play calling and production will never be as electrifying as it was last year

defenses have figured us out and its because we traded away hurst and our receivers arent elite to adjust and help lamar out also our line just isnt as good as it was last year with ronnie healthy and yanda not retired

greg roman had a winning formula and then we just traded it away for jk dobbins who we only use when ingram needs to catch his breath or in garbage time
you guys think you can get to the sb you like your chances more than this year
the entire time ive been a fan of this team weve been the underdogs that grind out wins and knock down the giants i honestly hated the hype last year being on top all season didnt feel like true ravens football it was stressful i love seeing the media doubt the team its who we are
last week the sentiment was that judon was trash those people are quiet this week
maybe its just me but the run game especially outside the hashes looks strange this year i feel like they arent able to get past the edges nearly as well this year dont get me wrong i know lamar literally just busted a 50yd sprint down the middle but sometimes it seems like hes getting contained a little bit better this year is it adjustment by the defenses is our line just not as good or am i just crazy
our line is nowhere near as good as it was and were running 3 wrs instead of 3 tes its a big schematic difference
no yanda a banged up stanley no hurst
simple

1 lamar cant do his job unless his line does their job and does it well

2 the line cant do their job because theyre just not talented as they were last year with yanda and an extra te to block giving lamar all the time he needs to make mvp plays in the air or on the ground

3 without the time lamar needs to let plays develop or successfully complete accurate throws our receivers cant do their job

4 our exciting unpredictable play calling without all the options that a talented line and an extra te blocking gives us goes out the window and now were a very one dimensional football team that is very predictable for good teams our playbook and play calling needs to be better
seems like a combo of not having yanda defenses not worrying about the throw too much and not having a preseason
theres a lot to it but i think the biggest thing is were splitting the carries between 4 guys and the only one who has looked good is gus carrying 3 rbs just hasnt been productive ingram hasnt looked great and when lamar carries defenses dont look surprised

the other thing is we havent really opened up the passing game very well we need to connect on some deep shots to back the defense up some or at least keep them honest

i dont have game pass or whatever subscription lets you see coaches view so im speculating a bit just based on the feeds i can see but it seems defenses are playing close to the los this would leave more deep shots available but weve missed several of those to hollywood already

i keep seeing the hurst trade mentioned but i doubt that has made any difference we had 3 tes but they werent all on the field together that much we mostly run 2 te sets
i know yesterday was the first game back he was activated but i can already see his role start to diminish to the point where he may not even see the field unless jk gus or ingram gets injured which is a shame because i think if we used all four backs our offense would be unstoppable
why would the offense be unstoppable if all four backs are used hill isnt better than anyone ahead of him i dont remember him playing more than a handful of meaningfulnongarbage time snaps last year other than when ingram got injuredrested anyway
what does justice hill do as a rb that dobbins doesnt do better i dont see why you take away from dobbins touches and development just to get hill in the game
i dont see how rotating justice in would make our offense unstoppable lmao

yeah he was good for us but what the ravens need moreso is someone like a dk metcalf someone that can block well and go deep
he was great he was the guy i wish flacco had more during his career but he never clicked with lamar
had no chemistry with lamar and i doubt even he wanted to play for us after the season where it became obvious that we will be a run first team

im ok with hollywood
he is basically what hollywood is and hollywoods ceiling is way higher as another commenter said we need someone like julio dk mike evans or what dez bryant was a big bodied wr that can go up beat dbs based on pure strength and catch the ball getting a wr like that would also free up all of the double teams andrews has been fighting through this season
john brown near the end was lackadaisical i was pretty done with him at that point
he did not want to stay wasnt up to us he wasnt a fit for lamar at the time his production dropped off a cliff when lamar came in for flacco thats no mark against lamar or john they just didnt work out well at that time
maybe jimmy was just on a snap count bc he was questionable but averett playing 87 of defensive snaps was giving me anxiety the whole game lol id play more levine in dime packages and keep clark at safety
jimmy smith couldnt stay healthy when he was young managing his load now just makes good sense lets keep him healthy for a playoff run
jimmy dont play in october wake him up when the playoffs start
averett has shown improvement this year
one desmond king please

wait what 13 touchdowns in what metric
did you edit chris redman off this list
the dead are rising and theyre scoring touchdowns

im beyond grateful we have him as our backup but i had really hoped for his sake that some team would give him a shot at qb this year surely hes better than both the bears qbs
he showed why he is a low end backup with that terrible interception
i was sad for him that he wasnt able to play to a full stadium washington fans would have cheered him on
is jj watt a legitimate trade target now i know how much he means to the city but without a head coach 04 and limited time left performing at this level maybe going to a contender would be an option
maybe but i dont think the texans would go rebuild mode with watson at the helm plus we dont have the cap space to get him
jj did so much for houston during the hurricane recovery i love and respect the man but at his point of career might as well be a hometown legend and rightfully so
i doubt jj is leaving houston ever
we had a better shot of trading for jj watt nonzero chance in exchange for a 5th round pick when bob was gm
jj watt is making something like 17m a year which is way too much

for comparison he currently has the same amount of sacks this year as judon and nearly the same amount of tackles

hall of famer but hes washed he has only had one good season since 2016
if you stick with a coach through 04 not having a coach cant be much different
that man will never agree to waive his no trade he lives houston way too much to leave plus his wife is playing in chicago now so thats probably the only team with legitimate leverage
i wish we couldve gotten clowney

hey everyone im wondering what your favorite barrestaurant in baltimore is to watch games from
le couch in the northeast corner of your living room
stay the fuck home you assholes
dude keep yourself safe and stay inside covid is on the uptick right now and its not worth it to get sick for a football game
maxs taphouse
city limits

is this some kind of new teen titans
her dropping him is the pick rgiii threw
stay save and stay the fuck home
i really appreciate those of you are who willing to civilly discuss opinions about this

im going to continue to keep threads like this open for that exact reason above and to stay in line with the earlier announcement i made this year about sensitive topics in this sub

unless your comment is completely devoid of anything that adds to the discussion it likely will stick around to receive the subs updown votes
nflbitecom

stay home and watch for free drinks are cheaper at home as well
what about me i live in new zealand

jk we dont have bars to watch the nfl
a lot of these bars are being really responsible i wouldnt say someone should never patronize a barjust dont be stupid about it if my wife and i go out to grab a drink we just grab a table thats at outside and at a safe distance and be careful about it
itt a whole bunch of idiots that dont realize they can infect other people by going to these bars

good reminder op
ugh i was going to respond to some comments on this post but it would probably be like talking to a brick wall at this point people just continue to wear masks social distance and if you have to go to a bar make sure its outdoors
bears fan dropping by thank you i feel crazy with so many people actively trying to prolong this
the bottom of this thread is exactly why america has 200k dead in 7 months
i like pickles
im kinda glad the denver flock postponed gatherings
fuck coronavirus but stay safe and stay indoors
yeah reading comments here shows me exactly why the us has been a disaster handling this virus compared to other countries yall some dumb motherfuckers stay the fuck home
there are plenty of bars that are handling it safely and responsible i say go support them and if a bar is being careless then fuck em but really its not hard to protect yourself and everyone around you by following simple safety guidelines
i wish i could stay at home working weekend sucks especially now with covid protocals oh well
is there a discord for the sub that we can all join on game day and get drunk together
the last mf in america that should get the virus caught it lol yall niggas aint safe stay inside
so true i wish i was with each and every one of you cheering and cheersing its not the end of the world if you miss the game please be responsible we can overcome this virus together we are almost there if we put in half the work that these people neighbors family idols first loves randos at the gas station dedicate to this gamewe can overcome this adapt understand overcome thrive
1 come into this thread

2 scroll down to the bottom

3 get depressed
but not the protests though
ive just been having a bunch of people over to watch games that way we dont even have to halfass pretend to wear masks
whats your goal complete elimination of virus as a healthy 24 yo guy who lives in a studio apartment why cant i support my local bars let people live their lives and make their own choices
how about people make their own choices
dude positive rates are like 2 no deaths wear a mask and be respectful and youll be fine most places have outside seating as well
so i understand your argument that by going out to bars etc people can become carriers even if they arent sick themselves and infect others but if you arent going out to bars or these other places yourself then how are you in any danger if someone is that worried about becoming sick or contagious then they should be staying home full stop

the only argument i can see is that by going out to bars you increase your likelihood of becoming contagious and infecting people at essential businesses that people need to visit at that point though it seems like youre splitting hairs by telling people walmart is ok to go to but fuck you for enjoying a meal at a restaurant i think your real issue should be with your local governments for allowing nonessential businesses to operate not at the people visiting them within the rules set out by the governors

ill probably get downvoted but id be curious to hear others thoughts
i cant live a significant portion of my life in hiding from a virus ill wear a mask in public and keep small social circles but i cant stay in a bunker for a year
removed
question which scenario is more likely to give you covid

1 going to wal mart
2 going to watch football at a bar

reminder wal mart has been open this entire pandemic but walmart is essential nope you still run the risk of spreading it to others and getting it yourself life really does have risks and what if a vaccine doesnt come out until late next year please dont tell me your plan is to sit at home all day until then and preach others should do the same nope sorry that isnt going to happen m8

i totally get wearing a mask and distancing sure but come on as long as we wear masks we really oughta be able to go to a fuckin bar man as much as i wanna do my part to stop corona these people saying we shouldnt be going out and instead still staying at home all the time just seems so bizarre
removed

i love how nicaragua never closed anything down never changed anything and they are basically completely fine this virus has a 9999 recovery rate and everyone out here virtue signaling like they are actually saving someones life all the while the economy is dying hard and people are committing suicide and dying from 100 other things at exorbitant rates

just stop with these posts

removed

the first clip the stadium was packed with purple man i miss the fans
montana to rice manning to harrison koch to moore

all of those throws more difficult than mahommes touchdown passes tonight
all

look what happens when you dont get outcoached its crazy that the patriots had so
many defense players traded leave in free agency or optout but the coaching still helps them contain the chiefs that we couldnt even stop on third down smh i even think our defensive personnel is better but our coaching isnt
look what happens when you just run the ball down kcs throat instead of selling out for the air game after you go down a few points
very valid and depressing point lol refs just bailed them the fuck out tho
its the pass rushing kcs offense gets disrupted by it mahomes had all day against us which allowed all those deep routes to develop we had absolutely zero pass rush and its a huge achilles heel for us you can say we abandoned the run and we did but it wasnt going to matter based on how easy our defense made it for their offense
yea was just having this conversation with my brothers l we played horrible agaisnt chiefs and this pats game is proof
thats not pass rush thats good coverage

our dbs got lit up mahomes was throwing to wide open receivers as soon as he got the ball
absurd for once i agree with belichick

edit or an int either way shouldve been a turnover
mahomes now a confirmed golden boy two hand touch rules apply
yeah no more friendly gif wars with these bitches the chiefs are the new patriots mahommes whines and complains more than tom fucking brady
that was an interception these refs are trash
definitely an int he was throwing it away ironic seeing brady calls go against the patriots
when you play kc you play the refs next time we face them i want the ravens prepared knowing that absolutely nothing will go our way no use complaining about it
that was some bs
that was a bull call
that was reallllllllly bad
i hate the patriots but yeah that was bad literally everything goes mahomes way
if you wanna be them beat them this sub is soooo preoccupied with the chiefs
we should have looked just like the patriots running it down their throats and controlling the ball for the majority of the game its not that hard apparently
someone should show wink martindale this game as well
most likely wouldnt help because it has happened a couple times before last weeks game ravens tend to be up on their opponents in most games and he clearly doesnt adjust well outside the original game plan
the patriots pass rushers actually got home
2610 chiefs running the ball clearly worked wonders
i said this so many times in the game thread they dropped everyone into coverage and rushed three it was super effective too

for the life of me i cannot understand how wink let mahomes light us up
god this game is pissing me off the chiefs run d is terrible we should have slaughtered this team but we had horrible offensive and defensive game plans didnt run the ball on offense and blitzed way too much on defense
theyre doing what you have to do to contain the chiefs control the top with a strong running game and keep mahomes off the field for some reason in all of our losses we get spooked early abandon our strengths and try to compete in a shootout which mahomes will win 100 of the time
horrid refs as expected
bill and mcdaniels doing an amazing job against the chiefs so far if they had cam theyd be winning this game by a lot
hey look what happens when you run and commit to it 17 runs and 16 passes
holy shit im now more embarrassed our game against the chiefs
they said butker tucker lmfao
i think this is showing us just how much creativity on defense matters vs the chiefs mahomes will pick apart standard defenses now hell still probably turn it around this game but it shows how to contain that stacked offense at least for a half
bills a genius
why didnt stidham start the fucking game lol
that ne secondary is locking shit down god damn
these refs i mean wtf are they seeing the dude had his hands on mahomes while trying not to fall himself and gets a flag

then kelsey slips and its pi wow
butker is definitely no justin tucker
this is a weird game for a belichick coached team to be making huge mistakes left and right
hoyer just fd up big time took a sack as time expired going into the 2nd half score is 63 with the chiefs leading patriots could have at least tied it
butler sucks lol

edit auto correct butker
butktner stinks
if the chiefs played like they are tonight against us we win by 20
rip to the patriots hopes this game
anything you see the patriots doing that we can do for future chiefs matchups
the pats have managed to keep mahomes off of the field and drive down the field with freaking brian hoyer for almost the entire 3rd quarter


edit and hoyer screws the patriots again by getting sacked and now losing the ball when they had a chance to at the least tie the game
i love how they keep promoting the falcons vs the packers

nobody is watching that game except their fans not with this game on lol
you guys are watching the wrong game lol only kidding
hoyer may have as many passing yards as lamar did that sucks
the trick to playing mahomes is to slow down the game and if anything we sped it up
romo cursed that kicker lol
well its nice to see patriots fans sad at least
i think i found the loophole to beat the chiefs you need to catch them off guard with a qb that has no or next to no nfl game tape

so obviously the next time the ravens play the chiefs they need to unleash trace mcsorley and announce him as the starter moments before kickoff

seriously though youve got to keep running the football chew the clock and leave kansas citys offense on the sideline easier said than done however even when the chiefs make a mistake they seem unfazed by it and pick things right back up as if nothing happened
fuck the refs
i want the pats defense so bad
mahomes is not as on as he was last week but damn i think we may be overestimating where the ravens are right now theyre not what they were last year not yet at least
its all about coaching harbs is the issue

im pretty sure we also just arent good at scheming our wrs into space
hill works the way he does because this chiefs offense has so many threats you have to worry about and respect equally to the point where gadget plays like the chiefs run with him and hardman are almost impossible to predict are coming
because hes almost always double covered defenses commit a lot more attention to him because we have no other threats except andrews
because the chiefs have so many weapons that can also make big plays if we get behind and roman forgets to run the ball defenses just have to cover mandrews and brown and we got nobody else to make big plays
andy reid x1000 gro
im not even asking for anything that fancy just try to get hollywood on more drags and slants simple stuff
hill reminds me more of a young steve smith sr in terms of playing style fights for the 5050 ball contests deep balls fiery

hollywood cringes and falls down at even a hint of contact im a shameless ravens homer but this team cannot scout draft and develop wrs they just cant and i dont know why hollywood is not looking like a wr1 so far he is undersized but more importantly he plays undersized hill is undersized too but he doesnt play like it
brown isnt hill lamar isnt mahomes
why dont we use brown duvernay the way kc uses hill i know brown isnt hill yet but his speed makes him a threat and they use him in so many different spots for distraction

ftfy
because hes not hill and for that matter the ravens arent the chiefs
because roman doesnt know what he has
because teams can double brown and shut down our entire offense assuming andrews is also focused in on whos gonna be the big threat snead boykin

you double up hill and you leave watkins and hardman 1on1 youre gonna have a bad time
am i the only one who thinks hollywood isnt that fast hill is on another level
brown has magnet hands granted some drops and plays didnt go his way but thats expected hes money i hope he his proud of what he is and has accomplished rock on marble

tucker is so consistent that he is forgotten lol
i said it last week and ill say it again

respect the goat
i remember when greg zurlein was the best kicker then when dan bailey was then when chris boswell was all the meanwhile tucker was better than all of them really says a lot when kickers peak seasons are pretty much on par with tuckers average seasons
third game in a row with a missed kick i wonder what thats like
this game is pissing me off chiefs either crush their opponent or play like shit and get the game handed to them never in between mahomes should have been picked off twice this game and of course the fumble
thinks hes hot shit cuz hes playing for the chiefs
best kicker
if you take a shot at the goat you best not miss
he actually seems below average
the nfls greatest kicker

justin tucker is this your king
butt kicker
chiefs fans need to shut up about him being the best kicker also when did mahomes throw a td i thought they were both rushing tds
tuck doesnt care if the talking heads see him as the best he knows who he is and what he can do thats all that matters let em talk if it makes them feel better
oh and then the dumbass mnf crew was saying there is no one better than mason crosby kicking 40 yards cant remember exact quote i was like do you not remember him missing 5 kicks in one game a couple years ago
he isnt on legatrons level
man fuck tony romo hes god and clarvoiant when he gets something right he needs to be called out when he says dumb shit like this
we dont need a chiefs kicker running commentary
whats the deal with this and what i mean is who cares
yeah i dont know what the hell you guys did to him he was coming right off of the best game hes ever had and then the second we play you guys he turns into a bears kicker
chiefs won another one

judon got all suggs and zadariuss clean up sacks
watching him win one on one pass rushes and get to quarterback is frustrating i dont have confidence that anyone on our team can do that in a consistent basis right now
yeah but he was only soso in his time in baltimore either gb knows how to scheme him better or hes a rare case of an overpaid free agent living up to his contract

but youre not wrong hes become a beast
i think hed be one of my all time favorite ravens if he was still on the team
ravens picked judon over him essentially hindsight is 2020 but would love to have zadarius rn
another sack
as a wft fan i feel the exact same way about preston smith he was decent with us 58 sack a year guy pretty good pressure rates across from kerrigan goes to gb along w zadarius and starts balling tf out obviously i love our ends now but makes you think theres a reason why these guys were decent and both became nice after getting overpaid
im glad we have zadarius smith however

i feel like belichick would like trace mcsorley
rgiii for sure would remember that you dont get 4 timeouts in a half
please no i want robert to have the chance to woo some mofos again but i just really enjoy him as a raven does that make me selfish


view poll
i no longer hate brady i find the bucs fascinating now mahomes and the chiefs are my new hate team
absolutely not flopping is totally subjective knowing how incompetent these refs are this just gives them more ways to ruin the outcome of games

ill pass
as much as i want to say yes subjective calls like that piss all of us off far too often we really dont need to add more subjective calls
that was literally like watching neymar it should definitely be a penalty and carding people for flops in soccer hasnt been a perfect fix but it has helped

also the refs will fuck up no matter what

hate to say it but our loss was worse pats got screwed by the refs with that mahomes interception they also were playing with a back up qb



that being said i really hope wink was taking notes on how the pats absolutely shut down kc for the first half
this game was way closer than what ever the hell we did
qb play hurt the pats the game plan was perfect also the refs blew some calls too
this is wrong but ok
2710 at halftime compared to 63

lets not get ahead of ourselves
is 1 nephew

delete delete delete

we got smacked its fine everyone move on well see them in the playoffs maybe
delete this nephew
it was like 36 going into the 4th right we looked embarrassing the pats at least gave them a run for their money if that interception was called correctly they had a chance to win op is delusional
if you cant beat em be insecure about it lol
yeah no
you still have time to delete this before the morning crowd pours in
comment your score predictions
no predictions but burrow is throwing 300 yards with a terrible o line this is not an easy game on sunday
lamar is gonna come in heated 400 yards of offense from him alone burrow will start hot but start to fall apart in the second half ravens 38 bungles 24
we are going to be shocked that this is going to be a close game burrow is not flustered by blitzes and is accurate as hell he is going to habe a career day against us if bengals didnt have an awfully slow and undisciplined defense i would be extremely worried


i will be downvoted to hell saying this but burrow will be on mahomes level in a few years
ravens 41 bengals 20

the bengals are building something nice their qb is smart and continues to improve i just think the bengals will be overwhelmed just like the texans were

i think our offense will have a big day i also think our dl will take over and smoke their ol
lamar gonna put up 50
bengals fan here its not even going to be a competition lamar is going to run all over us this defense is bad
aj green back lol this should be fun

make burrow escape the pocket the direction you want him toosmack him with queen when he thought he was safe i wish him best of luck but 3 picks and a fumble would be nice
this is gonna be a tough game burrow is really good despite his offensive line sure there defense is trash but we still have to stop there offense also even though aj green has disappeared this season thus far he always shows up to play vs us
we might not like to hear this but the run game is our best defense our actual defense is trash hopefully the run game shows up on sunday if not theyre just going to screen pass us to death

every ravens player each and every person in the organization is extremely valuable rock on you beautiful souls
i mean i still cannot figure out why they have him running the safety blitz on mahomes instead of you know a safety

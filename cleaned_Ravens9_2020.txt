after this week it seems like people are either on the side of greg roman is the reason for success and we should keep him and consider moving on from jackson or people are saying jackson is fine but needs a new oc things are gonna get ugly if we dont start winning again
its both lamar isnt fully a pro passer yet and romans passing concepts are uninventive and at the same time he abandons the bread and butter too soon oh also dont fully blame roman for the passing game thats on david culley
i see it more as a flacco v cameron
start winning again you make it sound like were on a 5 game losing streak
i dont understand how you can watch the ravens play and not realize the team is riding on lamar jackson
i think theres a little of both i dont think you can reasonably deny theres been some poor decision making in lamars part in the last couple games as well as some less than accurate throws and theres also been some questionable situational play calling happening the problem here is that everyone is panicking were a 52 team and we would be 61 if we had limited penalties and turnovers in that game without question were just fine r e l a x
the issue is that when you look at the play style of lamar and how roman guides his offenses the two on paper should be a match lamar is a versatile type of qb who is average in terms of accuracy and above average at reading defenses he has had his fair share of mistakes though roman consistently holds the top running offenses and has coached a qb similar to lamar kaepernick

the issue is that roman is trying schemes that dont fit lamars play style this year lamar has looked uncomfortable passing and our oline hasnt helped with giving him time

my take is that roman is the issue here he has never been able to be the oc for a passing team and lacks the ability to create schemes that help out mobile qbs that have average accuracy either stick with what works or get rid of him roman has the ability to be amazing but cant seem to figure out how to coordinate a pass offense
im not in the antilamar jackson camp outside of thinking hes on a downturn currently but i dont think most people in that grouping actually want to move on from lj i could be wrong
we all know damn well with flacco still as qb this team would be the most boring average team ever probably sitting at 53 and only because most of our competition this season is mediocre roman needs to go i think most of us can agree
removed
bruh can we not talk about politics in here this is supposed to be our escape from stuff that actually matters
who cares go to rconservative and blow your wad there no one wants to talk politics here
in many ways joe biden represents everything that is wrong with the nfl just as many ways as both represent the worst of the us
keep america great

congratulations on your superbowl bud
imagine how small your dick must be to think posting some incoherent yinzer gibberish on a subreddit is awesome
hahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahhahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhaha

these are well done just one comment though it says 2nd in afc north and 4th in afc

it should be 5th in afc the tits get the 4th seed with the tiebreaker then the ravens win the tiebreaker with the colts so ravens get 5th colts get 6th and browns get 7th

harbs is a little cagey with the media thats whats up
but a rearview mirror wouldve helped his grandfather
hes the same lamar at the end of the day if he has a great next two games is he back and if he has a bad game after that has he regressed again
i think after watching this video harbaugh has officially become an old guy in my eyes lol the way he tells the story by giving the most pointless details about who else was there and who they were related to and getting kinda tripped up with the names along the way
what is the time stamp
they should have followed up with so where are you going
seriously theres so many people who seem to practically creaming themselves over how lamar played saying that theyve never understood why people think hes good his mvp award was wrong and that we should just trade him i dont get all the hate its really disheartening
it happens every time lamar has a bad game
let me know who the fuck said we should trade lamar so i can throw chicken tenders at their stupid ass
two factors

first lamar set the bar real high last year hard to measure up to historic greatness every single game

second there are a lot of fucking hateful idiots out there
he had a bad game with 4 turnovers we still lost by one score and ran it for 300 yards against the best run defense in the league and a teamthat hasntbeen figured out yet by anyone without 4 starters in the second half and still 52 what exactly do we have to complain about
those fans can go kick rocks they would have jumped on the steelers bandwagon if we were still in the boller era with boller throwing to clank hands taylor
im not defending it but the last game lamar played before this one was against the eagles he played some good plays but not great
at this point its whatever to me people can call lamar whatever people called joe shit forever and rightfully so sometimes that i dont care hes my quarterback i am confident in his abilities as a leader and as a player im tired of tryna defend him in whatever thread he will win us a superbowl he fucks up sometimes it was a steelers game multiple turnovers are expected shitty reffing is mandatory this happens almost every time we play them yet this time people are shocked feel like we got a lot of bandwagons
fake fans
like yes he had a bad game against a great defense but we still almost won take away a few penalties and turnovers and it wouldnt of even been close were going to be fine and im looking forward to thanksgiving
see racism in america
you need to look past those who are suddenly hating on lamar and those who are highlight issues with this offence and rightly so those that say lamar isnt our future and hes trash blah blah dont give them the time of day

theres a lot to be optimistic about we show sparks of the team we were last year and the defence is playing really well but you cant ignore we have issues issues that seem to keep haunting us lack of consistency unable to make big plays when its really needed i saw some positive signs this game but we still have these reoccurring issues week after week
fuck rnfl and everybody in it
id still rather have him over like 20 other qbs based off of just skill if you include his personality id rather have no one else
dont go to rnfl or watch any of the sports shows the disrespect is making my blood boil
ive never seen such a polarizing qb in my life bro
as a brady fan i fucking love lamar and i will definitely root for him when all is said and done im annoyed hes underperforming i really want him to succed

as an australian fan i dont really have loyalty to a team im definitely more interested in following players and the ravens have been my afc team of the year
this is just a side effect of getting a super popular player in his prime you get a lot of bad fans


im mostly just ignoring the stupidity of this sub until the fallout of steelers game is over because its just a bunch of nonsense

greg roman should be fired and the offense should be scrapped for a traditional offense

yes because this offense went 142 and led the league in scoring last year
this year it is 52 with one of the leagues toughest early schedules with losses over the defending champions and an undefeated steelers team that came down to a final possession this same game the offense moved the ball and scored a lot and basically lost due to giving away so many points on turnovers

lamar needs to become a traditional passer or we need to consider moving on

yes clearly it would be in this franchises best interest to move on from a reigning mvp who probably had one of the most value added seasons in the history of football because he lost a single elimination playoff series and a home game against the steelers


its not like this franchise didnt just give record deals to a mediocre journeyman qb and held the franchise hostage for close to a half dozen years to never even come close to being a top 5 offense in his entire tenure

bbut that one year he got hot for 4 games in a year the ravens still had one of the leagues best running games and a pretty good veteran defense



yes so it would be a good idea to go back many years of middle of the pack or bottom half offenses to drag out boring defensive minded games its not like the league has evolved and offensive teams are the ones winning super bowls or anything

clearly its just so easy to get number one offenses every year especially with almost entirely inexperienced wide receivers who are completely overmatched
the guy was unanimous mvp he made some people look extremely stupid some people suck you just have to accept it


people overlook it but i think you cant ignore the racial aspect as well lamar is an unapologetically black qb in the us
i imagine tom brady got the same treatment i didnt pay attention because i was too busy hating on him too haha seriously though it comes with the territory of being great lamar knows this and im sure hes itching to get back on the field
obviously people overreact but theres nothing wrong with criticizing poor play from your team being unhappy with the way your teams players played in sunday doesnt make you a fake fan or an idiot it means you have eyes and you know that your team isnt perfect

people love to hate on lamar because hes an unconventional qb but that doesnt mean theres not valid criticism about his game when he plays poorly and he has played poorly this year especially when compared to last theres lots of factors going into it but he doesnt get a total pass he hasnt been very good hes made some horrible decisions and has missed some wide open passes
its going to click for him and ill bet its sooner rather than later but the o line is going to have to find a way to get him more time and we werent doing that even before stanley went down
sadly i think we have become like the one thing we hate the most the one thing we swore we would never be the worst of the worst

patriots fans


view poll
who fills the role it sways my vote
our offense has looked a little off but it is nothing like it was during the dark days of cam camerons decline or marty or marc trestman

nothing like that

im still super surprised any time we have a 3andout it used to be like 25 of our drivers were 3andouts

the team isnt as dominant as last year at least not right now but god damn please stop bitching
i still fucking hate cam cameron
make these post stop

roman didnt lose us the game against pittsburgh that was lamar
and the pass game coordinator too
what if jim harbaugh came to be oc
they just went pretty in depth on ab he can still be suspended again hes still facing charges for court in december if found guilty he makes zero dollars from anyone and hes out of the league pretty satisfied after hearing that about him not making it to baltimore
yeah plus all of those former steelers people on the buccaneers staff now should make for an environment in which if its possible for him to succeed again then itll be there and nowhere else
i feel like we still have a top 3 team in the league i believe we are better than the steelers i believe we can beat the chiefs and the seahawks

our issue isnt match ups our issue is 90 coaching

yesterday we played a hell of a game on both sides of the ball we played ravens football we ran for over 250 yards we should have ran for 300 in my opinion why did we come out of halftime passing even if it were play action i have no idea

now dont get me wrong i think the game yesterday vs the steelers was our most complete game outside of 4 turnovers and 9 penalties for over 100 yards we looked really good we looked like a powerhouse we looked like the team from last season even losing 3 starters

we looked like the better team and had the game handled lamar had some very costly turnovers but i love how we fight til the end snead played very well maybe his second best game as a raven jk and gus are beasts and our defense showed up as usual

honestly i want my team to look how they looked this steelers game every week it lets me know that we are still that dominate force from last year but we have to stop committing so many penalties and we have to run the ball in my opinion we could have broken our rushing record from last year but thats neither here nor there

all in all run the ball move the chains force turnovers win the game thats raven football

thoughts
thoughts i disagree that we are better than the chiefs right now and id point to our recent loss to them as exhibit a and the way things seem to be going any other game against them this year would be arrowhead
yea i agree and penalties killed us even if i do think some of them were super soft regardless the way we should do things is run heavy it clearly works even against a defense like the steelers also adding a good receiver can do wonders i trust mark andrews catching the ball 10 times out of 10 but actual wrs we dont have much and what we do have theyre a dime a dozen in this league younger guys like duvernay porche and hollywood could really thrive with a good veteran wide receiver i know we just signed dez but who knows what hell look like dez 5 years ago give me that all day but now ya never know
the problem is we expected the team to take a major step forward versus last year they are not as good as last year and the identity is still missing on the offensive side of the ball

we fire roman its super bowl guaranteed
you cant be the better team if you lose the game and even if you wanted to argue that point who cares you dont get to the playoffs by being the better team you get there by winning games

in the division round of the 2000 playoffs the titans dominated time of possession and total yards by over 21 yet lost the game by two scores would you consider them the better team that game or even that year

im not saying we cant win the super bowl this year we certainly can but until we win the rematch potentially plural we cant really say were the better team right now

this is the same stuff we were using paul kruger for to stop kaep in the super bowl hit the qb regardless just to let them know youre there
this what teams are going to start doing to us its part of the game unfortunately
i mean hes respecting lamars ability to keep it and take off which he does a lot and it wasnt even a rough grab

but hes a disruptive force
great player but has never lived up to the hype his draft performance made for him
ill say it again if we were going to pay an edge who hasnt had a single 10 sack season we wouldve paid judon
theres a steven ruiz articles saying the reason clowney cant finish sack is that he doesnt have the ability to bend in order to get the sack
reminds me of ziggy last year dude was available until week 4 this season he was so bad
the offseason was brutal cause i kept telling people pressures is a shit stat a pressure can be anything it can be an incompletion it can be a completed pass it can be a pick 6 just a pick or a td a sack is definitive theres no ifs or buts its a loss of yards and a lost down
everyone knows clowney isnt a sack machine go look at his stats
still rather would have had him over judon
thanks captain hindsight who knows what we may have done without you

nothing new but the pass game in general has been a problem

offensive line hasnt and will not be able to adequately pass block especially against quality fronts receivers cant get open consistently and the lack of rubs and motion in the offensive game plan is of prehistoric proportions add all that up to an unwillingness to push the ball down field and all adds to a pass game that didnt need any help to not go backwards with a limited pre season for a qb that needs all the reps he can get

run game is brilliant but the coaching staff refuses to rely on the run game and lamar is clearly not having a very good season as a passer

long story short offense needs to focus on their strengths running the ball and use the passing game as nothing more than a compliment to their strength
every throw on the run tho

theres a thing called consistently mediocre
its the giants they have to give them something
let them sleep all the way to the superbowl
i mean i know they need to glorify things but id rather here the actual truth about players and their ranks and not some bs stat about how they are the first of x y and z with brown hair born on thursday who touched obama left shoe that shit needs to stop

i like dez and its cool and all but that name belongs to brian dawkins in this league
hes a little more humble here so far lol
as a ravens fan weapon x will always be dawkins
dez bryant could have a very large impact on our seasons success
he doesnt move like that anymore lol

i fucking love dez bryant

hollywood wont be happy if dez is called up and soulja x starts catching all his passes p
im really not sure what people are expecting from a guy who hasnt played in three years and is coming off of a blown achilles i just cant see him being that impactful for us
that seems kind of gay

op should see tuckers
i dont know the exact formula but it has something to do with the amount of offseason programs and training camps that player has completed for the ravens
good news good news thats all i wanna hear

who can we trade for
tbh i dont think we should trade for anyone else not sure if this is an allin year anymore gotta keep draft capital
we can trade for nobody as we have no cap room or draft capital
we trade lamar for joe flacco to the jets best plan ever

damn his covid test was before the game
aaron kasinitz and i discuss the ravens performance on defense vs the steelers including

what do the ravens do now about depth in the secondary
how should the ravens address patrick queens coverage weaknesses
will the crowded olb group keep ngakoue focused as a situational pass rusher
low down from aaron on intensive protocol after humphreys positive covid test

i feel like people are just waiting for any excuse to absolutely shit on the guy or hes the greatest to ever do it like why cant we all agree he is a good qb with room to grow and he can make you look stupid if he scrambles
media hung him out to dry before he even got into the league hes black and a qb and he plays for us thats why
i posted something in rnfl about snead accounting for half of lamars yards in that game and someone came along and was like oh lol so like 13 never mind that bad performance aside he threw for more yards than ben

theres being critical and then theres living in a different reality
lamar jackson cant just lose a football game every time its the end of his career because hes been solved or blueprinted i cant think of any other player who gets that treatment
i think a lot of people love him to death

you have to admit he looked like crap in the playoffs looked like crap against the chiefs on monday night and turned the ball over 4 times against the steelers
he has an exciting style but he also makes mistakes theres things for people who love him and people who hate him to use to support their arguments and a lot of people are just so unreasonable about it there are folks that couldnt give lamar credit last year when he was destroying and there are people who want to shift the blame for his terrible performances since january onto everyone else
the comment i saw after last game that seemed to ring true

hes the only qb that has to prove himself in every game
he is a great qb and such an exciting player

he draws a lot of attention because of how exciting he is with that said i really dont think he gets any more criticism than any other qb does

qbs always oscillate between the greatest thing since sliced bread to a pos it comes with the job
last year it was probably the fact that he became mvp as a qb playing an unconventional style that made a lot of media headsfolks look silly this year i think its leftovers from that as well as the fact that the expectations bar is raised for him now coming off the mvp i doubt anyone was really expecting back to back mvps but compared to last year he just looks less confident and is making uncharacteristic mistakes when you reach a certain level of success expectations do go up
several reasons

1 he is black and a lot of racists just cannot handle that nothing he can do about that


2 the media narrative has always been that he is a good athlete who cannot throw while i personally dont believe that is true and he has imo made a lot of good passes in the past he also has had his share of really bad throws


3 he has not looked good in playoff games in past seasons and in games against teams with a good record this season this is a somewhat fair criticism though the titans game was not on him imo


4 until a qb wins it all he will always get unfairly criticized in the media for not being able to win it all remember how payton manning was called a choker cause he could not win a playoff game in his first years in the league remember the constant flacco discussions this will if flacco is any indication never go completely away sadly i mean even among our fanbase there are still those who claim that flacco never was a good qb etc so those will always be there

5 some of our fans got super cocky and brigaded other subs the main nfl subreddit this will always generate hate and lets not act as if we are immune to it ourselves i bet we all hate patriots fans more than we hate bellichick for example
you could right an entire dissertation on it tbh so much goes in it from confirmation bias to racial considerations to the resistance to change its honestly a fascinating topic
hes had the highest highs and the lowest lows of just about any qb in the league hes been unanimous mvp he also had the worst playoff performance you could imagine vs the chargers even this season he dominated the browns then looked horrible in our losses to kc and pittsburgh
he hasnt looked good this season but i dont blame that all on him i think some is the play calling and some is the offensive line but the pit loss was mostly on lamar i agree with others that people are looking for reasons to trash him thats why he has to overperform its not fair but thats the reality he has to win big games
because hes a black quarterback that simple
hes black he talks how white people think black people sound like his name is lamar and not john or kyle
i hate it i really fucking hate it like let him be him which is a good qb
it is because he is black and unapologetically lives his culture he wears chains he hangs out with kodak he is the coolest qb i have ever seen but people dont like it it is so shitty

it obviously was an accident you meat head
were we watching the same game he rolled backwards into stanleys leg how in the world can you call that dirty
watt is dirty af but that was clean he essentially got thrown into stanley
dave from salisbury is that you
wtf happened to this sub lmao
i didnt see anything dirty in this game last year in week 17 was a different story pretty sure there was a hit out on rg3s head
ravens didnt lose to the steelers and the steelers didnt beat the ravens the ravens lost to themselves that game shouldve been our game all we can do is learn from it and drive on to next week
all we can do is learn from it and drive on to next week

yet here you are on tuesday still posting about it

its tuesday man let it go haha in similar words of a coach up north were on to indianapolis
ok but we lost
come off it man
we all know he didnt play his best ball but the more i think about it the more i get excited about one aspect in particular

lamar gets a lot of flak for not showing up in big games tilting easily getting panicky and not being able to overcome a deficit our first pass of the game was a pick 6 we essentially started the game down 7 i think in days past that would have resulted in a quick spiral of 3 and outs until the game was out of hand we have seen it before especially in our losses to the titans and chiefs

instead lamar responded on the very next drive with poise bringing us right back down the field for a score that is a massive step in his mental game yes other mistakes were made like holding onto the ball too long but i feel those were disconnected from the game script and can easily be coached up
what about that td run that was called back he didnt flinch shook it off and called his team back to the huddle i love his competitiveness
the game showed some of our best football this season when we had that period of dominating runs then hit andrews in a nice gain with a play action thats the type of football we need to play but then just like all other weeks we decided nah lets try something else and we saw the same problems crop up again just like previous weeks i genuinely dont know why this is happening but its holding us back and we will pay the price for it down the line
there is nothing wrong with jackson that experience wont cure he is a top level quarterback and he will keep the ravens in the hunt for the next ten years
if we start out with a pick six come back and take the lead and have the game come down to the last few seconds of the 4th quarter against an undefeated team with the top ranked defense in the league

id say thats not the worst day
had our best and worst in a single game lamar is fierce and young im very excited about the future of the team
he came back twice in that game

the td pass to boykin was next level not all qbs can do that

the pass down the middle to duvarney while high was a strong pass to an area of the field he is statistically bad at passing

his option reads were great each time pitching it to dobbins and getting the most out of the yardage

he needed more touch on the screen pass 2nd play of the game and the pass to hollywood in the corner of the endzone not an easy pass

one thing i have noticed is with the presnap movement which the ravens do more than anyone lamar is often worrying that the players are getting to where they need to be and not necessarily takin in the defense for instance motioning them with his hand now i realize that the movement often helps determine zoneman defense but i would like to see lamar truzz his players will get to the right place and take that time to better recognize the defense in front of him

also not every pass has to be a highlight he needs to trust the short pass if you get 4 yards every down you are doing alright
also when his td got called back on a holding and he just waved it off and scored right quick he didnt let that tilt him either
yes other mistakes were made like holding onto the ball too long but i feel those were disconnected from the game script and can easily be coached up

this has been one of the weird things of this year that i dont understand after last years mvp performance everything we did was based off the threat of the run passing lanes opened up because every play could be a run and no one knew who it would come from

our offense this year stepped away from that identity and instead seems to be trying too hard to show that we can pass with the big boys lamar seems to always be looking for the big plays which isnt a bad thing especially after years of check downs but we dominated last year because we held the ball forever and the reality is that our oline our receivers and our scheme just arent good enough to rely on passing

our best drives against the steelers supposed number 1 rush defense were when we ran it down their throats every play force their defense to come up force someone to spy lamar our guys will get open for big plays in due time the added benefit is we keep their o off the field and let our defense rest if were always going for a big pass play we lose that key part of our game

lamar is young and hungry and he has games like this one where he makes some big mistakes but hes also the reason our offense is successful at all and it just seems gro forgets that at times
i think this game showed that we are capable of playing from behind and we wouldve won if it wasnt for key mistakes
this is definitely a good point and shows some progress from bad games weve had in the past

another positive is that the second pick and the fumble were both careless but easily coachable moments i feel theyll stick in lamars head as a reminder and those turnovers dont happen in the future
my guy scored 3 tds in 3 plays on a drive 1 called back for the hold 2 hollywood was in for sure and then came right back to him for a score
i will always upvote some positive vibes in the flock
this game was some of the best football he played all season long but also the worst football he played all season long he made the lost tight window throws hes ever made but at the same time had at least 7 turnover worthy passes
exactly what ive been saying a lot of good things to be excited about
we all know he didnt play his best ball

he played his worst game of his career you cant play any worse than that game that is the compliment and positive note in my opinion valuable tape and lessons learned his poise and response to the deficit etc are what any good quarterback should always do

i am lamar fan and supporter but there isnt really any sugar coating this oneonto the colts in what should be a bounce back game and a real test against a top defense once again should be a good one

we will also get to see our secondary without humphreymakes me happy knowing we have jimmy and peters out there
yup hes still young and needs more experience but imo hes at a good place for the level hes at now
for sure man for me it clearly showed were the best in the division they only won that game because we gave it to them
another thing im seeing that gives me hope is when he gets flushed from the pocket hes not immediately taking off hes looking to throw first now that has led to some terrible looking throws and some bad decisions but he seems to realize that his future lies in being a passfirst qb if he continues to work like this ingame and in the offseason like weve seen i feel good about him leading this team for years to come
lamar cool
except we did almost go 3 and out but the steelers got called for a questionable late hit which let the drive stay alive
its not how you start its how you finish in this case if lamars first three years of his career can start this way im very optimistic about how it will finish after last years mvp campaign there was literally nowhere to go but down in a way its nice to be able to pinpoint areas in need of improvement and we already know he will improve
fire roman hes holding this offense back from evolving it happened in sf it happened in buffalo it must happen again in baltimore

fire roman super bowl guaranteed
this year guys are missing blocks that were made last year as well as dropping passes they caught and so onincluding that throws that were on the money last year but are now a foot or two off the markthe downside to having an almost perfect year is that there is only one way to go he cares and works hard he will work it out just gotta play within himself and not try to win the superbowl on every play
what about the fumble in the red zone and then the disgusting interception to start the second half
i know very little about the game so humor me my impression is that lamar is like a gifted jazzman trying to play along with a classical conductor
removed
im hoping we trade for marvin jones jr
everyones going to say a new wr and an olineman issue is theres nothing good on oline remotely available and we dont need receivers we need greg roman to be able to draw a play thats not a simple post route
i doubt jones gets traded now that golladay has a hip injury and is already out for sundays game
that would be great but it wont happen because everyone in detroit is going to lose their job if they miss the playoffs so they cant gut the team and build for the future
alex mack or kevin zeitler plz

the interior line gives me headaches
a bunch of 5th round picks
evan engram prolly unrealistic
dont make any trades because i have doubts about the ceiling of this team with our injuries and holes

just get better and develop our guys ffs why does nobody on offense seem like theyve gotten better from last year
after saying that if he was building a team hed take burrow over lamar hot take bs i hope his inlaws shun him
oh no he has a differing opinion bring out the pitch forks i like pete he always brings love to the ravens but hes not wrong lamar is a unique talent and needs to be used a certain way most coaches just want a prototype qb and thats okay
i think shannon sharpe hit the nail on the head with lamar hes stressing under the pressure of his own press once he lets go and be himself focus on winning hell be elite
i dont know what kind of team is he building i can imagine a scenario in which a team would benefit more from a player like burrow over a player like lamar i can also imagine the opposite were not going to be able to evaluate these guys for at least another 5 years i personally like lamars style of play but its not for everyone nor every team
its just the normal cycle of lamar he played well people hyped him while his haters waited in the shadows now that hes doing badly theyre all coming out along with the hot take artists to make stupid claims for clicks and views i think we all know burrow isnt better than lamar
i dont agree but its a defensible position to take stop whining like a bunch of protective girlfriends
which nickname sounds stickier big game burrow or big game lamar yeah thats my worry too anyway fuck it go ravens
lamars not a very good passer plain and simple dont hate on facts
year over year we lost our two best offensive lineman for the seasonin yandas case forever and we lost our starting lg to a high ankle injury through 7 games in 2020 we are ranked 23 by football outsiders we were ranked 3 last year our offensive line is the biggest change year over year rank has plummeted even with stanley expect it drop further without him

have you changed your expectations for lamar

what would you help your oline if your greg roman

what are your expectations for the offense

we have 37 million in cap space if you are eric decosta do you make a move

edittodo
we do a terrible job of running screens its almost nonexistent in our play calling watching other teams run rb screens te screens wr bubble screens etc is so frustrating i dont know if its due to lamar or his comfort level you could certainly take a lot of pressure off him by running plays that get the ball out his hands quickly our offense is so bland and predictable
we have 3m in space and apparently that doesnt count the mysterious 4m grievance from earl wherever that is rn in terms of money we have no money we probably already have to restructure just to stay below the cap and i think theyre looking into whos available to determine how much they need to restructure

unless you can get a fantastic deal for an ol youre running objbozemanskurafluker

for the phillips probably goes ir for 3 weeks and you use these weeks to see how good your depth is mehkari is going to get first crack and hes the best option rn it wouldnt surprise me to see him taking phillips job once both are healthy after that id get bredsonpowers some snaps to see what they can do they arent going to get a better opportunity than this

i still think the best option is to find a receiving te in fa so you can dedicate boyle to blocking why would you have the best blocking te in the league running routes let him do his job and give lamar extra time
workaccount1800 is that you greg is that you eric is that you john were watching you

but seriously lol my expectations havent changed for lamar if you can predict what were going to do we can make at least the good teams defense look like they can read us and look like the ed reed when he was on our side

we need creativity there are so many things that other teams do that we dont do

anyways i look forward to see the other comments in here
no moves you have to ride out the injuries and adapt

the run game was still amazing despite being down two starters on the oline whatever happens roman needs to stop giving up on the run 55 ypc average

as for the pass game you need to get the ball out quicker whether that be a quick slant or set up screens we dont need to show the world lamar can pass from the pocket i feel thats been a statement that weve been trying to prove ever since his debut i feel lamar is an amazing qb but im also under the opinion that his regression is due to roman not knowing how to develop the passing game for a mobile qb
second play of the game lamar missed a wr screen to duverney we need to practice that until he can hit that 99100 times

not sure if you guys watched the giants game but in the third jones hit a throw back screen to shepherd i think where jpp made a td saving tackle would love to see that play to hollywood or duverney

we need quick passing to alleviate pressure on the o line run blocking looked fine despite injuries
youre not going to get an impact lineman on the market at this point unless you give up very serious talent i think go with what weve got and build the offense around what they can do run blocking and quick hitting passes get the ball to our speedy guys in space run blocking is easier and more fun fluker in particular is much better at that than pass protection


my cousin is a huge pats fan who has clowned lamar since day one

this was a top 5 cathartic win ever lmao
lol i know this isnt true because media tells me hes not good in big games s
lamar cant win big games
im a dynasty player who owns him curious on actual ravens fans perspective on him does he look decent or like hes progressing at all just not getting opportunity or is he someone who the ravens are probably looking to replace

and what about duvernay is he primed to take over boykins spot is no one looking like a guy worth keeping

thanks
drop him
i think hes just a replacementlevel guy as a pass catcher a wr4 with maybe wr3 upside someday if everything goes right he sees a lot of snaps because he seems to block well downfield in our unique offense but i think hes safe to drop in fantasy my opinion
boykin has issues actually catching the ball

duvernay is going to be a solid wr in about a year or two he shows infinite potential
duvernay has more yards than boykin im pretty sure all purpose and boykin is out snapping him by a lot boykin has issues catching the ball

duvernay is definitely going to become a good wr for us hes already decent just depends on when he gets more snaps and plays more

id drop boykin
this is not a pass friendly offense wouldnt count on either of them
he seems to just have a problem getting open down field plus he greatly lacks chemistry with lamar he needs to use his size better too the hard part about evaluating our wrs is that its difficult to tell if lamar is making them look bad romans pass schemes and playcalling are making them look bad or if theyre just bad its some combo of those 3 but idk what has the biggest impact
no ravens receiver does well
its the offense

even our best wr hollywood brown hasnt had nearly as big of an impact as i expected so far this season as strong and improved as he looked coming off an impressive offseason training regimenti thought hollywood would be a beast but unfortunately he hasnt hit his ceiling yet due to our run heavy system he has infinite potential though he caught 5 passes for 100 yards in the first half alone against the browns week 1 but has been up and down since than and even last week against the tough steelers he managed a td with only 2 total targets and since voiced displeasure for the minimal usage of guys like him and boykin

i like boykin and think he has a lot of potential but you cant learn and improve unless you get the chances to do so and the ravens 1 receiver is mark andrewsboykin is the 4th or 5th option with duvernay making plays and in a run first offense its not a great platform for wrs to flourish

brown and duvernay have more upside fantasy wise
the offense in the air is completely reliant on andrews as a 1st and 2nd read hollywood 3rd and then boykin for the scramble drill crosser

he is a typical outside jump ball wr who is in a offense that doesnt do that at all he will get 30 targets in the year at most drop him only player that is worth getting in the offense fantasy wise is andrews in the air game he will get 100 targets
he is a 3rd round pick in his second year i think people have unrealistic expectations typically it takes 24 years before 3rd round picks really become starters some examples kruger bwill zadarius smith nick boyle kyle juice rick wagner john simon on and on and on most of them didnt have a serious impact until year 3 at the earliest it is part of the draft and player development people always have unrealistic expectations of 35th round picks only 1st rounders really play in their first year any one beyond that is a huge win that isnt even mentioning all the 3rd round picks that amount to nothing about 65 league wide are out of the league after their first contract andrews and obj are the exception not the rule

the much anticipated ravens vs sarah jessica parker week have had this one circled since the schedule came out
we dont recognize the nickname or logo that the indianapolis franchise stole from the city of baltimore as belonging to indianapolis around these parts

its our logo should be a bird versus the word indianapolis in type that is neither blue or white
beautiful
im getting that bird tatted on me
i actually love that idealayout for the bird as a logo
this is the content we need in these trying times
baltimire vs old baltimore

if they had any intention of running 3 te sets this year they wouldve gotten one by now or at least given one of the younger guys from camp at least a few reps in it sadly hope they bring it back next year

in the case that it does happen then to answer your question yes and no yes theyd likely be grabbing a te for use simultaneously with boyle and andrews and not for depth but no the offense doesnt magically look as good as last year not sure which type of question you were asking
hayden hurst was not the cog that made it all work it would appear marshall yanda was
no
i had even realized we havent run the 3te formula
definitely think it helps tbh because then you have to worry about one more person and it opens up everything else
bruh te is the least of our problems we have a top 3 guy in andrews and another top 15 guy in boyle our main focus this off season is beefing up the o line because our o line looks like one of the worst o lines in the league we got lamar running for his life like deshaun watson has been for the past 4 years and we need to find a guy whos going to be a number 1 guy for lamar to go to i love hollywood hes been great for us but dudes to small and cant beat a guy over the top and he avoids contact im not sure if he can be our true number 1 guy te is the least of our problems
no i dont know how you do that with 40 of your offensive line banged up a hall of fame olineman retired and a quarterback who can throw but only sometimes

maybe the ravens should talk yanda into coming back for the last 8 games and playoff run


with the steelers up 2 games on us i highly doubt well catch up to them i dont really care about seeding tho we were 1 last year and look where that took us unless we literally go 88 were probably gonna make the playoffs were clearly the best afc team who currently doesnt lead their division by a mile who knows maybe playing in the wild card and coming in as a disrespected 5th seed nobody expects to do anything will be what we need its much easier to do well when nobody expects anything good from you
i think we could run the table if we run the ball and stop playing like fucking morons maybe drop anothrr 23 games tho if we keep playing like shit
i dont want to look ahead too much ive already changed my expectations to a high wild card so hopefully we get a game against a division winner that we can beat even though we can beat all of them with ease


that rushing defense ranking about to go down
geeez the colts have 11 int
surprised to see their rushing defense so high
i was wondering why our defensive stats look so weird then i realized this only includes ints and not total turnovers we only have 3 int but our turnover rate has to be pretty high with all the fumbles
this is gonna be a rough one no marlon their oline is one of the best in the league and their defense is actually not bad
31st in sack thats the scariest stat here considering we have the most mobile qb in the league probably the main reason our passing game has been off this year now with stanley out im terrified
colts offensive line is the best in football but there weapons are bad outside of there number one receiver this game will boil down to the ravens offense vs there great defense it should be interesting because the colts are a zone heavy team oh also forgot by the colts aya air yards per attempt is abysmally low because of rivers arm so we dont have to really fear the big splash plays that change momentum from there offense on top of this they turn it over a lot because rivers still plays like prime rivers so we should be able to capitalize
not gonna lie this game makes me nervous we are missing some key players and they are solid im hoping we get the ugly philip rivers this week
looking at their passing defense should we be worried

trade what though our 5 draft picks our decreasing depth at most positions
nothing we need to start using the wrs we have we cant trade all our future draft picks and expect to maintain success stop why do we need 50 posts asking about trading for a wr can we get a megathread or something mods
nothing
a receiver wont help us unfortunately we need to look to fa for that
william

lol i was reading the article on ravens website and died laughing just so opposite not sure what i expected but it wasnt william
zadarius smith has a younger brother bob

i would believe the scenarios are the same
julio jones real name is quintorris lopez jones and his brothers name is phillip
my familys also from africa and my name is something that no one would be able to pronounce and my brothers name is thomas sometimes i use his name for ordersetc just to make things go smoother
was really hoping the answer would be mgakoue
hey guys im yannick ngakue this is my brother bill
once worked for a couple of brothers named leonidas and dean
whats so special about yannick pretty common name where im from as common as william
removed

no way we play on sunday
this season got depressing fast
wouldnt be shocked if there are several more positive tests in the next few days and our game gets pushed to monday or tuesday as a result
the colts play tnf next week i dont think theyll postpone our game
fuck sakes saw this coming after quite a few weeks of marlon at dinner parties and out to dinner on social media we need people to take this shit seriously it could cost us the season cases are spiking this isnt the time for going out or get togethers sacrifice is necessary
we all saw this coming really
when it rains it fuckin pours
he had been sick since wed but tested negative until sunday its a really bad situation to have because imagine how many players and staff he came into contact with between those time periods
news keeps getting better
i just dont understand how this happened how nfl players couldnt quarantine for the season

from nfl now on nflnetwork expect multiple ravens players to land on the reservecovid19 list today after it was determined they were highrisk close contacts to cb marlon humphrey sources tell me and tompelissero

if it comes to this moving ravenscolts back a day or two isnt really an option because colts play the thursday game the following week so if they move ravenscolts back theyd have to move the colts tnf game back too


i know he hangs out with judon a lot so im sure hell be in that group i wonder who else
we have zero positive tests today aside from marlon and hes quarantined home
removed
oh hey look its genericracistguy reposting his same take from yesterday
damn this sub turned to strait cancer fast why does any positivity offend so many of you lol i get it is a tough time but everyone needs to calm down and get over the steelers loss we swept them last year and they didnt sit in their sub crying about it
imagine stalking a grown mans social media to scold him
this is fucking dumb social media is for friends his friends arent gonna tell him hes trash lamar literally said in a press conference we lost cuz of his bad play i really dont get the argument here lamar is known for being a hard worker and super humble and taking criticism well
cannot wait for this post to be 
what the fuck is even this
how do you own a reddit account and for 2 months not have a single comment without negative upvotes lol
please and i do not mean this kindly take your poorly formed opinion write it down in a piece of paper and stick it so far up your ass the paper becomes a lump of coal from the built up pressure youve developed these past 2 days trying to spout your shit in this sub

fuck off
can we not do this
this harbs needs to tell these guys that they havent done anything and that they need to earn what they want biggest example is harbs sitting lamar out that last game of the season for a raw qb like lamar he needs all of the reps he can get and again he hadnt done anything at that point what was earned was a first round bye hes not a polished vet with a laundry list of credentials lamar himself said that they overlooked the titans which means that he and others on the team think they are better than they were and then they got buzzsawed

marlo wont play harbaugh said yesterday during the presser
marlon has to self isolate for at least 10 days he isnt playing sunday
you are definitely a glass half full person and that is commendable but that aint happening if he really has the virus
as long as the rest dont test positive they should be fine if ive done my research correct marlon is 100 not playing this week


also the number is up to 7 now
unfortunately positive means isolation for 10 days hump and whoever else is positive cant play sunday cuz thats not 10
my biggest question is who are the other players
i dont think humphrey will be cleared but the rest have a chance
i dont see how we play sunday or at the very least they play sunday

ravens players go to the jets not the other way around
he had a damn good rookie year but hasnt done anything since because theyve made him block 90 percent of the time
so why dont the ravens go back to 3 tes that worked so well last year theyve said they wont but why
we dont have money
we wont be getting a te this will not help us

first lets see if theres a game
whos our starting secondary lineup were gonna get toasted
eh just run 60 times and hold the ball for 45 minutes

a bit of an exaggeration but thats how to defend good passing attacks when youre light at db
i just really wish we had our full lineup resllyyyy would have loved watching the guys tee off on old man rivers as he tries his lame ass trash talk lying on his back then again they dont really have any competent receivers so maybe theres still a chance of this

real prediction lots of running against 2 strong run defenses probably not the most exciting game but im not too concerned

wishful thinking tucker and blank have the ultimate kicker showdown with 10 50yarders scored with only one miss to lose the game goggles shatter tucker laughs we win not like there was any doubt
the colts are not a good team stop this negative nancy shit the fucking browns blew them out
id be shocked with a win after last weeks brutal loss
hey flock being a fan from australia means early monday wake ups and a zombie workday i work in a trade and my hours 7330 prevent me from watching the games live
my system this season has been to delete instagram facebook and messenger during the day not go on reddit and dont check any fantasyscores then after work go home and watch the full game replay on my nfl game pass and its like watching the game live really gives me the feeling of watching the game as its happening get to have a brewski eat dinner and enjoy

hope you guys in nonusa timezones give this method a shot and let me know how you like it
i thought that your hack was going to be tying your antenna to a koala and letting it climb the tallest eucalypt in the territory
im in italy luckily almost all of our games are in the early time slot so they start at 7pm for me which is perfect
ive been waking up at 3 am these past few weeks to catch the games luckily with daylight savings it shifted to 4 am lol its tough but i make it work im at guam btw

hell yeah congrats i also just became a citizen in time to register and vote

damn thats almost our entire defense and judon
quick someone call suggs and weddle
so our entire lb corps cool
if terrell bonds cant play we got no shot in hell at winning
so what triggers cancelling a game who determines that or is it completely arbitrary and random
well uh this is certainly not ideal
here are ravens 7 close contacts identified after marlon humphrey tested positive

lb matthew judon
lb patrick queen
s deshon elliott
lb lj fort
lb malik harrison
cb terrell bonds
lb tyus bowser

they cant practice this week but can play sunday if they pass 5 days of testing

tyre and stanley on ir

well i guess now were forced to see what our other guards are made of
pain
im guessing holden comes up from psquad to be our swing tackle and we start activating bredson or tcc for depth

not sure if theres any street ots we could bring in for low end depth but might make sense

this is nice its sort of like tagging your top7 in myspace i wonder if any raven is out there thinking damn i thought we were closer
looks like were going to be short at lb hope the practice squad has some dudes stashed away
so basically our entire linebacker corps and secondary other than chuck and peters

tuesday night football pls

edit chuck peters and yannick forgot he was an olb instead of a de lol
can dez play linebacker
who is terrell bonds
anthony levine time lol
damn
well shoot
oh bye defense
some will likely pass but some certainly wont
looks like dez can get a start on d for next weeks game
this is really unfortunate as an indy transplant living in baltimore i really enjoy any time we get to play i know this is somehow the titans fault
terrible and good terrible our starting lb corps would be done good our good cbs and defensive captain are fine also who would even be our lb corps if our base starters are done
i feel like this would be a net positive if it means bonds isnt on the field
jesus christ thats pretty much the whole defense not to be all doom and gloom but 62 looks a hell of a lot better than 53 thats why you cant turn the ball over four fucking times lamar

this and the tweet itself are both pretty funny to me
full episode might be their best one of the season so far
these guys are so creative
man he really wants to send troops somewhere to start a war smh s
rbleacherreportshows
his tweet was very ablike pretty worrying if you ask me

so we we lose critical parts of the ol and dbs but didnt make a move at the deadline hmmm yikes buckle up flock wishing we had a xfl minor league team to bring up dudes right about now similar to baseball lol
this is such a childish post you cant reach and pay more for players if the money isnt there or you dont believe they are worth what they are asking thats how you fuck yourself over down the road

dude got us yannick

clearly they are happy with what we have and thats our best option at this point

its clear the o line needs help but if a trade isnt there it isnt there the team is still good very good it just needs to click and get a hold of things with stanley and phillips down we still saw our run game kill the number 1 defence we have a lot of work to do doesnt mean it cant be done its not ideal but thats football
asking prices were way too high
didnt he say he wasnt done building this team it appears we have been bamboozled

what kind of quarterback does shannon think trent dilfer was when they won the superbowl
thats why we brought in dez hope hes still able to win 1v1
took me a while to sit down and listen to this but really glad i did man a loss like that or any is really a trash way to start a week but this made me feel much more optimistic

you dont win mvp thru luck the talk about gros scheme it all added up for me

idk if anyone feels the same
vick for oc
michael vick has probably the best perspective on this it jives with what i see as a casual fan too
i could only sit through 3 minutes before shannon started screaming

also billy cundiff shit still hurts
a lot of pain we have gone through the boller years
houshmandzadeh wide open dropped 4th down pass lee evans game winning drop cundiff game tying shank

dark times they were
what ever happened to kb anyway is he working the holiday shift at a wawa in hunt valley now
kyle boller may arguably be in our top 5 qbs of all time lol
but kyle boller could throw a pigskin a quarter mile from his knees
ahh yes the source of my username
bollers best season with the ravens

55 completion percentage

2559 yards next best season was 1000 less than that

13tds

11 ints


he started all 16 games that season


thats why i wont hate flacco i refuse to he brought in mediocrity and an above average offense kyle boller ruined the best defenses the league has ever seen
former psl owner here and having to pay for all those preseason games during the boller era stung
i remember starting to watch the ravens when cundiff has that kick watching this team is so much more fun than it was then lol
i will never forget when he was trying to tuck the ball to run and fumbled by himself in the open field


kyle boller had a rocket for an arm but acted as i feel we all would being an nfl qb terrified lol
joe was rough a few years before the superbowl as well absolutely gift wrapped pittsburgh 2 superbowl appearances
this pain is nothing still a lot of hope from the og camp
or worse the years before that with a new this ones gonna be the guy i can feel it at qb every year only worked with air mcnair
kyle boller shaved at least five years off todd heaps career heap was constantly getting lit up because boller was leading him directly into defenders
its so easy to forget how spoiled we are lol im having a meltdown 52 we endured some pretty god awful years in our days
i wish i had more upvotes
my first year as a football fan was flaccos and harbaughs rookie seasons ive been spoiled from the beginning
jamal lewis and the defense helped me cope with the boller days
gotta say with a reputation as a offensive mastermind billicks quarterback choices were pretty meh
lemme tell you tho even thought kyle boller made me want to pull my teeth out our defense was so stacked i still loved watching the ravens play even when we would win 63 or some low scoring game
im still very salty he wasted arguably our best defense of all time
its more that theres an expectancy for us to play well atm tho itd feel alot better to lose these games if i felt we were a massive underdog
but yeah people who abandon teams through rough periods can gtfo
i remember as a kid having an elvis gerbac jersey that was pain
if only we wouldve pulled a josh rosen while we were drafting with aaron rogers on the boardfucking mark clayton
ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh the truth in this post
facts
love it
ill never forget mnf in 05 against the broncos in mile high boller threw a horrendous int to champ bailey on a fade to randy hymes i think it was going into halftime and you could just see the look of disgust on billicks face i think he was done with kyle at that point
does anybody remember the famous video of kyle boller throwing like 60 yards on one knee
they should have never started him over chris redman smh
i remember watching the ravens play the steelers in the playoffs i believe with flacco and willis mcgahee getting freaking destroyed on our last drive to try to come back and win the game i remember feeling as if i got destroyed other than the lee evans drop and condiff miss probably the worst ive felt after a loss

by the way did that gronk catch count as a td i didnt check but reminded me of lee evans which was called a drop probably completely diff as i refuse to relive that play lol
kyle boller is the only quarterback ive seen consistently trip over his own feet anybody else remember that every second or third game he would have a game where they would snap the ball he would try to step backwards and just trip over his own feet he did have those two games against the vikings and the green bay packers back to back during the holiday season though
preach
i felt this post too much
truth
this is absolutely facts
dont forget elvis grbac and the shadow of randall cunningham in 2001 followed by the chris redman and jeff blake show in 2002
or the redmond phase or the heart break of steve mcnair not returning and then getting killed that summer by his mistress
those were the first games i remember
yup
madden kyle boller was a nightmare hed out run vick and out throw farve
i made kyle boller 99 in madden during that era
im a younger ravens fan being a huge eddie george fan i followed the titans for abit when air mcnair and a few other titansmason rolle went to the ravens i followed them been a fan ever since love our team and the fans as a canadian its on my bucket list to attend a home game and cheer on our boys rip 9
i was his neighbor when i was a kid i got his autographed rookie card and gave it to a friend after they shipped him to the raiders
we dont speak of those times the things i would have done to help us get anyone else
touche
k boller shouldve faced criminal premeditated murder charges the way he use get the wrs and tes killed
dont forget the short anthony wright stint
i started watching the nfl the year he left
sitting in that stadium for years watching him and just drinking heavily because the shit on the field was horrible
or the elvis grbac era error
why do we call them the joe years joe wasnt the problem with the team ozzie was as great as ozzie was his last years were truly bad backloaded contracts for players who never lived up to the contract bad free agent pick ups like maclin bad offensive drafting
so to air mcnair for being our first real offensive spark at qb this was the first time in our history where scoring on the first drive was a possibility
this is so dumb seen this all day kyle boller is the reason i can be so critical of the qb position now
defending lamar jackson is so much easier than defending joe flacco ever was
we had a dope defense that could win games because the rules didnt favor offense so heavily though

we had pass rush an elite mlb and secondary this post is bullshit
i was wasting my time as a philly fan back then in retrospect though it pissed me off at the time mcnabbs unceremonious firing was the best thing that could have happened to this football fanwas able to follow harbs to baltimore

man i hate when one of my favorite players says something dumb and indefensible
hump needs to just stop man
i love you humphrey but jeff is part of the flock you need to treat him with respect
whether you think the virus is overhyped or not just wear a mask and be smart when youre going out to respect the people that are fearful or are high risk im an overweight person and i absolutely hate wearing a mask but i do it because i want to stay safe and respect other people
did he delete his tweets i cant find their exchange
twitter is hard to link to marlons reply
what did he say
if jeff is implying that they were careless when they werent then im fully on board with hump here

staying that our guys werent wearing masks then they should have been is a very bad look and shouldnt be tolerated if false
not jeff man

reminder that since the trade deadline is over people have to clear waivers now

i think if our entire starting defense cant dress we wont play if they clear everyone but marlo we go and make a game of it as long as we run like we did against pitt i think we win
the fuck wrong with his face
we have a shot as long as its only marlon on the covid list but goddamn our offense needs to show up and beat the colts properly
lamar is the x factor for the rest of the year
this is not a the teams great everythings fine go ravens post just to get out in front of those people

but

ive seen a lot of comments about how the team looks different from and worse than last year which yes but i think people dont quite realize how historically good the 2019 ravens were and how rare it is to win 14 games

in tom bradys 18 years as the patriots starting qb they won 14 or more games four times which is a little over once every five years for the greatest dynasty in nfl history

peyton manning started for 16 full seasons and won 14 games twice which is once every eight years for unquestionably a top 5 qb of all time

winning games in the nfl is incredibly difficult and the league is designed for teams to cycle through periods of being on top

are there problems with the team yes absolutely but if were comparing this season to a historic 2019 where everything went right then were going to be disappointed every time
at this point im just gonna put my head down until the playoffs let be people doubt us and write us off i hate the hype anyway were pretty much guaranteed a spot in the playoffs so i say just wait until then and hopefully handle business
i think the majority of the fans understand that last years was historical from a winning standpoint and perspective what the fans were complaining was more about the team abandoning the run you read lots of yeah we won but something doesnt feels right for me fuck the steelers but this loss felt better than kcs for example imo the ravens recovered their identity and it felt good even tho we lost
lamar is in a position where every game he has to prove hes the best in the league because weve lost 2 playoff games when it counts on top of a historic mvp season

we have the opportunity to perform better entering the playoffs as an underdog like we have plenty of times in the past upsetting teams especially with the whole media finding a way to criticise everything we do

as a fan we just have to hope the team does some damage in the playoffs i dont care if we cant win it all thats just the way it is but i hope we can knock out shittsburg

were not the cleveland browns we have a good front office so will remain at least interesting to watch as a fan for the near future

reminder that the steelers literally cheered for the browns in 2018

lower your expectations stay humble and fuck the steelers and browns
our team is always at its best when we go through adversity last year the 142 gave us no adversity and we hardly played from behind which screwed us in the playoffs against tn
also our prior super bowl teams were not the best regular season teams either
i think its better to be a lowkeyunderdog team theres much less pressure on lamar and i think he will perform better without people on his tail all the time unlike mahomes and wilson lamar seems like he cant deal with all the attention on him which is fine i think getting criticized too much discourages lamar a bit and if the media can just forget about him he will play much better
this isnt about reason its purely about emotion in the grand sense this is one of the best teams in the league but emotionally its night and day we got used to feeling like we had the best team in the league anything that didnt fit the narrative could be written off as a fluke or coincidence

this year there is no denying we are just a good team personally its been hard to go back to being happy with a good chance to win when i good used to good chance of 30 point win its human nature

my expectation is that the invested long term fan will recalibrate back to football reality and be happy with what we have the bandwagon or shallow fan will continue to be upset

we are clashing amongst ourselves because one side is arguing facts and one side is arguing feelings we are talking past each other even if the ravens win every game left it wont feel the same as last year and once people realize that we can get back to a relatively healthy normal
the team can improve by the playoffs hopefully they will without stanley im not sure were contenders anymore theres a certain level of greatness to be a champion and im not sure we have that right now
i agree and get how last year was incredible what i really want from this year is a game where they lay the hammer down and really destroy a team like they did multiple times last year patriots rams texans if they can do it just once i will be satisfied in knowing they have the potential to do it in the playoffs until then i am just worried
the frustration comes from the fact that they seem to be playing at a similar level to last year except without the consistency and by losing to themselves with penalties poor pay choices ect
we had our 2 losses by week 4 last year so technically we are off to an identical start fans this year are expecting perfection and its kinda annoying both losses weve had were close games to good teams so much complaining about the play calling but i think it has been pretty good

it is still possible to end with the same record if lamar gets hot he is pretty unstoppable
this years team is still a 124 maybe even a 133 team which both records are still ridiculously respectable i agree w what youre saying though
lamar jackson and the ravens were setting franchise and nfl records left and right last season lamar won the mvp unanimously the only time in history this has happened

i knew people would knee jerk with stupid takes because realistically there was no way this team could repeat those feats back to back

people love to point to mahomes as a example yet this sub cant even support lamar a full season mahomes wasnt even in the mvp chat for most of last season but to see this sub you would like lamar is a bust and needs to walk along with roman
last season was a special season that we squandered to be completely frank similar to 2006 when we went 133

youre right that we cant expect to have the repeat of such a season but that makes it even more irrelevant to the current teams problems
also to be fair our two losses are literally the top two powerranked teams in the entire nfl right now

yeah we want to beat them but the steelers game was 100 winnable with just a little cleaner ball security

kc was a rough game but i dont believe that were unable to beat them on the right day

and yet the video in the tweet doesnt show either of them
nice
reed was one of the most fun players to watch i miss seeing that guy on the field
8 years how time flies wow
nice
im going to play action everyone at the dinner table tonight with do you guys know what happened 8 years ago today in history everyone is too wrapped up in the election right now to get this one theyre totally going to bite on the political timing
theres no td pass or int in that highlight video lol
i think its going to be a close game theyre a solid team with a good defensive and offensive line

i hope lamar balls out finally and hits some deep shots and that jk continues his emergence on our offense

scared about starting a backup filled defense if things go bad on the tests but no way to change that now
if we play like the team we were built to be and we saw flashes of that against the steelers i think we will be okay

need to keep an eye on that covid list

regarding colts offence lockdown ty hilton and pressure rivers he is so up and down much like his tenure at the chargers i think we can take care of business here
im more worried about our covid list impacting that game than the colts themselves that defense is good dont get me wrong and phillip rivers is heating up but look at their schedule

i know everyone said this leading up to pittsburgh but indy really has only beaten one solid team in the bears which was a defensive slugfest ending 1911 their other wins are against awful teams id consider them pretenders but considering the state of our roster im not the most optimistic
well ill tell you this ty hilton wont do shit

sincerely a fantasy owner who started him way too long into the season
if all those covid players are out not good
if we can bottle their running game we will win
if we get the majority of our guys back i feel very confident indiana has a solid defense felipe always can play good football but we just stomped rolled steelers defense take lamars 2 int and we talking about a rout

baltimore ravens vs harlem globetrotters
calais will dunk on them so hard
1st half basketball 2nd half football who says no
they have more right to use that name than the one the nfl recognizes
id understand if they mispelled indianapolis or even colts

but they literally just put a whole different team from a different sport how can you mess up that badly
not liking our chances in the redzone they pretty much will win all jumpballs with the height advantage we have the speed advantage though so get the screens jet sweeps go routes and good returns
i predict a lot of blocked pats
ha reminds me of the opening of baseketball football vs baseball
blertimore footberds vs urdiana percers
can oladipo play db or receiver
pacers gonn get worked
good ol 11 on 5 game sport
well if all those players still test positive come sunday this will be a much fairer matchup
somebody pass hollywood the damn ball 1 shot last game
bruh real talk

myles turner is a bad man so is victor oladipo we gotta reach out to these guys and get them to play for the ravens
this is a little bit for fun but my coworker and i made a bet due to a disagreement where he thinks james robinson is a better running back than jk dobbins ability wise not statistics and then he doubled down by betting me 20 that there will not be one stat that dobbins has better than robinson after the colts game and after the jags houston game whose the better rb what stat will dobbins beat him at
jk has a much higher yards per carry 67 ypc vs 45 ypc so that is a pretty telling stat
yards after first contact dobbins has dominated in all season and thats a stat that heavily favors backup rbs or the less popular rb in a rbbc due to their more rest later in games so thats much in dobbins favor and against robinsons
dobbins has looked great in the touches hes gotten but i dont think weve seen enough of dobbins to say anything definitively

i also love robinson he has looked great in the trashbag that is the jags offense
yardsattempt is the easy one jk is 67 ya vs robinsons 45 ya
that doesnt make any sense if he claims its based on ability but then bases the bet on stats robinson gets way more opportunity which leads to better counting stats
you may have been scammed my friend indys defense is significantly better than the texans and also robinson gets pretty much every carry on that team odds are better player or not robinson ends the game with better stats this week

no one in particular it is a generic statement that means they will always be monitoring players who become available or guys to bring in for depth if injuries happen it never meant we were going to trade for someone with cap we dont have
probably meant the stanley signing in all possibility that was a pretty huge deal
wasnt it announced he tried to trade for zach ertz and adam thielen
no he was talking about dez at the time he made that statement the dez deal wasnt finalized

solid guy real team leader he is on the wrong side of 30 but he still has some gas in the tank surprised it took him this long to get any looks really hope he has a place in baltimore
anything helps if this week keeps going the way it has
hes older but a slot cb would be nice kinda surprised he hasnt been signed already
can he play this week

im also really hoping he can be better than bonds or gilchrist
speaking of older cbs can we bring back carr
this is how you know its bad
tramon was so great he even played well during his 2nd stint in gb too
arent all the covid close contacts lb not cb

thats awesome my favorite player is humphrey and to watch him give up fruit punch in order to get verified made me sad is this a custom jersey if so where from i might need to do this as wella possible early christmas gift for myself
psh what sucks about it this thing is sweet
better be careful


dont let jeff zrebiec see you wearing that
i love this cool jersey

ravens ol scoring and notes vs steelers including

browns play at lt and flukers at rt after stanleys injury
bozemans busy day as a puller
who last ran all over the steelers
rg woes and what the ravens may do in the absence of phillips
i hope we address c and rg next year i think our center got bullied last year in the playoffs and that showed up again vs the steelers and the scoring notes very happy and fortunate to see brown and fluker stepped in and performed well
what happened to that guy i remember a nagging injury but not much about his play

also is there a reason he likes porn videos on twitter occasionally im not huge on twitter but i follow many ravens and no one else appearss to do this
the porn thing happened to a friend of mine he liked it and tagged his gf in the comments i think he was stoned and meant to send it to her dm we roasted him for weeks after
maybe the dude just likes his porn dont know why he wouldnt use an alt for that but like okay
never developed much as a player seemed like a steal at the time but never lived up to expectations
went to green bay and then released i think
he sucked
he was a onetrick pony and that doesnt really cut it in the nfl

this content is very refreshing from the takes ive seen since that game
ray should be an nfl commentator
i felt exactly the same way about the qb draw before it happened lamar has time to grow but we need our play caller to be smart for him whoever is calling the plays it is way to easy to read our offense right now
they need to give this man a touchscreen
greg roman gotta go
just got a new iphone any links to cool live or just overall cool iphone wallpapers no clue what the limits are in terms of video or whatever thanks in advance

edit and as always fuck the steelers
i try to post the social media wallpaper wednesdays here when the show up
the ravens twitter account has wallpaper wednesday just google it

ray needs to come be a coach for the ravens
phil simms desperately wanted ray to toss him the ball
hey fellow euroravens i know there is the europe nfl shop but i was wondering whether any of you guys know of any alternatives that also sell ravens merch
the us store wont ship to europe i dont mind shipping one to you if you want something official
i know there is an nfl uk store they will tell you if they ship throughout europe or not

football is a team sport no one player wins or loses a game yes a kicker may hit a game winning fg but the offense or defense got him to that point conversely a team may lose the game due to a turnover which could be a result of qb play o line or receivers generally it a combination of all three this isnt fantasy football


the ravens will be hosting veteran s antoine bethea for a tryout



posted by fieldyates

github whatsnew
had a bunch of tackles last year
from pff

solid veteran secondary mercenary for hire antoine bethea has reached the rolling shortstop stage of his career since he left the colts he has had stops in san francisco arizona and new york with the giants and in each location has had at least a solid year to begin before things started to decline the giants didnt let him get to year two to see that downturn in fortunes but bethea has shown he can at the very least still be a solid starting presence his first year with every team in his nfl career has seen him earn an overall pff grade of at least 694 and in three of the four stops that grade was north of 84 hes worth a shortterm gamble for a team that has a problem spot at safety but dont expect it to be a longterm fix

steelers win a regular season game after two years not even making the playoffs and declare themselves kings of the north
i love the comments praising the steelers defense yet the game came down to the very last play despite all these shenanigans they got the win but im not sure id be bragging like they already won the super bowl
how has this post been up for 4 hours
this was pretty funny i cant lie only reason i can laugh is because i have faith in the fact he will turn it around
ouchie
lol fuck
hilarious
baltimore colts revenge game time

how to paralyze a dude in one easy step
goddamn why havent i seen this before
hey guys secondary ravens fan here and avid degenerate gambler i thought the line was already too good to be true at 3 but its now moved to a pickem for the same odds btw colts and ravens so what gives i know humphreys is out but that was known days ago curious if theres anything else going on or should i bet the farm here like i want to
judon came back but as it sits today still no patrick queen deshon elliot tyus bowser malik harrison and lj fort soooo
why does everyone insist on calling him humphreys its just one humphrey
we could be missing a ton of our defense not sure when they are off the exposure list
the colts have some absurd win record going into this game against baltimore all time at home that people made a big deal about and we still dont know who is actually going to play this weekend yet
we lost 2 of our starting o linemen which were already having trouble so that is going to hurt our ground game the indy defense is no slouch so we likely are going to struggle to put up points like we have been

then we have the majority of the defensive backfield out with covid protocol so that is going to again limit how much preparation they can do for scheming purposes my take is that if we win it is going to be on the backs of our stars skill levels and not anything planned
i wouldnt be shocked if we lost unfortunately
pickem sounds about right to me colts are a great team and match up well thats not even taking into consideration all the lbs have been sitting all week and might get only one practice in
half our defense might not play so i think the colts have a good chance to win
we drop this game and our next 2 of the 3 after this this season isnt looking good

i just cant wait until sunday cause i need something to watch this week has taken forever im ready for something enjoyable on tv
my expectations around him were low but the way the organization is talking about him im more excited to see him on the field than i should be


watching the video reminds me how not perfect the 2012 ravens were 2020 team looks a lot better still
now i know what im doing for the next 45 mins thanks
pretty much as stated if i am listening correctly it appears he says that outdoor entertainment venues can have a capacity of 25 which would be more than the current 10 i do know that governor hogan has set it at 10 so i assume state would come before local but wondering if i am misinterpreting

and yes i understand the covid implications but i will wear my damn mask if i were able to go
i dont see them letting more people in with cases surging back up again the last few weeks regardless just my opinion
baltimore is an independent city like one of three in america it can likely just set its only capacity
i dont think theres gonna be a change the 25 is reverting back to stage 1 if im not mistaken so i dont think wed see an increase to game capacity
the announcement is them increasing restrictions correct

id highly doubt theyd bring in more fans after further limiting the amount of outdoor capacity

legendary pic

that turf looks really painful though
if i remember correctly that game manning took a knee inside the 5 when he could have broke unitas passing record against baltimore classy
is jeff saturday a goat center he might be
facts the brady over manning nonsense that has become a given is so frustrating if you were actually around to watch the two
my dad said one of his favorite signs hes seen from a game was from a balind match it said 1918
i agree but whos the 4th guy behind jeff saturday
will you respect this house
i am glad we finally beat peyton
man this was such a good era
as much as i enjoy the era were embarking on i doubt ill ever enjoy watching a ravens team as much as the one with batman and robin at the helm on d
i still till this day play madden like im peyton manning everyone is getting a brand new route

all jokes a side he was probably the first qb that i really admired other than vick
theres 4 jeff saturday was a goat center
yes three goats in this pic and then theres reed lewis and manning
what a picture

we rarely beat peyton but i did like how ed reed routinely picked him off lol

edit also 4 goats jeff saturday the center for the colts and one of the greatest such player in nfl history is also here
very true
im a tennessee grad so peyton will always be one of my favorites hell im wearing his jersey right now what a great picture thanks for sharing
ill never forget this game manning audibling at the line and lewis doing the same for the defense epic match
some legendary games
you forgot john cena
how bout those khakis tho
i see two
upvoting steelers fans posts posting pictures of manning this sub is getting so soft
wheres brady

to my knowledge hollywood was brought in for questioning already and his statement was given so i dont think he has any issues tied into this or the league or legal would have sat him out already
this isnt particularly new news
this cant end well
fuck ab i hope he self destructs again and tanks tb12s last good year doesnt deserve another shot hopefully marquise isnt complicit but i dont think hes in danger of a suspension or anything here called as a witness is very different than accused of anything
hopefully the browns dont roll like the thomas brothers
this tweet is not a coherent sentence

is this saying the woman filed to delay the trial and she requested hollywood to be deposed
before i read that last line i was shooketh
ummmmmm what
oh no
hmm this will be interesting

a lot of niners fans blamed him at least partially for coaching kaepernicks instinct and playmaking ability out
this is greg roman he gets stuck in his ways and doesnt adjust and gets fired see sf buffalo etc
if u replace these 49ers players with the ravens players its basically identical to all the struggles the ravens o has had we all know what happened to kaep im a little scared for lamar if greg roman doesnt adjust we cant improve
this is why i thought we had to win the sb last season this happens to every greg roman offense and harbaugh has a bad track record of getting rid of coaches when its obvious its not working i know everyone will say we were 142 last season and lamar won mvp but we cannot afford to be wrong about roman while lamar is still in his rookie contract we have such a small window to win until we have to pay lamar
and honestly with edc at the helm i thought it was real
if it was real it would have been a 5th rounder

im glad but im gonna miss my fruit punch
blessed be thy covid activations
no lj fort though due to injury
no humphrey but im very happy it looks like everyone else will be playing
big props to the organization for putting in place and following measures that prevented one infection from spreading to the rest of the team
should note that lj fort is out with a finger injury little bit weaker in the middle but not gutted when everyone was on this list
can you imagine starting a game with only chris board at lb
thank god theres a lot of important snaps on that list still miss marlon but nothing can be done there
thank god fuck
defense is back on the menu
uhh so no judon he was on the covid list as well at the beginning of the week right
absolutely bummed marlo wont be out there but beyond relieved queen will be playing
big purple wave incoming

how about marlon and judon

reminds more of seth roberts dude had the tiniest body compared to his helmet

he looks like he likes white girls more better
noooo my beautiful boy no
looks legit to me
bruh have you seen judon in game
mans looks like he ate too much taco bell lmao
fucking boyle tho
this makes me very uncomfortable he looks like a gorilla and i feel somewhat offended but i know they didnt do on purpose

but wtf
noooo why orlando

id throw hands lol
i would straight up murder my mom i mean shes a terrible person to begin with but still

feel free to check my post history to get an idea of what its about just good fun for both fanbases and nothing serious for those interested here is a link to the thread
give the name and history back
that banter thread turned toxic real fast turns out indy fans cant cut it
joe flacco is still the best person named joe to ever graduate from the university of delaware
back to back presidents believe joe flacco is elite checkmate
also lest we forget fuck the steelers
even better than joe mama
wait obama thought flacco was elite
obama says flacco elite
really why bring this bullshit in here its game day muthafucks

x200b

big fucking truzz
oh just cry into your bud light redneck
i think youre forgetting about another joe

jets win incoming trevor lawrence rejoices
flacco playing the pats on primetime gg
i do love flacco and i really hope he somehow gets 2 more wins before he retires


joe flacco needs 108 passing yards to move past joe montana for 20th on the nfls alltime passing yardage list
dez upgraded other players activated joe starting on mnf and terps routing penn state

its been a solid day
elite
theyre fucked
joe the patriot slayer flacco
removed
quality shit post
honestly i dont know how the titans steelers and browns are still allowed to play football breaking protocols in a pandemic asses putting the whole sport at risk

i like hollywoods hoodies almost as much as lamars
what a nice teammate
this shows the support each other i think the team is still vibing together that just havent clicked on the field
i love the support but i cant get behind purple tye dye with camo pants lol his wife must not have been home when he left lol
get open
he is one beautiful human
removed
for him to be activated after a week and a half either hes looking great in practice or coaches are feeling desperate cautiously optimistic its the former
throw up the xs bitches
lets fucking gooooo

cant wait to see him play again


lamar jackson 500 3535 42 tds 0 int 0 fumble

ghost of johnny ufinishing out the game 200 yards 2020 10 tds
oh this def shivers me timbers

just imagine if it turns out dez is the guy that still has it after everyones been begging for ab lol

imo dez at worst is gonna be able to fill the mike evans role for us basically an outside te in the rz
today keeps getting better and better
everyone get in here its happening
that a boy dez lets get it
how do you all think this affects browns targets for this week
holy shit if he even catches one pass ill nut
time to deztroy
damn that was fast
lets gooooo

oh god oh man oh god oh man
x gonna give it to ya
lets fucking go
oh my body is ready

so is it utterly stupid to start dez tomorrow im already not doing well in my league so ill try anything
hope the dez tape doesnt leak
lets gooooo
sounds like moore is being put back on ir and duvernay is questionable tomorrow
of course hes gonna play
its a damn shame when we failed so hard a drafting a big wideout we had to get a guy that hasnt played in three years lets hope he balls out
all i need from today is a couple catches to move the chains anything more than that and i will be beyond ecstatic
i think if nothing else having a dynamic that hadnt been scouted or accounted for by other teams at minimum is positive enough theres no downside to the situation whatsoever house money
i would temper my expectations

2 tds tomorrow calling it now
please let this revitalize our offense we need it so bad if we can be a threat in the air again weve got a chance to do well
if dez plays fingers crossed he grabs more receiving yards than 15 hes hungry and needs to prove himself again hes a dog and gonna fight x gon give it to ya
x gon give it to ya
dez caught it
lets go hope he can be a piece for us
i called this shit doesnt matter tho just happy to see this man coming up and getting his shot
they should play dez as a te he could be like darren waller
josh allen has stefan diggs to help him with the passing game

hopefully dez fulfills the same role
did hollywood just lose his spot
i recently saw the video with justin tucker going through his game day routines and i wanted to hear some from the fans ill go first

usually ill sleep in till 1000 or so then go and grab sushi for me and the gf

ill usually shower right after getting the sushi covid ew

then well eat sushi and catchup on new anime that came out

and ill watch the game while she does homework

typing that out i realize it sounds kinda boring lol but i would love to hear some traditions from other fans
work out get baked watch football
wake up around 6am go get some coffee

come home check my fantasy lineups

usually on reddit til about 11

shower change into my black lamar jackson t shirt

at 1225 i order 3 egg rolls and chicken wings from the chinese food place down the street

1240 i walk to the liquor store grab whatever beer i feel like having grab my food across the street from the liquor store usually get home around 1255 basically game time obviously different depending on kickoff time but yeah
take a nap before kickoff
beer
i dont know if its odd or not but one tradition i have is to wear an offensive raven tradition when we are on offense and to wear a defensive raven jersey when we are on defense as a superstition
wake up put on my ravens game day playlist put on my lucky ravens shirt check the injury list crack cold beer sit and wait til kick off
930 wake up cigarette dab cigarette
1000 shower
1005 fix my hair and get dressedno jersey yet
1030 look over all my fantasy lineups
1100 put my jersey on and start getting hype
1200 place my bets for the day
100 lock in
wake up play warzone til kickoff
i do my long run in the morning shower and people start coming over around noon my basement bar is the gathering spot and we also have the ticket
wake up only to realize i could have slept more but cant go back bc its game day

play some overwatch and check fantasy teams while on queue lose a few games

order food while taking a shower

put my 29 marlon humphrey jersey and watch the game
i live in hawaii so the 1pm game comes on at 78 am here so kinda just wake up lol unless i feel super hype then skip kickoff to walk to a sports bar in waikiki
big games steam crabsget drunk simple
wake up make my daughter and i breakfast let my wife sleep in a little bit lay my daughter down for a nap smoke a little order some wings and sit on the farthest left hand part of my couch

the couch is crucial both games weve lost this season i wasnt on the farthest left part with the arm rest chiefs i was on the futon and steelers game i sat in an office chair so i could spin and put my feet up every win ive been to the left
sushi for gameday seems sacrilegious lol i hit up the grocery store and make some sort of dipfootball food then grab a case of something for the game maybe some whiskey also
wake up smoke get coffee open the bar last minute fantasy tinker stinker smoke put on my jersey watch nfl gameday smoke do a shot game time
thats the opposite of boring my guy

having someone you can talk about anime with daily that has feelings for you is amazing

morelikable harbaugh too honestly
imagine how much its going to suck for jim at thanksgiving 2021 when john strolls in with his shiny new super bowl ring after just fading the pittsburgh steelers the week before in 680 road game

think he gets a special jersey for jim to commemorate it
i will never understand why john is not universally regarded as the better harbaugh

between alvin kamara and jkgus its clear that mark ingram is just a good man who wants to mentor the young ones happy hes with us
jk laugh is contagious
backfield so wholesome
ingram is my favorite hes just an adult kid
this the where da pussy at dance

x200b

just saying

my predictions include rivers crying at the refs every time he throws an incomplete pass like he did against us in the playoffs two years ago

on a serious note i imagine this will be a close game like 2824 and could go either way

we win you lose by a lot
a must win for us after the last week and if we want to catch up to the steelers 3420 ravens
you cant change the title but a lot of the old school fans if there are any i know reddit is kinda young lol are cringing that you called them the colts around here theyre called indianapolis sorry i am contractually obligated by my upbringing to say that lol

if we had won last week i actually think we would have lost this game it just seems like were pretty evenly matched and if we had beaten the steelers ripe for an overlooktrap game minor upset

however between harbaugh and lamar i dont expect a backtoback loss i expect lamar to be on a mission this week harbaugh doesnt do too many consecutive losses especially after bye week and especially since lamar arrived i think hollywood and dez to a lesser extent will be involved i think it will be close but i think we pull it out

good luck no injuries allowed
we may have an x factor
its going to be closer than we want but we pull it out 2320

lamar will get 100 yard rushing and 2 tds in the air and 3 tucker kicks
my boomer family members tell me you stole everything they love so a pox on your house

those legs dont stop moving
are they just celebrating mango mussolinis bigly loss
his hands just naturally want to be on the ground as his legs are moving

fixed it thanks bro
that alternate jersey is wrong the collar is supposed to be black not purple
thats dirty thanks
its going to be funny looking back at this when they get murdered on thanksgiving
yep because he had such a stellar game s
steelers didnt win that game the ravens lost it only thing ben owned that day was a ticket to the game
eh we were more owned by lamar than the steelers themselves we outgained them in every facet of the game ben cant accurately throw down the field anymore so
haha well played well played

fuck the colts and steelers i dont want any friendly banter with their fans

and im tired of all the come in peace shit from all of them fuck off
i dont really care what some reddit fan has to say and you shouldnt either
we aint friends homie
yta

ravens 01 tho
tua
seeing md put up this many points in backtoback games im lost
baby tua



listen ill be honest im only asking because im interested in placing a big bet on the ravens i know they lost stanley and i cant imagine marlon will be playing butwhat the hell i can only imagine that lamar and the whole team for that matter are gonna be fired up after a tough loss last week and much media criticism am i missing something this seems like easy money to me i appreciate any honest feedback
1 a louisville qb has never been to indianapolis
2 ravens have never won in indianapolis
3 odds are made by watching how which degenerate gamblers bet and extrapolating a line where the casino will always win

that said the ravens are in a great position to destroy the ipft

1 steelers had the first overall run defensenow a boast by the indy crowd until the ravens and their rookie rb went to work dismantling it the steelers are way better than indy
2 the browns blew them out while still putting respectable rush yards on the board despite having an inferior run game to the ravens
3 the ghost of johnny unitas will possess every baltimore player cranking them up to 11 and providing a supernatural ability to read plays
4 best cornerback duo in the league cleared to play and hungry for some punch outs and ballhawk interceptions
5 dez bryant will be playing a veteran big body receiver who will at a minimum provide a bit of run and pass blocking but who will also be an x factor for the number one run defense to contend with
6 indy cant do man coverage for shit but thats the only type of coverage that stops our pass game cant zone mandrews hollywood and big dick nick together effectively not while accounting for any of the other three snead boykin and dez
i believe the ravens outplayed the steelers last week and only lost due to a couple crucial and frankly flukey errors by lamar i still view the ravens as a top tier team the colts not so much what am i missing here
idk they fucked up

lamar is going to be fucking pissed
removed
the ravens are 15 which is like 45 points because home team advantage is three points right there
because baltimore has never won in indianapolis in franchise history
bet the farm


also there are reasons i dont bet on football
someone probably has a few million on the colts idk
thank you ravens easy win
because we have skated by so far playing shit teams indy is a good team i fully expect an l for baltimore and the next 3 games

you could try some spray on adhesive like clear flex spray or just tape it
maybe stick the whole thing in resin
air tight acrylic case out of sunlight
i would put the entire thing in a brown paper bag then store in a cool dark place

wake up i didnt even begin to sleep
im up sheesh dude
jokes on you i have been up since 4am cause im still getting adjusted to daylight savings and going to bed at like 9 every night
sleep is for the weak i will be weak in about 25 hours
ive been a fan since 2000 ive never felt like a game was so inconsequential monumental win yesterday its a beautiful day gang gamewise i hope our team doesnt sleep on their d because they have some very solid players and maybe the best d in the nfl
how are you all feeling about today
ill be at the game today rocking my brand new gold rush humphrey jersey lets fucking go bois
lets try and clean up the mistakes from last week and get dez involved
ravens4life
if we dont beat that big stupid red neck phillip rivers i may drink myself to death

this thread needs more hype

come on baltimore

x200b

x200b

edit dont tell me its early get the fuck up its game day


how about a rivers run through it
every week this season i will be doing a crappy photoshop for our matchup here are the past weeks submissions

week 1 don lamar

week 2 the texans chainsaw massacre

week 3 over the top

week 4 he got game

week 5 gladiator

week 6 eagle eye

week 7 byecentennial man

week 8 no country for old ben
stunning
this is the kind of high quality content i come to this subreddit for
more like it runs through rivers
his offense has ran thru us so far

i hope you guys win today love you
touchdowns yes
id bet he has one catch maybe three targets
prediction none of our boys have 10 catches let alone 10 targets because they wont fix the passing game and will just run the ball instead
u smoking that k2 if u think this
3 targets 2 catches for 15 yards
ill take that bet
i just feel if lamar throws a bad pass and dez catches it lamar is gonna target the fuck outta him i dont think its that crazy
10 touchdowns
ill bet you that lamar throws a pass today
honestly tho how much will be he involved i feel its just gonna be a couple snaps

but the real question is do i start him over darius slayton
today or this season
dumb af
removed
good shit go shit thats some goodshit rightthere rightthere if i do a so my self i say so thats what im talking about right there right there chorus mmmmm o0ooooooooo good shit
well done
who sent ye
imagine waking up in the morning to hate on somebody that has done so much in his 23 year of life who doesnt even know your 33 year old head ass exist rent free
at least we didnt ruin a generational qb talent and cause him to retire early


boom roasted
finally an original lamar joke
hey at least we dont have someones grandfather at qb
imagine thinking youre so funny and clever that you decided to post this what does it even feel like to be this funny and clever
if you had half a brain you would say morgan cox he is literally our best qb
just curious as to who is not playing today i beleive marlo is out
humphrey fort and moore are out ingram is a gtd but probably out we should have everyone else
dez is also playing

will be a test for our oline without stanley they did good against the steelers d tho so lets hope they continue
drafted him in fantasy and hung on to him all season lets hope so
100 from gus and jk 50 from lamar maybe duv gets a 30 yard rush or something idk
bout to put some work

x200b

tell me otherwise
100 is aiming low
i got gus


0 catches 0 targets
5 catches 56 yards 1td
very little he will give the defence something to think about as he is a complete unknown atm but as time passes teams will realise he isnt much of a threat

god i hope im wrong id love nothing more than to see flashes of his former self but it just isnt likely
not much he didnt even make the team when he tried out before the season started he didnt miraculously become a top wideout over 9 weeks hopefully im wrong

dez got that drip
furiously rifling through closet for a purple shirt
christ i forgot how huge he is
4mamba
x gonnna give it to ya
did they give him any downs today i didnt see him in once
that jersey though need that
big day
when is he going to start playing last game of the season
removed

he was pretty damn decent last season there must be a reason why hes inactive i really hope theres a reason why have to trust the coaches
i mean hes gotten passed over by ferguson whos becoming a beast at setting the edge we have ferguson signed for the next 2 years and ward is a fa in a few months plus mcphee still sets the edge incredibly well on those run downs

on third down youre not going to use him over yannick judon bowser or mcphee

he wont slide inside ever and certainly not over calais unless youre aaron donald you wont slide inside over calais on third down

so i get that hes frustrated but its not like hes getting benched because hes not talented hes just not as talented as some of literally the most talented players in the nfl
im no expert but i feel like hes more valuable than justin ellis yet they always prefer ellis so im probably wrong
i think jihad deserves to be active every week
can he play guard and replace bozeman

damn fed ex delivers dogs now
good boys
whos dick do i gotta suck to get deliveries on sundays

i hate injuries and i hate young sheldon
keep me in your thoughts boys dealing with medical emergency of a family member this morning dont think ill be screaming at my tv and commenting here like normal today cherish the time you have with your loved ones
lamar finished with a 82 completion percentage 1923
russell wilson has 4 turnovers today sometimes good players have bad games appreciate what weve got
remember when kaepernick played bad after the sb year that was roman coaching the instincts out of him and trying to turn him into peyton manning hes doing the same to lamar right now
before yall shit on bonds remember that hes like our 11th string db
you gonna ask for the ball you better fucking catch it
friccin morons just got chucked
greg roman has to goooooo
everyone deleting their wtf harbaugh comments
did judon spend the entire 17 mil on tacobell this offseason he looks slow af all year
tough road win down at halftime 52 opponent tons of injuriesinactives

itll be downplayed but sitting at 62 with only upwards to go
man i did not miss the stressful games last year was a blast
they play worse from behind is the laziest fucking take

teams do better in games where things go right and they have a lead in other news fish swim better when surrounded by water
wow lamar actually has time in the pocket and he makes a throw wonder if the two have correlation
what were they doing with that popcorn
whatever was done at halftime all credit to the coaching staff for
rivers and his wrs is really really weird its awful chemistry
second best win of the weekend
they had us in the first half ngl
have faith yall we turned it around after struggling thats the mark of a good team
lmfao whatd we do to piss off the football gods
lack of discipline big time this year
anyone checked on the availability of chris mcalister
how the fuck are we in week 9 and still lining up wrong
crazy that we went from a historically great offense to unable to move the ball after an offseason where we only lost 1 offensive lineman and our third string tight end
hollywood getting crushed on that catch was a good thing he needs to take big hits to realize that he doesnt need to play scared
fire 1st half roman hire 2nd half roman
marcus peters was just credited with his 30th interception in his 85th career game

the last 2 players to reach 30 ints in their first 85 games hall of famers deion sanders and ed reed ravensflock nflresearch

not bad
for a
runningback
o
o

l
ll
llama




even old ass rivers can escape judon lmao
i think some of you might overreact a little bit
rivers has a top 5 punchable face
we got a serious injury

gets up and runs off field
gene in the booth trying to cover his ass lmao
wrap up god damnit and thanks for always being so fucking slow judon you are seriously one of my least favorite ravens
player of the game marcus peters

interception forced fumble that led to 14 points
thank god our offense can stay on the field for 30s and help our defense who is hurtsickdidnt practice rest up
hollywood throw me ball plz

also hollywood drops ball on 3rd down
rivers talks mad shit for a guy whos never won anything
im not here for lamar slander right now what the hell is this playcalling and for all that noise hollywood made last week hes been a ghost so far and yes im also speaking on his horrific dropped pass greg roman has no creativity theres a reason no team holds onto him for that long
greg roman has killed the career of mobile qbs its fucking happening again im sick of this predictable mf
we have a serious injury here

guy gets up and does jumping jacks and jogs away
wow colts you stopped us


jk
first half vs steelers good

second half vs steelers bad



first half vs colts bad

second half vs colts good
game wasnt going good i got up and made a peanut butter and apple sandwhich sat down in front of the tv just in time to see that fumble td conclusion i must now eat peanut butter and apple every game
fire fucking greg roman this guy took at shit this year on our offense
roman needs to be fired or lamar will be kaepernicked lamar isnt playing well today but it is more obvious due to bad oline no weapons and bad play calling at the very least haurbaugh needs to be calling important plays
my god the offensive line was so trash that last drive
well im on board the fire roman wagon this is absolutely pathetc
cant wait for the postgame pressers

we need to get better

we arent making excuses

were looking at things we need to fix

we still like where we are
i can tell our play calling is better because the camera man is getting confused
jackson smiling after a play i feel like we havent seen that all season
wow we made halftime adjustments first game in a decade
i love how sassy our sub gets when were about to win a game lmao we were all melting down an hour ago
cant believe we kept that offense scoreless in the whole 2nd half defense showed up today no marlon no calais really dialed the fuck in
that green fuck is wasting popcorn
whatever they said to the team at halftime needs to be said every game
philip rivers like a turtle on his back flailing in the hot sun realizing his time is over
watching phillip rivers be angry is like the most pure pleasure
bomb to hollywood here
defense is stepping up rn really playing well considering all the losses
we get at least 3 illegal formation a game someone needs to fucking go
im looking at harbs with all these fucking penalties over 200 yards in penalties from last 3 games wtf
judon not coming back and im fine with that
this offense is like my 90 year old grandpa i love him but he moves very slowly and constantly shits himself
roman has literally spooked lamar from taking deep shots have we given dez the ball at all today hollywood talking on twitter about not getting involved roman is literally killing the chemistry of this team on the offensive side of the ball
how is this team never good in both sides of the ball at the same time lmao
too conservative on that drive theres 5 minutes left not 2
do we have to give player of the game to greg roman i mean he adjusted and set them up to succeed in the second half
you know colts miss luck should have actually protected him when you had him
he was walking looks like a cramp hopefully thats all it is
this team has 0 identity
this team seams to have lost all their charisma and energy from last year
ravens defense this ones for you marlon

marlon im not dead

ravens defense you can still hear his voice on the wind
i woke up super early to get everything done around the house i had to do before kick off
theres gonna be some tough conversations to be had in the coming months on what to do after next season buckle up flock
this team is done until roman is gone fucking trestman mornhinweg and cameron all over again
greg roman would have harbaugh activate dez without a single plan on how to use him
mp juiceman mvp so far
so bryant has been so far activated as a cheerleader
offensive pass interference is a real penalty that should sometimes be called
red zone dez time
koch gotta go in the ring of honor dude has been so consistently great for years
tucker is a god
i would love to face the colts in the playoffs if they make it
this is a huge win we get marlon back next week all the injuries and we still get the win
yeah nice job padding your stats rivers you crybaby old bitch
always sus of dpi calls they dont show the replay of
greg romans is wondering how the hell they did that
why have souljas
lmaoooo rivers
we have fast players too but never do shit like that
all of our edge defenders not named mcphee need to be taught this thing called setting the edge
im ready to throw up the x give it to dez
lamar if greg calls a bs play just call a fucking audible
colts actually play offense take notes greg roman
most deflating 107 deficit ever
what is this dude talking about they ran all over the steelers last week it has absolutely nothing to do with mark ingram
even without the injuries this team has major flaws anyone that wants to argue that they dont is crazy im not a fair weather fan and i know this team isnt a playoff team right now
lol who tf is watching replay to tell him to challenge fire them asap
come on boys my husband said if the ravens win i can put up my christmas tree
can we cut the first half ravens and sign all the 3rd quarter ravens except maybe chuck clark first half chuck clark can stay
why do they keep showing rivers on the sideline walking around spitting on his fingers what is he doing lol
hell yeah coach lets go for it
if we could eat up like 5 minutes and score a td thatd be perfect
its a lamar keeperjk you friccin morons
gus has been our best rb2 since willis mcgahee i will stand by that all day absolutely deserves a 23 year deal
stop the count
you guys whining about not going for a td there are dumb you just take the points in this situation every time
fuck bob irsay
first half was our worst of the season 2nd was the best sports and mentality are weird
hell of a fucking win
that second half was so comforting
whats the point of having souljas if they cant catch the ball
why is it that when trolls come to this sub to troll lamar their active subs are always rconservative and rdonaldtrump
dobbins didnt understand the call for sure was likely an rpo
this is gonna get ugly we have no depth our d is practice squad d
hey hollywood if you are going to bitch about not getting catches catch the ball
bonds in position to get that int because he wasnt near the receiver
yannick is a beast

they brought him in on 3rd down and lined him up to do what they brought him in to do rush the passer and disrupt the play didnt get a sack barely got a qb hit but totally disrupted rivers
can we get a young oc that will play to lamar strengths not avoid them
lamar doesnt trust his o line and for good reason thats what this boils down to
fire roman immediately
from a historically great offense to a potentially historically horrible offense in one offseason lol
this reminds of post super bowl ray rice cut pre steve smith era ravens run for 2 yards run for 2 yards check down for 3 punt and repeat
watching 3 votes per hour come in from pa over the course of 5 days was more fun than this game
put dez in
colts really would be sb contenders with luck
yo who we hire as oc at half
nice

love the urgency that dobbins ran with there
when this is over lamar should get a gold glove lmao announcer throwing huge shade on skura rightly so
we have just set the nfl record for most consecutive games with 20 points with 31
andrews blocked that man into the shadow realm
on the plus side dobbins looks great this game
i have not said one negative thing about this team ever no need to fact check its all good
that db is mandrews son now
ok looks like he might have just gotten popped on that tackle hopefully nothing serious
best rivalry renewed undefeated steelers vs the 26 cowboys lol get out of here
you literally cant kick a fg more down the middle than that
put tucker at mike lb you cowards
get the fuck out of here colts fanswe did absolutely nothing the first half and we still clapping yo cheeks
amazing win today meh first half but a very promising 2nd half
dont worry guys you can also be an nfl player like rivers all you have to do is throw constant screens and cry a lot
a ravens team that can adjust im not used to this
rip alex trebek
lol boyle was hurdling people while andrews was still at oklahoma
time for another 3 and out with shitty play calling
literally getting held the whole way down fucking terrible
the amount of times we cause fumbles everyone on the defense is one of the most astonishing things ive ever seen a defense do lol
hit me with that dopamine baltimore

lets goooooo
they know exactly what plays kill our defense screens and sweeps
harbs declining delay of game like a beast
man im just hoping for a jackson to dez 50 yard bomb
theres that dumb fucking qb run straight up the middle
real fucking clever roman jfc
that was a nice spin move by yannick
i fucking hate you greg roman


seriously
if we dont get a new oc this season or offseason so help me
but we were the fake fans and the bandwagons for calling out the shitty offense for weeks
dez bryant is not going to fix this offense
offensive line is a huge problem right now
i hope roman is fired after this
might be a good idea to block yannick
flag on baltimore for sucking fucking ass
greg man bad
the ravens have as many penalty yards 55 as total offensive yards 55 in the first half

just four first downs averaging just more than 2 yards per play ryanmink
remember when every game was a highlight reel last season good times
we got the beautiful trifecta a poor passblocking line wrs who cant get separated or catch and an oc who has zero ingenuity in the pass game recipe for another early exit in the playoffs if we make it
i wanna see the fourth down seattle game fire in lamar again
guess harbough doesnt want timeouts
harbs is good for one useless challenge per game
we have a serious injury here

player jogs off the field
i hope the halftime adjustment was telling roman he was fired if we lost and well see this level of play every time now
stop the count
a ngakoue strip sack would be real nice right now
i hope we resign bowser cant really afford to lose both our sams this offseason hes better in coverage than judon and doesnt get the stupid penalties
you hate to see these colts injuries
did anyone at amazon do research on how deshaun watson talks before they created that commercial
greg roman just told us all to stfu
step on their necks now lamar haters in shambles in other threads he looks to have is confidence back
how can we not sack philip fucking rivers
dadgummnit rivers probably
come from behind narrative is dead colts 2 defense got smacked in the face
judon got a dump truck tbh
rivers has gotta be the most overrated average qb ever
cern uses jt kick down the middle to align their supercollider accuracy
j tucker tackle 99
im shocked by the outcome of the game considering how we did 1st half lol
we got so spoiled by last year and werent very good for years before that that we forgot how it feels to win dirty grind it out games that used to be our specialty
this game was huge for lamars confidence struggled in first half came back in the second and showed why he is the reigning mvp great game from our guys
its a shame they brought in rivers instead of developing brissett
these crazy high expectations i have for this team hurt my enjoyment of ravens games week to week
this is the worst ravens offensive performance since last week
downvote me all you want but we arent going to go far in the playoffs looking like this if we even make it there at all
lamar looking as flat as flacco did from 20152018
20 game losing streak with a halftime deficit ended lamar comeback king confirmed
i swear to fucking god if we lose another pro bowler
please be cramps please be cramps please be cramps
that was a completely broken play right off the bat
remember when first downs were consistent pepridge farm remembers
someone likely dobbins messed up the call looked like rpo lamar tried to salvage
swear we are the only team that draws 0 oline holding
this is the game everyone else is going to realize how many problems the ravens have
love how they never show pi on replay anymore because they know its almost always bullshit
ah yes great hollywood takes to twitter to complain about targets then bobbles a catch for an incompletion on third down neat man neat
penalties will be the death of this team
lets chill with hollywood lol were gonna bully him till he actually sucks
clark hurdling rivers is good shit
chuck clark is the greatest 6th round pick ever fuck tom brady
bonds averett canady
you guys hating on bonds obviously dont remember my man chykie brown
im thinking of starting a changeorg petition to fire roman who will sign
3rd short and no rbs on the field lamar qb draw who wouldve guessed
im convinced the ravens are the only team that gets called for holding
what is our fucking offense it pisses mr off every week it gets worse
why yall roasting judon penalty was on mcphee wasnt it
i know everyone is emotional but people saying lamar regressed to cause this entire offence to be this poor is crazy lamar needs an oc and oline that can help him grow now that defenses have figured out his skillset

yall are acting like last year was a fluke
judon in coverage why
im not going to eat until an opposing ol gets called for holding
our offense has done nothing in this game and its tied
dude fire our oc like you know our o line is banged up so why keep lamar trying to throw in the pocket have him move out and throw like fucking a or run the ball like seriously run the fucking ball
leaveromaninindy
ok ive been reading the thread and something occurred to me

fire gr and bring in lamars louisville oc as his replacement

he surely knows how to use lamar both as a passer and a rusher
something something lamar

something something greg roman
its sad that the best part of this game is lamar not having a turnover
wow way to kill literally all the momentum
thats 3 lost fumbles inside the 10 yard line in 2 weeks what the fucking fuck
bruh harbaugh mega earth brain
glad they gave it back to gus for the td should def help his confidence after than fumble earlier
while yannick still hasnt had a sack hes applied pressure a good amount today
close this shit out dont let the colts find more ballots
no way gro is calling plays

he calls a qb draw there
uh oh you just got dobbed
holy shit that has got to be the first time ive ever seen a ravens qb pull a manningrodgers and run to the line hoping to make the defense jump as time expires

i dont even care that it didnt work im just glad lamar canwill do that
thats the 20 points in consecutive games streak
nfl record of scoring 20 for 31 consecutive games
lamar didnt do a backflip into the endzone he might not be our guy idk
its pretty amazing that even philip rivers the 100 year old statue is able to escape sacks from our pass rushers
judon looked at rivers like he was a big mac
to those of you confused about dez not seeing many snaps the guy is playing in his first game on a new team after not seeing the field in 3 years dont act so surprised
at least they burned all 3 timeouts
game over bitch
lamar really brought us our first wins in philly and indyprojected next up is chicago next year hopefully
imagine holding the ravens offense to 55 yards in the first half having the lead and blaming the refs for your loss
i wasnt very optimistic at 100 today
i was downright pessimistic at 200

i am pleasantly surprised
huge shout out to chuck clark he saved us today
that ball was so straight it makes me look gay
russell wilson got like 2 fumbles 3 picks wtf lol
that was a tuckle
man this game was huge
so buffalo figured russ out now every teams figured him out the league has film on him

s
i wonder if a win against a 52 afc team is a big game if we lost it for sure would count against lamars big game record
i guess its time for me to be a cowboys fan for the next 3 hours
is indy really trying this hard for a meaningless td
this sub is fucking embarrassing lmao
this may be unpopular but when the ravens play like they did in the first half i am unhappy

however when they play like they have so far in the second half i am happy
this game is significant


this is 31 straight games scoring 20 best in nfl history


this is the first game in 20 opportunities where we won when trailing at halftime


this half is the best our offense has looked since week 1


our defense has looked great despite missing multiple starter talents


this game bodes well for our future we are now trending up
i hate watching games that take place in a halfdome that huge bright spot on the left side of the field is gonna be annoying all day today
i think taking the sack there was the right thing to do
can we agree weve seen enough of roman
greg roman is a fucking clown hes play calling the instinct out of lamar im convinced now its not lamar its roman
lamar would have pitched it if he could bozeman got rolled on that play nothing lamar could have really done
this team is pretty hard to watch
theres literally nobody out there better than bonds we couldve gotten carr desmond king literally anyone
the utter refusal to show the pi on replay is baffling
its not that were bad i just dont see fire

give it to dobbins hes the spark right now do it three times then throw to andrews we moved like 98 yards on 11 run plays last week just do it
harbaugh gonna tweet bout his receivers after the game
werent they both at each others facemasks
i cant remember the last time i had fun watching this team play week 1 i guess
so much has gone wrong for us this year lol wtf
lmao he stepped over rivers like ai
gonna reiterate because that little stat they showed isnt getting enough attention

21 straight games w a takeaway is honestly fucking bonkers
rivers falling the way he did had me dead bruh that was hysterical
right back to bad tackling
bonds could have made this entire sub love him
lmao bonds is a clown
a lot of hate for bonds yall know hes only playing because we have an injury crisis
oh jesus kyle allen hurt bad lower part of his leg was completely in the wrong direction almost similar to alex smith
greg roman is a clown for running the same play 20 times a game please fire him
oh fuck you greg roman
these lamar runs on third down are shit
fire greg roman
a pass rush a 3 and out refreshing
these illegal formation penalties every week are so frustrating
these penalties are on harbaugh how many damn illegal formations this year already
somebody needs to be benched or fired an nfl offense playing and calling like this is pathetic
lol we get the free 15 and still find a way to fuck it up honestly this offense is shambolic
did they not just fucking knock over our kicker
lamar and other players every week we need to get better and figure it out

the whole offense every week gets worse and figures nothing out
at least yannick did something i guess
aliecox is just a step behind clintondix in terms of name quality
lamar looking sad is so different from the happy shades man
that should of been a flag just like it should of been a flag last week on pitt
lamar doesnt have enough time back there that was literally 1 second before he had to scramble along with a bad snap its just terrible on the offensive line this year
gus and jk have four carries between them

four

what the fuck is greg smoking
fire roman at half please
greg roman bad
there are two starters left on the ol one playing out of position and the other coming off a literally destroyed knee playing months before anyone expected him too but its all roman and lamar
watching those other teams highlights just makes me feel worse teams throwing to their receivers for plays down field i cant remember the last time we saw that you need to look around the league to just see how bad we are
rip alex trebek
lamar the last 5 weeks is worse than 2018 lamar his mechanics in his legs are still bettter now but he plays with no confidence and worse decision making
roman figured out he can dial up quick passes instead of passes that take 20 seconds to develop
rg3 lookin like rey from star wars with that haircut
harbaugh clearly cussed everybody out at half lol
peters is a hero
everyone switching from calling our hc stupid to a genius after the int
let lamar be lamar thats all i ask
lamar cant come from behind
i am so baffled by the offense two drives and they made moving the ball look easy as fuck
i want to throw that x up
i must confess i am calling the plays
rivers is looking very stressed out haha
absolutely must get points off this drive
we look hungry again and thats all i ask for
evan washburn said skura has a cut on his hand hence the bad snaps
bruh this lamar right now lmao
thats my mvp
what if roman is no longer calling plays in the second half but in fact dez bryant is perhaps dez is just a decoy and has spent the lats 2 years studying and building the ultimate llama playbook
maybe wind knocked out of him
patrick we need you healthy to win droy
on thanksgiving when asked what im thankful for i will say 1182020 queen just had the wind knocked out of him
baltimore had a lot of excuses not to play well this week and we used every one of them in the first half
i really need harbuagh to tell me what happened at half time
aboslutely outclassing them defensively even without gnarly marly

take a bow defense
tucker fuck you i want my damn points
tuckers out here splitting atoms down the center of the uprights
tucker right down the middle like that ball aligned with the fucking hand rail my god i love him
i want a popcorn bong
lamar and o decided to take their quarter off in the first half
ugly win but we got the dub go cowboys
game blouses
why are colts fans coming into this sub like we ever think about their team

nobody cares fuck you for calais
lets go
ps fuck the steelers
us no more injuries

boyle hurdle hurdle hurdle
levine been eating on special teams
i mean rivers should just target bonds all day dude is complete ass
ah yes a big block in the back right at the point of attack
this defense is swiss cheese today gonna be a long day
im jealous of the colts play calling
our secondary looking more like 2014 every week
were literally missing half the starters now lol gonna be a miracle if the ravens play well on defense just not enough experience and bodies to fill in the gaps
what a soldier good job hollywood
this team has a severe lack of fun
catch the fucking ball hollywood
apparently the soulja cant catch
fuck it just let dez play every snap on offense cant be worse than this can it
lol rivers
love that hurdle over rivers
this is some 2006 ravens shit every week now lol
the spirit of marlon lives on
they are going to run 30 screens today and wink wont ever stop blitzing
gettin spicy on defense i like it bonds should had that one tho
were in a good position turned the moment stopped the colts getting the ball to start the 2nd half and a chance to take the lead here
our offensive line is legit painful to watch
i miss last years offense
fire roman please
roman needs to seriously fuck off with this awful 3rd down playcalling
dont some plays seem like roman drew them up 5 minutes ago and weve never even practice them
can we implement more west coast concepts slantsquick throws every short play is a sweep or run smh or super crap screen play
our offense needs something right here atleast a long drive our defense must be gassed
most of this thread is fun and normal but i swear there are legit some people in here that are either trolls or are insane people seriously talking about well rgii may get this offense going or man i miss flacco absolutely absurd
my god this offense is pathetic to watch recently
we are such undisciplined sacks of shit today i hate watching this team at 5am every week when this is the effort they give on offense
the one time lamar had more than 1 second he made a good pass these troubles stem to the oline plus all these formation errors this is a problem from top down with the o
roman is play calling the instinct right out lamar just like he did with kaepernick
this team is just playing terrible right now
by my count we have called 3 plays where lamar stands in the pocket to throw down beyond the los hollywood drop andrew conversion and dump off for 5 years to gus bus
i am so sick of penalties
we need our defense to basically do everything they need to defend and score points

man we cant even get in justin tucker range thats how bad our offense is
oline is horrible lamars regression looks 10x worst because of the oline
can we throw the ball to dez one time next half why the hell did we activate him if we arent going to throw balls to the one contested catch receiver we fucking have fire greg roman
this is the worst offensive performance since lamar became the starter just wow so fucking bad
ayo fuck greg roman
two wrs that run a 43 and oline still cant block long enough for them to make a play
roman in the box rn i got a taste for some five guys later anyone wanna join me
alex trebek died wtf
somehow rnfl is more toxic than ever
fire cameron trestman marty roman
btw josh allen could not throw for 300 yards prior to this year josh allen was regularly throwing under 200 yards all of his rookie and 2nd year in the nfl

all of a sudden josh allen has either 3 or 4 games this year alone throwing for over 300 yards

oh i wonder what happened did josh allen suddenly learn how to throw possibly he could have gotten better from year 2 to 3 however i beti bet it has something to do with he bills going out and getting josh allen a no 1 wr

i bet you josh allen didnt just suddenly start throwing for 300 yards with the same wrs corps

he got a better wrs corp
lol fucking sums up this season doesnt it
fucking use dobbins what is this shit
this a bad challenge but if we win it i never said that
lmao harbuagh with the weekly meme challenge
what a dumb challenge

rravens are idiots
hahahahah f all you for shitting on harbs get back on the couch
2011 jags mnf or 2017 jags london are still my votes for worst offense ive ever watched that wasnt kyler boller
what a 100000 iq play by harbs tho guys
why is the o line suddenly giving lamar a clean pocket
you puny refs cannot stop the gus bus from rolling on through
roman is finally just calling a vanilla passing offense and its fucking working jesus we get too cute sometimes
we have the lead amazing halftime adjustments literally all they did was pick up the pace and didnt allow the defense time to think major props to the coaches
lamar is finally in a rhythm passing the football

enjoying this adjustment weve made to play uptempo football
i wonder who would win in a 40 yard race brady or rivers
were playing with some bde rn
id like to see dez get involved im surprised theyre not giving him some snaps to see if he can do anything
boyle putting together a nice little game 446
i know weve missed hurst but boyle has stepped up his receiving game a ton
we need to draft a new iowa lineman for our offense next season
fuck yeah dobbins
someone in this thread asked where 4th quarter lamar jackson in the seattle game went hes back baby
every time dobbins touches the ball it looks like hes one move away from taking it to the house
weve been waiting for this half the entire season
that play was so satisfying
wtf happened to roman he coulda been doing this all year
damn lamar has looked like a different player this half good for him
harrison butker missed a pat and a field goal
how was that a td with two ol knocked literally on their asses on the play side
andrews moved his ass to another state damn
did harbaugh take over offensive play calling
the ravens play so much better when i have totally given up
concussion or wind knocked out of him
looks like he got his bell rung
were literally dropping like the eagles and 49ers
stop these history stealing bastards
get it judon ahhhhhhhhhhhh
so fucking annoying how we cant make gamedeciding plays like that 3rd and 1
gus will run through a man then help him up lol i hope we resign him
every single time rivers doesnt convert hes walking around with his hands up confused he didnt get a flag gosh
imagine your kicker not being justin tucker
justin tucker might have to play corner for us soon
what is happening there
colts fans were oddly obnoxious today
rivers go ram go ram reciever i dont even know what that means
what the hell was that popcorn thing
fuck any colts fans who claim our history
just delete the first half
i still cant believe we could win while trailing at half time
im just really happy that we got stronger in the second half rather than imploding like we have been in several games this season

good bounce back win after a heartbreaking loss and a ton of injuries last week
comeback kings truzz
whats the point of having souljas that cant catch the ball never
pro tip if youre going to go on twitter to bitch about your usage ingame dont go out the next game and drop balls
call me old fashioned or sensitive but i really hate that popeyes commercial no black person should be singing for fuckin chicken lol same shit that people got mad at mc hammer a long time ago for making a kfc commercial dancing and shit for chicken
this offense is unwatchable shocking transition from last year
putting matt judon in coverage wink is so fucking silly
harbaugh needs to understand that when your oc is setting your qb up for failure its time to go idc if he won oc of the year or whatever hes lost his touch just like every other team he went to
its 230am monday here in tokyo but im fucking lit for this game lets gooooo
busted play it was fucked up from the beginning
bozeman got fucking dominated on that play
losing campbell really hurts us hope he can come back calf injuries are brutal really hope its not achilles
it really sucks bonds has to play weve been killed with those injuries also campbel with his helmet off doubt he returns
rivers should just throw to whichever receiver is guarded by bonds idk what harbaugh was saying last week when he said he played well hes terrible

i remember before the season talking about how great our secondary was then thomas punched a teammate young suffered yet another season ending injury marlon has covid averett broke a collarbone or something dorsey is now out weve got an old as shit jimmy marcus and bonds
riddle if a ball is thrown into the end zone and no flag appears was it even thrown
not looking good boys calais out humphrey out rivers is gonna pick on bonds all day if our offense cant get going this is gonna be ugly af
alright soldier
why dont you tweet about that dropped pass hollywood
can we just have a fucking 1 wr for once in our franchise history
how can an offense featuring lamar jackson at qb produce such a boring product on the field something aint right
grandpa rivers tripped on grass
i loved that hurdle over rivers so much
for anyone who wants to know why rivers needed to be hurdled

philip rivers is a notorious shit talker
rivers ate shit lol
rivers sitting on the ground pouting looked like he wants to kill taylor
if he doesnt make that play i think we were very likely on the path to an l that completely swung the momentum
that jump over rivers is the funniest shit ive seen all week
rivers just sitting there sad is the perfect fucking image so good i might nut to it
i love how we all agree bonds sucks and shouldnt be playing
15 minute break at work turn on the game long enough to see a fumble for a td good shit
safe to say bonds will not be making the hands team going forward
i despise rivers
how is carolina up 143 on kc
they dont teach you how to catch on the practice squad
levine bonds ya or nah
why do our jet sweeps always look like shit
we have the worst 3rd down play caller in the league every time qb draw fuck
lj that run up the middle aint working this season
all year these stupid up the middle lamar qb draws for 0 yards how many times do we need to see this not work
lamar jackson and ravens first three drives at indy

first downs 2

plays 14

net yards 37

punts 3


is there anyone that is still arguing that this offense isnt bad
note to roman and lamar if its third and short

the defense knows lamar is going to keep it

the announcers know lamar is going to keep it

my dog knows lamar is going to keep it

the crazy lady down the street who asks me if the futtyball is on today know lamar is going to keep it

maybe try something different
ravens with 37 total yards so far theres no excuse for that
unfortunately it doesnt even matter if roman improves the playcalls with a 2nd string offensive line
we need to start being aggressive with the passing game lamar needs to prove himself today
thats a bad replay that bitch shouldve been ejected
our ol is hot dogshit jesus christ we are missing stanley and yanda
throw the fucking ball away lamar

you dont need to try to houdini your way out of every pocket collapse jesus christ
marshal yanda is missed
greg roman cant even coach legal formations
our team went from being the most fun in the league to watch to just painful to watch we look afraid of everything
my 10000000th reminder to everyone this is why i say draft ol and not these stupid fucking wrs you all want
sam koch really out here carrying us
every time theres an illegal formation the tv coverage was showing some other random shit right before the snap and i cant see what happened
how is it even possible to go from record setting offense to utter dogshit with most of the same personnel it was this bad before ronnie went out too
we need a major revamp this offseason on offense get a new coordinator who can actually draw up a pass game
i never thought id be saying this after last season butthis team is boring as hell to watch right now
i only notice judon when he gets penalties so not worth all that money
it was just a shitty throw like what are these commentators talking about
i want nothing more at this point than for ray lewis to materialize and drive rivers through the turf
all credit to the defense theyve been so good this year but the same thing happened last game when we absolutely needed the stop we couldnt get it unfortunately if no roughing the passer was likely at least a field goal for us
that was an ubsurdly shit angle that elliot took
our offense is doodoo only way we win is with turnovers
ferguson just saved a td
im surprised they didnt flag joker
anyone defending this team right now how it stands and playing is fucking delusional
new strategy 3rd down we just throw up 5050 balls and treat it as a punt fuck it
were very lucky to be only down 3
i seriously believe our d can score a td more than our offense this is just tragic and we absolutely dont deserve a playoff spot
lamar has not attempted a single pass over 15 air yards today
can we please look into hiring a young and innovative oc
with his track record greg roman will be lucky to find another job in this league
what a dumb fucking challenge this is 2017 all over again
john is playing 4d underwater basketweaving and we playing checkers
yall can apologize to harbs now
how long do we have peters signed for i might need a jersey
using the souljas
peters really is a goat
marcus peters is that deal
oh shit sub about to hit 100k pretty cool
im holding my breath please get 6 here
rnfl banned me for calling myself retarded

insane
lamar looked like the mvp qb we saw last year on those last two drives
the quick pass adjustment really seems to do it
we have second half adjustments that is making our offense better

only took us to literally week 9 to figure out thats a good idea
thats the first time since week 1 we look like the 2019 ravens pls keep this up offense
lamars gonna be so fucking good when hes a seasoned veteran and can adjust plays to things he keys in on

no idea why people thinks is gonna work the other way around and hell get worse
lets break the record for 20 points in consecutive games
shoutout proche it wasnt long ago that punt returns used to be an absolute adventure for us
jackson is looking good
good 2nd half adjustments with the offensive scheme and its noticeable since the ravens are actually doing something on offense
theres been quite a few slips today
when its working and lamar is getting something going they look a different team i just dont trust to maintain
that was our hell ya coach lets go for it
ray rice
1182020 i learned that indy fans are whiny little pricks
this is the offense we all know and love
mvp mvp mvp
areare the 2019 ravens coming out to play
thats my fucking qb
holy fuck that was a nice fake
lamar has his swagger back patriots are shaking in their boots right now knowing that
greg roman is stunting on these hoes we are the hoes
roman snorting lines at halftime
that third and inches playcall was awesome

anyone else feel like that 4th and 3 conversion dobbins made was this years hell yeah lets go for it coach moment
stop the counting
i was all doom and gloom for the first half ill admit romans playcalling fucking has me so baffled
wish we couldve woken up last week but better late than never
if burger king comes wake me up at 6 am they are catching these hands
mandrews straight up manhandled him
i really want to know either what was said or done in half time to have such an amazing change of pace
you know harbaugh brought out the hairdryer treatment in the locker room alex ferguson would be proud
i want to hear who stood up in the locker room at half we think it was harbs or lamar or someone else
rivers is a lil bitch
20 points streak up to 31 games thats an nfl record
lets punch pq while he lays on the ground in pain lol
for whatever reason our guys are having a hard time wrapping up
at this point just put lamar in bubble wrap

the madden curse is looming and everyone else on the team is injured
put


dez


in


you


cowards
judon hate way too out of control makes plays every game
gus almost injuring orlando brown for an extra yard lol wtf
ok queens back out there
man dez was absolutely vibing on the sideline
we look back to normal now thank god for this second half whats even better we look normal with all these injuries
its amazing how were about to go 62 despite the flaws this team has just shows that if we can get things really clicking the sky is the limit we are essentially winning games with no deep passing game thats crazy
put the whole damn wolf pack in the hall of fame 3 speeches 1 induction
2410unbeilevable during that first half
not only can tucker kick and sing opera he can tackle too
tucker you beautiful bastard
fuckin jt on the tackle
tucker bb pls dont
rivers arm is garbage these days he keeps screaming at his receivers but hes trash
what a turnaround amazing
oh just kneel it you fucks no one needs to get injured this late in the game
sack the living shit out of rivers for extending the game
ol man rivers
that ol man rivers
he dont say nothing
but he must know something
excellent second half thats how we play
this offense is a joke jesus christ man wtf happened greg roman sucks
cant even sack a 40 year old
humphrey is an idiot for going out everywhere and getting covid sorry
this team is so far from contending for a super bowl its staggering blowing it last season with every possible advantage will haunt this team for a decade
lamar regressing is much cooler with every other facet of our team falling apart at the same time
why have hands if you not gon use em never
im gonna go beat off hopefully itll give them the power they need
i would pay 5 for justin tucker to kick me in the nuts
this thread is gonna lose their minds if dez catches a td lmao
this team will only be as good as the line performs
this gimmicky offense has to end just throw the ball or run it
block in the back on yannick
we are going to miss marlo so much this game
rivers is taunting bonds at the los every play
this team is never going anywhere until the offensive play calling improves roman is awful
the sun is shining the birds are chirping its a beautiful day to fire greg roman
this is some fucking jets shit
3rd 7 feels like 3rd 1000 for this offense
im convinced our oline is shit no stanley or yanda really shows
i know hollywood should have caught that but our fucking play calling is complete ass and does nothing to try and help our injured oline
is there anything in the playbook that targets the intermediate section of the field feel like all our receivers run are short and go routes
our offense has been so ass that it even fucks up on defense
refball they shouldve called the facemasks on the guy grabbing hills mask too
they have a hand in his mask too waht
we look fucking horrible already
colt holding his facemask too wtf is this bullshit man every week
another 100 yard penalty day coming up
lmaoooo why did he choose to hurdle him
lol philip rivers with the reverse jones
sorry zoomers were going back to the early 2000s ravens
x200b

nice fumble recovery touchdown by chuck clark
hold my dick hurdle over rivers
ravens defense hype as fuck
holy fuck that was awesome td rivers trying to tackle him was hilarious
lol rivers
did rivers get knocked down by manti teos girlfriend
was that rivers that got hurdled lmao
rivers saw all that purple and said hell na im too old for this shit
i think marcus peters knocked it out he may be a so so tackler but he loves to try and take the ball
did rivers try to slap him in the dick
rivers im gonna die like this
when is the meme coming
i cant get over rivers just eating shit bro
gotta make that tackle ferguson
im sick of these behind the scrimmage plays they are making to get 1020 yards every time
theyre repeatedly attacking the outside
apparently the outside run is unstoppable
damn bonds almost made himself famous with that pick
i understand we have to play him but this bonds guy isnt even close to being ready
we managed to get the d goin again so thats a great sign
im sorry skura youre still a good center
why do we always run with lamar on 3rd
the play calling has been abysmal jeezus
the ravens need to get their fucking head out of their ass when it comes to offense actually try and innovate with a you g offensive mind instead of old guard has beens we need to be more aggressive in our approach to wrs too
roman has to go im not opposed to a mid season oc change harbaugh has done it before
our deep passing game is 100 non existent nothing happens at all downfield for us its all at the line
greg roman calls a slant once maybe twice a year if were lucky
i get being upset with the play calling but its not like the team is executing the plays either we love that qb draw when lamar has the blockers and takes it to the house
it would be nice to attack down field a little bit couple plays of 10 yards
how long has it been since our last punt block seems like a real long time
god this feels like late flacco era as the offense comes on the field now that excitement is lacking
love marcus peters but he needs to chill
peters coming on the field is dumb but i love it
lamar taking an unnecessary sack
lamar just throw the ball away wtf this hero shit is killing us
i cant remember the last time we tried a deep passoverthrow
guys this isnt fun to watch
how the actual fuck is that not running into the kicker lol
the defense is the only reason we are 52
play calling is as dogshit as this line is
judon needs to be fired out of a cannon after this season holy shit why did we tag him
judon oops i fucked up again

mcphee i got you fam
even harbs is fucking queit we have no fire on this team
judon got an extra second to rush and still got stuffed
exposed already and its not even half time fucking embarrassing
remember week 1 that was fun
chuck clark is rivers nemesis today
that dude took his picture with his glasses on
fuck earl thomas
this team is so fucking undisciplined
seriously people defending this team right now im a ravens fan until i die but what exactly are you seeing that gives you any sort of confidence
remember when wed score twice in a minute versus the browns

good times
how are we so bad at penalties do the refs hate us that much or are we that much worse at it than every other team
colts are gonna get the ball back
this rn is the worst offensive showing ive seen even flaccos later years we got some first downs
throw this whole offense away
cant even snap the fucking ball correctly 4 man rush getting home
this offense really is just terrible

anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional
this fucking offensive line isnt starting caliber like they arent good enough to get it done and i dont think thats gonna be fixable inside of a game
roman needs to be fired i hope this piss poor game is enough evidence
make bienemy the highest paid coordinator ever


pipe dream
i seriously miss yanda he did such a good job on the oline
ravens offense is ass
they have 11 yard rushing the line is getting killed
greg imurdermobileqbcareers roman man fuck this guy
if we are going to sign lamar to a big contract we need to fire roman we need to see how he does in another system before we sign him to a massive deal cuz how he is playing right now right now is not good and until we can see if its a system thing by putting in a new system its very risky to give him a massive deal im just putting it how it is which breaks my heart cuz i love lamar i want him to really be a beast and hope its just a system issue
greg adam gase roman
goddamn it 2020 rip alex a true g
watching the highlights this line is swiss cheese im shocked we even had time for some of those out routes
is ben powers really so bad that he cant see the field our line is so dogshit and he still cant break into the starting lineup
is it too late to bring kubiak back
this is the offense i remember from last year pace push
redzone dez
lamar cant play better than that
drafted dobbins in the 2nd round for him to ride the bench every game nice
peters shouldve picked that too i hate this game
he made like 5 steps without jiggling the ball
might as well lose a timeout in a close game for no reason
why cant we see the relay again exactly fuck your commercials
apologize to harbaugh now
yall shut the fuck up from your couches about challenging that fucking play now
what a seriously strange call by the refs honestly would never have expected that in a million years wild
love the fucking adjustement multiple recieving options on every play i wanna see us hit outside the numbers more still but plz let this be a sign that we know what to do
gene you fucked up that call back then shut the hell up with your revisionist bs
james urban gotta be calling these plays
give dez a 5050 ball for the memes


ubanjoeyo
holy shit 3rd and short and roman didnt call a qb dive still a dive though
please god let me bitch at the refs to the fullest of my ability

phillip rivers
he just scored 2 tds in like 10 seconds wow
offense has looked really good so far this half keep it up
should be 2110 now but whatever
ravens score a rushing td
greg roman well how about we just thro
everyone in this sub dont you fcking dare
guys can we all agree that the playcalling we great on that goal line series dont get cute just run fucking forward
i agree with the announcers i love the pace as well as trusting gus
hell yeah gro that i form in the redzone gets me erect
another rivers pick incoming
i just said tuckers balls look extra crisp today out loud and i dont regret it at all
big stop here
we have some major momentum
lamar just threw up the big truzz hands sign of a strong drive
colts have one call go against them and their fans lose their minds
this offense looks 100 different this legit cant be groman
who knew we had another te besides andrews that can catch a ball
dobbins was wide open
jk all day
aggressive offense good
yes dobbins
see what happens when you use dobbins
what the hell are these shitty snaps
gutsy call

love harbs
1 yard for the colts in the 2nd half 1
dobbins is our rb1 of the future we got a diamond boys
ill bet you 100 bucks ingram gave a half time speech
time of possession in the third quarter baltimoreluke

ravens 1341

indianapolis 119
this is a completely different team why does it take a half to see these flashes
are we in 2019
id put money lamar was 100 behind that audible thats what you want from your qb
lamar jackson playing like 2019
were taking the colts and were fuckin em up the ass
lamar and finish that block mark lol
mvp lamar back on the menu boyss order up and feast on the beauty
romanharbs put in dez next series to build chemistry with lamar during live play
who got chewed into at halftime for this turn around
he said free kodak lmfao
were good again
gotta gove credit the play selection has gotten a lot better this half i like seeing the swag out there
andrews blocked 30 into the shadow zone
that was not a fucking first down
win or lose this has been a gritty performance by a badly mangled ravens squad
how did rivers outrun our pass rushers lol
not queen
please god not queen
it doesnt seem like were blitzing were sending 4 guys most of the time
the dudes superbowl ring hat lmao
queen back in
defense stands
holy shit judon blew that the fuck up
getdezacatch
that played seemed weird handing it off 5 yards behind the line on 3rd and 1
gus has gotten 80 of carries in this game and is clearly out of gas to some degree lets get jk who as much as i like gus busis our real future at rb some touches also i have him in ff shoosh
why did the colts go with rivers the colts are a talented team and they went with a below average qb i feel like cam would flourish there
thays such a nice streak to break
go back to the fucking bench rivers you whiny annoying old fuck
what kinda garbage team loses to the ravens when leading at halftime
lamar is way more animated right now on the sidelines

rivers is discount brady with the call begging
so we should look to draft high for olinemen and wr and te for next year
lmao rivers quit begging for a flag
rivers needs to retire
running behind bozeman is a recipe for disaster
i dont know if ive ever seen a 48 yarder that dead center lol
elite tackler justin tucker
damn tuck on the tackle
even tucker goes for the ball lol
tucker going for the strip
its nice to be completely calm when the field goal kicker comes on the field id imagine three maybe four other teams have that kind of luxury but none of them have the automatic three that is justin tucker
phillip rivers is somehow a bigger crybaby than tom brady holy shit
tucker better not hurt that golden leg on some bullshit tackle
this will be the first time we ever win in indy holy shit
can we like not give them a garbage time td though
this game showed that good lamar still exists its just a matter of figuring out how to keep him consistent
hyped for some sunday night football next week lfg
huge confidence boost in this team after that
man i miss last year last years team was unstoppable and always looked like they were having fun this years team reminds me too much if those bad flacco years
whats the point of using soliders if they drop fucking passes
fuck me we are losing contain on whichever side mcphee isnt on

please god take my legs to heal campbells
this game is all roman if hes not gone monday this organization needs to explain themselves the illegal formation penalties alone
we cant block everything has to be quicker id hoped lamar would know this but the fact that it seems greg roman doesnt know this is a serious fucking problem
lamar needs to stop looking like a sad ass puppy and get hyped
halftime adjustment fire offensive coordinator
this offense is abysmal rn sigh
lamar doesnt trust his o line he doesnt trust his oc he doesnt trust his receivers and thus he isnt playing with the same fire it is really sad to watch
fuck greg roman all my homies hate greg roman
man this team is turning into a dumpster fire at rapid speed
you better stop fucking tweeting if you cant even hold on to a five yard pass hollywood
defense has done more than their job we need the offense to step up here
yeah i think im officially done thinking were contenders in what fucking world are we contenders if we lose today greg roman needs to be gone by this week no way in hell is this acceptable after last years success
damn they got the geek squad dude from best buy to kick
people who wanna say were 52 to defend anything need to look at the schedule

team hasnt been playing like a 52 team whatsoever
ty hilton is out for the colts
fuck phillip rivers
hes up walking please please please be ok
injuries are coming for us this year damn man
burger burger burger
please god no we need campbell
less than 60 completion rate in 4 of 5 games
bozeman got pushed way back
was bozemen supposed to pull but he got blown up
so ready to move on from roman his shit has gone stale
pitching it was not the move their linebacker was right there
roman this is the first drive what the fuck
greg roman has had one good game this year and the rest have been absolutely awful
fuck you greg roman seriously
this playing call has got to stop
nice on track to get another 10 flags
roman has to do something this week man that dude is so bad
its going to be a long day
trash call and miss the blatant hold in the backfield its last week all over again
ralph wiggum haha were in danger
losing our 2 best defenders hurts a lot
we have to have the most pass interference calls against our d in the nfl
i wanna question that pi call looked like clark was on the ground when the ball was thrown but of course we cant get a replay
were good just one score lets go get it back
lets watch offence come out throwing for an incomplete run for 3 yards and then out on a 3rd and long
sigh nice to see lamar audible tho
cmon hollywood
starting early with ref bullshit
here we go with the penalties
oh my god are you serious he was holding hills facemask for a couple seconds before he grabbed back
harbaugh please do something
if you wanna be a soulja you have to catch the damn ball
it seems like teams took away mark andrews and put a spy or two on lamar and we just cant make plays anymore
our defence is better at offence than our offence is
fly chuckie fly

fall phil fall
hurdling over rivers
did rivers just fall down on his own
look at me im the offense now
mp juiceman picking up where hump wouldve been
chuck making up for the pi
oh man that picture ove rivers being hurdled
good time to mention phillllip rivers was 04 against maryland in college
why does wink think he can leave these 3rd string dbs on an island
defense is and always will be the raven way
chuck jumping rivers made me laugh so hard
did rivers seriously just straight up fall down unassisted if so thats amazing lol
seriously can they call oline holding once against our opponent
feels like the washington game but with a better team screens and bad tackling
we may as well make wink the oc
defense is really good but almost every single misdirection play fucks us
oh god i cant wait for the meme of rivers on that play
it sucks seeing how creative the colts offense is
seriously tho why didnt clark just run around rivers why go over himlol
bonds you dumbass
good stand by the defense hopefully offense now has had a chance to breathe and can set their own tempo
baby you had that
throw the ball down the field please
why did they not punt into the sideline easily make the distance punt and pin it at the 5 surely
skura has a boo boo
what the hell was that fake reverse to duvernay i hate this play calling let lamar get passing reps pound the ball
i think we should move to a no huddle offense with lamar being able to run teams would be fucked
call a fucking slant and lamar will run if its not there
fuck you greg roman

stop being predictable
bozeman getting beat inside and just watching lj get tackled
its getting to the point where im concerned this offense is going to ruin the confidence of lamar permanently
the thing that im honestly refreshed about is that i now know the offensive regression isnt lamar
insane how week after week of dogshit playcalling we still score 20
pathetic joke of a fucking play call wtf man
can jackson not run it every 3rd down pls

done with greg roman
so yeah yanda was a hof caliber player and he wasnt adequately replaced and it matters a lot
alright im over romans play calling
so looks like yanda was the only reason we were good last year

just kidding but wtf is going on
roman gotta go
we dont have the line to run like last year anymore
leonard is so good and our playcalling is so limp dicked
maybe our defense can score 3 touchdowns today
are there more than five plays in the playbook seriously doesnt seem like it sometimes
greg romans playcalling has been so one dimensional these last few weeks
all i can say is if were about hundreds of millions of dollars on lamars next contract he better show up in games like this lets be aggressive and let lamar throw it
we have the second worst passing attack in the nfl we are barely better than adam gases jets
i dont understand how our play calling continues to be this bad
i am sorry yall can downvote me all you want but lamar looks scarily similar to rg3 in 2013 at least robert had the excuse of coming back from a shredded knee
juice man please dont do that
peters is such a fucking dog
leave roman in indy after this game thanks
ill take that every day from mekari mp a real one too
peters defending lamar is the kind of fire this team needs yall crazy for yellin at him flock up boyz
lamar doesnt even think to throw the ball away
jackson does not look calm at all
lamar really likes to run backwards
fire greg roman for allowing that sack and then holding on 3rd and long im tired of this terrible offensive coordinator
335 cool
3rd and 35 this offense is shit
team is playing so fucking garbage right do we hold the record for flag thrown it feels like we do zero teamwork zero everything this beyond fucking embarrassing team is collapsing every game and its showing today
well at least the special teams unit is still top notch
this is good old mid 2010s ravens football
this is the first year i have seen where i feel like our fundamentals are incredibly lacklustre i think we had one year where we didnt tackle but at least we could line up appropriately
52 yards in the half yikes
cant believe that didnt get flagged
this would be the perfect time to get a 2 minute drill rolling get the offense and lamar some confidence and at least go in with 3 at the half
how are we even still in this game
gene steratore changing stories on the same hit week by week
not sure theres enough time to move down the field just hoping lamar doesnt throw an interception
last week lamar lost his first game where he was leading at half lets see if he can get his first win after trailing at halftime
more flags ya dont say
aaaaaaand more flags this team is lost
cant wait for the offense to do nothing again
we need 21 to return to being our hype man i want to see him on the sidelines pumping the guys up and bringing the swagger back everytime i see lamar sitting there looking sad it just brings back too many flacco memories
these penalties by us are out of control this year
this doesnt even look like a fringe playoff team today
fuck you greg roman
guess roman looking at popeyes menu instead of calling logical plays
embarrassing very close to incompetence
offensive line is getting spanked
play calling is awful
holy shit this o line is tragic
skura has made more bad snaps than good yanda made skura look good
shit playcalling shit offensive line undisciplined penalties really is looking grim for us midseason
1 run offense in the league and they ran it 10 times in the entire 1st half
that was an unbearable first half jfc
if we cant get tucker attempting a field goal something is wayyyyyy wrong
the oline is just a wet kleenex today
watching rivers get cucked on the fumble recovery was worth the price of us being very boring for 2955 seconds
so when do we fire greg roman
can yall stop with harbaugh he has fired multiple ocs before he knows when to move on
such a weird time for a game to start are we ready flock
can we fire roman now
hosts all having a somber conversation about the death of alex trebek

cbs the nfl on cbs is brought to you by verizon
since we all want him fired who do we replace as oc who do we promote or is there even anyone available
can we hire lamars college oc he knows how to use lamar in the perfect situations also in college the teams oline wasnt good at all but still found ways to make plays with him
im not even mad anymore just disappointed
well good tackle hollywood
this team is ridiculously snake bitten everytime we get something going on offence we have a fumble
cant believe lamar caused edwards to fumble
loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool

somehow this team this year finds a way
guess lamar should have done it all the drive and kept it there
this game is literally torture
lmao this is such a different team than last year its fucking shocking
good we were finally moving the ball

bad we fumbled
fuck he took 3 steps could that be a fumble
what kind of fucking challenge is that
who needs timeouts anyways jesus christ
theres zero chance this gets overturned
that drive was pretty great until the fumble though if we can come back and do that again on the next drive it will be amazing
galaxy brain harbs
i think the refs just cheated for us
i want everyone who said its a stupid challenge to go fuck themselves fuck you
id like to point out that dez bryant is to thank for that being ruled an interception already contributing
lmao no fucking way
someone on this sub called a pick and forced fumble for peters didnt think it would happen tho
as a colts fan i would be fucking livid with the score and the way this game goes in every aspect
the ravens changed something at the half the offense is clicking outside that damn fumble
say what you want about hollywood he spoke his mind and it worked cant knock him for it especially when hes backing it up
fuck yall for doubting btw
look guys way too many of us calling the other half fucked up for saying it was a bad challenge this sub is get to me toxic when we are not performing eat your words and move on
is it just me that prefers ian eagle or kevin harlan over the tony romo crew
hope leonard is okay
alex collins just got a carry and went nowhere

flashbacks
its interesting to see the half time adjustments so far we are pressing our linemen forward on every play so even in pass protection were having them use a run blocking technique its creating space and allowing them to play aggressive
lmao id be pissed if i were a colts fan
gus bus redemption
lets goooooo great adjustments
anyone see what mark andrews was upset about we get 42 replays on shit we dont want to see and 0 replays on anything we do
let lamar cook
forgot yannick was on the fucking team
lets dominate now
lamar got his zip back
oh look a miles boykin sighting
seriously where tf has this been all year
let lamar cook
damn it i new the panthers were gonna cock that up
colts field is terrible today
go for it just not a draw plz
i know a lot of people have been making this comparison but damn dobbins looking like a carbon copy of ray rice just a tick quicker imo
vintage llama
did greg roman randomly remember which team he coordinates for this is actually an enjoyable drive for once
i seriously want to know what happened at half

this is a completely different offense
looks like we woke up
touchdown lamar lets fucking go
jackson is good at running
what a tale of two halves here jackson found whatever he was lacking
lfg
great play call
look at this dude doing spins and shit
okay we see you now reigning mvp
lamar jackson all alone fakes the defense with the bootleg and takes the football into the endzone for six
yeah lamar is back its just good to see him having fun out there again
andrews had a monster block on lamars touchdown run you love to see it
wtf where is this coming from
im so happy rn i really hope this our offenses bounce back game
this is what frustrates me about our offense everybody knows that they can do better like theyre doing right now and thats what makes it worse when they play like dog crap
rumour has it gr is stuck on the shitter and some random dude is calling plays in his absence
really good play call by greg roman colts get sucked inside and lamar jackson takes it outside on 3rdandinches and jackson scores from 9 yards out ravens lead 2110 and theyve now scored 20plus for an nfl record 31 consecutive games jeffzrebiec
fucking great drive but darius leonhard is a fucking beast i feel its harder now to stick out at lb since teams run less and you have to be versatile rather than just a big hitter but hes all over the field this game
madabuike is going to be our secret weapon
u let rivers do that to you d
jesus christ how do you let that conversion happen
oh no not queen come roty you got this
the reason im critical of roman is because he is so reluctant to evolve with lamar that first half he was calling the game like it was 2018 first start ever and not the reigning mvp
queen ate that hope hes good
oh just fade me fam
go ahead and keep that clock running that is fine with me
yall should know the queen never dies
close it out with the run game i will say this game has given me hope because of the way we rallied we also came back from being behind
bring dez in you cowards
im actually kinda confused how we just turned it around was pacing that big of a deal
grover moves well for a guy born in the 1840s
what the hell was mekari doing on that play
still cant get over that challenge amazing call by coach harbaugh
steelers cowboys hasnt been an actual rivalry since the 70s 80s at the latest get the fuck outta here steelers are gonna cream the cowboys anyways and everyone knows that
i know its not going to happen but if the cowboys beat the steelers man thatd be sweet
cry me a rivers
more points

more points
every excuse in the book to lose this game and if they win i will be blown away by what harbaugh is able to get out of his squads year after year
barring a minnesota event we should pull this off
tucker is so much better than any other kicker it constantly amazes me how straight his kicks travel
that was so straight it couldve hit the hand rail if there wasnt a net
omg that scream tucker let out when he kicked it
good to see lamar enjoying himself on the sideline
jt with the tackle lmao
tucker wrapping up lol
tucker with the tackle he does it all
justin tucker out there making tackles
tucker with the tackle
yeah jt make that fuckin tackle
what is going on there
greg roman must have gotten bitched at during halftime cuz that play calling was much much better
our offense is more boring to watch than the flacco days right now just so plain and nothing exciting at all something has to change
didnt that guy demand to get the ball more
the colts got a 3 and out they should fire their offensive coordinator
and some of yall still think everything is fine and dandy lmao
it doesnt seem like the ravens staff are coaching lamar at all hes regressing from week to week
we have 55 total yards on offense
ill start it here blame of the game greg roman
colts fans go to your own sub nerds
defense playing really good considering half of them couldnt even practice
idc about the down votes i love this team but they are not as good as we all think they are
it would be 100 if not for our defense


remember that
damn that water girl had a phat ass
80 year old phillip rivers is going to walk all over us while our mvp lead offense cant do jack shit
ok lamar lets not suck ass here
use yo souljas precedes to drop the fucking pass
lol you guys saying cut bonds we have 3 active cbs good luck with that
dropping judon into coverage
stop putting judon in fucking coverage
currently its looking like 7 straight games of lamar not having over 250 passing yards something needs to change fast
i love that marquise brown made a big deal about not getting enough targets then drops the fucking ball when passed to we definitely need to look into more options in the passing game
ready to lose nnn with a 40 point win today
is this a short movie about the colts move away from baltimore
when i hear this guy pronounce his name eyein instead of ian i always think of the key peele substitute teacher skits
fuck robert irsay
lotta banners not a lot of hardware
campbell fuck
noooo campbell please no
not campbell
walking off on his own so hopefully not too serious
he looks fine
were starting down the 49ers path
the injury plague our old friend
hell yeah we sniffed out 2 screens on the first drive already
well that was terrible
i know the d is tired as hell with how often with how our offense goes 3 and out
fuck young sheldon
oh nice just got here and were already losin it

ill have another drink
if they start spreading it out it could get ugly
wow a simple crossing route we should get an oc who knows that one
bonds is the new kyle arrington
god bonds sucks
covid week hit the team hard
these are the plays we should be running on offense dude
just throw it to dez every play screw it
clear pi
alright time for atrocious play calling
bonds just walked alongside with their lineman at least pretend youre trying man
fuck it unleash dez
alright lamar time to wake up from your four week slumber son
cant wait to see our coaching staff get spooked cause we are behind by 7
whatever bro we need to be down some games so lamar can at least try to play from behind
i feel bad for harbaugh he is an excellent coach but his coordinators fail him too often specifically on offense dean pees era defense
well were behind so roman is going to go ahead and call deep bombs for incompletions the rest of the game
uggg our defense is wrecked with injuries man losing humph and campbell is a death sentence
can lamar hit that mute button on greg
humphrey lj fort and campbell all out not to mention the lack of practice this week people need to stop acting like this is gonna be a normal defensive game
whelp guess ill take 97 and a sb over 142 and one and done
cant even snap it right this is going bad
elite play design
now throw it to dez lol
how did we run on the steelers
come on hollywood
what an awful drop
what the fuck play was that he held his mask the entire way
if youre gonna ask for the ball you gotta catch it when it comes to you
it will be malpractice if this organization does not do whatever it takes to find some weapons at the receiver position this offseason
soulja boi with the fucking drop
this sub youre not a real fan if you even think about criticizing lamar


also this sub after hollywood drops a pass worst receiver on this team get him out of here i hope he never plays again
i take back my words immediately
old man rivers down
yes chuck clark
the ghost that tripped daniel jones strikes again
stunt on these hoes chuck
our defense will make up for our sorry offense at least
damn marlon is rubbing off on peters
gimme dat chuck fuck
ravens defense baby i was getting a little concerned
my boi chuck clark
our defense is our offense lets go
how nice of phil to just get out of the way like that
there we go momentum shift
i love chuck clark so fucking much what an amazing leader and damn good player
good luck chuck
howd them balls look phil
i love rivers on his back like a helpless fat kid and chuck hurdling over him lol
wow did we ever need that
isnt it crazy how every time we force a fumble the ball just bounces right into one of our players hands
lol that hurdle over the limp rivers
i went to pee at the wrong time and completely missed it
the defence is just getting completely shredded on the edge
can we just try and stop an outside run maybe

nice hands feet
of course cant even take a free pick
bonds you could have redeemed yourself
bonds letting opportunity slip through his fingers
this is the last time i pick any players from my fav team on draftkings i have too high expectations for these guys smfh
i like the dump off there actually he sometimes doesnt take those
4 dudes unblocked sprinting at duv
lol running the flacco to rice dumpoff offense
who would have thought that short passes and end arounds wouldnt work if people dont respect your intermediatedeep passing game
just quit with the shitty qb draw
why is this man keep calling running plays on 3rd downs like wtf
that fucking play lmao
jokes on charles davis we dont even have our wrs running routes
i dont understand how our offense is this bad
these fucking qb draws oh my god
if this team has any sense of pride greg roman gets fired
this is atrocious how the fuck are we playing like its the early 2000s

our defense is the only reason this isnt embarrassing us
im applying for the ravens offensive coordinator job today
what happened to lamar throwing the ball down the middle for 20 yards havent seen it in a while
yall blaming roman 100 when the line should get like 7080 of the blame
they need to start calling the blocks in the back on those screens
now that weve made the stop can this offense please fucking do something
rivers is such a bitch all the whine of brady without being the goat
yay ngakoue disrupted rivers throw on 3rd down
whens the last time lamar took a deep shot downfield this year i cant remember
well im curious maybe you guys would know more about that stat of ravens vs colts how many of those wins at indy are because of peyton manning
play calling on offense is god awful
boyle wide open in flat but lamar wont get off the first read
remember the first game against the browns when lamar actually had a pocket to work with what happened
dude was in hella traffic and he still threw it there
they throw the exact same spots every play
lamar doing his best flacco impression last few weeks
at least our team sticks up for our qb

poor andy dalton lmao
pussy ass play by 32
hell yah love peters getting involved there at least theres someone on this team with fire
marcus peters wants all the smoke
that was dirty af
here is our weekly illegal formation
we went from offensive powerhouse to offensive garden shed really quickly
romans offense is toast its been figured out it doesnt help that our oline is really bad too but everything is at play to make this offense just bad
ol predictably shakeyfor all those bitching about this or that if you cant block anyone you are going to struggle
check it down to ray rice
how was that 2nd hit not a defenseless receiver
the way this offense looks does not give me hope for our success down the road mainly the playoffs
and where tf is dez we have nothing to lose from an offensive standpoint
harbaugh decosta your oc is ruining your generational franchise qb
this offensive line is killing us lamar seems less shifty this season madden curse is real
ravens offense letting down the ravens defense tale as old as time
starting to think last year was a fluke playcalling is horrendous receivers suck oline is terrible and lamar has looked exceptionally bad
absolute bullshit roughing the passer
judon is gone next year
all the hate for roman should be directed as love to martindale hes so good and has been under appreciated so far this season
i will never understand why the live video gets the smaller view when they do the picture in picture replay
dejected lamar looks like dejected flacco circa 2017
our mistakes are entirely our own aggravating
why are we so undisciplined i swear we have 10 penalties against us a game
what can judon do
judon 20 yds downfield what
im being honest this looking like a 97 team boys with the way this offense plays
thats a penalty
we got lucky on that play should have definitely been a penalty
almost at the point where i hope colts blow us out just so this is a wake up call
i cant wait for ryan and mink to be like dont worry probowl mark ingram is gonna turn this into a number 1 offense fuck those clowns
so were gonna make halftime adjus lol i cant even finish that joke of a sentence
cut down the penalties man holy shit every phase of the game were doing stupid things
think well see a 10yd pass
how many penalties does it take for the ravens to start actually start fixing it
its crazy were only down by 3 feels like were losing by a lot more
this offense is abysmal
i think i just seen 1 wr run a route on 3rd
this is fucking pathetic
shoutout to drake and the madden cover
better chance of scoring on defense than offense
should we move mekari to center
this game is not as close as the score indicates we are complete dogshit and are not winning this with the way the offense is playing right now lamar looks pathetic his body language is awful gro is trash as usual

we are not shooting our selves in the foot we flat out are not a good team and we are regressing not getting better
run run pass to give the colts the ball back

leave greg roman in indy
this team went from on fire to fizzled out
something is killing this team chemistry it needs to be fixed

im over my buddy saying that the indy defense is some force making this team look this bad
greg roman as hc the team would go 016
lamar needs to be much better and roman is fucking trash
dez enthusiast here has he seen the field or any targets yet today im out shopping
indy defense is playing fast
fuck greg roman on god not another week with him as oc making lamar look so bad when u can take us all they way fucking roman calling horrible plays at crucial moments
a first down
2 first downs am i dreaming lfg
now this is pod racing
hey look everybody offense
dont fucking jinx it nobody say anything
we have more yards in this opening drive than the entire first half they serve some red bull at halftime
you gotta be fucking kidding me
edwards cant do that man first drive and a chance to gain momentum and we do that
the gus bus ran out of gas
nice tackle by brown at least
ah there it is
come on guys we have a pulse lets go
rare peters drop
basic fucking shit

do the basicfuckingshit
brown may be afraid to take a hit but hell make one himself
a challenge bruh
just coming to the thread to see how that turnover was lamars fault
its like we got the car started finally to crash into a fucking wall
bold call harbs but i aint mad at you for it
awful challenge we might need this timeout later
ok harbaugh lol guess he didnt learn from last week
i wouldnt even challenge that in madden
harbaugh im sorry lmaoo
holy shit that was reversed
holy shit how did we win that challenge
harbaugh you fucking genius
dude i didnt think there was any chance that was a pick omg
i was ready to shit on harbaugh for blowing a timeout but he showed me
that was a gift
that would get me mad as a colts fan i dont see that at all tbh
ive been watching football for 15 years and i still have no idea what constitutes a catch
i tip my cap to coach harbaugh id never thought that was going to be reversed
put peters in at wr
hollywood my guy not so bad getting hit keep it going
our passing game of all things is suddenly carrying
and thats why harbaugh is one of the best coaches in the league belee dat
remember the heisman package
i hope hes good but sit out the rest of the game please
say what you want about lamars play i still love seeing him help other players up and checking on them
i need a mp juiceman wallpaper this week please
id love to see us throw in dez in the redzone even if just as a decoy dude was always so lethal there
how many of you think we should double dip on ol in the draft this year with 2 of our top 3 picks
lamar looking poise
damn i hope leonard is ok hate seeing guys get hurt
james urban to roman let me call some plays big dawg
i think roman read the sub and decided to try the last 2 drives because he knows we would actually call for his job 100 serious
looking back wed be fucked if we only had gus and justice hill
something big time changed at half time finally we find ourselves in a game where were capable of making half time adjustments
championship teams make adjustments at the half so this bodes well i guess
he was very clearly in
ill take it gus
i remember someone named jackson giving his team some of his sekrit stuff during halftime to make them improve
im telling yall urban calling these plays not 1 qb run on the goaline aint possible for roman
honk honk honk
now do it again
okay offense do that for the rest of the season ill forgive you
points off of a turnover magical
offense is clicking a bit more this halfnot sure if they saw something or what but i wont complain
looks like we found some offense at halftime hope we have more where that came from
damn did we actually make halftime adjustments for once
its so nice to see tucker on the field again
that was agonizing no lie 3 quarters for 1 td coaches need to be held accountable for these terrible performances tired of the after game on to the next one speech
now that were in a good mood id like to point out that after dobbins edit it was gus fumbled he punched it out on the guy who recovered that was pretty dope
colts fans dropping by to instigate peyton is a bronco and considers himself a bronco
now watch as greg roman never uses an up tempo offense ever again
i hate the archaic nature of playcalling still prevalent in the league like omg what a surprise the offense finds a rhythm playing with some pace and the qb gaining some confidence
whats the latest with calais
thanks for adding to our meme catalogue lamar
if they show the sideline be on the lookout for james urban with a playsheet calling plays
how the fuck has chark gotten me nearly 25 fantasy points with a 3rd stringer qb
this second half might be one of the first halfs of this year that the offense feels like last years offense
rare boykin sighting
anybody else is just waiting to see dez on the field for one play at least lol
this is so much like 2019 keep it up
i really hope we see dez more seems like a waste of an activation if not
jackson accidentally faked himself into the sixth dimension
fuck injuries
dobbins was open
dobbins was wide fucking open lamar
midseason offensive mvp is bozeman
take the easy fucking completion dude
lamar needs to take the easy completion there he had dobbins and snead wide open get it to them and let them get the 1st
what is up with skura today
i think i can snap better and possibly block better and im a 53 woman
ill lowkey take a field goal as long as we dont turn it over

rivers is beyond washed
defences are so clued in on the qb draw that we can expose outside runs on those plays
geez dobbins is good
you take that unitas jersey off right fuckin now
first half offense bad

second half offense good
did they find 2019 lamar in the locker room this is fun to watch now
we have 174x more yards than them in this half
lamar jackson is 1822 today 81
gro lowkey calling some heat rn and you guys real fuckin quiet
im loving the bewildered look on rivers face everytime the camera pans to him
credit to lamar for handling these shit snaps
lfgggg
beautiful
welcome back last years offense greg did you learn anything on this drive
action jackson
thats the one
beautiful lets fucking go
llama
you would think a lamar bootleg is the most obvious play of all time but it worked
inject that drive into my veins
lamar got his mojo back
is this this years version of last years seahawks game
way to snap out of the coma guys
llama
fun lamar is soooo fucking dangerous and sooo much better than angry lamar just keep having fun man
who knew calling balanced and 6040 run heavy series makes the ravens score
andrews obliterated his defender on that td run lol
lamar has awoken
time to get mom a nintendo switch
glad to see we went back to last years offense someone told greg to cop on at half time
this is what happens when we start calling throws downfield that develop quickly
wouldnt it be fuckin crazy if we found out harbaugh took play calling away from roman at the half
i think were finally gonna end that horrible losing at halftime streak
colts defense fighting over whos turn is it to destroy bozeman
im hard hard as rock once you make that coochie pop

pop that coochie pop pop that coochie baby
the colts have awoken a beastand hes hungry
we gotta have a different playcaller i dont see otherwise how this offense just became so different than the rest of the year
throw the first half team to the trash and please keep the second half team we look so competent dammit
rivers is so bitch made
andrews blocked that guy into a completely different sport
i just want to see lamar run this new offense our lama has an edge this second half
not our queen
damn if they didnt get that i think that was game
looks like a stinger
can 2020 stop exerting its influence on this team
i cant believe rivers is extending plays on us
that ravens fan in the stand th0
all good it looks like may just had the wind knocked out of him
ferguson has made some really nice tackles today
they are killing the clock themselves
queen is immortal just like elizabeth
indys burning a lot of clock for not a lot of gain on this drive
lets go d force a turnover
judon lol
judon made a play like you want from a franchise tag guy
thats a terrible situational play calling kick it lol
ran over the rb to hit the arm body built by taco bell
i just wanna know what the halftime speech in the lockeroom was i need that
run the clock add a fg go home
man i wouldve liked a little more misdirection on that play had a chance to basically seal the game
looked like opi to me
no flag im impressed
i hate rivers
shocked there was no flag lol
rivers is a whiny bitch
shut up rivers
theres another hit terry bonds
rivers is such a bitch
wow bonds didnt get burnt on that 3rd down holy shit
420 left time to spark up
dobbins plays a lot of madden
legit right down the middle love me some tucker
tucker just wants to remind people that hes the best there is best there was best there ever will be
as a straight guy i have no problem admitting that i would totally have justin tuckers babies
tucker the fucker with the tackle
tucker the fucker bro chill lmao
tucker tackle
tucker really can do it all
go ahead tuck saved a td return
that popcorn machine leaves so many questions
finally call the block in the back on the colts been getting away with it on screens all day
why was there no 10 second run off for the block in the back
guys we actually came back at the half
bonds hasnt been spectacular but he has been way better than expected this game
good to see a game that wasnt clusterfucked w penalties on our end
big win felt good after the adjustments made at the half
i went to work after the half so i wasnt watching i think im bad luck when i watch

for proof i point to the time walked into the room right as cundiff fucked up

so uh yall are welcome
if greg roman is still our oc for next season idk what i would do

what a stupid fucking play on 3rd and 3
have a bad feeling about this game especially if our offense stays stagnant
im sure the defense is really going to appreciate this 3andout coming up
we fucking suck
bitches on twitter but cant catch the ball nice
cant whine on social media about not getting the ball and then not make that catch
this offence is just boring its just not it week after week they just look lost
nothing but screens and jet sweeps and its working
some of you guys defending roman on here he is ruining our franchise qb thats the reason he needs to get the fuck outta here
how are we not 25 instead
it should be noted that the last two weeks weve played two top 5 defenses
this game makes me wanna drink
why is judon covering a receiver
we have to be the most undisciplined team in football just a flag every 35 plays on us
offensive line bad receivers bad lamar bad greg roman bad
any realistic chance we fire roman this week
why didnt a raven fall down and fake injury
colts dbs are literally laughing at our offense rn smh
let lamar throw deep cant be worse than this
imagine if we had the best kicker in the league like that butker dude
lets get healthy and maul the pats
i swear i think half this sub actually hates the ravens sometimes
i have a really bad feeling that it doesnt matter how anemic our offense looks harbaugh is gonna keep him around for at least another year or two i love harb but hes stubborn af with his coordinators
stop the count

stop the count

stop the count

cant let blue win
i forgot how depressing this sub can be when its tied in the start of the 2nd
go tweet that one hollywood ffs
areare we bad
catch the ball soulja
hollywood showing again he aint a 1
i cant stand rivers watching him get run over there was amazing lmao
one of our biggest weaknesses defensively is misdirection that was exposed in the chiefs game
we literally shit our pants every time there is an end around or a wr screen its almost impressive how bad we are at covering them
roman isnt trusting lamar to go through his reads
this offense is an embarrassment this season
need 35 yards and still wont chuck it down field pathetic
indy is a dirty ass franchise
this is fucking embarrassing undisciplined zero creativity or jump ravens not even looking like an nfl team right now this is becoming a sickening theme
gettin a tad bit worried now boys lmao
this offense today
if we keep this up we could miss the playoffs even with the extra spot
just want to go back 2019 and all the fun we had is that too much to ask


colts fans bitching about the pick and i cant even blame them
so where are all of yall talking all this shit about how the season is doomed in the first half
rudy giuliani needs to stop this game right now
holy shit that playcall lmao
i miss ronnie boys
vegas just changed us underdogs what the fuck happened
do i start dez over darius slayton
i hope to see lamar pissed and going off with his arm and legs
i really hope dez pops off and boykin can learn how to use his size from him
my take rivers cries 5 times
its gametime bitches
lets go defense
lets goooo d
my fav thing to do on sunday is this chat lets gooo guys
rivers thinking about his lunch lol
jesus christ campbell down and rubbing his hamstring
wtf man not like this
i think hes ok
not campbell no
the injuries are starting to get ridiculous
this cant be real
guys he got up on his own and he wasnt down for long i think hell be ok
please be a calf cramp
colts mustve really liked something in film every play is to the outside
bruh lol
wtf was that play call
yikes bozeman got shit on
excellent tackle by the oline there
lmao that play was broken as soon as the ball was snapped
bozeman got shit on lol
holy shit bozeman
wtf was that play call
back at it again with the awful 3rd down playcalling gonna be a long game
its like roman has just given up completely we ran the option pitch the whole 2nd half last week its on tape
get greg roman the fuck outta baltimore man
mcphee with a nice stick
mcphee was such a good pick up
so who we putting at cb once jimmy inevitably gets hurt and dorsey being out can dez play cb hollywood probably has better chance touching the ball as a cb in our offense lol
nice no call on the blatant block from the back on yannick
zero pressure 100 clean pocket no one in the frame
bonds is back tuck that guy sucks
this is definitely a game we are gonna have to win on offense they have a really good line and the secondary is thin
should have got desmond king
jfc that red zone td was awful 31st in the league
refs eat da poopoo
here we go
cmon atleast make it competitive
we cannot pass the ball vertically this year you have to be able to line up and pass the ball at will to be great in this league we are never recreating the best rushing team of all time have to evolve
how is it possible that we have the most cb depth in football besides the patriots and yet are almost completely drained on cbs no marlon tavon marshall averett or bonds we only have peters smith and dorsey left so 2 cbs and a guy pretending to play corner
the worst thing about this is we know roman is more inclined to give up on the run
greg roman panicking probably wont see another rush attempt the whole game
too many injuries man season is long we have time
shitty playcalls here we come
and we cant even snap now this is a joke
the amount of real fans that have stopped tuning into this chat the ones that dont panic the moment were down a score
skura bro what the hell was that snap
good job skura
thanks madden
how was that snap lamars fault
we cant even snap the ball
skura fucked up the snap again
so many bad snaps
see i like when they use hollywood like that hes quick enough to get to the sideline in time
dez is in the field
is matt skura okay whats going out there with his snaps

edit apparently his thumb suffered a cut early in the game and that was the issue on that drive his right hand is now wrapped up
skura is losing his mind that snap sucked too
were gonna have to throw the ball this game man
2nd and 12 yeah lets throw it 5 yards behind the sticks great gameplan roman
did the colts just friendly fire on that tackle
even though that was a stupid face mask hill has looked more physical and better as a blocker today
cant levine play in the slot rather see him then bonds
this is going to be a long day
strap in boys here we go again
hollywood bitches and moans about targets and then pulls that shit
penalize ur souljias
x200b

so where is dez bryant
i think it might actually be impossible to have penalties against our opponents
hey guess who bonds
another throw to the guy bonds is covering
chuck
rivers got his eyes on bonds this gonn be a looooooong game
lmao rivers
woohoo chuck clark to the house for 6
thats a fumble
our defense scores more points than offense good ole ravens football
god damn metcalf couldve started from baltimore and caught chuck
lets goooooool
fumblerooski
defense
jesus christ chuck clark is slow as shit lol thats my boy though
38 does not appear to be an nfl caliber player
we needed that thank goodness
i always trusted this team s
marlos spirit is the 12th man
thats what we needed
thats a blessing a true blessing
fuck yeah defense is the only thing keeping us relevant this year
lets goo
fuck yea just what we needes
defense bailing the abysmal offense out again
did rivers get tackled by the turf
what even happened with rivers did he just fall
lol sometimes you need some sort of random play like that to swing the game
jesus h clark
holy shit chuck clark
lets fn gooooooo
rivers slipping away on his tears
chuck clark looks different
he got chucked
were gonna have to rely on d and tucker arent we flaccofeels
old man rivers saw clark coming and took a seat haha
god damn im happy but still nervous because depending on the defense to score like this feels unsustainable
can this spark our offense to play better too
oh man that image of rivers watching the ravens d score priceless
jesus christ every time i go out back behind the bar to smoke we score a touchdown
felipe rios what is you doing baby
the way rivers just randomly fell lmaoooo
that rivers flop is prime gif material
i dont even care that i started taylor in fantasy im just glad we got a fumble td lol
was that peters that caused the fumble
gotta love harlan ian talking about the fruit punch
frank reich watched the tape of the game vs washington screens are killing us
zero run d
wheres our run d
that replay of rivers on the ground trying to grab clark is hilarious
bonds nooooo
hold the ball bonds
fuck that wouldve been amazing
goddamnit bonds cant you do anything right
not very 007 of you bonds
i knew rivers was to pussy to go for it
the hell going on in kc
damn bonds could have extended his life on this roster lol
screens and sweeps are working because humphrey isnt in you guys shouldnt be surprised add that up w queen being susceptible to misdirections and u got a stew goin

think of him as a de containing on the boundary none of the guys in there are as strong or as physical at the point of attack not even our lbs tbh
not gonna lie i cant wait for the ravens wired this week with philip rivers in it
philip rivers throws like a vagina
shoutout to frank reich for telling rivers to take the delay of game once he saw the colts were 69 on the year on 4th down
what the fuck even is our offensive play calling
25 yards per play oh yea
that was a nicely designed play would have helped of the blocks were better
this offense is so ass
jees what happened to this offense
this doesnt feel like our year our playcalling is an absolute joke im fully on the firing roman train
marshal yanda retired stop trying to make the run up the middle happen
i prefer flacco check downs s
bozeman is getting destroyed today
lamar is frustrated call the game to his fucking strengths
roman gotta go
bozeman just standing around
bozeman with the 110th of a block on the play
again wth is lamar suppose to do there with leonard right in front of him its the garbage playcalling
this offense looks worse than the 2018 offense when all we did was run the ball what is greg roman calling
roman needs to go
i remember last week we really needed a third down conversion against steelers inn the red zone we ran the same play we just did and failed at this point im watching because of defense our offensive drives have no cohesion what so ever so blah
the fact that the offense looks so bad on so may different levels while we have the most exciting player in ravens history is incredibly frustrating
this team isnt going anywhere with this offense
if harbs still backs roman after these series of play calling i
i feel like the refs are constantly gaslighting me and i dont even know what holding is anymore
shoutout madibuike that was hustle
nice stop by madubuike
im looking forward to seeing another drive where we do absolutely nothing
did lamar just throw to a guy who was fucking blocking
this situation has cam cameron written all over it the play calling is stale and predictable so the offense is falling flat on its face harbaugh may have a tough decision in front of him coming up soon this teams sb window is closing and cant wait for roman to figure it out
trash fucking offense right now smh
a fucking screen for a te who is about 3 yards behind the los
we fired our offensive coordinator in week 14 in 2012 and went on to win it all just saying
jackson isnt going through his reads at all
get the fuck off the field marcus
peters is great lmao
tfw greg abandons the run in a tied game
bitch ass 32
what the hell are these window throw calls now greg roman seriously needs to be fired im staying the petition
stay notejected mp
peters baby wtf are you doing out there
cheap shot
marcus peters seems fun as fuck to chill with
that was a lot worse than i thought it was at first
this o line is infuriating
how many yards you wanna lose lamar
lamar jackson is not as fast elusive or explosive as last year
why is this playcalling such ass
love how even the ravens defense players come to stand up for jackson shows you how much the team rides for him
to be fair who knows how jacksons head is right now
had fg shot w tucker but not anymore
one step forward two steps back
so people defending this absolutely pathetic show of offensive play id love to hear your thoughts
fuck it just chuck up a deep ball
3rd and 35 lol
3rd 35 pog
this is embarrassing
can we get another bye week
just punt on 3rd
ray rice time
fire greg roman
zero nfl teams wouldve tried to get the first down on 3rd and 35 right there
biscotti has got to be pissed right

this cant be acceptable to him
what the hell is going on offensive play calls are a joke
does roman need to get fired into the sun this offense is anemic
offense looks horrible right now whether its the oline greg roman the receivers or lamar they gotta straighten this out
trading away hurst and not investing big in ol in the draft has cost us gregs playcalling isnt working as a result and lamar had no chance
ive started opening this thread on my phone and resting my beer on it the amount of cold takes in this thread keeps my beer ice cold
why dont we ever take a deep shot just to keep the defense on their toes a bit
classic judon get him the fuck off the field
wouldnt be third down without judon commiting a penalty
fire roman after this game this is inexcusable im getting tired of this teams excuses from coaches and players
just shooting ourselves in the foot nonstop this year
dumb hit by mcphee
greg roman needs to be fired if they lose this game and they need to immediately start working on rebuilding lamars confidence and evaluating where hes at
every 3rd we get a penalty
pittmans going to be catching all day because bonds is on him obvious
oline help desperately needed
why do our corners give so much cushion
not a single deep pass yet yet were playing off them
the good news is that were probably going to get a lot of practice at playing from behind
we cant win this game without our offense
the ravens can never have too much cornerback depth its really hurting us this year
no matter what defense scored 7 and kept them in check so far our offense either wins or loses the game
we probably kneel the clock out
why take that out
are we leading the nfl in penalties yet
weve been playing so undisciplined lately and its getting old
lets just kneel it out til half i dont think i can watch a lamar 2 min warning turnover right now
why do we keep doing stupid shit
wtf are these play calls jesus christ its like a dying animal just shoot it
wow we are literally giving up
penalties has to equal poor coaching right
one teams playing to win
im actaully scared of jacksons dropbacks now he goes back at least 10 yards
56 yrds lol
this year is a wash
for all the wouldnt have survived the boller days this offense looks as bad as those days
sowe going to fire roman yet
somethings definitely wrong with the psyche of this team like is lamar saying fuck it cuz he knows the plays being called are ass
hail mary pick6 incoming
good thing they have those big receivers
aight this is the game where we break the streak of losing games when trailing at halftime i belee we couldnt possibly do worse that this first half
cant wait for the team to come out and show off the great adjustments they made at halftime lol seriously though the coaching is killng us
i love lamar and i really really hope this is just roman being dumb lamar hasnt looked good but throws well still like he just is in the wrong system
so when are we gonna see changes

we have a lot invested in this year
harbs better have the speech of the century for the guys in the locker room
we havent had any game w good halftime adjustments not expecting much here
we sat up here in the off season and saw that this front office refused to get any help on offensive side in fact the offense got worse with the retirement and then trading of hurst

the front office did nothingexcept draft a raw 3rd round wr

this season offense production was predictable

so now the ravens hope as it should be rest entirely on the defense they are the ones that got all the limited resources
at least lamar has no turnovers proud of my boy
back to the days of defense playing both ways to win games would be more than happy to drop roman this season has shown he aint it
seriously concerned how we never run lamar from under center i think the pa game would work far better and we could run some bootlegmore misdirection
if the oline could give us enough time to throw deep passes thatd be cool
mekari needs to be replaced hes been horrible
asses got chewed out in the locker room at halftime
thats a horrendous stat 20 straight losses when trailing at half how many years does that go back
yo this offense is what i want
20 straight losses when losing at halftime lol wtf this isnt even a lamar problem apparently
well there goes that
youve got to be fucking kidding me
good feeling gone
because of course
and there we go
jesus fuck man how does this keep happening
pack it up fellas were done
nnooooooooo

i just started to feel good about the offense
what the fuck gus eat my ass dude
yo i came in from fishing to watch this and saw the very end of the half 54 total yards maybe i should have stayed eh could get better in the 2nd nope should have fucking stayed out
were still good get a stop and were back like we never left
hollywood wont get tackled but can make one lol
not our year just laughable
dude its a curse something is going on
i think he secured it and went down to the ground and then lost it
thats deflating cant put that one on roman all execution on that one
no way they reversing this
literally cant blame lamar or even roman o line is fucked with a capital f
good play calling on the drive dont sweat yet boys
bad challenge
what a fucking waste
no way that was a catch what the fuck is our coaching staff doing just grasping at straws
i mean why the fuck not
another wasted challenge this week who is talking to him from the booth
possibly the weirdest challenge in the history of professional football but alright who needs 3 timeouts
he took multiple steps and had control and wasnt initially going down on the play this is going to be very interesting it doesnt pass the smell test to me but seems to check all required boxes
wait that looks like ravens ball
someone explain how that isnt a catch please shit was glued to both hands
were running a north south player on a delayed handoff at the goal lineand we wonder why we fumble at the goal line just stupid shit all around

roman seriously has this team in a point where they have no idea what to be
alright who fucking jinxed it
i wanna roll up in the curtain and the carpet and roll the fuck away from this game feeling safe
color me fucking shocked
no way lol
lol everyone saying it was a dumb challenge
the mad lad actually did it
everyone thought the challenge was dumb but harbaugh playing 4d chess
wtf i think thats a bad call
see it was a good challenge peters held onto the football long enough for it to count as an interception
harbaugh you fucking genius
til idk what a catch iswhat year is this
holy fuck they reversed it
ill eat crow im insanely surprised they gave us that
dez definitely caught that lol
lamar has looked really good this half so far
yall were saying lmao
dez caught it
that was an unintentional coincidental perfect finger point at the camera by dez bryant after cbs cut back from the catchnot catch highlight during that cowboyspackers playoff game all those years ago you damn well know i caught that pass
hopefully leonard is ok
thats my soulja boi
anyone feels like these commentators complain every time we have a favorable call literally every time
i want to see a dez completion
good luck to darius leonard that dude is an unbelievable player
hope leonard is okay because i never want injuries but hes been destroying us today itll definitely make our lives a lot easier
bro how is pizza hut gonna do my boy gus like that
my anxiety is too high
wow roman didnt fuck that one up for once
hell of a drive once again though this should be 2110 these turnovers are killing us
hes in
we should get both of those fucking tds
we just made what shouldve been back to back td drives nice halftime adjustments
yeah good luck dropping gus three times in a row
there you go gus you got your revenge right away
that down judge is fucking blind
gus redeemed himself
knee didnt touch
lets go boys offense is oiled up now
once again the ref announces a lineman as eligible for us but i remember back against the chiefs when they scored with a lineman they didnt announce it like that am i wrong on that or do they not have to announce it over the speakers just to the defensive captain or something
the offense is looking so fluid in this 2nd half
i love how hype we are compared to halftime lets keep this thread hype keep the momentum keep the truss
steve to roman on the phone during halftime get your shit together or you can stay put at indy after the game
im happy but how did he escape lol
good job defense now lets increase the lead
havent got to rivers once today is indys line really that good or campbell being out really standing out
now all my fantasy team needs is an andrews td and the defence to get more turnovers then maybe i have a chance lol
i know it didnt amount to much but that proche stiff arm was nice
holy shit boykin made a catch this really is 2020
boykin sighting
nick boyle is clutch today
looks so much better in the 2nd half
heres the offense that i have missed so much
can someone confirm that roman is not calling the plays since the half

this offense looks totally different
oline actually looking better
all of that for 1 yard
this ol looks so much better now
go for it
go for it
go for it
go for it or nah i say go
horrible spot

it wasnt a qb draw

thats a win to me
i hope we get this if we dont that could be a momentum changer
noice
skura is so trash today at snapping
that was huge
somethings up with matt skura other than his cut up hand he has looked off for a few games now
did we rly hold them to 1 yard all quarter lol
anyone else think its weird the nfl started this game at the second half
skura is missing a whole offseason coming off an mclacl tear but still really concerned we need good ol
love we still trust gus after the caugh up
just let lamar be lamarneeds to be the game plan moving forward
jackson looks good for once this season he seems confident again and doesnt seem like hes trying to do too much or make every play we look more dominant than 2019 in this last quarter probably the best football weve played against a good team all year
skura man
damn 12 straight completions
ricard lead blocking dobbins is a thing of beauty i want to see for multiple seasons to come
the ravens are now 6for9 on fourthdown conversions this year bsmolka
1923 lamar is actually doing good imo
this 2nd half has been amazing besides the fumble so far
madden spin op
damn that faked me
theres my qb
beautiful
hes back baby
andrews just murdered some poor sob
now i wanna see stephen a smith talk about how lamar lacks passing skills against good defenses
the offense is back lesssss gooooooo
completely fooled them
now thats mvp lamar
gonna need a gif of lamars dance after the td
this is the right playcalling ugregroman great playcalling all second half
okay that was actually a good play call
if its true fire greg roman and promote urban now
someone else must be making the calls now this isnt romans plays if anything was adjusted at half it was that im more than certain
what a fake
oh whats that the colts overcommitted on a run play because weve actually been running it who wouldve thought
they need to do something about this line skura and bozeman fell straight backwards on that play wtf
rivers looking like hes in his feelings rn
fantastic play calling adjustment by roman at the half absolutely brilliant stuff offense looks more confident
is this our seasons turnaround
ol is literally falling over themselves as lamar escorts himself to the endzone
convinced that someone else is calling plays
download complete
cant commend our guys enough for turning it around on offence and for roman to adjusting hope they can close it out
record consecutive 20 points wooooot
our offense sucks
fire greg roman





oh wait we arent doing that anymore
darius leonard is a beast wish he were wearing purple
mark andrews going to be on gmfb for that block
i have this theory untested that when the baltimore ravens offensive unit calls running plays consistently and does not abandon the run that lamar jackson is able to achieve peak performance
defense needs to hold now cant get soft
props to roman when he does bad we shit on him he has turned it around this half so give credit where its due oline has been a lot better second half as well
oh no not queen please
we cant keep losing people fuck
noooooooo
once lamar gets going and confident the whole team seems to pick up that same energy i just wish it didnt take this long for them to get going
concussion looks like
not queen cmon
i think its a concussion and not a body injury but im not a doctor
took it on the chinhopefully not a concussion
is the madden curse still a thing ravens cant catch break with injuries this year it seems like
hes just shaken up a bit lets chill guys
that super bowl ring hat is awesome
i think i was right wind knocked out him
keep running the clock for us
judon
big time stop
bitch ass colts get the fuck off the field
judon musta shat out that 17 mil of taco bell he ate finally
lets go judon
the colts d isnt the only one that came to play today
a team has philip rivers at quarterback in 2020 and expected to actually be good offensivelydont know who thought that would happen
judon
judon made a play bois
judon finally has an impact this year
fuck you rivers
a couple first downs here and thats the game
omg i held my breath that last play please no more injuries
offense turned it up this half and defense kept their shot together despite calais and marlon out and a bunch of players out of practice for covid fuck yes fuck yes
give dez a carry
being conservative
the ravens are absolutely vibing bro

the announcers
almost got blocked
this game feels like a football movie came out super flat the first half team got a inspirational talk got back out their in the second half and is handling business
man we are absolutely crushing the indy returners this game
steelers v cowboys are rivals since when
merkari is below average at best but when he has a bad game holy fuck its bad
hopefully 44 will be back next week
edc is on the phone with deion sanders right now
pray for the red rifle to come through
tight coverage from bonds
rivers trying to pull a brady
rivers what the gosh darn heck son of a gun
last gasp literally like indy is gonna die
go cowboys
jtuck is magical
man adjustments aside the oline is still an issue too many hits behind the line
tuck is everything
this team played great today despite all the struggles we came from behind and will most likely come away with the win lamar looked damn good other then one pass where it shouldve been picked the pass catchers got open a decent amount and the defense played incredible despite the practice situation and missing so many pieces
shades of truzz there on the sidelines
tuck making the tackle ok big boi
if we fix our line this team wins the superbowl between injuries and the ol im scared af
lol tuck getting his nose a lil dirty
j tuck with the tackle
tuck chill bra we need your leg not your tackles
lol damn tucker can tackle too he had to get his ass
defense for player of the game first half lamar for second half
nice to see an offensive comeback in the second half
wtf was that
we gotta keep them out of the end zone because onside kicks make me nervous af
rivers wasnt moving in front of marino today not a chance in hell
dub
u complain not getting the ball and u cant catch shit
who wouldve thought that losing a generational guard and a top tackle would make the offensive line into a sieve
lmaoo yall are all fake as fuck lol the offensive line is playing like shit lamar has been pretty accurate had the one bad triple coverage decision to hollywood but jesus yall are disappointing
lamar jackson was begging all off season for the front office to go get antonio brown instead the front office and much of the ravens fanbase laughed claiming we do need brown

predictbly we now have one of the worst passing offenses because we have one of the worst weapons on offense

seasons are often won and lost in the off seasonwhen you have the most opportunity to improve your team
wtf was that better play calling please
play calling is going to be our weakness all season long smh
come in soulja
i think we all forget what it feels like to have every game be competitive after last year were all so used to destroying every team in our way this is football though and we have to accept its not 2019 anymore
ugh yeah were done this year prolly 106 and get bounced in the wildcard
defense giving up 10 yards per play is no bueno
love that td but holy crap theyre moving the ball on us like its nothing
i miss campbell
wait so they didnt call timeout but they also didnt call a delay what
tf is this playcalling
yall bitched all week about abandoning the run because roman called a single pass to start the half now and are upset because we run too much
fun fact rivers is 013 or some shit against brady
even if we win this game

we are not super bowl caliber
we have 55 yards of offense and are only down by 3 we should be getting blown out lets see what adjustments theyll make
didnt we upgrade or offense from last year or is a 3rd te really that important
its funny to me that people try to find a way to blame lamar when the play calling is atrocious our ol cant stop a 4 man rush and our wr1 drops passes
this same exact thing happened to the 49ers in 2015 with greg roman he has to go immediately
wait i thought lamar was bad according to this sub
i have remembered how to play football

ravens offense second half 1182020
lol the colts sub is crying about the refslmfao
lots of ravens fans eatingcrow
lamar had a pocket there he ran into the sack showing no poise lately
i hope this is just cramps
down 70 in the 1st means we wont run at all today get ready for an ugly one boys
ugh brown gotta get that one soulja
brown isnt as good as he thinks he is and lamar isnt as good as we need him to be right now
besides the equalizing turnover the ravens defense is looking toothless
we look so goddamn bad on defense thus far

4 starters down and its painfully obvious
to be fair to bonds theres a reason hes on defense
its been a frustrating day year for the ravens and lamar jackson
serious question does anyone else think lamar has been playing hurt this season a couple weeks ago he was on the injury report with a knee injury

feel like theres something just a bit off thats affected his overall game last season his escapabilty cuts were so sharp defenders are locked onto him right now
lmao so much hate for judon and then it wasnt even his fault
lol at yall calling judon stupid and it wasnt even him
fucking elliot played that so bad he almost took out jimmy smith lol
we look lost what happened to the swagger we had we just look so flat
thats the same hit that the steelers didnt get flagged for last game
every game weve played has been getting worse and worse and worse team is on a hard decline and nowhere near sb contenders
do we stink
our offense is complete trash and when things work roman just abandons it like this is insanely bad
ravens defense is carrying so hard watch us win it but our offense doesnt score a point
56 yards of offense 0 on the ground this team was up 20 at half last season every game im sick
20 points streak ends today
why did we get to the redzone and immediately stop passing lamar finally gets some rhythm and we just yank it away its okay to pass a lot if its working its 2020
dezcaughtit
fuck man why are so many big name players getting hurt
figure it out skura
tucker kpw 99 kac 99 balls 100
yeah everyone lets roast the udfa corner for being bad when he really shouldnt even be playing but forget about marlo deciding to splurge his contract money outside every week
way to bobble a crucial third down soulja
this team would be insanely good if we had an nfl offense damn shame
fire roman after this game im begging you these players look like they have checked out because they know hes ass
cant believe how lamar breathed on edwards there smh look at the regression
if it were 2019 rg3 would be going in
dont ask me how i know but dez is gonna catch a 35ish yard catch and run td where he breaks 2 tackles
throw that up
white on purple is so fire
alright boys i placed a whole four dollars on us at 100 lets get it
i am about to throw up
time to go boys
lets do this shit i want a huge game from the passing attack
rivers ya friggin crybaby
do you guys think judon will grt his boneheaded penalty before or after the half
you have to be fucking kidding me
welp
fuck this season so hard right now man
oh sweet jesus
im about to panic
the season that just keeps on giving
fuck injuries it makes games so hard to enjoy
im glad were wearing the purple pants white on black is my least favorite combination and we wear it basically every game on the road
burger 40s the mike
dont want to jinx it but it doesnt look crazy bad or anything
im sick of these guys jumping it works 110 times and almost injured you all of the rest of the times
what the living fuck was that
what in the fuck kind of play was that pathetic
what the hell
roman wtf is this
wtf was that
bozeman got beat like a drum
31 looked injured after the play he was holding his hand
great job utilizing our wrs
let lamar throw it bruh
well dorsey lasted a whole 10 seconds
campbell questionable to return
i wish mcphee got the money judon did hes playing better
reich too smart for wink hes going to throw screens all over the place
block in the back
who the fuck is tyrell bonds
man i hope im wrong but with all the outstanding stuff going on no practice time for a half the defense and injuries i dont know if we can keep up right now still early hope im wrong
we got someone named terrell bonds out there covering receivers
offense better show up today
patrick queen ff lets go
this might be an ass whooping
so they attack the edges all the way down the field then run the decoy and come the other way nice gameplanning

thats the thing that i dont like about roman its not necessarily the plays themselves tho need work its the sequencing and setup of the other team when we are on offense
not a good 2nd drive for the d lets see if they can adjust
playing from behind already man wtf
this may come as a complete shocker for a lot of people in here its just the 1st quarter
and this start shows you cant just look at a teams record and make conclusions i know we have a lot going against us this week but we were bullied that drive and looked half asleep not acceptable
greg roman about to send the offense out to run up the middle on first down for a gain of 2 lamar rpo on second down for a gain of 3 incomplete pass to a doubled mark andrews on 3rd down
we waste a down every single drive
lol this offense is a joke
we literally cant even snap the ball
cursed
great start offense
that snap perfectly describes the offense recently
great awareness by boyle to snatch the ball of the ground
huh who knew throwing to dobbins was a good idea

wait
skuras snaps have been shaky all year it finally bit him
skura is playing like shit rn wtf
what in the fuck is skura doing
i wanna go back to the 19 ravens
fire roman man the madden cpu calls better plays
whats wrong skura
da fuq is with these snaps
wtf is with skura
mekari start warming up
look at that run everyone is crashing down on the los zero respect for our passing
probably thinking about the next hit drops it sick
hit both hands
nice fucking coverage on that kick
rashad melvin sends his regards
looking a lot like those late flacco years
who is our wr coach whoever he is get him the fuck outta here man
get bonds out of here
bonds fucking sucks
man watching redzone mahomes has 15 feet of room in every direction around him on every drop back and receivers that get separation me jelly
thank you god mp juiceman
there we fucking go
omg lol
eat shit irsay
chuck clark td
to everyone saying its a wrap no its not but yes we are playing like shit
i feel for bonds hes going to get picked on all game
bonds is not an nfl player
lmaoooo he leaped over rivers
rivers gameplan find bonds and exploit the hell out of him dont even look at peters or smith
rivers flopping in front of clark as a tackle lol
chuck clark i love you
lmaoooooo rivers wtf was that
chuck clark just posterized that colts player
oh lort
lmfaooo rivers
im so glad the refs let the play run out i wasnt sure it was a fumble at first
marlon is here in spirit
what the hell just happened
lets fucking go
yoooo
lol grabbing whatever he could get
damn ravens d is ruthless
lmao

thanks colts
yeeessss leggo baybeeeeeee
lmfaoooo
dont we need one more 20 point game to break the record
we needed that so bad good shit
who stripped it punched it out
so proud of this defense dammit
does anyone want to argue that lamar doesnt need better wrs again brown asks for more balls then drops the 3rd down pass brown is a great no 2 wr he is not a no 1 wr in any good passing offense

given the way this team is constructed and how much resources is devoted to defense the ravens better score on defense for this team to have an shot in the playoffs
this dell add making me feel nauseous af
2 big plays in a row on jaylon ferguson
sack daddy isnt even a tackle daddy
aight we gotta meme the fuck out rivers
do the colts know how to throw anything else other than screens
bonds had a chance
fucking bonds lmao
fucking bonds i stg
defense stepping up big time
thats a pick if it was humphrey
bonds that shouldve been a td
buffalo beating the brakes off executive chef russ and his merry band of line cooks
how do we not even attempt to throw a deep ball to hollywood even if we were obligated to tell the colts d before doing so we still fucking should
i cant remember the last time we completed any pass down like 15 yards
i have an unnatural amount of hatred for the fact that those wr sweeps are passing tds
more designed runs please
im liking the quick plays at least
why cant we pull off the plays that other teams can
offense looks like doo doo
why is lamars drop back so deep
horrible call
welps time for our d to get us another td
might as well punt on 3rd and short with these play calls
fuck greg roman what are these play calls
player of the game is gonna be sam koch aint it
our offence looks so shit
greg roman why
qb draw how fucking predictable
fuck greg roman
this is pathetic we literally cant throw anything other than screens
our offense has suck but holy fuck today we havent even moved to their territory yet
our o line is sad
only positive ive seen is more misdirection by the offense too bad the line is absolute dog shit and cant execute
pass the fucking ball on a slant literally every team even the jets know to do that

greg roman qb draw
am i the only one who feels like were having lamar do way more inside runs this year

if you want to use that athleticism then go for it but on designed runs you have to scheme him as an elusive rb stretch plays off tackle get him more space to make people miss and make a play instead of sending him down inside the trenches
yal are so weird lol all year you have been complaining that we arent running more screens endarounds fakes etc the line actually has to block in order to be successful at any of these the ol getting mauled right now
so are we finally done with greg roman or is harbaugh too attached to him
our offense is legitimately terrible you cant keep calling qb dives up the middle when its 3 and 4 yards to gain

if you cant scheme something easy a rub a slant a drag an inbreak a curl with a known speedster like hollywood after sending him go a bunch of times then what the fuck are we doing here
there are two options lamar is absolute ass in passing and last year was a complete mirage or gro needs to be fired yesterday im going with 2
i hope we get some new age college coach to replace roman
offensive line play is killing us
how do the fucking browns absolutely dismantle this colts team and we cant even get it past our own 50 holy fuck this is turning into a flacco offense so quickly
so is this our thing now empty backfield on 3rd and 4 we run lamar every time there is an empty backfield this is us now this is the way it is i played baseball for 17 years and i play madden on my xbox if i am able to call that play every single time i see it thats a problem shitty ass play calls are making me look like tony romo from my fuckin couch
real nice tackle there
i had no clue we were on snf next week
promote james urban to oc he seems like he has an idea of a 2020 offense
is there any way to get yanda to start packing pounds on again and come back
defense still looking good as fuck
please offence show something just something
lets go deep
to the eye test the offense has had more and more trouble moving the ball with each week
what in the name of fuck am i watching here
this is like ya know embarrassing
our first round pick needs to be spent on oline next year not even close
fucking come on

lamar isnt showing spunk because greg roman is an idiot
this offense is dogshit
hey that colts linemen just touched an official
lamar is awful at making decisions im sorry but you can not throw that ball there is no excuse
lamar got lucky on that one that was an int
remember last season when lamar throw the ball and you just knew it would be money now i feel sick every time i see it come out of his hands
im not sure theres a single positive thing about this offense lol
yo he aint open lamar
yet another atrocious pass
how is every reciever we throw to literally in triple coverage
oh look peters running his mouth dude you can not fucking get ejected
rivers has such a stupid whiny face
burn the offense down and start over
hahahaha lamar getting mekari i love
lamar
god this thread has some insufferable homers in it
i like mekari there
wow a questionable referee decision goes our way
ah thats a good call actually dipped the head
bro hed be tossed in college
fuck blacmon
get angry show some fucking fire show some energy they you want to win
juiceman ready to go
lamar looks baaaaad its like he cant read defenses at all when he drops back
cowboys take notes on how to defend your qb
this line is not blocking anyone
thats an ejection
dirty af
is it me or does the play calling look horrid
surely he should be kicked
this is the first late hit weve ever had in what 2 years
juiceman dont like yall fucking with our qb whispers but dont get ejected marcus goddamnit
take notes cowboys players thats how you defend your qb
lamar has to win throwing today we cant get anything going on the ground
colt fans booing like dumbass babies
bruh
throw the fucking ball away
needs to get rid of that ball also we literally have 0 protection
we have no line at all
seems like every pass play lamar is so far back from the line ol needs help big time
thats hard to watch
jackson what the hell
wtf pushed is way out of fg range
line is rough today
step up in the fucking pocket lamar
offensive line is just awful
had hollywood wide open if plants fast and takes a hit
this offense looks so bad on so many levels its sad
this is hard to watch
our offensive line is in tatters
lamar stop the hero ball plz
we need stanley
i seriously want to see more of duvernay
yeah we need to draft a line
just take a knee
we make one good play and then follow with 34 bad ones
i sure would love an interception right there
imagine being an nfl lineman and not lining up properly
flustered lamar usually doesnt bode well for his decision making he needs to get back to the fundamentals
its time for roman to yeet
why cant we throw downfield dammit wtf

at least take a chance
lamar basically sacks himself when he starts running the wrong way to avoid a defender
here come the trolls
lets take a deep breath folks its going to be a long season i know its rough but we are the fucking ravens we arent incompetent
no magic pill for this offense can only expect marginal improvements at this point in the year hopefully defense can get and stay healthy to carry the team
jackson is in his own head he needs a sports shrink
i know some of yall dont want to believe but it just gets worse with roman
theres the judon that we know
thanks judon
what a fucking bullshit call
45 penalty yards already
more bullshit calls that was not roughing the passer the fuckkk
no wayyyy judon is straight up trash
i mean it looks bad but he clearly wasnt hesd hunting
im manifesting a turnover on this drive
undisciplined penalties are this teams own worst enemy
man i miss yanda
is yannick a situational player i was under the impression he plays every down even though he isnt the best agaknst the run
how are we so bad at both preventing and getting separation
colts about to go 95 yards on us
jimmy smith giving up 15yds of cushion
i hate that i have to think about the state of indiana for this long
surprised refs didnt throw flag for dpi been fuckin us all season for playing good d
great coverage on that play
commentators talking about fucking luggage right now instead of our pass coverage
doyles beared looks likes its glued on
the talent drop up front has really hurt our offense hopefully the team develops our depth quickly
this half couldve been way worse hope they make adjustments at half time half to credit our defence for hanging in there despite not having humphrey and campbell theyre playing as well as you can really ask for as for the offence theyre playing against a strong group but you have to ask for more than what they put up in the first half you can tell theyre adjusting to life without stanley and yanda and still missing ingram but man this is a tough watch theyre playing scared timid i hate the roman play calling
blankenship kicks with his glasses on
can harbaugh tell the bois its ok to not commit penalties
so many flags whats wrong with this team
check downs are our new thing apparently
6 plays for negative yards
returning kicks from the endzone would be a lot cooler if we didnt commit a penalty every time
oh now you run the ball
look i know this team is undisciplined but the amount of times we get called for holding while the other teams never do is kind of suspect
jk gotta get out of bounds there free colts timeout
this game is nauseating
another botched snap
hahahaha my god
its like were not able to do anything positive its either a negative play or we struggle to do some pedestrian shit that any other team can do with no issue
wtf roman if youre going to run on 2nd down when the opponent has 2 timeouts you also run on 1st down
thank you jk dobbins for running out of bounds on 1st
hard to watch this is kyle boller era bad
can we also stop calling these horrible 5 wide passing plays with a weak o line with crappy route concepts im so tired of lamar dancing for a few seconds then getting dragged down
jesus this is just sad we cant do anything offensively
this offensive line is bottom 5
lamar shouldve gone left there but man guy has no room and noone getting open
wtf wtf wtf wtf
this is almost as bad as last year was good
what is this offense how has it declined this badly
lamar needs to take fucking charge of his team
woah you can throw a route to a wr turning in close to the line of scrimmage like what type of direction is that sort of like a slant or something
oh nice refs got us a flag so helpful
consecutive 20 pt game record is in danger lol
i was saying we were good all throughout these last couple of weeks but this is sad heads need to roll after we lose this and its gotta be roman hes holding us back now
let me tell you why the offensive line playing poorly is obviously lamars fault
just nfc east things
does our defense have more yards than our offense right now
like we cant even get to tuckers range
i want some dez today
woah waht is dis
snead is a glue guy he aint flashy but i cant say i wouldnt want a guy like him always on my offense
slants and seams as far as the eye can see keep digging
did we fire roman at halftime
let lamar cook
why are they showing 2019 highlights
we should hire roman
leonard is a freak
not the same offense but i like this uptempo pressure offense
whatever they did in the locker room they should remember that
i think someone snapped romans neck in the locker room and took over his job where tf was this all day quick passes that dont take 10 minutes to develop slant routes mixing up the play calls

i dont get why roman cant do this all the time
lmao omfg
anyone else notice lamar has a limp when he shows up had it all year think its his groin
jesus fucking christ
shoot me
come on
smfh
thats just damn good defense there
ball security is key
i wanna die
doghouse time
fucking judon and roman
only lamar was on the madden cover not the entire team
i love turning the ball over in the redzone my favorite
peters was so close
thats about what i expected from this team
fuck that would have been amazing if he caught it
wow ok
why would anything nice ever happen
nothing going our way
how is that not pi the receiver held peters arm on the catch
what a horrible challenge
we are fucking cursed shoulda been a pick
how to waste an important timeout when we might need them later 101
now protecting the pall seems to be a issue add that to the laundry list of problems we gotta fix sigh
imagine being greg roman and using duvernay on a god damn running play from 4 yards away this moron needs to go im tired of watching week after week as he outsmarts himself trying to be cute dude cares about nothing more than making his mark and getting a shot at a head coaching job fuck off greg
dont like this challenge dont see any way this gets overturned
the challenge wont even be in question when we return from commercial break
marcus peters is a star
we moving like the cowboys now
i dont think this is going to be reversed
ooph i dont think i like this challenge we may need the to later
it is kinda close
not our year fellas
as infuriating as that was to end it that drive has me genuinely excited this team has a lot of deficiencies on offense but one thing they dont lack speed ive been preaching to mix up tempos speed up slow down use rhythm and pacing to keep the defense off balance and put that speed in position to kill heres hoping a fluke fumble doesnt make us abandon what was working
wow i actually disagree with the refs lmfao
holy fucking shit lmao
lmao the challenge worked wtf
hey something went our way
told you fucking sour pusses
apparently i know nothing about football
harbs you sexy smart mf
who thinks its a stupid challenge now
what the fuck is happening right now
i called it checked the boxes
lmao id be happy if i didnt expect greg to turn around and botch this drive up too
juiceman
fuck yessssss
man i love mp juiceman
not going to lie if it was flipped id be losing shit rn but ill take it
i didnt see that coming
pulled an uno reverse card on turnovers i see
colts just got robbed lol ill take it
all of yall shouting bad challenge can take it back now
give the man who decided to challenge this a raise
people who posted dumb challenge deleting their comments and acting like they knew it all along lol
look at that he had time and threads the needle in between 3 defenders
let the man throw fuck yall
harbaugh 200 iq
marcus peters caught it
soulja boy
im confident that shouldnt have been a catch but i wont complain mp juice man does it again
i think hollywood is actually 90 lbs
thats my soulja
let lamar play his game and well succeed
lmfao everyone calling for harbs to get fired but he big brains the mfing system
fucking hell this second half is getting me hyped
ill sit on the coach then lmao harbs a sb winning coach for a reason
damn hope darius leonard is good
momentum
alright lets make something happen
oh look we throw the ball and we actually get in the red zone jeez who figured did someone tell roman
we are actually getting yards holy shit
cmon just punch it in
wow no qb draw
honk honk
ricard just destroyed that mf
something we have done consistently is get the ball right back to someone that has fumbled and i really appreciate that as a coaching mentality
nobody denies gus edwards for three straight downs nobody
now lets step up the d
thats my boy gus
bullshit thats a td
nearly the same play again lol
future 2 bright w gus n jk as our backs
i cant watch this game cause of local market restrictions but that peters interception my god we got lucky
damn wanted dobbins to get one there

gus bus chugging along though which is still great
alright defense lets get another stop
run it down their throats
cant stop the bus
gus bus
fuck yeesssss
lamar slinging it
i like this new offense
great change of pace we have some actual hot routes and check down options and are hitting the middle of the field well also running misdirection before the snap very effectively
that was a great drive but still plenty of time to screw ourselves
look at these quick reads mixed with runs and deep passes wow roman can call a balanced game he just chooses not to
dont you want to call a play that gains more than half a yard nah we have 4 downs for 2 yards run it again
there we go lamar looking happier
is roman not calling plays someone else with a playsheet on sideline looked to be calling shit roman always is in the booth
interesting the second we start actually doing passes downfield we start moving the ball
who tf was right next to rivers and let him go
lmao rivers looking slippery asf
if the defense threw down a receiver theres be a flag
the amount of time that ball was in the air felt like it was a guaranteed pick if we still had ed
we have a sb defense too stacked
watching him trundle along the field really made me wonder how he got away from that
momentum swing
nick boyle upgraded to wr1
im just so frustrated that the second they call pass plays getting vertical everything clicks do that all the time
crazy what happens when lamar has a few seconds to throw glad the oline got their heads right
nice to see lamar looking sharp need this all the time
i have calmed down a bit
its like we were playing at half speed on offense in the first half and hit the accelerator
i missed what happened after the td three and out
have we gotten it together
i knew carolina wasnt going to hold their lead but man i was hoping theyd beat them
we drank the secret stuff during half cause weve definitely picked it up offensively
colts getting decimated on defense by injury
sneed wide open wtf
go for it
go for it rn
go for it
snead was open the whole time tou even looked at him lamar
fuck yea 1st down bitches
lbs stayed home on lamar on that 4th
lamar needs to pick what the defense gives him there were two open players for just a couple of yards but enough for the 1st down
should we try out dez or nah
fuck yea dobbins
jk is good man
great lamar getting that 1st down
damn what happened in the locker room its like a different offense
bruh what if we took a shot down field to bryant on first down
1 yard lmaooo
lol that rivers face is a meme waiting to happen
yo rivers is hof of facial expressions lol
169 nice
dobbins holding on so tight to that ball
is this the same ravens team as the first half
literally night and day between the first half and the second half
i love dobbins
this is a very different ravens team offensively we are back to doing what we do best control the clock
willie snead is so good recently im so sorry for slandering him earlier
haters happy as lamar is finally playing wr today
bruh dobbins and queen holy fuck edc knew he was doing in the draft
offense looking a million times better right now
we back baby were fuckin back
i do that shit in madden all the time lmao
lmao lamar
beautiful
powers needs to start seeing some time bozeman gets his ass whooped a lot lol
this second half has been lamazing
bozeman getting punked by mlb is not ideal
oooooooooh babey
where was this in the first half glad they turned it around but the ups and downs are scary
lets go baby
love you lamar
my man lamar what a stud
nice play nice play
im not being this guy but the entire iol ended up in the ground on that play designed
every play i just see the corpse of matt skura ragdolling into the backfield not cool
and we got the points record
i think lamar is over that groin injury now his speed looks next level this game
id be pissed as a colts fan but weve had plenty of shit calls this year so whatever
fuck yeah this offense is rolling this half running it all over throwing intermediate lamar doing it on the ground
20 points record broken
lamar jackson has put his foot down in the second half
if you left the game day thread in the first half we dont need that energy truzzzzzz
lamar thanos purple jacksonnnnn
angory bird team is back
ngl i labeled this a loss at half i love when this team proves me wrong
we give roman a lot of shit but that a masterful play call everyone on that defense got absolutely fooled
bad call but whatever
did he call lamar mr odom
nice one secondary s
getting tired of the arm tackles
nooooooooo queen
peters tries to get the strip so much he gives up rac a lot
no no no no no
def concussed
not like this not like this
i think he bit his tongue he kept sticking it out while he was on the ground
did covid lockdownlack of practice hurt these players ability to tackle i was too distracted by the election to tune in on ravens preparation
rivers jersey is way too clean
this game has a similar feel to that seahawks game last year where it was tight early on the road but then we came out strong in the second half and eventually wore them down
i think he shit himself a bit just a theory
starting to think this is turning into a lets level up all our depth for next year kinda year
queen is back in thank god
wait are we allowed to make second half adjustments
good fucking stop
dumb dumb call by indy
let allen cook
well timed blitz right there to stop indy on 4th down wink drew that up perfectly
fuck off the field rivers
we must have switched offensive coordinators at the half
thats the noodlearm rivers i know and love
colts thread in shambles lmao cant believe they didnt try to make it a one score game
despite the lack of calais marlon and fort the defense has played well
rivers maaaaaaad
cant fucking wait to get our man back next week 44
ok judon
wtf judon can help
whats up with the red white and blue line what is that for and why does it only show up in some games
for those of you youngins that became fans because of lamar watching the colts offense is what the flacco era was like
great second half man with the amount of starters out we should be happy with how we played against this colts team
what other streaks do we have left to keep today got the turnover one got the 20 pt one just got 100 yards rushing
flex on a tackle when you know its gonna be a run and youre down by 11
mekaris really struggled today
harrison did his best impression of ralph wiggum torpedoing through a window
i thought dorsey was already out with an injury
lucas oil turf sucks
lol they couldve kicked a field goal but went for it
great job d
rivers is just so so whiny
i just expect a flag every time we force an incompletion tbh
kill the clock
3 x 4 is 12 first down every time keep running it
tuck man does it again
best win of the year love how this team came out after all that noise colts is a top 2 d
what a bounce back man hell yes
tucker was like not on my watch lol
jmoney
tucker tackles better than half our defence does lmao
2nd half shutout lets go send a message
do you all not try to get a tackle with tucker on every kickoff on madden usually just end up taking a block but i have gotten some tackles one being a low hit forced fumble
big time win today boys
what are these weirdos doing
gg indy
scoring wont help gamblers one way or the other so whats the point in this last play
thank god they aint score a td that wouldve been bs tbh lol
they kicking a fg
dont forget that we already wasted our bye week
total overreaction by this fan base were playing two top 5 defenses back to back
has a league mvp ever regressed this bad in 1 season to the next i know our line sucks right now but he just looks lost cant even run right anymore
colts fans in here youre losing while were missing 34 of our best players
harbaugh needs to pull the plug on gro we need to run seattle or arizonas offense
lamar has been really poor arguably worse than the playcalling he is lucky he doesnt have an interception
in before someone blames roman for the fumble
why not pitch it there
that was impressively pathetic
our special teams and defense coaches are trying to win a sb roman is not it seems like
i will say it every single week if we cannot consistently throw the ball down the field this offensive experiment is done
get bonds off the field man
nothing new this is who this team is this year
come on brown you wanted the ball
cmon hollywood
hollywood dropping a perfect pass
started dez in fantasy this week because fuck it my other option was crowder and im projected to win by 60 anyway lmao
every week it gets harder to have faith in this team
barry bonds would of had that
this team is gunna make me start drinking again been sober for 10 years
imagine having the leagues mvp on your team and then playing like this the next year
rodrigo gotta be the coolest lookin kicker in the league
wow we are really seeing the effect of not having an oline leader like yanda
ill tell the offense to run the ball can i be the new oc
is this year lamars 2015
i keep seeing qbs have bad days great qbs never have bad 5 game stretches and never bad seasons
offense finally starts to get their shit together and gus just gives it away come on man i like gus but we cant let that slide bench his ass rest of this game
everyone apologize lol
dumb challenge huh
i think the most frustrating part of this season is how bad weve looked with good enough personnel we arent world beaters but were better than we were last year talentwise we should be able to play like this every week
greg roman is the booth during the game right

because there was someone who looked like james urban on the sideline with a playsheet the coach on the sideline was holding the sheet up block his mouth and talking into a headset

i honestly think james urban is calling plays now
rivers cannot throw downfield anymore
damn that was some vintage lamar right there pretty
that block from andrews though half a td right there love to see
romanjackson 2024
you couldnt pay me to watch those late night shows so painfully unfunny even their laugh tracks need a 3 drink minimum let alone the live audiences
chuck clark deshon elliott ferguson queen and peters played so well

honestly entire d but judon woooo
someone other than roman please call 3rd down plays ffs
how the fuck does roman have harbaugh bring up dez yet have not a single fuckin plan on how to use him in the passing game absolute clown shit fucking use dez already
jk you friccin moron
the ravens are borderline jets level right now
that aint it roman didnt work the first time didnt work the second
lets make one thing clear we are not superbowl contenders not even close
the hit on snead wasnt flagged this is legal right nfl
its like a kick in the balls man i took lamar super early in fantasy this year absolutely gross
yall really dickriding hollywood rn yall was just waiting for him to mess up hating ass weirdos
time for my favorite raven terrell owens barry bonds to step up to the plate and hopefully deliver today
early game tweak wrap him up hell be okay
o line is trash now
hollywood i dont want to see shit about not getting looks what a terrible drop
and thats why we dont throw to hollywood
this offense is dogshit
need a turnover or something to get us pumped up this just feels like its going the wrong way
wow were bad
okay now everyone except lamar and the tes need to get it together

edit or we just kick it old school and defense scores all the points
all we need is for dobbins to be possessed by the spirit of buck allen and we will be sitting pretty
i do believe that might be some momentum boys
popeyes spicy chicken sandwich chick fil a

its not even close
if the offense was half as good as last year can yall imagine how dangerous this team would be smh
i mean not sure what the ravens can really do they cant set the edge without campell hard to blitz because we only have really 3 healthy corners pass rush cant really do much because of the amount of running they are doing
chris board laying the boards today
this thread lol just because the play didnt work doesnt mean the play call was bad
lamar is not getting an extension this offseason barring a complete 180 turnaround soon
3rd 35 lmao thanks lamar
lamar needs to learn how to step up in the pocket
this offense is just hideous
roman needs to get fired this fucking week the offense looks pathetic today
we legit havent looked good since we got shellshocked by the chiefs i dont know if its a mental block or a coaching problem but its not looking good for us
number of times lamar has been sacked thru 8 games this year 20

number of times sacked all of last year 23
hate to say it but that was a good call
why do we give a 7 yard cushion every fucking play
fucked that boy up
were ass right now and it sucks
why does lamar never throw the ball away
i know lamar hasnt looked great today but for fucks sake give the man a pocket
we need to kubiak gro monday morning edit cam cameron my bad
so how are we going to blame this fumble on on greg
roman spread butter all over gus uniform at halftime fucking pos
why are the colts allowed to slow this pace down over and over without a timeout being taken
and the colts are looking around wondering what happened

lamar muther fucking jackson happened bitch
judon did something
oline blocking has been to me the most frustrating this year
i honestly still cant believe the colts opted for rivers for brissett i dont understand that move
lamar cant come from behind
this is the turning point in our season
its like you guys arent even fans how u gon shit on ur own players
that shouldve been a penalty hes a defenseless player
jesus christ down vote me for this all you want but this entire coaching staff needs reevaluation
after that overturn i never wanna hear rravens bitch about how the refs are conspiring to destroy us again lol
this team is pathetic
elliot if you looked for the ball u can catch it instead you do some bitch shit
i love that their kicker wears glasses
i love watching college football because i can watch qbs who throw more than 100 yards in a half seriously wtf is up with lamar this year hes been awful im gonna drink
that was incomplete as fuck lmao but hell yeah
yall relax gd its 7 points in the 1st quarter wtf is wrong with u guys
how are we feelin ladies and gents gotta bounce back right right
maaaan i hate white jerseys lol unless theyre over black pants like the 2012 sb
hoping jk gets more snaps this week he looked great against pitt
no live comments fuck uspez you need to get this app right
that tucker commercial tho lmao
lets go ravens
lego pt 8
justice hill first td of his career today im calling it
i love when we defer
burger
ah fuck
wow
that little strip of light must be so annoying to qbs lol
fuck
jesus christ
are you fucking kidding me
campbell nooooooo
oh fuck me man
im hoping and thinking cramp massaging calf and they looked to push on the top of his foot when he got up the face he made looked similar to a cramp face
hes walking at least
please be ok please be ok please be ok please be ok
jc i hope hes ok we cant afford to lose him too
were turning into the eagles
where were u when calais ded
the good news is at least calais and marlon havent been out best defensive players

wait whats that ruh roh
our tes love to hurdle
sweet flying knee
can our tes not hurdle
fucking awful offense again surprise
wat in the fuck was that
that was absolute shit
anyone know where i could get harbs mask
did dorsey hurt his arm there it cut to commercial too quickly
we definitely need better oline to compete
rivers is so trash but the team around him is stacked
looks like we havent shown up
random bum 38 still getting killed
rivers literally saying 38 on the line of scrimmage then they ran it at him
gonna be a 50 pa game isnt it
marlon needs to be back yesterday holy shit
yikes
look like trash right now sheesh
more dpi penalties jfc
ugh fuck
cant ask for everything but really wish we could have gotten desmond king
aside from last year i always feel like we have the absolute worst offensive play calling in the nfl its not even something you need to see during the play you feel it when you see our formations it doesnt feel like nfl caliber at all
these injuries man its getting scary
well lets see what the o can do
okay everyone we were down 70 last game too and ran it for quite a while lets just chill
down by 7 now time to pass too much and lose this game
im literally praying every time this offense is on the field
if i dont see some fucking development in the passing game this week im going to be despondent
just tuned in what did i miss
that was certainly something
offense is going to have to carry today i still believe it can happen
skura get your shit together
jesus christ skura
skura needs to get them snaps up man
the chiefs game was the peak of the rollercoaster one where the climb doesnt look that steep but the decline is dug into the ground so you drop much further than expected
nice play throw
fucking hell skura
skura wtf are you doing
the fuck is with these snaps
what a play by lamar
looked like flacco to rice
thank god for the first down but skura needs to learn how to snap the ball
snaps were shitty last week too
ha that defender popped his own guy
indy likes leading with their helmets
cmon hollywood
cmon guys weve got this
damn he gotta catch that
this is so painful i dont know if im even finishing this boys
last years offense ran like a welltuned formula 1 car this year it feels like we put 87 in the tank
i wanna see a yannick sack lets get it done
how you gonna have souljas and they never make tough catchesnever
hollywood could have just pulled the ball to his chest smh
bonds about to have 200 yards on him alone
gonna just keep throwing to whoever bonds is covering lmao
when terrell bonds blows a coverage
right at bonds
there we go
lets fucking go
letsss goooo
clark lets go
please get tramon
yes clark
making rivers look like hes only 34 with 5 kids
yessss the fumble recovery for the td lets go defense
ok can someone make that gif of rivers falling
oh fuck yea
chuck that makes up for the pi
rivers falling down was beautiful
that was a clean strip this is good
fucking huuuuuuuge lets fucking go
fucking please
fumble indianapolis ravens recover

touchdown
man what a return
fuck yes
thank the lawd
thank fuckkk
no marlo no problem
they gangbanged that ball carrier
also chuck clark holy shit
that out thats a td
chiseled adonis better have a neat sound effect for that strip for this weeks episode
i dont care if defense scores all day long
who stripped it
fuck yeahhhh
yessssssss
defense saves the day again
love to see it
now can we just capitalize on this and shift the momentum please
haha rivers defeat as he realized he was getting hurdled is definitely one for the photobook
fuck the mp haters yes my stream is mad behind
i was just thinking we would need the defense to score
malik headhunting out here
im hoping chuck just lit a fire under everyones asses
cant give up 10 yards every play
that wasnt holding
wow jaylon im surprised by that hes been playing better
did malik force the fumble
getting hammered on these zone runs and end arounds
this is a terrible start but damn its still 77
ed reed in shambles rn
omggg almost picked
holy shit bonds you gotta catch that
just got here i heard campbell is hurt does it appear to be bad

and has dez been on the field yet
we gotta lucky there guy was wide open for a first down

we need a drive here and we literally have 0 yards on the ground
not gonna throw again
somewhere the surrender index twitter guy shakes his fist in disgust at this display of cowardice
wheres the gus bus
why do our receivers struggle with separation so much
alright we tried to throw down the field idk if no one was open or lamar didnt want to
thought edwards was hurt but he just fixed his shoe lol
man i forgot we dont have hump today sad but still glad to see the defense keeping us in it even with out him and campbell

we have to accept that this is a season where we will have to rely on the defense while our offense struggles with its identity crisis i have faith it will work itself out eventually but it feels worse just because how electric last year was have faith flock
are we purposefully injuring our own players what the fuck is our luck this year
why we cant ever make this work man
thats why skura has been fucking up
looked slow af
ugh that screen should have been so much better
at least we are seeing more screens now
hey that was a screen that wasnt completely blown up
trash ass offense
so predictable every play
im actually digging the dump offs it makes it easier for him to rip off big scramble runs when it isnt always expected
can we just get dez on the field cant be worse then this
bozeman completely lost on that play
this offence is nearly as decrepit as it was during the flacco era
trash absolute trash
thats a great play by leonard jeez man
bozeman what are you doing
bozeman is getting punked
we need to sit bozeman he isnt blocking anyone and then lamar would have more room to run
greg roman has to be fired or were wasting this season
bozeman is playing like absolute garbage
another 3rd down

another idiotic qb draw play
wtf r these plays
not a good punt
fire roman man our offense is actually so bad the play calling is so stale
someone wake up bozeman hes getting shit on every play
our o is t moving at all dammit
roman why are you calling these dumbass qb keeper plays
this is tough to watch
you cant call plays like we still have yanda and stanley on the line man
that isnt a terrible play call if bozeman picks up leonard but he didnt so it was terrible
can we at least attempt a pass that isnt five yards or less
how are they practicing against our dline and think these plays would work like do they work at the practice
greg roman isnt getting fired anytime soon lets just hope we grind out a few defence led wins inlamarwetrust
roman going for that pittsburgh model to win a game dont play offense until the opposing qb gives you amazing field position
this offense has zero flow quick screens working qb draw on 3rd 10 rushing for 10 yards every play deep bomb on 3rd 1 jfc
who the fuck is bonds
had bozeman made the block that wouldve been either a first or 4th inches bozeman is to blame there
please give ben powers a chance he cant be worse than what we have going right now
if we plan on running on 3rd and shmedium why dont we give it to a back
lets call the same plays we have been calling with no success for the last 7 games theyll never see it coming
said this last week and ill say it again get rid of greg roman
is that rivers still tryna target bonds
do we have a sack
moooom dad is jerking it to sports cars again
yeah thats the smart pass between three defenders
double andrews do everything else straight up ravens offense done
thats like the 4th screen shows you that coaching has zero confidence in lamar right now
wtf is going on with this offense its beyond frustrating
was that a screen lmao that was so bad
run the ball its 77 in the second quarter
the playcalling the execution holy shit
roman loves the empty formation despite the fact that it never seems to work
love when lamar throws fucking dots
there was some actual venom on that pass happily surprised
finally a nice fucking play
that was beautiful
third times the charm jackson and andrews finally connect for the 1st down
laser lets go
the offense looking like some shit they need to get it together before the half
a normal fucking pass play gets the first fuck romans shitty calling
philip crybaby rivers
can lamar make any other throw than 10 yards over the middle
was that a throw for more than 10 yards omg its a miracle
lamar is getting picked if he keeps this shit up windows too tight
why are we running one read throws
jesus lamar should play the lottery 2 dropped picks
throwing into quadruple coverage
garbage throws garbage run garbage offense
good god terrible throw
what the fuck does he see on these passes
i love juiceman lol
chill out marcus
mp wtf
i really hate to say it i do lamar is this offenses problems this season
here comes the penalties
and just as i congratulate lamar on making a good pass this almost interception happens
why tf is peters out there
why tf are all these passes targeted at the offensive line
looked like brown stopped for a step did that make lamar throw behind where he should have for a little bit
wow did we actually get a penalty in our favor
thank god man peters plz dont do that again
eject stallworth
love the fire out of mekari
our opponents have had a ridiculously high number of dropped ints this year probably because theyre being caught off guard by the ball being thrown right at them
peters what the hell are you doing
defenses always look like their one step ahead of this gro offense
this year just aint it chief
32 is the new kiko alonso
cant wait to see rnfl complain about us getting a late hitunnecessary roughness again
shouldnt that be the penalty that gets autoejection or am i thinking of another one
lololol suck my balls indy
our interior oline is getting eaten alive can we hit the outsides on just some simple stretches
yeah he should be ejected
in a season in which i drafted kenny galloday chris godwin aj brown christian mccaffrey laveon bell dallas goedart and julian edelman its looking like i may finally win my first game
fuck blackmon
what a terrible fucking sack to take
lol all i can do is laugh
bruh
o line needs to step up man we cant run or pass with them playing like this
jfc just throw it away
wtf is wrong with lamar this year wow
seriously rb is getting hit 3 yards behind the line up the middle that is absurd
this field is trash
hero mode activated
reallyreallywhat the hell was that lol
just throw the damn ball away
lamar needs to stop running back i dont know why he thinks thats ok
thought he could outrun him cant blame him
are you kidding me lamar
how does jackson get caught there
lamar could save a lot of yards per game by just throwing the fucking ball away
does he not realize that continuing to go backwards only makes it more difficult for the offensive line
who even needs a field goal lol
lmao another illegal formation
pathetic
of course they wont miss an oline hold on us
how many fucking illegal formations can we get this year
3rd and 25 call a qb sneak
3rd 35
how many illegal formations do we get a game
holy fuck our oline is dogshit
lmao
this line is so bad gonna be a rough second half of the year
we need to shore up oline in the draft
god damn it
weve had more 3rd and 20 this year than the last couple combined
this offense is fucking dog shit
yikes i thought that punt was blocked at first
were probably stuck with roman until the end of the season fellas
cant draw up any plays 10 yards down the field cant get any yards rushing idk what we keep expecting from this offense
trolls incoming
this is no bueno
you know things are bad when the official ravens twitter is celebrating fucking first downs
nice to see the 4 man rush that is what we went out to get yannick for
dont need to be 68 to stuff a pass lets go
can we just have one game without one illegal formation penalty please
oline lets 2 free rushers go through and lamar has to try to run out of the pocket and somehow its all on him ok
did anyone think our luck would settle a little bit after the marlon news i was like ok now our luck cant get any worse right
this defense is too good for our offense to play like this
maybe the oline injuries are doing it but it really just looks like the defense knows what the hell plays were running
im gonna stuff my face with pizza
ive never seen a defensive player catch a ball in the end zone and not have to move to score
show the judon catch attempt

jesus how is replay so bad
dude im so over judon
judon again no surprise there
is judon serious
judon is killing us
of course its a foul nothing good can happen for us
what the fuck is this team
why are we paying judon 16 million to do nothing
low football iq nothing else to say really
judson is a bonehead
dammit judon
that might have been a fumble
pernell with the daily doublerip alex trebek
why cant lamar phase through the incoming pass rushers everyone knows mvp means most invisible player he could easily teleport past these rushers i think rg3 would be able to trade him for nightcrawler smh trash
can we fire judon as well
that was a soft call
edit was mcphee sry judon
cut judon he fucks them over and over
im pretty much over this version of this team
he was getting hit what the fu k
yeah that was probably the right call
im so fucking dumb with these stupid rtps
why cant hollywood make that type of catch and play
is that whats supposed to happen whenever hollywood comes back after a catch
somebody really needs to call holding there
wow a team on the field is throwing the ball
2nd big play with judon in coverage lol wth
so this is what moving the ball looks like
we were physical and stuffing each receiver that play thats what we need
nice play by ferguson saved a td
chuck da mvp
that should have been a penalty
pls football gods save our offense
fucking hold
we on track for our 3rd straight 10 penalty game
kneel the ball till half
heres the thing while the team hasnt looked great the score is still 107 colts the ravens are still in this
just kneel it omg
kneel it dont even try
cringe ass screens
going out of bounds and not throwing safe is dumb watch this offense give it back to indy in 30s lmao
ravens football has been frustrating to watch these past weeks
lamar looks awful
andrews just beat his man oline is shit
we look like a bunch of little bitches out there right now wheres the attitude the fight
we need to figure out this ol for reals
practically just gave em 3 terrible play calling
we wont see dez play since we cant even drive it past the 50
yall wanna be we so garbage that philips scores again
if they score here im turning this game off
make adjustments play good d game still within reach
what an absolute pile of hot garbage
i almost cant even watch the offense
quick slant for 10 why dont we do that
yeah if they score im crying
good news its all up from here lol
who knew ingram was so important
what in the actual fuck is this playcalling though
this game has been so frustrating our offense just looks horrific were lucky were only down by 3
we look bad oof
the line is trash and the playcalling is worse
we need some bunch formations or something to help out receivers get open
the o line is a huge weakness for us this year yanda retiring hurt us but i was hopeful that the line would hold strong but with stanley out its obvious they are struggling it also doesnt help that greg roman wants the ravens to be the chiefs so badly but its just not working and lamar is regressing because of it also why would you sign dez and not do anything with him at least make it look like you want him to be a part of the game
i cant believe the offense gets worse every week without being good in the 1st place
here we go
hollywood brown on a slant
they pa confusion lol
things are happening
omfg a first down on first down did i teleport back to 2019
i dont see what other people have seen this season on why there is so much hope for this offense to turn it around its really bad
more of this wtf
lol they really have eyelevel plexiglass between the announcers

its like a nonsmoking section at a restaurant all for show
look you let him throw beyond the los and good shit happens
finally were doing something love these quick passes that gain 710 yards
oh hey willie snead is still on the team
lamar
our offense has a pulse
am i watching a different game
yes do these things
nice fucking play im liking what im seeing right now
were playing well
2nd and 1 isnt that when you should try a pass down field
we got more yards this drive than the whole 1st half wtf
see this is the offense that works quick passing keeping the defense guessing and constantly moving
2019 lamar type beat
thats my qb baby
20 straight losses when trailing at half coaching right
more yards in these 3 minutes than in the whole 1st half
this is the best drive of the game
wait whos calling plays
you have to be shitting me
and theres me eating crow
kms
fuck my fucking life
of course
ffs
lol
fuck
sigh
i was not aware of the losing while trailing at half stat
wtf

thats about right
not that less of that
sadness
jesus lol come on gusss
why
go fuck yourself
lol of course that drive ended with a turnover
lol
pain
thats just unlucky
did roman get the news hes being fired

theres nothing we can do its like were fucking destined to be shit this year
turning this shit off
so much momentum pissed away
this fucking team

they score off this turnover idk bout the rest of the game

fucking jesus christ guys come on

screams into the abyss
not a good ending but need this change to continue
fuck so close
this fucking team
what in the absolute fucking shit
wtf he had it
this game is like a long series of cockblocks for us
so close mp 3
this team just hasnt got what it takes mixture of bad play and bad luck the most promising the teams looked and then that
pain luckily our defense knows how to run a game plan unlike mr eat more mcdoubles
was that a pick and a fumble worth a challenge at least
i am about to die
this aint gonna work
fuck me in the ass
bad challenge
awful challenge
i think it holds he took a couple steps
this seems like abad challenge
what the fuckwaste of a challenge
thats not a catch harbs
dont like that one
fuck yeah lets randomly waste a challenge in a 1 score game in the 2nd half
terrible challenge wtf
harbaugh is so fucking stubborn
i cant even with this game man

that is a bailout call i think
please get some fucking points offense
everyone in here omg harbaugh is stupid other teams arent dumb but he playing 4d chess

note i also said it was dumb but lets move past that lol
dez prolly like then how tf was my catch against gb not a catch
charles they just said he wasnt going down til after the 3rd step
marquise still just looks like a child out there to me
uhhhhh we take those

eye test says that was not a catch in my opinion
that was a gift being called a catch
okok yayyy wooho fucking score
look at that strike by lamar stop limiting him in the passing game
thats my soulja
lmaoooo how tf did we get that
lol at the people in the thread who said that was an awful challenge
put dez on the field you fucking cowards
well ill be dammed john
marcus peters for wr1
lol were just playing for a fg now
hollywood clutch today
rgiiis hair looking kinda funny
can we start charging time outs for these flops
boyle having an ok game
feed the boyle
boyle getting touches today
i give jackson credit for looking a lot better so far
what weird voodoo ritual shit do we have to do to go back to last year
id say i hope roman keeps an eye on this offensive pacing because it has been highly effective but you know how he gets when things are working
mekari didnt block anyone there
alright what did you guys do to greg roman
lets go
beep beep motherfucking redemption
touchdown bitches
thats my fuckin mvp
no way that wasnt in
he was in previous play
touchdown gus in the lead now we just gotta keep it up
lets gooooo
this is some big boy no lil boy time
touchdown
that non challenge as good as the mp challenge
justin tucker is a mule
has a choice to start the bus or jk should have chose the bus
i know we got the td but lamar had nothing but green if he keeps that ball and rolls out to the right
i am now enjoying this again
defense is looking rested and energized
good job defense
holy shit rivers is bad
how did felipe get away from that lmao
idk if bowser blew his coverage at first or not but he just saved us that play he made up so much ground
im ready for a bomb of a td pass
this cant be roman calling the plays haha
lamar has got his mojo back
llama so fast when turns on the jets
lamar juked himself
damn llama got 5 yards outta that
go for it
i wanna go for it but im just glad the offense has a pulse
damn that was an excellent job by their dts to close
were gonna go for it
pretty sure lamar had the crosser route that wouldve had the first down
go for it
fucking go for it pound them up the middle
if we go for it we got it
go for it
had the easy first down to andrew
hell yea coach lets go for it
this is way too close to their endzone to not go for it it is statistically a bad play to not go for this
im just waiting for a slant
jk
got it baby
gutsy call
thats my fucking slime
good lets get the pace going again after the break
whats with these snaps
lets gooooooooooo jk
willie snead was wide tf open and lamar decides to take off i dont get him sometimes man
we need to put mekuri at center skura is going to cost us a possession
announcer was right energy is completely different
we look so good
move the chains
these snaps though
the snaps today have been awful
yes keep it running
needivsnead
if skuras thumb isnt healing by next week do we have anyone else we trust at centre
its the inconsistencies that have bothered me when hes on his game lamar looks unstoppable as whats been shown this half frustrating knowing what hes capable of while watching him not do that all year
fade to dez
i love how edwards is such a chill and quiet dude
bozeman just got blown tf up
great blocking on that run
even though that wasnt a first that spin was clean af
love this second half offense run run run set up the play action and it will lead to passes
bozeman got pancaked on that play jesus
colts defender bozeman
leonards is a monster
lfg
whats with these loud ass whistles
how do we look like this in the second half and complete shit in the first
get in bitch
vintage jackson
our 2 o linemen got knocked down also where has this o been all year
woooooooooooo
lamarkable
like a fast peyton manning
night and day
play calling on this drive was amazing
there we go baybeeeee just need him to get comfy throwing shots downfield now
that was legit a beautiful play design and call
lets goddamn go baby fucking two of our best defensive players gone oline shambles we fight lezgooo
what a play call
hell ya coach lets go for it
i love you and i love everything
pretty sure this was on in the locker room at half
glad they showed a replay focusing on andrews now i see what you all were talking about
this second half adjustment is just what we needed weve looked so much better
this feels like the seahawks game in 2019 on the road against a good team defence scores to keep us in it lamar wills us to victory
need that first tackle sir
wrap up that tackle queen
needs me a sack
mad dog was so aggressive pulling jimmy up
damn coulda been a stop
jfc
no
patrick no
0 sacks smh
i wouldnt have imagined this after that fumble
fuck not queen
im guessing a concussion
wrap the fuck up
unreal
jc i cant take it
and right on cue
please no more injuries
they need to learn to wrap up then go for the ball stop bouncing off
damn queen is still in the game
ok judon
lets fucking go defense
omg i was expecting a flag
way to go you big veiny d
is that the game
judon clutch af
lets goooooooo
fuck yes
yes d
i am live finally first i want to say lamar hit a lb so hard he made him cry and props to skura for playing dad and tried to whoop some ass when lamar got speared
judon did a thing
judon holy shit
judon nearly unblocked made a play
fuck yes penefuckingtration
great stop
lets go d
wow colts had been getting 4 or 5 a run i think they over thought that one
brown was standing in the danger zone there that was close
judon playin soccer
potg will be the second half adjustments on this one if we hold on
absolutely sexy nice defense boys
fg and we win
we had 10 ppl on the field as well lol
stupid play call from indy
i am fine with that
lol the colts have 16 plays 47 yards in the 2nd half 0 points

domination
this is where we are our best
well they get the ball right back
did i just hear that guys name is grover stewart
what the shit i thought it was still the 3rd quarter haha
boy thats disappointing
hines gotta fair catch
colts dealing with a lot of injuries this game too
another injury wtf man
save dorsey no more punts
here comes rivers with his cry baby bullshit
lmao wtf kind of 4th down play was that
cry baby rivers
solid coverage by bonds
lots of rivers throws to the middle of the field where ed reed 100 couldve hustled and gotten there
lol they tried to run a bullshit pick play but ended up fucking themselves over
i mean id go for it but i might be insane
automatuck
still so little protection from the line hopefully our starting 5 can mesh a little bit down the line
dagger we win
good getting some practice time in for justin tucker to show that hes still the best in the league
need a mandrews td or antonio brown to fuck shit up to win my fantasy game
automatuck
damn last miss 2015 gotta love tucker
bonds got hurdled
kicker tackle
what is going on
good guys win today boys
watch them kick a field goal here
how can an offense this retarded be a professional nfl offense
lamars been decent this game greg roman isnt giving him anything to work with
greg roman wow lamars doing good lets give the ball to someone else

fuckyou
lol that was not a catch
a player makes one tweet about being frustrated with our terrible offense and yall wait to talk shit on our own player lol weird as fuck
if lamar isnt even going to attempt to look down field then yea i guess he is just a rb playing qb at this point
refs have a huge hate boner for the ravens this year thats split second bullshit
hey a bad call went our way for once i guess ill take it
pitch it lamar like wtf
judon drops into coverage a lot and is pretty decent at it for an lb do you guys know anything or just like to complain
this sub makes it sound like we the jets we doing something right we 52
holy fuck our offense is dogshit bruh i might have to stop watching this shit
this makes me more nervous than i already was ugh
dobbins missed call
eh its still early we got time to adjust
classic ravens secondary
who do i feel like this will be our yearly blowout game
go get em soldier
they need to stop running the ball on first down straight up we cant block well enough to get one yard on a qb sneak let alone 5 on first down
the penalties dont stop man
if we go 14 down we will be forced to pass we cant pass this team cant win unless it has a nice lead
rivers looked just like brady bitch ass sitting in the grass like a scolded child
dude fuck all of these trick plays
we just plainly dont have the speed on the edge to stop screens it hurts to watch
any word on campbell
oh bonds even when you do something good you f it up
fuck this stupid ass playcalling man wtf is this
the ravens forced recovered a jonathan taylor fumble proceeded to return it 65 yds for a td

this marks their 21st straight game w a takeaway extending back to wk 4 2019 the longest active streak in the nfl longest streak by any team since the 1314 eagles also 21 nflresearch
i couldnt watch another week of our offense and judging off the comments i was right to do so
love peters getting into that that is a guy we want on our team
we gotta trade judon in the offseason man
judon is trash
im glad we look as bad as we do right now if we were up i have no doubt half of yall would be defending the bad offensive play just like last week and eagles week
yeahhh how about the souljas get open so we can use them damn that might be too much to ask these days
that should have been a flag on elliot useless hit too
this team is so pathetic with penalties
were playing a team that shuts the run down and we have top level speed at receiver the game plan check downs and runs up the middle were going to get blown out if we dont start throwing the ball past 5 yards
i thing but pain right now
i know im just a random dude in the sub but this sub gets way too doomer during game threads
goddamn it greg roman

x200b

why would you run it with a running back he fumbled


fire greg roman
this offense sucks absolute balls basically 0 redeeming qualities coordinators are bad and the players havent been any better
john dont waste the challenge here please
what is that challenge
another terrible challenge at least thats one thing that weve been consistent with
that was such a bad call but it went our way so im not complaining lmao
well the rules are 3 steps and like it or not peters did that i still dont think its a catch but it followed the new rules
oh my god we have an offense again
be ok baby
i fucking hate that we cant make 10 yards to put this thing to bed
were so afraid of lamars passing abilities as each game passes im starting to wonder more and more whether or not lamar is the future
man lamar has regressed so farthis is sad
we fucking stink
yo holy shit this sub is so fucking over reactive
you guys shitting on hollywood are some scum fuck you
two streaks end today

06 in indy
20 straight losses when trailing at halftime
stop this college bullshit become a real offense or we wont ever win shit fuck roman rn

all season yall have been begging for more running plays and now yall are mad that were not passing
legal hit
we need throw it downfield in the second half if lamar cant do it its time to move on
hey guys lets play rg3 fire all our coaches and draft a qb next year
welp folks guess the seasons over no point in watching any more of the games we all know whats gonna happen might as well trade lamar and hollywood for flacco

jfc some of you doomers are insufferable yes we were a dominant offense last year and while the offense hasnt played to that level this year it is still a good offense

were down 3 points on the road against another 52 team with a great defense

were down two all pros on defense were facing a very good defense and we get the ball to start the 2nd half have some fucking faith
fucking dumpoff on 3rd and 35
this team fucking sucks
removed
lol do people really think lamar is completely absolved of all blame hes been awful lately
havent kept up with the team this week are our guys back that were on the covid list or are we gonna have to try to win with 2nd and 3rd stringers
i think were going to be a wild card team
this year but i actually think that benefits us because there wont be a true home field advantage this year
anyone have a link to the game or know where i can get one i have hulu live but it doesnt get the chanel
im starting hollywood over mike evans this week the truzz is high today
well thats trash
awesome play call
nice play call
terrible
was that proche injured on the coverage
luckily im still riding the good day that was yesterday so far looks like its going to be a long game
70 already
im gonna have a stroke
this defense really isnt a good as the stats show turnovers is all it can rely on and why the numbers look good if they dont get tos though it looks mediocre we cant cover yac is probably 10 yrds average this year we cant get past a paper bag to put pressure on the qb even when we blitz 6 or 7 we lose 2 players and it too is borderline ready to collapse
r we this bad
hollywood needs to make that play
bitch what
0 rush yards in the quarter perfect start for colts
wolfe doing work
chris board flying around today
two top players on d are out two ol out offense in distress to start with

penalties bad snaps drops missed throws

not a great start
just gonna be one of those games nothing you can do about it
we scored 2 tds with lamar running down the middle lets not lose our mind
should we trade lamar for buck allen
this team doesnt deserve the playoffs
lamar bad
these play calls are ass man
something has to be going on in the locker room the way this team is playing with shows a lack of being mentally prepared and their execution i showing it lack of effort on plays always throwing their hands to the sides after it doesnt go their way all these sloppy penalties hollywood going on twitter etc theres something going on bc week 1 they looked bang on from last year this year they look like we are lucky to slide by into the playoffs
idk why i keep checking this thread yall some sour pusses
fuvking weak ass penalty
getting shutout in a half how grand
that kinda looked like a hit to a head
my god our defense needs to tighten up elliot could have really fucked doyle up there were lucky he didnt get ejected
ok wtf is going on
roman you pussy already giving up
two fucking runs in a row when the colts have timeouts harbaugh you absolute coward
we have to be the worst offence in the league take away the numbers and just watch this team play the giants look better than we do

time to say goodbye to gr
skura is having a nightmare game jesus christ
can we do anything on offense
anyone actually think our offense was going to do something there


me neither
they are taking rivers out so he doesnt fuck jt up with an int lol
punt punt punt punt punt punt
oh no we suck
i want marty mornhingweg back right now
the only person not being called out here is edc and its the makeup and depth of the ol that has this team in its current predicament
peters why the fuck are you celebrating you need to catch that dumb shit
john h is drunk as shit again
so now we lose a timeout with this challenge great yes i will eat my words if im wrong but thats not a catch
this is what desperation looks like its turned into one of those seasons real quick
we are doing fine guys just chill out still in it
harbaugh what are you smoking cuz it must be some strong shit
youve got to be shitting me with this challenge why are we so fucking stupid this year

other teams dont do this other teams are smart
oh no we suck again
that is a terrible call
this was a terrible challenge i bet greg roman told harbaugh to do this
fuck off all u haters with the dumb challenge shit
fuck you worst call in nfl history eat shit
steelers and colts fans are losers two straight weeks of whining
i wanna see a dez catch or td
boy that closeup looked like he was convulsing wtf
looks like time for a new conditioning coach
no dez
bonds is worthless
gimmick bullshit offense
everything theyve said about lamars throwing is ending up being right this dude cant throw for shit this year
what a fucking joke that is proof lamar just isnt what he was last season and these guys dont fear him at all
im fucking done
this is not our year
boy we got real bad this year
wtf is this challenge
harbaugh has had a lot of dumb challenges in his career but that might be the dumbest
i hate to see people hurt but leonard has been killing us the whole game
this second announcer is annoying as fuck

such a goober who put this dude on tv
half of yall would not have made it through the boller era had u been here calm down
bad throw but gotta catch it
where the fuck are the 15 yard passes
greg roman is a fucking moron and we have no ol were looking at 2nd or 3ed in the division if we cant get shit going

lamar has seriously regressed he doesnt set his feet he has no quick reads and to make matters worse we have god awful leverage in the interior ol

skura is terrible and we never bothered to find heir apparent for rg which i mentioned in 20172018 discussions about the draft this game is won in trenches if you give a qb time they make plays we give opposing qbs time that our qb needs damn shame
team bailing out lamar
i am really getting sick of watching our defense give up consecutive 3rd down plays week in and week out they need to fix that or bring in people that will actually fucking play
what a dirty fucking hit wow
today is the day hollywood brown finally goes off
white jerseys purple pants today
does dez see the field today
what kind of drop off can we expect with fort out
this can either be a breakout game for dez and he can establish himself in the offense or hes going to leave us scratching our head thinking what were we thinking signing a old wr
i got in on yall at 110 am i missing something bc that seems like easy money
khalil dorsey yay
who will take the fruit punch today with marlon out

elliot
come on boys we need this to bounce back
hollywood will get the first td of the game
fight fight fight
burger

edit ah no campbell is down
welp time to start drinking again
at least hes walking
this is definitely not our year
if hes out were fucked
walk it off calais
fuck man were cursed these last couple of weeks
oh no
no what the fuck
god dammit
calais plz get up
hoping its just a cramp
calais looks like hes talking about the way his leg moved to the trainers like he twisted something
is cambell ok
goddamnit
nice stop good shit
ah fuck
good job
great stop d hell yeah
i like how chris board has been playing
jackson to bryant for a 20 yard gain plz
i seriously thought proche was going to try to pick that up
lets go lamar show them who you are
good decision making proche
those hurdles rarely work
boyle was hurdling when andrews was still in college nice try tho charles
snead looked open no
lets go offence

oy vey
dorsey is hurt now too
bleh was hoping wed actually come out with some type of a decent drive
this offense better not waste a good defensive performance again
we have 3 healthy corners thank god for the swiss army knife levine
are frank reich and harbs related
screen tears us up what a surprise
mcstuffed
thats textbook edge setting goddamn
this front is doing good against that colts ol
looks like wilkins struck mcphees helmet that shouldve been a penalty
missin that fruit punch
ugh we need a turnover here
this was less than ideal
how could this happen to me
were gonna live in die by our pass rush today
1 possession game lets go match that then its 00 again
i said it two weeks ago this is not a top 5 team with the offense the way it is now were facing good teams while in transition its not a good situation
maybe bonds will improve but right now he is dog shit three of our top corners are out were going to get fucked
alright boys go light these mofos up
lets go dez
wellp were down 7 better not run the ball for the next 8 drives in a row
i got a real bad feeling about this
well defense is getting gashed as expected lets hope the offense can do something that 3rd down option was god awful so im hoping roman can actually call something good
i knew that even if the guys on the covid list played theyd struggle and the guys who were in practice like campbell ngakoue and peters were going to have to dominate for us to win if campbell doesnt come back this game is over
just tuning in now did i miss anything
lol this is just sad
yoooo this is a joke right

disaster waiting to happen

god bless jk
man o man
double pa screen
fuck with that much misdirection i would like to go downfield
dobbins is incredible
theres our weekly screen play
tight end wildcat trick play
dez
edit nvrmnd
okay lets be honest a quick out is awesome even if its basic for the rest of the nfl
put dez in
dez on the field
damn they saw right through that dez decoy
keep the quick passes coming
this center is going to give me a heart attack
holy fuck we saw the same thing against pitt last week they are just living in the backfield
how good is hollywood at runblocking
dez sighting
lfg
great throw and route lets see more of that
just woke up what did i miss
at least it wasnt a 3 and out
the laker fans bullied their bench players into playing good maybe we can do the same idk
zero offense zero defense sigh
d not helping either
streams are extremely shitty today but its ok if the teams playing this bad again
oh shit
ok how about we double whoever bonds is on with a safety
caught by whoever is being guarded by bonds
rivers throwing at bonds every time
they got so lucky
chuck siiuuuuuuu
week in week out i love our defense so much
fuck you phillip
danger danger
bonds is getting ripped to shreds today
lets fucking gooooooo
ok we take those
please be a fumble
now that was a good hurdle
wooooooooo
bailed out
spoke too soon
get burns outta there
td lets go
the streak continues
what just happened
literally just tuned in touchdown baltimore
thats my hokie
pittman is a good receiver thats the matchup theyre gonna target all game dude was arguably a first round wideout
should stand
new ball game
were back in this game bless u chuckclark
wow nice run back on the fumble
chuck
lmfao rivers
nice
huge
hell yes
rivers got into his wifes defensive position and it was just as effective
taylor focused too much on trying to put a hit on peters and coughed it up lol
hell yeah baby lets gooo
lets go defence hit em in the mouth
fruit punch juice kings of the punch out
good angles by defenseugh
that commercial got me
cant contain the left side of the field mcphee playing right and peters on left make it an easy choice
ughhhh that would have been nice
terrible pass coverage
i see why bonds plays db and not receiver
rivers mad he couldnt get the penalty yards need to put some pads into him
damn that would have been such a cool looking int
bonds is a ducking spaz lmao
fucking catch that barry bonds
ughhhhhh
bonds come on bro
if thats not enough evidence to cut bonds idk what is
lol
extra men on the field again why do we do this so often
uuuuuuuuuuuuugh
the disrespect
wr smacked it on his way out
0 rush yards lol
nice play lamar
play our game and run the ball get something going and we can set up the pass
did he say kenny moore made the tackle
zoneread 3
feeling this offense now
im loving how we are attacking the flats
removed
what in the world
flucker got pancaked
fluker gets blown up and causes that failed play
frauds
see what happens when we run the ball more
man getting one first down seems to be our offensive ceiling so far
why do we run lamar up the middle we lost one of the best tackles in the league let him race them to the sideline or something if you must run him
zero fucking offense tucker isnt going to get us a sb let alone wins this is embarrassing
we might need to try something else on 3rd
blow the offense up
that option shit needs to be over
i like running different type of plays just not getting the blocking
offense just looks uninspired
never thought this thread would look like this last season
its like greg roman has personal beef with lamar and wants him to look bad this is embarrassing run formations that have a running back in the backfield
at this point why not let lamar and the offense call plays
i just see no desire in jacksons eyes lately that sideline shit just reminded its like there is no competitive drive like hes had in the past
we need to revamp the iol and the wr position asap
theres no way that the players arent souring on greg roman they used their voice to get earl thomas out do it again
lol we need to pick a guard in 1st round but well end drafting etienne
how are we boys i had to go to whataburger real quick left right after fumble 6
i think defenses have just figured out weve ripped every page out of the playback w a pass 10yds plus in the air
i trust this defense to win this game for us than the offense
offense cant maintain blocks defense cant get off of them awesome
another hold so tired of nfl reffing
ngakoue
anybody else thinking lamar has been dealing with some nagging injury since he took that nasty hit in week 2
is judon playing
i could literally play wr for the ravens no talent needed
i like the screens and dump offs i do not like the lack of our downhill run game maybe i have a short memory but we have not ran up tue gut but twice maybe our oline is getting beat up and gro unwilling
lol theyre using screens like reid and kc
god if we dont draft rashod bateman with our first this year imma be fuming
has dez played yet just remembered he was back for this game
souljas plz
anyone else feel its still too early for all the holidays stuff my neighbors are putting their decorations up as we speak and now theyve had commercials for holiday stuff
we need to rip them now and get an offensive score before the half
these weird plays where they run 4 yard routes are killing me
screen passes all day huh
this awful
we suck
fucking brutal
first good throw ive seen
fucking finally a shot down field
more throws like thatplease
can we all agree at least that the camera work by cbs is absolute shit today
have we crossed midfield yet this game
there you go llama
finally
lets go
needs to get his head in the game looks uninterested lol
this is difficult to watch to say the least
3 wr just went straight vertical lol these play designs are amazing
threading the needle
i want to see other plays besides seam route or curl to andrews we need wrs involved beyond the sticks nice throw though
hes alive
oh we are the pretenders
we did something

and lamar can make these throws and has made these throws pretty well so why the fuck does roman not want to call them
are they scared of our oline or what endaround screens makes me think they are
there you go throw on the moneyof the issues are execution related
miscue on the snap shocking
really nice throw by lamar there
clock will start on the snack
i was hoping they would go to andrews there credit to lamar for putting it in there mark needs to get more involved and they need to draw up more plays like that
i was certain this drive was over the moment lamar threw incomplete on 1st down glad to be proven wrong
great goddamn throw lamar
every read is triple covered
were horrible
and come crashing back down to earth
shoulda been picked
how df do u throw that
lucky as fuck that wasnt an int
and then a shouldbe int
whats that explanation
this is not a relaxing way to spend my afternoon
manthis couldnt be more different from last year
why are we abandoning the run already
what kind of sorry ass route was that
lamar bro you gotta slide feet first
no come tf on
lamar is missing reads and i dont know why hes missed some wide open receivers this game but hes not as rushed as last week oline doing better in pass protection than last week
weve now reached the force it to hollywood stage of ravens play
forcing the throw stop throwing forced throws
oh my dude
man the offense manages to somehow look worse just wild
marcus peters needs to take a chill pill
wtf lamar get your head in the game man this isnt going to help the defense cant bail you out for all these misreads i swear he gets in his head sometimes and loses focus
we literally give away first down every time
steelers did the same shit against lamar last week
he lowered the helmet crazy
this play calling is dog shit
this looks worse then the 2014 offense
thats the clowney tackle right there
at least the refs are trying their best guys
lol the line getting destroyed immediately after the snap
penalties extending drive we playing pittsburgh ball now boys
blackmon been watching game footage of minkah fitzpatrick
oh thats a greasy hit we cant be having too many of those or itll be rg3 time
god i love juiceman
can we stop running up the middle its just not working
mp gotta chill though i love that he loves his guys

this offense should not look this bad
who cares if dobbins goes down there holy shit 0 holes
god i love peters perfect raven
hope that penalty gets us mad and wakes us up
lol rb gets the handoff and the oline is like 2 inches in front of him
that dude wasnt even blocked wtf
lamar wtf
wtf
holy

fucking

shit
damn
lets run backwards now
trace mcsorely wya s
we are fucking double teaming and still cant stop the rushers
jesus fuck
offensive line is getting pantsed today that wasnt even a a blitz
nice job getting us out of fg range bruh real heads up play
dobbins just giving the block up
nice protection form offensive line
fuck
madden curse
how tf is lamar putting himself into contact you if he doesnt duck hes taking a full on head shot shut the fuck up
what is it 3rd and 40
lmfao 2 penalties on us at least the defense gets to rest while they watch this debacle
throw it away
jesus fucking christ
we take holding penalties and still cant pass protect
this offense is just an empty husk of last years offense
that was another screen 5 they dont believe lamar can do anything with his arm
smart to get it out quick so we can have a better position to punt the ball from
biscotti please step in and do something
this is so painful
this oline is so atrocious right now jesus fuck
have we run yet
fire greg roman immediately
need short throw plays please roman our offensive line sucks and hollywood doesnt need to run a go route every play
and now we give up running the ball
so i guess our offense is busy taking instagram pics and playing warzone when they should be practicing
that would have been so clutch
whos the interim oc if roman goes culley
at least last week the whole offense other than 1 player looked really good this week it all looks like shit
that made me jump off my seat lol
flag
our offensive line is getting so little push idk how anyone expects us to run or pass we need tempo or something to mix it up
whyyy judon
are you kidding me
guess we lean on the defense like ol times
judon again
judon a meme
sure i guess
two penalties in one play awesome job team
lmfao
omfg
oh come on
awesome have the pinned and he jumps offside cant wait to wave goodbye to him
fuck man cant catch a break
that fucking hurts both rivers and the ravens
i want to cry
and now we collapse and watch them march 90 yds for a td sigh
both those penalties were on mcphee not judon
on track for another record setting penalty day
somehow these coaches have made this team worse than the sum of its parts
such bad discipline why are we getting these stupid ass defensive penalties every week
soft
the lack of discipline is disgusting
he was so wide open smh
corners playing way to softly
hold them to a fg here go to the locker room only down by 3 and re group
someone needs to make that face that rivers made into a meme
wish theyd show the replay on some of these tackles that one by ferguson and the one by wolfe earlier looked like they just reached out and grabbed the player and that was enough to stop them
remember to keep the compliments coming as fast as you do the insults
their lt has consistently put his hands in the rushers face
oh we lucky if elliot isnt ejected and that was a dpi
idk ive ever seen a guy out there with glasses on
werent like 3 colts players not set and moving before the snap on the 3rd down play
elliot needs to go for the ball he didnt lower his shoulder until well after tip
whos the blame of the game so far
another screen the fuck is this
kinda deep now to make anything happen before half
were inside our own 10 to start wtf
on track for another 10 penalties vs 23 for us
sigh
standard take a knee
this offense and brain dead penalties
seriously this has to be coaching we cant be losing or almost losing games because of penalties
there kicker has been damn good for them so far making 1618 he was the top kicker prospect coming out for the 2020 draft and i was honestly so surprised a team didnt take a late round flier i get why though because there hasnt been a kicker that didnt bust since seabass
just kneel the fucking ball why even try
kneel it out
the colts marched from their 10 can we do the same
wtf is wrong with this team
oline is baaaaaaad
we just do not look like a well coached team
im so fucking sad dammit
slant for a first down look at that
that was loud howd he stay up
lets get another fumble for a td here
i would like our offense that could march down the field at will and go on 10 minute drives back please
int return td please
lol
shitty first half
another fucking flag jfc
lol
oh no we suck again
and it wasnt a fucking sack tho
hope we have some damn good halftime adjustments
hat forward he learned
is russellstreetreport down for anyone else
feels bad man
did dez play yet late watching so happy for him
lamar has 2 seconds first down
holy shit a completed pass
p a s s i n g
okay lets keep this damn pace up
ok whatever adjustments got made at the half look good on this drive
finally
were the only franchise in the nfl that never gets their qb a true number 1 wr lol
setting up their spies with slants
boom boom lamar is in the room
thats more fucking like it
that was weird
we back from the dead like chief keef
looks like they gave quite the pep talk at half
why not go deep its 2nd and 1
remember the 2012 playoffgame against pats when harbs said at half they decided to put the ball in lamars hands i feel like this could be a similar watershed type moment

edit whoops of course i mean joseph vincent flacco
lamar can throw to receivers
we made yards
lamar isnt the type of qb thats gonna launch one downfield wish we would use this intermediate game more
wow offense looks awake now
thats my mvp
look guys were doing something
where was this 1st half
running the ball

roman fuck you pass it
and you keep letting him throw downfield nice catch mark fucking gro
four rushes with running backs what the fuck
here we fucking go
thats not lamar on the field
lets go boys were moving that ball
see what happens when you call normal ass pass plays with no pa
nice catch
someone entered a cheat code during halftime aka they all got reamed the fuck out lol
i still dont like roman but he made adjustments its a step
has the offense just officially woken up
its happening
oh hey look lamar is faster than most people on the field it works when he races them to the sideline

gro qb sneak up the middle
we have the personnel this is what we needed
pa pass to dez td coming up
holy shit they had jackson run on the outside
throw it to dez
you cant spell red zone without dez
lift up the receiver ill make you a believer

depeche mode personal jesus
lol we were hustling indy the entire first half
nooi
uh wtf is happening im not complaining because our offense is looking lively now

but we deadass look like a completely different team from the 1st half
ravens have more first downs in 3 minutes than the entire first half
for fucks sake
wow
kill me
lmao dawg come tf on
no words
jesus shit
sigh
gus needs to sell that fake better
sigh
bus
thanks mecari for nothing
judt what we needed
wow that was the post painful play of the season
imagine not holding onto the ball on the goal line
when it rains it pours
oh my god
crushing
dobbins should get every rb touch from now on
and just like that hopes are dashed
lmao this shit is brutal man
what a tease lmfao
just stomp on my dick while youre at it fuck
props to hollywood saving the td
mp come on
jfc mp
wow
oh
big truzz i have hope
are you fucking kiddignksamfv dk
juiceman almost took it right back
thats fucking opi
fade me
fucking kill me
lol just lol


whyyyyyy
why did you not let him come down with that deshon
omg
this game is such a cocktease
are you actually kidding me
bro why are we challenging this
fucking embarassment
borderline fumble
catch n fumble lol

what is this challenge

wtf
why do this
guess we are in fuck it why not mode
no replay cbs
marcus
fuckkkkkk
pls reverse it
thats a stupid challenge
no way they change this
i dont think they are going to reverse that he did t make a football move imo
that would be a challenge of an int right
what a dumb challenge
who made this call to challenge whoever it was needs to be demoted
why does harbaugh sometimes just challenge when he doesnt like what happened even when its obvious
one step forward three steps back
ik the fumble sucked the air out of the room but at least the offense didnt look totally inept
oh shit
has vietnam flashbacks to the infamous 511 season in 2015
wow
wow i was wrong lfg
brilliant
yes
yoooooo
lets go
lets go
wow
finally the refs dont fuck us over
does harbaugh ctually expect that to get overturned i dont understand the thought process timeouts are very valuable in close games and he is giving them away
oh shit
lets get yall started again lamar jackson is terrible reminds me of a hyped of geno smith or josh freeman im glad we have a real passer like dak poor dez
omg we got it back
no fucking way

bad challenge harbaugh
oh shit
called it
lets goooooooo
lets gooooooooooo harbaugh you wizard
what lol
well thats lucky lol
hahahahahahahahahahahhahahaha
wow
hahahahahahhahah
holy fuck thats my coach
whaaaaaaat
what
does peters get credit for an interception there
lfg
damn okay harbs
sure
holy fuck
hell yeah
each and every one of you can eat your words
wow wow wow
lmao
eating more crow i guess belly full
hell of a challenge love harbaughs guts there peters definitely had the ball long enough refs shouldve blown the whistle
learn football guys lmao
well thats a complete horseshit call
lol idk man thats not a good call
i dont understand that what so ever
holy fucking harballs
this dude has no idea what the catch rule is going to the ground isnt a part of the rules anymore hasnt been for 3 seasons
big brain harbs
yooooooooooooooooooooo
jackson is looking a little more into it this half it seems
peculiar call

harbaugh playing 4d chess rn
soulja
lmao ill take it
look at that protection line is back baby
hollywood taking a hit there
were fine we got momentum in that last drive and were moving the ball the fumble was unfortunate but its not indicative of the offense
lets go hollywood big dawg woo woo
if i was an indy fan i would be livid right now
does no one else see that limp when lamar is going slow or am i crazy
i guess the passing game is alive now lets go
has dez got a reception yet just now tuning in
that was a strike
wow darius leonard their best player defensively
charles davis is suck deez with that no catch nonsense
m v p

v

p
andrews rey fight lmaoo
finally 3rd and 1 just pound it nothing stupid
we already have twice as many yards and first downs this half than we did in the first half
eject that fucker
glad to see some fight in this team it helps to actually have some structure
no no no we need 3 if we get to 4th
gus edwards is a mack truck
im waiting for those three magic words

andrews redzone touchdown
lamar draw and get stuffed here watch
lets go gus
put dez in
lets get my boy ricard a td here in the flat
leave the ball in lamars
i think we would take our 3 right
he def got in
colts are a bunch of cry babies
wow no qb sneak and it works
does harbaugh just know the rules so well that he knew to challenge that questionable int
umm what
lol
td
hes in
thank god
gus bus
finally
why tf dont they just count it since scoring is reviewable
mekaro just prevented a td there he was way out past where he should and forced the bus outside
thats an example refs gave a td to them earlier in the same fucking situation
glad we didnt challenge good initiative to go for it still worried but at least were seeing something on offense i may have been a bit too defeatist after the last turnover
lets go
its pretty sad that gus edwards has been our offensive mvp of the year so far lmao fucking love that guy
gus bus
boom
ricard is a grown ass man
our curse will extend into the second half unless
wtf was that throw by rivers
bears with a screen 7 yards behind los
hell yea d
im actually feeling confident about this game now
our number one rushing offense forgot that running the football is an option
credit to lamar his spidey sense is good
he juked himself out
pass pro looking pretty solid right now
if the ol were like last year a 4 man rush doesnt stop lamar
go for it
feel like that spot sucks
prayers to indy they had a fuck ton of injuries this game
what kind of spot is that
go for it
why does lamar always look miserable lol
analytics
gotta love how were just casually trotting subs in with 12 left on the play clock
why even hesitate
please dont do a qb run up the middle
if he had hit the drag route that wouldve been a first down
that was horrible you get lined up at least you can try to get them to jump

i want a play action pass
shouldve had someone flop get the free break
love the commercial hate the new coffee machines its like the coffee comes out too foamy or something idk
i still the last few weeks and the first half here shows gro needs to go
i will never get used to a rtj song being used to sell cars
i wanna see dez throw up the x so bad
hollywood got open after lamar was running to the opposite sideline
so like our offense is competent again
can we please get a new center next year
tale of two halves we look like a different team and llama looks confident
honestly think colts defense blew their load in the first half they were running with such speed and intensity now they are tuckered out
bozeman gets absolutely destroyed
lets get 6 mannnnnn
the boot love it
love that shit bitches
yaaaaass queen
touchdown
that second half swing finally we are doing it
hes back baby
lamar is sneaky again
the streak continues
this is so much more like it
it feels good it feels real good seeing this offense work
harbs must have told lamar to just be himself and have fun he looks like the mvp right now
that was a really great block by mark andrews on lamar jacksons td run he absolutely mauled his assignment all the way into the endzone
what a classic bootleg amazing
pq trying to turn into a thumper
how did we leave him so open
fumbles happen reich not using your best offensive weapon is just helping us you idiot
fuck
great
bruh cmon
right on the chin
just hold them to 3
is that a shoulder injury
why what have we done to deserve this
were now leading 9th team overall with most
injuries this season
pick defense

what happened with queen had to step away for a bit
aint get it
nice
fucked his ass up lets go
thank you judon
hand to the face
whats up with calais
did they say what happened to queen
woooow that was a touchdown if judon missed a half step
ok 5 minute drive and lets go home
love this defense
wind that clock down
in your face rivers
i want harbs mask
wtf was that
time to grind their souls into the ground with the gus bus
ew
sam koch fake in coming
we shouldve let lamar play his game and get us that first down
how is indy out of tos
whats old man rivers crying about get yo sorry ass back there and throw a pick
this was a quick one imo
is it against the rules to throw a pass when the games in the bag
he dont miss
would like to do at least 1 or 2 playaction to change it up
fuck it lets get the ball back and run up the score even more
tuuuuck
16 forced fumbles that cant be right
anyone know how good colts rush d is im curious



my

imagine being comftorable with giving lamar an extension of any kind at this rate

colts look like what we used to

somehow this is all greg romans fault i blame every blown coverage every penalty on him my broken spirit on him
lamars been playing kinda bad ever since i bought my lamar jackson funko pop last sunday morning lol
yeah im switching to redzone

this offense is just miserable to watch
that is 100 a catch and fumble
rivers going for 300 and 3 tds today
all because marlon humphrey had to go out and eat with friends
get hill off this team no purpose for him anymore
josh allen is a better qb right now because their team is letting him get better and throw the ball continuously

we shit on flacco by getting him no weapons and were shitting on lamar by not letting him grow lamar can be a top 10 passer every season if we let him
so we just not going to adjust today
just woke up but nothing looks good so far dammit
fuck this shit man lamar just isnt the gamechanger he was last season we are so screwed
what happened to lamar
we might as well have kyle boller rn
we basically have an elusive faster joe flacco making boneheaded decisions under pressure
lamar really likes running into sacks when things dont go perfectly this season
can anyone put a finger on whats wrong with lamar this season
when do we start the harbuagh has lost this team threads
oh shut up the hit on sneed was way worse
indys d been headhunting our offense and hitting lamar every play they gotta expect the same

the refs need to start calling these penalties or itll only get worse
boring team lmao
this offense is broken
stop running the fucking ball
after that atrocious first half we kinda look good i guess
never seen lamar look so average there







i dont have the highest hopes

i think we can win but it is going to take a lot of things to go right for us and some things to go wrong for indy
this is going to get ugly soon
hollywood really didnt complete that pass smh easy shit man
this is a wrap
can they sprinkle some deer antler stuff on calais calf
god of war 4 prequel
hey wink they keep attacking us on the outside how about we adjust
wink naw buddy we good
9 first downs already
bonds fucking sucks
damn man where all these souljas at
unbelievable throw something other than a dump off you bum
holy shit this offense sucks i cant believe the team is ok with this play calling
what happened to our offense and what has happened to lamar
awful pass
jackson has regressed to first year college qb this year
these penalties are ridiculous harbaugh get your shit together
roman calling short passes because of the oline
honestly at what point is this on harbaugh as well for not realizing greg is ruining lamar and looking to actually get this offense to do something
lamar staring off into the abyss sigh
who do you all propose we replace roman with not gonna find anyone decent midseason
damn they folded him like a cheap suit
lamar is going to end this game with negative yards at this rate lmao
this offense stinks and it starts with lamar and roman
spain
some thoughts so far

this has been a fucking awful game
the announcers talking about their luggage for 5 minutes almost gave me a fucking aneurysm

gus is maybe the least elusive rb ive ever seen in my life

really not ideal so far
thats the game you dont come back from that
that was a fumble by peters but alright
how could lamar let that happen
this challenge feels like a desperation attempt to switch momentum
not a catch but okay
harbaugh betting on the low iq of the refs good shit
this has been a historically pathetic offensive stretch for the ravens and thats really really saying something
colts fans are big mad in their sub right now
we need more shots down the field
run game is back boys
this aint a knock on my guy fort but what sort of finger injury keeps you out for a game is the club hand not a thing anymore
give me a break
the fact that we cant even sack old man rivers is so unreal
the one time judon does something
dumb call when you need 1 yard to salt the game roman will rpo every down every situation except that i guess cmon man
tbf none of you 300lb couch potatoes could have even got in position to sniff that int
lamar is absolutely figured out this year boys
get rid of the fucking ball you idiot mother fucker you are costing us points and games
lamarg3
its one thing to suck but i thought this team would at least look pretty good and play fun games doing so this is closer to jets football than chiefs
we could end up 3rd in the division
lamarg3
why is this team so fucking retarded
this team sucks 5 inflated wins against bad competition
lol at this board complaining about the offense

if you want a better offensego get better offensive talent

you guys sit up here and cheer as the front office goes defense defense defense in the draft off season trades and in season trades

all while the offense clearly has signs of weaknesses desperately needs a no 1 wr and needs ol help and the complain about the offense not putting up elite numbers against the nfl best defenses

no your defense better play lights out or this team is going nowherebecause the offense is so limited with talent

the offense is an afterthought
nothing is going right today lamar couldnt even unstrap his helmet coming off on the first try anyone else see that shit
refs gave them that drive it wasnt a roughing the passer qbs get too much protection
thats a terrible hit

turnover or we can pretty much call it
bad throw tbh
lamar already peak
god damb dj fluker is ugly as fuck
rivers had zero pressure that entire drive this is not a playoff defense i know its early but its not a good start at all
this interior line needs out skura and bozeman specifically
we arent even looking like a team that should make the wild card rn
good call
this game should be easy
why the hell is judons trash ass covering a te wink has some explaining to do
whens the last time we saw a wr make a catch that good for the ravens smitty
yeah this game over

it turns out there sometimes are good calls by nfl refs
another fucking game ender that cant be gotten just awful
lamar needs to fucking humble himself dobbins had that first down just give it to him
what do you think the chances are this team gets hot the last 34 weeks before playoffs
couldve had dk
this mvp plays like absolute garbage im piss
how could lamar do this loudly exclaims the fan of an already offensively unimpressive team thats missing 3 pro bowl players and 2 starters that it had the year before
that injury to me looks really fucking concerningb

we cant just keep hiding lamars deficiencies at throwing the ball downfield lets find out right now whether or not we should be looking for a new quarterback in 2021 by making our passing offense more aggressive
lamar seriously went from an mvp caliber playing to the worst starting qb in the division
thats the frustration from mcphee has harbaugh lost the locker room there is zero discipline game after game after game
ive seen enough cant watch this team on live tv die a slow death literally crumbling before my eyes
fuckin greg roman calling the same play 3 times in a row

he was just lucky our guys actually blocked

he shouldve called a bootleg and tried to trick them idiot
fire gus rhe bua edwards do it now justin tucker should have got the touchdown because gus fumbled yall doo doo comments after gus made a bad play fire greg roman not gus lol
already lost
if this is the level of play the offense takes the rest of the season theres a legitimate case for lamar mvprepeat
too many injuries not winning this game regroup and beat the pats next week
that is a gut punch to end this game and honestly put a big impact for the rest of the season
its averett time
what the fuckwas that
no sir i dont like it
take it easy boys we got this
if hollywood starts to go off by the end of the game yall better keep that same energy
dam rivers has all day
holy shit lets go
fucking killing us on the edge theyre not gonna let our rush get home with these quick plays out there gotta try to dare them to throw downfield
is campbell out for the game
fuckkkk
bonds
fucking
sucks
dropped
a
interception
get
him
out
could have redeemed himself their
greg roman needs to be fired
stop running the stupid fucking read option today switch it up
if greg roman ruins our franchise qb
bet money this doesnt pass the qst down marker
finally a good pass
i dont think that shouldve a flag he didnt slide feet first
lamar doesn know what step up in the pocket means this sack is on him
hit rivers on every fucking play their defense it out here headhunting we need parity at this point
all afc teams are winning against nfc too
why man
of fucking course its judon
fucking ridiculous
jalen ferguson is a turd for real looks lost all the time
hahahahahaha
smh
lmao this offense is fucking terrible
fucking terrible
funny enough there is a persistent coaching decision issue which is running edwards as our number 1 which is clearly on harbaugh
i dont want to see edwards get another snap
depending on the result of the next drive im just gonna turn off the game
i mean he takes 4 steps
dez caught it
hey our plays work better when the blocking execution is good neat
hollywood was open
hollywood was open
that should do it
gus fucking earned those last 3 yards there
roughing the kicker there
cant get these first downs
why not try to score another td
fuck you ea for placing this madden curse on us
removed
a coach with balls would put in rg3 for the second half this is high school level qb play
see lamar look at jacoby he knows how to throw the ball away
notouryear
rip to alex trepek
lmfao

is it the playcalling or the execution either way pathetic done with this game for now nauseating
mcphee mcsucks
harbs is literally the worse challenge coach wtf is he doing why do they always challenge the worst calls
this is one of the most embarrassing challenges ive ever seen im speechless
take this tired team well deserved dont get me wrong and we still beat those sorry ass cowboys fuck the steelers
put rg3 in
jesus christ lamar just play a clean game and stop being so reckless
this games gonna be a blowout
trace mcsorely 2nd half leggooo s
this is not a super bowl caliber team
oh look a straight up pass play and it worked dipshit roman pass the ball let lamar grow
do we have any plays from under center
lamar needs to make that throw easier and marquise needs to catch it regardless went both ways there
im not looking forward to bootlickers saying that everything is fine and that were on the right path this team has no identity or swagger especially hollywood
this bitch is wearing glasses lol
harbaugh wtf
someone explain why youd celebrate after you fucking drop an interception you had two hands on
awful throw
colts fan here chill out guys its early
when is ngakoue making his debut

soooooooo has yannick done anything yet
that was the worst call of the season and you know it
achilles
this game is not close to over
if this continues the rest of the year a qb is getting taken 2nd round minimum too much talent in everything except the wrs to let waste

harbs in the hot seat at all
trace mcsorley time
yannick has done nothing
will jackson get a first down this drive damn he sucks now would rather have flacco
that was an awful play by lamar
cant wait until i get to see all the welllamar just had his worst game of his career for the 5th time this season im not saying rg3 is a better option but fuck lamar just isnt in it this year how many more times are we gonna say worst game of his career before we just call it was it is hes having a dreadful season
can we just fire roman and play rg3

im sick of this shit
defense is good offense is garbage
fuck bad throw well more of a late one

edit it should have been caught still late and a little low
it is probably blasphemy to say this but maybe its time to move on from harbaugh bisciotti nearly fired him two years ago

removed

is something wrong with lamar he looks lost this season
ngakoue did not do anything more than ward man
ravens seem to be getting all the call
removed
ravens drafting sucked last two years tbh
removed

hes fine
lamars decision making still isnt the best but its not horrible i also think gregg roman is probably putting a lot of pressure on him to play a certain way and lamar is more of an instinctual kind of player
the big one for me is the offensive line lamars accuracy has typically been exactly as good as his throwing mechanicsfootwork hes been rushing his mechanicsfootwork because the ol has been worse and hes had less time to work with
hes under more pressure wrs arent good enough he isnt as effective as a runner and as a result hes trying to do too much and making poor decisions
bad oline bad wrs one less quality te romans offense has been figured out its not really all on lamar hes definitely played worse but its not exactly a good environmental and supporting cast for a young qb
hes played as a top 10 qb not a top 5 qb he wins games he doesnt turn the ball over that much and he is just trying to improve his passing we are 52 one of the best ds in the league but with a patchwork offensive line and a shaky wr core were fine
its a combination of things o line isnt a good play calling isnt as good they are forcing him to become more of a passer which in theory this makes sense in reality its taking away his game and what made him good hes a better passer when the opportunities to pass develop naturally everything feels forced right now which is why nothing is clicking

we always say it run the damn ball and let the passing game develop organically
i think hes hurt it was reported in training camp a groin injury that type of injury doesnt heal without weeks of inactivity i dont think he looks nearly as explosive as last year colts dlineman just cased him down that wouldnt happen last year
not great oline and bland play calling gro is driving his ferrari in 1st gear so far this season
the colts moving to indy happened way before i was born so this was more funny than sad it was a really creative headline though ngl
they are doing a story on it now
continued on super bowl sunday geez let me guess they will show how glorious it was for irsay to move the colts to indy and so good for the nfl in the midwest

ty hasnt been a number 1 for like 3 years they wont miss him at all
hes been number one on reputation only this year you could argue hes actually been their least productive receiver this year
our defense always showing up even if theyre banged up
bonds

knuck if you chuck boi



funny thing is thats also how many offensive tds the jets have since 2018
i wonder where the team ranks since its inception

most likely not starters caught the injury bug for sure

good idea but youre killing me with that your
why not both


someone tell greg roman that its already failed multiple times yet this idiot keeps running it im so fucking done with this dude

thank you for this
someone make the turtling into a gif
lamar is from florida so i think that explains the aggressive runs for no reason and any other behavior is the traits of a florida man

madden curse
last years cover star patrick mahomes super bowl mvp
no calvin broke the curse in 2013
yes
because the printing on a video game box has an actual effect on the outcome of a football game and or the performance of an individual

alternatively target someone more than 4 yards downfield
0 rushing yards in tge first quarter you need to throw the ball
the run isnt working either some of yall got the iq of a 3rd grader
because the colts top run defense definitely wont stack the box when you run the ball every down definitely not
first and foremost fire roman
thats all
second dirtiest player out there

hope they go 511 and miss the playoffs just so we dont have to deal with the headhunting again
why does this offense feel so underwhelming when i went through the kyle boller and flacoo years why
higher expectations
ha flacco always gave you 1 good quarter the flacco model was 1 good quarter get some points barely hold on lose in last seconds

edit for this struggling to see i was clearly making fun of joe here not making fun of lamar i never even mentioned lamars name
good to know superbowl mvp flacco was underwhelming for you

we have 3 corners probably why calling plays that require him to be on a tight end which isnt uncommon but undesirable
if youve seen judons percentage of plays where he drops in coverage over his career this is normal he doesnt just rush the passer every play hes very versatile
our offensive play calling is absolutely horrible ran a option reverse with willie snead nobody is remotely threatened by him running a reverse lol come on man what is this
this is the ravens offensive output from 20142017 its hard to watch and offers nothing

welcome new fans

shit is garbage
its a bit of a lot lmao the o line is getting beat lamar isnt playing well the play calling is shit the plays that worry me are the qbs runs we got two 3 with justice hill capable rbs let them run the ball dont risk lamar getting hurt hes been getting hit a lot the interior of the o line has been struggling all game
is it possible greg roman is a master play designer but an absolute shit show of a play caller that or is lamar trying too hard to prove hes a passer

i love lamar and i think he has the goods to beat the chiefs but i have serious doubts about roman and harbaughs reluctance to run a 4down running offense
they gotta open up the playbook im a huge lamar fan but if lamar is going to fail let him fail and vice versa we dont know what we have in him if we just let him throw 5 yard passes every drive like come on were not beating anybody with this offense lol
they were waiting until the half guys
the sky is blue these are things we know
play calling is a lot easier when you have actual talent on the offensive line
maybe theyre tanking for trevor lawrence

time travel is possible

welcome back to 201517
thats not greg roman marty mornhinweg some how came back
i really hate throwing blame on a single person but then i watch kyler running all over the field to the point where romo claims he might be the biggest running qb threat in the league right now and even calls out lamar then i get a little sad
and all this time i thought it was the flux capacitor that made time travel possible

shit take

clown
stfu
am i insane or are the helmets way shinier and more reflective than usual
dome stadium lighting makes them look that way
this is fine
2020
misleading d

at least the offense seems to have something going
fuck

good stuff
teams have no fear of an outside game this season especially since we are light at te seems like having a big bodied guy opposite hollywood would help create some space for our shortgame

i know he isnt who has was but he wouldnt be here if he hasnt shown he can run a goslant

we dont have a ton of weapons but it seems like we could be a bit more creative in forcing matchups

if i understood this right i think youre saying that jk is work horse rb instead of gus i may have misinterpreted my bad

if so i disagree i dont really see jk being like that i think we shouldnt use jk so often as hes just a rookie and we shouldnt create too much wear and tear on him

gus has proven why hes called the bus he barrels through defenders and is always reliable in getting those crucial few yards

thats just my opinion tho
wheres this offense been
i dont know but i fucking love it
boys making me proud right now
this offense is playing amazingly its incredible
was that last drive that ended in a rb running it in for a td did they figure something out or is all of this just false hope and wishful thinking

all of which have suited up in a ravens uniform
between ints ffs and frs marcus peters is responsible for eight turnovers so far this season
ravens
do you guys think that juiceman will be a first ballot hall of famer one day
i was worried that peters wouldnt look as good as he usually does with humphrey out holy fuck we actually have two elite corners
marcus peters was just credited with his 30th interception in his 85th career game

the last 2 players to reach 30 ints in their first 85 games hall of famers deion sanders and ed reed

ravensflock

github whatsnew
ravens legends ed reed and deion sanders
what a challenge flag by harbs
i knew wearing my peters jersey today was a good move
the more i watch his int the more i buy it he may have great control of the ball but hes the only one on it before it gets knocked out calling it a fumble makes sense and then we recover i didnt agree at first but seeing it more i think it was the right call
meanwhile if marlo for the rest of his career creates forced fumbles at half the pace he has this season he has a credible chance of cracking the top ten all time for ff as a fucking cornerback everyone else on that list is lbdledge
would be cool but im going to trust the coaching staff on deciding what kind of role hes ready to play today
just confused as to why we didnt have him in the two times we were in the redzone
how do yall feel about willie sneads performance these past two games
mr reliable when everything goes to shit willies still out there making plays
hes playing like he has finally realized his job is on the line
plays hard and does what is asked of him glad to have him on the team
hes a solid guy but 3rd option at best
textbook wr3
a lot more positively than earlier in the season i think hes really figuring out what he needs to do to be successful in the offense this year and is showing some nice yac moves

hes still a wr3 but hes really doing some shit the past few weeks
dudes a dawg these past few games when the ball comes his way dude makes plays miss his ramen hair doe
he does his job not much to say about him he isnt fantastic or anything neither is he bad hes just mediocre
i really loved him in 2018 was my favorite player that year seems like he always fought for every yard especially on 3rd down last year he kinda dissapeared but the last 2 games he seems to be getting back to that mentality this year
when hes schemed up he always comes through i love that guy
i like snead as a reliable 3 or 4 but when he got caught last week in the open field by a linebacker last week i believe it was 41 i lost all faith lol

broke the broncos record of 30
someone post this on rnfl
lets fucking gooo
we have the pats next week there offense hasnt been able to stay on the field all year so we should hopefully extend it to 32

does it count even though 7 of those points were a defensive td

glad they got it together harbs probably yelled at them
today solidifies what we saw with pitt lamar is growing defense did their job no doubt but lamar was able to put together solid drives from behind to take a 2 td lead hes growing and they makes me happy after the heartbreaking fumble after the drive starting the 3rd they came out and put another one together i might be wrong but this might be there first time lamar has won a game while trailing at the half thats growth
big facts
lol take my upvote
lmfaoo
ah yes my go to move when i need to pick it up in mw
pro gamer move
that and you gotta scoot your chair up so your one foot from the tv
lamar really put the team on his back
that was legit the first time ive ever seen us make a half time adjustment
lmaoo
exactly n i love it

pro gamer move
i hope lamar did some yelling
better play calling after the half
have an upvote
the halftime speech he mustve given these boys scary
imagine what he could do to a team that plays in the first half
would shell out some serious dough to be in that locker room at half
first time ive ever seen someone call him john h

upvoted
he probably just stared at them like a disappointed dad
probably just yelled at roman
am i missing something was there a speech at the half
a lot of assumptions going on here

good looks bro hope you seal your division with a dub on the steelers in a few weeks

this poor kid will go through life looking like a concerned mother

can you do us a solid and beat the steelers

this fits the chiefs game too
big facts

lamar finished with a 82 completion percentage 1923
nobody beats the ravens 21 times in a row when losing at half let this be a lesson to you all
a hard fought win we need a big win next week to boost our confidence for the titans game
give me more offense like the second half
hats off to wink and the defense after a week with little prep and key starters out they still played an amazing game
anyone else cheering for the best rivalry in the nfl renewed the undefeated steelers vs the legendary 26 cowboys
credit where credit is due the coaching staff came out at halftime and had a perfect gameplan shoutout to harbaugh and roman and wink was great all day
this is a big win mentally the talk is always about how the ravens cant come back after being down and they did it and they did it in a dominating fashion gus doesnt fumble in the rz and the score looks even worse
now roman if you can call every game like you called that 2nd half were going to go far please keep that up
we won a game we were losing at halftime
19 when trailing at the half bitches
for the past few weeks ive silently been thinking that all this adversity the teams had between the chiefs game the steelers game and lamars subpar play even in our losses has been to expose us to adversity that we didnt really face last year when we won we won by a shit ton last year and so when we were down we didnt know what to do

but this year weve gotten a lot of reps in close games or games where were down early and i feel like this game was the first time where we handled that adversity with a ton of poise and prowess lamar threw us out of a deficit thats been his achilles heel since he was drafted and he came out and hung dong in the second half today against an elite defense no less i think that bodes really really well for us the team that wins the super bowl is never the one that dominates the most its the one who knows how to win tough games the most
bugs bunny mustve gave the halftime speech
lamar is back baby ravens in 4
i hope this lamar never leaves us again
we came from behind after halftime
any word on campbell
colts fan coming in peace gg yall played great and we just couldnt do anything on offense huge fan of lamar and hope he gets better as the season goes on rooting for yall if the colts cant make it to the playoffs gg and fuck the steelers
first time not being in a game thread during the game and i feel so much better than most sundays
everybody turn on the steelers game steelers getting fucked
edit actually never mind they woke up
what a big win against an afc opponent
gutsy win i love it great bounce back from last week the defence put their stamp on this win kept us in the game with two of their best starters out allowing the offence to get in their rhythm they stuck in there and made some great plays held the colts to 0 pts in the second half our offence and lamar specifically do deserve credit for bringing us back and making second half adjustments lamar played better this week which was encouraging to see especially against a great defence they got into a rhythm and tightened things up proud to see them bring us back

also credit to harbaugh for having the gall to challenge the potential peters int and to roman for changing things up in the second half big challenge in ne on sunday night next week
offense had 2019 vibes awesome adjustments after the half
even if they win pitt is getting exposed rn we shouldve won that game
the ravens have scored 21 points against the colts marking their 31st straight game with 20 points

that streak is a new nfl record one more game than the 20122014 broncos nflresearch
another cool stat from this game

lamar jackson has tied former dolphins quarterback dan marino for the best start 255 by a quarterback to begin his career
steelers are one of the worst 80 teams in recent history change my mind that shit is fucking true
was phillip rivers really just stat padding pathetic
congratulations to you guys love seeing you win
mp juiceman op
defense was so good today also we were overdue a biased game from the refs
john harbaugh right now in his post game presser says its a calf strain for calais campbell and its nothing serious staceydales
todays halftime adjust will be the turning point of the season if the ravens eventually win the super bowl in february thats the type of adjustment you hope for when nothings going right in the first half the ravens were a completely different team after the half and the offense was in complete control against a very good defense

kudos to the john harbaugh and the rest of the coaching staff
wheres the people saying lamar shouldnt be extended fuck off the sub bro with that shit that man has worked his ass off from the jump
lamar jackson just earned his 1st career win after trailing at halftime previously 06 incl playoffs

its the ravens 1st win after trailing at the half since wk 10 2016 ending a streak of 20 straight losses incl playoffs that was the longest active streak in the nfl nflresearch
strong second half after a 1st half where we didnt deserve to win
oline is an issue but we schemed around it better in the 2nd half that said way too many tfl even on dives up the middle
internet hugs 4 all love u guys
we beat indy at home for the first time and broke our no comeback from half streak today was a good day
thats a good defense and lamar seemed to gain some confidence in the 2nd looks looked good passing and when to run
it was a great second half comeback a comeback lamar needed in his career

the injuries were killers though nothing can be done about them but damn hope cambell and queen are ok
colts d is no joke that second half performance is a solid foundation to build on
today ljera8 tied hall of famer dan marino for the most victories 25 in a qbs first 30 regular season starts pmgleason
was just wondering why dez bryant wasnt in at all while we were in the redzone which is why i assume we brought him in for
the steelers are losing to the cowboys hahaha
the offense looked so much better in the 2nd half it gives me some hope going forward that we could be getting better
i think were back dominant second half performance after being down against a decent defense
can we get more plays like in the 3rd quarter our receivers running slants and drags instead of the usual hooks and out routes every play
the fact that i wasnt predicting plays before the snap in the second half is probably a good sign and they should keep doing that
really thought rivers was gonna pick apart bonds like he did jimmy smith in his rookie year but wink made some adjustments and the defense played lights out no marlon no calais no problem lets get them back though big win yall
phillip rivers is an even bigger sore loser than trump
great win but seriously need to clean up the penalties

we looked dominant as fuck the second half lets take that energy into the rest of the szn
i really hope the coaching staff is gonna rewatch second half three times this week thats how the playcalling should be done second half was amazing both on offense as well as defense
ravens came back better than biden did with the mailin ballots lmao
im very happy with this win idk if we could go beat the chiefs or the steelers but were definitely building back up to that point and this game is a huge step in that direction
so is this a big game

i have to admit i was shitting all over this team at the half rightfully so but the way we came back honestly means more to me than how we would just steamroll other teams

we stopped the streak of being losing 20 straight when being down at the half for me that makes me excited

i will still say that roman needs to go after this year but wtf happened with the play calling its like we literally moved the ball at will and looked like the same team we were last year despite being down our franchise lt
22 straight losses when losing by halftime that is absolutely ridiculous im hoping our franchise takes from this game and never gives up when were behind and and learns to make halftime adjustments im not saying were now back in the mix to be contenders because its just 1 game but it sure as hell will if we keep playing like this on both sides of the ball
i think this was a very important win especially defeating the cant come back from behind if down after halftime curse i am excited for next week
ben hurt
such a bail out call for pit against dallas on that roughing the passer
looks like the cowboys are getting a dose of ref ball to hand the sqealers another win
its remarkable how teams trip over themselves when trying to play the steelers including us
that 4th and 3 dobbins conversion felt like a turning point for the season just like the lamar 4th down td vs seattle last season
lamar jackson hit a lb so hard he ended up crying like a bitch i love it also lamar hit two defenders at the same time dude is a beast
mmmmmm 62 baby colts have a great defense great second half to turn it up
dont know what they eat a half but please keep feeding them what an atrocious first half
glad to see the coaching staff adjust at halftime and come out strong if not for the gus fumble the score couldve been more the defense did a great job too and didnt really let up much after that first quarter im still shaky on the offense cuz it is a 60 minute game and you cant beat the chiefs or steelers in the playoffs when your offense sucks half the game but i definitely saw steps in the right direction
that game reminded me of the second browns game of last season what a turnaround

hell yes
tale of 2 halves first half we played like garbage second half offense woke up and the defense limited them to 1 yard in the 3rd quarter still a lot of room for improvement but i see us as a 1012 win team this year
didnt see the game today howd lamar look based on the stat line looks like mostly short passes
top 3 game in the lamar jacksonera

staying elite vs being an outsider to make the playoffs in an extremely strong afc
maybe a start of a trend where we can come back when trailing lamar played well after halftime
the ravens narrowly extended their streak of 100 yard rushing games finishing with 110 yards ravens4dummies
can we just start playing at a high pace and tempo from the start lamar obviously does not play well at a slow pace
i think the colts like screen passes
can we stop looking like crap in the first half this team has so much damn talent but every week it seems like they come out flat
i really dont know what changed at half but we looked like last years team out there
wtf happened at halftime
i couldnt watch today because i was working how did dez look
kinda sad dez didnt get a catch ngl
only complaint is we didnt get to see dez
mvp 2nd half adjustments
did yannick even play today i dont see his name in the box score
we did not play that well but the colts have a good defence and sometimes you just gotta win
hopefully this is the game that break the training curse
the colts post game thread is hilarious they complain that the refs gave us the game because of the peters int which admittedly is a questionable call at best and the hit on boyle which was 100 clean there was no helmet to helmet contact as if the refs didnt miss a dozen block in back calls on all their screen plays
i felt today when we were behind we played like we were behind by the score we were behind before this it feels like if we go behind by 3 the team and the play calling acts like were down by 30 i hope this is the turning point we need for this
man i wasnt able to watch the game yesterday but i checked in on the game thread a couple of times and by the way this sub was melting down you would think we were down 60 points
that second half performance had flashes of last seasons dominance i would like to see more of that
this is how good we couldve been previous weeks if refs didnt penalise us every 2 seconds finally managed to play a clean game and shows what we can really do
wtf adjustment got made at half for real did they just full on have somebody else call plays did lamar just ask to do his thing
i hate myself for not having and truss sorry guys
guys i feel good

the defense looked pretty hot all game the offense really came alive in the second half most importantly we played from behind and won this could mark some big growth for this team feels real good
lamar doing what he does best in the second half really helped
honest discussion what did you guys think about the peters int
what a fun second half the ravens are back
great defensive and offensive game the 1st half was messy but the adjustments made won us this game huge congrats to lamar on his completion rate 1923 the oline stepped up in the 2nd half and let lamar be shifty and extend the defense pass game looked good in the second half oddly dont be put off by jks statistically dismal game as he made a few drives remember this colts team is the number 2 rushing defense in the nfl thats about it mostly covering the bright spots
thank the heavens roman harbaugh made a halftime adjustment for our offense if we continue to evolveadjust and let lamar cook my heart will be so much less stressed
how to fix the ravens offense four nohuddle snaps
im most impressed with the way our team bounced back in the second half hallmark of a good team fr
i wonder if this will count as a big game lol
the defense definitely needed a bounce back effort like that jackson also coming out of the game clean on turnovers is also good
quick question pff has patrick queen with a 322 grade this season has he actually been that bad
this is the exact win that this team needed but hasnt gotten in the lamar era after watching this team deflate when they couldnt get their game going its really great to see them adjust rise to the challenge and ultimately win granted the colts have a philip rivers problem but this is still the signature win of the season right now against an excellent defense
our ol really needs help

embarrassing seeing the cowbos running over the steelers even with backup linemen and we struggle so much
still have a lot of concerns about this team

1 the ol isnt consistently good enough which is understandable given stanley and yanda being gone

2 lamar has dramatically regressed as a passer particularly on deep balls which they dont even attempt anymore

3 teams have had a year to study film and that coupled with the ineffective passing game makes it harder to run

not sure any of this is fixable but they can probably scheme around it for a while
we need to use boykin more im not convinced claypool is any better than boykin but he draws a flag on what feels like 50 of his targets boykin could command the same treatment if hes vocal enough with the refs
raven games arent very fun to watch nowadays
this game felt like a litmus test for both teams which one is in the 2nd tier of afc teams along with buffalo tennessee and which is in the third tier oakland cleveland

ravens despite a terrible start were clearly the better team i think were firmly a wildcard team and should probably be the 5th seed just need to hope to get hot come that time
gg boys this win was hard earned especially with all the injuries and lack of humphrey
fuck the colts fuck the irsays baltimore forever
the indianapolis professional football franchise

the only colts i know are the baltimore colts
fuck bob irsay
idpft

fuck the irsays
the colts true home is in baltimore

the franchise that plays in indianapolis is a cruel mockery of the baltimore colts that johnny unitas and raymond berry played for

i have nothing against the city of indianapolis or football fans who live in that area but they should have adopted their own names and colors and built their own history it might have been different if no one seemed to care in baltimore and the retention of the name and colors was an attempt to preserve history rather than steal it but baltimore always cared baltimore still cares

i still remember the loud standing ovations the baltimore colts marching band would get at cfl games in baltimore in 1994 and 1995 more than a decade after the irsays stole our team that cfl team tried to use the name colts the first year and predictably got sued but every time the pa announcer said baltimore cfl which was technically the team name the first year because of the legal injunction they were renamed the stallions in their second year when announcing the yardage gained on a play or something 40000 people at a cfl game mind you would shout colts those were the second loudest cheers of the night
was pleasantly surprised they called out indy for stealing our history in the pre game show
16 in indy with losses to andrew luck peyton manning and jim harbaugh harbaugh was actually ray lewis first career sack
thats actually pretty fuckjng crazy
and a the 1st of 20 games winning when down from half
after all these years their ownership still sucks
i always peep the other teams sub never post on gameday it was seriously fucking gross to see how many people have baltimore colts flairs over there fuck them forever

this weeks nominees are
wink martindale

no marlo no calais campbell no fort 10 points allowed on the road
john harbaugh

half time adjustments changed everything and the challenge was huge
marcus peters
mp juiceman

1 int 1 ff both led to 14 points
me

in the first half i wore a gray ravens shirt under my customary willis mcgahee jersey but during halftime i switched to a white ravens shirt under so as to match the white jersey tops the team is wearing today hoping that this display of solidarity would inspire the team to turn it around in the second half

safe to say it worked

fr tho chuck clark
dez emotional support wideout bryant
marcus juiceman peters for his gamechanging forced fumble that led to chuck clarks td return and interception that nullified gus edwards fumble in the red zone to start the 3rd quarter with marlon humphrey out peters picked up the honors as baltimores defensive mvp

additionally credit goes to john harbaugh for whatever he didsaid at halftime that sparked a complete turnaround for the team in the second half that was a totally different ravens team out there after the break
coaching
with their halftime adjustments
halftime or whatever happened during halftime
harbs

that challenge was huge not the best start but credit to him to get everyone going in the second half

also big shout out for snapping a 20 game streak of losing when trailing at ht
marcus peters for the forced fumble interception and being the only corner keeping rivers from eviscerating this secondary like the doom slayer tears through demons
defense

not only did the defense hold the colts to 10 points against an offense averaging over 30 points a game but they allowed lamar to get back to his comfort zone and completely flip the second half

also fumble recovery for a touchdown and a huge interception
wink martindale to hold the colts down with so many players rotating in and out with injuries the covid stuff this week and a poor offensive showing in the first half is very impressive
lamar jackson

this year when things havent gone well his body language noticeably drops but today he came out in the second half and absolutely turned the game on its head

honorable mention to mp juiceman
marcus peters ballhawkjuiceman extraordinaire
gritty

because without his chaotic manifestation of philly energy this win wouldnt feel as good
halftime speech giver
greg roman

sike

mp juiceman
my dad he left after the first half and we started winning
greg roman fight me
marcus peters forced fumble and an interception both came at important times in the game and kept us in it
me i stayed off reddit after halftime
wink martindale


amazing game he called despite the shit he had to deal with
half time adjustments whoever made them you the mvp
lj was great in the 2nd half but no question player of the game was marcus peters had himself one hell of game forced fumble that led to a td int to turn the tide after offense turned it over and did well in coverage
lamar jackson
tempo
juiceman
marcus peters would be my choice

but the 2nd half adjustments were dynamite felt like a totally different team out there playing in the 2nd half

lamar looked very sharp all day threw the quick pass on blitzes so hes working his way back to his norm
marcus peters 2 big turnovers
pick 6 shawty
entire coaching staff not only great adjustments in the 2nd half yes including greg roman but a great job getting these guys prepared during a week where 6 starters were unable to practice
my fianc and my daughter they were visiting my mother in law and came back at halftime when i was obviously upset with the way our offence was playing and then our offence handled business in the 2nd half
entire team in 2nd half
lamar jackson finally showed he can turn a game were losing around and win it
wink

2nd half lamar deserves a shoutout tremendous resolve
john harbaugh his halftime speech adjustments and gutsy challenge changed the momentum of the game
coaching staff

first time ive ever seen roman actually make a mid game adjustment that really paid off first 2nd half comeback for the ravens in over 3 years


lets fucking go
the entire coaching staff nothing was working im the first half and they came out im the second and absolutely dominated and made great calls
marcus peters and lamar jackson
coach harbaugh with that challenge and getting the team to turn it around after the half also shout out to marcus peters feel like before he got here would hear bad things about his character or how he is undisciplined but hes stepped up to be a true leader after that dirty hit on lamar early on he stepped up and got into it with the colts you always gotta respect the guys that will always step up for their team
defense

they played extremely well considering that most of them were on the covid list up until yesterday
coaching from wink dealing with covid and injury on the defense to the half time adjustments in playcalling
wink
mp the juice man
coachingadjustments team looked great today in the second half defense balled out all game though as usual
dez
mark andrews for that block on the jackson td

but really peters and jackson
coaching staff

no idea who in particular but just the coaches in general biggest problem with this team and this staff is far and away lack of adjustments when we lose we continue to lose in the same fashion its the reason we had 20 straight losses when losing at halftime we havent seen the adjustments we saw today we got the that first win after being down at half this team can do it now its a possibility defense was getting used up and they kept the colts to 1 yard in the 3rd quarter offense was getting absolutely nothing done and they started the 3rd quarter with 2 extremely efficient drives one of which led to a td and the other should have been a td if not for gus fumble the changes were seen immediately and they were successful immediately this is what a good team is supposed to do when theyre up against the ropes

im hoping this is a turning point in the season i was hoping the losses against kc and steelers would be turning points but i think this could be it this is where we could realize what needs to be done to win
mp juiceman

also look at most of the player if the games this season so far ravens defense is back
llama
his play in the second half was the catalyst for the offense and he looked like the mvp we have all loved
peters is a very good shout though
lamar
13 straight completions in the second half
marcus peters forced fumble and an interception that resulted in 14 points
the whole defense we were lucky to only be down 3 at half defense kept us in it and then got the 2nd half shutout they were awesome
harbaugh for righting the ship
wink

there is no other answer best dc in the game
second half coaching
defense fumble returned for a td and holding the colts to literally 1 yard in q3 its gotta be them
marcus peters
harbaugh good adjustments at halftime
marcus peters
marcus peters

x200b

honorable mentions patrick queen chuck clark deshon elliott gus bus jk dobbins lamar
the coaches despite how poorly things started they made incredible halftime adjustments and dominated the second half
coaching staff the defensive gameplan was solid and the halftime adjustments made to the offense were a thing of beauty
wherever gave the halftime speech
im saying play calling finally fucking stuck with a high tempo run based offense that were best at instead of making lamar throw for 60 times a game
marcus peters
chuck clark
marcus peters

that int changed the entire atmosphere
someone predicted that marcus peters would go off and have an interception and a forced fumble who was it
marcus peters he really put the secondary on his back
defense holding any team to 10 points is a major win shout out to halftime speech that put in work
yall know him as marcus peters but i know him as m p juiceman
unless greg roman wasnt calling then greg roman for turning it around that half we looked like a completely new team
wink called a good game but peters held it tf down
uhm marcus peters idk everyone lol kinda a spread out team win

i guess winkdown 2 of our best players and everyone still balled out
whoever told the boys to get their shit together at halftime
john harbaughs mr magoo challenge
its peters but judon also had a great game
coaches they turned the team around in the locker room at halftime
the coaching staff

we were down our star defensive players including calais and marlon

john harbaugh made some halftime adjustments wink martindale was able to still make the defense competitive and greg roman was able to incorporate a healthy amount of passing while still staying true to the run
dez bryant

for using his weird catch rule voodoo magic to give us the game turning pick
i dont think lamar was necessarily the player of the game but he def deserves some credit
marcus peters gave us key turnovers
juice
peters
going with john harbaugh i would also second the team there were some change ups and some unexpected injuries we had to deal with come game time the defense held tight while our offense got in rhythm and our coaching made adjustments from what indy was throwing at us

indy is a good team and they clearly did their homework against us
week 9 jk dobbins he had a monstrous game and showed up gus by comparison so extremely explosive
marcus peters no doubt dude forced a key fumble when our o was drunk and he had an int
marcus peters thank you so much
whole defense except bonds
juiceman marcus peters really stepped up with humphrey out today
harbs halftime speech
marcus peters
marcus peters
marcus peters

removed
in the second half we came back and shut them down
first 2nd half comeback win for lamar
im honestly pretty hopeful coming out of this game coaching staff on both sides made significant changes and adjustments which led to us just rolling 2nd half rivers is shit but that recovery by the defense was just amazing lets hope this can carry on and we can improve tho cuz we can afford to play like shit for a half vs a team like the colts but its not really an option vs a better team or in the playoffs we just gotta start putting together more complete games
i really get like we just needed to survive this week and we not only survived but we strung together a dominant half of football against a 52 team

we won but at what cost

then again still not all positive these fucking injuries gonna give me heart attack
second half offense was looking like last year first real sustained offense since probably week 1 this year plus it was against a good defense

somewhere dan marino is posing razor blades over this
you would never think that if you looked at our sub the last week and a half you ungrateful sons of bitches
damn that steelersloss last week hurts could have been 264 but we had to throw that one away
and hes also tied dan marino for sb wins hopefully thatll change
today ljera8 tied hall of famer dan marino for the most victories 25 in a qbs first 30 regular season starts

fuck off with those marino comparisons as someone from the miami area i dont want lamar in the same sentence as a ringless loser might be contagious

did you not see his last sportsball video he made it pretty damn clear hes in yinzer mode going forward
meh he still makes good weekly recap vids and has some decent insights

at least he isnt like that annoying sperglord eagles fan that yells and wipes his ass with jerseys constantly
i dont go on twitter because its cancer but he does have a few yikes takes on there
this offense is not the explosive force that it was last year even though expectations were high to repeat why is it wrong to point this out
i prefer chiseled adonis though hes also a squealer
i dont get this did he not watch the game

we were literally playing on all cylinders today

it was about this time last year that lamar started looking like an mvp candidate and he looked that way in todays second half last year lamar had a great season opener against the dolphins then was pretty lackluster until mid season where a switch seemed to be flipped this is looking awfully familiar hopefully history repeats itself until the playoffs that is
ive said it before and ill say it againthis offense will only go as far as roman lets it lamar showed us hes capable of leading a downfield attack from the pocket along with doing some scrambling and running if roman has better designed pass plays that get the ball out to guys in space and gets people open that frees up the rbs and lamar to run if roman decides to revert to first half roman we are fucked
were gonna play some bad defenses over the final 8 games too tenn dallas nyg jacksonville bengals and browns

411 rushing yards 2 tds 6 f 3 fl

x200b

hes playing worse this year theres no way around it he has 7 turnovers to 5 through 7 games and almost 500 less all purpose yards and 2 of his ints in the pit game last season should have been overturned one was bc of blatant pi the other was not a catch

x200b

that being said the playcalling and offensive line are the biggest problems on offense roman needs to stick to the basics and our line needs to step up

both looked fine on the sideline am i missing something neither looked serious
i think calais is fine but calves can linger so thoughts and prayers
i mean i dont have anything against them besides annoying fans and i wouldnt mind seeing them succeed if it means an embarrassing loss for pittsburgh
their defense just held on for a punt and now we see the offense actually moving the ball
praying that the cowboys find a way to upset the steelers
lets go dallas
agreed this is the upset weve all been waiting for
lmfaoo this is literally me the defense is looking pretty good today surprisingly


the fact we havent lost a road game since the kc game last year is absolutely crazy some teams would kill to even go 30 on the road in a season but to be 100 in the span of almost 2 full seasons is ridiculous
that stat about our winless streak when trailing at the half is absolutely mind blowing to me im glad we could snap it
10 straight road games is insane

we looked solid without him excited about the depth on d
thank goodness we looked solid without him but hes a monster on the line
he seemed in decent spirits didnt look like he thought his season just ended or anything
thank god
madbuike looked good i thought in his place although definitely not nearly as good
he said the same thing about ingram but i could see the staff being generally cautious about injuries since were genuinely playing for january
well be needing him for henry next week
honestly i never trust harbaugh when talking about injuries he always down plays them he said ingrams injury was serious and he didnt play he always down plays it
i dont trust harbaugh at all when it comes to injury stuff


everybody in that team has everybodys back thats why they win extraordinary talent minus the ego

username does not check out i love this
badsportsart more like the greatestsportsart
so now i have to turn this into a photo as well like last time
my new wallpaper
hardest i have ever laughed i legit couldnt breath
dude the best is how he tries to kind of grab clark and when clark hops over him he just flattens his arms and legs out like a starfish lol
so awful yet a masterpiece
rivers tackling style is very elamesque
i love it
just looked comfortable and in command the entire half made all the throws and was poised he ran it when he needed to i cant stress this enough i was really impressed especially against a rock solid defense hope this can continue in the back half of the year
very true no pass tds but he was looking accurate af and was handling those botched snaps like a fucking champ

ive only seen tom brady handle botched snaps so well
the second half looked like all of last season downhill running clutch passes mixed in and a very very tired defense looking defeated
his throws outside the numbers were the most impressive to me he was zipping them out there and hitting guys in stride and i really believe part of the reason things opened up so much for us was because darius leonard began dropping into coverage more to respect that threat
we leaned pass heavy and it looked great
the first half i was full of dread on every play the second half i was actually confident it was a whole other mood on that field
this is why i get so annoyed with people saying he regressed obviously hes not been playing well but he did not regress

hope he can keep it up from here on out
really took a step forward but im not convinced how many times this season have we seen flashes of good play then back to the usual bullshit this was a much more sustained dose of good play its a start and i hope it carries through
lamar seems to get distracted when the play calls are bad he gets antsy and tends to panic a bit switch the calls to running and short passes and he does much better
we looked like ourselves in the 2nd half the boys were having fun and clicking it was good to see that again weve got the talent and the heart we just need to starting playing the confidence we had in the second half of this game also how did we lose to the steelers when the cowboys nearly beat them today
it helps that play calls were adjusted too i want lamar to run less so that the hits dont pile up on him he shouldnt run more than 10 times a game

ironically we traded with the cardinals to draft him lol
he was on my madden mobile team when i was in 7th grade
hes still a solid te shouldnt be suprised that hes in the league
oh the hype when we drafted him i remember this sub trying to come up with a nickname for him all offseason long hahaha
2015 is only 5 years ago
i know he did practically nothing today i saw him block for a single snap but i couldnt tell if he played any other snaps
i think it was just that 1 snap
saw the whole game played one snap on a run play wanted to see more but think they are trying to get him up to speed and maybe just a back up incase someone goes down

wait till it goes final anyone can have a good half of football
removed

im praying for a miracle here lol
if dallas can beat them somehow ill be happy af but also even more annoyed we couldnt
too early right now ive been fooled once
ill delete this post if they loose
i hope they both lose because im a eagles and ravens fan

and he outperformed my fantasy te
i think this is his first week after being injured all season great start maxx
removed
he did not call any plays lol
source
where did you hear this
harbaugh has never called plays in his life
so first yall said it was urban and now harbaugh where are these rumours coming from seems like wishful thinking
why would you even post this embarrassing
needs a bullshit tag not a news tag
all right all right i will come clean

early halftime i got a call from bisciotti he said we were in trouble would i help a bro out

so yeah it was me
did you literally just make this up
mods do you not censor anything here
op just wants our streak of 20 point games to end this is false flag bullshit
omg they gave me hope
im so hyped fts
their fucking worthless kicker missed another extra point lol
gilbert grape
dont do that dont give me hope
please let this be real

why do we hate the cowboys again i honestly dont care about them at all

sure looks like the ravens took another snap with 10 men on the field q1 456

they had 2 in 1200 snaps last year this would be their 2nd in
520 definitely seemed to have trouble with substitutions on both sides this week ill blame the zoom meetings

bro why
on a scale of 1 to 10 how much of an emotional rollercoaster did i miss
take a guess
all our game threads are a 10 unless we win 490 or something
it was ridiculous the 1st half was just people calling for romans head the second half was the complete opposite

on a scale of 110 it was a 9
youre not missing out those game threads arent healthy at all sometimes
gro got fired and hired multiple times
yes
the normal fire gro but had some sprinkles of not sure lamar is the guy
deep dive followed by a slow but increasing rise up
smart guy after living in the steelers game thread last week ive come to realize game threads actually worsen the game day experience for me
exhibit a the ravens play like absolute shit and come this close to winning

exhibit b their performance against the cowboys so far

change my mind
how the hell did we lose to this team
steelers are crafty and figure out a way and always capitalize like rats got to rise above the rats
its obvious the steelers are not the best team theyre not even close they have a good defense but their offense is honestly not good they needed short fields and turnovers to score on us and theyre struggling vs the cowgirls who have a putrid defense im seriously looking forward to this thanksgiving rematch
wouldnt say they are garbage but not remotely close to as good as their record says they are a 106 caliber team taking advantage of an easy schedule 124 is my prediction for them this season
the worst part is that the steelers have an incredibly easy schedule now and the only difficult game for them other than us on thanksgiving is gonna be the bills unfortunately if they dont play down to competition its not likely that we win the division this time around unless we win out from this point and the steelers lose to us and the bills
shouldnt there have been a 10 sec run off at the end of the half bc the false start
i turned the game on for one play just now and they scored a td so off i go back to not watching football
removed

these kinds of posts are dumb

and it was an interception you want simpler catch rules well there you go
i have no idea how that was called an interception the rest of it probably could have gone either way and isnt going to make us think twice because we got screwed on some of those judgement calls last week
interception was dumb apparently thats the rule but logically it didnt make sense

i dont think the hit on doyle was targeting there was no lowering of the helmet and the point of contact was across the shoulder

andrews wasnt holding at all lol that was a textbook block
im going to be as honest as possible the interception was something ive never seen before was it a heads up play to recover the ball after peters lost it yes was it an interception i really dont think so the helmet to helmet is bang bang refs could throw a flag or not lastly holding can be called on every single play i think its a bullsht call 99 of the time
that block was beautiful he drove him to the endzone pick coulda gone either way marcus peters was holding that ball for a while the doyle play is just football kinda similar play happened to snead last week no call also what a dumb post we r ravens fans what do u think we r gonna say
1 it doesnt matter what anyone thinks subjectively about the catch rule in regards to the peters interception by rule it was definitely a pick
2 it was definitely not a flag a shouldertoshoulder hit isnt unnecessary roughness
3 no andrews definitely didnt deserve a flag some amount of grabbing is present on every single block in the nfl its only holding if theres obvious change in direction
worst 70 team of all time dont me
no one should be surprised to see the steelers underperforming against a bad team
ben is limping into halftime

bruh
dez bryant has a 100 win record as an active player since injury
lmaoo
big facts
sam koch is also the most efficient passer in nfl history
this do be facts
this is exaclty why you have to actually read the articles and not just headlines lol
i was pretty drunk during the game did he get many targets or yards
you know theyve never lost a game with me on the active roster either
look at the deeetail
im throwing it up
its not not true
treat him right great person not sure how much he has left

good luck to you all
love it so happy for dez rooting for you guys the rest of the way
well yeah but neither have 30 other teams
as a cowboys fan justdont

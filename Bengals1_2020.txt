You guys think he can beat out Ryan Finley?

Are you sure he is not trying to crap into that trash can?

Failed physical is interesting. He was participating in practice before the Bengals released him right?
"Wasn't this the guy that looked really good in preseason last year, then they rostered him and he did nothing?"
Bummer.  Guy flashed last season when he got the opportunity.
ok?
[removed]
"Would you guys like signing Leonard Fournette if we can get him for $3mil-$4mil a year for 2-3 years? Mixon and Fournette in the same RB room seems amazing, to me at least."
"We‚Äôre trying to re-sign Mixon, and we already have Gio making $4.8 mil each of the next two years. Im definitely not a fan of putting any more money into RBs."
He wouldn't want to be a backup or the #2 guy. Wouldn't work despite how nice it sounds
"I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd want to share a rb 

But eh idk how I‚Äôd feel about it"
"If the browns can have Chubb and Kareem hunt, why can't we have mixon and fournette."
"I would not would rather save that money to resign either WJ3 Joe AJ or get an improvement on the o line. 

I will be interested to see if the media tries to crest a story if Trevor Lawrence wouldn‚Äôt want to play for a train wreck of a franchise like Jacksonville with how they did us with Joe. How many players have wanted out of there? I can count Jalen Ngakwe and Fournette. They have also had a terrible history recently drafting."
"I think it‚Äôs pretty telling no other teams were willing to give up even a conditional 7th for him. 

He seems to be the opposite of the leadership, locker room guys Zac Taylor & friends have been targeting. I could be wrong because I spend exactly 0.5 seconds per year following the Jacksonville Jaguars. 

Also, with Mixon looking food an extension, I doubt he‚Äôd be thrilled sharing carries with Fournette."
"No. 

Next?"
"He‚Äôs good, but not worth the headache. Mixon is a stud. And a team leader. Who also wants to be paid. No need to further clutter that backfield."
"Not worth that. Especially not on a team with a young/poor O-line. The guy doesn't create on his own (look at his YPC) or have a nose for the endzone. Better fantasy asset than real-life asset I think.

*drafts him anyway*"
If Mixon can't go week 1 - Can Gio hold the fort?
Not a big fan of Fournette. He's not any better than replacement level IMO.
"Honestly he kinda sucks, not that interested in him."
"If we get enough comments, I'll create a league and begin inviting you."
"Sure thing, would be a lot of fun."
Hell yeah
"I‚Äôm game, if you guys leave me Burrow"
I'm in.
"We‚Äôve had a large number of comments. I‚Äôd love to do multiple leagues and make it an annual event. 

I believe we will need more commissioners than just myself to keep things straight in the other leagues. 

I‚Äôm open to suggestions and would really love the input of everyone to make this work and as seamless as possible.  

Edit: I‚Äôd like to have as many leagues as we can fill. Depending on how many that is, I‚Äôd like to carry over the leaders of each league into a new tier 1 winners league the following year. 

Do we need some sort of incentive to keep this interactive and engaging? I want it to be fun for us and a topic of discussion, not just another fantasy league."

"Good to hear it's not contract related, so people can stop speculation about that. That said, it's migraines, so that's unpredictable. Fingers crossed."
Big big year for Mixon.
:D
"Honestly, I don't even think he has migraines. It's contract related. If we're going to give him a huge chunk of money, and they're nearing a deal, why risk him getting hurt in practice before signing on the dotted line? The fact that he was at the scrimmage is an even better sign. It was like a ""Hey guys, I'm still in this with you, I'll be here, just dealing with this stuff."" Good kid. Love Joe Mixon."
"*For the Chargers, in a huge twist no one saw coming."

"The migraines aren‚Äôt legit. That‚Äôs something you see a pattern of, and there are no previous reports.

"@SeanMaffia @iamffrapper All claims get processed at 4. So unless the Bengals claim him, nobody knows for sure if they got him until then.

"These numbers would be horrendous and likely put us close to getting the #1 pick next year.

Thoughts??"
He's a rookie quarterback coming off an extremely shortened off-season. It's definitely in the realm of possibility
"Love Burrow. Agree with the analysis from a fantasy perspective. Snatch him late and hope, guys that homer too hard are the ones that lose (looking at my browns friends)"
"I'm a burrow believer. It's hard not to be. We gotta be honest, we had the number one pick this year for a lot more reason than just subpar QB play. I think we win anywhere from 4-6 games if I'm honest and as long as Burrow shows some flashes that's okay with me. This is the first real year of a rebuild which could take 2-3 years to start paying dividends."
"Okay 3400 yards is possible, but 20 interceptions... I would be shocked. Daniel Jones only threw 12. Burrow is not throwing 20."
If fantasy football projections were always right everyone would win.

I love that he and Tee are both huge AJ fans. Must be so cool to even practice alongside someone you looked up to as a kid

Hell yes. Now let‚Äôs get to work.
FUCK YES
"Let's go, down for anybody that is gonna ride with us!"
Basically his contract is now at 5 years 50 mil or 10 per year which sounds a lot nicer.  Paying 10 mil a year for your stud RB is fantastic.

Ladies and gentleman. We got him.
LEEEETSS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO

When was the last time we extended our number 1 back? I think it's been since Rudi Johnson maybe.
"Bengals and RB Joe Mixon reached agreement on a four-year contract extension that ties him to Cincinnati for five more seasons, per source. Still going over language to finalize deal.

"Bengals have been making all the right moves, this offense could be something special."

Just tell me if we're truly and honestly going to have a good offensive line.
"Love keeping mixon. Don‚Äôt love the amount of money given (would like a deal closer to 8 million a year)

Thankfully burrow is on a rookie deal and that helps. Just hope our offensive line helps us out this year 

I‚Äôll probably be downvoted for this lol"

Happy to keep him and always happy to see a guy get paid
This appears and feels like a big win. I‚Äôm so happy this was figured out before Week 1!
"He brings so much more to our team than just rushing yards. He is a leader, this contract is well deserved. I'll always remember him running down AJ in the end zone when he was injured to celebrate, he's just that dude."
"Was hoping for around 10 but we have the money to spend and we should absolutely have kept him here in his prime, so a win no matter what."
"Since making that horrible mistake his freshman year of college, he has really turned his life around and become a model NFL player. Great teammate, stays healthy, plays hard, plays well, seems to enjoy his life. I‚Äôm so happy for him to get his pay day. He earned it. Now let‚Äôs go fucking win a mother fucking Super Bowl."
What will happen with AJ....
absolutely
YES
I‚Äôm excited for him but also worried because running backs never seem to be worth their deals. They have a short shelf life. It‚Äôs the unfortunate truth. Well see how we feel about this in 4 years
Yes yes yes
Yes
Absolutely! So excited about the future of this franchise. I just hope this off season is the new normal. This young man is great for the Bengals!
Happy we extended him. Looking forward to seeing the details of the contract before I decide if it was a good deal or not.
EVERYBODY WINS!
It's a great deal and friendly
I need a new pair of pants

FUCK YES AND FUCK THE STEELERS! It's the Joe and Joe show in the jungle now. WHO TO THE FUCKIJG DEY!
Without a doubt this was a great deal. Factor in his current year and we are getting him for basically 5 years 50 million.
"We get even an average O-line there‚Äôs no telling how great this kid can be.

He‚Äôs been good playing behind garbage the past couple of years,"
"I‚Äôm not a fan of overpaying running backs but Mixon earned that money. He got exactly what he deserved so I wouldn‚Äôt call him overpaid, but I‚Äôd prefer to pay for a top 10 DB or LB over RB. I get that this situation is opportunistic and you have to take Mixon for that price. He‚Äôs a great player."
"It's more than I expected, but I don't think it's an overpay."
"He is worth exactly $48 mil for 4 years, cuz that's what he signed for... Hell Yes he is worth it. Can't wait to see him get 1,400 yards this year!"
Really shocked me as a lifelong (31 years) Bengals fan to see our front office FINALLY show the willingness to be ACTIVE and FOCUSED ON WINNING!  The only criticism I have is not directly addressing the offensive line (but this may end up not being as big of a weakness with the addition of Jonah and the maturation of some younger pieces).  I hope this is truly the start of a new era!  WHO DEY!!!!
"There‚Äôs only so much you can do, I feel they went above and beyond this year. Change what you can and do your best to chip away at the rest... as long as they keep chipping away, I‚Äôm happy."
I don‚Äôt expect us to be super bowl contenders this year... but maybe one or 2 more offseason we can be
"Best off season in Bengals history, and it isn't even close."
2020 is fucking wild
"In a good position to only have to address O-line and Corner in the draft, hopefully retain William Jackson."

I‚Äôm here because the baseball season ended two days ago and I‚Äôm ready for Foooootball

Who won this trade?
"I mean you might get a lot of love here considering where you are posting this but I think you lost out on this one by a fairly decent margin. 

Chark was a top 10 WR all of last year till he got hurt. Now with Fournette gone and the terrible defense they are to going have, his opportunities are only going to increase. Chark played one less game than Boyd and still finished ahead of Boyd by 8 spots in half ppr (Chark ranked 14th, Boyd ranked 22nd).

For Boyd, as much as I like him, last year was truly his time to take over a WR1 type roll and the results were kind of meh overall. With the addition of AJ back into the lineup, Higgins threatening to take some targets, and then Ross/Tate getting into the mix I don't see how Boyd has a clear shot of improving on last years numbers and if anything his numbers will more than likely be worst this year. Could Burrow be a bump up from Andy? Maybe. Or maybe it takes Burrow some time to adjust with no preseason giving Boyd an even slower start out the gate.

Overall I am not a fan of this trade at all."
"Even if you like Boyd better, Chark is going like 20 picks ahead of Boyd based on ADP. You should have gotten Boyd + something instead of just Boyd.

Edit: said Chark at the end, made no sense"
"You lost big time, not really a scenario where Boyd can be a WR1 in fantasy.  Best case scenario you‚Äôre look at 60-70 catches 1000-1050 yards and 6 TDs.  Chark has 80-90 1300 yard potential

Edit: but in reality Burrow goes for Mahomes 5000 yds 50 TDS and Boyd and Green go for 1300 and 10 each"
"I really like Boyd, and happen to have both on my team, but yeah this was not a good trade imo. Chark is a stud and the #1WR on there team. You shouldn't let fandom bias effect fantasy lol"
"I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get 1000 Boyds on this sub since you‚Äôre asking a biased group, but I‚Äôd probably give the slight edge to Chark. The Minshew to Chark connection might be the only good thing about Jacksonville next year. Unless he gets hurt, I see him having a really solid year. Boyd is great, but he‚Äôs going to be splitting targets with Green, Ross, Higgins, and Tate. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad trade because I think they‚Äôre probably going to perform pretty similar, but if I had to choose, I‚Äôd go Chark."
"Personally, I love Boyd this year, especially after Burrow‚Äôs comments the other day, but we‚Äôve also got way more options to spread the ball around to compares to Jacksonville."
Chark is a 1. Boyd is a 2. simple as that.
I see it as a shove but if you wanted boyd than good for you

"Yeah, this may be true, but with Burrow on a rookie contract, AJ tagged, and Boyd locked up for the next couple years it definitely was the right move"
"You are only using the leading rusher in the game itself for the winning team? What an odd measurement. Marshawn Lynch was paid and Seattle reached the SB multiple times and won once.

Gurley made the SB, Devonta Freeman made the SB as a very highly paid back as well. Frank Gore made the SB as a highly paid back. Jonathan Stewart was a very highly paid back as well."
So is this just the leading rusher of the Super Bowl itself and not for the entire season?
What a thing to cherry pick. Correlation is not causation.
For some reason it just seems really strange seeing Legarrette Blount up there three times.
The fact that Ray Rice was only making 2 mil is crazy to me. The man had over 2000 all purpose yards and 15 touchdowns the year before they won the superbowl.
Garbage
"Honestly, What would it say to the locker if you don‚Äôt re-sign the guy that has shown up Every day working his ass off to get better, excelling at the highest level, despite a porous O-Line and numerous other obstacles on a terrible team. He‚Äôs one of the hardest working players on the team and easily one of the most talented. He deserves a contract in the eyes of the players on the team.

Since he was drafted, Mixon has been a leader in the locker room and one of the few brights spots on the team. He has stated his allegiance to the organization and has shown it with his actions.

It‚Äôs not like you can use character/ P.R concerns as an excuse to not pay him either. He‚Äôs been all class since being drafted, you drafted him in the first place and you have paid character issue players previously.

Finally, and probably the biggest consideration of all, We aren‚Äôt currently a Super Bowl team. If 2-3 years down the line our roster looks like the Saints or Cowboys, stacked with young talent that forces us to make tough decisions, well then we can move off him. For now, especially while Burrow‚Äôs contract is so cheap and there aren‚Äôt a ton of young stars on the team, the deal is a no brainer. No reason to move off one of your best players when you can so easily afford to pay him. $19 million guaranteed is nothing."
I‚Äôm not denying Joe is a great player but facts don‚Äôt lie.

In madden right now I‚Äôm constantly annoyed because I feel like I‚Äôm always neglecting someone and it makes me feel bad. I change the WR rotation every half to make sure they all eat
Dude is it not annoyingly hard to explain to non bengals fans how underrated Auden Tate is? Like nobody ever knows who he is but in my opinion the dude is an absolute maniac wideout.
"Auden Tate is the guy I am rooting for to be able to find his place. Every catch he made last year was a circus catch in traffic. He's not a burner, but I hope Joey B gives him some looks in the red zone this year."
Go in and create formation subs
"Jones, Steinbach, Braham, Williams, Anderson"
"Cowboys have Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup, ~~Randall Cobb~~, and first rounder CeeDee Lamb.  5th spot is iffy though."
Bengals and Broncos. Most under-rated offenses heading into 2020 season.
"Marvin Harrison, Brandon Stokley, Reggie Wayne, Dallas Clark, Marcus Pollard"
Can we cut Ross and pickup sanu?
"Schumann, Brahams, Franck, Dvo≈ô√°k, Shostakovich.



But yeah, these are good, too."
Ross? What?
Green and Ross can't stay healthy and Higgens is a rookie. WR room is going to be thin quick.
"Why do all the pundits think Kamara is way more valuable then Mixon. When you factor in the  O line, level of talent around them, and coaching is kamar really better? I understand he's a better receiver but I don't think he's worth more money. Agree or Disagree?"
"I‚Äôd say they are around the same amount of money 

But I think Mixon is underrated in the passing game 

So yeah there‚Äôs my take"
"I think it's a little premature to say Mixon is better than Kamara. I feel the same way when people says he's also better than Chubb. But if Mixon has the type of seasons we all expect him to, different conversation. Regardless, he's one of the top 8 or 9 guys at his position."
"I think they‚Äôre both pretty similar value. I can see Kamara getting the same deal Mixon got and I think both him and the team that signs him would be very happy with that. 

If you want an answer to why pundits and general opinion would put Kamara over mixon, there‚Äôs several reasons. Saints are a really popular team and have been contenders more often than not for a very long time. Cincy is also as small market as it gets. 

Kamara has been a fantasy powerhouse, and of course that doesn‚Äôt make him BETTER, but it does make him more popular. He is also a big pass catching back which leads to bigger numbers and goes along with the current direction of the league, (IE Cmac). 

I guess in summary, more popular player gets picked over the less popular player every day when it comes to ESPN and other press! But I‚Äôm personally a believer they‚Äôre quite equal."
You also have to factor in that he has a top 10 quarterback of all time taking loads of pressure off of him. Because you can‚Äôt stack the box against Drew Brees
"Joe is more talented, kamara catches way more passes. Need to get joe around 60 receptions per year going forward. More catches less carries"
"Kamara was playing hurt for a pretty significant part of last year and still has about 600 more yards from scrimmage than Joe. 

I think from a talent standpoint Joe and Kamara are probably pretty comparable, but Kamara has produced more and plays for a team that is a lot more popular/a lot better recently. Makes sense that Kamara gets more attention."

Our WR room is pretty hefty
"Stay out of the AFC North Mo, please. 

I could see him going somewhere like Philly, a place that is always decimated at WR."
"Unlikely we take a look at Sanu with our receivers room already loaded. One of my favorite players when he was here, so I hope he's able to sign with a contender"
I mean we are good with WR but if no one goes after him and we have an injury. He would be a fantastic back up wr

"Carl Lawson and a 4th round pick for Josh Allen of the Jaguars 

I‚Äôd love it"
The Jags would not take that offer
Who wouldn't? Give em a second and we'd still be robbing them blind.
"As a UK fan, I would be ecstatic if that somehow happened lol."
Never would happen. Allen is an obvious upgrade from Lawson and i think Lawson is already pretty good
The Jags would be absolute idiots to let Josh Allen go without getting a big haul in return
Trade an injury prone edge rusher with an expiring contract plus a day 3 pick for an edge rusher who looks to be a perennial pro bowler and has 4 years left on his contract. I love that trade for the Bengals.
I like lawson too much. I'd rather see our boy stuff a run or light up a qb.

It‚Äôs better that way IMO. These clowns won‚Äôt know what hit them when they see the orange and black. I‚Äôd rather be unhyped and over preform then over hype (last years browns) and under preform. Seriously I know the browns are a rival of sorts but like I have good friends who a huge browns fans. Last season they thought the Super Bowl was the only place they were headed and I can tell you I think last season stung a little more that they couldn‚Äôt sweep an dismal bengals team for their first battle of Ohio sweep in i think decades.
"I wouldn‚Äôt say that. The post put him at number 3 to get OROY, and there weren‚Äôt that many replies when I saw it, but he got at least one comment saying he‚Äôd earn it as well."
Neither did Cmac... who gives a shit what r/nfl thinks.
R/NFL are like if clownherd were a subreddit.
"I don‚Äôt understand how he isn‚Äôt pretty much a lock for ROY in most people‚Äôs minds. He‚Äôs the only day 1 rookie qb starting. That alone is pretty much enough to win it, as long as he‚Äôs healthy for 16 games."

Dude throws INTs like they're worth points. Hard pass here too.
I mean he'd be a better back up situation then we have I wouldn't be opposed to it
I‚Äôm all for bringing him in to battle with Finley
We should pick this guy up just to block the Steelers from grabbing him and turning him into a world beater somehow.
"One of Rapien‚Äôs numerous idiotic takes.
Chemistry matters in sports and you can‚Äôt run a team like it‚Äôs Madden. Why would you bring a disgruntled underachieving young QB into the room? What value does that add to the team? Rapien replacing Goodberry on the Locked On Podcast is Ogbuehi replacing Whitworth. Go back to Cleveland James."
"The man's gotta write articles, so I'm not surprised. But Rosen isn't a guy I'd like. Seems like he has a bit of an attitude (during his pre draft process I recall he had a grating type of swagger like Baker vs Joe's more measured confidence), and I feel like he would just be bitter he was at another place where he had no chance of starting.

I did want to trade for Rosen last year when it was clear Dalton wasn't going to be here for another contract, but I see no reason to with Joe here now."
"As long as he doesn‚Äôt complain and stays humble, id much rather have him than finely"
I think hes about the same level as a guy like finley
There‚Äôs a reason Rosen doesn‚Äôt stick anywhere even as a backup. He‚Äôs a cry baby. Don‚Äôt want him in our locker room even as a 3rd string.
I havent looked at the final roster but If we are carrying 3 qbs I'd rather see us pick up a veteran. The thing burrow is lacking is experience and having that on the roster might help Burrow in the long run.

Essentially all teams must cut from 80 to their final 53 man roster today by 4 pm ET. We have a big advantage here as well because if I‚Äôm reading this correctly all cut players will go on the waiver wire and thanks to our terrible season last year we have the opportunity to claim them first over all other 31 teams. We can potentially find some gems in positions of need (RT) which could be huge. Unfortunately that also means we will have to lose some guys that we all like as well. It‚Äôs pretty exciting.

If any of my info is wrong here please feel free to correct me."
"Cuts so far: Brandon Allen (QB), Jake Dolegala (QB), Torry McTyer (CB), Trenton Irwin (WR), Freedom Akinmoladun (DE), DaMarkus Lodge (WR), Mason Schreck (TE), Trey Dishon (DT), Mitchell Wilcox (TE), Jacques Patrick (RB)"
We can clear 1 roster spot for a waiver claim by moving Trey Waynes from Active Roster to the IR where he can come back from once healthy.

"I think only rookie contracts go through waivers, we can't claim Adrian Peterson etc"
"They might add depth at RT or RG but they aren't going to be picking anyone up who's going to be starting at either of those positions at this point. They're going to want to maintain continuity there especially with a shortened off-season.

The issue there is that our depth on the line isn't actually the problem. It's our starters at RG/RT. They could still find some gems anywhere though and I'm definitely happy we have first pick!"
""
"Well that was short lived, we really should have tried to nab a quality veteran."
""
Dolegala will easily be on the PS. It‚Äôs bengals fan syndrome to be paranoid and think that the entire league is stalking our undrafted 3rd string qb who every other team already passed up on.
So we really just rolling with finley at back up? During covid-19?
""
so home opener still no fans right?
What's the difference between no fans at the opener and 6k fans like 2 weeks later?
Hate this. Just bite the bullet and accept a season with no fans.
I unknowingly replied to this post in the browns group thinking I was doing it here joking that we should be happy that emperor Dewine is allowing anyone and I got two snarky responses and a crap ton of downvotes.  I literally do not get this. Look at the stats make your own risk assessment to decide if you want to go. Why is that in anyway a controversial thought.
"Just call it a BLM protest and then you can have 60,000"
Why pick the browns as one of those games? Much higher chance of non-bengals fans being in attendance.
Count me in! Coronabros stay home.
So what‚Äôs the difference between those games and all last year? The Bengals are used to no one in the stands.
"I'll go, 6k in a stadium that holds like 60k?"
Just open it up
"Yeah, shitty the Bengals don‚Äôt get this exception for our opener. It‚Äôs likely a matter of timing but what will probably happen is that this ‚Äútrial‚Äù will go well and they‚Äôll extend it for the rest of the season at the same or increased capacity leaving the Bengals the only Ohio team with a game without fans."
Six thousand fans is about average attendance for a browns bengals game
Is it an injury can be significant towards affecting the bengals chances of holding on in the secondary and winning? He was their free agent signing.
"It‚Äôs still a better core than last year. That‚Äôs all that matters to me. With all the signings they did, at least one is not going to work out in one way or another."
"Honestly we over paid for Waynes, it's not like we just lost a top CB or anything. Even though his help would be great to have it's not nearly as big of an impact compared to Reader."
"Yes, I think losing one of your top two corners is a huge blow to the secondary. No, it's not as bad for the overall D as Geno or Reader getting hurt. Yes, maybe the Bengals overpaid for him compared to what he was expected to get in the market, but the the team obviously thought he was important enough to what they want to do to make him worth that investment. If the Bengals thought Phillips was good enough to start every game I think they would have been happy to leave that $42 million dollars in the bank, so no matter how much they say, ""next man up"" I think it's a big deal."
"It hurts for sure but not a huge blow, I'd say moderate. He's a average corner and since he's our number 2 corner he would play above average in most cases since he's not being asked to primarily cover teams number 1."
"I see it as a bit less depth, but I honestly think our top 3-4 guys could all start and play well. The top 2 backups after that have some skill and experience as well, so it's not all that scary. The worse loss is probably Shawn Williams, I think they planned on using him as a hybrid LB/S in nickel packages and they might have to make a change to their scheme there unless they have another option. Maybe one of the young LBs is up to that task."
"Yea. Whenever your starting corner is down. That‚Äôs a blow.

Qb>OL>CB

In that order. The rest of the positions aren‚Äôt nearly as valuable"
""
""
Is Hart still on the team?
I love that all 7 draft picks are on this roster
Hopefully Stanley Morgan ends up on the practice squad. I‚Äôm a fan of the guy
"Oh no, not Shrek."

CB - Phillips, Jackson, Brown, Waynes, Alexander, Sims  (6)

S - Bates, Williams, Wilson, Bell (4)

**SPECIAL TEAMS**

LS - Harris

K - Bullock

P -  Huber


*Trey Waynes can be moved to IR designated to return tomorrow and with first waiver claim we can replace his spot without losing someone"
Nothing too surprising here. It is interesting they decided to keep 7 wide receivers.
Looks correct! I honestly can't say there's a single cut I really disagree with. We're a little light on on ends but Covington and Brown can both play a outside some and I'd imagine they'll be keeping their eyes open. And I hope we bring back Winston Rose if/when Waynes is placed on IR.
"Wish we had kept Winston Rose, and Jacques Patrick over Tony Brown and Samaje Perine just from what I had read during camp they seemed to be doing well. But I'm not in the building and overall can't complain with the moves we've been making. Just my Canadian boner for a former CFL player; and I figured Jacques Patrick would find a way to be Mixon-lite in a pinch. Hope they get on the practice squad and we get a few gems on the wire. Who Dey!"
"Haven't had a chance to pay attention to camp, but who is the b/u if Hopkins goes down?"
Hopefully there is a good OT cut from another team that we can claim to kick Bobby hart to the sideline
[deleted]
"Wonder if they'll grab Rosen off waivers... Feel like it could be worth a flyer, not like there are any better backups out there."
A little disappointed that they didn‚Äôt keep Stanley Morgan. I think he could‚Äôve been a pro bowler on special teams. Those type of players tend to have good careers. Hopefully he is eligible for the practice squad and nobody else gets him.
"Maybe this is the year they sell me on Cethan Carter. I haven't been a fan so far. 

I do like that we're keeping 9 on the OL. If you don't have quality maybe you can rotate your way to keeping legs fresh in the 4th quarter with quantity."
The 2019 LSU vs Georgia game is being aired on CBS right now. Just in case y‚Äôall want to see more of our QB
His mobility in and out of the pocket gives me real hope for this season
God I can‚Äôt wait for this season to start.
Nut
Alright stop it your giving me to much of a boner
"This sub needs to relax a bit. I'm all for the hope, but we will be super lucky to win half our games this season - even that would be a huge year for us with a rookie qb. He had better talent at the wr position at lsu, honestly."

I know the flag colors (it's tattoed on my arm) but I think you can keep the team colors and make them work with the design concept."

5-7 if the OL holds up for joe. ü§ûüèª

7-9 wins this year, ill be shocked if we get less than that... and im a seasoned bengals fan, pessimism is second nature."
"Optimistically, between 6 & 8 wins. Realistically, probably closer to 5 wins. This season will be crazy though. I‚Äôm expecting loads of close games, injuries, and a lot of salty fan bases when their teams are kind of all over the place without a preseason"
As long as we beat the Browns and Steelers.
I think our defense was a bigger concern than the offense last year. But they can‚Äôt possibly lose 14 again.

I‚Äôve heard of DH Gate. People who mentioned it said really good quality
Koch sporting goods. In the city on W 4th street
I actually got my stitched color rush Joe Burrow jersey delivered yesterday from dh gate. The quality is really really nice. Was only $20. Looks and feels 99% the real thing. Downfall is basic shipping took about 3 months.
I like supporting Koch's but you can find Chinese knockoffs online for $30 that are surprisingly good quality.

Surprised dolegala didn‚Äôt make it

Nate in GMFB made Zac his prediction for Coach of the Year. Kyle told him they don‚Äôt give that to coaches who get to 8-8 or 9-7 but to coaches who raise the bar by going from a poor season to a playoff season. He then aked if Nate is predicting the Bengals make the playoffs. His answer.... Yes! Great enthusiasm and support from Nate in the show. Thoughts?
Interesting.  I've never heard Nate say good like this about the Bengals.  I hope he is right
"Thats not like nate b to throw down for the bengals like that. Usually shraeg is our guy. Thats nice to hear. 

But fuck Kyle. He's a bandwagon fan. As soon as bengals get big he's going to be on his knees cupping the bengals'..... burrows"
I like the way Nate thinks
I‚Äôm not expecting playoffs this season but I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised at all if we are healthy and run off 10 wins and get a wildcard spot
"Jimmy Johnson won it in 1990 with a 7-9 Cowboys team and missed the playoffs after going 1-15 the year before. Not saying these are similar scenarios and ZT is gonna win it without going to the playoffs/a winning record, but just wanted to point that out."
Link?
"Not expecting the playoffs this season ... maybe an outside chance but so many variables, what with injuries, the virus, etc. bottom line, Joe Burrow is still a rookie and he‚Äôs still never seen pro defenses at full speed, and we‚Äôll see what the line can do in front of him. Sure, I‚Äôm hoping to be pleasantly surprised and the playoffs are not impossible this year but a lot has to go right for our side and a lot has to go wrong for the rest of the division. My prediction? 7-9 this year and 10-6 or even 11-5 next year with a playoff win or maybe two. (Disclaimer - I‚Äôve been a fan of the team since the early seventies and have learned the hard way to never get too excited before the season even starts)."
I'm just amazed there are people out here discussing Good Morning Football commentary lol....
"In looking at the schedule I do not see more than 6 wins.. and that‚Äôs pushing it.
Bengals wins: Chargers, Browns, Jags, Washington, Dolphins,  either Steelers or Giants 
Bengals losses: Eagles, Ravens, Colts. Browns, Titans, Either Steelers/Giants, Cowboys, Texans, Ravens 
6-10 at best, potentially 5-11
6-10 is huge improvement over last year... well done coach"

That sounds like a fake name.
"Potentially dumb question... well, definitely dumb, I thought Rapien moved to the Cleveland market for his job? Does he still report on Bengals news in addition to Cleveland"
I don‚Äôt know anything about him but not having Wayne‚Äôs is going to hurt.
"welp...it‚Äôs that time of year again. I live in Tennessee and love the Bengals and for the past decade have watched every game nationally televised, gone to at least one game at PBS in person, and then used some subreddits to stream games... This year is different I NEED TO SEE BURROW. For out of market fans how are y‚Äôall going to watch live games. I know about sunday ticket but I don‚Äôt want to pay $400 just to watch the bengals. PLEASE LEAVE SUGGESTIONS aka fan packages, subreddits, twitter streams etc i‚Äôm willing to pay up to $150 to watch all the games but would love to find someone who streams them"
Nflbrite.com is the name I think. Or crackstreams
"here‚Äôs a mostly-legal workaround: 
Get a VPN subscription (about $40/yr)
Get an NFL Game Pass subscription ($100)

use your VPN to put your location somewhere in Europe, and then login to your Game Pass account. 

All NFL games are available to watch live with Game Pass if you‚Äôre in Europe."
"If you know anybody who‚Äôs in college, you can get Sunday Ticket U, which is only $25 a month"
"DO NOT GET SUNDAY TICKET!  You're on reddit...stream that shit for free.  Do not spend that much money on it.  I've said it before on reddit...you get SunDAY games.  No nights, Thursdays, Mondays, Saturdays...please don't waste your money.  Stream that shit!  Who Dey!"
"Idk if you're in Nashville but Tailgate Brewery on Music Row over here does the game outside on a projector every week. When weather's nice it's easy to have a nice social-distanced beer and enjoy the game with a solid crowd! 

I usually just stream the games at home but that's always an option"
"I live in Asia so I just buy game pass and watch while I'm having breakfast its that or get up at 1am.  But to watch live, sportstreams is my go to"
"I‚Äôm from Tennessee as well, this year I am in DC for football season. I plan on switching my area code on my Hulu TV for football season to a Cincinnati or Louisville area code. This would prob work for YouTube tv as well."
"I live in MS now and sunday ticket isn't just 3-400 dollars, you have to buy a dtv package with monthly of 100 bucks. So basically its in the ballpark of 1500 a year to watch 16 bengals games lmao. 

**and thats exactly what I pay who dey**"

"I like the idea of the Bengals in the playoffs, but the offense in no joke. Give Burrow a couple of weeks and I bet this offense will carry the team to the playoffs! Who Dey!"
"I'm cautiously optimistic about a playoff berth this season because of the expansion.  The cause I have for hesitation is our division - the AFC North is looking like it will be the toughest division in the league this year, maybe second toughest behind the NFC West.

We know the Ravens will be very good, and the Browns have all the pieces that a competent team would need but also they're the Browns.  The question for me is how good the Steelers will be, really.  If they're good, we have a long shot at a playoff berth.  If they implode, I have faith enough in Burrow and our defense to get us where we need to be.

Obviously this sub is biased and obviously the Steelers can get fucked in an eternal shit-dumpster inferno of fuckage.  But do we really think they'll show up this year?  I believe in their defense, that unit looks tough, but their offense seems to be contingent on ""if Ben stays healthy"" and really why would anyone think that he's actually going to stay healthy?  Do they really have that many offensive pieces outside of Ben and Juju and their O Line?  Point is, I think Pittsburgh is sort of primed to implode this year and if they do, that bodes super well for a Cincinnati playoff berth.  Sports media will always hype Pittsburgh no matter how good they actually look, so what's everyone's take on Pittsburgh this year?"
"I definitely think a playoff spot is possible if the team plays to max potential. I think they could jump the browns in the division, like the browns are going to be trying a Vikings style run the ball and play it safe with a below to average defense. While the bengals have a more high scoring effort with their offense plus I think have a better defense. I think overall the browns are a good team to compare them to.

The upgrades to the d line, depth, all the lbs they drafted, Bynes, vonn bell, Alexander, like literally everywhere I hear bengals talk they say they should be a fun scoring team to watch, and I'm like wtf the defense got like 5-6 new starters, how is that not brought up just as much, it should be a massively improved defense, and if the offense is supposed to be that fun this should add up to being a good team.

I think the bengals o line will progress to be average, and you have a qb that excelled in pressure, I don't think the o line is a big enough disaster to be labeled the reason they will struggle. Definitely the right side of the line will be an issue but I think the left side will be solid, so at least one side will be fine lol

And everything you hear it seems the entire team is so excited about the team, wants to play for each other, is in a really good mental space

The issues to me come with the prospect of injuries, like are we getting top 5 wr AJ Green that is fighting through his franchise tag or will he be out a large portion of the season? Will Ross be there at all? Where's Higgins in the depth chart? It seems pretty much all camp the wrs were hurt, there's a massive jump in talent if those guys are there vs auden tate and Boyd playing the wr1

Then the other issue to me is coaching, I don't understand it cause every one of the players I've heard talk about him make a point to say how much they love Taylor, it should say something that dispite a 2-14 season the players still love him, I still remember the Green quote saying how smart he is. But there were so many coaching errors last season, like how can you wait until late in the season to run one of the best rb's in the league? I'm skeptical but hopeful he can turn it around

It's possible there are growing pains as like half the roster is different from last season and how they'll put it together, but there's no doubt to me the potential is there."
Except Dalton was never our problem and a younger more mobile qb doesn't mean anything if you can't protect him or play defense so its not a big deal if he throws a pic
Yes

"Trayveon is such a stand up guy from what I‚Äôve heard

Wonder what the difficult conversation was about?
[deleted]
"The Chargers chose to keep interim offensive coordinator Shane Steichen who took over for Ken Wisenhunt in late October of last year. I decided to watch some of these games to see what they liked to do offensively and what we should expect from them. While they changed quarterbacks from Philip Rivers to Tyrod Taylor some of what they run should remain the same.

When it comes to the ground game, they run more [gap blocking schemes than zone](https://mgoblog.com/content/what-gap-blocking-vs-zone), but will still mix in some zone. I would actually expect this to become even closer to a 50/50 split with Tyrod at QB because they will likely mix in some [zone read](https://www.sbnation.com/a/option-football-history) between [Tyrod and the RB](https://streamable.com/hjzad6) to utilize his legs. The gap blocking scheme, which is also called power, involves pulling and blocking to open up an area. Some of your most common plays that use gap are power, counter, toss, and duo. The Chargers run all of these plays, but the most common run play I saw was the toss play.

The Chargers under Steichen liked to run toss where the play side offensive tackle (OT) and tight end (TE) would pull leaving the WR to seal the end man on line (known as a crack block). This type of blocking on a toss is called [crack toss](http://smartfootball.com/offense/the-crack-toss-sweep-and-the-double-crack-screen-against-an-overloaded-defense#sthash.gO5a64Pf.dpbs). The idea is to seal the end man while pulling your big guys out to block the second and even third level (linebackers and defensive backs). [Here is a quick diagram of the Chargers OT-TE crack toss](https://i.imgur.com/9a4h8du.jpg) (sorry for the shitty doodle), but you can see that the Chargers will basically overload one side by motioning over a back. In this case, that back is Ekeler -- then they also pull the OT and TE (which they are able to do because Keenan Allen will seal the edge). Also watch the center who will try to block one of the linebackers. [The pulling TE takes the first guy at the second level and the OT takes the next guy to come through while Ekeler kicks out the CB.](https://streamable.com/m9y293) This play goes for a large gain here against KC who decided not to motion anyone over to match Ekeler. This allowed the Chargers to get more of their blockers outside than the Chiefs could match. The edge also could have exploited the WR trying to block him to blow this up, but more on that later. [Here is another example of the Chargers running a crack toss against the then Oakland Raiders](https://streamable.com/ccmdn7). This time, the blocking does not go as well, but it still works as a small gain. They also start in a bunch (that group of three to the left) look to run this toss out of rather than motioning over a back to get the advantage. It's the same play: center blocks the LB, WR crack blocks the end man on line (EMOL), and the OT and TE pull in front. [Here is my last example of crack toss](https://streamable.com/1wizrr). This time they motion Henry to get into a bunch look (you can see that this is pretty common as well).

One interesting aquisition they made that should effect this play is their new offensive linemen and specifically, Brian Bulaga. Bulaga previously spent his time in Green Bay anchoring the right side of the offensive line. I consider him to be one of the premier offensive tackles in the league and fully expect to see this play run with him leading the way. In fact, Green Bay [happened to run this play towards Bulaga before](https://streamable.com/tgzrqq). You can see in this clip how Bulaga is able to pull out in front, get to Kuechly, and drive him out of the play. So how would a team stop this play? Well, the Patriots tried to run the crack toss against us last year and it did not work out as well because [Carlos Dunlap wreaked havoc on the crack block and the pulling OT](https://streamable.com/nctxsj) and Dunlap does happen to mostly line up over the right tackle. If he can maintain this level of run defense next year against the play, then we may be able to blow a few of these up. However, if he or someone else does get sealed, it is up to our linebackers to shed blocks and get outside quickly to defend this play otherwise Ekeler and the other RBs will be looking at a lot of open field.

Let me know if you guys enjoy this so far. I plan on breaking down two other plays: the Chargers run on offense under Steichen (3x1 whip and cross/slip screen) as well as looking at Joey Bosa and Melvin Ingram, how they will attack our offensive line, and Chargers defensive coordinator Gus ""Cover 3"" Bradley. If this has some love I'll continue next week with Cleveland and new head coach Kevin Stefanski."

"I like everything about these, except the new all black color rush. Keep the white tiger look we already have and add an all orange varient if you want a second color rush option."
It‚Äôs our current uniforms without the stupid looking stuff. I like it!
The helmets are untouched. It works for me.
"Great stuff, but we need to keep the white color rush. It's too sleek."
need that current white color rush for the white tiger look with a white and black helmet.
Agreed except for the color rush. Really like the white color rush and would want to see it incorporated in any future designs
"Your white uniforms are my favorite because of the large jump in quality from our current ones, nice work hopefully one day the bengals will listen to somebody like you"
"I like it, and would be even better if we can get them to bring back the leaping tiger logo"
"Oh thats hot, baby!"
I like those minus keeping our white color rush over the browns rip off
"sweet, too bad they wont actually change it"
"Outside of the color rush unis, these uniforms keep everything right with our current uniforms and scrap everything that's wrong with them. I would love to see these on the field."
Have seen better but these are nice. The black socks aren‚Äôt too great on the orange and the white but other than that they‚Äôre believable.
"I actually like the uni's they have now, it feels a bit stale because they've had them for so long, but I like how busy they are and they just look unique compared to the other uni's in the league imo. Like a lot of people want to go back to how the old ones were, a classic look, but imo I hate everyone wants to do the same thing, and when I look at the current Bengals jersey vs other teams, the other teams seem so boring, just a shirt with a number name and stripes. I think that classic look had this cool factor of a throwback, but at this point I think it's overdone and don't want any more of that.

However, I am also a fan of making a splash, what I would accept is going on the color rush, then doing a reverse color rush of all black and white where the black is on the normal color rush, you could get even crazier and change the helmet to white and black, I feel this uniform would look so flashy and would stand out a ton if they did this. Also with the color rush, a big real reason it stands out imo is the limited use of orange which adds to it. Or in this case you could keep the helmets the same and go full Oregon ducks mixing and matching the color rush template with orange and white, orange and black, white black orange pants, there's many things you can do with this. In this case then next color rush could be the throwbacks.

But this is just what I think of the uni's, many others have a completely opposite opinion which I don't get, what people like about uniforms is so subjective I've seen Bengals in the top of ranking who has the best uniforms and also at the bottom."
I love the geno scheme ... amazing
I'm down for this.
"Socks are trash and as everyone else said, we have the perfect color rush already. But this is what we all want."
"Besides the stripes on the pants, these are great. I love the helmet adjustment. I think the bengals have always trade to get stripes on the pants but to never works. The theme is great on just the shoulders and helmet but doesn‚Äôt work on the legs. The color rush whites are better then these aways tho. White tiger should be permanent away uni.

Also this is the BEST helmet redesign. It solves the problem of the awkward view of the helmet from the front by making the front most stripe smaller. I hate that we have to trust Nike to do these things."
Better than current but not as good as the old school ones.
"The jerseys and pants are still too stripey. I think the helmet stands on its own. Stripes all over the place is just too much, IMO. This redesign is 1000% better than the current unis though."
I like the color rush all blacks. Clean and keeping the helmet is always good.
"Every time I see a uniform redesign I feel like Pam in the ""it's the same picture"" meme. I feel like I'm going crazy"

"I grew up near Joe. When we made chili, it had hunks of meat (Beef or Deer), peppers, and beans.

"I'm intrigued to know more about the Bengals Defence.

They got torn apart last year, by pundits, for their poor performances. How do you feel about your D this year? I suspect the Chargers will go in with a run heavy game plan, but I know you've improved there. How is your pass D?
We're missing Williams, but still have Keenan and some younger receivers who have shown flashes. 

Also, on a long-term note, what would Bengals fans consider a successful season? Taking into account a rookie QB with limited practice time and no on-field time?"
Just wanted to say as a Chargers fan I love this thread. Great idea to get fans to come over and talk in a peaceful manner.

"I'm a bit sorry for everything our defensive line is gonna do to your brand new fancy QB in Burrow. His first game speed experience and he faces Joey Bosa against Bobby Hart, and Melvin Ingram against Jonah Williams"
"Chargers Defense is pretty loaded


Ingram and Bosa are a very good pass rush duo with Linval Joseph stuffing the run


Hayward, Chris Harris Jr., Nasir Adderely (2nd round pick ball-hawk FS) in the secondary.


We have a lot of young promising players in the Linebacker, SS, CB, and second DT position.


Our defense is great against the pass and we are playing against a rookie Tackle and Bobby Hart so pressure is going to coming fast for Joe Burrows with very good coverage playmakers. But we have a history of getting destroyed by rookies, and the Chargers are a very unlucky team.


Our offense is using Run Pass Option, starting Tyrod Taylor. Tyrod has a history of not being a good decision maker, sub par thrower, and very passive about making big time throws. Expect a lot of short throws, QB scrambles etc. Tyrod also gets sacked a-lot because of his tendencies to hold the ball. Now he could come out and surprise us, but at this point of his career its unlikely. 


Our C Pouncey and WR Mike Williams are Questionable. Our Left Tackle position is a WIP and will probably be below average to bad and our WR group outside of Keenan Allen is 2 Late round Rookies and a promising UDFA.


Expect the Chargers Offense to be run heavy with QB scrambles and short to medium conservatives throws. While Joe Burrow is dealing with a lot of pressure in a new offense, but him and the playmakers getting it done to a certain extend."
"Chargers fans: Even without Derwin (awful injury, love watching that guy play) your secondary is still pretty legit right? This defense is a tough one for Burrow to play off the bat. 

I feel like this game will come down to Mixon, if he can eat then we can keep pace but I don‚Äôt think you can expect Burrow to light it up on the Chargers defense week 1."
"Joe Burrow: How many times are you guys gonna get past my tackles?

Joey and Melvin: Yes."
"LSU fan so I love Joe Burreaux. Will be rooting for y‚Äôall every other game.

Where dey? Coming from LA. I‚Äôm interested to see the Jackboyz vs Burrow matchup! It‚Äôs going to be a good way to see how our defense goes without Derwin. Let‚Äôs have a good game!
Glad to see these again
"I expect this to be a really messy game without a preseason, honestly."
"I hope the bad weather stays away, but at the same time, a run-heavy physical game may be what we need to win with how filthy their pass rush is."
Fuck yeahhh football is almost here!! Good luck to all bengal bros. Hope it's a fun and healthy game for both squads!
"Ahhh the question everyone wants to know about, Joe Burrow.

How many times does my main man Bosa bring him to his knees?

For real though, what are you actual predictions for his first time being let out of the house?"
Hope everyone stays safe and Burrow comes out with a record QB debut! Lets see what our first overall draft pick bought us with him. FUCK PITTSBURGH GO BENGALS
Ok honest question for any charger or bengals fan the bengals didn‚Äôt have any full tackling practices I see that as a huge red flag heading into the first game have the chargers had any tackling practices?

"Well, at least we're having an NFL Season(I still think it's possible this season will be suspended, and finished by April, 2021). 

With that out of the way, this is the first time since the 2005-2006 Season that the Los Angeles Chargers will have the starting Quarterback of one of their games not named Philip Rivers. 

It will be a close game, and let's just have a fun, safe, and COVID-19 free game.

Who Dey!?"
"Some would say Bengals ML is a bad idea. I say fuck off, Burrow is bringing the W home today baby. Geaux Bengals!"
I would love to see aaron donald put on a show. We may not do so hot but i think Joe will take failures constructively.

"This year the teams can protect players each week (Tuesday at 4pm) that can't be signed to other teams before the next game.

Some insight as to who probably just missed the cut to 53. With Williams still coming back from injury and Ross/Green's injury history I bet Henderson and Morgan are both protected for a while."
"Moderately surprised Brandon Allen isn‚Äôt on the list. If for some reason he gets poached, and Burrow and Finley both test positive, I can‚Äôt imagine what we would do. Not saying that‚Äôs likely, and I‚Äôm fine with the players we protected, but that‚Äôs kinda where my mind goes"

Good group though."
No Geno or Dunlap? Who was previously a captain but is no longer?

"Been running this for 5 years now. Usually see more than 5,000 predictions from fans from all 32 teams and get some interesting information out of it.  Here is last years [preseason prediction survey](https://public.tableau.com/profile/tblausey#!/vizhome/DraftNFL2019/rNFL2019PreseasonPredictionSurvey ). 

In 2016, the Cowboys had the highest homer bias score (68%), and the Seahawks, followed closely with a (65%) bias score, as the rest of the league was on the Cardinal bandwagon. Both won their divisions.

In 2017, I poked fun at the Jags, Bills and Rams fan bases, all of whom had 70%+ bias scores, calling them delusional. Many were huge underdogs coming into the year. I was left eating crow as they all made the playoffs.

I cannot find any reference to this in 2018, but I know I did one.

In 2019 the Titans scored the highest homer bias score ever of 80%, and Vikings came in second with 75%. While neither won their division, both over performed in the playoffs."
I got the Seahawks winning it all this year boys

"Hey there Benglas fans!

I‚Äôm starting a new sports podcast (Sports Optimist) where we talk about how every team can win a Super Bowl. The first trio is the Jags, Washington, and of course The Bengals!

So I‚Äôm asking fans, how can The Bengals win it all for the 2020-2021! Joe Burrow could continue his insane winning streak, the offensive skill positions are loaded, there‚Äôs reason for optimism. 
We‚Äôll be reading the best responses on our podcast, looking forward to your answers.

The podcast preview is already out on Spotify, the first episode should be available Thursday morning!"
Please. Please just let us play a game before dealing with these types of pipe dreams
Not comparing him to anyone specifically but rumors have it our starting qb can walk on water as well as turn it into wine
The defensive line and WR from top to bottom those 2 units are the best in the nfl then you add a top 7 RB in joe Mixon
Two words: Joe. Burrow.
Our Super Bowl is winning a playoff game soo
It‚Äôd be nice but it isn‚Äôt gonna happen with a zero experience QB and a 2nd year coach.
"The offensive line improved enough to give Joe Burrow time in the pocket to make plays to his great WR Corp while also allowing Joe Mixon to control the game so we don‚Äôt have to rely on the rookie QB. 

Every unit on defense improved through FA and the draft (assuming Logan Wilson and ADG are solid).

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôll say in 5 months when the Bengals actually win the Super Bowl"
"Ryan Shazier is not an idol or an inspiration.

His tackling style was considered reckless and he was warned multiple times that his tackling style will cause injuries to others and even to himself. 

Let's not forget he could have injured other players and he has. Remember that awful hit on Gio Bernard in the head? That was Ryan Shazier. Good thing Gio wasn't seriously injured. NFL even had to change the rules because of Shazier's action on the field. That's how bad and dangerous he was. 

[Source](https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2016/03/21/ryan-shaziers-hit-in-playoffs-will-now-be-a-penalty/)

There are plenty of online articles already documenting his dangerous tackling technique on the field:

[Source](https://www.behindthesteelcurtain.com/steelers-film-room/2016/8/29/12684214/steelers-film-room-ryan-shaziers-tackling-can-cause-hair-pulling)

The worst did happen to Ryan Shazier. I am glad he is able to walk and be healthy again. Living a productive and healthy life is more important than the glories on the playing field.

But he was reckless and he caused this to himself.

If a reckless driver crashed his car and got paralyzed then regained his walking ability, is the driver an inspiration? In my honest opinion, no.

Let's not forget he thought he could go back to playing even though the doctor told him he would be seriously injured again with his condition and he blew them off like their opinions didn't matter. Seriously, this guy was way over his head.

He can contibute more to football as a coach than as a player and that's what he should be focusing on instead of the pipe dream of playing football again."
"I'll never forget Shazier dancing on the sideline celebrating a hit on Gio while Gio was lying motionless on the field and being treated by medical personel.  I will never wish harm on another person, but Shazier is classless.  I am glad he can walk, but I will never respect him.  You reep what you sow."
"These type of things are the epitome of why I hate the steelers...such a stupid bias, ryan shazier gets praised for the way he played. Fuckin changed a rule because of the guy. The entire world hated burfict and watched him play with a dam microscope.  It's just so biased regardless if your a fan of them or not."
I wonder how the steelers subreddit would react to this being posted in their subreddit lol
"The first thing that comes to mind is him lowering his head (the same moved that injured himself.) and Gio being knocked out cold and do you know what Shazier did?

He fucking danced on the sideline."
There's people in /r/nfl calling him a true hero. What the fuck
[deleted]
"100% agree. And I think the only reason people idolize or rather ""elevate"" him is simply because he got hurt catastrophically and humans and media just don't know how to react to it while being PC. But I'm with you, man. Dude was the classic accident waiting to happen.

Unrelated: you forgot to link your sources but I can almost guess the two plays you're referring to so that tells you how bad he was at tackling. IIRC, he had at least three instances of that at OSU that a Steeler fan none-the-less had pointed out on YouTube a while back."
"He aimed to hurt people.

And then he hurt himself using his malicious play style."
"Oh man. This sounds bad but it's too funny to not share. My brother in law, in an Xbox party with me, will not stop complaining about Shazier being in Madden (post injury) and having a crazy high rating. The next morning, I wake up to a message from him: a video of Shazier attempting to walk and the text ""97 Madden rating, my fucking ass"""
"Some things are unique to the current era, including rules that are (arguably) overprotective of the QB and new concepts like illegal cutback blocks and ""defenseless receivers."" The known danger of leading with the crown of the helmet/spearing is far from a new thing. Spearing has been illegal for years for the very reason that it could paralyze a player.

My uncle coached youth football in the 80s.  Whenever he saw a player lead with his helmet, either in a game or in practice, he would immediately pull him out. They would then have to read aloud the warning on the back of the helmet.  He rarely won any games, but possibly prevented serious injuries down the line."
Agreed
"I think you have to seperate this a little bit more.

Ryan Shazier should not be idolized for his reckless playing style. I don't think thats arguable if you watch his play.

He should be applauded for making the best out of a horrible situation. We all do bad shit that causes pain to others and ourselves, and I like to try and judge people on what they do after. 

Life taught him a hard lesson and he made the best out of it. Thats worth at the very least applauding.

\--------------------

i say ALLLLL of this under the notion of Forever and Always...Fuck.The.Steelers"
"You‚Äôre preaching to the choir posting this here. I‚Äôm happy for his road to recovery personally, but as a player I will not miss him"
As a man I'm glad he's healthy and not paralyzed. As a football fan i'm glad he's the fuck off the field and that has honestly 0 to do with him being a Steeler. He played dangerous as fuck year in and year out and his tackling style is among the worst you can possibly have in football.
"He perfected his tackling techniques at Ohio State.  The coaches had ample opportunity to correct him.  The Steelers allowed him to continue, and his leading with his helmet was glorified as ‚Äúgreat hits‚Äù.   Glad that he can lead a normal life, even better that he can‚Äôt harm anyone else in the NFL."
Tbh I wouldn't blame Ryan as much as I would the defensive coaching and the entire Steelers organization that prioritizes violence and cheap shots. He was taught to hit like that from the Pittsburgh coaches because almost all of them pull this type of shit. Wonder why there are so many injuries in Steeler games? They like a dirty game.
Unpopular in all subreddits but one lol
"Loved him as a Buckeye, hated him as a Steeler."
"Admired maybe, idolized is a stretch but I guess so.. But should he be looked at as an example of how to play the game? Hell no."
"""You get what you fucking deserve. BANG""

-Joker"
"You said all this much better than i would except i dont wanr him coaching at all, he will be the next jerry porter talking shit on the field when hes not a player in a playoff game and theres goes joes first playoff win"
"Yeah, fuck that guy."
"I think that Steelers Bengals rivalry was the most intense rivalry in the nfl, I don't think the rest of the league understood how intense those games were, where Burfict gets hit by JuJu and comments will say good what a bitch he deserves it. I think the Bengals are such a small market team that the rest of the league didn't take notice, but that rivalry is the most intense to me. I see other rivalry games and they're like normal games, but Bengals Steelers would always end in multiple injuries because everyone wanted to hurt each other."
NFL has to idolize him because he was majorly disabled by their own league. Would look shitty on their part if they didn't give him some attention after suffering such an injury. Fuck him tho.
You're not wrong but that's not an unpopular opinion on this sub
"The only takeaway from the Shazier's retirement should be ""Don't lead with your helmet kids."" I'm a lifelong Buckeye fan but fuck Ryan Shazier forever. He didn't play that dirty at OSU so that's coached on the Steeler's side. He danced on the sideline when he injured Gio. He played to hurt people and in turn got hurt."
Not an unpopular opinion here. Fuck Ryan Shazier
"I dont remember the Bernard hit, I do remember when he got hit and being scared because I always liked watching him play same with Burfict. Maybe Shazier was cocky then but ut kind of sounds like he sees his error now that he got hurt."
"It has always been weird to me the tone of Shazier's situation. It's never been a cautionary tail with highlights of him trying to spear people with his helmet..instead always a heroic tribute. I wish his situation on no one, and his recovery has been great. He should be spearheading a movement for why play like his is bad for the league."
Yup you‚Äôre not the only one. I said the same exact thing today and I‚Äôve been saying it since it happened. Glad someone else is bringing this up too
I‚Äôve been saying this all day. Dude was good and it was unfortunate what happened to him but he was a dirty ass player.
Its torture watching him getting all this praise
"As a fan of OSU, I knew it was only a matter of time before he caused significant injury to himself or or others. He was booted from games multiple times for targeting at OSU. He has a poor technique that he never corrected. He played professionally and should have adjusted his technique. He definitely does not deserve praise. He was lucky that's all."
"While i do agree his form was terrible,  he was a good player,  whose career was cut short due to an injury while playing the game.  Your driving comparison would be spot on for nascar/f1 drivers. Anybody that gets hurt doing what they love, and attempts to fight back to do that job again should be looked up to as an inspiration for anybody that gets injured. 

Again,  was his tackling form poor and led to his injury? Yes. Does that mean he shouldn't still be an inspiration? No."
This ain‚Äôt it chief

Get a big outdoor antenna and mount it on end of house or a 20 ft pole if you are within 30 miles from transmitter. Sometimes farther with right antenna.
"It's an annoying problem.  I don't look at Twitter, but I often have to mute my phone so I can't hear text messages coming in.  Your only option is DirecTV if you want to eliminate delay.

Satalite likely your only option

"While watching games for our upcoming week 1 matchup I was interested to see what pass sets the Chargers ran last year. I found three different plays that I think the Chargers will try to run again this year and probably at least once or twice next week. This is part 2 of my look into Shane Steichen, the new offensive coordinator for the Los Angeles Chargers. [For my look into the crack toss click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bengals/comments/iorp8i/film_analysis_on_the_chargers_crack_toss/). 

Now switching gears from the ground game to the air game. The Chargers passed the ball at an extraordinary rate last year (63.29% which is 6th in the league right behind us) and I found there to be a few plays that kept reoccuring under their new OC. These plays were used to get their great playmakers in space and/or utilize mismatches they would find presnap or in the opponents coverage. The first of these three plays I will talk about will be the most recognizable: [the slip screen](https://insider.afca.com/xs-os-running-back-slip-screen/). In Steichen's [slip screen](https://streamable.com/id8oz2) both the play side and back side offensive tackles will [kick slide](https://www.shakinthesouthland.com/2012/7/30/3199265/basics-of-pass-blocking) like in normal pass protection. This will key to the defense that it is a normal pass play rather than a screen. The interior of the offensive line (IOL) then gets ""beat"" letting that penetration through so they are freed up to get infront of the back to block. The running back will step up to the middle as if he is giving help in pass protection, but instead of blocking he will turn and run with the IOL. The QB holds the ball and waits for everything to be set before tossing it over the defensive line and into the RBs hands. This is a play that is very common in the NFL especially when you have a running back like Ekeler. Ekeler has a great set of hands and is slippery in the open field. They would run this play [to the opposite side of where the RB was positioned](https://streamable.com/ot5hs6) and to the [same side.](https://streamable.com/txbnsi) This makes it so the defense won't really be keyed in on either side as the possible slip screen, so they must always be prepared for it. New acquisition and 5 time probowler Trai Turner will be one of the leading blockers on this play and he comes with experience since he just blocked for Christian McCaffrey last year. However there is no need to fret, because [one way to stop this is for your DL to recognize and run down the line to make the stop](https://twitter.com/WillieCashmore/status/1283139784345563137?s=20).

The next pass play I am going to take a look at is one from an empty formation which is not the same as 00 personnel. Last year they typically ran the play from 21 personnel (two running backs and one tight end) but they may change that to 11 or 12 personnel due to the loss of Gordon. The [play always went the same](https://streamable.com/baf24q): [jet motion](https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/10/30/18040534/jet-sweep-motion-play-rams-chiefs-offenses) Gordon for a fake handoff, clearout the defense with deep routes, then Ekeler runs a drag to get in space. It's a fairly common play when you have a great receiving back who can work in space like an Austin Ekeler. Leaving a CB in to cover him is probably overkill because you need those guys for the WRs while leaving a LB on him is exactly what they want because the LB will not be able to keep up with him on the play. [One way to defeat this play is to get pressure fast which with Sam Tevi starting at LT is possible.](https://streamable.com/kjm96k) While the other way is to play [match coverage](https://touchdownwire.usatoday.com/2018/11/08/the-match-game-part-2-how-nick-saban-re-imagined-defensive-coverage/2/) which is essentially a mixture of zone and man where a defender will sometimes (depending on route combination) pass off their man and take over for someone else. When seeing the Ekeler drag a defender could pass him down the line and switch to playing someone else.

The last of my plays will however take advantage of a defense trying to play match. [This play](https://streamable.com/mewtrk) is a [whip route](https://qb-4-life.blogspot.com/2010/07/bladewhip-route.html) from a 3x1 set (3 receivers to one side with 1 receiver on the other). The 3x1 forces a defense to provide extra support to the 3 side or strong side. The 1 side or weak side is then typically left with just one or two defenders to play against and that defender often [essentially plays man coverage against him.](https://matchquarters.com/2017/06/09/defending-3x1-formations-solo-coverage/) Due to this knowledge the Chargers will have the weak side receiver run a whip route against this manned up defender because it's near impossible to defend from him. If the defender tries to cheat it they are giving up an easy slant, but if they are going to try to play inside against the slant portion they are going to get toasted on the whip portion of the route. This is something to watch for not only with a WR, but also with Hunter Henry if he gets matched with a linebacker. [If you have followed along you might be able to guess that the Raiders are playing match coverage here](https://streamable.com/zx5liu). One way you can tell is that the defender originally on Henry has great leverage, but thinks this is a slant, so he points to the linebacker and then moves to take away the crosser behind him. This whip is one way to exploit match coverage, because it puts a defender in a bind of split second decision making. They have to decide whether to pass him off or stay with him. Like I mentioned in the last paragraph passing him could be beneficial because he is unable to stay with him if it is a short crossing route, but as you see here if they break back out the switching defender is now stuck trying to chase him. 

These are all the offensive plays I would look out for on Sunday. Next I plan on going into the defense the Chargers will play and how their great defensive line likes to play. I appreciate any feedback you guys could give me, if you want additional learning resources, or if you need me to break something down further! I know this one was a big one so thanks for staying with me to the end if you made it."

Also for that Thursday night game, I‚Äôm doing a free trial of Fubo which includes NFL network. Just cancel before the 7 day trial ends."
Thanks everyone. I‚Äôll probably just end up biting the bullet and shelling out that Sunday Ticket cost.

"RIP, Who Dey!"

"Sorry to hear that from a Seahawks fan
Cheering big time for you guys this year"
RIP and fuck the Steelers
RIP and my condolences
I hope he is able to see his beloved Bengals win a superbowl as an angel on the sidelinesüôè
Sorry for your loss hopefully Bengals can bring home the Lombardi this year having an Angel in their corner.
"Really sorry for your loss :( but it‚Äôs obvious he was a huge fan, hopefully the Bengals kick some ass this year in his honor"
"I'm seeing a lot of talk about Geno and how he isnt practicing this week. In a normal off-season I would be worried, but not this off-season. Did you see what just happened to Von Miller? Last play of a light practice tweaks his ankle out for season. First practice of Zac Taylor's career he loses AJ Green for the year. Zac Taylor is taking absolutely no chances this year and I feel that Geno not practicing it completely precautionary. 

I'll be worried if he doesnt participate in any capacity by friday/Saturday. 

Fuck the steelers!!"
Mike Daniels has a groin injury as well and didn‚Äôt practice.
This aged poorly

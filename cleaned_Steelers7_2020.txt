the good old riley meme
your moms basement needs sanitizing

supposedly not serious
clearly youre single

i didnt watch this but ive had a few beers and the words next man up has me thinking of tomlin and makes me wanna run through a fucking wall for that man
very sad to hear about tunch having als lets hope for some breakthroughs in that diseases treatments


ive met tunch and he prayed with my family so my uncle would get a kidney my uncle got a kidney so im going to pray for tunch
tunch will beat down the disease like he beat down defensive linemen
damn wishing him the best
fuck poor guy
yeah what a bummer watching him this year you could tell something wasnt right
the good news is als research has done wonders ever since the ice bucket challenge hopefully he pulls through
fuck als
just in time hope this helps him
manthat is awful wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy such a horrible disease
goddammit too young to have seen tunch play but his voice is a sunday afternoon staple i wouldnt wish that disease on anyone
just listened to him and wolf last week on the dve2 hd radio station i knew something was up and was googling furiously trying to find out if something had happened with him very sad to hear but hopefully new research can help him prayers for tunch
i work with the als association and know that there is a solid chapter in western pa my grandfather got care in pittsburgh when he had als about 15 years ago and there are great medical experts in pittsburgh and ohio

very sad to hear this about tunch i wouldnt wish als on anyone i hope this brings some needed attention to the disease the care available in 2020 is better than it has ever been but its a very difficult disease and hard to plan for the trajectory of it steve gleason has lived with it for many years now but its not easy

i hope he and his family get all of the care and support that they need
oh my god tunch is more than just the voice of the steelers network he is an amazing individual who ive had the privilege of meeting on many different occasions my prayers go out to this very spiritual heart and soul of steeler nation we love you tunch
such a good player and great person my first memory of him was watching him play basketball on the steelers team that would play vs all the local school districts wishing him and his family all the best in this tough time
prayers up for tunch and his loved ones
oh man thats heartbreaking hes a hell of a guy wishing him and his family the best
oh shit i wouldnt wish that on anyone
damn that sucks listen to him and wolf daily after randy bauman on dve
damnthat is heartbreaking i hope he and his family are able to cope with this as well as possible
oh no i am heartbroken for him
very sad and sending prayers his way listening to his show on steelers nation radio for a few years now and could tell something was up with him
damn poor guy
terrible i knew he didnt sound right during the first game this year he just seemed completely out of it and not his normal self
i met tunch and wolf years ago he is genuinely good person and godly man praying that he will beat this insidious disease

might be in the minority but these are lame
i agree
wish they would wear these one game
its not a salute to service its an insult to it

the us armed services are meant to be somber and serious institutions the only purpose of which is to protect the citizenry from real lifethreatening dangers

the marketing and fetishization of them is why you get things like heavily armed militias plotting to kidnap and lynch elected us officials tv has talked them into hating

this is propaganda for profit nothing more nothing less
every time someone takes a cell phone pic of a computer screen i die a little bit
those are actually pretty bad ass

gotta admit juju out there hustling my dream is he is trying to use endorsements to make up for the money we cant pay him the ultimate team player
i like juju as much as the next steeler fan but i dont think i would feel comfortable drinking something called juju juice
i guess hes juice juice smithschuster now

juju is going to make 500 million dollars at this point jesus
combining tik tok youtube instagram twitch endorsements his own branding for his charities hes beginning to become a marketing genius especially for what he stands for idk just have a lot of respect for it all
should have been jujuice
im going to need someone from pittsburgh to send me some juju juice asap
hes like the master p of the nfl
please use this thread to post anything doesnt have to be steelers or football related at all dont downvote in this thread if you see someone being a jerk report it or message the mods about it

need to vent do it here

hatelove something and want to talk about how much you hatelove it do it here

eagles steelers preview from an eagles fan perspective



pats facility is shut down this morning sunday due to another positive test as per schefter
looks like tjs going to be on pats youtube show around 3 pm for anyone looking to listen i think pats on sirius now too

just thought yinz should know

edit it was the third hour not 3 pm sorry fellas and ladyfellas for the wrong time
good looking out
hes coming on now just a heads up
hes on
hopefully we get insider info about the cgap

dont tell the guys in rlakeeriebros this but the steelers have always been the only other team i actively root for outside of my bills my dad was a fan when he was a kid during the steelcurtain era that carried over when youre not playing us ill always root for you also lets hope this years snf game is less ugly than last years same outcome would be great though sorry love you guys
pittsburgher living in buffaloid say our hate for the patriots is what we most share
titans tennessee football team they offend me
fuck the titans and deflatriots
as a steelers fan loving in buffalo its been a weird 2 weeks
the rust belt is pretty large i wouldnt be surprised if a significant portion of the nfl is rust belt but i do respect and kind of like the bills all things considered they have a good ownership and fan base

your snow can fuck off though
got nothing but love for you guys bills fans are fucking awesome and im hoping at some point i can find my way to buffalo for a game
titans are becoming footballs trashtros

theres prolly a bunch of cool ass people in this sub the cross section of stuff i like and football is pretty remarkable
always hand in hand with bills bros theyre the reason why we were able to hand the bengals such an epic loss in the 2015 playoffs
can someone tell me why we hate the titans i get the whole covid thing but multiple steelers have said its nbd im confused
there were some egregious buffalonians on my floor at pitt tied with eagles fans when it comes to enjoying their own heartbreak but when they got a win man was it fun
buffalo bill bros
everyone hates the patitans so were all family here

well except ravens fans
fuck the pats
remeber last year when we loved the titans yeah me neither
bills look crazy good this year and allen looks much improved and like the real deal hopefully theyre peaking too early and will cool off otherwise id say theyre the afc super bowl favorite at the quarter mark
the steelers and bills were the only teams that voted against art modell relocating the browns to baltimore
it was not a lateral it was a forward pass hate the titans and odonnell too
fuck the titans

remember when that kicker faked getting knocked down in the playoffs

i remember
i mean the best bill ever was a western pennsylvania kid
why would we bother hating the titans all they did was get sick

you want to hate someone hate the nfl for not legislating preventative measures the way youd like

or the leadership of the country for defanging the cdc and for actively promoting the growth and spread of covid and actively attacking and marginalizing those who seek to prevent it

titans owners coaches and players were just duped by and then coddled by the same people who have put the whole nation and much of the world in danger with their dangerous antiscience headinthesand rhetoric

i like and respect vrabel and the titans a lot more for fucking over brady and belicheat in their swan song than i could ever hate them for being fooled by people in power
he just said on the pat mcafee show we all feel our great my body feels great

was scared he was on injury report yesterday but i think this means hes fine
yes people love to take the extremely basic practice designations as a symbol that someone is destroyed for the next gameseason etc


no i dont think i will

jesus christ so much nonsense in that writeup no one needs that much useless information
i got arthritis scrolling to the comments
this is no opponent texans game day food thread
the richest comment in that thread is when one person said we dont have talent at wr outside of juju
they knocked off the ravens last year
they also stomped on the terrible towel so fuck em
that was last year this is 2020 this year is a separate dimension in and of itself
last season is last season this season they are messing with our world so no
titans ravens patriotssame damn thing

all suck none are special dont put the pats and the ratbirds on pedestals steeler fans arent jealous of any team
also joe nedney

fuck that team
hol up they knocked off the pats and the ravens in the playoffs last year never forget ill gladly give them a 5 year reprieve for that
it does not matter what they did last year

and in the end its only matters if we beat the ravens

i dont care who else afc north loses to as long as they lose to us
lol i thought this was gonna say jesse james caught that ball
lmao they woulda definitely lost to chiefs or 49ers theyre ass postseason


also this but yknow fuck me i should get banned for saying we shouldnt immediately all dogpile on the titans and demand draft picksforfeit wins

with 1 less game yeet
rnfl loves talking about how this is irrelevant due to us playing only bad olines
burrows sweating intensifies
nut
kevin colbert is damn near perfecti edited from god

2 years agono defense last year helmets were thrown the ship has been righted
seemingly

3 years and back on the path to 7 thats great team management love the potential of this team remember when we lost to the raiders
unbelievable they all make eachother better so not only are they individually stars the whole is greater than the sum of the parts
thats really saying something for tj considering he gets held half the time
wow
guys is this good

lets introduce them to blitzburgh
the eagles are injured to shit in related news grass is green
i just saw a boot go flying across the room i think thats how theyll create the pass
theyre gonna throw to tight ends a lot
good luck with that
short quick passes all day so we cant pass rush
bold strategy cotton

this is corny as fuck but i love it
they dont have much likeness lol just a black dude and a white dude
tj just looks like hes whining while bud flexes at him lol
this makes me strangely uncomfortable

my therapist luigi bud dupree isnt real it cant hurt you

luigi bud dupree
rblursedimages
wheres tuitt
love the concept but tj looks like my 4 yr old son throwing a tantrum
we should wear overalls as pants one game
super sack brothers


ahhh i see why this is nsfw
isnt this normal wasnt there a humorous story this off season where ben was trying to get the defense to hit him and they refused

also is there a team in the nfl whose starting qb isnt off limits during practice

he aint touchin nobody who you touchin nobody
i i need an adult
its crazy for how good hargrave was last year we havent missed him one bit in 3 games
hes still a rotational player on the eagles didnt do all that much last week i am looking forward to seeing his patented fork lift move against pouncey if pouncey has any weakness its that he can be power rushed and bull dozed at times another interesting match up for sunday
this gives me a strange sensation deep down in my pants
giggity
how is the gravedigger doing this year
now i want ben to stiff arm him as he runs for 11
phrasing
good guy javon
apparently hargrave hasnt heard of the metoo movement which clearly states you cant harass a woman unless youre really good looking then its flirting



very low effort but i was bored
havent even seen the final product but thats hilarious

here we go
the circle is about 4 in diameter irrc

retro bowl is such a great game i recommend it to literally anyone that has a working phone and likes football even a little bit
great game i rename all the players after current steelers players
love the game played it nonstop for two weeks
careful i think you meant the pittsburgh iron workers wouldnt want the nfl to get upset

but seriously great game i did the same but i think it took me longer to get a defense that could allow me that 1 drive per game to screw things up
such a great game and costs one dollar very much recommended
love retro bowl won 11 championships with the lers didnt realize how much they updated the game i havent played in a while
man this game is just sooooo addictive and yes i only play with the steelers herewego

who the fuck is zach gelb
classic shitty argument just because something worse is going on the world it means you cant complain about anything else dude sounds like a kid in this
zach gelb can go fuck himself

big ben got asked a question during an interview and answered it honestly no one would be happy going from a week 8 bye to a week 4 bye especially when its the fault of another team who cant follow simple fucking protocols to get their house in order and put something on the field

oh and a division rival were currently leading benefited immensely from this move

zach gelb then tries to bring up the current covid19 situation and people losing their jobs because of the ongoing pandemic like hes not lucky as fuck to be a sports broadcaster and that if dumb fucks like the titans continue to disregard protocol the shit that keeps him employed shuts the fuck down and hes one of those out of a job

so my question is who asked zach gelb for his opinion how fucking pathetic are you to post a minute plus long rant about someone being unhappy with a major change at their fucking job because another organization caught covid19 then did shit like continue meeting disregarding protocol and more does this dumb fuck not see the god damn irony in saying big ben has nothing to complain about because of the current situation while complaining about his complaints

oh yea and because of the titans look at all the major changes the schedule for week 5 has to go through as well oh and the steelers didnt really get a bye because the game wasnt delayed until friday after the team spent all week preparing as if they were going to play because the nfl doesnt have any fucking back up plans for a team does something as insanely stupid as not take covid19 seriously
aw stop it zach gelb enough of you

there are people who actually have reallife issues this year people losing jobs people losing loved ones people getting diagnosed with this virus and testing positive

and i have to hear zach gelb complaining about big ben
im so bored of this formula

a player is asked a very specific and direct question by a reporter

player rolls eyes and responds

quote is then shared without any context as if the player is just shouting it from the rooftops and hoping people hear
never heard of her must be a bengals fan
this two time superbowl winning qb whos been in the league for 16 years thinks he can speak about the nfl
so

not important enough to say through the media big bens opinion of his professional situation in the time of covid

clearly important enough to say through the media zach gelbs opinon of big bens opinion of his professional situation in the time of covid

makes plenty of sense

zach doesnt get to fall back on its his job to spew through the media because thats also part of bens job so much so that when players dont spout they even get fined for it
what an asinine argument lol fuck that idiot
zach gelb never heard of him some schmuck trying to get attention by shitting on popular players with dumb takes get this great value mark madden outta here
lol that reporter is an idiot

this is their job that we have decided needs to happen i love football and missed it im glad its being played

but the players are also allowed to express their opinions and unhappiness when things happen the nfl hasnt planned well enough to play in the midst of a pandemic theyre still people regardless of if theyre getting paid millions or have access to good healthcare
by his logic isnt he wrong for complaining about a guy complaining when theres worse things going on in the world
who is zach gelb
the dude has 6000 followers on twitter hes literally nobody
also it was not a normal byeweek they were practicing up until the announcement as if they were still playing as normally schedule such a dumb take
zach gelb looks like mason rudolph after being stung by a dozen bees
when will people realize the sports reporter hot take doesnt give you anything more than temporary ratings

for example espn has basically become the hype and hot takes network and they are losing viewership in droves and are ready to layoff a bunch of their workforce because people got tired of the nonsense

always providing nothing but hot take gives a sports reporter 15 minutes of fame but then people realize that kind of behavior makes the reporter look childish and immature quickly ending those 15 minutes in a cold cold way

the sports reporters who quietly do their jobs and give informative analysis are the ones with staying power and are more likely to be seen as an authority of the subject in the eyes of others

edit to add and off topic

by the way it was refreshing to hear kirk herbstreit and chris fowler call an nfl game without them feeling the need to hype every play and player chris collinsworth on nbc can learn from these guys and realize that not every player deserves the line thats what makes name such a great player after they make a good play sometimes just call a good play a good play and move on no need to spend the next minute hyping the player andor play

just call the game and stop artificially hyping it we know if something worth getting hyped up about happens were watching the game too
lol his take is laughable he must not have even listened to the press conference
what a moron i cant imagine the amount of pain he is in after a season at his age of course he should be upset about the bye week its a crucial recovery week for players
well you know what they say about opinions everyones a yadda yadda

hard for anybody to have a good passer rating when they have 4 guys in their face before they finish their drop back
shoutout to the browns
but every game thread i have been reading how our cbs have gone downhill and are constantly getting burnt s

i think the steelers will win on a walk off field goal
i think its going to be a lot closer than we expect while the eagles basically have no receivers we are known to play down and our offense hasnt quite hit their stride yet its going to be close
it feels like we always lose to the eagles im shook
i think the steelers will win on a walk off field goal
i just want a win preferably a blowout for once but ill take any kind of win
i think the defense will hold them to a performance similar to week 9 against the rams last year
60 chance of rain
453
e
i dont think the bye is gunna help us necessarily but who knows i do know we seem to play every team close regardless of skill level so i wouldnt be surprised if it didnt look similar to the giants game we will probably control the gamehave a decent edge but still only win by 10 or less

2113 steelers
are you unfamiliar with ben coming off a bye week
close win or loss 2320
i dont think we blow them out but we should get the w i just cant help but think how much this feels like it could easily be that classic steeler let down game
i really hope for a solid w it would lessen my anxiety for the expectations i have but in all reality steelers win 3124 playing behind most of the game
steelers win 2723
3114 ertz hurts us early but we adjust
i think edp445 is going to continue bashing the eagles and thanking the steelers for kicking their shit
we are going to start off very slow go into the half 13 6 defensive td on a pick 6 then turn it up in the second half with the final score 30 13
as much as i love conner injury seem like they love him just as much so watching the games from last season and the sprinkling that weve had of snell i thought he was gonna take over after conner he runs with heart and power but the fumbles are a problem now watching mcfarland dude is so explosive so just curious who you guys think gets plugged in of conner goes down
is it just me or does benny seem really small this year
after connor and yesthis is kind of a cop outbut i think they will see who has the hot hand snell brings power and toughness mcfarland brings speed and agility

if snell could learn to hang onto the ball i would prefer him as the feature back over mcfarlandjust for the ability to power throughlike bettis but all that is for naught if he is a fumble machine

edit in short snell reminds me of a bettis type runner mcfarland reminds me of a dwight stonewillie parker kind of runner
nobody outside conner is nearly talented or reliable enough to be more than part of a committee so nobody is the answer youre looking for
me
if it was one guy probably snell because his build but itd likely be a committee
i wish wed see more of mcfarland tbh he is fast as hell his build doesnt scare me hes the same size as miles sanders

probably to play fbspecial teams like hes done before since derek watt is out

not weird many coaches travel in packs you work together at xyz university then get firedleave find new job and bring others with you or one of them gets a job and brings you with them its been ths way for years for many staffs in college and nfl its a very small fraternity that seemingly values loyalty sometimes over capability

just read a tweet from mike giardi where he was told by tannehill that the titans lost faith in the testing process like motherfucker you assholes were holding unsanctioned practices when you were supposed to be sitting at home
so now reports are they held an unsanctioned practice the day after they were told to shut down how is the nfl not stepping in and punishing them they deliberately shirked the rules and have negatively affected two teams class organization my ass
thats just gross negligence now
grown men can act like babies sometimes
like really how hard is this shit everyone else is doing this shit working shit jobs for no money how are these guys having such a hard time playing a fuckin game
itt

some points made that seriously make me question how those people havent been taken out by natural selection by now

credit to my buddy kevin we went on a boat ride around the city and got this wild picture
herewego

edit turns our utopperh2 does have a reddit account
cant wait to see the guy who does the wake up mother fuckers posts here in a couple hours gets me rock hard every time
peta going to be very mad when we destroy the eagles tomorrow
this is an especially serious game let us remember what happened at the last matchup a complete disgrace for us eagles ran the game from start to finish that memory gets erased here with a blowout win
awesome photo
thats a great picture
oh mama im in fear for my life
from the long arm of the law
lets fucking go
lets gooooooo steelers fan here in california
great pic i stole it and it is now my cover photo on fb

2020puffs cigarwhat a year its been
imagine explaining this to someone in 2015
bert from sesame street will be handing the ball to oscar the grouch
just three years ago they were fighting for the division against each other 3 years
is joe flacco an elite quarterback

frankly i think it is hilarious
what even is this year
elite handoff am i right
im new i dont understand


fourtime super bowl champion randy grossman
the rabbi was a definite favorite from the steeler dynasty

no finer head of hair has ever graced the inside of a football helmet
reminds me of when i almost bought an ab jersey a few years ago and the store i go to didnt have it in stock they claimed they interstore transferred it but it never came in

lucky for me since he had his meltdown shortly thereafter and it all went to hell lol

saved by the miscue
how did you do that i want to do that to mine lol still have my ab jersey sitting around
grossman had some clutch third down catches in sb 13 to keep drives alive that ended up going for scores great hands tough underrated
he was one of my favorites growing up had some big catches and could block too
its off center and i cant unsee it
can someone explain to me why you cant just buy the numbers yourself wtf nfl

my favorite defensive player to watch probably in steelers history dude is relentless
me and tj have the same birthday

til
i think that means were getting at least 3 birthday sacks
does anyone else hate it when they see its these dudes birthdays like bro can you stay 23 forever please
watt will have 3 sacks today
i saw a news article that tj is not playing because hes injured thats not true correct
its his birthday and he gets to be paid to hit wentz all day

lucky
we share a birthday
eagles fan coming in peace to wish one of the best current players on defense today and happy birthday and hope he doesnt kill carson if hes lined up on mailata god bless his soul

hoping for a great game today steel bros
i hope he for his bday and mine murders some eagles qbs figuratively of course

edit apparently its a bunch of others birthdays as well good times
hope he gets a pick six or a sack
birthday boy with the sack
nice one sacks per quarter would be appropriate
all the eagles ol out there giving him birthday hugs how sweet

it hurts me to my core that the nfl punished players as hard as the federal government for the horrible crime of gasp smoking reefer

no much better to keep them pumped full of pharmaceuticals so they dont notice their brains being completely hammered into putty until they cant think straight in their 60s
he always reminded me of randy moss his acceleration and top speed for being that tall was insane

im sorta surprised now that pot is legal in nfl he has not signed anywhere
so sad but at least steelers always draft good receivers
claypool has the potential to be bryant and better i hurt for bryant i really do but lets be thankful and hopeful with what we do have
he could have been a hofer so much god given talent
he was the definition of playmaker
dude was a touchdown machine
we got claypool
dont worry we have claypool now
if this country ever decides to take mental health seriously and legalize cannabis this man would have never had an issue dak prescott was incredibly brave to come out about it which is why his injury today was extra brutal bryant deserved better and some guys just cant stay out of their own way because they are either incapable or dont have the support around them to make it happen bryants failings are a product of society just as much as they are a product of his own poor choices josh gordon is another example
dont do drugs kids
there was some talk a week or so ago on this site about claypool being a reminder of bryant only better first quarter today certainly drives that home
he actually did what dionte tries to do
he was a goddamn football player
he was so freaky athletic amazing athlete absolutely amazing
would you rather

a make history in pittsburgh turn your name into a legend make millions if not 100s of millions of dollars have just about any woman in the world

b smoke a ton of weed
who is that and why are we sar
i think he is missing a 1 on his jersey isnt his name mapletron
i forgot he existed to be honest between bens injury bell and brown leaving and bryant ive been kind of disengaged watt and claypool bringing me back in tho
the rules suck but seriously you give me that kind of money and the only thing i have to do is not smoke easy choice
hey guys i think we found a suitable replacement
i watched that 3 times before realizing i was watching it loop and i was not upset
very reminiscent of ahem chase claypool
chase claypool is everything martavis bryant should have been
hes a free agent
could have been great it really is heart breaking that he never was able to get his demons under control
tomlins arrogance is to blame years of having a top tier squad and nothing to show for it but postseason disappointments and historical ownage by the patriots
mike tomlin and wasting talent name a better duo
fuck him chose himself over his team

love the argument of he was struggling with addiction but weed isnt addictive

want to smoke weed play by the rules lobby to change the rules but play by the rules
complete straightline route runner also not that great hands even some of those catches he looks awkward trying to catch it over his shoulders his rookie year was the aberration respect for the production he did give us though

do you mind answering a couple questions from a season ticket holder who opted out this year

how did you get picked for the tickets
was the resale value crazy high because there were only 5000
how was the atmosphere was it similar to a wpial championship if youve ever been
how did they decide where you had to sit i assume they werent you normal seats

im sure it was a surreal experience but awesome also


you married your daughter is that legal
she must be really small to fit up there

i know hes a beast after the catch but shouldnt we be protecting him by putting mccloud out there
did he get injured on that last return

and yeah idk
dj does punts rayray does kos been that way since game 1

looks like pnc park during a normal pirate game

totally meant heinz field but my father sent me this from one of his old fraternity brothers at the game i would honestly love to go to a game like this
im just happy to see people back in there tbh i would love to get my hands on some tickets but they are probably so fuckin expensive
were there a lot of people or was it crowded i wanted to go but was kind of concerned
looks like any pitt game on saturdays
it wouldnt be surreal to see firstenergy stadium like this
removed



bookmark this nflbitecom
the shots of heinz field with covidlimited attendance reminds me of normal bungles games ive seen

i hope they stay amazing after this game
eagles are really good
no local stations broadcast the games here anyone have any ideas

to be fair the steelers have been getting some help from the stripes to this point
wow
these refs have been terrible making bad calls against both teams but i agree most but not all of there bad calls have gone against the steelers


hes a very small guy and nfl football is a violent game hes got his shiftiness to help avoid hits but he isnt a burner either so defenders can line up their shots wo fear of being out run gotta assume hes always going to be battling injuries andor hes going start wussing out of contact even more than he does now leaving meat on the bone on plays
insult to injury
somehow i havent seen this meme before and i love it
started him over claypool hes legit cost me two fantasy wins oh well i hope this isnt a pattern thats developing

so when does juju start picking fights with ben freezing his feet and complaining about his football helmet
hey ill take a td however we can get it my fantasy team is hurtin tho come on juju
juju plays team ball i think hell be fine

and again
and again
i fucking love this meme format so this made me audibly laugh hysterically
so much yes
and his third
im fucking convinced the universe is always listening i was completely unaware of this video until someone at work brought it up today as well as unaware of the turnout of the game for you to post this is just too much of a weird coincidence for me right now lol
kinda looks like him

you spelled goat wrong
steal of the draft

ben loves his big receivers and so do i
nut


that was quick take my upvote
congratulations that was fast lol
this announcing crew is one of the worst in awhile
james franco harris lmaooo
what about steelers oc andy richter
a legend nobody knew existed until today
vilma is probably the worst announcer ever
it took all of vilmas 3 remaining brain cells to realize how badly he fucked that up
i like when he said wentz was looking for wentz down field
that was somehow not even in the top 5 most awkward flubs that came out of vilmas mouth today
that was such an awkward moment lol why did he even think thatd be funny
it was so awkward wouldnt have been if they had just dropped it lol
james franco is it true you guys are starved for a new thing to hate

raiders yes

james franco then why dont you feed them
i dont get it
fulgram is tearing this eagles defense apart vilma

fulgram went undrafted drafted by the detroit lions vilma

oh and the idiot vilma called darius slay derrick slay twice
cant stop giggling
thats a wonderful photoshop job my dude
yinz break yinz break forevaaaaa
the mistake wasnt that bad anybody could let that slip it was the cringe worthy recovery that hurt
strawberries
lmao
cant even think about franco with dirty heads popping into my head
a true hall of famer
well that didnt take long lol
vilma was giving some interesting commentary
awesome
heartbeat its a lovebeat
vilma was a nightmare to listen to his attempts at being funny were horrible just stick to calling the game
vilma did an amazing job calling the saints game last week this steelers game not so much sadly
i thought that blunder was funny but how about the black announcer saying he loved eddie van halen and van halens music now i understand there are many black people who love rock n roll metal and eddie van halen but not that guy suspect at best

i didnt even know points went up this high
means nothing if they cant hold the lead need defense to step up
i know it hardly matters but it was getting a little annoying hearing it on the radio
nah now theyll just frame it and say theyve only scored 30 pts once in 23 games
gotta get that opening drive touchdown next week and shut people up about that
winning shootouts count double in the standings
removed
it always seems to me that refs try to keep a lot of the games close
the pi calls have been terrible for both sides so far in this game

theres a game on
going to be a no for me
no dont be surprised if they resign him hes already said hes not chasing money and has seen the whole grass isnt always greener effect happen to multiple guys
what do you think is going to happen after this game now that claypool had a breakout game and juju did relatively nothing what do you think is going to happen when claypool starts to draw double coverage

you need two good receivers lets keep him on the roster and use him while we can
no
boo this man
no
no
pay him for the right price plain and simple if some team wants to overpay the shit out of him let them
juju will resign for 15 million a year steelers trade james washington for a 3rd round pick in the off season
no really really bad take you need multiple deep fast threats you saw what happened when juju was without ab the first year and didnt have ben to help shoulder that responsibility

x200b

you get rid of juju ben retires in 2 years youre fucked
first downvote of the week youre welcome
no not unless he demands absurd money hopefully he wont but if its anything remotely reasonable we have no reason to get rid of him hes an excellent wide receiver and depth is what you need to win
absolutely not we are all in on winning this year so it would make no sense unless we got a good player in return but theyd need to learn the playbook and everything besides juju is still making an impact and wed lose insurance incase we caught the injury bug at wr
haha haha no

you do realize we get a comp 3rd round pick for juju his services this year are well worth waiting one year for that pick

if we traded juju in season it would need to be for a 1st round pick

we might even be able to trade him after the year on the franchise tag for a pick

im not even saying we need him this year but even as depth hes worth more than a third

maybe some words bc im lost




too bad they played like shit today but hey a wins a win
a pick that should have been a batdown

4th down and they catch it gave the eagles 50 yards or something
missing the birthday boy that caused the pick
minkah needs to be traded immediately

i still remember steelers nation getting angry over that pick
sounds like he is the only non running back to ever do it
some so who were the rest
not a bad group to be associated with to put it mildly

i wish i trusted anything in my life nearly as much as i trust kevin colbert drafting wide receivers
chase claypool
can we get a wellness check on that guy that benched claypool today
dear chase i feel like i can call you chase because you and me are so alike id like to meet you one day it would be great to have a catch i know i cant throw as fast as you but i think youd be impressed with my speed i love your hair you run fast did you have a good relationship with your father me neither these are all things we can talk about and more i know you have not been getting my letters because i know you would write back if you did i hope you write back this time and we can become good friends i am sure our relationship would be a real home run
if you ever feel stupid just know doug pederson tried a 57 yard field goal at heinz field
folgers fullgham who the fuck is that this was far too close but lord almighty we got the dub lets get into it

good

ben roethlisberger hes a gamer man theres no way around it he redirected chase on his 4th td right up the middle holy christ its good to have the kind back

mapletron welcome to nfl eh what a game a bullshit opi is what ruined the ultimate day but wow he came to play such a weapon a big bodied dude thats tough to defend we got a good one

pre snap motion its just a different offense than anything weve seen even putting claypool in motion draws enough attention we heard so much about the influence of matt canada and we can see that now lots of movement

an offense that converts points off tos is such a refreshing change of pace from last year getting 7 of steves int is what helps out so much we missed that last year shoutout to big fucking ben

bad

third down defense jfc where to begin we could not get off the field to save our life man have got to do better here thats the only reason this game was so damn close seems like the longer the down and distance the easier it got so frustrating

refs again pure garbage on both sides this was as bad as ive seen them man

wasnt the prettiest but raise your hand if youre 40 bitches ill take the wins any which way we can get them no easy wins in this league fuck you fulgham

claypool folgers coffee bitch ass wr

who ride
the last time the steelers opened 40

the pirates won the world series
ill take the heart attack every week if we keep winning
chase claypool is my dad
chase claypool just schlonged their secondary
40 baby
claypool with 4 tds but spiritually 5 because the refs stole one from him future hof
the fact that claypool looked that good even when facing slay is really promising we got a special one right there
alright straight up fuck these refs
my god that was pathetic officiating for both sides smfh

so injuries idk about yall but its very concerning to me seeing ben grabbing his arm hes doing the same thing as early in the season last year

dionte has to be smarter with his plays the guy has the talent but he fucks up a bit too much keep him away from returns too mccloud is doing better and i dont want dionte getting injured which keeps happening unfortunately

decastro got injured again too and while that fucking sucks too im at least content that our depth seems ok to handle it dotson is capable


defense was all over the place and our secondary was getting torched by fulgham as always we never seem to coast on games ever lol smh last time i felt we coasted was 2018 against the panthers so like steelers could you please fucking stop with the coasting

alright positives and i only want to talk about one


chase fucking claypool

mapletron the god


he is a monster my goodness utterly dominant
can someone let the officials know that their face masks arent meant to cover their eyes too

anyway take the w and go 40
claypool with 4 tds as a rookie despite a phantom opi call steelers with a 40 start for the first time in 40 years crack a yuengling and crank renegade
perhaps it is now time for the torch of pennsylvania to be passed to philadelphia for wentz to take up the mantle of quarterback of the keystone state

tuitt sack

then again perhaps not
claypool is a stud our secondary needs a lot of work those 3rd and longs were dangerous
chase claypool was so good that even the refs were impressed
the reality is the defense has not begun to tap their potential we got glimpses of it in the second half of the texans game we will need to develop into that type of defense consistently to contend for a title

we should be excited that the offense is breaking out it isnt complete yet but its getting better

on one hand this is the least impressive 40 team ive ever seen but they have a tremendous ceiling

remember in previous years we play like this and start 22 and those two losses come into play late in the year for playoff seeding

look at how many times the patriots started slow and clunky but were undefeated or only had one loss somewhere around the halfway point and had a huge advantage for seeding they found ways to win those games thats us this year hopefully winning even while we are not hitting on all cylinders setting ourselves up for something bigger later in the year when every win will absolutely matter for seeding
best rookie wr ever
lets worry about the defense tomorrow

todays all about chase fucking claypool
holy fuck
eagles were a legit team i know their record doesnt show it but their defense is absolutely nothing to fuck around with im upset with our secondary but other than that i dont have a ton to complain about at the end of the day a win is a win
the eagles are in dismaypool
worst officiating ive ever seen but a dub is a dub
gotta catch a quick nap before work but game was closer than it should have been refs did an awful job for both teams but we also had a bunch of dumb calls on our part putting haden on fulgam happened way too late in the game and we sacrificed the secondary far too much to bring pressure on a quarterback who could get it out quickly and easily thanks to poor coverage

still a win is a win and claypool showed up big time this week onto the browns unless the covid19 gods decide to smite our week 6 broke 30 points this week boys

ill smoke my victory preroll after work to get a really good sleep after my first overnight shift
fuck the refs fuck the flyers and fuck philadelphia in general west pa best pa
chase mother fucking claypool
lol do you think claypool ran out of td celebrations
raiders just beat kc
on the brightside sanders broke off that 74 yd run ended up with 80 total and 94 as a team
jerry rice wears chase claypool pajamas to bed
i love the delusion over in the eagles sub they think the refs handed us the game when it was trash calls that benefited both teams
defense had an off day and the offense stepped up and bailed them out love it
post the ref picture with the trash can on fire
stat sheet says 4 td but i saw him in the end zone 5 times

letting one wr score that many times is a serious problem youd think after the 2nd td they would try to lock that shit down pretty embarrassing for jim schwartz
the nfl has obviously tweaked how the rules are being interpreted by the referees to benefit the offense so there is more scoring they pretty much quit calling holding at all and theyve increased the pass interference calls on defense this is in addition to their usual calling the games in order to keep the score close to make the league appear more competitive than it actually is bottom line is the nfl is very poorly run and designed with greed as the number one goal instead of making sure the games are called fairly if that game was called fairly then the steelers would have won by at least two touchdowns but the league doesnt like that scoreline they attract more viewers and make more money with close games
word is that chase claypool is being examined for a strain in his back from carrying that entire fucking game
that was a great game until it wasnt and then it was again ggs boys now lets flush the browns
well it was ugly but the offense won a game for what feels like the first time in a long time
our defense had some lapses but the main reason that game was even that close was the refs and their total shit calls they took at least 2 tds away from us for bs calls they were atrocious and if im tomlin im calling them out post game
refs were fucking terrible and they can go fuck themselves but our secondary has to play better the game threads make the secondary seem much worse than it is but theres definitely been regression
sanders had a 74 yard run in the first quarter he ended the game with 80 yards rushing
the pittsburgh heart palpitations
chase claypool dad dicked the iggles long hard
mapletron is born
chase claypool can fuck my wife
me thats the scariest movie ill watch all october

week 6 steelers hold my beer
ben was solid chase claypool is my new bff defense looked asleep at times not sure if that is partly due to coming off the unexpected bye week but at least they looked good on that last eagles possession thank god this wasnt a really good team or else they would have taken our lunch money today gonna be a long stretch from here on out but if we stay healthy and come to play i believe in this squad
this was one of those games that was bound to happen and will happen again the defense cant win andor close out every game really happy to see the offense can step up and close things out when they need to
the best part of this game was juju and james washington going all in on the sticky ball celebration carrying it all the way back to the side line
we have the best pass rush in the league not doubt but what the fuck happened to our secondary
we gonna talk about terrell edmunds being the best player in the secondary today or is the steelers reddit not ready to have that conversation yet
lets go boys maple syrup on me
if you dont like that you dont like steelers football
only thing that matters is 40 boys
wentz isnt a bad qb so im not surprised he got back on track just didnt expect it would be against us
an ugly win is still better than a close loss lfg
this was the most anxiety inducing game because all of my friends are eagles fans

today is a good day
game down to the final few minutes blown 3rd down plays on defense win by 2 points

classic steelers football wins a win and im happy with that
i hope johnson is okay
we have to keep juju for claypool if that makes sense its a good 1 2 punch
going into the season i knew chase was tall and fast but after watching the first game and seeing his body control on the sideline catch i knew he was going to be special he has the best body control ive seen since ab in his prime he could have easily had a 5th touchdown today
chase claypool
claypool best wr in his draft class change my mind
need a chase claypool up vote party
never in doubt bois
my heart cant take anymore
on 10112020 chase big dick energy claypool hung 4 tds on the philadelphia eagles making the first recorded stunt on these hoes in the 2020 season
fuck the refs
40 for the first time in 41 years
this is the beginning of the chase claypool for oroy campaign
claypool went off great game for the rookie
petition for pittsburgh to secede from the us and selfannex to canada
member how we usually lose to bad teams im glad this didnt happen
well never get it but the nfl needs to address the officiating in this game piss poor
i wonder how many years of my life ive lost being a steelers fan
yay we won fuck the refs
claypool is a beast and probably our new 1 in my eyes


ben played great and had 0 interceptions


defense didnt get any pressure

ebron needs to clean it tf up with the drops hes a te though

and obviously

fuck the refs
overall nice win although there was a point i thought we were going to lose the gimme game

nice to be 40 although we havent played the ravens yet

claypool is great idk how the steelers can always find these wr deep in draft

the refs were absolutely awful i feel like there were so many penalties
4 and mf 0 25 perfect gotta love it not easy to win games in this league but its easier with big ben keep flying under the radar of the rest of the afc i like it
i wonder how much travis fulgham going off had to do with zach ertz catching 1 pass for 6 yards
5 sacks 21 qb hits best steelers front 7 since 2010
my opponent started claypool this week pray for me
without a doubt the defense needs to play better putting teams in 3rd and long is supposed to be a good thing for the defense but we can never execute in those situations i hope butler or tomlin starts to address this shit but idk

ben and mapletron carried this fucking offense today both solid performances im so damn happy about claypool and that we have him on our team hes going to be great and i cant wait to watch his career
im happy ben is playing so well and chase was amazing but our defense is scaring me a bit
once just once i would like us to put away a team by the end of the third quarter so i can unclench my fist before the game is over

i know im asking for a lot but my heart aint getting any younger
some of the steeler fans on twitter are so insufferable people like mark madden and company will go to any lengths to trash the steelers regardless of success its almost like these people arent fans at all do we have some work to do on the back end of the secondary absolutely its early in the season every team has things to work on its like if this team isnt absolutely perfect every sunday they complain regardless of outcome and then trash the fans that are actually excited about the win and the great game some of our players had
40 bitches
lfg
did vilma watch the game we really couldnt run the ball worth a shit
mapletron good
40 just need dj to stop breaking himself and our receiver corps is gonna be unstoppable
welcome to the al bundy club chase claypool
this game gave me a killer headache wtf is wrong with this defense
this was the first game where the defense let us down and ben had to step up and win it
happy cake day tj
now lets watch the raiders trying to win and the browns game
if the raiders make this first kc loses
mother fucking chase claypool league is on notice now
what the fuck happened in the chiefs game
west side best side that is all
i love this team but watching them play is stressful as hell itd be nice to have a few games thatre guaranteed wins
this claypool guy might be good at football
my friend cowboys fan hasnt seen if of our games just asked me is we could go undefeated this year had to do a spit take
guys i dont want to overreact but were going to win the next 3 superbowls
watching this from over in melbourne and stayed awake until 4am for it claypools effort made it all worth may just stay awake to watch the other games now im that amped
i never thought i wouldnt see days of our steelers in my inbox by week 5
wonder what was said to juju to get him so upset when he was on the ground
since we won i can say this it was kinda nice for the hometown guy to score even if he was playing for the enemy
i feel like the offense bailed out the defense today

hard fought game great w
you cant guard chase claypool the secret service couldnt guard chase claypool
some of yall are so fucking cancerous in the game threads man
yall gotta realize that the refs kept the eagles in that game eagles are tough but every team plays the steelers like its their super bowl the steelers weathered the storm and kept pushing forward the biggest takeaway from this game is that the refs need to be reviewed weekly and evaluated and penalized for terrible calls
nothing is as miserable as the game threads guys people are going to score against us people are going to make bad plays refs are going to mess up calls please stop overreacting to everything when we let up a td there is at least 10 comments saying the steelers are going to lose the rest of the season relax people
i will stop saying clay chasepool i promise
dak prescott just had one of the worst ankle breaks ive ever seen
of course the week i drop claypool due to lack of usage he pops off for 4tds and johnson gets hurt again
steven nelson and minkah seem like they are regressing in year 2 with pittsburgh almost like they had good talent last year and then they realized they are on the steelers and our secondary is a sieve half the time minkah especially where is his aggressiveness he had last year our scheme has him just sitting in zone
we want myles garrett
that was almost terrible
not a great win but we take em where we can get em 40 is huge lets hope they figure out why wentz was able to move the ball so easily hope some of you guys can chill and enjoy the entertainment we wont go undefeated just so yall cant maybe have better expectations
we are on our wayyyy here we go
that was a butt clencher
offense needs to be more aggressive defense needs coaching
i missed the second half can someone summarise in 10 words or less or as a haiku poem cheers

also im on my phone with shit signal so i cant check stats what did claypool finish on
claypool is my first childs name now
i love crunching out these wins
i missed seeing the td pass to pouncey
watts injury really affected the secondary without him firing on all cylinders were an above average unit with watt were top tier hope he can heal up
beautiful w although im concerned about bens deep ball hes been overthrowing everyone this year
he could id give him 4 years
chase is ab plax
was hargrave in this game i remember he signed with the eagles did he do anything in this game he said he wanted to sack ben lol
i couldnt watch the game how were the refs terrible
big ben is quietly having a great season 10td to 1int and 7 in the nfl hes played 1 less game than most other qb on the list past years i feel hes thrown more ints
great sunday for us

now im wondering who had it worst today 9ers vikings or cowboys fans im leaning towards cowboys i wish dak a speedy recovery
is it just me or is it a guarantee that we blitz when hilton and edmunds both line up over the slot seems way too predictable
gotta tighten up that 3rd down defense bigtime this team has given up so many 3rd and extra longs its gonna lead me to an early grave

they blitz on 1st and 2nd downs getting them to the 3rd and longs then come 3rd down the dont blitz and they drop into a soft zone the pass rush doesnt get there in time and theres always someone wide the fuck open

this team is built to play man defense i know why theyre doing it when you play man all defenders backs are to the qb who can then take off and run theyve played a bunch of qbs capable of a decent run

but to treat the likes of carson wentz like hes god damn lamar jackson is ridiculous blitz on 3rd downs play man on man get off the fucking field
finally home after my first shift and gonna smoke that victory preroll cheers
i love that we won and im glad to know we have a new stud wr however im pissed at myself for benching him in all my fantasy leagues
im tired of clenching my butt but im not tired of winning
missed the end of the game last night due to family obligationscanadian thanksgiving did watt come back in the game is the injury serious or will he play next week
if the second half of the texans game gave me confidence in our defense this game did the opposite we have the talent to win the superbowl but we are being held back by two subpar coordinators
what a wild 180 from defensive to offensive powerhouse why cant we just have both in one game whatever a dubs a dub lmao
i say it every week this team takes years off my life
i dont get why people are so mad when people point out that minkah is regressing

he was a dpoy candidate last year and looked like the best safety in the damn game he looks nothing like that this year it doesnt mean hes not good anymore but hes definitely not that so far
cowboys fan here in peace why the fuck was yall safety ejected after just one helmet to helmet hit there was no ejection called by the refs i learned from the dude who announces the red zone channel and was like what the hell
damn fullcum really destroyed our secondary today also most of those pi calls were absolute bs and ruined my enjoyment of the game wentz sucks ass i was hoping they would keep hurts in the game but holy fuck mapletron is good im really happy for him today my dad is an eagles fan so ive been texting him shit all day
can we get a new offensive coordinator his play calling is painfully obvious thank goodness ben is playing like an all pro
in the battle of pa the fascists lose well done boys fuck the refs fuck fascism
juju thanks for everything but i think claypool will make you expendable heading into next year
nfc least is so bad why do i even hope the eagles could beat yall ravens will of course win this division but i really wish it didnt have to be this way sweeping the division in order to win the division is distasteful to say the least it really looking it will have to be the ravens to set yall selves straight
great start to the season the team looks really good and mostly complete things are looking really up
als can go f itself hopefully there is a cure after the ice bucket challenges

hey bro american living down under here my partners family have been trying to recruit me to the roos but ive been drawn to the tigers due to their color scheme and i loved marlion picketts story during the grand final last year

the 4am steelers games are the worst i always wake up with so much anxiety
when i took on a project in melbourne and was commuting back and forth from pittsburgh every 2 months i became a dreaded collingwood supportermember for the season and a friend let me join his coterie managed to catch them being knocked out in the preliminary final at the mcg then made it back for an early season steelers game the following weekend the jet lag was killing me

when working over there i was pretty surprised at the number of locals who were hitting me up for fantasy football advice

havent been able to follow the pies as closely back in the states and ill warn you that the beer is a helluva lot more expensive at heinz field
pittsburgh born and raised adelaide crows fan
are you me haha also from sydney and love the steelers up 3am4am every game dont like afl as much as nrl but go for richmond black and gold

for those that dont know moats has a podcast where he does great indepth analysis of the team twice a week he offers very good view point having played on the team and knowing the scheme

i definitely recommend it
when i hear this being said from steelers fans i will ignore it but when moats says it i know he has actual knowledge behind it he isnt simply being reactionary and he does a good job of explaining things i will have to give this a watch

damn straight
hell yeah brother cheers from canada
good for him

i was thinking about this the other night its so nice and cool to see juju celebrate his success compared to when juju had success and the last star we had threw a bitch fit bringing in these quality men who have a team first mentality is just a nice change of pace to what we were accustomed to for so long
first of many
i ordered a jersey right after the game i needed a new one since ab went full ab
i wanted to get blackout

i love this guy more and more with each passing day
5 touchdowns he was fucking robbed
tomlin really knows how to develop receivers
if you havent watched it already heres the link to his interview on the pat mcafee show

dudes awesome
hard to argue with 4 tds
aaaaaaand i had him benched lmao
well deserved one of the best performances by a wr since julios 300 yard game in 2016
well deserved that didnt take much brain power on the part of the awards committee
remember all the dont get too excited nfl draft jagoffs in this sub lmao
mapletron is a cheat code as our 4 wideout
how he wasnt a first rounder is beyond me but since hes on the steelers im definitely not questioning it
no surprise here totally deserved
i mean of course this whole thing would be a joke if he didnt get it this week
he was very offensive
does this make chase claypool the second person to ever do it
because hes really good at playing football
whats up steelers fans chase is a dog happy to see him find his footing now within this offense i just snagged him up on the wavier wire how do you guys expect him to play in offense for the rest of the season i know juju still a threat so hes gonna get his share and targets just would like to know how you guys think i should play this in fantasy
primus sucks
how quickly can he learn how to play qb can he just take over once ben retires
antonio who
the argument for leveon was always about guaranteed money the way that pittsburgh structures its contracts it is very rare that the team will ever have a large guaranteed amount for the deal bell having at that point played his whole career for the steelers and gone thru various injuries wanted to protect himself against any injuries he trusted his skill level to keep him on the field and wanted a contract that would allow him to get paid big bucks without the possibility of being cut if things went sour

when it comes to the steelers offer before he left the team reportedly wanted to give him 47 million over three years the guarantees of that contract may not be known but its safe to assume that he would have been interested if it was fully guaranteed the steelers also reportedly offered him a five year deal worth 70 million at one point heres the thing though this wasnt a deal offered by the jaguars or dolphins this is the steelers a team that very rarely cuts a player in the middle of a deal big name players especially due to injury on the contrary especially with its homegrown talent the team sticks by its players for arguably too long at times and it even does unthinkably kind things like keeping a player who lost his career due to injury on the books shazier stayed thru his whole contract getting paid his first round salary and taking advantage of the doctors and insurance

bell left to go play for the jets for a contract that could have paid him up to 61 million with incentives the guaranteed portion that was so important to him was 28 million bell got his guaranteed money after sitting out a year and missing out on the 14 mil from the tag it was debatable at best on whether or not bell lost money from the standoff but if the guaranteed money was the only thing that mattered than bell got what he wanted

now bell has been cut he leaves the jets with all of that guaranteed 28 million but no more he signed a deal and trusted a team that would give him the guaranteed money but apparently the trust of anything beyond that was unimportant to him the moment the team realized they didnt want to pay him a penny over the guarantees they cut him while a team like the steelers tends to play things a year or so at a time often restructuring deals for the better of both the player and the team they still hold on to said players for the entirety of the contract way more often than not

bells agent is quoted talking about how pittsburghs contracts do not guarantee after the first year and how bell was all about the guarantees


no matter what that final number was and i am certainly not saying that what has been reported is accurate because its not quite franklythe most important element of it is the guarantee you couple that with the traditional way in which pittsburgh does its deals which at the end of the day nothings guaranteed after the first year


bell got his guaranteed money he received his 28 million what he may not have fully understand or what his agent didnt want to accept is that even if the contract doesnt guarantee every penny a steelers deal is more trustworthy than almost any other if the reported 70 million deal offer from the steelers was real it had 30 mil in guarantees meaning more than the 28 million he received from the jets if he had signed the the reported 47 million deal over three years from the steelers than today bell would have made 47 million dollars by now with a team that likely would have stuck with him thru low moments hamstring injuries etc one could also argue that the steelers oline was perfect for his patented style of running and hed be still on his way to canton instead of looking like a washed up old player

but regardless of how well he has or hasnt played regardless of whether the jets or the steelers were the better fit bell trusted the guaranteed dollar sign on a jets contract and walked away with that and nothing more over a steelers deal that up to this point would have paid him 19 mil more than he left the jets with

bell was once an alltime type talent drafted in the 2nd round he has made more money with the jets than anywhere else earning that deal based on on the play with pittsburgh but now that the dust has settled it seems more clear than ever that the guarantees of a class organization is better than the guarantee on a contract from an organization that has been in shambles for decades
i completely agree and ive said it a thousand times to my friends when he left he would have made more money with pittsburgh without fear of being cut

what was the complaint that so many fans had with this team when it came to its aging stars that they kept them too long

answer me this why would the steelers offer him such a big contract with his injury history if they didnt plan to stick by him that right there shows a lot of faith but here we are
well said

i keep seeing a lot of steeler flairs on rnfl wanting him back too i may be in the minority but i dont want him back would it be nice to have a s pass catching rb absolutely

but he really hurt the locker room when he kept saying he was going to report and he never did its not easy to earn that trust back and we are 40 and dont need that distraction

i dont get why people want him back or wanted ab back last season none of it is conducive to our success anymore
why do you think the steelers offer rolling guarantees in the first place lev bet on himself and it didnt exactly work out but he also very easily could have dakked his ankle on the tag and gotten zilch this sub loves to talk about the business of football and business decisions except when players make them
this was a good breakdown and thats not even counting the 145 he lost by sitting out


i think something that you might not be factoring in to his decision was his poor relationship with the franchise in respect to the treatment of ben roethlisberger it was widely reported after the purge that both bell and ab were out spoken about the hypocrisy in how ben was treated as apposed to the other stars of the team and i know that it didnt work out great for either of those two since leaving but even troy polamalu spoke out about this and said it was the reason he wouldnt come back to the team in any official capacity until ben was gone
i recall seeing that the steelers had offered him a better deal matching his guaranteed money that the jets offered and against his agents suggestions he chose the jets now i definitely would have wanted him to stay but he was upset and didnt want to play with ben anymore reportedly i can understand that i just dont think that the organization isnt somewhat culpable for the breakup ab and bell both left mostly because of their relationship with ben and his separate rules troy in my opinion is the gold standard for steelers and the steeler culture and he said that its not right too thats why in the past two seasons ben has been making a conscious and public effort to be a better leader and inviting more then just the oline to his house for fishing trips and getting closer to his recivers and rbs so im just saying not all the blame on bell for his departure most of it just not all of it

tldr
yeah bell bet on himself and lost but the steelers had some culpability in the breakup mostly bells fault but partially the steelers
thats a shame
again i will always be biased but if i was a player who played for the steelers im taking a cut to continue doing so if it comes down to it

give me a class stable and successful organization over the hypothetical money of a garbage one
he made poor business decisions and lost a ton of money im glad hes gone and i dont want him back the end
this is the steelers a team that very rarely cuts a player in the middle of a deal big name players especially due to injury

wait we cut vets all the time though usually ones in their 30s

im happy bell got paid always have been his business sense has always been questionable as he spent most of 2018 getting bad information on whether to stop holding out also hes not done yet hes going to sign somewhere for the minimum in 2020 and id be surprised if he doesnt play in 2021 on a new contract also he spent 2018 not earning money but also not getting banged up rb earning power isnt age as much as the career carry count

im just as happy we didnt sign him 45m3y 70m5y where would we have come up with that cap space thats like haden and nelson money or duprees tag
hindsight obviously in retrospect it looks like a bad decision but he didnt know he wouldnt get a gurleysized contract he didnt know his best offer would be from the jets and playing behind their oline would tank his career he didnt know he wouldnt tear his acl he made a bet and lost i dont really fault him if anything i fault his agent for not knowing the market better or maybe his agent did know and bells ego got in the way who knows

i guarantee if bell had the steelers best offer and the jets offer in hand he would have taken the steelers but thats obviously not how this works
yep hes an idiot
really well put hard to believe he threw such a fit over guaranteed money and this is the result really short sighted

havent watching him since he left but his numbers look like garbage any idea how much he has left in thr tank
what a homer


steelers couldnt cut shazier cuz of injury they would have had to come to an injury settlement


how many of your wr over the years have you guys paid

bro who lives in pittsburgh and isnt a steelers fan thats just wrong

as someone that has lived most of my life in atlanta visiting pittsburgh a few times for some games i cant imagine not living there and rooting for some other team

reminds me of the guy who runs the falcons sbnation blog he apparently is a lifelong bostonian when you ask why the hell did you become a falcons fan for the pain and misery he says he was a kid rooting for the bad patriots and liked the uniforms lol

shame

time to humble yourself young blood our oline made you tough to dance around in the backfield when you got a trash oline

if ben was fine with it id definitely call up bell hes still getting a check from the jets every week and so id offer him a one year deal on the minimum only one year come back and finish this season in pittsburgh and split carries with conner hed walk again in the spring but playing with ben this year is his best chance to look good and regain some value as a fa this spring

while still getting his guaranteed money from ny he could play for his old team whos undefeated and looks to be a super bowl contender itd be a short visit but it could really be his best chance at a ring at this point in his career

we have cap space this season fuck he could take a 4 mil deal and can still cut him at a moments notice if he makes a scene

x200b

personally if he becomes a cancer id permanently use one of the 2 extra roster spots this season and have him ride the bench not even letting another team swipe him from the practice squad
yes lmao pretty much every team would sign leveon bell for a league minimum even if you arent crazy about him thats an outrageous deal
im not against acquiring talent for league minimum contracts but the steelers offensive line is currently tied with the new york jets in run block win rate 23rd in the league this isnt the same offensive line that bell had in years past with the steelers
love leveon but i think that ship has sailed
leveon bells record producer just posted 412 on instagram take it for what its worth
jets didnt eat a shit ton of money for nothing i am going to stay awayfar far away
for those who voted no to league minimum get real i wouldnt really want him getting in the way of developing talent but for the minimum he can get some reps
yup
hell yeah or even more i still love leveon and would take him on my team any day
i would but i would have to cut someone from the rb room
yes and he wouldnt walk into the team either hed be having to prove himself and adapt to the new system first
for the league minimum sure hed split and take some load off of conner im sure hed get some jeers from fans but wed warm back up to him eventually
any team would if theyre getting a leveon bell that wants to play i hope that team isnt the chiefs
for the league min anyone who says no is nuts
stop it get some help
for min yeah

would he do it for min nope

dont get me wrong i would love to have him back however i dont think it happens for a few reasons and the biggest being that he forced his way off his previous team thats a whole lot shit that this team doesnt need right now tomlin said it first a while ago we need volunteers not hostages directly about bell like bell has shown to 2 teams that he isnt going to volunteer and be an all in guy for us he had production but no money for the jets he had the money but no production we offered him the chance at money and production with the one caveat being stay on the field he chose to walk away from this team and i dont think i see him eating crow to come back let alone do i see tomlin taking another hostage

its funny because the jets team color is green
ive seen gilbert interact a lot with our boys on instagram i know damn well he misses it here

rnfl everyone is trying to get away from the toxicity of ben and tomlin and the steelers just look at bell and ab

everyone except bell and ab
harsh but fair
he knows all too well
on the flip side almost anywhere else he lands will be better than the jets
that guy got pancaked more than a sunday church special at i hop i do not miss him
removed
stop
honestly my mind is blown that bell had seven wins with the jets i would have guessed three good on him

were getting six seasons and a movie of this show right

man i love bud seems like a great guy going to be sad to see him go but he deserves to get paid

so instead of talking about the 40 steelers against the 41 browns first take talks about the myles garrett incidentyeahhhh theres a reason i dont watch that dumb ass show anymore
who
you just realized this

edit regarding max not mason
max kellerman is a dumbass

in other news waterwet
to be fair kellerman has a history of saying stupid stuff and exceptionally bad takes across teams and sports im not at all surprised he would make that point
dude is a hot take machine thats all if he said something like dak prescott deserves to have his ankle destroyed i wouldnt be remotely surprised

its the broadcasting equivalent of being an edgelord just saying stuff to get attention

dont know if he means what he says or not kinda dont care hes just trying to hustle page views and thats going to be his platform hottest of hot takes
i just listen to sports podcasts now anything on espn is a mistake
is anyone on espn not a dumbass i stopped watching espn several years ago there are a million other ways to get your sports fix twitter specifically and this sub satisfy my need the steeler depot guys and gals do a fantastic job on twitter best steeler coverage period if you ask me
first take lul
dumbass doesnt even begin to cover that
why do you care about what max kellerman says




i was watching a chase claypool interview with pat mcafee and claypool says ben is really specific in what he wants from his receivers and after any play that he didnt feel right about he goes to his receivers and says hey youve got to release this way and break out this way i feel like big ben doesnt get enough credit in helping to develop the receivers thoughts
a lot

things like the reporting showing ben audibleing is that a word multiple tds for claypool last weekend are immeasurable
he certainly is a nice factor but there is no way to know for sure we have no idea what the wr room does 6 days of the week but whatever it is it works every year
i give credit to ben and hines ward

i feel that ward set a tone of over achieving by working hard doing the little things in game and before and having fun playing the game that has persisted through the generations of steelers receivers
definitely quite a bit you dont see very many other elite qbs turning their wrs into absolute stars
am i having a stroke or was this posted in the last 24 hours
i think after watching last season we know the outcome of wr without big ben
how many do good after they leave thats your answer

have you seen our run defense we gave up a 75 yard run and they still rushed for less than 100 yards
you didnt know we had a good defense my man where have you been the last 3 years

color rush chase claypool jersey i gotta get me one of those
browns are screwed lmao
fuck cleveland
i wonder what will prevail your color rush vs our orange pants
anyone else wish they would wear the block numbers more often also i loved those jerseys they reminded me of the steel curtain era im really hoping they pull them out soon

fuck myles
hunt said he bonded with his teammate over their suspensions hunt was banned for the first eight games of 2019 after he pushed and kicked a woman in february 2018 and punched a man in june 2018

class acts right there cant wait to shut em up on the field
meanwhile cam gave this answer

honestly im not angry i look at last years tape both home and away and i see what they did well what we did well all that other outside noise what transpired doesnt matter to me

ben gave this answer

roethlisberger on myles garrett hes a generational type football player hes a guy you have to know where he is hes a game changer hes that good

and tomlin said this

were not looking for that lowhanging fruit or realitytv storyline

yeah theres just a little difference in our franchises wouldnt you say
this really doesnt make any sense to me at all how would this win be dedicated to someone who tried to club a person in the head with their own helmet mason wont even be playing not to mention myles came out and said that hed be willing to have a sit down with mason

edit spelling
this ones for myles like he didnt hit a dude in the head with a fucking helmet
dedicate a game to someone who committed an assault then lied about being called a racial epithet to save face thats so browns
cant wait to watch vince williams run him over
kareem meet blitzburgh
as a lurking browns fan i agree that is just a terrible stupid comment to make what happened happened and i desperately dont want to see a god damn fight break out kareem needs to just shut up and play football

fuck kareemwoman kicking cunt and myles smollett here we go steelers lets dish out some justice
browns fans are fucking obsessed with a guy whos not even playing on sunday
classy as ever
oh i guess i forgot about mason rudolph ripping off myles garretts helmet and slamming it on the top of his head in last years game and claiming garrett called him a racial slur and then backpedaling when no proof came out that actually happened

wait wasnt it the other way around
oh poor kareem i foresee 18 carries for 46 yards and a fumble
fuck myles fuck the browns and fuck you khunt
woman beater wants to win this one for his friend that assaulted a qb and then lied about being called the n word
why is the kicker talking shit
shocker human filth hope we take this bums head off this week ya know for the girl he kicked in the face
i like how garrett said he wanted to talk to rudolph man to man about it after he said rudolph called him the n word mason should tell him to go fuck himself after the game

garret is a liar
they better hope that ben doesnt say this ones for mason
funny how a guy who beat and kicked a 19 year old girl and then tried to play the victim by saying she used a racial slur would support a guy who basically did the same thing can we just rename the browns to the clowns
oh its gon be like that eh grabs popcorn
the cleveland browns are pathetic
good good
tf like myles was the wronged party in that incident lol man they dumb
my eyes are rolling so hard i feel like a slot machine


juju and that knee dnp every week

what do these acronyms mean is dnp do not practice
think johnson will play this week
any news on decastro

if were gonna lose one of these games at least let it be to the titans could not stand losing to either the browns or ravens
hopefully we can grab at least 23 in this stretch
i dont think hunt can run on us and mayfield struggles under pressure our defense played well against lamar last year and this time we have an offense that can actually score the ravens struggle when theyre playing catchup my biggest concern is the titans henrys size is something you cant scheme against and tannehill could exploit weaknesses in our secondary
out of curiosity are you in a different country 6 am start times would be kinda crazy
this stretch scares me but if we can get the division games id be ok losing to tenn the next run of games plays in our favor
sounds like a 70 team to me
even if we drop two of the three were 52 which is a solid place to be halfway through the season
ravens are the biggest threat obviously

titans im not that worried about after seeing how they beat the bills weve got the defense to shut down the run game and regularly keep pressure on tannehill who relies heavily on king henry and getting enough time to make a play happen so long as we arent over committing to the rush well be able to keep their ground and air game in check

browns dont have the defense to bring our offense in check and with guys like claypool really starting to come into their own if our offense gets off to a strong start i dont think the browns have what it takes to make our defense pay and give up the game to them

ravens have a solid defense and an effective offense but weve seen the gameplan for how to shut them down kill the run force jackson into the air and if at all possible keep them playing from behind because jackson doesnt manage pressure like that well and overreaches for big plays that arent there hoping to make up ground faster than they need to

we cant play sloppy with nonsense penalties and lazy coverage zone has always been a weakness for us and our secondary has been suffering because of the blitz this season we drop a man back into coverage keep a spy on jackson and actually put an emphasis on our own pass game i think we can take the ravens

after this stretch people will either finally realize yea the steelers are legit this year or well be dismissed outright until its playoff time i have a feeling people are gonna be forced to take us more seriously and well cement ourselves as a top five team with deep playoff run aspirations

last year at this time we were 04 or 14 this team is truly explosive and talented on both sides of the ball lets knock off that last bit of rust and let everyone see why we like it this fucking hot in the kitchen
just curious what your 6 am game day looks like any traditions do you ever go all in with food and beer and friends or is it more like you eating cereal and drinking coffee with the game
i could see us winning all 3 but i think the most likely scenario is that we beat the browns and titans and then lose in baltimore but not by much
so if we win these 3 were officially all on the superbowl hype train right because im beginning to believe
3 14 pt wins bakers dozen sacks we go off w henrys head im sorry ms jackson
i think were lucky in that we match up well into all three our defense should be able to contain their run games and im not sure any of those qbs can beat us through the air still all three could go either way
steelers fans were gonna win a 7th super bowl
same fans well be lucky to win a game against a good team
yes i am a little worried going into these games i wish we already played the titans and had a bye before ravens but such is life
time to get buried in the comments

i think out of all of these teams we match up the best against the ravens as their weapons out wide are pretty meh weve been hurt over the air all year but weve been efficient at stopping the run once we can make lamar take off we can snipe him and make him run around we actually have one of the more athletic young lbs in the game who if he cant keep up can keep lamar from running roughshot over us if our pass rush cant get there i predict our offense will be on schedule with a big play here and there and some good sustained drives i predict 3121 steelers

the titans have been having a really unexpected string of success derrick henry had become the father of more than just josh norman over his career and i can only pray for our dbs however i think that besides him simply being unstoppable after he gets going we match up relatively favorably against the titans their defense is okay but not great and got thrown all over by gardner minshew and their receivers i believe our passing game is altogether superior to jacksonvilles i think that the titans offensive line is very solid but tj and bud along with a very solid push up the middle is hard to keep take in any situation if derrick henry gets rolling itll be a long night but if not i think we can easily outscore them 3528 steelers

and the browns it pains me to say this but the browns have a really good matchup against us here itll be hard for us to get claypool the ball deep with myles assault with a deadly helmet garrett rushing the passer and our shortintermediate game is good but not great our defense would be facing the most balanced offense weve gone against yet though baker is still very up and down even with elite weapons its hard to say here but the browns might be the team that gets the better of us here my prediction is 1721 browns
the browns being a threat is further proof that 2020 is the year the hell portal opened
loss win win

potential 3 wins here
im cool with 23 wins if its the browns and ravens
lmao i was seeing the exact same thing today and had the same reaction i was like holy shit cancelling that game wasnt so bad after all then realize well play against titans 2 weeks from now then ravens after that
agree 100 according to profootballreferencecoms formula the steelers have had the easiest strength of schedule in the entire nfl for the first four games of the season
i think we can go 60 but i doubt we beat the ravens on the road
mostly afraid of the titans here honestly browns and ravens will probably be split 11 just kidding 160
tomlin teams always have a stretch of losses 16 18 and 19 we all lost 3 in a row hopefully we can make it through this stretch with at least 1 win and stay healthy
the gauntlet begins
one game at a time fellas and gals

brownies week
coming out of this stretch 52 wouldnt be a bad thing
i dont get it i see 3 easy wins
win against the browns if we dont play down the other 2 will be close but we can win
im cautiously optimistic with the upcoming stretch yes weve beaten all bad teams with losing records however for years we have played down to losing teams we lost games to bad teams that we should have won and in those years we played the good teams tough so perhaps this year is the year weve turned things around with playing down to losing teams and we end up beating the teams with good records as well so cautiously optimistic
as gene krantzed harris responded in apollo 13 channeling his inner tomlin when someone said it could the worst disaster nasa ever experienced

with all due respect sir i believe this is gonna be our finest hour
dont blink
mayfield seems like a nice kid and id like to see the browns become competitive but i dont see them winning in pittsburgh the d is going to be on baker like stink on stinkbugs
so this aged well
i hope the players are not like the fan base which has completely given up on us standing a chance against the ravens i hope the players leave the titans to fate but start working on dismantling the birds showing up strong mid season has got to be a priority for coach t and the squad i know ben wants it more than anyone because of the pressure that would be lifted off his shoulders this is not the time to flinch fuck the ravens
fuck cleveland
im excited to see us play this stretch either we will play well and i can have legitimate super bowl aspirations or well play poorly still be 43 and know where we stand and what we need to fixand still have legitimate playoff aspirations
i dont care if theyre 41 were still gonna beat the browns
watching from hawaii
i see no problem with the next few games we havent been playing down like usual we got this have faith
not looking forward to that 6am game
never thought our first test of strength would be against the browns texans had a good offense last year too the good news is almost each one of our games we had the ball back often in scoring territory when we took a knee to end the game
jazz music stops
please tell me ops geological location is the reason those games are scheduled for 6am
this is going to be a tough 3week period

im nervous i think we either go off and beat the shit out of all three or we go 13 and manage to beat the browns via some sort of baker blocks his own pass for a safety fuckuppery and trudge on from there
eh 52 wouldnt be the worst i think well end up 61
30
i kinda think it was a blessing to not have to play titans bc i dont think we wouldve played our best game against them yeah they were 30 but no one really took them seriously until this week when they beat the bills pretty convincingly
tough upcoming schedule

we dont care
man im glad im in the us those kickoff times are brutal haha
idc what anybody says were beating all of them and the league will soon understand just how much of a championship contender we are
as a steelers fan in cleveland i really hope we win to shut them tf up

youre wishing death upon people because they support a football team from a different city

take a break from the internet for a while
huh

ha
should get him aviators and make him only say tomlinisms

slow down those reps and ill cut your eyelids off

we dont deal in cardio and things of that nature

the standard is the standard
if you lose just buy a haden to troll him a small bit 40 on nflshop for an authentic
way i read this whoever wins wears a steeler jersey everyone wins

except cleveland

edit op didnt explicitly stipulate that hed have to wear a browns jersey
he should have to wear a mason rudolph jersey

oh yeah
damn tj had me convinced for a sec too its those crazy watt eyes man
tj showing off those acting chops he picked up from hosting extreme tag
theres always a little truth behind every joke im sure the watt bros are tired of hearing about the other watt bros
whats this from
removed
this is what like the fifth post about this

hes not getting thrown to at all its not his fault if qbs dont throw his direction yes he needs to improve some things but hes fine
mods can we start automatically banning posts like this
hes playing well just defenses are not targeting at all

when the defense gives up plays its usually a lack of communication from the rest of the dbs


watch arthur moats on youtube about this he talks about how the steelers are playing more man and the lack of a preseason seems to be causing fitz to stay in his lane more hes not gambling as much so not jumping routes as much itll come with reps

also qbs are not targeting him so theres that
please read through the subreddit before making a post this exact same post has been made about 5 times in the last week

minkah is playing fine hes rarely being thrown to

levs like that hot girlfriend that you broke up with and cant resist the idea of getting back together with even though you know she is a nightmare
he takes the vet minimum im gameour backs currently are terrible receiversadding him as a check down option is unstoppable
this ship has sailed a long time ago i dont see it happening
early reports are showing hes choosing kc
i have nothing but respect for him he did amazing as a steeler and left with with little drama all he wanted was more money which is fair since the nfl is a business if we could get him back id be all for it

that being said its just not possible unless hes willing to take a far smaller salary than hed want we dont have the cap space especially with the cap potentially getting smaller next season who knows what will happen but right now it just isnt possible sadly
ab is a free agent too why not reunite the band
i miss the killer bs
those days r over
he did his teammates dirty no way steelers ownership brings him back i dont care of its for a vet minimum contract
man had jukes for days
is he going to play on a vet minimum contract and try and win a super bowl sure if its anything else as much as i love to watch healthy bell run im more than good with connor taking the handoffs
damaged goods while the steeler line would open more holes for him than the jets line ever could hes 3 years out from playing in a steelers uniform and being the player he was if they signed him it would have to be for a low salary with incentives he would be a good sign for many teams that have a line and a qb of any value but i dont want to see him back not the way he left maybe go to tampa and catch some short passes and run third down for tom brady should do well there
that oline made him
i want him back obviously not at an absurd price but im not sure he will command that the jets are an atrocious organization from top to bottom its not surprising he wasnt happy there and didnt excel

the team we are looking at today wont be the same next year snell needs another year or two to learn how to carry the ball and conner is another few carries away from injury bell will help this team win be a receiving threat out of the backfield and hold on to the ball if the price is right bring him back
no please no i like benny better and connor is number one stop looking thru the rose tinted glasses id rather ws not emotional combacks besides guys in the locker room most likely dont want him we have no problem on offense why the hell would we want to bring in a potential problem
if the team accepts him i have no issues with him still got tread on the tires
1what position would you guys like to see us take in this years upcoming drafti know i know its really early but i still think it needs to be addressed personally i would like to see the steelers take a qb big ben is playing great but realistically he only has two more years until he retires let me know what you think

2 personally i think mike tomlin has been a great coach so far for the steelers hes been here for 13 years now hard to believe and hasnt had one season below 500 the main blemish id say he has was when he stepped in front of jacoby jonesclassic you cant really blame him for what happened with leveon bell and ab they were just jackasses and the super bowl loss to green bay in 2011 was still a very tight and contested game overall id give tomlin a solid b coaching grade what would you guys give him
pick 32

a
depends on bens playing if he keeps playing like he is and we dont draft to help the team win now its just going to be a waste id say we need to draft an elite offensive lineman villanueva has really been a weak link lately
1 offensive line villaneuva is a pending fa but will probably retire decastro indicated he is retiring within a couple of years feiler is a pending fa we cant afford and pouncey said he will retire with 7

outside of them we have dotson a future starting og hassenauer a backup c wisniewski a backupstopgap iol okorafor and probably banner

we may also need replacements for any of the several major fas we probably cannot resign williams hilton conner and potentially juju as long as ben is under contract a highround qb is a luxury until then pittsburgh needs to protect him with a good oline and a solid run game

2 tomlin is a future hof coach him harbaugh belichick carroll and reid all are most coaches would dream of 88 seasons as rock bottom hes been elite in the face of adversity yet still has minor blemishes as all the previously mentioned coaches do if anything the major factor standing between tomlin and multiple super bowl wins over his career has been the new england monolith and sometimes baltimore with few exceptions no head coach has seriously been in contention for multiple lombardis outside of belichick

tomlin gets a solid a from me
usexmayonnaise will give him an f for wearing a white shirt when the team is wearing black jerseys
ol or dl

a
time to rebuild the olineour next qb aint coming from the draft at least not for a few years
hard to say because im not too familiar with the class but just looking at the team and free agents i would love to get a lt seems like the clearest need to me at this point especially with av and feiler likely out the door

id give tomlin an a results are results even if some of his game management leaves something to be desired ceostyle head coaches are hard to judge their impact but hes clearly doing something right
1 probably draft a db ot edge wr and maybe a dl for depth

2 a second highest winning percentage of active coaches hes really good
oline we have to get the best talent available that will help us win now and set us up for post ben life

as for tomlin solid a
1a cb our depth isnt great and our starters arent young hilton is strictly slot and possibly heading off to get paid sutton seems positionless more than a solution for cb layne is still raw im worried were going to see some decline from a starter by the end of the season or at least warning signs

1b ol depends on whos still out there when we draft but i think cb is more likely feels a little less urgent than cb with banner chuks and dotson stepping up and i think well be drafting too late to get a top prospect with no major questions

2021 wr seems top heavy theyll be gone early in round 1 and we may as well wait until day 2 like usual

if we win a sb i think ben retires and well have to trade for a qb instead of trying to find something at 32 maybe dalton or mariota can bridge us to a 2022 rookie otherwise its another year of ben and that contract extension

x200b

2 a if belichick wasnt running around ruining everything by padding his stats i think tomlin would have a case for best coach in the league i think 2019 and our adversity answered a lot of questions kc kryptonite aside i think taking the 2019 ravens to ot with a combination of mason rudolph and devlin hodges at the helm is the most incredible loss ive watched
at a late first round pick you probably arent picking up a qb that is a guaranteed hit and sure fire successor to ben besides look at our wr corp we dont need a surefire big ben replacement etc we could easily pull in a quality game managing vet and well be fine someone that makes the throws that need thrown and doesnt turn the ball over

and really if you look at the numbers right now that is what ben is doing he isnt passing 50 to 60 passes a game right now he isnt putting up 500 yard games or even 300 yard games but he is making the throws that need thrown and not turning the ball over its all we need until we can find or develop a qb in the draft we can be confident will be our next franchise qb

remember we didnt have a true franchise qb between bradshaw and ben but we were still relevant many of those years even with neil odonnell kordell stewart and tommy maddox because we didnt go after a qb and waste picks on a lot of busts we got the best team we could get and we didnt reach

as for what position i would like to see it is clearly the ol we are getting older up front and pauncey is probably going to go when ben does al seems to be deteriorating with age dotson seems like he will be a starter in the future but we really need to make sure we have ben covered his last years and to set up whichever qb we have in the future

it wont do us any good to have a great qb if our line is a sieve if you need evidence just look at cincy with burrow getting pummeled this weekend and with daniel jones and other young qbs with shitty ols not being able to develop you cant learn the game getting knocked on your ass nearly ever pass attempt
ol and rb i say we draft
1 ol
2 a
probably whoever fell low enough in the draft that we determine should have been picked sooner with what i will assume to be a later pick best available is the most likely option

with that being said for some incredibly stupid reason if kyle trask slips down far enough i hope with every ounce of my being we snag him up
i dont see a giant hole for next year unless its left tackle for now im assuming its okorafor and banner dotson looks like a starter so the oline is set for the starters but all of our depth appears to be gone

filling out depth with picks seems the way to go next year and we will definitely need it with our expected free agency losses
first round ol or dl going to lose a bunch of players need to solidify the foundations

tomlins grade c his sb appearances were a decade ago no one has done less with more over the past 10 seasons too many embarrassing losses to comment on
we will draft either a qb ilb ol or safety depending on whos available
oline or olb in first rb in second

a im still disappointed that they didnt accomplish more with the stinging bees but the only other coaches in the league i would be comfortable replacing him with would be belichick reid shanahan or zimmer

i usually try to temper expectations on rookies but theres something about claypool that feels special cant wait to see how the rest of his season goes

not much in the way of player mics basically just vance going wooo a couple times
he seems to be doing really well this year

our o line was decent against an elite d line last week

who will be blocking myles

what are your thoughts
if we could sub mason in for a drive to try and get him ejected for the year again that would be great their depth is pretty weak at that position and one masonled drive wont kill anyone as long as his forehead is still made of titanium
they move him around a little bit but he lines up mostly on the defenses left side so hell be going at chuks at rt the majority of the time im sure av will see some of him too and even some of the guys on the interior

hes been on an absolute rampage all year so i would assume theyll give chuks some help either with a te chipping or keeping a back in to help with that said the steelers have been using a ton of quick passing game and id bet youd see more of it
hell definitely give us problems hes waaay too good for us to completely shut down but if the o line plays well enough to try to limit his impact ben is good at releasing the ball quickly and that cleveland secondary is meh
ben is getting the ball out faster than anyone else in the league this season the browns secondary is trash i wouldnt expect a ton of problems from that asshole
mason is gonna sew his helmet strap so theres no chance of it coming off
myles cant cover chase
as much as i hate him hes very good and will definitely cause some problems throughout the game hopefully our defense just causes way more problems
villanueva will be trying to block him hopefully theyll also chip with a tight end or back garrett is probably our biggest worry on sunday
just pray for av all week lol hes been struggling against myles ever since hes been in the league ive seen him get blown back into ben within 3 seconds repeatedly but the helmet game they actually did an okay job stopping him so well see ben has to continue his quick passes from last week
im expecting a lot of shotgun snaps with the rb aligned to the side that garrett is on nevermind having mcdonald helping to block the edge

i expect well be using a lot of short checkdowns to tes and rbs to try and mitigate the damage

bens going to have to be real careful with the football cant be having fumble issues
i havent had the opportunity to watch him a ton but i really dont think hes going to be wreaking havoc all game especially with the offensive evolution we are seeing a pretty shocking evolution to boot
not unless hes got a helmet in his hand

yea i saw that and thought uuummm weve had 3 in 51 yearssoall of them

cowher had a line that gave me goosebumps after bob was fired he said i really hope that bill now realizes theres a lot more to running a team than just wins and losses
i was only a small kid so i dont remember cowher at coach so ive known only tomlin my whole life which means im biased towards him over cowher but noll is still the best
noll tomlin cowher
i was just thinking about this but has any team had three hof coaches in a row i mean at this point i feel like tomlin will get into canton maybe not first ballot or whatever but hes damn good
this question presents a problem few if any fans can truly grapple like steelers fans this is more a generational question being that weve had from 1969 until present day 3 coaches so most fans i would assume know at most two few three pair that with the play style and progression of the sport from 69 to now and it makes it even more biased by generation this is either a great question or one that will make me review stats and archives for the next while until i will conclude all of them are the best for their timeline
as much as i love tomlin he really has no argument over cowher 6 conference championship appearances to 3 for tomlin and he did that with journeymen qbs like odonnell and slash for most of his career the first 2 years he had a franchise qb he went 151 and won a superbowl
my incredibly biased and not fact based choice is cowher i just missed the noll era and became a big fan while cowher was at the helm
its hard to sort them out and rank themthere have been so many coaches through the years no stability

must be a very competitive league you start all from one team and your opponent starts two rb on ir
does your opponent not check fantasy starting ekeler and barkley lol

smh
this should be embarrassing for you
no
did you hit your head on something are you ok is this a cry for help of some kind
mods if you can please change this persons tag to tomlinsimp
i only simp for tj watt
blink twice if tomlin is holding you hostage and forced you to write this

anybody that doesnt like tomlin probably likes trump that speaks upon their lack of intelligence it is what it is

the boomers in this sub trying to act young
wtf is this
how can i unseen this

these two have the most amazing relationship and they fucking can play
interesting thing i learned ben asked tj to do the coin toss so he could be there with jj
these two really have some great chemistry together i loved this
hopefully this signals their intention to keep the duo together i have to think he wants to stay and might be willing to work with us

probably the most trash steelers wr ever
i feel bad for donte he went out there and tried to play through broken fingers and he got burned on that gamble
ole brick hands
props to op on the title i nearly spit out my coffee
didnt get make like 1 million per catch with us or 1 mil per target
wait where all the folks that want him to come back to us at s
john stallworth just tweeted legend
if he wasnt a top 4 or 5 wr on the jets i dont know where he could be at least he fleeced us out of a few million last year he should be set
best looking eyes of any steelers receiver
my five year old son
whats the difference between baltimore raisins and baltimore ravens
you lost me at baltimore
i will never call them ravens again baltimore raisins forever
lol at raisins
california raisins yummy baltimore raisins yikes probably taste like old bay and heroin withdrawal


no its not
hes already getting paid by the jets so bring him in on a cheap deal for the rest of the year so he can build his value back up to get a bigger contract next year from somewhere else

if he becomes a locker room problem doubt it cut him

if he performs shittier than samuels cut him

at the very worst case hes still a better pass catcher than any of our other rbs and could be used as such no downside to bringing him in imo
i wish he had stayed he had a special career trajectory ahead of him and from that perspective he threw it away a part of me would love to see him suit up for the steelers again having said that i absolutely guarantee that were one of the two teams he has zero chance of signing with
honestly the fact is that bell is really good friends with connor still makes me think that why would he want to come to the steelers and take connors job in his contract year kinda fucked up
no its not time for him to come home the dude was injured half the time we dont have the same o line that can clear the way for him again and the dude is a me first guy all the way
no we are good
i think theres a potential for a lot of reward with a small risk if he could integrate back into the team without drama he wouldnt cost a lot and definitely adds depth

with that saidim currently happy that my kendrell bell jersey isnt confused as much now that leveon isnt on the team
frank gore who is essentially 97 rb years old debatably was better running behind the same jets offensive line bell is just washed up right now we have 3 running backs where the offensive line doesnt have to change much if anything to block for any of them bell doesnt know the offense and hes been hurt a lot no need to sign him
no
yes what a wonderful idea lets sign a running back who hasnt accomplished anything in the past few years had a drawn out contract dispute with us badmouthed our starting qb has a high cap hit and did i mention hes been hot garbage since leaving the steelers

besides its not like we already have 3 possibly 4 serviceable backs already on our roster

this is like saying that your ex girlfriend who cheated on you went on to catch a bunch of stds and crippling debt would be useful to you again and that youd take her back just because shes available

can we stop with these posts now this is like the 10th lets sign leveon post in the past 12 hours
we want playmakers not hasbeens

i hold a monster grudge against him and what he did i dont want his ass in a steelers uniform ever again mistakes were made by both sides back when a new contract was on the table but the team moved on he can do the same theres 30 other doors to knock on
just wanted some thoughts and opinions of how other steelers fans would feel if leveon were to come back to pittsburgh also how do you think the team would react
i couldnt fully grasp why he did what he did

because he thought that if he were on the open market and free to take contract offers from any team someone would offer him more money than what the steelers were offering

its time leveon bell comes home

hes from ohio so id rather he didnt go to one of those teams
just kidding fuck the browns
god i wish we were playing in cleveland so ben can regain his recordlol
you got me in the first half im not gon lie
fuck the browns
i would like to add fuck the browns and fuck scobee
when i have to do 2 i always say the cleveland browns are going to the super bowl
fuck the browns fuck miles garrett and fuck kareem hunt for backing miles
this is going to be a good game sunday im surprised they didnt move it to prime time this is going to be the game of the week
the brahns are goin dahn
anybody else happy the browns are winning games it just wasnt satisfying beating a 010 team
if youre in heinz field for the game please start a lyles garrett chant lyles garrett

please
for shits and giggles i decided to go check out their sub i hope they dont start charging us rent cause we are in their heads rent free at the moment
got me even though i know browns fans cant spell peace even if you spot them the p e and a
i was in ohio last week and saw someone repping a browns hoyer jersey such a depressing franchise when that is about your best jersey option
never have i been so offended by a single sentence
fuck the browns and things of that nature


also myles garrett gave me another reason to be glad my ex from ohio and i are broken up cant imagine having a calm conversation with her brownsloving dad regarding what a shithead garrett is
flush twice cleveland needs the water
hey come on man i love browns
i like that saying fuck the browns doesnt feel like we are kicking someone when their down anymore
haha came here to tell you to fuck yourself great joke srsly fuck yourself
i havent cared about a browns game in a long time usually when we beat them all you get to hear is that knowing sigh from a cleveland fan that expected nothing else but this year is different this year we can hear the sweet sound of shattering hopes and dreams
i knew it was gonna be this and i still laughed lmao fuck the browns
this deserves my wholesome reward

nicely done
just kidding fuck the browns

i take back my downvote
fuck myles
i love how optimistic browns fans are they really think this is their year theyve lost the last 16 games in pittsburgh but oh yeah theyre totally gonna win idiots
go long little brother
lmao
well played
fuck em
brown sus get him out
em brahns is jaggs
ill admit ya got me
steelers will make it a game playing the chiefs or the jets doesnt matter itll be stressful till the end can the steelers just blow someone out for once and let us fans have a nice relaxing game
please please can we blow them away just this once and 1 more time later this season thats all i ask and then we can go back to making it difficult on ourselves
lol omg
oh thank god

the fan coming in peace may be the worst part of this site and thats saying a lot
have the browns fans ever not come in peace or are they gonna play to win this week haha
no fucking peace
sigh unzips
someone give this man a raise
going to have to find a link not show here this weekend my youtube tv doesnt like spoofed vpn connections
lmao
dont kid like that
i see you all are pulling material from the rravens sub cute
removed
probably cause theyre not throwing near him like they did last year
possibly


looking at the stats hes on pace for the same number of tackles 13 ytd 50 in 2019 obviously no ints this year


but it also looks like offenses are avoiding him through 4 games opponents have only thrown in this direction 4 times
teams are trying their best to avoid him in the passing which means that when hes being targeted its because he or someone around him has already made a mistake it makes it seem like the proportion of mistakes in coverage is higher that said i saw something on twitter saying that when you chart his coverage work hes still doing a rock solid job in center field

the regression that i have seem to date has been his tackling hes not sticking the way he used to hopefully bradley and austin can get him back in gear
hard to get into when the qb doesnt throw the ball within 15 yards of you
ive been very vocal with my criticism of minkah this year but here is one thing i will say about him

hes known as probably the smartest person on the defense and meticulously watches film and takes notes even on his own time

even though he is not making the same statlines as he did last year his knowledge and football iq alone is high enough that he might be helping the other guys be in positions to make plays

i imagine no one is more critical of minkah than the man himself i promise a big play is coming
how so
let moats shed some light on the matter
theyre throwing to whichever receiver hes not covering

at the risk of downvotes i always find it funny how there is a keep politics out of sports crowd that seemingly is also the wearing military inspired sports gear crowd im all for supporting the troops and our veterans but its a bit disingenuous to say the military isnt political
i love the look of the gear but i still have no freaking clue what american sports has to do with their military
i like the breast cancer gear
love it all except the price
i dont mind it but maybe they should make some in honor of teachers and nurses also
i see a couple items everything else well it just seems to blend in
i always like it but i own nothing to be honest

the jerseys are the sweetest but too expensive for my liking
not a fan myself but anyone in steelers gear in any form is a friend of mine
ive never been a fan of the camo print gear it reminds of the mossy oak stuff i see people wear the spice brown and black gear is nice though
i thought the tie dye pride gear from last week was pretty cool too

edit went online to look for it found out it was for crucial catch still cool though
youre not a badass because you wear camo cletus you look like a dipshit
i always have my parents get me the sts hoodie for christmas every year i really love the look of this years
nice collection
ive been looking everywhere for that black bomber in a large but its all more expensive than it was before they moved to the next year
are the hats actually correct everytime i get a sports cap either the button on top is off center or the bill was off center
ive never been a fan of the aesthetic but i respect the hell out of it
wow i need all this stuff
stolen valor


possibly the most underrated player on our defense tbh seems like every time he checks in to a game he makes a play not easy to make a splash as a depth dlineman
my buddy is a huge steelers fan whenever he makes a play we say his name to the tune of the system of a down song ieaiaio
love this post this man is a monster on the inside

id be surprised if its not miami its all about the income tax savings
chiefs would be brutal for us in our quest for 7
it will be the chiefs best chance of winning he got his money now he wants to win

bell on an andy reid team will be interesting
this is some the decision bullshit
oh no s
i dont think we need any additional posts on the sub convicing everybody why we need him
bell in kc probably makes the most sense from a winning perspective he would obviously see less carries though with ceh there
not sure why there is any talk of a steelers reunionthey dont need a running back
just for fun my money is on miami
bell is about to make a fortune this year
let me be sure about this so the jets will still be paying him plus he gets another large salary from a new team is this correct
id like to see what he can do with the any of those teams but i feel hell end up on either miami or kc
seems like hes going for that revenge tour special with the bills and dolphins
sad boi hours

amazing work i love the style
i love it i was hoping you were drawing all steelers players every week so i could find my fave but i get it gotta spread the love around
your work is incredible
amazing
this is sick nice art friend
he went off
i wish i could draw like that
ayeee thanks for the new wallpaper
hey man thats an awesome style youre seriously talented thank you for sharing your work with us
this looks great
just went through your post history and checked the rest out theyre all fire good shit man keep it up

hopefully youll be making a few more steelers by the end of the season
your style is very very similar to mine i need to get back into drawing weve got so many guys id love to draw
nice



you dont get respect for beating the browns its the bare minimum of acceptability
did lebron really say this
you and i and everyone else here knows that wont happen its gonna be a onepossession game in the fourth quarter like the steelers love to do my father says its to keep the value of fourthquarter advertising spots high and if im a sixer deep sometimes i agree
big ben after he puts up 5 tds and blows out the browns this weekend

lets not get ahead of ourselves here the brownies dont suck this year so this game aint a given
i hope everyone sets their phone dialed to 911 once kickoff happens so all you have to do is click call for any major heart pains or pending seizures stay safe sunday my fellow steeler nation
might throw 5 tds but the defense allowed 6

when these things say the steelers will do well good useable intel from a premiere football simulation when these things say the steelers will do poorly madden sucks just a video game dont put any stock in it
fuck madden
to preface this this is so trivial and not important at all but i need some yinzer opinions i got a white road antonio brown steelers jersey for christmas in 2018 which means the only game he was on the steelers while i owned the jersey was week 17 against the bengals where he didnt play wore a big fur coat on the sideline and left at halftime we all know what happened after that i still have it along with a black block number throwback roethlisberger and a color rush juju jersey so i do have other options

but i dont know how i should feel about my ab jersey he rightfully so left a bad taste in the mouths of all steelers fans with how he handled leaving and the comments he made after i guess my question is should i feel okay wearing it i feel dumb for owning his jersey and my roommates who are cowboys and texans fans definitely give me a hard time for it all in good fun

but on the other hand he was undoubtedly a top 5 steelers receiver of my lifetime im 21 and i had so much fun watching him play for the 9 years he was on the team i dont feel like wearing a james harrison jersey would have the same kind of stigma associated with it and he did not leave on good terms at all either what are your thoughts is it okay as a steelers fan to wear an ab jersey

tldr i own a ab jersey but never wear it should i feel more comfortable sporting it on sundays

edit split up block of text
the steelers patch on the chest is more important than the name on the back they are not cheap wear the one you have buy a new one when you want to
antonio brown was one of the best at his position to play for the steelers unless hes credibly accused of a felony you can wear that jersey in remembrance of what he did when he was here

players come and go thats how it is
i got mine the exact same christmas i thought i had cursed ab but now i think it mustve been you

in all seriousness though you may get some remarks from people for wearing it but all that matters really is how you feel about it i havent worn mine but i feel like in 10 years when we have 34 more super bowls it will be fun to wear my guess is in the future the sentiment of the jersey will be man you remember how crazy that dude was wonder if he ever got help but man he was a heck of a player couldve rivaled the greatest ever had he maintained his sanity

edit im to in
personally i wouldnt but i wouldnt exactly admonish or insult someone who decides to its up to you ultimately
as long as he doesnt suit up for another team again we can just consider what happened as him retiring from the game youre good bruh noone is gonna fight you over an ab jersey personally thatd be my slop jersey the one im not afraid to wear when i go eat chili n shit like that
wear it with pride i got mine for xmas as well the same year so never got to wear it with him on the field as others will say the steelers patch is most important he was once beloved and i still have an uneasy feeling not seeing him there he was my favorite player and still is tbh no matter how unpopular that idea may be i still wear mine alongside my minkah jersey i got for xmas last year

edit i also bought a cheap block number lev jersey last year when he was long gone and wear that too its all about the logo
i bought a new nameplate for mine let me see if i can find the site

edit


i was lucky enough to escape purchasing one when my sports store failed to interstore the jersey a few weeks later the unraveling started and i dodged a big bullet
it will be fine in a few years after his memory fades
i wouldnt if i were you but you can keep it and get a new name plate for whomever has the number next

that being said i have learned my lesson in buying current player jerseys unless you know they are at the end of their career and retiring with the steelers no one is safe you cant go wrong with getting the jersey of a retired steeler
toilet paper
if you do wear it make it fun after ab went to the pats i got another jersey and while i was waiting for it to ship got delayed and i live on the other side of the country i wore it but made a few changes to it i got blue tape and covered up the b in brown and wrote a c on the tape also sporting a rainbow afro from the past halloween and white makeup if you dont get it it wrote clown and i dressed up as one calling attention to the fact that ab is a clown i have a friend who also was waiting for their jersey to ship so he covered up the b with tape and wrote a t over it and above the name it was a large jersey on him we thought hed grow into it but he never got the chance wrote out of so it said out of town after i got my juju jersey and my watt jersey i cut up the brown one into a bunch of tiny pieces still saving the steelers logo and stripes tho and burned those pieces in my backyard with a lighter the memory still makes me still to this day
i have a mike mitchell jersey so yeah just wear it if you like it fuck the haters
wear it for the fucking memes bro
some guy posted a randy grossman conversion with a name plate update do that or store it for way later its too soon for right now hes got sexual assault and being a douche bag allegationslawsuits still outstanding against him id be ashamed to rep a trash human being in public but thats just me
save it for a rainy day i have a good friend that didnt like football when we met he slowly started watching steelers games with me and became a fan i had a bell jersey and gave it to him during the 2019 season so hed have something to wear to watch the game it motivated him to order his own jersey he chose watt i find no fault in this
hes a legend crazy ending but he was the best for years
just get a custom nameplate with your name to switch out for brown
i sold mine when all that shit went down but i still own a james harrison one so idk
this is why i only buy jerseys for future hof players in all sports
i didnt read your wall of text but my thoughts probably apply whenever these threads show up


its a jersey just wear it lol i dont get why its such a big deal to people if i pay 100 for something then damn straight im going to wear it who cares if he went nuts the guy was a beast when he was with the steelers


hope hes healthy dont need any excuses from browns fans when they lose
pink eye
ecoli
too many ladies shittin on him
pls dont postpone this game bro i swear
hes got some sick moves
you would think that a covid test result works be included in such an announcement
that could be a huge loss for them owning landry in fantasy i am okay with it haha
was is it a sickness as in jeffrey dahmer or an illness as in having a cold
if this turns into another goddamn postponement due to covid it will be disappointing
shigellosis
this man was just streaming talking about where was bronny at like a day ago
ooo ah ah ah ah
his feelings got hurt
pls no i dont want 2 weeks of no football again
holy shit
anal fissures
okay guys i get theyre a rival and obj is a bit off the walls but if hes sick we shouldnt just make jokes at his expense especially since sickness can be anything from mild to severe

show some class
the last year beckham was a valuable contributor to his team obama was still president

i suppose theyll have to find some way to make up those 4 catches for 50 yards and no tds but im not sure this is exactly going to send vegas reeling
trump told you to inject the bleach not put it in your hair
trump told you to inject the bleach not put it in your hair

lets make a meme targeting the steelers backup qb

weak even by browns fan standards
cool are we still pretending tj watt isnt easily as good or better than garrett
i will pray for you
too bad yall aint going up against mason this time round yall going up against future hall of famer aka browns daddy big ben roethlisberger
imagine your organization being so fucking trash that yall still care about a fucking backup qb who got hit in the fucking head with a helmet by your dirty ass player move the fuck on dude
man got no comments or upvotes on the browns sub so had to come here to share his shitty meme
fuck you turd and fuck your whole turd team
lmao with this weak sauce go back to bed little brother
removed

no thanks id rather we draft our own guy when the time comes personally i especially dont want anyone the washington organization has had their hands on
why why do we have to do this shit every single time anyone at all is getting released

why cant we just accept that if it was a good idea in the slightest the fo would consider it

they arent its not
ewww

mods can we get a megathread for qb or fa signings
id rather keep justin layne and whoever we draft in the 4th

per reports the dude became complacent when he was named starter if the best he can do is be the starter for a subpar franchise for 1 year and 4 weeks he shouldnt even be on our radar
no thanks completely ignoring his terrible play he seems like a malcontent dont need bad tude anywhere near the squad
ben roethlisberger is gonna be the qb for at least 2 more years no thanks
name one successful osu qb
i have a hard time believing the people that post this shite are even fans of football let alone the steelers
fuck no
haskins is fucking garbage and has attitude problems to boot id rather start mason rudolph then see him on this team
why would we want someone who upon learning he was the starter decided to stop preparing like one per his coach a 4th is a pretty valuable pick
ill never understand why people get so butthurt over discussing hypothetical trades people act like youre insulting them lol

i dont think its giving up much but i think the timeline would be weird not knowing when ben is planning to retire
nooooo thank you apparently his work ethic is under question and he hasnt shown me anything to think hes a franchise guy

id take a flyer on darnold though
how many times do i have to downvote a post about this

in the bbc nature dudes voice

simply the thought of playing the steelers defense is stomach churning for the browns receiver he has to take a day off to gather his thoughts and hopes to return the next day to approach the daunting task at hand
thats good news if wants to take a long weekend that would be fine too
he hasnt tested positive he is just feeling under the weatherjust an abundance of caution kevin stefanski on sending obj home browns

this week we play our toughest opponent the 41 browns who also have the best offensive line we have faced last weak they played the colts who are the no1 defense and no3 run defense the browns allowed 1 sack and ran for 124 yards in a win

browns
sacks allowed last week 1
29th in passing yards per game
1st in rushing yards per game
4th in points per game
9th in sacks allowed 7

steelers
3rd in defensive yards per game
15th in passing yards allowed per game
2nd in rushing yards allowed per game
6th in points allowed per game
6th in qb rating
2nd in comp allowed
1st in total sacks despite only playing 4 games

this season
1 giants 3
2 broncos 7
3 texans 5
5 eagles 5

ive done this for weeks 3 and 5 so far we are 11 on our sack predictions

view poll
i pick 56 sacks every week i will continue to do this 56 sacks lets get it
sacks will be down from average just because of how often the browns run the ball and utilize their running backs

tfls should be up tho
12

their oline is top notch in pass blocking and baker is an elusive little shit

last year we only had 2 sacks on him through both games
a bakers dozen
i picked 34 last week and i was wrong i picked 57 this week and i hope im not wrong this time i know that the browns have a good oline but i dont doubt that the steelers d will suck against the run who knows
i love that this is a thing we can do each week thats how good our defense is
i get it position changes are a big deal i played football through college i understand the game the differences at different positions but hilton is a better cover guy than edmunds hilton is smaller for sure but hes proven he can make big hits and open field tackles he played some safety in college and the steelers have even put him at safety on occasion

im not saying he replaces edmunds hilton is very valuable in his current role but situationally i think the guy needs some work at safety we have other cbs that can fill in as the nickle and whats happening with layne heard nothing of him

personal opinion obviously but the one weakness on this defense seems to be giving up long pass plays nelson hasnt been great either but i think playing with hilton at some safety could pay dividends hes just so versatile
he has played some safety his pick two games ago came from safety
hes not near good enough in coverage
honestly sean davis was really good in hiltons role his rookie year wouldnt mind seeing hilton at ss and davis at nickel

great news excited we wont have a backup center in this week
abdominal injuries are tough decastro may be out for a while and less effective for even longer

dj gets banged up a lot he needs to bulk up and protect himself more
i am glad we are staying relatively very healthy all things considered lets hope it continues
thank god pouncey
that year when bpa randomly drops two instant impact stud rookies in your lap on draft day who just happen to be at the exact positions where you wind up needing injury depth

dotson is strong as fuck

no one has blown him up once yet and hes gone against some strong ass dts

im perfectly with letting decastro heal up 100 and letting dotson start
wondered what kendrick lamar was doing with javon hargrave then remembered kevin dotson is on the team
hargrave is no slouch to toss like that
you dont see that happen to j wobble very often
looks like he was supposed to help on the doubleteam but dotson moved him so far pouncey didnt know what to do lol
god damn that is exciting to watch
had pouncey known dotson was gonna rag doll hargrave he would have gotten a better block on 50 which would have resulted in a bigger gain

probably a no duh situation but still

looking at the depth chart were very thin at tackle and very deep at guard we have four guards that could be starting in decastro feiler dotson and wisniewski meanwhile we had to sign a practice squad tackle for depth so why did we decide to move feiler to guard especially when we drafted and signed guards in the offseason what am i missing
wisnieswki was supposed to be the swing guard and chuks was supposed to be the swing tackle dotson is a rookie and ideally wasnt supposed to play at all they moved feiler to guard bc they believe hes even better at that position than he is at tackle
we had villanueva okorafor banner to start the year feiler can and has moved to tackle due to injury so they probably just wanted to keep as many young guys as they could to develop this line is getting old
feiler can play tackle too
did you forget that zach banner was injured in week 1 and just because feiler now starts at guard doesnt mean he isnt allowed to play tackle and provide depth there if necessary

girlfriend threw this in for another birthday gift for me today also as something small

our women get us dont mind the hate from other people
is it only available in pittsburgh
i certainly hope that your apparently single minded idea of juju is more because he is a steeler than him himself

because odds are he is not going to be in the black and gold next year
ive been so conflicted with this

i love juju hes kind of a poor mans michael thomas with his insane chemistry with ben they just have that thing with them hes incredible in the locker room i dont want to see him leave

however with how well diontae johnson did last year basically became the new antonio brown in our offense and chase claypools breakout game as well as solid alternative options like eric ebron vance mcdonald or james washington do we really need juju

its his contract year and hes probably going to want more than 12 millionyear which he deserves however we saw last season hes really only best when hes with ben once he retires we dont really know how juju will do considering how he underperformed while johnson did well with rudolph and hodges

assuming we make no contract moves this year i believe we enter next year with about 6 million in the hole assuming we go to the minimum cap space next year we could be as low as 16 million i dont know if rolled over cap is taken into account in my reference assuming we can restructure bens contract and extend him another year to pay other players there are several players we need to pay as well as juju theres the question mark around bud dupree theres feiler who is very important on our o line and theres james conner who i think has been playing like he deserves a hopefully teamfriendly contract

lets say since ben is making 41 million next season we cut that to 30 million get our cap to 5 million over and extend ben one more year to let him keep his money while we work on a longer term contract assuming he agrees to this with that 5 million should we sign juju considering how many extensions we need to sign that are pretty key
there is no reason not to sign juju juju wants to stay here and so does the organization to my understanding i think both sides have made this very clear given their relationship they will come to an agreement that benefits both sides this is my opinion and what i think i got zero inside info unfortunately dont think well let a guy like juju walk hes too special
watt comes first and then depending on the cap situation you let him walk
if the price is right and they can make it all work which they probably can after seeing the heyward deal happen when everyone thought we had no money im never going to doubt omar kahn and the front offices ability to make shit work than they absolutely should
yes we should pay him
i think we need to find a way to keep him with a back heavy deal

however ben needs to sign an extension for like 5m if hes serious about winning more rings and finishing his career on a high note i hope hes willing to do that
just throwing this out there but the steelers are going to be 18 million over the cap at the start of the offseason they will also have all of the following players as free agents this might be a tough offseason in terms of finances

bud dupree alejandro villanueva vance mcdonald matt feiler mike hilton cameron sutton james conner tyson alualu and juju smithschuster

those are only the major free agents the real question is going to be who will they focus on and who will they allow to walk
i love juju as much as everyone else but it doesnt make sense from a roster construction perspective when you have guys like claypool diontae and washington on their rookie deals we need to keep guys like watt who makes game changing plays on a regular basis we just dont have the cap and if we did wed be better spending it on nonskill position players dline oline secondary

x200b

other than ab we havent paid a wr in a long time
nope not unless hes willing to take a massive discount which he shouldnt hes earned the right to get his money
i trust the steelers front office to make the right call
i if i were the steelers fo id make him a reasonable offer for around the league average pay for a we not including rookie deals im not sure what that number would be

if i were juju i would take the best offer i get

so i think another team is going to overpay for him no hard feelings no bad blood ill still probably root for him when he isnt playing against us thats just the business maybe later on once hes made his money and slowed a bit he can come back as a reliable veteran to help out whoever replaces ben
i love juju but most of the guys that the front office are letting go to free agency are going to be gone

the steelers are going to be capcrunched next year especially if there is a significant lowering of the cap

juju smithschuster new york jet is more likely than the steelers resigning juju
yes we should pay him unfortunately the only way i see that as possible is getting rid of some talent conner and al would probably be out of the picture either mcdonald or ebron would be traded or cut we better pray that stadiums are filled to full capacity pretty soon because the salary cap is based on how much money the league makes

edit i could see juju signing a team friendly deal where most of his money comes at the end of his contract like how nelsons contract was structured he would not make much in 2021 but hed be compensated with more money a couple years in
1000 you sign juju
no
making this post just so you all know
personally i wanted him to go to the dolphins i was eager to see how that would work and they have the cap room chiefs they have ceh im surprised they took this route
unlikely but think if the steelers knock out kc in the playoffs with bell on the team talk about the ultimate revenge
leveon is andy reids dream rb this should be fun to watch
fuck can you imagine the plays andy reid is going to draw up with him i think theyre going to be fun to watch ngl
at least it wasnt new england
didnt understand how the chiefs went with only a first round rookie at rb and a bunch of unknowns behind him that changes things big timr
this might be a weird sentiment but at least it wasnt the bills like we already knew the chiefs are the best team besides the steelers obviously in the afc but the bills would have been really scary
so that means the chiefs definitely wont win the super bowl this year right karma has to show up for the win on this one
good someone elses problem
i cannot think of a better place for him hes going to absolutely dominate in that offense its going to be really interesting to see how the snaps are divvied up between him and ceh though
owner in 2018 thank god i took conner also as a steelers and pitt fan now i own ceh in a league this year

dear lev please stop killing my fantasy seasons
hes not known for his decision making just sayin
too bad he would have been a huge upgrade over glass man conner shame we couldnt get him back especially with nyj paying the bills
i have ceh in fantasy there goes 5 points a week
they havent had a runner that dynamic and versatile since they didnt bother to resign lesean mccoy
the chiefs are stupid makes them worse lol
that should help wreck their chemistry dynasty postponed
chiefs vs steelers in the superbowl s
what do you think was the more clutch play in super bowl xlii the james harrison interception or the santonio holmes tippy toe catch if i were to choose of the two i would say the james harrison interception lmk what you guys think
i believe the most clutch play of xlii was the helmet catch
james harrison if the holmes pass was incomplete they would have had 3rd and 4th down to try again harrison managed to go down the entire field without getting tackled the offense never would have had a chance to score before halftime if he was tackled
harrisons play was a 14 point swing instead of cards getting points the steelers got 7
holmes was more clutch youre clutch when you execute under pressure

harrison was opportunistic he didnt execute he improvised he didnt have time to be under pressure just reacted harrisons play was unbelievable but it wasnt clutch just awesome

both were great
in superbowl xliii it was definitely the santonio catch not only was it at the end of the game for the win but it was an amazing throw and catch regardless of context
honestly its hard to say both are super important to getting the win but given that holmes was triple covered ben threw a perfect pass that only holmes could catch the toe tap the score at the time and the time remaining i have to give it to holmes both are great and its an impossible decision but we might win if harrision doesnt run it back we dont win if holmes doesnt catch it

hope he does has a better opportunity than the jets fave him good luck
thanks for the extra info
kill me
cya in the playoffs lev we have quite a few defensive players to introduce you to since you were last seen on a jetski
i know he hasnt even suited up yet but i just checked the chiefs website and their team ypc is already dropping

we wish him well on his future endeavours and things of that nature
lets get this championship boys i want to go through kansas city and eliminate bell
at least it wasnt new england
mr big ring chaser
here we go steelers here we go

lets use this shit to explain to the rest of the nfl why we are the goddamned pittsburgh steelers

fuck em let them sign antonio brown too we will still kick their asses
fuck me i have ceh on my fantasy team
okay so who should we make 38 posts about us maybe signing next
fuck leveon and kc
bell pulls a kd so essentially he got the money he wanted from the beginning and still gets his best chance to win a ring man that pisses me off
no need to be upset according to this sub hes a hasbeen locker room cancer who will absolutely kill the chiefs from within

somehow lev turned into ab and were supposed to believe that two bad years on the jets yes the jets means hes a washed up old man lets ignore that he was ranked 1 in yards from scrimmage per game in nfl history prior to joining the jets
well bell already got his money realizes theres no additional giant contracts in his future may as well try and get a ring
suck it everyone that wanted him to come back
damn dude that worked out well for him
i will say this tomlin and the steelers fo must really believe in our running back group because there were a lot of free agent backs this year and we didnt make a move on a single one
i was first in my fantasy i had helare and dak very bad week for me
rip i posted this before you and it barely got any traction
honestly good for him he got out of a toxic situation i hope no ill will towards him chiefs were gonna be a tough match up for us no matter what
thats good now the chiefs locker room will become a mess
steelers gonna regret not picking him up now they gonna have to play against him with an already stacked offense
hmmmmbig surprise
removed
this is a steelers sub kid we dont do magic football here
obligatory advisory telling people not to send money to random people on the internet

if its brown flush it down if its yellow let it 50
the last few years made me hate the browns more than the other afc north rivals bungals and browns are switching places from the hate to pitty and vice versa

fuck the browns
theyre just bitter from never being good
steelers nation
i remember the top comment in our sub being the virgin brown elf vs chad steeler which was great
imagine being a browns fan and actually believing your team was worthwhile
browns can suck my fat cocktail
thats a very bad definition of cute
or hit him over the head with a helmet
in fairness it is a lovely drawing
go check the comments i have one on there similar to the browns
itd be cuter if the steeler slammed the metal rod right into brownies face
myles
fuck the browns i didnt forget
to be fair there was a comment very similar that someone from this sub commented what is this selective bs
hm louis lipps not really a huge name but played in the 80s

5 santonio holmes what seals this for me is the tippy toe catch although we had a fall out at the end of his career i would still consider in the top 5

4hines ward my favorite player i mean cmon he broke a guys friggin jaw

3 lynn swann playing in the 70s he was well known for his majestic swan like catches in the air he help guide the steelers to 4 super bowl rings

2 john stallworth like swann stallworth also played in the 70s he also helped the steelers to 4 super bowl rings

1 antonio brown i hate to say it i really do but damn was he good its a shame what happened but a wise man once said hard work beats talent when talent doesnt work hard except in this case ab was just a whining baby

let me know what you guys think also keep in mind this post is completely my opinion if youd make changes drop them down below but dont be a jag off
ab is absolutely the most talented and best wr to ever be on the steelers no one wants to admit it though because of how he left
ive seen most steelers games since 1972 the game has changed so much that you just cant really compare players separated by 20 years or more

swann was a highlight reel at wr he made so many spectacular catches yet was rarely targeted more than 45 times per game look at his play in sb x he was only targeted 4 times yet he made 4 spectacular catches his unbelievable catch vs targeted ratio is probably the highest of any player not to mention that dbs could legally mug receivers and he played alongside stallworth which he had to share about 20 throws a game with given the same opportunities as ab i cannot imagine the numbers swann would have had

had swan played in the days of sportscenter he would have dominated the broadcast as much as ab did but i agree that what ab accomplished in his years here cements him as the best wr in steelers history
this list is pretty objective i do have to say myself
lipps should be 2 ward 3 yancey should be somewhere on there santonio doesnt belong on the list id take plaxico over santonio
not trying to be a jag off but the countdown of 54345 really threw me for a loop for a few seconds having lipps as the hm helped me realize ab was 1 i really want to advocate for swann but as graceful as he was ab is just on another level
list is incomplete without yancey thigpen
no limas sweed yeah okay buddy cute list
might be just my personal bias but id throw in randle el in as an hm dude was so versatile and useful for us
pretty good list imo id move thigpen into 5th and put santonio as hm but thats just me well done though
limas sweed
no issues here personally id swap ward and stallworth ward will always be underrated outside pittsburgh santonio was great but lipps belongs at 5 lot of good candidates for hm but i loved yancy
you forgot claypool
1 ab

2 stallworth

3 ward

4 buddy dial

5 swann

lipps holmes plaxico yancey looking in

buddy dial is just criminally underrated he put up two 1000 yard seasons and just missed with 972 and 981 in two more even better that 972yard season came in a 12game 1960 season so yeah add that one the rest of course were 14game seasons so he was putting up ridiculous numbers 925 yards per game in 1963 in general

taking into context the time period buddy dial truly was ahead of the game and nobody remembers him because those steelers teams were terrible

for comparison swanns best season came in 1978 when he caught 61 passes for 880 yards swann was unquestionably more clutch but he also played on a team that put him in positions to be clutch also to be fair to swann those steelers teams had more options and thus had to spread it around more the defense also allowed them to play conservatively when needed

for me though dial goes above swann he was huge in a time when the steelers had little else and he was wayyyy ahead of the game at that time swann was not the best wr on his own team dial absolutely was and it wasnt close

also you can have a similar discussion surrounding jack butleralltime steelers defenders dudes in the hall of fame and i bet 5 out of 10 average steelers fans at least cant tell you what position he played
waitdid you forgot moncrief
martavis bryant
stallworth and hines 1 2 or gtfo

based steely dan
in a fight steely would beat brownie to a little brown pile of pulp with him steel beam then got to the bar and pound a few ics
not the proudest feature of either franchise frankly
inspired by upandaes drawing
i forgot steely existed tbh
lol did they ever announce that steely was gone or one day he just never came back
its a tie they both are terrible
are we being proud of steely mcbeam now because im not really on board for that
steely mcbeam is boaty mcboatface of mascots
idk bro browns mascot look like he pull bitches for a hobby while the steelers look like a family loving christian man
since when is the browns mascot not a furry from the dawg pound
theyre actually the same age steely looks way older because he has 5 kids and constantly worried about being laid off at the plant
trade steely iceburgh and oliver onion pierogie to philly for gritty
the steelers need to bring back this guy the terrible fan



the guy inside that costume by the way was my high school guidance counselor
keebler elf vs chad steely
steely mcbeam is such a low bar though
what the fuck is that is that a real thing in cleveland steely sucks as well but christ at least we tried
they both look like the thing of nightmares tbh
this is my favorite meme now
we all know where the rebar would go
we also all know which team is superior
we actually had a huge thing happen in the browns sub brownie isnt an elf brownie is a mythical creature in europe called a brownie calling a brownie an elf is like calling a dwarf a gnome
no way brownie is a virgin the woman in cleveland are all fat whores with big hair and old cameros with the paint peeling on the roof
brownie the soy boy
why dont the browns just use jeff sessions as their mascot probably a copyright issue
scooter life eastish side bruh
we won more nflafl championships

with a broken freakin neck
it seems like such a strange story line now eugenes character was literally retarded thats probably why they gave him the browns jersey lol
oh its true its damn true
undertaker threw mankind off the cage during that hell in a cell match people always joke about in pittsburgh too
how is this my first time seeing this epic
eugene won that match tho
this is a football forum

not a thinly veiled homoeroticism forum

ive been excited since he tapped his toes on the sideline against the giants
as an nd fan also ive been so excited for claypool

he never had the system of qb to make the most of his talents in college ben is legitimately the perfect qb for him in that hes proven to be very willing to throw up 5050 balls to wrs he trusts

obviously no guarantees but he has the tools to be an absolutely elite

claypool looks legit

has a good first step for a big wr stays under control quickly closes the space on slay hits him with a head fake outside and gets inside with an arm over

catches the ball with his hands and hangs on through contact

my comparison has been larry fitz in term of his tool set at a young age the kid has a crazy high football iq as a rookie that breakdown a few days ago shows how he was communicating with juju on the line

on top of that the way he turns his shoulders for his jump ball is just like fitz his main difference from fitz is that his size is more like calvin or julio which is crazy

im not convinced hes going to be an elite receiver only because hes very young and has a lot of work to do to get there but if he keeps improving hell definitely have a crazy ceiling
canadian bacon isnt just for pizza anymore

its too bad one of his best moves of the game was the play where he got a phantom opi call
i know
well as long as nguyen thinks so
guys im hearing that claypool good anyone else hear this

fuck the browns
gonna be the best steelers browns game since moving to heinz fun fact steelers beat the browns 16 straight years at three rivers from the time it opened 1970 until 1986 looking forward to sunday fuck the browns
hey now theres a lot of us steelers fans in oh
should i be worried
always has been

james harrison was a baaaaaaaaaaad man
this does not seem to be the most unbiased of articles tbh

i approve of the message of the title though
lions fan coming in peace but knowing that megatrons name will be carried on to another franchise in chase claypool as mapletron just warms my heart good luck on the rest of the season dont worry i know the lions are horrible lol firepatricia
career games calvin 135 chase 4

career 4 td games calvin 0 chase 1

gg calvin
always have love for the lions best football subreddit out there aside from ours of course and you guys were so wonderful to us in super bowl xl basically a home game

also home of the bus
no nickname is as great as teddy bridgewater aka theodore throwsevelt
i heard him referred to as canadian bacon yesterday and rather liked that
my brotherinlaw is a lions fan so theyre my nfc team watching matthew stafford has been tough this season

i know we had to weather rudolphhodges last year but at least we had no expectations for them stafford randomly fluctuates between top 5 qb in the league to not deserving of a roster spot on any given drive
as a lifelong steelers fan and an irish fan and fan of chase i wanted him to earn or make his own name attributed to his greatness plus i personally think mapletron sounds like a put down
its terrible but just yinzer enough to catch on
imagine being a lions fan and watching barry sanders and calvin johnson two of the greatest skill players at their position retire in the prime of their careers because playing for detroit had totally broken their spirit
rtitlegore
its a shame megatron wasted his career on such a franchise i know he got paid so its hard to feel bad for him but still
lol sorry but metcalf is the new megatron
i genuinely hope that this sunday will be a good football game im really nervous about your pass rush i think this will probably be the best browns steelers game since ive been alive
i went to a game in cleveland a few years ago i expected to have a lessthanpleasant time but had a good experience with browns fans seated near me
this game for sure will be tense i hope theres no injuries on both teams and everything hopefully will be clean excited for sunday
last years games were pretty fun i dont remember being this excited about a matchup for a while
i hope this is the game that renews our rivalry because the ravens and their fans are just the worst in all ways i respect the die hard browns fans
i enjoy and welcome your teams relevance kind of sucks baltimore is still so good at least cincinnati is back to being their adorable chilionspaghettieating shit show selves whyd you get rid of sea world it was so appropriate in ohio
fuck off

this is the gpodawund
this just made my day
this reminds me of this article i read about the owner of the browns

marketing executives wanted employees to see how fans were engaging with the browns on social media so they projected the browns feed onto a giant wall at the facility it was like broadcasting talk radio over the entire building and one day in particular it was worse than that one of the marketing staffers entered a search for dp for dawg pound the problem was that hashtag carried a few different meanings one of which triggered an array of porn to be broadcast onto a wall for the entire office to see for more than 20 minutes until a tech employee killed the feed
that title gore though
gpodawund forever
this has to be photoshopped no way are they making it this easy
as a browns fan this makes me laugh
thats the sound bakers gonna be making after tuitt breaks his ribs
competency at its finest
the perfect representation of the browns organization
lmao this is great to see


view poll
if our oline can hold up to myles garret our wrs should have a great game against a poorly playing secondary cleveland is a run first offence and our run defense has been excellent given these trends the steelers should win
the steelers
steelers 31

browns 28

closer than we want and we trail most of the game but a last second boswell fg kick to win the game juju has his named called and has a big game out of the slot run game spread amongst everyone including more reverses by ray ray and other wrs cant wait
call me crazy but i like the team from pittsburgh in this one
gonna be a close game i got the steelers of course but i think theyll make it close to the end just hope we shut down hunt and the run game
it will be close in the first half we will look bad in the 3rd quarter but the defense will show up and make a few good stops and ben will seal the deal in the last 90 seconds of the 4th quarter
10 people hate winning i guess
i think that the steelers will win
we got 37 rbrowns lurkers in here
after seeing that both of their starting safeties are out i feel more comfortable picking the steelers
steelers baby

my bf and i have our predictions on a white board in our office i think its going to be a low scoring game because i think both teams are going to bring it i have my prediction at 2417 steelers he thinks it will be a high scoring game and he has it at 3937 steelers im confident in my prediction but he still wants to think about his before locking it in we do this with football and nascar and we can change our predictions right up until gamerace day
browns arent quite ready yet theyve got talent but a lot of bad character guys on their team time to being them back to reality steelers win 3813
im calling it right here steelers by 3
cleveland 27

steelers 24

these losses happen to every team that wins the superbowl like this one will but like vegas at kc last week cleveland is going to pull out every last trick they have to win this week
steelers

bakers out and were not so hot against back ups so i say its a bit closer than wed like

steelers 31

browns 24

stay classy yinzers
were better than thisleave it for the gameday thread
reminds me of blitz the league
happy halloween to you too
ouch
he will be on at 125 today
watched the interview with mapletron and it was great mcafee getting a lot of steelers on recently

they wasted them on bell and brown such a shame
omg i need to start a funko pop steelers collectionnow i love these
where do i buy these i want all of them haha
ok i was going to make an amazon wishlist of funko pops and i ended up making a wishlist of all sorts of cool steelers stuff instead
i got them partially from amazon and some from ebay

some of the older ones like the polamalu and ben arent available brand new anymore so you have to trust resellers on ebay and amazon really for those and make sure you get the original box they come in

by my research there are 6 more that were made and those are on the way next week for me

1 brown in white jersey
2 bell in white jersey
3 brown in color rush
4 ben in color rush w knit hat
5 ben in bumblebee w cap
6 bradshaw in white jersey

x200b

that will complete the collection of every pop funko ever made i believe
2 wrs 2 qbs 2 hbs and 2 defensive players is all they made
whos the block head in the 84 jersey i think that one was a mistake you should burn it
is it just me or does the game this week feel like a trap there has been so much talk about how the browns cant beat us at home that it is going to happen

i really hope i am wrong here but man is it making me nervous
its not a trap game if the other team is good which the browns have been so far
yeah not at all a trap game this game has been one our guys have been looking forward to
you should be nervous not because of the talk that they havnt won in hienz in lord knows how long but because the browns are legit
theyre 41 wheres the trap how do you not take a game for the division lead seriously just because the fans are ignoring the browns doesnt mean the team is
browns will be the best team weve played so far i dont think that counts as a trap
this is a pretty solid football team were playing this week well coached and pretty efficient on offense

defense is defense anyone can score on a defense these days so not really too concerned about moving the ball and putting points on the board
i dont know why people still think the browns are the 016 team of old

they are wellcoached and have heaps of talent

do not forget they made our 1 defense last year look like clowns the first time

this is gonna be a tough ass game
its not a trap game when both teams are 40 and 41
the trap game will be the jags or the football team im betting this is going to be a straight afcn showdown
rival games are not trap games trap games are games where you have a big game the next week and a weak opponent this weak if anything the eagles game was the trap game
steelers know how important divisional games are especially when its for division lead
do you know what a trap game actually is because facing a 41 team is not a trap game
last year we had a historically bad offense which led to the defense being on the field for longer during each game this inherently gives our defense more plays to rack up sacks

i went through our games last year and found we had an average time of possession of just over 27 minutes per game this year over our first 4 games we have an average time of possession of 3311 this means that our defense is on the field for 6 less minutes each game we are currently tied for the lead in sacks with 20 with one less game played than most teams and our offense being able to hold onto the ball and sustain drives the breakdown from last year is below

excellent post someone posted earlier about the lack of turnovers our defense created this was my response we spent way more time on the field
thats an insane 20 less time on the field thats like 2 whole drives less
if you take a look at the subs like rravens and rbrowns they utilize their downvote as a heinz bottle and a steelers logo respectively obviously nobody gives a rats ass about the bengals and just mentioning pittsburgh to them can send them into a neurotic rage they just have arrows

sure we have our downvote as the color of the ratbirds i suppose but as of late its just so obvious to see fts everywhere i love it hate us wish you were us and cincy maybe just try to beat us the browns and ravens have good teams so whatever but its just crazy how much free real estate we get in the afcn without really having to do anything
the browns downvote button changes to the logo of the team theyre playing that week
the browns update their downvote every week to the team they are playing
i am color blind but arent our down votes the same color as the general reddit down votes or can i just not see the difference
light purple is the default color of the downvote
we all have free real estate in each others heads this division has the most bad blood roots of any could maybe argue nfc eastnorth but id disagree

i could say based on the of browns posts here right now which i love btw been a lot of fun coming here youd never know the browns have been perennial bottomfeeders for the last 2 decades
til the end of time i hate the phrase real estate in head

oh you dont like the team that beat you a lot quit thinking about us losers herpaderp

who cares
i dont like that i have to subscribe to rbrowns to downvote i dont want that garbage cluttering up my main page
wish our upvotes were like the browns down votes where the actual colors of our logo appear

dude its wild

same with seahawks and cardinals fans reminds me of that scene in mad men

i dont think about you at all
ravens fans dont care about the steelers lmao yall are frauds and will not win this division yall are a nonissue big ben is getting old steelers will be old news in a matter of weeks along with getting swept by the ravens lmao delusional steelers as always were more concerned about being the 1 seed


that secondary tho
teller is a huge factor in the run game his absence is being super overlooked
their defense is pretty bad should be plenty of space for our receivers to make plays teller is a big loss on their line too should be some good battles in the trenches
their secondary missing a few players sendejo is still playing ben boutta have a good day
this could turn into a shootout real fast
middle of the field is going to be easy pickens for ben i expect ebron to bounce back along with whoever occupies that space this is going to be a shootout
i dont know what is a worse fate playing against our olbs without a starting tackle or playing against our idl without a starting guard
man i hope we blow the doors off them then we can go back to making it difficult next week
were the walking wounded and still learning a new system im afraid our best opportunity to give you a good fight will be the second time we meet up at the end of the season hopefully it will mean something and were past covid with a full crowd at first energy good luck tomorrow and take it easy on our quarterback and defensive end

i seem to remember the browns subreddit mods throwing a hissy fit when our mod posted about it on their sub last year and their fans werent very intelligent or civilized about it wouldnt surprise me if they just decided to skip the browns games this year
yeah i did a quick run through their sub nothing there would make me think thered be anything resembling a civil or productive conversation

google stats have been fucked since week 4 and for some reason live updates track way behind the game like halftime is happening and according to google its a few minutes into the first quarter no game stats or player stats have been available either

no fucking clue what is going on with google but as someone who uses google to track stuff while at work this has been frustrating
they can just put 50 save time later
number of games scheduled minus number of wins must equal number of losses right
1000 am
technically speaking they did lose a game

even upon seeing your  comment the only question that sprung to mind was why

kieth butler
the amount of hype this article gave me is unreal cant wait for sunday lets go blitzzzburgh
good read blitzburgh is back babyyyy


if you wanna reconcile with mason admit that you lied about saying the n word kill off the slander before you even consider reconciliation
1 i dont believe rudolph said the n word to him

2 even if he did hell never admit to it

3 if he didnt say it hes justifiably outraged that garrett made this up in an attempt to make himself look better if he did say it and hell never admit it he basically has no choice but to deny it and demand garrett apologize anyway because thats what someone who didnt say it would do or else he kisses his career goodbye

basically theres no reconciliation unless garrett apologizes for making the claim
if myles wants to apologize im sure mason would consider it
isnt this almost the exact same thing myles said during the offseason he should just let this go he is pretty much a defensive star in the nfl and mason may never become more than a backup he legit doesnt have anything to gain from it at this point besides stirring up a really fucking bad mark on his career

x200b

if he really needs closure just issue another apology over twitter or such accept it if mason forgives you at that time and if not dont bring it up anymore
is this the same story that was circulating around the start of the season before then maybe or am i just having deja vu
is rudolph still in the league dude is trash

i feel like this stat doesnt really say anything steelers face 3rd4th downs more frequently couldnt that be seen as a negative where is the pass going screen on 3rd and 20

a better stat would be 1st down conversion rate on 3rd4th down this stat out of context tells us next to nothing

not a jab at you op just a comment on the stat presented lol
id rather have 3rd4th down completion percentage than just totals that stat can easily be skewed if we are throwing far more than other teams on 3rd and 4th down
i dont think thats a good stat what it really says is we have a lot of 3rd and 4th downs
i dont think thats a good stat what it really says is we have a lot of 3rd and 4th downs
i dont think thats a good stat what it really says is we have a lot of 3rd and 4th downs
